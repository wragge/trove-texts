Literary Notes.
Over the Coals .
[This paper demurs,to some of the data, as well as
some of the conclusions, which follow, But it has lec-
tured contributors so often that it rather enjoys being
lectured by a contributor.]
The short story is the reduction of litera-
ture to the paragraph. It is something seen
in a flash and, however brilliant it may be,
a more continuous light is more impres-
sive. The short story has little grip ; and
few, even the best, will bear reading twice.
Try this experiment : Read Kipling—then read
Zola, a play ot (Shakespeare, or anything con- (
tinuous, and then go back to Kipling. You
feel that the latter starves the imagination
instead of feeding it. The short story is written
ho that no one need think or exercise his imagina-
tion. The man in the streets reads so many
papers and so quickly that he has no time to think
or imagine, and the short story is made for him.
When he tries something with depth in it he is
perplexed because the author demands thought,
and he votes the author a bore. One of The Bul-
letin’s most brilliant contributors confessed to
me that he could not read anything beyond a
column. Years ago, when I was at school with
him, he could read one book all day. At this rate
he will shortly be unable to fix his attention on
anything over a paragraph. And this I think is
the state of mind of the journalist, and the raison
d’etre of the short story. It does not justify such a
state of things to say that modern life is so hurried
that a man has no time for lengthened reading.
For the hurry is for Mammon, and to admit this
as a justification is merely to assert that literature
is to be pushed to the wall by greed.
*****
Again, Poe’s reason for the short poem must be
taken variously. It depends on the individual
how long an emotion will last. The fallacy in
Poe is this : to sustain a strong emotion for a long
time may be a physiological impossibility—that is,
one emotion —but a varied series of emotions may
be continued for a long time. I prefer to read a
play of Shakespeare at one sitting. Say it’s
“Othello”: I get a long series of emotions care-
fully varied and led to a climax without any sense
of fatigue. I read “Germinal ”in one stretch of
16 hours, and always read thus without a break
when I can, and find what is thus read makes a
deeper impression than would a whole year’s read-
ing of short stories. I quote myself because I
find numbers of people who read in the same way
—following Mrs. Browning’s hint to go “soul
forward into books profound,” and I cannot find
anything to envy in the man who can’t read any-
thing over a column.
* * * •
Coming down to Bulletin matters : it appears
to me that this condensation is pushed farther in
The Bulletin than anywhere else. There is
more decoration, scenery, in even Maupassant,
Coppee, Quiller Couch and other short-story
writers than in Bulletin work. Consequently
there is a loss in the latter. Thus, in Mont-
gomery’s “ Four Fools ” no one can tell from the
story itself where it takes place. One begins it
in the idea that the Netherlands have something
to do with it; then, half-way through, a bamboo-
bridge is mentioned, so one conjectures the East;
and then an obscure name is mentioned, which I
have not been able to trace in an atlas. It is my
previous knowledge of Montgomery that tells me
his scene is somewhere about Borneo. The same
withßecke —I find myself perpetually requiring the
help of previous knowledge of the South Seas to
construct the scenery. He knows the Islands so
well that he leaves out much that would be a help
to us who do not know them. I say this of
him and Montgomery while freely admiring the
character, incident, and dramatic power of both.
The same applies to Bulletin bush stories—one has
to be something of a bushman to appreciate them.
Some day a man with ideas will arise who’ll absorb
all The Bulletin’s bush work and turn it into
literature that the world—not bushmen only—will
read. He -will not know the bush anything like
as well as The Bulletin’s back-block contribu-
tors, but he will have what they lack—style,
passion, pathos, and big ideas—and he will simply
steal, as Shakespeare did, all their work and
transform it. The Bulletin coteries will cry
“Plagiarist!” but the world that knows nothing
of the back-block bards won’t listen, and will hail
him as Australia’s genius.
* * * »
Another point. The Bulletin makes strong
demands for originality. Sometime ago it said
no one was great through imitation, which I deny.
Every artist and literary man in the first rank
began by imitating some favorite. Shakespeare’s
earliest work is imitative —something else as well
—but imitative. Children learn by imitation ; in-
dividuality developes, and does not arise from a
preconceived desire for originality. If some
appear to have always been original, it simply
means that they have suppressed their earlier
imitative'work —as Wagner did. If a man is true
to himself he will attain all the originality he is
capable of. Seeking it, he merely lands in eccen-
tricity and gets farther and farther from the com-
mon ground of humanity, where all Art has its
power. There is nothing more pitiful than the
desire of half - read, small - brained creatures
of originality. They seek some sensational
effect in some accident; they get a small smatter-
ing of cheap science and work it in, and call that
original. The result is melodrama—without the
good there is in stage-melodrama. The Bulletin
short story works up to “He is dead ” or “He
is dead-drunk” —this being a generalisation of the
two favorite climaxes—one some novel accident,
the other a “ sell.” By “ accident,” I mean some
external cause acting on the characters, who are
at the mercy of it, and this is characteristic of
melodrama. Incidents —the more sensational and
“original ” the better—fall upon the characters ;
while all true literature works the other way—the
characters command the circumstances.
* * * *
One other matter verse contributions. I
have seen it printed that Swinburne is the
favorite poet of The Bulletin. Whether this be
so or not, the trail of Swinburne is over all The
Bulletin verse. I admire Swinburne, but find
him the least helpful of poets—helpful as regards
writing or living. He is never dramatic—he
o«kn’t be —never soul-searching. I find more
passion in ten lines of Browning and bits of Ten-
nyson than in all the “Laus Veneris ” and others.
He wails over a dead love ; Browning gives you a
real woman. And his wail is that of a burnt-out
voluptuary. Browning gives you torrid passion in
a healthy man. I contrast the two because I fancy
The Bulletin cares little for Browning. Most
journalists I know worship Swinburne—l think
because Swinburne requires no introspection,
while Browning does. The journalist has no
time • his faculty of collecting humorous pars,
would be lost if he introspected. My point is :
that it would give far more of an impulse to Aus.
writers to read Browning than to read Swinburne.
It is not for nothing that Kipling’s earlier work is
woven in and out with Browning. Gontrast
Browning’s roughness and Swinburne’s melody if
you like, but melody is an adjunct— though a
necessary one in verse. It is music one goes to for
melody, and no poet ever understood the aim and
end of music so much as Browning. A man whose
pleasure from verse mainly arises from its music
is merely gratifying a rudimentary taste, which,
if fully developed, would seek satisfaction from
another art. I have a notion, too mainly de-
rived from pars, published—that The Bulletin
cares least for music—that is, symphonic music
of all the arts. If so, it fits in with the slurring
of Browning and the psychological because all
music is soul-searching. The greatest musicians
- the Germans —are the greatest metaphysicians ;
and the merely practical nations like the English,
are lowest in music, philosophy, tragic drama,
tragic acting, the roots of which are all found
within, not without. .
* * * *
In conclusion, it appears to me that three
ladies Ethel Turner, Lilian Turner, Louise
Mack —have brought The Bulletin the best
literature that it has published. They give charac-
ters, and dig their stories out of hearts, besides
employing the charm of literary finish. J.H.G.
“ Casa Braccio.”
Marion Crawford belongs to that delightful
class of novelists whom, thank Literature! it is
not necessary to read as Trilby posed “ for the
altogether.” In the press of authors who must
be skimmed if one is to keep within hailing dis-
tance of the spirit of the publishers, gratitude to
the author who can be skipped is almost a religion.
“Casa Braccio” (Macmillan) is Crawford’s
twenty-fifth story, and—so several English critics
say—his best. So that here again is matter for
thanks. The artist who “ revolves in a cycle of
masterpieces, of which each is more perfect than
the last,” allows us to separate his cream on very
easy terms.
Distinctly second-rate, Crawford is still a plea-
sant companion. If he cannot excite, he can
generally interest, and even when he does not
interest he does not bore. Many faint little
flashes of man-o’-the-world philosophy light his
books: occasionally he crystallises tersely and
aptly some trut i of observation. And he con-
structs admirably ; his studies of character (see
his Italian peasants) are keen; and his fluent
stvle brightens now and then into something
approaching eloquence of phrase.
The first part of “ Casa Braccio ” tells the loves
of an Italian nun and a Scotch doctor—tempta-
tion, fall, flight. To good Catholics this will
seem sacrilegious, and good Protestant- will
resent just as much the nemesis which (in Parts
11. and III.) follows the sacrilege. Sister Maria
Addolorata soon dies ; Align- Dalrymple nourishes
a lifelong grief. Their daughter embitters one
man’s life, ruins another’s, and suicides. Her son
is left alive—to dree his hereditary weird in
another novel, after the fashion of Zola? It is a
pity, or a pleasure (according to the point of view)
that the Sin is much more agreeably and con-
vincingly described than is the Punishment.
Charles Kingsley*
“Yeast” and “Water Babies” are two new
volumes in Macmillan’s pocket Kingsley series.
“Yeast ” has more rational interest than most of
the hateful, class of novels with a purpose. One
can skip the preaching, and the remainder isn’t
bad reading. There is a delicious bit of bathos
when Lancelot pops to Argemone. The lady’s
eyes shone out like t wain lakes of still azure, beneath a
broad marble cliff of polished forehead.
And this allusion isn’t bad for a clergyman of
“ the Established Church ” :
“ Quieo sabe,” said the Spanish girl, when they asked
her who was her child’s father.
“Water Babies” is pleasant enough, but too
long The satire is sometimes good, more fre-
quently clumsy. The interspersed verses touch on
cleverness. This bit of manly sentiment is well-
known, but should be known better :
When all the world is young, lad,
And all the trees are green ;
And every goose a swan, lad,
And every lass a queen ;
Then hey for boot and horse, lad,
And round the world away ;
Young blood must have its course, lad,
And every dog his day.
When all the world is old, lad,
And all the trees are brown ;
And all the sport is stale, lad,
And all the wheels run down ;
Creep home, and take your place there,
The spent and maimed among ;
God grant you find one face there,
You loved when all was young.
Lawson’s new book of verses has received a
cordial welcome from press critics, and its per-
manence in Australian literature is assured.
Copies will be sent from this office for ss. sd. in
stamps or postal notes of any province.
The new Poet Laureate commemorates the
defeat of Jameson’s freebooters in verse which
befits himself, his office, and his subject. A
sample :
Right sweet is the marksman’s rattle,
And sweeter the cannon’s roar;
But ’tis bitterly bad to battle,
Beleaguered, and one to four.
I can tell you it wasn’t a trifle
To swarm over Krugersdorp Glen,
As they plied us with round and rifle,
And ploughed us again and again.
Pass the sentiment, though all the right, all the
honor, are on the side of the Boers ; and consider
the style ! Imagine Swinburne’s sardonic grin !
Conceive Kipling’s disgust at the mishandling of
a metre with which he fires the blood ! Nothing
lamer, flatter, more insipid, more disastrously com-
monplace was ever penned by alleged bard. It is
to be hoped Alfred Austin will be spared to write
reams of similar stuff, in order that the notion of
“ honor ” may be for ever detached from the office
of Court-sycophant. Evidently, he is anxious to
show he can earn his sherry, even if he does not
get it. Maginn, in a brilliant set of Latin-English
verses, refers to the uses first found for the
Laureate’s wine on the Laureate s island :
Fair Sherry, Port’s sister, for years they dismissid her
To comfort the kitchen-maids’ bellies.
Literary associations considered, revocation of the
dismissal was an absurd error.
A Nineteenth Century article classifies U.S.
population (according to the last census)

Various European nationalities .. 13,000,000

This is the miscellaneous mob which enthusiastic
British writers and orators refer to as sixty
millions of Anglo-Saxons.”
George Collingridge's “Discovery of Australia
gets from London Saturday Review a two-col.
notice which does justice to the author’s industry
and research, and does not grumble too much at
his literary shortcomings. “Whilst, therefore,
others in the same field may have made their work
more attractive so far as it went, none has pro-
duced a volume likely to prove more useful in
determining the evolution of Australian geo-
graphy.”
Sydney Telegraph's L<m ’on correspondent
says that Macmillan’s Col. Library is to be en-
i riched by Dent’s new Balzac series, and a com-
: plete Kipling and Hardy. The Balzac is as yet
three-fourths unpublished, so surely the cheaper
edition will restrict the market for it consider-
| ably ? As the best of Hardy is already issued in
Macmillan’s Library, news on this point is a
little “subsequent”; but a cheap Kipling is
badly needed. Six shillings is too much for most
book-buyers' pockets.
To Correspondents R. : “ Trilby ” was the
subject of one of the sheep-public’s periodical
obsessions, but there is nothing in the book to
justify the boom. And, frankly, discussion as to
which of its characters was who, and who
which, doesn’t in the least interest us Zeta :
Carlyle gave light to the darkness of a million
souls, and broke the heart of one woman who
loved him. (N.B.—'This isn’t exactly true, but
epigrams, like hares, aren’t meant to be eaten
quite fresh.) “Et s’il revenait.”—Further

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
ohronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEAEtNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven yeais, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I " rite you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, ns in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to beef suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood apd matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continu d the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALkhK,
Balmain, Sydney.” ....
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 1- months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, oauserl me great anxiety. I tried several tieat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. , „ ,
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicitie for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworlh, N.S.W.’.’
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify ttiat it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power. Signed

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed hia New and Centrally-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Si SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands arid feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you ean sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

The Marlyr.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Not only on cross and gibbet,
By sword, and fire, and flood,
Have perished the world’s sad martyrs
Whose names are writ in blood.
A woman lay in a hovel,
Mean, dismal, gasping for breath ;
One friend alone was beside her —
The name of him was—Death.
-For the sake of her orphan childien,
For money to buy them food,
ohe had slaved in the dismal hovel
And wasted her womanhood.
No rest; no pause ; but always—
-1 hrough sick’ning, stifling heat
1 hat, in panting days of summer,
Reeked in the squalid street,
When folk sat out on their doorstep
Praying for faintest stir
Of air—she kept slaving, slaving ;
There was no rest for her.
She worked with limbs sore-aching
And eyes that dare not tire,
In shuddering nights of winter,
With candle alone for fire.
The songs of the rolling seasons,
Tender, and gay, and grave
For others; for her had ever
The one grim burden—“ S’ave !
Winter and spring and summer
Came each with its load of ca es ;
And autumn to her brought only
A harvest of grey hairs.
Far out in the blessed country,
Beyond the smoky town,
The winds of Cod were blowing
Evermore up and down.
The trees were waving signals
Of joy from the bush beyond :
The gum its blue-green banner,
The fern its dark-green frond ;
Flow’r called to flow’r in whispers,
By sweet caressing names,
And young gum-shoots sprang up ward
Like woodland altar-flames ;
And, deep in the distant ranges^
The magpie’s fluting song
Roused musical, mocking echoes
In the woods of Dandenong;
And riders were galloping gaily
With loose-held flowing reins,
Through dim and shadowy gullies,
Across broad, treeless plains ;
And winds through the Heads came wafting
Breath of life from the sea,
And over the blue horizon
The ships sailed silently ;
And out of the sea at morning
The sun rose, golden-bright,
And in crimson and gold and purp'u
Sank in the sea at night;
But in dreams alone she saw them,
Her hours of toil between ;
Like galley-slave to his oar she
Was chained to her sewing-machine—
Save only when back and forward,
With tired and throbbing feet,
Bearing her work to the Sweater,
She trudged through the crowded street.
Loiter ? She dared not loiter,
Howe’er her heart might crave,
But passed, like a ghost at cockcrow
Hasting back to its grave.
Her heart was in the grave, too,
That held her children three,
Nor work, nor prayer could save them,
Nor tears of agony.
On the lips of her last and dearest
Pressing a farewell kiss,
She cried aloud in her anguish—-
“ Can God make amends for this
Dull, desperate, ceaseless, slaving
Bereft her of pow’er to pray,
And Man was careless and cruel,
And God was far away.
But who shall measure His mercies 7
His ways are in the deep ;
And, after a life of sorrow,
He gave her His gift of sleep.
Rest comes at last to the weary,
And freedom to the slave ;
Her tired and worn-out body
Sleeps well in its pauper grave.
But His angel bore her soul up
To that Bright Land and Fair,
Where Sorrow enters never,
Nor any cloud of Care.
They came to a lovely valley,
Agleam with asphodel,
And the soul of the woman speaking
Said —“ Here I fain would dwell !”
The Angel answered gently :
“ O soul most pure and dear !
O Soul most tried and truest! —
Thy dwelling is not here !
“ Behold thy place appointed—-
Long kept, long waiting—come !
Where bloom on the hills of heaven
The roses of martyrdom.”

■YANKEE - .DOODLE .
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has evei
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this.
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford tc

State Fire Insurance.
The proposal of the Maoriland Government
to create a State Fire Insurance Depart-
ment as the natural complement of the
marvellously solid and progressive State Life
Insurance Department already existing is a
remarkable forward step in the direction of
State Socialism. Also, viewed in a cold,
business aspect, with no reference to State
Socialism or any other abstract theory what-
ever, but as a mere matter of cash and con-
venience, there is a great deal to be said in
its favor. All the stereotyped objections,
and the old, threadbare Tory scoffs about
* ‘ State interference with private enter-
prise,” “coddling,” “ grandmotherly legisla-
tion,” and the other catchwords which the
stagnant party uses over and over again
because it is incapable of inventing anything
new, may, in the first place, he taken as
read. They prove nothing except the ex-
ceeding barrenness of the Tory intellect.
They were all employed by previous Tories
when State railways were first proposed, when
railways of any kind were first proposed,
when it was first proposed that the State
should own the telegraph system, and when
the State took over the post-office from
private speculators. Also, they were doubt-
less used when the State proposed to collect
the taxes direct instead of farming them out
to “ private enterprise,” when it began to
run the army and navy “ on its own” instead
of leaving them in private hands under the
primitive feudal system —in short, every
time the State attempted to do anything
which, it hadn’t done before. In very early
days the whole embodiment of the State was
an undressed autocrat, carrying a club with
some human hair and dried, brains on the
end of it to show where he had put down a
recent insurrection, and every time the State
has made or attempted any advance on that
primitive model, sound old Conservatives
have arisen to point out that it was going in
for wild and reckless experiments. There-
fore, this particular objection may be taken
for granted.
* * • *
Maoriland, like Australia, is being over-
run by British and other extraneous fire
insurance offices which grind profits out of
the province with which to pay dividends to
British and other foreign shareholders.
About a dozen years ago there were seven
Maoriland offices doing business in the
country ; they are now reduced to four. One
dropped out through gross and infamous
mismanagement. One, at least, the Union,
was bought up by a foreign competitor ; and
the fate of the third this paper doesn’t at
present remember. Probably the two
smaller of the native survivors, the Standard
and National, will go the same way as the
Union by-and-bye, the baleful eye of the
British purchaser being already fixed on at
least one of them. ' Against these four local
offices there are now ten foreign companies
doing business in Maoriland. For a good
many years past the big English companies,
some of which were large and wealthy before
Australasia was first settled by the white
man, have been steadily buying up or crowd-
ing out the native concerns. Within ten
years fourteen local offices have disappeared
out of Australasia, most of them being swal-
lowed by English competitors. In these
same ten years' the premium income of
the local offices throughout the seven
provinces has declined from £1,800,000
to a little over £1,000,000, and this des-
pite the fact that population has increased
in that period about 25 per cent. All the
new business, and all the old business which
the local offices have lost, has gone to the
ever-increasing foreign competitors, who are
now much more numerous than the local
concerns, and still keep increasing and multi-
plying.
* * * *
The results of this state of things are
various, and all more or less disastrous. In
the first place, the-seven provinces of Aus-
tralasia pay some £200,000 or £250,000 a
year in profits to foreign companies, which
tribute leaves the country to pay dividends
to shareholders in distant parts, and never
by any chance comes back. It gets nothing
whatever in return for this sacrifice. Its in-
surance business would be done quite as well
and as cheaply by local companies, but, in
their case, the dividends would go to local
shareholders, and be expended by them
among local tradespeople, and the country
would be £200,000 or £250,000 a year better
off. The gradual wreckage of the local
offices means a further reduction in the
number of profitable avenues for investment.
The Australian who has money to invest
can’t put it to any great extent into State
securities, for most of them are in Lon-
don. The supply of good bank stocks is
limited, for a vast quantity of them are in
London. Municipal stocks are scarce, for
the best of them are also in Bull-land and
are not locally obtainable. Insurance stocks
are very few, for three-fourths of the local
insurance business is represented by shares
held in London. The same monotonous
remark applies to some of the best mining
stocks, many of the shares and almost all the
debentures of the big pastoral investment
enterprises, and most other things. There-
fore, Australian banks and life-assurance
societies have to bury most of their money
in long mortgages, where it isn’t realisable
when wanted. Further, the fierce compe-
tition of the foreign fire-insurance companies
is disastrous to the insurers. Maoriland
alone now supports fourteen separate sets of
managers, directors, offices, office staffs and
agents when four would be more than suffi-
cient,, and the cost of all these has to be
charged to the insurer. When fourteen
separate agents and all the rest of the
machinery are running after a £lOO risk on
the furniture of a six-roomed wooden cot-
tage, the premium paid on that £lOO has to
cover indirectly the expenses of the thirteen
men who didn’t get the business as well
as those of the one who did. As a
consequence, the expense of doing about
£1,000,000 worth of insurance now is
very little less than that of doing £1,800,000
worth 10 years ago ; the profits are less ; the
dividends are smaller, therefore the share-
holders have less money to spend, and things
generally are unsatisfactory.
* * * *
Two visible ways to stop this particular
leakage are either to tax the foreign com-
panies out of the country and thus diminish
competition, or to throw them out bodily by
Act of Parliament for the same purpose. The.
third alternative is to create a State Fire Insur-
ance Department which may be able to com-
pete with the enemy to better advantage than
local private enterprise can ever hope to do.
And, though tire -business is a decidedly
risky one, the State has so many advan-
tages that the bold experiment proposed
by the Seddon Ministry is well worth
trying. In the first place, the State can
offer better security than the biggest private
co. on earth can attain to, and considering
how many private companies have crumbled
away at different times, in England as well as
elsewhere, leaving their Creditors hopelessly
in the lurch, this in itself amounts to a great
deal. It has got all its machinery ready to hand
without any preliminary expense worth men-
tioning. Postmasters, officials of the State
Life Assurance Department, land-agents, and
other Government employes can be appointed
its representatives. Their office accommo-
dation is already provided ; they can afford
to work at lower rates than private agents in
consideration of the fact that they are already
in receipt of fixed salaries ; they can be
audited without any extra expense by the
State auditors who overhaul their other
accounts and who travel from place to place
cheaply on the long-suffering free-railway-
pass system ; and they are spread over the
length and breadth of the land in every town
and village and hamlet, so that the State
Fire Department would be, from the very
beginning, the most widely-represented affair
in Maoriland. The insurance of State pro-
perty would give the new department a large
and profitable connection to begin with, and
it would probably also command from the
beginning all, or nearly all, the business of
municipal bodies. And in cases of arson and
attempted fraud the department would have
the police and detective forces and the
machinery of the Crown Law offices at its
direct command, so that it would not be likely
to suffer any more in this direction than do
private offices —perhaps not so much. More-
over, it would operate only in its own
country, where it would command the best
business that was going, whereas many of
the private offices extend their operations
into far-distant lands where, in most cases,
they ,get only the dregs. The Australasian
citizen has a holy reverence for British enter-
prise, which in these provinces secures much
of the best business. But Britain and other
foreign countries by no means reciprocate
this feeling, and the Australasian companies
which trade abroad get, as a rule, only risks
of a very inferior character.
* * * *
The State Department would be able to
offer better terms than its private rivals
because, in the first place, its expenses
would be less. The experience of the
Maoriland Life Insurance Department has
already shown that the State can do this
branch of business much more cheaply than
any private concern of its size and age,
and with the same machinery it should be
able to make a similar saving on fire business.
Probably the increased economy effected
by working the two Departments together
would make the saving still greater. The
State would make a further saving through
having no shareholders to claim dividends.
It would invest its reserves mostly in State
securities, and thus do a little more to
make Maoriland independent of the British
money-lender, and every such gain, how-
ever limited, is a movement in the right
direction. It would stop a part, at all events,
of the tribute which goes out of the country
to pay dividends to English shareholders,
and everything which is done in that direc-
tion is so much clear gain. In every possible
way it is a move towards making Maoriland
independent of the foreign capitalist and the
foreign money-grabber. And, though the
Tory publications which whoop vaguely
about the necessity of taking “ large views ”
and “broad, statesmanlike measures” and
other shadowy things which are never clearly
defined, may scoff at it as an attempt to stop
a comparatively small leakage, still the
leakage is steadily growing larger, and even
the smallest kind of leakage is worth stop-
ping, or partially stopping, in a country
whose wealth drains away England-wards
through so many holes, large and small.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Lost Territory.
At latest advices the scheme for handing over the
Northern Territory of S.A. to England, or to a
syndicate, or a chartered co., to be run on
Chinese and nigger-labor principles, is still
alive. It is not at present leading a very
healthy existence, it is true. Joe Chamber-
lain, British Secretary of State for the Colonies
—the renegade with the orchid in his button-
hole —has declined to move in the matter, and
the only hope of the colored-labor party now is
that S.A. will do the fatal act on its own
account. There is no earthly prospect of such
a thing at present, but some day or other a Fat
Man reaction may set in, aud a Ministry of
syndicators and company-promoters may lay
the foundations of a racial war and a nigger-
question in the Territory. Considering these
possibilities, it would be interesting to ascer-
tain, even at this late hour, to whom the out-
cast province really belongs, and who has a
definite right to job it away to any foreign
speculator. Its history is confused and remark-
ably obscure. In the first beginnings of Austra-
lia’s written history N.S. Wales was understood,
in a vague, shadowy fashion, to cover all the
continent from the borders of what is now
Westralia to the east coast, and Tasmania and
Maoriland as well. By degrees, however, this un-
wieldy province dropped to pieces through the
ends being too far away from the central sup-
port. South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania
and Maoriland were one by one established as
separate provinces, and when N.S. Wales
became a completely self-governing province it
consisted only of what is now N.S.W., Queens-
land, and the Northern Territory. About this
period the confused history of the Territory
really begins. The separation of Queensland
cut a large piece out of the centre of the province
and divided it into two widely separated pieces
——N.S. Wales as it now is and the aforesaid
Territory. There was no land communication
between them. Communication by sea meant
a voyage half-way round Australia to
arrive at a place which, in these days,
didn’t seem worth arriving at. And so it
was generally agreed that the separated
half of N.S.W T . was not worth keeping at the
price, and when it fell over the tail-board of
the cart one day no one stopped to pick it up.
The Imperial Government, finding it lying
about loose, lent it to South Australia, and that
province has the loan of it to this day, and so
long as its administration of it is not in any
way a danger or a nuisance to its neighbors it
will probably keep it unquestioned. But if
S.A. ever proposes to sell or lease the Territory
to a foreign syndicate which will have power
to flood the North with cheap alien labor and
alien leprosy, some one may be induced to raise
a question as to the real ownership of that
forlorn dependency. It is alleged, on what
seems to be excellent authority, that there is
no evidence of tiny legal cession of the lerritory
by N.S. W., or any legal resumption of it by
the Imperial Government. It doesn’t seem to
have been severed from the original province
by any recognised legal process as were \ ictoria
and Queensland ; as far as can be ascertained,
it was merely a kind of neglected infant which
got left behind in a careless, accidental fashion,
and was never claimed again. And whether,
according to the written law of the case, the
Territory and its deficiency and its insolvency
and all its other troubles don’t really belong to
N.S.W. to this day seems to be an open
question—at least The Bulletin has failed to
trace any absolutely certain evidence to the
contrary.

Ever since things began to get really bad all
over Australia the windows of heaven have been
opened, and for forty days and forty nights
it has rained good advice, to the effect that the
various Governments should “do something.”
Almost everybody has been, and still is, of
opinion that the Governments should “do some-
thing.” As a recent example, Melbourne
Paunch reports that things in Victoria are in a
truly bad way, and this is to be remedied,
“not by fighting over miserable, pettifogging
Post-office Amendment, Betting Suppression,
Korumburra Subdivision, Women’s Suffrage,
and One-Man-One-Vole Bills, but by some
broad, well-defined schemes of practical legisla-
tion.” Melbourne Argus cordially endorses
this view, only the Argus holds that what is
wanted is a Ministry that will take “ large,
statesmanlike views.” The Argus got this
especial hunk of foolishness off its chest when
the Turner Government proposed to save ,£BOOO
a year of needless expense by doing away with a
wholly useless Melb. railway station, on which
occasion that paper besought- the Cabinet to
cease from worrying over small trifles like this,
and instead to throw itself buoyantly and pro-
miscuously up against the atmosphere of things
and take “large views.” The Argus also asks
it to establish a “ national railway policy,” and
some equally coherent Yarra-bank orators say
that the only thing which will do any good is
for the people to “awake” and “arise.”
Paunch doesn’t even suggest one sample of the
“broad, well-defined schemes” that it wants,
and the Argus doesn’t explain which “ large
view ” the Government should take —they are
merely of opinion that it should “do some-
tiling.” Victoria is a self-governed country ;
the people, by a more or less indirect process,
make the Parliament and the Ministry ; the
Parliament and the Ministry are their servants
paid to carry out their instructions ; and these
instructions apparently are to take “large
views ” and have “well-defined schemes,” and
unfurl their banner generally. The Argus
evidently doesn’t know what its own “ large
views ” are, and Paunch hasn’t the faintest
idea what “broad, well-defined schemes” it
is talking about. These things are only
ragged chunks of eloquence which the two
organs wave round their heads promiscuously.
And for all practical purposes the man who
shows how to remedy one evil, if he only thereby
saves his country £1 per annum, or even 2s. in
a decade, or who makes one banana-skin less
on the pavement, or one smell the less in a
back street, or repairs one old-established rut in
a bush-track, is worth more than all the papers
which call wildly on other people to have
“large views” and “broad, well-defined
schemes of practical legislation ” from now till
the year 3000 or even later.
The Waverley Election.
The Waverley (N.S.W.) election showed no-
thing very clearly, save that there is one more
constituency that doesn’t want Henry Parkes
at any price. Out of 1395 votes the fallen
leviathan scored exactly 160. This should be
a broad enough hint for any man, but even it is
lost on the Grand Old Has-been, who retired
with dignity, announcing his belief that the
country will yet call for him with a loud voice
to come to its rescue. The true state of the
case is that the country has almost forgotten
that Parkes ever existed—it has a short
memory and no cultivated taste for ruins, and,
besides, the old man keeps assuring it that he
doesn’t want “ hoffis,” and it naturally takes
him at his word. Beyond the fact that Waver-
ley didn’t attempt to shove Parkes into the
“ hoffis ” which he is so anxious to avoid, there
was nothing very surprising about the election.
The Foreign-trade vote mustered 698 strong,
against 920 six months ago, and the Protection-
ist vote was 528, against 511 last year. There-
fore, the good cause of Japanese boots is still
ahead, though not nearly so far ahead as it was.
It is only right that it should be ahead ;it
would have been a great pity if anything had
happened to spoil the symmetry of the political
situation just yet. hew South Wales has voted
pretty consistently for Freetrade during 40
years or so, and has never yet got it. It has
lived all these years under a partially-Protec-
tive tariff, which it somehow or other imagined
was Ireetrade, and because it prospered mode-
rately under that tariff it has persistently voted
that I reetrade was a good thing. Now, for the
first time, it has a fair chance of getting what
it has been asking for so persistently, and
it would be a thousand pities if anything hap-
pened to weaken the shoddy majority until the
blessed thing actually arrives. It hasn’t really
come yet, but it is getting here by instalments,
and The Bulletin asks the province to keep on
voting the Calico Jimmy ticket a little longer
till it gets the boon it has so earnestly prayed for.
I he only thing that will cure the N.S.W. Free-
tiade superstition is Freetrade, and the people
who go trying to spoil the show now, just when
it is becoming really interesting for the first
time in 40 years, are an ill-timed, inopportune
crowd, with no sense of humor.
The Westralian Chaos.
The Westralian Government and its officials
lave now plumbed the abyss of their own
rbecility and found it bottondess. Legitimate
*J ust y Province is a stagnant
' lv °ir. It is fed continually by streams of ex-
lirp^eoKus | oa P lfcal l a, nd enterprise, and continually
held back by the huge dam of crusted Tory


prejudice and incapacity which the “ Six
Families ” and their allies so jealously maintain
—grudgingly permitting a little, a very little,
stream to issue from one tape-hinged sluice.
During the past three years, Weslralian mineral
discoveries, or alleged discoveries, have revolu-
tionised pre-existing conditions. The Ministry
and its satellites and servants, able, perhaps,
to muddle the affairs of a municipality, have
been suddenly called upon to direct the
business of a miniature nation, and have
responded by muddling more magnificently
than ever. Rip Van Winkle, wakened from his
sleep in the Catskills, placed on the footplate
of an express locomotive, and told to break the
record to Chicago, could not have cut a more
blinking, ludicrous, stupefied figure than that
of the Westralian Govt, departments, placed,
for the first time in their lives, face to face
with the essentials of progress. Their incom-
petency would be pitiable, were it not so
deadly. The postal and telegraphic ser-
vice is “ like to a chaos, or an unlicked bear-
whelp.” The pile of telegrams in arrear would
freight an Orient liner, and every morning the
sulky officials begin at the bottom of the
accumulation, a fortnight behind, while the
day’s collection is stuck on the top of the file to
wait its turn. The newspapers have been
restricted to so many words ; private
individuals are told “the mail will get there
quicker.” And this is the slow Westralian
mail the slowest on earth ! Meanwhile,
the railway department cannot supply trucks,
and industries are stopped and men thrown out
of employment waiting its convenience ; the
delay in getting a mining lease, a registered
title, is interminable, unless British capital has
stuck to certain palms; everywhere is con-
fusion and mismanagement. The officials
meet objections and complaints with surly
insolence : “ If you don’t like Westralian ways
you had better leave Westralia ” one indignant
Easterner was told. And the heads of the
Govt, are either supine or wish to be ; they
talk, and promise, and never take a broom
within five miles of the Augean stable. There
is only one remedy : the Government must go.
It should have gone last election, but the
diggers were unready and unregistered, and
turned a credulous ear to bribe-laden whispers.
Next time there will be no mistake. The tramp
of the invading army is the knell of Six-Family
domination.
“Socialism in our Time.”
Dear Bulletin, — Re your article on “Socialism
in our Time,” I think there is something to be
Baid on the other side. There are great reasons
for doubting whether this policy of “ support
in return for concessions ” ever did or ever will
benefit Labor. Was the cause of Home Rule
consummated, or even materially advanced, by
the support accorded Mr. Gladstone by the
Home Rule party? The N.S.W. Labor-party
abstained from opposing Reid’s followers on
his fervent declarations that, if returned to
power, he would scotch the Upper House
beyond recognition, and send to that Chamber
such a body of democrats as would make every
respectable hair on the head of an M.L.C. rise in
horror. What is the resultof six months’constant
support ? Why, Reid has pursued a consistent
policy of knuckling under to the Upper House ;
and the band of ardent democrats turned out,
with but one exception, to be “ old timers ”
whom the electors would have none of, and for
whom even Reid felt it necessary to apologise.
This being so, what guarantee has the Q.
Labor-party that Mr. Powers, despite his fair
promises, will act otherwise? And if it supported
him and he tricked it, as men of his class gener-
ally do, what excuse would it have for adhering
to an unwise policy in the face of the same
policy’s failure in New South Wales ? There
is another reason why I think the Q. Labor-
party has acted quite rightly in this matter.
When a party of advanced reform unites with
any capitalist party, it loses its individuality,
its virility, and its independence, which are its
life, the breath of its being; and tends to become
merged with the moderates to its own disadvan-
tage. The only hope for labor in the future is to
retaiu its independence ; as the leader of the
Labor-party said : “ We must recognise only
two parties in politics, Capital and Labor ; the
moment we fraternise with one section of the
party of Capital, be its promises never so
specious, we are lost.” Despite the awful
picture you paint of the probable results of a
continuation of the Boodlewraith’s power, I
think it would not do Labor in politics any
harm. Oppression never did our cause any
harm and never will do. It is more likely to
cause a revulsion of feeling that would increase
the strength of the Labor-party without the
necessity of becoming Powersites. I have but
recently returned from a visit to Queensland,
and, as far as I could gauge it, the feeling of the
Labor section of the public w’as against the
coalition of Labor with any of the old parties
because it was felt no benefit would accrue.
If Mr. Powers were demonstrably sincere in
his promises, the Labor-party would indeed be
fools not to seize the opportunity offered, but
little experience has taught us that these old
politicians are never sincere but wise and tricky
in their day and generation, that support in
return for concessions always means in the end
support without concessions. I believe that
Labor has much more educational work to do
ere it can take the lead in politics, and till
then better to be a virile independent minority
than a number of modified Joe Cooks. — May
Day. _
A Monkey Trick.
An interesting struggle for the baby-soul of a
certain Prince Boris lately happened in Bul-
garia. Baby Boris is, to the best of every-
body’s belief, the son of the local Prince
Ferdinand, by his devout R.C. wife, Princess
Marie, and soon after his appearance in the
royal palace the vigilant R.C. Church enrolled
the unsuspecting infant as a member. In short,
the archbishop, who had been lying dark off the
Weather bow awaiting the little iamily event,
sailed right in with a silver basinful of hol v-
water and sprinkled Boris’s bald head. That
made a Roman Catholic of him, it appears. To
the irreligious mind it doesn’t appear to matter
much what they make of an animated lump
of human fat in the first stage of life.
Boris, up to now, believes in nothing
at all save lacteal fluid from Nature’s font,
as Mr. Micawber expressed it, varied bv an
occasional pull at a gilt-edged feeding-bottle.
If the nurse were to drop Boris out of the
window he would proceed, in the Bulletin’s
opinion, straight to Abraham’s bosom, even
though he had been dedicated to Atheism by
Joe Symes and all the apostles. But the
dogmatic mind takes a different view of the
matter. Also, the political eye of Russia’s
Czar has been glaring at Boris’s baptism re-
provingly, on the ground that an heir to the
Bulgarian throne ought to be a Greek church-
man. The Czar, we are told, worried papa
Ferdinand into promising a conversion of
young Boris —the Lord be with him always !
to the Russian national faith, whereupon
Princess Marie denied her husband conjugal
rights, and “ implored the prayers of the Pope
in her affliction.” Again theirreligiaus mind is at
a loss to understand how weeping Marie’s afflic-
tion could possibly justify itself. If the first
baptism carried any weight with the Almighty,
and was at all beneficial to Boris’s immortal
spirit, the second baptism couldn’t wipe out
the good work, Boris not being a consenting
party in either case. However, the devoted
mother evidently suffered much, and either as
the result of her prayers to Heaven or her peti-
tion to the Pope, the R.C. priesthood swooped
down upon Boris last week and hustled him
into some ancient order of monks. It may have
been a special order made for the occasion.
Anyway, Monk Boris is an accomplished
fact, with the down shaved off the top of
his scalp, and sandals on his tootsies, and
a crucifix dangling against his little tummy.
Therefore, the designs of the Greek Church
upon this early Christian are likely to
come to grief. There is no historic precedent
for deconsecrating a monk who has committed
no sin. The enemy might grease Boris an inch
thick with Greek Church ointment, but he
would still remain subject to the Pope, The
Bulletin imagines ; neither can this calm, un-
prejudiced journal bring itself to protest against
the existing arrangement. The day for expect-
ing religion to adapt itself to the leaching of
common sense is not yet awhile, and, in the
meantime, what’s the odds as long as Boris’s
mother is happy ?

The Walsh. Case (at Ballarat).
Jan. 17th. —First brought under public notice by the
newspaper report of “ a pale, delicate-looking young
woman, who had been arrested, for her own protection,
as she was apparently dying in the street.”
She had been discharged from Ballarat Hospital
that day, after being an inmate for three
months. On the Bench suggesting that she
should return to the institution, she absolutely
refused, alleging that she had been cruelly
treated there. However, after persuasion, she
changed her mind, and the Bench sent her to
the hospital in charge of a constable, who was
instructed to request the authorities “not to
treat her harshly.” Whether this request irri-
tated the hospital people, or whether they had
previously determined not to re-admit her, is
not known, but they refused to take her in,
declaring she was a malingerer.
Jan. 18. —So she was sent to gaol for a week. The
Govt. Medical Officer stated emphatically that the woman
was “ seriously ill.”
Jan. 20. —A leading Ballarat doctor declared her to be
suffering from alcoholic gastritis.
(Which, as she had been in the hospital three
months, sounded peculiar.)
“The doctor of the Colac Hospital wires that the woman
was once an inmate, and undoubtedly a malingerer ; she
was got rid of by a ruse.”
The doctors of the Clunes and Creswick hospi-
tals also wrote to the same effect, stating that
the blood she vomited she first produced by
pricking the back of her throat, and swallowing
the blood. One doctor also stated that he had
performed an operation to find out if there was
anything the matter with her stomach, but it
was found to be perfectly healthy ! ' She was a
pure malingerer.
Jan. 28.—The Benevolent asylum took charge of the
woman. The asylum doctor considered her condition
critical.
After daily bulletins to the effect that she was
in no immediate danger !
Jan. 29. —It was suddenly found necessary to hold a
consultation, and four doctors met to diagnose the case.
It was some days before they would give an opinion ;
then they issued a bald statement to the effect that “ the
woman suffers from disease of the gastric organs.”
As a matter of fact, they at first intended to
pronounce her a humbug, and said so to mem-
bers of the Asylum Committee ; but before
they got out their official verdict the case
developed such alarming symptoms that they
were afraid their report and the notice of the
subject’s funeral might appear simultaneously !
Feb. 6. —Another doctor writes to state that he is
thoroughly acquainted with the woman, and looks on her
as “ a poor, helpless, afflicted creature'seriously ill from
disease of the stomach, probably caused by reflex action
from diseased neighboring organs.”
Feb. 7. —The public are informed that the woman is
dying.
Feb. 11. —The Colac doctors again assert that the
woman is a fraud. As they cut her open to find out, they
ought to know!
Feb. 12. —The woman’s children were brought to her for
her dying blessing, and the last rites of the Catholic
Church were administered.
Feb. 18.—The woman is not dead yet.
The Japanese-boot question has gone through
several interesting phases within the last week.
When it was first reported that a consignment
of Jap. boots had reached Sydney, the Even-
ing News and the Daily Telegraph both rose
up and flatly denied the fact. The latter paper
further stated that not only was there no such
shipment, but there couldn’t be one. There
was only one boot-factory in Japan ; it was a
very small affair, and couldn’t keep pace with
orders from the Court and from a few foreign
residents ; there was no surplus stock to ex-
port, and, in any case, Japan couldn’t sell boots
in Australia, even if it had them to sell, at
prices which could compete with the local
maker. Then, in its issue of Feb. 19, it sang a
different song in a rather different key. There
was a shipment of Japanese boots to Sydney—
it was “ only a little one ” to be sure,
but still it existed, therefore the pre-
vious tale about there being no Jap. boots
for export was evidently an invention.
Further, it acknowledged that the imported
Japanese boots were “25 per cent, cheaper
than the colonial-made article, and a good
many people would not be able to tell the
difference.” And, having thus blown its pre-
vious story to pieces, it went on to prove that
there were no cheap Japanese boots after all:
Did you ever realise that the highest price paid for the
actual labor on the pair of boots is not more than 25., or
thereabouts? Where, then, comes in the difference in
price between the home-made articles and the Japanese ?
Obviously not in cheapness of labor. The only alternative
is in the material put into the boot. I need say no more.
Therefore, the situation is something like this :
The only saving is on labor. Labor represents
2s. per pair in Australia, and not more than
fid. in cheap Japan, so the Jap is Is. 6d.
cheaper. Allowing 3d. per pair, which is
sufficiently liberal, for export charges, the Jap
boot is Is. 3d. a pair cheaper. Therefore it
isn’t any cheaper. And nothing at all is said
about the fact that ss. a pair paid in gold in
Sydney is equal to Bs. or 10s. a pair in the
depreciated silver coinage of Japan, which is
another big handicap in favor of the foreigner.
Meanwhile, the Evening News, at time of
writing, was still denying that there was any
shipment of Japanese boots to Sydney at all,
despite the fact that that allegation had totally
gone bung ; and the S.M. Herald was in the
background endeavoring, as usual, not to com-
mit itself.
Mr. Maxted, N.S. W. Director of Charitable
Institutions, gives Sydney Sunday Times some
details of the paupers under his charge, fed and
lodged by the benevolent tax-payer. Four
samples out of a score :
F.B.,aged74.—Twenty-nine years in Government Ser-
vice, N.S. VV., as C.P.S., in two important districts ; been
in institution three and a-half years ; exemplary charac-
ter ; well educated ; gentlemanly demeanor ; wears own
clothes ; case excites such sympathy that he is allowed to
go in and out at will; pleasant habits; brother a police
magistrate, N.S.W. ;< son, bank manager; another son a
magistrate, and well-to-do ; all decline to support him,
except bank manager, who allows Is. a week; have all
been written to on several occasions ; was compelled to go
into asylum to avoid starvation.
P. D., aged 75.—Fifty-five and a half years in colony;
twosons, postmasters in the Public Service, N.S.W. ; one
daughter, married to postmaster in an important town,
N.S.W. ; all relatives asked to contribute ; one son allows
ss. a week; other replied that when he wanted advice
from Dirhetor of Asylums as to how he should treat his
father he would ask it; daughter declined to contribute ;
head of non-contributing son’s department written to,
and circumstances of case explained, but declined to
interfere.
J.H.E.—Brother is a Civil Servant, and receives £4OO
per year. Has paid nothing.
E. J., 67 years of age.—Twenty-four years a colonist ;
before admission to asylum was stopping at Night Refuge;
son now' retired ; lately manager of an important bank in
N.S. Wales ; refuses to assist her, and stopped paying for
board and lodging to force her into the poorhouse.
Will the Civil Service Board kindly bring pres-
sure on the Police Magistrate, the postmaster
and the postmaster’s wife, and the unspecified
civil servant, and compel them to relieve the
State which pays them salaries from the respon-
sibility of providing for their aged parents ?
There may be no law to do it, but there are
more ways of killing a kangaroo than serenading
it with the Salvation Army. It is right for the
people to provide for the destitute, but not when
their sons and daughters are in receipt of the
people’s money every month. And the Civil
Service Board should either put the screw on
or take the “ screw ” off. As for the bank-
managers, squatters, and others who figure in
Maxted’s black-list, the Government should
advertise their names in the Government
Gazette.
Yic. Assembly last week rejected the Turner
Govt.’s Wages Attachment Bill, which proposed
to stop the attachment by creditors of wages
up to <£3, on lines similar to an Act of the sort
already existing in England. The general idea
is to protect the subsistence of small debtors.
The Bill was opposed by nearly every store-
keeper in the House with the argument that it
would ruin the credit of the majority of the
people in the province and “ prevent the honest
working man from running up a little bill when
sick or disabled ” —the obvious fact that the
honesty of the “honest workingman” is the
real security being very conveniently ignored.
Trenwith pointed out that creditors could
still get fraud-summonses against fraudu-
lent debtors, but Harper declared that no
machinery should be put in the hands of
wage-earners to enable them to repudiate their
debts—that privilege, presumably, being a pre-
rogative of the banks. Higgins went to the
root of the matter by showing that the Bill
would prevent unscrupulous storekeepers from
mopping-up the whole of the wages of men,
who, if given time, would pay anyhow, and
that the threatened restraint of credit would be
wholesome, anyhow. Madden declared that
debtors with <£3 per week would defy their
creditors—but he apparently offered no objec-
tion to the exploitation of unfortunate debtors
by rapacious creditors. Specious arguments
fathered by Fat Man were too much for Vic-
toria, and the Bill was defeated by 34 to 33.
One of the first manifestations of the compara-
tive moral cleanliness resultant on the appoint-
ment in N.S. Wales of an independent board to
control the public service was made last week.
The dictation to the N.S. Wales magistrates by
the Department of so-called Justice has for
years been one of the crying scandals of a
scandal-ridden country. The springs of justice
were polluted at their very source, but the
magistrates being, as a consequence of their
utterly dependent position, as clay in the hands
of the political potter, no man among them had
the courage to tell the Department to go to the
devil. At last the change has come, or is
coming. Last week, the Bench of Stipendiaries
held-a meeting to consider a circular referring
to the late diseased-meat cases ; and “a resolu-
tion was carried unanimously that a reply be
sent to the Minister insisting on their
right to decide the cases on the evi-
dence.” Unfortunately for their own credit,
the magistrates have for years submitted
to being brow-beaten by the Department
of Justice without protest—as witness the
iniquitous flogging circular, and the directions
to inflict imprisonment for breaches of the
Betting Act. The natural inference is that
they had not sufficient nerve and integrity of
principle to kick while they were under poli-
tical control; but as soon as they are out of the
Department’s clutches, and responsible only to
the Civil Service Board, they gave the Minister
a well-deserved snub —which The Bulletin
hopes will be the first of a long series of
similar insults to the club “ push ” who have so
long run the Department. Here Tiie Bulletin
takes occasion to remind certain of the Sydney
S.M’s that the Civil Service Board cannot be
toadied to as were the old authorities, and that,
therefore, it will be well for them to refrain
from giving the Board occasion to measure up
their shortcomings—bibulous and financial.
A small, obscure row now going on in Victoria
over the proposed Glenrowan-Hedi railway is
interesting m a way, as casting some light on
the results of a vigorous borrowing policy.
This little line, it is generally admitted, is
much wanted, but as the estimated revenue is
only about <£6oo a year over the estimated
expenses, the standing committee sorrowfully
rejected it. The borrowed money now on hand
has cost about 3§ per cent., and unless a pro-
posed new railway can pay that amount it lias
to be thrown out. As there are no rail-
ways left to be built in Victoria which
seem likely to pay anything like the needful
percentage for a long, long time, the
throwing out process is repeated almost every
time a new line is suggested—in fact, the Rail-
way Commii tee now exists for the purpose of
decisively throwing out almost everything.
Therefore Victoria is broughtup against the dead
wall of three alternatives. One is to stop railway
building, and as almost all the lines built in the
past were crowded together in the centre of the
province, while the east and west were unpro-
vided for, this means that about half the pro-
vince must remain indefinitely a neglected
wilderness. The second alternative is to go on
borrowing money at 3J per cent, and building
railways which only yield 1 per cent, till the
province bursts. The third is to raise more
money by more taxation, or by State monopo-
lies, or by some other means, and build
tlie Gippsland and Wimmera lines out of
revenue, and let the 1 per cent, profit, or what-
ever it amounts to, be a clear gain to the Trea-
sury. Even in the thickly-peopled regions of
Europe and America there are very few lines
nowadays which pay 3J per cent, on their cost,
and now that Australia has made most of its
good lines, and the ones left to make are affairs
that won’t, as a rule, pay over 1J per cent, for
many years to come, and as money can’t be
borrowed at 1| per cent, anywhere, the old
policy is practically played out. But there are
2000 miles of railway still to be built in New
South Wales and Victoria that will yield a
small profit now, and a much larger one later
on, if any Government feels inclined to attempt
the work on a new basis.
“No Australian lawyer,” said a Sydney stipen-
diary the other day, “advocates punishment
for attempts at suicide on the ground that the
individual actually intended to take away his
life. The basis of the statute lies deeper in
human nature. Most attempts at suicide,
notably among young females, are not intended
to be successful; they are merely ebullitions of
vexation or bravado whose object is to stun or
appal some interested person or persons. Will
any sound reasoner say that Law should pro-
vide no punishment for these? It is also
morally certain that a large percentage of suc-
cessful attempts result from accident. Of
course it is impossible,” the stipendiary
warmly proceeded, “to discriminate with
mathematical exactness in moral questions,
but when a person charged with attempt
at suicide comes before a magistrate, that
official* is expected to exercise discretion.
If the accused seem mad, he sends him for
observation; if he have yielded to impulse,
just as one might yield to a sudden assault on
another, or if the result be traceable to a fit of
pique or vexation, a punishment suiting the
various conditions is imposed. The magistrate
may sometimes be a ninny ; but does anyone
who knows human nature think that such at-
tempts should go unpunished ? Again, suppose
the law on this subject repealed : Would not
attempt at suicide be the favorite resort ot the
hysterical, the distressed, and the cunning
advertisers of their private injuries ? ”
New South Wales Chief-Justice Darley and
Justices Innes, Simpson, and, for a few minutes,
Cohen, at the opening of term last week dis-
ported themselves according to custom in
scarlet, ermine, and full-bottomed wigs. The
spectacle provoked an occupant of the gallery
to call up the petition presented by a weary
public to Oliver Cromwell in the old dictator
days, which petition prayed that the Judges
who then went circuit in their scarlet should
no longer be allowed to “ affright the country
with their blood-red robes and their state and
pomp.” The strong minds on the judicial
Bench have been the least addicted to law-court
George Rignoldism. Baron Pollock tells how
Lord Campbell, when at the Bar, likened the
array of judges in scarlet on opening of term to
the scene in “ Othello,” where a parcel of
carpenters and scene-shifters are dressed up to
come on as the senators of Venice. The smaller-
headed the man on the Bench, the more
zealously throughout British history has he
cultivated the externals of his office. British
judges, whose manners Australians take as
models, began the judicial career in ordinary
attire, as ecclesiastics also began. But year by
year, or epoch by epoch, they added a garment
or a color, until a judge at the opening
of term looks a cross between an insanely-
overdressed policeman’s wife and the harlequin
of a pantomime.
Germany’s determination to get Holland
is the explanation of many things.
Judge Docker did one good service the
other day, at Bathurst (N.S.W.), when he sat
heavily on the police for not informing a prisoner
of the absence of a material witness subpoenaed
for the defence. The police round up- the Crown
witnesses most carefully, and, if one of them
insists on being absent, he gets a bad time.
The prisoner, being in gaol, can’t round up his
witnesses ; if he has no money, he can’t pay some-
one dlse to do it; and the police won’t do it—they
generally won’t even tell him whether his wit-
nesses have turned up or not. Also, when the
prisoner’s witnesses don’t turn up, the Court, as a
rule, doesn’t fall on them with anything like the
vigor it manifests when falling on the person who
didn’t turn up \o swear on the other side of the
case.

Westmacott’s new drama, the “Enemy’s
Camp,” at Sydney Royal, is a garish, painted howl
in many, many acts; also it is an honest, de-
serving howl which does all that mortal can do in
its particular line to command success. The
scenery all through is super-excellent; the co. is a
good one ; and a large sensation is turned on every
five minutes, and sometimes oftener. And in
addition to these recommendations the “Enemy’s
Camp ” is not more hopelessly improbable than
the average, and it is a good deal less improbable
than many things the present writer has seen in
cold print on a tombstone. There is an insur-
rection in it, a desperate fight around a burning
railway-station, a blazing city that flames like
Sodoin and Gomorrah when they wereover-insured,
and a rope-bridge, which Plimmer cuts with a
sword while Scot Inglis is standing on it, where-
fore the latter falls into an abyss with both hands
full of broken bridge, and a girder on his head.
Further, there is an entirely new sensation,
wherein Scot Inglis, being a prisoner with both
hands chained behind him, keeps up his end of a
desperate encounter by means of a knife which
he holds between his teeth, and bobs his enemy
with his head till the foe is laid out. The foe
revives and rushes him again, but tnis time the
desperate captive boots him in the stomach, and
gives him indigestion for life. This is a rather
new mode of combat, but possibly it would be
even more realistic if the prisoner bit his enemy in
the second round. A military execution, and a
duel with swords between Misses Harrie Ireland
and Fitzmaurice Gill, and a soared clergyman who
falls into a drain, are some more features of this
lavish drama.
* * * *
When Miss Harrie Ireland isn’t duelling
she spends most of her time languishing in a white
dress on a bed of straw in a dungeon, and escaping
through a hole in the wall, and being recaptured
and dragged back again by her brutal gaolers.
Miss Ireland doesn’t go back willingly, therefore
her captors seize her by her snow-white arms and
trail her over mountain peaks and across rocky
chasms on her return journey. She languishes on
the straw very artistically and has her food thrown
at her head by the principal ruffian in charge.
Scot Inglis, as the hero, is about half the drama,
and the remainder is mostly Plimmer, Sweeney,
and Miss Ireland. Plimmer is the person who
locks up Miss Ireland in the dungeon, and mur-
ders Miss Gill with a gory knife, and sools on the
ruffian who is booted on the stomach in the cellar,
and who conducts the execution and want 3 to
smack the dead body afterwards, but is prevented.
However, he tells the dead body what a fool and
a dunder-headed ass it was, and explains to it
that he is the person who stole its lost daughter,
and that the daughter isn’t of much account, any-
how, and he intends to throw her out, and the
dead body makes a note of these things and gets
square with him afterwards. All these people,
including the dead body, do their work remark-
ably well, and a lot of other people and an able
mechanist back them up in a capable fashion.
Taking it all round it is a satisfactory drama, and
the only thing The Bulletin regrets is that
Plimmer doesn’t really smack the body, whose
language under such circumstances should be
worth hearing.

“Gondoliers” started a brief dazzle at
Sydney Lyceum on Saturday, the gloomy “ Yeo-
men of the Guard ” having retired to moan in its
appropriate cave till further orders, and pour
ashes on its head and weep. The new edition of
the Venetian opera is one of the brightest yet
seen in Sydney, and though the piece is now past
its first youth it ought, as done by the present co.,
to be good for much longer than the four nights
allotted to it. Brownlow and Courtice Pounds
make the best two-headed king shown at the
Lyoeum up to date. The new man, when he lets
himself go, is as good a dancer as the adored
Ryley ever was, and is a better actor than that
vanished deity, and when he runs on little errands
for the Minister of State his agility is simply
appalling. Brownlow also comes out unexpectedly
as a dancer of much ability, and when the two
kings break loose together they are the wildest
pair that ever wore the crown of Barataria.
Sydney Dean has improved somewhat of
late (though he does not make convincing
love to Florence Young) and seems to have at last
become somewhat acquainted with his own legs ;
and those ever-reliable people—Lauri, Vernon,
Mrs. Bracy, and Misses Florence Young and
Nina Osborne--shine as of yore. Miss Graupner
acts better, and looks better, than she did, but on
further acquaintance with her singing-voice it
appears to The Bulletin that that organ is still in
a badly-enfeebled state. By the time these few
remarks get into print the “ Gondoliers ” will have
retired to make room for “Nitouche,” wher in
the convent organist will get drunk and have his
hair cut for two nights only. On Saturday “Ma
Mie Rosette ” and the Living Pictures start a
week’s business, and the bad King is getting his
persuasive voice in order to lead May Pollard
astray when she dreams that she arrives with the
milk.
The management of Her Majesty’s intends
trying its luck on Saturday with “Monte
Christo.” This paper doubts if there is at present
any demand for the gorgeous hero who was im-
prisoned for 19 years in a dungeon, and then put
into a bag along with a large rock and cast into
the sea, from which he roue again to wreak an
awful vengeance on his enemies. Still it may
prove that he is the very person the public is
craving for. Anyhow, Dumpier is to be cast into
the moaning deep on “a scale of unparalleled ex-
cellence,” and will afterwards emerge and climb
on to a dripping rock with a completeness of detail
never before witnessed, or some tiling to the same
effect.

A new comedy, entitled “Wanted, a
Wife,” is to be staged on Saturday at Sydney
Criterion. It is expected to throw some more
light on the reasons why a man should undertake
to find board, lodging and clothes for another
man’s daughter, in return for getting his latch-
key confiscated and being ordered to get up early
and chop the wood for the kitchen fire.

The Sydney Music Hall closed on Saturday
night for a brief rest, and when it re-opens the
management proposes to go in for drama. The
Hall is a small establishment; and the amount of
drama which could be put in a place of that size
is strictly limited, and for horse-race or tank or
military spectacle purposes it looks practically
hopeless. Meanwhile, the Cogills have started
business at the Opera House, in order to keep up
the legend that Sydney can’t get through without
two variety shows, and are giving a large, healthy
entertainment on the usual lines. At the Tivoli,
Coleman, Alice Leamar, the Ivanoff Brothers and
La Belle Maie, serpentine dancer and slack-wire
performer, are all raging simultaneously, and the
Rickards boom is, if possible, more violent than
ever. Also, a small, casual entertainment is run-
ning at the Guild Hall, once the forlorn Gaiety ;
and the Jerusalem Cyclorama is going strong with
the Star of Bethlehem turned on every evening at
eight.
Mrs. Harry Marshall, whose por-
trait appears in this issue, is one of the
many attractive daughters of Mr. Jas.
Thynne, the well-known Australian
actor an:l manager. Mr. Thynne is
now a member of the N.S.W. civil-ser-
vice, and has long since quitted the
thorny path at the back of the foot-
lights, but his name is still well-remem-
bered in theatrical circles. Mrs. Mar-
shall was born 22 years ago at Murrum-
burrah (N.S.W.), out beyond Goulburn,
in that peaceful region where nomen-
clature grows to abnormal dimensions,
and such places as Wallendbeen and
Cootamundra and Cumbamarrah and
Mullengandra and Gurrangoorang
(which is close to Korkbitoo) are things
of quite common occurrence. Her
first appearance on the stage was made
after her marriage with that clever
comedian, Harry Marshall, and her
success is entirely owing to his tuition.
Mrs. Marshall’s stage career so far has
been comparatively brief, and has been
principally in Queensland, her most
notable record being a three-weeks
season as Polly Eceles at Rockhampton.
Anyone who knows that forlorn town
on the muddy river, where the inhabi-
tants are too weary to live and too ex-
hausted to die, will understand that it
requires more than o; dinary ability to
run anything there for one consecutive
week, let alone three. Mrs. Marshall
is now joint lessee with Mr. Alfred
Woods at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and
the shilling part of the house in par-
ticular has fallen in love with her as
one man for her performance of Dolly
in “To the West.” Owing to the
deficiencies of the Australian language
the programme is reduced to describing the firm as
“Messrs. Woods and Marshall.” This has created
an impression that Mrs. Marshall is a man —which
she isn’t.

The Rickards Touring Co. started its
career at Brisbane on Feb. 22. The co., which is
50 strong, drafted from Sydney Tivoli and Melb.
Opera House, will work down through N.S.W.
and Victoria after exploiting Bananaland. Rickards
hopes to have it on tour, reconstructed from time
to time, as long as his managerial banner waves.

“Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith” is much
sought after at Melbourne Princess’s, especially
by young women who stand trembling on the
brink of matrimony’s seething, choked-up pit.
These go joyfully into the theatre, attended by
Adolphus, and about three hours later they come
forth in a thoughtful mood which lasts fully ten
minutes. “ Mrs. Ebbsmith ” attempts to teach
too many things. It advises the young idea
against marriage, rails against the hollowness of
platoni; fri ndship between the sexes, and snorts
at the sin of unlegalised love. “ Would you have
every man with hi 3 head shaved, and every
woman in a cloister —carrying out to the full the
ascetic principle?” asks Thackeray’s Pendennis
of his friend Warrington. “ Would you have
conventicle hymns twanging from every lan
in every city in the world ? Would you have
all the birds of the forest sing one note
and fly with one feather?’ Pinero interjects
“ Why, certainly ! ” At the finish all his principal
characters, with the honorable exception of Duke
Boucicault, sing one note. Mrs. Ebbsmith regrets
her brief burst of passion for Lucas Cleeve, who is
sorry that he brought it about. Mrs. Oleeye
curses herself for having asked the penitent to
backslide, and the Rev. Amos and Ins sistei,
having been good all the time, beam upon the
pious misery of their disciples. Rev. Amos is the
best pleasure that earth can afford to Mrs. Itbo-
smith, as far as one is able to comprehend Pinero s
meaning. He mustn’t marry her, or be her intel-
lectual chum, or kiss her slyly in the vestry.
Nevertheless, he’s the hero of her Hour when the
curtain falls.
* * * *
Duke Boucicault is the one healthy-minded
person in this crank play. Amos’s sister reckons
him up as “ a rather bad man,” and such a testi-
monial from such a lady does him great credit.
When Boucicault meets the pretty widow he im-
mediately hopes to improve the shining hour by
discussing Shakespeare and the musical glasses
with her at her lodgings at 4 p.m. next day. She
is an independent charmer, living on the pro-
perty of a late beast of a husband. A flirtation
with a clever, gentlemanly, gouty old peer would
be just the thing for her. But, because she fea,rs
that his Nibs wouldn’t approach her in a mis-
sionary spirit, the narrow-minded woman tries to
make him feel ashamed of himself. Happily,
she doesn’t succeed. A duke who knows
his own mind thoroughly never feels called
upon to blush for it. Dion Boucicaults
performance gathers artistic moss as it
rolls along, and Mrs. Brough improves somewhat.
But her delivery of such lines as “ One day father
turned a deaf ear to mother, and put his face to
the wall and died,” is quite insincere ; her high
notes are forced ; and an old tendency to cry
“ O-o-o-oh ! ” seems to be growing upon her. Cecil

Ward, on the other hand, prefers to suck in his
breath and say “A-a-a-ah!” This way of ex-
pressing feelings begins to annoy The Bulletin.
Some years back Mr. Ward was content to sigh
without an “ A-a-a-ah ; ” and if he must blow off
steam, or burst, this paper would prefer him to
return to his original practice.

Charles Godfrey’s throat is suffering from

Five hundred sixpences were refused at
the gallery-doors of Mdb. Alexandra on Saturday
night. Ihe bill had been changed to “Ten Nights
in a Bar-room, and every tune that lurid sermon
on the strong drink question is offered to the
multitude at popular prices, the multitude makes
arrangements to be there. Nobody can explain
why the average decent sort of citizen should want
to have a simple moral lesson rubbed into him
again and again, so the chances are that he doesn’t
want anything of the kind. He is attractedby
the opportunity to gaze upon a large assortment

The effects of liquor are pretty lively, anyway
which is more than can be said for the results of
total abstinence. Whilst Augustus Clover Dan
Srdkma is’fufl of h f r d f ink to excess
the drama is full of stirring incidents. If one
dipsomaniac heaves a tumbler at another, it misses
its mark and kills a child. Something of a horrible
nature is always happening. But when the Wes-
leyan gentleman has converted the whole cast,
and nobody smites his neighbor with a bottle:
when Coupeau has signed the pledge, and the low
comedian has renounced his thirst for ever, “ Ten
Nights in a Bar-room ” lags superfluous on the
stage. It is only kept going by beer and blood.

Melb. Royal re-opens on Saturday, under
the management of the “ Land of the Moa Drama-

is one of many dramatic treats in store.

Of contemporary lyric lady-stars, only four are
Britishers, says a London weekly. Then the writer
gives the names of the “British” quartette—Madame*
Melba, Albani, Frances Saville, and Alva. Two Aus-
tralians, one Canadian, and—what country did Alva spring
from ?
Ada Crossley got her first lessons in voice-production
from a surveyor’s wife in S. Oippsland. When a mere
child she would ride along the hush roads for miles to her
teacher’s solitary cottage among the scrub and sand-hills
adjacent to Port Albert. In Dec., ’B4, she made her first
appearance in public at the Port Albert Mechanics’ Insti-
tute, when she sang “ Wait till the clouds roll by.” During
the next year or so her services were much sought after
at bush concerts. Her favorite songs at this time were
“ When the leaves begin to turn,” “ Daddy,” and “ We’ll
sell the old grey mare.”
R. S. Smythe writes“ I never thought of engaging
Rudyard Kipling as a lecturer. Four years ago, in
London, A. Patchett Martin suggested him to me, but
without knowing whether he could lecture. When I met
Kipling afterwards, at the Yorick Club in Melbourne, I
didn’t think he could. Every year, both from England
and America, I receive dozens of applications from people
who, as lecturers, wouldn’t draw the rent of a hall. Of
all the celebrities I have run during the Jast 20 years, only
the Rev. Charles Clark stood in the front rank as a plat-
form orator ; he was the first, and he was the best. The
last man suggested tome is Jameson, who would probably
turn out to be a Bore.”
Maud Hobson supplied her own cerulean tint to that
specially naughty line in “In Town.” “Shrimp, if the
dark gentleman calls for me at the stage door—you know,
the dark gentleman, not the fair one—tell him my hus-
band has returned unexpectedly, and I’ll have to go home
to-night." In the prompt-book, the excuse for putting
off the dark gent was quite innocent. A sick mother, or
something of that sort. The husband was purely a Hob-
sonesque idea.
Gee, a one-time popular Melb. baritone, has been sing-
ing at the London halls. At the Palace he was pro-
grammed under the name of Gresham, so as not to injure
bis concert prospects. He is only following in Sims
Reeves’s footsteps. Sims received £2OO for three appear-
ances at the Empire.
Arthur Greenaway, spoken of by S. African papers as
“The Australian Romeo,” was amongst the first who
volunteered for service with the Uitlan lers in Johannes-
burg, where he intimated in a ringing voice, clearly
audible to the reporters, that he was prepared to shed his
last drop of blood in protection of the women and
children ; which, as the Boers are notoriously humane,
does not imply that the fair young A.G. is in any danger
of bleeding to death.
Eversfield, whose suicide is cabled, was the original of
Boucicault’s part in “ The Magistrate.”
Santley’s violent antipathy to the tremolo in singing is
partly a matter of business. All English singing-teachers
are jealous of Shakespeare, a tremolo baritone who gets
more pupils and fatter fees than any of them.
“ In some of the American theatres a proper vengeance
has fallen upon females with high and vast hats, who are
required to sit all on one side by themselves.”
Bland Holt has bought the Australian rights of “One
of the Best.” The great scene now raising the Adelphi
audiences to enthusiasm is a reproduction of the degrada-
tion of Captain Dreyfus, the French spy. The part,
played by William Terriss, will, The Bulletin hears from
London, just suit W. E. Baker.
“ Now that women put on pants, the stage insists on

Rickards combine to quash Geo. Adams in the variety

Mrs. Gown Trotter and the Beauteous Bellew are booked
for another Australian tour, commencing after “Trilby”
has ceased to thrill.
Boil up “The Scarlet Letter,” of Hawthorne, and
“ Judah ” and you will (says The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent) get the essence of Henry Arthur Jones’s much-
talked-of new play, “ Michael and His Lost Angel.”
Given a very high church parson (or “priest” as those
gentry prefer to call themselves) who is morality itself,
and who, on one occasion, publicly reproved a young lady
who had been led from the Path of Virtue by a Villain,
yet who himself becomes the victim of a married woman,
and you have Forbes Robertson at the Lyceum. By and
by, conscience smites him, and he determines to do
penance publicly in full face of the congregation who have
so long worshipped him as the very acme of goodness and
virtue. Finally you'find him, after soothing the death-
bed of his fellow sinner, trying to work out salvation as a
monk in a R.C. monastery. Jones is nothing if not bold,
and few dramatists would have had the daring to deal
with such a subject a second time as he has done in this
play and “ Judah.” Marion Tree is uncommonly good as
the grass widow to whose wiles the ascetic Robertson
falls a victim, whilst Forbes is admirably suited to the
part of the man who cannot resist temptation. No
actor on the stage to-day could look or act the part
better, and he wears the priestly garb like a professional
sky-pilot. It is a moot question whether the public will
flock in their thousands to see this semi-religious play as
they do to “ The Sign of the Cross,” but it is bound, for a
time at least, to be a succPx de curio site, especially as the
papers have begun interviewing the clergy as to their
ideas of having such a subject treated on the stage.
Amongst others Dr. Parker, of the City Temple, gives his
approval, saying he is not one of those who hold that
religious services should never be presented on the stage,
quoting the church scene in “Much Ado about Nothing”
at the Lyceum ; but he adds the reservation that they
must be done well. Archdeacon Sinclair, who is a leader
of women, has also given his ideas on this subject, but he
is distinctly of opinion that Jones has in this instance
“exceeded the bounds of good taste and discretion”;

which, whilst it expresses disapproval on his part, makes
a very good advertisement.
It seems as if religious plays are going to have a boom,
vvuson Barrett having made a hit with “ The Sign
of the Cross both in London and the provinces (writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent). Crowds are
turned away nightly, and clergymen, actuated, no doubt,
by free stalls, give big ads. of the play from their pulpits.
Barrett is cute. There is now a great opportunity for
Joseph in Canaan,” the play Rignold lately produced ill
bydney. The title will not alone comm n 1 itself to
the flighty, but is bound to draw the Church as well.
Again, Rignold is not your ordinary giddy mummer—
he has always had the reputation of being a perfect
Joseph in private life, and it will be a treat to see his
virtue displayed coram populo.
A lady writes from London to a Bulletin man re H. A.
Joness new play' at the Lyceum : “Mrs. Pat Campbell
had thrown up her part, and it was picked up by Marion
Terry. A more dismal play was never seen. Unless they
cut out three-quarters of it it can’t last a week. They
say Forbes Robertson bought Jones’s play before it was
done, and was obliged to act it. Anything duller,
doggier, can t be imagined—worse than a sermon in
church, and it lasted 3) hours. They'all preached and
preached from beginning to end, and prayed and sinned
alternately. K say's Jones looked ghastly when
they called on * author ’ at the end. Two clergymen, a
secretary (also religious), and a monk have most of the
talk. The wicked lady is very tame, and also talks about
her soul and moralises. The Ly'ceum has seldom per-
haps never witnessed such a fiasco. The papers are all
more or less kind to the play 7; perhaps, like me, they
were all more or less grateful it came to an end at last.”
Phil May’s monthly at-homes at his Kensington studio
are usually crowded (writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent), and there y'ou may meet a great many artis-
tic and literary 7 lights. His last gathering was a specially
representative one. AdaCrossley was there ; she charmed
everyone by her singing and met with a great reception.
She has made much headway in the last month or two,
and as Harrison, Patti’s man, seems to have taken her in
hand she may y 7 et realise to the full the great expectations
of her Australian friends. Phil May is full of work and
the resultant shekels. His income must now be princely',
but he has to work hard, though he stands alone in his
line.
Mrs. Brough’s fondness for flopping on the (assumed)
red-hot stove in “ Mrs. Ebbsmith ” and escaping scorched
arm is not an oversight on her part. The book contains
specific instructions for her to do what she does, and as
“Mrs. Pat.” in Hingland and Julia Neilson in ’Murka do
the same, the fault must be attributed to Pinero, though
one would expect such a scrupulous stage-manager as
Boucicault to run the risk of the author’s wrath in altering
the stage directions.
Has this anything to do with Dot Boueicault’s projected
departure for Hingland in June? Ascribe in the Gentle-
woman writes : —“ With the roses of June a wondrous new
song-bird is to fly into our midst. . . . Several friends
of mine . . . assure me that since Patti’s no such
voice has been known. And the name, you ask, of the
young Diva ? It is Boucicault. Well, Miss Boucicault,
then, is a niece of the great Dion himself, and, apart from
her wondrous voice, is endowed with dramatic talent of a
high order. And her age, again, you ask? Just twenty.
. . . As at present arranged, Miss Boucicault will sing
first abroad, and in June at Covent Garden, under the
management of Sir Augustus Harris.”
The last week of “ Djin-Djin ” was the biggest ever

RICHARDS.— February 22, suddenly, John Henry
Richards, late of the Theatre Royal, aged 38, leaving a
wife and three children to mourn their loss.
The curtain rose 12 years ago,
And introduced a mate so true,
A comrade true you proved to be,
A comrade true you’d always be. (!)
In this world of toil you’ve had y'ou’re share ;
We pray that in your next you may know no care ;
And as the scene changed with you yesterday,
May you have found them lit, as Clear as day. (!)
And as you rest, on your Angel Throne,
May we all some day greet you at home. (!!)
We mourn your loss, ’twas thus to be ;
The act drops down. Au revoir, Dickie.
The wish of his comrades,
By Bob Fullarton.
Heaven shield our ashes from the sympathetic friend !
Henry Arthur Jones’s new play, “ Michael and his Lost
Angel,” was produced simultaneously in London and New
York. As Jones could not attend rehears ds at the latter
place, he spoke the whole play into the phonograph and
sent it over in the shape of eight cylinders.
Ada Crossley, The Bulletin hears, left Santley’s tuition
at Melba’s request, “ and Melba has much more influence

was the original Burgomaster’s >vife in “ The Bells,” also
Queen-mother to the great man’s Hamlet, and many
another useful character. Arthur Swanborough, of the
old Strand Theatre, went under in Xmas week. Arthur
served as business-manager for his mother all through the
best times of Strand burlesque, from the era of Marie

The Citizens’Life Assurance Co., for the first
time since The Bi lletin' made its acquaintance, looks
a little better than it did. The income of the indus-
trial branch for ’95 was £133,404 against £127,000 in ’94,
and of this it saved and added to its funds £10,503 (£7790
from interest and rents and just £2713 out of a gorgeous
premium income of £125,000), making the whole accumu-
lation £172,949. Last year it saved £10,059 out of an in-
come of £127,' 00, so in this respect there is no improve-
ment worth mentioning. The point where the advantage
comes in is that, while the co. collected £133,404 and
spent out of it £122,901, a little less went in expenses and
a good deal more in payments to policy-holders than
usual. The expenses, including dividend to shareholders,
were only £71,766, so that out of every shilling paid by
the humble policy-holder the co. spent barely' sevenpence
in ex’s., which is sufficiently dreadful, whereas it formerly
spent more than ejghtpenee. Also, it paid £51,000 to
policy-holders against £32,000 last year, so that there is a
decided improvement in the present and room for a
lot more in the future. The assets of the indus-
trial branch y'ield over £4 13s. per cent, all round, and out
of £7790 interest, only £723 - a good deal less than last
year—is returned as being in arrear. Whether the co.’s
freehold property, which was written up by £24,000 in
’9l is worth, at present prices, anything' like the £69,891
set against it, is an open question, and this is an asset to
be viewed in an enquiring spirit.
One acknowledgment made in the report
re the industrial branch is staggering. It is to the
effect that no liability' has been provided for in the
case of a number of policies “ which have only been in
existence a few months.” As the co.’s liability begins the
instant it issues a policy, this cheerful way of making no
provision in certain cases is highly interesting. At the
1891 investigation it was announced that “ policies for
the whole term of: life of less than three years’ duration
and endowment assurances under one year’s duration
were assumed to have no liability' attaching,” and in re-
gard to this practice it is only' necessary' to say that any'
kind of an office could make its accounts square by
assuming that a vast number of its policies have “no
liability attaching.” The Daily Telegraph estimates
that, on the present occasion, policies insuring £1,163,160
have been “ assumed ” to carry no liabi ity—anyhow the
whole of the co’s liability is set down at just a little over
one year’s premium income, which looks sufficiently
astonishing'. How would the figures have come out if the
Citizens’ hadn’t “ assumed ” so much ?
The Citizens’ ordinary life business shows a
premium income of £40,819, against £28,692 in ’94, which
is a truly handsome increase. Its total income is 144,089,
and out of this it saved and added to its funds over
£26,000. The expenses (16613) are only 16 per cent, of
the premiums or 15 per cent, of the total income. Thoug'h
the two concerns are run together, the ordinary bran, h
makes £4 19s. percent, on its investments, while the in-
dustrial gets only £4 13s. The ordinary branch isn’t
charged with any part of the £2OOO for shareholders’
dividend, nor with any of the depreciation of office furni-
ture, nor with any actuarial expenses, travelling expenses,
exchange or Government taxes. Also, the industrial
branch pays £5367 of the advertising bill, and the
ordinary branch only t 75, while the other charges are
mostly stood by the industrial department in much the
same fashion. Therefore, the ordinary life assurance
branch is one of the most cheaply managed offices in
Australia, while, to all appearance, it would be
nothing of the kind if a great part of its legitimate
charges weren’t borne by the industrial. One in-
teresting feature is that the ordinary department has
£5320 invested in the co.’s freehold property while
the industrial department has £64,571, and 'as the
ordinary makes so much better a return on its invest-
ments than the other, one possible inference is that the
office property isn’t a paying asset, and that the concern
which holds the smaller end. of that unprofitable asset
comes off best in consequence. Anyhow, the ordinary
insurers have just received a very handsome bonus, and
probably they don't care whether their department booms
partly at the ex'pense of the 3d.-a-week branch or not.
One much-needed improvement about the Citi-
zens’ Co. is that Manager Jimmy Garvan shouldn't fill
seven columns of the daily papers with his annual disser-
tation about everything. This time he held forth for
several weary hours about the silver question, the Vene-
zuelan question, Federation, the ratio of gold to silver,
gold production, silver production, the Chow-Jap disturb-
ance, and everything else under the sun. Presumably the
daily papers are paid advertising rates for the insertion
of Mr. Garvan’s oration in full, and if so, and if the
bill is charged to the insurance co., it is very rough on
the co.

The Flood estate trouble is on again. Some
years ago the National Building, Land and Investment
Co. (Sydney) bought a large piece of land at Leichhardt
for £10,600. It paid £3833 and owed the rest. Then it
cut up the property and re-sold at a profit to a lot of
harmless, unsuspecting workpeople, who never asked if
the co. had a title. The co. co.lected the instalments
from these people, and instead of paying off the mortgage
with them it used them in some other way. Now some of
the buyers have paid up in full and can’t get a title. Others
have paid up in part. Almost all have spent their life’s
savings, or most of them, in building cottages on their
allotments. And now the original owners of the land
propose to sell the property under their unsatisfied
mortgage, and if it is sold the instalments which these
poor workpeople have paid, and probably their houses as
well, will all be lost, and most of them will be utterly
ruined.
The National B. L. and I. Co. knew when it
sold the land that it would be called on to supply titles
when the buyers had paid up, and as it never, even in the
good times when money was tolerably plentiful, seems to
have paid a copper off its own mortgage out of the money
it collected from its buyers, it seems fair to assume that
the co. didn’t care what became of the luckless buyers.
So far as The Bulletin knows, there is nothing illegal
about its proceedings, but there certainly ought to be.
The people who sell a valueless agreement to deliver a
quarter-acre of land, and take money' for it, should come
into the same category as the man who sells a valueless
cheque or anything else of the same kind. The difference
between the two circumstances, so far as the people who
suffer by the proceeding are concerned, is practically nil,
but if anything the company dodge is the more heartless
of the two.

A Melbourne paper openly declares that one of
the auditors of a hopelessly-bung Melbourne bank was a
large shareholder in that institution, but sold out gradu-
ally between 1890 and 1894. If this is true, then the
position of an auditor who certifies to balance-sheets which
show, or tend to show, that the concern is solvent, while
he is, himself, gradually getting out of the crumbling in-
stitution, is just a little delicate.

The statement that the Q.N. Bank directors

Hudson Brothers, Limited, a big N.S.W. con-
cern with £173,000 of paid-up capital, and 10s.-shares
that are nominally quoted at about Id., is going
the familiar road. In 1894 the co. made a loss
of £14,378, and in 1893 it was £11,151 to the had.
Another heavy loss has been made in 1895. It is there-
fore proposed to turn the preference shares into 6 per
cent, debentures ; to write off one-half the capital ; and
to make “large reductions” in salaries and wages. The
lamentable thing is that, as Hudson Brothers has paid no
divs. for a long time, the reduction of the capital will
make no saving in the outgo, and, if things are at present
anything like on the ’94 basis, even a reduction of wages
to one-half won’t show a profit. In ’94, the gross profits
and rents were only' £1196, while working expenses alone
were over £BOOO, and, under conditions like these,
economy looks about hopeless.

The Savings Bank of N.S.W. has been com-
pelled to reduce the interest on deposits from five to four
per cent. The Savings Bank divides all its profit among
depositors save a certain proportion carried to reserve
fund and allowances for depreciation, and the steady fall
in interest has made the 4 per cent, unavoidable. The
reserve, by T the way, is now £235,000; the interest paid
during ’95 is over £140,000, and the amount at credit of
depositors is £3,951,000.

M'Cracken’s City Brewery (Melb.) has made a
loss during 1895 of £22,923. Last year the loss was 19983,
and in ’93 this same luckless heer enterprise dropped
£4636 of good money into the vat and never saw it. again.
The City Brewery is loaded down with £500,000 worth of
debentures and £lOl,OlO of mortgages, and the load is
evidently a lot more than it can stagger under. Its prin-
cipal asset is £900,000 worth of buildings, public-
houses and goodwill taken at original cost, and the
thought of what the depreciation in this great mass of
public-houses may amount to is enough to turn the
average shareholder grey'. Also, “ goodwill ” in a case
like this is a truly interesting asset.

The Queensland Life Insurance Act of 1870 is
supposed to protect policies of deceased persons against
“judgment, decree, order or process of any court, or in
any other manner whatsoever.” It was framed and passed
into law with the express object of making the moneys
due a certainty to the heirs. The Queensland Supreme
Court has recently decided a novel point: One Goodrick,
a chemist, died, and his estate proved to be bankrupt.
Deceased left a will with the old-fashioned proviso that
“ after payment of his just debts, etc.,” his estate should
be divided as directed. His creditors claimed the benefit
of a £2OOO policy, and the judges have held that, de-
spite the Act, there was no bar to the assured disposing,
while alive, of his interest in the policy, and that the
wording of the will put the policy outside the Act; so
the amount claimed was ordered to go the estate. If
Goodrick had died intestate his family would have bene-
fited, as no doubt he had always intended, to the full
extent of the policy. The judges virtually said : Always
let creditors look after themselves, and make no mention
of just or other debts in your will.

Bankruptcy item from Sydney D.T. : “The
witness, said the Registrar, had sworn over and over again
that he had made entries in a certain book prior to 1894,
whereas a calendar for 1894 printed into the cover showed
that the entries must have been made subsequent to the
dates sworn to.” With or without due respect, the
calendar shows nothing of the kind. It merely shows
that the entries were made after the calendar was printed.
As it is the trade custom to print calendars —
especially in book-covers—months in advance, in order to
sell them before the year comes round, it is possible that
the book in question had been written in any time within
the last six months of 1893. A legal non sequitur, there-
fore, on which a witness got seven days’ commitment to
gaol for “prevarication.”

drawal. All the rest of the evening the holy Harper
seemed to be praying inwardly : “O Lord! teach Thy

The boot-manufacturing trade in Melbourne is

The Victorian Income-tax Commissioner got a
nasty jar from the Full Court last week. He claimed to
charge the tax upon a legacy of £3675 received by a Mrs.

that a lump sum of legacy is no more income for a
particular y ear than bank-shares are interest on the in-

M.L.A. M‘Gregor, in Vic. Assembly, on the
tribute evil : —“He would give them the balance-sheet for
the half-year ending 14th Dec., ’95, of one of the best
mines on tribute in Ballarat East. This mine yielded
6670 z. 4dwt. 18gr. of gold, of the value of £2752 ss. Id. ;
the proceeds from the pyrites were £2l 6s. 5d., and from
the plates ! 30 7s. 3d., making a total of £2SO3 18s. 9d.
Out of that the tributors had to pay for cartage and
crushing, 2313 tons at ss. 3d. per ton, £629 10s. Bd., leav-
ing a balance of £2174 Bs. Id. The company tools one-
half of that balance, £lOB6 13s. 9d., and charged the men
who were prospecting and developing that mine at the
expense of their butchers, grocers, bakers, and landlords,
£l4 for keeping the air courses clear, £53 7s. 6d. for plat
work, and £1 for charcoal making, a total of £1152 Is. 3d.
After paying sundry expenses there was only £BB5 10s.
left to be divided between twenty shareholders for twelve
months’ work, and that was considered one of the very
best tribute mines in the district. Unless the Minister
did something in the direction of improving the tributing
system of prospecting, there would be very few miners
living in Ballarat a few y'ears hence.”

Civil servants are in a quandary over the
N.S.W. Superannuation Act, as recently amended. Any
effort on their part to find out from the authorities just
how they stand in relation to the Act, leaves them in a
worse fog than before. The other day a C.S. wrote ask-
ing the straight-out question whether or not, in the event
of his resigning the service, he would receive back
his contributions to the fund ; and, by way of reply, was
informed that his letter, “seeking information on the
Superannuation Act,” was being held over till further
notice, “ pending further consideration and legislation.”
Which looks as if the fund can’t stand the strain of too
many withdrawals all at once, and that the Govt, intends
to amend the Act some more. If this is so, there is but
one way for the Govt, to redeem its promises to the civil
servants, tacitly' given them when the fund was inaugu-
rated, and at the same time conserve the interests of th*
people : Let the Superannuation Fund be converted into a
State Life-assurance Department.

a chunk of £3,400,000 having been added to them
m twelve months. Of new business actually paid
for, not merely accepted, there was a modest sum
of £30,000,000, which shows a net gain of £12,500,000

In Victoria, payable gold has been got at 3000 ft.,
whereas, in N.S.W., the greatest depth at which payablo
gold had been mined was 1040 ft. With the object of en-
couraging deep mining, N.S.W. Mines Minister Smith has
now approved of a reward of £lOOO being offered for the
discovery of payable gold at a depth of not less than 2000 ft.
The shaft may be perpendicular, or may follow the under-
lay, but the depth must be 2000 ft. perpendicular. For
the purpose of testing the reef, 250 tons of stone must be
taken from it, at or below 2000 ft., and crushed at a bat-
tery to be approved by the Minister; the stone to be
broken down, raised, and crushed under the supervision
of an officer of the Department of Mines. To obtain the
reward, the stone must yield not less than lOdwt. of gold
per ton. This is the minimum which will be deemed pay-
able. The reward will go to the first person who reports
gold at 2000 ft. and complies with the conditions.
* * * *
The Bulletin has often wondered if a £lOOO
reward would enable the N.S.W. Mines Department to do
something sensible. The unfortunate Minister Smith no
doubt imagines that the reward is sufficient to cause a
rush for it by many nines, and that some shafts will start
from the surface with the hope of winning this great
prize. Why, in many cases it is not enough to sink the
last 100 ft. Ten dwts. might be more than payable under
some circumstances, while lOoz. would not be under others.
The N.S.W. mines will go down when the owners think
there is anything to go down for, and to offer a miser-
able £lOOO for 2000 ft. in a country where the average depth
is not 200 ft. is a most grotesque absurdity.

B.H. South, for the half-year ended Dec. 31,
added £6233 ss. Id. to the credit of profit and loss
account, bringing the total up to £10,453 Is. lOd. During
the term the co. received £7448 12s. 6d. in surpluses over
advances on shipments made in the preceding half-year ;
and it estimates that it ought to get £11,971 11s. lid. in
surpluses above advances made in this last half. It has
paid away £7492 13s. for fuel and timber and “mine
charges,” £5OO to the South Disaster Fund, and £2636
15s. 2d. represents “ exploratory and developmental ex-
penses.” The timber-bill has no doubt been abnormal,
because (as The Bulletin said lately) the absence of a
second shaft prevents systematic muik ck ng-up, and the
collapse in the dopes proved that more support was neces-
sary. Also, as th s second shaft-way has been under con-
struction, the developmental expenses have been abnormal.
Reduce them 50 per cent., reduce the ccst of working
through the opening up of a second, shaft, and assuming
no serious fall in the quality of the ore rrthe price of lead,
and the mine, furnished with its present concentrating
plant, would seem to be about capable of paying £15,000
a half-year—three sixpenny dividends. No doubt there
will be a slight falling away in the quality of the ore pro-
duced, but gradually better results from the m fling
should be got. Yet nothing that now seems possible can
lead to a return of more than 3s. a year with the present
plant.
The proposal in connection with the B.H. South
is to add to the plant, the funds to be raised by selling one of
the three remaining blocks. (Block 5, by the way, was sold
by this co. !) But already the South has 200,000 snares of £1
each, and that seems even more than these blocks can
stagger under. One way would be to about double
the present capacity of the mill by mopping up the exist-
ing credit balance, but that would mean the certainty < f
no dividends for another half-year or so. Still another
way would be to be content with the present plant and
output—or, at least, to put up with it. Admittedly that
prospect would be only a dull drab, but it would be com-
paratively safe. Even as it is, to pay 3s. a year (3d. a
month) would mean the extraction of about 70,000 tons of
ore; and, though there has been much airy talk of the
“millions of tons of sulphides” in the Broken Hill mines,
a very big hole indeed is made in such a lode as the
South’s by the extraction of 70,000 tons. Visitors to the
Junction begin to appreciate that.

Great Cobar Copper directors’ report would lead
anybody out of “ the know ” to think that the progress of
the mine was due to the board’s special exertions, while,
as a matter of fact, the aboriginal discoverer of the big
lode has done as much “ steady development ” as ii
has. The co. owes everything to the tributors and
Longworth’s method of economically treating low-grade
copper sulphide ore ; and, if the board had the mine on
its hands to-morrow, the shareholders would probably
divide a good deal less than the tribute-money. This
amounted to £3542 for the half; and, starting with a
credit of £5350, the co. paid two 6d. divs., totalling £4OOO,
and carries forward £4852. The average copper contents
of the 23,000 tons treated was only 4A per cent., but the
gold return of nearly 4oz. per ton of refined copper made
all the difference. With a 5 per cent, royalty on thi
copper and 10 per cent, on the gold, the co, is appar
ently doing almost as well as the tributors ; butthetribu
tors deserve all the credit.

N.S. Wales, includes Mt. Brown, Warratta, New Bendigo,
and Tibooburra: from an alluvial field, discovered 16
years ago, it has very slowly passed to the reefing stage.
There are several fair “shows,” but the solitary battery
cannot save more than two-thirds of the gold, owing
chiefly to the presence of galena in the stone. An attempt
has been made to get cyanide introduced to the district:
but it is hard work to get anything introduced to a scat-
tered place that lies 250 miles from any fair sized town,
along a track waterless most of the time.
* * * *
A rich find of silver and bismuth has been made
at Jingera, near Pambula (N.S. W.), a place created on
the strength of a discovery of this kind some four years
ago. It proved a patch, and the field was abandoned.

The latest move of the Baker’s Creek Extended
syndicate is to form a local co. with sufficient calling-
power to open up the mine. Now, this mine is worth ,
great deal more to the parent co. than any' other, an i
that co. is in the best position to know its value, having
worked several, levels up to the Extended boundary
Why has the Baker’s Creek Co. not gone for it? A
waiting game, evidently.

Melb. policemen have been ordered to stop
flower-girls of tender years from trading in hotel-
bars. Lately the wily practice has grown into a
sort of charitable institution. Hebe, when she
possesses a heart, is apt to encourage the ragged
little merchants to skirmish around her bar, tempt-
ing johnnies to buy a thrip’ny bouquet for the
lady. Threepence isn’t much to pay for a gracious
smile. Miss Hebe selects a cluster of three mori-
bund rose-buds and pins it in her breast, and
johnnie departs—happy. Then the infant flower-
vendor comes in to collect the “ buttonhole ” from
her patroness, who presently chooses it again from
the same basket at the earnest request of the
next johnnie. He departs happy, and again the
floral tribute returns to the place whence it
first came, and so the game proceeds. On
some days, when admirers are plentiful, the
fair philanthropist is responsible for at least half-
a-dozen threepenny purchases of one damaged
bunch of vegetables. In fact, some days she has
been the brief possessor, at one time or other, of
every “button-hole” in the child’s stock. Her
reward is, perhaps, a husky “ Gordblessyer !
miss,” spoken with a more or less clever assump-
tion of artlessness. Then the child goes home,
thinking how sweet it must be to stand behind a
bar for about 10 hours per diem “ foolin’ the chaps
like that. ” This is a crafty world. It is probable
that Hebe derives rather more satisfaction from
foolin’ the chaps than from fairly earning a bold-
eyed youngster’s benediction.

The news that- diphtheria is prevalent
among the fleet at Hobart, and that of two officers
attacked one has died, will not tend to advertise
that beautiful but evil-smelling city as a health-
resort. Diphtheria comes from dirt. Without
dirt there can be no diphtheria. Dirt-diseases
don’t generate aboard well-scrubbed men-o’-war.
Let Hobart scrub itself.

Typhoid in some of the Sydney suburbs.
And it is the old, old story—scarcely varied in a
detail. Hollows filled up with garbage. This
they call “making ” the land. (It is being done
in Moore Park now.) Then the allotment-monger
.nines along, followed by the jerry-contractor, and
the time - payment, be-your-own-landlord auc-
tioneer. Next—streets are proclaimed. Result:
typhoid. The hardy community gets over it, and
population thickens around. People awake and
clamor for sewerage. They get it at long last.
And directly the drains commence to be dug—
typhoid ! among a crowded and all-ready popula-
tion. Yet fool copybooks tell us that j ‘ experience
teaches.”

The Adelaide Gimlet Woman wants Govt,
to alter the local divorce law so that a wife can
get rid of her husband on proving against him
adultery alone—without cruelty. There is a sub-
stantial difference between male and female adul-
tery. A wife can generally make a roughly-
accurate guess as to the identity of her child’s
father, but husbands are not always in so fortunate
a position. A certain (or let us say uncertain)
Frenchman had surprised and was about to slay
the destroyer of his wedded happiness, when
Madame frenziedly interposed. “ Wretch ! ” she
exclaimed, “ wouid you slay the father of your
children ? ” As to the Adelaide Gimlet Ladies’
agitation “for amending the laws relating to
seduction by fraud or false pretence, so that a
woman may claim damages in her own right,
without the plea of loss of service to her guardian
or employer,” it looks like a New Woman’s
“ring” to boom the gentle art of being seduced
into a profitable industry.

The Adelaide W.C.T.U. wants the age of
protection for girls to be extended from 16 to 18
years of age. Premier Kingston says the Govern-
ment is strongly inclined to do this. This being
so, it should also be prepared to pass an Act pro-
viding protection for men —say up to 90 years old.

“ Yes,” shrieked the lady-lecturer, in
shrill and breathless peroration, “now is dawning
the Age of Woman, the grandest age the world
has ever seen, and it has seen many ages, each
raising the human race to a higher plane than ever
before, each a crisis in the world’s history. Let
us name some of them—the Stone Age, the Copper
Age, the Iron Age, and now we enter upon that
whieh is, of all, the greatest, the noblest, the most
perfect, and the most critical, and that, friends,
is .” And, as she paused for breath sufficient
to pronounce once more in soul-stirring tones the
glorious name of that magnificent age, an unutter-
ably horrid Old He-Man among the audience
jumped up and yelled—■“ Yes—the Age of Con-
sent ! ”
Victoria, after a long lapse,
has again begun to make Govt, ap-
pointments from outside the service.
The police force and telegraph-
messenger staff have run down so
low in numbers as to make this nec-
essary. As far as possible, during
the last two years, police recruits
were drawn from the surplus hands
in other branches—chiefly the rail-
ways ; but few suitable men were
found. Only small boys are now
being appointed as telegraph-mes-
sengers ; as the retiring-age of lads
taken on has been fixed at 17, most
of the new appointees are not yet
out of knickerbockers.

Some Smellbourne sassiety
women are again bitten by the craze
to be photoed in the nude, a craze
which comes in with the warn
weather, as a rule. The trouble is
to find a first-class photographer
willing to do the deed. To “ take ”
a spinster mid nodings on is notori-
ously bad business, because she is
apt to recover her modesty, such as
it is, and evermore avoid the studio
where she made an object of herself.
This explains why a politician’s
shapely daughter has been pleading
in vain at more than one establish-
ment for permission to expose her
nakedness to the camera—not to
mention the blushing operator in
charge. It is a pathetic situation,
that of a woman begging a com-
parative stranger to gaze upon her
beauty unadorned, and being told to
take her improper suggestion to the
next shop.
A few days ago a Melb. dentist was
approached by a very pretty, well-educated girl
who asked him to separate two front teeth of her
upper jaw, so as to leave a space of about one-
twentieth of an ipch between them. He tossed
back beauty’s head, got the “ separator ” in posi-
tion and screwed it up. “ But there’s nothing the
matter with your teeth,” he explained, jamming a
mirror against the roof of her mouth. “ Matter !
Gf course not,” retorted the girl, “ but it’s very
lucky. I know a girl who had it done about three
months ago and she’s going to marry a man with
■£3ooo a-year next week.” The man of forceps re-
monstrated for some minutes, but as the girl was
determined and threatened to give someone else
the job, he did the work, took a guinea, and
watched his patient travel down the steps looking
both ways at once for the man with £'3ooo a-vear

The other day two young girls were
brought before Melb. City Court charged with
vagrancy. They had been found in a Chinese den.
Panton, P.M., after giving them into the custody
of Sister Hannah of the Central Mission, fixed a
frosty eye on one of them as she was leaving the
court and said immediately- I 'Sergeant Eason,
see that she goes back to Bendigo. As sure as site,
remains here she will be back at the Chinaman s
again ; I can tell it by her walk. How is that
for perspicacity? By the way, isn tit Emerson
who says —whatever he means by it
For the prevision is allied
Unto the thing so signified ?
“ENOUGH TO MAKE A

Until last week Melb. lawyers
were almost unanimous in declaring
that Dormer’s allegations of Bench
corruption would be held unproven.

One moral Brisbane might have drawn
from its late accident, but didn’t—that it really is
the slowest town. For three years people have
risked their lives on a rotten structure in a state
of chronic collapse, and have another year of this
joy ahead. And when the new structure is
finished it is certain to collapse in exactly the
same way as the old one. But the property-
owners at both ends of the bridge won’t hear of it
being shifted to an intelligent site a little lower
down. Great is Proputty !

The Pearl ferry disaster at Brisbane was a
big windfall for the local pulpits—the sucking
theologians among them beat the subject thin as
goldleaf. Strange how they gather like vultures
to the feast.
* * * *
One man swam ashore from the Pearl with
his umbrella and bag in hand. Didn’t want to
get wet on his way home. A reporter, of course.

Half the inhabitants of Brisbane, it ap-
pears, were either just about to step on the ill-
fated ferry-boat which sunk in the flooded river,
or knew people who were about to step on, if a
variety of apparently trivial accidents had not
been interposed by a Providence who knew the
world and their wives couldn’t spare them just
then. The human liar is always at his best after
a great catastrophe, and the human itch to prove
some connection, however slight, with the event of
the hour, is apparently one of the last instincts

Perhaps the best joke of the Lormer
Board enquiry was elicited by old Bird,
from a free-and-easy female witness. Bird was
anxious to show the puritv of his friendship for
ex-barmaid Fleming. “ Didn’t 1 try to lead her
to the path of virtue ? ” lie asked. “ Yes,” said
the grinn'ng witnesi, “ Yes, you did—in Richmond
paddock.” N jvv, Riciimond paddock is not exactly
the nlace one would select for a small spiritual
meeting.

The Social Purity Branch of Yic. Presby-
terian Assembly the other day sent to the Chief
Commissioner of Police (Vic.) several foolscap
sheets complaining of the immoral tone of “The
Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith.” The pious censor is
wroth because none of the critics called attention
to the “wickedness” of the play. As a conse-
quence of this complaint, Constable Muldoon, the
first policeman to hand, say, was detailed to
closely watch the piece, and immediately arrest
for inspection all improper passages. Upon this
functionary’s report the official reply to the snuffle-
buster’s complaint will be based.

The love of woman for the glory and glitter
of brass-bound militarism, and her abject worship
of a fighting uniform, is perhaps necessary for
race preservation and the survival of the best.
The advanced woman goes one better. Daybreak,
the Wellington (M.L.) women’s paper, advocates
the formation of a class to instruct girls over 16
in the use of firearms. Which is not so much the
outcome of a feminine desire to face the Maxims
as another reach-out for the same weary old
Trousers.
* * * *
The proposal that Sydney police shall wear
india-rubber or similarly soundless soles is again
to the front. But the evil which calls for increased
protection is to be met by a numerical increase of
the police force, not by endowing an insufficient
force with extraordinary powers. The arming of
Sydney police with revolvers gave individuals, to
be used at their own private discretion, an execu-
tive power which only a Supreme Court could pre
,^?, Uf!i ]y claim. The silent soles are another corn
m T . same direction. At the wildest
,l ~. dack the Ripper panic in London the
authorities there rejected proposals for silent
soles. Why must Sydney ape Draco ?

Melbourne’s most recent skull-mystery has
had a prosaic ending. The skull, found in the
stock at a local bone-mill, was traeed to the dust-
bin of -a dentist, whose mother had thrown it there
because she had no liking for anatomical bric-a-
brac in the drawing-room. The skull was that of
an aboriginal woman, and was found at Mortlake
years ago; and the thrilling fracture (knitted
without the aid of a surgical operation) was pro-
bably nothing more than the result of a tap from
her loving husband’s waddy. The new woman
should secure this relic as an evidence of the
manner in which the tyrant man treated the
revolutionary gin of other days.
A small boy, who ‘ ‘ did not appear more
than 10 years old,” was stood on a gin-case in the
dock at Melb. Criminal Court, the other day, and
solemnly tried for having indecently assaulted a
little girl. The monster pleaded guilty, and has been
sent to the “ Deformatory ” school. The fact that
he is not to be hanged is accepted with delight by
The Bulletin as an evidence of the humanitarian
influence of its gospel.

S. : “ There are three marriages in ‘The

Of the married six mentioned, four are in purga-

daily critics. I don’t know, but there were six
married men in an establishment with which I
was associated, a couple of years back, and five of
the six were living miserably with their wives.
The sixth was living happily—with another man’s

“ Nat” Kinsman’s marriages are continu-
ally turning up in Melb. divorce-court. “Why
did you go to Kinsman?” Chief Justice Madden
asked a recent female petitioner. “ Because my
sisters were married by him.” “ Are they
divorced ? ” “No.” “Ah! lam glad to hear
there are some exceptions.” The lawyers should
be the last to carp at Kinsman—it all makes work.
Before the recent passing, by
N.S.W. Education Dept., of a regu-
lation requiring school-inspectors to
give notice to teachers of intending
visits of examination, the inspectors
dearly loved to turn up unexpectedly
in the hope of catching the teachers
napping. At a Sydney school where
this happened awhile ago, a little
girl was post6d off by one teacher,
who* had seen* the inspector coming,
to inform the others of his presence.
After the manner of some children
when bearing a message, the little
girl tripped along gaily singing aloud
so as not to forget : “ Go—and—
ten_Mr. Blank - that —the—inspec-
|dr—is—here. Tell him—to—get—
the—registry-books posted up
and —see that—the—teachers —are
—all—on—duty. ” This she repeated
over and over again. “ Here, what’s
that ! ” exclaimed the inspector, as
the guileless innocent skipped past
liiiii proclaiming her message of
peace. “ Come here ; now just you
go back, like a good little girl, to
Miss , and tell her that 1 U
deliver that message for her ! ” And
lie did, too.

Letter* received by a Sydney governesses’
agency :
Dear Sir,—The lady I want as governess to my little
girl (13) must be able to teach English, French, music,
drawing, and needlework, and assist in dll household
duties, except washing and ironing. We keep a woman
servant. On Monday the governess washes up w ile the
woman is busy in the laundry, and she sees to the vege-
tables while they are boiling; on Tuesday helps the
woman to fold the sheets and tablecloths ; on Wednesday
the governess airs, sorts, and puts away the clothes ; she
does all the mending (we are only four in family), darns
the socks and stockings, patches the trousers, and
does all repairs. She sees to the table if anything is mis-
sing on it, and clears away; gets afternoon-tea for visitors
If we have anyone staying in the house she keeps the
spare room tidy. Of course, the servant empties the slops
in the morning. The governess make the bed in the spare
room. On Saturdays the governess sweeps and dusts the
drawingroom and her own room, and, of course, makes
her own bed every day. (Of course !) In addition, she
also helps me clean the silver. She cuts the bread for the
table, goes to the store for jam or anything the woman
requires in the kitchen, and does all little duties such as I
hav-e mentioned. I forgot to say she sets the breakfast-
things at night, as we breakfast at seven every morning.
Please let me know salary required. 1 engage for six
months, but if* we find we eannot live comfortably together

mention that she must belong to the Church of England,
and not be over 30 years of age. I should like to see her

there any sex-problem ? If there isn’t, what’s the
good of saying there is? If there is, it can’t be
helped, and what’s the good of talking about it?
Besides, there isn’t any sex-problem.—Yours,
Titus Salt.
NEW LIES FOR OLD.
The big-tree lie is heard no more,
The snake lie’s day is done,
The lies of giant turnips or
Great ‘ ‘ goose eggs ” are out-run ;
The rifle lie’s exploded, and
The fish lie’s very dead.
To-day we hear on every hand
The cycling lie instead.

about its circulation, the extent of which is obvious to
anyone who keeps his eyes open while travelling in any
part of Australasia. If The Bulletin- said its circulation
was a million, there are at least two other weeklies which

justly resent the gambols of the Sladen-Hogan variety of
“ bounder,” and try and correct the cheek-created British
impression that his shallow incapacity is in some way
identified with Australia? And don't you think that an
Australian who encourages the aforesaid bounder, and
burns incense to his cheek, deserves to be plainly spoken
to? For, mind you, though some palatable truth might
have been added, there is no unpalatable truth to take
back ....Tom Gayndah : First section has some merit;

One of the pleasantest, coolest, most
central and best-appointed restaurants in Sydney
is the Manhattan Dining Room, situated in the
basement of the great Equitable Building in
George-street, Sydney. It is in the middle of the
busiest portion of Sydney, and is in every respect
a high-class establishment with good cooking, good
attendance, a lavish bill of fare, and luxurious
fittings and furnishings.*
Ada Crossley, of whom an excellent por-
trait by Elliott and Fry is printed on page 11, has got
thm since her arrival in London—not altogether a
disadvantage to one to whom stoutness means
coarseness. She has made many friends, and may
be fairly considered both a professional and private
success, writes a London correspondent to The
Bulletin. By a lucky speculation in Great
Boulders she cleared .£lBoo—no more and no less.
Berhaps this accounts for her being one of the
most stylishly-dressed artists on the concert plat-
form. Ada always had a firm, solid-looking figure,
f, n( * 't makes an Australian swell with pride to see
the calm assurance with which she “ comes on”to
an audience of two thousand. During her recent
provincial tour with Santley and other leading
vocalists the newspaper criticisms were extrava-
gantrn their notices of her abilities and future
possibilities. The Sheffield papers spoke of her
ff.the English contralto.” I, however,
think that “throwing the boomerang,” as Clara
Butt is a long way the Australienne’s superior.
Hearing both at a Saturday “morning” (com-
mences 3 p.m.) concert last week considerably
strengthens my opinion. Our singer, though, was
not m her best form.

Sydney, February 25, 1896.
My Dear Moorabinda —
It is becoming patent that some of the
v.omanaged tea-rooms of Sydney are working out
t heir own destruction through the ultra Yere de
Vcreness of the society-girls-c«m-waitresses who
condescend to “ yank ” buns for a livelihood. It
is altogether too funny. A waitress is a waitress
even if everybody knows who her pa was, and if
she is a girl of spirit the advantages she has in
natural or acquired refinement over the common
or garden sort should make her services so much
more suave and noiseless —she should hand yoi
the menu as if it was a bunch of flowers and se
the table with the graceful wrist-action she was
wont to observe at the piano. Also, her practisec
society smile should not desert her and merge into
the tired frown of the average waitress because
she now carries a tea-tray in place of a fan. But,
after all, her scowl doesn’t blight and destroy the
business so much as her unnatural desire to snub
and score off the customers. I object to no woman
blighting and withering a youth with a larky eye
or a tendency to flirtation in bold relief —if she
conscientiously objects to either the one or the
other ; but it is quite another thing to jump on to
a harmless citizen passing up his plate for more
scone and thinking hard about his wife all the
time. The other day a youth was obliged to
remonstrate with a more than ordinarily saucy
society waitress. His expostulation was mildly
put: “Surely you can be civil even if you are a
lady ? ”
After all, the aristocracy who deal out the buns
in front, and enjoy the privilege of taking your
meek orders in at least one fashionable tea-room,
should be comforted when they reflect on the
ballet rules which obtain in the establishment they
adorn—l mean the rules by which an all-wise
directress puts her nicest girls on to the tables
while the semi-rococo, spectacled, and fully-blown
are kept dark on the weather-bow, washing-up
and counting the cutlery. The lady-waitresses
should find real crumbs of comfort in that. The
mere fact of being allowed to hand the pickles in
the establishments I am talking about confers a
certificate of youth and comparative beauty,
which many a gilded fright could never attain.
The reduced lady serving tarts to ugly Miss Kil-
mansegg may console herself with the reflection
that, if circumstances razed Miss K. to the ground,
pecuniarily speaking, she could never hope to hand
tarts too, on the face of her.
Apropos tea-rooms, there is one I wot of that
is frontally approached by a sort of Jacob’s ladder,
up and down which the angels go in search of light
refreshment, but at the same time the really wise
woman with one petticoat on (as has been the
sensible custom during a record summer) prefers
making her entrance by the back way, and I never
knew why till one bright day recently when I got
the women on these steps between the sun and me.
Then I saw Society as the seed in a peeled grape,
or Hilda Spong when she played Titania with the
light behind her.
How much more prone to comfort men are in
their dressing as compared with women ! You
quickly find this out when you order a tailor to
build you anything; —it is especially brought home
to you when you discover the easy and convenient
place in which Snip has put your pocket. Dress-
makers are particularly trying over pockets.
Women pretend to men they know where to find
them (I mean the pockets, not the men), but that’s
only a piece of fine old crusted hypocrisy, for it
gives a woman as much trouble to find her pouch
as it does any married man smothering after it in
his wife’s wardrobe. It is a weird experience for
a woman to have a tailor make for her. The
difference between the ninth part of a man and
the modiste lies in two significant questions. She
asks, “Is it tight enough?” He wants to know,
“ Is it comfortable ? ”
Mr. Harry Hyndes—the Sydney society musician
who went to Europe in the green ear and was
eager to perform, and did, before a gathering of
eminent old world maestros before he had even
commenced his studies abroad; but who came
back the same way five years later with the com-
plete musical education he now possesses, and
could not be prevailed upon to strike a note where
once he had performed fortissimo—Mr. Hyndes
purposes issuing a waltz. It is to be called the
“ Mindaribba ” (the native name of the composer’s
birthplace, Maitland), and is to be dedicated to
Gov. Hampden, who may take some pleasure in
this dedication, for the waltz has a soft, sweet
melody set in a sort of musical filagree through
which the beat is always clearly defined. It is
presently to be scored for full band, and will, if I
am any sort of a judge, be one of the pet dance-
tunes of the coming season.
The innocent-looking little Mark Hamboure,
who is safely back on the Continent, thank good-
ness, played a well-deserved trick on a certain
hysterical woman who ohased him from pillar to
post while he was in England last year, and
made his life a burden by threatening to throw
herself over the cliffs for love of him. This lady
seized on Mark and forced him to write his auto-
graph in her birthday-book (a volume no wise
woman of her years ever insists on possessing, by
the way). Mark wrote. But his name wasn’t
enough for the lady, who insisted on a sentiment.
Then Mark lashed out with both heels: “You old
cat! ”he addended in Russian, and the cream of
the joke is that the lady (so writes a London
friend of mine) proudly snows the uncomplimen-
tary criticism to an admiring West End circle in
dense ignorance of its meaning !
The new governor of Bananaland, Lord Lam-
ington, for whom Brisbane is preparing the in-
variable “ prodigious welcome ” of two or three
wavering lines of militia, self-advertising official-
dom in jobbed vehicles, and the great unwashed,
strikes me as being “a somewhat different ” Gov.
For instance, I have not definitely heard that His
Ex. has been alluding to those silken bonds, and,
what is more unusual, it is cabled that a large party
of people saw the northern vice-royalties off and
cheered their departure. Now, as a general thing,
the cheering—ironical or otherwise —is generally
confined to the Australian side of the bargain.
People often remark upon the plain, unvarnished
departures some Governors made from their native
heath—a mere grabbing of a valise and a bolt for
the train. There is frequently a great contrast
between the simplicity of their exits and the circus
parade of their entrances. Gov. Lamington is
the first potentate I mind me of, who, apparently,
means to have a circus at both ends, and I think
northern Society should see in the phenomenon an
augury of general joy. After all, a mob of people
shaking their hats at him, and a long wake of
dead-marines, is the best certificate of merit a
Gov. can have from a Sassiety standpoint.
Mrs. Campbell Praed, in her new Australian
novel, “Mrs. Tregaskiss,” introduces one Cyril
Chance, a miserly millionaire (he is not accounted
miserly by the few who really know him), who is
a real personage very thinly disguised—so thinly
that it seems almost a personal outrage on Aus-
tralia’s wealthiest misogynist when Mrs. P. brings
Cyril Chance up to the mark with half-a-dozen
bottles of beer for the heroine, which he presents
to her, sitting in her drawing-room meanwhile like
any tame cat of a parson. One loses confidence in
the authoress at that juncture. The real Cyrus
would sooner go to the burning stake than into a
woman’s presence. It is one of the funniest stories
Lady Carington has to tell—how she tried to
scheme an introduction to the hardened woman-
hater of so many shekels, but never succeeded.
I am told that during the recent heavy rains on
the Darling it was amusing to see, in one tovyn,
the good old fashion revived of going to the post-
office without boots or socks, and with pants
hauled up to the knee well out of the mud. Every-
body, I hear, was “Trilbvfied” from the banker
downwards, and really tnere’s sound economy in
the notion—l only feel anxious to know how the
ladies managed. In former days on the Darling
it was the caper when entertaining to have a room
fitted up so that the gentlemen on arrival might
wash their feet and put on their boots before join-
ing the ladies ; what the ladies did remains a
mystery. And yet Max O’Rell says there is no
fun in the Australian bush !
The Royal Comic Op era Co. gave a very Mon-
dayish performance of “ Gondoliers ” at Sydney
Lyceum last Saturday, for the bone-melting,
marrow-reaching February heat of Sydney had
got on new-ehum Courtice Pounds’s nerves and
given him a frog in the gullet, and otherwise
incapacitated him from playing and singing
Marco as Mr. Pounds mummed and warbled the
picturesque Gondolier on his debut at Melbourne
Princess’s last November. With that novel and
artistic performance still in my mind’s eye I really
cannot take Mr. Pounds’s Saturday interpretation
seriously. I can t help thinking that if some-
body had slipped a piece of ice down the woefully-
perspiring tenor’s back we would have had a
totally different performance. His worst effort
was “ Take a pair of sparkling eyes,” in which the
action did not always suit the word ; “ Take a
tiny little cot,” warbled Mr. P., holding his hand
out meanwhile about as high as a self-respecting
dog’s kennel. But perhaps, after all, he was
thinking of accommodation for tiny little Flora
Graupner.
Wallace Brownlow (who, I hear, has taken to a
bicycle) made his reappearance this season in his
old part as the other Gondolier, with his large voice
in apple-pie order and the naughty little twinkle
in his eye as good as new. Mr. B. threw more
comic biz. into the part than has ever been done
before, but at least one laugh he got was unre-
hearsed. The moral is—never sit down in dark
clothes up-stage without carefully dusting either
your perch beforehand or your garments after-
wards. Florence Young reappeared as Casilda,
and the melodiousness of her fine voice and the
crispness of her acting were among the pleasantest
things in the show. It must be rather difficult
to appear as fresh as a daisy in a stale role—some-
thing very like the hard work any woman has try-
ing to feel brisk in an old frock. Flo Graupner
was the Gianetta who had to go on tip-toe to reach
up and let Howard Vernon kiss her hand (new
biz), and whose baby faces of distress were capital;
and Nina Osborne (strongly reminiscent of sister
Ida) as Tessa didn’t do so badly ; but she might
have glossed her shoes. However, it’s too late
now, for “ Nitouche ” goes up to-night (Thursday).
Cabled that the Rev. Father George Tuck well,
who recently left Sydney for France, has been
appointed to the church of our Lady of Victories
in gay Paris. This must be especially good news to
Father T. himself, for a snug living in the gastro-
nomical capital is right into the pocket of “ Mon
P6re,” as the R.C. Society damsels in Sydney
called him when he dropped in for after-
noon tea in the flowing cassock picked out with
purple which he in variably wore—European fash ion.
The good father’s cognomen is an instance of what
a good fit a name can be.
Apropos of eating reminds me that the pro-
prietor of the piratical Tit Bits gives some
exceedingly irresponsible advice to the rea
his new venture, Woman’s Life, under the head-
ing of “Cookery Recipes. Here, for example,
are the ingredients of what ought to eca _
Newnes’ apple tart: —One pound of app >
cloves, 2oz. sugar, water, ilb. flour, 2oz. dripp
and lib. of salt. Mr. Newnes must be going to
start a brewery for the next thing.
Major-General and Mrs. Hutton are leaving
N.S. Wales, and the community, from all 1 can
learn, has deep reason for regretting their depar-
ture. There has been in Sydney for many a year
no such liberal and tactful hostess as Mrs . Hutton,
and to the General is due the credit of having
abolished whisky-and-soda “ and petticoats as
controlling forces in local militarism. So far as I
can see, General Hutton has no enemies, excep
people who dislike professional enthusiasm, ath-
letic habits, and hard work; and he leaves behind
him the reputation of having loved work for its
own sake and never having imposed upon anyone
a burden more heavy than the one he was bearing
himself.
A friend writing from London tells me that
throughout the winter all the smart women, in-
cluding the princesses, have donned high-necked
black gowns for the theatre. Bare shoulders, or
even enveloping opera-wraps, are hardly ever seen
in the boxes now on chilly nights. Soft ruffs of
daintily-colored chiffon relieve the sombreness of
the attire. The fashion is said to have been set by
Maude of Wales, who has always suffered more or
less from bronchial weakness.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Dion E. Boucicault.
Dion E. Boucicault was born 23rd May, ’59, in
New York. His father, the world-famous actor-
author, was descended partly from an Irish and
partly from a French family. His father’s father
was a Dublin merchant; his father’s mother,
prior to marriage, a Miss Darley; a lineal
descendant of the same Darley family is the pre-
sent N.S.W. Chief Justice. In childhood “ Dot ’
had a French nurse, and learnt French and Eng-
lish in a home where both languages were spoken.
As a youth he spent much time in Paris. So,
although nothing more natural than his French-
man in “ The Amazons ” was ever seen upon the
stage, yet nothing could have come more naturally
to “ Dot.”
* * * *
Boucicault’s first tutor was the Rev. Charles
Carlos Clarke, called “the Sporting Parson,” a
writer of forgotten novels. Later he was schooled
at St. George’s Hall, London, and when 15, at the
midsummer breaking-up, he played in one of
Moliere’s comedies. Next time he was Hamlet.
His father meant him for the army, and he passed
the necessary exams, and served liis term of train-
ing with the Royal London Militia—now styled
the Fourth Battalion of Grenadier Guards.
But a ruling instinct, fostered by the associations
of childhood and youth, caused him, against his
father’s wish, to forsake the army for the stage.
And now he says : “ Perhaps I would have done
better to have stuck to the army. ”
In ’BO, at Booth’s Theatre, New York, under his
father’s management, Boucicault made his first
professional appearance as the Dauphin in “ Louis
XI.” Then he went off the boards for many
months, but reappeared with Laurence Barrett in
a repertoire of Shakesperian plays. He played
Osrip in “ Hamlet,” Lorenzo m “ The Merchant
of Venice, ” and often the four characters of Osric,
Guildenstern, Francisco and the Priest in one
night. His next change was to the Court Theatre,
London, then under the management of John
Clayton. Here he spent 12 months playing in
“The Parvenu,” “Comrades,” and similar pro-
ductions; and wrote and staged his first plays,
“ My Little Girl,” a one-act piece, and a four-act
romantic drama, “Devotion.” Here, too, he
brushed shoulders with such talent as Kendall,
Arthur Cecil, Forbes Robertson, Anson, Ellen
Terry, Cavendish and Lottie Venne.
* * * *
Next under engagement to Hare and Kendall,
at London St. appeared in a season of
comedy., Then back to his father in America, at
Wallack s Theatre, where he took the title-role in
Ihe Omadhaun a play which the elder Bouci-
cault wrote specially for the younger. After this
he went as manager with his father’s co. on a 12
months tour through America, playing in “The
Shaughraun” “Arrah-na-Pogue, v ’and “The Col-
leen Bawn. In ’B5, with his father and sister, he
came to Australia. And, since he went into part-
nership with Robert Brough, he has produced here
over 90 plays-all the best work for the past nine
years of the leading English dramatists, as well as
such standard plays as “ The School for Scandal ”
Money, and ‘ Much Ado About Nothing ”
Tins record is unequaUed in the short history of
the Australian stage. J
* * * *
« Boucicault has a word about “problem plays.”
J ‘ T, Lon^ on pi ; eS L Says sat$ at Problem plays, such
toL. Second Mrs. Tanqueray ’ and ‘ The
Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith,’ are not required—
there is no market for them; and in Australia
also these plays have been indiscriminately pitched
mtoby thej™ The ™ „otmX„ ut a
case. io me, a problem play expresses the
author’s desire to do good, earnest work, and to
get away from the frivolous class of entertain
ments so much in vogue just now. The problem
play draws the intelligent audience just LKS
M S-P* 1
scribing the dramatist’s held, and caUin*
names if he goes beyond it? Shakespeare Lund
himself to no particular field; he ranged from
heaven to earth, from earth to heaven—‘ a pot-
house poet,’ somebody calls him.
* * * *
‘ ‘ What is the drama ? I take it to be a record
a reflex, of the thoughts and feelings of the period
—a ‘ holding of the mirror up to nature,’ to quote
the immortal phrase of the greatest of all drama-
tists. And is it not patent to the most casual
observer that to-day we are discussing and debat-
ing subjects, and thinking and writing about
phases of human nature, which previously were
never so discussed and treated ? What is the use
of writing down the problem play—of saying there
is no demand for it, when the Brough-Boucicault
Co. ’s receipts for ‘ Tanqueray ’ and ‘ Ebbsmith ’
prove them among the most successful of our pro-
ductions ? The problem play is very much alive,
and will remain alive while intelligent, earnest
audiences look upon it with pure emotions and
grasp the teaching it affords.
* * * *
“ I have a deep admiration for Pinero, with
whom I regularly correspond. I think that ‘Thf
Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ’ is his masterpiece
from a literary standpoint, just as ‘ The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray ’ is from a theatrical standpoint.
And in writing these two plays he has done what
very few men have ever done—that is, achieved
an enormous success directly after achieving
another enormous success.

“ The study of a new part, a new character, sets
me conjuring up in my mind the peculiarities and
idiosyncrasies of the class which the dramatist’s
type denotes. lam naturally a man of detail and
observation. In my walks and travels, at the
hotel or in society, I see a trick of the hand, a
manner of walking, of speaking, of looking, which
I reproduce afterwards in its appropriate type.
Coming home from the theatre, after the night’s
performance, I have heard from the shade of a
building near a club the cynical laugh of the
Duke of St. Olpherts. At a fashionable gathering
I have caught his limp. A year after or before I
have seen his eves regarding a fashionable beauty.
And from a photograph I have learnt his facial
expression and much of his make-up. I have
never found a type complete in one man ; one has
to select—here a little, there a little—just as a
sculptor or painter uses one model for the hand,
another for the arm, a third for the shoulder.’
Every character I have played in Australia has been
a combination of people I have met and studied.
And I value detail and observation because, in my
opinion, they and they only enable an actor to
hope for the greatest virtue of playing—the
player’s ideal—versatility. The more thorough
the detail, the more careful the observation, then
the more does an actor become an actor among
actors. For by what other methods can he manage
to sink his own identity, and so thoroughly im-
personate a character widely different from his
own, as to produce an illusion upon the minds of
his audience ? My goal is reached when those
who know me best say to themselves, on my first
entrance, ‘ How unlike Boucicault that is! ’ and
then immediately forget that it is Boucicault at all.

“Itis as easy—and as difficult—to play a good
part as it is to tell a good story. By the
way, I think George Meredith the greatest of
living novelists. The parts I prefer are an old
man on the stage and a young one off it; but now
37 years are whispering that my young days are
going, if not gone. .

“ The 19th of June sees the end of my partner-
ship with Mr. Brough. So far I have no definitely
fixed plans. Shall I return ? Well, we are all
wanderers, you know, and it is more than likely
that at some future date I shall visit Australia
again. I don’t wish to think I shall never return,
for I have made many friends here whose memory
will remain in my heart, locked up under my own
life’s key. Though lam cosmopolitan— at home
everywhere—l should not like to say to Australia
—Farewell! ”

J. L. Madden, who, in ’44, went to what
is now Tumut (N.S.W.), and built the first house,
died there from heat - prostration last week,
aged 80.
Matthew Davies and suite are observed to
have grown about two feet shorter since Brassey
took over the glory of vice-royalty from Chief-Jus-
tice Madden.
It is now obvious that the proper place in
poetry of English laureate Alfred Austin is beside
John Cash Neild, Fitz Gibbon the sewage-bard,
H. Parkes and George Dean.
Artist George Ashton writes from London
to a Melb. friend in the best of spirits. He has
more black-and-white work than he can do with,
and makes money accordingly.
The officer mentioned for the vacant Melb.
Public Librarianship is Dr. Gagliardi. Since the
appearance of “ Trilby ” his striking foreign aspect
has caused him to be dubbed Svengaliardi.
Norman Thomas Mortimer Wilsmore and
his wife (born Leonora Jessie Little) are probably
a unique couple, in that they are both Masters of
Science of the same University (Melb. Univ.).
The greatest feat accomplished by Melb.
reporter Stark, lately deceased, was in asking
Capt. Tyler, A.D.C. to the Governor of the day,
whether he had married His Excellency’s daughter.
B. L. Farjeon once wrote that “the hair
and eyes of the daughters of Auckland were the
fullest possible realisation of the dreams of poets.”
And then he went and married an American girl.
Governor Glasgow keeps himself so much
out of public advertisement that, probably, 95 out
of every 100 in Australia would be unable to name,
without hard thinking, the present M.L. figure-
head.
George Reid, writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, is sure of his K.C.M.G.
That Jingo cablegram did it. Some people will
have it that he is not a statesman. But it is clear
that he is a diplomatist.
It is not generally known that poet Henry
Kendall was apprenticed to and served his time
with the Sydney “ lolly ’’-making firm of Biddell
Bros. The poet’s mother was a pensioner of the
firm up to the time of her death.
Among the candidates recently examined
for admission to the Wesleyan Methodist ministry
of N.S.W. was a young man who, according to
an official report, “was distinguished by a re-
markably fine-shaped head. ”
The movement to erect a monument to the
late J. B. Patterson has now completely fallen
through. Now, when the name of Patterson is
mentioned in Victoria, people have to stop a
moment to wonder who he was.
‘ ‘ Orion ” Home was at one time clerk to
barrister (afterwards Justice) Fellows, in Mel-
bourne, at about £8 a week. He wrote a most
abominable hand, and kept a keg of beer in the
office for the accommodation of clients. Which
came to the ears of Judge Barry, who told Fellows
that such a thing was “ most undignified.”
SNAKE “ MILKING."
M ‘llwraith wasn’t content with being a
heaven-bom statesman; he was a heaven-born
engineer as well. Someone asked him how long
the temporary bridge at Brisbane would last.
“Twenty years,” the sage is recorded to have
answered. And now it totters to its fall. OmenT
The stained-glass window placed in St.
George’s R.C. Church, Carlton, in memory of the
late William levers, M.L.A., contains a fine repre-
sentation of the Crucifixion, and immediately
below this a representation of the levers coat-ot-
arms—like an auditor’s signature to a balance-
sheet.
A very, very rich Sydneyite has dropped
nearly as much out of sight socially as he has
politically. Apart from sad family circumstances,
his faith in human kind received a particularly
severe shock when he was “ had ” for four thou’
by a brother “on the square.”
LOVE AND FORGIVENESS.
BEAK : “ Ym said your husband bit apiece out of your ear.”
CHENED WIFE : “No, sir, I bit it myself .”
The Marquis and Marchioness of Hertford
were booked to leave London per Ophir on 7th
Feb. They are the parents of the skirt-dancing
Earl of Yarmouth, and are probably coming out
to look up that promising youth.
The slander-action threatened by a Melb.
journalist against the publishers of Agnes Murphy’s
silly book, on account of certain thinly-veiled
personal references therein, has now been aban-
doned, and the book is suppressed.
S.A. Premier Kingston is said to be
a lot richer by his Niagara and Black Flag
(W.A.) mining deals. A lift badly wanted, as
Kingston does not seem to have the profitable
knack of combining politics with law.
Purves, O’Loghlen, Walsh, Wrixon, War-
rington Rogers, and De Verdon are the only Vic-
torian Q.C’s. The last three don’t practise.
Purves alone never appears without a junior,
Walsh seldom without one, O’Loghlen seldom
with one.
An item to shock some
old stagers and smash some
fifty historians : Samuel
Marsden, saint and
scourger, was never or-
dained. By the way, about
the only occasion in Aus-
tralia when one denomina-
tion has closed its place of
worship on a Sunday out of
respect to the memory of a
minister of another sect,
was when old Samuel died.
The Superintendent of the
Parramatta Wesleyan Cir-
cuit announced publicly,
“ Next Sunday morning we
intend to close our chapel,
and as a mark of respect to
the venerable man, we will
go to church and hear his
funeral-sermon. ”
Mr. William Davies,
who is “ milking ” snakes in
the accompanying photo-
gram under the watchful
eye of Demonstrator Price,
of Melb. University Physio-
logical Department, cares
less for the bite of a tiger-
snake than the average
Australian does for a mos-
quito bite. He will stick
his head and both arms into
a 4ft. by 2ft. cage containing
forty tiger snakes and,
knocking out of the way
those he does not require,
pick out any he wants with-
out a moment’s hesitation.
“ Milking ” is the extraction
of venom by making the
snake bite on the edge of an
ordinary watch-glass. The
venom is then dried and
solutions of known strength
made as required for experi-
mental purposes.
A Melb. telegram to Sydney D.T. states
that Mr. J. F. Harvey, a N.S. Wales M.P., has
sustained a chill “in the small portion of his
back ” Not the small of his back—the small por-
tion of his back. They detest boiling it down m
the dailies.
G. R. Dibbs, when supercargo of a vessel
trading in the Dutch Settlements, once saved the
life of the famous Bully Hayes, having found the
pirate ill of cholera and abandoned by his servants.
Dibbs stuck to him, and they became excellent
friends. This was his earliest preparation for
political life.

Matthew Burnett, the temperance-evan-
gelist, a man in earnest, whose dark eyes and loud,
hoarse voice are remembered by many in Aus-
tralia, has just died in England. His last days,
many will regret to hear, were embittered by
poverty. When here his fervid enthusiasm
was evidently burning him out. He probably suc-
cumbed to consumption. Close upon 30 years ago
Burnett was a terror to the bung industry
throughout Australia, and (temporarily) extricated

more men from the grip of the Great Australian
Thirst than any oilier evangelist and advocate of
the crystal spring. It was Burnett who undertook
a temperance crusade amongst a tribe of blacks
camped in one of old Jock Winter’s paddocks
near Ballarat. After the third time of asking, on
the conclusion of a most exhausting peroration,
the evangelist, who stood mopping his fevered
brow, was approached by the royal Jacky-Jacky,
who innocently offered a billy of beer, remarking :
“Mine tink it plurry hot. Big yabber-yabber
you, my word. Drink ! ”
Mrs. Besant’s lecturing tour in India is as
successful as have been the previous ones in that
country of many sects and religions. Five
crowded lectures in Calcutta included one for the
Anti-Vivisection Society, of which Mrs. Besant
was at one time such an ardent and strong sup-
porter. The visit to India terminates A.pril 4th,
and we are not likely to see the high priestess of
Theosophy in Australia before the end of this year,
if then. Interest in Theosophy seems to have
almost died out in Melbourne and Sydney since
the J udge affair was arranged ; and Herbert Bur-
rows’ attempt at a fresh disorganisation appears
to have fizzled. 1
Miss EElfreda Hilda Gamble, M. 8., Melb.
Univ., has been retained by Vic. Order of Odd-
fellows as specialist in the diseases of women and
children, and is the first medical woman in Vic-
toria to hold a lodge appointment of the kind.
There was one important subject, and one
only, on which chairman J. P. Garvan neglected
to speak this year in his great annual oration as
president of the Citizens’ Life Assurance Co.
Incredible as it may seem, he omitted all reference
to the dispute concerning the existence or other-
wise of canals in the planet Mars.
Victorian : “ Premier Turner’s resignation

never panted for it like Shiels. Turner sensibly
perceives it is not open to him to accomplish much
more, having done things that are almost great ;
and partner Sam Lyons keeps nagging, while
both of them are off-color in health.
Few men who knew him well do not res-
pect plucky old C. B. Fisher, the erstwhile S.A.
millionaire. Although he was down, he, not long
before he filed, actually took the many gold and
silver medals awarded him at cattle and sheep
shows, &c., and had them melted, and, with
the proceeds, paid every soul 20s. in the £ to
whom he owed money for clothing or food.
Letter by last English mail: —
Editor Bulletin. Dear Sir,—My attention has just
been called to the statement in your paper that the
Sketch has published a story hy Mr. Louis Becke, entitled
“ Kennedy the Boat-Steerer,” without acknowledgment.
I beg to inform you that this story was duly purchased
through Mr. Becke’s London publishers for publication in
the Sketch, and 1 shall be glad, therefore, to receive an
apology in your columns for the imputation involved.
The Sketch has so large a sale in Australia that, had 1
been aware that the story was appearing, or had appeared,
in the Bulletin, I should not have accepted it. —
I am, dear sir, yours truly, Clement Shorter, editor of
the Sketch, London. Jan, 15, 1896.
It is not The Bulletin, but publisher Fisher
Unwin who, assuming that the facts are exactly
as stated by Mr. Shorter, owes the Sketch an
apology. “ Kennedy the Boat-steerer ” (like other
Bulletin stories by Becke which have appeared
unacknowledged in the Sketch) was printed in
this paper at least two years ago. And for some
reason or other, Mr. Fisher Unwin has omitted to
acknowledge in the second volume of Becke’s
stories (it has not yet reached the Australian
trade) that most of the tales therein contained
originally appeared, like 12 out of 14 in “ By
Reef and Palm,” in The Bulletin.
“Jim” Stanbury, the
N.S.W. champion sculler, is
a grandly-proportioned man,
6ft. high, 13st. weight, 43in.
round the chest. Born on
the Hawkesbury, he grew up
partly there, partly on the
Shoalhaven. He is still un-
mistakeably a farmer ; and
looks younger than his 28
years. “Jim’’has seen the
great sport of sculling rise
from obscurity to the meri-
dian where a crazed people
worshipped it; then sink
suddenly into obscurity
again. He was barely in his
teens when, 15 years ago,
honest Bill Beach rowed his
first race in Sydney waters
a skiff-race for £lO aside.
Beach refused to sell the race
for <£2o, and on getting into
his boat he saw that one scull
was sawn enough to break
when the tussle should come,
so he changed that scull and
won. Beach won <£2ooo from
Hanlan in stakes; Kemp
<£looo. Beach, the second
time he beat Hanlan, won
£5OO in stakes, £l9OO in
testimonials, and many hun-
dreds in wagers laid him in
100’s to 0. He won £l3OO
in one sweepstake on the
Thames, and altogether
netted quite a fortune. He
paid £7OOO down for his
Dapto farm. Stanbury rowed
his first races at the age of
17, one day on the Shoal-
haven ; he won five races
that day. He was 19 when
he raced Searle, then 21.
They spurted 13 times the
first mile and a half —the bow
of “Jim’s” boat being op-
posite Searle’s ’rigger. Stan-
bury was a bit greener than
Searle, and Searle won;
nathless “he was too fast for
all of us,” says the present
champion. They came back
up the river together after
the race was over, up past the
spot where the broken column
commemorates the untimely death of Searle ; Jim
was fairly right, but Searle’s right forearm was
much swollen and its muscles were twitching in
evidence of the severity of the struggle. Stan-
bury “goes all over” when he’s done ; Haitian
used to go in the knees ; “ when Ned was done his
teeth would be grinning with desperation, and his
knee.-, would wobble every time he came up on the
slide. Stanbury says “it’s all nonsense about
Peter Kemp being nervous; like me, he never
rowed his race beforehand.” Kemp finished Stan-
bury as a sculler. The champion has a word about
pluck—“ after a man’s strength is gone he hasn’t
any.” Kemp is farming now on the Colo, and
M‘Lean, who beat Jim the first time they met, is on
theßichmond. Stanbury says, “M‘Lean never beat
me ; it was indigestion.” Anyhow, he rowed
M‘Lean blind the second race, and beat Sullivan
how he liked in his last race, over three years ago.
He is a oricketer, footballer, swimmer, and boxer
—he broke two knuckles in America on a big man’s
jaw. And he has been on and off a bicycle twice.
While training, his indulgence is sherry— sherry
and biscuit prior to the run before breakfast;
liberal sherry after-the seven miles forenoon row ;
“ water makes a man weak.” Eating—“ anything
good ” suits Stanbury. Recently, he has been
training at Ryde : sculling in the morning and m
the afternoon walking miles and miles in that dis-
trict of picturesque orchards, green slopes, and
wooded hills He has been married three years,
and has one child alive. In going to England to
race Harding, he leaves his wife at home, as Beac h
left his in the golden days of the wager-bout.

The Argus
condemns this
cheese-paring
policy, and
wants the Go-
vernment to
take large,

views, but the
Government
reckons the

the large views,
it took in the
past, and goes
on looking for
small econo-
mies, cutting
down gradients
making savings
on the oil and

closing up the
small leakages.

If a railway

miles of flat
country and
then mounts
one steep bank,
the load an en-
gine can take

building fathers of the country never thought of
this.
The Employers’ Liability, Homes Protec-
tion, and Non-compulsory Vaccination Bills, and
Maloney’s proposed bill to restrict security to the
mortgaged property, are evidently, from their
position on the notice paper, to be among the
“ slaughtered innocents ” of this present Vic.
session. The neglect of the first-mentioned will
probably be fraught with dangerous consequences
on account of the almost immediate expiry of the
old act.

grant was to be made on the tacit condition that
the old man kept quiet, and if the old man won’t
keep quiet there is nothing more to be said.
The original N.S.W. Labor - party was
offered two seats on the Public Works Committee,
but passed a self - denying ordinance against
accepting any emolument (other than salary) on
the motion of a gentleman who, by a coincidence,
is now a member of the present Works Com-
mittee.
Some apostles of the “ profitable utilisa-
tion of our vast tropical territory by colored
labor ” already openly talk of a possible acquire-
ment by Queensland of the Northern Territory—
Kanakaland to stand out of the Federation in
order to have a free hand with which to wallop its
own nigger.
Horace Tozer, Queensland Colonial-Secre-
tary : “ Only the other day I had a proposal from
a gentleman who wanted to go to America and
bring out negroes as cheap labor.” If Tozer didn’t
accept the offer it was no doubt only because he
thought he could get cheaper labor somewhere
near at hand.
Before Chief Sec. Gordon (S.A.) resigned,
the National Ass. paper described him as “ one of
Kingston’s automata,” but now it is amusing to
see them picturing Gordon as “ the one man in
the Ministry who possessed any backbone,” “the
most brilliant .... the only independent
Minister,” &c, &c.
There is a side entrance to the Yic.
Speaker’s room, hidden by a curtain, and behind
this curtain may be seen, any day. Mclntyre,
Shiels, and a prominent member of the Argus re-
porting-staff. It is here they manufacture bogus
crises and alleged impending attacks upon the
Turner Government.
Maoriland, the country that is being ruined
by Protection and Socialistic legislation, had a
revenue for the last quarter of ’95 of <£1,216,511
an increase of £311,000 upon the corresponding
quarter of ’94. Also, in the same province, where
men are being driven out wholesale by democratic
government, meddling, and tyranny (vide any
Tory paper any time in the last five years), the
arrivals were last year 895 more than the depar-
tures, and in ’94 they were 2253 more than the
departures. Even the attraction of Westralia
doesn’t seem able to keep people from going
laoriland-wards.
THE EFFICACY OF PRAYER.
PARSON : “ What, leave the church, Mr. Cooley—the church of which you have been
a pillar and an ornament for so many years? ”
MR. COOLEY : “ Yes; I'm done with the lot of you. It's likely I'm going to pay
for the support of a parson who prays for cold weather, while I'm running
an ice factory? ”
One N.S.W. magnate has shunted nearly
every able-bodied supporter in his electorate into
a certain department, and the Civil Service Com-
missioners will now have to get rid of several
dozen of them with compensation. Three or four
of his appointees were people who had been sacked
from other departments for incompetence or worse
offences.
Sargood, M.L.C. (Vic.) : “ The country
looks to the Council to polish bills that were un-
avoidably hurried through in the Assembly. io
“ polish them off ” he meant.
A SOUL-WAIL.
’ARRIET : "He's too bloomin' proud to look at me."
Free passes on the Tas. railways are
abolished at last, the order having gone forth to
stop them utterly. Still, this is only straining at
the gnat if the pernicious franking system by
M’sP. is allowed to continue—including, as it has
sometimes done, the forwarding of linen either to
or from “ the wash.”
Melb. Argus calmly admits that the U.S.
Democratic party —the I reetraders par.excellence,
so it please you—“ has come to utter ruin, through
corruption and mal-administration,” and “ that it
is, owing to its widespread alliance with villains
and humbugs, a complete wreck.” The Argus
has never said anything half so rough of the high-
tariffists.
Never before had Australia a Ministry so
gluttonous of virtue as the Reid crowd. But the
other day Minister Garrard assured the country
that it was a “ God-fearing Ministry ” ; and now
he yells that it is a “Ministry of modest men.”
Yet a large proportion of it has been in office with
Parkes ! Men who have sat with Parkes may
retain their God-fearingness, but their modesty —
never!
. S.A. Tory press industriously circulates
the lie that the workers are dissatisfied with the
Labor M’sP., who have become lazy and impro-
vident, and spend their time drinking at sixpenny
bars and smoking expensive cigars. Such state-
ments are, of course, made for the benefit of the
farmers, who are unaware of the fact that .75 per
cent, of the Labor members are (sad to relate !)
non-smokers and total abstainers.
What sort of men can Victoria expect to
find in Parliament, considering what is expected
of them ? Beazley, after an all-night sitting, went
yawning down to Collingwood recreation grounds,
and assisted his constituents to prepare a bicycle-
track for the afternoon’s sports. The member
who doesn’t adopt this sort of pettifogging policy
isn’t popular in the electorate. Beazley, M.L.A.,
“ worked like a navvy,” it appears.
N.S.W. Government- —which has just
appointed a Board to foster the export trade of
the province, the timber export among the rest—
sends up imported American and Norwegian
timber to build wharves on the Northern rivers,
right in the midst of the best hardwood districts
in the province. What is the use of appointing a
board to push on the export of timber, and urging
the Agent-General to find a market for it in
London, if the Government won’t use it where it
is grown ?
Sydney Teiecraph (on the eve of Waver-
ley election) upon Parkes :
Take his magnum opus, the N.S.W. Education Act.
When the cause of free, secular, and compulsory educa-
tion was on the up-grade and needed a lift, Sir Henry
Parkes was riding comfortably in the car of denomina-
tionalism, and giving the present Act his political dust.
As soon, however, as other men had laboriously dragged
it up to the summit of the hill, he dexterously jumped in
and secured the box-seat. This is what he calls giving
N.S. Wales its present Education Act.
Which only shows what Party Government is. In
the days when Parkes was in office and supported
by the D.T. that paper never thought of telling
the truth about the ‘ ‘ great statesman. ”
During that all-night session, Vic. Assem-
bly was decidedly “fresh.” Several members
“ had drink taken,” and more than one official had
“ a whisky or two more than usual.”
The Argus persist-
ently fights the minimum
wage idea, because it
regards the reform as a
ridiculous and hopeless
attempt “to eliminate
poverty.” Nosaneperson
expects the minimum-
wage project to “ elimin-
ate poverty,” but the
Argus’s position is that
of the individual who re-
fuses a crust to a hungry
man because the world
is full of starving
poor.
On the list of the
Vic. Ass. stands a mo-
tion in the name of
Graham, M.P., requir-
ing a plebiscite of
Victorians on the Bible-
in - State - schools ques-
tion. Churchmen of all
sorts declare this a
splendid motion ; people
who disbelieve in Refer-
endum and initiative
heartily say this motion
is good business. The
fact is, State Scripture
readings are unobtain-
able on ordinary political
lines no candidate
would dare to make it a
prominent point in his
election programme. The
Bible Referendum is,
therefore, the forlorn
hope of the churches.
It can do them no harm,
and the organised church
majority might make a
big enough show at the
ballot-box if the rest of
the populace were suffi-
ciently inert. No wide-
awake democrat would
be taken in by such
tactics— he would stipu-
late for the whole prin-
ciple of the Referendum,
not a part to suit party
purposes.
Thepowerof theN.S. W. daily morning press
writ large in the result of the Waverley election.
Its mightiest weapon is the possession of the Last
Word before the _poll. There are often enough
waverers on election morning to turn a battle;
these are in the gift of the Freetrade editor.
Herein lies the advantage the morning press
has over the evening journal, which comes out
when the heavy polling is mostly over. Protection
has little hope of success without a strong morning
daily, and those interested might as well take the
hint early as wait for several more general elec-.
tions to rub the lesson in.
Vic. Assembly’s division on the Railways
Conference was significant. The Labor comer
voted with the Noes, supported by oddments from
all parts of the House excepting the Treasury
bench. The Government won by 42 votes to 251
with the aid of the direct and indirect Opposition.
The Labor corner itches for a fight with the Coun-
cil, a deliberate set-to that will mean a dissolution
and an appeal to the country against Pat Man.
The Council killed the Land-tax and One-man-one-
vote ; it is “ dealing with ” the Factories Bill ; it
did its best to have the railways run as a capitalis-
tic bureau.
Parkes is justified in scorning Sydney
Herald and D.T. when they assure him that he is
worked-out and unfit for further political service.
Years ago they assaulted him with language as
crushingly emphatic, and ordered him to betake
himself to obscurity without more ado. “Now
that he is in his coffin,” wrote the Telegraph in
those days, “nail the lid down, and let the coun-
try have done with him.” And the Herald cried
“Ditto.” Yet, even a short memory can recall
the fawning servitude of both papers when a
political boil-up threw Parkes on top. In one 24
hours they remodeled their leading columns, and
fulsomely lauded him as “the greatest political
power ” in Australia, and one of the first half-dozen
statesmen of the English-speaking world.
St. James’s Gazette (London), discussing
war possibilities, admits what The Bulletin has
often stated :
Great Britain would be starved out within three or four
months if our foreign food supply were stopped.
Here is an argument damning Freetrade from a
Freetrade paper. And it is given full currency in
Sydney by the London correspondent of the Free-
trade D.T. ! The confession, even in time of
peace, amounts to this : To keep itself safe, and to
be sure of its foreign food supply, Britain must
spend many millions extra on its navy every year.
lor those millions it must tax its people. There-
fore, what it wrong-headedly supposes it gains by
Freetrade it loses over and over in navy-taxes.
And in time of war ? Absolute starvation. Sr.
James’s Gazette suggests a British Imperial
Zollverein ! Which is Protection, and nothing
but Protection.
In Vic. Assembly, the other day, Premier
Turner had the unique privilege of urging the
rejection of his own Railway Bill. His Bill pro-
vided for the Railway Trust recommended by the
Casey Board, but the Assembly rejected it, and
accepted instead a proposal for a single Commis-
sioner. The Council got the amended Bill and
promptly turned it back into the Railway Trust Bill
as drafted by Turner, and returned it to the Assem-
bly. Then Turner moved that the amendments
be disagreed with. Murray Smith asked if the
Government had any substantial existence at all ?
VV as it only a committee to carry out the wishes
of the majority of the House ? And the Govern-
ment answered Yes —if the House wasn’t to rule
what was it there for ? The idea struck Murray
Smith all of a heap, and showed his dazed
condition by exclaiming that he (sitting in the
Opposition corner) had supported all the Govern-
ment measures. Then the House laughed.

The N.S.W. Solidarity Labor-party, being
last session offered by Premier Reid one seat on the
Public Works Committee, in its turn offered the
position to three members of the party on condition
that one-half the fees should be given up to pay
other members of the party for organising. Leader
M‘Gowan and member Cann refused, on the
ground that if the salary was earned the earner
had a right to get it—a good labor argument. A
third gentleman took it on the caucus terms.
A Melbourne masseur, under cross-ex-
amination in a police court case, admitted
issuing this business card—“ Spiritualism ; circles

study of eight years with those masters of psychic
and occult forces, are now being formed by So-and-
So. Manipulation, 10s. per lesson.” One lady

Joubert is getting on. He has roped in
the Q. Govt, to support his “International Ex
hibition ” at Brisbane in ’O7, and the much-enduring
taxpayer is debited with the cost. Also, the Cocriei
has been nobbled by the crafty device of taking
offices in its “white-elephant” building; and as
the foreign exhibitor who reads that “ the proposal
has been taken up by the people of Queensland
and the adjacent colonies with such general
approval that the necessary capital has been most
readily subscribed,” cannot see the appalling wink
with which sentences like these must be penned,
he will probably fall in.
In future, no obviously consumptive per-
son will be allowed to enter Maoriland ; so far as
that progressive country is concerned phthisics
will be categorised with such undesirables as
lepers and smallpox patients, and any ship in
which they come will have to take them back.
By strictly excluding consumptives it will no
doubt be possible to immensely reduce the ravages
of that awful disease. When one considers that
a consumptive who walks spitting up one side of a
street and down the other can directly and in-
directly poison half a city, it becomes plain that
any community which allows tuberculous patients
to come and go without let or hindrance is less
than civilised.
There are now so many points at issue
between the two Vic. Houses of Parliament that a
rupture may occur at any moment. The Council
has turned the Assembly’s Railway Bill upside-
down, and it has torn the vitals out of the
Factories Bill. The Council is also riled at the
bad reception its Companies Bill received in the
Assembly, and at the open scorn which met the
proposal to elect the Federal delegates by post.
Members of the Assembly growl audibly at the
increasing boldness of the Fat Man Council,
which doomed body reads its Argus, and rejoices
in its own exceeding fatness. Premier Turner is
not the man to encourage a fight between the
Houses, but if the Assembly furnishes the indigna-
tion he will manage the tactics.

to Miss Gertrude Chamberlain, niece of “Brum-
magem Joe. The two chief bridesmaids were

after the election, when each of them tried tc

ing hands. A Scotch Governor did the rest.

New Australia doesn’t believe in freedom
of speech. Writers to the English press from the
-Paraguayan Paradise are threatened with expul-
, they persist in expressing their opinions in
the public press. “ Two months ago (says one of
the scribes), it was decided by 65 to 41 to alter the
constitution to single-tax lines. Last week, 83 to
23 voted against this change. Out of 2500 cattle
only 2Go cows are left—total value of live stock
being about <£looo. The average wage in Para-
guay is eighteen-pence a day.” In conclusion,
this hunk of wisdom: “Communism would be
all right but for the imbecility of certain indi-
viduals.” Yes, all systems shatter against the
meanness, incapacity, and imbecility of (( certain
individuals.”
The Melb. police reckon they have been
badly taken in by a strange woman. Some time
ago a man was run in on the frequent charge of
wife and child desertion, and, as he failed to make
any satisfactory arrangements, he was detained in
gaol. He had been there some time when a weep-
ing- wife came along, and said she had relented
and loved him still, and then she broke down
utterly and slopped her grief all over the J.P. and
other officials, so that they had to empty nearly a
pint of tears out of their boots when she had gone.
She further withdrew all charges against the old
man, and introduced two gentlemen of extensive
property who went bail for him to a considerable
extent, and on the strength of this he was
promptly released. Now it is alleged that the
weeping female wasn’t the wife at all, but a mere
irresponsible stranger, and that the two gentlemen
of property have no assets worth speaking of.
Therefore, the law is boiling mad to think that it
was taken in by so simple a device.
Calomel, or Blue Pills.
Don’t use them.
A PHYSICIAN’S WARNING.
Prof. R. A. Gunn, Dean of the New York
Medical College, does not believe in indiscriminate
and general use of any form of mercury—either
calomel or blue pill. Not only on account of the
dangers which often attend their use, but he finds
that all ailments resulting from a bilious condition
are safely and easily cured by using Warner’s Safe
Cure. This remedy is so well known in every
country, and all parts of the world, that every
medicine dealer has it for sale, and full instructions
for use, and also diet to be followed, are found in
a pamphlet which accompanies each bottle. Mr.
W. Stewart, Main Street, Petersburg, S.A.,
writes : “ I think it the duty of every man who
has suffered as I have and been thoroughly cured
by using Warner’s Safe Cure to send a testimonial
to the proprietors that the wonderful cures that
it effects may be made public. My complaint was
enlargement of the liver, which was of years’
standing. I consulted several doctors, but they
only gave me temporary relief. Being in Adelaide
on a trip, I went into one of the largest warehouses
there and during conversation told one of the
members of the firm how bad I was. He sent for
one of Warner’s pamphlets and told me to read it;
and having done so, I immediately got a bottle of
Warner’s Safe Cure, which gave me relief, and
when I got through twelve bottles I was com-
pletely cured. I have recommended it to several
of my friends, and in every case it has had marvel-
lous results, therefore I cannot speak too highly of
Warner’s Safe Remedies, and will recommend
them to every sufferer.”*

Moran, parliamentary representative of the
Coolgardie goldfields, has been talking sense in Adelaide
He claims to represent as many adult males as all the rest
of his colleagues put together. Why rave over the unequal
representation of the Uitlanders on the Rand after that'
He has faith m the permanence of the fields, but admits
that there have been many disappointments. Unfor-
khe capital nominally invested in the
goldfields never gets there. Properties bought for meagre
a!!!! 1 L have J* e ,? u /l oa te f l in England into companies of
£50,000 and £lOO,OOO, most of which has gone into the
pockets of promoters and brokers, only a very small pro-
portion dribbling to the mines ; yet the little sum for
actual mining is expected to earn interest on the big
amount. Exactly; it is by this means all booms are made
and by the same they are burst. Even the W.A. mines
are not rich enough to carry London Fatman’s babies.

Boulder main reef, says a paper at Hannan’s:
The mine is being well opened up, and, as is often the
case on the field, the property passed into the possession
of an English 00. before its value was discovered.” How
consoling for the British investor ! And, really, that is
his main chance to find something 1 the owners knew not
of. It was at least partly so with the Great Boulder, the
chief gold-producer of the West; but so as to let several
well-advertised people have all the credit, a fact known
to thousands on the field is never published.
The West Australian Exploring and Finance
Corporation publishes a balance-sheet, which shows
clearly how British capital is opening up Westralia.
The corporation started with a paid-up capital of
£155,000, to buy auriferous land cheap and sell it to
other British companies at 40 times what it cost. It
expended during the year, in office and other ex-
penses in London, £lB,OOO, and the amount spent
in “opening-up” the province seems to have been
under this amount. The profits for the year —to
be distributed in London—are £320,000, equal to a little
over 200 per cent, per annum. As the co. only bought
or leased bits of desert for very little, which was
probably about their correct value, and passed them on to
its own miserable countrymen, Westralia hasn’t lost
much by its operations up to date. Still, considering that
all the cash it has in Australia is only £21,000, and the cash
in London is £252,000, and that it owes £79,000 in London
and only £5O in Australia, and that against the £5O which
the co. owes in this country there is £1049 owing to it, it
would seem that the money it has actually left in Aus-
tralia is pretty nearly nil, and that somehow this con-
tinent is rather in its debt than otherwise. The
noticeable point about the British capital which comes to
Australia is that it doesn’t come. A person with an eye-
glass arrives, and states that he —haw!—-represents
£150,000 cash in London ; but the cash religiously stays in
London, and the gold, if there is any, goes there. That’s
the “ influx ” —or most of it.

Premier Forrest’s water-scheme is to build a
reservoir at Mt. Burgess, 10 miles from Coolgardie, and to
pump water into it from the Darling ranges, near Perth.
Public officers are “ mapping it out.” Of course, it would
never do to bring the water from Esperance—that would
be interfering with vested interests. Everything, even
water, must come from Perth. Besides, this scheme can
be carried out in five or six years, and its cost, with a due
regard to economy, should not exceed 10 millions.
* * * *
The day before leaving W.A. for London, Alick
Forrest, who controls the business end of the Premiership,
gave his ultimatum regarding the proposed Esperance Bay
railway :“ It will never be built. The only object of it
would be to divert the trade of the fields to the other
colonies, and that would be impolitic, and unjust at the
same time. No ; what I think will happen will be that
the Govt, will have to carry at specially low rates to the
fields, and that a line will be constructed from Coolgardie
to the Norseman. As for a direct railway from Esperance,
it is not to be thought of.” Norseman to Perth is about
6;>o miles ; to Esperance is about 150. From Esperance to
Perth is about 1000 miles ; so they coolly propose to han-
dicap trade with 1450 miles extra carriage for the benefit of
Perth ! Nine-tenths of the W.A. trade is with the other
1 rovinces, and must be for many years. Tub Bulletin
wagers that Alick will not have to live long to see the
Esperance Bay line built.

perial Westralian Corporation. Calvert himself has re-
signed, and explanations are demanded all round. Renals,
turning up just after the expose, was asked by the W.A.
Minino Journal if he, as chairman of the 1.W.C., had
anything to say, to which he replied : “ Being a guest at

pose of publication.” Then why not call W.A. Govt.

Dr. Schmeisser’s cabled report on the mines
worked by the Menzies Gold Reefs Proprietary has been
published. Errors have evidently been made in trans-
mission, but it is clear enough that the. Doctor did not
boom the mines as much as the Coolgardie newspapers
and correspondents boomed the “savant” when out
there. They already begin to speak ill of him in his
absence. “ Friday Lease : The reef consists, of greyish-

the ore contains iron pyrites at the point where the
snatt cut the vein. Incline shaft sunk on the vein 80ft.,

width of the reef on the surface is one foot; the vein is
narrowing in depth and pinched out at the bottom of the
shaft. In the 78ft. level, driving south 20ft., the vein is
small, and driving north, at 35ft. there is no reef. An
average sample from the shaft at a depth of 78ft. gave
14dwt. per ton, below the level of 78ft. 2oz. per ton.
Samples from the south drive assayed 7dwt. per ton.
Lady Shenton lease-shaft 80ft. deep on quartz leader, 6in.
wide. An average sample from the dump 34dwt. per ton.
t ifty feet from south boundary a trial-pit is sunk 30ft. on
a quartz leader 6in. wide ; assays, 9oz. Hdwt. per ton.
This leader should be opened in length and depth because
its gathered appearance is not very promising.” What a
faHing off is here in the size of reefs ! If this is the cold
wooded truth about Menzies Proprietary, what must
Schmeisser have said of some others in VV A ?

The latest development of Norseman. W.A., is
an alleged discovery of opals : “ The whole surface is said
to consist of a mass of beautifully-marked stones o
various degrees of brilliance. Old hands from the White
Oliffs opal-fields pronounce the stones to be opals, but
others differ. The specimens shown in Esperance to-daj
were described by some as good road-metal.” The satire
of which latter remark has seemingly been quite lost on
the Eastern dailies.

After a well-earned rest, the Cosgrove’s mine ai
Coolgardie rises like a spectre to disturb the public peace.
La,st report: “Several parts of the pumping-plant gone
astray in transit—shall not be able to start until they
are replaced. Something is always going astray with a
Cosgrove mine.

The story. Perth Mining Journal (Feb. 8), on
the Boodlegardie labor-market Mr. J. H. Horwood,
engineer for Messrs. Wilkie Bros., advertised for 500 met
at £3, for day work, so that they could earn £5 or £6
a week on piecework, but only succeeded in obtaining 16
men. Another climax. Extract from Coolgardie lettei
(dated Feb. 12) in Melb. Aoe “ The town is full of un-
employed. Notices are stuck up : ‘ Wanted, 500 navvies,
piecework.’ The poor, unfortunate new arrivals jump ai
the job, and find they cannot make ‘ tucker ’at it,” “Go
West, young man.”

Premier (Coolgardie), 1660 z. from 75 tons.

The Great Boulder, 127 tons for 7940 z. Up to
Ist Jan. over £107,000 worth of gold had been taken out
of the mine since crushing started on 10th April, 1895.

January Westralian gold returns show a falling
off of £9OOO from those of the same month in previous
year. The former totalled roughly £62,000, and the
latter £71,000.

A sample of W.A. wild-cats. Writes a former
Melb. resident : “ My second lease, which the papers said
was sold to an English syndicate for £lOOO, actually
went for £3OO cash. The same claim was afterwards
floated, in conjunction with another adjoining it, in Eng-
land for £122,000. This gives you an insight into the
amount of plunder the promoters receive.”

Lazarus, one of Bendigo’s deepest mines, crept
out of the call-list last half with two 6d. divs. (£2250),
milling 2036 loads for 12920 z. 4dwt. Co. recently cut a
big reef below 3000 ft., and to get at it properly will have
to sink deeper.
* * * *
Hustler’s Reserve No. 2 is making tidy progress
towards the div.-list. Past six months’ crushing, 575 loads
for 7290 z. 14dwt., has lifted it from call-making and
debt to affluence, with £5OO odd as a backbone. Though
the run of stone at the Fortuna end is small, it is yielding
very consistently.

Official ’95 gold figures for six provinces. N. S. W.
being late is an estimate only :
1895 —oz. 1894 —oz.
Vic. 740,086 673,680
Q. 626,299 675,000
N.S.W 310,000 324,787
M.L. 293,491 221,533
W.A 231,513 207,131
Tas 54,964 57,873
S.A. 47,343 35,844
2,303,696 2,195,848
Owing to Vic’s new and correct method of
computing its gold output, the figures for '95 dis-
close a startling increase of 66,4060 z. Of course, the
province has not achieved this jump (though M.L. did it
with something to spare), but owes it mainly to a new
method of keeping accounts. The ’94 estimate under-
stated the yield. By applying a reasonable system to the
figures available, the mining department now concludes
that the real increase is 23,1310 z., or about 3’2 per cent.
Maoriland’s increase for the year is very
material, being thrice the W.A. increase. The following
figures show the contributions of the different districts
1894. 1895.
Auckland 62,916 111,213
West Coast ... 86,950 89,429
Otago 76,353 87,694
Nelson 2,860 2,460
Marlborough ... 2,536 2,695
221,615 293,491
It will be seen that Auckland district has, “on its own,”
made a bigger advance than Westralia as far as the
statistics are concerned :
Auckland. Westralia.
1895 111,213 231,513
1894 52,916 207,131
Increase for 1895 58.297 24,382
Auckland is making a splendid sprint, but it will be a
long time before it dulls the glories of the West Coast
district and of Otago. Total productiveness to date
scales :

Otago 5,195,804 20,544,596

The old question of a buying broker’s liability
for calls on untransferred shares cropped up in Melb.
Supreme Court last week, and was decided against the
purchaser. H. A. Wilcox sold 100 Cyclorama shares at
Is. 6d., per broker Goodall, to brokers Clarke and Co.
Calls were made ; Wilcox’s name remained on the regis-
ter ; Clarke and Co. repudiated liability ; so Wilcox paid
the calls and sued them. Judge Chomley, in the County
Court, found for defendants; but the Supreme Court up-
set this decision, and Clarke and Co. have to pay. The
sale was made in the ordinary way at a Stock Exchange
call, and the Court held that under these circumstances
there was nothing to show whether the Clarkes were agents
or principals, and as the Stock Exchange rules prevented
the selling broker from asking, they must take the responsi-
bility of principals—which is sound sense, as well as pre-
sumably good law. If a broker wants to refuse responsi-
bility, he can do it by expressly declaring that he buys as
agent only.
* * * *
Bendigo Jan. calls, £15,772 —the stiffest test for
some time. Divs. to date, a shade over £l4,ooo—a
respectable jump on the £6OOO odd for the similar ’95
period.

F. A. Newman, the Melb. jeweller, writes in
contradiction of a recent Wild Cat statement that Queens-
land opals, cut, are worth from £3 to £l2 per carat.
Opals in general use by the trade are retailed to the
public at from 10s. to £1 per carat. The finest quality of
opals, such as are associated with diamonds in brooches,
run a good deal higher in price, but nowhere near £l2
per carat.

Charters Towers compares well with other Aus-
tralian goldfields—old and new. It produces 70,0000 z.
more gold than Bendigo (which comes second); its divs.
being £112,000 more than those of the latter, while
its calls are £37,000 less. Excess of divs over calls in
Charters Towers, for ’95, was £155,000, while in Bendigo
the surplus was only £7945. Ballarat comes third on the
list —its divs. and calls being usually about equal—
in fact, the surpluses proper for the last 20 3'ears are not
over £20,000. Rockhampton (really Mt. Morgan) comes
fourth, with 131,7340 z. the golden mount paying
£300,000 in divs. Fifth comes Coolgardie with 125,0000 z.

Another case of the mountain and the mouse.
“Harris Reward, Mt. Jukes (Tas.), 14th Feb. All work

The Westport (M.L.)Coal Co. is despatching its
first cargoes of coal to Valparaiso and San Francisco, and
is loading a vessel for Tasmania as an experiment in
another new direction. Evidently the deepening of
Westport harbor to admit large vessels has filled the co.
with new ambitions, and it intends trying to cut into the
Newcastle foreign trade in as many directions as possible.
Maoriland still imports about 100,000 tons of coal yearly,
but the local supply is steadily overtaking the consump-
tion, and this market is gradually being lost to N.S. VV.
The attempt to open up an export trade from M.L. to
Tasmania, however, doesn’t look promising. That island
is steadily developing its own coal-deposits, and will soon
be independent of outside supplies—in fact, with a little
more energy it would have been independent of them
long ago.

Pearl-shelling in the Straits is on the decline—
the floating stations introduced from W.A. have ruined
it. They scour the beds —a thing impossible under the
old, simple, one-man-one-boat system. The weakness of
the small man was the salvation of the shell-beds, for the
time lost in coming to port gave young shell a respite and
wholesale denudation was hardly possible. The floating
stations keep boats perpetually on the grounds in
all weathers. With the small men the shell was opened
every evening while the oyster and the spat were still
alive—consequently the latter was not lost. With the
schooners the shell remains unopened for weeks, so that
fish and spat are then both dead and useless.

One L. C. Burges, of Oakabella, W.A., and a
N.W. pioneer of ’66, claims to be the first discoverer of
gold in that much-boomed province. In March, ’74, when
within two and a-half miles of Roeburne, he spotted a piece
of dark quartz with four or five gold veins running through
it. He took up a claim, but it “duffered,” and it remained
for another man, a few years later, to locate a soz. reef in
the vicinity. Burges, however, never got the £5OOO
reward offered by Govt, for such discovery. That went
into the pockets of the prospector who started the
shameful Kimberley rush.


A Mangatainoka (M.L.) settler lately
appealed to the Land Board for more time in
which to pay his rent. His reasons were as fol-
lows : “ First cow I gave £6 for got bogged in the
creek and died ; second, a heifer I reared, died
calving ; third, a cow I raised, was shot by the
Government inspector when she was making 101 b.
of butter weekly. Dogs killed my sheep; one of my
pigs died and the other was smashed about in a
neighbor’s paddock in such a way that I had to
kill it. Then I lost £2 4s. in a fencing contract
through a fall of earth, and my potato crop was a
failure.” Go on the land, young man !

About the two most absolutely restful
places in Australia are Borroloola and the Roper
River, in the Northern Territory. Borroloola has
a mail from Port Darwin four times a year, and
so is comparatively active and up-do-date. Twice
a year the mail toils along from there to the Roper
River to tell the lonesome inhabitant and his dog
that the outer world is still alive—still rushing
along in big agitated cities, and getting run over
by tranicars, and hurrying to build great ten-
storey buildings, and falling off them in its haste
to get them up, and racing madly after trains,
and hallooing through telephones because it
hasn’t time to gallop round in a cab, and cursing
because its telegram doesn’t do 100 miles in
and breaking its neck to get out the special
’dishun of the Evening Ghoul one half-minute
earlier than the extra-special of the Evening Dead
Cat, and generally galloping, rushing, tearing,
perspiring, racing, falling over itself, cursing be-
cause it can’t get up again quicker, breaking
records, and trying perpetually to cover a mile in
57|secs. Then the mail goes away again, and the
inhabitant, and his dog, and his native bear, are at
peace for another six months, and really don’t
know whether the Chinese have annexed Aus-
tralia or not.

Even in this terribly-droughty season in
the N.S.W. Far West, and despite the scorching
days, water-melons flourish in the dreariest part
of the sandy desert. They are dotted, at intervals,
along the fearsome track between Broken Hill and
Mt. Brown (Q. border), and are said to date from
the days of Burke, Wills, and Capt. Sturt. W hen
the earliest prospectors went to the Barrier silver-
field, they found there a three-acre sand-patch
covered with melons. Moral : Sow melon-seed

Thomas Lord Brassey,
Your soul is most massy
To jib at your golden name’s tone,
And turn it to Bracey,
That’s Old Norman racey,
And thereby great glory to bone.
But oh, sacred Thomas,
You spoil your rich promise
When only the sound you ■assume,
Why waste the fine spelling ?
What hinders you smelling
The exquisite written perfume ?

Contrary to preconceived opinion, artesian
water seems likely to play an important part in
the scouring of Australian wool. Some fleeces
washed at Moongulla (N.S.W.) bore are described
as “leaving nothing to be desired.”
Recent investigations point to the tendency
to have more than one child at a birth running in
families. One English doctor records recently
that, out of 17 cases of twins occurring in his
practice, he has been able to trace 13 cases where
twin-bearing has occurred once or oftener in im-
mediate ancestresses or blood-relatives (mother,
grandmother, aunts or sisters). In a case of quin-
tuplets (five at a birth) just recorded, the patient’s
mother had twice borne twins. Of course, in con-
sidering cases of two children at a time, it is not
always that the pair of babies are true twins— i.e.,
the product of one fecundation. These are called
coeval (equal-aged) twins. But the pair may
really be the result of two fecundations (super -
foetation), as in the recorded case where a white
woman bore at one birth a pure white child and a
mulatto.

The new law-court recently opened in St.
James’s-road, Sydney, is a vast improvement on
the grubby old structures in vvhien justice and
various other things have been hitherto dispensed.
It is finished in carved cedar, and both the court
and the adjacent apartments have been beautifully
furnished by Messrs Hordern Brothers, of Pitt-
street, Sydney.*
About the only circumstance that prevents
the present Government from sinking into insig-
nificance and oblivion is the large advertisements
one occasionally bumps up against, announcing
that owing to the repeal of the duties Mr. Ragtag
will hold a Preetrade Sale, and give his goods
away almost free of charge (for their full value in
coin of the realm). Pirst comes the Preetrade
sale, then the clearing sale, after which the bill of
sale brings matters to a climax. A notable excep-
tion to the above, however, is the establishment
known as the Misfit Parlor, where Mr. Nathan
Herman has introduced the latest novelty in sales
—the “ Bobby Dazzler.” Thousands of people are
being attracted daily to this Mammoth Ware-
house, which has been turned into a retail em-
porium, and they usually leave it rejoicing at the
genuineness of the magnificent bargains they re-
ceive, only to return next day for more. Mr.
Herman has a pile of letters (the postmarks on
which are convincing proof of their genuineness),
advising the arrival of bales of orders to country
customers, and expressive of the satisfactory
manner in which the orders were attended to.
It appears Mr. Herman personally superintends
this branch of the business, and he is exceptionally
particular that all orders shall be faithfully ful-
filled, and nothing shoddy sent to his country
clients. A reference to his advertisement in
another part of this paper will amply repay
the trouble, as the great bargains there enumerated
are certainly unheard of. His £2 bale is a marvel
of the nineteenth century ; his =£l dress bale, and
his wonderful household parcel for <£l are eye-
openers ; and the whole lot, combined with other
bargains too numerous to mention, fill a list which
is verily a bobby-dazzler. The goods are all
marked in plain figures, and Mr. Herman invites
anyone to compare his prices. Intending cus-
tomers should therefore call early.*

while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The V.R.C. autumn meeting, commencing on
the 29th, will get some benefit from the policy of the
rival V.A.T.C., which this year extended its February
programme over a couple of Saturdays. The Caulfield
meeting was a financial failure, partly owing to the
weather, but chiefly because the general public are tired
of the cronk racing at this paradise of “stiff” homes.
Nevertheless, the three principal Caulfield events at-
tracted attention to the Newmarket Handicap and Aus-
tralian Cup, so Melbourne is inclined to “ talk-horse ” just
now. Besides, star performers draw the crowd. Neither
Wallace nor Auraria ran at Caulfield, but these two good,
straight-going animals are almost certain ;at time of writ-
ing) to meet at Flemington. Now, the honest rivalry of
Auraria and Wallace can leaven a whole lump of ordinary
turf wickedness.
The present form of Mr. W. R. Wilson’s horses
was unknown to himself, he said, a week ago. Wallace,
like Challenger, has been reported amiss, but reports con-
cerning' the quiet St. Alban’s stable are worth very little.
If Wallace runs at Flemington these next few days, a fair
degree of “ fitness ” in that “ illustrious son of Carbine’’
may be taken for granted. Auraria has been freely re-
ported lame, yet the mare was going well on the track
last week. Auraria was never lame at all, the writer ven-
tures to say, never more than a bit sore, and soreness, as
evidence of steady preparation, is rather a satisfactory
complaint than otherwise. Presuming that the young
heroine will come forth fit and well for her first engage-
ment, The Bulletin herewith plumps for its Melbourne
Hup “ tip ” to win every weight-for-age race she attempts,
including the Champion Stakes. This is a large predic-
tion, but then Auraria is a great mare, and this journal
refuses to believe that any other animal can quite equal
her in a fast-run race over a fair distance. Should
Auraria not be in good form, owner James will yiot run
her out for all her engagements. When a sportsman has
an idol he doesn’t set it up to be ruthlessly shattered.
A confident tip for the Newmarket is excusable
only on the fact that the six-furlong handicap is run over
a straight, roomy course, where jockeys’ foul play gets
little chance to assert itself, and indifferent horsemanship
is of less consequence than in races round the oval. How-
ever, The Bulletin has no confident tip for this
notoriously uncertain raoe. It can’t see that Courallie
(the animal favorite at time of writing) has a strong
chance ; nor Bung-Bung, nor Cabin Boy, nor even Foliage,
although some Adelaide people swear by the alleged
slipperiness of this Malua—Verdure gelding. Foliage’s
form is not at all first-class thus far, and on paper the S.A.
fancy (at Bst. 31b.) is not in it with The Parisienne.
No doubt Hova, if started for the short race,
would beat at least 75 per cent, of the field. But he,
with Challenger and Laundress, declines to make the
journey. Take Tinstream, The Parisienne, Idolator,
Maluma, Acton, Mercia, and Homespun as a likely lot.
The sex, as a rule, makes a good display in the Autumn,
hence Gehenna, Maluma, Tinstream and Marcia are worth
consideration, whilst Idolator and the stylish Homespun
appear most important among the males. A reckless
guess in favor of Maluma, Gehenna, and Homespun may
turn out as well as most guesses. Redfearn’s Maluma is
an own sister to Malvolio, who appeared capable of im-
provement when she ran six inches behind Coil the other
Saturday. Also, she was injudiciously ridden on that
occasion, which, however, will count as a point against
her chance if the same young Redfearn rides her again.
* » * *
Hova, Lord Richmond, Waterfall, Idolator, or
the best from St. Alban’s should manage to capture the
Australian Cup among them. Of Idolator the Ballarat
sages say “ Back him and ’ave faith ’’—for the Newmarket
Handicap. The old ’un is a Newminster horse, and if he
can get as near to winning the short race as he got last
year he will surely give the 2f mile handicap a severe
shaking. Hova is not the best of stayers, perhaps, but
he’s fast enough to win a slow-run race over any distance,
under any reasonable weight. The writer prefers the best
of the two well-performed three-year-olds, Wallace and
Waterfall, with Idolator. Give us Wallace in his Spring
condition, and he will just about struggle home. A brave
stayer is Wallace, in spite of his cowardly color.
The Y. A.T.C. stewards did a reckless deed last
Saturday. After Lord Richmond had won the Autumn
Cup (1| miles) in handsome style, they remembered the
recent indifferent running of the horse at two petty
suburban meetings, and decided to report owner Eli
Jellett and his fickle steed to the V.R.C. It goes without
saying that Eli Jellett is one of the “ little ” men who
hasn’t been granted a special license to snap his fingers at
turf-critics. Lord Richmond is much less of an in-and-out
performer than 50 other horses that lose races by 50yds.
when they ought to win easily, and yet are never subjects
for official enquiry. The “scandalous” feature of this
case was the outside price at which L.R. started.
Had he been a warm favorite, carrying big men’s
little bits, his previous form might have escaped
remark. Since it didn't escape remark, The Bul-
letin will be glad to hear of the V.A.T.C. stewards drop-
ping upon big owners every time their horses are guilty
of a sudden improvement. Also Tiie Bulletin hopes to
hear of Eli Jellett dropping heavily upon the officials if
they neglect to tar all owners—including some of their
own little family party, if necessary with the same
brush. The Lord Richmond case is likely to prove a very
embarrassing precedent.
* * * «
Writes “ Scrip ” : —Two previous winners—
Hova and Laundress, have declined the Newmarket; also
Challenger, Warpaint, Gaillardia, and others reckoned to
have had a chance., The big crowd remaining include
my original five —Idolator, Foliage, Whakawatea, Dis-
parity, with Monard as a possible cockboat. N.S.W. is
miserably represented, but Whakawatea and Courallie
are sprinters of the right stamp. In a dash of this sort
it’s just as hard to locate the winner as it is to pick a
selling race in which none of the neddies are trying, but
Idolator or Foliage should prove the correct article, the
other trio being expected to run prominently at the right
end.
* * * *
The hack display made by Music in the Autumn
Cup staggered punters. His track gallops have been
second only to Hova’s, but he’s said to be a different horse
when playing for keeps.
* * * *
Y.A.T.C. Autumn Cup was a mere three-horse
race. The unprominent figure cut by the rest of the field
suggests a lot of tilings, but ere next week some will, no
doubt, improve sufficiently to finish well in Australian
Cup. Preston and Pilot Boy’s dead-heat for second pro-
vided the only semblance of a contest right through.
Lord Richmond had the race won before they started.
Even with his 101 b. penalty he can’t be deemed right out
of Australian Cup.
* * * *
A common current theme concerns the relative
merits of those two slashing youngsters, Coil and New-
haven. The former has lost his shy, maidenish ways, and
goes out for his gruel like an old stager. Some assert
that his badly-blocked opponent should have won Oakleigh
Plate. But Coil was blocked, tumbled twice and then
scored. The pair are above the average, and there seems
to be nothing much between ’em at present.
In the Ascot Vale and Sires Produce Stakes at
Flemington, Coil will 'meet Newhaven at an advantage,
the latter being fully penalised in both. The books
already see in the two nice betting-material for next Vic.
Derby and Cup.
* * * *
Owner Oxenham never ceased backing Pilot
Boy for the hurdles he won under a big weight on
V.A.T.C. opening day. P.B. is an undoubted flat and
obstacle gem. His brother, Cabin Boy, also running, will
likely not turn out so well. Full relatives of great horses
seldom do. They don’t seem to be sliced out of the same
side of bacon.
* * ♦ *
The Hova crowd preserves its horse admirably.
It pays acceptance-fees," but changes its mind. Hova was
well backed with the books for the Autumn Cup on
Saturday, but wasn’t saddled. He’s not lucky on the
Caulfield course, anyhow.

ordinary turf gambling. A “ beak ” settles your hash in

* * * *
Spider-legged, peacocky only-out-of-use-now-
and-again alleged racers ornament every racing-track and
paddock. One, perhaps, can’t stay ; another can’t race in
the mud ; a third would break down on a hard course ; and
“ when the handicap and the day and the track arrive to
suit the neddy it’s time to go and get a new horse.”
The M.L. ’chaser, Norton, is already being
roughly handled in minor steeplechases at ’Ome in the
matter of weight. When he meets the best of company
over stiff courses in the Nationals—well, if people over-
advertise their neddies they’ll have to pay for it.
A one-time M.L. writer, finding that he hadn’t
tipped a winner in his sheet for six months, started tick-
ing off horses that had “ no possible” in handicaps, and
selecting the worst as his particular choice. The system
turned out as good as any other, and people used to
wonder where he got his good information from about the
long-shot outsiders.

A “mug” accosted a bookie the day before a
meet and enquired what he’d lay about five horses in one
particular race, stipulating that he must have a run for
his cash in each case. Bookie hooked the rare fish at once,
offering Bto 1 all round, starting price. The mug knew
four of the five weren’t going to start, and that the other
was a “ cert.” So it was, and he thus got eights about a
6 to 4 chance.

Dear Bulletin, —Why republish “Delaware’s ”
petulant virulence against Musket and Musket blood?
When howling against Musket and asking what of his get,
bar Carbine, ever raced after it was 3yrs., “Delaware”
simply displays gross ignorance of his subject, and forgets
(if he ever knew) such marvellous mares as Necklace
(Musket —Locket), Mitrailleuse (Musket —Erycina). The
first-named ran Nelson the mighty to a head for the N.Z.
Cup at syrs., and Mitrailleuse was carrying such “ anvils”
as from 9st. to lOst. 31b. and winning in N.S.W. when she
was 5 and 6yrs. old. Moreover, Lochiel’s Newmarket was
looked upon all round as hers till the two owners agreed
not to cut one another’s throats. These are two of many
celebrities, but Muskets ran in Maoriland up to quite
recently successfully, and we have only to look to
Musket’s success with Locket, Sylvia, Onyx, and Erycina
and a host of other mares which failed to throw winners
to other perfectly-bred sires to be seized of his extraordi-
nary powers. What more do we need than the fact that
Anteros, a far more fashionably-bred horse than Musket,
had chances with some of the cream of Musket’s loves,
after Toxophilite’s son, and got Silver Prince and Niagara
—the only two worth a curse the Sylvia Park Stud Co.
ever bred from that incomparably-pedigreed sire. Martini-
Henry, Nordenfeldt, Trenton, Thunderbolt, Necklace,
Maxim, Matchlock, Krupp, Artillery, Mitrailleuse, Waitiri,
Foul-Shot, Derringer, Bangle, Tirailleur, Cuirassier, Belle
(who raced and won a steeple in her seventh year), Pearl,
Revolver, Cannon (not Hordern’s, but the M.L. grey),
Mary, Brigadier, and the great Carbine, are a few only of
Musket’s successes brought to mind at the moment. And
other imported sires, notably Anteros, Apreinont, Cado-
gan and Leolinus, had chances with the same dams, and
produced next to nothing. “ Delaware,” when writing
on general horse matters, is readable ; when he gets on
to his bete twir (Carbine beat him, when at syrs. he won
Melb. Cup under lOst. 51b. in record time), the Musket-
cim-Carbine strain, he’s simply a crank.—Yours, Tangata-
Maori.

A certain Southern bookie was recently induced
to attend the sports of a Sunday-school at which the bookie’s
youngster was a pupil. In one race the bookie, in a
friendly way, laid his friend odds on his (the bookie’s) son,
who was promptly donkey-licked by a Baptist parson’s
brat. “ Bli’ me I” exclaimed the disgusted penciller,” if
that there sky-pilot ain’t gone and stiffened that kid o’
mine 1”

The “Tasmanian fortnight” just over was an
unfortunate one for Victorian entries. Mischief, though

J. J. Miller is publishing the first six issues of
his Australian Racing Chronicle under one cover. The
book which, although plump, can be easily pocketed,
contains 446 pages of horse-performances, and 84 pages of
index, and is far and away the most complete record ever
published in Australia. It incl udes lots of meetings which
have hitherto been haughtily ignored by slow-going com-
pilers of this style of literature.

The promoters of the Australian Eleven are con-
fident that their men will lick the strongest team of
“ throw-outs ” it is possible to pit against them. Other-
wise, they wouldn’t be arranging a farewell test-match,
which is expected to draw a big gate, and serve as a good
advance ad. for the Eleven’s tour in England.

The Vic. eleven, by far the better team, was
beaten by the weather (and S. Aus.) by 10 wickets.
* * * *
“Jonah’s” performance, six wickets for 15 runs
against Vic. in the second innings, augurs a good time for
hum on fiery English wickets. But English batsmen will
go out and force the game, not stand (as the Vic’s did) like
sheep to be slaughtered. By the way, there isn’t one
forcer in the present Aus. Eleven’s file of batsmen.

very much mixed up, and he would address the crowd :
“ I’m the boss ! They come to see me in thousands !
When I go out and begin to lift ’em” “What,
pints?” said a juvenile, and the great man subsided.

There was niuch discontent in Adelaide over
Ferris’s inclusion in the S.A. eleven. He had only been
in Adelaide a few weeks, and, although the other pro-
vinces gave Way, it is certainly straining a point to play
him as a South Australian this season. Peg-leg, by the
way, took 2 wickets for 120 runs for Norwood against
Adelaide—a miserable performance.

Lord Hawke’s English cricket team, now visit-
ing South Africa, went to visit the field of battle at
Krugeisdorp, and were all arrested by the Boers for some
reason unexplained. After a little while they were let go
—also for a reason unexplained.
A strict regulation is that none of the Aus.
Eleven shall contribute to the press. I’resuiued, though,
that long letters to “ friends” will appear, as usual.

S. A. cricketer Darling is an enthusiastic lacrosse
player, and while in Melbourne for the recent match
made arrangements for a term of Victorian lacrosseurs to
visit Adelaide during the coming winter.

Fitzsimmons’s victory over Maher should cause
him to name the Irish heavy-weight ‘‘the welcome
nugget.” A purse of 10,000 dollars, the Police Gazette
championship belt, and a side wager of 5000dols. is a
splendid scoop for one minute’s work. Now Slavin wants
to fight Fitzsimmons for ±lOOO aside ; Fitz. should win.
He has never yet had a real whipping. The red-headed
Timaruttian blacksmith is a marvel. Physically, a gaunt
skeleton covered with parchment; all his tissue sheer
sinew. A magnificent boxer and a steady liver, with a
lightning peiception and an ice-cold temper. Fitzsimmons
looks to be champion of the world.
» * * »
Maher’s rocketty downfall is a nasty knock for
the blustering- Corbett, who handed the Irishman a title
which wasn't his to hand.

The “ noble art ”is dead in Sydney. Four men
paid a shilling each to see the M‘Grath-Hope contest, and
had their money returned. Also, the Foster-Simpson go,
which was to have come off last Monday, fell through
because of empty chairs and benches. Barker, when he
laid Placke out, killed the laying- goose outright. Sydney
pugs can now command anything sooner than the public
and its money. Athletes can no longer be cajoled into
.fighting before a £lOO house for “ toffy.” And the public
seem dead sick of a sport with the most blackguardly sur-
roundings which ever disgraced a civilised community.

Tut Ryan, the heavy-weight pugilist, is just
back in Meib. from Johannesburg, and gives a graphic
account of the Krugersdogp fight, in which he officiated
as timekeeper, or something, from the security of an
overlooking hill. Tut took no part in the fight, being con-
tent, like the war-horse of Scripture, to smell the battle
from afar. Bruiser Goddard, it seems, held the position
of a staff-captain in the Uitlander army which never did
anything-, and had command of 500 men. The moment
the news that Jameson was approaching- reached
Johannesburg, says Ryan, the police were withdrawn for
fighting purposes, and the whole place was given up to
the gangs of spielers who infest it. Traffic was stopped,
and all along the main streets the three card man, the
monkey-trick and all the rest of the innocent accessories
of the racecourse reigned supreme.

Dear Bulletin, —The scribe who refers to Par-
sons as “the much-over-rated Parsons” is a trifle out.
“ The much-gone-off Parsons ” would possibly have been
true, but a man who has knocked off a mile in 2min. 2sec.
on a poor track like the dull Exhibition Oval, who has put
up a world’s grass record of 5 miles, and who has defeated
Zimmerman, is certainly not over-rated when he is ex-
pected to defeat anything we have in Australia now.—M‘G.
+ * * *
Parsons, riding well last Saturday at Adelaide,
won the first-class mile. “ Jack ”is a brilliant rider, but
many of his best friends think he has a little bundle. It’s
a certainty that the heavy-jawed Yankee Martin hasn’t
even the shadow of a bundle, and therefore the match on
March 28 between the two is odds on Martin.
• » ♦ *
Parsons’s new Australian mile record—2min.
3sec. —will probably be broken on the Sydney Agricul-
tural Society’s track before very long. By the way,
Megson, it is said, is coming on again—the old Megson,
who claimed to do a mile in 2min. on the Adelaide track.
* * * *
“Jack” Fitzgerald, the Vic. ex-champion
amateur sculler, who scales only a little over lost., rides
the highest-geared cycle in Australia, his racing jigger,
locally-made, being fitted with the enormous gear of 102 in.
Zim raced with only a 68-gear, and Pither, who rode with
a 92-gear when he beat Zimmerman, held the gear record
up to Fitz’s time.

Mrs. H. P. Nicholls, a Melb. long-distance
cyclist, lately turned off 176 miles in a day, doing the
AVarrnambool-Melb. journey between 1.30 a.m. and 9 p.m.
During a nine days’ trip the same lady pedalled over 689
miles.
* * * *
A Melb. cycling paper publishes a pageful of
weird photos of knobby knees and bulgy calves, alleged
to belong to prominent local wheelmen, and offers a
guinea to the enthusiast who first guesses the owners.
Any odds that the prize will go to one of the impetuous
damsels who throng the reserve on the days of cycle-
meets, and heave bouquets at their heroes. Apropos,
how about a competition the other way round ?
* * ♦ *
Bicyclists in long-distance races, especially paced
races on cold days, often find that toward the close their
vision becomes so much impaired as to spoil their steering,
even to making them run into other machines. The cause
is the friction of the air on the sensitive eye-surfaces,
which brings on numerous bleedings from the small
vessels.
* * * *
M‘Lean, who won the Vic. 10-mile champion-
ship, is not in the trade ! Possibly this fact will not hold
long, as every second Melb. shop' just now is a cycling
establishment, and every proprietor and agent is on the
look-out for good advertising talent. M'Lean is still an
infant, and his pa is Mayor of Northcote.
* * * *
The League of American Wheelmen proposes to
abolish the “ amateur ” and let every racing man run for
cash or trophy as he pleases, thus placing all men on one
satisfactory level.

Stanbury, who goes ’Ome to row Harding for
£5OO and the world’s championship, if he has any venera-
tion for “ dear old England,” will allow Harding to take
the belt and the cake. And he will do this also if he has
any love of sculling for its own sake. Sculling, as far as
the British people are concerned, has been damned with
cold neglect ever since the British champions were per-
sistently “taken down” by Americans and “colonials.”
Before that it was a noble British sport, and heaps of
money were spent upon it, and the expert sculler was
abundantly glorified. Now, the cold, proud British
person scarcely recognises it. Pugilism, too. upon which
the Britisher so prided himself when British pugs could
thump creation, is no longer vaunted with patriotic
enthusiasm in English papers and English conversation as
“the manly art” and “the noble British sport,” since
British champions have been systematically wiped out by
Yanks and Australians. If- Stanbury allows the cham-
pionship to go back ’Ome, sculling will boom again in
England, and will rise again to the dignity of being re-
garded by Britishers as a peculiarly British institution
by Jove. And then Australians will be able to make a
little money out of it.

Hanlan and Searle met once only. The dav
before the Grafton Regatta of ’BB, the Canadian came
across a novice in practice, and, getting into conversation
learned that the country-boy was to row against him in
next day’s race. Partly through curiosity, partly in fun
he asked for a spin. He got it, and a beating. To the’
disappointment of the public, Hanlan did not start next
day. He contented himself with backing the novice.

A very well-known Melb. man, who would
gamble his soul, lately had the bailiffs in. He paid the
debt and got his receipt after the bailiff had been “there”
three days, but the latter would not shift unless he got
his fees besides. The debtor sized the bailiff up aim
offered to play him euchre for double his fees. Now that
bailiff fancied he knew more about euchre than any living
man indeed, he was an ex-euchre spieler. So, after satis°-
fymg himself that the debtor had the double fees about
him, they started it, and within 25min. the debtor had not
only won back the debt and fees in cash but the broker
had to leave an IO U for £5 odd. How the bailiff settled
with the other crowd doesn’t worry the debtor, as he got
full receipts for everything. •' °

Syd. Gregory was married last Monday.


Ex-detective Eason died last week in Mel-
bourne.' He was about the last of the old school,
the first Melb. “D’s,”and indeed even the iden-
tities thought him long dead. Eason, Black, and
Williams were the best-known men, but Eason
retired from the metropolis long before the other
two, about 30 years ago. These three were
Aspinall’s chief butts in cross-examination, and
they all entertained a very low opinion of his wit.

“About ten years ago, while engaged in

and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever 1 since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at'times, to wear a bandage. About
a year ago it became much worse, and I
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did so, and after taking four
bottles the ■swelling disappeared, and 1 have
nbt been troubled with it since.”

MY ROSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oft in a garden I have found
A rose that nestled to the sound
Of waterfalls from shadowy hills,
Bourne across the hidden rills ;
Music that has sweeter been
That its cradle is unseen.
She upon her slender perch
Wavers to bird-bills that search
In her coronet for beads
Showered from Eve’s dusky bredes ;
While some coppice-hidden bird’ll
Scatter round her for a girdle
Tangles of his throbbing soul
Por some poet to unroll.
From tier petals I have drawn
Incense waiting for the dawn,
Or to float upon the rain
If the South wind comes again.
To ifiy lips each petal lies
Limpid as my dearest’s eyes—
Eyes more beautiful by far
Than the glow of evening’s star
When her aureole is strewn
Underneath the sickle moon.
Then I leave her in the gloom,
Swooning to her own perfume.
Ah ! my spirit, when I come,
As the next day neareth home,
And my rose of all the brood
Has been plucked by fingers rude !
Thou, that art an opening bud,
By each spirit to be wooed
That cherisheth the ancient lore
To love, and to love evermore,
The beautiful: Oh ! that I could
With thee inherit solitude !
But afar my steps must go,
Thou, perhaps, wilt never know
The fulness of my quiet pain,
Aching that when I come again,
Thou, .of all rosebuds’ diadem,
Mayst have been taken from thy stem !
HUBERT CHURCH.
THE PEASANT’S PEDIGREE.
Sneers my lord with smile superior as he boasts
his “ noble ” line ;
Shows the pictures of his fathers—silken robe
and ruffle fine,
Points to miles of glades and forests green beneath
the ambient air,
Which the sovereign gave the subject when he
found his wife was fair.
Can we claim a higher lineage ? In the marshes
and the brake
Thence to vex the human l-obber lurked bold
Here ward, called the Wake.
Prom the South with hundreds following to
avenge the peasant’s shame,
Dark despair and deep dishonor, martyred Wat
the blacksmith came.
Brave Jack Cade, who led the masses in a fierce
and hungry tide,
Honest Wilkes, the king-denouncer, and a thou-
sand more beside ;
Toil-worn hands and heavy faces, but they lived
to set us free :
Lo, the ancestors of Demos—this the Peasant’s
Pedigree !
Maoriland.

A SOUTHERLY IN SYDNEY.
The morning broke fair,
Not a move in the air,
And the citizens’wives heard the citizens swear.
The astronomers, they
Heard the mercury say
“ I must make up my mind for some climbing to-
day :
Yes, this is a proper thermometer day.”
It’s oh for a Southerly rushing and free,
It’s oh for a Southerly fresh from the sea,
It’s oh for a Southerly out on a spree :
A Southerly Buster, aho !
The heat settled down
On the sweltering town,
And the citizens liquored, their troubles to drown.
Their foreheads they fanned,
Cursing climate and land,
While the mercury hurried up, hand over hand.
It’s oh for a Southerly rolling along,
It’s oh for a Southerly merry and strong,
It’s oh for its cheery and bellowed-out song,
A Southerly Buster, aho !
At last, when the thirst
Of the city was worst,
With a rush the uproarious Southerly burst.
He had cooled every gust
On the Pole’s icy crust,
And for that they all blessed him in spite of
the dust.
It’s oh for a Southerly, though he may thresh
The dust into storm, he is sturdy and fresh,
He is soothing of spirit and cooling of flesh,
The Southerly Buster, aho !
Sydney.

A Railway Romance .
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
’Twas but a little trembling maid,
A Vandemonian lass,
Who trained it all alone, afraid
(As Yandemonians are, ’tis said,
In spite of all their gas),
From Hobart unto Launceston—
What was her little heart set on ?
A trembling maid of nineteen years,
A poutress shy and soft;
A seltzogene of ready tears,
Of nineteen harvest-tides of fears !
We do not meet such oft !
Into her train, as it began,
There stepped a horrid, hairy man !
The night was cold ; the train was slow,
As only trains can be ;
The hairy man was kind, for, oh !
He lent his trav’ling-rug, and so
He fairly frightened She—
This baby of the nineteen years,
Who’d read of railway buccaneers.
The hairy man (put this in print)
For Coughing Mixture reached ;
’Twas aniseed and peppermint—
He took a swig ; she took a hint,
And up she got and screeched !
Jumped off the flying train ! By Jo '
It’s lucky Tassy’s trains are slow.
Yes, Vandemonian trains are slow,
And Yandy girls are quick !
She wasn’t hurt a bit, on, no !
She overhauled the big loco.
In quite a fashion slick ;
And gave the hairy man in charge
For drinking Cough Drops thus at large.
Perchance Hysteria had a dream,
For frozen print too warm ;
Leastways, Nineteen explained her scream,
Narrating a neurotic scheme
Including chloroform !
The brightest fancies, one may see,
Of shy Nineteen “gang oft agley.”
The Balkan war-scribes tell a tale
About a market-place
A-crowd with virgins, huddled, pale ;
With troops in charge. A waiting wail—
Then Spokesmaid puts the case :
“ Oh ! sir, when does the violence
That we are waiting for commence ? ”
Dear Maidens of the Heart-shaped Isle,
That men are men is true ;
But let Hysteria not beguile
Your fancies into horror’s wile,
And here’s a truth for you :
Men seldom lurk to take a chance
Unless you make the sign, “ Advance ! ”
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Some idea of the force of the recent
cyclone in Townsville may be gathered from the
circumstance that black seagulls were blown
inland for some miles and perished. The nearest
islands inhabited by these gulls are 1000 miles
away.
Petition from an Indian native to an Eng-
lish official: —
O’nerd Master,—Having heard of you Almighty mercy
and loving kindness to us worms, I tell you my circum-
stances. By the Grace of God and your Lordship, I have
seven children, all babes and sucklings, besides this
abominable litter I have many male and female relations.
What have I done to be blessed with such cursed trials.
As your Lordship is my father and my mother, I write to
request that you will take this worm and wife and suckles
and relations, both male and female, and provide for us
from your bounty at a remuneration of rupees 20 a
month. I can’t read or write, and have only the suckle
qualifications and male relations and feminine, but by the
grace of your Almighty Lordship I look forward to years
of prosperity and happiness. All the “ chaoni ” of
sing of your praises, your justice and mercy. Therefore
call us all that we may fatten on your gentleness. Call
quickly.—Your faithful worm and beast,
Munni Lall,
Despicable brute and unwilling father of babies.
Another Indian servant, a major domo, writes in
the tradesmen’s account-book kept by him for his
master “behind leg of ship” (meaning leg of
mutton), “bullock milk” (meaning cow’s milk,
not from buffalo), and “foodings for little dog’s
child ” (meat for puppies).


i- C. J. Martin, of Sydney University,
lias published a 130 pp. paper on snake-venom
and its action. Snake-poison taken into the
stomach has, lie says, no effect whatever unless
some damage to the walls lets it into the circula-
tion. Venom injected acts more quickly when
the subject has a full stomach than when fasting.
It a fatal dose be injected directly into a vein, all
blood in that vein will in Umin. clot into a solid
P j A. emulation is stopped by the clotting,
and the animal dies of thrombosis. If the venom
be slowly injected, as through a prick from a pin
in the skm, the blood tends to coagulate, but
never becomes fatally clotted ; in fact, in a
couple of hours a reaction sets in and the blood loses
all coagulativepower. In the case of rapid injection
directly into a vein, Calmette’s new chloride of
lime treatment, I)r. Martin says, is valueless;
likewise, if the blood has only slightly lost its
coagulability, a few drops of chloride of lime will
cause it immediately to solidify, and the animal
dies in a few minutes of excessive thrombosis.
Venom attacks the red corpuscles of the blood
and utterly dissolves them, probably thus pro-
ducing a new and very powerful poison ; likewise,
it causes the white corpuscles to burst. Also,
when the corpuscles are thus rendered hors de
combat, the poison attacks the walls of the vessels
and capillaries, and causes much hemorrhage into
the lungs and internal organs. Also, the heart
becomes pai’alysed. All these experiments show,
contends Dr. Martin, that strychnine is valueless
absolutely, chloride of lime practically worthless,
and that the only likely remedy lies in immunisa-
tion by serum-therapy.

THE
Ang-elus Symphony.
T'HE Symphony is a keyboard instrument for general use an( j
is also an automatic instrument reproducing mechanically
the notes of any music supplied. Thousands of pieces have been
prepared for the instrument and new selections continually
added, embracing the writings of the celebrated composers of
the past and composers of the present day, combining classical
operatic, sacred, dance and popular music, all of which can be
performed upon the Symphony by a person having no know-
ledge whatever of music. While this is a wonderful advance-
ment over any in charncal instrument heretofore made there is
m connection with the Symphony additional possibilities which
commend it to the educated musician. *
The Symphony is fast becoming a factor in the conservatory
of music. The correct reading of a difficult passage iu avS
or instrumental piece can be taught more readily to the pupi
fiom a demonstration upon the instrument than'by any other
method of instruction. Practice has proved this. er
Every Set of Reeds in the Symphony is operated by the Kev
board; also every set is brought into use by the Automatic
attachment, whereby the full power of the instrument is
obtained if used either way. " enl 18

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
Girder's Little Joke .
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Girder was our fellow-passenger’s name,” said
Harrison as he filled his pipe. “We christened
him hestive Girder—partly on account of his
dismal appearance, but more because of a curious
(lamt he had of making miniature coffins. It
appears he had a mania for seeing corpses, and he
told us gruesome yarns about his visits to public
morgues, hospitals, and, in fact, any pl ace where
he could view a body.’ He had a collection of
photographs showing corpses of both sexes and all
ages in every stage of decomposition. He would
narrate with evident gusto how he had managed
to get a sight of the deceased in every house
within a radius of some miles from his lodgings
He was like a crow—could smell death at anv dis-
taker’ turned U P as punctually as the under-
“Wf wer ® b 7 no means squeamish, but some of
Girders realistic descriptions were too much for
us, and an hour of corpse conversation was gener-
ally sufficient for the day. As there were no
opportunities for directly indulging his passion on
board, he sought an outlet in the manufacture of
small coffins, begging chips of wood from the car-
penter and working them up into perfect little
gems of caskets. He had a stock of pins, small
entomologists specimen-pins, from which he made
very good imitation coffin-nails, and each article
he turned out was perfect in detail. He had them
m cedar mahogany, pine, and oak. He covered
them with black or blue stuff, painted, varnished,
or I rench-polished them. He cut out bright little
tm plates and engraved particulars of the name
and age of an imaginary deceased on them. Not
a single detail escaped his careful fingers, and
when the coffin was finished he constructed a
corpse to fill it.
He got thick slices of bread from the steward
toasted them slightly, and, picking out the dough,
worked it up into an extraordinarily-realistic
corpse. After placing it in the coffin he pinked
out white paper, pasted it round the upper edges,
and laid the lid beside it. He had names for all
his defuncts, and would place them in a row in
order of date of construction, and observe how the
process of decomposition was getting on. And
that dough lent itself to the deception in a most
remarkable way. Owing to the wet state of the
ship it rapidly became mouldy, and developed a
green or black fungoid growth that gave the
little figures a horrible appearance. The mouth
would crack sometimes, and the nose fall flat-
pah ! It was a beastly fad.
“ He seemed to be shy of showing his talent to
the skipper or the officers, and they never got an
inkling of his mania, until one unlucky day some
devil of mischief put it into his head to'play' a joke
on the second mate —Coullet by name—a swarthy-
looking pirate who might have been a Creole or a
feouth Sea Island half-caste. There was just
enough tarbrush in him to show in his eyes, his
fingernails, and his brown skin, but not enough to
‘ place ’ him definitely.
“ Well, Girder might have had more sense than
to try his hand on Coullet, but he had just com-
pleted a very beautiful coffin, and had beaten out
a threepenny-piece to make a real silver name-
plate, and some infernal prompting led him to
engrave the second mate’s name on the plate. As
an additional touch of the realistic he blackleaded
the dough corpse. He was so tickled with the
whole conceit that he actually laughed—the first
time since he came aboard.
He took the miniature dead mate awav after
showing it to us. Jack howled after him : ‘ Don’t
let him see that or there will be trouble.’ Girder
°, n y ginned and all through tea that evening he
chuckled softly, especially when his eye fell on
Oouilet who was plying a good knife and fork on
e cold mutton—especially knife, for he had his
own sheath-knife at work. He always used it,
although the steward placed an ordinary dinner-
knife for his use, and to see him conveying
a cargo of turned peas down his throat on that
curved blade was apt to startle you.
“ Coullet, as usual, had finished first, and went
straight from the saloon to his cabin. We were
rounding off with the cheese, when a hoarse scream
rang through the ship. We sat still for quite a
minute, listening, and then the skipper said:
Someone s hurt,’ and half rose from his seat, but,
at that moment, a man burst into the saloon,
staggered to the table, and, grasping the cloth
with both hands, stood swaying backwards and
orwards, trying to articulate in a sputtering way
through the froth on his lips, while great beads of
perspiration poured from his forehead on to the
cloth.
r 'J’ as Coullet, but Coullet white, even to the
lips. Ihe skipper was at his side in a moment,
and soon we had him up on deck, and freshened
up a little with a stiff glass of brandy.
‘‘ He recovered sufficiently to point towards his
cabin and groan out, ‘ My God, look there ! ’ '
Ihe skipper went first, and we followed,
leaving Coullet in the care of the steward. On
reaching the second mate’s berth, we found the
door open, the lamp turned rather low, and, Ivin"-
m the bunk, with the bedclothes neatly folded
under it, was Girder’s latest coffin, with the black
corpse placidly grinning behind the pinked-out
white paper.
The skipper looked very serious. He took up
the ugly toy, looked it carefully over, opened the
port and threw it overboard. Then he turned to
us and said quietly : ‘ This may perhaps strike one
of you gentlemen as very funny, but I dan assure
you it is no laughing matter to play a practical
joke of this kind on a man like my second officer.
1 will not ask which of you did it, but will warn
him, whoever he is, to keep it to himself.’
Girder looked rather sick, but ‘ kept on saying
nothing, and it seemed as if the matter was going
to blow over. More, apparently, to save himself
from the results of a disturbance than to protect
Girder, the skipper had told “Coullet that there
was nothing to be seen in the bunk, and had
almost persuaded him that he was suffering from
a niline.nation on that particular evening, when
Girder s unlucky star came into the ascendant
once more. \
‘‘lt. was a fine day—an unusual occurrence—
and Girder wiis perched up forward whistling the
Dead M irch in ‘ Saul ’ —about the only tune he
could whistle intelligibly-when Coullet passed by
m a had temper, and roughly asked him to ‘ tie a
string to that rotten tune and hang it.’ Girder
felt huffed at the mate’s manner, and was getting
up in a dignified manner to go aft, when a tin
coffin-plate which he had been engraving fell
rattling from between his knees to the deck and
right to Coullet’s feet.
“The second mate stooped to pick it up, but
directly he saw what it was he whipped out his
sheath-knife and sprang on Girder with a howl of
ra ?< e v
“ Girder was taken by surprise, and the knife
went in between his ribs with a curious little
bubbling sound. He uttered a kind of sob and
fell where he stood, and Coullet pulled the knife
out and flung it overboard.
“ The mate was grabbed and put in irons, and
we did what we could for Girder, but it was no
use. He died in an hour from hemorrhage, and if
he could have watched them he would have been
grieved to see how quickly his obsequies were got
over. When we got to port, Coullet changed liis
irons for a cell, but these warm-blooded men fret
among cold stones, and he didn’t last out his sen-
tence.
. “And see this ? ” said Harrison. “That’s one
of Girder’s coffins I saved when the rest were
thrown overboard, and kept as a memento.”
“Ugh!” said Moxley, who had a tender
stomach, “pass the whisky.”
G. F. BASSET HULL.
A ball and supper have been given out at
Hillston, N.S.W., to aid the fund for presentation
to a retiring clergyman.
An important appeal case, Piper v.
RN.S.W., was argued at Sydney before Judge
Windeyer last law term. His Honor reserved
judgment, and sailed for England without deliver-
mg it. The consequence is that the work has all
to be done over again ; the suitors’ time and the
time of the court is wasted, and the lawyers’ fees
are doubled to no purpose. Could not Judge
Windeyer have cleared up his arrears before he
took his holiday ? There is a growing feeling that
the long vacations, the frequent holidays, and the
more frequent whims of N.S.W\ Judges might be
advantageously restricted. Some of them have
proved very unprofitable public servants. Cer-
tainly, to a Judge, every consideration should be
shown ; but, in comparison with their colleagues
in other provinces, do not N.S.W. Judges demand
a little too much ?
Dear Bulletin, —Have just, been a-strol-
ling through the Victorian country—a “before-
breakfast ” walk, so to speak —spying out the
nakedness of the land. At Sunbury the grazing
paddocks looked from a little distance like ploughed
land, so bare are they. Here I first observed
the cattle eating horse-dung, both fresh and stale.
The bunburyites are (have to be) economical—
they subsequently use the dried cow-dung as fuel,
wood being practically non-existent. One sees
the children out of an evening gathering fuel for
the morning’s fire. A trifle further out bunny
puts himself in evidence; and the abundance of
rabbits this year is due less to the retrenchment of
inspectors than to the dry winter. Witness also
the exceeding plentifulness of ants. Between
Lancefield and Kilmore the “cookies” have
been using poison regularly, and still the rabbits
are thick. One man poisoned a furrow 200
yards long outside a patch of amber-cane, just
above the Deep Creek : he got a crop of 240
bunnies next morning. Trappers are doing fairly
well. Sixpence a pair for export, if prime, less
freight to Melb. and charges. Please take a long
breath. A farmer (Jas. Cottam) living on the
aforesaid Deep Creek lost a heifer through her
eating poisoned rabbit —such is the scarcity of
grass ; and other cows have also been seen nibbling
at them. At Whittlesea a man bought three
cows—not old, but poor—for 6s. a-piece. He
intends to sell the hides and feed his pigs on the
boiled-down carcases. Verily, it has been a dry
season ; another such, and Victoria would have to
drop dairying and breed rabbits for export (which
last may come some day).—F. C. Feb. 6.
A Tight Place .
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Twenty years ago, in N.Q. The Boomerang,
then one of the A.S.N. Co’s crack steamers run-
ning to Cook town, had gone ashore on the South
Barnards, 40 miles north of Rockingham Bay.
Up came the order, “Lighter her,” and we
gathered half-a-dozen ketches and lightered her,
finding the cargo to consist of blankets, bottled
beer, and some fearful champagne manufactured
m the regions of the “ Suez Canal,” Lower George-
street.
Up came the further order, “ Sell salvaged
cargo by auction.” And we sold it; you bet we
sold it—without reserve. Cases of beer and porter
averaged Is. 6d., and champagne 2s. The labels
were off the bottles ; their outsides were foul and
muddy, but their insides ! It was summer time,
and we were thirsty. There was no competition,
for there were 600 cases; and the population
numbered 180.
I hen for a fortnight ensued pandemonium.
Every man reverted to the customs of his simian
ancestors, and went about on all fours. In the
middle Gov. Normanby called in on his farewell
round of visits, and a long string of quadrupeds
crawled painfully up the half-mile jetty to meet
him, headed by the pilot, for the P.M. was in bed
suffering from fever and ague. Normanby gazed
m wonderment. “ Good heavens, men !” he cried,
“ don’t kneel to me. I’m not the QUEEN —only
her viceroy ; get up, get up.” It took half an hour
and a bushel of hiccoughs to explain that we
couldn’t.
. % heaven ! it was the tightest place ever I was
m—and oh ! that I were 20 years younger and had
to go through it again !
Lithgow.
YARRAN.
“ The complaints of the people are always
just.”—Mirabeau.
Jingo—-but true. At the time of the
Sedan capitulation in 70 a crowd of excited
foreigners congregated outside Melb. Age office,
and when the fateful wire was posted a scene
followed incomprehensible to English-speaking
persons. Eat Germans fell on the bosoms of lean
Germans and wept; young Germans grasped both
the hands of old Germans while they sang snatches
of the Wacht am Rhine.” But when one stout
Bavarian in spectacles and lager beer at the rear
of the crowd started to dance and yelled in Eng-
lish, “Ve vill be in Lonn-donn next ! Ve vill be
in Lonn-donn next ! ” a nuggety Lancashire black-
smith, with a neck of mighty diameter, caught the
gist of the German’s threat and asked the “ blanky
Dutchman ”to say that again. The Bavarian did
say it again, and then he got “one on the jaw.”
That started the trouble, and in three minutes a
general German-English row was afoot. A few
police came along but were powerless to cope with
the angry crowd, and the Governor, who was pass-
ing at the time, being a sportsman, had his car-
riage drawn up to the footpath while he watched
things to a conclusion. England, in strong force,
ultimately triumphed, and the hospital report the
following day was filled with items like “ Carl
bchinidt, torn ear ; August Himmelstrahlende,
contused eye,” and other words to that effect. In
view of the recent disagreement between Hing-
land and Germany, the recounting of a little inci-
dent like this may do much to pour oil on the
troubled flames.

The Queen of Clubs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I The fortune-teller noticed in the interim of card-
shuffling that her client was very young and dark ;
also, that the white, clenched hand on the grimy
table-cloth had a wedding-ring on it. Madame
contemplated her own tawny fist and sighed.
Then, in the jargon of the seer
“ Blue eyes he has, and very fair. The king ol
diamonds must be your husband ? ”
The girl shut her lips and nodded. Again the
cards were shuffled and cut in three places.
“You are queen of clubs, because your eyes are
brown. See where the knave of spades crosses
the king of diamonds ? ” (
“ Knave of spades,” muttered the queen, why
is he a spade ?”
“ He is dark.”
“How dark?” ,
“ Spade-dark—dark as the pit. Dear me, and
the knave loves the queen of clubs ; but his heart
is bad : small hearts —bad hearts ! ”
“ He loves me ! ” whispered the queen, her eyes
aglow in the dusky room.
“ Beware of him! ” droned Madame; he hates
the king of diamonds ! ’ T
‘ ‘ But he loves me ! ” gasped the queen. lsn t
that enough ? ”
“ You are wet! ” said the queen at the ricketty
gate. Her hand sought the man’s dripping coat.
Very dark he was and very young. He glanced
round the bare room and shivered.
“No fire to dry me. Good God ! ” The queen
closed the door softly.
“The wood hasn’t come yet, dear. She was
very close to him ; her lips touched his cheek.
Outside, the loud, ceaseless calls of the city and
the eternal grind of traffic. A handful of dead
marguerites under the battered casement lay half-
hid under a cairn of road-metal the urchins had
flung in at the cats.
He limped to the tawdry book-case, as it to
select something, then stopped, his back to her,
and his hand uplifted. , . ~
“ I met —I met him to-day. He turned at the
sharp breath-expulsion behind, but the queen was
only dusting chairs.
“You met him?” . ,
“ Yes, him ; he followed me with his buggy
until we reached a back street. I heard the
damned sovereigns chink in his pocket when he
got down. Wish to God ! ” ,
“ Sovereigns ! ” interrupted the queen. He s
a diamond-man, and wears them anywhere in
the back of his shirt, in his bangle ; I’m not sure
that he hasn’t them set in his teeth—and his
boots. I don’t think he’s civilised, and I coiddn t
help running away from a husband like that
now’, could I, Jack?”
The knave rubbed at some greasy spots on his
vest.
“ Of course you couldn’t. ”
“ What did he say, Jack ? ” The knave dropped
into a chair, mopping his white, nervous face.
“ He’s going to divorce you.”
“Is that all ? ” The queen laughed—an agree-
able, well-pitched woman’s laugh. He watched
her in his dull-eyed way, without passion or
interest. Her laugh conjured up a curious inner
vision of the cheated husband, and then of him-
t,elf —dragged on to a dead lee-shore by the strange
force of this woman ! .
The queen took up a candle, setting it near the
window, but the wind came in the rattling case-
ment and guttered it immediately. They were
in the dark again.
“What are you doing?” He sobbed out a
fretful oath.
The flare of a pawnbroker’s lamp opposite caught
her in its angle of light, and he saw that the queen
was smiling munificently—offering him something :
he stretched out his hand and felt her wedding-
ring drop into his palm. “ Get yourself some
chops, Jack.”
And the knave went out.

ALBA DORION.
This from the window of a Russian Jew
bootmaker, recently arrived in Melbourne : “ Boots
and Shoes Repaired. Notice. 2d. paid to every
boy or girl who brings a pair to be soled and
heeled. For patches, Id.”
At Unley (S.A.), a parcel, containing a
bridle, pair of socks, towel, hairbrush, and a key,
was thrown into the police-station. A letter was
enclosed to this effect: —
On December 5, 1895, the enclosed were taken by a
young wild-oat-sower, in devilment, from Wolseley. Now
converted, he restores them with apologies : —Bridle, from
an open shed alongside a store, near Dunn’s ; socks, from
house nearly opposite Dunn’s ; towel, from next to the
sock place ; brush and key, from railway. All were taken
by a Melbourne profligate, for a lark, between 5 and 6
a.m. Under Salvation influences he is now converted,
and, having collected the articles, restores them through
the police.
There are in the world about 7,000,000
Jews. Jews contract fewer marriages, and have
a smaller birth-rate and mortality than other
races. Early marriages are more frequent, and
three times more marriages between relations are
contracted. More boys are born, and the number
of illegitimates and stillborn is smaller. Maxi-
mum death-rate is at over 60. Suicides are less
frequent. Are not predisposed to consumption
and cholera, but there is a decided tendency to
diabetes, hemorrhoids, and insanity. Deaf and
dumb, blind and daltonians are more frequent.
Majority inhabit towns, and the proportion of
poor is larger. Twins and triplets are less
common. Inter-marriages are sterile —cases of
illness are more frequent. Jews are of less phy-
sical development and lower stature.
The disputed territory on the Venezuela-,
Guiana border contains sundry curiosities such as
no other part of the known world can boast of.
These are a number of isolated mountains which
are wholly inaccessible unless perhaps by a
balloon. The best-known of them, Roraima, ha,s
absolutely perpendicular sides, and looks as if
even a fly could not get up without the aid of an
alpenstock. No man ever got up, so far as is
known, or, if he did, he never got down again.
The summit appears to be a table-land of about
130 square miles. A waterfall drops 2000 feet
sheer into the country below, so evidently there
are either lakes or rivers or both in this isolated
patch of country. Apparently the earth fell
away somehow from Roraima and the other moun-
tains of its kind long, long ago—millions of years
ago it may be, and whether there was any race of
human beings on top at the time, and if so,
whether their remote descendants are there now,
and what they may be like, and what kind of
language, religion and civilisation they have
developed on their lone mountain top, and how
they will receive the future explorer who gets
there per balloon, are all interesting problems.
Mate in Two Moves.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ Are you married, may I ask ? ”
A florid-faced, middle-aged, brusque-mannered
man fired this question in a loud, bullock-
driving voice, while crossing a main street in a
Sydney suburb, one afternoon lately.
The object aimed at was a fairly-made, but con-
siderably worn, young woman, of the domestic-
servant class. She had just emerged from the
gateway of a house in which she was employed,
and the catapulted question naturally startled her.
“ Excuse me,” proceeded the swain, advancing.
“ I know I’m a bit wrong, but I mean no
offence. If you’re not married an’ O, listen a
minute, I’ll show you it’s all right. But are you
married ? ”
“ Well, I’m not,” answered the girl.
“Then,” he said, “you’re just the figure of
woman I’m after.”
He had now come so close that shouting was no
longer necessary. . . ..
“Of course,” he continued, in a voice really
mellow and well-cadenced, “I don t ask you to
b’lieve what I say merely on my own word. D you
know the Rev. Thomas Stubbs ? He ’ficiates in
the brick place on the top o’ the hill. He lias
known me off an’ on for years. I was m the choir
when he first come out. He’ll tell you all you
want to know about me. D’you know Brown the
grocer at the Point ? He’s my cousin. Ive a
couple of hundred in cash, an’ can look the police
in the face. Pa’son an’ Brown ’ll certify that.
Think I’ll do ? ”
“ Eh ? ” he asked, after a pause.
“ But it’s so sudden ! ” the girl answered.
“ ’Tis.”
“ You are in a hurry ! ”
“ Say no, and I’m off again in the mormn .
“ But you don’t know even my name.”
“Tell ms that after. Take your ’davy,to the
Pa’son that you’re free in law, an’ that’s all I
want.”
The girl was silent. Long years of grimy slaving
lay away behind ; long, dim years full of terrors
stretched out before. Two dozen mistresses had
already passed over her head. A week or fort-
night with some, a' month with others, six months
or a year with more, and she was now on the
verge of twenty-eight. It was nearly all darkness;
darkness with splutterings of evil tempers and
suspicious natures, tyrannical dispositions and
imperious minds. It was all hard work, small
pay, little thanks and many insults ; fourteen
years of servitude and sorrow. And two dozen
mistresses and fourteen years more! Baker and
butcher are barely civil to her now ; in fourteen
years more the eyes of even these will be averted
from her!
Raising her head she said, “If what ye say s
true I’ll take ye.”
“ Good iron !” exclaimed the man, seizing her
hand. “ Come ’long up to Pa’son. I’ll stay out-
side while you go in an’ ask all ’bout me.”
On the way up hill they passed two old women,
one of whom, blinking at the other, said :
“See ’im ! ’im with Sarah Dooley! ’E was
courtin’ Minnie Jones for four year back, an’
wrote reg’lar when ’e went away. This last time
he made a heap o’ money, an’ came down to tie
the knot, but lo an’ behold, he found Minnie
married to a pleeceman. It was this momin’ ’e
found that out.”
KAPPA.
The Story of a Crime.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
They had been mates for two years—Tom and
Jack And now, down by the edge of the billa-
bong, they faced each other as enemies and
murder was in the heart of bom.
“So!” he growled. “You mean cur. lhis is
the reward of all I have done for you ? TJ , ,
Jack moved uneasily, but said nothing. Had he
spoken then-if it had been only one word-how
different the issue might have been! But he
maintained a sullen silence, a premonition of a
We’ve been mates together,” Tom continued,
speaking deliberately, as if he feared to let his
furious anger hurry his speech ; we ve been
mates together ever since we met in Queensland.
But never again, Jack, never again. I heres
them that excuse a thief, but I ain’t that sort of
man.” . ~ ,
He paused as if expecting some excuse. Perhaps
it was deadly fear that kept the others mouth
closed for he made no reply. He knew how
violent Tom could be when fairly roused, and he
had never seen him in such a furious temper before.
“ I’ve done more for you than I’d have done for
my own brother,” Tom went on. When we first
met you were down on your
stricken and parish-damned. I took you up, and
yet you steal off me. Why, I’d have given you
what you stole if you’d only asked for it. ”
He picked up a large stone. Jack remained
passive. He knew that Tom was so much the
stronger that resistance would be futile, and per-
haps the fear that was upon him rendered him
powerless. There was no hurry about the mur-
derer’s movements. He poised the stone for some
seconds, and eyed his victim.
Then he fastened it to the dog’s neck and threw
him into the water.
“ He won’t steal my liver-and-bacon again, I’ll
swear,” said Tom, as he watched, breaking on the
surface, the last bubbles from Jack’s lungs.
Z.E.F.
There is to be an election for Mayor at a
W.A. township shortly. There are two candi-
dates—Adams, the local milk-purveyor, and
Jones, the meat-merchant. Matters were quiet
until Adams said that Jones’s meat was frequently
alive after it was dead. Jones denied the resur-
rection, and said his meat did not spread typhoid,
anyhow, thus delicately suggesting that Adams’s
milk was not violets, anyway. The result was a
double challenge, and an expert was requisitioned.
He found that Adams’s milk, although particu-
larly powerful and deadly, was nothing as com-
pared with Jones’s meat ; and when this decision
was made public and the Jones and Brown factions
had successfully slaughtered each other, it was
decided to form an independent party and run
MTavish, the meek little storekeeper who
never, never sands the sugar, or sells athletic
butter, and is humble and pious. So M'Tavish
will probably head the poll.
