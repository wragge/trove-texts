VERSES ON LOVE
LOVE S A BEE.
Once I thought, but falsely thought,
Cupid all delight had brought,
And that love had been a treasure,
And a palace full of pleasure ;
But alas ! too soon I prove,
Nothing is so sour as love ;
That for sorrow my Muse sings.
Love’s a bee, and bees have stings.
When I thought I had obtained
That dear solace, which if gained
Should have caused all joy to spring,—
Viewed, I found it no such thing :
But instead of sweet desires,
Found a rose hemmed in with briars ;
That for sorrow my Muse sings.
Love’s a bee, and bees have stings.
Wonted pleasant life adieu,
Love hath changed thee for a new;
New indeed, and sour I prove it,
Yet I cannot choose but love it;
And as if it were delight,
I pursue it day and night;
That with sorrow my Muse sings,
I love bees, though bees have stings.
The Mirror of Knighthood (1599 .
SOME SAY THAT HISSING’S A SIN.
Some say that hissing’s a sin,
But I think it’s none ava ;
For kissing has wonned in this warld
Since ever there was twa.
O, if it wasna lawfu’
Lawyers wadna alloo it;
If it wasna holy,
Ministers wadna do it.
If it wasna modest,
Maidens wadna tak’ it;
If i wasna plenty,
Pirir folks wadna get it.
Chambers' Scottish Songs (1829).
THE KISS.
" I saw you take his kiss ! ” “ ’Tis true.”
“O, modesty ! ” “ ’Twas strictly kept:
He thought me asleep ; at least, I knew
He thought I thought he thought I slept.”

From “ The Quaint Comedy of Love, Woo-
ing and Mating ” (Dent), edited by Duncan
avid August Macdougall , two young Austra-
lians (married).
S a mu e l W alker Griffith, Chief Justice of
the High Court of Australia, has literally
translated into English verse Dante’s poem
upon a place that is slightly hotter than
Melbourne. As a specimen of the recrea-
teoll of the old age of a Chief Justice, take
the well-known picture of Satan chewing
sinners: 0
Wit trmWed yeS W ° Pt h ® 5 and on three china
Adown the weeping- and the bloody slaver
in every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
A sinner, in the manner of a flax-brake,
So that he thus kept three of them in dolor,
lo him in front the biting was as nothing
Matched with the clawing, so that oft the back-
bone
Was left entirely of its skin denuded.
‘-That soul above, who suffers greatest torment,
<.Vi7u called Iscariot,’ said my master
Who head within his legs without is plying :
Of the two others, those whose heads are down-
ward,
The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus •
See how he writhes, and not a word he utters : ’
Oassius the other one, who seems so lusty.”
Is it Australia, or modernity, or youth or
lust ignorance, that, thus prosaically and
literally translated, the picture seems a
comic one 7 The book is published by
Angus and Robertson, Sydfiey.
Frederic Manning has written a narrative
poem in blank verse, titled The Vigil of
Brunhild (Murray), which is one of those
needless, well-built, uninspired, smooth-
flowing Tennysonian renderings of medieval
subjects which young poets inevitably make.
THE HOME Fon BAD FOGS
IT is certainly rude of Ford Madox
Hueffer to purloin for his own use
our jealously-held theory that Aus-
tralasia! is pre-eminently the product of
Bad Eggs. “Here,” we proudly said,
“ is a race born of an adventurous stock, of
the aggressive, the restless, the wild, the
revolutionary, the courageous, the strong;
here, if anywhere on the globe, we possess
the essentials for the breeding of a con-
quering, fierce, and capable race. The
timid, the tame, the lax of will, the som-
nolent, have been left on the other side
of the equator to rot of their own in-
effectiveness ; here we start with the rude
framework of a sturdy, democratic and
dominant people. For we are the product
of the choicest collection of Bad Eggs
that ever any nation laid.” For the Bad
Egg, it may be remarked, has, at least
two advantages over the Virtuous Egg :
(1) It is much more useful at elections; and
(2) its end, if put into the proper national
incubator, is a Chick. The merely Moral
Egg is ignominiously gobbled at break-
fast ; the Vicious Egg some day may
gobble worms. A live Chick is better
than a dead Egg. But Hueffer now
collars our Bad Eggs, and claims, in his
new book, The Spirit of the People (A.
Rivers), that the English race itself is
the result of the frequent importation of
successive consignments of Immoral Eggs
from the Continent. His pleasing theory
will justify examination ; and if Hueffer
proves his point we, in Australasia, will
be proud to hold out the hand of fellow-
ship to our brother Baneful Eggs in
England. After all, there is something
in racial sentiment.
This is the third of a trilogy of im-
pressions of the English. In The Soul
of London, Hueffer showed us this people
very much compressed into a great town;
in The Heart of the Country he depicted
for us this same people amidst the green
acres of a restricted island ; and now he
attempts to expound the national psycho-
logy of the Englishman—“ that odd
mixture of every kind of foreigner that
is called the Anglo-Saxon race.”
Hueffer points out, as The Bulletin has
frequently pointed out, that England,
almost more than any other, is the land
that has been ruled by foreigners ; and
notes that this great fact is persistently
ignored by the Englishman.
Almost every continental race and at
least one Asiatic race—can take a kindly
interest in English territory, because ahnost
every continental race of importance can
say, “ At one time we conquered England.”
French, Latin, German, Dutch, ' Scot,
Welshman—all can say it. Even the
Spaniards can say, “ Once a King of Spain
was King of England.”
But the Englishman, confronted with
these facts, will hedge. He will say,
“All these fellows are ‘ourselves.’ We’
being English, have swallowed them up’
digested them. They conquered us, not
because they were foreigners, but because
they were predestined to become Eng-
lishmen.” And his magnificent cheek
carries him further. In his eyes William
the Norman, even though he is called a
Conqueror, was more English than the
Anglo-Saxon king who was weak enough
to get shot in the eye.
So the French Plantagenets, the Welsh
Tudors, the Scotch Stuarts, the Hanoverian
Guelphs, and even Dutch William—all
these kings became “ English ” the moment
they ruled in England.
*
And, historically, there is much to be
said for the Englishman’s cheek. For it
is England who has digested her con-
querors ; her climate, her position, her fer-
tility— thesehavetriturated the successive
strata of invaders into one race, just as
the Australian and Maoriland climates
are at present evolving two new races out
of British stock. Hueffer develops the
theory that in the eyes of these con-
querors England was but a goodly inn, a
harborage upon the ultimate migratory
route to the West. It was upon this
tiny island that the hordes of European
mankind rested temporarily on their road
to America. Ho England is but a halt-
ing place, a means to an end, and the
end is America or—if we look farther
ahead—Australasia. Thus the English
are not a race :
They are the populations descended fro
the rogues of a Sanctuary—of a SanAua
that arose because it was safe or because i
was conquerable. .. . England is the direc
product of successive periods of unrest
the Continental peoples.
And from the ferment of this co
lection of Pernicious Eggs came the fir
cargoes of Malevolent Eggs to Ameri
and Australasia. So we cannot claim to
just Eggs ; we are the almost Diabolfca
Eggs hatched from a medley of altogeth
Obnoxious Eggs. Hurrah ! Some da
we will throw one of our Mephitic Eg
at the North East. . . .
*
But the Englishman even goes furthe
He believes that Caesar was an Englis
man : had he not all the English traits '
So, too, Washington was essentially
Englishman; else how could he hav
beaten Englishmen ? And the ancien
Jews Vere undoubtedly Englishmen
did not Jehovah fight for them ? Anc
now he has discovered that the Japs ar
Englishmen: have they not sunk th
Russian fleet ? And it is at least argu
able that the majority of Englishme
regard Christ as a blond fellow-country
man.
And it is precisely because of her het
rogeneous assortment of Noxious Egg
that England contrives to mudd
through. She always manages to pro
duce the sort of man needed for th
changing conditions of civilisation. Fo
somewhere at the bottom of the baske
England possesses a Bad Egg of th
nation (and the national characteristic
that is needed at the moment. ]
England beats the Germans in the grea
war of by-products, it will probably b
because of the German strain already i
England, just as in wool-weaving Eng
land’s colonies of Flemish weavers bea
the Flemings.
And if it be true that the enemy is Prus
sianism—that the world is gradually comin
to a state of mind in which it shall be mos*
important to a nation to produce the inori
essentially Germanic type, we may vrell hop
to produce the man. . . . We may very we'
produce yet another dominant type tha
shall help England to retain it* own, and t
gain just that little bit of material advantag
that, except in the great struggle with th
English superman across the Atlantic
England has always had. Just as in i
world attuned to Plantagenet ideas, Englanc
produced the Plantagenets; just as in
world attuned to Machiavelli, England pro
duced Thomas Cromwell ; just as in a work
that was opening up to adventurers, Englanc
produced the Drakes and the Raleighs ; just
as in a world fitted for parades o:
troops and tortuous intrigues, with a ro
soleil t England produced a William 111. anc
a Marlborough—so England may well hope
to produce a man fitted to contend, in the
end, with the Kaiser or Professor who is co
set the tune for the next generation.
And even from the horde of Jews from
Odessa that are flooding England,
Huefler, with that official optimisn
which he admits is a trait of the
English, suggests that there may arise
another Disraeli, once more to help
England to muddle through.
*
But, unfortunately, Hueffer’s brilliant
theory of England ‘as a home for Bad
Eggs goes bad when we remember that
there are big and little Bad Eggs.
England was fortunate for many cen-
turies in getting possession of big Bad
Eggs of the type of William the Plugger,
and the Plantagenets; but within the last
century the supply of large Bad Eggs seems
to have given out; the really Pestilential
Eggs skipped England and lit out for
America and Es ; and there has since
been only a continuous dribble into
England of Wicked Sparrow-eggs—de-
crepit Hebrews and other minor racial
cast-offs ; .while from the Home for Bad
Eggs there is a continual export of the
few Naughty Moa-eggs left in the little
Atlantic archipelago. And England
goes on placidly in-breeding or breeding
with those undersized Immoral Eggs that
are flooding in through her open ports,
and the eggs in the basket are gradually
losing the strength even to go bad.
But, granted that the English hav®
been nurtured on Noisome Eggs, what
after all, has humanity to thank this ract
for ? Hueffer thinks that England’s par
mount claim upon civilisation is not the
foundation of a vast empire, not th
establishment of a tradition of seaman
ship, not the leading the way into th
realms of mechanical advance, not he
poets, not her arts nor her philosophies
but simply her “ evolution of a rule o '
thumb system by which men may liv
together in large masses.”
It has shown to the world how great anc
teeming populations may inhabit a sma
island with a minimum of discomfort,
minimum of friction, preserving a decen ;
measure of individual independence o'
thought and character, and enjoying a com
paratively level standard of material comfor
and sanitary precaution.
*
That such an astoundingly cheeky
claim should be made by Hueffer bu
proves that he, despite his critica
detachment, is also an Englishman. He
suffers from the sad illusion that th
English gentleman is the Englishman
he has forgotten the poor—those twelv
out of forty millions who are always 01
the verge of starvation. “ A minimum
of discomfort ... a comparatively leve
standard of material comfort ” in the
slums ? It is curious to come upon tin
ancient fallacy in a book highly
original, well written, and stimulating
but it merely shows Hueffer one with
his race. In repressing its emotions, in
refusing to discuss certain questions, in
keeping its conscience in water-tight
compartments, this people, so adven
turous and so restless, has discoverer
the secret of living—on an income.
England is certainly one of the pleasantest
places in the world to live in—on an income
—even though its residents must depenc
for their humor on Punch. But their
thought-tight mental compartments pre-
vent them even recognising the existence,
except for picturesque or “ charitable ”
purposes, of the innumerable poor. The
English gentleman merely claps that
twelve millions of his race into one of his
thought-tight mental compartments, and
never doubts that, thus conveniently shut
away, these hordes will always stay
there. Just now, however, he is being
compelled to provide the London school-
children with free breakfasts, and
there is strange, un-English talk of old-
age pensions. .. .
*
And at the end Hueffer admits that
his elaborate analysis of a national spirit
may be of a national spirit that is already
on the wane. For a nation that is in
vigorous manhood does not stop to
analyse, to question, as England is now
questioning, whether it is degenerate; it
merely goes on growing. And Hueffer's
diagnosis is a sign that England is
getting somewhat concerned about its
health. But the book is one to read. It
stands in the first section of its class of
National Psychology.
Quite the usual commonplace novel is
Q.E.D., by Marcus Leigh (6. Robertson,
Aus.). It is well written, nicely conven-
tional, and long. One of the thousand
indifferently good novels that are issued
every year, it owes its mention here solely
to the fact that the scene, the publisher,
and, presumably, the author are Australian.

Clements Tonic
•• LIFTED ME FROM THAT SORRY STATE.”
“ It is six years ago now since I got all right
again,” Mr. Borwick remarked, and I think it
was about up to me to have a change of luck, con-
sidering that I had been suffering for fully three
years. The pains that ran along my gums and
reached up to the top of my head were something
terrible, and half my time I did not know what I
was doing. My adversities set in when I was
“running the plank,” as they call it, on a boat
discharging blue metal, and I can assure you that
I was so broken down in health that I had to put
another man on to do my work about every other
week. Talk about neuralgia. lam sure nobody
could have it worse than I had, and as I found
such a grand cure for it, the least I can do is to let
humanity know all about it, for I daresay my ex-
perience will prove very helpful. Well, out of all
the medicines I tried to cure neuralgia, the only
one that was of any lasting benefit was Clements
Tonic, and when I say that after keeping going
with that remedy for a few weeks the fearful
pains all left me, and have never returned all these
years, it is the honest truth I am telling you.”
“ Is that the only ailment you have had ?”
“Indeed, no. All the time the neuralgia tor-
tures were at me I had other troubles to deal
with, for my digestion was just as bad as it could
be. Both from want of appetite, and also owing
to the pains about my jaws, eating was almost out
of the question ; but what was still more unfortu-
nate was the fact that the little. I did force myself
to take to keep body and soul together had the
unhappy habit of disagreeing with me. And you
must remember that I was getting no sleep.
Neither night nor day—for weeks at a stretch
sometimes—could I get any rest, and, as you may
well imagine, the result was disastrous. I got so
terribly weak that ultimately I had to give up my
work altogether, and my body was so denuded of
flesh that my clothes hung about me like a sack.
Indeed, I was just going to have some of them
altered about the time that I started on Clements
Tonic, and by some means or other the idea was
shelved for a while, for which I was afterwards
very glad, as in a few months I was as stout as
ever. Yes; it was quite a matter for regular
comment how well I was looking, and, thank
God, I felt well, too. For three years
previous to using Clements Tonic I was nothing
Mr. V. BORWICK, Storekeeper, of 286 and 288 Crown Road,
Ultimo, relates his COMPLETE CURE to a Sydney reporter.
but a total wreck, for every part of my body
was adversely affected in some way or other. It
was my first experience of indigestion, and I sin-
cerely trust it will be my last, for I would rather
be dead and out of the world assog«ther than go
through such misery again. I got to feel as shaky
and uncomfortable as if everything in my
inside was going to pieces, and was so disturbed
and unsettled mentally that the least thing made
me irritable. My eyes always felt heavy and
swollen to such an extent that I could scarcely see
to read, and I felt so discontented and restless
that I could not stay indoors.. Consequently, I
often wandered about outside, hardly knowing
what to do with myself, feeling as though death
would be a thousand times more welcome than the
wretched life I was leading, for I was in agony
everywhere. The pains in my chest were really
cruel, and I thought I had strained myself or
broken something between my shoulders owing to
the pain that was there. It was like getting hold
of a piece of meat, and tearing it in two —that was
the kind of feeling I had between the shoulders,
and my loins ached badly into the bargain.”
“And have you never had a return of any of
those symptoms during the past six years ? ”
“No; upon my honor; and I have not had
that nasty bulged-out feeling in the stomach
either after eating my food. No, Clements Tonic
removed everything, even to the bitter taste of a
morning, and the fur that used to cover my
tongue, besides which it gave me permanent
relief from the many attacks of giddiness that I
had previously been subjected to. How much my
nerves accounted for the misery I had endured is
hard to say definitely, but they undoubtedly had
their fair share of responsibility, for I must tell
you that I was so highly nervous that I could not
stand the least excitement without getting all of
a tremble, and I had also contracted an uncon-
trollable practice of measuring the future with
nothing but trouble and worry in store. All I
could see before me was a continuance of my suf-
fering, only to be added to my misfortunes of
other descriptions, and now that you understand
the gloomy frame of mind I was in, you will
readily conceive why I speak so highly of Clements
Tonic for lifting me from the sorry state to the
happy and healthy condition I am now blessed

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Platonic Love.
I have heard it remarked, as a matter of course,
By some folks pessimistic and vicious,
That a love that’s Platonic must always, perforce,
Lead to something that’s wrong or suspicious.
With such ill-natured people I cannot agree,
When I think of the love betwixt Pollie and me.
She is pure as the daintiest lily that grows.
Not a rosebud is fairer or sweeter.
From her golden-crowned head to the tips of her
toes,
There was never a maid that was neater.
And our friendship is candid, and open and free,
For there is not a secret ’twixt Pollie and me.
We are chums. That is all. Just a man and a
maid
Who resolve to be happy and jolly.
And I care not a jot what is whispered or said,
I shall still keep on loving sweet Pollie.
When I stroke her bright hair, as she sits on my
knee,
I rejoice at the love betwixt Pollie and me.
So the gossips may wonder and talk as they please,
They may chuckle with laughter sardonic.
Though she asks me to kiss her, and shows me
her knees,
Yet I swear that our love is Platonic.
There is not the least harm betwixt Pollie and me,
For, alas 1 I am sixty, while Pollie is three.
N.s.w.
THOS. E. SPENCER.
Eily’s Spring Prayer.
With heart of mine fluttering madly
Because he is by,
With thoughts whirling foolishly, gladly,
Alas, how can I
Demurely walk with him, and badly
Act out a dull lie ?
With radiant thrills simply firing
My whole being through,
With dreams ev’ry light step inspiring,
Can I be untrue,
Or check the sweet spell by inquiring
What’s startling or new ?
Or essay a stiff conversation
With pantomime play,
Or use up familiar quotation,
With secret dismay?
I cannot. My heart’s exaltation
Must go its glad way.
But sometimes my Dear’s tongue does clatter
Of nonsense most sweet,
And then—why, I add a gay patter,
To make his complete.
That’s all. Of the topics —what matter ?
Earth smiles at our feet.
He knows not what I know, and shyly
I guard my love still;
It’s “Jack” —minus dear—and just “Eily
But, on the green hill,
My hand steals to his, oh, so slyly,
And ray world’s athrill.
Some day, when the green earth is smiling,
And flowering with gold,
And away we the spring hours are whiling,
With joys manifold,
Kind Heaven ! Help on Love’s beguiling,
Make one of us hold.

EUGENIA STONE.
A Soldier of the Poor.
I love the gilded halls of food
Where, in the noise of sighing strings
And clash of dishes, I can brood
Upon a state of things that brings
My mind to quite a thoughtful mood.
I’ve had a lovely lunch to-day—
Seductive squeaker, gently placed
Upon a green bed, where it lay *
Inviting me to decent haste —
And chops, a generous array.
Yet, while I sit at ease and hear
The chattering people chew, and joke
Across their German luncheon-beer,
I think upon the dreadful folk
Who take their food in filth and fear.
Those men who eat where paltry pence
Pay for strong flesh of ancient beeves ;
Where slow, grey, living succulence
Lurks in the unwashed lettuce-leaves,
And slops, as soup, make faint pretence.
Poor folk have made me rich, and I
Am not ungrateful—when I see
Their pauper legions, troubled, shy,
Slink by, I’m thankful I can be
Some use to such before I die.
I gave away some cash, last night
(Tuppence, in short) when passing by
A ragged man —and, trembling white,
With red rage in his glassy eye,
He threw it back —most impolite !
But, though they curse when they should bless,
I cannot help but think I might
Alleviate their dire distress ;
When I have time, I'll go and write
A good, hot letter to the press !

DALGETY AND CANBERRA:
A CONTRAST.
At the present moment Canberra is the favorite
nomination of the N.S.W. State Government for
an Australian capital, as against the Australian
Parliament’s selection of Dalgety, on the Snowy
River. Canberra has been the favorite nomina-
tion of the N.S. W> State Government for a few
weeks. Before that, Lyndhurst was, according to
the same State Government, the only place worth
serious consideration. In between times Yass,
Tumut, and Lake George have been enthusiasti-
cally spoken of by the N.S.W. State Government.
There was a sudden and temporary advocacy of a
place with a name like Muckhole somewhere in a
southern direction from Sydney, but Muckhole
hasn’t been heard of lately. Carruthers and
his successor Wade have gone on the simple rule
that any dry and dirty and inaccessible hole is good
enough to be the capital of Australia, provided it
is the hole they dictate; provided it is com-
pletely surrounded by State territory, so that its
road and railway and sea communication, its
water supply, and its drainage outlet are entirely
controlled by the State Government at Sydney,
and can be cut off when some Carruthers or
Wade feels that way ; and so long as the proposed
capital site isn’t the one that the Australian
Parliament has selected, and is one that it objects
to. For, in order to follow up the coarse and in-
sulting impertinence of the theory that Car-
ruthers or Wade or some other Sydney person
has the right to select the capital of all Australia,
and thus to over-ride not only the Federal members
from N.S.W. but the Federal members from
Australia in general, it is necessary to quarrel
with the Australian Parliament on this matter.
If the Australian Parliament has selected the
best site within the limits allowed by the Consti-
tution, the only way Carruthers or Wade can
assert his claim to be cantankerous is to demand
that the capital shall be planted on the second-
best site, or the third-best site, or the worst sjte,
and that is exactly what Carruthers did and
what Wade is doing.
* * * *
According to the conditions which were de-
manded by George Reid when he set out to be
disagreeable as State Premier of N.S.W., the
Australian capital must he in N.S.W. It must
lie at least 100 miles from Sydney, but it may be
any greater distance from that city so long as it
keeps in N.S.W. It is to be located in a Federal
territory of at least 100 square miles, but the
territory may be of any greater area—there is no
limit as to the area, so long as it doesn’t spread
so far as to go within 100 miles of Sydney. These
conditions were forced on the other States by
the quarrelsome State Insect of N.S.W,, and
they were apcoiqpanied by a further condition ex-
pressed ip Clause 125 of the Constitution —that,
withiq the limits already mentioned, the seat of
Government shall be determined by the Parlia-
ment of the Commonwealth. But the first Aus-
tralian Parliament didn’t exercise the powers
thus conferred upon it. With needless and ex-
cessive affability it asked the N.S.W. State
authority to recommend the best site within the
limits specified bv the Constitution, and after
much delay the N.S.W. State authority of the
day appointed an eminent and trusted official to
examine and report on the matter. He recom-
mended Southern Monaro as the best place he
could find, and the Australian Parliament
accepted his recommendation, and selected a site
THE SNOWY RIVER.
At Dalgety, the site selected by the Australian Parliament for the capital of Australia. This
is the one absolutely never-failing river in N.S.W.
on Southern Monaro. But, in the meantime, a new
State Insect had arisen, and still another State
Insect has come to the front since then. The first
Insect, Carruthers, declared that the proposed
site was so rich and valuable that N.S.W. couldn’t
part with it. Later he, and also the second
Insect, Wade, declared that the place was so
poor, bleak, wretched and valueless, that they
couldn’t think of offering it. And then chaos
supervened.
The question at issue is really whether the site
selected shall be. within the limits of the Consti-
tution, the best one that can be found in the
interests of Australia, or whether it shall be one
selected by Wade or Carruthers, so that they
may gratify their petty dignity by being nasty, and
childish, and horrible, and dictatorial to the
Australian Parliament. There is no evidence
at all that N.S.W. in general has the
slightest objection to Dalgety as a site for
a capital. Carruthers promised to show
clearly that N.S.W. did object by taking a
COTTER CREEK.
The Canberra site for a Federal Capital, advocated by N.S.W. State Premier Wade, lies 16 miles
from this trickle of water. And it is to depend on the trickle for its entire water supply.
purely State referendum on the subject. It
wouldn’t have made any difference if he had done
so, for the only people who have a right to speak
for N.S. W. on the subject are its members in the
Australian Parliament, and they have only the
same right as the members from any other State
—no more and no less. Still, it is notable that
Carruthers never kept his promise, and never
ventured to take that referendum, lest the opinion
of N.S.W. should be quite a different one from
what he represented it to be. His successor,
Wade, had the ineffable impudence to suggest,
the other day, that, if the Australian Parliament
would promise to accept any site that N.S.W.,
in its State capacity, offered, he would set to
work to find out what site N.S.W. preferred. So
Wade, after all his declarations that N.S.W., in
its State capacity, wouldn’t have Dalgety at any
price, was in the curious position of not knowing
whether there was any site that N.S.W., in its
State capacity, preferred to Dalgety. And all
this time the sites which Carruthers and Wade
had been recommending, in their desire to be
childish and nasty to the Australian Parliament,
were having bad luck. A little drought came
along, and Lyndhurst, which had been put for-
ward as the ideal spot, dried up so badly that it
was dropped. Lake George dried up, and its bed
Was let for grazing purposes, and that site was
never heard of any more. Tumut and Vass were
dropped for reasons not specified. But in the
resolute endeavor of the State insects to keep on
objecting to the site chosen by the Australian
Parliament, Canberra was discovered at the last
moment, and just now it and Dalgety are the only
places mentioned. When Canberra dries up,
Wade will probably find the ideal site at Botany
or Tibooburra. Any site is good enough for Wade
so long as the Australian Parliament didn’t
select it.
*** * *
With this article are presented (1) a photograph
of the Snowy River, on which the proposed capital
at Dalgety would be situated, and (2) a photograph
of Cotter Creek, sixteen miles from which lies
Wade’s suddenly-discovered proposed capital of
Canberra. In a dry country like Australia water
is the first essential —water for drinking, water
for washing, water for flushing drains to avert
typhoid, and, if possible, water to supply power
for heating, lighting, and driving industrial
machinery. Also, if possible, it should be water
close at hand —not 16 miles away. There
are many other essentials —a good climate,
good scenery, an outlet for drainage, an
outlet to the sea by a Federal port,
access by land to two States so that
no one grossly and wilfully cantankerous
State Insect may cut off the road and railway
communication of the Federal territory with the
rest of Australia ; but the first essential is an
unfailing water supply, which has its source in
Federal territory and is under Federal control,
and which can’t be fouled by people not under
Federal control or cut off by the State Insect
aforementioned. Therefore the photographs in
question refer chiefly to water supply. In the
dreadful drought year of 1902 the Snowy,
on which Dalgety stands, was the only river in
N.S.W. which was flowing through its whole
length. Every other river had degenerated, at
some part of its course, into a chain of befouled
water-holes or a mere dry bed. Many had van-
ished wholly. And this year, when a very brief
drought disqualified Lyndhurst, Lake George
and other proposed sites, it is necessary to con-
sider this water question seriously.
* ■* * *
Wade’s Canberra site depends wholly on Cotter
Creek, 16 miles away and with a pretty high ridge
in between, for its drink, its wash, its very exist-
ence. Cotter Creek was dignified by the N.S.W.
State Insect with the name of a river when the
Canberra site began to be advocated (apparently
out of sheer cussedness); but to the people there-
abouts it is still only a creek. It never, in fact,
was anything else. At its best point, where it
falls into the Murrumbidgee, it was, on January
24. 1908, just eight yards wide, and its
depth was six inches. It flows through
an oil-bearing rock formation at some part of
its career, and an undrinkable greasy fluid
floats on its surface. It was a slow little
stream on January and brought down but
little water even for its depth ; a camera on a
tripod was left standing on slippery boulders in
the middle of the Cotter, and the wash was in-
sufficient to disturb its equilibrum. Higher up
the Cotter was a mere string of holes, 3ft. or 4ft.
deep, with a trickle between. In some places it was
a trickle without the water holes. It is reputed to
be 30 or 40 miles long, but on this point the local
inhabitant seems to know little. It flows through
sheep and cattle country, and when, after heavy
rain, it swells for a few hours to the size of a baby
torrent, it brings down liiannre, deceased cow
and other carrion- It is neyer quite dry,
and never wet enough to be a serious danger
to a sober pedestrian. To build a reser-
voir on the Cotter anywhere near Canberra,
would be a huge undertaking. The only
process would be to build the whole
four sides of the structure, and water
would have to be pumped to a height of
several hundred feet to supply anything like a
pressure at Canberra itself. The proposed capital
site lies on a saucer-like plain, surrounded by a
ring of low hills, at an average distance of five
miles from the proposed city. Premier Wade is
reported to have said at Queanbeyan that these
hills would form natural fortifications, but un-
fortunately they are all dominated by higher hills,
so the fortifications are a failure. But the
hopeless curse and disqualification of Canberra
is want of water. Its little creek just
a replica of the Stony Creek or Sandy
Creek or Smith’s Creek that is found
beside every little township in N.S.W. or any
other State. The population has expressed its
opinion of the place as a desirable settlement by
the rush it has made to settle there. Canberra
consists of one house.
* * * •
The Dalgety site, selected on its merits by the
Australian Parliament, after the ISI.S.W. State
official had declared that Southern Monaro was
the best place offering, is on the banks of the
Snowy River. The Snowy has always been called
a river-—never a mere creek. It is to be found,
with the designation of river, on any ordinary
map of N.S.W., while the Cotter, as Premier
Wade himself lately admitted, can’t be traced
even on the plans of the N.S.W. Lands Depart-
ment. The Snowy is 300 miles long, 180 miles of
its curly, whirly length being in N.S.W., so
it is, roughly, 7i times the length of the Cotter
rivulet. On January 24 the river at Dalgety was
nearly 80 yards wide, or almost 10 times the
width of the Cotter. It was 3ft. deep, or six
times the depth of the Cotter, and it was not a
languid caterpillar of water but a rushing stream
in which it was very difficult to keep a foothold.
The Snowy is clean except for occasional mud
discoloration, for it rushes down from the huge
mountains where there is very little either of man
or beast, and it isn’t polluted by cattle to any
perceptible degree. It carries a water supply
large enough for Sydney and Melbourne com-
bined—an important circumstance at a time when
both Sydney and Melbourne are haunted, after a
very brief drought, with the goblin of scarcity.
The necessary reservoirs to supply a city can
be constructed by simply building a wall
across one of the gorges above the town. There
is not only enough water for the drinking and
washing of a great city, but enough to drive at an
almost infinitesimal cost the machinery of a large
manufacturing community, and to supply it with
cheap heat and light. And the river, because it
is fed by the eternal snows of the biggest moun-
tain range in Australia, runs all the time along its
whole course. It is the only Australian river
outside the tropics of which this can be said. It
has its variations, of course; just now it is
reckoned as being unusually low ; but it is always
a river, and the big bridge at Dalgety is a testi-
mony to its unfordable quality. Dalgety itself is
something of a live town, and quite unlike
Canberra. The local hotels greet the traveller
with an inquiry as to whether he would
like a hot bath, and after he has got
over his amazement —there being no such luxury
at Canberra —he says he would. Also Dalgety
has a big local fuel supply, which Canberra lacks,
and the ambitious inhabitant builds his home
from the inexhaustible supplies of local granite.
* * * *
State Premier W ade, of N. S. W., recently m ade a
progress both to Canberra and Dalgety. At Can-
berra he and his friends hired a vehicle, and
drove round, and enthused over the prospects of
the little trickle of water beside which it is pro-
posed that the Federal city should parch. At
Dalgety they sat grumpily in the hotel, and re-
fused even to go out and inspect the fine local
river, and complained gloomily about the
alleged bleakness of the climate. Yet a
day or so later they climbed up Mount
Kosciusko, a few thousand feet higher
and much bleaker than Dalgety, and in a forgetful
moment Wade and Co. enthused about the
climate and the beauty of things, and urged the
public to go and see the place, and realise what
Paradise is like. The explanation of these things
is apparently that, in the political creed of Wade
and Carruthers, there is no question of selecting
the best site for a capital within the limits
allowed by the Constitution. In all their
writings and speakings, the interests of Australia
are never mentioned—only the alleged “rights of
New South Wales.” And in this case the
“rights of New South Wales” don’t mean the
rights, or even the interests, of New South
Wales, let alone those of Australia, but only the
gratification of the mean, paltry vanity of Car-
ruthers and Wade. They belong to a little
parish-minded party which, as far back as
ten years ago, when F«deration was still in
the air, began to talk of demanding the capital for
New South Wales, and even of demanding that
Sydney politicians should select the site of the
capital. They have tried at different times to
lay it down : (1) that the State Government of
N.S.W. shall select the capital of all Australia ;
(2) that it shall decide the area of the Federal ter-
ritory, which shall be a very small area ; (3) that
the capital shall be allowed no communication
with the sea except through N.S.W. territory;
and (4) that it shall be entirely surrounded by
N.S.W. territory, and be dependent on the
charity of the N.S.W. State authorities for its
railway and road communication, its water sup-
ply, and its drainage outlet. In fact, their
political creed consists mostly of a desire to insult
and oppose the Australian Parliament. To people
of this class the splendid advantages of the
Snowy River site seem a wrong and an insult,
merely because they would make the Australian
capital independent of the State Government at
Sydney. They regard it as better that the
political centre of Australia should be a hovel on
a dry plain, provided it can be bossed by Sydney,
than that it should be a garden city amid a
paradise of waters, and be out of Sydney’s control.
Moreover, having made the demand that the
N.S.W. State authorities shall select the capital
of all Australia, they can’t agree with any site
chosen by the Australian Parliament for fear an
impression should arise that the N.S.W. State
authorities have not selected the capital. If the
Australian Parliament selects Paradise for a
capital and the N.S.W. State Premier also
selects Paradise, then people might think that
the N.S.W. State Insect had had no voice in
the selection, and had been a mere echo and a
ditto. But if the Australian Parliament
selects Paradise and the N.S.W. State
Premier chooses Hell, then the noble and vigorous
independence with which he stands out for the
“ rights of N.S.W.” is so conspicuous that it is
visible t@ the most tired observer.


HEAVY GRAIN BAGS, AND BOGUS
STATE RIGHTS, AND ONE HERCULES,
DECEASED.
A few days ago a wharf-lumper dropped dead.
He had been chiefly employed in humping these
bloated 3001 b. and 3501 b. and 4001 b. bags of grain
in which a brutish variety of farmer delights
because he reckons that one 4001 b. bag is 2d.
cheaper than two bags of 2001 b. each ; and the fear-
some weights had broken the lumper’s hear t—rather
literally than in the figurative sense. He was a
young man, and described as a Hercules ; but the
drudgery that is expected of the man who serves
the great “primary producer” is calculated to
double up the shoulders of even Hercules. He
leaves behind him, and unprovided for, a young
widow and three young children. And his is not a
solitary case by any means. The huge and bloated
grain bag is plain murder, and the farmer who
sends it along is a plain murderer, and the poli-
ticians who allow him to send it are his accessories.
Under These conditions the newest attitude of
Wade and Bent, the cantankerous local Premiers
of N.S.W. and Victoria respectively, is interest-
ing. There are two powers that can interfere
with the bloated grain-bag homicide. The State
Parliament can prohibit the big, murderous bag
straight-out by imposing heavy penalties on who-
ever buys, sells, keeps, fills or handles the
monstrosity ; or it can prohibit it in part by re-
fusing to allow bags going more than, say, 11 to
the ton to be carried on the State railways—but it
doe@ neither of these things. The Federal Parlia-
ment (by virtue of Part 1., Clause 51 of the Con-
stitution, which gives it sole control over foreign
and inter-State commerce) can prohibit the im-
portation of bags exceeding a certain size, or the
export of bags filled beyond a certain weight, and
can also prevent such bags passing from one State
to another ; but it can do nothing as regards bags
made or altered in the country, or as regards
grain reserved for use in the State where it
is grown. Still, so far as its powers go, the
Commonwealth proposes to act in the cause of
common humanity. And on this subject hear the
raucous voice of N.S.W. State Premier Wade as
reported in an admiring Sydney morning paper :
As to grain bags, he would say, without hesitation,
that it was no concern of the Federal Government, and it
was not the only attempt it had made to interfere with
the States. Mr. Chapman said he intended to pursue a
certain course as to the weight of bags. Under the Con-
stitution the Federal Government had no power to do
anything in the matter, Mr. Bent and he (Mr. Wade)
had agreed that if the Federal Government persisted in
that course they would be given an opportunity of testing
their right. The State had power to legislate as to
weight and size. It only increased the friction when the
Federal authorities stepped into a matter over which they
had no control, and which was a State matter only. The
Slate was making inquiries into the elevator system, but
they had been impressed by the enormous cost it would
entail at first. Mr. Wade then got back to the grievance
against Federation, and said that he strongly objected to
any interference with the States for the aggrandisement
of Federation.
* * * *
So the State Frights crowd at last finds its level.
It is out in the interests of the 3501 b. bag of grain,
and in the cause of shameful overwork, and the
wrecking of human beings by excessive toil. It
does its cheerful dance on the grave of the young
Hercules with the broken heart, who left a
young widow and three young children unpro-
vided for. The State Frights crowd, so far as WADE
represents it, does nothing itself in this matter,
and doesn’t even promise anything. It has “in-
quired ” into the elevator system and decided that
it is alarmingly dear, and it leaves things at that.
As for using its authority—while it is thinking
over the elevator system—to limit the weight of
bags, there isn’t, in Wade’s statements, even the
semblance of a promise that anything will be
done. The State Frights party, in addition to
being callous itself, is apparently willing to lie
and bluster and threaten, in order to prevent the
more humane Federal authority doing anything.
If the Government did propose to
strain its authority a little in this matter, the fact
that it was doing so in the cause of humanity
might make any decent citizen overlook the
straining process for once. But nothing of the
kind is even remotely suggested. Nothing can be
clearer than that clause of the Constitution which
reserves wholly to the Australian Parliament the
control of
Trade and commerce with other countries and among
the Slates.
Under that clause the right of the Common-
wealth to prevent the over-sized grain bag coming
into Australia or passing over any State border,
and to prevent the over-loaded bag going out of
Australia or passing over any State border, is
absolute and indisputable. The attitude which
Wade takes up, and in which he says he is backed
by Bent, is a grossly impertinent encroachment
by the State on Federal rights. And it is an
encroachment done in the interests of shocking
cruelty to the human animal, and by way of pro-
tecting a system which wrecks stalwart men and
hurries them to premature graves.
* * * ■»
It is earnestly 7 to be hoped that the State
Encroachment Party will appeal to the High
Court over this question as soon as the Federal
legislation comes along. The chances are 1000
to one that it won’t be so stupendously foolish ;
hut if its folly does carry it so far, it will do a
service to humanity. It couldn’t possibly appeal
to the law in a cause better calculated to exhibit
it to the public,gaze in all its naked ugliness. It
would go into Courtas a concern that was ignorant
of the commonest principles of law ; as an insolent
would-be usurper of authority that plainly doesn’t
belong to it; as a reckless slanderer that heaps on
the Australian Government insulting charges of
encroachment on State rights no matter how care-
fully that Government keeps within its legal
limits; and as the supporter of gross cruelty and
shameful sweating. It would be better for the good
name of Wade and Bent if they banged themselves
outside the door of the High Court than if they
w ent inside on such an errand ; but if they do
go inside on this business, they will at least do
good service by putting the State Frights cause
before the world in its proper light. Meanwhile,
it wifi be interesting to see if James McGowen and
I Red Flowers, and certain other members of the
State Labor party, will still lend themselves
to the State Frights movement, or if they will at
last find sufficient wisdom to throw in their lot
with the party which upholds the Australian Par-
liament in the full exercise of its authority. If
they don’t choose the latter alternative they
deserve to be condemned to wharf-lumping for
the rest of their davs.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Plain Mr. McGowen—and the Reason.
Fred Flowers, M.L.C., opened the N.S.W.
out leal Labor Conference, now in session, with
some light entertainment in the way of a conun-
drum. “Why isn’t Mr. McGowen Premier?”
the question asked, and Flowers, M.L.C.,
°und a conspicuously foolish answer. It was, he
said, because at the State elections the NSW
Labor party “ had to bear the burden of certain
B ederal happenings.” This somewhat vague state-
ment is, presumably, to be read in the light
of the fact that Flowers, M.L.C., was one of a
delegation which went from Sydney at the time of
the promu Ration of the tariff to persuade the
b ederal Labor party to take up the cause of the
nch lory importer, and declare war against the
Australian manufacturer and the Australian
j’ & enera lly to assume a Foreign-trade
attitude for the sake of the cause ”in N.S.W.
In effect, I lowers, M.L.C., claims that because
the Australian Labor party favored the Protec-
tionist tariff, the N.S.W. Labor party lost the
otate elections. The utter folly of this claim can
ne easily shown. At the last Federal elections,
u® rv KlD .party —which represents what is left of
the I oreign-trade idea in N.S.W.—went to the
nt a lnore than a two-to-one majority of the
JN.S.W. representation. It returned in an abso-
lute minority. And there is a general belief that
the revolt of N.S.W. against the Foreign-trade
superstition is permanent. That is shown by
these facts : That no Freetrade member in the
House of Representatives thought it wise to
attempt to fight the tariff on Foreign-trade lines ;
that several Foreign-trade members, such as G.
tgq l Hughes and Wilks, frankly confessed that
A.S.W., in common with the rest of Australia,
had declared for Protection ; that several
attempts to organise anti-tariff meetings in Sydney
failed ; and that those candidates
at the N.S.W. State elections who had the courage
to talk Protection were conspicuously successful
(the startling effect produced by the intrusion of'J.
C. Watson, talking straight Protection and Feder-
ation as well as Labor, was one of the features
of the campaign ; in almost every electorate that
he stumped the Labor candidate won). If
Flowers, M.L.C., really wants to know why Mr.
McGowen failed at the State elections The Bul-
letin can tell him. The reason was that
their was no conspicuous difference be-
tween Carruthers and McGowen. Both
favored a dishonest system of finance ; both were
unpatriotic and anti-Australian, and carped at the
Australian Government. It was a case of
Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee ; and between the
two evils the evil in possession won, as it often
does, merely because it was in possession. If the
N.S.W. Labor Party had had the courage to put
forward a platform of its own, an honest Australian
platform, there wouldn’t have been enough left of
the Carruthers party to make a decent Opposi-
tion. But the Labor Party’s every effort was
directed towards making itself as like as possible
to the Carruthers party. That, of course, was
the most effective way of arguing to the electors
that the Carruthers party was all right. And
the electors took it that way. An anti-borrowing
party, an honest finance party, a party that
declared that it was no part of the business of a
State Legislature to lie about, and sneer at, and
quarrel with the Australian Parliament, would
almost certainly have swept the polls. But there
was no such party.
Bull’s Chow.
The insidious Chow, having firmly established
himself in Liverpool (England), has now invaded
London. So far, the fool-Cockney regards the new
strain introduced to the bull-dog breed merely
from a humorous point of view. One English
magazine has been snap-shotting the heathen in
Whitechapel, and remarks, with the cheerful
irresponsibility of a guide-book :
If you do not ask too many impertinent questions,
there is amusement to be got out of Chinatown. You
can be initiated into the mysteries of opium-smoking and
dice-throwing, and on much better acquaintance you
may be introduced to the pale-eyed English wife whom
many of these shopkeepers have stowed away behind the
lace curtains of their best parlor.
There are no Chinese women in Liverpool or
London, and the young Chows appear to exercise
a fascination over young factory girls who hang
curiously around the Chow laundries where many
English women are employed. With regard to
this laundry business, the Chow’s methods, so
familiar to Australia, appear to afford the
Cockney much merriment. To quote the magazine
again :
See him standing before the ironing-board, and note
the tiny stream of water which he squirts through his
yellow teeth upon the white shirt. It is an odd wav of
damping-the linen. - v
It is characteristic of the Englishman— especially
the .Londoner—to regard all foreigners as creatures
specially designed to afford him amusement,
lienee it may be some time before his attitude
towards the thin end of the wedge of Chinese in-
vasion changes from amused contempt to anxious
alarm. When that happens the “picturesque
Lhinaman s quaint ideas upon sanitation and the
saoredness of the marriage tie will engage the
staggered Cookney’s attention ; and when children
with slant eyes and yellow complexions begin to
grow too numerous around the Eyetalian’s barrel-
organ and the Greek’s “ icea de cream ” barrow,
he will say “ Blime ! ” and forget to laugh. So,
one way and another, Gussie, of Downing-street,
will probably before very long begin to under-
stand why Australia is in such deadly earnest in
its resolve to keep the Asiatic outside.

Our Kind Master That is to Be.
A proposal is before this country that the Aus-
tralian people—being a free community in which
every man and woman, who is neither insane, in
gaol, nor an alien, has a vote —should voluntarily
decide to train themselves, so that, without
creating a standing army or a great, ambitious
military caste, they may be able to defend their
freedom and their country if either are threatened.
In other words, it is proposed to make compulsory
education spread out far enough to include com-
pulsory education in shooting and other things.
This proposal, which depends wholly on the con-
sent of the people, has aroused a lot of shockingly
illogical persons to draw pictures of Australia
groaning under the military tyranny of itself, and
doing strange contortions with its own tyrannical
blucherboot on its own neck. One of these illogical
persons, Miss Rose Scott, recently made a
special effort, in a letter to Sydney Telegraph, to
prove the uselessness of preparation for defence,
and threw this bright gem into the discussion :
I would be interested to know what sort of invaders
we are to anticipate—Germans? They are our brothers.
Japanese?—THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT BRUTAL
TO THEIR CAPTIVES. The Chinese? —they are the most
peace-loving, philosophical race on earth, and would have
far more sense than to make war on a distant country in
defiance of treaties. The people of Australia want a
defence scheme against foolish propositions coming from
people without any knowledge of human nature or the
ethical progress of the world.
To this the average Australian will probably reply
that it representsa philosophy which is beyond him.
A lady—white, and of the proud European race
—who looks forward so affably to being an
Asiatic’s “ captive ” passes most people’s under-
standing. A good many people who have hitherto
had doubts about compulsory military training
will probably doubt no longer. They fancied that
the alternative lay between defence by a citizen
army and defence by a military caste or hired
army. To meet a prominent member of their
own party who opposes the idea of a citizen army,
not so much on the ground that our independence
is safe without it, as on the theory that if we sur-
render to the Japanese without putting up a scrap
on our own behalf the brown conqueror will
probably abstain from active ill-usage of his serf
or prisoner, puts the case in a new light. Very
few people thought that there was in existence
one white human being of British origin who
could sink to that mild and passive view of
things. The Australian isn’t taking any “captive”
business, if he can avoid it. He doesn’t intend to
be any Asiatic’s unresisting kitchen menial, or
other kind of menial, so long as he can
find a more promising occupation. And to many
of him it will seem a shocking and degrading
and abject thing that such a plea should have even
been put forward. The Japanese may be a kind
master, though the Korean doesn’t seem to have
found him so, but his ideas of kindness don’t pre-
vent him hiring out his daughter to a house of ill-
fame, and in other ways the benevolence is liable
to get mixed. Even if it didn’t get mixed,
however, there is a kind of feeling here-
abouts that it isn’t pleasant to be any kind
master’s dog or Uncle Tom. This hint, by the
bitterest opponent of a national defence system,
that the reason why such a system isn’t needed is
that we will probably get three square meals of
rice per day from our new brown proprietor, and
that he will most likely condescend to throw us
the bone on the mat, should make a whole lot of
converts in the direction that Miss Rose Scott
least intended. There is something revolting to
the ordinary mind in this suggestion of meek
acquiescence in a possible brown proprietorship.
The Misfortunes of Ma.
The N.S.W. Bureau of Statistics has issued its
1907 population figures, and the poor old wronged
Ma State’s insects are in more trouble. They
have been buzzing about “ Victorian conspiracies,”
and “ the iron heel of Federal oppression’’; and the
Sydney daily papers have shrieked at large about
ruinous tariffs and blasted industries. And now
the State’s own Bureau of Statistics turns up with
cold, hard figures, and proves that last year the
N. S. Wales increase of population was greater
than in any year since 1891; and 1891 was the
year when George Dibbs arrived, and got to
work on his too-short-lived Protectionist tariff.
George Reid, the man who was going to make
everybody jolly and fat, was in office throughout
1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898 ; and the net result was
’ that 3191 more people left the State than arrived
in it to share the Reid brand of fatness and joy.
Even when Reid was pitched out, Protection was
hung up pending Federation; and before the
Federal tariff could get to work in 1902 things
were beginning to look desperately serious. Popu-
lation m N.S.W. was moving like this :
1898— Gain by arrivals .. 1789
1899 — Gain by arrivals .. 390
1900 — Loss by departures .. 1518
1901— Loss by departures .. 6917
The Federal tariff had to stem that gathering
torrent of departures. It arrived in a poor year,
followed by a year of drought and disaster. And yet,
in spite of that tremendous handicap, it was able
not only to stop the Ma State’s loss of population,
but to bring some of the population back. The
loss of 6917 in 1901 was thus turned into a gain of
6903 in 1902—the year when the Commonwealth
set up its policy of protection. Thousands, driven
away by Reid’s jolly and fat Freetrade, hadasmuch
faith in the country as many of those who
stayed ; all they wanted was the removal of the
old curse of free imports, and as soon as that
curse was removed they trooped back. By 1906
the gain of population had reached 9004. Yet,
though that was vastly better than the loss of
3967 ten years previously, when G. Reid was
Premier, it was not as rapid an improvement as
it should have been. Having proved that Reid
and Freetrade meant a loss of population, while
even moderate Protection meant a gain of popula-
tion, the Commonwealth tried some more Protec-
tion ; and from 9004 in 1906 the gain of immigrants
jumped promptly to 14,498 in 1907- Thus did Ma
thrive on woes and oppression. Meantime, how-
ever, with its own official figures howling at it—
the figures of the losses of population under
Reid, of the moderate gain of population under
moderate Protection, of the great jump of popu-
lation under the reasonably high Protection intro-
duced by Tariff Bum Lyne during last year—
.N. b. Wales still tolerates, and even applauds,
Nkild when he proposes to heave six tons of
wmtflipg amendments at the already tpo much
whittled tariff. Is it mere lunacy, or dpesp’t
N- S. Wales really want population?
Bathing on thp Sabbath.
A gladsome heathen offers some opinions ;=-
Judkins lives 500 miles away from Sydney, but fiis
spirit is present here all the same. A few weeks ago a
fearsome story of misconduct among the bathers of
Ooogee Beach was trumpeted forth, and since then
various persons have been airing their views. Through
all is manifest the fact that what is most objected to is
not that bathing at Ooogee gives pain to the dry and pious
looitei-on, but that it gives pleasure to the wet heretic
m the waves. One ingenuous correspondent to the daily
press gave the w hole show away by a fierce denunciation
ofbunday bathing under any conditions. Like the ancient
Ohnstian who regarded washing as an invention of the
Lvil One, and who had to he dragged to the lions by
Koman soldiers holding their noses, the modern variety
still looks with suspicion upon cold water, and marks
ac *dicted to its use as, at any rate, potential sinners.
the writer happened to be at Coogee on the date of the
aUeged awfulness, and was entirely unaware that
Vr occurred, until he saw the Evening News on
Monday. As a matter of fact, the allegations were piffle
trom beginning to end. Misconduct, as misconduct is
generally understood, there was none. There was some
mud horseplay, but it was no worse than what may
be found at many a Sunday-school picnic, with the pastor
in charge smiling benignly upon it. The whole objec-
tion seemed to arise from the fact that the youths and
maidens concerned were clothed in bathing costumes
rather than in coats, trousers, blouses, and skirts. It is
the innocence of the bathers which arouses hostility.
They have become so accustomed to their abbreviated
garments that they forget that they are not fully clothed.
They are partially naked and unashamed, and the protest
of Snuffledom arises from the fact that they do not clothe
their minds with self-conscious fig-leaves.
The popular idea of importing ideas from some other
place has led a number of good people to advocate the
adoption of European conditions in Sydney surf-bathing.
It is necessary to point out that the conditions here differ
absolutely from those which obtain at Brighton, Scar-
borough, or Boulogne. The European bathing places, to
begin with, are not situated right at the doors of big
cities. They are in comparatively out-of-the-way places,
and nine-tenths of the bathers consist of the tourist
class—well-to-do people who have money to burn, at any
rate during an annual holiday. It is this fact that leads
the dainty Parisienne to go to Boulogne with somebody
else’s husband and appear on the beach attired in what is
termed a “more modest” costume than her Australian
sister, who works six days a week behind Make Eoy’s
counter. The Parisienne, moreover, regards the beach
merely as an excuse for the display of a pretty bathing-
dress ; if she were to wet her feet it would be the event
of her life. Any of the hundreds of our brown girls of
Manly or Bondi or Coogee would astonish Europe were
they to dash out into the depths and shoot in
again, riding for 30 yards on top of tire biggest
breaker. Bathing in Europe is a social function
restricted more or less to the moneyed classes. In Aus-
tralia, it is the sport of the democracy, and everybody
with eighteenpenee for a costume and a tram fare may
participate in it. In Europe, those who actually do
bathe are taken out to sea in cumbersome caravans calltd
bathing machines, and some of the Australian extremists
are advocating a similar course here. How many machines
would be required to accommodate the crowds which turn
up at Manly on hot Sundays? It would require a skilled
accountant to reckon. The bathing machine is a necessity
on many English beaches, where the tide runs out some-
times two miles. Here nothing- of the sort occurs, and
the dressing shed meets all requirements.
One objection raised is that bathers stand and lie on
the beach instead of remaining in the water continuously.
The habitual bather holds that the sun-bath is as im-
portant as the bath itself, and it is difficult to see why a
man or woman standing in six inches of water should be
more decent than the same man or woman standing on
dry sand.
It is alleged that in England and France women bathers
always wear skirts—which is a long way off the truth, the
skirt costume being seldom seen in the fashionable water-
ing places of Europe. But more important is the fact
that, while the undertow is practically unknown in the
Old World, Sydney’s beaches are almost invariably
treacherous. During the present season, no fewer
than 100 persons have been carried out and recovered
at Bondi alone, and, in nearly every instance, the women
saved were skirt-wearers, who attributed their loss of
power to their skirts becoming entangled round their
legs. And as far as “ decency ”is concerned the skirt is
a delusion and a snare. The first wave strikes it and it
bunches up round the waist of the wearer, presenting a
caricature of a woman. For all the purposes of bathing,
as distinguished from mere show, nobody but a mental
pervert could discover indecency in the costumes hitherto
worn by Sydney’s girl bathers. They reveal
their figures, it is true, but unless a woman’s
figure is in itself something disgraceful, they
are certainly calculated to shock nobody without a clot
on his brain. They are serviceable, they are neat; and
many a woman has escaped death by wearing one instead
of the elaborate garb prescribed by the Puritans. For a
country that can ill afford to spare any of its people,
especially its women, the costumes should he left as they
are.
And, if the alleged misconduct does occur, it can easily
be reached by existing laws. People who misconduct
themselves in King-street, Sydney, do not require special
laws applicable to King-street to reach them. They can
be run in and fined under any old law, and the same
treatment can be meted out to those who abuse their
privileges at the ocean beaches. Still, underlying the
whole outcry is the endeavor to force the Presbyterian
Sawbath on people who don’t want it. Had the Coogee
“misconduct” taken place on a Wednesday, nobody
would have heard a word about it.
Sweat and Crime.
Some notice will have to be taken of the premium
which is placed on crime by those whited sepul-
chres of respectability, the Australian banks.
Clerks are taken in on nominal salaries of £25 to
£4O a year. Gradually, very gradually—£s at a
time—they move up to £75 or £BO, and there they
stick for any number of years. Most banks pro-
hibit their clerks from marrying until they are in
receipt of £l6O a year, and for most clerks this is
equivalent to a vow of celibacy ; but in the more
“ economical ” banks the directors allow clerks to
take unto themselves wives when they reach the
alpine affluence of £lOO a year. These miserably-
paid, well-dressed, and sometimes actually hungry
clerks have to toil amongst piles of money. Thou-
sands of pounds pass through their hands every
day. Is it any wonder that some of it sticks ?
But the banks don’t prosecute except when driven
to it. They love to collect the money from the
relatives of the person with the shortage. There
are numerous reasons. The chief one is that a
succession of known and acknowledged frauds
would cause the depositors to become alarmed,
and business would suffer. This would mean loss
to the shareholders. The cost of inquiry and
prosecution would also mean loss to the share-
holders. If the shareholders become alive to the
situation, they miyht alter things, and insist on
higher wages being paid. But shareholders jtre
seldom like that. They would probably wreak thVir
anger on the management, and leave the clerks
as they are, though the only possible way to stop
the continual defalcations is to pay the clerks
properly. It is impossible to estimate the
amount embezzled every year in any bank. In
the first place, the amounts stated in prosecutions
are merely nominal, and often represent only a
twentieth part of the money actually taken. In
the second place, 90 per cent, of the embezzle-
ments are hushed up, and the clerks quietly
sacked, while probably 5 per cent, of the em-
bezzlements are never sheeted home to the culprits
at all. Still, some idea of the magnitude of the
thing may be gathered from the prosecutions
In the Heart of Holy Europe!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the heart of holy Europe, whence our forbears
all have sprung,
There is tumult, there is turmoil, there is woe
without a tongue;
There’s a Czar to whom they murmur—“ Lord of
Russia, this is well ! ”
While his Inner Soul advises —“Lord of Russia,
this is Hell! ”
In the heart of holy Europe there are myriad
armed men,
And from Vendee to the Volga blood and rapine
hold a den ;
And the haughty Hohenzbllern, when the trumpets
cease to blare,
Ranging round his camp at even, finds a hall of
Sodom there.
In the heart of holy Europe, noble Austria’s noblest
head
Waxes grey and waxes feeble, for the slieaf of
years have sped ;
And the Teuton and the Magyar and the Croat
watch and wait
Who shall draw the sword the soonest when the
Hearse is at the Gate.
In the heart of holy Europe there are Savages
who lust
But to feel a moment’s freedom from the chains
that clank and rust ;
There are torches ever burning, there is powder
ever laid ;
There are better heroes waiting, ever ’wake and
unafraid.
There are mem’ries of the martyrs who in Free-
dom’s name have died ;
There are curses for the butcher, and the sacrificial
tide;
There’s a bitter vengeful Ocean sweeping on with
fearful speed,
O’er the tiny bulrush bulwarks of a half-forgotten
Creed.
For the heart of holy Europe waxes weak with
doting days,
And the bay’nets of her Rulers turn and point
forbidden ways;
And her mighty ammunition ’neath her massive
keep and hall
Holds an ending and a blending for her Serfs and
Sorrows all.

undertaken by one of the associated banks
in Melbourne during the last two months
of last year. This was the Commercial Bank
of Australia. On November 8, 1907, Andrew
Clyne, receiving teller at the Prahran (Vic.)
branch of the bank, was arrested for having mis-
appropriated £l7B belonging to the great recon-
structed institution. He had been many yearsinthe
bank’s employ, had worked hard for advance-
ment, was a married man with a family, and was
in receipt of the princely salary of £l2O a year.
At the Supreme Court on November 15 he was
convicted. To fill his place Harold Henry
Gillies, who had been stationed at Yarrawonga
(Vic.), was brought down to Prahran. He also
received £l2O a year. He had been seven years
in the bank’s service. On December 7 he was
arrested and charged with the larceny as a ser-
vant of £250. Alexander Brown Mclntosh
was in charge of the bills and cheque books de-
partment of the head office of the bank in Mel-
bourne. All the bills business of the bank passed
through his hands. The stamps and cheque books
were in his charge. He had unlimited opportunity
for fraud. Also he had been in the employ of the
bank for eight years, and his salary was
exactly £BO a year. On December 24 he re-
ceived a Christmas box in the shape of
arrest on a charge of larceny as a servant of £lBl.
Previous to that case, Hubert Roy Dixon, an
accountant in the Bourke-street branch of the
bank, had sat down and viewed his position.
After years of service he found himself still under-
paid and hopeless. His only prospect of a rise
was a “ steal,” and he was not prepared for that.
So he bought a revolver, and in the grey morning
of November 26 blew out his brains. There was
no verdict of manslaughter brought in against the
bank. Some shareholders have already become
alarmed, and decided that things must be put
on a better footing, and at the last half-yearly
meeting of one bank the directors were instructed
to set aside a portion of the profits—which were
large—as bonuses for the employees. The directors
set apart £2OOO for this purpose. The bank
employs 1200 men. To split £2OOO among them
would have been absurd, so it was partitioned
thus General manager, £l5OO ; two senior
inspectors, £2OO each; chief accountant, £5O ;
and two pet clerks, £25 each. Surely this
little accumulation of evidence —only a few items
from an overwhelming weight of it—should show
plainly that the methods of the big Australian
banks require sorting out. There is no reason in
the world why the Australian Parliament should
not assume control. Banking law is its business,
and the body which provides law and justice for
the banks should also see that decent wages and
fair conditions are provided for the banks’ em-
ployees.

Not Wanted on the Voyage.
Melbourne is just a trifle horrified at the revela-
tions made in the Coroner’s Court at the inquest
on a clutch of not-wanted babies who were killed
off during the recent spell of hot weather. A
nurse, Mrs. Madge Clayton, out at Preston,
had 12 of these unfortunate infants in her care.
All of them were found to be ill. The inspector—
appointed under the Infant Life Protection
Act—who visited the nurse’s “ home ” and dis-
covered the horrors, gave thefollowing evidence
The Coroner : What did you find when you got to the
house ?—I found it quiet; too quiet to please me for the
number of children. I found there were 12 in the house.
It is a six-roomed brick house. In one room, a good-
sized room, I found six babies. There were others in
another room, and one was outside. Most of the children
were suffering from dysentery. The children were so
dirty that I was affected for a couple of days. The child-
ren were in boxes and in makeshift beds. The bed cloth-
ing was ragged and dirty.
Do you mean not reasonably clean?—Not at all reason-
ably clean. There were four children in a makeshift bed,
which was not so good as having boxes for them.
And some more evidence :
It was stated that one child’s legs were tied together
with a piece of rag on the ankles to keep him from
kicking and disturbing other babies in the same cot or
box. There were four babies in the structure of 4ft.
long, which was smelling and dirty. A former servant at
the establishment said that when the children cried they
were put on the floor and given a good smacking until
they stopped. Another domestic, who was at Nurse
Clayton’s when she removed from Whittlesea to Preston,
on Christmas Eve, said that in the train some of the
children were put in the hatracks, and others on the
seats and floor. Some of the children had their legs tied,
and one had its arms tied to prevent it taking the teat
out of its mouth.
All the babies were, on January 17, removed to
the Government depdt for neglected children.
Five of them died—one on January 18, three on
January 19, and one on January 24. The rest
were kept alive with the greatest difficulty. In
four of the cases the pathologist who made the
post-mortems reported as follows :
Baby Nichols, greatly emaciated ; weight, 61b. ; cause
of death, exhaustion, with mild colitis of apparently long
duration, probably due to some bowel affection, accele-
rated by the heat of the weather. Baby Boardman—
reduced almost to skin and bone ; weight, 51b. ; cause of
death, bronchial pneumonia, with bowel changes of colitis
of about two or three weeks’ duration. Baby Barnes—
body in good condition; weight, 9£lb. ; cause of death,
colitis of about 10 days’ duration. Baby Oakley —body
that of a puny infant; weight, sJlb.; cause of death,
entero-colitis.
And then the Coroner said there was not suffi-
cient evidence to warrant a trial for manslaughter.
In Heaven’s name what would be sufficient ? If
those allegations are true, Mrs. Madge Clayton
ought not to spend another day of her life out of
gaol. If they are not true, it is a horrible injustice
to give her no chance of disproving them before a
jury. It is the more essential to do something,
because the case isn’t by any means an isolated one.
The same sort of thing goes on in dozens and dozens
of places round Melbourne. Under the Infant Life
Protection Act there is apparently provision for
the strictest supervision ; but the omniscient and
übiquitous Policeman X is the person to whom
the supervision is entrusted. The large, hulking,
well-meaning bobby doubtless does his best, but
he isn’t an expert, and he hulks too much, and he
can be heard coming while still a mile away, and
the hand that arrests the big fighting drunk isn’t
exactly the one to rock the cradle. The whole
thing is a pitiful tragedy full of tears and heart-
rack. There is only one course to be adopted from
both the humane and the economic standpoint.
The boarding-out of infants should be abolished
altogether and the State should assume control.
The casual child is, thanks to society, a burden
and a shame to its parents, and society must be
prepared to care for it. A well-equipped State
home, or series of homes, would enable the State to
realise one of its most valuable assets—an asset
which at present is allowed to serve as mere
material for inquests.

•Governors can be allowed, without mischief, to
speak freely is that concerning the threatened
abolition of their own jobs. It would be unfair
to gag them on that point. Even though it is
rarely that the proposed abolition of State
Governors means that his minor Excellency’s sole
means of livelihood is attacked, still the minor
Excellency has the same moral right to be heard
on the proposed confiscation of his frill as the
frilled lizard would have if it was proposed to
deprive him of his neck ornament. If, indeed,
State Governors were to form a union and make
an organised effort to put their case before the
public no possible objection could be raised.
There being, unfortunately, no union, Governor
Talbot, of Victoria, has come forward to state
the case for himself and the other threatened
potentates: —
It would really be almost affectation to assume that I
am ignorant that a certain campaign is being waged
against Governors. I know that this campaign has been
undertaken with sincerity. With me it is not a personal
question at all. I am absolutely independent. It is no
small sacrifice to a man at my time of life to leave his
friends and an ever-narrowing circle of kinsfolk behind,
to spend his few remaining years in a distant land. I can
only say that I don’t think the question of State Gover-
nors has been discussed from the right point of view.
Supposing Victoria wants to do away with the State
Governors appointed from Home. In the first place, it is
the silken thread that binds her to the Mother-country.
It is, however, something more. It is a strand of wireless
telegraphy. You ought not to forget how much every
State depends upon the Empire, and how the centre
depends upon the extremities. The connecting link
should not be lightly done away with. Supposing a State
constitutional question is raised, and that it is admitted
that there is no use for State Governors appointed from
Home ; you will then have either Governors appointed
by the Commonwealth or elected Governors. In either
case, the man who would succeed would become a politi-
cal factor, dependent upon the ebb and flow of politics.
It is most undesirable that this should be so.
There is really nothing in this case to call for an
answer, except the silken thread argument. (As to
a State Governor being “a strand of wireless
telegraphy,” the mere fact that he has to use the
cable in the usual way when he communicates
with England knocks out that argument even
more suddenly than Burns knocked out Squires. )
The theory that the local State Governor would
necessarily, or even probably, become a political
factor is quite effectively disposed of by practical
experience. Over 100 times has a local man been
in charge of the local Governor’s job in one State
or another—in N.S.W. this has happened for
periods of 10 months, 18 months, and six months;
in Queensland, for 13 months at a stretch; in
S.A., for 12 months consecutively; in Victoria,
for 12 months, 12 months, and 23 months; in
Westralia, for 10 months, 10 months, and nine
months. And Governor Talbottle can’t find,
in all these cases, one instance to prove
that the locally-manufactured Governor is a
shade less impartial than the imported one.
He must evidently hang his case by the silken
thread argument; and there The Bulletin is
with him. Undoubtedly the State Governors are
ornamental—at times, when they are not elderly
and stout and busily employed in falling off. But
—can we afford them ? Are we in a position—debt-
burdened, with the shadow of enormous future
defence expenditure hanging over us—to put an
unnecessary silk stripe into our good woollen
homespun ? Perhaps Governor Talbot, or one of
the other Governors, will throw a little light on
that point.

Premier Wade issued a manifesto on the day
before the first election under the new N.S.W.
municipal law. He stuffed it mostly with Anti-
Sosh, and the poor old bogey didn’t smell any the
sweeter for having been so long in the tomb.
Wade referred at great length to “ the disastrous
results of municipal trading ” in Great Britain,
and alleged that “Lord Avebury, a man of light
and leading,” had “shown conclusively, by indis-
putable facts and most recent statistics,” that the
London County Council’s undertakings have been
“ ghastly failures ” and a lot of other fearful things
besides. Wade, of course, couldn’t be expected to
be fair enough to point out that, on account of the
shrieks of Avebury and others, Edwin Water-
house, the leading accountant of London (of Price,
Waterhouse and Co.), was called in lately, made
an overhaul of the London County Council’s
affairs, and punctured the whole bundle of lies on
which Wade bases his manifesto. Anti-Sosh was
so sure that Sosh was the horror pictured by
Avebury and others that, when the L.C.C. hesi-
tated to pay the expenses of Waterhouse’s over-
haul, it offered to itself put up £5OOO for the
purpose. So Waterhouse tackled the business,
and, according to cables printed inconspicuously
by the Anti-Sosh Australian dailies in November
last, found that, instead of being “ ghastly
failures,” the L.C.C. undertakings “indicate
sound and careful management,” and, instead of
being in the alleged state of muddlement, “ there
are efficient and accurate records of its trans-
actions.” Anti-Sosh called a Daniel to
judgment; and it was so cock-sure as to what the
judgment would be that it offered to put up
£5OOO to pay Daniel’s expenses. Yet this is the
judgment it got. In England since then there
ha.s been dead silence about the L.C.C.’s “ghastly
failure”; but the old busted lie is still good
enough for Wade, of N. S. Wales, to base a
manifesto upon. It is hard to say what garbage-
box refuse would be too decayed for Wade’s
purposes.
♦
Apropos of nothing, the cable mumbled the other
day a sentence or two re our naval prospects.
The mumble consisted of sixteen words, and was
to the effect that “many leading naval experts
consider that the employment of submarines is
quite unadapted to Australian defence.” The
names of the “leading experts” were not given,
nor was it explained why submarines weren’t
suited to Australia. In the absence of any
details it is impossible to form an esti-
mate of the value of the cable’s sleepy
announcement, but what Australia does know is
that the British Admiralty regards it as a dump-
ing ground for old naval ironmongery, and has
always been unwilling to send out really service-
able ships. In view of this country’s past experi-
ences with the British sea-lords, it would be quite
justified in treating the opinions of the so-called
English experts with a certain suspicion. The
present policy of concentrating the strength of the
sea arm in the two or three fleets that watch over
London leaves no up-to-date vessels for the back-
blocks of the Empire, and it may be in order that
the back-blocks will not ask for submarines that
these are declared to be “ unadapted to Australian
defence.” In any event, whether the “ opinions ”
are honest or otherwise, it is worth remembering
that Admiral Germtnet, of the French navy—
presumably also something of an expert—lately
expressed the opinion that the boasted Dread-
nought is a huge mistake. He said the big ship
was designed on the supposition that Togo’s suc-
cess at Tsushima was due to the greater weight of
his ships’ armaments, whereas it was now recog-
nised that it was the tremendous explosive capacity
of the Jap shells that gave the victory to the brown
man. The world will have to wait for the next
big naval row to see if the Frenchman is right or
wrong, but his condemnation of the reignina craze
in naval matters recalls the fact that authorities
differ. Also, some authorities differ more than
others.
«
N.S.W. Premier Wade tries to resurrect the
Sosh bogey in a manifesto, warning the municipal
electors to vote against Labor candidates :
The disastrous results of municipal trading have been
brought to light in Great Britain and the United States
during the past few years.
People of the United Kingdom are paying oyer
£68,000,000 per annum more in taxes and about the same
in rates more than they were paying 10 years ago—
between the two they are paying over £130,000,000 per
annum more! Ratepayers of New South Wales, think
over these figures ! We wish to emphatically impress
upon the people of New South Wales that there are
insidious perils lurking in the schemes for the unlimited
extension of the powers of local governing bodies to
trading enterprises and other socialistic concerns, whose
pernicious effects it would be indeed difficult to ex-
aggerate.
It may be objected that the municipal and shire
councils in New South Wales cannot in any case lawfully
exercise any powers outside those prescribed in the
Local Government Act. How many people have carefully
considered what those powers are, and what they might
result in ?
And it was a Government of which Wade was a
member that passed theN.S. W. Local Government
Act, and gave to municipalities all the Socialistic
powers of which Wade now sees the terrible
dangers. Either Wade was utterly oblivious to
his ideas of the public interest when he gave the
municipalities and shires these new Socialistic
opportunities, or he is a brazen humbug now in
declaring that there is a danger if they are
utilised.
Ben Tillett, the English Labor leader, delivered a
farewell address in Melbourne, two or three days
ago; and the report shows that Benjamin is the
same old, dreamy, impracticable person as he was
when he arrived. The idea of taking one step at
a time simply drives Ben mad. Unless he can
cover a mile in one jump, he declines to move at all.
As thus :
When he thought of the iniquities of Capitalism, he was
not only a Socialist, but a rebel and a revolutionary.
There was no palliative, no middle course, no “ practical
bits at a time.” The people must rouse in rebellion and
see that the existing system was swept away. (Cheers.)
It is weary “guff.” Ben and his crowd never
rebel. They never even issue plans and specifica-
tions for a rebellion. They don’t so much as pro-
fess to be organising a rebellion. They wouldn’t
know how to build a barricade if they tried, and
some of them hardly know one end of a gun from
another. There is hardly a brownish kid in a
Central American city who doesn’t know more of
the business than they do, and who wouldn’t
make a more promising leader for an insurrection.
Apparently the situation is simply that these
blatant imported characters don’t know how to
draft even the simplest measure of reform, so they
avoid the necessity by preaching instead a revolu-
tion which they know will never come. They are
in the position of the preacher person who also
doesn’t know how to draft a scheme of reform, so
gets out of the difficulty by the easy device of
assuring the poor and suffering that all will be
put right in the next world. The preacher’s
Heaven and Ben Tillett’s revolution are the
same easy shirking of present responsibility.
Meanwhile men like Watson, Trenwith, Price
and Kidston wade in and do things one at a time.
The Tilletts don’t know how to do things one at
a time, or any other way, so they jeer at this
patient progress, and offer instead their unsup-
ported promise that at some time unspecified
there will be a great breakage and smash and
bloodshed, which may easily leave things a great
deal worse than they are. And these mouthing
revolutionists look deplorably like the youngest
gentleman at Mrs. Todgers’ boardinghouse—the
one who was always on the verge of borrowing a
pistol and firing it wildly at Jenkins.

George Reid spoke a few words the other day to
a newspaper on the subject of unification. Here
is a sample:—
If there were a poll taken on the question of unification
or dissolution of the Federal bond, I believe that in almost
every one of the six States, if not the whole six, the vote
would go for dissolution rather than unification. If the
people had come to think more of the Federation in its
practical working than they do the result might be other-
wise. But they have come to think much less of it than
they did.
And then, just as he might have made some in-
teresting remarks as to why they think less of it
(assuming that they do think less of it), he stopped.
Here are two matters he might have quoted but
didn’t
This, then, is the extent of the [Australian piano-
making] industry at present, and, as it has been indicated,
it is never likely to be increased, for the simple reason
that anyone desiring to set up further factories would be
prevented from introducing the necessary trained work-
men by the operation of the well-known exclusion law
which kept out the famous six hatters. I believe it is a
fact that even tuners sent out by well-known European
firms to look after their instruments have been excluded
in this way .—Loudon Truth.
Although there are great territories of tropical Aus-
tralia where the labor of white men is useless, the intro-
duction of the alien is forbidden under the severest
penalties. To such a length is this carried that the
civilised world was shocked a few years ago to learn that
16 Chinese and 11 Malays, being shipwrecked off Mel-
bourne, were forbidden to land, and would have perished
had it not been for the kindness of the captain of a mail
steamer, who clothed and fed the half-drowned wretches.
And that steamer was a Japanese vessel, manned and
officered by Japs ! — English magazine.
It is a lie that the “famous six hatters” were
kept out. The exclusion of piano-tuners is a lie.
The leaving of the famous wrecked Chinese and
Malays to perish was a lie. All these lies were
invented and circulated by the infamous anti-
Australians who follow George Reid, and this
was done solely in order to make the people
“think much less of the Commonwealth than
they did.” A small crowd of Foreign-traders,
Tories and anti-Socialists, who deserve to be
hanged higher than Haman, have filled the
world with these foul and cowardly slanders,
and with dozens of others less notorious. And
they have even gained some credence in Australia,
wherefore certain people don’t think nearly as
much of the Commonwealth as they might do.
But George Reid, considering the company he
keeps, is the last man who should say anything
about that.

“THE DAIRYMAIDS.”
Marjory rises at half-past six,
She grooms the ducklings and feeds the chicks,
She wakens the birdlets that doze in the trees;
“ It is time to be out,” she remarks to the bees.
Then down to the orchard she merrily trips—
Mark the cherries upon her lips !
On through the meadows sweet with hay,
She joins the lambkins in innocent play ;
In and out through the coppice she leads,
Then back to the farmyard Marjory speeds;
Merrily, merrily under the boughs
(You’ll observe that so far there’s an absence of
cows).
Then, after the chicks and the birds and the bees,
Marjory looks to her neat number threes—
They’re patent leather, and high in the heel
(Here a glance at voluptuous frillies you steal) —
She spends an hour at her manicure,
Frizzes her hair at the end of a skewer.
Then merrily, merrily down to the stile
(Be still, little heart, for a while, for a while !),
He’s the son of a baronet, maybe an earl,
And O ! how he dotes on the dairymaid girl!
So they pledge their troth, and they plight their
vows
(Please note the continued absence of cows).
Still, there’s a pump in the yard, and that
gives something of an air of reality to what would
otherwise be a frivolous deception and a plump
and shapely snare. The plot is, however, fre-
quently mislaid, not being as conspicuous as a pyra-
mid or even a pea; and most of the time the new
piece at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, might be “ The
Nursery-maids,” or just “Maids,” without any
further specification. The jokes are nearly all
old and toothless and terrible, and now and again
the dialogue is so poor that it would make a min-
strel entertainment blush. The doubtful salvation
of the whole thing depends on two or three bright
ideas turned into song nr songandanee, one or two
situations of the “screaming farce” school, and
that other bright idea of the gymnasium at the
Pyechase Academy, which permits the whole
female force of the Royal Comics to display its
understandings to the very best advantage.
Otherwise poor as it is, “ The Dairymaids ” may
be a popular success, for on a liberal display of
liberal understandings even a poor musical
comedy may travel a long way.
» * * •
Except in the matter of dancing the Royal
Comics are nowadays weak, and they are weaker
in this than during the Melbourne performance,
which was blessed with Florence Young’s voice and
vitality. The weakness is all the more obvious
because Roberts has no song to sing. The songs
that the others sing are remembered chiefly for
the ornamental frills that flap around them. Miss
Fanny Dango in this way scores the greatest suc-
cess of the evening with “Tinker, Tailor,” in
which she demonstrates that when a pretty woman
crooks her little finger, every man—“ tinker,
tailor . . . thief’’—crooks his knee ; and so on to
the merry conclusion wherein she drives the whole
team in front of her, harnessed to gay ribbons;
Q.E.D. Lauri has a less fantastic part than usual,
and in the comparatively sober dress of Joe Mivens,
A. 8., spends much time in canoodling with ’Liza.
Miss Connie Milne is ’Liza, and ’Liza is a very
good character study, with, of course, the usual
musical-farcedy interruptions. Leslie takes first
place as a comedian, and presents an uneven per-
formance that at times is excellent; when b e and
Miss Fan Dango dance, things are at their best.
Miss Godwin sings the principal songs, sweetly,
daintily, yet without much distinction ; and the
honeyed word also belongs to Miss Maher, Miss
Temple, Bantock, the scenic artist, the carpenter,
and two little women who put up what looks like a
willing go with the gloves during the Sandow-Girl
proceedings in the Pyechase gymnasium.

“ The Scarlet Pimpernel ” will be up-

“Charley’s Aunt” arrives at Sydney
Criterion, from the nut-strewn shores of Brazil,

“Lured to London ” is understood to embody in
itself all that the drama may hold of Horror and
Gloom. It is a marrow-freezer. This is a season
when anything that freezes any part of the human
form is acceptable, so “ Lured,” etc., should
succeed. Of course a cold southerly may arise,
and then people won’t want to freeze with horror,
but in a variable climate it is necessary to take
chances.

THREEPENCE PER COPY.
THE Editor emerges from beneath an avalanche
of matter to thank the army of writers and
artists who, in response to his advertisements, have
done him the honor of proffering their services, or
submitting their work for his consideration. Many
of these will, ere this, have received postal replies ;
but the volume of correspondence has been so great
that to reply to all has been an impossibility.
In most cases, the work of those who have not yet
been answered by post, is being held for further con-
sideration ; and, if they will contain themselves in
patience a little longer, the Editor hopes to forward
them, presently, a substantial solatium for his
dilatoriness.
The Editor also desires to thank the numerous
correspondents whose cordial good wishes for the
success of his venture have done much to encourage
him in his arduous task. The delight everywhere
manifested at the prospect of the establishment in
Melbourne of a paper which will not be a mere cr-> wl-
some record of the doings of wealthy nonent). .es,
makes him feel confident that “Comments” has a
bright future before it. Indeed, he ventures to pre-
dict that the launching of “Comments” will cause
as great a literary sensation as did the launching of
“ The Lone Hand ” ; and he advises readers either
to forward a subscription (yearly, half-yearly, or
quarterly) direct to the office, or to order from their
newsagent at once, lest they be disappointed in
their efforts to obtain copies. Subscriptions should
be addressed: The Manager of “Comments,” 392 a

usual solemn deliberations, and, against all the
traditions of the House, were to indulge in an un-
constitutional proceeding, something like a May-
pole prance, called “La Danse de Rubans.” The
ceremony of prorogation, or the rising of the
Court just before the interval, was likewise
entirely different from the ordinary run of
the ceremony. Thoughtful people will de-
plore this dangerous experiment of departing
from ancient forms. The Artois Brothers
gladden the eye with some fine horizontal-bar
work. Their clever turn is spiced with comedy,
and is a pleasant feature in a bill that occasionally
falls from grace. Alma Gray—a larger Alma than
of yore —in a natty little costume of red and
brown, with a brown slouch hat and a rifle, does
some exhilarating step-dancing ; but the music of
her Australian song is too distinctly coon melody.
Ernest Leicester is intensely serious in a damp,
stormy, life-boat recitation ; the Wheelers do im-
possible things with bioycles, and the rest of the
company is deserving of more or less frantic
applause.

The Herbert Flemming Co. lighted “ The
Red Lamp” at Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday
night. The programme describes it as a drama
by Outrain Tristram, played at a London theatre,
March, 11)07. It is quite an old play, however ;
away back in November, 1887, it was staged at
Sydney Royal, with Anson, Flemming (then
thinner than he is now), Phil Beck (deceased),
Isabel Morris and Pattie Browne in the
front-row parts. The frenzied plot begins
to burble in the drawing-room of Princess
Claudia Morakoff (Beatrice Day), who is a rabid
Imperialist. She is entertaining her friends with
cigarettes, cards, and a commanding view of
the public square. On stage, music and
laughter are the order of the hour. Off
stage, Nihilists are being executed. The joyous
crowd constantly interrupts its own flow of
epigram and rant to rush to the balcony, and
watch six soldiers making very bad shots at one
stationary rebel. Claudia’s brother, Prince
Alexis, is secretly a Nihilist ; confessedly a
rhymster. Her husband is a baritone general.
Her closest friend is Demetrius, a very secret and
buttoned-up police official. Her worst enemy is
Ivan Zazzulic, an editor. Also, there is Alan
Villars, an American journalist, who has a six-
shooter, and too many scruples to earn his salt on
a suburban weekly. Once upon a time, Ivan the
Editor made amorous proposals to the haughty
Princess. She rejected his contribution with scorri,
and he never forgave her. Through his control of the
local S. M. Herald he has become chairman of a
dynamite league. Incidentally he enrolls Alexis,
and mentions the fact to Claudia. As the price
of her brother’s safety, he insists that the Princess
shall give warning of any sortie against the
Nihilists by placing the Red Lamp in the window.
Presently Demetrius —who is an Old Beast, but,
as Flemming depicts him, a most amusing one—
scents out Claudia’s secret, and gets into a restless
grinning habit of removing the Lamp. Claudia
has to call personally at the blowing-up de-
partment of the Nihilist office, to explain that the
Lamp has taken to walking in its sleep, and can’t
be depended on —that it has become a'roarer, in
fact, and is no longer reliable when taking its
fences, and its bowling has become inaccurate.
Her husband, guided by the Old Beast, discovers
her there, and family rows seem unavoidable.
* » * «
Then the last act sweeps through a maze of
murder and noise. Zazzulic tries to betray his
comrades and Claudia to the General. He comes
to the Palace, where Alexis tries to garrote him.
Being a poet, the Prince fails to do anything so
practical, and for his pains is stabbed in the back
with a horrid squelch by Ivan. Ivan is then
massacred by the resourceful exponent of yellow
journalism, who from the beginning shows
some jealousy of his reptile contemporary of
Russia. Claudia is embraced. And up stage
the Old Beast dines on his nails, remarking “I
wonder?”
* •* * *
Miss Day, as the Princess Claudia, is out
of her element in that character’s unintelligent
capers, and on first night she wasn’t word-perfect.
Two or three other superfluous ladies are not
impressive either. All the acting honors and
opportunities fall to Herbert Flemming, the
Lamp-Shifter, who plays Demetrius with unctu-
ous humor and a subtle nastiness that are quite
out of keeping with his make-up. Aubrey Malla-
lieu is cheerful and inane as the scribbling Ameri-
can. H. W. Varna plays the heavy villain in a
way that suggests tight boots, and in a very loud
voice. The remainder of the cast is efficient
enough, and very serious.

At Melbourne Royal, on Saturday night,
“ Camille ” received the attention of the Meynell
and Gunn Co. As a play, “ Camille ” always
invites comparisons. Folk instance previous in-
terpretations of the title-role, which varied from
the version in which the lady was a broad melo-
dramatic Flossie to that in which she was Diana
of Poictiers or thereabouts. Sometimes she was a
little more artistic and seductive, and sometimes a
little less, according to individual conceptions;
but always is “Camille” a somewhat unreal
aspect of aristocratic Flossiedom —an intensely
costly courtesan babbling of camellias and such.
Still people find her a tremendous attraction, even
if she isn’t very proper. From the supper of Act
1., where the lady betrays a sort of hysterical
gaiety, to her weepful decease in Act V., she is a
vivid moral lesson, significant of the rot following
the over-ripe vegetable ; while the sentimentalist
remarks “How pathetic!” So she satisfies all
parties. Some are prostrated in tears —others be-
hold a command and a heavenly sign : “Thoushalt
not be swift!” In the Meynell and Gunn version,
the tendency is, if anything, for elaboration in
treatment; but “ Camille ”is the more appealing
with a few fireworks—for ‘‘ Camille ” is melodrama.
And treating it strictly as melodrama, Miss
Madge Mclntosh, who adds her conception to be
filed for future reference, compared well with most
of her forerunners. In the first place, her dress-
ing (always an indication of temperament) is in
every way refined. There is not the generally
deplorable contrast between costumes in Acts 11.
and lll.—in one, say, bronze-green satin beneath
an overdress of filigree and silver planets ; and in
the following, the severe white of a virgin at her
first communion. In one case, Miss Mclntosh
affects a quiet evening costume of some
dark hue, while in the following act she
is attired in fawn and a blue flop-hat. Her
acting, especially in Acts 111. and LV., is
interesting as a spectacle of emotion, with
the addition of easy grace and the Bernhardtian
u n- ® lnuousne ss. Apart from a little over-
embellishment here and there, her Camille is
admirable. Likewise she dies with restraint
ana in a garret that, possibly, has echoed
~ the wa il of Virtue “in the
soup Harcourt Beatty assists with an Armand
on broad and emphatic lines. His voice, at
imes, is a little harsh for the cooing of endear-
ments too chmce for publication; but, in most
respects, he is a satisfactory mummer. Styan
makes a supportable Duval pere on the heavy
side; while De Varville, according to Gaston
Mervale, is deeply sardonic. About the others,
tiiere is a confusion of good and bad points that
arouse a little expostulation and a little flaccid
praise.

At Melbourne Her Majesty’s, the mon-
archy of King Solium (which Humpty-Dumptyan
personage was, at last Saturday matinee, Mr
Victor Loydall, vice Mr. Bert Gilbert, absent)
still expires in a blaze of glory. The reign begins
hopefully with an amazing, neurotic kinglet,
affecting red robes and a mimic crown. He is
petulant, but mighty. He may command cham-
pagne from a varlet in plush and gold bangles.
He may order the decease of a subject in an out-
lymg suburb of his realm. He may gamble in
millions; but he marries a vulgar lady with the
outward aspects and instincts of a washerwoman.
Hence declines his sovereignty; also his
treasurer hastens the end of a beautiful and illus-
trious drunk. By the way, the appearance of
Mrs. Young in the part of Prince Sprightly, on
Saturday night, was noted mostly as an indif-
ferent substitution.

At Wirth’s Olympia, the pictures of

point about the show is that the development of
incidents upon the sheet receives some aid from
the artificial hoof-beat, or crockery disaster, or
whatever it may be, behind the scenes. For
instance, a cavalry charge, with the assistance of
the vigorous clack of hoofs, grows from an
animated picture to a fairly tolerable actuality.
And that’s something, anyhow !

“Miss Lancashire, Ltd.,” which drew a
full house at Melbourne Bijou last Saturday
night, might be described as farcically tremen-
dous. The humor is of the broad piano-case
variety—like elephants at play—but it is in-
tensified by the rich, raw edge of a Lancashire
accent, and punctured with the portentous wink
of Miss Florence Baines. And the wink
is not an accident—it is a creation. Like
her backward kick, delivered with giddy
abandon , it signifies frivolous contempt, as much
as to say “ Rats ! ” The plot is based on the aged
idea of mistaken identity. Act I. presents the self-
satisfied Higgins explaining his position as trustee
for Miss Lancashire to his son and daughter, both
with the characteristic bleat of stage inanity.
According to Higgins, Miss Lancashire is a young
lady with cash reserves who, by special request of
her deceased parent, is to marry the calf-like
Higgins,/Ws; and, while the old man is suggesting
the flotation of the young person into a limited
liability company, a telegram announces her im-
mediate arrival. So the Higginses vanish for the
railway station, while the object of their approval
and eloquence floats into the public gaze as a
summer girl; introduces herself, and then de-
corates the atmosphere with a neat limb in a
white open-work stocking. With indifferent
skill she requests the audience to “ Smile on Me.”
Follows Miss Mary Ellen Thompson, the new
slavey from Lancashire, pursued by the family,
which naturally welcomes her as Miss Lanca-
shire. Mary E. becomes an alarming erup-
tion of taunts and bad manners. Now the large
animals aforementioned commence their turn, so
to speak, the pseudo Miss Lancashire (by
arrangement with the real) prodding them
to increased activity and breakages with
an accent like a steam hammer. She
astonishes and disgusts the company with her
outrageous masculinity ; calls everybody names
(ranging from “Monkey” to “Maggot”!) ahd
flops upon the plush furniture and cushions with
impudence, but without elegance. Furthermore,
she eats cherries out of a garden-hat; orders
'Welsh rabbit from “Monkey-face,” the butler,
and, discovering that the dish is cheese under
an alias, plasters the surroundings with food.
During the suggested flotation of herself into a
company, she sucks an orange and casts the pips
at a lawyer who is much like a tall, thin steeple
on fire. She will not be “floated” upon a
“ board ” ; she will have nothing to do with
“ bulls,” “ Lears,” or “ the bucket shop ” ; and so,
after considerable agitation, the end arrives with
its re-arrangement of identities and its yards of
explanation. Incidental to the progress of the
immense disturbance are songs and dances of the
vaudeville standard, Miss Baines’ “Laughing
Song ” being a sumptuously hilarious item. Miss
Baines herself is rather in the heavy-weight
division of humorists. Sometimes she suggests a
crayon enlargement of the pert Marie Lloyd ; but
most of the time she is Miss F. Baines, happy and
irrational, but just a trifle ordinary. Her support,
with the exception of Charles Brown, as Higgins
Senior, is remarkable when it is not grotesque, the
female element, especially, being painfully torpid.

The shew at Melbourne Opera House is
redundant with agile legs at present. The sisters
Klos add beautiful arms to their wonderful legs,
and are the most satisfactory collection of limbs
on the bill. Cn Wednesday—which for publi-
cation purposes is yesterday, though for writing
purposes it is to-morrow —Tom Burrows will
endeavor to beat his own record, though whether
he did it or not won’t be recorded here till next
week, which will then be this week. All of which
is akin to the complication about the letter that
was going to be written yesterday, only it had
already been posted to-morrow.

“ The Squatter’s Daughter,” arrived at last
at Adelaide Royal, proves to be of that well-worn
melodramatic type in which the villain, after
making an assertion, asks unnecessarily “Who
can prove that it is not so ? ” in order to allow the
comic man (who has no logical reason for being
within 300 miles of the spot) to jump from behind
a rock and say “I can.” But its Australian
setting and the beauty of its mounting have made
it a big success at popular prices.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Princes Court, Melbourne’s open-air side show and
chute resort, on the south side of the Yarra, committed
suicide or something last week, and some kind of caretaker
occupies hatzenjammer Castle and slides the chute on
his little own. The Court opened its doors on Saturday
nl j 6 m? r the cycle saucering which takes in the south
end. The walk to the saucer resembles a prowl in a
cemetery of dead fun. The other show place that used
to be Dreamland, at St. Kilda, has been carted away * so
the spot reverts to its natural state as a cow paddock.
DIPLOMACY.
“ Just got word to say I’ve won Tatt’s
sweep.”
“My dear boy, let me congratulate you. By
the way, if ever you want to borrow a
tenner you know where to apply, and—
er—er—you can do the same for me
some day, eh?”
“ D.”: Was haled by an enthusiastic friend last week to
see Edwin Boyde, the Sydney Tivoli star. Edwin has
been.engaged by a syndicate of London halls to sing to
Cockneydom for an incredible number of years at an
incredible figure. My friend explained this to me in an
awed whisper, and I was impressed muchly, and settled
down to some solid edification. It never came. Edwin
(a sad, afflicted-looking young man) wandered to the
footlights, holding in his right hand a colossal slice of
bread —it was at least two feet in circumference—liberally
be-jammed and buttered. He delivered, in a gentle,
muttering tone, a sort of recitative of which I failed to
grasp the purport. Then he bit off a large piece of bread
and jam, munched with ostentatious violence, and while
the house rocked at the jest, wheeled round, deftly spat
the fragment into his hand, as deftly deposited it (the
fragment) in his pocket and started on a fresh muttering
bout. The best of the joke came at the end. While
turning to eject an unusually large mouthful, Edwin over-
balanced, or something, and plunged head first into the
jam. He came up with about three-quarters of a pound
adhering to his left eye. Inconceivably droll was his next
actun. With a firm, dragging motion of the right hand
he swept the unpleasant-looking mass from his streaming
countenance, and slammed it decisively upon the bread.
As his mouth distended for yet a fourth bite I hurried
into the outer darkness, pondering on the supreme
mj'Stery of {the Londoner's sense of humor, and on the
weirdly unsavory things that make him laugh.
“ Jim ” Morrissey, the snake-charmer, continues to
wander round Victoria with a friendly smile and about
2cwt. of assorted serpents in a bag. The first thing he
seems to do on entering a new town is to be found asleep
in a quiet corner by a nervous policeman. The nervous
policeman thinks he is just the ordinary sort of drunk,
and arrests him and the bag in one heap. When they
arrive at the station, the sack is thrown in a corner, and
Morrissey—who is only tired through carrying snakes—is
dumped into a chair. The nervous policeman starts to fill
in the necessary papers. Half-way through, he hears a hiss
of scorn, and, looking up, sees three reptiles standing on
their tails with their jaws wide open, and about 35yds. of
prostrate relatives coming up behind like Blucher at the
battle of Beerloo. Then there is a wild yell, followed by
a series of thumps, and Morrissey wakes up to find a
strange man murdering his snakes. In the morning he
pays his fine for being found alive in a public place, and
goes forth to the forests to gather more jim-jams.

leaf performers alone. At La Perouse, within five miles
of the Tivoli itself, the band used to number fifteen. At
»ai cville Reach, near Windsor, the camp contained
man • brilliant exponents of the gum-leaf. Other places,
which have not hitherto received mention, are the
rungle camp, near Tumut, and the Warrangesda camp
on the Murrumbidgee. On the North Coast, the gum-
leaf performance has lost all its novelty and charm,
though none of its terrors. Take it any way you like, the
music isn t up to much, and is horribly reminiscent of
cat arguments. Personally, I prefer bagpipes.
“Hamer”: The advance-agent’s troubles have been
touched on now and again, and he has some. I once
went ahead of an alleged “comedy,” which, on the
assurance of the Henry Irving w'ho ran the show I
accepted as a very high-class exhibition indeed. On the
strength of its good qualities, I called on clergymen and
schools, and other respectable institutions, and pointed
out the educational advantages of the show, and said
that, as a noble and lofty concern, it deserved recognition,
then I met the show as 1 was on my way back to announce
return visits, and thought I had struck a mudeart drawn
by a nightmare. It consisted mostly of crude, semi-
decent songs, and absolutely indecent jokes, and rather
overdone skirt-dancing. I turned cold at the idea of
facing the indignant clergymen and schoolmasters, and
other justly-enraged citizens. I turned so cold that I
didn t face them—l resigned on the spot. Rut on my
way back to Sydney I met one of the clergymen, and he
told me how much he had enjoyed the performance, and
said that, though he usually condemned the stage' this
high-class and enjoyable programme had made him
modify his views. I thought it was satire, but that
parson was as serious as the S. M. Herald when it talks
about things that are un-British. He didn’t know anv
better. In his innocence, he hadn’t seen the inwardness
of the jokes.

of acknowledged literary ability has given the comic
opera serious attention, for such an item as “ The Rose of
Persia ’ only one oasis in a vast unmelodious wil-
derness. But even if Shaw is sufficiently humorous
ingenious, and satirical, where is his Sullivan ? The com-
bination of Sullivan and Gilbert was not merely a happy
chance—it was a dispensation of Providence. And
Providence may not dispense again.
“ Pica” : Once saw “ The Breaking of the Drought,” as
played on the Namoi after a long dry spell. Money was des-
perately tight, but only a few privileged individuals had
the power to become even moderately so. Temperance
grew contagious as a necessity rather' than a virtue, and
the local lodge of Good Templars boomed. The Worthy
Chief, the Chief who was once Worthy, and the Vice-
Chief carried the banner and the infection to a Gwydir
township. Three score reformed grog-sinkers toed the mark,
and “ swore-off ” Bung at the opening of the new lodge.
Next day heavy rain set in and continued for a week.
The coach tracks were impassable, and the weather-
bound visiting brethren, lacking other means of diversion,
took just one to celebrate the rain, and they gradually
“ back-slid ” on the broad track that always (on the
Gwydir) leads to the beer-emporium. The trio had a
good time liquidating the lodge funds and slaking their
long pent-up thirsts. The Worthy Chief finally fought
tha Past Worthy six mixed rounds, and the Vice-Chief
had to be rescued from snakes.

A NEW ARRIVAL.
“ Pooh, anyone can see her Ascension robe's been
turned! ”
In the “Sir John Marwick” case, the
week before last, a really alert bit of detecting
was done. After the bogus bart. had run his
flagrant course for some time, Vic. sleuth
Macmanamny observed that he wore a celluloid
collar. This appealed instantly to the brain of
the law as a Clue. Mac argued with some astute-
ness that a British bart. might borrow money,
commit Monte Carlo murders, run scores at pubs,
go on the stage, look like an underpaid pawn-
broker’s assistant, and generally play Sheol—
and yet would draw the line at celluloid collars.
It is a notable fact that in the entire history of
crime no malefactor above the rank of a J.P. has
ever been snared who sported celluloid neck-
fencing.
Statistician G. H. Knibbs, in his quarterly
bulletin of vital statistics, issued a little while
ago, gives some interesting figures about suicides.
During three months 115 Australians quitted life
of their own act and accord. Men run to suicide
more than women, for of the total 93 were
males and only 22 females. The suicide age for
women varies from 15 to 69 years. Women who
get up to or beyond 70 don’t seem to worry about
death. They are content to wait. In between
15 and 69 years there seems to be no particular
age at which they prefer to get out. Between 15
and 24 years, when the romantic side of things is
seen by most women, the melodramatic method
of suicide is favored. The love-sick woman
always takes poison if she is young. All the
female suicides between 15 and 24 years poisoned
themselves. “ There they found her with a smile
on her beautiful inscrutable face,” as the penny
novelette would say, and that is how these young
women suicides think and act. Of all the ways there
are of putting an end to oneself women funk most
on firearms and cutting-instruments. On the other
hand men regard a revolver as the first essential. In
proof of this, 28 men used firearms to suicide with,
but only one woman could screw up her courage
that far. In the same way, 21 men used razors
or knives, but only one woman (curiously enough
she used a pair of scissors, and stuck one blade into
her heart). Males retain the tendency to
suicide to a much greater age than females. One
old man of 89 saw fit to poison himself. Three
men between 80 and 84 years deathed themselves
in various ways; also one of 79 years, and four
between 70 and 74. That is to say, that beyond
the age at which women ceased from suiciding,
nine old men, who ought to have been ashamed of
themselves, were impelled to shuffle themselves
off. Most men did the deed between 40 and 44,
that age group accounting for 17 deaths. The
youngest male suicide was 20 years old. So appa-
rently thefirst male suicide starts to kill himself five
years after the first female one is buried. As has
been said, firearms provide the favorite last resort
for males. Next come cutting instruments.
Fifteen men took poison, fourteen got out by the
path of hanging, and eight sought the damp sar-
cophagus* of the sea, river, or waterhole.

“ Adelaide ” : A Bulletin par (23/l/’08)
is quite unfair to this town in coupling it with
Melbourne as a place where, in great heat, “the
unacclimatised citizen —all the citizens are un-
acclimatised—drops down in the street, and takes
no further interest in public affairs.” The Health
Officer publicly announced, in the height of the
late record heat wave, that he knew of no cases of
illness due to the weather ; and though that did
not remain true quite to the end, the half-dozen
sufferers were mostly veterans of 80. Cricket and
tennis were widely played on the 110° Saturday,
and no damages were reported. (I played myself,
and caught nothing worse than a thirst.) The
extreme dryness of the air seems to make 110°
here less dangerous than 95° in Sydney.
“ Tas.” : Was at the Victoria Barracks
(Sydney), the other day, and learnt that there
was a school of instruction for officers
(militia) in progress. A number of gentle-
men in khaki were lined up to receive
instruction in sword drill. I thought
this meant that they would be taught
how to fence, or something useful. But
here I was grievously disappointed. It
took four instructors to explain at great
length the proper pose of an officer when
saluting ! I watched their movements
for over an hour, thinking the while :
“ What an awful waste of time, labor
and money ! ” There were four positions
to be taught for the purposes of the
salute. At the word “ Position 1 ” (as
far as I could interpret it) swords would
be drawn. Then, while they were in a
certain position—so many inches above
ground—the instructors would go and
examine each gent.’s arm for about five
minutes or more, pushing it back or pull-
ing it forward like a tailor trying on a
semi-completed coat. If the Australian
Government does pass its Compulsory
Training Bill it is to be hoped that the
precious hours will not be dawdled away
in this sort of “ training.” I don’t sup-
pose one of these chaps will ever have use
for a sword except for saluting purposes,
and this won’t be of much account
against an enemy. Yet if the same time
were spent on rifle shooting instruction
(which, however, is probably undignified
for an officer) at least something useful
would be accomplished.

Adelaide Museum has received a curious
gift from D. M. Sayers, of the Northern Terri-
tory, who found in a stone cairn on the coast
a cast-iron ship’s gun, almost certainly of Dutch
origin. English experts, on the evidence of a
photograph, pronounce it “late 17th century.”
The gun is about 2ft. long and 4in. across, and is
in darned poor condition. Still the report that
it has been eaten by white ants is all wrong.

The Federal spirit ! Sydney Town Clerk
Nesbitt says that while Sydney sweeps up 87,421
tons of rubbish per annum, Melbourne, with prac-
tically the same population, only removes 61,500
tons from its thoroughfares. Whereupon Mel-
bourne Age publishes a sub-leader, in which it
points out that every Melbournite uses 69 gallons
of water to 38 used by the hot citizen of
Sydney. “ Yer dirty brute, yer don’t half clean
yer streets.” “Garn! Whatcher givin’us? I
don’t wash meself in the billy-lid, anyhow.”
Melbourne fire-captain Stein issues another
warning against the holocaust that threatens the
city. He wants fire stations at Middle Park,
Footsoray, Caulfield, Moreland, Cheltenham, and
elsewhere; 20 more men at the central station;
more fire-pumps and chemical engines; and,
above all, a water supply that will give his men a
fair chance to cope with a big fire. Those Mel-
bourneites who railed at the three days’ rain that
spoilt their Christmas holidays may thank their
stars for the downpour now. All over Victoria
the grass is green ; but for that, bush-fires must
have blazed from end to end of the State during
the 15 blistering days that followed the new year.
The amazing Druce case has taken yet
another turn. The London Daily Chronicle now
finds that George Hollamby Druce (the prose-
cutor of the Bazaar proprietor) has no status as
claimant in the civil action which is pending
against the Portland and De Walden estates. By
no manner of legal sophistry can he be proved to
be the rightful heir, since, as a matter of fact, if
anyone is, it is one Charles Edgar Druce, a
cousin of “G.H.” hitherto unknown to fame,
and at present resident in Australia. The
new development is of a piece with the
rest of the curious, doings that characterise
this claim. T. C. Druce (who is supposed to have
been identical with the Duke of Portland) had
two sons by his Crickmer marriage. One was the
father of G. H. Druce ; the other the father of
C. E. Druce. And to each of them a
son was born. Now if anyone, other than the
present owner, is entitled to the estates claimed
it should be the son of “T.C.’s” elder son. The
Chronicle (a most sober and reliable sheet) says
(1) that C. E. Dru'ce’s father was the elder son,
and (2) that G.H. bought off C.E. (who didn’t
think much of his chances as claimant, or was
too tired or something) for a trifling sum,
and waded in to claim on the basis of him-
self being the elder son’s son. In a motion
before Mr. Justice Joyce in the Chancery
Division (London Law Courts) early last month
Mr. Younger, K.C., told very much the same
story. Thus the shareholders in “G. Druce
Limited’’will have to drop their action for the
Portland Estates and all the money they
have invested. Remains now for some enter-
prising lawyer to seize “C.E.” by the
scruff of the neck and run him in as
an absurd claimant for the 15,000,000 bright,
new sovereigns the disputed property is worth.
But the best of the Druce witnesses keep getting
indicted for perjury, and others go mad immedi-
ately after giving their astounding and invaluable
evidence, so a slump has set in. The Druce claim
appears to be “ losing its punch,” a little, and the
indications are that in the flower of its youth and
strength it may at any moment go down and out.
MORE NASH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Edwin Lee Neil, who presided, said he would refer
to their dear friend as Canon Nash. (Loud cheers.)
To the speaker he was still the same worthy canon of old.
His bearing had been Christ-like and beautiful all through.
At the same time, he was aware of his grave responsi-
bilities in this matter, and would at once caution himself
and other speakers to make absolutely no reference to the
Archbishop or the methods employed recently.— Report
of valedictory to Canon Nash.
But what is he charged with, anyway ? — The Public
Voice.
Cbristlike and beautiful has been his bearing
While faithful friends passed round the hat for oash —
There hath been travail, tribulation, swearing,
But no man knows the charge ’gainst Canon Gnash.
The Bishop gravely goeth west to Suez
A sandalled pilgrim on the P. and O. —
To dear old England goeth he to do his
Most level best to make Saint Gnash to go.
And following by a less gaudy steamer
The Canon goeth on his pilgrimage—
And is compared unto the pale Redeemer
The while he fills the sacerdotal stage.
What is the crime that made the Canon go Off ?
Sedition, murder, heresy or theft?
Is it that he’s a tendency to show off ?
Is it of modesty he is bereft?
Hath he looked long upon the sack and sherries?
Or hath he travelled on the kinchen lay?
Was he in London seen at Jimmy’s? Verry’s?
What was the hushed-up crime of yesterday ?
Or did he laugh on Sunday in the vestry?
Loudly guffaw when pealed the evening hymn ?
Were common people found in his ancestry?
Were his convictions on Gehenna dim ?
Was’t simony or malversated tithes?
Is’t aught to do with souls or love or cash ?
In dark despair of doubt my brain it writhes —
In bafflement I gnash my teeth at Nash.
Embracery is not a deadly sin
For canons, if not done in stealthy dark ;
Oh ! Where shall we true information win—
Of all this coil of Canon and of Clarke?

MARTIN LUTHER.
WHEN HE GOES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne, Tuesday.—At the Holy Trinity Church at
Nathalia, on Sunday evening, the Rev. George Gladstone
painted a vivid word picture of 1 ‘ the triumphant rejoic-
ing' of the ungodly,” which he said would occur when he
was compelled to resign the incumbency of his parish.
Bazaars, meadow fetes, concerts, etc., would be held,
money would be raised, and “the ungodly would rejoice
in their triumph.” Word would fly around that there was
no “ fanatic ” in the Church of England to condemn sins
now, and the Sabbath-breaker, drunkard, dancer, publi-
can, and drink-seller would all flock back to the church.
—S. M. Herald (29/1/’08).
When I am gone
Well, friends, there’s nothing maudlin about me —
I’m just a plain, straight teacher of the Word ;
But when I think I’ll shortly have to flee.
And leave you to yourselves, my specs get blurred.
When I am gone
Nathalia will he Hell. No, do not speak
And try to comfort me. I know my theme.
Already I can hear the joyous shriek
Of Satan, and observe his glad eyes gleam.
When I am gope—
(But not till then) the dancing will begin,
Likewise bazaars and “ meadow fetes ” galore.
Friends, ain’t the prospect of such deeds of sin
Enough to make these saintly tears outpour?
When I am gone
I, who for years have been the Drinker’s Dread—
There will occur a Carnival of Beer ;
The Law will faint; Sobriety drop dead ;
Sheol will rise and wave its hat and cheer.
When I am gone
Concerts (no f e v.-e’l the word) — concerts will rage ;
Songs will be sung (not hymns), pianos bashed ;
The holy stillness wherein now I wage
My constant war with Evil will be smashed.
When I am gone
But hold ! One final horror and I’ve done.
Worse, far, far worse, than any I have billed
Is the drear certainty that blots my sun.
When I am gone this darned Church will be filled.

“ Squidge ” sends some figures :
Victorian engineer Coane’s idea for a big irrigation
reservoir becomes romantically interesting, apart from
its irrigation importance, when it is remembered that
it will be the biggest hydraulic engineering feat
in the world. The reservoir will contain 60,000,000,000
cubic feet of water, will blot out a township, cover
28,000 acres of splendid land, and submerge a payable
railway line. It will cost £1,500,000 to construct and yet
so great is the boon it will confer that it will still pay the
State handsomely to build it, so long as the work isn’t
done with loan money. The Assouan dam, with which
Lord Cromer coerced the Nile into becoming entirely
useful instead of frequently destructive, imprisons only
35,840,000,000 cubic feet. That dam is 67ft. high. The
highest point of the Trawool wall will be 140 ft. of solid
masonry, and it will be 1700 ft. long. Barren Jack, in
New South Wales, will be the third in point of size. It
will pen up 33,380,000,000 cubic feet—not much less than
Assouan, but only about half as much as Trawool. This
enables us to grasp the magnitude of Trawool —imagine
two Barren Jacks. The Barren Jack wall will be 200 ft.
high.

Incited by some strangely-minded persori,
the Wellington (M.L.) police made solemn assbs of
themselves by prosecuting Thß Buftfc MAnB
(December number) for ittdbhiericy. Thb ghrtund

“Sleeps” a eoldly-chaste nude, which won admi-
ratfoh ih Australasia for its wonderful tech-
nique and decorative quality, but was never
accused of having any of “the pride of
the flesh.” Hall, chief director of art for the
State of Victoria, is a man whom it is impossible
to even suspect of a lascivious purpose in, his Work.
“ Sleep ” was exhibited in all the thief Cities of
the Commonwealth without A bint of objection ;
and The LoNR HAftb reproduction of it was
praised iff A.lttlost every Australian paper of im-
bortqhct. But somebody in Wellington (M.L.)
tOiindit “indecent” (The Bulletin pities that
man profoundly); and the legal system of that
Dominion seems to be so loose that he was able to
move the police to a prosecution. Of course the
ridiculous charge failed. The action should have
been impossible in a civilised country.
There was a curious, painful row in S.
Australia on January 22, which, as somebody
happened to remember, was the anniversary of
Edward’s Accession. The Australian Navy was
anchored in all its magnificence in Bargs Bay, and
between the NavV fl.nd the Bargs Bay fort they
tried to do a Boyal Salute. That was the row
compained of. The Navy—consisting of the
poor little ancient Protector—is only armed with
sharp, spitting, cracking things, that want to go
off all together; while the even more ancient
guns at Bargs Fort are ponderous pieces that
take a long time to load, and even then only
roar after much deliberation. The two tried to
work-in properly, but it Was a ghastly ex-
hibition j and if there Was a representative
of the Monkey thereabouts, with somebody
to tell him that the little old spitting thing
Was Australia’s navy, his smile must have spread
until it trickled off at the end of his tail.

Sydney University has just been stressing
the importance of education. It wanted a clerk
who, in addition to the usual clerical qualifica-
tions, knew shorthand and typewriting ; and it
offered—the appointment being only temporary—
a very special inducement. The very special
inducement was 38s. 6d. per week. Now, who
would eschew the paths of knowledge and be a
bricklayers’ laborer after that? Who wouldn’t
rather take 38s. 6d. from this home of Learning
than “ wag it ” from school and subsequently get
425. or 455. from some unlettered heathen ?

The Elingamite salvage people have given
up the attempt to recover the £17,000 that still
remains in the wreck. Some £3300 was recovered,
but it cost a lot of labor and two lives. The
treasure still below can only be got at by blasting,
and that process would cost a lot, and might only
result in blowing both ship and treasure into the
deeps, and it might blow the operators there also,
so the syndicate has abandoned the job and
steamed home. The Elingamite gold seems to be
safe from the claws of man until the seas dry up,
and Judas no longer sits annually on his iceberg.
Vale Park, a lonely spot on the Dead
Horse Ranges, north of Ballarat (Vie.), has been
the scene of more picnics than usual since a
fossicker, exploring one of the old shafts,
found the unidentifiable remains of a woman,
whom the doctors said must have been
there three or four months. The locality already
bore an evil reputation. Close at hand, Lizzie
O’Reilly was strangled while asleep in her parents’
house a few years back ; and 16 years ago Nicholas
Heeney, an old recluse, was battered to death
while going to the city for his week’s provisions.
In neither case was the murderer ever discovered.
The newest victim was straightaway “identified”
by one Ronalds as his wife, from whom he
had been separated a while, but the allegedly dead
woman turned up alive and fairly well. That
piece of “identification ” having gone adrift, the
’tecs viewed the remains a trifle more closely than
before, and observed that the victim’s boots—stylish
number threes—had been repaired with rubberised
leather, which was nailed on instead of being
fastened with solution. This “clue” presently
brought Mrs. Impey, of Geelong, who absolutely
identified the victim as her sister, Mrs. Graham,
who had been laundress at St. Pat’s College,
Ballarat, up till December 30. At that date she
left on her bike to spend the holidays with a friend
in the Western District; but, the bike breaking
down, she stayed in the city for a day or two till
it was repaired. Husband Graham is understood
to be in that abiding place of grass-widowers—the
West—and to have taken no interest in his wife
for some years. Anyhow, Mrs. Mary Graham,
when engaging as laundress, resumed her maiden
name of Madge Byrne. Meanwhile her jewellery
has disappeared, her alleged “ friend ” lias gone
astray, and sundry other persons who took more
or less interest in her are assuming a retired
disposition.

Typhoid fever is now prevalent in and
around Sydney. Ever since the N.S.W. metro-
polis began to drink Cataract dam water (which
the Carruthers Government insisted on contami-
nating with a huge supply of decayed vegetable
matter) there have been serious epidemics, first of
whooping-cough, then of gastric influenza, now of
typhoid and diphtheria. Careful filtration of the
Sydney water seems to be “indicated,” as the
doctors say.
“ Benbee ” (from N.Q.) on the heat
question :
About every second man one meets when in Sydney on
a holiday begins to perspire when he hears that you come
from Queensland. The name is enough to make him call
for liquid refreshment with ice in it. When you tell him
that you come from Townsville way he wants the bar-
tender to put two pieces of ice in the l.r. aforesaid, and
be quick about it. There are just as hot places in N.S. W.
(Bourke and Wilcannia, for a start) ; but they are not in
Queensland, so they don’t count in the Heat Stakes in a
Sydney man’s opinion. Now I want to tell the Southern
public generally that the Queensland climate is another
thing altogether from the N.S.W. article. To begin with,
our prevailing wind all through the hot weather is
the south-east trade—a gloriously temperate breeze
which comes along regularly, day in and day
out, for months. Usually it begins operations
about 9 a.m., and keeps along steadily until
midnight. The sun is hot, but the air is cool, therefore
you never feel so washed-out in it as you do in Sydney
or Melbourne. Sydney is served by the N.E. wind, which
is a very enervating breeze, specially run, one would
think, in the interests of the liquor trade. The sun in
Sydney is not so hot as in Queensland ; but the air is
milch hotter. They are two different -entirely different
—climates. On the N.E. coast of Mackay,
for example—the shade temperature hardly ever goes
over 95, whereas in and around Sydney it runs over 100
with little or no provocation. Comparing highlands,
Toowoomba (Q.) has been running all along lately with a
maximum shade temperature of 85, whereas the Blue
Mountain health resorts (N,B. W.) have been racing along
dp to 100. The difference is practically all in the prevailing
winds. Queensland, with a S.E, wind to cool the air,
is a cooler climate than its geographical position would
seem to indicate, whereas N.S.W,, with a heavy north-
easter bearing down on it. Is hotter than It ought to be,
As for the hot westerly, we in N,Q. don’t get it at all,
* * * *
The Oriental makes a very good stage
property because he wears strange, flappy clothes ;
but when you have called him picturesque you
have about exhausted the list of his accomplish-
ments and virtues. A certain amount of civilisa-
tion has been forced upon our colored brother. It
Usually begins with liquor and ends with a top-hat
and a loan, and it leaves him just as undesirable
as when he rode about on an elephant with a quilt
Wrapped round him. Europe is weary to death of
hard-up colored tnonarchs who Want to raise money
on the crown jewels, and while an energetic
brigand with a little cash is made welcome in the
manager’s office, an impecunious king can wait
vainly on the doorstep until the hungry camels
begin to devour his back hair. The cables have it
that, while Sultan Abd-el-Aziz, of Morocco, was
hanging round the State Bank at Tangier the
other day trying to get some small change,
Raisuli, the bushranger, was inside depositing
£15,000 of Kaid Maclean’s ransom money at 4 per
cent. Consider the indignity, for Abd-el-Aziz,
the “ Prince of True Believers,” is the 15th of the
dynasty of the Alides, and allegedly the 30th lineal
descendant of Ali, the nunky of the Prophet.
Likewise he is a true Shereef, and the Shereefian
gamp or brolly is hereditary in his family. Yet
when it is a question of raising a few dollars to
pacify his troops with, all these honors are dust
and ashes.

Fine rains have soaked most of Australia, and
the revenue returns, which here and there have begun to
look very limp, will no doubt stiffen up again. Still,
these rains won’t make last year’s N. S. Wales and Vic-
torian wheat crop any better, nor will they put the metal
markets up for the benefit of S. Australia, Tasmania, and
Take the revenue figures first, however :

S. Australia (6 mos.) 1,313,864 1,670,265 Inc. 356,401
Monthly returns are not made up by S. Australia,
whose railway revenue for January must have slumped
badly, on account of the shrinkage in the Broken Hill out-
put. Victoria’s January figures also show up poorly, mainly
on account of the railway revenue having fallen from
£425,603 to £365,267, the result of a poorer harvest.
N. S. Wales railways show a small shrinkage of £2319.
There is, however, still a large increase in the amount
received by N. S. Wales from the Commonwealth, and
that saves the look of the State’s totals. Of the £706,776
improvement shown on the seven months’ operations,
£571,949 is due to that Commonwealth which is only
supposed to be harassing and humiliating a distressed Ma.
Tasmania suffers badly from the cloud that has come over
the metal market; income and dividend tax and railway
receipts suffer, and that fact won’t be cheerful reading
to those people who were captivated by the great improve-
ment shown a while ago by the Emu Bay Railway, and
took over shares in that distressful concern, which de-
pends almost wholly on mineral traffic. Queensland rail-
way revenues also went back £12,579. Westralia isn’t
affected in this way. You see the good points of a gold
mine better when the other metal markets are performing
their great tumbling feats.
As usual, the State expenditure returns are
very scarce, and not too trustworthy, even when they
are available. N. S. Wales professes to have spent
£6,965,337 ( in the seven months, or £10,875 more
than in the same months of the previous
year (the revenue was £706,776 more) ; but, then,
during this year no less than £833,409 has been
paid to the Public Works and Closer Settlement Funds ;
and this is mere juggling with figures, seeing that the
Works Fund is used largely to pay for things that ought
to be charged direct to revenue. That the Works Fund
doesn’t prevent borrowing is shown by the fact that so
far this financial year £1,168,846 of borrowed money has
been used up, which is £379,983 more than for the corre-
sponding part of the previous year. Queensland’s expen-
diture is already moving along fast, and within a couple
of days it will be seen whether the brake is to come off.
If it does come off Queensland will probably within 12
months win back from S. Australia the bad distinction
of having the Biggest Debt per Head on Earth. Westralia
shows that its January expenditure was kept £31,289 below
revenue, thus reducing the accumulated deficit to
£139,643. But loan figures are not furnished ; and in a
country where repairs to a glasshouse for breeding fruit
bugs are charged to loan account, ordinary expenditure
figures are apt to fall under suspicion.

Compared with those of 12 months ago the figures are
almost unchanged. Then the advances totalled £301,678 ;
they are now £301,633. There is little “ spring ” about
Ballarat, and this little bank has no branches elsewhere ;
mining is on a sick-bed, and far too much of the rich out-
lying district is locked up. At the end of 1897 the
advances were £272,260, so, in spite of the good name
which the bank has kept, it has only increased its
business by £29,373 in 10 years. Still apparently the
character of the business has on the whole improved a
bit; for while the gross income, after providing for bad
debts, was at the rate of £5 Is. per cent, on total advances
in 1897, it is now only a shade under 6 per cent. The
income includes in both cases an unknown amount re-
ceived as revenue from liquid assets. Of course, a good
part of the increased profit has been due to the accumu-
lation of reserves —the bank has the use of that money
without paying interest for it. If profits were calculated
on the basis on reserves combined with capital, recent
results would show up as follows
June, 1904 .. £5 6 2 p.c. June, 1906 .. £5 5 2 p.c.
Dec., 1904 .. 5 5 4 „ Dec., 1906 .. 5 6 1 „
June, 1905 .. 5 6 1,, June, 1907 .. 5 6 1 ~
Dec., 1905 .. 5 5 8 „ Dec., 1907 .. 5 2 2 „
There is no visible improvement there. The cash position
is strong—43 per cent, of the liabilities to the public is
represented by liquid assets. Under ordinary circum-
stances that proportion would be a good deal more than
is necessary ; but a bank without branches may need to
have a rather larger proportion than usual. For one
reason, if it is running short of liquid assets it can’t so
conveniently strengthen its position by quietly calling in
a little here and a little there. The multiplication of
branches is often a curse, but the other plan has its dis-
advantages, too.

In 1892 the co. left off paying 12J p.c. divs. (with an
occasional bonus) to smash disastrously, and various
reconstructions followed. In the end the interest of the
Cld shareholders was reduced to £1234, the figure at
which it stands to-day. There are four lots of shares—
those old ordinaries (£1234) • ordinaries paid in money,
and not issued to shareholders in the old bank (£2172);
pref. (£167,596); and deferred pref. (£29,000). In the
1905 reconstruction the ordinary shares were written
down from £5 to Is. ; the £5 pref. shares were cut into
two —one pref. (paid to 505.) and one deferred pref. (55.).
For the benefit of ordinary and deferred pref. shares it
was agreed that amounts realised in excess of written-
down values should go into a special fund, and this
special fund has moved like this :

June, 1907 .. 17,427 2496 15,985
Dec., 1907.. 14,126 705 16,690
The £705 in the last line doesn’t mean that that profit
was made on £14,126 worth of securities ; most of the
sales are made on terms, and the profit is not brought to
account till the business is completed. A comparison of
some of the principal figures as at December 31,1905, and
December 31, 1907, shows up as follows :
Dec., ’O5. Dec., ’O7.

Total Expenses.. .. 11,444 10,890 Dec. 554
The one unsatisfactory feature is the shrinkage of de-
posits ; yet, after such a shocking experience, the bank
can’t reasonably expect the public to restore its con-
fidence in a flood. Otherwise, the movement is good ;
especially good is the rapid clearing out of vacant lands,
which presumably give a very poor return. Of course,
there is no way of telling definitely whether the unsold
properties are as good a lot as those that have been sold ;
but the revenue from them certainly shows a better
average. As at Dec. 31, 1905, properties in possession
showed only £5 6s. per cent, gross; what are left show £6
16s. per cent, gross. Looking at that and the profit so
far realised on sales, it seems as if the writing down had
been emphatic enough. The weak point is the poverty
both of the reserves and of the additions made to them ;
the margin over and above the 5 per cent, dividend is
still small, even though it is growing. As to the deposits,
they amount to only about 57 per cent, of the assets ;
that is to say, the assets (liquid and all) would have to
depreciate 43 per cent, below their written-down value
before the public’s interest would be touched ; so there
seems to be no reason why depositors should stay awake
at nights thinking about it.

During the great boom this co., which had been making
fine profits in Queen-street quarters that wore no frill,
decided to do the thing properly. It therefore bought
some of the fizziest part of Collins-street, and was only
just finishing the new premises when the boom went out
of business. The co. faced a cold world then with just
upon £70,000 sunk in bricks and mortar, which nobody
would help it to use; worse still, it had lent heavily on
mortgage ; and it had other troubles. Fortunately the
business stuck to it, and the capital didn’t have to be
reduced. But the £70,000 sunk in Collins-street has been
a heavy drain. It has been written down now to
£65,000. At 4 p.c. that would show £l3OO a half
year clear. As a matter of fact, the rents
only showed £9l net; so the co.’s business has to carry
say £2400 a year for rent. Also, on top of that, the old
Queen-street leasehold has meant a steady drain of over
£5OO a year. For the past half-year £785 was paid ; but
that ends this particular nightmare. Between these two
things it can be understood why a well-managed 00. with
such a business has, until recently, had to be content
with 5 per cent. divs. The extent of the business and
some other things are shown hereunder

The commissions mean 4s. lOd. per cent, per annum of
trust estates—that is the average charge on the capital
value of estates as at December 31 ; and, as shown above,
the average expenses were 2s. lid. per cent., leaving
Is. lid. as profit and to pay the loss on the Queen-street
leasehold, which is not included among the expenses.
Trust estate balances in hand have shrunk a little during
the year ; but that is not necessarily a bad sign. Reali-
sation of properties has no doubt been more rapid than
usual, and that might account for it. Besides the bricks,
etc., before mentioned, the co. has £44,951 of cash, public
stock, and other liquid assets, while the advances (in-
cluding mortgages) are these times down to £13,038. The
co. has no debts except small trade accounts.

This, like other trustee cos., charges a commission on the
annual income of trust estates, and also a single com-
mission on the capital value of estates put into its hands.
In order to spread out the latter corpus commission over
the period covered by the winding up of the estate, this
co. passes the bulk of it through a Commission Reserved
Account. In the foregoing table the additions to this
reserve are treated as profit; the following puts the
transactions in another way

Three years or so ago the co. remodelled and extended
its offices ; and the amounts lately written off are coming
off that item. The premises, which had a book value of
£lO,OOO before the alterations—the latter cost £15,000 or
so—have now been brought back to £16,500. The other
assets consist of Treasury deposit, £20,000 ; mortgages,
£34,141; and cash and public securities. There are no
deposits, overdrafts, or similar liabilities. The amount at
credit of trust estates is £6,493,683 ; 12 months ago it was
£6,051,681 ;10 years ago it was £3,205,531. The figures
prove the growing popularity of the idea of handing over
trustee business to people who know the business, and
have put up guarantees of fidelity. As to cost, it pans
out about thus (it can’t be stated absolutely, because the
revenue from investments is only an estimate): —
Expenses .. £12,530=35. lOd. p.c. of Trust Estates.
Profit .. 4,700 = ls. sd. ~ ~
Total cost.. £17,230=55. 3d. ~
That is to say, while the estates are in hand, the cost to
them appears to be only a trifle over J per cent, of the
capital value. And yet in proportion to the very small
amount of capital necessary to conduct the business the
profit is very large ; for the past year, on the basis of
capital and reserves combined, it was no less than £ll
17s. lOd. per cent. —taking the profit as shown in the
first table above.

Of the year’s profit £6718 was made in the first and
£6374 in the second half. The gross revenue for the past
six months was £12,161; for the corresponding half of
1906 it was £12,975, and for that of five years ago it was
£12,519. Further, the profits stated above are gross,
without deduction for wear and tear ; the plant, installa-
tions, etc., are taken in at cost, and the reserves include
the only manifest provision for depreciation. It is true
that extensions may possibly have been made from time
to time and paid for out of revenue ; but there is no hint
of it anywhere. Moreover, even if works, etc., have been
extended in that way, the revenue has not grown with
the extensions ; so the latter may be regarded as very
doubtful. The co., though not restricted to 10 per
cent., must share profits beyond that point with
the City Council, and it would naturally prefer
to keep its charges dowm, so as to make a
certainty of its 10 per cent., rather than maintain high
rates and risk losing custom at the hands of its electrical
rivals, when at the best it would only get half of any
extra profits. That possibly may explain why the gross
revenue doesn’t move along, in spite of the fact that in
five years nearly £lO,OOO has been put into plant and
charged to capital. The works, including freehold and
leasehold, cost £120,604. Depreciation, at the rate of
even 2 per cent., would absorb £2412 a year ; and if that
is a fair rate, and if no works have been paid for out
of revenue, then on the published figures the dividend
is being barely earned, since the additions to reserves for
the past three years have averaged only £2263 a year.

The position isn’t made as clear as it ought to be. In
1906 the co.’s premises were burned, and in the next
balance-sheet two items appeared: “Insurance Re-
covered, £1000” on one side, and “Fire Expenses
and Reinstatement, £465 ” on the other. The dif-
ference, £535, could only be taken as profit,
to be added to the reserves. Now, however, both items
disappear—even the £535 disappears. Therefore, though
the profit and loss account for the past year shows a profit
of £12,813, the £535 has to be written off; and this is
done accordingly. What trustee business this co. does
isn’t set out; but it ought not be allowed to do any at all.
For it owes £318,421 to depositors, besides £2838 to “ in-
vestors ” and others ; and the whole of this money, besides
almost all its own capital and reserves, is in “ mortgages
and other securities.” The capital and reserves which
ought to be guaranteeing the proper performance of the
trusts is therefore safeguarding these deposits—pro-
tecting them against a slump in the value of the mort-
gages. Years ago when a Victorian deposit-taking and
mortgage concern proposed to open a trustee depart-
ment, the law speedily stepped in and shut down on such
an obviously dangerous mesalliance. Maoriland is
evidently not so particular. Probably this concern could
afford very well to drop the trustee business. The great
bulk of its business must be in the loan department—
details are not available, all income being lumped. The
paid capital is £101,250 ; so the deposits, etc., represent £2
4s. for every £1 of shareholders’ funds. Put in another way,
6s. 6d. in every £ sunk in mortgages and other securities
belongs to shareholders, so creditors are pretty well
protected. But the bank balance (£l5) is appallingly
small for a concern that has £318,000 of deposits.

Times had been too good lately for the old “Monty
Peet”—the community had reached a point of prosperity
and affluence when it called no man uncle. But the cold
blast of adversity blew up again in the last few months,
and whistled through and about the Stock Exchange ;
and the young man who had been told that Junction
Norths were “ a safe thing for a fiver,” and therefore
bought a few on time at 405., and afterwards found that
they had mysteriously and unaccountably shrivelled to
14s.—well, that young man has been obliged to do some-
thing. So, whereas on June 30 the “Monty Peet’s” ad-
vances totalled £8(3,428, at Dec. 31 they were up to
£84,839. In the bleak days of 1902-3, when the drought
raged, they went as high as £88,400; so things
are not at their worst—or, from this co.’s
point of view, their best. Still, striking an average,
business hasn’t increased. Ten years ago, for instance,
the advances were £84,684, or almost exactly the same
as they are now. But the co. is in a better position now
than it was then, because it formerly had to do some of
its financing on deposits, running up to £ll,OOO, whereas
the reserves have done away with the necessity of
deposits and overdrafts. The co. owes nothing at all
now, and has, therefore, only its own money at stake.
Part of the reserves (£3102) is a contingency fund to pro-
vide for depreciation of securities ; and with such a mixed
lot of securities, totalling £B4,B39—many of them securi-
ties whose value is governed by fashion—something sub-
stantial certainly seems called for by way of a fund to
guarantee that the whole of the miscellaneous lot will
remain worth 20s. in the £.

The substantial reserves consist of—Reserve fund,
£21,960 ; fund for renewal of plant, mains, etc., £31,625 ;
meter fund, £l2lB ; insurance fund, £525 ; and an un-
divided balance. Consisting so largely of a fund for
renewals, the reserves are probably not of the best sort;
to some extent they are no doubt a set-off against actual
depreciation. To some small extent also the profit shown
above may not be true, because the amounts added net
to reserve (and necessarily included as profit) may be
wholly or partly an allowance for current depreciation.
Some of the reserves are invested in the undertaking ;
there are, however, liquid assets (including book debts)
amounting to £24,056 in excess of liabilities. During the
past five years large extensions of plant, mains, etc., have
been made ; at the end of 1902 the fixed investments
totalled £59,448, as against the present £78,713. Of
the increase £14,617 was supplied by bringing up the
paid capital to £45,000, the full amount of the present
authorised capital. Gas cos.’ accounts are, however,
tricky. Some concerns stuff away undisclosed profits in
new plant, alleging that it is written off to cover depre-
ciation ; others pay away all their revenue, and make no
provision for the repairs and renewals that will presently
arrive like a herd of stampeded cattle. In one case the
true profits are more than they are alleged to be ; in the
other case, less. The Newcastle Co. adopts a middle
course ; and though it doesn’t show what it actually
spends in repairs and renewals, it shows the net provision
for future repairs and renewals ; and the depreciation
fund, which a few concerns have in the shape of works
paid for out of revenue, this co. maintains in the shape of
a Repairs and Renewal Fund. This allows one to form a
pretty fair opinion as to w here the co. really is.

The accounts last year were presented in a very sloppy

then an appropriation made to cover wear and tear was
written off. Last year £l2OO fell back into the balance-

apparently, it was some of this previously-written off
depreciation. If so, then assets, after being written
down, were written up again ; and that sort of reserve
can be viewed generally with suspicion. Nowadays the
profits are presumably shown net, after deduction of
unspecified amounts to cover wear and tear. The real
position of the co. is therefore unknown. The profits
may be under-stated or over-stated. The only hint that
the man who isn’t behind the counter can get is by fol-
lowing the gross income from sales of gas, residuals, etc.:
—1904, £4949 ; 1905, £5246 ; 1906, £5919 ; 1907, £7OOl.
Even allowing for dearer coal, it is absurd to suppose
that profits fell from £2093 in 1905 to £1969 in 1907. Of
course meantime there has been an increase of capital
from £15,000 to £20,000 ; but that doesn’t affect the profit
earned in proportion to turnover. The object of the dis-
guise is apparently to maintain the price of gas so as to
extend mains, etc., as far as possible out of revenue ;
and, though that policy can be pushed too far, still
fashions in watering places are nearly as capricious as
they are in millinery, wherefore the people who put
their money into such places, and don’t make hay while
the sun shines, are liable to be left with an unsaleable
haystack after heavy rain.

This is a case in which a good deal has to be taken for
granted. The published profit and loss account is a mere
formality ; it simply shows what the profit was after pay-
ment of various things, and after “providing for wear
and tear and depreciation.” What the provision for
depreciation was isn’t mentioned even in a whisper. Six
months ago “ mining property, including mineral lands,
buildings, rolling stock, etc.,” was down for £98,850. The
item now stands at £97,890. Unless, therefore, some
sales have been made during the year the depreciation
provided for out of profits was £960 plus the cost of new
property, plant, etc., acquired during the half-year. Six
years ago the item stood at £83,604 ; so in that time
£14,286 of new property has been charged to capital
account. No doubt a great deal more than that may have
been bought. If not, there is trouble ahead ; for the only
thing there is to cover the depreciation is the new pro-
perty purchased in excess of £14,286, and paid for out of
revenue. And, as a few Newcastle coal cos. are finding
out, coal mines depreciate fast. The Wickham and
Bullock Island is now only a memory and a few worn-
out coal-trucks on a sand-heap ; the Stockton has just
cut its last coal ; and a few more are nearing the end.
The Wallsend has had a magnificent past; but you can’t
tell a mine’s future that way. All you can know for
certain is that the more that, has been taken out, the
bigger the hole there is, and a hole in the earth isn’t an
asset. The Wallsend is Teputed to be “ all right ” ; but
the person looking for nest-eggs needs more information
than the published accounts furnish.

M’yes, it looks like that—a profit of £1454. But along
with general expenses, “ renewals, depreciation, and im-
provements” are lumped in the profit and loss account;
and when improvements are charged against revenue,
you begin to wonder whether the true profit isn’t more
than it is said to be. Then as to depreciation : in the six

£2lOO. There may, however, have been sales ; yet, on
the co.’s past record, it is pretty certain that a large
lump of revenue has been used to write down the item.
Three years ago the liquid assets, less liabilities (includ-
ing the McLaughlin litigation suspense account), were
£10,299. They are now £16,826. In three years, there-
fore, the mine has paid the dividends, provided various
plant improvements, and added £6527 to the liquid
assets. Against that has to be set mine and leasehold
depreciation, and some possible, though doubtful, sales
of freehold. On the whole, the position is therefore
probably better than it looks on the surface of the pub-
lished accounts.

The N.S.W. Government Savings Bank lately
established an Advances to Settlers Department under
Aiex. Mclntosh, for some years past general manager of
the Bank of New Zealand, with the object of giving help
to farmers, etc., at rock-bottom rates. To achieve the
rock-bottom rates it is, however, necessary to eliminate
the middleman. Vet Manager Mclntosh and his colleagues
already find that the middleman is pushing his way in ;
in one case the other day a borrower of £4UO undertook
to give the agent £25 for getting thh loan from the bank.
This has led to t:ie issue of a sort of manifesto, in which
the department points out the utter uselessness of agents
in the matter —agents, it is insisted, can’t even expedite
the business.

Ever since the metal slump began, it has
become more evident every week that Broken Hill mines
have been sailing very wide; and, though they have
improved things, they can get a lot closer to the wind
even now. When the trouble began, the tariff, the rate
of wages, the smelting charges, the price of coal —every-
thing was supposed to be against the industry. As a
matter of fact, the situation was not nearly as bad as it
appeared to be. The disposal of their concentrates was
the one really serious difficulty which threatened the
mines. The B. H. Proprietary has now come forward
with a reasonable proposal, and if the cos. can’t go on
producing on the terms offered, silver-lead mining in
Broken Hill is not what it ought to be. As for wages,
men who a few months back were averaging 17s. a shift,
find it no easier to make 12s. now, owing to the cutting
of the contract prices, and so costs in various ways are
coming down with a run.

The lode at the 1400 ft. level of the Broken Hill
Prop, continues of fairly good quality, but hard as the
nether millstone, and it carries rhodonite. Some time
ago it was cheerfully explained by the chairman of the
B. H. Prop. Board that the density of the ore at the deep
levels was due to the immense pressure to which the lode
had been exposed at that point. But that theory was
exploded by Block 10, where the ore body at 1315 ft. was
not so dense as it had been in the levels above. There is
a wide difference in the constitution of ore bodies, even
in the same mine, and the fact that the Proprietary has
a hard, dense lode at 1400 ft. is the Proprietary’s bad luck.
Just now the big mine badly wants a few hundred thou-
sand tons of good milling ore.
The British, Broken Hill, is still carrying good
ore in the north drive on Howell’s 800 ft. level. As the
drive is being pushed straight ahead, nothing has yet
been ascertained as to the trend of the body ; but
it is more than probable that it will prove to
be the continuation of the main lode from
the 600 ft. level. A lot of money was spent on
diamond-drilling for that continuation ; but as a
British ore body is nothing if not erratic, the surveyor’s
calculations were all at sea. What is certain is that the
600 ft. lode was richer underfoot in the stope than any-
where else in the mine ; and, bearing in mind the fact
that the body cut at the 800 ft. level was richer still, it is
probable that the lode swam away northward at an angle
of about one in three. That kind of thing is not unusual
in the British.

Broken Hill got enough rain in the monsoonal
deluge of last week to last it until June. Promptly
Broken Hill Water Supply shares jumped some more.
But the theory on which these recent jumps have been
based is all wrong; for the rains have filled the mine
dams, and the cos. don’t buy water when they can pump
from their own supplies, so this current half-year’s
revenue will slump. On the other hand, the rain may
possibly once more drown the mines’ scheme for a sup-
plementary supply, though the new Trust seems to have
gone too far to allow itself to be bluffed into such folly as
that.

Queen Bee (N.S.W.) is opening up what may
turn out to be a new ore body west of No. 4 level. The
report says 270 J tons of 9 per cent, ore were smelted to
65J tons of matte (40'8 per cent, copper). This shows
more copper than was contained in the ore. Probably
some low-grade matte was used in charging the furnaces.
Production is over 50 tons a month, and the last sale was
at £6l Bs. 6d. f.o.b. Sydney.

South New Moon having a development, Ben-
digonians trooped to the Beehive. The outside public
waited, having been there before. All the fuss arose
because gold was at last got in a spur in the eastern 1780 ft.
crosscut. But, though there was gold in this spur, there
was very little spur. Nevertheless, given gold in the
eastern country, a new mine is ahead ; and that was why
Bendigo bought. Melbourne, on the other hand, sold
because it hadn’t faith.
* * * *
At present New Moon is doing some of the best
work i n Bendigo on 6d wt. 3gr. gold. The co. is about to open
out at 1925 ft. and 2025 ft. ; so, apart from the work being
done in the shallow ground at the south shaft, there is a
gamble ahead over the bottom levels.
* * * *
Berry United, neighbor to Spring Hill Leads,
Creswick (Vic.), is to have £40,000 more emptied into its
shaft. Old deep-leaders like the Berry United better
than any other alluvial show in Victoria. But they don’t
admire costly plant and costly ways, so they let the
shares severely alone. Their idea is that J. Bull will want
twice £40,000 to get into wash, and that before he gets
there he will be as sick of deep-lead mining as he is of
reefing in Victoria. They will then buy, and pick up the
dividends. That, anyhow, is what they are hoping for.
The policy of the Lord Nelson, St. Arnaud
(Vic.), in providing new battery, etc., has been hotly
debated ; but engineer Grayson’s plans and work were
vindicated at the half-yearly meeting. The mine needed
modern handling. It has dropped from I2dwt.
to 6dwt. ; and, as the gold is low-grade, it
called for a new plant, well worked, to make
profits from 1800 ft. And as profits are being made,
Foster, Woods, and other directors can smile, for the
overdraft is within sight of extinction. The shrinkage in
gold contents does not augur well for the North, alongside,
unless when it gets the shoot on the underlie it can com-
mand terms for an amalgamation. If the shoot of ore
pitches north as fast as heretofore, it might pay Lord
Nelson to diamond drill from the bottom level. If there
is much further depreciation in gold contents, neither it
nor the North need bother about pitch or anything else.

It isn’t the lot of many to start with callß in a
mining show, and then to hold on till £1,500,000 in gold
has been won ; but Peter Finlayson has that record with
the Long Tunnel Extended (Vic.). He must have drawn
£75 a share in divs. since he got in. Now he trots out
with his delicious optimism, and tells shareholders that
thev are not leaping into the dark in re-opening the
Consols shaft of the old North Long Tunnel. Peter
Finlayson’s luck is no doubt a very good asset to the
Extended ; and, if it revivifies the Consols, shareholders
might immortalise him. “ Dicky ” Noble s mantle now
fits easily on manager Rawson’s ample shoulders. Noble
always saw five years’ work ahead. Rawson believes the
reef will be as strong as ever at 3000 ft. Does he mean in
the Extended ground ? m
Bright district (Vic.), in the last five weeks,
won 4100 oz. gold—4oooz. from reefing, the rest from
dredging. Not long since Bright was a big reeling
centre ; now its mines are idle except the Pioneer, where
Tewksbury is getting good gold for Sydney folk at a
depth. Some old claims had big records—Oriental,
£1,250,000 ; Happy Valley, £700,000 ; Reform, ,
Mons Meg, £350,000; and half-a-dozen others, £2uu,uuu.
Burnt Creek, Bet Bet (Vic.), as a n alluvial
show, has never hit divs. The capital called up is ,

Tolhurst, Cumming, and Keats are kept pretty
busy floating things for the Chillagoe people. They have
just underwritten the first £lOO,OOO worth of « per cent,
debentures to be issued to pay for the Etheridge railway
extension ; and the public is now being asked to oome in.
underwriting in this case was a mere matter of form—
and per cent, commission. The line will cost £400,000
or more, and the price to be paid 14 years hence cannot
ue less than half the cost; moreover, the Government
2£ per cent, on the cost. Therefore, as only
£200,000 worth of debentures may be issued, the payment
of principal and interest by the State is practically
guaranteed. The only point the public has to worry
about is whether theco. has the other £200,000 to put into
the line ; and on this point the prospectus merely says
that ‘ the resources of the co. available for the railway,
including the loan of £200,000, considerably exceed the
estimated cost.” As this is a point of great importance,
it is a bit surprising that the directors didn’t drive it
home with an accountant’s certificate. They do print
lengthy reports on the prospects of the line, and the
great natural resources of the country to be served,”
but in view of the Government guarantee those things
are of very small consequence. The tenders are not to be
below par.

Engineer Frew is moving the Etheridge (Q.)
line along quietly. Rails are now out rather more than
35 miles from Almaden, the terminus of the Chillagoe
line, and the track is good for public traffic. It is esti-
mated he will do three miles of plate-laying a week.
Ninety miles of permanent survey are completed ; and
now an interesting halt has been made in that work
while Georgetown people make a noise concerning the
way 7 the rest of it should go. The line must be taken by
the route which will ensure for it the most payable traffic,
and which will bring speedily up to the point of produc-
tion the mines that require the line. Where the traffic
is, there the line should be. If the Georgetown people
think they should have the line, it’s up to them to prove
that the mining traffic is not worth as much as the
Georgetown traffic. And if they can prove that, then the
line should never have been started, for Georgetown
wouldn’t justify half a line.

Ravenswood (Q.) is alive, and that’s all. Of all
the cos. that are or have been, New Ravenswood, Ltd., is
the only one that can smile occasionally. During' the
next year, some decent development will have to be done
or the field, as a respectable gold-producer, will be
numbered amongst the dead. Production for 1907 ex-
ceeded 1906 by close on 20000 z., but old tailings heaps
cannot last for ever. Lawrence Wilson is installing an
Elmore vacuum concentrator, of which great things are
expected. The Elmore plant on the Pinnacles lead ore
(N.S.W.) has not made much of a name for itself, but
that may not have been the plant’s fault. Pinnacles and
New Ravenswood are regarded in London as a sort of
brothers, although one is mining for gold in Queensland,
while the other pursues lead in N. S. Wales. Maybe
New Ravenswood will make a success of its Elmore, in
which case it would be a fair thing to let Wilson
have a shot at the Pinnacles.' Understood that
Phillpotts will shortly retire from his position with
Ravenswood Deeps and New Ravenswood Ltd. This is
rather a pity, as Phillpotts is a well-trained and experi-
enced technical man, and they are not numerous up
there ; but doubtless Ravenswood realises that it is now
getting poor, and there is not too much room for a well-
paid man of this stamp. Ravenswood Deep Mines, the
English concern which built a fine mill, and then sunk a
deep shaft to find ore for it, now realises pretty definitely
that it began at the wrong end.

The Mt. Flora (Q.) float was not successful, and
the Mackay people who are interested in the field and
want a furnace are formulating some scheme for acquir-
ing the old Mt. Orange smelter. Christie, who away
back in the dark ages had something to say in the Peak
Downs metallurgical operations, is leading a little band
of enthusiasts, and an arrangement has been made to
lease the smelter. In all probability the scheme will not
succeed, but it deserves to, all the same. A well-run up-
to-date reverberatory at Flora w 7 ould pay both mine-
owners and smelter owners ; but with so little develop-
ment work done, the job would be too small under pre-
sent conditions to make it worth while for strong people
to take the project up. The owners of Flora will have to
spend more money, or, to be accurate, some money, in
development.

Carrington United (Q.) is plugging away with
its reverberatory furnaces ; but its efforts to produce
blister copper are only partially successful. In smelting,
the Charters Towers people who run this show are a bit
out of their depth, and it would have paid them to have
allowed some experienced copper people to come in and
pioneer the job for them. As a rule Towers men despise
the technical man ; but ere they have sunk much more
money in copper, they will learn his value. Properly
handled, Carrington United as a mine should be made to
pay handsomely ; but how much “dead capital ”it will
stand is another matter.

Geologist Rands has completed his inspection
of Peak Downs (Q.). The report should be available to
shareholders any day now. If Rands does not tell the
Peak Downs directors in effect that they must spend
some money in development before he can say whether
the mine is likely to be any good, this paper will be much
mistaken. The crowd that has been running the show
has utterly disregarded the facts revealed in the closing
days of the mine’s productiveness in the ’seventies,
when the manager reported that the ground
opened up showed signs of exhaustion. In 1876,
Samuel Higgs, the superintendent of the Wallaroo
Mining Co. (S. Australia), reported on the property, and
stated that a “ large outlay was essential before the mine
would ever become payable.” It was then known that
the ore below the 60-fathom level became very poor, and
not at all plentiful, and the new exploratory shaft that
was sunk at the time was discontinued because the ore
met with was so poor. Yet in the face of all this the
present co. blundered into the erection of a blast fur-
nace without doing one foot of real development. Also,
some poor misguided mortals bought the shares at £3.

Mt. Molloy (Q.) directors find that it is one
thing to estimate the cost of a railway, and quite another
thing to build it at the estimated cost. The Molloy line
was to cost £l5OO per mile, and provision was made on
that scale ; but it is understood up north that all the co.’s
cash is gone, though the line is only three-quarters built.
It is therefore likely the co. will issue debentures.
To make matters worse, the lode isn’t looking its best just
now about 4 per cent, pyritic ore being the value of the
main body. The chances are that Molloy will become a
customs smelter for the district, and that will give Ghill-
agoe a knock. . * «*
The Village Blacksmith, Reid’s Creek (Q.),
crushed recently at Gurrumba 52 tons of stone for a re-
turn of 2 tons and a few odd lb. of tin. This is roughly 4
per cent., and makes the ore worth £2 Us. 4d. per ton.
As crushing costs £1 per ton and carting from 12s. to 155.,
there isn’t much left for mining costs and dividends. Yet
this thing was floated in 100,000 shares !
■» * * *
Gurrumba tin mill was closed after Christmas
for three weeks, and the Irvinebank mill shut up for a
month, which shows better than anything else how the
tin-slump has affected North Queensland. The Gilmore Co.
is connecting the straight shaft at the Midas mine with
the lode at about 160 ft. It has a nice ore shoot, running
about 4ft. wide, blocked out. But there is a good deal of
pvrites in this block, and that will bring down the grade
of the concentrates. There is very little ore left in the
upper levels of this mine ; and as the bulk of the co. s
crushings has come from there, you cant safely judge
future results by past ones. Prospects at the
Dolly Grey, owned by the same co., are fair.
Here they are sinking an underlay winze on
a patchy make, not as rich as the Midas stone
but still fairly good. One favorable feature about
the Gilmore Co. is that it has several places well worth
prospecting. One, near the Dolly Grey, is very promising
at the surface. Still with the present price of tini there
is little inducement to spend much on any prospect, and
with what is showing ahead it seems hardly possible tor
Gilmore to pay anything like regular divs. on its big lun p
of shares. The ore shoots are fairly small, and as men-
tioned just now, there isn’t much inducement at present
for a co. to go vigorously to work looking for new ones,
and thus keep development well ahead. Between that
and the difficulty of getting stone to the mill during the
wet season, the Gilmore output is likely to be erratic.
Mt. Morgan copper furnaces, for a six months’
run to the end of November, treated 75,741 tons of copper-
bearing material, including 69,234 tons that came directly
out of the mine. To do the smelting it took 54,000 tons
of limestone and ironstone fluxes, and about 12,000 tons
of coke and coal. The output of copper was 2310 tons, so
between 60 and 70 tons of material go into the furnace to
produce one of copper. That, of course, makes smelting
expensive. The ironstone is brought from an
island oft the coast ; the limestone is raised from the
co. s quarries ; the coal comes from the Bluff colliery, 100
nines or so up the Central railway. Mt. Morgan's objective
is to replace barren fluxes with pyritic ore from Many
Peaks, near Gladstone, and to increase the treatment of
ore from 12,000 tons to something like 30,000 tons a
month. Success depends on the quality and quantity of
the pyritic fluxes available.

After paying calls and expenses, last year’s
dividends at Gympie (t).) only amounted to
*16,786, and it required 77,372 ounces from 162,620 tons
of stone to make that little splash. Out of every £lOO
worth produced, shareholders, after paying their calls,
only received £6. S. Glanmire and Monkland was almost
a dead weight in the balance. Its output was 6657 oz.
from 19,188 tons, and it paid a “ thrippenny.” The pea
under the thimble is hardly more evasive than the
splashes of coarse gold in this mine. Two reefs are beinv
worked (Nos. 2 and 3), and those who stand by the old
show are praying* that black slate will come in contact
with the quartz instead of grey. There are some who
believe that gold will be got in a block of ground on the
western side of the lease, but so far prospecting has given
only negative results. Possibly black slate may be
found at a greater depth.

Kalgoorlie and its daily paper oxploded over
Chairman Landau’s allegation, at the Associated Nor-
thern Co.’s meeting in London, that, so far as he could
see, all the producing mines on the Kalgoorlie field were
approaching an end. Although this pessimism is un-
justified, there is no doubt that, leaving the Horseshoe,
Great Boulder, the Ivanhoe, and, perhaps, the Kalgurli’
out of the reckoning, Kalgoorlie’s cake is fast losing the
plums. Apart from those four great mines, mining men
in the West can’t at present see many more years of
assured prosperity for the Golden Mile.
* * * *
Locally-formed cos. continue to be a byword
and a reproach in the West. The latest to cause financial
injury to its shareholders is the Garden Gully at Cool-
gardie. Twelve months ago this concern was floated
with a loud whoop, but very little cash seems to have
been put up. Anyway, plant was purchased and build-
ings erected on the time-payment system, and two man-
agers were appointed. Later on one of them reported
that 6dwt. crushings could be maintained. Then the new
mill got to work and tore this calculation to ribbons, the
return only averaging 2dwt. Since then a mine-hand got
a verdict, with immediate distress, against the co. ; but
when the bailiff arrived, it was found that the co. hadn’t
any goods of its own—only time-payment “ assets.” As
other threats were flying about, shareholders called them-
selves together and decided to go into liquidation.
* * * *
The Flag Co., at Phillips River (W.A.), is
thinking of erecting its own smelter and other plant at a
cost of £4OOO. By doing so a saving of £3, and possibly
£4, per ton is anticipated, while handsome profits are
expected from the treatment of mill concentrates, which
do not pay to send to the Kaufman smelter. The co. may
also do some ore-buying. Since March last the co. has
crushed 664 tons gold ore worth £5 per ton, and has sent
to the smelter 256 tons ore carrying gold, silver, and
copper worth £lllls. lOd. per ton. “ Yet it is badly off for
funds ; and dividends are in the far distance.
* • • *
North White Feather (W.A.) has postponed
the issue of its report and balance-sheet. A London
director, C. A. Whitfield, is now making “ a thorough
examination of the property,” and shareholders are in-
formed that the report is likely to prove valuable. This
will all depend upon O. A. Whitfield’s qualifications.
Westralia has one capable mining-engineer Whitfield ; but
the London director isn’t the Westraliaq engineer.
* * * *
Two recently-started mills have been closed
down in the West. In one case, that of the Great Ophir,
want of water is the official excuse, while in the other
instance, that of the Lady Miller, the density of the
water used for steam purposes is the plea advanced. It
calls for a bold Board to lay the blame frankly upon the
stone in the mine.
* * * *
Last annual report of the Gold Finance Co.,
which is a London concern interested in the Cosmopolitan
and Bellevue (W.A.), indicates a debit of £7722. The
directors claim that the period covered by the report has
not been favorable for earning profits. Part of the co.’s
principal assets, the mines named, had to be written
down during the past 12 months, and by this time will
stand more writing down still. With a view to effecting
eeonomy, the directors have agreed to reduce their fees
one-half, which means that they will only draw £350
during the current financial year.

Reported that a London co. with plenty of
cash in hand has taken a month’s option over the Trans-
vaal mine at Southern Cross(W.A.). Several people have
nibbled at this property during the past year, but so far
no one has been game to swallow the bait. The bad state
of the London market is the reason assigned, but the
refractory nature of the ore in the mine, and the big
sum required to bring it to a producing stage, are other
reasons prompting buyers to be shy.
* * 9 *
Queen Margaret Co. (W. A.) seeks exemption for
its Bulong property. Local residents are opposing the
application, on the ground that as the co. holds such a
large area it should continue to let portions of it on
tribute. Tributing parties did well for a time, but latterly
they have fared badly, and most of them have thrown up
the sponge. The mine has been well rooted down to
700 ft., and prospects below that point are not encourag-
ing enough to warrant further work.
Austral Valley, Zeehan (Tas.), despite its in-
fusion of Broken Hill blood and all the talk of a London
backing, seems to be a weakling ; £21,000 has gone, and
all the ore has realised so far is £6740. The difference
presumably was made up of calls. What is left is the ore
in a few narrow stopes, a small credit balance, and a whole
lot of blighted hopes.

“R. 8.”: “ Bullfrog ” is a belated sort of tad-
pole in his paragraph against W. J. Loring. Loring said in
the interview mentioned nothing about high wages of
Australian miners, and his statements that the tariff as
first proposed might shut up certain W.A. mines then
trembling between bare payableness and probable
w’orking at a loss were made before Parliament con-
sidered (and reduced) the duties on items of mining
machinery and supplies. The Victorian Deep Leads were
not alluded to, nor even suggested by Loring. They are
not producers, and therefore were not in question.
Loring has been a good employer, who paid high-grade
wages, and insisted on high-grade service. Any stick
seems good enough to beat Bewick-Moreing with nowa-
days ; but outside that fact “ Bullfrog’s ” par. was grossly
unfair, and he is hereby warned that if he doesn’t stick
to the truth a little he will never grow up to be a toad.

Manager Sticht said, the other day, in respond-
ing to a toast, that Mt. Lyell is producing copper cheaper
than any other concern in the world. Probably he limited
the comparison to the cost of laying down blister copper
at the works. The actual work of reducing 50 tons of 2
per cent, ore to a ton of blister copper, at 15s. 6d. per ton
of crude ore, costs £3B 155., and that certainly takes
beating. Mt. Morgan can’t do it; but then Mt. Morgan
blister copper is so rich in gold that the cost of producing
fine copper is reduced to a very low figure.

Miners who wish, to test new country in N.S. W.
under the law which enables them to enter enclosed
lands are often baulked by the landowner who claims
that the area is under.cultivation. If it is under culti-
vation the miners must make for elsewhere, but just as
often there is no crop standing, no seed in the ground,
and no evidence of human industry. Owner and miners
therefore dispute across the fence, and as the fool of a
law does not define what cultivation is, it is plain that
there is great provocation to talk loud, and wave arms,
and use “ blanky ”as an argument. A Ministerial minute
has now been issued stating that cultivated land which
has not been under crop for three years will in future be
considered uncultivated. So far so good. But this is
only a minute, not a law ; it is opposed to the minute of a
previous Minister, and the minute of the next Minister
may say something quite different.

A RAPE OLD BIRD.
STAR BOARDER : “ Will you get me a file, Mrs. Hasher?"
LADY OF THE HASH HOUSE : “ To sharpen the carver . Mr. Star?"
STAR BOARDER : “No, ma'am, to carve this infernal hen."
“W.H.M.”: “T.A.W.” (B. 16/l/’08)
makes rude remarks concerning my sanity and
manner of hunting ’possums. He also says that
’possums do not frequent saplings, except at night.
Well, I hunted at night. “T.A.W.” is wrong
some more when he attributes the passing of the
’possum to poison intended for rabbits. Profes-
sional hunters, by trapping, snaring, and shooting,
had practically exterminated the ’possum long
before rabbits became numerous enough to worry
the landholder. For the rest, “T.A.W.’s”
methods are correct and cold-blooded enough for
anything, and just what might be expected of a
person who admits having slain as many as 50
’possums in a night because of the value of the
skins. “T.A.W.” does not mention the fact, but
’possums may easily be caught in ordinary rabbit
traps by placing a little flour on the plate. Lastly,
no ’possumer’s outfit is complete without a dog to
tree the quarry. “T.A.W.” can have mine cheap.
He and it will make a pair.
“ W.B.H ” : “Lindy Lou” says (B.
23/l/’08) that the butcher bird is the only Aus-
tralian bird which thinks of the next day’s needs
of Little Mary. What about the big swamp-
hawk, which invariably lays a breakfast aside for
himself and missus ? The pair don’t need to dust
round early in the morning, since there is always
a rabbit or so carefully planted in the commissariat
department as a result of the previous evening’s
hunt. Quite true that the thieving bird may be
abroad at daylight, but experience has taught me
that he doesn’t need to tighten his belt before
starting. He has a snack off bunny, and just
likes to lift a chicken by way of a side dish.

“ Brad ” : In his discourse on the Barwon
“fisheries” (B. 23/1/08), “ J.A.S.” says—“ There
are no other ‘ fisheries ’ like them in this or any
other State.” Wrong. At Lake Condah mission
station, in the Western District (Vic.), where the
scanty aborigine is yarded and shod with the
Gospel, these “ fisheries ” are as plentiful as State
grievances are in Sydney. Have often gone the
rounds of the “yards” with the blacks to collect
the inhabitants, and carried home as many as 80
eels caught during one night.

“The Prooshan ” : Been visiting a
sawmill on the Murray watershed. A Pelton
wheel and 12-h.p. engine were keeping three cir-
culars ripping through the mountain ash with a
noise like the tear of a firing-line, and I couldn’t
hear a word the manager was saying. I could
only watch his eyebrows and mouth, and just nod
or snigger when it looked as though a nod or a
snigger was the proper thing. As we jogged up
to the house for dinner I said, “Well, now. I’m
blode if I heard a word you said down there in
the mill.” He laughed, and made this lucid
explanation : “ Get used to the n’ise in time, and
y’can’t get along without it. lean yere every
word a man says. Yer see, I know the saws is
there, an’ I don’t listen to ’em. I just listen out-
side er them to the man. When you’re there it’s

Mr. W. Windred, a Melbourne mining
man, recently returned from a prospecting trip
through the Northern Territory ; and his story is
another plea for early Commonwealth control: —
We travelled about 500 miles each way, and touched
some 250 miles inland. No fewer than 225 miles was
through one station on the Victoria River. The ground
is heavily covered with great coarse grass, and its stock-
carrying capacity is practically unknown, because it is
not carrying enough cattle to eat off the rough pastures.
The rainfall is regular, and averages about 30 inches
yearly. The holdings are too large, and are obtained too
cheaply to be worked to any advantage. Victoria Downs,
for instance, is 12,000 square miles, and has 60 miles
double frontage to the Victoria River. The large stations
run from 80,000 to 100,000 head of cattle each, and brand
annually from 15,000 to 18,000 head of young stock. But
many of them don’t know to within 20,000 head how
much stock they have. They work without fences, and
with an utter insufficiency of station hands. The owners
manage their places on the most cheeseparing lines, re-
fusing to develop the country themselves, and prevent-
ing others from doing so. The resources of the country
we passed through are untold. The land is composed
largely of rich alluvial flats and fertile plains. Kangaroos
and all kinds of game abound. The mineral possibilities
have hardly been touched upon, and coal in payable
quantities has been found at Wyndham and elsewhere.
If freezing works were erected on the Victoria River a
200-mile drive for stock would be saved, and stock-raising
would go ahead by leaps and bounds. But the present
holders are not likely to initiate any forward policy.
They are making fortunes by keeping underpaid mana-
gers on vast areas of practically unused land, and it is
not to be expected that they will move in establishing
conditions dangerous to the continuance of the great
monopolies obtained from South Australia almost for a
song.
“ The Bushranger ” returns to the charge
after receiving an answer in “ Correspondence ” :
Your reply to my wordy (?) yarn is a fine conglomera-
tion of nonsense and stupidity. You say the subject is
old —old as sin—but you are wrong. Do you mean to
say that cows are dying everywhere, everyday, mysterious
and unaccountable deaths, and no effort is made to find
out the cause of, and discover a remedy for, such a
calamity? You say that Ido not know what the cow died
of. Of course I don’t. Had I known the cause of death,
why the blazes would I have sent such a beautiful and
graphic account to the B. ? As the cow mysteriously died
(not simply died, as you yell), I thought a par in the B.
would cause some person to send in a few directions that
would be of use in case a similar case of cow sickness
occurred. The case calls for no stimulating criticism ;it
calls for some useful knowledge. I contradict you loudly
when you say that cows have been dying everywhere,
everyday, after four hours’ illness, and no one been able
to tell the cause of death. Do you know of one instance ?
You tell me to delve deeper into my subject. What
do you mean by telling me to delve deeply into a
dead cow ? I would like to delve into a living “ cow ”if
I had the power. When a scribbler sends in a few re-
marks about a decaying pine tree (B. 16/l/’08) you give
him space ; but when a brilliant writer sends a par on a
subject whose discussion would be productive of much
good, you rise with a bray and an asinine hoof and kick
the precious MS. into the W.P.B. If you get better, fish
that cow obituary notice out of the'basket and let the
case be laid before the Court of Bulletin readers for dis-
cussion, and may the result prove useful in retaining
the services of many a poor working man’s onlv milk
producer to him and his young family of white Aus-
tralians.
P.S. —This is not written for The Bulletin, but for the
stupidiot (word invented, patented, and copyrighted and
for sale by “The Bushranger”) who jumped on and
penned the stupid reply to my clever cow yarn that was
a real fact, and not gilded or in any way misleading.
What about the anthrax case, Maitland way, lately?
THE GAUNT STEED.
THE DEALER : “ Better take him, sir. He’s a bit thin, but he's all right."
THE BUYER (wearily): “ Oh, well, you can send him up this afternoon."
THE DEALER: “ But what if you're out, sir !”
THE BUYER : “ Well, you can put him under the door."
‘ ‘ Agricola ” : Have waited anxiously in the
hope that some fellow-Aboliar would back me up
in my statement that a ’possum, when pursued
vehemently by a gohanna, fell and extinguished
himself. “W.H.M.” (B. 19/12/’O7) remarks that
’possums do not hurt themselves when they fall.
Of course they don’t—not when they are calm and
thoughtful. A badly-scared ’possum is no more
responsible for its actions than a similar man. I
once saw a man fall over a brick and damage him-
self considerably in the process. He wasn’t
insane, but he was frightened of dogs, and it was
a particularly large dog that was after him.
When out walking with a man, who generally
carries a level head, we were bailed up by an
indignant snake. My companion fired at him in
rapid succession his hard-hitter hat, his pocket-
knife, and, lastly, half-a-crown—his sole remain-
ing weapon. In his terror, he would have hurled
me as a sacrifice, had I been of convenient size.
Now a ’possum bailed up by a gohanna is the
worst rattled animal out, and is as liable to break
its neck falling from a tree as “W.H.M.” him-
self.

“ Mannering ” : I have frequently found a
paddymelon dead in the snare. No kick or signs
of a struggle. Always good, healthy-looking
chaps, too. Never could see or hear of any reason
for sudden demise when trapped. Never found
the brush wallaby take on so suddenly. Yet the
paddymelon often puts up a good fight when
snared. The brush is no fighter—
always anxious to keep an urgent ap-
pointment a few miles away, taking the
springer and all with him. I put up
about 270 rounds with a “paddy” one
morning. Though handicapped with a
stiff springer, he struck rue several
places at once when I first went in to get
his tail. Then he mixed it with somer-
saults, and turned up in so many places
at once that I was for some time en-
deavoring to get where he wasn’t. Never saw a
wallaby so willing. He was about as old as some
of Tom Bent’s promises, and hissed during the
mill like a bellowdrama villain !
“Coalopolis” (8/l/’08) : He the Northern
Territory, where, ’tis said, a white man can’t live.
I have had some correspondence on the subject
with a friend who has been for ten years a resi-
dent of the Territory. He says in one of his
letters: “ The climate, taken as a whole, is
healthy. Intermittent fever is the only epidemic
that ever attacks the settlements, and a great deal
of this is due to ‘ liquoring up.’ I have lived in
other tropical climates, and can conscientiously
assert that the Northern Territory is healthy.
From the geographical position of Port Darwin,
its harbor, rivers, pastoral and agricultural lands,
minerals, and the prospect of a transcontinental
railway to connect with South Australia, there is
no doubt that this portion of the continent is
bound to become a great country.” Hear also
what another correspondent hath to say on the
matter: “The climate, though hot, is very enjoy-
able. The mornings and evenings are fine and
cool. There is generally a cool breeze during some
portion of the day. The sky is usually very clear
and cloudless ; the stars, however, do not shine
as brilliantly as might be expected in this region.”
The latter writer also says, “ You have not to
travel many miles without meeting with water. I
never yet found any that was not drinkable.
None of it appears to be brackish.”

Adelaide Register has discovered a pony
that lives chiefly on mutton-birds. It belongs to
the lighthouse at South Neptune Island (S.A.),
where the birds live and burrow in millions. The
pony “ secures them in their burrows, disembowels
and partly eats them,” and it is in “ wonderfully
good condition.”

query (B. 23/l/’08) as to how the black cockatoo
locates his breakfast grub : When the winged son
of Satan sallies forth in the dewy morn to hunt
the succulent insect, he relies on nothing more
wonderful than his sense of hearing. The gnaw-
ing of wood grubs in a tree can easily be heard at
a distance of a foot or more, and if “B. & D.”
will imitate the bird’s method of procedure by
placing the large cavernous gulf of his ear close to
the bark of the tree, and will chase round and
about the same until he finds the spot where
the disturbance is most distinctly audible, and
will bite sufficiently hard on that spot, he will
meet with as much success as cocky does.

.“Mularula”: To “Ham’s” statement
that “ if you are in search of big tallies you must
go to Queensland every time,” I reply : “What
about that Yancannia team, which averaged 180

the difference between N.S.W. and Queensland

JENNIE GREEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jennie Green, a full-blooded aboriginal, reported to
have been queen of a tribe of blacks formerly inhabiting
the Lake Condah district, has died in the Ararat (Vic.)
Asylum for the Insane. She was 70 years of age.
How many thousand kings and queens of brave but brief
command
Are mingled with the dust to-day, or scattered with the
sand?
How many thousand Jennie Greens who ruled the sons
of men
Are marching with the spirit tribes beyond all mortal ken?
How many thousand tribesmen hailed this lady as their
queen ? '
And who will pray on bended knees to-night for Jennie
Green?' >
For her no mournful tidings speed around the hustling
world ;
For her no waving banners are in silence drooped and
furled ;
For her no cable messages to regal quarters fly ;
For her there booms no requiem ; no flags are half-mast
high ;
For her no holy church bells ring ; no mourners crowd
the scene—
But who will say a prayer to-night for vanished Jennie
Green ?
She did, perchance, as other queens, her unavailing best,
And p’r’aps ’tis well that Jennie Green has gone to endless
rest !
’Twere better had she died long ere she saw the White
Man come—
With crucifix and rifle, aye, and Bible, tracts and rum !
’Twere better far for Jennie, p’r’aps, had such things
never been
But now, when all is said and done, who’ll pray for Jennie
Green ?
Her lands were not as wide as those of other queenly
heads,
But O ! the sunsets painted them in ever-changing reds !
The stars gazed on them guardian-like, and silverly the
Cross
Gleamed down from Heaven’s treasure-house on Jennie’s
gain or loss ;
The white moon shed its lustre in a soft mysterious
sheen—
But who will say a prayer to-night—one prayer for Jennie
Green ?
No pictures fine of Jennie Green have ever come to me ;
No lords and ladies bowed before Her Gracious Majestee !
No fashion journals photographed the things she mostly
wore
(A smile, a frown, a worried look, perchance—and nothing
more !);
Nt> gay postillions bore her out her soldiers’ ranks
between
But who will offer up a prayer to God for Jennie Green ?
Did tribal folk kneel by her last sad sordid couch of pain,
And probe the mystery of why Queen Jennie was insane v
Did rival aspirants beseech her sceptre and her crown?
And did she name her followers —and were they black or
brown ?
Or did she as Camilla die—or Mary Magdalene ?
And who will pray on bended knees to-night for Jennie
Green ?

“Burchie” : I think I can tell “ X.P.P.”
(B. 2/1/ 08) and others whoought toknow—butdon’t
—what the blacks use to stop the bleeding of a
wound, and to cause its speedy healing. When
trapping with Dad, some years ago, I severed the
big vein in my forearm with a gut-knife. The
gore spurted all over the premises and Dad. I
felt pale. When Father had wiped the blood out
of his eye, he pulled a handful of leaves from a
eucalyptus tree, chewed them into a pulp, clapped
it on the cut, and bandaged it on with apiece
of his shirt. The bleeding stopped instantlv.
About six days later there was just a faint mark
where the cut had been. Pa got the wrinkle from
a black, who had cut two toes off with an axe.
The nigger treated the wound as above, and a
week later the stumps had healed. Have often
had occasion since to use the same remedy in the
bush, and it has never failed. Whether box, red
gum, or mallee leaves are used, there is appar-
ently no difference. I might mention that the
old man says this treatment has the same effect
on horses, cattle, and dogs as on the human.
One Brackenridge, of Narrabri (N.S.W.),
lately arrived at civilisation with an alarming
narrative. Brackenridge is a prospector, and one
day, while in the vicinity of Mount Lindsay, he
saw an unusual sort of animal, something like a
tiger, only it was brown, and had a large bushy
tail with which it fanned itself and its two
cubs. It was sitting by a rock and uttering
howls like a dingo. Brackenridge gazed at
it with awe from a distance of 75yds. He had
to keep that far away to allow the bushy tail
enough room to wave freely. Then Brackenridge
decided to shoot the beast, and was just turning
round to go back for his rifle when he managed to
dislodge several stones. The noise startled the
tiger-dingo, or the diger, or the tingo, or whatever
it was, also its family ; and the three of them
started for home in a series of enormous bounds,
the mother going in front and the cubs leaping
behind and helping to wave the large bushy tail.
Brackenridge tired three shots from his Win-
chester at the tail, but either he must have missed
or the tail was bullet-proof, because it went straight
ahead without stopping, and disappeared in the
hills. Probably the animal was Capital leaving
the country. Capital generally waves a long tale.
A FINANCIAL MATTER.
“ If she's always going out with other blokes, why
don't you chuck her? ”
“ Well, you see, I've spent too much money on her."
“ Pilgrim ” : Once saw on the Clarence
River (N.S.W.) a fish with feet. It had a snake-
like head and the ordinary fishy body and tail.
When it saw me coming it sprinted about five
yards into the water. This self-same freak has
robbed me of the last shred of my reputation for
veracity among my friends, but recently I met a
man from Papua who says he has seen them there,
and that they can climb trees.
A PUZZLER.
LITTLE BILL : “I say, granpa, why do they have Sydney so far away from where all the
people lives!"
“ Koolka ” ; Don’t quite know why, but
“W.J.A.’s” story of an emu chasing a drunk
reminds me of a little bush comedy. On a certain
Darling station the Chow cook was sent into the
township for the mail. Coming up to the rear of
the town he saw his first camel. He pulled up
short, looked very hard, and comforted himself
with the idea that it was an emu. He sidled still
nearer, his curiosity being aroused. The camel
made no sign, and the Chow
got dangerously close. “I
thinkimemu alii,” said John.
Here the camel reached out
its neck, made a hideous
face, flapped about a yard
of under lip, and sneezed.
The last seen of the Chow
he had his hat under his arm
and was streaking for the sta-
tion, yelling “ Lion ! Lion ! ”
The Chow has a poor know-
ledge' of natural history.
Nature study can’t be taught
in Chinese State schools. I
was once staying on a station
which possessed a fine fruit
garden superintended by a
Chow. Parrots used to work
havoc amongst the fruit, and
it was the Chow’s business to
call me when a raid was
made. Then it was my busi-
ness to bog in with dust shot.
But for the life of me I
couldn’t make that Chow dis-
tinguish between a parrot
and any other bird. He’d
come to my window, wring-
ing his hands, yelling, “Mil-
lings pallots.” I’d rush to
the garden to find a harmless
tomtit in the pepper tree, or
an emu gazing; over the
fence. Eventually the Chow
was provided with a 30s.
muzzle-loader, and told to do
his own slaughter. I gave
him a lesson in loading.
Next day I happened on the
Chow chasing a disconcerted
coot, with the gun pointing
at the world in general. At
the end of the gun was what
appeared to be a white flag. I told him to cut it
short, examined the gun, and found he’d mixed
the powder and shot and screwed half a news-
paper into the muzzle. The Chow is a great
sportsman.
One favorite argument of the Tory press—
that the breaking up of large estates to allow of
closer settlement will mean the decrease of wool-
growing and the ultimate disappearance of the
jumbuck— is knocked on the head by the latest
Victorian statistics, which show that while the
Bent State flocks have increased from 10.000,000
to 13,000,000 in the last three years, no less than
43'5 per cent, of the sheep are at present held in
lots of 2,000 or less. The genuine cultivator is
just as well able to grow wool as the squatter,
only he doesn’t need miles of country to do it.
TROUSER DAY AT THE ZOO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In a recent Argus discussion on “ Decency ” one
Jerennas complained that the animals at the Zoo-
logical Gardens were undraped.
Come, Judkins, let us to the Zoo,
And garb the heathen beast!
That to the pious eye the view
May be perpetual feast;
Till vistas open, so to speak.
Of soulful sights that can’t
Bring blushes to the mellow cheek
Of any maiden aunt.
We 11 robe the leopard and his spot,
The little lions drape ;
Put bloomers on the hippopot,
Pyjamas on the ape ;
The tigers in a gaudy check,
In purple stripes the gnu !
Aye, trousers, trousers, all the way
Shall soothe the Christian view
When we array (on Trouser-Day)
The heathen at the Zoo !

David K. : You begin your literary career by
costing us 4d. for short postage. And did you ever see
anything in this paper to make you think we wanted an
essay on “Perseverance”? C.A.B. : “ John’s Methods ’’
shows some ability, but it is crude stuff. If you had
started young, and pegged in continuously, you might
have developed a good literary style. YVhether you have
time to do the necessary developing is another matter
P.C.S. : No, The Bulletin doesn’t regard it as genuine.
Nowadays it consists of one drunken impostor, and one
uneducated incapable, and a few clerks... .Onion : Verses
not up to much and subject getting played 0ut....N. :
“ English Mail ” quite impossible. Literary style is even
more ramshackle than a certain ten-head battery the
writer once owned... .Enquirer (Brisbane): Go to
your local doctor. That is the one sensible plan....
Ansonia: A bit too abattoiry for us... .M. E. Leville : A
mere statement of fact, and this world is over-
loaded with fact... .Trixie : Not much... .Lifelike :
The basket moans with descriptions of Outback race-
meetings \V. H. YVebberley : (1) Is it worth publishing?
No. (2) Is there scope for improvement? Yes.... Wilfrid
J. S. : You have the cheek to call that a story?
Haven’t you ever read any stories? Lottali: Do you
really think we want another poem beginning :
Australia, my country —the land I love best ! ?
....Apollo Belvidere: Rather flat... .Motor: Such
rhymes as “ importer ” and “ oughter,” also, “ sweater,”
and “get a” kill it deader than Pekah, the son of
Remaliah... .E.H.G.: Address to the sea in blank verse
is a failure. The sea has been so often addressed that it
isn’t easy to think of anything new to say to it. Why not
write the sea’s address to the speck of poet on the shore ?
....L.T.C. : “Mrs. Grundy” bumps considerably in her
metre. “ Pipe ” also halts on one leg Swallow :
“ Saga” cheerful but hopelessly erratic J.B.S. :
“ Ruminations ” hard to read, and scrawly, and blotty.
Perhaps these things made “Ruminations” look worse
than they were. Anyhow they’re dead.... Elfrida :
“ Inevitable ” built with too reckless a disregard of the
length of the lines. Don’t ask for a soulless regularity,
but when an elephant and a pony' are harnessed together
they r look too irregular... .Gus Miller : That event which
you locate at “a country town” happened in London
nearly 30 years ago, and the police interfered H.G. :
Ballad of Twelve Dead Oats not well enough done.
Try three cats next time, and work up. A young poet
shouldn’t begin with more cats than he can handle....
Gibber: Heaved out; too du11... .Brad : Your reply
delves with too appalling an intimacy into the minor de-
tails of the hen’s anatomy. Remember that sentiments
of modesty are by no means confined to Randwick
aldermen about the season of the municipal elections.
Even the hen has her moments of confusion,
the which it behoves a kindly writer to respect.’...
Gobang : Your jokes are the best typed for their age this
paper has had in years O. Maclean : Ingenious in spots,
but not worth while....P. YVink : Beer-drinking contest
doesn’t entice us.. ~M.: “ A Tonic ” is too precipitous
S. W. Pearce: Good yarn; pity' you can’t tell it...
YVabash : Sprry we’ve run out of printable opinions....
Pilgrim : Your account of how a poet came to Noolora just
misses. Wait till an auctioneer or bookmaker arrives,
and then try again... .Ivuon : You have no ear for metre
as witness the following, which even a Freetrade dialec-
tician would shrink from fathering :
Don’t you see the goods Australia can’t make
Are the goods we import tis a fearful mistake
To the foreigner for goods Australia must go
Or into bankruptcy soon us you’ll throw
For the policy clear is the Tariff low.
.. ..Ecco : But the many who haven’t seen a mine would
say, “ Yes, but where’s the joke?” Magpie: Thanks,
but it’s much too hot to go to gaol just now... .(J.A.B. :
You have observation, and—given a good subject—
should do something. Try again Tomly : “Lone
Man ” fine subject; but you don’t rise half-way to it
Jumb : Bather inferior dog story.. ..YV.G.T. : One of the
jokes is old; one doubtful; none of much use for illus-
tration. .. .G.A. P. : “ Vows” has points, but the stagger
in its metre is too pronounced.. . .C.H.R.: “ What Does
it Matter?” has got the same disease in the feet that
afflicted Asa, King of Judah... .Fred Blair (Bendemer) :
Your devotional poem is a bold rugged effort. In its line
it is probably unique. Consider, tor instance, the con-
cluding verse :
All that can be done for outward looks is did,
That is upon the merits where you stand.
But when I convert you from your secret vice
Then, Oh Grand we’ll stand 1 behold the Heavenly Band.
In the Western States of America men have been shot
for less.. . .Claud R. Beresford : You fell in a reverie.
The reverie fell in a basket... .Crazy Jay: Story of
butting William butted elsewhere.... Jay Peele : Only
thing original in your yarns is your pen-name.. ..Bill's
Dream : Don’t see why you want to tell us in nineteen
stanzas that Bill dreamt that he went to Sheol. He’ll
get there all right, and if we have any political influence
over the Judge, we’ll see he doesn’t prove a n alibi....
Nabob : There is no moral to be drawn from the case of
your fruit-growing friend who found his agent was
swindling him over cherry sales and accepted £lOO to
shut up about the matter. Send details of a fruit-grower
who discovered his agent’s dishonesty, insisted on a
prosecution, and refused “hush money” absolutely, and
the thing will be of interest... .Gladys: “On the
lianch ” where
The thoughts turn back to Home,
Back across the churling foam,
is bad in phrasing, spelling, rhyming, metre, and 941
other things... .E.S.A. (Me. Gam bier ) : Can’t allow the
local ladies to walk about in our columns “ clothed in
virgin white and with bare limbs shining like dazzling-
alabaster.” Tam: Received poem in which Billy
Fairer tries to rhyme with morrow, sorrow and Yarra.
The attempt failed. So did your attempt to send the
thing from Melbourne to Sydney for a penny Jan
McAught: Thin, but promising... .YY'.P.B. : In regard to
your " Royal Arms ” wail the position is like this: Pro —
The Governor-General always has considerable money to
spend on boots, hats and clothes. He can afford to go to
tne best shops when he wants any of these articles.
There is a class which can’t decide for itself on the best
shops, and likes to have them indicated. Con —There is
another class which would buy decayed eggs at Is. 3d.
apiece if it were sure the hen that committed the horrors
was “ under vice-regal patronage.” C.M. : You take
about 800 words to tell “P. YVinkle ” that fish burrow
into the mud when waterholes dry up, and there remain
seemingly dead and paralysed (but really in the
full possession of their faculties) till a flood arrives
YVilliam le Moir : Your theory that a death-rate among
(Queensland women of 783 per 100,000, and among men of
1099 per 100,000, makes an average of 941 per 100,000 (not
950, as this paper stated in leading article 30/l/’08) would
be all right if the number of men and women were
exactly the same. But they aren’t. YVhen 292,609 men
are dying off at the 1099 rate, and 242,504 women at the 783
rate, the average is 950. So your very large and patronising
attitude on the matter arises out of your own ignorance..
Allan L. : “ Flotsam ” is a careless and confused lament
that only rhymes now and then... .J.B. : Have sent to
8. Africa for a copy of the new Transvaal Immigration
Law. Can’t answer your question as yet....E.T.: “Mis-
judged” is pathos, but it isn’t poetry... .Ped : Metre
something shocking Paddymelon : Your picture of
the lowly schoolmistress whose goloshes are cleaned by
her scholars, and who, when she eats fruit, has a girl
pupil standing beside her with an open hand extended for
the peel to be dropped into, looks improbable. ...Croydon :
Have fixed a gloomy eye on your poetic sun-phantasy
M.P. : “ Moon ” mere lazy rhyming... .Pat: Too mechan-
ical Konini: Not vivid enough; in a sketch of that
kind, everything depends on making the characters live.
....E.H. (Burwood): YY’e admire your energy, but the
killing of three rats isn’t worth three columns —that
would be one rat per column.., .Nico: “ Debacle ” lacks
human interest. Even 495 dead cows don’t make a real
story Lucifer : Had too many descriptions of that
scene, and six others got ahead of you... Oockie : A man
who gets as white-hot as you do ought to read things
carefully, or some day he’ll get into trouble. Bulletin
didn't say every bag in the Mongolia weighed 3601 b,
YVhat it did say was that every bag of several truck-
loads that went by the Mongolia weighed 3601 b..,,,
Reginald Helm : In the first page you tell us the same
th. ng nine times, and on the next page you tell it some
more times, and the rest of the story—if it is a story—is
so illegible that it looks like an impressionist landscape,
YYVve sent it down to the art editor to find out if it is an
impressionist landscape Roamer: If ever we start a
competition for Damn Bad Verse, you will have a
chance... .Ivan : Too obvious... .Crosscut: Your “ first
attempt in the direction of short stories ” hasn’t got very
far. Perhaps it is going in the wrong direction ... Pagan :
Your threat to write a story for us every week “ equiva-
lent to ” the one you submit is the hottest thing we’ve
struck this week —and it’s been a hot week YVai-
marino : Don’t want to hear aboutdogs thesedog-days
C. Dunne : Too long-winded.. ..C. 8. Gilmour : Nearly
Joyous Pagan : Verses suggest that you are a rather
cheerless heathen. Also, “star” won’t rhyme with
“ Aroha.”... .Bridget O’Flannagan : Curious mixture of
old Irish bulls. Not one really young bull among them.
Look Out: Regarding your new theory about the
parentage of old Carbine, can only say that it is a wise
horse that knows its own father....G. Skene: Many
thanks. Not much good contradicting here, but that
English paper has been written to Commercial Bob :
If. as you say, you can “ draw as well as Norman
Lindsay,” send your drawings along and you’ll get paid
for them A.J.YV. : A very poor heap of jokes
Elfrida : Get a two-foot rule and measure your lines
before you send them in Sligo Bay: There are draw-
backs about your “ poem”—many drawbacks Unsuit-
able : Oxo, Commander (Edward-street), John Farman
(Florence), Sid Finney, Guyblat, F. 1., Runham.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
VeraS. : It might be worse if it tried very hard
Eric B. : “Choler v. Collar” has no life or energy in
it H.M.S. : Not a good picture, but a fairly good
libel Alex. N. : Nothing even faintly hopeful in the
batch Henry C. : Not art, not humor, not anything
.. A.N.C. : Your pictures of Chinatown lack the neces-
sary element of horror. YVe know a dozen Chinese
settlements which could knock yours into a cocked hat
There comes to hand from Kobe (Japan)
a gorgeous envelope, bearing the printed legend,
“Commissioner in the East, Government of the
State of N.S.W.” It also says, in a wild burst of
bad spelling, that it is “On his Brittanic
Majesty’s Service,” but “the East” is the most
humorous point. Japan isn’t “East” from the
place that pays the Commissioner’s salary. Why
doesn’t he stick to facts and call himself “Com-
missioner in Eastern Asia ” ?

J. C. Watson’s personal influence in the
Labor movement does not seem to have waned in
the least through his resignation of the leadership.
Last week theN.S.W. Political Labor Conference,
in his absence, carried by a huge majority a reso-
lution that Labor membersmust be bound by the
Labor platform as from time to time amended.
Later on Watson attended and pointed out the
unreasonableness of asking a member of Parlia-
ment, after he had been elected on a certain plat-
form, to change that platform during the life of a
Parliament without consulting his constituents.
And the Conference by a huge majority promptly
reversed its previous resolution.
“ The Listener ” writes :
There died on the last Sunday of the Old Year poor
Archie Fyffe, journalist and typical Bohemian, of Mel-
bourne. He was scattering around Melbourne on Friday,
searching as ever for the elusive coin, and on the follow-
ing Sunday he was dead, from a carbuncle on the neck
which suddenly elected to develop. He was only 32, was
Fytfe, stout and strong, hard as nails with his years of
struggle among the Philistines. At time of death he ran
two of Melbourne’s trade journals, one devoted to the
man of sand and sugar, the other upholding the dignity
of the chooky hen. Some years ago he carried on, in
company with W. H. Elsum, another Melbourne ink-
slinger, now in Sydney, the People’s Journal, of Williams-
town and Footscray. It ultimately fell into the hands of
the printer’s broker. Fyffe did a little of everything,
from hypnotism and magnetic healing to that last in-
firmity of noble minds, compositing. He was never any
considerable success at anything, chiefly because he was
never averse to sharing his last “ bob” with a needy pal.
Judge Murray, of N.S.W., who receives
from the Wade Government a letter of thanks for
conducting, without charge, the inquiry into the
working of coal-cutting machinery, has already
accumulated a little art gallery of such encomiums.
It was the practice one time for N.S.W. Judges
to charge extra for work done on royal commis-
sions, but Murray abandoned the habit. Money
out of pocket he charges, but he considers his pro-
fessional services the property of the State. He
divided electorates, for which the I)ibbs Govern-
ment thanked him ; set up Local Government
divisions, for which the Reid Government thanked
him ; won batches of thanks from Carruthers on
various matters, and has now started auspiciously
with Wade.
“ Dooly e ” : Par re Georg Driitschel, the
long-haired globe-walker who shot through Mel-
bourne with very little on during the hot spell
(B. 30/l/’08), recalls my interview with him while
he was in Sydney last November. The natur-
rnensch (natural man), as he called himself, clothed
himself outwardly in four garments—hat, coat,
pants, and boots. Inwardly, he said, he was
attired in beer. He gave me a little pamphlet
explaining his system of living. I was much struck
with the following advice re beer-drinking (bier-
kneipen):—
For beer-drinking, one should select a large, well-
ventilated hall, so that the sinoke and bad air have easy
exit and fresh air easy entrance. Don’t stay inside too
long, but go out every now and then and absorb some
outside atmosphere. Headache cotnes seldom from beer-
drinking, but for the most part from bad air. Eat bread
and cheese with your beer. Beer-drinking is much better
in the open, as one does not get drunk so quick as by
drinking inside.
Westralia seems to be a fearfully demoral-
ising place for parsons—especially Methodist par-
sons. Conference ex-President, or ex-Conference
President, Bird, who went out last week, was the
third to give the sect pain in recent times. One was
drummed out for not getting drowned as reported
—he flew with an alien Flossie instead. Another
took to land-booming, and—horrors !—pub-keep-
ing. Now Thomas Bird, who got himself mixed up
with ex-Treasurer Illingworth in land deals, has
gone into the bush, and left his life there. And it
was in Perth, too, that Tremayne Dunstan drifted
into the trouble that burst over him in Sydney and
made “Mr. James’” Pitt-street Congregational
Church so sad. It hasn’t been only the Westralian
parson either that has dabbled in land; the
church has done it too. “Trinity,” where the
Rev. Dunstan came from, is in so solid a position on
account of its rents that it can afford to sniff
almost scornfully at the collection plate.
RE THE DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA.
The Sydney D.T. still clamors against the military
training of the people as proposed by the Deakin Go-
vernment.
“ What! You're mad! Expect me to defend my
country!! It’s too dangerous!! I Besides,
what would become of the paper?”
“Jean S.” : The latest addition to Mel-
bourne street amusements is a stout, brown-
whiskered person, who is advertising the simple
life. He is garbed in loosely-fitting garments,
which appear to be mostly shirt, coat, and pants,
all a shabby grey, like his immense sombrero.
His occupation is the sale of printed requests to
get close to Nature ; but as people do that often at
the seaside without any directions, the apostle
isn’t making a fortune. His face is rather superior
—a sort of Israelitish conception of Hall Caine’s
visage in repose, while the rest of him might be-
long to the musical nigger at Rickards.
*‘ Agricola 11 : “ Mallarapoonie ” (B. 9/1/08)
theorises regarding the personalities of Bulletin
cofltribiltofs. ‘‘Agricola” he thinks of as "a
Professor of Agriculture at the Hawkesbury
College ; rose to his present position from a eow-
eocky’s slave.” Alas, “Agricola” is really an
inoffensive bush pedagogue
from the Riverina. For
myself I conjure “ Mal-
larapoonie ” as living
West-o’-tfarling ; and
he is tall and dark, with
a heart to match his
feet. He drives two
horses in a tray buggy,
and hollers “Good-
day ” to everyone he
meets. Swaggies
lie down in the
shade when they
see him com-
ing, and wait
for a lift.

Intelligence Department at £550 a year, is
reckoned as safe for- the directorship of that
Department in due course. Meanwhile his friend
Carruthers stands by him, and the sun still shines
on Percy. Joseph goes to England in March to
represent N.S.W. at the Anglo-French Exhibition,
and the indispensable Percy jaunts likewise as
Joe’s private secretary. In fact the sun of Joseph
seems to be always shining on Percy.
The Westralian Government lately ap-
pointed a commission to paw over the ruins of Fred
Illingworth, once a Victorian land boomer and
M.L.C., afterwards Treasurer in George Leake’s
two short-lived Groper Ministries, and later
Chairman of Committees in the Assembly at
Perth. The Commission alleges that when Illing-
worth was Treasurer he bought some land for
£3000; that he brought it under Torrens Act as
worth £2OOO ; that he sold it to a sort of agent of
his own for £2500 ; that, as Treasurer, he ap-
proved of a loan of £4300 of Savings Bank money
on the security of the land (which was really his
own), and of £3OOO worth of buildings which were
to be erected thereon ; that he only put £2OOO
worth of buildings thereon ; and that he finally
sold out for £7500 to a clerg3 T man named Bird,
making a profit of £1326. Illingworth is
64 now. When he collapsed in nerves and
pocket and general health, it was proposed that
Parliament should grant him £lOOO to go away
and die peacefully on, and £4OO Was advanced in
an informal way to clear off pressing debts and
carry the old man back to his old Victorian
haunts. Whether Westralia will be too much
shocked to pay the other £6OO or not isn’t decided
yet. Westralia is considering how shocked it
ought to be. Meanwhile Rev. Thomas Bird,
the Methodist parson who bought the land
already mentioned, has committed suicide twice ;
he took strychnine first and shot himself after-
wards. He left a letter behind him asking for a
plain funeral. There was no shadow of a sus-
picion that there was anything wrong about
Bird’s dealings—in fact, his land specs, (he and
Illingworth were partners in many) seem to
have been unlucky enough to be proof against
suspicion. He died partly of the mortgages and
partly through his hatred of publicity, but mostly
of the mortgages.
Clem Hill, the cricketer, is the newest
member of the Adelaide Stock Exchange. For
years he has been an “ outside” broker ;
but the copper and silver-lead booms
have burst, and between booms the
“ outside ” broker freezes. So Clement
goes inside, where there is more warmth.
Aged 74, Charles Roberts left this mes-
sage, with 1908 just coming in sight
To all my friends, —l am tired and weary of life. I have
taken a dose of morphia. I wish you all a Happy New
Year.
A remarkable rolling stone was Roberts. Born in
Hamburg, he was a medical student and various
other things, rushed to the Victorian diggings
with the earliest of them, and followed up the
game right along to the days of the Palmer. He
had luck at odd times—on Charters Towers he
had one of the best early-day reefs. After the
Palmer, he felt he was getting old, and drifted to
Kangaroo Hills tinfield (Q.), and his message tells
the end. Also the morphia recalls that in his
wanderings he turned his medical-student experi-
ence to some good account, as sick Ishmaelites on
a dozen fields will gratefully remember.
“ Coalopolis ” writes :
Recently-deceased stationmaster Holt, who bossed
Waratah (N.S.W.) railway station for quite a long time,
was a familiar figure at military parades. He was the
proud possessor of dozens of medals, received from
various societies for saving various lives, and to see him
limping along, in his uniform of a lieutenant of artillery,
one would be inclined to believe that the battle-field was
quite his ordinary place of residence. Seeing him on
parade one day, I got curious as to where he had got his
Jimp from, and inquired, for it was a well-known fact that,
for all his medals and his uniform, he had never been to a
gory war, or looked in the cannon’s mouth to see if the
bubble reputation was at home. It seems he was
out shooting when a young fellow, and, while
some distance away from his camp, he got bitten
bv a black snake, just under the calf of the leg.
He did not yell out or go off his head, but with his
knife cut out. the bite, put in a charge of powder, set a
match to it—and then there was the explosion, after
which he walked to camp and stuffed the hole with salt.
Your readers have a terrible lot to say about bush pluck,
but I think they can’t beat the above. Besides being a
familiar figure at military parades and on the railway
station he was always to the fore in celebrating New
Year’s Eve, when, arrayed in all his glory, he’d yank a
couple of small cannon across to the middle of Waratah
Park, and then fire at tpace. He was a good shot, and hit
space every time.
The man who saved the stranded Nor-
wegian steamer Thode Fagelund from a tight
place on Cronulla beach was Charles C, Spinks,
master-mariner, of Sydney. The Thode was on a
rocky bottom, which jagged through the ship,
with an ugly reef lying between it and the open
sea. Spinks took charge on January 24, and was
cordially assured by every shellback who knew
him that the job was hopeless. Spinks waited for
the spring tides before making his supreme effort,
and was haunted by dread of a southerly arriving
before February 1, the date on which the springs
reach their highest mark ; for, if that
southerly came, it was good-bye to the
Thode Fagelund, and a southerly usually
does call in to greet the spring tides. The night
of January 31 was dirty, but on the morning of
February 1 a N.E. wind was piping half a gale,
with the tide rolling in and putting up records.
As the Thode rose on the swell its winches
strained on the two big anchors that had been laid
to seaward. Two powerful tugs were standing
by, but the sea was so heavy they thought it
better to stared out again. Then the father wave
of the gale rolled in, and, with the winches
straining, Spinks gave the engines a turn,
and the ship slid right off the rocks into
deep water, with its nose pointing just
clear of the reef. This was at 8 a.m., and
later on the notice board at the Exchange
announced among the arrivals “ Thode Fagelund,
10 a.m.” By Saturday afternoon the rescued
ship was in Mort’s Dock. Spinks was for some
years salvage adjuster for the Marine Under-
writers, but, though eminently successful, threw
up the work and went on his own keel. This is
his first save, and also his maiden attempt at
that kind of work, although he was master of the
rescuing steamer which discovered the Perthshire
and Monowai, when those two steamers were
drifting the high seas in a derelict state.
Died at Strathfield, Sydney, last week,
John J. Wood, a director of the Clyde Engineer-
ing Co., and for years its secretary ; and before
that secretary of Hudson Brothers. He was a
man of great ability who had the bad luck to be
connected for 40 years with manufactures in a
State that had the importing disease; and though
he read plenty about the bloated manufacturer,
all his battling didn’t keep him from becoming a
financial lightweight himself. “ Charley ” Wood,
the champion cyclist in the
days when all cyclists were
amateurs and all cycles
were “bone-shakers,”
is a son of his.
“HE MUST MEAN OWE-MEN!”
As time goes on we will have a race of sturdy yeomen. —
WADE.
Poor old Illingworth, who has been pulled
to pieces by a commission in Westralia, has had
some excitement these last 20 years. Up to that
time he was nothing more tempestuous than
a shire councillor up Bendigo way, in
Victoria. Then, pushing into the House of
Fat, he joined the ultra-Evangelical crowd that
was busy land-booming—the Balfours, Jameses,
etc. —and presently took a trip to Europe. The
smash came while he was on the way back, and
that is how he happened to stay in Westralia, and
presently become Treasurer. Also it was his
Evangelical connections that got parson Bird
mixed up with him.
WHEN DEAKIN GETS A SPINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is something maddening about the affability of
Alfred Deakin.—Bullktin(l9/12/’O7).
The prospect of Australia getting its rights seems very
poor unless Alfred can get rid of nine-tenths of his affa-
bility, and buy a spine with the proceeds.— lbid (26/12/’O7).
There’ll be trouble in this land,
And the State Frights will be banned,
And the prophets of Secession will be minced up very
fine ;
There will be a fearsome roar
Echoing from shore to shore,
And the landlord will go whirling down a very steep
incline ;
Philp and Evans, Moore and Wade
Down a high and painful grade
Will revolve like busted comets—their collective yelp and
whine
Will arise upon the day
When our Alfred casts away
All his meekness and his wobble, and goes out and buys
a Spine !
See the serpent and its trend—
Thus our Alfred seems to bend,
Back and forth beneath the burden of the shrill State
Frighter’s jaw ;
Something horrible to see
Is the affabilitee
Which is shown by gentle Alfred when the Wades orate
and claw !
What a blessed spectacle
Will it be when Alfred’s yell
Rings from Hobart unto Eucla and from Perth Co
Doodlekine;
From Australia’s heart a cheer
Will resound athwart the sphere—
“ Thank the gods ! our gentle Alfred’s gone at last and
bought a Spine ! ”
For this land a Leader needs
Who will break its Cooks and Reids—
Who will tread the Stinking Fishermen to dust beneath
his feet;
Someone strong, whose fist will fall
On the Bents and Wades a-squall—
Someone grim whose club will echo with a loud and
sudden beat!
Gentle Alfred, will you rise
With the war-lust in your eyes—
Bash our landlords with a bash that shall through all the
ages shine?
Will you make this land secure? —
Jump on Wade and Newton Moore—
Throw away your gentle habits —go and buy a blessed
Spine !
There is work here to be done,
But the man will need a gun
Who assaults the sacred portals where the bloated land-
lords laze ;
He will need to take a grip
Of the Public Bullock-Whip—
He will need to curse and yakker all his grim, perspiring
days !
Not with sugared words alone
Will he make the Frighters groan !
He will need to cave their skulls in with a fury half-
divine;
Alfred Deakin, rise and thud—-
Rise and be a man of blood.
Rise and use your earnest waddy—go and cultivate a
Spine !
What are words and meekness worth ?
Lo, the men who boss the earth,
They are prone to whirl the war-club and to pound with
blows severe ;
Alexander and the chaps
Who revised the ancient maps—
They were swift to seize the foeman by the large and
frequent ear !
Will you shed then, Alfred D.,
All your affability ?
Will you jump upon your foes as did the mighty Con-
stantine ?
Will you yell “ Australia First,”
Will you smite the crew accurst—
Lo, Australia reeks with traitors—will you go and buy
a Spine?
Is it fancy? Do we dream?
Shall we never hear the scream
Of the broken-up State Frighter being booted o’er the
land ;
Shall Australia never see
Hunks of affabilitee
Being stripped by Alfred Deakin from his aspect meek
and bland?
Oh, to see a Ruler rage,
Taking up the battle-gage,
Oh, to see a fighting Alfred lay for Wade with fierce
design !
In Australia’s sacred name
Play, oh, play the blessed game—
Hunt the gang that hates Australia—rush forthwith and
get a Spine 1
Yea, make trouble in this land
For the fat State-Frightful band—
let the prophets of Secession all be hacked up extra
fine ;
With a monstrous battle-roar,
Echoing from shore to shore,
Heave Australia’s useless landlord down a very steep
incline-,
Moore and Evans, Philp and Wade —
Bourn a steep and painful grade
Let them whirl like busted comets—let their uproar be
a sign
That our Alfred is no more
The old silver orator ;
That he’s sold his old politeness, and has gone and
bought a SPINE !

POLITICAL
POINTS
The stssatssinattidrl off the King and Crown
Princfe Of Portugal is a crime for which* of course*
there Oati be no apology. But it is not unfair to
reirtark that, in a measure, the chief Onhappy
victim brought his fate on himself. Recently he
changed the government of the country from a
representative system to a dictatorship, and auto-
crats must always expect assassination.
The municipal elections held throughout
Ma State on February 1 were the first under the
new Local Government Act. There were several
bungles and mishaps* about the most curious being
at Mittagong. Nine seats were to be filled* and
only 10 nominations were received* A week
before the poll one of the candidates was killed.
The Council Clerk reported this fact to head-
quarters, and asked if it was necessary to do any-
thing bht declare the remaining candidates re-
turned Unopposed. The State law authorities,
however, considered the matter hard* and resolved
that the election must go on, which it did with all
due pomp and ceremony. The dead man was
badly defeated*
ANOTHER would-be king.
It is an amazing thing that the head of the Ministry
(Bent) in a self-governing State of the Empire, should
suddenly go off on his own account to negotiate im-
portant compacts. —Daily Paper.
THE PEOPLE: “ Herel Drop that! I’m not
dead yet!”
When N.S.W. ex-Premier Carruthers
goes to England as Commissioner to the Shep-
herd’s Bush Exhibition, he will probably blow
a good deal about his policy of bursting
up big estates by paying the owners ab-
surdly high prices to get back land which the
said owners got from the State for just about
nothing. It is to be hoped that he won’t enlarge
on the fact that intending settlers will have to pay
these boom prices to the Government before they
can acquire a holding. Already 27 selectors on
the Marrar Estate, near Wagga, Joseph’s biggest
effort, have forfeited their blocks, which have
been gazetted for re-selection. Many of the
selectors have improved their places, but they
couldn’t keep up their instalments. Already the
Government is being pressed to waive the arrears
of principal and interest, so as to allow these un-
fortunates another chance, and there is talk of a
big indignation meeting. Which is perhaps
commendable, but imagine a public meeting pro-
testing when a Private Enterprise bank exercises
its right to foreclose !
Sydney Telegraph, in its frenzied op-
position to the national universal service defence
scheme, lies ridiculously. The fact that the
Government won’t try to enlist the man from
furthest Outback as yet —it wouldn’t be worth
while to scrape around the distant fringes of
settlement to bring in a few score men—is taken
as a sign of “ backing down ”on the scheme. On
the same line of argument the fact that The
Daily Telegraph doesn’t make special arrange-
ments to run its issue out to Pooncarie is a sign
that it’s giving up business as a daily paper. And
if there is no public school at Lake Nichebulka,
in the county of Barrona, that proves that the
N.S.W. State Government is backing down on
compulsory education.
Victorian Chief-Secretary Peacock is
Jilting to his own glorification how unbending
Was his virtue when an applicant for employ-
ment came to him, giving him a Masonic,sign :
I'hat fairly settled me. I listened to no more. “ You
See that door?” I said to my visitor. “Out you go!
Don’t you try that sort of thing on with me.” I suppose
tny tone must have been angry enough to show him I
Was in earnest. At any rate, he retired very quickly. It
is the first time that that kind of thing has been tried on
With me as a Minister, and I trust it will be the last.
Y-e-e-e-s. It’s a pity the man-with-the-laugh
hadn’t that “out-you-go” aspect about him when
the 1.0. F. person Called on him some years ago.
N.S.W. State Labor Political Conference
shelved Holman’s State Frights proposal to put
hobbles on the Federal power, and committed
itself to progressive Federalism by adopting this
clause iff the annual report of the Executive :
It is apparent that the authority which controls the
tariff should also control the conditions governing local
manufacture. With the Australian market open to manu-
facturers from every State, it is absurd that the manu-
facturer's-of some States should be subjected to restric-
tions as to wages and other conditions, which are absent
in other States. The only manner in which an approach
to equality of treatment Can be secured is to vest the
control of industrial legislation in the Commonwealth.
The BulDetin has received this letter :
Miss Rose Scott writes to say that the Duke of Welling-
ton’s case against conscription is to be found in the report
on military punishment of 1836, quoted by the War Office
in the memorandum on the Militia Ballot, and published
in 1875. She sent this information to the Daily Tele-
graph in her second letter. For years she has collected
books, pamphlets, etc., relating to war, conscription, etc.
And this paper replies briefly that it doesn’t
make any difference where the Duke of Welling-
ton’s views on “conscription” are to be found.
The point at issue was this : Miss Scott quoted
Wellington assaying that “in no instance has
the* system of raising men for the service of the
arfny by voluntary enlistment ever been de-
parted from.” (He was also quoted for many
years as having said, “ Up, Guards, and at ’em.”)
Miss Scott put this forward as a solid piece of
evidence against universal military training. And
the statement (whether it was made by, or
ascribed to, one duke, or 10 dukes) was so
glaringly, obviously, absurdly false that the use of
such material didn’t come under the heading of
fair argument.
Cecil Poole ” : Am just finishing a four
months’ visit to Manaro, not “Monaro” (it was
originally Maneroo). I know every part of
N.S. W., bar the fifty miles around Sydney. Have
known Manaro for fourteen years. Fo*r a
Federal site, Dalgety is almost
ideal. And not the least of
its advantages is its prox-
imity to the Kosciusko
country—an asset the
value of which Austra-
lians have not yet real-
ised. In this conti-
nent of plains, it is
unique. The Bul-
letin has already
stripped bare the
motives of the noisy
Sydney nobodies who
would decry
as the Federal capital.
Merely for informa-
tion, may I inquire
what qualification Wade
—a little-known lawyer
and fourth-rate politi-
cian—has as a judge of
caDital sites? Certainlv.
his acquaintance with Dal-
gety is of the slightest. What a ragged
rump of the old Cabbage-Tree Hat party are
he, Carruthers and one or two more ! A stately
capital will stand on the banks of the Snowy for
ages after Time has kindly dusted these specks off
the slate.
A growing institution is the Australian
Farm and Bush-Workers’ Union, and it hasn’t
arrived a day before it was needed. Its head-
quarters are at Albury (N.S.WJ, and from that
centre it is already reaching out in many direc-
tions. Its fighting platform goes into one plank,
and there are 22 words in the plank :
To obtain seven shillings per day for all farm and bush
workers for eight hours’ labor, and one shilling per hour
overtime.
That’s something like a plank. The union was
founded last November, and, by the middle of
January, 25 branches were in existence, and the
great natural industry which puts 3601 b. of wheat
in a bag has begun to realise that a new force has
arisen.
The employing class in Australia is doing
its little best to force on compulsory training.
Most of the 6th Australian regiment gave up its
holiday the other week in order to practise much-
needed practical training and manoeuvring on the
march. But there were some who didn’t attend
the muster, because “many of the men could not
obtain leave of absence from their employers over
the public holiday.” Like the employees of those
naval cadets who were similarly baulked at
Christmas, the boss not only won’t take up a gun
himself, but won’t put himself out to let anybody
else do so. The compulsory training policy will alter
that. The employer who interferes with that
first of our necessities—defence—will then find
himself in a place where he won’t care much
whether the country is defended or not. He will
be in it, and yet, in a sense, out of it.
The smugffling into the Commonwealth of
Chinese by means of traffic in exemption certifi-
cates (a Chinese who has lived in Australia five
years can leave the Commonwealth, and, if armed
with such a certificate, return at his pleasure) is
so great, and any sure means of stopping it seems
so hopeless, that Australia ought to take the bull
by the horns and abolish the exemption certificates
altogether. If a Chinese wants to leave the Com-
monwealth, give him a cordial adieu and don’t let
him in again.
WINNING IN A CANTER.
HE (Bent) believed Federation was started too soon. —Press Report.
THE STARTER FROM SCRATCH : “ Yah! Ain't 70 years enough start for yer ?”
The Vic. Board of Public Health recently
decided to prosecute a Melbourne shopkeeper who
falsely labelled certain goods as being “ made in
Australia.” He was just the same old importer,
trying to sell his goods by false pretences; but at
any rate it is good to see that the tide has turned.
A while back such a man would have sold Aus-
tralian goods labelled as “finest imported.”
Sydney is evidently determined to deprive
itself of a vegetable or fruit diet this summer if
there is the least suspicion that the edibles are
grown in the Cabbage Garden. Premier Wade’s
latest ukase is that no vegetables or fruit are to be
allowed to cross the Victorian border unless passed
by the N.S.W. inspector stationed in Melbourne ;
so that, apparently, if Jan Albury resident wants
a case of apples from, say, Wodonga, three miles
away, he must get the consignment carted to
Melbourne and back —about 500 miles. Ma can-
not even pretend that this foolishness is done to
protect herself, for the regulation doesn’t apply to
Queensland or S. Australia. And this announce-
ment was made almost before Premier Bent had
left N. S. Wales, after capering round the Beauti-
ful Harbor and amusing Ma with massive jokes
and telling her that she was his best and dearest
friend.
Perry, M.L.A., who is to be head of the
new N.S. W. Agricultural Department, has already
hatched an idea. The idea is to teach the
farmer to farm. Not alone by the agri-
cultural colleges, which he will increase,
nor by the experimental farms, which he
will enlarge, but by common sense
methods. Perry’s notion is to have a
staff of keen, practical men, not scientists
or theorists, but farming experts. These
are to attend the country shows, and to
discuss things in a conversational, homely
sort of way—not to lecture, but to be
amiable, and gently lead the cocky into
proper ways ; to teach him how to shoo
the pumpkin beetles, and how to cut his
corn; and generally, how to make three
turnips grow where the unaided clod
could only get two before. And for all
this trouble and expense, Perry proposes
to charge the farmer not so much as the
price of the extra turnip, only asking, in
return, that he will vote Anti-Sosh at the
next election. Irresistibly comes the re-
flection that if Perry’s Government was
asked to appoint State experts to teach
the woollen manufacturer, or the iron
manufacturer, or 'any other person strug-
gling to establish a permanent Australian
industry of lasting value to the Common-
wealth, Perry and his Government would
call the applicant a stark lunatic.
A South African correspondent
sends this cutting from the Natal Mer-
cury :
Australian Sugar.— ln future certificates are to be
demanded for all Australian sugar arriving at this port,
showing that it is NOT produced from cane grown by
WHITE LABOR IN THE COMMONWEALTH, failing which IT MUST
PAY AN ADDITIONAL DUTY OF 3s. PER 1001 b.
William Lyne has decided that he is no
longer going to totter along under the burden
of an empty Treasury while the State money-
chests overflow as a result of Federal economy
and good management. Up till now the
unexpended portion of the Commonwealth’s
fourth share of the tariff revenue has been
paid over to the States every month,
leaving the Commonwealth cash-drawer a yawning
emptiness. Last half-year the States, in addition
to their three-quarters share of the tariff money,
received back £327.093 of Federal money, while all
the time the Commonwealth had not enough loose
cash to buy itself a new hat. Lyne now intends
to give the States their accurate pound of flesh
and at the same time to let the Commonwealth
have a little flesh to go on with. It is necessary
to accumulate a trifle of money, seeing that there
are transcontinental railways and such like trifles
to build, and William wisely thinks of preparing
for the future.
Mr. Marks, of J. Lyons and Co., London,
a well-known commercial man in his city, sPeak-
mg at a Sydney dinner last week, referre to the
marked restoration of Australian eredi lecently
in England owing to so much Australian gold
being available to tide Bull over the crisis there,
He went on to advise that Australia should carry
jts Protectionist system into the dominion of
finance, and use up its loose cash to buy back its
own bonds and thus keep the interest in the
country.
“ The State Governors have been de-
scribed as a silken thread,” said Governor Talk-
bottle, defending his class at the Vic. A.N. A.
banquet. “ They are more than a silken thread,
they are a strand of wireless telegraphy.” A
strand of wireless telegraphy is absolutely nothing,
so his Ex. is not far out.
It is announced that certain representa-
tives of the makers of patent medicines are
coming here “to watch the progress of the Bill
dealing with the importation into Australia of
proprietary patent medicines and foods.” Con-
sidering what happened some years ago, when a
person was appointed to lobby in the interests of
the drink importers, and to ruin the chances of
local distillers; and considering again what
happened (it happened very suddenly, too) when
an agent came here to watch the interests of the
Standard Oil Trust, the Government might do
worse than make a list, so far as it can be done,
of the members who changed their views on those
previous occasions. It might also do worse than
have both them and the patent medicine agent
“shadowed.” Then, if certain members suddenly
change their views again, there may at least be
an ear at the keyhole to learn exactly why they
do it. With luck, the watcher may even get
his eye to the window in time to see the numbers
of the large notes supposing there are any
notes.
THE DEPARTURE.
Most of the Australian Bishops are off to London,
where they attend the Church Congress.
HIS LORDSHIP : “ Yes, off again, beloved. I'll
only be away 12 months; and my address is
Hotel Cecil, London. So au revoir.”
The N.S.W. Government proposes a little
cross-country railway from Moss Vale to Albion
Park to give easier access to a stretch of country
occupied almost wholly by tenant farmers. Of
course, rents will go up when the line is built;
they are up almost out of sight now even without
a railway. Then there will be an appeal for lower
railway rates because the farmers, owing to the
increased rents, are as badly off as they were
before the railway came. Then when they get
the reduced railway rates, rents will go up again.
It is a beautifully simple system, this skying of the
rent.

Max Beerbohm’s Essay. Some years afro
now, Mr. Max Beerbohm wrote a charming essay “In
defence of Cosmetics,” which (Mr. Beerbohm being
threatened with the reputation of a humorist) was not
taken seriously. That was a pity. Now, no reasonable
limit can be set to a woman’s right to be beautiful. The
woman who charms is the woman who makes the most of
herself and her natural endowment. Some things con-
demned by the crabbed few are wholesome accessories of
the toilet. Take, for instance, the Yalaze Face Powder,
2s. a box. If there was any bloom on the fruits in the
Garden of the Hesperides, this powder is as delicate as
that. Invisible itself, it makes beauty, visible. It is one
of the excellent light weapons in beauty’s armoury.
Another delightful weapon is the Valaze Rouge Tenace.
It is of a delicacy that defies detection : Is. 6d., Special 3s.

a vulgar chemical red, 25., and Special 3s. Of leading

If You Want to Hear the Truth about Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. They Built Him up
When Friends Said He Wasn’t Long for
This World.
If you want to hear the truth about Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and what
they will do for those who are run down, ask Mr.
Thos. McCoy, of 420 Cleveland Street, Sydney.
Mr. McCoy lias been making shoes for the past
thirty years for the people of Surry Hills, and
there is no better known man in the district.
“ I have no objection to anyone calling on me
about my case,” said Mr. McCoy to an inter-
viewer. “Some years ago owing to close atten-
tion to work I became greatly run down,” he
said. Mr. McCoy is a well-known man in Surry
Hills district, as he has been engaged in the
shoemaking business in his own establishment for
nearly thirty years. “ I had always been a strong,
robust man, but my strength seemed to desert me
suddenly. I seemed to have no energy and never
felt like work. When I left the shop in the
evening I could hardly drag myself home. My
appetite became very bad—the little I did eat I
forced myself to take. I began to look so bad
that friends often remarked ‘You are not long
for this world.’ I began to think the same myself.
My face had assumed the color of a duck’s foot.
When I was in this state I chanced to pick up a
pamphlet concerning Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
I l ead an account of a man whose illness seemed
to be just like mine. He said that Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills had cured him. I then made up my
mind to give them a trial, and at the end of a
week I felt that they were doing me good. I kept
on taking them, gaining strength and a better
appetite all the time—after taking about eight
boxes I felt well and strong.”
By steadily building up the wasted system with
good, new blood, and supplying fresh vital energy,
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People have
cured hundreds who could not regain their
strength after an acute illness ; also sufferers from
anaemia, rheumatism, sciatica, eczema, indiges-
tion, muscular weakness, neuralgia, St. Vitus’
dance, paralysis, and ladies’ ailments. Sold by
all medicine dealers, or sent direct by Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Sydney; 2s. 9d. a box, six boxes

SEMPER IDEM
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 4, 1908.
My Dear Arini,—
Mr. “Dick” Horsfall and Miss Ada Fosbery
were quietly married the other day, and there-
after left for England. Their devotion has been
a matter of years. It is said that in the dim past
the lady unwittingly offended the autocratic laird
of Widgiewa, who thereupon promptly forbade
the raising of the banns under pain of his eternal
displeasure. Perhaps the death of tylrs. Carring-
ton softened the parental heart; anyhow, lie
removed his veto shortly after, and now all is
happiness. “Dick” Horsfall is one of Sydnej r ’s
most popular clubmen, and Miss Fosbery (that
was) shares with Miss Clara Manning (that is)
the reputation of being almost the smartest female
dresser hereabouts.
One of the sights of the town these days is Mrs.
Philip Morton’s new motor-car. It resembles
nothing more than a diminutive hearse from
which the white plumes and velvet clothes and
suchlike graveyard apparel have been stripped, lest
the public should deem the vehicle smacked of
ostentation. Blackish this conveyance is, and
mysterious, and uncannily noiseless. It is designed
to hold about four cadavers inside, and, at a pinch,
would accommodate from two to three corpses on
the roof. It is capable of whisking its burden to
any normally situated cemetery at about 30 miles
an hour.
I was dissatisfied with my sex's “ Hymn to
Him” (8., “Red Page” 23/l/’08). Most of the
hymns were prehistoric in their viewpoint. They
preached the musty cant of psychology, the sort of
guff the more or less educated female turned down
with contempt years and years ago. Take the
winning hymn. Do any of us really, in these
civilised days, love or submit to a man just
because he is “maddeningly stupid and big,”
because he has an “ugly cropped head” and
clumsy hands and all the other horrid assets
that Jane Eyre and her contemporaries adored?
The man with clumsy hands has generally a
clumsy and blucher-booced mind to match, and
is irritating and pompous and tactless, and puts
both feet into things. The present-day female
has soared above her early Victorian sisters in the
matter of intelligence, and demands in conse-
quence from her “mate” something more than
the attributes of a navvy or- a carrier of wheat
bags. She has jettisoned the idea that her male
relatives are demigods. Only when she essays
poetry does she preserve the mendacious old
traditions. For purposes of praciical life she
buries the theory amusedly and absolutely. Hence
it is an awful shock to the normal young man of
thews and sinews when he arrives and attempts for
the first time to be strong and masterful in the
Home. As a shrinking little slave his new posses-
sion proves t& be a flagrant Gold Brick. She
doesn’t satisfy her hub’s masculine vanity an
atom. He delivers his ukase. He is disregarded.
Then he inserts the light of battle in his eye,
and displays the muscles of his forearm. The
argument is treated despitefully. He is asked to
reason on the point iff dispute and to show cause.
He moves dazedly towards a weighing machine, or
removes his hat to point in bewildered fashion to
the fact that he is curiously ugly and has a close
cropped head. But these circumstances, once so
appealing, cut no ice with his common-sense little
bride, who coldly adjudges them negligible
elements in a discussion broad-based on the
cardinal issue as to whether the family bull-pup
shall house in the drawing-room or not.
The pernicious doctrine of the estimableness
'and desirableness of the Strong Man induces a
crop of pathetic burlesques of the real article, and
their futile antics ruin the affection their women
kind would accord them were thev only original
enough to be their weak, lovable" selves. The
really masterful man is a rarity; when he does
occur, he is hardly ever a person with bulging
muscles and a prognathous jaw. He is the last to
want to appear masterful.
Here’s a chance for a moneyed Australian
pining for paragraphs and fame : Mrs. Melba is
anxious to sell her house in Great Cumberland
Place, London, where she has lived for the past
six or seven years. The house belonged to the
Hwfa Williamses, who spent a lot of money on it,
and when the Great Lark took possession the
whole show cost her some £30,000 in all. Melba
intends to buy a large country place about 20
miles from London, when she is no longer en-
cumbered with the Cumberland Place palace.
Miiss Ada Moseley s exhibition of paintings on
gauze hypnotised some hundreds of the long-
haired sex last week, when the oil floral show was
on view at the Women’s Liberal Club. Applied
to stage gowns, the art would be a bright success.
Afternoon tea-cloths, curtains, and other drapings
were shown, after the artist had considered the
lilies, roses, and trailing vine in cunning brush-
work, bhe claims that her work will wash, which
is a brave claim, as one would as soon think of
washing (in a Monday morning sense) a posy of
natural flowers.
We may see Mrs. Melba back in Sydney before
her return to Europe. She hinted as much to a
friend in Melbourne the other day. And it may
be that she will appear in grand opera here. It
all depends on whether arrangements can be made
for an orchestra. Possibly Slapoffski could say
something on the point if he wished.
The Slapoffskis have taken a house in Man-
ning-street, Double Bay, and the fair-sized family
all more or less musicianly, will have a melodious
time. Slap, had eight children when his pretty
little grey-eyed present mate took him
for better and no worse. By the second
alliance there is one lovely infant. Now
if only Mrs. S. had been a widow with
olive branches! She could work off the old
joke whenever the infants quarrelled. “ It’s only
yourchildren and my children fighting with our
children. Mrs. Slap, will start an operatic class
somewhat similar to the one she ran in Melbourne.
Male and female voices will be admitted She’s
got an astonishing repertory—sings 44 operas,
o
and in some of these she has done as many a.
three roles. Her warble ranges from C to top E
She got her first musical training at the Sacre
Coeur Convent, in London; then she joined the
Carl Rosa Opera Co., and left it to put in eighteen
months’ hard study under Manuel Garcia—the
wonderful old man who taught Marchesi, and
who died a year or so ago 102 years young.
Mrs. Slapoffski pleads heredity for her musical
yearnings. Miss Fanny Dyer, who afterwards
married Henry Haigh, a celebrated tenor of the
Sainton Dolby period, was her mother’s sister.
Haigh and his wife were the original English
Marguerite and Faust, when the opera was first
produced in England (at Liverpool). Shortly before
the late Queen’s death Mrs. Slapoffski sang
before the lady in a revival of old Italian operas,
of which school she was an admirer, such as “ The
Daughter of the Regiment,” “Fra Diavolo” and
“Carmen.” Queen Victoria /never tired of
“ Carmen,” and over “ The Barber of Seville ” she
would rock with laughter, no matter how often
she viewed the old thing.
Slapoffski, spite of his name and mane, is of
English birth. His mother was born in Sydney,
and was a daughter of Major Hunter, military
secretary of Governor Bourke. His father was a
Russian, and gave him the sneeze in his name.
A private letter from B. R. Wise, received last
week, stated that he was then in flourishing health
and was thinking of returning to Sydney very
shortly. Mrs. Wise will, however, remain in
England for the present.
Mrs. Sydney Trench, a daughter of Dr. J. C.
Cox, of Sydney, re-married quietly last month in
England, her second venture being Captain R. C.
Maclachlan, of the Rifle Brigade. Sydney
Trench, who was a son of Lord Ashton, died two
years ago. The girls of this family have a gift for
marrying into the British peerage, by the way.
Miss Millicent Cox married the present Earl of
Lindsay when he was Lord Bertie —a youth with
no claim whatever to fame barring a unique gift
for silence, the which was fractured only in his
case by an occasional loud and decisive “ haw ! ”
Whitmore Carr, who for years was the Adelaide
Register’s sporting man, “Tarquin,” and then
for some more years mixed sporting journalism
and stock-broking, married a widowed daughter
of brewer W. K. Simms a couple of years ago.
The lady died the other week, leaving “ Tarquin ”
£15,000 and a residence.
Noticeable that every self-respecting stationer
and print-seller in Sydney stars in his front win-
dow the Gibson drawing of the young woman play-
ing “footie” under the table. The work is
known to the ribald as “ Wallace Telegraphy.”
The wail of a girl who was once a “ Tweeny ”
herself :
Mary Ann has waited in the kitchen for many years
and trusted to Providence and the missus to improve her
lot, but the two authorities mentioned apparently haven’t
had any time to spare for the young lady downstairs, so
she has been left undisturbed amongst the beetles ever
since she was invented. Conditions have somewhat im-
proved for the domestic toiler during the last decade.
The sort of mistress who doesn’t feel comfortable unless
she knows there is a woman below stairs waiting, with
her weary head resting on the kitchen bellows, to answer
the bell at any hour of the night, has fortunately
become scarce. But she is not altogether suppressed,
and, here and there, the belief still exists that
Mary Ann is a sort of machine covered with rags, that
should do all the jobs that anybody can remember or
invent, and then rush down to the kitchen and sit on a
hard chair and stare into the empty grate until the bell
rings. Now she has tired of observing the pots, and the
ticking of the kitchen clock no longer charms her ear.
She has talked the matter over on her days out with her
sisters-in-brooins, and the Domestic Workers’ Union is an
accomplished fact—also a future snag- for the type of
woman who thinks that Mary, when not actively em-
ployed, should sit opposite the frying-pan and keep her
mind perfectly blank until she hears the usual iansrlino-
sound.
Paquin is no more. He died last month, aged
only 42. It is hard to say all that means to the
wealthy woman (from whatever part of the world
she hailed) whose ambition it was to dress per-
fectly. Paquin, as a dress expert, is said by those
who should know to have been as far above Worth
as Worth was above all others in his line. Paquin
regarded his as the greatest of arts. When the
French Chamber conferred on him the Legion of
Honor he took the thing as a matter of
course—though he was a Jew (where in art
will you not find a Jew on top?), Isidore Jacob by
name, and though the anti-Semite campaign was
raging in Paris at the time. Absolute simplicity,
combined with perfection of detail, was the
Paquin keynote. He refused to dress even the
highest of the haute demi-monde on no other
ground than that the garish taste of those ladies
and their wilfulness would lead them inevitably
to introduce alterations into his dress and color
schemes. The would-be client, no matter what her
rank, demeaned herself humbly in Paquin’s pres-
ence. It was his custom to place the
aspirant somewhere in the middle distance and
stand with half-closed eyes considering her—her
coloring, figure, hair, eyes, and the rest. Sud-
denly the inspiration came, and with the pas-
sionate intensity of some Italian improvisatore
the burning words flowed from him at lava heat—
those words which told the woman before him
what she must wear. Sometimes there was no
inspiration. Then the luckless female trailed
sadly away—and saved an immense quantity of
money. Paquin was an example of how the male
who takes to what is ordinarily a woman’s calling
achieves fame and wealth in the old civilisation
Joseph, the cook, was another. A first-class cou-
turier or chef in Paris will handle the income of a
British Prime Minister. And who shall say he
doesn't earn it ?
Once upon a time, when Melbourne was a city
of Dreadful Night through heat, a kind hotel-
keeper sent to a star actor, noted for his little dog
and big audiences, a bottle of champagne, some
crushed ice, and some biscuits. The relief of
Lucknow was as nothing to it. The goods reached
the artist at the wait after the third act, when,
like Sergeant Mulvaney, he was “ spittin’ chips.’’
Next night the hotelkeeper got a telephone mes-
sage, thanking him for the gift, and requesting
to have it duplicated. Every night for sixteen
nights he has sent, by request, the like relief to
the actor, and the actor is embarrassed by so much
generosity. Probably by now the gentleman who
is licensed to sell demented and furious liquors has
sent in his bill, and the actor knows of the jocaster
played on him. A third party has been ringing
up the hotelkeeper, and ordering the relief in a
forged voice. (N.B.—“ Jocaster ”is a joke that
is akin to disaster.)
Mr. Leslie Walford, that fashionable, cheerful-
Cherokee young Sydneysider, left by the Mace-
donia. So that he should start his voyage with a
head that nothing would fit but his umbrella, a
number of his friends gave him a dihhei at the
Australia, Also did they give him a menu case
in crocodile skin, with monogram in gold, and
containing views of Sydney Heads. This is the
funniest presentation I’ve ever struck. Hoes the
gentleman collect family menus ? Also what is a
menu case? Mr. Walford’s wife, who is a
daughter of Mr. Sam Hordern, has been in
Europe for some years.
Mr. Sam Hordern has also departed for as far
as Westralia. Miss See, a relation by marriage,
has endured a number of farewell teas previous to
her going earth-girdling. Dr. S. Knaggs left by
the Macedonia. Amongst the come-backs are Dr.
Mary Booth, a much-liked Sydney physicker.
The Ben Osbornes —what’s left of them, for
marriage is taking them off this continent —will
be here by the Mooltan in a week or two.
That farcical party, Little Tich, whose lack of
height and elongated fake boots are at the back of
his “fame,” was lately defendant in a civil action
with a theatrical agent. The agent had secured
him a fairly stiddy job. at £250 a week, and the
great Tich, whose name is Relph, regarded the
offer as a gross insult. He went off to South
Africa on a nine weeks’ tour at a salary of £5OO
a week, and scorned the widow’s mite offered to
him.
A wedding of interest in R.C. circles was that
of Mr. Wilfred Spruson, of Avondale (N.S.W.),
and Miss Annie Lonergan, of Mudgee. The
bride’s brother tied the knot. He had lately come
from over seas, and his sister’s bridal was his first
essay at marrying ; yet he did it with a steady
hand, and showed no sign of stage fright, and
didn’t fall over any of the hurdles, nor did his jib
carry away.
Mrs. (Ef\) Wunderlich leaves by the Britannia
early this month for Singapore to join her husband.
“Elamang, ” that fine old place at Kirribilli
Point, that has been in possession of the Milson
family for over 80 years, is now in the odor of
sanctity. The Loretto nuns have assumed it
(after much rebuilding), and on Sunday Cardinal
Moran and staff opened it with some ceremony
and circumstance, and a good deal of frill, pomp,
and dog. -
Nelson Illingworth is doing good work in
Maoriland. A bust of Mrs. Joe Ward and a bust
of Dick Stewart, of theatrical fame, are on show.
Also a study of “Lilith,” and of one of the oldest
Maori woman in the King country. The wahine
is said to be nearly 100 years of age.
Thus “ Mario,” from Brisbane :
Mrs. Chelmsford came down to town this week, and in
spite of the hot spell, that managing dame retains her
atmosphere of unruffled serenity. Her gdests, Mr. and
Miss Bridges, who arrived on the Orontes yesterday,
make light of our attempt at a heat wave after what they
have suffered in T. Bent’s city.
More engagements. Firstly, the post is—or ought to
be —full of congratulations to Mr. Stanley Chapman (New
Zealand Loan Co.), a son of one of the old Macleay River
squatters, formerly of Yarradindilli. He has captured
the heart of Miss Lucy Goggs, the tall brunette daughter
of the late Matthew Goggs, of Wolston. Miss Goggs is one
of those Australians who are going to save the country,
if it can be saved, by her straight-out common sense and
patriotism, and her fianc6 is a much-envied young man.
A second mutual agreement is that of Mr. John
Grant Thomson, of the railways, who weds one of our best
amateur vocalists, Miss Anius Berliner ; and Mr. Seymour
Tozer has entered into a matrimonial entanglement with
a lady whose name is Boyce.
In the blaze of a muggy afternoon the Brisbane Rowing
Club held a club regatta on Saturday, and because every
house was unbearably hot, all the girls in the dis-
trict flocked down to the big marquee on the river
enclosure, where a nice breeze tempered the heat, and
the excitement kept one from thinking of it. Pretty
music and iced drinks were on top the whole afternoon.
Down the river, great excitement was manifested in the
ladies’ race of the Brisbane Dinghy Club. The ladies per-
formed admirably. Miss Ida Bolt, in the Othello, carried
off first honors, beating Miss Ettie Crouch, in the Wara-
tah, by 43sec. Mrs. Charles Negus (who was third) was
only ]|min. away in the Volent.
The turmoil still continues at the Children’s Hospital,
where funerals are often frequent, so to speak. The
committee still maintains a rigid silence as to how the
Chelmsford fund is being expended, and the press is
firmly excluded from the business meetings. The public
(which contributed the cash) is evidently regarded with
suspicion, and is allowed no voice whatever in the spend-
ing. Meanwhile, the infant mortality goes on at a
terrible rate.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
A. G. Rosman tells the condensed tale
of a kiss :
I don’t think I ever realised how beautiful she was until
she raised her dear head for that first kiss. A wonderful
smile trembled upon her lips, and in her deep, cool eyes,
from which all mockery had passed, there was an elo-
quence that made me half afraid.
The bush seemed full of her. Beside the slip-rails a
ti-tree held up a bouquet of its first white blooms to her,
and the green shade was fragrant with her presence. Tall
gums carried word of her to the magpies nestling far
above, and they, weaving the word into a melody, have
been trilling it ever since.
She was in white, with a scarf all silver-veined, through
which the fortunate winds might kiss her tender flesh.
But not content with this, a vagrant breeze had pulled
back the silver ends of it behind her, so that she looked
like some winged spirit of the bush.
Spirit? Ah! no. It was warm human blood that
tinged her cheeks with such exquisite color, and the
marvel of her eyes was the marvel of her girl’s soul, and
no spirit radiance. It was a token of wonderful surren-
der, as, brilliant and unafraid, she kissed the other fellow.
Rev. Gladstone, of Nathalia (Vic.), who
was recently requested by Bishop Armstrong to
resign his charge on the ground that he (Glad-
stone) hadn’t the knack of attracting people in
“ leading positions,” waded in on a recent Sunday
evening and heaped scorn on his more or less
reverend superior. In the course of an address
that fizzed like beer poured on a hot shovel, Glad-
stone said that the reason why he had often
preached to empty seats was that the impenitent
sinners, dancers, drink traffickers, etc., had been
“ scorched ” out of the church. Word would be
passed round after he left that there was
no fanatic on the premises now to condemn sin,
and the Sabbath-breaker, drunkard, dancer, pub-
lican and drink-seller would all flock back to the
tabernacle. That is probably the highest Bishop
Armstrong has ever been hoisted. He should be
a very breathless and concussed ecclesiastic when
he comes down again.
Some people earl take a holiday Without
turning it into a riot. 'Jfiiiis a feW Scote ktei-
boutne sightseers spent theit rCtehfc AiiriiVetSart
Day sitting on the edge of a Yarra Wharf hatch-
ing two divers trying to refcoVet a boil'et Which
had dropped into the river Wh'eh keihg landed
from the MaheriO-, They Were Still trying when
darkness felt, so the watchers gathered up their
lilneh-baskets and went home. Even Judkins
eould scarcely object to that as soulless dissipation.
Looking at a boiler is a simple, harmless recrea-
tion, and to sit all day hoping to see a boiler is
harmlessness carried to excess.
Melbourne got some further light lately
on the ways of “charity” as practised by
Private Enterprise, when a worn, weary-look-
ing woman explained how she ran an alleged
Welcome-all Relief Mission and Soup Kitchen
down at “ the Port.” The Mission had poured
out soup, etc., on as many as seven boys and a
man at one time ; but as it appeared to maintain
the woman herself, her grown-up son and a
lusty male cook, it looked as if the managers
of the Mission were getting most of the relief.
Anyhow, though the beak discharged the weary-
looking woman, he viewed her with the cold eye
of suspicion, and advised her not to do it again.
“Araemo”: The case of Lloyd Barnes
and theNarrabri (N.S.W.) J.P. (B. 16/l/’08) brings
to mind a case which occurred in a Victorian
country town about ten years ago. The Mayor’s
son was charged before a police magistrate and
two .Js. P. with getting drunk and breaking a win-
dow. The riotous youth attended court with
money in his purse and pleaded guilty. In spite
of this the two Js.P. insisted on dismissing the
case. The P.M. dissented, but was over-ruled.
For once the Vic. Government rose to the
occasion, and two Js.P. were east into the outer
darkness of private life, where, like Belisarius,
they mourned over their vanished greatness.
There are different ways of “ dealing with ”
the wife-heater, though nothing seems to surpass
the plan of shutting him in gaol for a space, and
making him earn enough to keep himself in bread
and water, and the walloped wife and kiddies in
bread and butter. P.-M. Cresswell, of Melbourne,
improved on the old plan slightly, the other day,
when he sent an offender to gaol for a week, with
three days’ solitary, and handed the wife 10s. from
the poor-box. But half-a-sovereign isn’t much for
a whole week, and the husband will probably
lose his billet, anyhow. The Chicago method
also has points, though some of them
are pretty blunt ones. A citizen, with
three previous convictions for wife-heating, was
lately “shot in” a fourth time, whereupon the
inferior sample of Law got tired, and sent him for
trial before a more expensive brand, and Supreme
Court Justice Dowling handed him five years’
hard labor, with a £lOOO-dollar fine for dessert.
If he can’t pay the fine he will work it out in gaol,
after the five years, at the rate of a dollar a day.
The drawback about this plan is that the grass-
widow has to earn a crust for herself and the
orphans in the meantime ; but as the wife-heater’s
wife generally has to do that anyhow'—she had in
this case—she is no worse off financially than be-
fore, and she is better off in the way of bruises.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 3, 1908.
My Dear Yakhie,—
The Portugal Queen-lady is a clever woman.
She is the only royal lady in Europe who is a
qualified doctor. Mrs. Carlos Braganza is said to
have studied therapeutics in order that she might
personally combat the awful and growing stout-
ness of her regal spouse. He had a little
way of promptly dismissing a Court physician if
he presumed to restrict his jolly old diet.
Rumor says there were great domestic ructions
when she made rules about her lord s feed-
ing. He did not go off to his club, like an
ordinary citizen, but always went to visit
people who would be sure to have large banquets
in his honor. But Don Carlos was not merely
an eating animal. He was a clever artist,
both with pen and brush, and was keen on
sculpture-. Sculptor Rodin was one of his
divinities. He also had literary gifts. He
translated Sliakspeare for the enrichment of the
literature archives of his country, and wrote a
work of deep research, dealing with deep-sea
investigation round his coasts. Which means a
lot of work when one is carrying on the business
of King—especially in such a place as wobbly
Portugal has been lately.
Nash, the mysterious, still causes trouble
in Melbourne—albeit indirectly. Mercer, the
cleric who has shepherded the St. Columb s
flock ever since Nash went to Geelong, is now the
storm-centre. Metcer is suspected by the
Gnashites (who are many and violent) of luke-
warm th in the cause of their assailed idol. At
the annual meeting, the other day, when the
church-officers were to he elected, the Nash
sympathisers got on to the tracks of three of
Mercer’s friends, Westiey, Hooke and Bradshaw
—spineless neutrals in the -Nash matter—and
humped them out of every office, althoughall three
have held church billets for years and years. The
bumping in question might have appeased the
mob, but Mercer kindled fresh fire by exercising
his right as incumbent to appoint the three as
vestrymen. Now the church push is going to play
Gehenna, and the ladies are saying “ bother ” (and
woree), and things otherwise are simmering
heatedly.
The dear Fijians—how grateful we should be
to Lieutenant Marsden for bringing them here in
this vacuous season, when there’s never a beauty
actor, nor a divorce case, nor a scandal of any sort
to absorb the attention of Miss Innocence, or her
closest chum, Mrs. Gaydame. And the Lieu-
tenant’s benevolence has been richly rewarded in
the matter of gate-money at the Fijian matches.
And the colored persons themselves enjoy much
adulation. It is edifying to observe how the
frilly couple adore at the shrine of the copper
cusses. “They are delightful. So picturesque,
and so manly ! ” At the matches the pink and
white brigade become quite frenzied if the nimble
heathens are bowled out, or any other sporting
misadventure dashes their prowess.
And in the streets, when kind Mr. Marsden
sallies forth with his leading man, Ratu. beside
him, and the village peeler and the other nine
copper idols with fuzzy heads, bringing up the
rear, everyone stands to gape. The team is
inundated with invitations to “have a drink” on
its itinerary, and a thousand girls gasp, “The
Prince stared at me !” What more could savages
desire, I’d like to know. A nice illustration of
the cultured Fijian mind is offered by the outward
appearance of one of them when he presents him-
self to the world in a rakish tweed cap and a
smart Chesterfield coat, from which protrude a
pur of brown primeval shanks and two unshod
simian feet. But the local ladies note little more
than the beautiful fuzzy hair of the Fijians and
the sombre, strange eyes of them. By the way,
these Fijians are descended from truculent
cannibals who were squelched within the
memory of middle-aged men now living. The
taste for raw human probably lingers in them.
I shouldn’t advise any of the fascinated innocents
to let their Fijian worship go to the point of
kissing. The scions of the cannibals might bite.
Dorothy Frances McCrae Perry plays a pretty
part very sweetly these days. Down in the un-
beautiful region of her husband’s spiritual stock-
yard shq engages her flowery mind in tending
more arid ones. Garmented very gracefully, the
little dame perambulates through mean streets
burdened with edible dainties and edifying ad vice,
which are to sustain the gcats (isn’t that the
clerical denomination of the wipked and weak ?)
and make them think of becoming sheep. And
she’s the most welcome of spring-showers in the
parched district.
Incidentally, a nice brother of Rhymster Hugh
and dainty Mistress Dorothy is on the point of
endowing a charming sister of Enid Derham,
8.A., with his worldly goods, chattels and effects,
and the reflected glory of the family’s verse !
Our last aristocratic visitor received his fullest
measure of appreciation from the policeman who
took him to “the Farm” for a summer holiday.
But beside “Sir John Marwick,” we’ve had two
real lordlings here of late. Both youngsters man-
aged to escape Sassiety’s attentions to some extent.
One who knows says that during last year no less
than five titles ate their chops incognito at our
smartest pub. The superior persons had all
sampled much adulation before they reached Mel-
bourne. They found it so indigestible that by the
time they reached us they’d dispensed with their
best claim on our consideration, and walked the
earth unbranded and in peace.
Our Melba is a wise and practical angel of song.
She has been buying a huge collection of Austra-
lian furs and gems. Platypus rugs—real beauties—
jfpoßsum, Tasmanian squirrel, ’roo rugs, all have
/been added to her travelling kit. A belt buckle,
(and buttons of native gold and baroque pearls,
made here, are other enviable items. And she’s
had fine opals wrought into wearable phantasies ;
and peridots, and tourmalines, and rainbow-
tinted sapphires, and exquisite aquamarines make
tip a unique treasure-casket. “ They’re for pre-
sents,” smiles the Voice; “I’ll show my chums
all over the world that we grow jewels here, and
know how to set ’em. And the furs, too —they’re
capitally made, and splendid skins. We’ll show
them ! ”
Said that Melba promised her sonny she’d buy
Ercildoun for him out of her concert profits.
The estate will probably be put in his stocking for
Easter. The youth and his girl wife are quite
anxious to settle in Australia, and sonny says he 11
stay out here even —a big breath —if he has to
work !
Mr. Edmund Fisher, chief Melb. representative
of The Bulletin, who left on a trip to the Cold
Country on Tuesday last, in search of a well-
earned rest, received a gentle shove-off prior to
his departure. A few old pals put their heads
together and presented him with a handsome
wallet suitably engraved and containing an unde-
niable introduction to the Bank of England.
Carew Reynell made the presentation with a con-
siderable flow of language, and referred to Fisher’s
ability as a journalist and the esteem in which he
was held. Fred Norton spoke to similar effect,
and Randolph Bedford broke up the house with
some histrionic stories, which had no special
reference to the case, but which prevented gloom
falling like a collapsed tent on the proceedings.
A statement to the effect that Fisher was a jolly
good fellow was made at the close of the proceed-
ings. It was unanimous as well as loud.
Our T. Bent has invited the Victorian State-
school teachers to collect exhibits for the Shep-
herd’s Bush exhibition, in the shape of nice hand-
writing, pretty pink maps and capable bits of
herring-bone stitching, also darning and Sloyd
work. And Weedon, Boyd and Davis are to go
to England, regardless of expense, to draw atten-
tion to these splendid products. The fact that
Yic. school-children can write, and even draw
maps and knit, will be news to the effete old Ma-
Land, and is bound to do heaps of good all round.
The scratching of politicians and medicos about
the new hospital site continues. Discussion flaps
to and fro between the Guv’ment House cow-
paddock and the squealy Pig Market. If they
take the Government reserve away from the
cows a beautiful prospective park is lost. With
the promised demolition of the ugly old Immi-
grants’ Home at its base, that cow-paddock was
to be turned into a park. Very practical objec-
tors point to the presence of two large hospitals
(the Alfred and the Homoeopathic) within a
stone’s throw, and to the site’s inaccessi-
bility. The majority of Melbourne Hospital
patients are city accident cases. Patients from the
city (if the Guv’ment House cow-paddock site
is decided on) must trundle over Prince’s
Bridge, across areas of congested traffic. The
Pig Market site, on the other hand, has the same
city-fringe position in exactly the opposite direc-
tion, but with the good clear run of the broad
Sydney-road for a highway. It has plenty of
fresh air into the bargain (for a city site), and
some greenery round and about. *
Old battlers who have explored the lonely in-
terior of this continent are looking for the next
exploring party to start out in hansom cabs, with
rubber tyres and a goodly hamper under the seat
—as a natural evolution from the last Govern-
ment exploration. Agricultural Engineer Ken-
yon and his minions started on a perilous venture
over the wild wastes of Ninety Mile. They were
to explore the country beyond the “Cow Plains”
and the “ Pine Plains,” between Nhill (Victoria)
and Pinnaroo (S.A. border). Instead of riding-
horses, with an additional pack-horse for tucker,
the valiant explorers indulged in an imposing
outfit of waggons and tents, all to be
dragged through the awful sand of the Mallee.
After days and days the party failed to turn up
at Pinnaroo. It was Lost. Lost in the Ninety
Miles waste ! How the party managed to get
clear of the farms long enough to lose itself
is a mystery. For miles beyond Nhill there
is a thick settlement, and Pinnaroo boasts a
long fringe of out-farmers. A rescue party
started out (when an awful twenty minutes had
passed after the explorers were due), and dis-
covered the Brave Ones stuck in the sand and
hard at work eating their gorgeous tucker.
News comes that Miss Jean Creighton, of
Strathalbyn (S. A.), intends to annex, for better or
worse, our only doctor Kydd. He is “Resident”
of Adelaide Hospital, but was for years a popular
doctor of the Melbourne Hospital—an acknow-
ledged authority on cardiac disturbances. Now
be is the blessed victim of a cardiac disturbance.
May it disturb him long and happily !
On Thursday, the Gaud Mayor and many coun-
cillors unveiled a statue to Fitzgibbon. The
bronze figure, in wig and gown, holds a scroll, and
stretches one arm towards the city, and incident-
ally over the beauties of Alexandra-avenue and its
shrubberies. “Mine,” says the pointing finger.
“Fitz” was the great fighter for the reserves and
city parks—the “ lungs of the city.” The reserves
have been constantly nibbled away for public
buildings and such things. But for Fitzgibbon’s
fighting and championship, many of the present
grounds would have gone.
At the unveiling of the E. G. Fitzgibbon
statue Gaud Mayor Weedon remarked that the
erection was “absolutely paid for.” The figure is
of Australian material and workmanship. Janies
White, the sculptor who sculped the Queen Vic-
toria stone, is responsible for this. The figure of
bronze, 9ft. high, stands on a 12ft. pedestal of
Harcourt granite.
The Hope hopefuls, of Melbourne (nieces of the
late old identity Dean O’Hea), are realising hopes
as to their fair selves. Rita, a brilliant pianist, who
went Fogward for study, has got well into the
“swim,” and hobnobs with Duchesses and such
glittering bubbles on the stream of life. One of
the sisters (Kathleen) left at home has applied her
brains to science, and is among the few girls to
oust the conservative man apothecary. Miss
Hope lias just been made Dispenser to the Queen
Victoria Hospital, Melbourne.
Simmering, summering Lorneites trail up to
town with eyes bulging with excitement and
tales of mighty heroism. It’s not often
the placidity of summer picnickers gets
so excellently routed. Bush fires drove Percy
and Evelyn and other fern wanderers into
the very arms of the Phantom Palls ; they pre-
ferred a watery grave rather than ascent by fiery
chariot. There were soul-stirring gallops of res-
cuing relatives. Also incidentally there was a
wreck on the beach —on Lome s front doorstep, so
to speak, with the bowsprit poking in at Lome’s
bedroom window, in a manner of speaking.
“ Wish I belonged to the Cool’s house party,”
moaned a visiting, summering St. Hilda maiden.
It seems this house-party had a most giddy attack
of mixed bathing—with -no da-nger of sharks to
upset the charming nightly episode. The Men’s
Baths close firmly at ten. This House Party
annexed one of them —the whole show—at eleven
o’clock each singed night, and had a cool, mixed,
un-Judkinsesque splash in its shelter. Then the
gilded, gay crowd had its several motors to tote it
home in airiness of kimona and pyjama. The
discretion of an up-to-date Chauff is something to
marvel at.
I’ve seen the Marquise de Pompadour. She was
at the theatre on Saturday night. As she appears
in 1908, she’s heavy and gorgeous, and cruel of
mouth, and redolent of a pungent, disquieting
perfume. I sat quite close to her, and stared.
She had fair, soft hair, piled very high over a
tall, round brow—a brow like a smooth white
pillar carrying a cupola. There was neither soul
nor sentiment seated there; only beauty and
depravity. Her nose was short and insolent, and
her mouth had the outline of a baby’s, but it was
close-shut and artificially colored. She had large,
round eyes, very blue, very clear, and very
hard. And her throat and shoulders were a
symphony of shape and shading; the column’s
whiteness, tinted with faintest pink near
the chin, sank into a morbid purity on
her firm sloping shoulders. Her gown of, say,
yellow and green, slipped away from these
delights, with a ravishing air of accidental revela-
tion which her steady gaze belied. In one dia-
monded hand stie waved a fan. Perhaps it was
fashioned by Van Loo! On her wrist she bore a
sun-burst of jewels. I looked for her Louis
Seize. He sat by her side, proud of his proprietor-
ship, over-awed and shadowed by his possession.
She was taciturn, serene, and arrogant—until the
second interval. Then the pair went to the
foyer and had three brandy-sodas in succession,
and she began to thaw. And I heard the Mar-
quise : “ Why in the nime of don’t they ice
the drinks ’ere ?”
Nurse Shappere, who presided over the Fever
Hospital for a time, will shortly add to her know-
ledge of medicine. She weds Dr. Niall within
this year.
The professorial Sugdens have been a-ruralising
down at Flinders, helped in the hot process by
relays of artistic people. The family centred a
good deal of interest round itself. It had its
orchestral array of instruments, and Hjalmer
Josephi with them. So each night the village
assembled at the gate, to listen to Mozart’s
melodies, and watch Mr. Josephi massacring
tarantulas in the-gloaming. Townies found novel
pleasure in watching the brawny Prof, paddling
through the waves, ahead of his ducklings,
like a monstrous good-humored drake. It’s a sort
of consolation to the-sinful—the sight of sancti-
moniousness in a scrappy bathing gown !
Brave Dr. “Billy” Maloney whizzed away to
Queensland, on Saturday, to take a hand in that
State’s elections. The popular little Doctor never
neglects an opportunity to do battle for his prin-
ciples or his party. As one of his narrowest-
minded Orange electors commented on his
enthusiasm : “Our Doctor’s Irish enough to be
delightful, not Irish enough to be damned.”
The Tichborne Baronet arrives'by the Mooltan
to view the country where the Claimant sprang
from.
Mrs. Ernest Brook is at' present offering an
object-lesson in frockery to the islanders over the
Straits, Her chum, Mrs. Howard, is in the same
neighborhood.
King’s Counsel Gordon, of Sydney, and his
songstress passed through this vale of moist heat
last week, and were fSted by their friends.
Madame Margaret gained some sturdy admirers
here, who never fail to inundate her with hospi-
tality.
Miss Leslie Madden is whirling through a pro-
cess of wardrobe filling. Cute folk notice the
ship-hoard cut of her new possessions, and deduce
from that an imminent sea voyage. Following
that conclusion, they conjecture a wedding in'
London, and a happy life ever after for the
nice girl and a handsome Hungarian groom.
A half-filled house greeted “ The Red Lamp’s”
first illumination, yet Beatrice Day’s three even-
ing frocks would have justified an auditorium
crowded with dressmakers. In one act she wears
a gown of frost white appliqued with ivy leaves.
Then she adorns her beauty with an Elizabethan
sort of robe in cream and fainting heliotrope.
Lastly, she wears a Parisian modiste’s idea
of Night as seen in the tropics—a ravishing
mixture of blue-black chenille and silver
stars. A less-important lady wears an Empire
gown in passionate pinky crepe and fine lace. In
the audience, Mrs. Monashy with a filet of flowers
and a white frock, looked like Cleopatra’s taller
sister; and Mrs. B. Allen wore a shell of gold
broideries and green beetle-backs. And the two
Miss Menzies were sandwiched between their
ultra-smart confectioned sister-in-law Dorothy
Yane, in a voiled white gown and blue head-
fixings.
From “ Rosna ” in Adelaide
The A.R.C. brcke into a meeting at Victoria Park, last
week, to celebrate the anniversary of the day when
Edward VII. first wore the auriferous decoration around
the royal cranium of England. The elements might have
been worse, the heat wave having run across to take a
look at the Eastern States ; but only a small proportion
of the aristocracy got out of its hollanoT wrappings to
provide the frills and glories, without which the most
imposing day is a battered cavity and of no account.
Mrs. Arthur Rymill was a very chic vision in cool blue
and white chiffon voile, plenteously bestrewn with Valen-
ciennes lace. She was a blue-and-white millinery dream.
Mrs. Fred Scarfe wore a smart grey garment with touches
of pink about it, and a pink and heliotrope rose hat. Mrs.
S. J. Jacobs, just back from Britain and Africa, sported
a striking gown of navy and white silk, much inserted
with cream' lace, and a green hat witli purple wings.
Mrs. Jule Wendt had inserted herself in a gorgeous creani
doth frock and picture hat.
Twenty-four braw Bulgarians were landed here t’other
week, without a w’ord of English among ’em, and they
dropped their luggage and sat in a sad row, while various
frthzied authorities dashed over the country trying to
unearth someone who knew their language. In the end
an Italian and a Russian were captured to act as
interpreters and take the strangers under their protective
wings. It transpires that these aliens come to Australia
because they’re tired of the murder and sudden death
lurking about their own country ; and they want to get
work farmjng or wood-cutting, in which" arts they are
champion^,', They have no opinions to offer about the
ancient or modern politics of their country. When asked
whether they thought Alexius Comnenus w'as well
advised or not when he raised the Sebastocrator, and
possibly the Protospathaire, above the rank of the Caesar,
they were wholly silent. They declined to express any
views on the wharf about the politics of the emperors Con-
stantine Pogonatus, or Michael Rhangabe, or Michael the
Stammerer, or Constantine Porphyrogenitus, or Romanus
Lecapenus, or Romanus Argyrus. A suggestion that a
half-column interview as to the general opinion of Bui-
garia about Michael Stratioticus would go well, failed to
rouse them from their lethargy ; they simply wanted to go
tree-felling. And they flatly declined to take any interest
whatever in Constantine Monomaehus. They are a dull
herd.
Quite a throng of local churches, charities, and other
societies are to benefit by the will of the late 6. W.
Hawkes. Our little pet cathedral and St. Barnabas
Theological College top the list with £lOOO each ; £250
goes to St. Peter’s College for an annual catechism prize ;
'the Clergy Widows and Orphans and the Clergy Annuity
Funds each get £200; and every orphanage, home,
refuge, etc., receives either £5O or £lOO. Another £s(j
goes to the Aborigines’ Friends’ Association.
Mr. Harry Dutton and his motor are home from trying
to pierce the interior, having wearied of leaping sand-hills.
They travelled 1300 miles, at an average speed of llj
miles an hour, and received civil treatment everywhere,
except at the hands of the flies, which spoke to them dis-
courteously with their feet. The motor behaved with
uniform decorum, and didn’t protest at the track north
of Oodnadatta, which was three-fifths sand and the rest,
stone. It didn’t even catch a puncture ; in fact, it proved
a boshter motor.
Amy Sherwin didn’t drop in on the Tram-State on her
way to Britain after all, but we really and truly are to
take Blanche Arral into our fond embrace again. That
jolly little nightingale has proved horribly elusive of late,
and has worked us up to a pitch of expectation about
eight times, only' to fl.v off at a tangent or something at
the last minute. But now Manager Howells has her
booked for February 8 and 10, and if we don’t get her
there will be swear words, and much tearing of hair and
characters. Adelaide doesn’t entertain stray Countesses
in disguise every' day.
Glenelg, that village of strenuous amusements, had an
amateur swimming carnival t’other Saturday, and ail
the Tone and semi-Tone turned out for it, and sat round
the baths in a frocky row. It would have been as dull as
such things usually’ are, but for the thoughtful inter-
ference of Messrs. Charlie Hayward, Tom Russell and
Scammell,whoenacted aridiculous farce on a specially-coh-
structed and very perilous-looking stage, erected ihsueha
position thatthe actors could be frequently hurled into the
water. The thing was called “ The Barber’s Shop,” and
each actor was more weird as to costume than the other.
Mr. Hayward and Mr. Russell were the barbers, and they
watered every “ client” with a garden hose and sent him
flying to the bottom of the sea. It’s wonderful how satis-
fying the crowd found this intellectual amusement.
Dr. Richards, our little Chief Justice’s nice associate,
has been made assistant Crown solicitor and Parlia-
mentary draughtsman. He’s a South Australian (though
he chased his legal laurels through London ’Varsity), and
caught his LL.D. in his very early youth. He is still
under forty.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
The Maoriland Government’s Parlia-
mentary humpy was burned down a couple of
months ago, and many kindly offers have been
made to accommodate the Legislature next session.
The most affable of these was made to the'Pretaier
himself a few days ago, when his train halted at
Seacliff station —ISeacliff Mental Asylum is just
beyond. A patient, who is not too mad, is
allowed to stroll around, and even to go down to the
station when the train arrives. He formed a
deputation of himself, and called upon Joseph as
the latter dictated telegrams in his reserved
carriage. His proposal was that, as the Parlia-
mentary buildings were no more, the coming
session should be held in ISeacliff Asylum.
“There’s plenty of room for you all, and I’m sure
you’d be very comfortable,’’ he ended up genially.
Joseph, who is nothing if not courteous, and who
couldn’t be rude if he tried even to an unregistered
dog, thanked the solitary deputationist and
promised solemnly to consider the suggestion and
place it before “my Government.” The ISeacliff
boarder went away as proud as a brass god with
two pairs of tan boots, and is waiting de-
velopments.

ETHOUGH not gene-
rally known, it is never-
theless a fact that the
real wonderland of Aus-
tralia is Westralia. To
the average Easterner
Westralia is a place were men toil in heat
and dust, surrounded by flies, for gold for Eng-
lish companies; and that outside the Golden
Mile is nothing but a weary desolation of mulga
and sand. Never was a country so horribly libelled.
For historic interest, for cave wonders, for climate,
for good cheap land on which to settle and make a
home, Westralia is far ahead of the Eastern States.
A well-known Australian traveller who had travelled
round and over the continent once declared that Perth
in summer was “ Melbourne without its dust, Sydney
without its mugginess, and Brisbane without
its sweltering heat.” And anyone who has
read of the experiences of early visitors to
the Goldfields in the Eastern papers will remember
that one and all spoke with enthusiasm of its dry,
bracing air that was better than a tonic, and almost
as good as the oldest whisky. . It is a climate that
makes those who live in it energetic. So much for
the climate. Compared to the coastline of Westralia,
N.S.W. and Tasmania are young upstarts in a his-
torical sense. As far back as 1600 A.D. Dutch ships
were entering the Swan River, and an old map at
Amsterdam, dating back to 1694, gives a fairly
accurate map of the entrance of the Swan. It is only
the presence of a lion on the sand, and a crowd of
aborigines mounted on white horses, that suggests
that the Mynheer who drew it did not venture far
inland. But he certainly did explore the Swan
as far as Perth Water. It was somewhere up the
north-west coast of Westralia that a Dutch squadron
mutinied and, landing, established the Republic of
Australia. Had it been let alone, it might
have changed history, but it was not. The
Batavian Government fitted out a squadron
of vengeance, and the Republic of Aus-
tralia vanished in smoke and blood.
To the young man
who is anxious
to go on the
land, Wes-
tralia is the
ideal place,
Recognising
that a min-
ing popula-
tion is the
sort of na-
tional wealth
that takes
unto itself the wings of the morning, the Westra-
lian Government is taking opportunity by the
front hair, and rapidly building up an agricultural
population by practically giving away the land and
supplying facilities to make a living out of it. The
great mining cities have made a home market, and
for the man who wishes to deal in the British chaffer-
ing places, it is worth while remembering that Fre-
mantle is 2500 miles nearer London than Sydney.
Coolgardie and Kalgoorli are oft-told tales, and
there is no room for them here. They are the best-
known things of Westralia. What is not generally
known is that, to the man in search of scenery or
health, Westralia can supply both. Perth itself is a
charming city, and just where it abuts on to the
Swan River the stream widens out into a lake which
is known as Perth Water, and is a miniature Port
Jackson. The city has one of the best theatres in
Australia, is rich with parks and reserves, and very
conveniently linked up with its suburbs by an
excellent electric-tram service. Having done Perth,
and gaped in wonder at the gigantic harbor
works of Fremantle, where an Australian
engineer named O’Connor did what the eminent Eng-
lish engineer, Sir John Coode, said was impossible, the
tourist hies him to the country to find that West'
ralia, and not China, is the flowery land. No other
country in the world grows wild flowers like West-
ralia, where roads wind for scores of miles through
land glittering with a hundred varieties of beautiful
immortelles. At Busselton, 150 miles from Perth,
he alights to take the coach for Yalling—up on the
south-west coast. The coach takes him to the Cave
House, which is close to the beach, and from which
visits to the caves may be varied by fishing, boat-
ing, bathing, and shooting. The Cave district ex-
tends over a ti-act of country some 80 miles long,
and in which fresh caves are being constantly dis-
covered. At present, the most accessible are the
Yallingup, which were only discovered in 1900 by
two young men looking for strayed horses, and the
entrance to which is only a few yards from the Cave
House. The Government has laid on electric lights,
cut steps, and supplied hand railings where it could
be done without interfering with the sights. The
first excavation is known as “The Theatre,” being
shaped like a Roman amphitheatre, in which the
places of the mummers are taken by stagnates and
stalactites, which wear fantastic shapes, and bristle
with weird suggestions. One vast pendulous mass
that hangs by a line of glittering points that scin-
tillate like a rope of diamonds in the electric light is
named theEgyptianMummy. Further on, the “Bridal
Veil” looks like what it is called after suddenly
frozen hard as some puff of wind has blown it aside,
and is composed of thousands of tiny stalactites that
Nature seems to have actually woven in a pattern.
Another pile shows the perfect folds of drapery, and
the “ Beehive ” rises gigantically, with its glittering
dome so thoroughly like the rolled straw of an old
English beehive as to suggest that someone is playing
a trick. The pathway leads down to where a
scintillating crocodile opens tremendous jaws of
gaping blackness. Through them winds the road
to where in another buret of electric light are seen
the Cascade and Frozen Waterfall. In both these
wonders the effect is of falling water suddenly
petrified—a wonderfully beautiful sight. There are
great masses of stalactites that hang with one side
absolutely vertical and the other sloping outward,
and in strange rolls which suggest folded drapery,
and which have been called the Folded Shawl.
Others depend simply enough, but terminate in a way
seen in no other caves on earth, and are actually tied
in knots of Gordian design. Then back once more to
surface and fresh air to see the blue Indian Ocean
sparkling under a sky of Austral blue, ringed with a
beach of golden sand, and reefs of every color known
(and some unknown) to the artist.
Having “done” Yallingup, a thirty-mile drive
brings the tourist to Margaret River Caves. Yalling-
up was fantastic with its weird terminals that some-
times were knots and other times were demons’ faces.
At Margaret River he will find a fairyland of white
alabaster which have actually and literally frozen
into the present shapes while in liquid form. The
wonder of Margaret River is the “Devil’s Hand ”
a hand of pure white alabaster spread over a vast
sloping wall. Why it was called the Devil’s,
only the Devil knows. It is exquisite. In
Golgotha Cave there reposes a skeleton, now
almost petrified. Originally it was the frame-
work of a white man, probably a Dutchman who
had wandered in there to escape the aborigines,
and perished in the midst of the glittering beauty.
The finish is “The Mammoth Cave,” in which every-
thing is on a gigantic scale. The guides illuminate it
with magnesium light, and the effect is bewildering.
As the light blazes up, there flashes into existence a
whole series of wonders. Right in front rises a
gigantic mass of pinnacles that looks like a veritable
temple and is called the Cathedral. The fact that it
appears life size gives some idea of the
magnitude of the caves. Beyond that
the light is flashed back from a thou-
sand and one glittering wonders
that beggar the Arabian Nights
and eclipse all the transfor-
mation scenes of all the
pantomimes in the
world. Beside these
wonders Jenolan is
a pigmy and Yar-
rangobilly a side-
show. They are
superb, sublime,
and vast as the
land whose chief
wonder they are.

AN AUCKLAND LEGEND.
[For Tiib Bulletin.]
The newchum voyaged to Auckland town
With brand-new bag's and a spyglass,
And he gazed at the waterside roofs of brown,
And blinked his eyes through an eyeglass.
“A splendid place,” he muttered, “bai Jove !
But he didn’t know he was branded
By the Man in the Street as an “ English cove ”
The very moment he landed !
The newchum drove to a smart hotel,
Enveloped in choice cigar-clouds,
But he never heard the proprietor’s “ H—11”
As he vacantly gazed at the far clouds ;
And he never noticed the Silent Three
That happened along at the right time,
And followed the man from over the sea
When he went for a stroll in the night time.
The newchum flaunted a chain of gold
As he walked to the bay down a wide street,
And that is the reason, so I’ve been told,
That they leaped on him from a side street.
But the sorrowful tales will out, they say,
For they’re all of them nursing raw bones,
Where Cholly started his own by-play
Upon the enemy's jawbones.
The newchum returned to his peaceful bed ...
But the constables never believed them,
When they lifted the push in the dawning’s red,
And the hospital doors received them.
And the boarders smirked at a chance remark
As the Juggins blinked through the spyglass,
And they say he returned from a walk to the park
Because he’d forgotten his eyeglass.

The Vie. Civil Service Co-operative Society’s
bakery in Richmond begins to take shape. An acre and
a quarter are to he covered with stables, rooms for em-
ployees, bakehouses, and a building holding 10 automatic
steam ovens, with a capacity of 500 bags a week on an
eight-hour shift. In this biggest of Australian bakeries
the edible will not be pawed with the human hand, from
the time it leaves the flour bag till the baker’s boy lilts it
into his basket. And there seems no reason why it should
be pawed then. Why not lift it with a fork ?
“Croson”: An article in the December Lone
Hand on the making of eucalyptus oil is so charmingly
seductive that it almost lures me into the bush to make
my own oil ; but, being of a statistical turn of mind, I
would like to know first where the producer and the con-
sumer come in. The distiller—the manufacturer, that is,
for the pure oil is clear as water and needs no refining-
says he sells at fid. per lb. Now, no Melbourne chemist
w ill sell the oil at less than 6d. the two-ounce bottle. The
grocer cuts it down to 5£d., and occasionally 5d. Allow-
ing the chemist id. for his bottle and id. for the cork,
wrapper, freight and palaver, he is getting 500 per cent,
profit. And even then he must adulterate it with cotton-
seed oil and turps ! Talk about the man who picks your
pocket or snatches your chain ! If the oil distiller the
man who does the useful work—got half-a-crown a pound
for it, the chemist could still give the pure article to his
customers and make a living, while the useful citizen
aforesaid would be able to retire after 30 years toil, as he
ought. ,
A Chicago bakery has adopted the healthful
idea of sending out the bread in cardboard boxes, each
box holding two loaves. Chicago has signified its
enthusiastic approval of the scheme. There can’t be too
little handling of foodstuffs ; yet, under present ordinary
conditions, the daily unprotected loaf, on its journey
from the bakehouse to the dining-room, gets almost as
much mauling as a football.
“Jimmie Pannikin” : I gave our milkman a
long, cool shandy the other day; and this is the story he
told me between the deep draughts : “ Here’s sappy
Chrismiss t’ yez all and a bosker 1908. I had a curious
Ohrismiss. At two ’ouses, I wuz giv’ a slice of cike and
a long drink ; but, each place, the lydy spotted some-
think in the cike, before she ’anded dit over, so she
broke off a corner. Both said much the sime thing—
• i can’t drink your ’ealth, milkie, but I’ll eat a bitta cake
with you, and wish you the compliments o’ the season.-
I thought they waz terrible kind, and not ta bit stuck
kup, tho’ their ’usbands is pretty big guns. At both places,
later on, I gev the’ kiddies a pot o’ cream, and was told
—‘ Mum got th’ sixpence outer our Chrismiss cake.’
Now, I know what the lydies saw that made ’em break a
bit off my slice.’” t
“G.T.8.”: My friend in the second-class
carriage explained to me how he lost his new job :
“ First thing they sends me to drive a load o’ coal ter
Yarra Bend. I gets there about three, an’ leaves me
lorry outside the big gate. Then I gets through the
little gate an sees a bloke. I sez to ’ini, ‘ I got a load o’
coal outside. Were ’ll I put it?’
“‘All right!’ sez ’e, ‘l’ll get someone to ’tend to it
d’reckly.’ , , , .
“ I waits f’r ’arf-an-hour, an’ nobody turns up. So I
sez to a nurse 1 see passing, ‘ I say, Miss, I got a load o’
coal outside, an’ don’t know w’ere ter put it.’
“ ‘ All right,’ sez she, ‘ I’ll send somebody to ’tend to it
d’reckly.’ , ,
“ I ’angs about f’r another ’arf-hour, an nobody conies,
so I starts to find out things meself. Between two
buildin’s I meets another nurse with a lady visitor.
‘ ’Scuse me, Miss,’ I says, ‘ but will yer tell me w’ere to
put a load o’ coal ?’
“ ‘ In a minit,’ she sez ; and then I hears ’er say to ’er
friend—* Funny ideas some o’ them get! ’ An’ even
then I never tumbles.
“ But the next bloke I sees I hangs on to. ‘’E ’edges
away, an’ I toilers on while I sez, ‘See ’ere, Mister, I’ve
got a load o’ coal waitin’ on.a two-’orse lorry outside.
W’ere can I put it?’
“‘All right,’ sez’e, ‘l’ll go an’see about it an’ send
some ’
“ ‘ No yer don’t,’ sez I, an’ grabs ’im by the arm while
I explains that I wasn’t a loony, an’ I takes ’im down to
the gate to show ’im the lorry, and prove it.
“ VV’en I gets back to the office the clerk tells me the
boss wants to see me.
“ ‘ Were yer been all this while ? ’ says the boss. I told
’im. But all ’e sez was ;
“ ‘ You’d better go back agen with that yarn. ’Ere’s
yer money. Get! ’ ”
“ Cict ” : Why is there no legislation to cope
with short-weight beer-vendors ? Galled for a quart bottle
of beer, t’other day, and was treated to a big, nugget,v
black marine, over which I gloated merrily. Safely home
I seized my quart measure, upended the vessel, and dis
charged my newly-bought beer into the same. There w;n
ample room for more, and that despite the head on the
surface. After fainting frequently, I examined the black
object, and found it to consist chiefly of a conical vacuum
at its leg end. This cavity the cursed dark instrument
had been sitting on during my investment—hence the
swindling of me.
“Vexed Victorian”: I observe with horror
that the long beers of the Ma State are quite a teaspoon-
ful longer than those to which I have been accustomed.
Why this self-aggrandisement? Why this inshidious
attempt to lure the manhood of the {hie) younger Shtate
to its undoing? Mark me —ma — {hie) me—l’ll secede.
I’ll secesh. I’ll secesh even if nobody else will. I’ll
shecesh to Sliydney !

“Agricola”: Many locally-purveyed tins and
packets of tea, baking powder, cornflour, biscuits, and
so on, bear on them the date on which they were packed.
Beneath, in prominent letters, the customer is advised to
buy “ no goods bearing a date older than two months.”
Sand-and-Sugar solemnly assures his customers that any
goods left on his hands at the end of that time are
despatched back to the packer, who pays the freight.
Thus the purchaser is supposed to be always getting
freshly-packed goods. It is a beautiful theory, and a
credit to the packer and all concerned. In practice, how-
ever, the returned goods, in the rare cases when they are
returned at all, are simply decorated with new', up-to-date
coverings, and once more sent out on their weary wan-
derings. Lately I noticed that some of the labels were
easily detachable. Not long afterwards I discovered
from our local seller of adulterated goods that the firm
interested in the detachable arrangement sent him a fresh
supply of labels every two months, whereby freight, pack-
ing and opher harassing charges were averted.

The illustration at thd side shows the wooden w’-est-plank of an imported horizontal Grand.
Every imported piano has a wooden wrest-plank.

Each one of these is hammered tightly into a drilled hole in the plank.
Each one therefore is like a wedge—and there are two hundred and forty of them. Look how close they are.
When the wires (or “strings”) are attached, each wedge becomes in addition a lever.
Two hundred and forty wedge-levers close together in a single wooden plank.
The direct pull of the strings, tuned to concert pitch, totals thirty tons.
No wooden plank can stand such a wrenching, bursting strain for long. Not even though it is made of several plies of
Consequently the pins, which ought to be immovable, are turned backwards by the pull of the strings, and the piano is out

That is why imported Grand Pianos have to be re-tuned before each concert. . , , , , , , , , ~

PILES AND LIYEE COMPLAINT.
A Young Man’s Experience and the Wonder-
ful Results Attained by using Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
When the liver is clogged by the inactivity of
the kidneys and bowels it becomes torpid, and
fails to filter the bile from the blood, thus pro-
ducing biliousness and a general impairment of
the digestive system. The tongue is coated, the
head aches, digestion is imperfect; there is aching
of the limbs and back, feelings of fulness, weight
and soreness over the stomach and liver ; the eye
becomes yellow and jaundiced and the complexion
muddy, the urine is scanty and highly colored,
and the bowels irregular, costiveness and looseness
alternating, and frequently the precursor of in-
flammation and piles.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The visit of the Auckland bowlers to Sydney
revealed the fact that the ancient game is no longer a
pastime of old fogies. The average age of the visiting
team was 38 years. In Victoria and Maoriland bowls and
football have combined, and the loamy oaf trundles the
biassed globe in summer time to keep himself in condi-
dition. In N.S.W. also, the number of young men who
take to the green is enormously on the increase, and ap-
pearances indicate that in the near future at least one-
half the juvenile population will be walking round in
striped jackets and white pants, with its head cocked on
one side, watching the other half making shots.

The N.S.W. v. Victoria cricket match —which
ended last week on a damaged wicket—broke a long line
of defeats which has fallen on the Bent State players.
N.S.W. had prevailed in the last eight matches ; but the
long road had a turn in it. Still it was hard luck for the
Victorians that the inter state Sheffield Shield matches
were temporarily hung up for the season, owing to the
inroads into time made by the English team, which left
S.A. out of the inter-State struggles.
■* * * *
“ B.” : The bottom dropped clean out of N.S.W.
cricket in the recent match against Victoria. Consider
the batting of N.S.W. : First innings, 461 (Noble, 176;
Gregory, 201 ; the rest of the team, including sundries,
84). Second innings, 241 (Noble, 123 ; Gregory, 63 ; the
rest of the team, including that good old player, Sundries,
55). Which pans out thus : Full runs scored, 702 (Noble,
299; Gregory, 264 ; the other batsmen, including Sun-
dries, 139). In N.S.W.’s bowling, Noble had the best
average—five w'ickets for 112 runs ; while Johnson also
took five wickets for 169 runs. The other eight bowlers
gathered a wicket or so in the match, and divided nine
wickets amongst them (one batsman run out). The
N.S.W. team had Better paste its latest record in its hat.

Through being too greedy, cricketer Gr. S.
Crouch lost the opportunity of piling up a big score in
Bananaland first-grade cricket on Saturday. Crouch had
199 to his credit, and, in his eagerness to pass the second
century, was run out. Crouch is considered to be a
better batsman than Roger Hartigan, who made a mighty
entrance into Australian Test cricket; and, since it seems
possible that Hartigan will not get the necessary leave
for the remaining Test matches, the selection committee
might do much worse than give the other Queensland
colt a trial.

Adelaide cricket was stirring on Saturday, and
produced some performances calculated to cause selection
committees to think heavily. In response to 312, put
together by Port Adelaide, Sturt banged to much pur-
pose, and in 2h. 40min. scored 294 runs for four wickets.
W. A. Hewer top-scored with 149, and Joe Darling came
into the limelight once again with 85. Gehrs, another
ex-Australian XI. player, secured the four wickets.
Then J. A. O’Connor, imported from N.S.W. as a bowler,
put the broad face of the bat in the front of the wicket,
and scored 70 of West Torrens’ score of 194—the small
score being brought about by the resuscitated arm of old
man J, C. Reedman, who gathered in six wickets for 49
runs. Reedman was a mighty player for South Oss when
many of the present Australian cricketers were on the
nurse's knee ; and yet he has the cunning to keep in the
front.

Excess of mud and water on Saturday practi-
cally broke up Sydney cricket competitions, the only
finished game being that between Burwood and Uni-
versity. It was won by the former on the first day’s
score. All the rest of the matches were declared drawn.

The fact that the N.S.W.-Victoria inter-State
match dragged into six days play forced the Victorian
people to select a team of patriarchs and colts to meet
the English XI. in the match against the State. So
pressed for material was the State that veterans like
G. H. S. Trott and F. Laver were put in to give the
youngsters some stiffening. The result was disastrous,
and the Englishmen who went in first settled down to
give a batting display. It was beautiful to watch, but
did not run to anything like the figures expected, and
the innings closed for 338, of which Hardstaff made IS!2.
Then the colts and has-beens made their effort, and were
dismissed for 77, Barnes taking five wickets for 32, and
Blythe four for 41. The Englishmen cut short the agony
by closing the second innings with four down for 241, and
the Victorians started out to make 502 to draw. They
made only 172.

“Snell”: An exhilarating game of cricket was
played in Albert Park, Melbourne, on one of the after-
noons of the recent sun burst. The match was of some
importance in third-rate cricket, and the contestants
were the most beautifully-flannelled fools I yet in-
spected. But the prevailing thirst got hold of tkem, and
hirelings brought beer in a large vessel hung on a pole.
The players drank, and bucked in like giants refreshed.
Presently the signal of distress (a shirt shaken from a
tree) went up again, and once more the man servants came
across from the pub with a swinging tank of intoxication,
and the cricketers got to work drowning their troubles.
Five times the myrmidons poled beer across, and
bv the time the fifth consignment had gone into
consumption the complexion of the game was materially
altered. It was the first really boozed game of cricket I
had ever seen. Five fielders and one umpire were prone
in their places ; a demented bowler was bowling at a post-
and-rail fence as often as a ball came to hand ; while one
stray batsman drowsed on his bat in an expectant
attitude far off in the field, and the other ran im-
becile runs in any direction. Occasionally a fields-
man would wake up and sprint fatuously after a
sparrow or a cow, and for half-an-hour an umpire and
the wicket-keeper waged an impotent disturbance, be-
cause the former insisted that the latter was out
leg-before. Eventually the semi-sober friends of the
visiting team loaded their eleven into a furniture van,
and took them home. When I left the other eleven were
scattered over the park, still playing, and oblivious to
the fact that their opponents had departed.
“Peking to Paris,” by Luigi Barzini, is already
on the market. It describes in detail the wonderful run
of Prince Seipione Borghese across Asia and Europe.
Borghese is a daring traveller, and this was his second
trip across the Yellow Continent. The first was in the
opposite direction, when he conducted a caravan from
Asia Minor to the shores of the Pacific, but it was not
nearly so full of startling experiences and sudden smash
as the motor rush. In addition to being a great traveller,
Seipione Borghese is a splendid advertiser, and he was
careful, when he started from Peking for Paris, to take
his journalist with him. This was excellent manage-
ment. At the present time he is only 35 years old, so the
chances are that, with his capital, his reputation, and his
genius for advertising, the young man will be heard from
again.

The triangular scrap at present raging in
Morocco takes on a new interest. The French War Office
has just sent an artillery motor to the front for the
purpose of pursuing and shooting down a fleeing enemy.
A French enthusiast offered two armored cars, but the
military people refused to take them, and have despatched
a plain unprotected 30-h.p. Panhard, carrying a Hotchkiss
machine gun. This will be the first time the motor car
has been actually used in fighting, and when old Raisuli
meets it he will probably be too amazed to jump out of the
road, and will get run over. Still they sa.v that old
Raisuli doesn’t stay too long in the fire zone himself, and
at the first sign of trouble leaves a rear guard to make
history while he gets away to where hot tea and safety
are to be found.

“ Pine and Box ”: Re one-legged cyclists (B.
26/12/’O7). Hid you ever hear of a one-legged pedestrian ?
In a Vic. mining town I have on more than one occasion
seen a one-legged man smother several opponents in a
100yds. sprint, all off scratch. Said monoped used to
stand on his mark with the assistance of his crutch.
When the gun went the crutch was tossed aside, and in
tremendous hops he made a bee-line for the worsted, and
generally arrived first. He was only able to maintain his
perpendicular without the crutch whilst in motion. The
last event he won was a sack race, and he was disqualified
on protest for only having one foot in the bag. Then he
retired from athletics in disgust. [This par would look
more convincing if the writer had sent (1) name of town ;
(2) name of one-legged man ; (3) date of race.—Ed. B.]

The Gaming Act, which was hammered through
S.A. Parliament at the tail end of the session, has cer-
tainly proved effective in dispersing the mob of toughs and
welshers that infested the west end of Grenfell-street,
Adelaide. This unsavory crowd formerly assembled in the
early morning and stayed till late at night spitting on the
footpaths and talking about blanky ’orses. Only the
most unworldly local preacher thinks that the Act has
forced the horse-loafers to get work ; but they are not a
constant eyesore—which is something. One “ cigar
divan ” now bears the sign “ Wholesale Wood-Merchant,”
though the name of the merchant is still Adelaide's big-
gest bookmaker. The cute humorist now caters in a
different manner for holy citizens who have money to burn.

That Sydney ponydom has developed some
high-class riders as well as nags has already been demon-
strated through opportunities offered by the A.J.C.’s
recent whitewashing. Latest and most notable instances
are the achievements of ex-pony-jockey Killorn at the
Viceroy’s Cup meet in India, a month or two since. He
rode the winners of the International Pony Plate, Pad-
dock Plate, Pavilion Plate, MacPherson Cup, and Inno-
vation Plate, and dead-heated for Eclipse Stakes. Killorn
has a visit to England in view this year, after heaping up
all the rupees available.

Scotland, purchased early last year by the
owner of past Newmarket sensations, Pendant and Istria,
is already hot favorite for the Newmarket, to be run a
few weeks hence. Bookmakers have the cast-iron impu-
dence to offer four to one against, and justify the brevity
of the price with the explanation that the stable and
intimates backed the beast weeks ago before the weights
were out. It may be so, but it looks more as if thej'
were alarmed at the reputation of the stable for carrying
off Newmarkets. Even Newmarket and Australian Cup
doubles commencing with Scotland are off, and Patrick
Moses is taking no risks. P. Moses rarely does.

The secretary of the Victorian Owners and
Trainers’ Association recently wrote to the secretary of
the Vic. Associated Suburban Proprietary Clubs asking
that a meeting be called to consider the question of in-
creasing the stakes, on account of the rise in fodder, etc.
It was a touching letter and reached the sublime where
it ran : “ It is impossible to race for the stakes at your
meetings with that degree of honesty which the public
have a right to expect. This is accentuated when allow-
ance is made for the large percentage of the stakes con-
tributed in entrance-fees and acceptances by the owners
themselves. We do not believe for a moment that
in licensing proprietary racing Parliament intended that
a few owners and lessees of courses should thereby
be enabled to put large sums of money into their private
purses to the loss and moral degradation of owners and
trainers, and to the serious detriment of breeders of
horses.” It is cheerful to find that the racing people are
beginning to realise what swindles are these proprietary
courses, where thecourse-owners allowthemen whosupply
the fun to put up all the money and gamble for it among
themselves, while the course-owners grab the gate receipts.
But it is more pleasing still to find horsey men protesting
against the system that leads to the “ moral degradation
of owners and trainers.” If this sort of thing continues,
the public will begin to expect “ that degree of honesty to
which it is entitled in racing." At present it doesn’t.

A leading English turf-writer, “Veritas,” has
been speaking his mind freely about bookmakers : “At
Colwick we had cramping of the odds reduced to a fine
art. Although the going was sloppy and treacherous in
the extreme, there were plenty of runners, but only once
during the two days did the metallicians summon up
sufficient courage to offer 2tol on the field. The prices
were enough to sicken any casual holiday-making race-
goer. The offers on the field for the twelve races were :
Evens, 5t04,6 to 4, take 2tol, 2 to 1,11 to 10, take 3to
1, evens, evens, 7to 4, evens, and take 6 to 4 ; and, as if
this were not enough, there were seven second favorites
whose prices ranged between 5 to 2 and 3to 11 ”

Otto Madden, an English jockey with a long
record of success, has had an extraordinary run of bad
luck, riding 63 consecutive losers. A systematic backer
who used to have a pound on him, and double the stake
after each loss, soon got tired, and then amused himself
by calculating the amount he would have lost if he had
kept going. After 21 losses he would have been over
£2,000,000 out of pocket, and as he would want to bet
nearly £2,100,000 on the next race, he thought there
“ might have been some difficulty in booking the bets.”
The amount required to follow up to 63 times is almost
beyond arithmetic. The row of noughts would spread
from Redfern to Circular Qnay.

M. P. Adams: The testimony of “A.8.C.”
to the nimbleness of Jimmy at the shells and pea game
(thimblerigging) (B. 9/l/’08) is quite acceptable, except
that Jimmy, if a player, would lift a shell and expose his
pea, and not produce the pea apparently from the shell.
The pea is never lifted, except by a finger palm in play.
For manipulation see Lonk Hand for August. When a
“mug’’makes a selection, the player always lifts the
shell which is empty, and then lifts another exposing the
pea on the umbrella, to convey the idea that the
pea was actually there all the time. The same action
that lifts the shell leaves the pea that was retained
in the fingers, behind. A Jimmy who merely produced
a pea in his fingers would not amaze the spieler by any
means, for that hard-shelled veteran is not to be bustled.
My experience of the game in Melb. is that the new player
is a myth, and the old hand is becoming fewer every year.
Experienced spielers regard a “shrewdie” —Jimmy,
f’rinstance —as a diversion, and he usually gets a pretty
hot time, especially as the spielers hunt in packs. I could
produce a pea from any shell in a game, but I wouldn’t
care to risk the consequences.

A Bulletin man saw the start of an exciting
race recently, and has been waiting with feverish interest
for some news of the result. While taking a scamper
round certain proposed Federal capital sites he met num-
bers of squatters rushing wildly for certain grass lands some
70 miles from Queanbeyan (N.S. W.). One party cheerfully
attempted to make sure of getting in first by engaging all
the vehicles for three days, so that any other grass-
seekers who came along would be up a tree. Some more
came, and among them a man on the verge of ruin. He
offered fabulous prices for a vehicle to take him to
Ura.valla in one day and on to the grass land the next.
Then he heard that there was a party already on the road
to Ura.valla, and he fell down in a chair and drank three
iced whiskies right off to keep him alive. Then he got an
inspiration. He was seen streaking for the telegraph
office. Three hours later a dust-laden motor car rushed
into the town, and pulled up at the hotel. A grimy
object sprang out and flew into the bar, where it howled
for beer and plenty of it. That motor car was a sight.
Tins of petrol wrapped in blankets were lashed to the
steps and stowed wherever a tin could be squeezed. The
squatter climbed aboard, and the grimy object in goggles
staggered out with an armful of bottles which he stowed
carefully with tender watchfulness. Then there was a
“toot, toot,” the grimy nose swung round, the atmo-
sphere was blotted out with red dust, and the grass-seeker
was on the road to Urayalla. If the car could get
through, those thoughtful squatters in front were as
good as donkey-licked. Up to the present there is no
word how the race ended.
That inter-State pursuit race between N.S.W.
and Victoria was a great victory for little A. J. Clarke on
the Melbourne Saucer track. Shortly after starting the
Victorian team went to pieces, and its members dropped
out one by one till only Clarke was left. Alone and
unaided he set sail after the Walers (Horder, Gascoyne,
Plunkett and Quinlan), and after 3f miles of ferocious
effort he caught the team and beat it out of hand. Both
at cricket and cycling Victoria is going strong just now.

To suit the convenience of the tide the Webb-
Tresidder sculling match has been postponed to February
25, and the final deposit is due on February 15. Maoriland
is already getting worked up to a state of hysteria, which
can be gauged by the fact that the Employers’ Associa-
tion has decided ta grant a full holiday on that date in
Wanganui and surrounding districts. It will be a
fearful thing if Tresidder cannot get his final deposit
after the Employers’ Association deciding to grant a
full holiday. The latest reports of the training indicate
that the race is going to be one of the hardest contests
ever waged for the championship. Tresidder is said to
be in great fettle, capable of getting through the water
at high speed, and showing plenty of stamina. On the
other hand, it is said that the pace at which Webb beat
Towns will be a mere caterpillar compared to that which
he will set against Tresidder. However, talk is always
cheap and easy.
Melbourne Swimming Club carnival occupied
the St. Kilda Baths (formerly Hegarty’s) on Saturday
afternoon last, when the usual roll-up of girls and other
followers occurred. Generally speaking, the public stays
away, for the show is tiresome, the contestants being too
far away to thoroughly engage one’s interest. In a bath
which is not a barn of a place, and with calm water, a
swimming show could be made to jig some. The star
item was for the 100yds. Victorian supremacy', and for
this classic event four competitors took the plat-
form, including triple winner Frank Fitts. The
boys hit the brine to a fair start. Billy Mason
got the best move, and battling hard kept in advance of
Fitts in a heavy rolling sea. The second fifty saw
Ballaratite Bennett paddle strongly' and supplant
Fitts for second position. Mason held his lead and won
by less than a length in 65 l-ssec. for the straight
hundred —best time for the race. Standard time is 67sec.
In ’O4, Cecil Healy did 58sec. over this course. At the
Ballarat carnival early'in the week Mason, in the absence
of Beaurepaire, won the 500yds. championship, defeating
local paddler Clegg by 30yds. in 7min. lsec. Mason won
all the way, and did the journey llsec. faster than
“ Bogey’s ” record of last year.

Sailing on Saturday afternoon on Sydney
Harbor was a tiring business. The wind was practically
non-existent, coming only in brief faint puffs from the
N.E. Many of the boats never turned up at the starting
point, and most of those which did found themselves be-
calmed and doing the rocking-horse act most of the time.
The only race that was sailed to a finish in the sudden
S.E. tumble that came along about 6.30 was the Sydney
Club’s. The boats in this event were scattered all over
the Harbor, and at one time Australian and Young Jack
had a mile to the good of the fleet. But the wind, such
as it was, was in favor of the backmarkers, and kept
bringing the hinder boats into the front and leaving them
there. Then the sudden south-easter came along, and the
boats started with a bound. They were nearing the line,
and the sudden puff accelerated things. Australian flew
over with a good margin, and then came Zena, Eileen,
and Pheasant in that order.

English papers are rather fond of getting hold
of any fanciful Bulletin par. about football and stoush,
as combined in a game between the Hardface club and
the Metalslingers. This is printed with striking headlines,
such as “ Football as Played in Australia.” It is, there-
fore, worth while to note that in a fairly important
competition, the Belfast City Cup, an Irishman belonging
to a leading club has been “ suspended for striking the
referee and rendering him unconscious.”

“Chewey ” Williams is a much-walloped man.
Recently beaten by Snowy Sturgeon, in Sydney, he
journeyed north to Newcastle and put up a blue-tooth
sort of fight against John Blackmore, on Saturday night.
About half way through the scrap Williams suddenly
slumped, and Blackmore, rising to the occasion, fell on
him and inflicted a severe castigation. The explanation
was that Williams had hurt his left hand. The fight
lasted 14 rounds, and they are described as all being full
of vim. Williams left on Monday for Hobart, where he
will on February 12 hold up his classic dial for the
attentions of Jack Willis.

Two recent Melbourne scraps, vivid if not
artistic, were Russell v. Fennesseyand Whiting v. Hendy.
Russell is a Sydney heavy-weight. Fennessey is a Vic.
timber shifter, big enough to fight Goliath, but lacking
gifts. His left hand shoots with fair effect, but he can
use his right no more than a hen. He takes punishment
as a navvy takes soup, and Russell supplied his wants on
this occasion with reasonable liberality. The big fellow
is as strong as a camel, but doesn’t wear well, and after
four rounds, during which Fennessey’s left notched many
points, the Sydney boy took up the running, and kept
an easy lead, winning a long scrap on points.
Hendy and Whiting, who appeared three
nights later, are lighter men. They were recommended
to the public mainly on the strength of a long-standing
enmity. The middle-weights got at it as if desirous of
rubbing each other off the earth’s surface before the
police came. Hendy was the most eager, and worked
himself to a lather on the, red-gum block forninst him
Then, when he was somewhat worn with the burden of
the fray, his foe stepped in, and got active. The change
was bad for Mr. Hendy, who received considerable mis-
chief before the referee said he could hold no more.
Whiting was declared winner in round eight.

This continual skite about the “papfer point”
and “ glass jaw ” of Willie Squires makes one tired.
Willie’s trouble was not that his jaw was weak, or anv
other part of him ; but that he didn’t know how to avoid
punishment. His first fight with Burns was not settled bv
abash on the point. It was a smash over the ear that
dazed him, and it was a dazed, almost insensible, man to
whom Burns gave the coup de grace on the point,
Goliath’s jaw would have been glass under similar cir-
cumstances. As a matter of fact, his American cam-
paign proved that Squires’ jaw was abnormally strong, as
in his latest contest it was badly battered several times
before he was outed. No bruiser on earth can
stand continual smashes on the point, and
the only difference between Billiam and his
Yankee conquerors was that they were quiekcr on their
feet than he, and knew how to protect their vulner-
able points. The Yankee fighter is taught to hit hard
and to protect his vitals. He is made a fighter, while all
the knowledge of fighting that Billiam had was born with
him, and never improved upon. That sort of natural
talent usually goes down before the trained product when it
has to fight according to rules, and when the manufactured
article is as strong and physically courageous as the raw
material. If Billiam had been taught to skip, to dance
away like a vanishing sprite, and to keep his vulnerable
points properl> protected, he would probably have been
a world champion. But he wasn’t, and therefore he
isn’t.
“ Hiphen”: The annihilation of Gunner Moir by
Burns, in London, recently, is no miracle. The trouble
with British (and also Australian) pugilism is that a man
gets to the front too easily. There’s not enough com-
petition. Compare the records of Moir and Burns. Three
years ago the hefty “Gooner” came out here to wrestle
in an advertising way with Hackenschmidt. He had
done s me inconsiderable boxing in India. Also he
claimed i lie championship of Mauritius. While here, the
only man with any pretensions whom he beat was the
infelicitous Felix. Then he went to England, where he
defeated one “ Tiger ” Smith (a man who shapes right
foot foremost). This victory placed him in the first
flight of British heavy-weights, and he found no
difficulty in obtaining substantial backing for further
adventures. Had Moir been a Yank, would he have
found ready backers on such slender performances? No!
An emphatic N-0 in The Bulletin’s largest type. To get
to the pugilistic orchestral stalls Burns and such Yankee
pugs have to battle their way from the shilling gallery.
The difference is that, while in England pugilism is a
game, in America it is a business. An English backer of
fighters is a wealthy sport, who spends money on the
affair for amusement. In America there is a shrewd,
keen tribe of business-men who adventure their cash on
tried, experienced fighters, and thereby earn their daily
toast.

In his final scrap with Janies Flynn, the Cali-
fornian fireman, Squires proved to be very slow on his
feet. He smote the Californian whenever that worthy
came within range, but was utterly' unable to follow up
and finish him. Once he had Flynn absolutely rocking
with a swing on the jaw, but could not catch him to
finish him. The Californian had been taught to skip and
to get away, so out of every clash Squires came off second
best, smitten on the jaw again and again, till nature
could endure no more, and a chance upper cut in a break-
away sent him to the floor and out for ever, after six
rounds of exciting scrap.
London Daily Mail notes (13/12/’O7)
another of the accursed results of Protection.
Under the heading, “Japan our Rival,” it is
regretfully pointed out that ever since the institu-
tion of a high tariff—
Japan’s rapidly-growing: competition in the shipping,
shipbuilding, and coarse cotton export trades has been
causing uneasiness in British minds. The manager of an
important city firm having Eastern connections said
yesterday that Japan, within the past two or threeyears,
had completely outstripped her rivals in the umbrella and
match-making trades in the Far East. “In India,” he
remarked, “ she has almost entirely captured our trade
in those articles.” Japan is also, to the detriment of
British manufacturers, exporting carpets, tobacco, lamps,
straw hats, and cotton and silk goods into China, Man-
churia, and Korea in ever-increasing quantities.
It is the old story. Protection is a hideous corse
for the other fellow.

The green at Port Melbourne on Saturday last was in
splendid condition, and the catering worthy of a special
paragraph. In passing, we may express the fervent hope
that the wicked corned beef may cease from troubling on
Monday next and the weary cheese be at rest. Would the
reserving of special refreshment tables for players be
too much to ask? —Melbourne Herald Bowls Expert
(2W08.)
The grand old bowler braced himself against the bar, and
said:
“Yes, sir! This is the champion game to clear the
toiler’s head—
To shake the city vapors off and chase dull care away,
And breed good-fellowship on every summer Saturday.
Bowls? Yes, indeed! It saved mj' life; and many
another here
Has found the same—a little game goes well with food
and beer.
“ We thus avoid the fear of fat,” he said, “ and wobble
not,
And still find time to glory in our prosperous earthly lot?
We still can clamber up beside the driver on the ’bus ;
Though greying years creep on apace, Bath chairs are not
for us—
And sure, it fills our hearts with joy and glads our sport-
ing souls
To see good food and beer about when we go playing
bowls! ”
The ag<sd and the middle-aged, a-jogging down the green,
Ponder no more upon the various things that might have
been ;
Not theirs to sit against the fire and grouch about the
gout—
They put on blazers and white pants, and prance around,
and shout!
No longer on dead pasts they dwell, nor on dull futures
brood ; ’
But go baldheaded and in haste for bowls, and beer, and
food!

It will interest the pastoral community to know
that the “ Moffat-Virtue ” Sheep Shearing Machine Co.
has now obtained such a footing, and found such high
favor for its machines, that it is enabled to conduct its
business direct with pastoralists, and without the inter-
vention of any sole agents. This change came into
operation on Ist January, 1908, and it is felt that the
new departure will obviate delay, and greatly facilitate
operations. Although it may not be generally known, it
is nevertheless a fact that for the past four or five years,
the “ Moffat-Virtue ” Company has been manufacturing
extensively in Sydney, and its works are among the most
up-to-date and thoroughly equipped in the Southern
Hemisphere. The “ Moffat-Virtue ” Co. finds this fact
greatly in its favor at the present time, as a tariff of 20
per cent, and 25 per cent., ad valorem, on sheep-shearing
machinery has been passed through its preliminary
stages in the House of Representatives, and is at present
in force. Being Australian manufacturers, the “ Moffat-
Virtue” Sheep Shearing Machine Co. does not find it
necessary to advance its prices to buyers on account of
the tariff, and it claims that it is entitled to warm,
practical support as the founder of an important Austra-
lian industry. The co. has made arrangements for exten-
sive representation in all the capitals of the Common-
wealth and in Maoriland. Further particulars will be
found in its advt. on the back cover of this issue.*

Mr. THOMAS FORSYTH, of Ashfield, writes and
declares on oath the following :—“ I suffered from acute
inflammation of the stomach, with a burning pain. My
tongue got a thick coating over it, and I constantly
suffered from nausea. Why, I used to be almost con-
stantly vomiting. I consulted two doctors in Ashfield for
years without getting relief. But in three weeks
‘FISHER’S GREAT NERVE TONIC’ completely cured
me. lam Noble Grand for the Loyal Ashfield M.U.0.0.K

“ Melb.” writes :
Odd that the Fitzgibbon statue should be unveiled just
after Bent made his offer to the Hospital of the Domain
site, hard by, because Fitz.’s virtue was a tooth-and-nail
opposition to any alienation of public reserves. Yon
Mueller, before the site of Government House was de-
cided on, planted all that hill with innumerable little pines
to make a delightful forest for the public, and embalm his
own memory in gratitude and foliage. They seem to
have been ruthlessly rooted out. Von Mueller used
to say: “ Dis vill be de blace for de lovyers !”
Good old man ! What a beautiful idea —planting the
pines. How great men are baulked. Von Mueller’s
pines and the Fitzgibbon statue ! Mind you, Fitz was
greater than Flinders, or Batman, or Faulkner, or
Higinbotham, or Lord Melbourne. What is the principle
on which statues are put up ? Why does Melbourne have
Fitzgibbon and Burns, W. J. .Clarke and O’Connell,
Ormond and Khartum Gordon? Why this hash and
medley ?
People who ask, with an astonished ex-
pression, on what possible grounds any foreign
nation can ever find cause to quarrel with us,
and hold that as long as we are civil and affable,
and take off our hat gracefully, we don’t require
any defence, fail to realise how easy it is to find
cause to quarrel if one is wanted. China, for
instance, proposes to build a railway from Hsin-
min-tung to Fa-ku-menn, and though those
staggering places are wholly within its own
territory Japan has served it with notice to stop
the work. It is, according to the Japanese,
contrary to “ the spirit ” of the Treaty of Pekin.
And that is such a wide and handy expression
that probably the railway to Cloncurry (Q.) could
be shown to be contrary to “ the spirit ” of the
Treaty of Utrecht, made 200 years ago, if it was
worth anybody’s while.

The Freetrader always has his tongue in his
cheek. The coffee duty was before the Senate
last week, and the usual ass proposed the usual
reduction, which the Government opposed, in the
interests of the Queensland coffee-growing indus-
try. Thereupon the S. M. Herald :
When the division was taken several Freetraders voted
with the Government, including, of course, all the
Queenslanders.
Of course ! Freetrade never is good enough for
one’s own self. It is a blessing which the Free-
trader always reserves for his neighbor, while he
struggles to get the complete curse of Protection
for himself.
Murchison, in Northern Victoria, is weep-
ing and wailing. Hitherto it has supplied itself
with water pumped by an engine bought years
ago with borrowed money. No provision was
made for renewal, and no sinking fund was pro-
vided, and now the machine is worn out and
threatens to collapse, and Murchison—waking up,
as many more will do, to find that it has neither
machine nor money—wants Bent to find £l5O for a
new pump. But Thomas recollects that the old
weapon isn’t paid for yet, and has turned his deaf
ear to Murchison, wherefore that village threatens
to presently become as dry as Judkins on a
Beastly Sunday Afternoon.
On the day that the papers reported Bent
and Wade’s decision to test the legality of any
Federal regulation limiting the size of wheat-
sacks to 2001 b. capacity, they also printed this
from Geelong (Vic.): —
A young married man, named John Halliday, dropped
dead. The deceased, who was of Herculean build,
though short of stature, was one of the best, if not
the very best, wheat carriers at this port. There is no
doubt whatever that this powerful young man owes his
death to the straining of his heart while engaged in
carrying ponderous bags of wheat.
Briefly and plainly, that fine Australian was mur-
dered for two-pence —murdered by the unspeak-
ably mean farmer who says that he saves tuppence
by using the big sack of from 3001 b. to 6101 b. And
Bent and Wade, who , won’t interfere with the
murderer themselves, are going to see whether
they can’t stop anybody else interfering ! Well,
it is just as well to know what State Frights
really mean.
New South Wales got the blessing of
Federation at the beginning of 1901, and it began
to get the blessing of Protection towards the
beginning of 1902. These results are shown by
the N.S.W. State Bureau of Statistics :
Loss by
Six years (1896-1901) under Separatism and Excess of
so-called Freetrade Departures,
10,396
Gain by
Six years (1902-1907) under Federation and Excess of

Poor, afflicted old State !
Owing to a decent crop or two having
been got off the newly-settled Pinnaroo mallee
lands in the S. Australian south-east, Bent, the
other week, sent a survey party to the western
mallee lands of Victoria, with a view to
dropping some farmers out there. During the
hot spell a few incidental words drifted
into the papers about Bent’s new land of
promise. The party hadn’t been heard of
for days, the few local residents were out search-
ing for it, and grave anxiety was felt that
the horses had broken down among the heavy
sandhills, and that the party had been cut off
from water. And yet Bent proposed to send
farmers out there, where even a party of sur-
veyors is liable to die of thirst, and leave the big
landlords with their few sheep in undisputed
possession of the rich, fertile country of the Wes-
tern District!

SKIN AND SCALP
DISORDERS CURED
Man Was Rapidly Losing Hair
Another Member of Family Suf-
fered with Eczema of the Hands
for Ten Years—Both Happy to
TESTIFY TO EFFICACY
OF CUTICURA REMEDIES
“I have great pleasure in giving
particulars of two complete cures de-
rived from the use of the Cuticura
Remedies.
“In my own case, for more than six
months I was suffering from disorder on
my scalp and in consequence was fast
losing my hair. I was advised to give
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
a trial, which I luckily did. I adopted
the treatment prescribed and at the end
of one month was completely cured.
This was at the beginning of 1905.
Since that time my head has been
restored to its normal state, and no
further outbreak has occurred, and
whenever I have had the opportunity
I always recommend the Cuticura
Remedies.
“ A member of our family periodically
suffered for nearly ten years from dry
eczema on the hands. The fingers and
palms split and cracked everywhere at
the slightest movement. At such
periods they were most painful as well
as quite useless, and gloves were always
obliged to be worn. Every possible
remedy was tried, besides medical
advice, blood mixtures, ointments,
soaps, etc., some of which gave slight
relief for a time, but never perma-
nently. Finally, she was advised to
try Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Oint-
ment, which we are thankful to say
effected a complete cure, as she has had
no recurrence of the trouble for the last
three years. We are most happy to
testify to the efficacy of the Cuticura
Remedies in similar cases. Edward
Allen, 65, Denmark Road, South Nor-
wood, S. E., March 26, 1906.”
A SINGLE SET
Of Cuticura Remedies
Consisting of Cuticura Soap, to cleanse
the skin, Cuticura Ointment, to heal the
skin, and Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to
cool and cleanse the blood, is often suffi-
cient to cure the most torturing, disfigur-
ing skin, scalp, and blood humours, with
loss of hair, from infancy to age, when all
else fails.

The Times (London) has not prospered of late years. It
was indeed never a great money-maker for its proprietors,
who, having some journalistic; ideals, used to aim at a great
newspaper first and great profits afterwards. During the
last decade several Australian daily papers made double
the profits of the Times ; but whilst it paid its foreign
correspondents like ambassadors, and its staff like judges,
the Australian dailies grind huge profits out of the sweated
labor of starveling reporters and the ridiculous news service
of a Cable Trust which sacrifices everything for economy.
Of late years the Times has been trying to retrieve itself
financially by such devices as selling the Times Encyclo-
paedia, and organising the Times Book Club. This new
policy was not too successful. Journalists, the world
over, will wish the new proprietary the best of luck, for,
whatever its political mistakes, the Times has always
been the most dignified figure in the world’s journalism.
Melbourne Comments is to arrive on February 27, not
February 2, as the shocking “ fist ” of a contributor
caused Tub Bulletin to say recently.

Sydney Daily Telegraph made £43,598 last year ; that
includes the five or six thousand brought in net by
the little Weekly Thrill. The present co. began in 1884,
and for 10 years past it has been too busy watering its
stock to breathe. Every year but once since 1897 it has
sent out bonus shares, besides paying the dividend. The
bonus alone has averaged about 10 per cent. For last
year the co. first of all pays 12£ per cent, dividend (that
is, 12£ per cent., not merely on what the shareholders
have actually paid, but on all the bonus shares
as well). The dividend, paid quarterly, mopped up
£16,637. Then on top of that the co. pays a bonus
nominally of £16,900 (another 12J per cent.); but for
that £16,900, it issues to shareholders at par 1690 shares
paid to £lO, and as those shares are worth £7O, the bonus
really means 87J per cent to the poor wretch Who has
the misfortune to hold the shares ; and the 12£ per cent,
dividend (mostly on capital provided in the same way)
makes 100 per cent, for the year. No wonder, though it has
been so well-watered, the stock is still at 700 per cent,
premium ! Randal Carey, Gorman (of Hardie and G.),
Henry Gullett, Robert Sands, and John Sulman, the
architect, are the directors nowadays ; Gullett, an ex-
editor, has come on during the last year or two.

“The Prooshan ” : “ Mallarapoonie’s ” theory as to
what a devil’s thirteen of The Bulletin writers are like
offers a change from the fried gohanna, roast snake and
boiled leg o’ spider par ; it is speculative, of course, but
interesting. I often go wondering like “Mai.” Thus:
“ Brown’s place ought to be on the left side of the road ;
there should be a sliprail entrance near the road ; a big
mulberry tree on the left side of the house ; apples in front.
The harvest paddock will contain about 60 acres of wheat
at the south end. The land will be fairly high from the
house back”— — And so on with Brown’s wife, kitchen,
kids, etc. Ah well, it’s only fancy, and a fraud of a fancy too,
the same as “ Mallarapoonie’s.” Now here’s “ The Proo-
shan,” according'to the seer : “ 6ft. 3in. ; bushy whiskered ;
bullock-driver, tank-sinker, fencer, etc. ; likes scientific
subjects and spirits; is an old cobber of ‘Janor’s,’ and
often goes on the booze with him.” Well, here I am, as
I am : sft. lOin. ; whiskerless; State school teacher;
seldom touch science or spirits ; never met ‘ Janor ’ in my
life, and was never known to be tight. I should say
“ Mallarapoonie ” is about 4ft. high, cross-eyed, of cadav-
erous appearance (the result of prolonged opium smoking),
cadges matches and tobacco for a living, has a scar on his
left temple, the result of a baton crack when resisting
arrest on a charge of indulging a wild imagination in the
libelling of 12 good, honest, and reliable Bulletin scribes.
“Parkside ” : A restless, quick-moving man, of medium
height and build, sallow-complexioned, and clean-shaven
save for a small dark moustache, is Cyril Arthur Pearson,
the new director of the London Times. He is not an
impressive person. He might easily be taken for a mere
bloke. Unlike most Englishmen in his restlessness and
in the rapidity of his speech, Pearson nevertheless knows
his countrymen to a T, and serves up precisely the kind
of journalistic wash that the British public delights in.
Consider the man’s evolution, or growth or declension,
or whatever you may care to call it. youth of
eighteen, he entered for a Tit-Bits competition—probably
to'discover how many grains of sand blew through the
whiskers of the oldest inhabitant of Sahara in twenty-four
hours. The prize was a billet worth 255. a week in George
Newnes’ office, and young Pearson won it. He entered
at once upon the duties—about 26 hours a day and meals
in your own time. In four years he had got such a grip
of the science of snipping that he broke away to establish
Answers. Upon that slender foundation he has builded
we ll—for himself—and, besides controlling a score or so
of daily and weekly newspapers, several magazines, etc.,
is now High Panjandrum of the Englishmen’s fetich—the
Thunderer.
I met the man in London a few years ago, shortly after
he had acquired the controlling interest in the Standard,
that Pecksniffian “ organ ”of the middle classes. Pear-
son, by the way, has no politics to speak of; his one
redeeming virtue is a tendency towards Protection.
A motor-car rattled and snorted, doors opened with a
rush and banged heavily, and C. Arthur entered briskly,
pulled off his goggles, flung himself into a chair, and
propped his feet on the office table. Then he re-lighted—
ye gods ! —a cheap and particularly nasty cigar.
“ Newspaper business ? Yes, it’s all right. Business
first and always, of course. Give the public what they
think they want —or persuade them they must have it.
The leading principle is to advertise. Strange, isn’t it,
that many newspapers, the media by which other people
call attention to their wares, affect to be too lofty to
advertise themselves. It’s nonsense. Sweet are the uses
of advertisement.” . . ~
Pearson takes little interest in affairs Australian. He
was surprised to learn the extent of the Commonwealth-
United Kingdom trade.
“You’re too far away to be of interest here, he de-
clared, puffing furiously at his alleged cigar. “That is,
unless you can give us a first-class tragedy 7 a mining
disaster, shipwreck, or something of the sort. That’s
news, anywhere, and all times. Yes, we have a lot about
Canada in the London dailies, perhaps much less interest-
ing matter than is going in Australia, but the explana-
tion’s simple. British people to the number of 40,000 or
50 000 yearly are flocking to the Dominion, and their
interests are our readers’ interests, to a large extent.
Canada is even described sometimes as a suburb of
London. At all events, it’s only five or six days’ sail away,
and the country seems no more distant than Ireland or
Scotland. , , _ ' . ,
“ Australia’s all right when there’s a Test match or a
Six Hatters case. Believe in the Six Hatters yarn ?
Never troubled to find out. It was copy at the time, and
good copy’s good business, and good business is what the
up-to-date newspaper is after. ‘Bye!’”
A hasty «rip of the hand, more swishing and banging
of doors, a sound like the wail of a strornr cat in its
agony, and C. Arthur Pearson was whisked off in an odor
of petrol and bad tobacco. # #
“Alia”: The inky splashes on the Milky Way of the
N.S. W. North Coast continue to develop. The Richmond
:uid Tweed River districts now have 14 newspapers—
bismore, two dailies and a bi-weekly; Casino, two bi-
weeklies; Ballina, two bi-weeklies ; Murwillumbah two
-,i weeklies; Ooraki, Kyogle, Bangalow, Mullumbimby
ui 1 Byron Bay, a weekly apiece. And another starts at
AlMonville shortly. Yet the whole population is only
about 60,000, not including Cow ; but Cow is a poor
reader, and hardly counts. The neighboring district of
the Clarence, with a population of 40,000, has, fc Jj®
other hand, only four papers—three at Grafton and one on
the lower river.
“THOU SHALT WRITE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I'll write no more !” the poet said,
Sore goaded by the critics’ sneers—
Down drooped his fine leonine head,
His eyes were dim with unshed tears.
“ Oh little men of little minds 5
Oh madly throbbing heart and brain 5”
He hurled his papers to the winds
(The ink went through a window pane).
“I’ll write no more”—he seemed to choke—
Then broke in twain his trusty quill,
When, lo ! a voice behind him spoke :
“ ’Ere, wot about this washin’ bill ? ”
The poet’s soul flamed in bis cheek,
He turned the hireling baise to quell—
Then sitting down with aspect meek,
Began once more to write like
N.S.W.
HORACE HALLORAN.

“Throw Physic
to the Dogs”
said ** Macbeth ” hundreds of years ago, and those who are vainly seeking
relief from the same source to-day would do well to follow his advice.
The most advanced scientists of the present day are saving the same thing that
Macbeth said, only in different words. Prof. O. S. Fowler, in his work on
the treatment of nervous diseases, savs :—“ Sufferers little realise how far they are
restorable, yet they seek relief in the wrong direction, for medicines cannot cure this
class of disease ; but, on the contrary, they almost universally prove injurious. They
are no more adapted to meet these cases than a dose of ipecac or jalap is to assuage a
mother’s grief for the loss of her darling babp, foj the disease—being largely local-the
restoratives must be applied directly to those prostrated parts, and since electricity is
undoubtedlv the instrumentality of all life, it necessarily follows that this element
constitutes Nature’s own most potent remedy in these diseases when rightly applied 1 .”
you have been paying money to doctors and taking nasty medicines for years,
and have derived no benefit from it all, do you not think it is time to stop? Twenty
years’ experience with Drugs and Electricity has confirmed us in the knowledge that
Electricity alone, without anv other material aid, will replace and renew lost energy
and vitality, and that our appliance is the only practical, commonsense way of applying
it. Thousands of grateful letters from cured patients who suffeted from Debility,
Weakness of all kinds, Nervousness, Backache, Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Varicocele, Indigestion, Constipation, and Stomach,
Liver and Bowel Troubles, tell us that medicines failed to cure
them, and that Electricity as given by
dr. McLaughlins elegtrig belt

did cure them after they had tried everything else and had given up
hope. It is the grandest invention of the age for weak people. No weak, sickly, deli-
cate person will ever regret giving it a trial. It has special attachments for men and women.
Our Belts are sold in every civilized country in the world. The thousands of testi-
monials we have received from all parts of Australia, and the many years of success we
have had here, are absolute proof that Dr. McLaugliin’s Electric Belt is the standard.
We have many imitators but no equals. Don’t be misled by false “ Free Belt ” offers, or
the extravagant claims of those who promise an impossible appliance as bait for a 20-guinea
course of drugs. Don’t take Drug's ; use Electricity alone as we apply it and

CURE
HEADACHE, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION
and BILIOUSNESS.
The immense number of orders for FROOTOIDS sent by post direct to the Proprietor is
convincing proof that the Public appreciate their splendid curing power. They cure
quickly, are elegant in appearance, and pleasant to take.
“I am writing to you to express my thanks
for the Frootoids which I received from you some
time ago. My mother, who was a great sufferer
from Headache and Bilious Attacks for many years,
has been taking them, and has found complete
relief from them.”
L. PATCH, Pelican Creek, Coraki, N.S.W.
f
“Kindly send by return post two separate
bottles of Frootoids for Indigestion, &c. I got a
bottle from you before, and am pleased to say
they have done me good.”
E. PIKE, “ Myrtle Cottage,” Manildra, N.S.W.
“Your ‘Frootoids* is the only medicine I
have ever found to do me any good for Biliousness
and Indigestion. One dose gives relief.”
J. H. SLEEP, Lochiel, S.A.
“ Enclosed please find 3/- for two bottles of
Frootoids for Indigestion. I got some from you
two months ago, and found them very good.”
HENRY MASLIN, Childers, Isis, Queensland.
“Will you please forward another bottle of
Frootoids? They have relieved me of my Head-
aches. You can use my name at any time as a
testimonial for the benefit of others.”
F. J. CHUBB, Moe, Gippsland, Victoria.
“ Please forward me another bottle of Froo-
toids. The other bottle I got gave great satisfac-
tion, as my husband had been suffering from
Constipation for a long time, and nothing did him
any good until he took your Frootoids. He says
he now feels that he is quite a different man.”
J. LONERGAN, Yielima, Victoria.
•
“For about three years I have been a great
sufferer from Nervous Depression caused by a
constipated state of the Bowels. I sent to you for
a bottle of Frootoids, which I duly received, and
am pleased to say that they have worked a
wonderful change in me—in fact, I feel as if lam
getting a new lease of life, and will be glad to
recommend them to any of my friends.”
T. CRESSEY, Ahaura, West Coast, N.Z.
“Please send me three bottles of Frootoids.
I took two doses from the last bottle, and gave the
balance away to some friends, and they are of the
same opinion that I am—that ‘Frootoids’ are a very
good medicine.”
A. B. PEDEN, Glenmaggie, Victoria.
“Many thanks for forwarding the Frootoids.
I took a dose of them at night, and by the morning
they had removed all trace of headache. It was
quite a relief to get rid of it so speedily. lam feel-
ing splendid now.”
M. M'CALLUM, 65 Cunningham Road,

Solomon Islands Development Company [td.
CAPITAL-£lOO,OOO in 1000 Shares of £lOO Each.
Five Pounds Per Share payable on application, and Ten Pounds upon allotment, the balance to be
called up in instalments as required, not more than £lO per Share to be called up each half-year.
PROVISIONAL DIRECTORS:
COL. JAMES BURNS ADAM FORSYTH, Esq.
HON. JAMES INGLIS WALTER LUCAS, Esq.
MANAGING AGENTS: BURNS, PHILP AND COMPANY, LIMITED.
OFFICES : 10 BRIDGE STREET, SYDNEY.
THIS Company is being formed to acquire lands, principally in the Solomon Islands Group, and to
develop them by the establishment of plantations of cocoanuts, rubber, bananas, fibres, and other
valuable tropical products. It will also take power in its Articles of Association to engage in any
other business incidental to the Islands.
. 200 Shares, equal to £20,000, have already been applied for by persons who are acquainted intimately
with Island conditions. When 300 shares, equal to £30,000, are allotted, the company will be considered
as formed.
The establishment of Cocoanut Plantations is to be the main object of the Company as being the surest
and most easily worked source of revenue. The Company, however, do not propose waiting seven or eight
years until the cocoanuts mature for the payment of dividends, but, taking advantage of the regular steam
service under Commonwealth Mail Contract, they purpose planting’ Bananas and other products between
the young Cocoanut trees, and, as these plants mature quickly, profitable business with Australia should
be attained after the second year, probably enabling dividends to be paid, whilst development work would
still be going on at capital cost.
_ A blo , c , k of 10,000 acres of rich agricultural land on the Island of Guadalcanar has been applied for on a
999 lyeais lease, and only awaits the formal approval of the Hig*h Commissioner to be available for work.
A valuable plantation of about 8000 acres at Manning Straits, embracing a number of small islands
partly planted, ha.s been purchased on behalf of the Company. This is one of the best situated properties
in the Solomon Islands, and is looked upon as a very advantageous purchase, both bv reason of its situation
the nature of its soil, the value of the improvements already placed upon it' and the fishing rights’
especially for Turtle Shell, from which an appreciable revenue is expected to be derived.
■ i 4 purchase has also been made of the Island of Tetipari, or Montgomery Island, estimated at
about 40 square miles (25,600 acres), with about 8000 to 10,000 acres suitable for cocoanuts, and the balance
forest country, containing much valuable timber, to be exploited at a convenient time. Other freehold
purchases of land are being negotiated at suitable spots.
The General Management of the Company would be undertaken by Burns, Philp, and Company, Limited,
and attached to the Island Department under the special supervision of Mr. Lucas, the Company’s Island
Manager. With an experienced staff afloat and ashore, and the whole of 8., P. Co.’s organisation working in
harmony to attain success, it is confidently expected that the Solomon Islands Development Company will
be more advantageously placed for efficient and economical working than anv other Island Company could
hope to be. * J
In offering these properties for flotation, the Provisional Directors wish to state that, everything* being*
offered at actual cost, no profit whatever is made by anyone in the formation of the Company, and the
Shareholders will reap the full benefit of the cash purchases made, and of the applications for'lands now
under consideration by the British authorities.

Vic. Premier Bent, in a recent rough-and-
tumble with ex-Minister McCulloch over the
Shepherd’s Push outrage, began to blurt out
things. For instance, he liberated a lot of figures
re “Stonington,” the establishment hired to house
the State Governor, in which, Tommy declares, a
relative of McCulloch’s is interested. Said
Bent :
For the first five years we paid £5850 for rent and rates
for “Stonington,” £10,806 for maintenance, and £302 for
insurance, a total of £16,958. Fancy that lot for five
years.
Yet the Bent Government renewed the “Stoning-
ton ” lease on the same terms. Moreover, Bent is
a thick and thin supporter of the costly and use-
less system of State Governors which makes places
like “Stonington” necessary, and if it had been a
question of the shocking cost of superfluous vice-
royal establishments, you couldn’t have dragged
those figures out of him with a windlass.

The moral rottenness of Yankeedom re-
ceived a fearsome advertisement in the Thaw
case. The fact that a jury could be found to acquit
such a deliberate and premeditated murderer as
Thaw was a fairly surprising circumstance. There
was no doubt as to the killing. It was admitted,
and the jury acquitted the vicious, drink-soaked
degenerate on the ground that he was a lunatic
pure and simple. And that was bad enough.
But when this weird specimen appeared in his
motor car on the way to the asylum the awful
Yankee mob actually cheered him. That was
deplorable. Apparently they reverence irrespon-
sible and homicidal degenerates in New York.
Russia has decided that, for the future,
Russian warships shall be built in Russia. The
Australian papers which report this have told us
a thousand times what a poor, backward, be-
nighted country Russia is. They have also told
us that Australia can’t build warships, so their
real opinion of Australia (which is largely what
they have taught it to be) ought to be worth
reading.

That harmless obscurity, D. R. Hall,
Federal member for Werriwee (N.S.W.), has
made a positive announcement in public that’“the
Federal capital will be in southern N.S.W not
too far from the 100-mile limit from Sydney,’ and
noton the Snowy.” That arrangement will bring it
nicely into Hall’s own electorate, which accounts
fairly well for the prophecy.
Hamer : Usually my sense of locality
is good ; but the other night I lost myself in a
strange street, with houses that bulged over the
pavement and encroached on the roadway in the
distance. I reasoned out the matter, sitting
beneath a lamp-post, and came to the conclusion
that 1 would have to find myself—if 1 went home
rnpi° nt , ', fc might occasion unpleasant com-
mv stZn« d «® b r eBt Wa} \ to do it: was to retrace
mv steps. So I went back to the last pub I
on'™?H bered ’ a, ' d } mmn,ered a t the door. It was
opened suspiciously, and the people were quite
impolite ; but someone told me, in answer to my
inquiry that he had seen me there that night, and
he pointed out the way I had gone. I felt light-
hearted at this and didn't notice the remarks the
people made ; but after some travelling I found
that I was back in the same spot as before. Ap-
parently the people at the pub had misled
me; so 1 explained matters to a police-
man, and he told me that 1 would pro-
bably find myself at home when I got
there He also put me on a tram. I went
against my will, for, knowing myself as I do, I
didn t think he was right. When I woke up the
next morning I was haunted with the idea of
having lost something valuable, and until this
moment I can’t remember what it was. Even
now I don’t know where I found myself, and I
don t like to inquire at home which of us arrived
first. As it is, some nasty remarks have been
made about my coming home late and inquiring
it 1 was home yet; but I don’t know which of us
made the inquiry.
“ Billy T.” : Things got mixed and mud-
dled when I’om, Dick, and Harry took their
wives, daughters, sisters, cousins, and aunts in
surf-bathing by night at St. Kilda during Mel-
bourne s hot spell. The bathers were so thick in
the brine that it was a simple matter to mistake
another fellow’s plump and alluring sweetheart
for your own. One Saturday night a joyous citizen
dived for* a pair of legs in tlie billows,
clutched them, and gaily upended the lady
they belonged to. It was all in die game, but
when the lady floated up squealing, a furious man
in trunks fell on the practical joker, and the
mi fight that ensued beat the ocean into
foam and drew 7000 spectators. The popu-
lar impression was that a whale and a thresher
were having it out. The dripping gladiators were
parted. I thought it was my wife !’’ expostu-
lated the practical joker. “ And I thought it was
mine, explained the assailant with some humility.
In point of fact, the upended female was a stranger
to both.

The Famous Remedy For
BRONCHITIS
CURE
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS.* ASTHMA, & CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of Any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough Difficulty ot
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful an d immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the-thr oat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never beero known to exist where “ Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, sand a Complete Cure is certain.
JtSGWJII’G Of Imitations ! The greai success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling; his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sxPe for an imitation which has none of the benencial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.

Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. „ Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.

Renewal of a
Notable Offer.
Further free week’s test
™| of “Hair Drill.”
There can be no doubt that all Colonial residents greatly appreciated the recent
opportunity provided them for a week's free “ Hair Drill,” for a most significant
reference was made to the very frank offer lately made in the columns of their paper.
This was only to be expected, for it is indeed a deplorable fact that residence in
foreign climes has a very detrimental effect upon the beauty, health, and conditions
of the hair.
Men and women alike who dwell in the Colonies and Dependencies have long grieved
over the fact that the climate and circumstances act very adversely upon the hair, and
that, as a consequence, many scalp and hair defects become quickly apparent and very
pronounced. Unfortunately the use of most of the prevalent specifics is entirely
without benefit, for they are based generally upon vague knowledge of hair requirements
and are generally compounded of ingredients lacking in nutrition and culturative value.
These, whether taken internally or applied externally, have always proved dis-
appointing, and at times injurious both to the head, hair, and health. Still there is
one undoubted application of approved merit and reputation, and it cannot be gainsayed
that Edwards' “ Harlene” is a real hair restorer, a real fault corrector, a real stimulant,
tonic, and preserver for the hair; whether it be affected with dryness, brittleness,
scurfiness, or greasiness ; whether it shows signs of decay or evidenced by lack of lustre,
colour, or healthy and beautiful appearance, or whether its deterioration is marked by
greyness, patchiness, vacuum, or baldness. For many years has Edwards’ “ Harlene ’’
held an envied and unrivalled reputation as a true specific for all untoward conditions of
the hair, and the volume of praise accorded to this notable preparation confirm very
striking testimony from the highest quarter.
Royalties, dignitaries of the State, social leaders, ladies and gentlemen occupying
high positions, as well as the great general public, have used it, and always with the
most gratifying results, for the use of “ Harlene” overcomes any tendency or condition
of hair weakness and disease.
It actually drills and disciplines the hair into healthy condition, and the faith of the
proprietors in their preparation is abundantly shown by the very open offer they recently
made and which now, by popular request, they are repeating.
They are perfectly willing to send any applicant a very generous supply of “ Harlene ”
sufficient for one week's thorough use and trial. The supply is perfectly free and
is accompanied by an interesting booklet dealing with hair difficulties and also full
instructions for the use of ‘ ‘ Harlene. ’' It is only necessary to enclose three penny stamps
foi cover of carriage to Edwards’ “Harlene” Co., 95 and 96 High Holbom, London,
mentioning this paper.
Edwards’ “ Harlene” is of course obtainable of chemists the wide world over.

SHE was a-layin’ a record down ;
Her shafts was singin’ a reckless air.
From Honolu’ to Auckland town
bhe was leggin’ it out like a frightened hare.
And Yankee Bill was loafin’ round,
Oilin’ here and greasin’ there,
When we heard the starboard engine pound,
And stopped her quick with her valves a-blare.
Yankee Bill was lyin’ down,
The thrust-grease stainin’ his ginger hair,
And you could have bought him for half-a-crown—
He was dead as a man could be, I’ll swear.
His trousers caught as the shaft flew round,
And they wasn’t the sort of stuff to tear.
His head bumped twice with a funny sound—
It gave the “ third ” a bit of a scare ;
For she was a-layin’ a record down,
And there wasn’t time for a big repair—
From Honolu’ to Auckland town
She legged it out like a hunted hare.
There’s other greasers loafin’ round,
Oilin’ here and greasin’ there,
And when Bill’s wanted he’ll be found
1' athoms deep ; and Bill don’t care !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JACK FORRESTER sat on a canvas chair on
his wide verandah, staring moodily out
across the home paddock. A quarter of a
mile away the white gate leading on to the main
road shone dully in the moonlight. A hundred
yards along the road to the right his eye mechani-
cally noted the white bridge crossing the creek. The
night was warm and sweet. The July rains had
been opportune, and all green things could almost
be heard growing. But Jack Forrester had the look
of a hunted man. He was saying to himself this
evening that he was nearing the parting of the
ways. He would shortly be facing the world a
dishonored man, with the mud of divorce pro-
ceedings hanging to his clothes, or he would have
shut down for ever on a love affair which
he had suspicions was several sizes too
large for him. He glanced at his watch—9
o’clock. Eight hours ago he was saying to him-
self, as he slipped the saddle on the chestnut,
that he would not call at Seven Oaks. And he
had spent a long afternoon with her at the corner
of the Seven Oaks verandah. Eight hours ago !
Eight months ago he had not met her, and he
thought, and everyone, including Effie Caldwell,
thought, that he was going to marry Effie Cald-
well. When the Crofts bought Seven Oaks, the
news travelled Brewarrina way, ahead of them,
and by that marvellous system of wireless tele-
graphy antedating Edison, Peter Croft’s reputation
preceded him. “What sort of a man is he?”
Forrester remembered asking Casey, of the
Royal. “ Man, why he isn’t a man, he’s a boozer.
Drunk when he got here, drunk next day when
he started to drive to Seven Oaks, and his wife
as pretty as a picture. They do say he’s got
plenty of money, and they’ve only taken the place
to see if keeping away from his Sydney friends ’ll
sober him up. But when a man’s that fond of
it —well, you know, Mr. Forrester.”
Jack called a few days after they were installed,
and found Croft had driven to the township for
the day. Nora Croft certainly deserved the
eulogy of the Royal’s landlord. The afternoon
was blazing hot, and she was dressed in white and
looked about twenty-two. Her slim figure did
not droop, and she seemed cheerful, but Jack
could notice traces of recent tears, and even on
their first meeting an ardent championship of her
formed in his mind. He thought of her a lot
more than he would have acknowledged to him-
self, during the next day or two, and in the vague
hope of seeing her at church, he rode into town
on the Sunday. Croft and his wife were there.
Jack was introduced, and went home to
dinner with them. Croft was a moody, quiet
man, and he and Forrester were not congenial.
But Nora and Jack found their minds
and thoughts complementary. Neither, it
appeared, lived by bread alone, and when Jack
rose to go, the answering light in her eyes showed
him that the dawn of his passion for her was
calling to the dawn of her passion for him. And
the intimacy had deepened through the months —
sometimes imperceptibly—sometimes with giant
strides. He remembered a note from her, asking
him to dinner to meet some Sydney friends who
were to spend a few days at Seven Oaks. It
began “ Dear Jack,” and then the “Jack” was
written over and “Mr. Forrester” substituted.
He remembered her blush when he showed her
the note and asked her to say and write “Jack”
always. In the presence of Peter Croft she kept
to the more formal title, with an understanding
look at him which filled him with mingled shame
and pleasure.
So far, the intimacy was innocent enough,
but the gulf was beginning to yawn before
him. This very afternoon she had reached
the stage of telling him how derelict her
life was, linked to a drunkard. Sober, her
husband, though gloomy and taciturn, was kind ;
but in liquor he was unmanageable, and threatened
to strike her. Plis violence had always, fortu-
nately, stopped at threats. Jack’s heart burned
at the recital of her wrongs. When it was time
for him to go, she accompanied him down the
path, and just when the house was hidden from
sight round a bend, he threw discretion to
the winds, jumped from his horse, and,
taking her in his arms, kissed her with
hot protestations of love. Now in the sweet,
warm August night he sat hunted by his thoughts.
The saddest thought of all was that his soul was
too small for a big passion. If his love were
a vast, compelling, engulfing force, he felt that he
would take Nora from her home and live down
the obloquy. He was rational enough even to
remember the comparative shortness of the world’s
memory. Some new sensation would quickly
replace this scandal, and a thirsty society would
hurriedly refresh at the latest spring of boiling
mud. That he loved her was certain. His
closest self-examination failed to shake this con-
viction. Did he love her well enough? Could
he face disgrace with Nora, unable to live without
her, or would the forces of respectability and
laziness (he noted with a curious sense of detach-
ment that he was not small enough to deceive
himself with any canting use of the w'ord
morality ”) be too strong ? And the hunted
look remained between his eyes. It was the first
big issue Jack Forrester had had to face. It was
the swelling of his Jordan. The full flood was
not yet.
Suddenly his ear caught the sound of buggy
wheels and a horse coming fast. It was from "the
direction of Seven Oaks. Jack sprang to his feet
and gazed down the road. There was one occu-
pant of the buggy. It was she. Running at his
best, he reached the white gate just as she drew
alongside. With the thought that she had come
to him in some need strongest in his mind, he
climbed into the buggy and flung his arms round
her.
“ Nora, my dear girl, what has happened ? ”
Overwrought, she burst into tears, and it w'as
some time before he could get the details. Croft
had reached Seven Oaks in a state of savage
drunkenness, and, after smashing a lot of furni-
ture, had started to beat her. The w : hole thing
had occupied less than ten minutes. Managing
to elude him, she had escaped out of the house,
and found the groom just taking the horse out of
the trap. Quickly harnessing up again, she had
started to drive the eight miles w'hich separated
Seven Oaks from Baroolba. She had been
delayed two hours, a mile and a half from Seven
Oaks, as the horse went quite lame just after
passing the Cross Roads, and at the wine shop
they had no horse that she could borrow. The
widow s thieving son had, however, kindly w'alked
to Brown’s, a mile back, and borrowed a horse.
But at that time of night the whole thing caused a
great fuss, and two hours were frittered away
before she started again. Even then the bor-
rowed horse was slow and old.
Jack Forrester began to reflect anew. The die
was cast now with a vengeance. He loved her,
and Fate had literally thrown her into his arms.
He had not even the barrier of friendship to stay
his hand, as he had never liked Croft. And yet
he hesitated to open the gate and drive up to
the house—hesitated so long that Nora was
chilled a little and said, “Jack, you’re not glad
I came to you.” The unnerving tears assisted the
trembling words. His hesitancy disappeared,
and he took her in his arms again, and murmured
that henceforth he would love and protect her.
Before he had time to get down and open the
gate, a sinister sound broke the still night—the
sound rf a horse coming at a hard gallop.
Forrest :r stood at the buggy horse’s head as Peter
Croft, sobered and humbled by his midnight ride,
ranged alongside.
“Well, Forrester, I don’t know how to look
you in the face. I suppose Nora has told you
how I treated her to-night. Before God, I didn’t
know what I was doing. I sobered up very
quickly, and when I came round the servants tsld
me ; but I could see—the dining-room was a
wreck. I knew instinctively she'd come to you,
Forrester. You and she seem to hit it off together.
Nora”—he suddenly turned to the white-faced
woman in the buggy—“ Nora, give me another
chance. Although you must nearly hate me now,
we used to be . . . a lot. . . to each other . . .
before—before I became a beast.”
There was silence. Croft had ended his appeal
with no dramatic force. His stumbling words had
got more halting and slow, and finally stopped.
The silence was like to that in a room where
someone is drifting from unconsciousness to death.
It was the swelling of Jordan for Forrester, and
he did not speak. Hell seemed planted in his
breast, for he could not deceive himself into
believing that any moral code silenced him. It
was the entrenched respectability of the day and
the fear of public opinion.
Nora broke the silence by saying in a hard, dry
voice, “We will drive home, Peter.” Forrester
took Croft’s horse from him, and Peter clambered
into the buggy again, protesting his thanks. As
he did so Nora hissed tw'o words in Forrester’s
ear :
“ You cur ! ”
With a good-night from Croft the buggy drove
off, and Forrester slowly opened the w'hite gate.

A Modern Eden.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ADAM was tall and handsome, and absurdly
rich ; withal a decent fellow, who sought
his pleasures in the open.
Eve was a spoilt little girl, with a pretty face
and a perfect figure. These were the gifts of her
mother. From her father she inherited an “ eye
for the main chance.”
Eve didn’t love Adam. She didn’t love any-
one but Eve. But Eden was a beautiful pro-
perty, and the fruit on the Big Tree in the midst
thereof looked- tempting ; so when Adam wanted
his Rib back, she returned it.
They were happy for a time in the shade of the
Big Tree, for Eden was a beautiful estate, and
the weather was propitious. The wind sighed
softly through the gum trees, and Cain came.
Eve grew tired of the Garden. Her soul
yearned for a motor-car. Adam abhorred motor-
cars. But the Serpent was an admirable chauffeur,
and interested her immensely. He was so dif-
ferent from Adam. ,
Cain was rising four.
Adam sought solace in the arms of Kitty.
Kitty was the exquisite barmaid. She said it was
a shame the way Eve neglected him, and she
accepted his presents —reluctantly.
Then the Voice of the Law was heard in the
Garden, startling the birds in the cool of the
morning.
Adam married the barmaid, and drank steadily
ever afterwards. Eve went to the Devil.
Now, if Adam had only had a steady job !

MR. A. J. COOMBS, of Cowper Road, St.
Albans, N.Z., who, as a young man, had
a purpose in life, and is now enjoying the
fruits of his labors, suffered terribly with his
Liver for six long years. He sought the advice
of seven different doctors, all of whom failed in
their endeavors to cure him. Below he gives
a graphic account of his suffering and ultimate
restoration to joyous health by Bile Beans
for Biliousness.
“ For some six years I suffered from Liver
Complaint in an aggravated form,” says Mr.
Coombs. “ I have spent so much money, con-
sulted so many Doctors, and tried so many
‘ cures ’ in my vain endeavors to get rid of my
trouble, that I think it only my duty to
inform you of the wonderful cure Bile
Beans have wrought in me. lam a man
who has worked very hard in my young
days and made money, and when at last
I had everything I could wish for, to be
affected by Liver Complaint was, as you can imagine, a great blow to me. I was treated
by seven different Doctors, and spent a large amount of money, but derived only
temporary relief, and was told I should never be cured. It was at this juncture that a
friend advised me to try Bile Beans as a last resource. But I, like a great many
sufferers who had tried other so-called cures in vain, had but little faith in Bile Beans.
However, my friend purchased a box of the Beans, and induced me to undergo a course.
I am pleased to say that after persevering to the extent of ten boxes, I find myself
thoroughly cured. lam now able to enjoy life, and shall be pleased to give par-
ticulars of my case and cure to anyone who may be suffering, as I consider it my duty to
let others know of the great virtues of Bile Beans, a restoration to health after so
long an illness being a blessing I cannot be too thankful for.”
After all else failed, Bile Beans cured Mr. Coombs with signal success.
Composed of Nature’s own vegetable roots and herbs, Bile Beans are
the world’s most successful remedy for biliousness, indigestion, headache,
constipation, piles, debility, female ailments, bad blood and breath, and
all disorders of the functions of the liver, stomach, or digestive organs.

Ladies in the Shed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE bookkeeper walks down the board
smiling unpleasantly. “ Ladies coming,”
he says, and passes on. A low muttering
runs along the line of bent and sweating men.
The Dandy finishes his sheep and makes a move
for his coat. There is a rent in his shirt that is
almost indecent, and he is a sensitive man.
“ Anybody got a flower to put in’Arold’s coat ? ”
a man asks plaintively. “Oh, ’Arold, yer naughty
boy ! ” he admonishes, gently, “ you never shaved
yerself! ” The Dandy flushes painfully, but
forces a laugh. High-pitched voices in a chorus of
emphasised words are heard approaching. The
boss, yarning on some wool-packs, darts for a
back door, but is too late. A fluffy charmer,
seventeen or thereabouts, addresses excitedly the
tail of his greasy old coat. “ Oh, Mr. Sheep-
shanks,” she yells—“ dear Mr. Sheepshanks, we
saw you ! Come back, we want to be weighed !”
The boss turns, and asks shamefacedly to be
excused ; he says he has never been so busy
in his life. “Norman,” he calls to a
good-looking boy at the woolpress, “ the ladies
want to be weighed.” The fluffy charmer pouts ;
her mother frigidly raises her pince-nez. Mr. Sheep-
shanks murmurs explanatory words, ‘ ‘ Gentle-
man, experience, quite nice.” Fluff dimples ;
her mother thaws.
Norman approaches, smiling pleasantly. ‘ ‘ Want
to be weighed ? ” he asks, in business-like tones.
“Who’s first?” The two raw youths at the
press, new at the game, have stopped work.
Their jaws are hanging loose ; they are exchang-
ing glances and guffawing loudly at Fluff’s imbe-
cile remarks. An impatient man sticks his head
through an aperture. “ We’re smothering here
in this d—d stuff. Why the h — don’t you get
that blanky bale out ? Where’s Norman ? ”
He observes the ladies, and dives back into the
wool. Fluff gets on the scales, and looks coyly at
Norman. She decides that he is worth flirting
with, and forthwith proceeds to enslave him.
Norman, knowing that the youths at the press are
watching and listening closely, is extremely miser-
able. In the course of half-an-hour or so, he con-
vinces each lady that she really and truly is the
weight he says she is. “Yes! the scales are quiie
correct. No ! there is nothing wrong with the
weights —afraid it would take too long to show
them how to weigh themselves. If they will come
in one day after Christmas he will have time
—yes, he’s always about. Yes ; only too pleased.”
Scowling men are stamping in, gazing furiously
at the still and silent press, and going away again.
Norman asks one of them if he’s seen the boss.
The man only mutters and turns on his heel.
Norman conducts the ladies towards the shearers.
“ Yes, machine-shearing. Would they like to
see the workings ?—yes, down there. Oh yes, they
have to sharpen them every now and then. Yes,
they do buzz a bit, but you get used to it.” Fluff
comes level with him, and gazej through her eye-
lashes into his fine young face. They are passing
down the line of shearers. Norman knows what
the shearers are thinking. His misery increases,
and the red shows through his tan. Fluff’s
mamma, with silken skirts upraised, and heels
tapping, sails haughtily along, followed closely by
Fluff’s young sister, a damsel of bouncing habit,
who thinks she knows it all. Norman pens the
party near the ringer, and close to the Dandy. He
explains that they must leave a clear space for the
shearer to pass through, and hastily goes press-
wards. Fluff transfers her attentions to the
nervous Dandy.
“ Isn’t he a dear ! ” she gushes audibly. “ So in
the picture, so bushy.”
“Sylvia” (plaintively), “do you think his
name is Bill ? I should so love it to be Bill.
Shouldn’t you ? ”
The amiable Sylvia, with the spirit of the bush
strong upon her, addresses the blushing Dandy
stridently. “ Say, old chap,” she inquires, “is
your name Bill ? ” The Dandy, grinning idioti-
cally, bends lower over his sheep and quite by
accident cuts it. Sylvia’s mamma agitatedly drops
her skirts.
“ Sylvia ; I positively—”
“Oh ring off, mother,” exclaims the up-to-
date Sylvia. “ This is the bush. When in Rome,
you know.”
The ringer, a stern-faced man, a very excellent
citizen with a sensible wife at home, pushes past
the group, and returns at once with a kicking sheep.
“ How quick he is ! ” gushes Fluff. “ Dear Mrs.
Billyard, isn’t he too lightning-like, and
never cuts them once !” The ringer, self-conscious,
his eyes blinded by sweat and his hands swollen
with thistles, gashes his sheep’s throat. “ Tar !
tar ! ” he snaps out, and, muttering a curse, looks
round for the man on the board.
The Dandy, in his joy at the faultless ringer’s
slip, ventures on a comforting remark. ‘ ‘ It’s ten
bob off your cheque, Mick—there ain’t nothing on
him to eat. ” Fluff screams, the girleen is mutter-
ing ‘ ‘ cruel brute. ” Her mamma says ‘ ‘ shocking ”
several times. Fluff looks through her fingers at
the bleeding sheep. “ Dear Mrs. Billyard,
take me away,” she wails, “ oh, take me away.”
The exasperated ringer, an independent member
of an independent class, lifts his head, and in
pungently cutting tones tenders some advice.
“For Heaven’s sake, dear Mrs. Billyard,”
he says, “take her away. Take her away,” he
finishes viciously, “ and drown her.”
Fluffs mamma, with icy hauteur, sails out of the
pen. “Evelyn! Sylvia!” she commands, and
the party with damped enthusiasm leaves by the
nearest door. The Dandy, sighing relievedly,
removes his coat. The shearers —all but the
angry ringer—grin consumedly. The boss emerges
from behind some loose timber. Work proceeds
at fever-heat. Everything is as it was.

Eugene Lee Hamilton has a noteworthy
sonnet sequence, titled “ Mimma Bella,” in
the November Fortnightly. It is an “In
Memoriam ” of a child. Hamilton, who
passes his life paralysed with a cerebro-
spinal malady, has done good poetic work,
the best of it in sonnet form. As a speci-
men of his latest poem :
The Americo-phobia of the American
magazines breaks out occasionally in humor-
less patches. Lately it has been Abraham
Lincoln ; we’ve had Lincoln in every possible
position and place ; in the Christmas
Harper’s he figures in a short story, with
four illustrations of his grotesque ugliness ;
bub it has been left for the usually sober
McClure’s to show us Lincoln in a bath.
Abraham Lincolns Rum Sweat is the
title of a profusely illustrated article. It
appears that during his presidential cam-
paign Lincoln was “ run down ” ; and a full
description of a vapor bath that he took is
given under the stirring caption, “ How
Mrs. Floyd’s Rum Sweat Saved the Cam-
paign.” There is a stimulating picture of
Abraham sitting in a blanket. Now, we
shall doubtless see an article about “The
Pill that Made a President.”
The new monthly International (Unwin),
which claims to be a review of the world’s
progress, has “ a permanent staff of 250 cor-
respondents scattered all over the globe,”
and a few are presumably scattered over
Australia. Katherine Pritchard sums up
“ Australian Literature ” in one paragraph,
which merely patriotically implies that we
have no literature. Katherine seems to
overlook the fact, among others, that
Australasia has at present a body of poets
whose work, on the whole, surpasses the poetic
stufi being turned out annually by England.
And below her article is more than a page
devoted to “The Negro Poets of Hayti.”
This is hard. The International is as dull
as most of the other London monthlies.
'Tis Christmas, and we gaze with downbent head
On something that the post has brought too
late v
To reach thee, Mimma, through the narrow gate,
From one that did not know that thou art dead ;
A picture-book, to play with on thy bed ;
And we, who should have heard thee laugh and
prate
So busily, sit here at war with Fate,
And turn the pages silently instead.
Oh, that I knew thee playing ’neath God’s eyes,
With the small souls of all the dewy flowers
That strewed thy grave, and died at Autumn’s
breath;
Or with the phantom of the doll that lies
Beside thee for Eternity’s long hours,
In the dim nursery that men call Death !
Lo, through the open window of the room
That was her nursery, a small, bright spark
Comes wandering in, as falls the Summer dark,
And with a measured flight explores the gloom,
As if it sought, among the things that loom
Vague in the dusk, for some familiar mark,
And, like a light on some wee unseen bark,
It tacks in search of who knows what or whom.
I know ’tis but a fire-fly ; yet its flight,
So straight, so measured, round the empty bed,
Might be a little soul’s that night sets free ;
And as it nears, I feel my heart grow tight
With something like a superstitious dread,
And watch it breathless, lest it should be she.

U the best Preservative Paint for Iron, Steel, Timber, Bricks, Stone or Cement. All colors in stock. The only Paint which thoroughly adheres to Galvanised Iron. It withstands Acids, Salt Spray, etc., and does
%“e^ W t*nTwUh^FKßl^D0 P R" eB will last longer than two paintings with any other paint. Galvanised Iron painted every four years with “Ferrodor” would be practically everlasting.
t yF.Yt.ritr.ts from a few of many Testimonials received :
MARYBOROUGH GAS & COKE CO., Maryborough, Q.— We have used “ Ferrodor ” over five years for our Gas
Holders, and prefer it to other good and highly-recommended paints.
8. L. FURNER, Ceneral Storekeeper, Coulburn, N.S.W.— After four years’wear the Ferrodor on my stores
at Captain’s Flat seems as good as ever. It is the only paint which has given me satisfaction on
Galvanised Iron. . ,
80UTH0N BROS., Contractors, Waratah, N.S.W.— We consider “ Ferrodor the best paint we have ever used.
The covering capacity is enormous—about 1000 square yards per cwt.
Br. A. E. FITZPATRICK, Crookwell, N.S.W.— Any person one - using “ Ferrodor ” will use no other paint,
j, p. FRANK!, Mart’s Dock & Engineering Co., Sydney.— “ Ferrodor ” stands heat and exposure, and remains
firm and intact. It does not crack or scale off, and covers more surface than ordinary paints.
MELROSE & FENWICK, Townsville, Q.— “Ferrodor” has proved fax ahead of anything previously used,
although the climate and salt air is very severe on such goods. . ■ i . y
C. PHILLIPS, Civil Engineer, Brisbane, Q. —“ Ferrodor ” forms a close, hard and tenaceous skin, which neither
cracks’nor chips off. It appears to become part and parcel of the metal itself, probably due to some
chemical affinity between the base of “Ferrodor” and the metal.
LAUNCESTON CAS CO., Launceston, Tasmania.— We have used “Ferrodor” for some five years on our Gas
Holders and Connections, Condensers, Washers, etc., and have found it better than anything tried
previously. It stands remarkably well, and resists the action of ammonia splendidly. j:
INTERNATIONAL LICHTiNC ASSOCIATION, Hay, N.S.W. — I have used “ Ferrodor” on weatherboard cottages and
other work, and find it the best paint I have used. It covers well and finishes a nice surface.
Amongst Many other Works “ FERRODOR ” has been used on the following
