NOTTINGHAM'S FANOUS WOLLATON HALL
T'HIS magnificent Renaissance mansion, standing in a beautifully wooded
-*- park three miles from Nottingham, has been described as the most
remarkable architectural caprice of the early 16th century. The building was
ft? year “nisi«
from Lincolnshire on the backs of mules. The architects of Wollaton wire
Robert Smithson and John Thorpe, and the building is reputed to have 365
windows, one for each day of the year.
The mansion, which is of two storeys, is built in the form of a square,
surmounted by a central massive tower with four circular turrets. At each ■
corner a three-storeyed tower projects from the main building, crowned with
gables which are reminiscent of the Dutch style. These four towers, which
are the predominant features of the house, are ornamented with twelve
columns with Doric, lonic and Corinthian capitols. Circular niches on the
liner surfaces of these towers contain various busts, while the empty niches
fere provided to contain further examples of Roman antiques which were
lost in a shipwreck on the way from Italy. The Great Hall, which is over
50 feet high, contains a fine stone screen, .but the interior of the building con-
tains little else of artistic or architectural importance.

In 1711 the second son and heir of Sir Francis Willoughby was created

one hundred thousand acres, yielded an annual revenue of £54,000.
The present Lord Middleton, who is the eleventh holder of the title,
succeeded in 1924. In 1925 Wollaton Hall was purchased by the Corporation
of Nottingham and is now used as a Natural History Museum.

AN ADRIAN FEINT BOOK.
It is odd that neither Sydney Ure
Smith, who contributes a short foreword
to Adrian Feint Flower Paintings (Ure
Smith Pty. Ltd.), nor Tatlock Miller, who
has a well-written and informative
essay on the painting of flowers,
comments on the artist’s habit of arrang-
ing his flowers in sea-shells.
Flowers, after all, do not grow in
shells ; nor are clams or whelks custom-
arily used as vases. Yet anybody
acquainted with Adrian Feint’s curious
and attractive paintings will recall him
not so much as a painter of flowers as a
painter of flowers in shells ; and, in fact,
out of a total of 46 color-plates, black-
and-white reproductions and colored pen-
drawings in the present volume, 14 are
concerned with whatever practical,
mystical or purely aesthetic relation there
may be between the discarded habitation
of a shellfish and a rose, a jonquil or a
tulip.
An oblique reference to the subject may
be detected, perhaps in Sydney Ure
Smith’s reference to Feint’s “exquisite
arrangement” of flowers ; and Mr. Miller,
detaching himself for a moment from
Persian carpets and from Chinese flower-
portraits “deeper [tut!] than anything a
European flower-painting may hold,”
steps briefly—during the course of an in-
teresting paragraph on Feint’s methods—
to the seashore;
Adrian Feint, as this book so clearly
mirrors, takes his initial impetus and first
inspiration from such of those early Dutch
masters as de Heem, Van Huysum and
Rachel Ruysch. His eye is as observant
as theirs, his expression as precise. His is
no quantitative concern; his care is as
meticulous and his decorative quality can
be equally fine. One need only look at
such of his paintings as “Tulips and
Azaleas” and “Arrangement in Red” to
realise this.
At work, as they before him, he suffers
the practical difficulties of procuring blooms
in and out of season. Lacking his own
garden he must beg, borrow or steal. He
must work fast before his models wither
and die, so procures and works from single
blooms, each flower painted separately and
singly. With as careful a concern as Kalf
he collects his china, glass and silver,
Staffordshire dogs and Chelsea figures, his
shells from beaches along the coast.
The brevity of these references, and the
apparent acceptance of the shell device
as purely arbitrary and aesthetic, may be
significant: suggesting that whatever
symbolism, conscious or unconscious, the
paintings are intended to convey has
eluded these highly sympathetic observers.
Or, of course, the fact may be simply
that the writers were content to deal only
with the surface aspect of Feint’s work,
the purely decorative quality which shows
most strikingly in the colored pen-draw-
ings.
But the symbolism, if it exists, is vital
to the proper understanding of Adrian
Feint’s art; and, looking through the
book, there is a strong impression that a
symbolic intention does indeed underlie
it. In happy moods the shells seem to
represent a kind of flower of the sea, as
the white-sailed yachts that figure in
many of the backgrounds are a kind of
flower of the Harbor. In such a paint-
ing as “Carnival Night” the whole earth
and sky are in flower, but in sombre
flower. There is something macabre as
well as decorative in these paintings.
As far as memory serves and as the
plates reveal, Adrian Feint is not con-
cerned with the glowing and iridescent
colors sometimes to be found in shells,
but rather with their shapes, their spirals
and involutions, sometimes beautiful,
sometimes weird. He is interested, too, in
shells decayed and broken, doubly dead,
as it were. And, for further evidence of
the trend towards the macabre, one may
note the faintly sinister depictions of
crabs and insects, the harsh and sea-worn
dead cone of a banksia, and some of the
decayed and broken tree-stumps beloved
of the dead-end-kid school of contem-
porary landscapists. And again, giving
the work as a whole a perceptible
emotional unity even when dead objects
are not present, the landscapes of harbor
and country and the wild skies of
“Carnival Night” and “Floral Adventure”
have much of the nightmarish look
typical of surrealism.
Against this weird, macabre, dead
earth, Adrian Feint, at his best, as m
“Floral Adventure” and “Happy Land-
ing,” sets in contrast glowing color; pink
and. scarlet hibiscus, white daisies, the
crimson of spider-flowers and native
fuschia, a red-gold marigold, rich tufts of
bottlebrush. Clearly, he is painting the
contrast between life and death: his
flowers are light and life and gaiety
springing from an earth gloomy, decay-
ing and sinister.
The painter’s reaction to the eternal
duality is sensitive but limited. He has
an original approach to the art of flower-
painting, but he repeats his originality
until it wears thin. He paints brave
color, but the threat of disaster over-
shadows it—even when the menace is no
more than the twist of ribbon in “Happy
Landing,” flung strangely into the air to
look like blood or lightning. Perhaps be-
cause of this emotional atmosphere, per-
haps for some technical reason, the
flower-forms, though perfect in drawing,
are not quite the fresh blossoms of
nature. The massy richness of the Dutch
masters, not to be dismissed as a mere
“quantitative concern,” is lacking.
Though the repetition somewhat mars
the effect (compare Plate 1 with Plate 7
and Plate 22) the work, because it is dis-
tinctive, is well worth having in book
form, and the publishers have dealt hand-
somely with it. There are 12 color-plates,
16 flower-pieces in monochrome and 18
of the colored pen-drawings. Type,
paper and binding are as tasteful as one
would expect in a book dedicated to the
memory of Ben Waite, of Waite and Bull,
who was a collector and connoisseur of
paintings as well as a distinguished
printer. The edition kof 1500 signed
copies.
A Child of Nature.
Ivan Cankar’s The Bailiff Yernery
(Pushkin Press), translated from the
SloVene by Sidonie Yeras and H. C.
Sewell Grant, carries an impressive intro-
duction by one Janko Lavrin, who ex-
plains that the Slovenes, numbering a
million and a half, were formerly incor-
porated in Austria-Hungary, becoming
part of the Yugoslavian conglomeration
after 1918. Not until roughly a hundred
years ago did they 1 have a stabilised
literary language.
Under Austro-Hungarian rule, says
Janko Lavrin, the Slovenes were divided
into six administrative units, the inten-
tion being “to prevent even such a tiny
national body from forming an intense
consciousness or an independent culture
of their own.” Whatever may be the'
political facts of the case, a slight dis-
crepancy appears in Lavrin’s argument in
that the two “great” figures he names- in
Slovene literature, the poet Fran Presh-
eren and the playwright and novelist
Cankar (pronounced, fortunately, Tsan-
kar), both made their reputations under
the Austro-Hungarian regime, Presheren
having lived from 1800 to 1849 and Can-
kar from 1876 to 1918.
If there is any inconsistency, however,.
in his theory on the relationship between
literature and politics, Lavrin ignores it
and proceeds to give an interesting ac-
count of Cankar’s writings:
He started as an iconoclast. So much
so that the entire first edition of his
“impious” poems was bought up by the
Archbishop of Ljubljana and burned at the
stake. But this only made him more aggres-
sive and caustic. His youthful Book for
Easygoing People fell like a bombshell
among the complacent Slovene intelli-
gentsia. So did his plays, such as “Jacob
Ruda,” “For People’s Weal,” “Corruption
in the Valley of St. Florian” and “The
King of Betajnova,” not to mention his
other works in which he cracks the whip
like an expert. He achieved something
similar to what Bernard Shaw did in Eng-
land, even if Cankar’s laughter is nearer the
laughter of Gogol than that of Shaw.
After this) fanfare The Bailiff Yerney
creeps very modestly into view. It is an
extremely simple tale, or, rather, parable,
advising agricultural laborers to burn
down the houses of their employers.
Yerney, a demented old person who has
served the family of Sitar for 40 years,
conceives the not altogether original
notion that he, jvho has worked the land,
is the rightful owner of it. When, upon
old Sitar’s death, he invites young Sitar
to kneel and salute him as his master,
young Sitar sacks him. Yerney then
wanders raving through the land, seeking
“justice” and demanding from the local
Mayor, from the Courts, from the Em-
peror and finally from a priest that his
right to the property should be recog-
nised. When all fail him, he burns Sitar’s
house to the ground and is thrown, into
the flames by the villagers.,
Janko Lavrin, in retrospect, since he
declares' that Cankar has dissolved propa-
ganda in art, seems to be of that unfortu-
nate tribe of partisan critics who write the
opposite of what they really mean: for
it is painfully obvious, in the portrayal
of all the characters except Yerney as
villains, in the failure to dramatise the
mad old man as a human being, and in
the frequent references to Yerney’s “Cal-
vary” that Cankar has, in fact, dissolved
art in propaganda. The story, though
bloody-minded, is' bloodless; thin and
repetitive. Cankar may be conceded the
charm of a childish simplicity; but, for
v ompa r i son with- Chekhov, Janko
Lavrin should blush.
Fairy Wrens.
It appears from A. H. Chisholm’s
■’airy Wrens (F. W. Cieshire Pty., Ltd.)
i hat the prevalence of polygamy among
wrens has been considera ily overstated.
And whether that information comes as
a relief or a mild disappointment, those
v/ho are interested in stair matters will
find M - iChisholm worth
True * ihe admits, the mtleman with
e blue head is often att ded by a bevy
of brown birds which • pear to con-
fute Ms “elfin harem,” Jut the young
ole wrpn lacks his blue .eathers in his
fancy ra id the “harem” probably the
unity. And a devoted family it is:
Chisholm quotes evidence to show
iiat “these birds usuaJy have two or
three broods in a season, id members of
the early families always assist in the
feeding of the newcomers ”
Family devotion provides Mr. Chis-
holm with a charming and touching
anecdote fof the feeding of an imprisoned
male wren by four brown birds who
afterwards ‘sorrowed over his body”;
and when' he passes on to nesting habits
there is an oJcuy of communal living
ch suggests that even the race of
ted by the scarcity of labor
and the nigh, cost of building materials:
I reci* . <oc reading a story of two male
Hue wrens and two brown birds building
one nest ; three eggs were laid and the two
brown birds took turn about at brooding,
and .the three babies were fed by all four
adults. It is difficult to explain this novelty,
but certainly there was no polygamy in the
arrangement.
Told in the form of a dialogue. Fairy
Wrens covers it; subject comprehen-
sively and very readably. It goes far
back into lime to depict a migration of
small brown birds from New Guinea,
then discusses in a pleasingly poetical way
—Mr. Chisholm seems inclined to give
just as much credit to “fairies” as to
evolution—the miracle that turned these
undistinguished creatures into Blue
Vrens, Splendid Wrens, Turquoise
/Vrens, Barrow Island’s black-and-white,
ren that looks like a “tiny magpie,”
lack-backed, Blue-and-White and Lilac-
crowned Wrens . . . into 14 differently-
colored species l , 75 per cent, of which are
hidden away in the Interior.
a ewes on me first records of
- wrens by white men; Captain Cook’s
assistant-surgeon, William Ellis; the
French naturalists Quoy and Gaimard ;
and, of course, Gould and Gilbert;
after which there are direct observations
of the birds by the author and other
devotees. One anecdote gives an ex-
quisite picture of a wren and a robin
perching together, blue and crimson, in
a dry bush; another, mentioning that
wrens will sling at night, describes a
“singing competition” at night between
a woman contralto and a blackbird ; and
another, which seems to sum up per-
fectly the fairy wren as a spark of light
and life, describes “a strange case of a
nest woven into a bullock’s skull that
chanced to hang in a bush; the birds
entered and left through an eyehole.”
"He Lived in My Shoes."
_
He Lived In My Shoes (Australasian
Publishing Co.), by Leslie Greener, is
something new in autobiography. Greener
prefaces the book with a brief explana-
tion: —
Each of us has a second self—the fellow
we really believe we are: the smart one
who always has an answer ready; the
handsome one who could have got the girl;
the courageous one who would have
tell the story. It was a surprising expert-
ment. He set down what turned out to be
the reverse side of my youth— a vastly
merrier affair than the obverse side that I
emem er.
It was a surprising expenment-and
entertaining. From the tune m South
Africa when, aged seven. Alter Pluverd,
Greener’s alter ego, at a title-fishing
dinner given by his father, fills the Gov-
ernor’s salt-cellar with sherbert (“the
whole plateful of soup lathered up in an
instant like a barberV bowl”) to the
richly Rabelaisian description of the out-
of-school homework of his house-master,
a pillar of probity caught by Alter’s study-
mates at an hotel with another master’s
wife, the book skips divertingly from
dream to dream fulfilled.
Unjustly expelled, Alter sails a fishing
dinghy across the ■ Channel to Brittany ;
meets a girl and woos her like Casanova ;
returns hailed like Columbus and walks
arm in arm with the school captain;
graduates into Army Intelligence in
World War I, is wounded, and, recovered,
walks privileged and alone through the
clamoring mob into the back-stage dres-
sing-room of the Toast of London.
A mere recital of accomplishments
would pall. But Alter meets trouble
aplenty, and fulfils his dreams only by
the exercise of that courageous ingenuity
inherent in all our second selves. Though
at times the humor is hard-driven —as
the book was written in Changi Camp,
where Greener finished as a real Intelli-
gence Officer of the Eighth Division,
this is understandable —Alter’s other self„
could with profit dwell a book-length
longer in his shoes.
Australian Encyclopaedia.
A completely revised and enlarged
edition of the Australian Encyclopedia
is to be published by Angus and Robert-
son. •
The Encyclopedia, on which the pub-
lishers spent £30,000, was originally issued
in 1925 in two volumes with 1500 pages
written by 200 contributors. It has been
out of print for some years and second-
hand copies are valued at well above the
original published price.
The new edition, which, fully illustrated,
will run to several volumes, will be the
biggest enterprise of its kind ever under-
taken in Australia. It will discuss de-
velopments in science, education, the arts,
commerce and government, and a section
will deal with the Second World War.
The editor-in-chief will be Mr. A. H.
Chisholm, who will be assisted by an
advisory board.
The production will take several years.
The public, meanwhile, is invited to assist
“by criticising the original edition, and
by suggesting new subjects for inclusion.”
Reviewed Briefly.
This page has already expressed its
high regard for Ray Robinson’s Between
Wickets, an enlarged edition of which
has now been issued by Collins. The
book also received from overseas critics
the praise it merits, typical of them James
Agate: “One of the best books ever
written about the national game. Open
it anywhere and it is immensely exciting. ’
Fade into Murder: Samuel Holmes
(Shakspeare Head). One of those tough
detective novels in which the hero, who
writes in the first person, says things like
this: “I let him think during the time it
took for me to get leisurely to my feet.
Then I kicked him hard on the kneecap.”
The gentleman also drinks a good deal of
gin. Murders take place in and around
film studios.
lan H. Driscoll's Winged Journey
(Christopher Johnson, Ltd.), with 35
photographs and three maps, tells the
story of airways in the British Common-
wealth, both from their genesis in 1919
and from the passenger’s window. The
historical story is clearly told, but the !
author, whether beside the St. Lawrence
River or in the neighborhood of the Dead ;
Sea, never stays long enough aground to
describe much more than personalities in
the aviation business, details of admini- i
stration, etc. This, however, is thoroughly
done, with formidable lists of aircraft.
The book is of more specialised than
general interest, and the author is Public
Relations Officer for the New Zealand
Airways Corporation. Photographs are
excellent.
High-ho to London: by Frank Clune
(Angus and Robertson). Account of a
trip by air over a Sydney-London route.,
worn bare by scores of authors. A
political survey of such places as Java
and India gives topical interest. There
are the usual tourist photos: of a native
drinking coconut milk, of Javanese
children, St. Paul’s Cathedral and West-
minster Abbey, and five photos of Frank
Clune.
The Best New Zealand Books: Com-
piled by P. A. Lawlor (Beltane Book
Bureau, Wellington, N.Z.). A list for
reference and guidance for libraries,
students and collectors. Approximate
values are given ; for instance, £1 10s.
for a first edition of William Satchell’s
The Greenstone Door or £25 for the full
six volumes of John White’s Ancient
History of the Maori.
Homer’s Odyssey: Translated by S. O.
Andrew (Dent). A new and complete
translation by a scholar whose, version of
parts of the Iliad was highly praised by
Quiller-Couch. Mr. Andrew has sought
to escape the disadvantages of a rhymed
translation, and at the same time, to pre-
serve something of the Homeric rhythm
by a translation into an unrhymed hexa-
meter in easy dactyls. It is an interesting
attempt, but, using a style and idiom
closer to the 18th than to the 20th
century is as padded and unreal as most
rhymed versions. Andrew Lang’s prose
translation still gives the best impression
of the spirit of the original.
Contributions are invited by Angus
and Robertson for the eighth (1948)
Coast to Coast. Writers should submit
no more than two or three recently-
written stories. This year’s editor is Mr.
Brian Elliott. The closing date is August
31, 1948.

Carry snakebite outfit (lancet and
permanganate of potash) if in snake
country. Act promptly and call a
doctor soon as possible. Meanwhile
place ligature between bite and heart.
Wipe area of bite to remove surface
poison. Next open each puncture
with lancet and cleanse wound with
water if at hand. Finally apply the
permanganate moistened with water
or saliva. The ligature should be re-
moved briefly and replaced every 20
minutes.

Date on which the first taxi-cab
appeared in Sydney; also make of
car, owner’s name and tariff?
Owing to the destruction of the
old Sydney Traffic Dept, records, it
is impossible to give the exact date.
The first taxi-cabs were licensed some-
where about the end of 1907. There
were six two-cylinder Renault vehicles,
and they were placed on the streets
by Turner Bros., then trading as the
General Motor Co.; the fare charged
was Is. per mile. The first big fleet
was owned hy the Australasian Motor
Cab Co., which was formed in 1909
and wound up in 1918.

IN ACTION.
Progress is inspiration put
to work. And the men
who plan and build the
mighty line of Chrysler,
Dodge, De Soto and Ply-
mouth cars, and Dodge
and Fargo trucks, waste no
time in putting every in-
spiration to practical use.
That is why they have
pioneered so much that is
indispensable to modern
motoring. Inspired action
will continue to increase
the outstanding quality
of the Chrysler, Dodge,
De Soto line.
In the Australian body-building and automotive engineering plant of
C.D.D. the same progressive outlook prevails. No resting, here, on
laurels won. The successes of today ore only the finger-posts to the

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Dewey and Warren.
Hailed with great confidence
as certain to be the next U.S.
President and Vice-President,
Republican candidates Thomas
E. Dewey and Earl Warren may
make an odd pair on the plat-
form together —Dewey a nug-
gety five-foot-eight; his team-
mate a six-footer tipping the
beam at 14^st. —but actually it
would be hard to pick a pair
with more in common, a team
more likely to win or to work
well together,
Dewey has appreciated that
all along: when he was nomi-
nated in 1944 Warren was his
first choice as team-mate, but
declined. Both haye quite out-
standing records as administra-
tors —Dewey as Governor of
New York State since 1942;
Warren as Governor of Cali-
fornia since 1943. Hence it was
characteristic of Dewey to an-
nounce at once that if fie became
President the Vice-Presidency
would be a much more import-
ant and responsible post than
hitherto. A writer in N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” has summed
him up: “Dewey, who is pre-
dominantly an administrator,
uses his associates as a genuine
general staff, admitting them to
all his decisions on an almost
equal basis.”
That Dewey is the first Re-
publican to be given a second
shot at the Presidency is no
doubt largely explained by a
comment in N. Y. “Sun”; “The
experts have long since agreed
that Dewey would have been
elected in 1944 but for the war
issue and Roosevelt’s skill in
holding all the Leftists in line.”
Truman still accepted in
American comment generally as
certain to be nominated by the
Democratic Convention this
month—is believed to have lost
even many near - Leftists to
Wallace.
At 46, Dewey is 11 years
younger than Warren ; they both
have their birthdays in March,
within a few days of each other:
Pisces the Fish in the quaint
calendar of the astrologers, and
evidently in the game-fish class,
ooth of them having battled
hard in getting there.
Warren, born in Los Angeles,
was the son of a railroad worker
who lost his job and had a
Pretty tough time. The son
earned a crust as a farm-hand
while working his way through
the University of California
Dewey started out to be a pro-
fessional singer; he has a fine
baritone voice. Having so much
else m common, the pair of
them could have a singsong of
sorts together, Warren’s talent
running to the clarinet; he still
holds a ticket in the Musicians’
Union.
As yet another point of re-
semblance, both of them took
to the law and were admitted to
the Bar. Also—a point maybe
meaningless to Australian politi-
counter P ar tsi most remark-
able for lack of guts—both
made their first national reputa-
tions as “racket-busters” at a
time when that called for con-
siderable personal courage,
Warren doing the same racket-
clearing job in his State that
Dewey did in New York. Thus
a moral integrity above any
doubts is a main element of their
strong appeal as a team.
American comment admits
that Warren’s views on inter-
national policies “are not clearly
defined.” On U.S. domestic
issues he is described as
“staunchly a Constitutional Re-
publican who has stood firmly
against most of the Socialistic
trend of the New Deal; against
centralised bureaucracy in Wash-
ington and v crackpot ‘isms’
which bloomed in his own State.”
Dewey, among such indications
of policy as he has given, has
declared for universal military
training and for aid to foreign
countries without specifically ac-
cepting all of the Marshall Plan.
He has repudiated Communism
m no uncertain terms. Also
Dewey has, rightly enough, put
the blame for most of America’s
present difficulties in foreign
policy on war-time concessions
made to Soviet Russia. “Mar-
shal Stalin,” he said in one
speech, “has repeatedly pro-
claimed the Soviet ambition to
rule the world. In the face of
that fact our own Government
blundered and compromised
from conference to conference,
each time aiding and abetting
that very scheme of Soviet
world conquest.”
Going on what could be in-
ferred from other Dewey utter-
ances, the. outside world, par-
ticularly Europe, might find
America harder to deal with
under his Administration than
under Truman’s. Even so, the
Dewey-Warren team definitely
does not represent any falling-
back into isolationism. Dewey,
in fact, was praised by N. Y.
“Times” for his “strong con-
demnation of isolationism” in
a foreign-policy speech he made
last February. In that speech,
also, he favored internationalis-
ing the Ruhr, and, regarding the
Marshall Plan, said that the
amount of aid the U.S’. should
give Europe should be “specifi-
cally related to the progress”
made toward a United States of
Europe.
Two regular N. Y, “Herald
Tribune” writers, Joseph Alsop
and Walter Lippmann, have
pointed to flaws in Dewey.
Lippmann, referring to some
“missing quality” in him, has
said that “perhaps it is a cer-
tain generosity of the spirit.”
Alsop, stating that “Dewey has
always had to assert himself in
order to dominate his environ-
ment,” declared, “It is this visible
effort to be master that causes
so many people to be put off by
Dewey.”
Of Dewey policy in general,
Alsop implied that actually it
amounts to no change in general
U.S. policy. Alsop commented:
“On the domestic front, he says
in effect, T believe in everything
that has been done, but I shall
do it much better,’ adding under
his breath, ‘And I shan’t make
any further innovations unless I
have to.’ This credo, scorned by
fools, is in truth the essence of
classical conservatism, without
which democratic politics could
n °t he carried on. In foreign
policy his approach is much the
same to do better more rapidly
and more firmly just about what
is now being done.”
One-way Migrants.
Even the venerable Pink Dean
would find one aspect of his be-
loved earthly paradise hard to
explain—the steady one-way
human migration from it of
those intent on escaping its
benefits.
“Secretly, by stealth and in
danger,” a correspondent of
N, Y. “Herald Tribune” has re-
ported, “Russians of every kind
and class have been crossing the
border into the Western zones
ever since the end of the war.”
They are not, the correspon-
dent states, desperate refugees
fleeing* special persecution:
“They have nothing to fear
which is not feared by every
other citizen of the Soviet State.
They have no reason for dis-
content which is not shared by
180,000,000 others. They are
simply Russians who have been
willing to risk their lives and to
estrange themselves for ever
from the land that gave them
birth, in order to escape the iron
grip of the Soviet system.”
“History,” the report adds,
“affords no parallel for such
mass disloyalty. And what
makes the phenomenon all the
more incredible, all the more
meaningful, is the presence
among those who have fled of a
disproportionately high per-
centage of those whom the
Soviet system has most gener-
ously favored and trusted. A
full 60 per cent, are officers or
officials, and of these officers and
officials nearly half have occu-
pied posts above the middle rank
of importance. One is a colonel-
general, from Marshal Sokolov-
sky’s staff. Several others also
come from high in the military
hierarchy. And still others left
behind key jobs at the topmost
level of the civilian administra-
tion of the Soviet zone.”
Plants 400lb., £500.
Tomorrow, apparently, isn’t
some future time; it arrived in
person recently in England: its
form, two planes flown across
the Channel from Belgium.
The London “Times” account
described them as “single-seat
machines, weighing 4001 b
than many motor-cycles.” With
orders justifying making them in
“reasonable numbers,” they
“should cost not more than
£500,” and “they will be easy
and cheap to maintain.”
Called the Fairey Junior and
made in the Avions Fairey fac-
tory near Brussels, they are
“neat little monoplanes with
square wing-tips,” take off in
“well under 100 yards,” have “a
splendid rate of climb,” are
“simple and easy to handle.”
And they did the trip from Bel-
gium to England on a gallon and
a half of petrol each.
Britain in Palestine.
While Britain’s policy in
Palestine has been under a
violent barrage of emotional
attack by obviously interested
parties in the U.S. —not the
least interested the Presidential
candidates hoping to get a return
in votes —London “Times” has
quietly pointed out some of the
outstanding general results from
Britain’s handling of the man-
date.
British policy, the “Times” has
stated, “has long been designed
to safeguard inter n a t i onal
security in the Middle East by
encouraging the Arab kingdoms'
to modernise their administra-
tion, to promote the welfare of
their subjects, and so build up
the strength and popular sup-
port needed to share effectively
in their defence against possible
attack.”
That policy made possible
“more than 20 years of peaceful
development in the Middle
East.” When war came the same
policy enlisted the co-operation
of Egypt in the defeat of the
German drive through Africa
and rallied the Arab Legion to
crush the Nazi intrigue in Irak.
Also, it made possible the work
of the Middle East Supply
Centre, which co-ordinated the
resources of the Arab world
under British and American
guidance for the benefit of the
Allies.”
Regarding the Jewish side, “It
was no accident, but the con-
sequence of British policy and its
consistent support for peaceful
economic development and
social progress, that the Jewish
National Home, foreshadowed
in the mandate, was able to
enjoy the fullest facilities to
grow from weakness to maturity,
and to make Palestine outstand-
ing in the Middle East for high
standards of life. With equal
consistency British policy sought
to reconcile Arab opinion to the
existence of the National Home.
It did not contemplate, nor was
it ever pledged to contemplate,
the creation of a secular Jewish
State in a predominantly Muslim
area.”
A brief summary of part of
the British record, as set forth
m a statement issued by the
Colonial Office, is worth adding
at this stage to the great credit
• ® ’ ma king the almost
incredibly vicious hate-Britain
propaganda by American Zionist
Jews seem all the more foul:
When British rule began Palestine
was a primitive and undeveloped
country. Agriculture was inefficient,
industry almost non-existent, and
communications inadequate. Itspopu-
•i!? n some 750,000 were disease-
ridden and poor. Lawlessness was rife
inside Palestine and made worse by
raiding nomads from the desert.
The Government of Palestine in-
troduced better methods of farming
and substantial loans were granted.
The effect of these steps was re-
inforced by the achievements of
Jewish capital and enterprise and by
the steadily rising standards of health
and education among the Arabs. A
measure of the success achieved is
provided by the increase in the ex-
port of citrus fruit (Palestine’s most
important export) from 2,600,000 cases
in 1929-30 to 15,300,000 in 1938-39.
The development of industry has, in
the main, been achieved by Jewish
capital and initiative, but the ex-
pansion and modernisation by the
Government of Palestine of the
country’s roads and railways and the
construction of the deep-water port
of Haifa have also made an impor-
tant contribution.
An efficient and impartial judicial
system _ was set up. It is, however,
in their efforts to improve public
health and the standard of living
that the Government of Palestine have
achieved their most striking success.
The progress made towards the
establishment in Palestine of a
national home for the Jewish people
has been remarkable. Four hundred
thousand Jewish immigrants have
entered Palestine since 1920 and the
total Jewish population has risen
from 84,000 in 1922 to 640,000 to-
day. Large areas of land, once
neglected, have been brought into
fruitful bearing. Tel Aviv, which is
wholly Jewish, has grown from a vil-
lage to a modern city of 150,000
inhabitants. Hydro-electric energy
has been developed, while the re-
sources of the Dead Sea are being
exploited. Industries have been estab-
lished, notwithstanding the paucity of
raw materials, covering a wide range
of manufactures and having a gross
output valued in 1947 at some £4om.
The “Times” now sees no
peaceful future for Palestine un-
less there’s an end to “decisions
made without warning in the
White House,” and unless U.S.
influence is used to “restrain
Zionist ambitions, to limit the
territory of the new State of
Israel to boundaries settled
once and for all by effective
international guarantee, and to
persuade Zionists that the privi-
leges of secular Statehood must
carry with them the accompany-
ing sacrifice of any claim upon
the allegiance of Jewish citizens
of other countries ; no claim for
double nationality can be
accepted.”
Rabbit Punch.
A bill introduced in the U.S.
Congress aims a rabbit punch
at the fur industry, or, as a
Scripps-Howard correspondent
leports it, aims to bring about
a sweeping “deglamorisation.”
Henceforth, if the bill goes
through (such bills rarely do),
hubby won’t be able to give
the little woman [?] a ‘sheared
Manchurian ermine-dyed coney’
fur coat.” He’ll give her a coat
that will say plainly on the label
that it’s “sheared, dyed rabbit ”
Also “the label will tell if the
rabbit fur came from Australia,
as is often the case.”
A representative of the U.S.
Trade Commission told the Con-
gress committee looking into the
matter that skunk “has been sold
under such names as Alaska
sable,-black marten, civet cat,
dipped marten,” and “Manchur-
ian dog has been called Man-
churian fox, wolf fox, Belgian
lynx, Isabella fox.” As for
bunny, his fur has passed as
“Arctic seal, Australian seal,
beaverette, ermiline, lapin, gal-
land squirrel, muskratine and
marmotine,”
The main provision of the
Congress bill is that requiring
the use of “the true English
name of the animal producing
the fur,” stopping, among other
things, use of the French
“coney” for rabbit.
“Exercise Britannia.”
Preparatory work has already
been going on for several
months, Field-Marshal Lord
Montgomery told senior officers
of Britain’s Stall College, for
next year’s “Exercise Britannia,”
which is to take the form of “a
great study of the whole problem
of civil defence.”
It will be attended, he said,
by the heads of the three services
in Britain and the Dominions,
and will “try to evolve a civil-
defence doctrine and technique
which will link the civil and
military organisations in civil
defence.”
Among factors influencing
planning for future defence, he
included the difference made by
the withdrawal from India,
which relieved a garrison of
40,000 troops but also involved
fresh commitments formerly met
by the Indian Army, and also
“the pace of modern warfare,”

another war to build up and

Good Wicket, U.N.O. —Very good
wicket indeed, with screws (as set
out in a “Saturday Evening Post”
article) ranging from $l5BO for mes-
sengers carrying documents between
offices, to Secretary-General Lie’s
$20,000-a-year salary, $20,000-a-year
expense-account and $15,000-a-year
house-allowance. As none of them
pays income-tax, Mr. Truman, who
does, actually gets $2OOO a year less
for being President of the U.S. than

Hate-Britain Sample. —Just by way
of a merely typical specimen of the
recent acres of U.S. Zionist hate-

expected to see the British Army —
which stood in water up to its heart

Congenital U.S. Weakness. Diag-
nosed by N. Y. “Times” Washington
correspondent Arthur Krock: “What
c °P( in t ue . s to disturb foreign-policy
officials in Washington [and elsewhere,
it might be said] is a native trait all
public groups display and which
future historians may classify as a
congenital national weakness, however
endearing. This is the American
tendency always to search for a single,
quick and easy solution of every-
thing.”

■n-'ii Bishop Cuts His Pay. —The new
Bishop of Manchester, Dr. W. D. L.
Greer, has taken the somewhat un-
usual step of declining exactly half
his stipend; hitherto £4200. When
income-tax and rent are deducted
from the balance of £2lOO he will
have what Americans call a “take-
home” of £l2OO, which (in a Lon-
don Times” report) he calls “a
large sum for a man who, until
recently, never earned more than
£450.” Frankly, he said, it made
mm uncomfortable when he knew
how many of his brethren had so
much less.

Diplomats’ Turn. —For a fair time
now the usually well-informed “U. S.
News and World Report” has dis-
counted war-talk. Despite scares, it
still sees the trend as being slowly
towards peace. “Soldiers in civilian
clothes,” it says, have so far been
running the “cold war” for the U.S.
and have demonstrated to Russia that
the U.S. is in Europe to stay. That
having been done, “diplomats are
likely before long to be called on
to carry forward the difficult back-
stage negotiations” leading to a peace
arrangement.

Zionism in America. —Opposing a
suggestion that “to attack the Jews
is to attack America,” Lady Astor,
in a London “Times” letter, stated
of her recent tour of the U.S.: “The
impiession I received from all sections
of the country was that southern Jews
were southerners, western Jews
westerners, just as the English Jews
are English, and that many of the
leading Jews were not Zionists either
there or here. Although all Jews
had a great feeling for the suffering
of their people, they realised that the
Hagana and Zionists were creating
a dangerous anti-Semitic feeling
throughout America as throughout the
world. In fact, it is so dangerous
that many people are positively
frightened of it.”

The £ and the $. —Summed up by
the U.S. Congress Committee on
Foreign Aid: “(1) For well over a
century and until the recent war, the
pound sterling was the monetary unit
for carrying on a substantial part
of the world’s multilateral commerce.
(2) This activity has languished since
the war because of the inconvertibility
of the pound sterling, and attempts
to revive it by the use of the dollar
have been unsuccessful. (3) The dollar
can probably never take the place of
the pound sterling in world trade
because the United States may never
be an importer to the same relative
extent, and on as world-wide a basis,
as the United Kingdom.”

The Profit Motive. Among
economic fallacies that should be
tossed to the scrapheap, William
Henry Chamberlin, in “Wall-street
Journal,” includes the idea that pro-
duction should be “for use, not for
profit,” and contends: “This conveys
the absurd suggestion that what is
produced for profit does not get into
use. With the current spectacle of
countries which have tampered least
with the profit motive, America, Bel-
gium, Switzerland, ministering to the
chronic deficits of lands which have
gone in for collectivist experiments,
a reflective mind might reach the
conclusion that production for profit
is the best and surest means of satis-
fying human needs.”

Spain Excluded. —As an instance of
“the extremes to which the anti-
Spain bigots are prepared to go,” a
London “Times” letter-writer men-
tions the exclusion of Spain from
the International convention for the
Safety of Life at Sea, to which Britain
invited Rumania, Poland, Yugoslavia
and Finland. The writer commented:
“Surely the good work of this con-
vention, like the Red Cross, tran-
scends all politics and is for the
succor of all humanity, whether
Right or Left? Spain has coastlines
thrust into the seaways of the Atlan-
tic and the Mediterranean traversed
possibly more by our ships than
those of any other nation. Who
would be the greatest sufferers
through any lack of understanding?”

"FULL EMPLOYMENT."
Professor Copland, one of the original
drill-sergeants of “Labor’s” regimented
Commonwealth, said a piece in an
address to Victorian economists the other
day that should be properly addressed to
his former Ministerial captains. The
Australian policy of “continued social
control with a large measure of initiative
left to private enterprise,” he declared,
“depended for success upon the response
of production and in part upon voluntary
discipline” ; and without pausing to ques-
tion the efficacy of this attempted mixture
of oil and water, he went on:
An examination of Australian figures
available suggests that the increase of pro-
duction over the pre-war level is in no way
comparable with the increase that has taken
place in U.S. and Canada, In U.S.A. a
policy of decontrol has resulted in a rise
of industrial output to 85 per cent, above
pre-war level.
In fact, Australian production has
hardly anywhere risen above 1939 levels,
and in important heads is below them,
although 605,000 more people are em-
ployed, Professor Copland declares
that the Canberra Socialists’ policy “has
not either checked inflationary pressure
or resulted in expansion of production to
meet demand.” There is “a fundamental
disequilibrium in the economic system
' reminiscent of that which preceded the
depression at the end of the ’twenties,”
and as for “full employment”:
It would be better to describe the present
position as one of employment of large
numbers at a level far below industrial
capacity.
The Australian economic sickness has
been produced by the Chifleyites and the
Communists together the “Govern-
ment” killing production by its national-
isation threats, its throttling taxation and
its profligate demands on the labor
market, and the Communists assisting
by limiting man-hour output along
with pressure in the unions for ever-
increasing wages. The Canberra statistical
office goes on announcing “record
wages,” “highest retail prices ever,”
“peak trade figures” and (Melbourne
“Age” distortion) “Australian factory
production in 1946-47 an all-time record,
valued at £412,945,000 —value per person
engaged £514 compared with £476 in
1945-46 and £360 in 1938-39.” Flour,
wheat, wool prices soaring in a world
starving for them, wool-tops floating so
high that Bradford says costs 1 are greater
than prices obtainable for its finished
products; yet Canberra decides on a
huge concentrated drive to “stimulate
production of exports.” The statisticians
(m daily-press translations) chant on:
Value of all exports for first ten months
of current year is £326 million, compared
with the record £3OB rnillion for the entire
previous 12 months (1946-47). Imports
also at a new record of £277 million and
tor only ten months also. “National in-
f 1947 ‘ 48 24 P- c - higher than
And then the Canadian Bank of Com-
merce goes and rubs out all this beauti-
ful dream—giving figures to clothe Pro-
fessor Copland’s horrible suspicions—
and records value of world exports at
the equivalent of 12,500 million Aus-
tralian pounds, but actually only about
5 per cent, over pre-war level, “higher
prices accounting for all the increase.”
Also 40 per cent, of this world total
from U.S.A. and Canada, and one-
fifth of that was on credit or relief basis.
To show what has happened in export
prices, the unadorned mass tables issued
by the Commonwealth Statistician permit
this illustration through the export price-
indices. Taking 1000 as price-index for
the average of the years 1936-39, the
comparison is as follows:

Inter-State and oversea shipping cargoes
are not yet being handled in anything
near the volume of pre-war years. Cost
of handling cargo in Port of Sydney in
1939 was about 3s. 6d. a ton; in Feb-
ruary, 1947, it was 11s. 9d. a ton; and
today is well above that.
Sugar in North Queensland ports loaded
per hour per gang fell by 35 to 40 per cent,
last year compared with 1939, and ship-
ments in six weeks July-December from
589.000 tons in 1939 to 385,000 in 1947,
a £. ro P.°f about the same percentage.
Despite the immense development of the
steel industry since pre-war days, the average
monthly production of steel ingots from
97,509 tons in 1938-39 rose only to 109,125
tons in 1946-47, and Mr. Essington Lewis
said in his Joseph Fisher lecture in Adelaide
the other day that 500,000 more tons could
have been produced last year another
42.000 on the monthly average—but for
shortages of coal and labor. The monthly
average this year is 106,384 tons.
“Full employment,” with its unionist
interpretation in limited output for ever-
increasing wages, is a farce and a menace.
The collaring of available manpower
—and young manpower at that —by the
“Government” for its wasteful and over-
populated departments shows perhaps the
“full-employment” weed at its flowering
worst. It is' making drones of the work-
ing hive. , It offers a premium to “living
on the Government,” a serious enough
tendency even before this Chifley regime
came to office. Ever since the war ended
and released sorely-needed manpower for
industry again, out of every seven wage-
earners who have entered or re-entered
employment the Government has taken
two, although Government departments,
unlike commercial industry, greatly in-
creased their numbers’ during the war.
Here are the official figures of total
employment, excluding rural, domestic
and defence forces;
Private
T , All Govts. employers.
July, 1939 .. ~ 405,000 1,325,200
June, 1947 .. .. 564,100 1,704,900
March, 1948 ~ 574,500 1,760,400
Gain since 1939 .. 169,500 435,200
The Government total has increased
again since March, because railway em-
ployees suspended in Queensland during
the strike have since been taken on again.
Of the all-Governments total (excluding
defence forces) the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment employed 67,863 in 1939 and
164,000 last March. That figure also has
since risen monthly.
But the total alone, and the steady in-
crease in it, are not the worst features of
this Federal draining-away of manpower.
Peak Federal employrrient was in
1943, when Canberra absorbed 242,000
people, 161,500 of them in two huge war
departments—Munitions and Works (in-
cluding Allied Works Council). Yet when
these two departments were cut (by last
August) to 18,000, of the 143,500 no
longer required in them 94,500 were ab-
sorbed in other Commonwealth Depart-
ments. That was the net effect of dis-
charge and intake over the service as a
whole. The country has to carry this
monstrous burden not only in the de-
prival of the labor market but also in the
added taxation imposed to keep this
bureaucratic army in utterly unproduc-
tive “full employment.”
As for the contribution of the 40-hour
week to “full employment,” Queensland
Employers’ Federation has reported that
it works out at an average productive
man-week of 29 hours. Chairman of
N.S.W. Water Board says that two and
a half workers are now required to do
work performed by one man before the
war. Melbourne and Brisbane Chambers
of Commerce have just produced a sur-
vey showing that the 40-hour week has
resulted in “less production, rising costs
and no increase in efficiency,” and “the
full effects of the shorter week will not
be felt before next year.” Common-
wealth figures show decline in produc-
tion between November, 1947 (the last
full month of 44 hours), and February,
1948 (the first under 40 hours), to these
degrees: Coal 25 per cent., cement 21,
baths, sinks, etc., 17, gold 26, ingot steel
9, sugar 13, chemical fertilisers 16,
newsprint 7.
Anyone who chooses to turn back to
September, 1947, and read the Arbitra-
tion Court’s 40-hour-week judgment will
seem to be reading some essay of beauti-
ful nonsense, in which the presiding
Judge, solemnly pondering which of
several estimates of likely loss in pro-
duction he should believe, plumps for
the testimony of the Commonwealth’s
“expert” witnesses who “thought” the
decline would be “not more than five
per cent.,” and would be “rapidly over-
taken” by contented industry. The judg-
ment must certainly have given Mr.
Chifley a relapse into confidence in his
Golden Age. It has already been com-
pletely belied by the unrest, wilful stop-
pages, defiance of industrial authority,
withholding of effort and inflation of
prices that have marked every week since
it was delivered.
Professor Copland certainly spoke
mildly (and in obscure English) when he
said in his address in Melbourne that
conditions requisite for the success of
the Canberra policy “have not been
operative to the extent that the policy
might be claimed to have been success-
ful.”
Towards Deliverance.
Union under a Parliament supreme in
national affairs, with the necessary accom-
paniments of regional assemblies (called
provincial councils) and real local self-
government in all municipal matters, has
worked well, in South Africa, where a
Federal system might have failed; and
there was a time when Australia seemed
to be moving in that direction. Certainly
the conception attracted a great many
Australians, who saw excessive cost, cen-
tralisation and confusion in the existence
of seven Parliaments with ill-defined
powers. It has been shattered by “Labor”
misrule—by “Labor’s” follies and weak-
nesses ; by its clumsy efforts to establish
unification and (in N. S. Wales) a Minis-
terial despotism of local government,
without checks.
Men who would have supported union
with the necessary accompaniments and
guarantees have abandoned it as a
dream that will never come true. They
see now, and many others with them, that
the only hope of deliverance from an
accumulation of disorders, to which there
has been added Communist - larrikin
control of transport and industry, the
only chance of securing for inland Aus-
tralia the development of which it has
been starved and of redressing the
balance of population, and so of political
power, lies in making the most of the
Federal system. And that, in a Common-
wealth where more than half the con-
tinental population, though depending, in
the main, on country industries, lives —
dangerously in this age of the atom bomb
and other missile weapons—in five cities,
means New States.
Realisation of this necessity, recognised
long before his death by N.S.W. Chief
Justice Cullen (“the national corollary
to Federation”) and all along by N.S.W.
Justice Nicholas, chairman of the 1935
Boundaries Commission, has led to a re-
vival of the New State campaign in
northern N. S. Wales. Hence the con-
vention at Armidale, composed of dele-
gates from all the districts in that im-
portant, but sinfully neglected, part of
Australia, with Cr. Wright as chairman,
and Dr. Page and C.P. deputy-leader
Drummond among the speakers.
The author of the Financial Agreement
argued that the Federal system would be
strengthened, and the passing of constitu-
tional reforms made less difficult, by the
creation of more States. The Financial
Agreement itself would, he said, work
better. At present the Commonwealth
and two States, representing less than
one-sixth of the people, can outvote the
other four States, a position which “tends
to increase Canberra domination,” and so
“to weaken the Federal pact, and create
dissension.”
On the population question, and the
accompanying city neglect of the country,
the man who has filled so many high
offices gave these arresting facts:
Census figures show that the Sydney
proportion of the N.S.W. people was 25
p.c. in 1871, 47.5 p.c. in 1933 and 50 p.c.
in 1947—1,484,000 out of 2,985,000.
In Australia as a whole the capital cities
had 43 p.c. of the people in 1921, 47 p.c.
in 1933 and 51 p.c. in 1947. Increases in
round numbers during that 14-y.ear period
were 744,000 in the capital cities, 206,000
in the rest of Australia.
In 1872 Henry Parkes said at Tenterfield
that the most urgent work in Australia was
the joining of the fertile tableland of New
England with that great navigable river
the Clarence. After 76 years the route is
“still being examined.” •
Ulrich Ellis, the Rural Research and
Development man, pointed out that the
1933-47 gain of inland population was
confined to cities and towns ; “rural areas
lost 27,000.” And because rural industries
are kept “chronically short of manpower,
materials and equipment,” rural pro-
duction is declining, though the outside
world is hungry and ill-clad; “even milk
for the cities has to be rationed.” The
money goes where the votes are and
grow, as they are growing all the time;
while country districts are denied essen-
tials, even hospitals, 50 millions are
found for the Eastern Suburbs railway
(pronounced “an urgent priority job”)
and scores of other millions for city hous-
ing, waterworks, power plants, anything
and everything that can be thought of.
Thus fortified with facts and arguments,
the convention voted it “essential and
desirable” that “a new State be created,”
and undertook “to co-operate with other
movements having similar aims.” And,
by way of launching the New State and
Decentralisation Movement, it appointed
a provisional executive of 12, with 13
others to be added (all were named), and
a sub-committee “to prepare proposals.”
Finance will be no worry. Upwards of
£lOOO, mostly in donations of £5O, was
collected within half an hour and £5OOO
is in sight.
This looks good, and time and circum-
stance are favorable to the new crusaders.
The “what’s-the-use?” spirit will have to
be overcome, but it is no longer the for-
midable obstacle it was in the nineteen-
twenties. Public opinion has been
aroused, if not yet fully, against the
Chifleys and McGirrs, as well as the
Communists to whom they crawl.
The very fact of their habitual sur-
render to that frowsy mob should
inspire the earnest and determined
men of northern N. S. Wales to press
them until they yield. There is the further
fact, which should be emphasised in
addresses to the people of the justly dis-
satisfied region and other justly dis-
satisfied regions, that the bloating of the
Federal Parliament under the Chifley-
Evatt scheme will add to the already ex-
orbitant political power of the cities at
the expense of the country, whereas with
the formation of new States —and there
should be no increase of members until
there are new States—the political power
of the cities would be diminished and that
of the country increased.
And the men of the New State and
Decentralisation Movement should make
it their business to inform their fellow-
citizens, and likeminded people in other
parts, of the great benefits which the
U.S.A. has derived from the admission of
new States. It is a continuous process,
which before long will take in Alaska,
with only 40,000 whites, and from it the
American Union has gained in increase,
distribution and variety of population and
in balance of political power. From
variety the British and American areas
have drawn strength and resilience
throughout their history; but only popu-
lation increases in the 10 States (10 out
of 48) admitted between 1889 and 1912
need now be considered. Estimates for
admission years and for the latest avail-
able twelvemonth (in no case 1948) show
these progresses:
North Dakota (admitted 1889), 319,000
to 528,000; South Dakota (1889), 398,000
to 562,300; Montana (1889), 243,000 to
465.000 (the Dakotas and Montana are
reckoned backward States); Washington
1889), 518,100 to 2,055,300; Utah (1896),
270.000 to 730,000: Wyoming (1900), 92,500
to 270,000; Idaho (1900), 161,700 to 531,500;
Oklahoma (1907), 800,00 a to 2,016,300;
New Mexico (1912), 330,000 to 560,000;
Arizona (1912), 210,000 to 661,400.
There i$ no Communist domination in
any of these States, or any of the other
small States —all are, in fact, bulwarks
against Communism —and each of them
has as many Senators as New York. And
New York, with about a tenth of the
total population, has only a trifle more
than a tenth of the Ms.H.R. —45.
“Labor’s” prescription for northern
N. S. Wales and the Riverina is no Sena-
tors (Senator&hips are reserved for city
chaps) and three or four members apiece
in the House—a House in which N. S.
Wales and Victoria between them, the
cities, of course, predominating, will have
80 members out of 121, whereas New
York and Pennsylvania, next in order of
population, have 78 out of 435. They cer-
tainly order these matters better in the
country which makes wise and generous
provision for new States'.
The Beasley Burglars.
Six times in 16 months burglars have had
a crack at the London home of Mr.
Beasley, our High Commissioner there.
Since the London burglar is as shrewd as
the London bobby is famous, there must
be something mighty attractive in the
Beasley home, or at least the burglars
believe there is something there worth the
risk. What do the Beasleys possess that
may be more precious than liberty?
The mind naturally recalls things it has
heard of in fiction and fact. Precious
jewels, sacred relics, old masters, valuable
parchments, secret plans, lost wills, price-
less formulas—can it be that some such
lure attracts miscreants to the Beasley
home as the island of the lodestone drew
the ships of fable? Ah, there would be
romance! But truth is ever callous, and
the most vivid imagination could hardly
link the ex-member for West Sydney with
Spanish doubloons or lost Van Dykes.
Yet stay the Beasleys had a treasure
when they arrived in London early in
1946 —a treasure which, to a Londoner
of these times, is more than gold. What
was it?
Seven 701 b. bags of sugar, two chests of
tea, 13 cases of canned veges, 10 cases
of jam, 39 of canned fruits, six of fruit-
juices, three of tinned meat, two of canned
soup, five of dried fruits, two of cream,
two of condensed and two of dried milk,
one of “Milo,” one of malted milk and
25 of wine.
What a treasure in a pinched—and
parched—country! Scotland Yard, which
was promptly apprised of the sixth raid,
need seek no further, it seems. Mr.
Fraser (Eden-Monaro) said that Mr.
Beasley was “a most abstemious man,”
and Mr, Chifley said the stuff was to
enable our United Kingdom representa-
tive “adequately to carry out the enter-
taining which he has to do as Resident
Minister”; so while the early raiders
obviously hoped that some of it might be
left, perhaps the later ones suspected that
a new issue had arrived, and the last one
had heard of Mr. Chifley’s imminent
arrival in person and was convinced there
should be a prune or two about the place.


PLAIN ENGLISH
OUR Cold War.
With an unusually cold winter there has
come a multitude of other cold things
in N. S. Wales and the three States
that depend on N.S.W. coal, output of
which, never half of the possible, has,
under Communist, fellow-traveller and
other larrikin direction, fallen far below
the half.
Cold trains, when they run—they didn’t
in Melbourne on Saturday and Sunday—
and cold waiting-rooms for travellers on
country routes where there is still a ser-
vice of a sort. Cold offices, stores and
warehouses, for electric radiators and
gas heaters are “out” in two senses,
and wood, coke and coal for fires are as
scarce as hens’ teeth. Cold furnaces in
factories, and the cold certainty of serious
unemployment. Cold baths, cold meals,
cold living-rooms and cold stoves
when mother tries to heat milk for her
children or water for their bath. Cold
limbs for old-age pensioners and other
aged, lonely and failing people, and cold
graves for those to whom warmth was
life. Cold hearts in coalmines and gas-
works. Cold feet in “Labor” Cabinets,
whence cold comfort emerges, and some-
times cold lying.
Except that our Iliad of woes is man-
caused, we seem to be fast approach-
ing the condition of which Hood sang
dolorously over a century ago:
No travelling at all, no locomotion,
No inkling of the way, no notion,
No go by land or ocean;
No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful
ease,
No comfortable feel in any member,
No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees —
No-vember.
To which a parodist might add,
apropos of the “Labor” politicians with
cold feet and the state of affairs which
they, scared stiff by their Communist-
bossed miners, have brought about and
now try to brazen out:
No strength, no sense of duty, no decision,
No guts, no heart, no intellect, no vision,
No help in time of savage deprivation,
No plan, no purpose, no imagination,
No punishment for Reds, no jail, no rope—
No hope.
In 1946, by virtue of measures passed
in two “Labor”-controlled Parliaments,
the N.S.W. coal industry was placed
under joint Commonwealth and State
“control” to the end that a full supply of
coal might be secured by “giving the
workers everything they ask for,” which
has been interpreted to cover free foot-
ball togs and entertainment, almost every-
thing except free s.-p. bets and beer.
The result is catastrophe. Yet in the
very presence of catastrophe N.S.W.
Premier McGirr, whose Government en-
gaged in a week of “deliberations” be-
fore it could make up what it is pleased to
call its mind, all the time pressing the
Joint Coal Board to spare N. S. Wales as
much as possible by inflicting new hard-
ships on guiltless Victoria and South
Australia (this the Board has done), ex-
tolled the miners for their “very wonder-
ful work.”
And Minister Ashley, whose “Govern-
ment” paid £llB3 to their Communist
boss, Williams, found excuses for them.
He asserted that “the number of men
engaged in the N.S.W. coalmining in-
dustry declined from 24,494 last year to
17,600 this year.” As barefaced an
untruth as the McGirr statement that out-
put in the last “Labor” year was over two
million tons more than in the best Liberal
year. As Government statistics show,
“the number of men engaged” has been
round 17,000 for the last eight recorded
years—l 7,337 (in 1940), 17,351, 17,101,
17,497, 17,468, 17,427, 17,448 and (in
1947, and greatest of all) 17,614.
The McGirr and Ashley furphies were
concocted in particular for the people of
Kogarah, where there is to be an
Assembly by-election. Kogarah is in Dr.
Evatt’s electorate and adjacent to that of
his brother, Mr. McGirr’s favorite
Minister, who, with Mrs. Jessie Street
(last heard of in Yugoslavia, of all
countries), dotes on Moscow, both being
pillars of the Ausjxalia-Russia Society.
Kogarah can thus be the instrument of
retributive justice for an outraged nation.
Chlfley's Millions.
Mr. Chifley, determined not to show a
surplus of more than a nominal amount
in spite of a huge increase in revenue
over Budget calculations —the excess was
a cool £6l million on an original estimate
of £365 million —has lately forecast an
“approximate surplus” of a million
pounds for the year 1947-48. A million
pounds is purely a nominal affair in
figures and calculations having to do with
the Chifley Government’s handling of the
people’s money.
Out of his excess revenue Mr. Chifley
threw a large lump (£l9 million extra)
into the National Welfare Fund, making
the total contribution £BB million for the
year —£ll 14s. of taxation a head of the
total population for “social-security” pur-
poses. (In 1938-39 all taxes, State and
Federal, were no more than £l7 19s. 7d.
a head.) And though he budgeted for an
expenditure of £l6B million on “defence
and post-war (1939-45) charges,” Mr.
Chifley managed to spend an additional
£ll million in obscurity under this head-
ing, making the total £179 million for the
second complete year of peace. Where
this money is all going only the Auditor-
General can tell, but very little of it
appears to be used in the defence of in-
dustrial Australia against those remark-
able “philosophers” the Communists.
Large sums are nevertheless employed in
the attack on private enterprise.
Tossing £lO million to the International
Monetary Fund, Mr. Chifley probably
relaxed and admired his surplus of a
million pounds, feeling, no doubt, that he
had achieved the happiest of political
mediums —a balanced Budget, but a
surplus so small that hungry State
Premiers and emaciated taxpayers would
not be able to use it in evidence against
him. He won’t relax for long.
The colossal extortions by Canberra
from the taxpaying community are not
made any easier to bear by boasting a
national income reckoned at £1571 mil-
lion, up £306 million (24 p.c.) in 1947-48.
The increase is in a large measure the
result of costs-inflation, and the taxpayer
pays these inflated costs as well as the
inflated Chifley tax exactions. Some of
the increased income does, indeed, derive
from higher prices for our exports ; but
imports are becoming correspondingly
costly, and dollars grow scarcer than ever.
The New Brisbane "Line."
A sort of wintry laughter was heard in
Brisbane last week when the “Courier-
Mail” came out with the announcement
that Healy, the Communist boss of the
wharfies, had assembled 1500 of them in
Brisbane Stadium, closed the meeting to
the press and then told the 1500 that they
“must work harder” and he was “sorry
to say there was a tendency among them
to take it easy,” Then the branch secre-
tary, the Communist Englart, arose and
denounced some of them for “lying
down on the job” or “arriving drunk for
work,” Whereupon the noble fellows
passed a resolution threatening “suspen-
sion” for such crimes—Healy and Eng-
lart having made it clear that they were
crimes against the “cause.” Healy also
was able to tell the boys that the benevo-
lent Mr. Chifley was “not completely
opposed” to pensions for them.
Side-by-side with this choice bit of
news the “Courier-Mail” mordantly an-
nounced that the State would end the
financial year with a deficit after nine
successive surpluses, and that the rail
strike which began last February and
was violently supported by Healy’s and
Englart’s wharfies was the cause. That
strike cost the railways £750,000 and the
State as a whole about £20,000,000.
The Stadium meeting left the port idle
for five hours, and that night there were
more doings, again at the Stadium, where
a meeting of protest against “anti-union
legislation passed by various State Gov-
ernments” was held. Communist union
bosses addressed an audience of a
thousand.
Mr. Rowe’s address was interrupted by
several cascades of stones on the iron
roof. One drunk climbed up and shook
Mr. Paterson by the hand he was evicted
when his loyalties became confused and he
became a nuisance.
Comrade Macdonald forecast “big
strikes ahead.” The workers had not
smashed through yet, and “a bitter
struggle was likely very soon. ’ Comrade
Healy said fines for illegal picketing
would not be paid from union funds
and the men fined didn’t have the
money to pay themselves. Whereupon a
collection raised £B3 3s. 7d. After which
the Australian flags were carefully folded
up and the mugs went home. Such was
Premier Hanlon’s reward for repealing
his anti-picketing law.
"Socialism in Our Time!"
When the Atlantic Charter, the Potsdam
Agreement and the Anglo-Russian treaty
joined the League covenants and the non-
aggression agreements with the little
Baltic republics in the Moscow receptacle
for scraps of paper, it was here suggested
that Stalin was leading from weakness,
not strength. He was bluffing, because
he had no other resource, the internal
situation of his empire being bad. And
his bluff brought him great apparent
gains until it was called, as it was most
effectually, by the Marshall Plan, backed
by a not-to-be-mistaken show of force.
Now the Cominform has expelled Tito,
a fellow-ruffian, because he has turned
nationalist or something. There would
be no conflict of ruffianisms if things had
not been going badly.
In point of fact, things are going badly
in every country which has embraced
socialism or had socialism thrust upon
it. Of those with war recovery pro-
grammes only free-enterprise America,
Canada and Belgium have gone forward
and are in a sound position—a fact as
striking as it is irrefutable. Australia
could have been of the company and
Holland, too. Communist yahoos and
gutless Labor-socialists wrecked their
opportunities.
In Britain a dock strike, obviously
planned to coincide with the blockade of
Berlin and the murder campaign in
Malaya, if not the coal hold-up in Aus-
tralia, has worsened the food position.
Tardy in dealing with this Communist-
caused wickedness, Mr. Attlee scotched
it at last, though only by proclaiming
that a state of emergency existed, the
proclamation being signed by the King.
Employment of troops —very few —and
appeals to the strikers to shake the Com-
munists off their necks and return to their
duty were unavailing.
The appeals were couched in terms
very different from those employed by
Mr. Attlee’s predecessor in the terrible
hour when he thrilled the nation, and
inspired the noblest response that a people
has ever given at the crisis of its fate,
by saying simply “I have nothing to offer
but blood, sweat and tears.” Under
socialism it is perhaps useless to ask
wilful or dumb-driven men to prove their
manhood by showing the better side of
their natures and giving their fellow-
creatures, particularly the helpless and
unfortunate, of their best. The socialist’s
fundamental appeal is to cupidity, and
those to whom it is. addressed —and in
Australia they are always so addressed
by ‘Tabor,” except when “Labor” is
frozen into silence by terror —are too
apt to behave like brazen and brainless
louts, cruel in their union strikes and
other forms of larrikinism as “pushes”
and mobs are cruel, and too thick-headed
to be capable of perceiving that in in-
juring others they injure themselves.
Sega, Booze and Betting.
Bega is a town of some 4000 people on
the N.S.W. South Coast, an area long
neglected by Sydney Governments and
apt to get the spike now and again.

CARRERAS LTD. • OVER 150 YEARS' REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
Bega people have been trying to get a
new hospital for years, and the other day
the whole blessed place knocked off
work and marched behind its band to a
protest meeting. There was great en-
thusiasm and plenty of speeches, and the
band played “Has Anybody Here Seen
Kelly?” Kelly being the McGirr
Minister for Health.
At the time Kelly was absorbed in
other things. A Sydney daily had got one
of its reporters into Callan Park mental
hospital, and his revelations were disturb-
ing. About the same time, too, it was
being made clear that N.S.W. Govern-
ment attempts to deal with t.b. were a
failure. And all over the State public
hospitals and institutions for the aged, in-
sane and incurable are to be found in an
aged, inadequate and/or almost incurable
condition —incurable, that is, while the
McGirrs and Kellys are allowed to
bumble along in their hopeless way.
All this was coming out in the week
when the McGirr “lott’ries,” ostensibly
run to finance hospitals, ended their
financial year with a profit of £2,043,000
—made on 164 “ordinary” and 23
“special” lotteries. McGirr or Kelly or
both are expected to be “gratified” by
this, but whether Bega will get its hos-
pital or a Callan Park patient a better
deal is questionable. Anyhow, Bega
would have been better advised to go for
a pub or a racecourse, booze and betting
sharing No. 1 priority in Sydney “Labor”
notions of progress.
While Bega was crying for a hospital,
the Sydney Turf Club, “Labor’s”
splendid contribution to the war effort,
was announcing plans to “recondition”
the disused Rosebery racecourse, an area
of some 85 acres in a congested district.
The S.T.C. wants it, apparently, in an-
ticipation of a mid-week racing bill which
one of those pro-“ Labor” journals tips
will be introduced this year “in compli-
ance with public demand.” And the
traffic in hotel transfers continues, even
where it entails the destruction of flats
and cottages in residential areas which
don’t ask for pubs and which are not
given the option of declining. So the
catering for the booze and betting
interests goes on, though Judge Markell
has stated that 90 p.c. of the criminal
cases that come before him have their
roots in drink or gambling.
POLITICAL POINTS
Every State Government reports a de-
ficit for the year to June 30, though in
some cases the figures are not final. Be-
fore going abroad Chifley announced an
“approximate” surplus of a million, and
it was a great deal more. Though ex-
penditure was more riotous than ever,
Chifley’s savage income tax brought in
an additional £36,000,000, and revenue
exceeded his estimate by £61,000,000.
What a Treasurer!
Quotation made on June 30, when the
income-tax year dosed:
Nothing can by any possibility tend more
to the corruption of a Government than
enormous revenues Weak and incapable
men have found themselves tumbling
in an ocean of banknotes, and they appear
to have lost all sight of where it came
from, to whom it belonged, and whether it
was possible by any maladministration ever
to come to an end of it.
Perfectly appropriate to the prevailing
Canberra dementia, it was part of a
speech delivered by John Bright to his
Birmingham constituents 90 years ago.
One hope for the countries behind
the Iron Curtain stems from Communist
vanity. From Stalin down, the new rulers
are consumed with a craze for having
pictures made of themselves, life-size
photos or villainous posters, for com-
pulsory display in public places and
buildings, even schoolrooms. On a
smaller scale, examples of this Red con-
ceit are to be seen everywhere. It
mightn’t matter if the subjects of these
“illustrations” had any pretensions to
good looks, but, with a few exceptions,
they run to hard, unsmiling chivs, bullet
heads and bull necks or no necks at all,
and the females (Anna Pauker, for in-
stance) justify Koestler’s theory that
Corns recruit their women from the kind
of girl who is never asked to dance.
Perhaps the Cominform turned against
Tito because his face and throat don’t
look as if they had been hammered out
by one of the symbolic tools and finished
off with the other.
The sugar position goes from bad to
worse. Ships have to clear at least 63,000
tons a month from Queensland sugar
ports to stop a premature closing of mills,
and they’re not doing anything like it.
And, because quality has deteriorated,
the C.S.R. has had to cut down grocers’
orders, meanwhile telling its shareholders
that losses amounting to “several million
pounds” threaten growers and millers.
It’s the same old trouble —wharfies who
won’t work,
“S. M. Herald,” winding up a warning
to Stalin in the vein in which it used to
warn the Tsar:
Democracy can afford no more Munichs.
The mistakes and miscalculations of 1938
must not be repeated in 1948.
Of “mistakes and miscalculations”
Granny was herself guilty in 1938, along
with the “Daily Telegraph.” Both were
then busy hounding on the Empire to
war for good old Czechoslovakia, though
Britain had no Spitfires or Hurricanes
and Australia couldn’t have fought the
Salvation Army. Defeat would have
been a very probable result, and defeat
would have had consequences even worse
than the consequences of victory.
Ward’s administration of Papua and
New Guinea has come under fire at the
U.N.O. Trusteeship Council, and the most
persistent sniper was Russia. Yes, Russia,
which Garden’s pal and patron for
many years extolled in season and out
of season ; of which he said, when Curtin
was packing his bags for “capitalist” Eng-
land, that it had “made more progress
in 25 years than any ‘capitalist’ country
has made in ten times that period.” This
ingratitude is almost enough to lock his
lips next time he feels the old inclination
to spit venom at “whisky-swilling British
imperialists” in Malaya and elsewhere.
The smashing defeat of the prices-and-
charges referendum showed that the
nation had grown tired of being pushed
around, and the revolt against compul-
sory voting in “State matters” is another
sign. Though not confined to N. S.
Wales, it is naturally most conspicuous
in N. S. Wales, the “ ‘Labor’ Govern-
ment” being what it is, and it has been
embarrassingly evidenced at the liquor
referendum and municipal by-elections,
compulsory voting in municipalities
having been wished on councils, regard-
less of their objections, by the super-
fluous Minister of Local Government, one
of the Cahills. As the “offenders”
number many thousands, Cahill and his
crew are afraid to' insist on fines, just
as they are afraid to enforce their indus-
trial laws.
Tasmanian Premier Cosgrove is on the
way out, though shure and he won’t ad-
mit it. Refused a trip to London and
the Empire Parliamentary Association
conference, though he was named in the
invitation (members turned him down in
favor of Shoobridge, president of the
Leg. Council, for whom he got a title),
he met Parliament with a reshuffled
Ministry, included in which is Dwyer,
V.C., who was Speaker. Straightway the
“Government” was challenged in the
Assembly on Supply, with another Coun-
cil challenge to come; and in the Coun-
cil “Labor” has only former Minister
D’Alton, who, refused office and House
leadership, has turned nasty. D’Alton
has put it to Caucus that Supply may be
granted and an Assembly election avoided
if Cosgrove steps down, but the Premier
says he will hang on come hell or high
water.
India is seeking the services of “at
least 200 Japanese technicians to assist
in the development of industries.” Pro-
vided the Occupying Powers agree there
should be no doubt about the willingness
of the Nips to supply 200—or 2000 or
2.000.000 —to assist in the development
of India or any other country now deemed
fit for nationhood. But isn’t that how
the departed British got a leg-in centuries
ago?
A judicial committee has recommended
all-round rises; for Ministers, members
and officers of both Victorian Houses and
equal pay, £lO5O p.a., for Ms.L.A.
(hitherto on £650) and Ms.L.C. (£350).
A similar committee, appointed in Wes-
tralia, recommended £960 p.a. (£360
more) for State members, and they are
getting it, though in each State the M.L.C.
has an easy job compared with the
Assemblyman—not that his is a killer;
in the West old gentlemen with 30 to 40
years’ service abound. The judiciary
should not accept these commissions.
It is wrong that Judges should expose
themselves to criticism on political
grounds.
Once more these State Governments
have had to call upon road-transport men
to get them out of trouble. Hanlon was
obliged to do it in Queensland during
the Communist blockade; and in the
dearth of black coal for their railway
services Hollway and McGirr have been
forced to waive their transport taxes im-
posed to blast road competition. Holl-
way ought to be the first Premier to
drop the impost altogether.
Under a new award shearers are to get
60s. 6d. a hundred. Shed-hands are
“upped” to £7 6s. Id. a week, pressers
to £7 19s. 2d. and cooks to £lO 16s. Bd.
or 16s. Bd. a man, all “with rations
found,” and young fellows learning to
shear are to receive a shed-hand’s wages
while learning. The award was made by
one of those Conciliation Commissioners,
J. R, Donovan, and it embodies the
equivalent of pay for two weeks’ annual
leave and a week’s sick-leave annually.
So the woolmen have to pay for the
holiday a shearer might take after he
finishes wheat-carting and before he goes
fruit-picking. It may be all right while
high prices and the labor shortage last,
but the testing time will come when they
end. Meanwhile, union bosses who hate
the A.W.U. and envy its success will no
doubt “formulate” their “demands.”
That Adelaide agreement (Pope and
the A.S.E.) excluding Communists from
the payroll, and providing for secret ballots
before strikes, brought screams of rage
from the Comrades. Thornton’s Red
Ironworkers threaten to “challenge its
validity” and talk about calling the Metal
Trades Federation into “the battle.”
Neither party to the agreement seems
at all ruffled.
Last Wednesday, when the news of the
falling-out of Stalin and Tito was 48
hours old, Sydney “Tribune” came on the
streets without a word on the subject.
Three days later it had the story and the
“oil” —not Persian:
While the Political Committee of the
Australian Communist party has not yet
met to discuss the matter, the “Tribune”
has no doubt that it will support the
attitude of the Communist Information
Bureau.
And there was a correction: Dimitrov,
not Tito, proposed a federation of Bal-
kan States, but, “in true Bolshevik
fashion, faced up to criticism and recog-
nised his mistake.” In other words, Dim.
grovelled and crawled at the crack of the
whip, just as “Australian” Communists
grovel, crawl and turn back-somersaults
at every twisty and change of Moscow
policy.
While Sydney people under shelter have
to go without radiators, gas and fuel
fires, there are others in worse case—
those whose business takes them abroad
when frosts whiten the landscape and
night temperatures fall below the forties.
Up and down the footboards of the
antediluvian Government trams, their
hands numb, their bodies exposed to the
icy blast, struggle the tram conductors.
Fine fellows for the most part, “good
unionists” and “good ‘Labor’ men” in the
party jargon, they have been as com-
pletely forgotten by “Labor” as the in-
mates of Government hospitals for the
insane, who have no votes.
Just before he left for London Chifley
said he would be “dealing with cold, hard
stuff —economics.” “Cold” and “hard”
are the words for his “Government’s”
attitude to the British people. It has
driven hard bargains in contracts for the
sale of foodstuffs; and it has been cold
to the Food for Britain movement ever
since it found that hostility wouldn’t serve.
Nobody who matters asked it to cut out
meat rationing, but this was done in the
chagrin of the referendum defeat.
Hitchins (Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation) and Cummings (Rationing
Commission) are convinced that it will
cut the British share of our meat by up
to 50 p.c., though butchers say it won’t.
The International Wheat Agreement
has evidently collapsed, leaving Pollard’s
“stabilisation” plan, which was based on
it, in the air, Pollard is calling the State
Ministers together to see what new wheat
wonder he and they can produce.
Sydney gas companies: who say they
have had to ration gas largely because
the union won’t work overtime are much
slower than their Melbourne congeners
in applying the remedy that lies in their
hands. The Federal Arbitration Court
judgment granting the 40-hour week
directed that, in each award to be con-
sequently amended, “there shall be in-
serted provisions empowering any em-
ployer to require any employee to work
reasonable overtime,” banning of which
is forbidden. Conciliation Commis-
sioners have conformed to the Court’s
directions. After trying appeasement,
Melbourne is moving for removal of the
ban, and, failing that, deregistration of
the union.
Sydney City Council, which used to
be strangely kind to Communists and
other “Russophiles,” has refused the use
of the Town Hall to the Australia-Russia
Society, though informed that “Mr. Clive
Evatt, Assistant-Treasurer and Minister
of Housing,” was to be one of the
speakers. Perhaps the rejected address
will now be delivered at Kogarah to
help the “Labor” candidate.
The old song of the battle lost for want
of a horseshoe-nail is coming true in
Australia. According to the Coal Board
there is not enough coal to make enough
steel to make enough shoes for pit-ponies,
and until there is “coal production will
be seriously affected.” The new song is
like one of those drunken ditties with-
out end, middle, beginning or sense.
Incidents of a week of rising prices and
rationing to unendurable levels:
The Sydney Turf Club, of Rosehill build-
ing notoriety, buys another racecourse —
83 acres in a crowded industrial suburb
—“for mid-week meetings.”
Racecourse (not s.-p.) bookmakers chal- -
lenge the AJ.C. impost, one per cent, on
turnover. Amount involved, £lOO,OOO,
which is one p.c. of £10,000,000.
Romano (formerly Azzalin or Orlando)
is fined £25 for unauthorised additions
estimated to cost £25,000 (“a new lift, a
new timber stairway, banquet hall, staff
quarters, second-floor bedrooms fitted with
basins and eight shower recesses”) to his
Wagga pub. The magistrate said “the pub-
lic must benefit from the functioning of
the hotel.” Nothing about the “benefits”
accruing to houseless servicemen. Nothing
about the £5OO fine imposed on the
benefactor, for income-tax “forgetfulness,”
in October, 1939.
“Now, all together, boys—Booze and Bet-
ting for ever!”

PERSONAL ITEMS
Archer Kyffin Thomas, editor of the
Melbourne “Herald,” who was recently
the central figure in an attempted armed
and masked hold-up by four youths,
comes of a dynasty of newspaper pro-
prietors. His father, the late Evan Kyffin
Thomas, was the son of William Thomas,
one of the proprietors of the Adelaide
“Register” and “Observer.” William’s
father, Robert, established the first news-
paper in Adelaide. Robert Thomas was
a London printer who had been served
with an order by his landlord to repair
his premises. Considering them to be
beyond repair he decided to seek pre-
mises elsewhere, and the South Australian
Company having just announced its First
Fleet to the new colony he decided that,
if he had to shift his, machinery, he might
as well shift it to Adelaide. He printed
the first copy of the South Australian
“Register” in London and the second in
a tent on the beach at Glenelg. Archer
Thomas was trained on his great-grand-
father’s paper, joined the ■ Melbourne
“Herald” in 1933, edited the Adelaide
“News” for four years, and was a war
correspondent with the U.S. forces in the
South and Central Pacific. He took the
“Herald” chair three years ago.
Having done his job—drafting a pro-
gramme of development for R.A.N. naval
aviation, to operate when our carriers
arrive next year—Commodore E. W.
Anstice, R.N., left last week for home.
More airman than sailor, he joined the
R.N.’s Fleet Air Arm as a lieutenant, one
of the first 50 officers picked to do the
original course for naval pilots. Last
scrap found him Deputy-Director of
Naval Air Division at the Admiralty;
later he commanded escort-carrier Fencer
in the Atlantic. He is relieved as Fourth
Naval Member by Commodore Guy
Willoughby, R.N.
Eric Bojesen, in Sydney from Germany,
has devoted most of his working life to
the relief of others. A Dane, born in
Shanghai and educated at a British school
there, he was allowed by the Japs to work
with Red Cross among the internees of
the International Settlement. When peace
came he left for a holiday in his home-
land, but found “holidaying” in the
misery and chaos of Europe more of a
nightmare, and offered his relief-work ex-
perience to U.N.R.R.A. Stationed at
Osterode, in the Harz Mountains in the
British Zone, he worked with an inter-
national team of eight on repatriation and
welfare of displaced persons, most of
them ex-slave labor. Supplies were almost
non-existent, and the team became super-
scroungers. When U.N.R.R.A. packed
up in June, 1947, Bojesen joined the In-
ternational Refugee Organisation, which
handles refugees all over the world. One
of Europe’s main problems is the collapse
of national morale among D.Ps. through
Hitler’s scheme of deliberate humiliation.
Accustomed to Europe’s bomb damage,
the visitor’s first impression of the Quay
railway was that Sydney also boasts its
ruins ; so far he’s met nobody to convince
him otherwise.
Celebrated his 89th birthday in
Adelaide, Brigadier - General George
Dean, who started soldiering with the
S.A. Mounted Rifles in 1880, took an
Australian Rifle team to Bisley before the
First World War to win the Mackinnon
Cup, and commanded the 13th Light
Horse in Egypt and on Gallipoli. His
most recent honor is having the rifle-
range near Adelaide named after him in
recognition of his services to rifle-shoot-
ing. Two years older than Dean and still
going strong is Edward Lucas, a member
of the Legislative Council for many
years and Agent-General in London in
the 19,20’5.
When the diocesan authorities in Mel-
bourne set out to find a substitute for Dr.
Floyd as organist at St. Paul’s, they made
it a world hunt. Advertisements were
printed in U.S., Canada and England and
selectors set up in each place. Over 40
pplicants were eventually narrowed down
to three or four and the field finally
confined to the ancestral home of organ-
ists and choirmasters, England. The last
adjudicator was Dr. William McKie, the
Victorian who functions in the high seat
at Westminster Abbey. He plumped for
a young man of 35 of Welsh and Scotch
extraction, C. A. Campbell Ross, now at
the stops in Melbourne, whose hefty list of
accreditations sounds like a passage from
the whole history of the Old Dart.
ORGANIST.
Latterly organist of St. Barnabas, Tun-
bridge Wells, and director of Erith Muni-
cipal Society, he was recommended by
Sir George Dyson, of the Royal College
of Music, Sir Percy Hull, Dr. William
Harris, organist of the Chapel Royal
and President of the Royal College of
Organists, and Dr. Dykes Bower, of St.
Paul’s, London. The new incumbent was
at Hereford Cathedral for 10 years and
had a good deal to do with the training
of the choruses for the Three-Choirs
Festival, the premier musical event of its
kind in Britain. Discharged from the
Army medically unfit, he studied at the
Royal College of Music, specialising in
conducting, and he is accompanist on
organ and piano. He later became con-
ductor of the Croydon Symphony Orch-
estra. His degrees are F.R.C.0., L.R.A.M.
and A.R.C.M. One of the conditions of
his employment is that he conducts one
major work per annum. He should fill
the bill as an A.B.C. guest conductor
and as assistant to Professor Heinze if
the cathedral contemplates adding a third
to its fine series of festivals of church
music,
A professor retires:
A substantial gathering of Sydney citizens
is making a presentation to Armand Bland,
who is off overseas after retiring from the Chair
of Public Administration at Sydney University.
Bland is an example of what can be done by
an earnest worker in a community in which
there is free enterprise and where thought is
not regimented. He was born on the fringes
of Redfem 66 years ago into a typical family
of the time —a family which lived within itselt,
the boys sharing in the household tasks from
the washtub upwards, the evenings spent to-
gether with little entertainment in the modern
sense except song and reading aloud. He had
an ordinary State-school education, which he
made extraordinary by the application of a
fine intellect. He ploughed his way by hard
work into the civil service. Then, working by
day and studying by night, he took his Arts
degree at 23, an LL.B. at 26, an M.A. a couple
of years later, and went to the London School
of Economics, from which he came back with
a determination that he would make pubhc
administration a major subject for university
study in Australia. ~ x , .. .
The professorship in the subject, founded in
1935, was entirely his own baby, and he has
for years been unchallenged as an administration
teacher, except in certain political circles in
which the subject appears to be studied at
Rand wick and in front of safe-deposit boxes.
In the last 13 years it has become impossible
for anybody in the Commonwealth to discuss
administration without quoting Bland, who yet
remains personally known to only a few, though
his thinking permeates the civil-service and
local-government thought and his text-books
are in use everywhere. It will be a pity it
a fine brain like his is lost in retirement. His
is the type of mind which would grace the
Senate and go a long way into turning that
House into what it should be—a constitutional
House with an improving influence on legis-
lation and a sobering influence on caucuses and
the other toadstool growths of contemporary
“democracy.”
Visiting his home town, Adelaide, for
the first time in 10 years. Dr. Norman
L. Munn, professor of psychology at
Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine,
U.S.A. Munn left Australia a quarter of
a century ago to study at Springfield
College in Massachusetts; he was then
an officer of the Adelaide Y.M.C.A. In
America he made a hobby of
degrees —he now writes Ph,D., M.A.,
BSc. after his name —and taught at
several colleges and universities before
coming to anchor in Maine. He has writ-
ten several textbooks on psychology, one
of which is in use in Australian, British
and American universities.
‘Tons” on a General, a Governor and
a Governor-General:
Lieut.-General Iven Mackay, K.8.E., C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., V.D., back from India, where he has
been representing Australia as High Commis-
sioner, can pronounce the name of India s new
Governor - General — C. J, Rajagopolachan—
without a tremor. He did so several times at
a Sydney luncheon served hot in the midst
of the gas troubles, which, in a way, was as
impressive as the General’s fluency, or the
Indian rope-trick, or any other marvels out ot
India. Rajagopolachari, the General said—the
trick, as nearly as the writer could discover,
lies in the first and last two syllables: thinx
of Rajah and chary and fill m quickly what
lies between —is a 68-year-old Madrassi, a
lawyer and a Congressman and was Governor
of Bengal, where he was as much a foreigner
as Casey, and where, like Casey, he showed
ability. Many Bengalis told Mackay of their
respect for Casey’s work, particularly for some
of his long-range projects, irrigation and tne
like, which he was unable to see completed.
Indians generally had expressed themselves
grateful for Australian wheat, sold at a lower
price than that extracted by some other nations,
at the same time politely suggesting that some
second-grade wheat had mysteriously infiltrated
amongst the first-grade stuff. Mackay said that
there was a wide opinion that if Mountbatten
had been given the job of vice-regally bossing
India 10 years earlier, recent history might
have been different. Mackay, knighted m
1941 for services in North Africa, belongs
to the large group of Australian soldier-
pedagogues, being, on the teaching side, bes
known as Headmaster of Cranbrook (Sydney)
from 1933 to 1940. He was also associated
with Sydney University —as a student at
Andrews, a demonstrator and later a lecturer
in physics and as student-adviser. Alter the
First World War, in which he collected a D.S.O.
and bar, a Croix de Guerre and two men-
tions,” was wounded and finished up in
command of the Ist Inf. Bde., he attended
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, for a year.
The man with the aggressive chin
drawn here by Coventry is Sidney Barton
Pope, who besides being president, in his
early forties, of the South Australian
Chamber of Manufactures, is managing-
director of Pope’s Products, the firm , that
turns out handy gadgets that sprinkle
water on lawns, tennis-courts, golf-
courses and lucerne patches and upon the
trouser-legs of anyone unwary enough to
come within range. The business started
years ago in a small shed when S.B. de-
cided to commercialise a garden sprinkler

his father had invented. It prospered to
such a degree that Pope’s are now the
biggest makers of sprinklers in the
Southern Hemisphere. It recently made
an agreement with the Amalgamated
Society of Engineers barring Commos
from its factories. Some of his spare
time Pope spends on his model dairy-
farm in the Adelaide Hills ; the rest finds
him playing cricket or tennis' —his grass
tennis-court is reputed to be one of the
best in the Commonwealth, thanks,
doubtless, to the Pope sprinkler.
Victorian author Tarlton Payment is
not only a writer of best-sellers. His
Cluster of Bees issued from The
Bulletin office, and he is so widely noted
an authority on the buzzers that
when the Japs found in Dutch depart-
mental archives at Buitenzorg, in Java,
the manuscript of one of his brochures
on malnutrition in bees they had it trans-
lated and published in Nippon. , Pay-
ment is finding his books as fecund as
his hymenoptera, In 1936 he won the
£5OOO All Nations Novel competition in
the British section for his The Valley of
the Sky, an Australian story. His book
has since gone into several American
and English editions and been earmarked
for the movies. The German edition has
for years been the most widely-read Aus-
tralian book in Europe. He has just re-
ceived a copy of the Czech edition trans-
lated from the German. He has written
several books of poems, composed music
for his own songs and runs a beerfarm
20 miles from Melbourne.
Professor Alexander Boyce Gibson,
who recently had an honorary degree of
Doctor of Laws conferred on him by the
University of Cambridge, has been Pro-
fessor of Philosophy at Melbourne Uni-
versity since 1935, occupying the chair
formerly held by his father, W. R.
Boyce Gibson. He has been a tutor at
Oxford and a lecturer at Birmingham
and Glasgow, and among his publications
is one called Philosophers Should Be
Kings. Bom in London, where his father
was engaged on a book on Formal Logic,
now a standard work on the subject, he
was educated at Melbourne Grammar
and Uni., finishing off at Oxford.
John Cain, Leader of the Victorian
Opposition, must hold the Parliamentary
record for verbal slips. When he was
head of a Labor Government which lasted
four days he was unable to get out of
the habit, acquired in many years of
Opposition, of referring to Albert Dun-
stan as ‘'the honorable the Premier,”
thus enlivening a dull period in Victorian
political history. Once more in Opposi-
tion, after a couple of years as Premier,
Cain came out with “I don’t know what
the Government is doing about coal,
putting off decisions day after day, week
after week, month after month, year
after year....” “Half a mo, mate,” was
Chief Secretary Dodgshun’s comment.
“We’ve been in office only six months.”
Into the Silence:
In Hamilton (Vic.), at 82, Traugott Johann
Noske, pioneer Victorian wheat-farmer who
founded the flour-milling firm of Noske Bros.
Some years ago he purchased the, old Temple
Court Building, Collins-street, Melbourne, and
built the new Temple Court —one of Aus-
tralia’s finest collection of offices.
In Sydney, Dr. R. R. P. S. Bowker, who,
after qualifying in London, returned to New
South Wales and practised at Stroud and was
medical officer during the construction of Cor-
deaux Dam. His father was R. R. Steer
Bowker, M.L.C.
In England, Lieut.-Colonel William John
Symons, the man to whom “Pompey
Elliott handed his own revolver at Lone Pine,
with instructions to recapture a trench me
Turks had taken. A Melbourne commercial
traveller before he enlisted, Symons was a captain
when he won the V.C., and in the Second World
War became a lieutenant-colonel in the British
Home Guard. His death leaves W. Dunstan,
general manager of the “Herald” and ‘ Weekly
Times,” the last survivor of the four Lone Pine
V.Cs. Major F. H. Tubb and Corporal A. S.
Burton were killed in action.
In Melbourne, at 93, John Donaldson, for
70 years an outstanding figure in Australian
life insurance. Elected an Associate or the
Institute of Actuaries in 1881, he was- appointed
secretary of the Australian Widows’ Fund Lite
Assurance Society in 1879, and after its amal-
gamation with the Mutual Life in 1910, served
as managing trustee until his death.
At Christchurch (M.L.), at 64, Herbert Per-
cival Lawry, stipendiary A native
of Hokitika, he was the son of Rev. Samuel
Lawry—the family has given over 160 years
service to Methodism. One ancestor was Rev.
Walter Lawry, who established the first mis-
sionary station in the South Seas m 1822 and
whose son (Henry) was the first Australian-
born Methodist missionary. H.P. s son, the
airman who spotted the Altmark and led to
her boarding by the Navy, met his death over
Norway.
In Melbourne, at 78, Charles MacDonald
MacKinnon, Victoria’s first Government
Cheddar-cheese expert. An Isle of Skye man,
he was invited from New Zealand by the
Victorian Government to teach the latest cheese-
making methods at the 1892 Exhibition. He
judged Royal Show cheeses for 20 years.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Findy”; Justice Stacy, of the N.S.W.
Bench, has ruled in an appeal case that
“an upward gesture with the thumb” does
not constitute offensive behavior, adding
of the man whose use of the gesture had
raised the question, “While his conduct
might be considered rude, it was not
offensive behavior according to an ob-
jective standard.” Therein lies the catch.
I have seen the gesture performed by
some of the foremost practitioners of the
art, and have noticed on the part of those
to whom it has been addressed an almost
unanimous refusal to take it objectively.
Usually their reaction has been violent.
Thumb-language has an ancient history.
Authorities are in disagreement as to
whether thumbs up or thumbs down was
the signal for polishing off a vanquished
gladiator, but at least they agree that the
thumb came into it somewhere. Putting
the thumb in the mouth has long been a
symbol of contempt. In Romeo and
Juliet a Capulet servant says of the
Montagues “I will bite my thumb at
them ; which is a disgrace to them if they
bear it.” He bites his thumb, they don’t
bear it and a brawl ensues. Supreme
insult, the thumb at nose with four fingers
outstretched has been the equivalent of
“fightin’ words” for hundreds, if not
thousands, of years. I should class it as
definitely offensive, yet the gentle ladies
who worked the Bayeux tapestry did not
hesitate to introduce it into their design.
During the war “thumbs up” became a
synonym for courage in adversity;
Churchill used the sign almost as often
as the “V for Victory.” The proper tech-
nique for “thumbs up” is to use both
thumbs and to keep ’em steady. It’s the
soaring, upward jab of the thumb that
causes tempers to rise. Rude? That’s a
question of mental outlook. Offensive?
Well, Stacy, J., says no, and surely a sober
Judge should know.

“Loco”: Railways in New South
Wales have been mercifully free of fatal
accidents since 1926, when two serious
disasters occurred. In June of that year
the Brisbane Mail was wrecked near
Aberdeen when crossing a wooden via-
duct; five persons were killed and 30 in-
jured. Three months later, through the
snapping of a coupling, part of a goods
train crashed into the North-west Ex-
press on the Murulla incline. The
wooden carriages of the express, which
was travelling at full speed, telescoped,
causing 27 deaths, while 40 other people
were injured. Last week’s accident to the
South-west Mail occurred near Harden,
on the main Melbourne line, about 240
miles from Sydney, when the train left
the line and crashed 20 feet down an em-
bankment into a rocky gully. As in the
earlier disasters, the wooden carriages
crumpled ; four passengers were killed
and 18 injured. A preliminary inspection
suggests the accident was caused by a
broken rail rising and getting caught in
the bogie of the tender, or by a rotteh
sleeper giving way. In view of the
amount of passenger traffic over the line
the death-roll, considering the circum-
stances of the smash, is thankfully small.
Two divisions of the Melbourne Express
had passed a few hours earlier and the
Temora Mail half an hour before the
smash.

“Bo”: This modern age is full of
mysteries; how ragtag and bobtail
Commo “organisers” on about £8 a week
manage to live on the best at around
£l5OO p.a.; what “personage” found it
convenient to dump over £7OOO in “hot”
money where it would be found ; how
those bookies who pay out such huge
winnings to “Labor” stalwarts manage
to resist the temptation to “Moscow”
their bags at Uncle’s ; why gas bills are
larger for the period during which you
were away on two weeks’ holiday; why
women insist on getting the clothes bone-
dry before damping them down for iron-
ing ; why Sydney tram intersections have
signalmen while traffic cops are there
doing the same work ; why fountain-pens
only run dry when you’re miles away
from ink—these may be capable of solu-
tion, but one that has me stumped is this;
what happens to the old metal between
railway tracks? Every so often over the
Sydney suburban network I see new blue-
metal dumped between the rails for
spreading. It is invariably put straight
on the old metal, which is, seemingly,
never removed. Our suburban lines have
been filled up many times, and by the
quantity put between them over the years
they should be a couple of feet high
above the rails. But they are still the
regulation few inches below them. Can
it be that the old metals, jostling each
other with the vibration of the trains
passing overhead, thus reduce themselves
into dust and are blown away?

“Bethune”: “Apart from tomato-
sauce, what will pies go with?” asks

when pie-carts still plied their trade? A

large plate of steaming-hot peas with
a meat-pie floating in the middle, it was
the basis on which many tidy fortunes
were built. How many- digestions it
ruined in the process I won’t attempt to
guess. But it would be no use trying to
introduce it again today. Where would
you get the peas?

“Kelms”: Perth, like other Australian
capitals, has a surplus' of females, yet an
advertisement from a “wallflower” ask-
ing for an escort to a ball brought 150
responses from males who either couldn’t
find their soul-mates or were temporarily
at a loose end. It must have jarred the
applicants a little to discover that the lass'
wasn’t a wallflower, that the ad. was a
joke by her girl friend and that she was
to be married the following week to her
fiance, who, incidentally, took her to the
ball.

“S.G.”: When a former champion
boxer opened a pub in Maryborough,
Queensland, years ago his bar was
well patronised for a start, and he seemed
well set for a successful career as Bung.
But it didn’t last. Around the walls he
hung a dozen or so large photographs
of glove experts. One Saturday after-
noon a patron who had imbibed a
gallon or so too much lurched against
a picture, spun round and, taking
it for a real opponent shaping up,
swung a punch and smashed the
glass. The ex-pug leapt the counter,
knocked down the drunk and deposited
him outside. A week or so passed and
another drunk made the same mistake
with the same result. Then the epidemic
started. Hardly a week passed without
one of the pictures being smashed, and
every time it happened Mine Host would
jump the bar and lay out some of his
customers. Soon there were no pictures
left to smash —there was no one to smash
them, anyway, as Bung had scared away
all his trade. He sold out and left the
game. ,

“P.P.”: Blobb, a finicky bloke, fumed
into the bar talking about the insolence
of the modern world. He had lunched at
a cafe where his roast beef was served
with a blob of mustard on the side of his
plate. He was fond of mustard, he de-
clared, but it should be put on the table
in a pot, giving, the customer the option
of helping himself. Since hearing his
complaint half a dozen of us have been
going regularly to the cafe for lunch,
glad to find a place where mustard is
served at all.

“M.M.8.”; Others than those men-
tioned in B. 16/6/’4B have climbed Mt.
Wilhelm. Early in April, 1944, an Ameri-
can Liberator on a recce flight to Hol-
landia crashed into Wilhelm about 500 ft.
from the summit. The crash was reported
by natives to the A.D.0., Chimbu, and
W.O. Bert Wickham of Angau left
for the scene. Wickham reported large
patches of snow several inches deep. The
wreckage was scattered over a very wide
area and he succeeded in finding only
six bodies, which were brought back and
interred at Tema (Chimbu). In June an
American Graves Registration Section
visited the area. They climbed to the
wreckage, and found the three remaining
bodies. They, too, reported snow, and
the bodies, though fully exposed, were
in a perfect state of preservation. I be-
lieve some members of the party also
climbed the remaining few hundred feet
to the summit. In late September, 1944,
Major H. A. Johnson, of Survey Director-
ate, 2 Aust. Corps, climbed Mt. Wil-
helm, and several weeks later made the
ascent again armed with barometers and
survey equipment with a view to making
a survey, later returning with materials
to make a permanent trig, point on the
summit. This venture was abandoned
as visibility for weeks on end was prac-
tically nil. Major Johnson found the
stone cairn built on the summit; also
the piece of paper (in zinc film container)
signed and placed there by Leigh Vial
and on which Mclnerney and Wickham
had reported their success. Major John-
son added his signature to those who
had been successful in scaling British
New Guinea’s highest peak.

“S.E.R.”: Australia’s “Rising Sun,”
cut in the Wiltshire Downs (Eng.), is once
more shining forth in all its glory.
Carved in the chalk hills by Diggers in
1917, it was! kept clear of weeds and grass
by the villagers of Codford, but when
the Luftwaffe came zooming overhead it
was too obvious a landmark, so it was
covered over with soil. Harry Beilby,
himself an Old Digger and now an im-
migration officer at Australia House, was
down that way recently selecting Polish
migrants. He told the Poles about the
“Rising Sun” and its significance. In a
few hours volunteers had cleared all the
dirt away from the emblem of their future
home. A fine gesture from new Aussies
to the Old Diggers.

“Becks”; Every week-end hundreds of
hikers go tramping in the Blue Moun-
tains. Most stick to beaten tracks, but
the more adventurous hit out into more
difficult country, making their way along
deep gullies and over narrow ridges. For
two or three days they enjoy the sensa-
tion of being explorers, walking by day
and camping out at night, and at length
emerge from the mountains at some in-
habited spot, not necessarily the one they
set out to reach. It is good healthy
recreation which deserves encouragement
in a generation which tends to prefer a
spectator role to active participation in
sport. But about once a month a scare
is raised about “lost hikers.” Search-
parties are organised, press- and radio-
reporters conjecture on the fate of the
“missing” youngsters and give progress
reports cff the activities of the searchers.
Invariably the lost ones turn up, protest-
ing that they were not lost at all and
wondering what all the fuss is about.
Latest instance involved a party of a
dozen or so girls in the charge of
a young woman who left Springwood on
a two-day trip and took three. By the
time they reached their destination —they
were “found” when nearly there —police
with dogs, civilian parties and an aero-
plane had joined in the hunt for them.
There was a refreshing note about the
report of the girls’ behavior when they
reached Emu Plains railway station.
When reporters sought an interview “they
locked themselves in a porters’ room.”
Beach flappers would have fallen over
each other to pose for photographs,

“Macnell”: The Royal Navy has sent
its best and fastest aircraft to the Inter-
national Air Exposition to be held in New
York next month. The squadron will
comprise Sea Furies, fast single-seater
fighters with five-bladed screws and power-
folding wings for easy stowage; another
fighter, the twin-engined Sea Hornet; and
the Navy’s jet fighter. Sea Vampire.
Planes v/ere shipped in the brand-new
carrier Magnificent, built for Canada in
Belfast.

“Muskeen”: Merino rams (B. 2/6/’4B)
are as scarce in Collins-street as in
Martin-place, but few Victorians are
aware that there is a fully-equipped 20-
stand woolshed five miles from Mel-
bourne G.P.O. It is situated at Fleming-
ton and is conducted by E. C. Coverdale,
who, in addition to shearing throughout
the year certain sheep consigned to New-
market yards, also feeds stock of all
descriptions bound for the same destina-
tion.

“Ray Whiting”: Palestine held three
dangers far more serious than an odd
bomb: they were arrack, tent-ropes and
sht-trenches. A decent session on Wog
beer could be a menace, especially
on a black winter’s night, when the
ground was a quagmire and the deep slit-
trenches around each tent were overflow-
ing with half-frozen ooze. Once
after lights-out we heard in the distance
above the beating rain and savage flap-
ping of tent-sides the bombardier’s velvet
tones giving detailed instructions to a tent-
rope on where to put itself. As he drew
nearer he broke into an Army version
of Tosti s “Good-bye” with tent-rope
variations, and appeared to be nearly
home when there came the sound as of a
gutser from a great height, and we knew
the “bomba” had vanished into 7ft, of
wet hole. Blue, nearest the flap and half
asleep, stuck his head out and flashed a
torch. “S’orlright,” he muttered, drag-
ging the blankets back over his head.
“Only the old Bert —got mud in his
beer.”

“Jemac” goes into some cages:
So you think you know your Zoo. You’ve
laughed at the black bear rearing awkwardly
for a bun, watched the steel-springed litheness
ot a great cat and seen the contempt in a
leopard’s yellow eye for you and all Saturday
zoo-comers. But Tarqnga Zoo seen with Dr.
Coenraad, one of its veterinary surgeons, on his
early-morning rounds, is totally different. Then
the lions, sitting in bored majesty for their
week-end audience, come running to the keeper’s
call like great kittens, rubbing and purring. A
jackal heavy with pups trots familiarly to the
vet s questing fingers, and Dodo, the ape,
wriggles ecstatically as his rump is scratched
with a scrubbing-brush. Closed to the public
is the “hospital.” Here animals recently arrived
from India and Africa are acclimatised before
being put out to public gaze; others, sick or
injured, are cared for. There is a koala with
broken leg in splints, a peccary worth its weight
in gold for bag leather, a Malayan bear recently
anaesthetised and operated on, and two full-
grown monkeys, once pets, now needing proper
supervision. Their amusing brothers scrambling
for biscuits in the pit outside would tear them
to pieces if introduced. Animal-feeding visitors
are the Zoo’s worst enemies. The vet. re-
members an ostrich that sickened and died;
post-mortem revealed intestines punctured with
lead-pencils. An elephant fresh from a jungle
diet of grass and shoots was caught by his
keeper filling up on meat-pies. A man-size
purgative camouflaged in honey fixed him.
Sydney’s last ’flu epidemic knocked the mon-
keys, but sulpha drugs in lollies saved them
all. About 12 monkeys are born each year.
Leo’s wife has three babies; a new giraffe and
zebra are due in a month. Cold-blooded
snakes are warmed in constant temperature all
winter. * Under each cage two heating-lamps
circulate hot air through perforated chimneys.
There is an Australian green python from
Cape York, first one keeper George Cann,
trapping for 38 years, has seen caught, shedding
its skin next to an albino Japanese tree-snake,
only one of its kind in Australia. Their main
diet is rabbits and rats. Rats are killed before-
hand, not from pity—Coenraad believes monkeys
are the only animals afraid of snakes—but
because several snakes have been severely bitten
by their live dinners. A rat once bit a gorged
tiger-snake’s head off. The vet believes also
that pity for zoo captives is often misplaced.
Animal needs are simple, he says—food and
sex-life. Whea these are provided, plus expert
attention and absence of fear —he instances the
case of a lioness saved from a diseased kidney
■ —their life span is considerably longer than in
their natural habitat.

“Willow”: Flights of fancy in cricket-
reporting (B. 23/6/’48)? Personally I
like ’em. But Neville Cardus was not
the originator. In the “Gentleman’s
Magazine” in 1833 the Rev. John Mit-
ford wrote of
The unrivalled William Beldham, called,
for love and respect, and for his flaxen
locks and fair complexion, “Silver Billy.”
lt was a study for Phidias to see Beld-
ham rise to the strike; the grandeur of
the attitude, the settled composure of the
look, the piercing lightning of the eye, the
rapid glance of the bat were electrical.
Men’s hearts throbbed within them, their
cheeks turned pale and red. Michael Angelo
should have painted him. Beldham was
great in every hit, but his peculiar glory
' was the cut. Here he stood with no man
beside him, the laurel was all his 0wn....
He took the ball as Burke did the House
of Commons, between wind and water; not
a moment too soon or too late.
Of “Good David Harris,” a bowler, he
said:
A good cricketer, like a good orator,
must be an honest man; but what are
orators compared to the men of cricket!
There have been a hundred, a thousand
orators; never was but one David
Harris, Many men can make good speeches,
but few can deliver a good ball. Many
men can throw down a strong enemy, but
Harris could overthrow the strongest
wicket. Cicero once undermined the con-
spiracy of Catilene; and Harris once laid
prostrate even the stumps of Beldham.

“Mike Rikey”: I am forced to agree
with “J.K.” that Gordon was a major
poet since my discovery of an Adam
Lindsay Gordon Steeplechase, which is
run at Mt. Gambier each year. Austra-
lians do not take their racing so lightly
as to immortalise a minor poet in a rac-
ing programme. t

“Clooter”: In the days of my youth
there was a Dr. Frank Crane who made
a fortune with his “Tonic Talks,” syndi-
cated throughout the English-speaking
press. In them he told us how to meet
“Only one —my husband's been ordered off the stuff.
the ills and worries of the day, how to be
sunny and bright, how to realise that
nothing is so bad that it couldn’t be
worse. Another bright soul of the period
was the Frenchman Coue, with a notion
that ill-health could be overcome by the
sufferer repeating so many times a day
“Every day in every way I am getting
better and better.” There must have
been good money in those stunts, and
I’m wondering why a prophet hasn’t burst
upon us these times. Anybody with a
formula that would convince the average
cove that the world is a better and
brighter place than it ever was should hit
the jackpot —if he could do it. One of
the greatest paradoxes of human nature
is that although the human memory
readily forgets pain and other bad things
and keeps and cherishes the good recol-
lections, human nature seems to prefer
reading about disasters of all kinds; no
newspaper editor would give tuppence
for a story of a successful marriage, for
instance, though there are thousands,
whereas a marital failure, spiced with
adultery or suicide or murder, hits the
front page every time. A newspaper
which resolutely banned everything bad
only the good and cheering
stories of life wouldn’t last a week. Good
news might have been like cold water to
the thirsty in Biblical times; these days
it’s bad news that sells the papers.

“G’pa”: The Pentridge prisoner’s Mel-
bourne fountain (B. 16/6/’4B) has just
gushed again after a drought of 11 years ;
its last performance was during the cen-
tenary celebrations. Stanford, its sculptor>
was not lagged for assault, but for horse-
stealing and highway robbery, and
“Nakh” errs in saying he slipped back
into sin after his release; he set up in
business as a monumental mason, and
several jobs, one over his wife’s grave,
stand in the St. Kilda cemetery bearing
his name. «

“Pitt St”: When the Oliviers opened
in Sydney last week with a “premiere”
of “The School for Scandal” suc-
cessful business-people of the city
were there with their womenfolk,
all duly photographed and written about
in the flapper press, and Olivier a
handsome speech at the close, and “a
good time was had' by all.” It’s sup-
posed to be a wonderful revival of the
drama or the theatre or something, but,
fine Thespians as they are. I’ll wager
there wouldn’t have been half the fuss
had the Oliviers never appeared on the
fillums. And if Literature and the Arts
were represented on the first night no-
body noticed them.

“Conda”: Mention of Commander
Oldham, last observer in the R.A.N. (B.
23/6/’4B), recalls the passing of a trade.
From 1921 till 1939 the R.N. officer-
observer, with his telegraphist air-
gunner, was the only completely naval
element in the Fleet Air Arm, now Naval
Aviation. Most pilots in carrier-aircraft
and our cruisers’ Walrus amphibians were
Air Force, and naval pilots originally
held Air Force commissions. The ob-
server’s responsibility was navigation,
enemy reporting and shadowing, air-
gunnery, meteorology and ship and air-
craft recognition. All these duties are
now combined in the pilot. Paradoxi-
cally radar-detection brought the ob-
server’s specialised function to a peak
and sounded his death-knell —day-time
reconnaissance and shadowing being
nullified by ships’ radar capable of spot-
ting aircraft scores of miles away.
* * * *
“Jasby”: There are signs of another
outbreak of the chain-letter swindle that
swept the country about a dozen years
ago, bringing unearned wealth to a few
and deserved losses to thousands of
gullible easy-money chasers, in the pro-
cess swelling the profits of the P.M.G.’s
department. This time the racket will
probably not get very far; once-bitten
mugs will shy clear of it. But there is
another lurk which will go on as
long as the housing shortage continues.
Only capital needed is the price
of an ad. in the “To Let” columns of a
daily paper. An attractively-worded ad.
brings hundreds of letters, most of which
contain postage-stamps to coyer the
hoped-for reply. It is not a racket that
appeals to the big-time operator, but it
will provide beer and tobacco money.
I’ve never met one of the tribe yet, but
I have contributed lots of money in
stamps without once receiving the
courtesy of a reply. Genuine advertisers
could easily send every applicant who
encloses a stamp a one-line note stating
the house or flat has been let.
“Power s off again!"
“M’s B.”: The chap with the paste-pot
and bag of posters jumped from the
wrong side of the tram, ran diagonally
across the road, stopped dead while a
heavy lorry brushed past him, sidestepped
a light car and got safely to the kerb,
where he proceeded to paste up his “Road
Safety Campaign” posters.
* * * *
“Zake”: My neighbor’s relatives up on
the Bellinger (N.S.W.) railed him a
case of oranges, pre-paying the Is. 6d.
freight. When he went to collect it at our
Sydney outer-suburban station the
official pointed to a slit through which
the oranges and three chokos, which the
family had put in as an afterthought,
were visible. “Those chokos make
it perishable goods,” he said. “It’ll
cost you another eight and eleven,” The
consignee protested that he didn’t want
the chokos —he had vines running mad
around his own backyard, and even his
fowls were getting fed-up with them, in
both senses. But the parcels man was
adamant. To get the oranges the con-
signee had to cough-up 3s. each for three
utterly useless chokos. But the part I
like about it is the “perishable.” A
month after the oranges, if uncollected,
had been reduced to a mass of mouldy
corruption the chokos would still be as
hard as, if not actually harder than, when
they were picked. But, then, how could
a railway regulation be expected to know
that?
* * * *
“Dong”: Owners of the sievelike
memory have their worst moments when
attempting to introduce to someone a
long-lost friend whose name they have
forgotten yet who remembers theirs with
clarity. ' As the wife steered me
away from one of these embarrassing en-
counters she told me of a remedy ap-
parently common among the ladies: “If
you forget their name just go ahead and
mumble something. It always works.
It sounded good, and as we turned the
corner and ran slap into another face I
knew I had a chance to put it into action:
“My wife —Mr. Bldlwzk.” The little
lady looked at me in blank amazement,
forgetting all and flooring me completely
with “ Who did you Say?”
* * * *
“T.L.”: Tree-planting by Royalty (B.
16/6/’48)? My aunt Lady Legge, whose
husband was equerry to George V, had a
small Royal plantation at her home at
Slough, near Windsor. At one time it
boasted trees planted by every crowned
head in Europe. All grew and flourished
with the single exception of that planted
by Kaiser Wilhelm II; it grew to about
4ft. and no more. My aunt declared that
this phenomenon portended the German
Emperor’s stunted reign.
* * * •
“Plop”: It is a howling shame to see
those magnificent little liners displayed by
the shipping companies serving out their
scale-model commissions in glass cases
when they could be bringing joy to a
host of bath-tub skippers like myself,
who have to content themselves with navi-
gating their nailbrush through the same
old sponge-and-loofah minefield. While
inspecting my particular fancy recently,
a smooth two-funnel, twin-screw master-
piece, a small boy hauled his father to
the window and joined me in my wor-
ship. His parent spoke of Aunt Ella wait-
ing at the corner, of the fruit-salad and
ice-cream that would follow their meet-
ing, but the lad’s nose was stuck on to
the glass like a vacuum sucker. Then,
casting a hopeless eye over the model’s
intricate rigging, the man declared:;
“All right, daddy will make you one just
like it when we get home if I can find a
nice piece of wood.” Propelled by this
irresistible force, the immovable object
went to meet its auntie.
* * * *
“P.0.M.C.”: I’m in favor of St.
Andrew’s golf committee’s proposed new
rule permitting suspension of match-play
in cases of danger to players from light-
ning. While I was caddying for my father
on Cottesloe (W.A.) links nearly 40 years
ago lightning struck a mid-iron in the bag
on my shoulder. I felt nothing except
fright from the flash, but it split the
haft neatly and stained the head sky-blue.
Reshafted, that mid-iron smote many an-
other pill, but the discoloration remained
despite all efforts to remove it.
* * * *
“Cine Ma”: Olivier in his screen ver-
sion of “Hamlet” settled a nice little philo-
logical problem which used to bother me
in my schooldays. When Hamlet attempts
to follow his father’s ghost on the battle-
ments of Elsinore and his companions
try to stop him he draws his sword and
says: “I’ll make a corpse of him that
lets me!” Olivier makes him say “pre-
vents me.” Shakspeare used “let” in the
old sense of hinder, or impede in doing;
the original sense survives in the legal
term “without let or hindrance” and in
tennis, where a “let” is a serve which
touches the net in passing over.
♦** * ,
“Don 5”: One explanation of why
German morale slumped so badly in
1945 is supplied by Goebbels’s diary:
The Fiihrer devoted an extended chapter
of our talk to the vegetarian question. He
believes more than ever that meat-eating
is harmful to humanity. Of course he
knows that during the war we cannot com-
pletely reverse our food system. After the
war, however, he intends to tackle this
problem.
Win or lose, the poor devils had nothing
but a cheerless prospect ahead of them.
♦ * * *
“Bagot”: On a Saturday morning 30
shopkeepers in a Perth arcade found
themselves unable to open up for busi-
ness, reason being that some joker
had jammed matchsticks into the
keyhole of every door. Locksmiths
were called, but in some cases en-
trance could not be made until just be-
fore closing-time at noon. An epidemic
of this queer form of humor is indi-
cated ; shops in a couple of suburbs have
since been similarly treated.
* * * ♦
“Blue P.”: A Tasmanian Merino buck
worth lOOOgns. had a brawl with a mate
and looseijed two front teeth. The owners
thought he mightn’t be able to eat
properly, so took him to a dentist. But
since a sheep has no upper teeth and re-
pairs with wire or cement would have cut
into the upper pad nothing could be
done. It turned out all right; the stumps
grew up from the gums and the ram was
able to nibble along and do well. Still,
nobody need, have worried. It must be
10 years or more since the Soviet
scientists, who’re always so far ahead of
their backward capitalist contemporaries,
startled the world by fitting false teeth
to a cow. The strides they’ve made since
then —even unto sheep that shed their
wool and don’t have to be shorn —would
make retoothing a ram child’s-play.
WAIST-WHITTLERS.
“Women are buying ‘waist-whittlers’ —a new type
of corset to go with the New Look —according to
Sydney stores.” —Sydney “Sun.”
They’re out for the latest new jigger
By those who engage in the biz
Of making the feminine figure
A little less like what it is;
A piquant invention which science
At woman’s disposal has placed,
The midriff-reducing appliance,
The gadget for whittling the waist.
Is the shape of the hour-glass so luring,
You ask, to the helpmate of man
That there’s little she shrinks from enduring
To copy it —near as she can?
Does she thrill with excitement and tremble
With pleasure at Fashion’s decrees
When her contours are faked to resemble
The frames of the wasps and the bees?
Those statues of Venus that meet us,
Those gems that art-galleries show,
Of Milo and eke of Miletus
Envisaged long ages ago
From models Greek sculptors depicted,
Should banish the notion afar
That women, amidships constricted,
Look better than —just what they are.
But who the blue blazes can tussle
With Fashion’s most fanciful freak
Who once recommended the bustle
As an adjunct to feminine chic?
If smartness is what you intend to
Attain, be you matron or maid,
’Tis she whose demands you will bend to,
The goddess who must be obeyed.
No canons of Art will demolish
Or cause her to alter her view
That here is the ultimate polish
On the Look that is scheduled as New.
It stands for a sign of superior
Discernment, a token of taste,
The girdle around the interior,
The gadget that whittles the waist.

A heartening performance, and evi-
dence of the management’s success in its
assault upon the big reconversion and
transition problems it was up against.
s*^ es * n 1945 and 1946, aggregating
1506,057, are a reflection of these
problems, which followed the switch
from war-time production of guns, air-
craft > engines, munitions, etc., that had
c .... a ca pital outlay of over a
million pounds, to a fresh, complex and
expensive layout to meet the motor-
vehicle and ancillary requirements of a
hungry market by modern mass-produc-
tion methods.
In 1946 plant got less than half a meal,
and a lot of unremunerative work had
to be undertaken. Ordinary production
—the mounting of locally-made bodies on
imported chassis, and manufacture of
service parts and accessories, as well as
a wide range of industrial equipment,
ranging from refrigeration plants to ball-
bearings and diesel engines—didn’t begin
until the last half of 1946, and nearly £3-
million-worth of work foreign to normal
activities was undertaken to hold the team
of skilled and other workers together.
Also, the deigning of new models, includ-
ing production of an all-Australian car,
has called for heavy outlay on both
capital and expense account.
A combination of increased physical
S?nL a ™ rising P rices S£ nt turnover
(£14,044,735) up by £5,733,040, or 69 p.c.,
last term. Sales of non-vehicle products
accounted for much of the increase. The
outturn of motor vehicles was about two-
thirds normal pre-war volume; this
mainly because of the labor problem, in-
cluding absenteeism, restricted supplies of
raw materials, finished and semi-finished
components and delays in assembly work ;
an unholy combination which expressed
itself in production inefficiencies. Chassis
from U.S., Canada and U.K. arrived
faster than bodies and other components
could be turned out and the lot put to-
gether.
Excluding non-recurring items, inter-
lined in the table, the net result of the
last three years’ trading was a profit of
£64,315. Last year’s £570,372 of profit
was written after setting aside an extra
£323,680 for depreciation (£510,134), but
leaves out of the reckoning a surplus of
£21,918 on sale of fixed assets and an
equity of £3585 on account of undistri-
buted subsidiaiy earnings. No provision
was made for taxation, because of offsets
allowable in respect of the losses already
referred to. The saving in this respect in-
flated the net result by over a quarter of
a million pounds. If taxation at current
rates had been payable, it would have re-
the net figure to something over
£j00,000,, or enough to pay the pref. div.
and show 15.2 p.c. on the £1,750,000 of
ord. capital. The £570,372 covered pref.
requirements and 30.6 p.c. on ord. capital,
all but a fraction of which is held by
General Motors Corp., the big American
parent organisation. Since money is
wanted in the business, the ords., which
averaged 28.2 p.c. for the seven years
to the end of 1944, were passed by for the
third year in succession.
As for the future, most important de-
velopment is the co.’s decision to make an
all-Australian medium-sized car in the
lower-price group. In this respect good
progress has been made. The engines are
being machined and put together at
Fishermen’s Bend (Port Melbourne),
where a new building will house about
£ 1 i-million-worth of plant and equip-
ment for the purpose. The bodies
and some chassis sheet-steel pressings are
to be turned out at Woodville (S. Aus.),
where a big extension programme is also
in hand. Subject to the limitations im-
posed by labor and materials, the new
car is expected to be on the road during
the last half of 1948, and volume output
to be achieved early in 1949—about 2000
additional skilled and other workers are
wanted to bring output to planned level.
Rigorous durability tests on the new cars
show that “in economy and general per-
formance they possess all essential quali-
fications to meet Australian operating
conditions.”
The year’s net addition to the book-
value of plant was £1,414,877:

amount coming to trade creditors (mainly
affiliated cos. for materials) by £935,414
the board went to its bankers for an extra
£1,217,493 and reduced stocks by
£524,196. The shrinkage in the more-or-

£885,475.

The extraordinary expansion of earnings
since war ended—profit has more than
doubled over the last two years—reflects
the heavy demand for engineering, elec-
trical and other capital equipment, etc.,
to meet new needs and make good war-
time wear and tear and obsolescence.
And, owing to industrial development and
inflation, demand and prices are both
likely to settle at higher-than-pre-war
levels, though probably at a lower level
than today. Because of all this, and the
tight-fisted attitude of the Federal Trea-
surer and other high-priests of finance
concerning overdraft accommodation for
trade and industry, the board has had to
get in more share capital. In August,
1946, 150,000 new 14s. ords. were offered
and readily taken, two for five, at par.
That lifted paid capital to £375,000,
and reduced the amount of outside money
at risk in the business for every pound
belonging to shareholders from 18s. sd.
to 14s. Bd. over the 12 months to end
April, 1947. Last term the business con-
tinued to expand at such a pace that the
figure had grown to over 18s. again at
April 30 last. Here is the financial setup
as the published accounts show it:

* Including provision for tax and contingencies.
The £155,754 added to liabilities last term
they include an unspecified provision
for taxation and contingencies—together
with surplus earnings, went mainly into
stocks (up £125,437) and book debts (up
£89,266). The more-or-less liquid sur-
plus (£442,690) was £61,570 stronger than
at the previous balance.
To relieve the pressure another 150,000
14s. ords. are to be offered, two for
seven, to those on both pref. and ord.
registers at July 1 at a premium of 14s.
each. The premium, difficult to justify,
has been insisted upon by the Treasury.
The issue, which has been underwritten
by A. W. Harvey, Law and Co., will
raise paid capital to £480,000 in 25,000 £1
7 p.c. cum. prefs. and 455,000 ords. of
14s. each, and bring in £90,000 of share
premiums. The pref. div. and 10.1 p.c.
to the ords, will then call for £47,705, or
6.1 p.c. on capital and reserves com-
bined. Last year’s profit (£85,217, up
£31,454), easily the best in the co.’s
history, was equal to 14.5 p.c. on share-
holders funds (capital and reserves
combined) employed, or sufficient to
cover the pref. div. and show a
juicy 23.8 p.c. on the £350,000
of ord. capital as against 14.9, 16.3, 14.7,
15.7, 15.6, 15.6 and 8.1 p.c. back to
1941. The div. was kept at 10.1 p.c., and
has been for the last 11 years. For the
16 years before that those in the en-
gineering and ancillary trades were faced
with a combination of high costs and
severe competition, especially from cheap-
labor countries, which culminated in
slump in the early 1930’5. During this
period divs, averaged 2.3 p.c. and £70,500
of the ord. capital was jettisoned.
On the market the ords. advanced from
335. in April last to 365. following an-
nouncement of the new issue. Including
brokerage, the net price at 365., after
exercising the rights, is 345., at which
figure the return is 4.1 p.c. on a 10.1 p.c.
div. basis. The wide margin between
earnings and distributions gives the pre-
sent rate of div. a comfortable appearance
under existing conditions. What the
more distant future holds for the busi-
ness-engineering and electrical supplies,
lubricants and various hardware lines —
nobody can say at the moment. Includ-
ing the new capital and share premiums,
net tangible cover is 235. 3d. ords. and
£3l 6s. Id. prefs. The prefs. seldom
come on to the market.

The dislocation and expense inevitably
associated with structural alterations and
reorganisation were responsible for the
slight easing of the 1947 profit figure.
Turnover had increased “considerably,”
It continued to advance last term, when
more goods came forward. But they didn’t
get much of a chance to linger on the
shelves, thanks to a buoyant national in-
come, “full” employment and high wage
rates. So despite the lift in operating costs
—partly offset by disappearance of War-
time (Co.) Tax —and a further paring of
gross margins by the price-fixing
authority, the board was able to write net
earnings at £47,091 (up £3386), best since
1930. That was after dropping £5OOO
from somewhere into reserves.
The £47,091 was enough to give the
prefs. their 9 p.c.—a reminder of the
dear-money days of the 1920’s—and show
an attractive 19 p.c. on the £200,000 of
ord. capital, compared with 17.3, 18.4,
13.8, 7.6, 7.5 and 12.4 p.c. back to 1942.
The div. remained at 12£ p.c., making
average distribution over the last dozen
years 10.8 p.c. On shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined) the year’s
net result was 10.6 p.c., a high rate which
suggests shrewd buying, a tight hold upon
controllable outgoings and lively turn-
over.
Though prices are being forced steadily
upward by inflationary pressure—that
conservative indicator, the Federal “C”
series index, has risen by approximately
10 p.c. in the last 12 months, compared
with a rise of 23 p.c. during the whole six
years of war—the public still has plenty
of money in its pockets and plenty of
jobs to work at. Together with abolition
of clothes rationing, this favors mainten-
ance of a high level of turnover, for a
while at any rate. Precisely what effect
transfer of price-control from Federal to
State authority W4II have upon the co. --it
specialises in tailoring, mercery and sport-
ing goods—will not be known until
details of the State Government’s policy
in the matter are announced. The blanket,
or ceiling, method of control over all
prices seems unlikely to be continued.
Competition should keep margins narrow
on lines no longer in short supply; but
some rise in the price of woollen and
cotton goods can be expected to follow
withdrawal of Federal subsidies on pro-
duction of wool and cotton yarns. Sooner
or later, however, demand will be ad-
versely affected by rising prices; much
then will depend upon the management’s
skill in handling stocks, among other
things.
Here are the co.’s balance-sheet
figures:

The £32,066 added to stocks last term was
partly a hedge against inflation, scarcities
and delays in delivery, and partly the
result of higher prices. Outside liabilities
(up only £2774) include a mortgage of
£99,000. When the books closed more-or-
less liquids exceeded liabilities by £14,543,
an improvement of £17,419 over the
twelvemonth.

New Broken Hill Consolidated
This co., still in the development stage,
is ultimately expected to rival its big
neighbor and friend, Zinc Corp., as a
lead-zinc producer. The two cos. have
interlocking directorates, and Zinc Corp.
(through its recently-formed subsidiary,
B. H. Corp.) owns about 30 p.c. of the
£846,474 of capital. The ore is treated
in Zinc Corp.’s mill, and the ore-bodies
above No. 18 level are worked from
openings in Zinc Corp.’s leases. To
handle the lead and zinc lodes below No.
18 level the downcast airway (13ft. 6in.
diameter) is being converted into a haul-
age shaft (completed to 2633 ft. at end
April) and a new service shaft (20ft.
diameter) is being sunk some 90ft. s.-e.
of the haulage shaft. Also, £1,500,000 or
more is to be spent on equipment and
underground development during the next
few years, labor and material permitting,
of course.
After nearly five years of war-time
delay production began in a small scale in
1945, and is still modest. However, com-
bined with extraordinarily high metal
prices, it was enough to enable the co.
to pay a maiden div, of 20 p.c. last term:

GOLDSBROUGH MORT
AND COMPANY LIMITED
Speech by Chairman (Mr. K. M. Niall) at Annual Meeting
in Melbourne on 25th June, 1948.
PROFIT AND FOSS ACCOUNT:
Our net profit this year is the high-
est since 1929, although, in making
the comparison it must be remem-
bered that two increases in capital
have been made since that date.
The extraordinarily high average
prices realised for wool and stock
this season have increased our gross
earnings to the highest point on
record. Although we have often
handled greater quantities of wool,
we sold record numbers of stock—
totalling over 4,150,000 sheep, 280,000
cattle and 110,000 pigs—which real-
ised high prices. Value of land sold
exceeded £2,250,000.
The average price for wool this
season (38Jd. per lb. and over £49
per bale to the end of April, with the
market still rising) is the highest
that has been recorded over a full
season since the Australian Wool-
broking Industry was established by
the founders of this Company a cen-
tury ago. To offset this, however,
costs are also at record high levels.
Without taking into account In-
come Tax and the special Grant to
the Provident Fund Reserve, this
year’s expenses still total £1,000,000
and only three times in the history
of the Company, namely, in 1944,
1947 and this year, have our gross
earnings exceeded that figure.
Tou will gather from the above
remarks and from the Directors’
Report already circulated, that any
lengthy continuance of profits on
the scale achieved this year cannot
he relied upon, and your Directors,
therefore, felt it wise, when recom-
mending an increased distribution
to Shareholders, to do it by way of
bonus. It is particularly gratifying
to us that we are able to do this in
this year which marks the Centenary
of Richard Goldsbrough commencing
business as a Wool Broker in Mel-
bourne. We have also thought it
wise to make a special Grant of
£20,000 to the Staff Provident Fund
Reserve to assist the Company’s con-
tributions in leaner years. You will be
interested to learn that, as a result
of the New Share Issue, the Provi-
dent Fund now has a substantial
holding of the Company’s shares.
COMPANY’S OWN PROPERTIES:
Our New South Wales and Queens-
land properties generally have had
favorable seasons and our flocks —
which were much reduced by
drought—have been built up con-
siderably by good lambings. Re-
cent rains have assured the posi-
tion for some time ahead.
Regrettable losses —especially in
breeding ewes —have however been
occasioned by the prevalence of the
Blowfly pest, notwithstanding that
everything possible has been done
to keep the fly In check. This pest
is causing increasing worry.
We are still unable to overtake
the arrears of maintenance and im-
provement work—the legacy of war-
time difficulties —and, in fact, it is
often very difficult to attend to the
necessary seasonal work. In spite
of continual efforts to obtain
workers, the number of employees
on our Stations at present is nearly
one-third less than it was pre-war.
In encouraging the development
of many new types of manufacture
we seem to be running the risk of
exceeding our manpower resources.
We are convinced that there is a real
danger of this trend being carried
too far, with serious consequences to
the economy of the country.
PESTS: ,
Seasonal conditions appear to
have Influenced a serious increase in
the prevalence and virulence of the
Blowfly. The C.5.1.R., in conjunc-
tion with various other interested
bodies, has carried out extensive
research into methods of combating
the fly, but this season graziers in
many districts have had heavy
losses in spite of the application of
the most advanced techniques.
Many reports have come to hand of
sheep treated soon after being struck
which have nevertheless died;
usually, sheep treated early should
quickly recover.
TAXATION:
Taxation continues at unreason-
ably high levels for peace-time and
has a depressing effect on initiative
and energy. The Government has
recognised its effect on the develop-
ment of pastoral country by extend-
ing the total exemption from In-
come Tax enjoyed by lessees in the
Northern Territory for a further
term of five years. The arguments
supporting this decision could be
urged in connection with large areas
of country under the control of the
various States —in fact, most of our
pastoral country requires risk-taking
of a type discouraged by present
rates of taxation, and substantial
reductions are needed to correct this.
To make the most effective use of
Australia’s limited working force
there is a strong case for the diver-
sion of productive employment of
a substantial proportion of the in-
creasing number of persons em-
ployed by Governments or Govern-
ment agencies. The urgent need
of the old world for foodstuffs and
raw materials may not continue in-
definitely and now is the oppor-
tunity to gain a splendid goodwill by
establishing ourselves as a prompt
and efficient source of supply.
A depressing instance of a diamet-
rically opposite tendency is the slow
turn around at the wharves which is,
in itself, quite sufficient to turn the
scales against us when competition
amongst suppliers is normal again.
In spite of the ravages of wm - , world
populations are still increasing and-
this, together with the desire to lift
living standards, emphasises the
need to continue the development of
our food producing potential.
THE WOOL. MARKET:
The season opened on a higher
level than last season’s very satisfac-
tory closing rates, and, except for a
short, sudden decline In March,
prices increased in practically every
series and at present are 50 per cent,
to 60 per cent, above opening rates
for finer descriptions and, approxi-
mately, 30 per cent, above for
broader qualities.
The world was hungry for wool
—an untravelled Australian cannot
realise how depleted are the ward-
robes of Europe. With the practically
complete clearance of the previous
season’s clip and heavy drawings
from the stock pile controlled by
the Joint Organization, the way was
clear for demand to be concentrated
on the season’s clip. In addition to
the demand for immediate clothing
needs, thefre was probably some
purchasing to avoid currency de-
preciation, and an important factor
is the improved spending power of
people overseas, due to the gener-
ally higher level of wages.
The demand was more general
than in the previous season and, in
particular, United Kingdom pur-
chases showed a welcome recovery
as a result of some improvement in
their export business. Strong sup-
port was received from Continental
countries (including Russia) and,
more recently, Japan. Australian
mills (aided by subsidy payments)
gave strong support. U.S.A. opera-
tions were not as prominent as in
1946-47 but that country took useful
amounts, including some high priced
specialty lines. It appears that a
greater number of countries are be-
coming manufacturers and users of
wool, which should be to the ad-
vantage pf the Commonwealth, as
should be the fact that considerable
research directed to improving still
further the appearance and wearing
qualities of woollen materials is be-
ing carried on in Great Britain,
America and elsewhere. This should
be more marked later on, although
at the moment it is not practicable
for manufacturers to apply the very
striking discoveries under present
conditions of serious shortages of
utility lines and often strict govern-
mental controls.
Owing to Industrial trouble
centring on the wharves, an already
lengthy season was made unduly
protracted—two serious dislocations
of the selling programme occurring
in December and March. The hold
up of shipping thus caused was par-
ticularly deplorable in view of world
shortages of both wool and food.
THE GOLDSBROUGH
CENTENARY;
This _ year completes 100 years
since Richard Goldsbrough set up as
a Wool Broker on the corner of
William and Flinders Streets, Mel-
i bourne. _ T. S. Mort first sold wool
by auction in 1843, or 105 years ago,
and this Company is the direct suc-
cessor of the organisations estab-
lished by these two, the founders of
the Industry in Australia. The
businesses of R. Goldsbrough and
Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, and Mort
and Co., Ltd., of Sydney, were
amalgamated in 1888, and eafly in
1890 the combined businesses became
known as “Goldsbrough, Mort and
Company Limited.”
An interesting sketch of the Com-
pany’s history and a review of the
Industry as a whole are given in a
booklet recently compiled and issued
by the Company, entitled “WOOL
AND THE NATION.” Persons in-
terested may obtain a copy on appli-
cation to our Offices in any Capital
City, and I am sure many share-
holders, at all events, will like to see
from what very small beginnings
the Company has grown until now it
has 100 Branches and Sub-Branches

It was the rise in metal prices
that put most of the fatness into
earnings. Here is the average

Silver 4 0 3 8.8 3 11.7
(All figures in sterling.)
Continued strengthening of the
figures since the close of
accounts —shown in the last
column —augurs well for the
current year’s earnings. The
Australian ceiling for lead and
zinc (£A22 a ton) is now less
than 20 p.c. of the export price,
and less than half cost of pro-
duction.
Scheduled ore produclion for
1948 is 127,000 tons, and the
figure is to advance by annual
steps to 330,000 in 1955. De-
velopment and exploration, both
laterally and at depth, suggest
that the mine is likely to live up
to official anticipations. When
the books closed cash, etc.,
totalled £1,082,189. Liabilities,
including the div., were £348,302.

FINANCE AND INDUSTRY.
The Copland Dollar Plan
Professor D. B. Copland’s
plan to borrow dollars from the
United States in order to finance
essential, “reproductive” imports
and at the same time hand
Britain dollars in repayment of
our sterling debts has received
varying amounts of publicity
arid a mixed kind of reception
from different authorities. Cop-
land’s idea is that the restriction
on the import of essential raw
materials and capital equip-
ment from the United States
should be slackened, thus en-
larging our productive capacity
and removing many bottlenecks
arising from scarcity of essen-
tial materials. He does not sug-
gest that we should alter our
import policy as regards most
consumer goods, except where
such a change would have the
same effect as greater imports of
capital goods.
Professor Copland, who was
one of the authors of the
Premiers’ Plan, Professor of Eco-
nomics at Melbourne Univer-
sity, adviser to the Victorian
Savings Bank, then economic ad-
viser to the Federal Treasury as
well as Commonwealth Prices
Commissioner, later became
Australian Minister to China,
and is at present Vice-Chancellor
of the National University at
Canberra. He suggests that objec-
tion might be taken to the plan
in Britain, which was still try-
ing to maintain London as an
international financial centre.
He added that a difficulty could
arise in payment of interest on
the loan and in repayment of
the principal later on. Ob-
viously a great deal would de-
pend on the extent to which the
dollars were used reproduc-
tively. And, of course, “first
catch your loan”—apparently
from an underwriting house, not
the U.S. Government.
“Employment” and Production
Copland, reviewing the situa-
tion in Australia generally, said
output of our basic materials
had increased very little since
1939, and was now much less
than was required to maintain
those at present employed in full
production. It would be better
to describe our so-called “full
employment” as “employment”
of large numbers at far below
industrial capacity. Which sup-
ports The Bulletin’s descrip-
tion of the situation as “full
employment in a payroll form
only.”
There were computed to be
2,334,900 persons earning wages
and salaries at the end of
March, exclusive of rural
workers and domestics. This
compares with 1,730,200 in July,
1939. But N. S. Wales coal out-
put is below that of 1938-39,
and so is Commonwealth out-
put of bricks, stoves and many
other building materials and
fittings, while butter production
is well down compared with pre-
war years, and so is the output
of beef, mutton and lamb.
Cheese and pork are being pro-
duced in greater quantities than
in 1939.
Iron and steel outturn is
greater than before the war,
plant having been much en-
larged, but it is not equal to
the figures achieved in 1941-42
in spite of the huge demand for
steel. The call for electric light
and power and gas is now far
wider than before the war, but
the supply of N. S. Wales coal
is smaller. The enlarged
capacity of our steelworks,
mostly in N. S. Wales, also calls
for more coal, but the N. S.
Wales coal deficiency is not fully
made up by production from
other States, which, nevertheless,
have •an expanding output of
black and brown coal, however
inadequate even for their own
purposes.
Money-volume and Inflation
The 35 p.c. increase in total
“employment” since the war
started has added to consumer
purchasing-power a great deal
more than it has added to pro-
duction. Since the beginning of
1948 the 40-hour week has be-
come general in the Common-
wealth, and the lack of balance
between money-creation and
goods - and - services: production
has increased. The civil-service
payroll is still growing in spite
of the “retrenchment” that is
supposedly going on in war-time
establishments.
During 1947 there was a de-
cline in savings-bank deposits,
allowing for additions of in-
terest. Since January there has
been a steady increase again, the
total at April 30 reaching
£667.8 million, compared with
£245 million in 1939. The total
volume of money at the call of
the people is similarly increas-
ing.
Obviously the forces of infla-
tion are still rampant within the
community, and over the past
six months the 40-hour week,
plus Communist mischief on
the coalfields, along the water-
front and in most other key in-
dustries, has weakened the
attack that increased post-war
civilian production should be
making against war-time and
post-war monetary inflation. The
community is thus ill-equipped
to meet any sudden lifting of
price-controls, but it is up to the
community to see that the real
cause of price inflation is dealt
with. A Government which
really governed would have dis-
posed of the inflation menace
in this country before now.
The Sharemarket
In this inflationary atmos-
phere the sharemarket remains
strong, on the whole. The slight
weakness in some stocks for the
past month has been almost im-
perceptible when merged into the
whole list. Broken Hill Prop,
fluctuates a shilling or so above
or below 60s. The market is
waiting on the announcement of
a new issue, expected about the
time of the annual meeting. A
big tinplate works is to be set up
at Port Kembla. A.C.I, also
proposes to make a new issue,
and the shares have risen to
685., a record figure on the pre-
sent basis of capitalisation.
Tooth scrip at 795. is only
slightly below the year’s peak
prices North Broken Hill has
come back to 965, after exceed-
ing £5 per ss. share, but the de-
mand for scrip is sustained.
In the textile section Yarra
Falls (worsted) and Bradford
Cotton are sought after at near-
record prices. Felt and Textiles
ords., on the other hand, at
61s. 6d, show a drop of 6s. 6d.
on the highest quote of the year..
United Provisions has turned
out to be one of the few mar-
ket disappointments. In the
food-canning and bacon-curing
business, present quotes of
16s. 6d. for the ords. compare
with a “high” of 245. 3d. in
1947.
Following a report that Placer
Development, through wholly-
owned U.S, subsidiary companies,
had struck an oil-gusher in
Texas (the flow being at the rate
of 50,000 gallons a day through
a half-inch choke), the dollar
shares leapt from £lO to
£l3 10s., but last week came
back to £ll. Placer has an
issue of 779,545 shares. In its
1947 report the co. stated that
drilling could not commence
until “an operating agreement is
negotiated with the two major
oil companies that hold a 37£
p.c. mineral interest in these
areas.”
On Sydney ’Change a new
goldmining issue, Mt. Eba, is
gaily soaring into the blue
among the quotations. The
2s. 6d. shares have risen to 155.,
buyers, in a few months. This

stock excites a great deal more
gossip than it does actual share-
dealings, though these are con-
siderable. A new issue of

offered, which will raise the
total issue to 200,000 2s. 6d.
counters. The further sum of
£2OOO was to be paid by June 8
if the option over the property
(near Kanowna, W.A.) was to
be extended. At 15s. a pop —if
that level is maintained, ex
rights the market capitalisa-
tion of this development show
is £150,000. Anyone tempted to
pay 15s. a share for the stock
should run their eye over the
record of Westralian gold flota-
tions in the gold boom of the
mid-’thirties. Of course lots of
speculators look for market gold
rather than mine gold. And, of
course, many of them are left
looking.

THE COLONIAL SUGAR
REFINING COMPANY LIMITED
Points Developed from the Chairman's Address to Shareholders
The coming season’s Australian cene
harvest should yield about 800,000 tons of
raw sugar, approximately a normal pre-
war crop. Whether the whole crop will be
harvested depends on a sufficient supply
of cane cutters and on the speed of
handling of the sugar at the ports by
waterside workers.
Compared with 1939, watersiders now work
fewer hours per day, have greatly increased
amenities, receive attendance money on days
when no work is available, holiday pay and
annual leave, and earn a good average
weekly wage. In return, the daily rate of
work on sugar is less than half what it was
in 1939.
Before the war 100,000 tons of raw sugar per
month were shipped from North Queens-
land ports. Bast season only 41,000 tons a
month were shipped.
* * *
Without considerable improvement in
the rate of waterside work, enormous
losses of cane and sugar, worth several
million pounds, are likely to be sustained
by the cane growers and millers. The
loss of the food will fall on the United
Kingdom, and possibly on the Australian
consuming public.
This situation obviously jeopardises the
sugar industry’s ability to hold its oversea
sugar markets. The refiners and representa-
tives of the millers and growers and of the
shipping industry have collaborated to
present the position fully and plainly to
the Stevedoring Industry Commission.
Quicker turn-round of all vessels is urgently
needed. More ships will merely aggravate
the problem in most trades by still further
congesting the ports, as they lie idle waiting
for the watersiders to handle them.
* * *
The whole of the raw sugar produced in
Fiji is made at the Company’s mills and
last season reached 140,000 tons.
* ♦ ♦
In New Zealand, following a further in-
crease in the cost of raw sugar (im-
ported), also increased factory costs, the
wholesale price of refined sugar increased
recently by £4/2/6 a ton.
* * ♦
Refined sugar for use in Australia de-
livered in the past year exceeded all
previous records, but, despite this, short-
ages occurred.
Such shortages of refined sugar would no
occur if we had full supplies of labour ant
coal and efficient use of ships to transpor
the raw sugar.
* • *
, year of rationing our sales
in Australia of sugar, golden syrup and
treacle averaged 35,600 tons per month;
they have since increased to 39,400 tons.
Last year’s sales amounted to 458,000
tons, an increase of 124,000 tons, or 37
per cent, over pre-war deliveries.
A considerable portion of this increase is
represented in the sugar contents of food-
stuffs manufactured for export.
The mechanical capacity of our refineries is
about 500,000 tons of refined products a year.
Therefore, the increase in sales, remarkable
thouh it has been, has not overtaken our
refinery capacity.
Our refineries are continuously short of ex-
perienced and settled labour.
Many individual employees work some over-
time, but we have not the numbers to obtain
full results from the plant at most of our
refineries on a 40 hour week basis, and so
cannot operate our larger factories beyond
such basis.
As a safeguard against possible further in-
creases in the demand, and to assist quick
recovery following stoppages, large sums of
capital have been allocated for additional
refining plant.
But the work will take a very long time and
all the expenditure and the extra machines
will not assist the position if deficiencies of
materials and labour continue.
* * «
Unfortunately, owing to the short supply
of raw material, slight rationing of the
methylated and industrial spirit produced
at our distilleries has been necessary,
* * *
Production in our Building Materials
factories during the past year was, in
general, approximately the same as in
the previous year, and the output was
again lipuited by deficiencies of raw
materials, due largely to lack of railway
trucks, shortages of coal and labour,
strikes and electricity failures.
At the Cane-ite factory the output was less
than during the previous year. At Concord
Plaster Mills, the output was less than half
the capacity. In view of the heavy demand
tor the State Housing programme, these
fosses In production are most unfortunate.
The manufacturer of asbestos cement has
also been restricted because of the short
supply of asbestos fibre.
The costs of producing our building mate-
rials have risen steeply due to the introduc-
tion of the 40 hour week, electric power
failures, rail and shipping freight increases
of approximately 40 p.c., and increases in
cost of coal, wrapping materials, container
board, paper and jute sacks.

Industrial chemical activities are to be

establishing an Employees’ Provident
Fund. This year marks the Fund’s

is £275,000 of pref. capital.
Total new share issues by pub-
lic cos. announced during the

Sulphide Corp. has received
an offer from the Broken Hill
Corporation (investment sub-
sidiary of Zinc Corp.) to buy
not less than 90 p.c. of Sulphide
shares at 345. 4d. for the prefs.
and 15s. 7d. for the ords. Judg-
ing by the market rise in the
scrip following the offer the deal
will go through.
A Canberra Surplus
The P.M. and Treasurer, Mr.
Chifley, says there may be a
Budget surplus of about
a million for the year just
closed. Taxation collections £6l
million above estimates have
converted an expected deficit of
£3O million into a small surplus.
An extra £l9 million was paid
into the National Welfare Fund,
and £lO million was contributed
to the International Monetary
Fund.
The “National Income”
Australia’s “national income”
for the financial year just closed
is estimated at £1571 million, an
increase of £306 million (24 p.c.)
over the 1946-47 figure. This
should mean heavy income-tax
collections in the current year
(1948-49) as well as from pay-
as-you-earn taxpayers last year.
But the high “national in-
come” is not all it seems by any
means. It was a year of in-
adequate coal output and of
sub-standard production in many
basic industries; though the
wheat harvest was a record,
the wool clip was only about
average. Inflated costs and
prices were principally respon-
sible for the 24 p.c. increase in
last year’s “national income.”
The return for an average wool
clip was a record at around
£l4O million, compared with
£39 million in 1938-39, when the
“national income” was estimated
at £BO3 million. A bigger wool
cheque is expected in 1948-49.
Higher money wages have
come with a rush since the end
of the war, and from January,
1948, the 40-hour week has
really added to payrolls more
than to leisure, more overtime
and “week-end time” being
worked at higher rates.
Australia’s economic strength
and prosperity depend more
upon production per man per
hour than upon inflated
“national-income” figures which
are based on payments as much
as upon receipts. We are getting
nothing like the production
needed from the 2,334,900 per-
sons now in jobs (excluding
rural workers and domestics),
which compares with 1,730,200
in 1939.
Maoriland Taxes
Cut spending, cut taxes, revive
incentives; in a nutshell this is
New Zealand businessmen’s
blueprint for prosperity, and,
with Labor’s 13th Budget due in
less than a month, they’re build-
ing hopes of long-overdue tax
relief. Little Maoriland, carry-
ing a tax load of £l4O million
annually, is the most taxridden
and overgoverned country in the
world. It’s exhibit No. 1 for
State extravagance, outsize State
departments, red - tape and
bureaucracy. Sorely-tried in-
dustry, struggling uphill, doesn’t
know where to turn for capital
to replace old machinery and
plant or buy new, and traders,
hedged round with controls and
overloaded with costs, aren't
finding it easy to keep stocks
abreast of needs as prices go
higher. On the employment front
the State has all others licked as
tax-money is poured out in un-
equal competition, with State,
local-body, business, institution
and private employers all bid-
ding against one another for
workers at fancy rates of pay for
short hours.
With the labor force too small
to go round, production and
living costs higher than ever,
business and every John Citizen
taxed to the limit, and an average
of Bs. in every £ seized by the
Treasury, Maorilanders are
working two days out of every
five to meet taxes. Yet even this
doesn’t satisfy the Labor spend-
thrifts, who take millions addi-
tional in loans to support their
big spending spree. Govern-
ment heads scorn to hold out so
much as a carrot to stimulate in-
dustry or private worker, but
draw tighter the maze of restric-
tions and controls. If taxes were
halved —and they’d still be twice
as high as in 1936, when Labor
first got its hands on the reins—
Maorilanders would have to
work just one day a week for
the State, would have more
money in purses and pockets,
and wouldn’t be so hit by prices ;
but will Maoriland Laborites
bring themselves to wield the
economy axe?
It’s an idea as old as Adam
Smith that the State and every-
one is better off when every
Tom, Dick and Harry is left
enough of his wages to keep him,
the missus and the kids happy
and to give him a will to work.
The same goes for industry.
New Zealand’s biggest build-
ing combine, Fletcher Holdings,
Ltd., with a brood of 10 subsi-
diaries, has lifted turnover above
the £5 million mark for its latest
year (to April 30), and hopes to
do better when labor and raw
materials are freer. Now a mil-
lion-pound co. (a quarter of a
million ords'. were issued in
April), it has established a foot-
hold in Western Samoa. Three
years ago it allocated the C.S.R.
250,000 ords. at a premium of
ss. War contracts gave Fletchers
a big push and helped the pups
to get firmly on their feet.
Aggregate net earnings of
£78,174 just declared don’t show
much growth over the last couple
of years, but knight James
Fletcher, head of the show, has'
the industrialist’s slant on earn-
ings in ranking them second to
development in the building-up
stage. Among recent moves,
Fletchers bought out the interest
in Pabco Products (N.Z.), Ltd.,
formerly held by the Australian
subsidiary of Paraffine Com-
panies Inc., San Francisco.
THE N.S.W. FLOODS.
By “K.A.S.”
The damage is enormous,
Dairyfarmers have suffered
dreadfully. Apart from actual
stock losses, heavy on the Rich-
mond, winter-feed grass has been
covered by silt up to a foot in
depth. Even the most optimistic
estimate says dairy production
will not be normal for six
months or more.
Among the crops, bananas,
small crops, and maize were the
hardest hit. Many banana plan-
tations were entirely levelled by
the wind, all others partly so.
The industry has been dealt its
worst blow since the bunchy-top
epidemic of 20 years ago. Hun-
dreds of acres of vegetables
were destroyed. Damage to the
40,000 acres of maize hasn’t yet
been assessed, but is certainly
severe. The cane-crushing sea-
son has been set back from a
week on the Tweed to a month
on the Richmond.
The bill will probably run to
seven figures—the sober Grafton
“Examiner” reports that the
Clarence Valley alone may have
suffered to the extent of
£500,000. No figures areyetavail-
able for the Richmond area—
hardest hit of all —or the Tweed.
Australia’s richest agricultural
area has been laid on its back
for the second time in three
years. There is no doubt that
floods are becoming increasingly
frequent on thejiorthern N.S.W.
rivers—there were four local
floods on the Tweed during
1947—and something must be
done about it.
Primary cause of the increased
tendency to flooding is denuda-
tion of the hills in the catchment
areas. The clearing of the
scrubs, either for timber or to
permit cultivation, opens the
way for erosion. Consequently
the streams silt-up, become shal-
lower and the unchecked run-off
floods them more and more
easily. On the Tweed, which is
silting-up at an alarming rate,
banana plantations round the
headwaters are a main cause of
the repeated floodings.
Schemes to relieve the position
don’t take this factor sufficiently
into account. The plan to dam
the upper Clarence is an excel-
lent one, but it will benefit only
the Clarence. It is doubtful if
a dam is practicable on the
Richmond, a narrow river wind-
ing over a wide, level flood-plain.
The whole Tweed valley is in-
tensely cultivated, and any dam
would inundate valuable farming
property. Both rivers would be
better served by a general
scheme of levees and embank-
ments.
The real cure will begin when
a policy of reafforestation and
erosion-prevention on slopes in
catchment areas is put into effect.
If this were made the basis of
a scheme which could include all
the other preventive measures—
weirs, embankments and regular
dredging—the N.S.W. northern-
rivers area would be pretty safe
from flooding.

If Sydney hasn’t seen better

English comedies —is superb in
every way. The production is
beautifully and completely con-
ceived, and beautifully and com-
pletely executed in every de-
tail —from Olivier’s fine old Sir
Peter Teazle, Vivien Leigh’s
flighty young Lady Teazle,
George Relph’s Sir Oliver Sur-
face and Peter Cushing’s Joseph,
to Cecil Beaton’s elegant cos-
tumes and settings, to the
Handel-Beecham music and to
the Vast good humor that over-
lays the complicated nonsense
and the ridicule it casts on the
vicious drawing-room gossips of
the day.
“Richard III,” however, had a
crack right across it, and, by the
time he had claimed the throne,
there was such a gulf between
comedy that bordered on bur-
lesque and tragedy that neither
Olivier’s acting nor all the mag-
nificent costumes, scenery and
skilful stage-effects could lift the
audience across it. The first clue
to the trouble came with the
opening soliloquy, part of it
borrowed from “Henry VI.”
Olivier concluded his introduc-
tion of Richard’s clever, cold-
blooded malevolence, his twisted
body and his ruthless ambitions
with “Can I do this, and cannot
get a crown? Tut! Were it
further off. I’ll pluck it down,”
but he said it with something of
the same light flippancy as the
“Aren’t we devils?” with which
a Sydney radio clown accom-
panies his practical jokes. And
from there, until Richard takes
the throne, Olivier played the
role with such an accent on
comedy that it bordered on a
burlesque of villainy, an ap-
proach that couldn’t be more
destructive, since “Richard” is
as much a melodramctic study in
villainy as anything.
There are several grounds for
Richard’s humor, of course. His
deformities would have been an
accepted butt for humor in
Shakspeare’s day. Or, from an-
other angle, humor as a natural
fierce defence against pity, curi-
osity or ridicule aroused by his
twisted figure would be in
keeping with the character. And,
again, it could be argued from
the actor’s point of view that it
is harder and more ethical to
play the role for laughter than
to play it for pity or sympathy.
But the humor with which
Olivier invests the part falls into
none of those categories. It is
a detached kind of amusement,
almost as though Olivier were
making fun of the role rather
than assuming the character of
Richard laughing at the world
around him. Where grim sar-
donic jesting might have been
expected there was, instead, a
gruesome clowning that re-
called Walter Gore’s recent
dancing of Mr. Punch.
Another argument that could
be advanced on behalf of
Olivier’s Richard is that it is, at
least, an interpretation. In that
case, however, it is not a sus-
tained one. When, after he
clambers to the throne, Olivier
suddenly drops all his comic
business and becomes a wonder-
ful Richard, drawn in all his
arrogance, fear, courage and
savagery, he requires the audi-
ence, already tempered to
comedy and laughter, to plunge
suddenly into tragedy. He asks
it, in fact, to believe in the very
character he has been practically
holding up in burlesque. The
mdience, even forgetting the sec-
tion more interested in furs and
orchids than Shakspeare, couldn’t
do it. It shuffled and coughed
and fidgeted during the ad-
mittedly awkward ghost scene,
excellently contrived though it
was, and it laughed when
Richard offered to swap his
kingdom for a horse. Olivier’s
acting in these scenes was
nothing short of wonderful,
and the audience should and
could have been spellbound by
the spectacle. That it wasn’t was
nobody’s fault but Olivier’s, he
having earlier discarded the
foundations on which the char-
acter is built. Only after some
lurid swordplay with Richmond,
when he died like a writhing,
tortured snake in a scene which
Shakspeare never devised, did
Olivier more or less paralyse the
spectators.
There are other repercussions
from Olivier’s jollity. While he
holds the character —and the
play with it —up for laughter the
rest of the cast are required to
play solid, serious Shakspeare.
That some of them, particularly
George Relph, in a beautifully
sustained and controlled per-
formance as Buckingham, and
Peter Cushing’s moving perform-
ance as Clarence in a striking
version of the death scene, the
play’s one moment of sheer
tragedy, rose above the flippancy
was all the more remarkable.
As Lady Anne, Vivien Leigh was
less fortunate. Admittedly the
scene is so brief that it is difficult
for any actress to give a con-
vincing impression of being fas-
cinated by the monstrous
Richard over her father’s coffin,
but Olivier says —
What, though I kill’d her husband
and her father?
Jhe readiest way to make the wench
amends
Is to become her husband and her
father:
The which will I; not all so much
for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her which I must reach
unto —
with such jolly ridicule that it is
impossible to believe any of it.
Another approach which
Olivier makes to Shakspeare,
lightly enough in his own case,
but which rests heavily on the
rest of the cast, is the speed
at which he sets the perform-
ance. He can deliver his lines
at an almost incredible speed,
yet drop each word clearly into
the audience without losing its
sound or meaning. Most of
the other players, however, are
not equal to him and lose some
of the poetry and some of the
sense. It seems rather like
going to the opposite extreme to
avoid sonorous declamation of
blank verse.
It is impossible, of course, not
to admire Olivier’s acting even
while criticising his Richard.
Both hisi Sir Peter and his
Richard are such tremendous
studies in remarkably blended
detail, right down to significant
though barely perceptible ges-
tures and inflexions of voice, that
it is almost impossible to pull
them apart for analysis. And it
can also be recorded that, de-
spite his reputation, despite all
the ballyhoo that has attended
his visit, and despite the fact that
he is the company’s main attrac-
tion, there is never at any time
any apparent connection what-
ever between Olivier, Sir Peter
Teazle and Richard 111.
Ginette Neveu and
Bernard Heinze.
Brahms’s great Concerto in
D Major, Opus 77, which so in-
delibly bears the imprint of the
Joachim influence on the com-
poser, was the work chosen by
the young French violinist when
she appeared with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under
Bernard Heinze last week. Tall,
dark and lithe. Mile. Neveu
bends with a panther-like in-
tensity over her fiddle as she
awaits her entry-cue. There was
something almost barbaric in
the way she virtually slashed at
the strings in the opening
Allegro, though the tone evoked
was the essence of refinement.
The mood changed in the
Adagio —here the soloist caressed
the strings in tenderness which
never developed into mere weak-
ness —a rich tone was main-
tained, the great beauty and
breadth of volume extracted
from the lower reaches of the
G string being a revelation in
playing by a woman. In
the final movement, Allegro
giocoso, in which the solo in-
strument asserts itself with
almost arrogant vigor against
the orchestra, the soloist weaved
her way through the most com-
plicated patterns with superb
judgment and a mathematical
tonal exactness throughout
phases where the speed was shat-
tering.
Schubert’s Symphony No. 7
in C Major (“The Great”), the
quintessence of the composer’s
genius for pure melody and pos-
sibly the greatest in all sym-
phonic literature, was given a
splendid reading. No happier
combination of the string and
woodwind sections' .of the
orchestra has been heard for
some time than that in the fas-
cinating rhythm of the Scherzo.
Sydney Art Shows.
Margaret Olley’s heavy,
almost sculptured human figures
(as in the large “Ophelia”),
buildings which are painted
somewhat after the style of
Drysdale, a few drawings and
lowering landscapes which have
a power indubitably the artist’s
own, are on exhibition at the
Macquarie Galleries, B 1 ig h -
street, until Monday, July 12.
The Australian Art Society’s
Exhibition at the Education De-
partment Galleries and Roy Dal-
garno’s Industrial Drawings, on
view at the Studio of Realist
Art Gallery, 214 George-street,
will be discussed more fully next
week.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
When members of the Canadian com-
munity and their friends ushered in
Dominion Day at the Malvern Town
Hall with toasts and songs a large snow-
man, set in front of the stage, watched
over the proceedings. This was the pout
for decorations, which also included
small snowmen and snow-laden fir-trees
set on the supper-tables. These, very
cleverly contrived from cotton-wool, had
been made by members of the Canadian
Women’s Group. Canada’s Trade Com-
missioner F. W. Fraser was present. With
T H. G. Fletcher, Asst.-Trade Commis-
sioner, was Mrs. Fletcher, whose smart
black-crepe gown featured the new slit
harem skirt and cap sleeves of black
velvet. Mrs. Fletcher was one of the
ticket secretaries ; the other was Mrs.
J, K. Lennon, wife of the President or
the Canada Club. President of the
Canadian Women’s Group, Mrs. Arthur
Wilkes, wore a black-velvet gown with
a fitting bodice which had a deep, square
neckline finished with white pleated frill-
ing; the frilling also edged the short
sleeves. Mrs. Robin Hood s attractive
taffeta gown was printed in soft-pink
and pastel-blue. Mrs. Don Osborne chose
a tasty confection of deep-royal-blue
georgette.
Tweeds, a popular choice for a cold
day at Flemington, followed the old
classic lines, the jackets perhaps a little
longer, the skirts cut to mid-calf length.
Grey was a winner. Many young girls
chose casual clothes, and coats were
mostly of the swing-back type. Pam
Dixon, just returned from America, chose
a natural camel-hair coat swinging from
a wide shoulder yoke. Under the Peter
Pan collar she tucked a yellow scarf which
ended in a bow just under the chin; her
helmet-shape cap was studded with square
gold studs, Mrs. J. V. Fairbairn s
cinnamon-brown corduroy - velvet coat
and matching felt hat were worn with
high zipped boots of brown suede. Grey
and pastel-pink flowers highlighted the
small hat worn by Lady Currie with her
grey suit. Mrs. Keith Morrison’s black
cloth coat was braided at the pockets, and
her small black felt hat had a ribbon
bow at one side. Mrs. D. J. S. Mackinnon
had yellow birds at the back of the up-
turned brim of her yellow felt hat, which
was worn with a natural kasha suit and
mink coat.
Mrs. Neville Palmer wore a trim brown
suit which featured a pleated skirt; her
hat was a brown felt tricorne. Mrs. A. V.
Pope chose a tailored coat and matching
suit of dark clerical grey, the black velvet
collar matched by the pom-poms of black
feathers set at the side of her small grey
felt hat. Peggy Walsh wore a winter-
white wool coat over her brown frock;
her small hat was trimmed with winter-
white and yellow feathers. Mrs, George
Griffiths was wrapped in a grey squirrel
coat; her red gloves matched her tiny
velvet turban. Mrs. Bon Guest s dyed-
ermine coat was worn with a pink gros-
grain hat. A snuff-brown jacket suit
trimmed with gold buttons and small
feather-mounted hat were Mrs. Lionel
Newton’s choice. Mrs. Eric Fowlers
dyed-ermine coat was worn over an aqua-
blue wool frock. Mrs. „A. Silk wore a
cutaway coat of grey Persian-lamb and
a small yellow hat trimmed with a black
feather. Daughter Joan buttoned herselt
into a close-fitting black velvet jacket,
which was worn with a very full tartan
skirt; her small red hat was trimmed
with an upstanding feather quill. Mrs.
Len Buxton’s black Persian-lamb coat
suited nicely a hat trimmed with black
velvet ribbon. Iraida Voigts swing-
back coat of natural camel-hair was worn
with a hat trimmed with green-and-white-
checked taffeta ribbon and white feathers.
Dome O’Neill’s ensemble of London tan
was topped by a matching swathed beret.
When Patricia, only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. F. C. Green, of Malvern, was
married at St. Peter’s, Toorak, to Derk,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. J. A. V. Rum-
bold, of South Yarra, she wore a lovely
gown of deep-cream panne Velvet. A
full skirt, slightly trained, was allied to
a tight-fitting bodice which had a deep,
square neckline and long, tight-fitting
sleeves. A narrow gold cord circled her
waist and an unusual pearl headdress was
attached to the long filmy tulle veil. The
bride, who carried a bouquet of gar-
denias and tuberoses, was attended by
Mrs. Lex Davidson, matron-of-honor,
and Winsome Dane, bridesmaid, who
were gowned alike in heavy white matt
cr6pe, the skirts full and of floor-length
and the bodices bead-embroidered to
match their tiny caps. The short gloves
repeated the bead motif; their bouquets
were of white bouvardia. Bill Sturrock
was best man and Kevin Carver grooms-
man. Ushers at the church were Lex
Davidson and Peter Lynch.
At the reception at Queen’s-road
Private Club Mrs. Green received the
guests wearing an attractive gown of
duck-egg blue cr£pe, the long tunic top
allied to a slightly-draped skirt. Mrs.
Rumbold chose a black velvet gown and
short dyed-ermine cape. Mrs. J. L.
Moore’s black, gold-embroidered gown
was worn under a long tomato-toned
tailored coat. A black off-the-shoulder
tulle gown and a white embroidered
Chinese coat made bright combination
for Diana Oliphant. Joan Lean
chose a dove-grey taffeta ballerina
frock. Mrs. Norman Lynch’s pink crepe
gown featured a lace top, heavily em-
broidered in crystal beads.
This charming picture of Lady Con-
nelly was taken on her wedding day.
Formerly Patricia Holschier, a nursing
sister at Mt. St. Evins, she married Sir
Raymond Connelly, Melbourne’s Lord
Mayor, but had no time to officiate
before leaving with Sir Raymond in the
Stratheden for London. They will be
returning in December. Photo, from
Allan Studios.
A gay pre-nuptial party was given for
Lois Spiller and Bruce Wilkes, who will
marry at Christ Church, South Yarra,
on Friday, by Sonia O’Brien and Joan
Smallhorn at the latter’s East Malvern
home. Sonia’s upswept coiffure was
effective with her smart black frock.
Joan, who will be bridesmaid, pinned
gardenias in the tight-fitting bodice of
her “new-look” frock. Patty Ring, who
will be matron-of-honor, wore a pinky-
beige frock, the skirt knife-pleated, the
bodice swathed into the waist. The front
of the black bodice of Nan Parrish’s
frock was of narrow black-and-white-
striped wool, a large bustle-bow of the
same material highlighting the black skirt.
Tuppy Whitehead chose a deep-brown
lace frock. Lucy Gough, who leaves for
England in a few weeks, lent distinction
to her black frock with a frothy little
chapeau composed mostly of lime-toned
roses. Delia Gurney’s red-velvet turban,
trimmed with a large cluster of pink
feathers, was worn with a black jacket-
suit. Among the prospective ’groom’s
friends were Alan Benjamin, who will
be best man, Bill Kerr, and John and
Brian Butler.
From Sydney
Drury Lane on the opening night of
26-year-old Mr. Richard Brinsley Sheri-
dan’s “School for Scandal” could not
have seethed with more excitement than
did the Tivoli last Tuesday for the Sydney
premiere of the immortal comedy. It
was the Old Vic. Company’s introduction
to Sydney audiences. And from the entry
of the two brocaded and powdered foot-
men with their long tapers to light the
footlights the whole presentation was in
period. From that and from the first
Cecil Beaton interior the keyed-up spec-
tators knew they could leave it to
Laurence Olivier. They settled back to
enjoy themselves, and for nearly three
hours lived l and laughed with London
of 200 years ago.
The clothes worn by Vivien Leigh, as
Lady Teazle, would make a millionaire
look a bit frowningly at his cheque-book.
From her morning frock of ivory silk,
short-waisted, flowing, its low neckline
cut square, its front panel embroidered
with glittering stones, her raiment hypno-
tised the female gaze. But her grace and
good looks were shown to greatest ad-
vantage in the lustrous black-velvet frock,
the black hat showing the influence of
the then fashionable portrait-painter
Gainsborough. Well, any almost-erring
wife couldn’t do better, if she is fated to
be discovered in his rival’s rooms by a
doting husband, than be discovered in
such fashionable elegance. It would
plead her cause better than any K.C.
The crowds outside the theatre and just
inside the entrance were terrific. To
arrive at the stalls or the circle stairs
was snail’s progress. Finally the police
made passage-way for ticket-holders
or the curtain mightn’t have gone
up yet. Everybody dressed up for
this first night. There were even a
few opera hats among the men. John
Bovill made entry in a fur-collared black
top-coat. Mrs. Bovill’s frock was of
palely-pink satin. This was a night when
you wore diamonds if you had them. No
handsomer ear-rings winked back the
light than those worn by Mrs. Charles
Lloyd Jones. Her frock of emerald-
green jersey had the new plunging
neckline, and her jacket was of platina
fox. Knight Ben Fuller, Dr. Ben
Jones and his wife, knight Samuel
Cohen and party, the Jimmy Bancks
couple, the Maurice Gulsons were among
the noted; so were the L. A. Robbs.
Cherry-red was the soft woollen coat
worn by Mrs. H. J. Brady. Gay
Bernays was one of a bright party. But
indeed there was as much radiance in the
audience as: on the stage. Though no
man, of course, could live up to the bro-
caded waistcoat of dice-throwing Mr.
Charles Surface, with its design of play-
ing-cards, the spades very black, the
hearts very red. •
The press interview with the Oliviers
was great fun. You went up to the third
floor of Usher’s, you tapped on the in-
dicated door. A head popped out, and
you were asked your name and the paper
you came from. These were then flashed
back to Intelligence H.Q. inside. Then
the magic portals opened. It was as
good as being part of a conspiracy. The
two principals were very friendly. They
sat side-by-side on a small sofa entirely
surrounded by pressmen and -women,
and they, as the phrase goes, “gave of
their best.” Lady Olivier makes you
think of a lovely pearl. She set
this quality in a frock of fine black wool
jersey, and a black hat, crownless but
fairly wide as to brim, which she wore
off the forehead. Her* cape was of blue-
grey Arctic fox. She wore three strings
of pearls and a jewelled brooch like a
posy of flowers with a tiny gilt hand set
in it. But this Letter hopes that her
natural kindness of heart will prevent
her taking away to cold climes any of
our small tropic bushland creatures as she
is reported to be thinking of doing.
He talked national theatre, but not a
building. Keep the theatres you have,
he admonished. We have lost the art of
building them. He spoke of the theatre
in Hobart, where the company recently
played for a week —the Royal-—built
over 100 years ago for a little more than
£2OOO. But, alas! It was a naughty
world then, and probably it was a case
of convict wages as against union wages.
When the Colony was 100 years old,
Sydney barrister John Gould, whose
hobby is the theatre, was commissioned
by the A.B.C. to go to Hobart and
arrange a broadcast of the first play pro-
duced in the Colony. It was a melo-
drama called “Speed the Plough.” It
was broadcast from the stage of the old
Royal, and made quite a hit.
Fine feathers swept across the front
or the side view of many a hat at the
Town Hall reception to Sir Laurence and
Lady Olivier last Wednesday afternoon.
Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones’s greeny-black
(arsenic green) coq feathers swept the
brim of a tiny off-the-face hat, Mrs.
Tom Bateman’s plumage had once been
owned by some golden-winged bird.
Feathers, too, were in Mrs. Harold Bott’s
small-dimension headgear. Lady Olivier’s
hat was flower-decked and tied under the
chin with fine veiling. The hat was black ;
so was the frock beneath her glossy
dark fur coat, which wore an added bit
of expense in a catch of orchids.
The setting of this party was not the
conservative, Victorian background of
the Lady Mayoress’s rooms. Guests were
marshalled through a doorway into the
lower part of the concert hall screened
off from the echoing vastness of the
whole. Sydney’s Mayor and his wife, the
handsome Larry and the alluring Vivien,
the Clive Evatts with small daughter
Penelope between them took their stand
to the right and in line with the middle
door to the vestibule. Each guest did
the tour in the grand manner. Left to
right, shake hands, pass on down the
strip of red carpet flanked by pot-palms,
and on to the glo\v of the famed chan-
delier. If you were a tea-hound you
were disappointed. But there were all
sorts of strong waters, and fruit-cup as
well. There were about 300 at the party,
and hundreds more on the pavements
ouside waiting for a free glimpse of the
hero and heroine they have so often paid
to view on the screen.
There was an air of great cheerfulness
over the assemblage. The Harald Bow-
dens, the Benjamin Fullers with daughter
Mrs. Rainbow were there. From Killara,
too, came Mrs. Hope Gibson. A real
picture-hat, its brim outlined in organza
roses, was Mrs. Neil Maver’s choice. The
Rupert Scammells, the Corn’s opera
school’s Hilda Mulligan, busy on a pro-
duction of “Louise,” D. D. O’Connor,
singers, writers, painters were all gathered
together. Irene Bartley, young daughter
of the Lord Mayor, smiled under a
wide-brimmed hat of turquoise-blue.
Tripp and Careless of the “School”
appeared as Mr. Hethcote and Mr.
Morgan, Lady Sneerwell, the Surface
brothers, Mrs. Candour and Maria, Sir
Oliver were there, too, as plain (not too
plain) men and women.
In Richard 111 Vivien Leigh flitted
about as Queen Anne, as ethereal as a
moonbeam, first in flowing lucent white,
then in the most glorious sapphire-blue
velvet deep-banded in ermine. The Gov-
ernor, Lieut.-General Northcott, and
daughter Elizabeth came with a party
from Government House. In the audience
blue was a favorite color. It ranged from
jacaranda crepes to the blue worn by
pretty Hazel Jackson. A group of Sydney
painters included Elaine Haxton, her hair
all flower-decked. Black velvets gleaming
with diamente were worn by Mrs. Bertie
Kelly, and mink and raisin brown velvets
were perfect allies in Mrs. C. L. Jones s
outfit. In the stalls sat Ethel Ranken with
Miss “Dot” Wentworth, granddaughter
of William Charles Wentworth, and who
as a youngster in London had seen the
great Irving as Richard. The knight
Benjamin Fullers brought a party ; so did
Mrs. G. C. A. Bernays. Much admired
was Mrs. John Storey’s Chinese coat of
stiff ice-blue silk patterned in reds.
Countess Arrighi wore green-and-white-
striped taffetas.
Slim and tall Gay Bernays is here
pictured by Falk. Gay and Bob Brad-
shaw, of Dover Heights, have just an-
nounced their engagement, and life is
just one round of parties for the popular
pair. Gay’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. G.
C. A. Bernays, of Vaucluse, held a late-
afternoon reception at Usher’s last Thurs-
day, and this gave a vast army of friends
and ‘ relations an opportunity to offer
congratulations. Gay was all slim dis-
tinction in dark-brown silk, the skirt of
which swirled into fullness. Her small,
off-the-facq hat with its looped ribbons
of bronze and green was worthy of a
Cecil Beaton setting.
Noble is the word to describe the hos-
pitality and geniality of this party. Mrs.
Bernays, the hostess, wore an ensemble
of fine black wool jersey, and her hat was
smartness in black coq feathers. Mrs.
Bradshaw (Bob’s mother) wore dark furs
with her teal-green suit. Mrs. Bemays’s
sisters Mrs. Hardy, of Brisbane, Mrs.
Iceton and Mrs. R. Binney were there ;
so were knight Norman Paul and his
lady. Mrs. Bouverie Anderson Smart,
Mrs. R. C. Moulton and Mrs. Jack
Cassidy were among the many.
Compared with the majesty and gloom
of Richard 111, the new show at the
Royal is as gay and unsubstantial as a
carnival streamer. “John Loves Mary”
opened on Saturday night to a packed
house, and most of the audience had
already become habitues of the Old Vic.
Company.
This play should be seen by all ex-
soldiers of the lower ranks. “No doubt
the men of this war, Sir, felt exactly the
same to their officers as the men of your
war did to their officers,” remarked one
ex-G.I. to the heroine’s father, who had
been a colonel in World War I and
prided himself that the men were devoted
to their officers —and many of the wise-
cracks ran on the same lines. Heroine
June Clyde looked all a returning soldier’s
sweetheart should in her pale blues,
covered in one instance with a pleated
late-afternoon coat slit up at the back
to show her blue frock underneath.
The little Variety Theatre in Pitt-street,
all bright with fresh paint, is offering
film-lovers a change of diet. From now
on the bill of fare will be a Continental
dish. In French and Italian works such
stars as Pierre Brasseur, Jean-Louis Bar-
rault, the beauteous Arletty will appear.
These are all in “Les Enfants du
Paradis,” which opened its season last
Thursday night with a press and theatre
preview.

THE SERV ICE MAN
EAST v. WEST IN EUROPE.
“Ek Dum”: All armchair ex-
perts have explanations of what
is happening in Europe, but only
time will tell whether they have
the right explanations. Some of
the most positive and learned of
them do not even understand
the elementary terms and
definitions o f Communism,
much less the elementary
trends of events in Eastern
Europe. What news is coming
out of Poland is exactly what
the Russians want to come out.
What the Cominform says is
couched in terms which suits the
Cominform.
The trend of matters suggests
a certain pattern of timing and
action which may be aimed to
any one of several ends.
In Berlin there is no doubt
that the Russians have deter-
mined to take the city and kick
out their “allies.” It was timed
to happen on the verge of the
Western Allies allowing their
sector of Germany between
France and the Elbe to frame a
constitution which will make it
virtually an independent
country.
This is a move which the Rus-
sians will resist for marry reasons.
Firstly, unless they have a Com-
munist western Germany, east-
ern Germany will be a liability
rather than an asset. It would
have to look outside its borders
for coal and metal resources,
and that in countries which are
in reality Russian provinces.
It is furthermore a ravaged
country, which the Russians
have stripped of everything mov-
able, including skilled workmen.
It cannot live without a closely-
knit relationship with the six
western German States. The
communications of Central
Europe cannot function effi-
ciently without the co-operation
of the west. And since the same
is true, vice versa, of the west,
in that point at any rate, and the
west would have to be fed from
outside Europe if it were not
linked to the east, the chances of
some sort of fusion would be
strong once the Russians could
put pressure on, with the great
Western Powers out of the way.
At the moment what the Rus-
sians are doing is to give, or try
to give, western Germany a taste
of what is coming to it if it does
not knuckle down.
Berlin is a vital weapon in the
game. It is not merely a national
capital. It is also a key com-
munication centre, a bottleneck
through which vast amounts of
traffic can be filtered. Who-
ever holds it possesses a tre-
mendous advantage in dealing
with western Germany and in
military strategy.
Apart from other incentives,
the Russians look to a finger in
the pie in western Germany be-
cause they desire a hand in the
management of the Ruhr and
the Saar. Four-Power control
of those areas has been de-
manded already—though only
the Ruhr question is pressed.
Should they achieve this it
would mean that they would
have pushed themselves to the
borders of France and secured
a very strong economic weapon
with which to smash opposition
to Communism in France and
Belgium.
Given a finger in a Four-
Power control, they would, of
course, take exactly the same
steps that they have taken in
every other quarter in which
they have been allowed to co-
operate with their “allies”-—ob-
struct everything, veto whenever
possible, produce chaos, carry
on intensive Communist and
anti-Allied propaganda and
finally attempt to seize the whole
area, as they are doing in
Berlin,
Position Untenable
While there is not a great deal
involved in the actual local area
of Berlin, the position from a
political point of view is unten-
able on the Allied side. The
Russian representative. Colonel
Kalinin, curtly announced last
week that the Four-Power con-
trol had been dissolved. The
central railway control already
had been moved into the Rus-
sian zone. Later in the week it
was said that the Russians had
informed the Lady Mayoress of
Berlin that she must in future
take orders from the Russians
and from nobody else. All
ground and water communica-
tion between the capital and the
west has been cut off. Food
supplies for western Germany
are being held back from the
east and coal and metal supplies
from the west. The British,
French and U.S. zones have
even been denied normal milk
supplies.
The British, American and
French control staffs in Berlin
are an island, responsible for
governing 2,000,000 Germans, in
a sea of Russians of which the
western shore is 120 miles away.
Air communication has made
it possible to lay down supplies
for them, and this is being done
hurriedly, apparently with the
idea in view that air communica-
tion may also be cut off pre-
sently. Already one route has
been hung by the Russians with
barrage balloons above 4000 ft.,
and the Western Allies have
been notified that the routes are
under patrol by Yak fighters.
Allied Statements
The United States Military
Governor of Germany, General
Clay, has declared that the
position is “very serious.” But
this was only an echo of Mr.
Bevin’s warning that “a grave
situation may arise”:
If such a situation arises the Gov-
ernment will have to ask the House
to face it... .The British Government
and our Western Allies have no
alternative between that decision and
surrender —and none of us can accept
surrender.
General Marshall, in Wash-
ington, remarked that the United
States intended to stay in Berlin.
And this statement was followed
by the announcement that the
Allies would send a joint Note
to Moscow in the sternest terms
accusing the Russians of having
violated their war-time agree-
ments and all the elementary
rules of humanity.
But the Western Allies are
facing reality and have ordered
Germans in their zone to take
three-quarters of their pay in
Russian marks.
Contemporaneously with what
is happening in Germany, other
things are happening in the rest
of Europe. One is a strong revul-
sion of feeling everywhere against
Communism. This is especially
apparent in Finland, which
Russia only recently forced into
signing some sort of agreement
which did not go as far as the
Kremlin wished. It appears that
at the Finnish elections the
Communists have suffered a
serious defeat —a consummation
which may be contemplated
with grave anxiety, since it is
unlikely that Stalin will be in-
clined to take it sitting down.
It would not be beyond the
bounds of possibility that the
Soviet Union might take the
stand that the result of the elec-
tion is due to the machinations
of the Western Powers, and that
the safety of the Soviet Union
calls for the occupation of Fin-
land. In that matter the Rus-
sians, having watched the worm-
like behavior of the Attlee Gov-
ernment, which in the course of
three years has succeeded in giv-
ing away most of the British
Empire in its power to give
away, might easily misjudge the
temper of the British people and
of the Americans.
Events in Yugoslavia
The second thing which is
happening is the curious series of
events which have taken place
in Yugoslavia. These, in brief,
amount to a declaration by the
Cominform that the Communist
party of Yugoslavia has strayed
from the ideological tenets of
international Communism and
has assumed a nationalistic
guise.
As the basis of international
Communism is a world revolu-
tion conducted with Moscow as
H.Q. and Stalin as “general-
issimo”—his Russian title is
symbolical of his world leader-
ship of the revolutionary armies,
as has been explained more than
once by Russian propagandists
—this amounts to “Trotskyism.”
The Cominform has withdrawn
in high dudgeon to Bucharest.
And Tito has been parading in
his city of Belgrade, acclaimed
by trusting Yugoslavs and re-
elected to the headship of the
Yugoslav army with bands, ac-
clamations and a display of por-
traits in the best Moscow man-
ner.
The daily press appears pre-
pared to forget that he is an
abominable ruffian the mur-
derer of British emissaries and
of Mihailovich, the slaughterer
of priests, the suppressor of the
Christian .church, one who has
murdered friendly British and
U.S. emissaries. Once more he
has become a hero —the man
who is standing up to Stalin and
defying the lightning.
This attitude appears to have
countenance from the United
States Government, which has
released Yugoslav assets to the
tune of about £18,000,000 ster-
ling to the bloodthirsty scoun-
drel and taken credit semi-
officially for the fact that what
has happened in Belgrade is the
outcome of a propaganda car-
ried on on Russian lines by U.S.
agencies. If this is so it does
not reflect much credit on the
American agencies.
The lesson of relations with
the Soviet Union should cure the
Western democracies of any
desire for further close and
trusting associations with the
barbarous tyrants of Eastern
Europe.
A Russian Agent
In judging the Yugoslav posi-
tion it is first necessary to ap-
preciate that Tito is a Russian
agent. He was a Russian agent
in Spain. He was a Russian
agent and a Red Army officer
when he was parachuted into
Yugoslavia to become a “Pat-
riot.” His radio station, during
the heady period when the
Communist party of the world
formed-fours with clockwork
percision to every line of pre-
varication about him which was
originated in Moscow, was at
Tiffis in the Caucasus. What-
ever he has done he has done
under Moscow orders and with
Moscow money so far as his
personal affairs were concerned.
The very bone of contention
between the Cominform and his
Yugoslav Communist party was
based on a policy approved and
praised throughout by the Krem-
lin. Yugoslavia is a peasant
country, and the first step in its
capture for Communism was the
approval of peasant ownership.
It is a primary concept of Com-
munist tactic in the capture of a
country that the peasant and the
small proprietor must be first
won over and, when lulled into
security, dealt with. Lenin laid
this down clearly again and
again.
In Yugoslavia this has been
done thoroughly, and the phase
has now arrived in which the
changeover to a workers’ Gov-
ernment, as opposed to an in-
terim peasant-supported Gov-
ernment permitting private own-
ership, has been reached.
There are some peculiar fea-
tures about the course which
has been taken. The Comin-
form’s manifesto emphasises
strongly the “wrong attitudes” of
the Yugoslav Communist party,
and says little about the wrong
attitudes of Marshal Tito, who
was away at the time of the
crisis in his castle at Bled —all
true democratic leaders in East-
era Europe sport at least one
castle among their perquisites.
He returned at the psycho-
logical moment for election to
the command of the army and as
chief delegate to the local Com-
munist convention which is to
take place in a few weeks’ time.
Moscow and the Cominform
knew well what was impending.
Meanwhile Yugoslavia is sup-
posedly a plague spot from Mos-
cow’s point of view, a mire of
imperialist capitalism in the
centre of a crusading Com-
munist world. Moscow Radio
is saying little about it. And in-
dependent news services from
Moscow have ceased to exist —
one of the extraordinary fea-
tures of the past weeks of crisis
is that there has been no
British-American news whatever
from Moscow. The abuse and
reprisals so far have been left
to Hungary and Albania, two
Russianised islands, one on each
side of Tito’s erring country.
A Normal Technique
Nobody with any knowledge
of Communist technique ,will
treat events in Belgrade as a
likely major blow to Commun-
ism in Eastern Europe, or as a
victory for peace and democ-
racy.
At best the parallel would be
a falling-out between two gun-
men of the Sydney underworld,
which could scarcely be ac-
counted a triumph for the
police and law and order.
If one of the two gunmen of
Eastern Europe* succeeds in tak-
ing the other for a ride, as the
late Mr. Allard was recently
taken in Sydney, it still won’t
help law and order much.
And if the other one avoids
being taken for a ride, which is
unlikely if Comrade Stalin is
bent upon taking him for one,
and if he succeeds in forming
his own gang and operating
solus, it is scarcely ethical for
law-abiding citizens, represented
by the Western Powers, to help
him. Because he has broken
away from the old firm he is not
necessarily a reformed charac-
ter and still is personally re-
sponsible for his past horrible
crimes.
Just a Change of Line
There is a strong chance,
however, in the light of what has
happened in the past both in
Yugoslavia and in Communist
parties everywhere, that all that
is going on in Yugoslavia is a
change of Russian line to com-
plete the conquest of that
country.
It happened twice in Australia
in the early ’thirties —first with
the Communist party itself and
then with the Red International
and Minority Movements. Mr.
J. S. Garden, for instance, was
treated much as Tito is being
treated. He went out of the
Communist party, ostensibly,
proclaiming loudly that he was
still a Communist. And after-
wards he was discovered operat-
ing the Pan-Pacific Secretariat,
which had headquarters in
Vladivostok and organising
headquarters in the Sydney
Trades Hall.
He certainly had Moscow con-
nections only a few years ago.
In Yugoslavia, Russia has
more than once changed its line
towards leadership and policy.
And if it changes it again it will
be only an incidental matter
whether Tito is allowed to con-
tinue to operate or whether
Moscow decides that it will be
more spectacular and convinc-
ing to a gullible world if he and
some of his followers are
bumped off or out.
Mihailovich’s Fate
In 1942 the Communist party
in Australia issued a pamphlet
which would have had its
authors shot in any Com-
munist-led country for its sneer-
ing denunciations of the
leadership of their own nation
and their alleged cowardice.
A preface was written to it
by a Mr. Rupert Lockwood,
who is now abroad on a
mission for the Australian Com-
munist party, of which he is one
of the inner ring of leaders. On
page 15 of this noisome emana-
tion of Communism, which is
called “A Year of the People’s
War,” appears the following:
Not merely the British but all
democratic peoples of the world
showed Moscow that they regarded
her light as theirs. Huge rallies were
held Argentine workers gave up
a week’s pay to send comforts to the
Bed Army. The N.S.W. Trades and
Labor Council passed a resolution
calling for a second front. South
Coast wharfies loaded a Soviet ship
free of cost, instituting a socialist
competition to get the job through
quickly... .The Internationale echoed
round the world, bishops vying with
Lord Mayors in giving it volume as
they stood with Communists on a
thousand Russian-aid platforms.
Over town halls and department
stores the Red Flag broke out. The
antagonism of a country’s industrial
strife was broken down as the sub-
merged peoples of Europe heaved at
their chains. Over his secret radio
Maurice Thorez, French Communist
leader, proclaimed his solidarity with
De Gaulle. Norwegian resistance
grew Moscow’s Radio appeals to
the Slavs were heard in Servia and
Montenegro and Serbia [s/c], where
the patriot Mihailovich performed
the most incredible feat of seizing
and holding about one-fourth of the
country, his forces growing despite
the most ferocious reprisals....
And about a fortnight after
this was issued Tito was dropped
into Yugoslavia, Moscow com-
pletely changed its line. The
Australian Communist party and
its Lockwoods turned over
obediently, and to them Tito be-
came a hero who was perform-
ing the incredible feat, with the
help of two men and a dog, of
keeping more German divisions
at bay than all the Allied Armies
in Italy.
“The patriot Mihailovich”
was suddenly relegated to the
role of a “revolting figure
a butcher.. . .openly and
nakedly betraying the devoted
Yugoslavs to the butchers of
Berlin,”
Tito, as a Red Army officer,
is either playing the Red Army’s
game or he has been cast off.
In the latter case there will be
another Tito waiting to play the
Kremlin’s game.
The world does not want
another war, and the most ex-
treme measures are called for
to prevent one. The initiative
in making one should be left en-
tirely to Moscow. Its encroach-
ments will have to be resisted
if they threaten Western Euro-
pean civilisation. But the Allies
should go to extremes to have
the peace kept or ally themselves
with elements against which
Russia and/or its neighbors
might have recourse to arms.
It certainly would not
strengthen the West’s moral
position or make for peace if
it were to rush to associate it-
self with Marshal Stalin’s cast-
off gangsters.

William Nicholson turned to scientific research
after a commercial career with the East India Company, and
made the historic discovery that water could be decomposed
by passing an electric current through it. This is an example
of electrolysis which is the foundation of many important
industrial and scientific operations. Working in company
with another English chemist, Carlisle, in 1800, Nicholson
constructed an electric battery (known at that time as a
“Voltaic Pile”), from thirty-six half-crowns, and a number
of zinc discs and pieces of pasteboard. Though the current
produced by this crude apparatus was so minute that only
a few thimblefuls of gas were collected over a period of
thirteen hours, Nicholson showed not only that water could
be electrolysed, but that the two gases of which it is composed
appear at different places, the oxygen being evolved where
the electric current enters the water and hydrogen where
it leaves.
Nicholson, who was born in London in 1753, made many
other scientific discoveries between his return from India in
1786 and his death in 1815. He invented a hydrometer, took
out patents for textile printing machinery, planned and carried
out a scheme for the water supply to Portsmouth. He was
a scientific writer of great contemporary eminence and
founded, and, until his death, edited the “Journal of Natural
Philosophy.” But the electrolysis of water,
a fundamental discovery of very great
importance, remains this Englishman's real
contribution to the world’s total of scientific
knowledge.

RED MILL RUM.
Saturday at Flemington was one of
the four annual feast-days celebrated
by worshippers of the jumping game,
and, despite the absence of train ser-
vice, the faithful flocked to the course.
Winning the Federal Hurdle at
Moonee Valley a week previously,
The Feline, half-stumbling over the
final hurdle, had looked a thoroughly
tired horse, but he gave the lie direct
to that opinion by winning Saturday’s
Grand National Hurdle as stylishly
as could be desired. Last year’s
winner, Eudunda, conceding The
Feline 141 b., was a game second, and
Latani third. B. Sellers rode the
winner, a six-year-old son of Solar
Bear.
Other hurdlers, evidently considered
not up to the National standard, con-
tested the mile-shorter Keilor Hurdle,
and here the recent convert from flat
racing Gallant Gentleman (L.
Meenan) was a narrowish winner
from Reynard and Ruthless. David
Star (G. Godfrey) gained admirers
for the National Steeple with an
effortless victory over Cheery Boy,
Marsmus and others in the Kensing-
ton Steeple. He carried 81b. more
than the 10.13 he has for the National.
The July Handicap of 13 furlongs
went to Sir Marfield (E. Watson), a
nasty shock for punters since the
Enfield gelding had few friends at
50 to 1; still, he deserved the win—
his first in the city—after scoring
minor placings galore. More accep-
table was the result of the Myross
Handicap for two-year-olds, won by
Spoor (F. Dummett) at 7 to 2.
Divisions of the mile Braybrook
Handicap went to Noble Prince (W.
Williamson) and Nilam (L. King).

When the Doomben Ten Thousand
was instituted a couple of years back
the race aroused wide interest, attrac-
ted the cream of horses then racing,
and promised to become one of the
real highlights of the Australian turf
calendar. Unfortunately it seems to
have deteriorated into a very ordinary
sprint for a disproportionately large
prize—something akin to a gold-plated
tin-lizzie.
On Saturday a better field contested
the seven-furlongs Moore Park Han-
dicap at Randwick (worth £7OO to the
winner) than ran" for the ten-times-
greater prize in Brisbane. Australia’s
best horse of the moment, Columnist,
won the Randwick race; he was not
taken to Brisbane because connec-
tions, more keen on the substance
than the shadow, preferred to tackle
the Sydney Turf Club’s forthcoming
winter double at Rosehill, where con-
ditions of both races provide a maxi-
mum top weight of 9,7 and a reason-
able penalty clause.
Once again Queensland - owned
horses took the lion’s share of the
£lO,OOO. Finishing with a slashing
burst, after striking no end of trouble
in the running, Murray Stream, ridden
by the leading Brisbane apprentice
N. Best, just pipped Radstock,
another Queenslander. Third money
went to Melbourne, represented by
Nestor, while the Sydneyite Heroic
Sovereign was fourth.
Murray Stream, whose retirement
has been announced more often than
that of any prima donna, is a six-
year-old chestnut horse by Midstream
from Hall Mark’s Sister, and an
exceptionally handsome individual. He
is now the leading stakes-winner at
present racing with over £28,000 to
his credit, despite which he has never
been a friend of the punter, making
a regular practice of winning big
races (including two Metropolitans)
at fancy odds. He started at 25 to 1
at Doomben.
* * * *
Columnist’s Randwick win was a
sterling effort since he lumped a
steadier of 10.2 to down Respond
and Proud Monash. Thompson rode
the champion, and declared that he
had never ridden another horse who
responded so quickly when called
upon for a burst.
Among other starters in that sprint
were Silver Link, Silent, Cronides,
Skip Bomber, Paktong and Home-
leigh Dick; plus Columnist, a much
better bunch of stayers than those
that contested the 12-furlongs Pacific
Handicap. This was impressively won
by Katanga’s three-year-old brother
Yamboon, just moving up frotp re-
stricted company; Herbert River and
Beau Felt were in the places. Winter
form is always open to suspicion,
but Yamboon may prove to be some-
thing out of the box.
While Columnist returned such an
excellent performance, his two-year-
old brother Journalist, after promis-
ing well in winning at his only pre-
vious start, was an utter flop in the
July Juvenile, which was won most
stylishly by the Hua gelding San
Domenico (V. Faggotter). The
Three-year-old Handicap saw the
Manitoba filly Belle Cherie (E.
Fordyce) give the stronger sex a
lesson; under a plaster of 9.13, odds-
on favorite Karachi did well- enough
to finish a close third behind Nickel.
High Order (R. Selkrig) took the
10-furlongs Trial, and Doughnut,
another for J. Thompson, the mile
Maroubra Handicap.

In pretty well every sector of the
sporting front in England over the
past few weeks, Australians have been
well to the fore, “Togo” Johnstone
setting the ball rolling with his grand
run of turf successes.
The finals at Wimbledon resolved
into a purely Australia-U.S.A. affair,
Bromwich reaching all three finals
and Sedgman the Men’s and Mixed
doubles. Bromyich had the galling
experience of losing the coveted
singles title after having led 5-2 and
40-15 in the deciding set; his van-
quisher was the young American Bob
Falkenburg. However, with Sedgman
(the youngster making his first appear •
ance at Wimbledon), Bromwich beat
Americans Mulloy and Brown in
the doubles, and, with Miss L.
Brough (U.S.A.), downed Sedgman
and Mrs. Du Pont (U.S.A.) in the
mixed. All this, of course, had no
effect on the A.L.T.A., which left
both fine players out of the Davis
Cup team.
In the British Athletic Champion-
ships in London on Saturday, niem-
bers of the Australian Olympic team
won five titles and filled places in
two other finals. Treloar won the
100yds. in 9.Bsec. on a bad track;
Moms Curotta took the 440yds.,
John Winter the high jump, W.
Bruce the broad jump, and George
Avery the hopscotch.
On the water Merv. Woods won
the historic Diamond Sculls, defeat-
ing Englishman Bert Bushnell. Woods
lacks the strength of his forerunner
Pearce, but is an infinitely better
oarsman. He learned his rowing at
Sydney Boys’ High, and rowed in
the police eight which represented
at Berlin in 1936.
The best the tired (and ill) Von
Nida could do in the British “Open”
was to tie for third with 290 for
the four rounds, six strokes behind
the winner, Henry Cotton, a wily
old gentleman of 40-odd who never
bites his caddie or swallows a bunker
and who has now won it thrice.
Cotton is a Public School product
who took to golf for a living, made
a small fortune out of it and gathered
in a South American heiress for a
wife.

The cricketers;
Much dodging of. rainstorms and
scamperings on and off the field
featured the final days of the second
Test at Lord’s, which Australia won
by a tidy 409 runs. Australia’s last
win on the famous paddock was
in 1930.
Although the tourists had a solid
lead of 478 with six wickets in hand
in their second knock, Bradman made
quite sure of things by allowing
Miller (74), Brown (32) and Lind-
wall (25) to build the total up to
460 before closing with seven wickets
down. On a tricky pitch, the oppo-
sition was routed for 186, the last
seven wickets adding but 80 runs.
Throughout Bradman used only four
bowlers, Lindwall taking eight for
131, Johnston four for 105, Toshack
five for 63 and lan Johnson three
for 75. The most disappointing
feature of the tourists’ progress so
far has been the wicket-keeping,
“sundries” being consistently one of
the opposition’s best scorers.
The usual monkeyish rush for
“souvenirs” at the close of the game
was a star turn. Lindwall caught
Wright and pocketed the pill; the
others indulged in a free-for-all from
“Looks like a dead stymie. Bill !”
which Hassett emerged sans souvenir
and plus a gash over the eye.
Surrey put more ginger into its
return match with the invaders but
still lost by 10 wickets —Australia 389
and 122 for none; Surrey 221 and
289. The team’s unbeaten record then
stood at 14 wins and three drawn
games. On Saturday the Australian
batsmen broke into a run-riot v.
Gloucestershire at Bristol; at stumps
they had 560 on the board for five
wickets. Arthur Morris got 102
before lunch, and after refreshing the
inner man, continued to smite the
trundlers hip-and-thigh, till finally
caught and bowled by Scott for 290
—his best personal score, and the
highest recorded in English first-class
cricket since pre-war days.

rugged Carlton by 14.10 to 10.23
on Saturday and thereby tossed an
unexpected bone among those con-
tending for “the four.” Fitzroy
played all over Richmond, 19.20-
14.11, Melbourne held Geelong by
9.17 to 8.9, Collingwood ran Foots-
cray into the ground for 19.9 to
10.11. It only remained for Essen-
don to beat St, Kilda, a bigger
certainty than anything. Essendon
decided to sleep off the first three
quarters and woke up to find them-
selves only 10 points in front, so
smothered a yawn, booted 7.10 to
1.4, and made it 17.22 to 11.6. A
minor disturbance at Glenferrie re-
solved itself into a South Melbourne-
Hawthorn match, “Sowth” getting the
verdict by 12.15 to 9.7.
Rugby Union: Randwick battered
through Western Suburbs’ solid de-
fences to win 19-3 at Coogee Oval,
backing up time after time to make
the match-winning difference. Other
games: Manly beat Eastwood 44-6,
St. George beat Gordon 16-6, East-
ern Suburbs .beat Northern Suburbs
34-14, and Drummoyn© downed
Parramatta 19-6.

Recently returned from a number
of winning contests in New Zealand,
Bobby Fuller (9.7) outboxed and
outfought Jackie Wilson (9.6) at
Leichhardt, but Wilson won the last
three rounds, and evidently this fast
finish gained him the decision on
points. Fitter than he has been for
some time, Wilson did most of the
attacking; Fuller, however, was too
fast, continually beating Wilson to
the punch, and he held an apparently
commanding lead at end of round
nine. Still, the verdict for Wilson
was well received.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Mat’s Mate”: A big, brown-faced
cove, all beard and burrs, blew into our
camp at Boggabri and nearly blasted us
out of it with a voice that could be heard
halfway along the Namoi as he urged
us to go with him to “Brewon, on the
Marthaguy.” There was no place like
Brewon, no river like the Marthaguy. At
Brewon there was plenty of tucker, no-
body would insult anybody by expecting
him to work, you could camp on the
Marthaguy anywhere, and the squatters
rode miles to hand out tucker, tobacco
and the price of drinks. There never
were such mates as’ you’d have on the
Marthaguy ; he could tell us of times he’d
had beside which any little festivities of
our own were as tame as a Sunday-
school picnic. All this came to us in
great blasts of sentences, frequently in-
terspersed by tornadoes of reminiscent
laughter that scared the kookaburras and
sent the crows fleeing into the distant
Pilliga scrub. We sat or stood about,
dazed by this endless roar of repetition,
gaining some respite in sleep, only to
awaken and endure again. He walked
with us about the streets of Boggabri
and the citizens began to avoid us. We
tried to sneak off in the dead of night;
he caught us within a mile, trumpeting
his astonishment. We invited him to
leave for the Marthaguy, but he refused
to go without us. Publicans sent beer
to the camp and storekeepers sent tucker
in order to keep him away from their
premises. Impervious to hint, threat or
persuasion he kept on shouting about
Brewon and the Marthaguy. For once
we were stumped, and we might have
been there yet, two quivering wrecks
with mangled eardrums, only that a
dingo or a sheep or a bunyip or some-
thing took his pants one night and we
had to go and look for them next morn-
ing. That’s why we never went to Bre-
won, on the Marthaguy,

“Lower Tops’l”: A close season for
crayfish during the breeding period in
Victorian and Tasmanian waters is likely
to follow an inter-State conference be-
tween fishermen’s organisations and Gov-
ernment authorities. Owing to the advent
of flying-boat fish-transport, and with the
huge exports to America, the cray popu-
lation, even on remoter southern coasts,
has so seriously diminished in recent
years that the C.S.I.R. fisheries authorities
are examining the position. Twenty-five
years ago, .when the greater part of Mel-
bourne’s crayfish needs were carried in
the wells of smart sailing-ketches, the
use of craypots off the Speck was pro-
hibited. Nevertheless the ketches,
allegedly working the Bass Strait islands
(where pots were legal), mostly filled
holds on Tassie coasts despite all the in-
genious methods of the authorities to
intercept them and confiscate the vessels.
The climax came in 1920 when a fisher-
man was shot dead by a constable while
lifting pots in his 22ft. boat in the Bay of
Fires. The constable was tried for
murder, sentenced and reprieved when the
Tassie police force threatened to strike.
But this episode didn’t stop the poaching,
so that a few years later the restrictions
were lifted. Since crays can be caught
and kept alive for months in coffs, and
fishermen .will be fishermen, it will be
interesting to know how the authorities
ape going to police the close season again.

“Eastern”: Daylight had just taken
over when down by the old river bridge
Sam prepared his gear and began fishing.
Hour after hour he stuck to it, mid-
morning bringing him up alertly as a
movement of his line brought hopes of
a nibble. It proved a false alarm, and
Sam subsided again to his patient watch-
ing. In the paddock opposite Bill
Edwards slashed tirelessly at an enormous
patch of fern and blackberry and threw
it into heaps. Slowly the sun crept to
dinner-time. Presently Bill dropped his
hook, transferred the sweat and grime
from his face to his shirtsleeve and
strode riverward. Twenty yards below
old Sam, he pulled up a set-line, removed
a fish, and walked on to where a peg
in the bank indicated another tethered
bait. Sam watched disgustedly. “Gripes,
that’s no way to fish,” he called. “Oughter
be stopped. It ain’t sporting.” “Works
all right,” came the. easy reply. “Yair,
but it’s plain murder,” growled Sam in-
dignantly. “Besides, y’ don’t have no
fun, no excitement or anything that way.
Why don’t you get a rod, an’ fish prop’ly,
an’ don’t he so damn’ lazy!”

“C.E.”: Was coming through Hum-
phries’s home paddock when I spotted
him inspecting his Red Polls. Must have
been 60 or 70 in the bunch, of the same
size, condition and color, and as I paused
“Gee, Mum, hasn't Daddy made-up nice ?”
to take them in Humph, came over.
“Nice even line now,” he remarked
proudly. “Some of ’em were showing a
bit hollow, so I drafted ’em into better
feed for a week or two. That was one.”
He indicated a beast a bit away. “Looks
all right, now. And that was another,
down by the fence there; and that one
by the tree. One here somewhere that
jumped out yesterday.” He looked all
round. “Yes, there he is, third one over
in that bunch.” X glanced at the cattle,
which looked as though they’d all been
stamped from the one piece of hide,
then turned to follow Humph, to the
house. “Missus is away,” he said, skin-
ning a rabbit he’d brought, “and I’ve got
to feed these silly-looking cats.” He
called in a high-pitched falsetto, and soon
two big blacks arrived,' one sporting a
length of hayband and a ticket. Another
call and a third black appeared, dangling
a strip of white shirt-tail round his neck.
“The decorations?” Humph, answered
me. “Oh, it saves me feeding the same
bloke twice. Hanged if I know how the
missus tells one from the other!”
* * * *
“X.Q.X.”: Camped near Kilcoy (Q.)
we were set to work digging the target
trench for a rifle-range. Our work was
watched with the greatest interest by a
colony of diamond-birds, and as soon as
we were down a couple of feet they
started prying round for nest-sites.
Brandished picks and flying dirt didn’t
worry them ; they fluttered unconcernedly
past our face as we worked. Before
long the whole 40yd. of trench was
pegged out; a few lucky ones had a
start in holes where old roots had been
pulled out, while the other birds started
work on the face in gravel that blunted
our picks. That such dainty sprites could
make an impression on it seemed ridi-
culous, but they did. Most of the in-
cipient tunnels were on the north wall,
probably because it was shady. Then
we got orders to move in two days (to
Milne Bay, as we learnt later). Next
day as we watched another working-party
filling in the result of our labors the
frustrated pardalotes seemed to be using
the equivalent of our language.
* * * *
“Muskeen”: I, too, like “Alec” (B.
16/6/’4B), have observed snakes par-
taking of draughts from the calyx of
the nearest sweet-smelling flower. It has
invariably happened in the mating season
and only after Joe, who in our district
is a strict vegetarian, has raided the
onion - patch. Strangely enough the
wrigglers who have gorged on this
nectar have, unlike some of the higher
animals who note such strange pheno-
mena, remained perfectly sober.
* * * ♦
“Hanko”; Of all ground-nesting birds
the nursery of the skylark is the hardest
to find. Even in short-grassed country
where the bird can be kept under obser-
vation it will trick a searcher times
without number. In feeding its nestlings
or in taking over a turn at egg-hatching
a skylark will land up to a hundred
yards distant from its nest, makes a series
of misleading forays in different direc-
tions, feed its nestlings while on the run,
or, if relieving a sitting bird, make the
changeover so snappy that it appears
to be the watched bird running on when
actually it is the one relieved. And a
nesting skylark can’t be sneaked upon ;
it leaves at the hint of approaching foot-
steps.
* * * *
“Ex-Bluenose”: There’s no mystery
why a whale doesn’t get the “bends”
despite any depth to which it descends or
how quickly it rises. The
human suit-diver has air
at an increased pressure
in ratio to depth pumped
down to him. This high-
pressure air is absorbed
into his bloodstream —
unnoticed while most of
his body is under the
same pressure. If raised
too quickly these pres-
sured air molecules, par-
ticularly the nitrogen, ex-
pand inside the veins with
painful and sometimes
fatal results. The whale
before diving takes in a
lungful of air at surface
pressure and retains this
during its plunge. Thus
there is no high-pressured
air in its veins; no sud-
den expansion of same on
surfacing; no “bends.”
Diving-suits can be made
of strong spirals of steel
wire woven so as to en-
case the body, with room
to spare. Further en-
cased in thick solid rub-
ber, with a strong metal
helmet, such a suit resists
pressure from every
direction, which enables
the diver to work at
great depths in nearly
normal air pressure. Re-
suit: Very little risk of “bends.” The
whale’s blubber acts in the same way.
Being literally living rubber, cylindrical
in form, it resists pressure just as does the
spiral spring-rubber suit. Thus the air
in the whale’s body remains at normal
pressure no matter to what depth it
descends. f

“Horseless Horseman”; Are there
more complacent birds ■ than the old
brolgas"? Outback, where trigger-happy
sportsmen are unknown and where year
in and year out “the companions” reside
in the same paddocks, I’ve ridden within
feet of the immense feathered creatures,
though they never fail to herald your
approach from a distance with their high,
resonant note. Once, too, from a rise in
the Gulf Country (N.Q.) I watched a
dingo sneaking on two birds that were
grazing on the plain belo.w. For an hour
or more all : the soldier-like, steel-blue
fliers did each time the warrigal
approached was to give a few leisurely
flaps of their great wings and drop down
again a few chains away. The wild dog
grew tired of this performance first.

“V. 1.8.”: The two young dairymen
were discussing the respective merits of
various green crops as an aid to increas-
ing the standard of their cream tests.
The old cocky sitting opposite them in
the carriage chipped in with the infor-
mation that he had always found the
growing of cabbages most satisfactory in
keeping up the high grade of his test.
Breaking the heavy silence that followed
he drawled laconically, “Of (Course, you
don’t feed them to the cows ; you give
them to the factory manager!”
“Laetitia”: Torres Strait natives are
less sensitive than “South Coast’s” Ton-
gans (B. 23/6/’4B) to reminders of the
cannibalism of their forebears. At vil-
lage feasts today the piece de resistance
is the “pappaye,” a weird concoction of
grated coconut, bananas, mangoes, fowl,
pig, yams, taro and manioca. The con-
fection is bundled in banana-leaVes and
roasted on the oven of white-hot stones.
A “pappaye” isi served to each guest, and
is likely to be too much in itself for most
European stomachs. , More disturbing,
however, is the roughly spherical and red-
hot object surmounting each bundle.
Though it is actually a coconut, it sug-
gests too closely, to even- the most un-
imaginative, the roasting human skull
which it would have been if the white
visitors had been attending, in a passive
capacity, the dinner provided by the
grandfathers of the dusky hosts of
today.

“Golden Mile”: Everything “Goldie”
(B. 9/6/’4B) says about the dust from
machine-drills underground is correct,
but among the old-timers there was
reckoned to be a certain protection, if
adopted. They claimed that the miner
who wore a thick moustache received a
certain degree of immunity. Have often
seen a machine-miner’s moustache nearly
solid with dust as fine as flour. Philoso-
phically washing it off at the end of a
shift, the wearer reckoned that it was
just so much that was prevented from
entering his nostrils or mouth. There was
a legend that twice as many clean-shaven
miners headed for the sanatorium as
whiskered ones.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: Three prospectors
working a creek-bed at Broad Arrow
(W.A.) are hampered in their operations
by the dictatorial attitude of a truant in-
spector who insists that they spend valu-
able time each day imbibing knowledge
in a schoolroom. They’re submitting to
officialdom’s decree, under protest, and
hinting darkly at reprisals when they
reach school-leaving age—which for eight-
year old Bob Hill means a long wait.
They haven’t bothered to take out
miners’ rights, although their ages
wouldn’t debar them from that, and they
don’t fear claim-jumpers, because “there’s
plenty of gold about.” It seems they’re
right. An old shaft in the locality has
just yielded surprisingly rich returns, and
the residents are talking of the town’s
early return to its former status of one
of the best mining centres in the West.

“Bosun’s Mate”: Subterranean up-
heavals are usually credited with huge
waves rearing suddenly from a calm sea.
In a corvette off Saigon we met another
cause. The waterspout appeared on the
port bow, travelling south, and the Old
Man, an ex-Yangtse Kiang pilot,
at once altered course to meet it. We
thought him mad, until a few minutes
later the whole great column collapsed
into the sea. Still he maintained course,
and suddenly a succession of ridges
scooped themselves from the sea and bore
down upon us. Head-on, the stout little
craft took them easily; broadside-on we
wouldn’t have been so comfortable.
Skipper explained that in a big spout, up
to 30ft. in diameter and 300 ff. high, there
would be several thousand tons of whirl-
ing water, sudden collapse of which dis-
placing the sea could slam an unwary
craft on her beam-ends.

“Galah”: Four of us waited on the
river - bank while Flipper manoeuvred
himself into position in a tree overlooking
a school of mullet. He had just dropped
the plug into the pool when the bough
broke. Flipper was met half-way down
by surge of upflung water, and he dis-
appeared into a flurry of mud and broken
snags. As we watched anxiously he
broke water, held up a dead mullet in
his only hand —he’d lost the other years
ago while similarly fishing—and roared
out, “Come on, you blokes; you’re
pretty slow off the mark!”

“Plop”: Tiny, a 16-stoner who used
to work for Alf Bennet, is remembered
locally for his ability to bend a Plumb
handle, end on, with his hands, and by
Alf as the sleepiest bloke that ever lived
outside a tortoise-shell. “It’s the same
with most big fellers,” explains Alf.
“Something to do with their circulation
having so far to travel. I stood for Tiny
until he took to sleeping-in until nearly
five o’clock, and then I got cunning. I
went all round the town and borrowed
every alarm-clock I could get hold of,
and took ’em up to the old shed he
slept in. In those days they made alarm-
clocks that went off like firebells, and I
planted twenty-three of ’em around the
rafters at the join of the roof, all set for
half-past four. Next morning I was
waiting outside a bit early to be in the
fun. I was deaf for two days after, but
do y6u think it woke the big bloke? I
found him after the roof had caved in,
still snoring his head off, with a bit of
loose galvanised-iron tucked under his
chin like a blanket!”
THE PINE PLANTATION.
Within this wood, so dim, so dark,
So other-world and strange,
Unlike the untamed miles that mark
The blue Australian range;
Outside, the rising sun outlines
In glory ridge and rise,
But through the windows of the pines
The light falls otherwise.
Sifted and sown in chequered trails
Across the forest floor —
Here one could read Grimm’s Fairy Tales,
A dreaming child once more.
Here through this green Germanic grove
Might pass, as in a play,
The fairy folk one used to love
A thousand years away.
Legend and myth and mystery,
Immortal joy and pain—
Half-in, half-out of history,
For ever they remain.
Dwarfs, gnomes and elves- in shadowy bands,
The tailor and his brothers,
Hansel and Gretel holding hands,
The cruellest of stepmothers...
Almost I see Snow White, Rose Red,
With their enchanted bear;
The Goose Girl with her shining head
Of plaited Saxon hair;
The witch and the bewitched Princess,
The King without a crown...
From storied boughs, for me, no less
The breeze has shaken down
The loosened leaves of memory
In feathery avalanches;
“Oh, almond tree, oh, almond tree.
How faithful are thy branches!”
Out of this greenness I must go,
Out of this alien hush
While still the tides of morning flow
Through the Australian bush.
VICTORIA.

“Gravelsnatcher”: “Benbow” is right
(B. 16/6/’4B). There is no such thing
as a topheavy ship, because “prior to
construction a vessel’s drawings are care-
fully calculated to ensure positive meta-
centric height.” Similarly there are no
corrupt politicians, because all men are
made in the image of God. Agreed?
Right. Now let’s get down to facts.
Every now and again, from world-famous
shipyards, comes a vessel conforming in
every detail to the engineers’ specifica-
tions but lacking something of the buoy-
ancy, speed and spirit of her sisters. The
difference is intangible; the fault, theo-
retically, non-existent; and the indefinable
“knowledge” of a thousand seamen, who
“feel” the defect the moment they set
foot on the ship, cannot avail against the
figures of one mathematician with his
tape and calculations. But in the Koom-
bana’s case the fault was obvious to every
seaman and port official on the nor’-west
run. She carried too much top-hamper.
Remember, too, that she was built with
a keel to sit squarely on the beach when
the tide was out. “Benbow” and his
army of theorists may prove conclusively
that she was well-founded and seaworthy
in any weather. Her captain, her crew,
and a host of Broome pearlers declared
that she was topheavy. And she sank.

“H.A.L.”; Ghittoe is a wonderful
timber (B. 16/6/’4B), but of the five
separate species only one is any good ;
the other four are brittle, curly-grained
and carroty. All species, however, burn
when green—-that’s why it has been
dubbed the “kerosene-tree.” When on
the Atherton Tableland (Q.) with the
Army I tried to get some of it to make
fishing-rods in our hobbies workshop,
but the owner of the mill which I visited
wouldn’t get me a log. I then
tried the direct approach to the
felling gang, but money meant nothing to
them. Finally a sacrificed beer-issue did
the trick —in the form of fishing-rods,
archery-bows, tool-handles and trinkets
that ghittoe log is now scattered all over
Australia. I’ve still a few nice pieces of
“Notice the new sound in the drill? I've just had it tuned-up."
it stowed away for future use. Ghittoe,
which has a grain as straight as deal, the
flexibility of whalebone and the strength
of hard-drawn steel tubing, is practically
unprocurable today.

“Hanko”: When the bloke asked for
an odd job to carry him on a bit the boss
wanted to know could he fall a tree ; a
big pine that overhung the dairy. The
bloke hesitated for quite a while. “Yair,
he said at length. “Where’s your axe?
He broke into a harsh laugh when shown
the Kelly. “Where’s your grindstone?’’
he asked. After a while: “Got a file an’
oilstone?” The trump was fuming by
now, but he bottled his ire. At last the
bloke walked up to the pine, and what
he did to that growth in a few hits was
wonderful to see. Hardly had the tree
crashed than he was upon it trimming
and barking, and soon the trunk was like
the mainstem of a schooner. “Y’ can cer-
tainly use an axe,” the boss told him.
“Look, mate,” the bloke said. “I’ve just
come out of the timber to dodge axes for
a while, but if I went to Antarctica I bet
a king penguin’d kid me to fall the South
Pole.”

“Bo”: Out with the mailman on his
run, we dropped a letter in to the shack of
Mick Fogarty, an ancient pensioner,
whose domains are almost hemmed in
by blackberries and bracken. Right
around the shanty a rope was stretched
in a circle. “So that’s what y’ wanted
that rope for that you got sent out from
the store, was it, Mick?” asked the mail-
man. “But does it keep the snakes from
getting in, as they reckon it does?” The
whiskered one shook his head. “Dunno,
he drawled. “Ain’t interested in that—-
I got it to keep Larry here, me pet, in
—he was alwiz wanderin’ off” And
he put his hand down behind the fruit-
case he was sitting on and held up a
4ft. red-bellied black.

“Chanticleer”: Nothing surprising
about domestic chooks finding their old
roosts after being mixed with* other
chooks (B. 30/6/’4B). A fowl knows its
roost —and its particular place on that
roost —as a wild bird its nest. The only
way to trick ’em is by removing them by
night and putting them on the new roosts,
to which they’!! return next day. If “The
Pirate” wants to see how stupid fowls
can be let him pull down the roost and
put others up near by. That night the
fowls will return to the site of the old
roost, stare unbelievingly at the vacant
site, gabble incredulously to one another
and then camp on the ground. They
either can’t or won’t go to the new roosts
of their own accord.

“The 0.D.”: Tell “Zake” (B. 30/6/’4B)
that standing the damper on its edge after
it comes from the coals does assist “in
its attaining a feathery lightness” in the
sense that one laid flat usually sinks in
the middle. There’s one other ritual;
Wiping the whole thing over lightly with
water; that’s to stop the crust turning
into concrete. Soda loaf or brownie
baked in a camp-oven receives the same
treatment from the experienced cook.

“Old-timer”: One of those Mallee
cyclones that leap out of nowhere
swooped down on Mac’s farm, scattered
his chooks, a haystack and part of the
kipsie roof. Mac and the family got in-
side and hung grimly on to various parts
of the house, listening to the howling out-
side. Then above the howling arose a
deep booming noise that grew rapidly
louder. Mac peered from the window up
the long cleared slope to the west.
“Gripes!” he roared. “It’s Fred Johnson’s
two-thousand gallon tank boltin’ straight
for us.” The family crowded round the
window and saw, through the flying dust
and ddbris, the great cylinder rolling and
bounding towards them. “Down on the
floor!” roared Mac, and hurled his
missus under the table. Flat on their
faces, the family heard the thing boom
nearer, there was a louder boom than
ever, the thing somehow missed the house
and went bounding and booming into the
wind-torn east. Shortly after that the
storm died down and they were out
assessing the damage when Johnson rode
up. “See anythin’ o’ a big tank?” he
asked. “Somethin’ did go past,” Mac
confessed ; “it went that way.” Johnson
turned his horse. Mac called after him
“Hey, you goin’ to’, carry it home on
your saddle?” Johnson looked from the
saddle and said: “I reckon it’ll stop at the
railway fence about half a mile from
“OZd stuff! Old stuff! Slip these cables and I'll show you how to

Geerey’s pub. I’ll think about gettm it
home when I get there.” “Just a minute,
replied Mac, “till I get me horse. 111 give
y’ a hand. That’s' too big a job for one
man.” Thus do the catastrophes of
Nature contain their own compensation.

“Zake”: Blanch’s city bride, used to
the necessity of squaring-off to the
grocer to get three eggs from under the
counter, was determined to have her own
fowls. To give her husband a surprise
she went into the township and bought
12 birds —one hen and 11 roosters!
Asked by her almost-hysterical spouse
how she came to select them like that, she
said it was the big combs that influenced
her choice. Blanch told us at the pub
that he didn’t know which looked the
most astonished when they were put
(temporarily) in the pen—the roosters or
the hen.

“Hoofpadder”: Any track - thumper
should know better than to depend on his
blankets alone to keep warm when bunk-
ing on the ground in cold weather (B.
30/ 6/ ’4B), which is why certificated knot-
humpers always carry (a) a strip of oil-
cloth or ( b ) several old newspapers or (c)
a piece of stout canvas or ( d) anything
that will keep the body heat from spread-
ing into the ground, not the ground cold-
ness from getting into the body. In the
absence of (a), (b), (c) or (d) a heap of
leaves or grass will serve. The notion
of stirring-up sleeping animals is one
popular with Boy Scouts and the fellows
who write lectures about “hiking”—a
theory that disappoints in practice.

“The Pirate”: A 60ft. derrick found
floating in the sea off Wilson’s Pro-
montory was brought to Melbourne by
the lighthouse-service steamer Cape York.
The 2ft.-thick, hollow-steel spar is re-
ported as being evidence that the steamer
Cambridge, sunk by an enemy mine off
the promontory in 1940, is breaking up
underwater. However, an identical
derrick for some years has been haunting
little-known, uninhabited Wingan Inlet
near Cape Everard. J. Warne, an oyster-
man of Merimbula, first moored the
menace to navigation at the inlet, but,
breaking away, it spent a year ashore
under Rame Head ; 18 months ago it be-
came wedged high up ih the rocks by the
Wingan entrance, only to be washed to
sea again in a gale last April. This month,
instead of the prevailing westerlies, there
have been hard easterlies off Wilson’s Pro-
montory. I fancy the derrick picked up
by the Cape York is from Wingan. Any-
way, it has been sold for £lOO.

“B. A. Ker”: For a full hour Joe had
been doing some phenomenal fishing—
from a chair in front of the fire ; then
he worked up to two that didn’t get
away: “Yairs, two fish on one hook —
and one didn’t swallow the other, either.”
Teddy was foolish enough to ask the ex-
pected question (Joe intended to tell us,
anyway). “I hooked the first one and
was dragging him in when I felt another
bite; the pull on the line got stronger,
too. After I’d landed ’em I could see
what had happened: the first one had
taken the lot, but when I struck him the
hook jagged out of his gills. There was
still bait on the hook, so the second bloke
had rushed in for his chop. I’ll bet that’s
a world’s record.” The silence screamed
“Liar!” but nobody spoke until lummy
drawled “Well, I never did much fishin’,
but the rest of ’em here will tell you this
is right. The hares have been chewin’
the bark off my fruit-trees, so one day
last week I waited for ’em with the gun.
I got five with one shot.” Joe came in.
“Five! What did you have —a cannon?”
Jummy shook, his head. “No ; just a
twelve-gauge and number four shot. _ Joe
looked at Jummy’s shoulders and didn’t
call him a liar. But he was a very puzzled
man when the rest of us took our Bible
oaths on the truth of the statement. No-
body felt called on to explain that
Jummy’s victim had turned out to be a
doe in a certain condition.

“Kelms”: Those vagrant ocean
currents through which “a dredge-net,
weighted with a mere hundredweight, will
not sink to the bottom” (B. 9/6/ 48)
accounted for the old belief amongst
sailors that sunken ships seldom touched
bottom —they simply descended until they
“reached their own level,” then remained
in suspense. This belief prompted the
inclusion in some Admiralty examination
papers of the question: “Will iron sink?
The number of negative answers caused
the question to be retained until a Com-
paratively recent date. For all I know it
may still be asked.

“Blime”: Rode into his camp the other
evening to find Dill boiling the billy;
and at his invitation slipped off for a
drink. Presently he poured out a couple
of mugs of tea and, diving under a pile
of bags, came up with a tin of chaff. He
chucked out a few sticks and bits of
bag, then, picking up a fistful of horse-
feed, dropped it into his tea and stirred
it carefully. “It ain’t the best,” he
apologised, shoving the tin in my direc-
tion, “but if y’ put in a good handful
it ain’t so bad.” I explained with thanks
that I never took it, and watched as Dill
finished his stirring and began scooping
off the floating chaff. “Been thinkin’ o’
buyin’ one o’ them strainer things for
the tea,” he remarked. “Not that chaff
ain’t good for y’. I’m just gettin’ fussy,
I s’pose.” “Yair; but what are you
chucking it out for?” I inquired. “1
mean, what did you put it in for?” So
I c’d drink it, o’ course. Gripes, a man’s
got t’ do somethin’ with this bloomin
shortage,” Dill growled between sips. I
mixed it ages ago, an’ I’m glad now that
Brownie left this bit. That poddy nag
I had,” he explained. “Remember?
Never would eat her flamin’ chaff, that
moke, unless it had sugar slopped into it.”

“Horseless Horseman”: For the most
widely-distributed bird my vote goes to
the sulphur-crested cockatoo. This near-
white flier is found anywhere from the
wild uninhabited west coast of Tasmania
—where I’ve seen him feeding on maggots
in the rotting kelp—through to the
jungle-clad slopes of mountain-top-like
Darnley Island at the northerly extremity
of the Great Barrier Reef, where the
screechers hang upside-down to tree-vines
while they feast on seeds. Generally they
have a hankering for the open plains and
the cleared lands of the interior, where
their snowy forms splotched over stal-
wart gums or river-flats are a refreshing
sight. However, it is around Christmas
on the mid-Murray that I’ve seen these
cockies most numerous. Then, from Re-
tail Bend around to Euston the redgum
bends are filled with the deafening crymg
of hungry youngsters, and in the late
afternoons it is common to see mobs of
2000 taking off up-river to feed.
THE DROWNED VILLAGES, WALES.
The lake is lying very still
Like liquid mirror-glass, and I
(Eyes upward to the standing hill
Or down, where shadows beautifully
Tangle the clouds in water) —I
Am in the company of ghosts.
For, in these painted depths there are
Two villages, whose watery coasts
Uncharted, make no dent to scar
The surface-clear tranquillity —
The little sea that is their sky.
And are the houses desolate?
Stone fallen from mossy stone, and weed
Long-fingered, fanning wall and gate
In a green twilight? And the seed
Of honeysuckle, violet, rose
Coffined in mud? And where the bee
Blunted, long since, his dusty nose
On the warm pane, fish lazily
Finning their glhnmery way alone
Through the sun-dapples on the stone?
O quiet, O empty quiet! No breath
Stirs in the stirring ait. Here is
Nothing but beauty, and the death
Of one more day, and memories
That have no lien on time.. .So.. .so,
This all is all; nor think to set
Even a footfall on the road
Re-echoing. And yet, and yet
A sound is trembling through the deep
Like church-bells moving in their sleep.

FREQUENTLY CAUSES IRREGULARITY
It is important to remember that changes of
food and living conditions invariably disar-
range the system, and when that occurs nature
needs assistance, at least temporarily. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are especially suited
for this purpose. When going away for a
change, always make a practice of having a
bottle with you and taking a dose occasionally
to stir the liver and keep the bowels acting
.regularly.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Drafting-yards and Drafting.
“R.A.A. Sergeant”; When
building new yards always locate
them so that the sheep will be
running up-hill to the race. The
race itself should be as nearly
as possible on a north-south line,
so that the sheep don’t have to
be forced into the sun and the
shadow of the drafter doesn’t
fall along the race, thus balking
the sheep. Never have the
check-pens extending back past
the race to the forcing-pen ; have
them long and narrow so that
the draft can be easily checked
and counted by walking slowly
back along the yard.
Have the forcing-yard small
and V-shaped, slightly offset, so
that the right-hand fence is a.
straight continuation of the
right side of the race. Close the
rails, posts or boards forming
the race and forcing-pen, even
boarding-over the forcing-yard
gate ; the sheep will then draw
naturally to the only opening—•
the throat of the race. The
forcing-yard gate should be
about as wide as the yard so
that with a free-running mob
the sheep can be allowed to run,
but with a balky lot can be
moved yard by yard.
Stout double-gates, each half
opening in the opposite direction
and with a solid block at the
foot, make a handy by-pass to
the race if located on the sloping
side of the forcing-pen. The
race should be long enough for
the drafter to recognise the ear-
marks at least three sheep back
from the gates. It is impossible
to draft at the gate.
If a water supply is handy,
damping the ground makes for
quicker and easier drafting.
Don’t try to draft a hot mob;
let them cool off, overnight if
possible, and 'they will almost
invariably run well. If drafting
lambs from ewes, put the lambs
straight ahead. Noisy humans
and yapping dogs are a nuisance.
Silence the one and chain the
other, though a man who knows
when to make a noise and a dog
that “speaks up” on command
are invaluable in the yards.
Rabbit Eradication.
“J.R.D.”: At a conference in
Sydney it was stated that the
trapper is almost as great a
menace to the pastoral industry
as the rabbit itself. Evidence
given proved the complete in-
ability of Australian manufac-
turers to meet the demand for
rabbitproof netting, and it was
estimated that it would take
years to catch up on the demand
even if pre-war conditions were
available. Shortage of rabbit-
traps is due to the fact that every
man, woman and child in
country districts is at present a
prospective- trapper, lured by the
high price of skins. The ques-
tion of importing netting was
discussed, but no netting is avail-
able from the United Kingdom
and the only source of supply''’in
Europe is Belgium.
Belgian netting would cost
approximately £5 for a 50yd.
roll landed in Australia. The
only other source is U.S.A.,
where supplies are available,
but where are the dollars? And
the U.S.A. price is more than
twice that of the local article.
It was suggested that some form
of subsidy could be made by
drawing on the dollars obtained
from the sale of rabbitskins to
America. The two most reliable
fumigants are obtainable only
from America, and import
licences granted so far are com-
pletely inadequate and aid little
in the control of the pest.
Every district has its own
problems. In the N.S.W. far
west netting fences are useless
because they quickly become
buried in sand. Chief use of
netting there is to fence off water
supplies. In a very good season
it would be practically impos-
sible to attack the rodents with
any success.
The lack of netting for sub-
division and repair of existing
fences has resulted in rabbits
overrunning hundreds of proper-
ties, Many P.P, Boards have
no rabbit inspectors, others need
more than one to cope with the
work. Anyhow, it is hopeless
to expect any board to beat the
rabbits so long as Government
lands are beyond their jurisdic-
tion.
Other points made at the con-
ference were the drain on
pastoral labor generally and
particularly on shearing labor
on account of high prices for
rabbitskins. Boys are leaving
school to take on rabbiting, and
as a result of the big money
their future is affected, as they
are not likely to settle down to
any steady work. Trapping as
a means of eradication was
roundly condemned. The trap-
per operates only on the buck-
heaps and seldom traps on the
burrows. Trappers make no
attempt to arrest rabbit breed-
ing ; when the bucks get scarce
in one paddock they move else-
where,
A C.S.I.R, man outlined
attempts to infect rabbits with
a fatal virus. This was a failure
because of the difficulty of trans-
mitting the disease. Further re-
search is to be done with a view
to finding a new avenue of
attack,
Manchester’s Method.
“R.N.”: As outlined in
demonstration at Warren
(N.S.W.) show, it consists of
making a permanently bare
patch on the breech of the sheep
with a caustic-potash solution
at a cost of Id. per head, the
sheep suffering little or no pain
and being thenceforth free of
wool on the treated area.
The demonstration, was
arranged by J, H. McKay, of
Kulkine, president of Warren
show society, who tried the Man-
chester method five years ago,
when all his 3000 breeding ewes
were treated. Every year now he
treats in June the ewes dropped
“Nobody says ‘ hullo ’ to y' here, not even on a
public telephone."
during the ' previous spring.
He treated four sheep each day
of the show, using a cradle of
his own invention which makes
holding them child’s play, Mc-
Kay had on show treated sheep
of various ages upon which the
bare patch showed up effectively.
It was demonstrated how
slightly the treated sheep were
affected, and the method of
treating carefully explained,
both by McKay and in a pam-
phlet distributed by the inventor,
Capt. L. L, Manchester, B.V.Sc.,
of Charleville (Q.). The process
is patented and a small fee is
charged for the right to use it.
McKay says that he had only
one (1) sheep struck out of 1000
“Manchestered.”
Watch the Cooling-system.
“K.L.M.”: A radiator in
which more than 20 p.c. of the
tubes or cells are choked is liable
to cause damage to the valves
by overheating, and to the
water-pumps by increasing the
resistance which they have to
overcome. This condition in-
creases fuel consumption.
Chemical treatment of the core
may clear blockages, the cost
being about £5. If, however,
many tubes or cells are packed
with deposits accumulated over
a long period, the only remedy
is to fit a new core, costing from
£l5 to £2O according to size.
Excessive use of “leak-stop-
pers” is liable to do more harm
than good. It is surprising how
many minor troubles in an en-
gine disappear when the cooling
system is reconditioned.
An Average Season.
“Agric”: J. L. Callaghan, of
the Queensland Land Court,
has given what the Court be-
lieves is envisaged in the term
“average season”;
Average season was what experi-
enced graziers residing sufficiently
long in the district to know the
occurrence of floods, droughts, dry
spells, the vagaries of rainfalls both
as to quantity and incidence, the
growth of pastures, including their
recovery from drought and dry spells
and their response to varied rainfalls
—would regard as a season when all
the causation factors of those
phenomena were so balanced that
stock to the numbers experienced
prudence would dictate would have
a sufficiency but not a superfluity of
pasture of adequate nutriment, to-
gether with adequate but not
superfluous water.
Having chewed that over and
stopped laughing, landmen sud-
denly found themselves pleased
that at last the Court is giving
serious consideration to this
vexed question. Crown advo-
cates generally regard reap-
praisements of rentals as an op-
portunity to increase them, and,
though rent is not a very im-
portant item in production costs,
many lessees feel that the Crown
takes advantage of any improve-
ments they make to increase
their carrying capacity and puts
their rents up. The Court’s
definition of “average season”
should make Crown advocates a
little more careful in their esti-
mates of carrying capacity,
which is influenced by the sea-
sons, when rentals are being de-
termined. There is room for im-
provement in Land Court pro-
cedure in Queensland.
Dear Lime.
“Fanoa”; In spite of the reply
slapped back at “Pat Ater” (B.
17/3/ ’4B), N.S.W. coast farmers
are paying high for their lime,
judged by New Zealand stand-
ards. Operating the largest
dairy factory north of Auck-
land, the Northern Wairoa
Co-op. Dairy Co. Ltd., of
Dargaville, last year sponsored
formation of a farmers’ co-
operative to acquire and operate
a lime-works. After providing
for payment of 5 p.c. interest to
shareholders —offered as an in-
centive to investment when sup-
port for the venture lagged
among a section of the dairy-
men —the co. in its first season
of operation is supplying high-
analysis lime ex works for 13s.
a ton in bulk, 15s. 6d. a ton
bagged when the buyer supplies
the bags.
In spite of an average rain-
fall of nearly 50in., yearly initial
applications of lime in this N.Z.
district have rarely gone beyond
a ton to the acre. Average
annual application thereafter is
about half a ton —sufficient to
maintain the lime status of the
soil and to provide pastures
which this year have set new
butter-production figures.
Cement-coated Hessian.
“Myrrhee”; A cheap and
lasting cover for a chicken-
house can be made by cement-
coating hessian or sacking over
a solidly-built wooden frame.
Stretch and nail the hessian over
the frame and dampen it half
an hour before applying the
wash. To give eight square
yards of material three coats use
121 b. of cement, 21b. of lime,
lib. of salt and ylb. of alum.
Sieve salt and lime and add to
H gallons of water. Stir while
adding and follow with the
cement and finally the alum.
Apply with a stiff brush outside
and then inside. After the initial
wetness disappears but before
the mixture sets give the outside
a second coat. Apply on a cool
day or late in the afternoon and
keep the surface damp for three
days with a fine spray.

lid immediately each cow is
finished. The tester will take the
milk and you can replace the lid,
sterilise and put the cups on the
next cow.
If you do handstrip, make sure
the cups are not hung up during
stripping. This is the greatest
cause of delay. Follow the
above procedure, but behind
each stand have a spare bucket
for the milk. After emptying
change the cups, then strip the
first cow. Make sure the strip-
pings go into the correct bucket
before the tester takes it.
Don’t hold the tester up by
unnecessary talk—-especially by
frequent inspections of his sheet.
You will see that later. Observ-
ing these rules, I milk just as
fast when he is present as nor-
mally. He can keep pace with
me with six stands, each milk-
ing 10 cows an hour.
Painting the House.
Don’t be haphazard
about it. The best way to find
the tints which will blend with
each other is to take a pansy
with colors which suit your or
the wife’s taste. Use the domi-
nant color in the flower for the
walls, the next prominent color
for the corner boards and cor-
nices, and the high color for
the panels, brackets, etc, A
color-conscious person can select
tints which will make the build-
ing look well colored from any
flower which carries more than
one tint.
If there are some knot-holes or
cracks which call for putty be-
fore painting, use equal parts of
whiting and plaster of Paris and
linseed oil to mix the putty.
Paint may be applied immedi-
ately the putty is used and there
will be no discoloration. Lime
should be avoided in putty; it
won’t take colors and always
shows up as a white blob.
After painting don’t stand the
brush in water; that process
causes the tin to rust and
shortens the life of the brush.
Work the brush on a board until
it is as free from paint and as
dry as it can be made. Then
hang it up, bristles down, in a
clean place. Enclosing the brush
in a paper-bag is a good idea.
To soften the brush for use again
immerse it in boiled oil to the
top of the hair. Heat the oil
and work the brush in it until
it is soft.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrr”: Avoid overstocking
and overgrazing, as too many
sheep in a paddock will increase
the risk of pasture contamina-
tion and worm infection of the
sheep. Nutrition plays a big part
in control. A strong, robust
sheep will throw off an infesta-
tion much more readily than a
weak, sickly animal. Lambs and
weaners shouldn’t be permitted
to suffer any check in growth,
and when the pastures begin to
go off they’ll need a supplement.
Oats, wheat, barley or maize,
£ib. to lib. a head per day, is
a valuable addition to normal
feed.
“W. Court”: As a fine, big
lettuce for sale Imperial 847
Black Seeded cannot be beaten.
They transplant all right during
the cooler months, the trans-
plants coming in two to three
weeks later than others. Allow
9in. to 12in. between plants to
ensure maximum growth in well-
broken soil made rich with farm-
yard manure. A drop of nitrate-
of-soda liquid manure 10 or 14
days before cutting will top them
off.
“Sarina”: The dwarf sensitive
plant is hardly a cane pest (B.
9/6/’4B), since it grows but a
few inches high, but the giant
variety, which grows as tall as
matured cane, is a different
proposition. Where this plant is
thick the cane can only be cut
at the cost of lacerated hands
and arms. The thorns seem to
be poisonous and set up severe
abscesses.
“Urana”: Boil-up the rabbits
from trapping or digging-out
until the meat falls apart. Next
morning mix them with pollard
and bran and feed to the fowls,
warm preferably. There is
nothing like it to bring on the
layers after their moulting spell
and for fattening the roosters for
table use.
“C.A.L.”: Don’t shorten the
life of a hat by denting in the
crown and filling with water for
thirsty dogs to drink. When
travelling with sheep on dry
stages carry a camp-pie or other
flat tin on the saddle for a drink-
ing vessel. A flat piece of paper
pressed into a small hole
scooped in the ground will make
a waterproof container for dogs.
“Girrawheen”: A valuable'
green-feed for poultry without
grass range is the ordinary dan-
delion. The leaves are rich in
minerals and carbohydrates
(calcium, iron, copper and phos-
phorus). The dandelion has long
been known for its medicinal
and laxative properties, and as
a medicine fed in this natural
form is far less likely to harm
fowls than crude chemical salts.
“C.A.A.”: Safflower, for
which, S. A. Agriculture Depart-
ment points out, there is an ex-
cellent market in Australia (at
£26 per ton, 65 per cent, of
world parity price of linseed, or
14s. to 20s. per bushel for clean

main well out of the soil.

MR. RICHARD THORNTON
A respected Member of Lloyd’s for many
years during the middle of the nineteenth
century, he electrified the city with his
daring Insurance risks. Mr. Thornton was
also described as a born adventurer, a reck-
less gambler and a fearless seaman. One
of his outstanding exploits was to take his
own ship into the Baltic in the teeth of the
enemy for a cargo of hemp to dispose of on
the London market.
ir This little thumb-nail sketch, which we
hope will be of interest to you, is one of a
series of personalities who were prominent

From the Secretariat of the
Cominform, Bucharest: “The
United Front of Eastern'Europe
Communist Parties greets its
comrades in Yugoslavia, and
warns them that their Leader
has made an unfortunate tactical
error by harboring Anti-Stalin-
ist, Anti-Leninist, Anti-Marxist
and Anti-Anti-thoughts, which
if unchecked will poison the
nation’s bloodstream. Traitors
to the New Democracy hope to
push you into the Western orbit,
where you will be exposed to
the devilish machinations of the
Marshall Aid Plan. Stick to the
Marshal Stalin Plan! It guaran-
tees for the happy worker black

From Communist Party H.Q.,
Belgrade: “Marshal Tito, after
having a new permanent-wave,
had his photo, taken this morn-
ing surrounded by 12 of his
favorite girl guerillas, who be-
tween them sniped no fewer
than 5751 Nazis. The Leader,
at a special investiture, reduced
himself to the rank of a com-
mon general in conformity with
the best Western practices.”
From a leading article in the
Tito-owned “Rude Deprave”;
The reduction in rank volun-
tarily suffered by our beloved
Leader is a clever manoeuvre to
confuse the Soviet octopus as to
the Leader’s true identity. The
filthy agents of the Kremlin
murderers will now look in vain
when trying to avenge them-
selves on one whose great power,
unexampled personal heroism
and, above all, photogenic
qualities they both hate and
fear.”
From the Secretariat of the
Cominform, Budapest: “The
fact that the Cominform has
moved its H.Q. quite freely and
openly from Bucharest gives the
lie direct, if it were needed, to
assertions of the war-mad
Western capitalist tyrannies that
the Cominform takes its orders
from Moscow. Actually, each
member-State is at perfect
liberty to make any independent
decision other than one unac-
ceptable to the Politburo. We
call on the loyal workers of
Yugoslavia to overthrow the
foul offal that calls itself Tito!”
From Brigadier
Tito’s H.Q. in tne
remote retreat from
which he bravely
directed the war
against Gen. Mihai-
lovich: “In the best
traditions of the
Western Demo-
cracies the only
true liberty - lovers
General Tito
has decided again to reduce
himself in rank, as well as divest
himself of the Order of the
Moulting Canary (Third-class)
with which the arch-traitor
Stalin had presented him. The
Brigadier-Leader urges his fel-
low-countrymen to throw off the
hated Moscow yoke and qualify
for the magnificent generosity
of the Americans as expressed
by the statesmanlike Marshall
Aid Plan. This has always been
the aim of your Leader—he has
up till now been frustrated in his
sincere desire for Western
friendship by the intrigues of
traitors who would sell their
country to the Soviet.”
From the “Rude Depravo”:
“In changing his name by deed-
poll to Teto, Major Tito has
struck a further clever blow to
confuse the assassins of the
Kremlin, whose system of mis-
government has spelt misery for
Yugoslav workers. Death to the
traitors who sold; you to Mos-
cow! Embrace the New Free-
dom ! ”
From Cominform H.Q., Mos-
cow: “Workers of Yugoslavia,
arise and garrot the arch-traitor
Tito, enemy of his country, the
man who treacherously hanged
the great, well-beloved patriot
Mihailovich! Rid your fair
land of this hated Fascist, this
mad dog .who would brutally
force you to take unwanted gifts
from the vultures of pluto-
cracy ! ”
From Sergeant Teto’s H.Q.,
same funkhole: “Only war-mad
power - hungry Imperialist - Ex-
pansionists have need for high-
sounding military titles. To
show his true humbleness*,
modesty and kinship with the
workers and peasants, your
Leader has reduced himself to
a common sergeant. He flings
his last dishonor, the Stalin-
bestowed Order of the Pansy,
back in the arch-murderer’s
teeth! ”
* * * *
Following efforts by the Com-
inform to reconcile Marshal
Stalin and Sergeant Teto, the
suggestion that the latter should
marry Anna Pauker has had a
curious sequel. Circles close to
Whitehall confirm that a request
has been received from a Lance-
Corporal Teto that to save him-
self from a fate worse than
death he has appealed urgently
to the British Government for
a position as Field-Marshal
Montgomery’s batman.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4§d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
American View
We migrants from America came to
Australia for two reasons —because our
wives were homesick, and because this
country seemed like a new frontier. We
Americans think of ourselves as the
descendants of pioneers and remember
the old days when the undiscovered lay
beyond the horizon. Wealth, we are
taught, was awaiting every “deadbeat”
who was willing to work for it. Hoboes
became railway magnates overnight.
When we discovered Australia in 1942
we tended to identify it with our own
golden era. This country became, for us,
the new land of promise. What we ex-
pected to find, after settling out here, was
good food and drink, an easy tempo of
life, cordiality—and limitless opportunity.
Our expectations have been exceeded on
the first three points. Your food is better
and cheaper than ours, your beer is the
best in the world, your “pace of living”
is comfortable and sensible and your
friendship genuine, unbounded and in-
valuable.
But there was that fourth element we
were looking for —that elusive American
dream of opportunity. Our inherited in-
stincts told us that the game of develop-
ing this huge, empty country would be
not only remunerative, but a fascinating
and challenging sport. Now that we are
here we find that no one, apparently, is
eligible to play.
We are not allowed to work hard. We
cannot obtain materials or labor to start
those little businesses we had planned.
We have no incentive to make money
when so much of it is taken to support a
huge bureaucracy. And we cannot see
why this strict regimentation and control
is necessary in a young, virile, healthy
nation. It seems to us like giving a man
a pill before he is sick.
Australia is a grand country with a
delightful way of life. We are perfectly
happy here —as long as we don’t look
over the horizon. — Yank Migrant (Vic,),
New New-State Movement
It would have been easy enough to
write in advance 90 per cent, of the
speeches made and the arguments put
forward at the new New-State confer-
ence at Armidale (N-S.W.), and they
would be just as valid and just about as
unanswerable as the same speeches and
arguments during the “old” New-State
movement of 1928-32 vintage, and the
countless speeches and arguments long
even before then.
Still, there is some hope in the thought
that the conference is taking place at
Armidale—the invigorating climate of
the New England Tablelands may, per-
haps, invigorate something more than
mere talk. After all, it was at Tenterfield,
just a bit north of Armidale, that Sir
Henry Parkes sounded the tocsin in 1889
which galvanised the Federal movement
into popular life. From 1889 to 1948 is
a long time between galvanisings, but
here’s hoping.
If words like “crucial,” “imperative”
and the like had not long since worn
into disuse in a country where nothing
ever seems crucial or imperative, one
could say it is of crucial importance to
the Australia of the future that this New-
State movement should become a reality.
The six-State paralysis will end when one
new State is really fashioned, fought for
and functioning.
If a New England State can arise out
of the constitutional coma into which the
continent went when somebody drew
lines on a map and called the inter-
vening spaces “States,” then Riverina,
Borderland (as they wanted to christen a
stillborn New-State movement in far s.-e.
N.S.W. a few years ago) and other new
States will spring into life.
If anybody has any doubt that the
New England movement and the recent
disastrous floods on the North Coast are
not bound together he should ask him-
self what would happen if the puny
Parramatta River suddenly changed to a
vast, unstemmable torrent smashing and
destroying homes, factories, bridges,
roads and gardens in and around Sydney,
There would be such a rush to provide
every possible engineering contrivance to
prevent the recurrence of such an “appal-
ling” disaster that it certainly would not
recur if manpower and money could
prevent it.
But Sydney’s capacity for stoically en-
during North Coast sufferings and losses
at an unwaterlogged distance of 500
miles is superb.
The only really striking thing about
these North Coast floods is their dreary
recurrence and their evident inevitability.
The story of the rivers is tangled all down
the years with the debris of destroyed
hopes and bankrupt expectations. How
vain, how absurd and how dishonest it is
to make public utterances, inspections and
the like about flood-control works in the
midst of a flood which such works would
have prevented!
Even if flood-control works began
tomorrow more floods would probably
bring disaster down the Clarence, Rich-
mond and Tweed during the five to 10
years which must elapse before control
could be completed.
When the people of New England can
spend their own money on their own
public works, then, and then only, will
they have it in their own power to direct
their social and economic destiny. The
New-State conference at Armidale needed
no more eloquent speech, no more con-
vincing argument, than the devastated
countryside stretching eastward from the
safety of the high tablelands. There, in
silent, twisted, saddened and, as things
are, hopeless testimony is the case for
the New England State in a form more
compelling than even the high oratory of
old Henry Parkes.—W. D. (N.S.W.).
“’ Struth, Bill, chuck it back! That's the cable to
England!”
Churchill
“Balaclava” (B. 16/6/M8) submits that
Churchill was turned down in 1945 be-
cause the public had tired of his flam-
boyant gestures.
The real reason is as old as history.
Men are grateful only for what they ex-
pect to receive. Churchill was elbowed
out by men who prophesied smooth
things. Capitalising on the war-weariness
of the nation they promised ease and
wealth without “blood, sweat and tears.”
Churchill told the truth before, during
and after the war. He was cast out not
because he flaunted a big cigar but be-
cause he refused to sell either the Empire
or his principles piecemeal for votes or
power. His individual voice and pen
still command more respect and honor
abroad than the entire chorus of time-
servers who supplanted him in office, but
who have dismally failed to equal him in
leadership and achievement. —V, (S.A.).
Stamp Revenue
If our Government wants easy revenue
from selling postage-stamps to collectors
it will have to cater for the customer.
That the game is worth while is proved
by 1947 sales by, the U.S. Postal De-
partment’s philatelic agency—3,504,739
dollars. These were direct sales to dealers
and philatelists by the agency, and did
not include sales to individual collectors
over ordinary P.O. counters, which would
probably at least double the figures.
First-day-of-issue sales in the U.S. are
big business. For a commemorative
stamp there are day-of-issue sales at the
appropriate P.O. (our Newcastle Cen-
tenary commemoratives would have been
launched at Newcastle’s P. 0.). There
are a special “first-day” postmark and
adequate arrangements to handle mail-
order as well as over-the-counter business.
Australia has nothing comparable to
the U.S. philatelic ag'ency. One of our
G.P.Os. certainly has «a counter at which
collectors can expect courteous attention
and a letter-box for posting “Philatelic
Mail” —the result of complaints by col-
lectors that stamps were frequently ruined
for philatelic purposes by heavy post-
marking, etc. But not everyone has access
to that G.P.O.
In Germany a notice was issued to
every P.O. instructing postal clerks, by
diagrams, how to obliterate and warn-
ing them against being heavy-handed
or careless at the job. The instructions
even stipulated that freshly-cancelled
letters should not be stacked one on the
other until the ink dried, and concluded
with the precept in heavy capitals:
“Dirty postmarks detract from the pres-
tige of the German post-office both at
home and abroad.” — Hist (N.S.W.).
White Australia
When “Perseverando” speaks of the
blacks on Melville and Bathurst Islands
(B. 9/6/’4B), he fails to mention that the
Jap airman who was arrested by the
blacks saw many of his “honorable
brothers’ children.”
I remember taking the first Lockheed-
Hudson to Bathurst Island late in 1941 —
just before the first Darwin raid —and
seeing these frightful-looking children
who had been “sired” by the enemy.
It made me determined Japs would
never enter Australia. We. have a White
Australia; let it always stay white or
we will see much more of what I saw that
sticky morning seven years ago. —
Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.),
S.A. Fisheries
S.A. is to put its fishing industry on
a sound basis. The chief inspector
of fisheries has carried out all the ex-
ploratory work for 10 years, and a move
is now being made to spend a quarter of
a million pounds to provide boat havens,
landing equipment, slip-
ways and refrigeration.
The most promising
waters for larger boats are
found at Thevenard, Streaky
Bay, Port Lincoln, along
the northern shores of
Kangaroo Island and Robe.
Expenditure will be spread
over most of the coastline,
with havens in the bays
from Coffin’s to Thevenard
on the west coast, in
Spencer’s Gulf and the
south-east coast. Something
new in the way of wave-
screens will be introduced at
Moo n t a and
Wallaroo. To de-
fray the cost fish-
ermen will pay
reasonable
charges where up-
to-date facilities
are provided.
Havens will
permit the use of
bigger boats and
will also secure
smaller vessels,
the majority of
which have been
the refuge of many men facing unemploy-
ment or seasonal work. Mobile ice-boxes,
refrigeration, canneries and quick-freez-
ing co-operatives will enable distant
markets (most of the S.A. whiting goes
to Melbourne) to be supplied without
losses, once so serious. Small dinghies
giving men a precarious living will be
gradually replaced by large fishing cutters
ranging from 50ft. to 80ft. One large
cutter of 30-ton capacity is already
operating, but .most fishermen want
the protection of havens and wave-
screens before launching out with
bigger boats.
The Leigh Creek coal scheme, once
dubbed “Playford’s baby,” is now grow-
ing into a lusty youth—what price
Adelaide without it during the continuous
shortage of Newcastle coal? With the
addition of the “Whyalla Pipeline” and
“Fish for the People,” Playford’s second
family of “babies” will be of lasting
benefit to the State. —J. L. (S.A.).
Elder Statesmen
A British politician who has grown
grey in service and who no longer feels
equal to playing a major political part
can, if appointed, retire to the Lords.
There, abandoning strong party lines, he
can fill the role of elder statesman, giving
expression to his genuine opinions on
matters of moment. Thoughtful non-
party electors pay far more attention to
the utterances of such than to those of
members of the Commons,
True elder statesmen are lacking in the
Australian national Parliament because
no one can retain membership for any
length of time save through active associ-
ation with one of the parties. A reform
could easily be effected without recasting
the Commonwealth, electoral system
Members of either house with 25 con-
tinuous years of service, all former Com-
monwealth Ministers not holding seats
and retired High Court Judges could be
given the right to attend Senate sessions
and speak, but not vote. Ex-State
Premiers could be accorded the same pri-
vilege.
Australia would thus be assured of
hearing the views on all great national
questions of men who could speak their
minds without fear of injuring their own
political future or a political organisation
with which they were connected. An-
other advantage would be that safe seats
in the Representatives now filled by
veterans could becorhe available to
younger men. — Kanimbla (N.S.W.).
Sydney or the Bush
It is hard to get men for station work
(B. 3/3/’4B), but bush workers generally
make more than city workers. Those
£B-a-week jobs are not so plentiful in the
city, and £6 a week in the bush, all found,
is better than £8 and find yourself.
Stockmen and shepherds on the road
usually get more than £6 a week. Con-
tract workers in the bush—fencers,
shearers, damsinkers and drovers —earn
far more than contract workers in the
city. At present £2O a week, for most
of the year, is about average earnings.
I don’t know whether a tram-conduc-
tor’s job could be called an enviable one
by city standards, but at least one con-
ductor I yarned with didn’t think so. He
did tell me his pay, but in the face of
what “Kell” says' about city wages I
couldn’t have heard properly. He asked
me all sorts of questions about pay,
mostly for fencing, and I even promised
to give him work. We made an appoint-
ment to meet the next day. When he
turned up he remarked “Nothing doing,
mate, the old woman won't shift,” and
he seemed rather disappointed. I’ve seen
him several times since, and each time he
asks about bush-life generally.
I don’t know what constitutes a gentle-
man’s life, but if it includes living in some
of the places called homes in city areas,
well, any other sort of a life would suit
me. Apart from the construction, they
are too close together and a man can’t
sing in his bath, have a friendly argu-
ment with the missus or have a party with
some of his friends without inquisitive
neighbors poking their noses in.—J. S. L.
(N.S.W.).
Universities and Culture
While the preachment by “El V.” (B.
16/6/’4B) about Australian universities’
failure to promote culture is all too true,
it is rather unfair to state that “an odd
island like Chris Brennan is about
all the land visible in a wide ocean.” As
far as Sydney University is concerned,
Brennan appears rather as the centre of
an archipelago embracing J. le Gay
Brereton, Leslie H. Allen, H. M. Green,
R. G. Howarth and Robert FitzGerald —
all of whom have written fine poetry and
contributed much to scholarship in
general.
Novelists may have beep rarer. Still,
Vivian Crockett was a uni. student aged
20 when he wrote “Messalina,” a his-
torical novel recommended for publica-
tion by Brennan ; and the first Bulletin
prizewinners Marjorie Barnard and
Flora Eldershaw, as good novelists as
one could wish for, are both graduates.
Jack Lindsay, an outstanding classical
writer of today, is a graduate of Queens-
land Uni. These at least show the active
force of real culture at our universities.
And “El V.” isn’t quite right about
our libraries. I have found the Mitchell,
gpod as it is, lacking in vital materials
oh several occasions during research
work. In other libraries even essential
books are often lacking altogether, while
one often waits in a Tong queue of weeks
for new books of any kind. Lord Nuf-
field recently awarded four research
scholarships to graduates under 35. A
worthy gesture. But the foundation of
a library for research students of all ages
would do more lasting good.—X. T.
(N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
Pillaging on the N. S. Wales railways
is “unofficially” estimated to be going
on at the rate of £200,000 a year. In
1946-47 the losses were £217,427, and
that figure was official. The department
put on special watchmen, only to find
that some of them joined in the looting.
To get over this difficulty it “appointed
patrolmen at higher wages than had been
paid to watchmen'.” Apparently the
wages' weren’t high enough; at any rate,
the standard of honesty of some special
patrolmen wasn’t. Some of them have
already been convicted of theft. —B. B. J.
(N.S.W.).
There should be a law against “visiting
firemen,” both here and in the U.S.A.
As a result of brigades attending
“demmos” in other parts three Victorian
towns have suffered losses' by fire in re-
cent months. Property which might
otherwise have J)een saved included an
aeroplane hangar, a row of shops and a
dwelling. The same thing happened in
America the other day when an airliner
crashed into a Pennsylvania hillside. In-
stead of being on hand the firemen were
30 miles away at a “convention parade.”
—Carlyle (Vic.).
