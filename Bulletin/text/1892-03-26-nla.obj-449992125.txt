This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIYATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses not hing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

Dr. PATERSON lias been engaged for over
Twenty Years in the study and practice of
QHRONIC, NERVOUS,
AND
Special Diseases
Of Men and Women in the leading .Medical Schools and
Hospitals of Great Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in private practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonics who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Sufferii g from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism,impure blood, weakeningdischarges, impaired
vigor,sterility, premature decay,stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
(heir business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of
2s. Cd. he will forward his book on the “Male

The Savage with a Weak Constitution.
The proposed revival of the Kanaka traffic iu
Queensland concents all Australia. Federation
may come or may stop away, but the Austral!as
have got to live together in peace or share
the fate of the Kilkenny cats. The plan-
tation aristocracy of the Southern States
came into collision with the while democracy
of the North and the result was the bloodiest
civil war of modern days; and for the same
causes, should the capitalistic party in the North
succeed in making Queensland a plantation-
state, with servile labour for its corner-stone,
alas for the cause of Australian union ! What
Queensland would become under planter rule
may be surmised from the changed tone
apparent in the capital since the black labour
revival. Political morality has gone down as
the temperature falls on the near approach of
an iceberg; and the capitalistic press hardly
think it worth while to clothe with sophistical
reasonings their bald declaration that Govern-
ment and Parliament are entitled to do any-
thing that they can by force effect. It would
seem absurd and useless for a Government to
seek to reverse the policy of a country, just
before a general election, but there is a deep
reason for the course proposed to be taken in
Queensland. The new black-labour party in
their hearts do not believe that the opinion
of the country is changed. If they did
they would have the general election first
and the change of policy after. But they
know they have a condemned, played-out
Parliament to deal with, and they believe that
under threat of a penal dissolution the Assembly
will pass a black-labour law, although live-
sixths of its members are pledged against it.
Once passed, they trust that the wail about
“ capital invested on the faith of Parliament ”
will restrain the incoming Legislature from
reversing their action, or, should that fail, they
think that the Council can be relied upon as
usual to thwart the will of the people.
# # *
The political situation in Queensland at this
moment would be impossible in almost any
other country in the world, and it would not be
believed of Queensland if the proofs were not so
absolutely complete and unanswerable. A
Government, the leading members of which are
pledged up to their eyes to oppose the rcintro-
duction of coloured labour, declare through the
press their intention of forcing a measure for
its reintroduetion through a Representative
Chamber five-sixths of the members of which
are also solemnly pledged to oppose it. This,
too, at the end of t he fourth year of a Parlia-
ment that lias passed a Triennial Parliaments
Bill ! And honest, reputable men calmly
assume that there will be traitors enough and
to spare to ensure its passage. Consistency is
openly scoffed at, and the man who will not go
back on his pledges is made the target of Inc
dominant faction and their servile press. One
Minister of the Crown said in Parliament on
23rd October, 1890
The force in favour of hlack-labour is n coherent, active
force; it is o wealthy body having paid emissaries in
every part of the colony ; whereas the people opposed to
t are not coherent, their occupation as a rule requiring
them to wander about the country to a large extent. The
miners would be the great opponents of black-labour.
The person who uttered these words in 1800
is the Minister of Mines in the present Govern-
ment, one of the representatives of a great
mining constituency—The Burke —and he is
now using all his influence and his great
abilities to force black labour on the country
whilst the hands of his constituents are tied
through their mistake in accepting him as their
representative. The work of this wealthy,
ever active body is now abundantly apparent
though it is working through new instruments.
The manufacture of a spurious public opinion
designed to furnish weak or unprincipled
members of Parliament with an excuse for
violating their election pledges is its first aim.
And unfortunately the press is to a great extent
at its command. Every little tin-pot associ-
ation, consisting of three men and a paid secre-
tary, by passing a resolution applauding the
manly and straightforward action of the
Premier in deserting his party and turning his
back ou his whole political life, can have its
name and fame transmitted by wire (probably
the first intimation of its existence) to the far
ends of Australia ; but if a meeting of electors
properly called together exhibits any lingering
respect for good faith and honesty, its proceed-
ings are either suppressed or so vilely distorted
that no mortal can find out the truth from the
report. The bogus-petition trick is being
worked for all it is worth. Petitions are got
up for presentation to Parliament, signed by
working-men—not, however, by the unfortunate
wretches out of employment to whom the 15s.
a week and rations of the “free” Kanaka
would be a godsend, but by men in full employ-
ment who, for fear of losing their billets, are
compelled to bow themselves down in the house
of Rimmon and pretend to worship with their
employer at the altar of servile labour.
* * *
But chiefly this wealthy body—or rather the
brainy men in its employment —have been busy
lately in making little perches for “ converts ”
to hop ou to in their passage across from
Liberalism to the dominant faction. They are
poor, rotten twigs at best, but the flimsiest
support is welcome to the feet of a convert
with a little conscience left. The three most
highly-favoured by the tender-feet, and, there-
fore, most assiduously recommended, arc :
1. Tropical agriculture requires tlie labour specially
fitted by nature for it (/.«., of course, the Kanaka).
2. Iu future there will be no abuses in connection with
recruiting.
3. In future the Kanaka will not come into competition
with the white man.
The complete answer to the first argument is
—the Mortality Table. The white man can do
the work, but doesn’t like it; the Kanaka
likes it as little, but can’t do it so well. If the
white man gets sick and tired of it the
Kanaka gets sick and tired of it. And it is
that particular work that kills him. If he
died on his native islands at half the rate ho
dies in growing cane iu Queensland, he would
have become extinct long before now. On one
plantation, out of 78 Kanakas, 23 died in ten
months. Will white men and women who go
to church ou Sunday and subscribe during the
week to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals pause and think of that!
Two doctors, sent up by the Queensland
Government to investigate matters reported : —•
Tht Kanaka plantation in Maryborough district might
also be looked upon ns an adult male one, and yet in
the year 1879 the mortality was 74 per 1000, while on the
Yengarie, Yarra Yarrn, and Irrawana, the plantations
belonging to K. Crax and Co., the mortality in the flve-
nnd-a-quarter years ending 31st March, 1880, was 92 per
1000, and for the year 1879, 107 per 1000, and for the
three months ending 31st March, 1880, 100 per 1000.
« * »
This shows how ungratefully the Kanaka
behaves towards his employers when engaged
in the work for which he is specially fitted.
When they get away to other occupations they
don’t die quite so fast ; hut taken all round in
Queensland they die about four times as easily
as the whites ! Taking the census period—from
1886 to 1891 —there have been in the province
about 10,000 Kanakas, 8000 of whom are sup-
posed to be engaged iu growing sugar. The
officially-recorded deaths are ; 1886, 598 ; 1887,
513; 1888, 524; 1889, 492; JB9O, 450 ; total
funeral bill for five years, 2577. The death-
rate of Europeans iu Queensland in 1890 was
12.81 per 1000 ; of Kanakas during the same
year, 46.44. The Registrar-General of Queens-
land in his latest report has something interest-
ing to say about the Kanaka death-rate. He
says:—-
This noticeable high death-rate of Polynesians may be
accounted for in several ways, some of which causes, no
doubt, lead to consumption, “ the disease most prevalent
amongst people of this race.” The inbreeding for long
periods of certain tribes on the Islands produces a race
which seems peculiarly liable to contract phthisis, so that
the change of climate from the humid atmosphere pre-
vailing in the islands of the South Seas to the drier air of
this continent, and the great difference in diet, &c.,n1l
tend (o predispose a naturally weak constitution to a
disease most fatal amongst (hem.
• • •
A naturally weak con dilution. This is the
great secret. From this source springs that
quality which has endeared the Kanaka to the
plantation-owner his docility. When he
doesn’t die altogether, he remains half-dead
and quite submissive. He is priceless to the
planter, because pre-eminently kickable. In
Queensland, at the present time, the Almighty
is freely accused of having expressly designed
him to thrash canc for the MTlwraithian
capitalist. Ho is the rock upon which the
future greatness of Queensland is going to be
built up. I'lie great combination Government
lias achieved a triumph of statesmanship. A
community of nearly 400,000 whites, with a
country abounding in natural resources, is going
to be saved from ruin by the enforced labours
of some 8000 savages with weak constitutions !
Would such a brilliant idea have occurred to a
common Labour member not versed ir the
science of Government ?
• • •
The second perch is soon knocked over. One
of the reasons that actuated Parliament in
, trying to stop the labour-recruiting, was the
conviction forced upon it by facts that tire
abuses were inseparable from the traffic. When
men charged with murder, piracy, and other
South Sea recreations, were tried and con-
victed, what was the excuse put forward for
them by their friends? If, was that those were
incidents of the traffic, and that it was not fair
to visit upon the heads of individuals the sins
of the system under which they worked.
Government and Parliament then confessed
themselves impotent to cleanse the traffic. Are
they more powerful or more moral now ? Is
the morality of the Government at the present
time any higher than that of an African
slaver? Are”they not now contemplating a
gigantic breach of faith with the people of
the province, in forcing this hideous thing again
on a free white community, and can they be
trusted to make even a serious effort to perform
the impossible feat of making a traffic in servile
labour respectable or humane? The black-
labour men declare beforehand they will not
have it—they demand that the traffic shall be
freed from “ those irritating Government inter-
ferences ” and that the planters shall have a
“free hand.” In future, we are told, black
labour is not to come into competition with
white labour. Why in the future more than in
the present ? The law says now that it shall be
restricted to field labour in agricultural produc-
tion, but though for the last eight years at
least the anti-Kanaka party has been in the
ascendant the law has been openly, shamelessly,
and continually violated with the full know-
ledge of every Government that has held office.
Will the pro-Kanaka men, if they get the
upper hand, enforce that law ? They claim now
a “free hand.” The irritating Government
interferences annoy them. If future Kanaka
labour is not to come into competition with
white, why not make a start by compelling the
plantation owners to employ the two or three
thousand Kanakas who are now—in most cases
illegally—competing with white labour ? No,
they will not have these. The “ free ” Kanakas
want wages; they want to be treated like
men ; they are not kickable. The black-labour
men will never respect a law that cuts against
them ; an anti-Kanaka Government could never
make them, and a pro-Kanaka Government
will never try to. The talk about preventing
Kanakas from coming into competition with
white men is pure bosh and treachery ;
it is dust raised by the special pleaders
of the black-labour party to throw into
the eyes of the white workers. The big
plantation-owners want to keep stocking
their plantations with continual relays of
newly-caught savages. If allowed to do that,
what is the inevitable result ? The fat,
seasoned, so-called “free” Kanaka, who has
acquired the white man’s vices and lost his old
facility for dying, will over-slop into the towns
in constantly increasing numbers, and be an
ever-darkeuing curse on the community —a
curse- which, alas ! too often falls, not upon
wealth, whose greed has evoked it, but upon
helpless want that lives outside the shields and
safeguards behind which the luxurious rich lie
securely entrenched. Every year swells the
ranks of the “free” Kanaka, who will not go
away or die, but will stop and breed.
# # *
The partizans supporting the Government in
their new departure are also cogitating another
brilliant idea. Bui ikjet, the domestic servant,
is not sufficiently reliable. They think a nice
female Kanaka could do all the work possibly
for less wages and without “ talking back.” So
a deputation of planters and farmers at Buuda-
berg have asked the Minister for Lands—who
la the one consistent, unchanging supporter of
black slave-labour in the Cabinet—that the
female islanders who came to Queensland might
be allowed to “ assist in housework.” Even
Mr. Cowley had to admit himself rather aston-
ished at this new development, and he is going
to consult the “illustrious convert,” Sir Sam.
Griffith, before committing himself. What
Queensland is now wo know ; what it will be
in ten years’ time we can only surmise from the
policy that is, adopted. Let us look at the census
returns: —The total populationou Ist May, 1886,
was 322,853. On sth April, 1891, it was 393,718.
In five years the population was increased by
70,865. Free and assisted immigration during
that period accounts for over 40,(MX) of that
number. The balance is not equal to the
natural increase. The population is not actually
dwindling, but it is approaching the stationary
point. Let white Australia pause and think
over this ;—The Coalition Government propose
to revive the Kanaka labour traffic ; and they
are now listening to the prayer of their sup-
porters that the female Kanaka shall be per-
mitted to oust the white girl from, the house-
hold. If this party succeed iu their designs,
what will Queensland be ten years hence ? The
whole middle class—small traders, artisans,
white servants —will be crushed out or reduced
to the condition of mean whites, and Queens-
land, glorious Queensland! teeming with wealth,
agricultural and mineral—will bccomea paradise
of the Devil, inhabited by two classes, the
MTlwraithian capitalist and the savage with a
weak constitution.
Inspectors of Agriculture.
About the last official act of the Parkes
Government in New South Wales was the
establishment of a Department of Agriculture,
and about the first official act of the Dibbs
Government was the appointment of four
inspectors of agriculture in connection there-
with, to pervade the country and encourage the
bucolic industry generally. The duties of an
inspector of agriculture are not very well
defined, but presumably he will travel round
and look with a vacant eye at oats and other
vegetables, and will gaze listlessly at potatoes,
and pass on, and draw Ids salary. The oats
will grow no better for being inspected, and
(lie potatoes will not improve in any way
under the light of the official eye, and, so far as
we arc aware, no one anticipates that they will.
Hut when any Australian industry is languish-
ing it is always regarded as the correct tiling to
appoint some pompous official to inspect it, and
some day, on the same principle, it will he
found advisable to inspect the Australian him-
self when he is languishing, and somebody will
he appointed at a Targe salary to supervise old
men, and to look at persons with weak spines
and tottery logs. For inspection, to the official
mind, is a species of fertiliser which makes
things grow with renewed vigour, and when the
building trade falls flat some future Go vein-
meat will endeavour to galvanise it into new
life by appointing an inspector of dead walls,
and when the floods prove unusually disastrous
in some year of rain and misfortune a Depart-
ment of Slush will be created to fix its eye on
the debris left behind by the overflowing rivers
of a sodden continent. Yet, strangely enough,
the same men whose faith in the inspection of
other people is so boundless and sublime have
no confidence in the nostrum when applied to
themselves. It was Pauk.es who first con-
ceived the idea of appointing itinerant officers
to go round and supervise the agricultural
industry, and the rage of Parkes when any-
body supervises him is something to be
remembered.
* * *
The agricultural industry of New South
Wales is a failure, for various reasons. The
first essential of the agriculturist is a market
for his produce, and as half the population of
the province is crowded into the city of
Sydney, that capital is practically the only
market available. But under the Freetrade
regime, with low sea-freights and enormously
expensive land-carriage thrown in, this has been
practically closed to the great mass of New South
Wales farmers. The cheap grain of the pro-
tected agriculturists of California and Maori-
land has supplied most of the city’s mpiire-
ments, and the wheat-grower of the far interior
left his unsaleable crops to rot for want of a
purchaser. The lack of water conservation, too,
makes the prospects of the selector exceedingly
precarious. His work is hard ; and dull, heavy,
monotonous, unremunerative toil under the
burning summer sun of Australia has few
attractions. There is little joy in digging pain-
fully and slowly upon the great immensity of a
waterless plain, where no green thing is visible
from one horizon to the other, and where the
labour seems as hopeless as the effort to grow
flowers upon a gallows. The method sof New South
Wales agriculture are too horribly and mono-
tonously English. There is no necessity for
elaborate irrigation in England, therefore the
Cornstalk farmer docs not irrigate, and the rest
of his system, or want of system, is on the same
pattern. Here and there, in the howling wastes
of the alleged arable lauds, some Frenchman or
German, with that ready adaptability which
distinguishes his race from the cast-iron Anglo-
Saxon, has constructed a paradise by suiting
himself to local conditions, but these spots are
few and far between. What the Australian
farmer wants, in the first instance, is to forget
that there is, or ever was, such a place as
England, to abolish English agricultural pro-
fessors, and to make a bonfire of all the English
works on agriculture, and to start afresh on
Chinese or Indian or Algerian principles.
* # *
Moreover, the young Australian hates the
bush with a great and holy hatred, and he
loathes the cart-horse and the plough and all
the other concomitants of agriculture. There
is little poetry in his composition ; for that
matter, there is hardly any poetry in any-
body’s composition. The agriculturist, almost
all the world over, is heavy, dull, and
stupid ; the poetic shepherd of fiction and
drama is a lie, and the joyous peasant
gill of romance is just as impossible and
as incongruous as a romantic executioner
or a genile, unsophisticated soul in the gaol-
flogging business. The bush Ihpior is bad, and
the bush public-house is remote and unattrac-
tive ; there is no theatre among the wilds, no
nigger-minstrel show, no boxing saloon, no tug-
of-war, no evening paper with the tale of an
“ ’Orrid Deed ” told in huge, black capitals, no
waxworks, nothing. Even the dreary Stanley
does not go there to tell, in the dead level of
his solemn monotone, the tale of how he found
Livingstone. And instead of all these joys
there are great, glaring wastes of earth, a burn-
ing sun ; the dull, uneventful snake and the
occasional lizard ; sand-flies, sand, and sandy-
blight; the skeleton and rusty billy and rusty,
iron-shod boots, now and then, of some lost
swagsman ; a kangaroo at long intervals; a
nigger here and there ; a long, long vista of
melancholy, barbed-wire fences spreading all
through eternity—and that is about all. Even
the alleged music of the river on its bars of
golden sand is a failure, for the river, in most
cases, is a chain of stagnant water-holes with
the heads of dead cattle emerging from the
slime, and when the waterholes become dry,
then the river is a river of ashes flowing
through a land of fire. Amid these surround-
ings t he vegetable pursuits of New South Wales
languish, and even 40,000 inspectors would
make little difference in the situation of affairs.
# # #
The four inspectors of agriculture who are
supposed to revolutionise this blighted industry
are endowed with no particular authority of
any description ; there is nothing definite to do,
and they have no definite power to do it. They
are not even starting to make bricks without
straw ; they are rather starting without straw
to make nothing. When one of them strikes a
selection out on some arid waste in the far west
he is, apparently, authorised in a general way
to lean over the fence and say, in effect, “ How s
things?”—and the selector will probably reply,
in effect, “Go to —.” The inspectors, so fat * 8
can be learned, are merely four dreadfully
ordinary individuals with a dubious smattering
of knowledge on the subject of vegetation.
When there is anything radically wrong m 1 1
methods of agriculture they may be com-
petent to recognise it, or, again, they may
not—-the latter is much the more probable
hypothesis. If they do recognise it and mention
the fact the agriculturist may start a dog a
them, or he may not—that is also a matter ox
conjecture. They have no legal authority
force the misguided, conservative cockatoo o
of his old unprofitable groove and info a n
one ; if they had they would probably or(
the wretched farmer to dig irrigation chann
uphill, or to sow' the seed of the cow r m
autumn so that the animal might come *
before the excessive heats of summer. A

An inspector, even in his highest and no )
form, is only a man who gazes at some n h-
Some inspectors gaze at tilings which j


understand, and some at things which they
don’t understand. Others, again, don’t gaze
a t anything, and they all seem to produce
nothing. #
There are various methods by which the New
South Wales farmer may be raised from his old,
hopeless situation. The establishment of a
protective tariff will give him a tolerably sure
market, in the first place—an advantage which
he has never yet possessed. Next, he urgently
wants a good system of local government, such
as already exists in Queensland and Victoria, so
that he may learn to rely more upon his own
exertions, and less upon the great race of log-
rollers, politicians, department-trotters, and
other frauds. Thirdly, he wants a system of
irrigation and water conservation, conducted
hy focal trusts ; even the best irrigation scheme
would fail if worked entirely by one central
authority, for then the department would pre-
sently degenerate into a centre of corruption,
and water would be sold for votes, and reser-
voirs swapped for political influence, and the
locality which voted straight would have six
artesian wells, and the one that didn’t vote
straight wouldn’t even have a 400-gallon iron
tank. Further, a certain amount of good may
result from the establishment of colleges, where
agriculture would be taught upon a thoroughly
'scientific basis, though the results achieved by
these institutions are, as a rule, woefully dis-
appointing. For, in his grovelling reverence
for everything English, the Australian generally
imports his professors, and these individuals
teach according to the rules and methods of
England, and solemnly warn the students of
this drought-cursed land to avoid excessive
moisture, and instruct the inhabitants of a
country where the summer air is molten fire to
beware of frosts, and to keep an eye upon snow
and intense cold. But even at its worst the
agricultural college has some redeeming features,
and the high-priced inspector has none. For
he only walks around and looks at things as
they are, and things get no better for being
looked at. Moreover, if agriculture is likely
to get better by being inspected, then trade—
which is likewise bad—ought also to be in-
spected to see if it will improve under the same
process; and the Sydney Daily Telegraph
leaders—which are worse—should be inspected
in a similar fashion, and for a similar purpose.
Further, the inspectors themselves may possibly
want to be inspected, and also the officials who
inspect the inspectors, and the process is nearly
interminable.
The Criminal Conscience.
The attempt made by the press and public to
arraign the Windsor and Rainhill murderer on
the ground of ordinary human conscience, and
to pass judgment upon his misdeeds from the
standpoint of the normal man strikes The
Bulletin as simply ludicrous. The man is
essentially an instinctive criminal, and being an
instinctive criminal, he lies entirely outside the
moral range of average humanity. His crimes
may be revolting in the extreme, and the
motives that urged him to commit them utterly
incomprehensible, but it is just about as logical
to descant on the wickedness of the shark or
the ethical callousness of the tiger as to treat the
born murderer as other than an irresponsible
throw-back whose mental and moral develop-
ment has not yet reached the high-water mark
of the modern standard,
• # #
This view does not of necessity compel the
man who holds it to an admission of the injus-
tice of destroying such an enemy to human
solidarity as Williams must be. It only
places the reason for his destruction upon other
and more rational grounds. It denies the puni-
tive effect upon the man himself, and the
deterrent effect upon instinctive criminals
atavistically fashioned in the same mould. It
is simply impossible to punish Williams,
and the long catalogue of his alleged crimes
if accepted as authentic sufficiently demon-
strates that all the hangings carried out
in the name and by the sanction of British
law were not enough to deter him from the
commission of those very crimes for which
others were hanged. If it be necessary
to annihilate Williams, it must be be-
cause he threatens the existence of any
such thing as human society. He is a
revival in our own century of the savage, the
conscienceless and non-ethical man of some
remote age far arear. He may be dangerous,
and therefore a fit subject for destruction, but
he is absolutely irresponsible ; and to confound
him with those whose crimes were consequent
°n passionate outbreaks, which are frequently
the result of too much rather than too little
morality, is to give the denial to all the know-
ledge of criminal psychology which modern
science has patiently and laboriously accumu-
lated. “ The vilest of the red-handed host,”
as a Sydney daily somewhat grandiosely puts
it, have not as a rule very much conscience
"herewith to be “horrified,” and such con-
science as they possess seldom gives much
hy way of ethical results upon analysis.
Ibe \\ illiams of the daily papers is a
m au apart from men. The psychologic
pendulum oscillates but over a very limited
segment of the semicircle of moral or immoral
possibilities in the average mortal. A degree
°r two more in the range of its swing is often
a H the difference between eccentricity and mad*
jiess, crime, and genius, and whether the case
)e one for the doctor or the executioner, the
'"ad-house or the Elmira Reformatory, future
legislators will be compelled to decide, but we
a ie justified, at this late day, in objecting to
ie stupidity that confounds health with
disease, and Othello with Burkk and Hare.

bi his fascinating volume, “ Erewhon,”
1 amuel Butler devotes a chapter to the
criminal anthropology and psychology of his
utional Utopia, in which he details the differ-
-WS® treatment accorded to the physically
i ro 'n that meted out to the morally
isane, and it is a moot point whether
j'l*. I, * eaa on the subject are not far more
ln °rc conducive to the genuine
\vi • i the human race, than those
iich arc crystallized in the legislation of our
"H tune. In “ Erewhon ” the sick are not
carefully nursed in hospitals ; they are segre-
gated in gaols, or rather lazar-houses, and every
Chance is given them for a reasonable period to
repent the error of their ways. Should they,
however, persist in the crime of sickness, scant
mercy is shown them. They are hustled out of
existence with severe reprehension, lest their
abominable conduct should infect the healthy
outside community. With the ethical offender,
far other means are adopted to win him back to
moral sanity. He is condoled with by his
friends, and carefully tended by doctors and
nurses, until a cure is effected, and he is once
more fit to resume his place in the society of
his fellows.
* * *
We are many thousands of years from
philosophical “ Erewhon,” and we shall go on
lecturing our criminals and hurling press in-
vectives at their heads ; Judges will moralise
when passing sentence upon the enormity of
crimes which the perpetrators never once
reflected upon, or considered in the light of
crimes at all; clergymen will contrive to snatch
the conscienceless souls of criminals from the
burning, and translate to Heaven non-moral
atavistic creatures whose presence would be an
affront to the decent sinners in Gehenna itself ;
and hangmen will continue to “ deter ” the
ethical outcast whose instinctive propensity to
crime is to him what the poison-fang is to the
cobra di capello—and all for what ? Simply
that we may delude ourselves with the idle
fancy that blood can be atoned for by blood,
and that death can be made more fearsome by
much company.

Let us be logical in this as in other matters.
We kill a noxious reptile simply because it is
noxious. We waste no sympathy and no senti-
ment, one way or the other, over the scorpion
which we crush beneath the heel of our boot.
We do not call a shark names, or urge him to
repentance, before we drive a harpoon into his
carcase. If a man is mad we confine him in an
asylum, but we do not insult him for losing his
reason. So let it be with those whom society
determines to kill for its own safety. Only
honesty and not cant is demanded. If Williams
is so constituted that other men are unable to
live with him without danger to their lives,
then, in the name of logic, face the issue in all
its integrity ; but do not let us hurl childish
fury at a man who is as much an irresponsible
production of natural forces as Mount Vesuvius,
whose crater can no more be extinguished by
pouring down it buckets of water than crime
can be suppressed by the indulgence of rhetorical
rhodomontade.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Weakness of Law.
The case of E. S. Smithurst, a Muclgee
(N.S.W.) journalist, who recently went bank-
rupt under a strange combination of ill-fortune,
is an eloquent example of the weakness of the
civil law of Australia. Mr. Smithurst, some
time ago, bought the Mudgee Independent
from Messrs. Richards and Cohen for £2600,
the sellers being bound by an elaborate, cast-
iron, legal document not to carry on or engage
in any newspaper business, either directly or in-
directly, within 60 miles of Mudgee for a period
of three years, under a penalty of £lOOO.
Shortly after this agreement was entered into
the sellers, according to Smithurst’s evidence,
blandly requested that the buyer should give
them, gratis, a share in the paper which he had
already bought and paid for, failing which they
promised to start a rival journal in defiance of
the bond. Their request being refused, the
new paper was started ; it bore the imprint of
one Charles Knight as the proprietor, but the
evidence of the connection of Cohen and Co.
with the venture was so conclusive that the
Equity Court promptly granted an interim
injunction against them. Of this no notice
whatsoever was taken ; the attitude of
the two defendants amounted practically
to a declaration that the Equity Court
didn’t matter at all. Some few days later
Equity Judse Owen granted a second injunction
endorsed with a notice that the defendants ren-
dered themselves liable to be sent to gaol if
they disregarded it. This second legal docu-
ment also excited in their minds just as much
awe as a piece of brown wrapping-paper; the
two individuals aimed at went placidly on their
way and the Equity Court took the affront in a
Christian spirit. 'Smithurst presently drew
the Law’s attention to the manner in which its
mandate was being disregarded, and, instead of
enforcing its two previous injunctions, it gently
told him to apply for a third one. Injunctions
are expensive, but plaintiff, who was already
nearly insolvent through applying for useless
legal documents, obtained at considerable ex-
pense a third piece of paper to the same effect
as the other two. Along with it a warrant was
issued for the defendants’ arrest in case they
disobeyed, but as the document was not allowed
to be put in force unless they “ repeated their
offence ” it was just as useful as if the Court
had issued a bow and arrow, or a piccp of green
cheese, or any other extraneous substance. The
defendants only smiled a peaceful smile at the
third injunction ; and when the plaintiff re-
quested that the warrant should be executed
against them, it was suggested in a perfectly
friendly manner that perhaps he had better
proceed in the customary manner and obtain
some more injunction. He would probably
have done so—-in fact he might have got several
more injunctions—but just at this stage his
funds ran out, and he became insolvent. At
latest dates the two defendants, despite three
injunctions and a warrant, were still prosper-
ing. The man to whom the Equity Court gave
its unqualified support is bankrupt and penni-
less, and the individuals whom the Court
started out to suppress arc booming along
cheerfully. Possibly, if Smithurst had applied,
in the name of Cohen and Richards, for a
legal prohibition against himself, it might have
been a more successful experiment; that is to
say he might have prospered, while Cohen and
Co. went bung instead. An injunction and an
old Waterloo mnsket appear to be very much
alike ; it is safer to stand in front of either of
them, than behind.
Breeclies-Pocket Christianity.
Rev. Dr. White, Moderator of the New South
Wales Presbyterian General Assembly, is a
well-fed, thoroughly satisfied, able-bodied
Christian who has evidently forgotten all that
he ever read about Christ. His theories, as
reported, are squared to support the rich pew-
renters and the mammon-loaded lights of the
Kirk who while away their week-days finessing
with the world and make long prayers on Saw-
baths. Says Pastor White :
Man brings nothing into the world with him but th e
obligation to obey, without question and without hesita'
tion.
Obey whom? Other men, of course. Then
these other men were born with something more
than “ the obligation to obey ? ” And White
is one of these other men, of course. This is
the arrogant domination which all Tories and
bigoted hierarchs assume to themselves. White
asserts that suffering humanity’s only chance is
to change its own attitude with respect to
existing laws. In other words, it is to accept
penury, exactions, extortions, persecutions, in-
justice, and even stripes, with humble thank-
fulness, with a meek confession that all these
tribulations are deserved, and with a glorifying
attestation that all existing evils are for the
best. More of White’s political ethics are :
Neither has popular government its foundation in what
might be called contributory rights. . . . The fact
that a man contributes towards the support of a State
gives him no right to a voice in the management of it's
affairs.
In other words, the fact that White contributes
towards the support of the State gives him no
right to take a hand in the management of the
State, still less does it give him a right to dic-
tate to others whether they shall interfere with
the State or not. Rut that isn’t what he means.
White’s idea is a theocracy, with W hite and
his co-thinkers to interpret the Theos. In
short, White goes in for a Despotism,
apparently on his own chosen argument
that the universe is a Despotism, and that God
is the governing despot, and therefore White,
as an assistant-GoD, should also be a despot.
Moreover, says this soul-slaughtering autocrat
of humanity :
Whatever may be the cause of pauperism, it is neces-
sary in a state of trial and preparation.
Mr. White repudiates the idea that Chris-
tians of “moral nerve” have any “sickly
sentimentality” about poor people or their
sufferings, “much less does he deplore or
lament their existence,” but rather rejoices
in it as a “field wherein to exercise and
develope and perfect his gifts and graces.”
The poor, argues this man of microscro-
pic “gifts and graces,” are born for the
very purpose of being “hewers of wood and
drawers of water,” in which fascinating occu-
pations they should “ find their chief satisfac-
tion and enjoyment.” If they don’t, they may
take it on the authority of Pastor White that
they are “ fighting against God.” Until
Moderator White spoke, last week, it would
generally have been considered impossible that
this enlightened time was graced by any one
man so hopelessly crazed with bigotry.

Amidst the shrieks of horror and indignation
excited by ’orrid details of the “Williams”
case, the still, small voice of common sense, re-
marking in a casual way that the principal was
a homicidal maniac, is seldom heard. The
world is already exulting over the certain
strangulation of Mr. Deeming (although its joy
is tempered by the sad reflection that he can't
be hanged several times over), and nobody
makes any allowance for ‘ ‘ the strange, fixed
stare,” the reckless braggadacio, and gratuitous
lying which, in the uncriminal human being,
are accepted as evidences of a mind diseased.
Deeming brings back to memory an old-time
comic song, entitled “ The Mad Butcher.” His
madness seems such a small matter as compared
with the enormity of his slaughterings that it is
not thought worth consideration, and the police
have strong personal objections to an enquiry
into the history of the Deeming family, which
might possibly lead to the discovery of several
uncles and aunts in lunatic asylums. Enough
for the purposes of justice that several of the
miserable wretch’s wives and offspring are being
discovered under hearthstones. Yet the very
motive of his crimes recommends Deeming to
the kind consideration of the medical faculty.
A man who slays a sequence of wives in order
that he can marry a fresh lot must be hopelessly
insane.
As an explanation of the absurdly light sentence
passed upon G. N. Taylor, it was, in the first
instance, alleged that Judge Hodges expected
other charges to be brought against the for-
tunate malefactor. Even if such were the case
the »“ emotion ” displayed by his Honor, and
the sympathetic manner in which he referred to
the prisoner’s painful position and bruised
“conscience,” have still to be accounted for.
Taylor’s career, from the time when he made
his first rise in life by failing for 4£d. in the £,
offers no evidence of the man having possessed a
conscience. Judge Hodges knew very little
about Taylor, apparently, was not even aware,
perhaps, that he had misappropriated £IOO,(KX>
in addition to the “valueless pieces of paper ”
that got him into trouble. But, by the same
token, the soft-hearted Justice couldn’t have
known that Taylor had a conscience, and why
he should take that article for granted for no
better reason than that the prisoner belonged
to the silk-hat brigade is a legal mystery.
Judge Hodges laid stress upon the fact that
he didn’t consider solitary confinement neces-
sary for a penitent gentleman like Taylor. A
list of the cases in which the same Judge has
ordered “ solitary ” would be interesting.
The democratic party, both in Victoria and
South Australia, is getting ready for the
approaching election in a headlong, bull-headed
manner which promises disaster. Every pro-
gressive league and democratic league and
labour league and socialist organisation is busy
nominating its own candidates with a hopeless
disregard of everybody save itself. Every
“ prominent man,” good, bad, and indifferent —
it doesn’t matter so long as he is “ prominent ”
—is apparently going to contest some electorate
or other, generally a city or suburban one.
Eur every constituency in the vicinity
of Melbourne there promises to be
half-a-dozen assorted democrats in the
field, while the remote country electorates
are being neglected. Not a single individual
of any note in connection with the progressive
party shows the slightest sign of standing out
and devoting himself to the work of organisa-
tion—which is far more important than the
mere business of getting into Parliament. The
old Conservative party, when it has a super-
fluity of candidates, and is likely to lose
through the splitting of the property-vote,
either persuades or pays the least promising
competitors to stand out—generally it has to
pay. The democratic party, being short of
money, can’t pay, and unless its super-
fluous candidates will retire from purely
disinterested motives they must all go to the
poll and the results will inevitably prove disas-
trous. And so far, unfortunately, none of the
objectionable candidates —the ones whose sole
recommendation is their powers of gas and voci-
feration—show any sign of retiring either from
disinterested or any other motives. The chief
hope of the party seems to be that its good men
will stand out and give the blatherskite section
and the persons who obtrusively spell God
with a small “ g” a fair chance —and even that
isn’t much of a hope when it is intelligently
considered.

Dipsomania is now recognised as a disease. It
is a misfortune that requires medical treatment
as assuredly as does epilepsy. A dipsomaniac
is intermittently as helpless as an epileptic.
Some savant has summarised his opinions on
alcoholic weaklings somewhat in this wise : —A
dipsomaniac is not a drunkard. A drunkard
will drink whenever, and as often as he can
get liquor ; a dipsomaniac will only drink when
his ailment is upon him. Dipsomania most
probably comes within the category of brain-
diseases. Like all other brain-diseases, its
origin, phases, and possibility of being com-
pletely eradicated, are yet matters of small
knowledge—and often of darkest ignorance—
with modern medical science. Hospitals for
inebriates have, however, been established in
most parts of the civilised world with notable
success. Such institutions combine humani-
tarianism with common - sense. There is
not living a dipsomaniac who would not
gladly surrender himself to their con-
trol during his dangerous periods. As for
the self-elected drunkard, gaol is the only
institution that can hold him back from
his beloved bestiality. A movement is- afoot
in Sydney —and not a day too soon—to estab-
lish at Gordon a “Cottage Home for Male
Inebriates.” The address of the honorary
director is 9 Princes-street, Dawes Point, Syd-
ney. The Bulletin recommends this move-
ment to public support, and will take charge of,
and duly forward to the promoters, any sub-
scriptions .which sympathisers may choose to
entrust to its temporary custody. A fund is,
of course, needed to initiate the scheme, but,
afterwards, the hospital should be to a large
extent self-supporting.

The Sydney Daily Telegraph welcomes with
both hands the issue of a cheap edition of “A Plea
for Liberty,” a compilation of arguments for
the perpetuation of wage-slavery—the writers
misname the thing, “Individualistic Liberty”
—and is so eager to floor the N.S.W. Labour-
party and Socialists generally with the volume,
that it doesn’t stop to read it. The reviewer
glared on the title-page, and, instantly infected
by his Single-taxer’s lust for the blood of the
Socialists, proceeded to stab ’em with quota-
tions from Herbert Spencer, who writes
the introductory chapter. Why didn’t the
D.T. quote the reference on page 138 to
Henry George (erstwhile its god) as an “ in-
coherent Freetrader ”? Why didn’t it chuckle
over the denunciations on another page of
George’s “ d priori vapourings ” ? Why didn’t
it quote the foot-note on page 29, which iden-
tifies no inconsiderable portion of George’s
writings as socialistic, and the allusion (also on
page 138) to “ the decisive rebuff” Australians
gave George? And why didn’t it—it never
faces a problem raised by democracy fairly and
squarely—inform its readers that ‘ ‘ A Plea for
Liberty ” is merely a plea for Anarchy ? Why ?
Because the D.T.’s logic is only that of the
capitalists’ ledger.

Thus Professor Jenks, ex-Law Lecturer to
Melbourne University on “ Federation,” in his
“ Government of Victoria ” :
Every community contains many persons whose import-
ance and possible emoluments may be lessened by any
surrender of its independence. Those who are responsible
for a particular policy fear for its continuance under the
new regime. Those who are now supreme may, after
union has come, be subordinate. The gain of the com-
munity may be their personal loss. So long as the com-
munity is apathetic, the influence of these men is
naturally great. And the community is busy about other
things, and prefers to shut its eyes to dangers ahead until
an appeal to its physical fears arouses its attention. Then
if the danger is vivid enough the community insists on
the obstacles being removed. If the French fleet were
once to strike a successful blow against the English on
the great ocean highways, the Federal Union of Aus-
tralia would be accomplished in three months. If no
such event happens, it may not be realised for 30 years.
The biggest tree in Maoriland is a kauri

of 45 feet 30 feet from the ground, and is 80 feet

The very latest —and truest—yarn about
Edward Blueskin Iloyce : “Toddy ” found a man
the other night lying in a Melbourne drain. A
crowd gathered, as Teddy proceeded to lift up the
unknown, and they said : “Oh, it’s only another
drunk.” “ Gentlemen,” protested Blueskin, “this
man is not drunk ; I’ve been a medical student,
and I know this is epilepsy. Now what man
present will put in a shilling with me for
a cab, and I’ll take him to the hospital?”
But as the Good Samaritan of burlesque beauti-
fully put it, “ they all went away at once.” So
Teddy paid the cab-fare, and lifted his charge
into the presence of one of the omniscient medicoes
at the hospital. “ H’m, he’s drunk,” said the
latter. “ Sir,” replied Teddy, “ he is not drunk ;
I’ve been a medical student myself, and I know
this is epilepsy.” “Ah, you’re Mr. Koyce, are
you not?” “The same; but don't you forget
that this is epilepsy.” And it was. Teddy sums
up, “There’s no country in the world so cruel to
its wayfarers as this wonderful Australia.”


Alias?
“ Baron Swanston,” the man arrested in
West Australia on a charge of having, in Decem-
ber last, while masquerading under the name of
“Albert Williams” and several other aliases,
murdered his wife, Emily Lydia “Williams,”
whose mutilated body was found corded-up and
jammed in a bed of cement, and buried beneath a
hearthstone in an empty house in Windsor, Vic-
toria, on March 3, and who is also accused of
having, in August last, at Bainhill, Lancashire,
England, similarly butchered and buried a former
wife and-four children, is declared by the police
authorities to-be one Frederick Bailey Deeming, a
man of consistently evil reputation, who had pre-
yiously left behind him a trail sinister pretty well
all over, Australia (.with the exception, apparently,
of West Australia, “ Swauston’a ” refuge), Maori-
land, and South Africa.
Frederick Bailey Deeming was born near Lon-
don and was brought up to the plumbing and:gas-
fitting trade, but appears-to have been, at various
periods of his life, a shipls-steward and engineer.
He has been in Cape Colony, South, Africa, three
times, and is credited with having, on- the first
occasion,, pulled off a. gold robbery of 5000 sove-
reigns, and, on the second, with having obtained.
.£2000 by means of a mine-selling swindle and a,

“ Williams ” murdered at Windsor, Melbourne,
In ’Bl, Deeming married Mary, James, a Welsh
woriian, in Birkenhead, England, and in’B2 both
came' out in the Pam Plimsoli to Sydney. This
was the Mrs. Deeming found murdered with
her family at Rainhill. He then called himself
“ Bailey.” It is difficult to extract from the mass
of fable and utterly unreliable statements the
history of Deeming’s Australian movements. He
is known to have serve'd six weeks for larceny in
Darliiudiurst' Gaol, Sydney ; to have worked* for
John Danks, of Melbourne, and to have appeared
in several Victorian townships for awhile; to have
been employed by Williams Bros., of Rockhamp-
ton (Q.),-whom he robbed,, arid,while in whose
service he obtained <£2oo worth of credit from
Danks, after_ which he went insolvent and ske
daddled ; he is stated to have worked at Charters
Towers (N.Q.); where he married a fresh woman,
whom he soon abandoned : to have repeated the
mavriage-and-desertion trick at Mount Morgan
(Q.) under the name of Mollett; to have returned
to N.S.W., where he had a suspicious
fire, went insolvent, got 14 days’ imprisonment
for prevarication as a witness, and only escaped
gabl for fraudulent insolvency by “ bunking;” to
have turned up in Adelaide, S,A„ as “Ward,”
where he stole CO sovereigns from a room-
mate, and from whence he skiled. for his

the alias of “Levey,” He placed his wife
and family at Birkenhead. Then, as a pre-
tended wealthy Australian, named “ Lawson,” he
married a Miss Matheson, loading her with costly
jewellery, purchased by “ joey ” cheques, after-
wards skipping with all his wedding-presents to
Uruguay, S.A., where he was arrested and
returned to England to receive nine months’
imprisonment. . ...
No sooner was he out of gaol than, under the
name of “ MTlliams,” he started courting Emily
Lydia Mather, at Rainhill, Lancashire. Mrs.
Deeming insisted on residing at Rainhill, so
“Williams” chopped her up and planted her in
cement beneath a villa kite hen-floor, and went
red-handed to his next wedding. This was in
September last. Mr. and Mrs. “Williams”
honeymooned in South Africa, and returned to
Rainhill, where, so it is said, the man was wont
to dance gleefully on the kitchen floor which hid
his ghastly secret. They arrived in Melbourne
f^«r-n a,Ber ( , 1 on December 15, and
Williams rented the Windsor house now so
notorious. While in Melbourne, he adopted the
names “ Drewh," “ Willows,” “ Dobson,” “ Dim-
can,” and “ Dawson.”

It is stated that Kate Rounsefell gave up a

diamond-dazzler. In- wooing, “ Swanston,” like
Mephisto in “ Faust,” appears to have backed the
minerals against the vegetables—diamonds before
flowers. The girl, at any rate, was fascinated by

how, after he, in an evil hour, parted with it, he,

Numerous charges are made against, this Deem-
ing, who is accused of having committed crimes,
of all sorts in all sorts of places —murders not yeti
tracked, and countless polygamies, and eyen of
being “Jack the. Ripper.” Yet, if the one man
has only committed the Rainhill and Windsor
murders, all the rest of, his alleged offences would !
be mere underweights.

The accompanying portraits will be seen
to differ strikingly from each other. The portrait
taken in gaol might, popularly be supposed to be
the more correct, inasmuch as. the gaol artist had
no incentive to flatter the, sitter ; nevertheless, ii),,
our, opinion, the official photographer has dealt
with him tire more tenderly. The gaol record
gives the height of Deeming at sft. 41,in., and
chronicles that he was born at Liverpool in 1854,
and arrived in Australia per Cotopaxi in 1881.
His eyes are blue and his hair liadit-brown.
The laboured efforts of the Press to invest the
accused man with certain attractive attributes, as
a means of intensifying public interest, evoke the
ridicule of Jhose who knew Deeming, and who re-
member him only as a commonplace, pilfering,
cantankerous, flash and vulgar person, inordinately
showy and desirous of notoriety. This trait was

remarked in “ Williams” on the Kaiser Wilhelm
11., and in “Swanston ” on the steamer to W.A.,
both voyages being marked by noisy fables of
stolen belongings. Shortly after his Sydney in-
solvency, a gentleman met Deeming in a train and
asked him whether he had seen an advertisement
enquiring after him in the “ Personal ” column of
the S.M. Herald, to the effect that a lady had
died at Plymouth and left him a lot of money.
Deeming consequentially replied that he “knew
she would leave him the money,” and talked mar-
vellously big as to what he would do with it. The
advertisement was, it is said, inserted by Deeming
himself to satisfy his morbid craving for
notoriety.
On the Pam Plimsoli, in ’B2, Mrs. Deeming
passed as a single woman, and one of the Officers
was “sticking up to her.” On arrival in Sydney
she informed the bold mariner that she was already
married, and that “ one husband was enough for
her.” Prophetically true! Two of the four
children, murdered at Rainhill, were
born in Sydney, one at sea, and one in England.

The police theory is That Frederick
Bailey Deeming, Bailey, Mollett, Ward, Levey,
Lawson, Williams, Drown, Willows, Dobson,
Duncan, Dawson, and Swanston are one and the
same individual.
The whole case hinges on one question—ls
“Baron Swanston” the man who rented the
Windsor villa? Max Hirschfeldt, a fellow-
passenger by the ship, who has been sent to
Berth by the Victorian Government to identify
“Swanston” declares him to be the “Albert
Williams ” of the Kaiser Wilhelm XL, says
that he has lost three-stone in weight. “Swan-
ston” admits the recognition, but still declares his
innocence of the Windsor murder. His line of
defence is that he quarrelled with and left his
wife at the Federal Coffee Balace, on account of
her goings-on with another man. This is hardly
compatible with the fact that he still holds many
of her belongings. He defies the Melbourne
tradesmen to identify him, and asserts that “Mrs.
Williams ” was seen in Melbourne as late as 20th
December, the murder having been supposedly
committed on the 24th. The “ Williamses’ ’’ mar-
riage certificate has been found amongst his effects.
Accord ing to his own confession, he was an intending
bigamist, if not a murderer. He stood the unex-
pected appearance of Hirschfeldt with unmoved
equanimity. He “eats, smokes, and sleeps well,”
and “appears perfectly happy.”
A fellow-passenger says of “Mrs. Williams”
that she was “a, thoughtful, serious, solicitous,
ministering woman of 27,” and that “ a coarse
speech would have withered her like' am east
wind.”
What self-exculpating theory “ Williams ” will
put forward'for the Rainhill corpses that tell of the
murdfers of his-other wife and-children;. remains to
be seem.

Mias Watts-Phillips, in the character.of Ruth

The “Arabian Nights,’’ at
Sydney Criterion, gave place on Satur-
day last tq Tom Taylor and A.,W.
Dubourg’s three-act uompdy of “ New
Men arid Old Acres,” which afforded
an opportunity to Mr. Geo. W.
Anson to inaugurate a series of farewell
performances prior to his departure for another
and (alleged) better land. Mr. Anson’s
Bunter, “a self-made man,” is a richly
unctuoiis and financially ker-istian impersona-
tion, stuffed with misquotations of Holy Writ
and reeking with,the,monetary morality of the
>Stock Exchange; and. in make-up, dressing, and
oyery other conceivable detail, the ever-green
Ecdes sustained a reputation for artistic complete-
ness which has undergone the test of 200 nights of
banter fit the Court ,theatre, Ijondon. The
Samuel Brown of the present cast is Mr. E. Sass,
a frank, fearless and fatherly merchant from
Liverpool, whose well-tailored and athletic figure,
and carefully-trimmed beard and pointed mous-
tache, assist the belief that he is sustaining the
character of a French officer on a diplomatic
mission to, the Court of St. James, rather than
that of a mercantile millionaire of mortgaging
proclivities. Miss Annie Taylor upholds a con-
siderable section of popular delectation in the role
of Mrs. Bunter, with a versatile and altogether
wondrous wardrobe, and a unique vocabulary
inherited from her ancestress, Mrs. Malaprop.
Marmaduke Vavasour, Msq., of Cleve Abbey, in
white gaiters, is, in the person of Mr. Robert
Brough, duly and conjugally deferential to
the one brainy woman of the comedy
(Lady Matilda Vavasour), a character upheld bv
that princess of mothers-in-law, dowagers, and old
maids, Miss 10. R.omer. The acting of this lady
is artistic in the highest degree. Her conception
of the character is crisp and clean-cut to a nicety
and it is not too much to say that nothing better
in this line has ever been done on any Australian
stage. Mr. Chichester is a fairly adequate Bertie
Fitz-Urse, and Mr. Corlesse has surpassed his
average in the German mining - agent and
swindling financier, Berthold Blasenbalg ; or, as
ho is styled encouragingly by Bunter Anson
“ Blazey, old boy,” with much addition of mis-
applied Scriptural exhortation. The attorney
Seeker, is a dry brand of country lawyer, crisply
played by Mr. G. L. Gordon, and Mr. Findlay’s
Montmorency is an edition-de-luxe of plush-
covered servanthood. Miss Brenda Gibson plays
Fanny Bunter, and this part, with its gushing
raptures and fictitious sentimentalities, j g
altogether unsuited to a clever little actress whose
forte is rather in the quiet path of domestic
felicity and in the representation' of the “Sweet
Lavender ” type of heroine. In fact, Fanny
Bunter is about the one known part in modern
comedy that would have absolutely fulfilled all the
vocal and physical demands of Miss-Marie Fraser.
The present production.is noteworthy as affording
an opportunity to a London actress (Mrs.
Molyneux- —nee Harper) to make her Australian*
debut in the character of Lilian Vavasour, the
heiress of a vast deal of family pride
ancient traditions, and picturesque ruins of
the spotted Gothic variety. Mrs.. Molyneux
(a native of Maoriland, by the way) Jg.
tall, handsome, and graceful* with a sweet voice
strangely suggestive of Mrs. Brough’s, a fine stage
presence,, and a face capable of expressing a con-
siderable portion of the gamut of dramatic
emotion. From her entrance in the first act she-
was a favourite, and she gained hand over hand 1
upon the good graces of her audience, until* at* the-
fall of the drop,- everybody in. the house regarded*
her in. the light of an old stage acquaintance —and*
one can hardly say more for the success of a.
debut.

The Grand* Italian Opera Company at the
Sydney. Garrick, has contracted for another week's
supply of classic music, and fulfilled the conditions-
of illustrating a. line of Miltonls anent “ linked*
sweetness long drawn, out.” These Tuscan*,
artistes are. of a particularly active and energetic
variety, and pile vocal Pelion* upon instrumental.
Ossa with a persistency worthy the countrymen*,
of Julius Caesar* Last week no more than four
operas were presented, and 1 two were fresh pro-
ductions. The first of these was Donizettis grimt
and ghastly, albeit melodious, musical tragedy of.
“Luorezia Borgia,” with Signorina Guidotti ini
the title role, and Signor Vivalta* as Gennaro, her
tenor offspring. The character of Maffio Orsinij.
the contralto friend of the Venetian fisherman,,
was supported with a fair average of mezzo-
soprano success by Signorina Cavalleri, and*
the grandiose mightiness of Alfonso, the-
ducal potentate and velvet- clad poisoner of
Ferrara, was tremendously sung by. Signor Baldo
Travaglini, whose two magnificent* bass songs in*
the, second act were encored to the echo, as was-
also Signorina Cavalleri’s renderingof.“ll Segreto”'
in the final scene. The remainder of. the cast was
painfully English (or Australian), and the nasal*
and guttural Italian of these well-meaning voca-
lists sounded* for all the world like some variety
of a Woolloomooloo■ dialect, interspersed with*
fragments of* Chinese profanity. Mr. Hammill’s-
Gubetta was a peg above the average, but taking-
him all round the Australian is a worse Tuscan-
than he is an Imperial Britisher, anddiis voice is-
too often* excruciatingly suggestive of. the saw-
sharpening process. Signora Guidotti was not’-
exhilarating as the historical poisoner, and herr
singing of* Donizetti’s music was many degrees-
below par, while Signor Vilalta’s top-notes rasped**
their way through the auricular tissue with a**
brassy*energy, productive rather of headache than l *
{esthetic delight.. In fact, whatever of kudos
there was to be won in the recent production was 4
easily annexed by the ducal basso of Ferrara,
who, in.the person*of Signor Travaglini, looked-
every* inch a brigand land a gentleman.

On Friday last; .notwithstanding the* fero-
eity.of the weather, the Garrick was packed from**
topmost height to lowest deep * with an enthusi-
astic audience, foregathered in prospective"
enjoyment of FlOtow’s frothy and i melodious*
comedytopera of i“ Martha,” with Signora Cuttica’i
as the titled * hoyden, who played sad pranks-
with the heart and the house keeping of a
attired afterthedashion of aDresden-chinaimage;.
The opera in question is assumed to illustrate the-
customs and bostumes of a past generation, and to*
hold a musical mirror up to Richmond Fair in the;
days of good Queen Anne. As a sample off
ai’ehGeological research and historical accuracy, wr
presume.that Signor lorio would be the recipient
of flattering notices-at the hands of an unprejii* 1
diced Italian press, but he offended all sense off
artistic fidelity*by dressing a buck of the
Sir Tristan, in red plush, like a flunkey in one off
Thackeray’s novels. He wore a red wig, a mous---
tache and Dundreary, weepers, and he behaved*-
generally like a caricature of a Mayfair footman.
The impossible farmers, Lionel and Plnnket, were*
performed by Signori Cuttica and Sisco, with*
Signorina Ga'valleri as Nancy and Mr. James*
Hamm ill as the Mayor of Richmond. 1 Of course,*
the opera was a success—it could hardly be other-
wise with such a Lady Harriet as that of Signora *
Cuttica, but it is, nevertheless, a wearying con-
glomerate of antique fooling, and we were heartily l ,
glad when it subsided at an advanced hour. “La*.
Trayifita ” was revived on Saturday hist; the*
“ Barber of Seville ” afforded a benefit to Signor*
Sisco on Monday, and “ La. Sonnambula ”—the-
first of Bellini’s operas played by this company hr*

Cuttica as Amina. On Wednesday the first,’,
second and fourth acts of “II Trovatore” were ■

with, Charles Dickens.” The audience was a poor
one on the first night, but it was probably as large* ■
as the lecture deserved, for Mr. A. T. Dickons has
nothing to tell that the world is not already

“As in a Looking Glass” was produced
B t Melbourne Opera House on Saturday before a
“ representative ” and thick-headed audience. The
performance was made to seem a genuine success
by the applause that followed each curtain-fall,
applause born of a dull determination to admire
Mrs. Bernard-Beere, but it was evident all the
time that sassiety didn’t appreciate the best
points of a play which seldom appealed to the
Kvuipathies of the proletariat. Adapted and
much altered from the novel of the same name,
“ As in a Looking Glass ” is a series of episodes in
the Career of a fragile enigma. The heroine is
definitely announced as a divorcee, subject to the
blackmailing of her co-respondent, Captain
Jack Fontinbras, but the exact measure of
Lena Despard’s impropriety subsequent to her
coing through the court, is not set forth
by the text. She may be either a fashion-
able courtesan, or a fairly respectable adven-
turess. Anyway, she keeps her eye always
fixed on the main chance, and when she gets hold
of any oof, the villain wants his whack. A goody-
goody young Scotchman, evidently intended for
the Church, is Lena’s particular “ mark ” through-
out the piece. As early as the first act she tries
to lure this verdant Caledonian into a loan, but
with characteristic prudence he declines to take a
hint on the subject of her financial complications,
whereupon the lady plots to break off his engage-
ment with a guileless girl and marry his vast
property herself. The aforesaid fiancee is easily
cleared out of the road, also the villain, who
obtrudes himself upon the situation in quest of
moneyas usual, is stalled off for a time by the
interposition of a certain chief of the Russian
secret police, an omnipotent individual, who
somehow happens to adore the heroine. The
young Scotchman, having meanwhile inspired a
holy passion in his battered Lena (probably on
account of his ingenuous snuffle and former stingi-
ness), falls an easy victim to the enchantress.
They are just married when the villain turns up
again, before the chief secret policeman can arrest
him, and makes a scene which ends in his lady’s
frank confession to her husband that she is not
quite unspotted before the world. The young
man turns from his love, w'ho retires to the library
to die. Then the potential “ peeler ” expostulates
with the shattered bridegroom, telling him that
he has really won a prize in the matrimonial
lottery, and all would end happily (the villain
having departed in a pair of handcuffs) but for the
rash behaviour of Lena, who has taken Rough-on-
rats and expired in great agony before forgiveness
could arrive.

Mrs. Bernard Beere’s short, but decisive,
death-scene was the one palpable hit of her inter-
esting performance, yet even in her supreme
effort she fell short of her high reputation. Less
testhetic and angular than of yore, she seems less
charged with electricity and nervous power. Mrs.
Beere, at the present moment, is a great actress
in a weak state of health, and will perhaps be
critically judged by people whose judgment didn’t
attempt to struggle against the fascination of Sara
Bernhardt’s more vigorous personality. Her
acting is delightfully natural, however, and will
grow upon the public taste as good work always
must. It is a pity that Mrs. Beere makes her
first appearance in a character which doesn’t
play itself in the smallest degree, but requires the
constant assistance of all her strength and skill to
enable it to hold the sympathy of the house.
Herbert Standing, as Captain Jack Fontinbras,
is an even more imposing person than he used to
be, and the part fits his hard man-of-the-worldly
style like a glove. The old familiar full flavoured
French accent of Marius will warm the hearts of
many who remember him only in comic opera,
and had no idea that the versatile Mons. could
play a rather melodramatic character, like that of
the Chief of Police, with such excellent effect.
Mrs. Beere’s two principal supports are very wel-
come strangers. Elsewhere the new company
shows no particular ability. Miss Henrietta
Watson is satisfactory as a very soft virgin, and
Otho Stuart, as the young Scotchman, is pain-
fully suggestive of Miss Achurch’s Charrington.
In the matter of personal appearance and clothes
Otho is about as nice as Percy Lyndal, but his
priggishness is distinctly of the Charrington
pattern and very trying. Harold Russell is hope-
lessly absurd in a stupid character —the rest get
no chance to make any difference one way or
t’other. The play is handsomely mounted, and
Mrs. Beere’s costumes are things to be seen.

“Wilful Murder” was an instantaneous
triumph at the Alexandra, inasmuch as the Crime
on the Hearthstone occurred in the first act, and
the innocent man was discovered in a very com-
promising position long before nine o’clock. There
he stood, by a new-made grave in front of the
grate—blood upon his hands, a corpse at his feet,
a bucket of cement in the middle distance, and
the fatal hammer in the background. It looked
real bad for the unjustly suspected one, but he
came out all right in the long run, and the
Deeming of the piece had to pay forfeit to the
law. Further details of this horrible tragedy can
be included in our next, because “ Wilful Murder ”
is a drama destined' to catch on and prosper,
Dampier has mounted it with that end in view,
and the savage interest of the story is enhanced
by a quantity of new and original scenery. The
cement used in the play is reported to have come
fmm the place where the Windsor hero procured
his mixture.

“ Captain Swift,” at Melbourne Bijou, has
won the praises of the judicious, and promises to

adherents of the Bijou are especially broke just at
present. The wave of depression caught them all
m a lump and swept them into the background,
where they are probably retrenching and dream-
uigof their faded glories. All the same, “ Captain
owift” is doing his second week to satisfactory
business. Mrs. Brough has aged her representa-
tion of the guilty mother since the opening night,

The Melbourne Royal (otherwise “Aus-
tralian ”) Dramatic Company seems to have been
bounced into liquidation against the wishes of a
large number of shareholders, who are now alive
to the fact that other than press influences
were working for the annihilation of Coppin’s
enterprise. Had a poll been taken on the liquida-
tion question, it is tolerably certain that the
“ Noes ” would have silenced the malcontents by
a large majority. Instead of which, the manage-
ment remained passive whilst a handful of
possibly inspired growlers xnade arrangements to
carry the winding-up motion at their next little
meeting. And, when said motion was duly
rushed through, the directors threw up the sponge
forthwith, without making an effort on behalf of
the silent shareholders, who naturally expected
them to resist. Perhaps no other public company
with a fair prospect of success in the future was ever
thus easily snuffed out. The Royal management
had lost something under in six months,
two-thirds of the disaster being attributable to
their agent’s purchase of Laura Villiers and a
third-rate company. The importation of a fairly
capable crowd, in lieu of Miss Laura’s lot, would
have earned for the revived theatre a good name
and a decent profit on the half year. It is solely
on the strength, therefore, of a big initial blunder
(the result of blind trust in an agent whose
engagement has now expired) that this hasty
liquidation has been brought about. A huge
success for any new Melbourne theatrical venture
was impossible under present “depression” cir-
cumstances, but anyone can see that the case of
the Royal is far from hopeless. Apart from the
Villiers fiasco, the old theatre, which can cer-
tainty boast the best business “ stand ” in
the city, has been doing sufficiently well
to justify shareholders in holding on to their spec,
until times improve. With the retirement of
George Coppin the show is not necessarily bound
to collapse, in order that rival managers may
chuckle and the Age whoop for joy. Harwood is
just back again from Yurrup, loaded with the
latest dramatic lore, and if he were prepared to
wade in and take the management of affairs a
majority of shareholders in the A.D. Co. would
doubtless be glad to go for a recovery of their
money. If every Melbourne management had
decided to stand or fall by the past half-year’s
balance-sheet, which theatre wouldn’t be closing
its doors ?

T!k drama and the actor were popular. He noticed
that the actor not only shouted very loud, but kept on

keys. “Oh! don’t you know the reason of that, sir?
That’s to keep the men to their work. When he changes
his key, it’s to show that the limelight isn’t on him.’

dictation on the part of the Trades Hall. Shiels
proves historically that the single-vote question
“came to the Munro Government as it did to the
Shiels Government as a legacy from past Govern-
ments ” :
It was forced on to the Government by the question of
Federation. Plural voting was always considered an
excrescence upon the Constitution. The law of our Con-
stitution is that man, and not property, shall be repre-
sented.
Then Mr. Shiels went on to show that the Conser-
vative Government of 1873 —embracing such Tories
as J. G. Francis, Edward Langton (noV a dual-
votist!), Justices Stephen and Kerferd, Edward
Cohen, Alex. Fraser, and Robert Ramsay—pro-
posed a Single-vote Bill, which the Legislative
Assembly passed “without a single voice being
raised against it.” The Berry Government of 81
proposed two Single-vote Bills, one for the
Assembly and one for the Council. The Gillies-
Deakin Ministry included in its Electoral Reform
Bill clauses abolishing the plural-vote and insti-
tuting the single-vote. An amendment, limiting
the single-vote to one constituency, but permitting
property-owners to record a second vote in a fresh
* constituency, “ was defeated by an overwhelming
majority, and the single-vote was then passed
without a division.”

The thanks of the world are due to the N.S. W. managers
who write the mining reports, and to the papers that
print them. Of one mine it was said the other day that
“ the whip-horse having become lame a new one has been
obtained/' A mine with two whip-horses must be a big
thing. A horse-whip for the manager might also be
obtained. Another manager conceals nothing from the
public, as is shown by his report: “Am using cowhide
buckets in the winze and they are working well.” There
are some managers who would basely keep the cowbide
buckets dark and so keep down the price of scrip. There
are several mines passing through what the bosses
uniformly describe as “kindly rook,” which might do a
service some day by falling in. Dividends may be looked
for in a certain mine, for the manager has put his name
to a report stating that “the truck road has been laid
and is working smoothly.” It is all right when you have a
smooth truck road. “ Keeping the water down by one
man at the windlass ” may be rend as a neat compliment
to the windlassman or that the mine is not a deluge. A
certain manager having once reported that he had
“driven eleven feet towards the Broken Hill lode,” the
directors requested him to state how far the mine was
away from that great property whose lode they w'ere all
so anxious to strike. He innocently replied less than five
miles. This was too much. They removed the manager
instead of shifting the mine.
• * •
Hillgrove has a black-list of mines. The remark
made by a mining man, three years ago, that the payable
mines of the field could always be counted on the" fingers
of one hand, was prophetic. Baker’s Creek is a good
mine, spasmodic in dividends because of the difficulty of
keeping on the shoot of gold with so small a lode. Sun-
light is another good property with a big lode —and a
still bigger handicap, in the W’ay of a 10 per cent, grass
royalty to the owners. The Hopetoun is a payable mine,
of which the former price of the shares indicated great
expectations. Then come the mines which have passed
through great tribulation—Baker’s Creek, North and
South are dead, the former resurrected and again dying.
The Cosmopolitan died, was quickened into life and again
died. Some mines have many lives. Golden Gate,
Baker’s Creek Extended, North Eleanora, and others
whose very names have faded away, are all dead. Lady
Carrington and Garibaldi seem both approaching second
death. Hopetoun, South and North, Lady Hopetoun,
and other Hopetoun pups are sickening, and on the verge
of the grave. The Baker’s Creek Consolidated, seemingly
trying to live on reports. Why don’t they crush ?

A shareholder wants to know what has become
of the Ennybre Consols mine, New England? It has
fizzled out. Its history is brief. A mysteriously rich
trial-crushing in Sydney, consequent flotation (capital
£200,000), shares boomed, particularly in Adelaide, up to
12s. Thousands spent in plant, continuous newspaper-
puffing concerning rich developments during erection.
Plant completed, crushing commenced, big yield antici-
pated, Armidale shareholders delighted, plates “looking
well”—carrier-pigeons engaged to bring results. All
Armidale looking up skywards for pigeons. Crushing
“postponed.” Knowing ones get out. Finally, result
about an ounce ; manager blamed ; next crushing under
an ounce ; liquidation, plant sacrificed, new company;
short-lived. Mine abandoned, shares worthless.

The auctioneer who submits forfeited shares on
Fridays at Richardson and Wrench’s, Sydney, is, we are
convinced, not a lover of that commodity. The cold,
callous way in which he offers thousands of shares which
not long ago represented as many pounds, is enough to
draw tears from shareholders. “Is there any offer?” is
repeated until the secretary meekly offers a penny.
Nobody follows, and the reserve being twopence, they are
passed in onlv to re-appear at the next sale.

What has become of the bulk of the Australian,
and particularly of the N.S.W. “ mining experts?” Have
they returned to the avocations from which in the boom
they emerged ? They are not in gaol—although they have
ruined ten times more people, by means of misrepresenta-
tion, than all the building society directors already there.
Results demonstrate that the mining expert reported him-
self either a rogue or a fool. To illustrate : it was at all
times useless to issue a prospectus, unless the accompany-
ing report from the mining report indicated dividends.
Hundreds of prospectuses were so issued, hundreds of
properties were floated, and the expert’s recommenda-
tions carried out to the letter. Now, there are very few
dividend-paying mines in N.S.W., and no N.S.W. expert
ever reported on any of them ; therefore, we say the
experts have retired on a shockingly bad average. Had
they invested money on their own recommendations, they
would be all ruined men. That would be consoling. In
this they alone revealed expertness. They often escaped
liability by the honorarium of a paid-up interest, and
declined participation in contributing shares on principle.
« * «
The Bulletin foreshadows that the next mining
movement will be in the direction of hydraulic sluicing,
the real potentialities of which few people appear to
understand. True, tens of thousands have been wasted
in this direction. The three great requirements for this
system of mining are an everlasting abundance of water,
a certain get-away or tail race, and a little gold. Un-
doubtedly more money has been thrown away on account
of the first two, than because of the absence of gold.
You cannot shift with water hills of alluvial unless the
water can carry them elsewhere. Hydraulic sluicing
means the doing of everything by water and nothing by
hand.
# * #
In America to-day there are dividend-paying
sluicing companies whose wash does not return two grains
to the load, and in many cases tens of thousands have
been expended in bringing in the water. The banks of
the Shoalhaven River are supposed to be by far the
greatest alluvial deposit in Australia. Here men have
been ruined generally in attempting to bring water where
it would not run on-to the ground for which there was
insufficient get-away. By the light of their disastrous
results it is unfortunately judged. Some day it will be
worked on a system commensurate with its value,

Liars may be divided into three classes : liars,

After a couple of years’work, the Victory Co.,
of Charters Towers, have come across the celebrated
Brilliant reef. The Co. while proceeding to this con-
summation paid all expenses and also good dividends out
of the old Victory reef, to work which the company was
originally formed. In sinking on the underlie to con-
nect with the Brilliant Co.’s workings adjacent, 214 J tons
of stone were raised out of the shaft which has yielded
14920z5, melted gold, or about 7ozs, to the ton. This is
one of the biggest things in the mining history of
Queensland. It is recorded that the Victory Co. (50,000
shares at £1) was floated by Mr. C. J. Buckland, F.G.S.,
who lately came out from England chiefly for
the purpose of being present at the striking
of the Brilliant reef in Victory ground. The
Brilliant has been steadily paying 30s. per annum pet-
share on 50,000 (or £75,000 per annum) for the last couple
of years. The Victory, also, has now- a splendid prospect
ahead, and its shares have taken a big jump, both here
and in London, though they had long been comparatively
high in price, owing to the nearing prospect of getting
the Brilliant reef.
• # #
By the way, it was through Mr. Buckland’s
persistence and enterprise that the once-celebrated Sunny
Corner was developed as a silver-mine, in the face of great
opposition, when it had failed as a gold-mine. Mr.
Bnckland’s success in this direction (before the Barrier
had been heard of) was the first really big step in
Australian silver-mining.

In the bye-election for Nowlunga (S.A.), a

‘‘l cannot understand how Sir S. W.

Dear Bulletin,—W. O. Hodgkinson,
senior member for Bourke, N.Q., says that
“minerals are like women’s eyes—they sparkle,
and are powerful to attract, but very often de-
ceive.” He might have extended the parallel to
politicians’speeches. “ Queensland for the white-
man, One-man-one-vote, and a Great Republic
by-and-bye,” used to be W. O. Hodgkinson’s cry.
But look at him now ! an advocate of nigger-
labour ! Will he dare at next election to face the
Gulf music in store for him !
Queensland Hans vkd will be in great
request in the forthcoming “ Polynesian ” session
of (ho provincial legislature. Every sentiment
which Griffith can possibly utter in support of his
black slave measures will be promptly clinched
with a quotation from Griffith’s anti-slavery
speeches in the eighties. The various situations
will be charmingly ludicrous for the moment—but
wonderfully telling against the lona-Jides of the
Griffihvraith. How funny it would be if B. D.

John Davies, M.L.C., has compelled the
derelicts of humanity and (N.S.W.) politics to

He is far and away the best underground engineer
in the nominee Council. Two or three years ago,
when he sneaked back into that congregation of
capitalists “ without a stain on his character” he
found himself an Ishmad. He lived down the
displeasure of the wealthy mutes, and to-day,
politically speaking, his support in the Council is
worth the votes of twenty men in the Assembly to
Parkes.

W. B. Perceval, the excited youth who
has just been appointed Agent-General for Maori-

advices he had applied to the Imperial Govern-
rnent “to furnish a man-of-war at Sydney to
convey the Earl of Glasgow to Wellington.” if
the U.S.S. boats are not good enough for Glasgow
then that long, sad, murky Presbyterian had
better go across by raft. Perceval is already
going the way of other Agents-General; he was ‘a

now ; he will be a solemn Tory in a year’s time;

Ihe nobility and gentry of Toorak (Melb )
arc troubled in their minds-about the coming
election. Matthew Davies, knight, their old
member, is about to hide his diminished head in
private life, and they want to make sure of a
‘‘ worthy successor ”to that extinct volcano. At
a recent council of war the opulent Wolfe Fink
pointed out the dangers of too much competition
at the poll. What they had to fear, observed
the Fink, was that with two or more .jcntlc-
men contesting the election they might find
at the last moment that a Trades Hall candidate
would come forward. Even Toorak isn’t safe
these democratic times. As the district becomes
more thickly peopled it is a melancholy fact that
“ the electors are, many of them, owners of small
properties,” and people of that sort are not to be
relied upon. They may run in a real live radical,
on the revolting assumption that lie is a worthy
successor to a titled person like Davies.
G. IT. Wise, Directorial President of the
A.N. A., Vic., admits the future possibility of
“Australia one day becoming an independent
nation,”and thus expresses his feelings thereon:
If that day should ever come, and Oud (/rant that it be
a Ion;/ way off (I), we may still be able to say, “ God bless-
Great Britain and long lh*e the Queen.”
Certainly, independent Australia will be a free*
country, and anyone with a taste that way may
yell, “God bless Siberia, and long live the Czar
or “Cod save Satan, and may Gehenna endure-
for ever.” But the man who stands on a mast-
head as a patent Australian patriot, and High.
Cockalorum of an alleged National movement,,
and then hopes that National Independence may-
be “a lemg way off,” is a eunuch amongst his
kind, ana is no more an Australian at heart than
is any colonial Governor who comes out to
Australia as a bastard reflection of a Royalty
whose glimmer is obscured by the curvature of a
hemisphere.
The Melbourne Evening Standard cheer-
fully remarks that “ the industrious Japanese will
be a necessity in Australia if there is to be any
large development of our viticultural industry.”
The average daily paper, nowadays, when it
wants to boom a new industry, always starts by
remarking that it will be necessary to import
some foreign heathen or other to work it. If the
mining business is duM, tflere is a demand for
cheap Chinamen; when sugar gets low, the
Kanaka is the only person who can give it a fresh
start; if there is a weak, forlorn, broken-backed
feeling about the coal-trade, or the wine-trade, or
the silkworm industry, the Japanese, or the
Italian, or the Coolie is the only remedy. And
just here The Bulletin has a suggestion to make.
The evening newspaper industry is pretty weak in
Melbourne just now, and perhaps a large importa-
tion of Japanese editors and business managers
and cheap Chinese reporters would give it a fresh
start. Anyhow, if the only remedy for all other
branches of business depression is to sack the
white man and put Kanakas in his place, we don’t
see why the white pressman who recommends the
remedy shouldn’t have his own nostrum applied
to himself.
How Mrs. Grundy revolts at this last
revelation of noble Madame Bodichon’s liberality !
Miss Edwards tells, in February Fortnightly,
that Madame B. (then Miss Barbara Smith) spent
a day with George Eliot and George H. Lewes
shortly before they entered upon their unconven-
tional union. The great novelist that was-to-be
asked o nmsel of her friend. “'What right had I
to a. vise?” said Madame Bodiehon to Miss
Ed w< rd l “ I told her her own heart alone must
decide, and that, no matter what happened, I
would stand by her while I lived !” Magnificently
did she redeem her promise.
Dear Bulletin,— Reading your grim and
ghastly story of 12th inst., about the idiot girl
whom her rescuers found lying iu the. bush, in.
course of being eaten alive by ants, recalls to mind
another gruesome story (for which the Palmer
Chronicle was responsible, some years ago) :
“A. Nicholson informs us he came across a bull,
15 miles from the homestead, almost mad, as well
he might be, with the awful burden he had to
bear. It was the dead and putrid body of a baby
black, impaled on the horns of the beast. How
long it had been there is a,mystery, but it
ultimately dropped off. It is supposed that the
blacks surrounded the cattle, when the bull
charged, and in breaking away dashed through
the threatening circle, goring the child, and
bearing it away to a terrible death.” —F.
What People Say.
W. SIMMONS, ESQ., BENDIGO, (VIC.)
Writes, under date September 19, 1891 :
“ Dear Sir,- For the last four years 1 have
suffered great misery from nervous debility, com-
plicated with liver and kidney disease. My water
was scalding hot, and very scant and muddy. I
had sharp, shooting pains all over my body, was
very \yeary, always tired and languid, with no
appetite, and frequent attacks of vomiting and
headaches. I arose in a morning more tired than
when I went to bed, and was so constipated that
1 Lad to take the most violent cathartics. I cou-
su,ted doctors without number, and all without
benefit, until my wife persuaded me to use
Clements Tonic. Ihe first three bottles did not
seem to llave nil,cl ‘ effect . but after that I seemed
to get relief daily, and a three months’ course so
completely restored my health, that now I feel as
lf 1 had been born again or transplanted to an
entirely new sphere of existence. I was never so
well before, and feel as strong as a lion, and can
perform any reasonable amount of exertion with-
oufc batigue. You can easily understand how
grateful 1 am to your wonderlul remedy, for it is
wonderful that it should have cured my case,
which had baffleii the best medical skill these
colonies afford. Long live Clements’Tonic ! say
I; others »»«y doubt its value if they like. I
have proved it genuine.
• his case is similar to hundreds of others. The
patient consulted the doctors, who tried the usual
experiments, and each one adopted a different
treatment, not one being used long enough to
have any effect; finally, on a proper course of
Clements’ Tonic the patient recovered, as do all
others.

The name of E. W. Freeman, the grea fc

tralian Federation progresses, local students and
t'linhcrs will learn to appreciate Ins magnificent
fragment on Federal Government. I reenian was

that urbanity towards enquirers which Ins political

The death of Mrs. Ann Petrie, daughter
of Flinders, just cabled, removes the direct ink
between the present generation and that illus-
trious band of navigators who revealed to the
world Australia as we know it to-day. Her
decease relieves both the Victorian and New
South We’sh pension-lists of trifling annuities. As
an illustration of how even persons in the happiest
position for learning the details of historical
events may err, it may be mentioned that Mrs.
Petrie was a firm believer in the truth of the
pathetic story that Flinders’ book, containing the
record of his voyages and discoveries was issued
from the press the very day he died. Asa matter
of simple fact, the volume was issued fifteen days
before his death, and Mrs. Petrie herself uncon-
sciously supplied to the present writer the
evidence which enables him to make tins asser-
tion.

His lordship the Bishop sent one poun Uo b y
his brother —he had declined to tender aid dimn|
his life. Contrast this with the conduct of hne
old H. Tohnan Dwight, the second-hand book
seller of Melbourne. Dwight pnbhshed fdr th|
brother a work on Welsh Antiquities. I t
of Victoria subscribed pretty liberally, but th«tot.
subscriptions barely sufficed to pay for i ■»
and publishing. The author, an unweaned babe
in worldly matters, expected a tremendous popu ai
demand for the book, and week after week ''oul
steal quietly into Dwight’s and ask now t was

gentle old scholar chanced to let out one day that
he was depending mainly for returns from it to

author for them as he came in. I his went on toi
over a year till at last an assistant thoughtlessly
mentioned Dwight’s kindly deed to a customer,
who in his turn blabbed of it as a joke and so

£ (DfiAU Bulletin, —I forgot to tell you in
mv last, that in the early forties, when Harry
(now Sir Henry) Parkis was engaged at Reg'Ne-
ville, near Mulgoa. N.S.W., as speaking scarecrow
to “ shoohoo” and terrify cockatoos from the corn-
crops, his boss (the late Sir John Jamison) when
writing him a cheque for his month s screw [A.Z)
always spelled his name Parks ' against which
indignity the then humble bird-alarmist seems to
have made no protest. —H. J. Mac.
Another is added to the long list of jealous
murderers. William Stone, of Condobolm,
NS W loved Alice Anderson. So did Deor 0 c
Ryan. Miss Anderson favored Ryan, and went
out riding with him on St. Patricks Day. Sterne
ambushed for the pair, and, suddenly reveahn
himself, pointed a gun at the girl, whose horse
bolted and saved her life. Ryan dismounted and
laid hold of the gun, but, in an ensuing struggle,
was riddled with shot and died within two hours.
Stone, if caught, will be hanged, probably. But
hanging Stone, so long as the primal passion of
the human race remains the same, will deter no
wretch whose love goads him to frenzy.
Dear Bulletin, —If the Windsor murder
proves one thing more than another, it is that
“Conscience” is a moral disease, a mental
marasmus, an artificial psychological debility,
traceable to early training, and perhaps slightly
hereditary. It may be laid down as a broad rule
that a strong-fibred mind never owns a Conscience
until its owner is found out in some crime that
entails a severe punishment. there are some
minds so cheerfully balanced that they actually
forget altogether the crimes that they have com-
mitted, if those offences remain undetected, it
requires quite a forced effort of memory to recall
criminal commissions without some outside am.
Who has not felt this in a more or less mild way
at some time or other of his life? Time, undis-
turbed, is Lethe. Let memory be made to search
the unsavoury secrets of past personal history,
and every honest self-examiner will admit this
to his own mental tribunal, though no power
on earth may be able to make him con-
fess it publicly. This, of course, generally
for lesser offences than murder, but the
argument is effective for murders also; its com-
plementbeing only a question of degree. ihe
appalling nature of any crime is only haunting and
terrifying to the extent that the moral disease of
Conscience is present in the offender s mental
nature. Disguise the unpleasant fact how we
may, a murderer often eats as well, enjoys himself
as thoroughly, and sleeps as calmly, as the man
who “wouldn’t hurt a tty.” That is, so long as
he believes he is safe from public execration and a
penal doom. When he is caught, and when his
physical senses are confronted with a visible terror,
his physical nature betrays distraught symptoms.
Also when he is not quite secure from detection,
though he has not yet been caught; given absolute
security, and many men arc untrustworthy
monsters. Back-blocks life reveals this (especially
with niggers) every day, in the cases of men who
under civilised rule, are gentle, peaceable and
law-abiding. It is this common mental idiosyn-
crasy which makes the lash and capital punish-
ment both barbarous and inefficient. Until
detection becomes visibly probable, or actually
consummated, criminals are easy-minded and even
jaunty,—Yours, The D.
Baldness may be prevented, and a thick growth

The Royal Hotel, Bathurst, N.S. W., where
Swanston, the alleged murderer, put up, is the
noted old-time hostelry which, in Mrs. Black's
time, appeared at least in two novels and a hun-
dred police cases. The previous tenant before
present host Harley, was “Charley” Turner,
father of bowler Turner. A hundred years hence,
a cicerone will say to guests “doing’’the show-
places of Bathurst. “ ’Ere yer are, gents. ’Ere’s
where the Industrious Turner, ’im as wot murdered
seventeen women two hundred year ago, slept;
an’ ’ere’s where the notorious Swanston, the
cricketer, who bowled Grace, took ’is whisky !”

An exchange says that the Victorian
Government has rented 57 Andrew-street,
Windsor, the house in which “ Mrs. Williams ”
was murdered and bricked in. By the way, why
should the Victorian Government kill Deeming
in the event of his conviction ? Why shouldn’t
it, in the present depressed state of the revenue,
exhibit him, at half-a-crown a time, all over
Australasia and England? This would be far
more popular than cutting down the wages of the
Civil Service.

The Melbourne pressmen have made the local
Cathedral Hotel their headquarters : “ The nearer
the church the further from God.” Alleged mur-
derer Williams stayed there : the nearer the press
the further from publicity.

The Williams-Rounsefell affair demon-
strates for the millioneth time the absurd fashion
in which women run after any man supposed to
have money. It shows the defect in woman’s
education and opportunities—she is at present
totally dependent and has no chance except to
“ freeze on ” to a man.
# # *
At Yass, a man named Pickles was
arrested on suspicion of being the Windsor mur-
derer.—
What may have inspired a demon with the
idea of the Windsor fireplace murder very pro-
bably was the hazed recollection of that grisly
story by Wilkie Collins, entitled “ The Haunted
Hotel: a Tale of Modern Venice.” Therein a
woman —Wilkie was strong in producing female
monstrosities —poisoned her hubby (or paramour),
dismembered him, and buried the remains beneath
the hearthstone of an ancient palace on the
Adriatic, used at the time of the story as a modern
hotel. The mantelpiece was a marvel of horrible
ingenuity connected with the hearthstone. A
slight pressure on the occiput of one of the carya-
tides that supported it caused the stone to swing
aside and disclose the secret which a phantom
skull and bony fingers had vainly sought to tell
before to each guest of that queer bedchamber,
and the identification by a London dentist of the
artificial teeth in the victim’s skull “ gave away ”
the rest.

All the lynx-eyed official vigilance of
Darlinghurst prison is unable to keep out sen-
sational stories of successful villainy. Novels, in
the strict meaning of the term, are excluded, but
in serial form, as well as in short and pithy narra-
tive, they are accessible in such papers as
Cassell’s Saturday Journal and the Boys’ Own
Book, and many a crafty scoundrel has his educa-
tion improved by the perusal of “ How I Started
a Bank,” “The Glenmutehkin Railway: How I
got into It and how I got out of It,” and the
biographies of observant and philosophic thieves.

The Argus (whose cable-service is shared
by the S.M. Herald) “ did ” the Age badly over
the Windsor sensation It was smart of tho

prevaricator to hunt up the mother of Mrs.

When the case comes for trial, the counsel who

“You have been successful in many cases?”
“Yes.” “And you have also been unsuccessful

The Bulletin lately remarked on the fact
that on a certain occasion during the tour of
Sheffield’s team the English professionals did not
come out of the same gate on the cricket-ground
as the amateurs. This,unspeakably odious, not to
say contemptible, .custom is maintained down
South, where a well-known local professional (Jim
Phillips, of the M.C.C.) comes out of the stand-
gate, while the—haw—gentlemen come out by the
members’ pavilion. “I hate fashionable Vic-
torians,” wrote Francis Adams lately—“ they are

There is an unconscious touch of humour
in an “In Mernoriam ” advertisement about a
departed pugilist in a Melbourne paper last
week : —“ Oh, for a touch of that vanished hand!”
It recalls Frosty Face Fogo’s account of a
brotherly meeting between the Tipton Slasher
and Balloon, in a back bar. “ All of a suddent,
when they wuz by theirselyes, talking Quite
affectionate, we heerd a smashing of heverythink
like the Day of Judgment, and in five minutes
they wuz hamicably smoking their churchwarden

And here, by the way, is a queer aspect of

five shillings in letting the world, per medium of
the “leading ” daily, into the dead mans little

A certain widely-known Maoriland cele-

admission to the London Carlton Club. He was
to have come up for election just as the mail left,
but unfortunately certain sheriffs’ officers had
selected that very time to levy on the goods and
chattels in his flat. It was not known how this
circumstance would affect his election, but in the
Carlton it is hardly considered a qualification to

A certain Australian medico booked his
passage by a recent mail-steamer for a run
“Home.” Between him and a prominent com-
mission-agent in the same town were contra-
accounts— the agent owing the medico .£9O, and
having a set off of £OO ; balance in favour of the
doctor, £3O. They met by appointment and
arranged that the agent’s indebtedness should
stand over until the doctor’s return from England,
some two years hence. Just here is where the
fun comes in. As the steamer was leaving
Adelaide the medico was arrested by warrant, at
the instance of the commission-agent, for a debt
of £6O, and intending to leave the colonies, &c.,
&c. Needless to say, rather than lose his passage,
the doctor at once paid up, expenses, &c., added ;
but there are sultry, times ahead for that agent.

Christine Nilsson (writes a Bulletin

splendid reception malyre (or perhaps in conse-
quence of) the scandal. The Australian pnma-
donna lias grown coarse-looking and bids fair to
become a tolerably ugly middle-aged woman.
Her singing, however, is finer than ever.
The wife-killer, Williams, is booked for a rope.
But here’s a reflection that tickles—
How Justice, stern lady, will turn up her nose
When they give her cold meat without pickles.
A GHASTLY HALLAD.
The tear stands gently in my eye.
I’m almost broken-hearted ;
No need to tell the reason why—
It is the “ dear departed.”
I’m sobered hy a grief profound.
All muffled is my wrath’s tone—
My love lies in the cruel ground,
She’s underneath the hearthstone.
Sing hey! the late-lamented,
I shall never see her more :
She but recently consented
To permit me to adore ;
And a patent I’ve invented
For the lady gone before—
She is decently cemented,
Though you smell her through the floor.
’Tis very sad, but such is life !
My woe I ought to smother,
And having lost a little wife
I mean to get another—
Another young and tender spouse
To call me lord and master —
So I’ve engaged an empty house
And ordered in the plaster.
Sing hey ! my name is Deeming,
And the women like my face.
The livelong day I’m scheming
To reduce the human race ;
Of a girl whose eyes are beaming
There will shortly be no trace —
1 shall leave her sweetly dreaming
Near the good old brick fireplace.
FAIR FORTY.
Yes, give us the woman of forty,
Whose waist is sufficiently neat—
Provided her face isn’t warty,
And she hasn’t gone wrong in the feet.
Then, the wealth of her amorous knowledge
Makes her better worth winning, by far,
Than the pink and white heiress from college,
Who routs when you smoke a cigar.
The woman at forty is pleasant,
And warm as a soft summer’s eve ;
With the skill of the past and the present
Her mesh she will placidly weave.
You may talk about girls being “clever ”
And all that a man can adore—
They have not the least show whatsoever
With the charmers of twenty years more.
Then give us the woman of forty,
Who is up to each dodge in the game;
There is something reposefully naughty
In the glance of the sweet, mellow dame'.-
■ When young they are fickle and flirty.
Either laughing, or feigning a rage ;
They are wiser and better at thirty—
But forty’s the dangerous age.

Many people after overcoming the dis-
inclination to make a will, worry for the rest of
their lives lest the lawyer who drew it, or the
nurse in their last illness, or the undertaker,
should steal it and make a fortune by selling it to
someone interested in its suppression. In S.A.
a law passed last year enables one to deposit his
will in the strong-room of the Supreme Court and
to get a receipt for it, but, up to date, only one
testator has taken advantage of the system. One
defect of the Act is that a lawyer is necessary as
a witness to the signature of the depositor of the
will—and that means a guinea.

When the R.M.S. Arcadia was in the Red

board and was drowned. “ The temporary gloom
cast over the vessel was agreeably dispelled in the
evening ” (explains Melbourne Standard) “when
a first-class musical and dramatic entertainment
was provided, and games incidental to life on a
steamer indulged in.” The fact is, passengers
can’t nurse a sorrow in the Red Sea. It’s too
dashed hot. Which reminds us that some of
those “ incidental games ” (we speak of the
average mail-steamer) are pretty warm. They
mostly consist of two girls taking it in turns to be
hugged by one of the “officers” in the darkness,
and the girl who says “Don’t!” first has to pay
forfeit. Poor Tuck couldn’t expect ’em to stop
playing at that for one night, simply because lie

“Bu rke’s Colonial Gentry” is not a reliable

The site of the new Sydney Hospital was,
wo are told, originally a Crown grant free of all
restrictions, to Mrs. John Blaxland, of Newing-
ton. on her arrival in 1807. In 1812, during her
husband’s absence in England as a witness on the
trial of Capt. Johnston, Mrs. Macquarie, seeing
the necessity there was for a general hospital, fixed
her mind on this spot, and by her appeals to the
benevolence of Mrs. Blaxland induced her to sur-
render it, at the same time offering her from the
Governor the “whole of Miller’s Point” as an
equivalent, or any other land she might choose, if
at the Crown’s disposal. She left the choice to
Mr. Blaxland on his return. He, however, had
many obstacles thrown in his way, and finally
accepted .£4OO for the splendid site on which he
intended building himself a house.

A warning to fat women :
A stout woman should not wear a tailor-made suit
fitting her figure closely; it brings out every pound of
tlesh for the benefit of lookers-on. She should not wear a
rosette at her belt, either at the back or front; it makes
her look thicker through. She should not wear a lace or
ribbon ruff about her neck, though a soft feather one is
permissible, if it has long ends. She should not wear a
short skirt; it gives her a queer, dumpy look, that is
especially undesirable. She should not wear her hair low
on (he neck ; it should he high, and arranged with great
smoothness, though it need not look oily. She should
not wear beads about her neck, nor many rings on her
fingers.

A Brooklyn (U.S.) reporter lias just been
gaoled for bigamy. He was a married man and
hard-up, so he endeavoured to improve his for-
tunes by mashing an heiress named Laura Thom.
When the wedding-day came, the reporter turned
up at the altar an hour and a half late, but he
soothed the awful rage of old man Thorn by a
variety of reasons and explanations, and the cere-
mony proceeded. The joyful pair went to live at
a fashionable hotel, but at 1 a.m. the bridegroom
mysteriously cleared out, taking the wedding-ring
with him. He mysteriously turned up again about
eight, and announced that he had been away on
urgent business. When the explosion came it trans-
pired that he had made one ring do duty for both
women. The cause of the delay on the wedding
morning was that the journalist had only one
shirt, and he sat at home eating “ an oyster fry ”
while his first wife ironed that solitary garment
so that he might go out in it and marry his second
wife. When he quitted the second wife at 1 a.m.
he rushed off to spend a few hours with his first
wife lest she should grow suspicious, and then he
fled back at eight to spend a little time with the
second wife for fear she shou’d realise the situa-
tion. During his brief but tempestuous career as
a bigamist he ran back and forward between the
two wives till his legs gave out, and he was
almost glad to be captured for the sake of getting
a rest.

A queer social development is the outcome
of the attitude of the R.C. Church towards the
divorce-law. You hear the R.C. members of the
Australian-Legislatures say that Roman Catholics

they do all the same—pleading afterwards, in two
cases, both of injured ladies, just brought under
The Bulletin’s notice, that “ though divorced by
the law, they are married in the sight of the
Church.” What will this sort of thing lead to?
Any man of the world can easily predict the
result, after considering that it will probably be a
less (because less sensational) offence for a legally-
divorced-but-Church-married man or woman to
indulge in contraband love than to boldly get
married again. The Tatter offence, of course, as it
amounts to openly flouting the Church and consti-
tutes, so to speak, a contempt of Church, carries

As a certain Sydney citizen was wending
his way home one rainy night he was accosted by
a woman in a nurse’s garb, apparently coming
from the hospital. She calmly asked for a share
of iiis umbrella. He complied. Reaching the
lady’s home, he was asked to come in and receive
mother’s thanks. Of course, he went in—of
course. Mother appeared in the form of a burly
ruffian, who demanded blackmail. The bully,
however, was sent out with a La Blanche swing
on the jaw, and the civil servant fled the shades of
Sin. Next morning, however, the bully came
round to the office of the C.S., charged him with
stealing jewellery from the helpless girl, and
wanted <£so not to lay an information. In the

found the trinkets. He handed them over to the

In Melbourne, these times, there is scarcely
a family likeness between the smiling, sympa-
thetic law for the well-backed favourite, and the
scowling, contemptuous law for the rough out-
sider. At Hawthorn Police Court, the other day,
the obsequious beaks sat with closed doors to hear
a case in which a lady, blessed with “earridge”
relatives, sued her husband for maintenance. An
arrangement to chuck out the impertinent news-
paper reporters was found to be impracticable, so
the case duly came to light, and disclosed no
colour of excuse for the magisterial conspiracy to
cover it up. Annie couldn’t get enough money
out of her husband to buy boots with, whilst that
lofty importer seemed to be addicted to stopping
out all night at the club, haw ! It was simply a
well-dressed sample of the ordinary matrimonial
row, with a strong conflict of evidence as to the
exact number of times that the importer had called
his missis “a liar.” In the end the case was
dismissed, whereupon the closed doors were
thrown open, and complainant rustled off again
in the blessed family coach. There is no moral to
this story, except that the Hawthorn magistrates
haven’t been requested to resign.

So maidens, in quest of a bean,
Are curling their lips with a “ tongey ” disdain,
And putting on airs from over the main—
For ’lis O ! to be English, you know.
They’ll mourn for the Duke at the forthcoming ball,
And sport a black ribbon of woe ;
The names of the nobles who carried the pall
They will probably lisp with a thoroughbred drawl—
That’s awfully English, you know.
The fashion has spread, since the cricketers came,
Of hating “colonial blow,”
And the new-season angel will “ think it a shame
That Australia played such a wearisome game ”
And beat the poor English, you know.
The dresses, my dear ! well, we mustn’t collapse
If we find them exceedingly low,
Nor blush to discover young Phyllis perhaps
Reduced to a skirt and a couple of straps
The latest in English, you know.
All fellers from “ home ” are delicious this year,
Our natives will not have a show ;
/ mean to get ready my bow and my spear
And capture the Johnnie who ventures too near,
For ’tis O!to be English, you know.
J.P.S.
THE SONG OF THE STAMPERS.
Again I hear them throbbing with a murmur like the sea,
When afar she holds her siege upon the shore,
The stampers are repeating low their melody to me,
The lullaby they sang me on the nights that are no
more.
1 doze before, the tent again, beneath the brooding gums,
The forty head are going at the Pilot ’cross the creek ;
There’s method in their music like the roll of martial
drums,
And the voices of old comrades through their mellow
measure speak.
The ghosts of voices long since dumb the battery’s mean-
ings bring
From out the grave of memory, and dreamily I hear
A tone that was forgotten and a song we never sing
Since Duncan missed the ladders in the fatal British
Peer.
Now they swell the solemn strophe. In the rhythm that
they beat
Upon the quartz another and a stranger meaning
seems—
’Tis the passing of an army with a myriad mailed feet,
Marching on for ever through the fairy realm of dreams.
It is softer now, sublimer, like the music of the spheres,
The organ tones seraphic from Immensity that roll,
To murmur inspiration in adoring poets’ ears,
Or woo the dainty Queen of Sleep and wed her to a
soul.
Now silence, harsh, oppressive, and a sense of something
wrong.
I start awake and listen, with a feeling ’kin to fright;
The boys are using language that is secular and strong.
The battery is “ hung up ” and they’ll sleep no more
to-night.

THE BEALS PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR tJSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple) and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and iio time
is Wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
how and then, a snug, dry corner alid a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading* Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple;
The Bobbix! Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, Winding attd guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is fulh
Eor all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work ; you may make a pretty lace
[ stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ; do large cording ; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
< accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating.— Tn our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

After keeping tlie Horfse waiting in order that he riiight

laboured speech in introducing the Trades Disputes Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Bill. Had he, as the children
say* slept all his senses atvay ?
However, in the same issue, under the heading of
“ Parliament,” the matter is thus referred to
The details relating to the proposed councils of concilia-

ART OF WAR.
By the aid of strategy you can get the enemy infn
a fog and lose him there. Of course it is not con
sidered strategy to find him again. But no matter
A vegetarian tract recently published imparts thp
cheerful intelligence that more people are kilKl
or disabled by u
EXCESSIVE EATING
than by drink. This is, doubtless, true. Take
the tramp for instance who lives principally on
suction, and see how hardy he is. His excuse for
drinking is that it aids digestion. You can eel
trichinosis from eating pork he tells vou ami
from ’ u
DRINKING beer.
About the only thing you can drink that is
really injurious to health is water. When you
move into a strange city you are generally advised
to ‘ look out for the water. ” The best way to
carry this instruction into execution is to inquire
for whisky at the threepenny bars.
NO SANE MAN,
however, will think of drinking St. Jacobs Oil be-
cause it is not a beverage for internal use. But if
he is troubled with neuralgia or rheumatism, or
is the possessor of
AN ACHING TOOTH,
a cold on the chest, or a sprained foot, reason will
dictate to him that an external remedy such as 8t
Jacobs Oil, which never fails to effect a speedy
and permanent cure, is worth J
A MILLION OF MONEY.
No other specific ever placed in the trade has
1 sucl) unprecedented success, a fact
which is verified by the numberless testimonials
received proclaiming its sterling value. It is
beyond doubt the
BEST DOMESTIC REMEDY
that can be kept in the house, whether the holne
be that of a merchant or the humble son of toil.
A MAGNIFICENT ILLUMINANT.
As the long nights approach heads of families
are called upon to consider what is the
best light for the home.
The electric light is not available, and even if it
were its installation in the great majority of
houses would be something out of the question.
GAS IS TOO EXPENSIVE,
as well as being dangerous and vile smelling at
times,- A good, cheap, portable light is un-
doubtedly the light to suit the masses.
LUXENE,
the new American Illuminant, commands the
attention of all. It is without doubt the light for
the people. Luxene gives out no smell or smoke
in burning, and is absolutely
PROOF AGAINST EXPLOSION,
and may be used in an ordinary kerosene lamp.
The enormous increased demand for Luxene since
its introduction into Australasia is the best
evidence of its popularity and utility. Ask your
storekeeper for
LUXENE, THE NEW ILLUMINANT,
and insist upon his supplying it. It needs only
to be shown and used to ensure a continuance of
its use.
HE WAS GRATEFUL.
Miners as a rule, are brave men, and one of
their strong points is a sense of gratitude. One of
the class, a bronzed, weather-beaten toiler, by
name Albert Tucker, walked one afternoon into
the head agency of the Waterbury Watch Com-
pany in Sydney, and demanded to be presented
to “the boss.” His wish being gratified, he pro-
ceeded to explain that “ he was only down for the
day,” but he had determined the first time he was
in Sydney to come along and state what he knew
about “the most wonderful of watches,” The
boss had reckoned himself blush proof, but the
string of etdogiums that Mr. Tucker let off with-
out taking breath brought up a ruddy glow never
before suspected to exist. “I bought a short-
wind Waterbury for 225. fid. some two years ago
from your agent at Trunkey,” he said. “Since
then I have worn it constantly above and below
ground, and in all temperatures, and the way it
has kept time almost to the second under all con-
ditions is a positive wonder. If I did not know
where to get another Waterbury, I would not take
.£8 for this one. I thought,” he concluded by
observing, “it was only right to come and tell
you, for it’s the best watch I ever saw or heard
tell of, and everybody ought to know about it.”
The latest developments in Waterburys are the
new and improved watches for ladies and gentle-
men, known respectively as the “N” and “K
series. These are procurable in nickel, sterling
silver, or rolled gold cases (with 15 years’
guarantee), and while being inexpensive are highly
artistic in appearance, and for reliability are
second to no other timekeeper in the world.

The largest attendance at any cricket-match in
the world was in Melbourne in January, during the four
d ys’ match, Australia v. England, when 75,000 people
paid. The highest one-day number was 23,000, which
was, however, beaten during the visit of Ivo Bligh’s team
in 1882. The world’s record was 30,000, at a match
played on Kensington Oval.

Lord Sheffield says that his team’s cricket-tour
has not resulted in a profit.

Strathmore’s dam, Ouida, by Yattendon —
Young Gulnare, was bought by an Auckland sport in the
very early eighties. She was a black of no particular
shape or make, and was put into the hands of Edward
Day to “train.” The mare never could gallop any-
how, hut Mr. Morriu saw how few Yattendons we had
and how good a strain it was —vide Yatterina, Chester,
Grand Flaneur, &c. —and bought her slabsided ladyship
for the stud. That he showed good judgment has been
well proved by the prices brought by her progeny, and
the rare excellence of this greatest of her sons, Strath-
more.

The death of that handsome delusion, Gatling,
grieves nobody except proprietor Gannon. The horse
never won a race and might have lived for another ten
years without improving his record. It w'as just this way
with Gatling. He might finish second in a field of ten,
takeaway the winner and run the race over again, and
Gatling would finish second to something else. So on
until each of the nine horses had beaten him. Had there
been nothing left for Gatling but to walk over the course
and take the slakes, lie would have dropped down dead
rather than pass the judge’s box.

Grace made a strange mistake in not putting
Briggs on to bowl in the Victorians’first innings, when
the wicket was dull and just suited to him. In the
second innings, although the pitch was then much more
lively, the little Lancashire lad took 5 for 33 runs. Briggs
comes from a damp soddened county, and on a wicket
that resembles his native heath he is still the most
dangerous howler the Britishers can turn on. Sharpe is
no good at all when the iron has gone out of the ground,
and will he quite a “passenger” in the Adelaide match
if there is soft weather about.
# # *
Altogether, last week’s match on the M.C.C.
ground gave a fair idea of the Britishers’ real “form.”
They won not by making a lot of runs, but because they
were able to get a number of moderate or unbrilliant
batsmen out at small expense. None of their representa-
tive sloggers played as freely and prettily as Bruce, and
the two "centurions” of the last N.S.W. match—Read
and Lehmann-were only good for three runs between
them.

An old Sydney gentleman, deaf enough to defy
Gabriel’s trumpet, was the other day fooling round a
pony, which suddenly let out with both heels and just
missed the pit of the ancient’s stomach—so small a dis-
tance that tlie old fellow felt the sharp fan of the air. To
him an onlooker—“ Obh I did he kick you very hard?”
“Kick me? ’ said the O.G. “ where?” The other pointed
t) the centre of the old fellow’s waistcoat. Whereupon
the O.G became very ill indeed, begged to be taken
inside, and sent for a doctor, w ho put him on gruel diet
and did a lot of other things until the old-’un was within
an ace of making his final will and testament. “But the
doctor pulled me through, after ail,” the old gent will
tell you ; “ my word, that Dosem is a clever fellow !”

A determined attack by a shark on a boat
occurred at Twofold, N.S.W., the other day. Th> boat, a
20-footer, had her centreboard lowered, and the occupants
were killing schnapper, when the craft was almost lifted
from the water, and looking out the fishers were horrified
to see a monster shark dart off some 20 feet from the
boat, and turning like a flash smash straight into her
again. Three times did be charge, and whilst one threw
out fish to the brute the others cut the line and got sail
on the boat, the shark following half way across the Bay,
On reaching shore the boat was hauled up, when it was
seen that the centreboard was bent, both garhoard
streaks cracked, and pieces cut out of the hardwood keel
by the shark’s teeth. The occupants of the boat surmise
that the centreboard being painted red attracted the
shark, and when he rose at it, the depth of the board
prevented his taking a bigger mouthful. Had the centre-
hoard been a few inches less in depth he must have torn
the garhoard streaks out.

A curious figure in Melbourne is the blind
brother of “ Mo.” Trahan, the well-known jock. He
walks about the city unattended, and, unless you look
closely at him, you would never imagine he was blind'.
He always walks very fast, and is generally sworn at for
running into people, who do not know his condition. He
is a regular attendant at race meetings, and bets pretty

The other day a very ricli Australian racing man
nominated a horse for a race, at Randwick. Ten servants
in a Sydney iiotel clubbed- together anti bought a sweep-
ticket and drew the horse referred to. One of them
approached the magnate and'asked him if they were going
to have a good run. “ Yes, ’he replied, “if you lay me
£400.” And they laid him the £4OO, did those servants,
and the rich man actually accepted that wager. It hap-
pened that the hors? didn’t start.

When Joe Thompson, Australia’s representative
bookmaker, was on his way to England, a certain youth
at the cabin-table used to outvie Joe in drawing the long
•how, whereat the Leviathan felt much aggrieved. On the
young man one day telling an extra-strong yarn, Thomp-
son chipped in—“ And you really saw the thing happen
yourself?” “I did.” replied the champion liar. “Well,”
»eturned Joseph, “if you say you saw it 1 suppose it’s
all right; but, s’help me hob, if I’d seen it myself I
wouldn’t have believed it.”

Some wonderful hitting was shown on Saturday
-at the Adelaide Oval, in the match South Adelaide v.
Norwoods. George Giffen twice knocked the ball clean
out of the ground for six. Lyons hit a fiver, and Walter
Giffen struck two fivers and one six. Thirty-three for
six hits takes a lot of beating.

One of the “ clever ’ crowd nearly got at one of
the big “ books ” pretty extensively, not many weeks ago.
The owner of a well-known horse strolled into Sydney
Tattersall’s, and entering into conversation with the book-
maker in question, informed him that his had no
show in a certain race, whereupon the “book,” in the
language of his craft, asked if he might consider the
horse “in the hag.” Receiving a favourable reply, he
commenced to pepper the nag, and laid £lOOO to £3O five
times over; it afterwards transpired the wagers were
taken in the interests of the owner. The horse did not
win, hut it was not the fault of the owner, who sent him
for all he was worth.
# # *
Some time since The Bulletin told of a pony-
owner who was “ badly left ” by his jockey, who mistook
the “office” given him, and did not “try,” although the
stable had a pot of money on the prad. Well, the same
owner started a pony at a suburban meeting, in a selling-
race, a few weeks ago, there being three started, No. 1,
owned by the unfortunate under notice ; No. 2, owned by
another clever crowd ; and No. 3, a rank outsider without
a 1000 to 1 stiow. The No. 1 division “stiffened” their
representative and hacked No. 2, whilst the No. 2 crowd
also did a hit of clever business by backing No. 1 and
“stiffening” No. 2. When No. 3, a veritable cripple,
won, the language used by both the clever divisions was
positively awful.

If George Hill means business with Marvel for
the Sydney Cup, he should shake hands with himself, for,
in the writer’s opinion, Marvel, with 9st. 91b., is the
easiest weighted horse in the race. A good many people
believe Marvel cannot race over a mile, but a horse that
has won the Waverley Handicap carrying lOst. 51b.-a
mile and three-quarters race—in 3inin. 6sec., has shown
himself to be something more than a miler. There is good
authority for stating that Marvel was never so well in his
life as at time of writing.

Hellings, the sixteen year old youngster who
recently won the 200 yards N.S.W. amateur swimming
contest, has the pluck essential to a great athlete, llel-
lings, until quite lately, used to steer crews from the Wool-
loomooloo Rowing Sheds. His home was across the Bay,
and it was a common evening incident for big Kennedy
to pose upon the balcony of the Sydney shed and signal
for Hellings who would respond by embarking upon a
plank and ferrying with one scull across the water.

Under the proposed Shiels’ reductions of
salaries, Victorian Cabinet Ministers will now
only receive from <£1295 to £1850 per annum
instead of from £1400 to £2000 a year. Members
of Parliament will get £277 10s. instead of £300.
“The second (the extra vote for “Thrift”)
proposal had to be sent back into the womb of
Conservatism to be re-born, and Mr. Service was
asked by the Argus to become a midwife to bring
Mr. L. L. Smith’s monstrosity into existence and
to shape its features. The Argus complained
that Mr. Service’s plan was both intelligible
and complete ; but the Argus plan was both un-
intelligible and incomplete. The public had to
read the Service mystery by the light of the
Argus botch.” —Premier Shiels, Vie.
Premier Shiels, of Victoria, has announced
his policy. Briefly stated, it consists of equalising
the finances this year, amending the land tax in
relation to “unimproved values ” next year, and
submitting a One-man-one-vote Bill the year
after. To equalise the finances Shiels proposes to
reduce salaries and expenses, and to increase
revenue in various ways. The salaries of Civil
Servants will be thus affected Non clerical up
to £120, clerical up to £150, and professional up
to £170 —not to be touched ; all salaries between
these sums and £300— 2h per cent reductions ;
all over £300— 7h per cent reductions. Only the
Governor’s and the Supreme Court Judges’
salaries are to be exempt. Train mileage is to be
reduced and various railway economies exercised.
The “tuppeny” country post is to be reverted
to; the stock-tax increased ; and land imposts
are to be levied on the unimproved capital value
of the soil. An income-tax is proposed on all in-
comes above £300 a year, differentiating between
incomes derived from land, or property, and
those acquired by industry or professional exer-
tion. Customs duties are to be increased on line.s
as yet necessarily unindicated. Notwithstanding
all monetary difficulties, Shiels hopes to spend 1|
millions sterling on railways during the next 18
months. He also promises : A Trades Disputes
Bill; a Bill to Abolish Bogus Banks and audits ;
the purchase of freehold lands with inscribed stock,
and the settlement thereon in small farms of time-
payment purchasers; a Government Labour
Bureau; continued butter bonuses ; and the re-
valuation of water-supply schemes.

Let it bo distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of an >/
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches* heart disease, incipient consumption-
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in,
eluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimveded.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World says:—“We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Australian Star says:—“lt is thoroughly purify-
ing. hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terras.

Be it known that for the purpose of obtaining from Dr. A, Wilford Hall the knowledge of his
hygienic discovery, and for his treatment of health and longevity, with the pamphlet unfolding the same,

This year’s French classe of recruits—the
twenty-first since the war—is the smallest known
s nee the new law came into force. This is due to
the enormous mortality among children caused by
the wide-spread distress of 1370-71, and, in Paris,
by the horrors of the siege.
A Melbourne weekly, having arisen from
the ruins of another paper which collapsed under
a very similar name, recommends itself to notice
in a painfully original way. The same old staff,
runs the announcement, will continue to speak
with the same old voice, in the same old words
that couldn’t find a satisfactory hearing in the
first instance.
There is a hard case up North named
Paddy M . One of the men in his employ, tired
of perpetual (suetless) salt-horse and water dough-
boys, said to him, “ I wish the missus would put
a bit of suet or fat in the dough-boys.” “ Listen
to that now, listen to that, Bridget,” exclaimed
Paddy, “its pasthry the blayguards are after
wanting.”
Providence recently sent a large numbe r
of disabled fish for the relief of the Melbourne
unemployed. It is supposed that the factories
around Footscray had been poisoning the Yarra
more than usual, and as the mullet, eels, &c. came
floating down atop of the stream, groaning in
th°ir agony, the inhabitants of Oollingwood
district netted the slippery sufferers in their hats
and umbrellas, and other household utensils, and
Mib'equently ate them “without feeling any ill
effects. ”
An American lady is Bow dierising the poet
Burns—eliminating from his verses all coarseness
and allusions to alcohol. As well rob professional
teetotal-apostles of their cold water. What
would they bo without cold-water ? Merely milk.
Fairplay (London) says that in Jive weeks
49 captains have died of yellow fever at Santos.
One ship sent ten hands to hospital, of whom
seven died. Another ship lost three captains in
three weeks. The chief cause of the fever is local
filth.
Williams, the woman-hacker, presented
his latest Bathurst (N.S.W.) fiancee with “ his
murdered wife’s rings,” and also wanted to give
the girl the dead woman’s clothes. The sort of
man who, while he keeps out of gaol, gets an extra
vote for “ Thrift.”
The Duke of Westminster, recently
enriched a London charity with £500 at one fell
swoop. The ducal “monkey” represented ten
thousand shillings paid by a like number of sight-
seers for admission to view the interior of his
ancestral home, Eaton Hall. This is a nice, easy
way of raising the wind for benevolence, but
Westminster might, by a little self-sacrifice,
double the amount of his alms-giving. He ought
to charge “two bob a nob” and include himself
in the spectacle. Everyone would pay a shilling
extra to see a duke worth a million a year silting
in state,
A BOON TO HUMANITY

Some Sydney speculators have just secured
a lease from the Queensland Government of a

“ The clergyman is selected for his office
while he is very young, and long before he has
had time or lias acquired sufficient intellectual
expansion to bo able to comprehend the nature
and scope of the great subject to which his life is
to be devoted. His mind is carefully trained to
believe the tenets of a particular church, to
defend and to teach them and them alone, and to
carry on ceaseless war against the opposing tenets
of other churches; and the fulfilment of these
narrow functions during the whole of his pro-
fessional life is attempted to be enforced by
sanctions highly penal in their personal, social,
and professional consequences. How can a mind
so trained, and harshly compelled to submit to
such discipline, exercise the commanding power of
a real teacher over the intellect, differently con-
stituted, ever otherwise occupied, and constantly
subject to influences so wholly diverse, of the
educated, thinking layman at this day? The
thoughts of the two men are not in unison ; there
is no intellectual sympathy, no common intellec-
tual interest between them in regard to a large
number of the topics and arguments which the
clergyman is constrained to select for his pulpit
utterances. ’’—George Higinbotham,

Dear Bulletin, — Re “T.’s” letter anent
non inquesting of body near Dandaloo or Gongol-
gon, we have not to go to such a back-bloeky
country for similar treatment of bush corpses.
Last year a party of revellers left Green’s gunyah,
one on horseback and several in a waggonette.
The horseman perished, and was found a few
miles off in a drawn-up position, but not drowned,
only dead. Two of the others got out of the
waggonette close to Brookong station and died—
not from drowning, as reported. Another, who was
in the vehicle was, with difficulty and whisky,
kept alive after being deposited at the station.
There was no inquest on any of the three. I have
written to the Minister for Justice and Mr.
Arthur Rae, M.L.A., pointing out that in a case
of mineral poisoning it is not even now too late to
call upon the analyst. Anyway, I want to know
how my special coroner is paid. I know he is
tremendously oppressed by the work of one-man-
several billets, because he has not time to answer
even business letters. —Yours, Hikam.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
/T>
>
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuxi-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA SOAP is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
CuticurA, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

H. GRAYSON CROSSLY General Manager.
A Golden Shanty.
The Captain of the Push.
A SYDNEY BALLAD OF THE “GORY BLEEDERS.”
As the night was falling (slowly) clown on city,
town and bush,
From a slum in Jones’ Alley sloped the Captain
of the Push ;
And he scowled towards the North, and he scowled
towards the South,
As he hooked his black forefingers in the corners
of his mouth.
Then his whistle, loud and shrill, woke the echoes
of the “ Rocks,”
And a dozen ghouls came sloping round the corners
of the blocks.
There was nought to rouse their anger; yet the
oath that each one swore,
Seemed less fit for publication than the one that
went before.
For they spoke the gutter language with the easy
flow that comes
Only to the man whose childhood knew the
brothels and the slums.
Then they spat in turns, and halted ; and the one
that came behind,
Spitting fiercely on the pavement, called on
Heav’n to strike him blind.
Let us first describe the captain, bottle-shouldered,
pale and thin,
For he was the beau-ideal of a Sydney larrikin ;
E’en his hat was most suggestive of the city where
we live,
With the gallows-tilt that no one, save a larrikin,
can give-;
And the coat, a little shorter than tho writer
would desire,
Showed a more or less uncertain portion of his
strange attire.
That which tailors know as “trousers”—known
by him as “ bloomin’ bags ”
Hanging loosely from his person, swept, with
tattered ends, the flags ;
And he had a pointed sternpost to the boots that
peeped below
(Which he laced up from tho centre of tho nail of
his great toe),
And he wore his shirt uncollar’d, and the tie
correctly wrong;
But I think his vest was shorter than should be in
one so long.
And the captain crooked his finger at a stranger
on the kerb,
Whom he qualified and hailed with an adjective
and verb,
And he begged the Gory Bleeders that they
wouldn’t interrupt
Till he gave an introduction—it was painfully
abrupt—
“ Here’s the bleedin’ push, me covey—here’s a
bastard from the bush !
Strike me dead, he wants to join us !” said the
captain of the push.
Said the stranger : “ I am nothing, save a bushy
and a dunce;
But I read about the Bleeders in the Weekly
Pander once :
Sitting lonely in the humpy when the wind began
to ‘ whoosh,’
How I longed to share the dangers and the
pleasures of the push.
Gosh ! I hate the sw'ells and good ’uns—l could
burn ’em in their beds ;
I am with you, if you’ll have me, and I’ll break
their blazing heads.”
“Now, look here,” exclaimed the captain to the
stranger from the bush,
“Now, look here—suppose a feller was to split
upon the push, ,
Would you lay for him and fetch him, even if the
traps were round ?
Would you lay him out and kick him to a jelly on
the ground ?
Would you jump upon the nameless—kill, or
cripple him, or both ?
Speak! or else I’ll- speak ! ” The stranger
answered, “My kerlonial oath ! ”
“Now, look here,” exclaimed the captain to the
stranger from the bush,
“ Now, look here—suppose the Bleeders let you
come and join the push,
Would you smash a bleedin’ bobby if you got the
blank alone?
Would you break a swell or Clnnkie -split his
garret with a stone?
Would you have a ‘ moll ’to keep yer—like to
swear off work for good ? ”
“Yes. my oath!” replied the stranger. “My
kerlonial oath ! I would ! ’’
“ Now, look here,” exclaimed the captain to that
stranger from the bush,
“ Now, look here—-before the Bleeders let yer
come and join the push,
You must prove that you’re a blazer—you must
prove that you have grit
Worthy of a Gory Bleeder—you must show your
form a bit— , , , „ , .
Take a rock and smash that winder ! and the
stranger, nothing loath,
Took the rock and -smash ! They only muttered,
“ My kerlonial oath !”
So they “swore” him in and found him sure of
aim and light of heel,
And his only fault, if any, lay in his excessive
He was good at throwing metal, but we chronicle
with pain . . .
That ho jumped upon a victim, damaging the
watch and chain,
Ere the Bleeders had secured them ; yet the
captain of the push
Swore a dozen oaths in favour of tho stianger
from the bush.
Late next morn’ the captain, rising, hoarse and
thirsty from his lair,
Called the newly-feather’d Bleeder, but the
stranger wasn’t there!
Quickly going thro’ the pockets o! his bleedin
bags he learn’d
That the stranger had been thro him for the stun
his “ moll ” had earned ;
And the “language” that he muttered I would
scarcely like to tell , , ,
(Stars ! and notes of exclamation !! blank and
dash—will do as well).
In tho night the captain’s signal woke the echoes
of the “Rocks, ’ . .
Brought tho Gory Bleeders sloping thro the
shadows of the blocks ;
And they swore the stranger s action was a blood-
escaping shame.
While they waited for the (nameless), but the
nameless never came.
And the Bleeders soon forgot him, but the captain
of the push
Still is “ laying ” round, in ballast, for tho name-
I leas “from tho bush.”
Sydney, March, ’92.

A FEW TESTIMONIALS SELECTED FROM THOUSANDS:
Nervous Weakness.
F. 0. Anstey, Esq., 199 Queen’s Gate, London, S.W.,
writes: “ Words fail to express my gratitude to you for
the benefit I have derived from the use of your Electro-
pathic Belt appliances, for now I feel like a new creature
and better than 1 have done for years. My nerves are
much better, and I have none of that languid feeling
which used to make my life a burden.”
“ Old Jack ” Dickinson.
NERVOUS EXHAUSTION FROM OVERWORK CURED.
“ Horatio House, Leeds, March 20, 1890.
“Dear Sir,—l am glad to inform you that the full power
Electropathic Belt I procured from you last summer has
made a new man of me, my health being wonderfully
good compared to what it was before wearing this valuable
appliance, and I assure you I would not now be without
it if the cost were ten times more, as it enables me to get
through a vast amount of work in my business without
the least difficulty or feelings of exhaustion and prostra-
tion 1 previously experienced.
“ Wherever 1 go I always speak well of your treatment,
and wishing you every success.—Yours faithfully, .
“Old Jack Dickinson (Champion Turf Telegraphist).
Rheumatic Gout.
“8, Eton Grove, Lee, Kent, S.E., Nov. 27, 1889.
“Dear Sir-Some time since I purchased one of your
Electropathic Belts, as 1 had been suffering for some time
with Rheumatic Gout.
“ After a week the improvement in health began, and
continued, and I should be sorry to be without it now'.
“ Geo. Franklin Chambers."
Major Pakeniiam, Longstone House, Armagh, writes:
“The Electropathic Belt has completely cured me of
rheumatic gout.”
A Barrister’s Opinion.
F. Arthur Sibly, Esq., Barrister-at-law, M.A., L.L.M.
(Cantab.), Writing from Haywardsfleld, Stonehouse, Glou-
cestershire, says:—“l must testify to the wonderful
effect of your' Electropathic Belt treatment. My vital
energy was so low that I was quite incapacitated for
work rt any kind. 1 have now regained all the vigour,
both of body and of mind, and am completely restored to
health."
Liver and Kidneys.
Charles Sewell, Esq., Cirencester, writes: “March
24 —You may like to hear that I have Worn one of your
Electropathic Belts with the most satisfactory results, for
whereas 1 used to be constantly laid up with liver attacks
and kidney disorders, I have been entirely free from such
ever since 1 began to Wear the Belt.”
A Clergyman’s Opinion.
DELIVERANCE FROM PERPETUAL PAIN.
The Rev. William John Edge, late Vicar of Holy
Trinity, Upper Tooting, S.W., writes:-” Having for some
three yens or more suffered from sciatica, which at
length became almost intolerable, I was advised to pur-
chase one of Mr. Harness’ full-power Electropathic Belts,
on the Kith of August last, which from that day forward
I have persistently worn without intermission except at
night. After three or four weeks the sciatica left me, and
not only has never returned, but I may say with truth
that, as far as my feelings are concerned, 1 am not con-
scious of the existence of a sciatic nerve ! This deliver-
ance from almost perpetual pain, which at times amounted
to torture, 1 cannot but ascribe to your Electropathic
Belt, and I feel bound thus to give public expression to
my gratitude.
Sciatica Cured.
From the Widow of a Medical Man who had suffered for
years from acute Sciatica.
“ 44, Upper Belgrave-road, Durdham Down,
“ Clifton, Bristol, Jan. t», 1890.
“ Dear Sir,—l am quite certain that it will gratify you
very much to know that the Electropathic Belt is doing
me good, and the improvement is most marked in the past
week. The pain is less severe at night, which I can assure
you is a great comfort, as I have for six months suffered
so dreadfully. I look upon you as being a great bene-
factor to the human race, and how clever you are. Please
accept my most grateful thanks, and believe me to remain
yours ever truly,

No. III.—The Heart-Breaking of Anstey’s
Bess.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
If ever there was a woman who had a
.splendid chance of settling herself in life, it was
Anstey’s Bess—otherwise Elizabeth Sandy, No.
24-175, per Arab (1). Not to say anything at all
of the proposals of lesser men —not even dwelling
particularly on the honour done her by Jorgen
Jorgenson, former Governor of Iceland and pre-
sent magistrate’s clerk at the neighbouring town-
ship of Oatlands, who would have wedded her
without (so he informed her) “a paper thrup-
penny”* of dower—when Mr. Thomas Anstey’s
free overseer, Franky Manning, laid his honest
heart and his hundred-acre grant, with all appur-
tenances thereon, at her feet, she was tendered an
exceptionally tine opportunity of making a match.
Nevertheless she refused.
“I am quite comfortable here, thank’ee, Mr.
Manning,” she said, “ an’ the master and mistress
are kind, an’ I’m desperate fond of the childer.
An’ I’m as happy as I want.”
“But you can be as happy as all this and be
your own mistress, too, Bess,” pleaded the stalwart
Manning. “Won’t ye think better of it? I’ll
treat ye kind !”
“ I don’t doubt that, Mr. Manning, an’ I don’t
say as it’s not a fine chance, but —it’s no use. I’ve
made up my mind to stay here till I die, or .”
She paused, as though she had already said too
much.
“ Or what, Bess?”
“Never mind !”
“Till ye get your freedom !”
“Yes, yes—my freedom!” But the exclama-
tion was hurried and confused. As well it'might
be, for the explanation was not true.
“But the master says as ye’ll not apply for
your ticket, Bess, and ye won’t get a ticket, much
less a pardon, without asking for it. Are ye too
happy here to ask for freedom ?”
“ That’s it, that’s it!”
“No, Bess, there’s something else I’m sure.
You’re not so happy but that freedom won’t make
ye happier, ’specially if ye get with freedom a
home of your own.”
“No, no! It’s no use, Mr. Manning. Besides,
why you ought to marry a free woman, not me—
a lag!”
“D the lag—saving your presence, Bess!
And even supposing Mr. Anstey couldn’t get
your pardon just for the asking for it, my love —
the love of a square man, though p’r’aps I say it
as shouldn’t, Bess —will clear your record as
though ye’d never been sent out.”
“Ah, that’s good of you to say it, Mr. Frank—•
but you wouldn’t like your—your childer to be
pointed out fora lag mother’s childer.”
Her wooer brought his great hand to his thigh
a resounding clap.
“ Who’d dare to raise a word against my wife?
I’m a free man—l’m rich now as men go—l’ll be
richer by-and-bye. No, none dare say that against
vour children if they were mine, too, Bess ! Don’t
be afraid of that, my dear ! Come, Bess, say
ye’ll have me, and I’ll beg Mr. Anstey to ask for
your pardon at once. lib’ll get it, sure. I’ve
been a good servant to him, and so have you,
Bess. Now, say yes !—there’s a good girl! ”
The woman, still comely and fresh-featured for
all her 36 years, with thick coils of reddish-brown
hair, deep - arching eyebrows and milk - white
teeth showing the self - respect so seldom re-
tained by the “assigned female,” bent her face
into her hands. The appeal stirred her, and her
whole being quivered with the struggle between
the craving to say “yes ” and the knowledge she
ought to say “ no.” The ration print-dress of the
convict-woman did not always cover the sensi-
bilities of the drab, though Governor Arthur
thought so.
Manning waited. He would not further harass
her by so much as a glance, so while she pondered
he gave a glance to the field adjacent to that in
which they were standing. Something there
attracted his attention. The ploughing-“ teams ”
were stationary, and instead of the creaking and
jingling of the gear, he heard angry voices in
excited threats. One voice sounded above the
rest, and as he distinguished it, he turned sharply
to her.
“Bess, I can’t wait any longer, now —though
there’s still time to say ‘ yes,’ dear. The men are
rowing again—wherever that young scoundrel
Davies is there’s bound to be trouble if I am not
by. I’ll come again to-night, Bess—unless” —he
paused to grasp the, hands which were now clasped
on her bosom—“unless it’s ‘yes ’ now, Bess? ”
It might have been into ears of stone that he
poured his words. Her hearing was intent for
another voice than his —that much he understood,
for there was straining in her eyes and in her atti-
tude, and the colour came and went in quick
rushes to and from her cheeks,
“Bess, Bess, what is the matter? What is it?
Are you ill?”
“ No —yes ! Oh, go away, Mr. Manning—an’
don’t talk to me of love while that, while that’s
there ! ” She threw out her hands as though to
push him away.
“ What d’ye mean ? While what’s there ? ”
“Go, oh, go! Don’t you see he —they are
fighting ! Go, do go—or mischief’ll be done, Mr.
Manning! ”
It was quite time for him to go. From the
adjoining paddock came cries of his name
mingled with bitter imprecations, and the group
of convicts reeled stormily. He rushed towards
the fence which separated the paddocks, and, as
he clambered over, looked back.
The woman was prostrate on the sward. He
could see the convulsive movements of her hands
as they clutched at the grass-tufts.
* * #
He could not go back to her, though he
troubled greatly, in his simple, strong fashion,
that he could not. The fight was proceeding, for
the combatants were so enraged that they did not
see his coming, and unless he interposed literally
with his whip of authority, the contest might end
in the infliction of serious injury, if not in murder.
“Stop, there —stop, Davies—New!” He cut
at the combatants with his lash of rawhide, and
struck them into silence and a sullen inactivity.
The ploughs at work were two, and, meeting
on parallel furrows, a dispute had occurred
between a man of each team. To each plough
were harnessed eight convicts of various ages and
statures. Beside Anstey, of Anstey-Barton, only
one settler —Bisdee —flagrantly defied the Sys-
tem’s economy by indulging in such weak ex-
travagance as to put eight men to a plough. Most
land-tillers holding assigned labour displayedj a
judicious regard for the methods most in favour
with the Authorities, and employed no more than
four. And the Ansteys and .the Bisdees were
equally opposed to the System in another respect
—each discountenanced the sharp-pointed goad
so generally used by the, other settlers. The
solitary instrument of persuasion permitted by
either gentleman was the strip of unmanned hide, •
and this solely on the ground that its use was
necessary to prevent the shirkers throwing the
strain of the draught on the willing workers.
“ What’s this all about ? ” demanded Manning. .
“You, Davies, again! Have you forgotten that
I said I’d have you up before Mr; Anstey if you
quarrelled again this week ? ”
Neither of the offenders answered, but Davies,
in response to the-special'enquiry from himself,
shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. _ He was ■
a youth apparently in his eighteenth or nineteenth
year, and, save for the scowl, evidently habitual,
on his face, would have been handsome.
“ Answer, I say ! ” repeated the Overseer.
“ Well, if you must know, that cur, New,
there, lied. That’s all. And ” a studied
impertinence was in his tone as he continued—
“ as I’m not an officer of the field police, or a free'
man, I didn’t believe in lying, and I hit him !”
“ That tongue of yours will get you into serious
mischief yet, Davies, if you don’t take care. But
that’s no answer to my question. What did New
say?”
“ Ask New himself —I decline to repeat a lie
even at second-hand. But ”
“ But what?”
“ I warn him that if he dare say to you, in my
hearing, even now, what he said before, I’ll strike
him again, even if you flog me the next moment!”
“ This is rank insubordination, and even Mr.:
Anstey himself wouldn’t pass it over. New, tell
me what you said. You needn’t care for the lad’s
threats.” . r
“ Care ! The fellow a wizened - featured, -•
stunted Londoner. Wot should I care for ’ini?
H’im as good as’im hany day. An’this his wot'
hi ses, sir ” , ’ ' '
“New?” The boy, Davies, threw into the
word at once both a challenge and a warning. ;
“ New !” mimicked the other. “That for you !”
He made a vulgar gesture as he spoke. “This
his wot hi ses, Mr. Mannin’—l axed ’im ’ow
many kisses ’e give to that ’ere Bess for all th’-
grub she brings ’ira. An’ then ’e ’its me, an’ hi
’its back !”
“What Bess—what woman?” cried Manning.
Rude and uncultivated as he was, he shrank from
the possibility that the name which fell so lightly,
from the wretch’s lips was that of the woman to
whom he had given his love.
“ Yy, Bess that’s hup to the ’omestead—Anstey’s
Bess, o’ course !”
Each “ team ” was harnessed in pairs by swin-
gle-trees, Davies, the “ off-leader ” of one, while
New was speaking, and while Manning and the'
cluster of convicts were intent upon that fellow’s
words, had stooped and unhooked the swivels
which held his own chains to the bar. A length of
nearly three feet of inch-links was thus loose in
his hand, save that one end was attached to the
leathern bazil which encircled his waist. Before
New could complete his jibe at the expense of
Anstey’s Bess, the lad had swung the unattached
iron into the tell-tale’s face.
Manning, momentarily staggered by the asso-
ciation of Bess’s name with this wastrel of the
convict-gang, was recalled to himself by the
assault. Although Davies had gathered the
length of chain once more in bis hands as if to
wield it again as a weapon, Manning rushed on
him, and, dropping his oWn whip, seized the
youth’s wrists. '
. “ I’ve put up with your conduct long enough,
Davies,” he exclaimed, “ but this is going too far.
Mr. Anstey shall know of this.”
• The boy made one ineffectual attempt to free
himself from that mighty grasp, and then, owning
the mastery, but still defiant, looked the Overseer
full in the face, and exclaimed: “A fig for
Anstey !■ A fig for you ! A fig for anybody and
everybody in this cursed country—a country of -
lags who ought to be free-men and of free-men ,
with the spirit of lags.” Then, as Manning, still
holding the lad’s wrists, called to take the hand-
cuffs from his, the Overseer’s pocket, he went on :
“ Oh, damn you, Manning—l’ll get even with you
for this ! I’ve sworn on the Lag’s Biblef I’ll do
for any man who forces the darbies on me !”
The bracelets snapped on the wrists through
which the blue veins were still visible beneath the
sunburnt tan.
* # #
The teams —one man short in each —
resumed their ploughing. Tragedies might bo
enacted, hearts might break in the process,
but Anstey’s grants had to be prepared for
the spring sowing and the autumn harvest.
Up and down, one ' working to , the east side
of the paddock, the other to the west, scoring
with the same furrows the chocolate earth and
their own hearts. No task so tore the naturesof con-
victs as that of hauling the plough. Much of their
work seared, but the flesh closed over the cicatrices
but the plough share cut a wound that rankled
for ever’, becahse the work was beasts’ work. Yet
Anstey’s plougli-“ teams” should have been happy
in knowing that,'though their work was that of
the lower animals, their fdbd was still that of the
man. An'stey was unlike C —who sleeps in
Melbourne: cemetery in' sure and certain dread of
a terrible resurrection, and under twelve hundred
pounds? worth of lying marble. C- , moved by
a sense of the appropriate, fed his plough-cattle
on oatmeal and water. “The fodder of beasts
for beasts’ work ” was. his maxim—and his grand-
daughter will be presented at Court this year.
< For two days the “ teams” worked each a man
short;: Then, the proper, allowance of draught was
renewed." Theniimber of eight was restored: Davies
and New came back. They had been into Oat-
lands. Davies was reticent with his fellow-cattle.
But New was discursive enough for both.
“ ’E was impideht to the beak, an’ jawed the
hoverseer, an’ ’e ses that ’e ’ud risk Jack Ketch
to ’av ’is go for Mannin’. An’ Mannin’, he only
larfs, an’ begs the beak to let ’im orf easy for a-
strikin’ me, an’ ’e never ses no word at all about
cheekin’ ’im, so the beak lets ’im orf with ten,
Vy he grew indignant at the prospect of the
probable increase in crime which would , follow
upon such an unusual instance of magisterial
leniency—“ that tain’t ho pun’shment at all! If
’e killed me, ’e’d ’av got orf altogether !”
Nevertheless, those ten strokes,’ lightly laid on
the back though they were, had stamped themselves
' indelibly on Davies’ features. And an old hand,
who for a generation had been enjoying the pro-
tection (tempered with discipline) of Government,
and who knew the convict nature well, prophesied
■ ill, because the lad never laughed now. There
was something taking about the boy—something
impressive, too, to a creature like this Michael

Ferris, who was servile always, from inclination
as much as from policy, in his haughty opposition
to authority.
And the old convict dreaded what might be.
This man was sent with a message to the home-
stead by Manning a week after Davies’ return
to the “ team.” And while waiting for the can of
tea which he was to carry to the field, the old
fellow took an opportunity of saying a word to
Bess. Anstey’s was ruled by Bess in all things,
edible and potable.
“ Mrs. Sandy, a word wi’ yer, mem, please, an’
’souse the liberty as I’m taking, mem, but the men
do say as wot yer—yer take an int’restljke in
young Eddie Davies ”
“ Oh ! ” cried Bess, taken off her guard by the
suddenness of the remark, “what is the matter
now—is he in more trouble ? ”
“Not yet, missus, but I’m afraid he will be
—he’s so sullen like, and broodin’. He never larfs.
An’ w’en fellers, espeshally younkers, go like that,
arter kissin’ of Madame Cat-o’-nine-tail—w’y,
mem, they’s go to the bad, slick ! ”
“ Oh, tell him not to brood—no, stay ! ” Then,
fearful she had revealed a feeling for the lad’s
welfare that needed either instant contradiction
or a further unfolding, she paused and looked
anxiously at the old transport. He read her
glance—and put his finger on his lips.
“I’m mum, mem —I do anything for the
younker as he gives me ’baccy w’en he has it, an’
I know as the stuff must come from you ! ”
“ Then—then tell him to keep awake to-night.”
The old man delivered the message ; and he was
loyal to his promise. He mentioned the circum-
stance to no one. But he would have been more
than human, if, when the “teams” were stabled
for the night in the huts by the home-paddock,
he too had not resolved to keep awake.
# # •
Six men to a hut— the Ansteys charac-
teristically so construed the official regulation
which required that in any apartment of smaller
dimensions than 12 feet by 12 feet there should
not be lodged more than 12 assigned servants.
(The System would have died prematurely had
the Ansteys’ methods been the rule. As they
were not, it was only the convicts who died in
advance of their time.) The old transport was in
the same hut as Davies. Even Mr. Thomas
Anstey gave no second thought to an arrange-
ment that shut up for 10 hours gentry who would
have rightly adorned Tyburn tree with babes in
vice. It was so usual :it did not shock even him.
As midnight drew near, old Ferris woke from a
snatch of sleep. Stirring in his ear curiously, was
a bird’s tapping which mingled with the sigh-
laden breathing of the sleepers and the creaking
of the pine-planks as the men turned restlessly in
the bunks. He raised himself upon his elbow noise-
lessly and peered into the darkness. A move-
ment in the bed-place opposite his own—Davies’
—directed his gaze; and to his surprise he saw a
breadth of moonlight flash into the room as a
plank in the wall was apparently withdrawn. A
body stopped the aperture for an instant, and
then the sudden re-appearance of the light, and
the sound of a thud outside, told him that Davies
—it could be no other than the lad—had tem-
porarily escaped from the hut. Ferris stole
quietly to the bed-place which had just been
vacated, and listened. The speakers had placed
themselves against the wall so that the shadow of
the building covej»d them, and thus Ferris heard
every word.
• m *
“ Well, mother,” he heard the boy say, in
low that were utterly wanting in tender-
ness. “So you’ve found time to come, have you ?
It’s two weeks since I’ve seen you to speak to?
Is it that your son has been flogged that you’ve
discarded him?”
“ Hush, you cruel boy—have I not done enough
for you to show you how I love you !”
“ Always the same cry—what you’ve done for
me ! Isn’t it your duty to do something for me !
Did I ask to come into the world ? ”
There’s no time for useless talk. I came to-
night, because I could not come before. Manning
suspects something. I’m sure he thinks ”
“What?” '
“ That there is something between me and you.
He watches me closely—l never come near the
hut now ”
“ Don’t I know that? Have I not been com-
pelled for a fortnight to live on this cursed pig’s
food, while you at the house feasted on the fat of
the land, and would not take the trouble to bring
me the crumbs from your table !”
“ Wicked, wicked boy !” There was a catch in
the woman’s voice as the serpent’s tooth nipped
her.
“No snivelling now ! Have you brought any
grub or tobacco with you ?”
“ Yes—there ’tis at your feet. God !to think
I should steal like this for you, an’ meet with this
reward !”
“ If you’ve come to weep over the prodigal and
nothing else, you can go back again. What if
you did take my trifling breach of the law upon
you and get lagged—what then ? Lots of mothers
would ha’ done the same for their sons, and never
thrown it into their teeth afterwards. And if you
were lagged for me, wasn’t I lagged for you?
Didn’t I follow you as quick as I could—‘Missed
my Mammy, oh !’ as the song says ”
“ Eddie, oh Eddie, you are breakin’ my heart!
An’ if you’ve nothing to say beyond this, I’ll go,
without sayin’ what I came to say !” Eorgetting
the need for silence, she burst into sobs. !
“Fool!” said the ribald. “Do ye want to
rouse the huts with your sniffling. What
did you come to say ? Out with it!”
“ Only this—that Mr. Manning—wishes to
marry me.”
“ Marry you ! Not if I know it!” said the lad,
after a second’s surprised silence. “He’s my
master now—by law, and that’s the only authority
he’ll have over me !”
“ I don’t intend to marry him—because of you.
I won’t deceive the good man, for good man he
is ”
“ What a taste he has—to wish to marry you !
And what a match—the good, kind-hearted Over-
seer, with his hide-whip, and Anstey’s Bess, the
lag housekeeper with the lag son.”
There was a rush of steps, and then Ferris
heard another voice join in the conversation. He
was at no loss to know whose it was.
“ This has gone far enough, you wretch,
Davies! I’ve heard nigh every word you two
have said. Ah, Bess, why didn’t you trust me—
why not have told me this ungrateful scamp was
your son ?”
Thewoman sobbed now unrestrainedly. Thatwas
her only answer. But her son answered with that
defiant brazenness which seemed part of his nature.
“ Because she wasn’t proud of me ! That’s why,
Manning. So you want to marry her, d’ye ?
Well, you can have my blessing, if that’ll help
you !”
“Silence, sir—don’t forget I’m your overseer !’>
“ I don’t consider any man my overseer who fol-
lows convict women about at midnight, for he’ll
only be overseer so long as Mr. Anstey doesn’t
know it.”
“ .Silence, sir—or else I rouse the huts and order
you to be chained up !”
“ Do—do ! But no, you daren’t—you’re only a
coward, Manning, for all your bigness. But I’ll
rouse the huts.” And before Manning could stop
him, he beat upon the walls of the hut and shouted
with all his might. The uproar was increased by
the cries of the now hysterical woman, and by the
curses of the overseer. Within two or three
minutes the forms of the startled inmates were
visible on the verandah of the homestead ; and
there were cries of “What’s up—What’s the
matter?” from the assigned men’s lodgings which
were, of course, locked. The impression was
general that Brady’s bushranging gang (then in
the district, at Peter’s Pass) was in attack. Prom
the aperture whence Davies had emerged the
faces of all his hut-mates were now peering.
Ferris had no longer a monopoly of the spectacle,
which by this time was exciting.
Manning had seized the young reprobate and
had forced him to the ground, and upon the
struggling bodies Bess had thrown herself, fearful
that the only two beings she cared for in the
world would do each other mortal injury. Nor
was she without cause for her fears. There was
a gleam of a knife-blade in the moonlight, and
Manning fell back, venting, in the instant in
which he loosed his clutch on the youth, a shrill
cry of pain. By the time Mr. Anstey—who, in
his haste, had seized a fowling-piece—reached the
spot from the house, the overseer lay unconscious,
while blood poured from a stab in his chest. The
transport, Davies, leaned against the wall recover-
ing his breath, and Bess stood, dazed but erect,
with a hunter’s skinning-knife in her right hand.
“ Bess —Manning ! ” exclaimed the settler as he
recognised first the woman and then the supine
man, “What does this mean?”
Bess passed her free hand over her forehead,
and then, looking steadily into her master’s face,
made answer.
“ I’ve—stabbed Mr. Manning, sir ! ”
And but one of the men who peered from the
opening in the wall could have sworn differently,
for he only had clearly perceived whose hand had
struck the blow and whose had withdrawn the
blade from the wound.
In the confusion of the event, it did not
occur to Mr. Anstey to enquire what Davies was
doing outside his hut at that hour. Not suspect-
ing the relationship of the young transport to
Bess, he did not doubt the truth of her avowal,
although he was shocked at it. Leaving to
a later and more seemly time the investigation
into the circumstances, he bade Davies help a
couple of free servants, who had come from their
quarters, to carry the injured man to his room,
where the wound was roughly bandaged till the
military doctor from Oatlands could arrive.
Bess, Mr, Anstey locked in her own apartment,
first taking the knife from her.
The next morning the wounded man was incap-
able, in magisterial opinion, of giving a lucid
account of the affair. His wound though not vital
was a sufficiently ugly one, and weeks would have
to elapse before he either could resume duty or be
in a fit state to give formal evidence against the
prisoner. Sitting as a magistrate, Mr. Anstey
formally remanded his once-trusted housekeeper
to Oatlands. She would give no explanation of
the occurrence, and the family who had so be-
friended her and whom she had so faithfully
served, saw her taken off to the township by an
escort of field police. It was a problem tl
Ansteys could not solve—bow she, so tender amt
true, should have attempted to murder their over
seer, who, attached as he was to them, was
they well knew, more deeply devoted to' hm
Good Mrs, Anstey had done all she could to urn!
mote the match ; and Bess’s refusal had perpWml
her mightily. And now the entanglement that
bound the two was not the sweet intricacy of th
lovers’ knot, but the gruesome ties which link H,!
victim to his murderess. u
# * #
The night after the outrage the plank in
the hut-wall was withdrawn once more ami
Davies, aided by Ferris, dropped through t 1.,.
aperture. 19
“ It’s as good a thing as ye can do, y e vonna
whe!p, ye ! Ye’ll get scragged in any’ease, and
Id ray Cher ye’d be scragged for bold fightin’ in
the bush than fer a cur’s trick of puttin’ the knife*
in on the sly !” So old Michael whispered.
The lad heard him in silence.
“ An’,” went on the old man, “won’t ye leave a
word for the woman who bare ye ?”
“ Tell her the best thing she ever did for me was
the loosening of this plank. She did it for mv
kisses—l did give her one or two—but I alwavs
intended to bolt to Brady through it. And tell
her the best thing she can do is to marry Manning
if he gets better and she’s not hanged. Then
when the traps are hot on my heels I’ll
always have a safe corner. Tell her that—and
good-bye.”
* * *
Bess was not hanged. At the Hobart Assizes
she would have pleaded guilty had not the Court
very informally, and under protest from Crown-
Solicitor Stephen, heard a statement from Michael
Ferris, transport, and Frank Manning, free upon -
arrival. But her son was—a couple of years later
on the final break up of Brady’s gang.
Polite Mr. Dougherty—the Turveydrop of the
scaffold—who as the law’s finishing school-master
put the last touches on young Davies, stepped
behind the coffin (which he had just delivered to
Bess) to breathe a word of consolation to Overseer
Manning who accompanied her.
“ I never did for a likelier lad, Mr. Manning
never ! An’ it’s a pity, sir—l know all the story
Mr. Manning—he was so fine a lad. Had he been
uglier, then all o’ her heart ’ud not ha’ gone into'
that shell. She’ll never marry yer, Mr. Manning
—although ’twud be a good match, sir! She
ain’t no woman to marry wi’out a heart; an’
her’s is in pieces alongside o’ that stiff in the
coffin. Thank’ee, sir—the gould ’ll do instead of
his clothes!”

After Cattle.
with muttering low
In the time when the rivers cease to flow
And the Drought King holds his reign.
Brian still rode on — southward, always south-
ward. His empty vvaterbag beat time to the
weary jog of the bay mare, at each step it struck
against her ribs with a soft thud. She was fright-
fully “ tucked up.” The sweat of two sparkling,
sun-scorched days, was dried in the hollows of her
flanks; dark salty streaks of it were pressed from
beneath the saddle cloth. Occasionally the tired
creature lowered her nose to sniff at the freshen-
ing tracks ; her instinct told her that the cattle
were making for water—some cane-grass swamp,
perhaps slimy .and foul, yet, even in its putridity,
the essence of life.
Brian had but one thought as lie rode.
At times he lifted his bloodshot eyes from the
ground, but hastened to lower them —the monotony
of the plain was frightful. In the forest, one at
least has the trees; but in the desert, there is
nothing to screen man from the awful, pitiless
glance of the Almighty, The sun was very low,
and the man’s shadow, stretching at his side,
looked like the solitary spoke in a mighty wheel,
of which the horizon was the tire.
Brian was thinking—one little thought—and
that was shared by the beast which bore him so
patiently. His throbbing temples beat it out on
the anvil of his brain : water, water, water. There
had been a time—last night—when he might have
turned back, but the freshening tracks had tempted
him to renew the pursuit at the first appearance
of da.y. Where Were the cattle now? Breaking
into A lumbering trot as they scented the water
Item afar? Or moaning dismally as, like him,
they entered the valley of the shadow of Death?
The sun sank.
The stars shone out, one by one—it was as if
tlie angels poked peepholes in the floor of Heaven,
in orler to watch the man fight his last great
fight . . . and lose. Was lie to lose? The
mare staggered a little, and fell with a sigh. He
had ids answer ; it was also the beginning of the
end—he was pinned to'the gromnd. Brian opened
his pocket-knife and gashed the poor brute crue ]y;
be felt her struggle faintly, but lie could not see
her beautiful eyes, that looked at him so reproach-
fully, through the gloom. He let the Warm blood
trickle into the palm of his hand, and lapped it
from the hollow, like a thirsty dog. To drink
blood is td court delirium, and that is the net
Which Death flings over his victim, so that he may
strike the final blow at ins leisure.
The dawn beckoned to the sun; the sun woke
the crows. They came, and pruned their glisten-
ing plumage, muttering to one another, iiL harsh,
half-human voices, or sat in a narrowing circle
and listened gravely to the maniac’s babble.
The sun crept slowly up across the dome of
polished steel, and paused, at mid-day, to watch
the birds at their feast —the man was dead.
But, after all, the black-coated gentry were
denied the pleasure of pecking out the dead man’s
eyes—like a soldier who snaps his weapon, rather
than surrender it Brian had torn them from
their sockets, and buried them deep, down in the
sand.
B ARCROFT II. BOAKE.
The firm of Stewart Dawson and Co *
the everywhere-known, firm of English watch-
hiAnufacturefs. atld the largest jewellers in
the southern hemisphere, whoso business has
grown and expanded until their warehouses
arc to be found in all parts of the British
empire, is a conspicuous proof that the days of the
commercial “ middleman ” arc numbered. In the
ordinary course of business, the jeweller’s stock is
loaded with so many profits before it reaches the
public, that the prices are almost all profit and
very little jewellery. The manufacturer produces
the article in the first place, and sells it on long
credit to the wholesale merchant. Very often the
Credit extends over all eternity, and, therefore,
the maker puts on a huge percentage to cover the
Inevitable bad debts. The purchaser possibly
exports the goods to a branch firm in the colonies.
Branches have a bad habit of bursting up through
bad management, or through the disappearance of
somebody With the cash, and because they ate fat
away and difficult of supervision, another 25 per
cent, is added on to cover charges and risks. The
“ branch ” sells to the retail dealer at three months
—or longer—terms, and renews his bill when it
falls due at a Hebrew percentage, and then
renews it some more. The retailer generally
has a bill of sale or some variety of lien
over his whole stock. His rent is enormous,
and is heavily in arrear, and his prices are
necessarily so high that hardly anyone cares to
buy, and because no one buys he has to raise them
to meet more renewals. Then his landlord sells
him up and the wholesale dealer is left, and
because he is left he charges more to the next
victim to make up. This is the ordinary course
of the jewellery business in bad times. Messrs.
Stewart Dawson and 00. have struck a new
method. They are, in most cases, the original
manufacturers, but instead of selling to the whole-
sale dealer who sells again to semi-insolvent re-
tailers, they deal directly with the public. The
public pays cash, therefore they are in a position
to buy for cash. Consequently they get a great
reduction on the price of material; they save the
merchant’s profit, the bad debts, the interest on
renewed bills, &0., and as a result they sell
at from 33 to 50 per oent. cheaper than the ordi-
nary jeweller, and prosper by doing so. The firm’s
establishment at 412 George-street, Sydney,
with its gigantic windows facing George-street
and the Strand Arcade, is a splendid spectacle,
resembling an ethereal jewellery depot run in a
crystal palace rather than an ordinary warehouse.
It is a species of promenade more than a shop, and
recalls Bret Harte’s idea of the fashionable
establishment where the uncut diamonds were
kept in a bin and brought out with a shovel.
There is an enormous stock of Waltham and
Rotherham’s watches, in addition to those
manufactured by themselves, and all at
little more than half ordinary rates, neck-
laces, tiaras, bracelets, brooches, earrings,
trinkets, and every other article in gold and
-silver that can well be imagined. A massive
collection of plate—tea and coffee sets, salvers,
cups, trophies, scent-bottles, cruets, biscuit-boxes,
dishes, fruit and flower-stands, carvers, dish-
covers, and the like —represents in itself a reason-
able-sized fortune. A great stock of marble clocks
looms up in the hinder part of the establishment,
all equally cheap and excellent. And further on
there is a maze or wilderness of optical and leather
goods, spectacles, eye-glasses, thermometers,
barometers, silver purses, card-cases, dressing-
cases, bags, silver-mounted pocket-books, cigar-
cases, opera-glasses, field-glasses, marine-glasses,
all other sorts, kinds, and varieties of glasses,
and other things without number. In' the
English watch and jewellery business Stewart
Dawson and Co. are themselves the manufac-
turers, wholesale merchants, importers, and
retail dealers—they are the entire show from
first to last, and all the intermediate profits thus
saved go to the public. All watches are sold with
a written guarantee. This firm is the only one in
the trade whose rates are unaffected by all tariffs;
the prices remain as before, despite the new tax
on the rich man’s luxuries, and the Freetrade
millionaire can get his silver plate and other
articles of vertu at the old figures no matter what
happens.
In the recent debate on the military esti-
mates in the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, Mr-
Wright said—
That 60 different reports had been made on the Question
of the doors of a magazine being swollen and would not
open. These reports extended over a period of sixteen
months, and up to the present time, so far as that House
knew, these doors were still jammed and thß Wet still
coming in. (Laughter,)
Which calls to mind another red-tape fepisode of
the early days. In 1856 the powder-haagazine-
keeper at Geelong (Vic.), Mr. Minchin, reported
that the books and vouchers were being destroyed
by mice, and requested authority to purchase a
mousetrap. The letter having duly received its
official “ skin ” number and endorsement, Mr.
Minchin was instructed by minute to forward
requisition as per the regulations. The “explo-
sive-keeper ” duly obeyed. Requisition was then
forwarded (approved by the Minister) to "the
Government Storekeeper, and, after surviving the
trials of further registration in his department,
and funds being reported as available, the usual
order was issued to the contractor. After some
delay, the mousetrap was delivered by horse and
dray at the Custom-house, and subsequently for-
warded to Geelong by steamer. Mr. Minchin’s
acknowledgement read thus Mousetrap re-
ceived. Books and papers all eaten.”
The Eiicalypte Lozenges for colds, made by
Colemane and Sons, are unsurpassed.
AN INNOVATION.
A SAC SUIT from £4 10s. Write for Patterns and
System of Measurement. J. S. MAN WAKING, Brisbane.
Every new week’s advices from England
show that the great influenza plague is getting
steadily worse. The customary death-ra,te in
London is 21 per thousand per annum ; it has
now successfully climbed to over 40. Brighton
shows a pleasant death-rate of 60 per thousand,
just about the same as that “ white man’s grave,”
the Gold Coast region. Brighton and London, in
fact, are a white man’s grave to-day, only nobody
calls them so. They are both just a trifle more
unhealthy than Rio Janeiro in the yellow-fever
season, or New Orleans in the time of the summer
pestilence, and such cities as Bombay, Calcutta,
Havana, and similar unhealthy spots are left out
bf sight. Soule daji sddtt, if the bjliderhic keeps
bddrning, asudctell phtlic iVill arise irl London, and
it face of naked Solomon Eagles \kill start to
pervade the streets with a wild curse and a brazier
apiece, and prophets in goat-skins will howl down
the Strand, and dishevelled seers will shriek on
London Bridge. That is the sort of thing that is
coming, if the pestilence only grows at the present
rate a little longer. And the two first visitants of
the Solomon Eagle tribe will be General Booth
and Stead of the Review oe Reviews—The
Bulletin is prepared to bet on that circumstance.
They will trot through the streets together with
no wardrobe worth mentioning, yelling as they
go, “Yeb forty days and London will be des-
troyed;” and Booth will drag his broken drum
behind him at the end of a string as he goes along
with a vacant eye, and a fallen jaw, and Stead
with a hollow, lack lustre visage will drearily
flap the last copy of his extinct publication in his
talons, and they will both boil their billy at a
camp-fire opposite the Bank of England and sleep
in the middle of the street.
You can obtain from B. Mountcastle & Sons, of
Albert-street, Brisbane, goods of a similar class to
that retailed by the leading West-end hosiers.
A recent yarn from Russia adds to the list
of recognised perils that encompass the married
man. An Armenian merchant threw his wife’s
lover (a military captain) out of a first-floor
window, to the great hurt and damage of a passing
pedestrian. The injured wayfarer sued the captain
for reparation; the chastened soger, on the ground
that he was only a middleman in the transaction
shifted the responsibility along to the husband'
whilst the husband pleaded that the accident was
caused by the reckless behaviour of his heart’s
delight. In the end the old man was “let in”
for 4000 roubles and costs, and complainant is
open to be pelted with as many giddy Lotharios
as they like to chuck out of windows at the same
price.

We introduce a man who says he never looked
behind him —after a certain time. How are we to
take his meaning ? Why, by letting him explain
it.
He goes on to say that in one day in February,
1890, he was suddenly seized with dizziness and
pain in his head. Like all healthy people, under
similar circumstances, lie didn’t know what to
make of it. He says he felt strange and queer, he
shivered as though the weather 1 1 ad suddenly
turned cold, and then flushed with the heat as
though it had turned hot again. What ailed him?
His doctor said he was attacked with influenzi,
and ordered him to bed. He went to bed. A few
days later the fever left him, but the illness did
not. It merely assumed another form. HU
tongue looked like a piece of brown leather, and
his skin and the whites of his eyes became yellow,
like old parchment. We must a’l eat to live, but
When tins man tried to eat, the food Went against
liim, aild afteir he had stvdllowed It by main force,
it oatised slibh paifl hi the chCSt, side, and stoiluteli
that he wished he had Iht it albne. Theil Ids
heart began to palpitate, and ho says he felt low,
languid, and tired. He had what he calls a sink-
ing feeling at the pit of the stomach and a
craving which nothing satisfied.
Being unable to take any but liquid food he
grew so weak that he was barely able to walk.
Then his heart troubled him once more, and, to
quote his own words, “As I sat in my chair I
could hear my heart thumping as if somebody was
pounding me on the hack.”
This showed that the heart had too much work
on hand and was struggling under it like a horse
trying to carry two men. “ I got very little sleep
rt night,” he says, “and would lie awake for
hours tossing about on the bed,” This sort of
thing is very wearing, and we are not surprised to
learn that he lost flesh until little was left of him
but skin and bone. “My cheeks,” he says, “sank
in until they were almost drawn together, and
people shook their heads and predicted that my
time iti this world was nearly up. Still 1 had all
confidence in my physician and kept on taking his
medicine. From first to last 1 took some forty or
fifty bottles of it (of all kinds) without benefit.-
“Finally one da,y the doctor sounded my lungs
and asked me if any of our family died of con-
sumption. He said that the heart palpitation was
caused by dyspepsia. Then he said I had better
take further advice; he could do no more for me.
This was after nine months of his treatment. I
gave up all hopes of getting better, and, indeed,
no one expected me to.
“It was now winter again, December, 1890.
One day I found a little book or pamphlet in the
house, that I had never seen before. It was about
a medicine called Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and
described a case like mine having been cured by it.
Without going into all my hopes and fears on the
point, it is enough to say that I got a bottle from
Mr. Kirkman, Chemist, Ellerby Lane, I took the
contents of that bottle and certainly felt a little
better. I took a second and began to eat solid
food, which agreed with me.
“ After this I never looked behind me, though
Iny recovery was a work of time, for 1 was Very
much reduced. JI stuck to the medicine, and with
good reason, and at last got back to my work,
strong and well, and have remained so ever since.
When I went back to the works the foreman and
others gathered round me and asked what had
wrought the wonderful change. I answered,
“Mother Seigel’s Syrup had wrought it.” When
I said I wished to start work they told me I must
first be examined by a doctor. The doctor said I
was fit for work and I went to work the next
morning and have never lost a minute since.
“I wish others to know what Seigel’s Syrup has
done for me, and I give the proprietors permission
to publish this brief account of my ease. lam a
cloth presser by trade and have worked at Messrs.
Hepworth and Sons, Clay Pit Lane, for four
years.” Harvey Askew, 2 Back Timber Place,
Ellerby Lane, Leeds.
The doctor was right in saying that the apparent
heart trouble in Mr. Askew’s case arose from
dyspepsia, for dyspepsia was his only ailment.
And if he had used Mother SeigeTs Syrup in
February, 1890, he would have had no tale to tell,
for he would have been all right directly. As it
is we are glad that after he did try it he had no
relapse. He never looked behind him ,
