The Coming struggle in England.
The Bull
SATURDAY, JULY 21, 1888.
Ma. Gladstonh has appealed to the British
Constituencies, and has met with a respor se
that is unsatisfactory because incomplete
and indefinite. The verdict of the nation
was rsked for, and only the uncertain voice
of a percentage of the national jurors was
vouchsafed in reply. Instead of a decision
there has been a postponemeat of the point
at issue; the oracle has spoken, but in such
unintelligible terms that the question is still
practically without an answer. Prejudice
has muffled the voice of the electors, and
suspicion has imported ax-biguity into the
reply. English prejudices have throughout
modern history been strong enough to
obscure the Irish cause. Interest alone
taught English territorial magnates, whether
Conservatives or Liberals, to regard the
Irish agitator as a disreputable and danger-
ous character. The English landlord hated
Irish Nationalists because the latter had no
consideration for the holders of Irish
estates; to sympathise with the agitator
was to deny the rights of property, and to
assist in the work of overturning the land
monopoly in England. At the present time
the land-owners in the United Kingdom
who fight on the side of Irish patriotism
must be aware that they are preparing the
way for a future and inevitable attack on
their own assumed right to monopolise the
revenue of the estates which they hold. The
question of Home Rule is personal to every
elector of Great Britain. If the Nationalists
ruled Ireland the exact value of title-deeds
would be among the first p 'ints settled, and
a rupture of the land monopoly in that pro-
vince would be the precursor of a similar
rupture throughout the kingdom. Home
Rule is a question of snl-owner and soil-
filler; of monopolists and those who are
deprived of their natural inheritance; and
the intelligent English proprietor loots at it
m this light. The English labourer, on the
contrary, Las not yet been educated
to a true knowledge of the meaning

Thus it is that Gladstone has received so
little support in England itself. Speaking
generally, the landlords have opposed him
from a selfish but natural regard for their
own possessions, and the labouring classes
have also to an extent opposed him, on ac-
count of their prejudicec, ignorance, and the
Tory influence treacherously working upon
these two attributes. The mass of English
voters have, as the great Premier last weex
remarked, notyet learnt their lesson. Ireland
was educated under the merciless discipline
of misery ; Scotland “ slowly and painfully ”
underwent the same course of instruction;
Wales has also graduate d; but England is
still untaught. There, the power of
Toryism is grea‘er, because of the
influence of the established Church which
as an organisation has forsaken its creed
to save its revenues, and pawns the
gospel for glory. There, too, all classes re-
gard the constitution and crown as creations
of their own. The kingdom is called by the
name of their own country ; it is thehenour
of their name that Irish, Welsh, and Scots
fight to maintain. Irishmen regard the
Empire as their oppressor, Scotchmen still
feel something of jealousy, and Welshmen
are only theoretically united to England.
These all look with at least a measure of in-
difference upon the English name and fame,

Admitting that the election has not re-
salted as Mr. Gladstone would desire, it
must be still more unsatisfactory to the
Tories and Unionists. There were very
many reasons to justify the hope of a
triumphant Tory victory. Mr. Gladstone
was pledged to a scheme which had already
caused such men as John Bright, Joseph
Chambbrlain, Lord Hartington, Goschbn,
and Sir Henry James to break openly from
their party. On the eve of battle the two
sections of Liberals were bitterly opposed,
and in the actual contest the Union Liberals
acceded to the hereditary enemy of their
country. Gladstone was attacked by the
Conservatives on his piinciples and his Bill,
his right to lead the Liberals or to grant
Home Rule was challenged by Cham-
berlain and Lord Hartington. The fight
was all along the line, and the result is that
the Unionists have suffered a significant
defeat, while the Tories bear nothing of
the spoils or advantages of victory. Other
causes besides ths liberal dissensions
favoured the Tories to a very considerable
extent. The fact that they had no defined
Irish policy to defend, was strongly in their
favour. Had the “ twenty years’ of constant
coercion” policy been presented as the al-
ternative to Gladsxonian Home Rule, the
utter overthrow of the Tories would have
been an absolute certainty. But this policy
was repudiated by the Marquis of Salis-
bury almost immediately after its promul-
gation by him, and thenceforth his followers
confined themselves to criticism and con-
demnation—always a safe and popular
course—while shrouding their own schemes
in an impenetrable fog of magniloquent
oratory, Toe Tories were also assisted by
the absolute indifference of a very large
section of Liberal voters. The Tory-hatched
cablegrams presented to the readers of
the Australian dailies admit that the
polliag throughout the kingdom was
very light, and it is certain that Tory
votes were not less carefully recorded
than on former occasions, for all of
that party who were opposed to Home
Rule would work to defeat it. and even
those few who favoured it would probably
vote against their convictions on this point,
trusting to their own party to “ dish the
Whigs ” as soon as they acceeded to power.
The abstention from voting must certainly
have been on the Liberal side. Many up-
holders of that faith would probably be
still undecided regarding the policy, if
not opposed to it, and, therefore,
apathetic concerning the issue. Dazed
by the division of their own party,
they would refrain from assisting either
side. So many entirely now points of such
importance as to be of almost revolu-
tionary character are comprised in the
Home Rule Bill that it will yet be some
months before the average English elector
fully decides as to the usefulness of the
measure. The abolition of hereditary legis-
lation, decentralisation of administrative
power, and the overthrow of landlordism,
are all provided tor in the Gladstonian
scheme of Home Rule. Every English-
man has Conservative Instincts, heir-
looms of a baser and more super-
stitious age, which revolt against the
thought of fundamental reform. Even
Truth and Retk olds’ Newspaper, two typi*
o&l Radical journals, assert sometimes that
“ Her Majesty has graciously consented ”
to go somewhere, when the .real meaning
is that “ the Queen, after a lot of barney,
reluctantly agreed to send the Tory cause
along ”by doing something. English Radi-
cals are so by persuasion of their reason,
but their instinct has not yet been brought
into subjection, and only by very slow de-
grees will the force of intellect dominate
the ghost of tradition in the matter of Home
Rule; and it is, we may safely presume, be-
cause of the incomplete consideration of
the measure that the Liberals are apathetic.
Their leader has gone too far in advance of
his supports; he halts to call the muster-
roll, and finds that only the fleetest portion
of his folio win g are near enough to answer
to their names. He must wait for the
stragglers to come up, and then his army
will carry all before them. More fortunate
than their opponents, the Tories had no
schism to rend their ranks; they were
thoroughly united, and had made every pre-
paration for the encounter. The Queen had
been drawn from her obstinate and selfish
retirement and shown to the people, just in
the same way that the relics of some grimy
old saint were shown to the crusading bands
of out-throats before they were led against
the Saracens; the Prince of Wales was
trotted along with the appropriate banner of
colonial patronage; Batten berg was sent
out of the kingdom,and appropriate buukum
was broached on the theme of Imperial
Federation. All these things helped the
party, which also received some asritanoe.
from that patronising body of political
bribers, the Primrose League, the members
of which, following the example of the
Duchess of Devonshire, who kissed a butcher
in order to gain a Tote for her husband,
have stooped to every species of meanness
and cajolery in order to seduce voters from
their Liberal allegiance. Haughty dames
who, until quite recently—that is, up to the
time when Hodge obtained the franchise-
regarded the labourers on the ancestral
estate as worth but little less than the swine
which he feeds, were suddenly moved to an
absorbing interest in their condition, and the
labourers were beguiled accordingly. No pos-

there is little ohanoe of prolonged continu-
ance in power for a party so constituted.
Many Unionists who refuse to help Mr.
Gladstone in granting Home Rule to Ire-
land would be still more unwilling to support
the Marquis of Salisbury in a policy of con-
tinued coercion.

Unsatisfactory to the Liberals, and dis-
hppointing to the Tories, the appeal to the
country has been nothing short of a disaster
to Hartinoton and C&amberlain. The
former probably seceded from the Progres-
sive Liberals for the same reason that the
young Jew refused to be a Christian—be-
cause he had too much property to follow
the appeal of his conscience. As the Heir
Apparent to immense estates and a duke-
dom, the maintenance of land-monopoly
must be very dear to him. When, therefore,
this monopoly was distinctly menaced, and
hereditary titles endangered by the Home
Rule Bill, the Marquis allowed the shadow
of his future wealth and rank to obscure
his professed principles, and he showed his
true colours. It would be well if he would
permanently adhere to the Tories whom his
money and rank-weighted soul loves. Eng-
land would then know her enemies.
Now, such as he, are simply political pirates,
who sail under the Liberal flag, that they
may escape the destruction which would
otherwise come upon them. Millionaire
dukes will never assist the nation to re-
cover the national inheritance. Ambition
probably caused Mr. Chamberlain to break
from his allegiance with the Liberal
leader. He, like Henry Y., tried on the
crown while its owner was living. Like that
prince, the act only obtained a severe re-
proof as its reward. Out of 92 followers
whom he took with him to the constituencies,
only 78 have come back. He aspired to the
leadership of the party, but the party in-
dignantly repudiated him. The Birmingham
caucus decided against his ambitious enter-
prise, and the electors followed suit. What-
ever his course may be in the future, his
ohanoe of recovering his former prestige
can only depend upon the forgetfulness of
electors. He is for the present an unattrac-
tive figure in English politics. The Union
party is too incongruous in its elements to
obey any leader, and incapable even of hold-
ing together for long. Its policy is a mere
negation, and its name an unintended
sarcasm.
* ♦ *
The one great result of the British elec-
tion is the formal adoption of, the Home
Rule reforms by the Liberal party, and their
utter rejection by the Tories. To the
Liberals this demarcation of party lines will
be of inestimable value. Hitherto Liberalism
has appeared to the masses as a dry, cold
theory, founded upon political principles
which were interesting only to the
student; now it is instinct with life,
and abundant in promise of benefit in
action. Similarly the veil is torn from
Toryism, and it is seen to be, not an em-
bodiment of principles, to be discovered in
musty tomes of constitutional law and his-
tory, not a political oree,d of, divine dicta-
tion, but a gospel of man’s invention, propa-
gated to justify oppression, to sanctify
pillage and robbery, and to perpetuate need-
less wretchedness and misery. The owner-
ship of the land is the question of Irish
politics; the quarrel has now been imported
into British politics, and the Tories have
sided with the oppressors, while the Liberals
champion the cause of justice. The fight
for Home Rule is only the first skirmish in
the campaign. Toryism, land monopoly,
and oppression, are now clearly seen to be
inseparably united. Against this alliance,
Liberalism will contend, and with the cer-
tainty of achieving an ultimate victory. With
definite objects to accomplish, visible bene-
fits to win, and foes, equally familiar and
tyrannous to overthrow, the Liberals will see
that their political faith is not a theory, but a
life-work which brings an enduring and a
material reward. Of the outcome of the strife
there can be no doubt. We have seen that
the Tories cannot now hold their own, and
every day must strengthen their rivals.
Gladstone’s threat to the Duke of West-
minster of destroying the peerage was no
empty boast. The peerage, lau dlordism,
and class monopolies must all ultimately go
down, and with the dawn of a jqster social
system, men will look back in wonder that
such instruments of evil and oppression
ev'uld have endured so long.
The Death Penalty.
Englanli has had a harvest of executions during
the last eig-jit or nine months. As many as five
unfortunate, culprits have been swung into eter-
nity on a sing ie morning. It is not surprising that
the gorge of a considerable portion of the public
Irises at this, i sir Joseph Pease, member for
Durham, tableiji accordingly, one night lately, in
the House of C pmmons, a motion to abolish the
death penalty. Sixty-two members voted with
him, but the motion, and an amendment on it
almost equally condemnatory of the present prac-
tice, were lost. The result is not discouraging.
The opponents of capital punishment are increas-
ing. Those who think the gallows indispensable
are becoming harder up for plausible arguments.
• * *
The advocates of hanging are forced now to hold
almost wholly by the assertion that capital punish-
ment deters from the crimes for which it is in-
flicted. But, as Sir Joseph points out, that asser-
tion was long ago found to be erroneous as regards
many crimes. The Tudors, the Stuarts, and
the House of Brunswick, successively Increased
the number of offences punishable with death. In
the reign of Henry YIIL, 73 robbers were exe-
cuted. These executions were not followed by a
decrease in this form of crime. If not intbis.it
was fair to infer that a decrease could not be
effected by the use of a similar means in other
forms. Such inference was actually drawn, and
crystallised Into a principle of antagonism to
capital punishment. Offence after offence was re.
moved from the capital code, until in England
now one remains. The principle that has cut the
list down so far is still at work, land is more
strongly urged by reason and experience to work
on to the end than it was to make a beginning. In
New South Wales it has not made much more
than a beginning. The colonial statute-book has
still about a score of offences for which death
may be inflicted. But there are indications that a
change is near.
m * *
The amendment proposed by Mr. Howard Yin,
cent was to the effect that murder, the one
capital offence on the English Statute-book, should
be divided into three degrees, and that the death
penalty should be inflicted only for one of these.
This, It will be seen, is in intention a forward
move. It limits the punishment of death to cases
In which life has been taken wilfully and of malice
aforethought. There would be something gained,
as there is in some parts of America, if the distinc-
tion were adopted. Under it, “ the Manchester
Martyrs,” as the three Fenians who, in trying to
burst open the lock of a prison-van, shot a ser-
geant of police, are called, would not have been
executed. Under it, had it existed in Australia, the
youth Johns would not have been sentenced to
death for the Wantabadgery outrage. Where
death ensued there should be, before murder in
the capital sense could be substantiated, legal
proof that the prisoner premeditated It. The dis-
tinction is, however, a difficult one to handle.
Sentiment enters into it. That is why so much
uncertainty attaches to the issue of murder-
trials in the United States. Besides, the pub-
lic conscience refuses to accept the definition
If scientifically drawn. In Infanticide all the
elements of premeditation are almost always pre-
sent. But the public conscience universally repro-
bates the infliction of the death penalty in such
oases. It is regrettable that Mr. Vincent did not
succeed in having three degrees of murder estab-
lished, for, hard as it is to point to marginal lines
generally, there are cases in which, under the law
so amended, the hangman would be left with a
holiday.
* » *
Opponents of a change] in the law point to
some countries that, after formally abandoning
capital punishment, are found to have re-intro-
duoed it. The reason given for the re-introduction
is that murders increased terribly from the time
the death-penalty was abandoned. If numerous
countries so acted, and if the reason given be
valid, a serious argument against changing the
present law would be forthcoming. In the debate
In the House of Commons, Wurtemberg and Swit-
zerland are the only places named in this
connection. Certain States in America might,
we believe, be added. But these are not
enough. As regards the American States
there is an ebb and flow of opinion upon the sub-
ject, but statistics previously given by us show
that the abolitionist States as a whole escaped in-
crease of murders. Rhode Island escaped. Wis-
consin escaped. Michigan escaped. Wurtemberg
is a small place, with a population not much
greater than that of New South Wales, and subject
to rapid changes of temperament, which is some-
times difficult to understand. Switzerland, how-
ever, commands attention. It abolished capital
punishment in 1874, and re-enacted it in 1879. It
was by popular acclaim the death-penalty was
brought back. The first thing to note is the short
time given to the experiment. Crime is some-
times epidemic. Such quick change in so grave a
matter creates doubt as to whether the abolition
of the law, or its re-enactment, was the conse-
quence of mature deliberation. It may be that
neither was. Switzerland is alive with the
spirit of human progress. It la one of the
countries that, in the main, helps to drag
sluggish Europe along. It is a refuge for
the expatriated by other lands. Fiery minds
flock to it. But it pays severe penalties in other
respects. It has an infamous liquor-system, and
is the most drunken country in the world. In
England, two persons out of every thousand die
from drink; in Switzerland, 3’89, Its movements
are plunges. In England, 33’1 per thousand die
violent deaths; in Switzerland, 38’3. In England,
two per thousand obtain divorces; in Switzerland,
5L In England, 67per million commit suicide; in
Switzerland, 303. It is but reasonable then, to re-
fuse to its proceeding of 1879'some of the authority
advocates for the retention of capital punishment
claim for it. But if we be held to it, then we point
to the same term of experiment in Wisconsin,
where murders did not increase; and to twice as
long in Rhode Island, and four times as long in
Michigan, in both of which the murder rate went
down.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mineral Monopolies in England.
The English Conservative journals have long
since discovered that the only remedy for the
prevailing slackness of trade is a reduction in the
wages of workmen. The existing depression
affects all classes to a greater or less degree, and
is largely attributable to the fact that foreigners
are cutting Englishmen out of colonial and con-
tinental markets, and competing with them in the
mark ts of the United Kingdom Itself. To main-
tain their plaee in the contest Eaglish producers
must sell at a less rate than they have been ac-
customed to ask, and to effect this reduction Tory
authorities agree that the workmen must accept
the rates which were paid years ago. Capital,
they say, must be rewarded with full rates; labour
must curtail its demands. Less prejudiced minds
will be inclined to enquire why the whole burden
of the reduction [should fall upon the workman
Instead of being divided pro rata among those
who share in the price obtained for the product.
The In j ustioe of expecting the workman to concede
enough of his wages to induce a revival of trade
may be readily seen from the circumstances of the
iron-producing industry, now terribly depressed
in consequence of the importation of continental
iron, which can be sold at Bs. a ton less than that
of local manufacture. Of the cost of production
in England, six to ten pence go to the miner, and
six to seven shillings as royalty to the land-owner.
If the miner were to give his services for nothing,
foreign iron would still be 3j. cheaper than Eng-
lish, so that the folly of vaunting reduction of his
wage as a remedy is apparent. It is the mine-
owner who must make concession. He must
largely abate his present enormous charge for that
which he did not make and only claims to mono-
polise by favour of an unjust social system. That
this system 1s doomed is apparent from the tone
of a recent debate in the House of Commons,
where a motion affirming the need of radical
alteration in the system of mineral monopolies
was strongly supported and only withdrawn upon
promise of a bill dealing with the subject. The
very name of " royalty ” shows it to be a toll pay-
able to the State, and It is so paid all over the
Continent, where its amount in the case of iron is ,
from sd. to 9d. a ton. If the English iron-trade is
to be revived, these huge monopolies must be
overthrown; they never should have been per-
mitted, and will not be allowed to continue. Their
abolition will be facilitated by the certainty of
their depreciation; manufacturers will only pay
them as long as it is profitable to do so, and as it
is alleged that foreigners must certainly over-run
the home market as long as the present high
royalties are demanded, their depreciation is cer-
tain. A growing Radicalism will not be satisfied
until royalties are paid to the “ sovereign people.”
+
The Freetrade of Frankie
The meeting held last week in Sydney for the
purpose of finding some means of relief for the
existing depression in the iron-trade put the Free-
traders ia an awkward fix, Mr, Franki, an
alleged advocate of Freetrade, demanded Pro-
tection of the most direct kind. He asked that the
Government should “ keep such work in the
colony as would give employment to the people in
it.” Anything straighter than this in the way of
Protection it is impossible to Imagine. To have
the work done within the colony, Mr. Franki
admits would cost more. Therefore, the
difference between the home and foreign
cost is the amount which taxpayers will
hand over to protect the industry of known
Individuals. This development of Protection
contrasts badly with that effected by ad valorem
duties, for In the latter cases the individuals who
will benefit are usually unknown: the Industries
to which encouragement is extended may not be
in existence. But in the present instance, the per-
sons are defined: the establishments to be subsl-
'dlsed may be catalogued. Mr. Franki asks that
the community should pay to him and the ether
petitioners certain sums of money, that their dls-*
tress may be relieved. No consistent Freetrader
could afford any encouragement whatever to such
a demand, for his creed asserts that men and
States should buy in the cheapest market wherever
that may be found. To concede or support Mr.
Franki’s request would be to deny the Free-
trade faith. Yet Sir Henry Parkes, and the
Yellow Pup which has lately raised such a howl
against 5 per cent, ad valorem duties, were there;
Mr. Abigail was there, so was J. Bi Neild, who
wagged a merciless jaw for nine hours to show
the] iniquity of a very mild dose of; Protection:
and most of those who disgraced themselves In the
stonewalling of the previous week were there
extending support to the demands of Mr, Franki.
'Their presence gives rise to curious reflections.
Are they, one may wonder, Incapable of discern-
ing Protection under the present guise ? Or, on
the other hand, are [they all Protectionists who
vStonewalled ad valorem duties simply from
Orange bigotry? Was Freetrade with them
merely a convenient stick with which to
beat the Green Dog of their ■“ religious ”
delirium tremens? And the Daily Telegraph
[also advocates Protection of Franki; it admit*
;that “the ironworkers of Sydney may have a
special claim for consideration.” Therefore it
supports this special claim and tries to “sneak in
[Protection” under the guise of “special claims”
when for weeks it has howled against all and sun-
dry who would seek to pervert the alleged settled
policy of the country. Last week we told
the D.T. that there was no universal principle
Involved in . the much-debated question of
fiscal policy. The D.T. apparently has profited
by that instruction, and now regards the question
as one of opportunism. But when so doing it
ought also to declare its conversion, and not try to
“ sneak In Protection” while pretending to adhere
to a universal principle of absolute Freetrade.
The Bulletin, having always supported Protec-
tion, is able to consistently advocate Its applica-
tion to the present case. It is better that 10 per
cent* extra should be paid by the Government for
ironwork than [that the willing workers should
starve and the industries be crushed. But we
could wish that Mr. Franki and his men would
announce themselves as Protectionists; and could
,also wish them a fuller knowledge of the political
dodges of such men as Abigail, Garrard, and
Neild, who hunt with the hounds of Freetrade
and run with the Protectionist hare. Consistent
advocacy of Protection cannot be expected from
men who are only consistent Orangemen.
Meanness In Bxoelsis.
We thought the political feats of legislators la
Sydney since the now celebrated Arab-killing ex-
pedition to the Soudan had demonstrated the
very furthest point which it was possible for even
political meanness to deseend. Victoria, however,
has furnished an Instance which makes us forget
our captured goat and (urn our thoughts away
from the littlenesses of New South Wales to con -
template with scientific Interest the still mor
microscopic doings of the Government which
owns Duncan Gillies for its chief. The Govern-
ment of Victoria was lately defendant in a law
case in which a poor devil, run out of the Civil
Service for asking to be allowed to do something
for his salary, sought the opinion of the Supreme
Court upon a disputed clause of one of the
latest pieces of scissors and paste manufac-
ture known as an Act of Parliament. The
Court gave judgment by a majority in
favour of Brownb, declaring that the Public
Service Commissioners—who seem to have been
created for the purpose of breeding discontent In
official ranks—had no power to dispense with the
officer, he being one of those previously In the
Civil Service whose rights (precluding dismissal
except for misconduct) were specially served by a
clause of Mr. Service’s Act. Browne had a
notion that he would shine In one branch of his
department, where his superior would not have
him. He also felt that he was utterly useless in
another position into which he was stowed
away like lumber; and, in a weak moment,
sought the "powerful” aid of a member
of Parliament. Hence the events which fol-
lowed. But we don’t fancy that, in their most
despondent ponderings on the cursedness of the
human family, either Browne or the Australian
public, for one moment conceived it probable that
the triumphant but poor clerk would be compelled
by a rich Government to go to the Privy Coun-
cil, In order to force them to obey the law as in-
terpreted by the Supreme Court. We are told
that it Is the unexpected that happens; and this un-
expected thing for Browne would have happened
assuredly had not the colleagues of the gentleman
who introduced copper gratuities into Echuoa
found It necessary to get the consent of the
Supreme Court to the prosecution of the appeal •
The Supreme Court did not allow the expensive
proceeding, and hence the Victorian Executive
has been saved by the narrowest of chances from
posing as the champion mean Government of the
Southern Hemisphere. The Victorians should
pray for a law that whenever a Government seeks
to make a clerk Insolvent by dragging him into an
expensive appeal Ministers should personally bear
the costs. Such a provision, If it could be added
to the Statute-book, would slake for ever and ever

The British Elections.
The complete returns of the recent election in the
United Kingdom are sadly significant. Leaving
that nondescript body, the Unionists, out of the
question (for they, although unwilling to go with
Gladstone and Home Rule, would certainly not
go with Salisbury and coercion), the English
constituencies by 383 to 135, declared themselves
favourable to the Conservative government of
Ireland by coercion. The other provinces-—Soot-
!and, Wales, and Ireland—on the contrary, de-
cided In Gladstone’s favour by 118 to 83. Scot-
land and Wales alone, by 65 to 16, have demanded
that the chains shall be struck off, and Ire-
land made free, but the Conservative Eng-
lish decide to make the burden heavier
and the yoke more grievous. Resistance of
just demands, constitutionally urged, Inevitably
leads toidisoontent, culminating in rebellion, If the
demand be still unanswered. Opposition by the
Lords to the Reform Bill was sullenly withdrawn
only when the nation was on the threshold of
revolution. So it will be if continued resistance
is made to the concession of autonomy to Ireland.
England now has to deal not with that province
alone, but with Scotland and Wales as well. And
finality to agitation can only be secured in one
way—by full concession. The demand for Home
Rule would have 'been stifled years ago if the
demand had not been just and reasonable, and it
cannot be stifled now. The voice of discontent
can only be silenced by removing the body from
which it issues. To attempt to control it will only
make the voice assume a higher tone. It speaks
now in the accents of law and order; it may, if met
by brute force, speak hereafter in the fierceness
of disastrous anger.

According to the local Herald, Cardinal
Moran’s piece at the celebration of tbe “ Month’s
Mind”—a sort of after-thought burial over the

Melbourne, was a soul-wringing affair. His dreary
platitudes and monotonous cadence drove many
from the Cathedral. The discourse was moran

Graham Berry onoe told this story about
himself When I first obtained a situation as a
shop-boy, the master somewhat abruptly enquired
my name. I hesitatingly said, * Sir, Graham Berry,
sir.’ ‘Oh, well, Sir Graham Berry,’he laughingly
said, ‘go and sweep out the back store.’” Those
who heard the anecdote laughed at it as a good

a prophet.
After the recent Tasmanian railway acci-

No one seconded the proposition, so the thanks-
giving did not come off. Any logical person can
see the inference.
A Melbourne coroner on the “rights of

kick his wife so long as he employs his boots for
chastisement only.

Tbe London correspondent of a Sydney
daily traces the Queen’s " bad luck,” including the
Russian war (?), the deaths of the Prlnco Consort,
Princess Alice, and John Brown, to the proprietor-
ship of the great Kohi-noor. Possibly the writer
imagines that, lacking the diamond, she would
have inherited immortality, not only for herself

had a chanee of earning an honest living at a con-

Tbe magnificent Judge Quinlan was asked

The latest Tory lie regarding Mr. Glad-
stone is that he is possessed by a mania for shop-
ping, his purchases being of a very remarkable
character. He thinks nothing, they say, of making
a clean sweep of all the half-naked photos, in a
great stationery establishment, and he buys
ladies’ underclothing on a scale which would suit
Solomon or Brigham Young rather than a sedate
English Premier. This lie appears in a Chinese
paper, so it is probably the work of some Mongol
member of the Primrose League, whose death will
one day supply a long-felt want.
Bishop Selwyn once received into the
Christian faith Ihaka (Jacob), a noted old can-
nibal and polygamist, and tome years after, when
re-visiting the locality, asked after his welfare,
and on being told he still lived, announced his In-
tention to call upon him. This was a great
honour, and the old chief was duly impressed.
He summoned his followers and bade them prepare
a feast, and make all proper preparation for re-
ceiving the distinguished guest. “Give him, he
said, "a waihene ” (wife). “ But,” said his major
domo, "this is a Tohunga” (chief priest). Then,
(rravsly replied the old Christianised heathen,
“give him two.”
In pronouncing a panegyric on the late
Archbishop Goold, of Melbourne, Bev. Father
Cahill likened him to St. Patrick and to the
Saviour ; but Father Cahill did not give the points
o f resemblance between the defunct ecclesiastic
and Ireland’s fancy saint, neither can we remem-
ber any Here is the beautiful little reminiscence
illustrative of the archbishop’s Chrlstlike qualities;
—” Once, while going to confirmation, he travelled
over a rough and tedious road, and met several
persons who were leading a few of the children to
the church. The archbishop took the children
into his carriage, and thus helped them to church.
We cannot call to mind any record of the lowly
Nszarene taking little children into Tus carriage.
Our religious education has been sadly neglected.
Wo fear that the new decorative Initials

Sir W. J. Clarke was created a baronet;
Bill knew no more what ‘'bart.” meant than
he knew about the interior economy of a
chronometer; but he took the title all the same,
and he never disgraced it in the least. He made
one slight mistake, though. Shortly after the
royal favour shone upon him, a Fiying Squadron
Admiral (or something of the sort), whom he had
sumptuously entertained, called on him and left
him a P.P.C. card. Not being very well up in hla
French, Bill delicately acknowledged the compli-
ment, and, to make sure of the roving sailor's
title, had a quiet look at the paste-board. He
then wrote on the envelope, “ Admiral 80-and-80,
P.P.C.”
There was never a man born yet who
hadn’t a weak spot in him somewhere. It would
be hard to find a more level-headed citizen than
the late Mr. J. P, Fallon, of Albury, was when in
the flesh, and yet It appears he had a great am-
bition to masquerade in uniform at the Victorian
Vice-regal Court. What the uniform was, never
troubled him much, providing it was a uniform,
and so it came to pass in the end that he managed
to get himself appointed as Columbian Consul-
General. Everything was then arranged to gratify
his one little fad, when a circumstance over which
he had no control stepped in and decisively burst
up all his little scheme. Even before he received
his commhslon, Daath stepped in and bore him
along to another Court, where a small tinsel plate
is the only decoration. Owing to the usual official
muddle and delay, however, his appointment to
the Consul-Generalship has just been gazetted,
and it reads strangely by tne side of his death
notice.

P appeared to be thunderstruck ’* on learning that
hla house was on fire. Swift as an arrow from a
bow came the genial coroner's repartee—“it should
have been lightning-stricken.” There were many
other j ikes nearly as dazzling as this one, but life
is too short for us to give them all. That single
illustration is sufficient to show that the Mel-
bourne coroner is a man of infinite jest. We
cannot help thinking that, if a sixpenny edition of
“ Youl’s Humours ” were slipped into the shell of
every ladjnand gentleman inquested, a Urge pro-

The Berlin War Office sent a celebrated
general to meet the fantastical picture represent-
ing the Duke of Connaught waiting with
the Guards at the burletque battle of Tel-
el-Keblr, which the Queen was so 111-advJscd
as to send to the Fine Arts Exhibition there.
The general's name was Derision—general
der'slon. Truth save that the work Is, artls’i-
cally, not even mediocre, while the subject fs
grotesque to tbe last degree ; and Berlin is really
not the sort of place where people canbe“ho-
ousaed” by such fairy tales as Lord Wolseley sent
home from Egypt for Her Majesty's delectation.
By the way, we notice ;that the same nigger-
butcher, “ Lord” Wolseley, has had the calm
impudence to patronise that splendid regi-
ment the Black Watch:When in action

trouble about the part of the field where they are
engaged, for I have always then realised that
what men could do they would accomplish.
Officers and men work together with an entire

success. Whenever I go on active service I
always try to have tjiis splendid regiment with me,
because' I can rely upon it at all times and unejer
all circumstances. Wherever I see the Ired hackle
of the Black Watch I feel I hawe there not only
good friends, but also staunch comrades who will
stand by one to the last.” What a beetling cliff of
cheek this cutter of black threats must have!

not help but weep. His

A German engineer has propounded a

and thus overcome the force of gravitation. How
the trains are to be propelled is not yet apparent,
but perhaps the idea is to hang the tram on the
greased rope by a hook, then hoist up the Luro-
pean end, and let the affair slide.

afterwards.


The Wiaton (Queensland) Hekalb is ex-
cited over a remarkable find which has been made
in the remote West. A man who was engaged
sinking a well in that thirsty land has discovered,
at a depth of 350 ft„ three balls joined together, to
form a pawnbroker’s sign, each being about Gin.
in circumference, of a crystalline appearance,
and made of some compound which is believed
to consist greatly of mundie and tin. No trace
either of a pawnbroker or a pledge-ticket was
discovered, so the balls stand alone in their
majestic simplicity as a relic of primeval life la
Australia. The most feasible explanation of the
mystery seems to be that the lost 10 tribes started
the mutual loan and discount business la
the Northern wilds, and took in all the ward-
robe of the original inhabitants, which may
account for the present unclothed state of
the aboriginal race. Some learned men, however,
reject this theory, and believe that the Israelites
on arriving in this country found it empty, and
gradually degenerated for want of anything to dis"
count until they returned to their original state of
savagery, and now do not even know how to draw
up a bill of sale, and are utterly unable to calcu-
late three months’ Interest at 1100 per shent pet

deterioration have apparently come further south,
and their descendants are now writing novels in

chickens, drinking bad rum, accepting a Govern-
ment blanket annually, and utterly innocent of
any design for returning to their native land to
hunt the Hebrew kangaroo on Lebanon.
PEPPER AND SALT.
Dark days have come upon a certain Mel-
bourne Church. The congregation are no longer
in a position to pay their minister his stipulated
wage; so with Christian promptitude he has
tendered his resignation to the Presbytery. This
gentleman—a flev. J. A. Stuart—was engaged to
labour in the vineyard for a penny per diem, and
he doesn’t care for dispensing the blessed Word at
a lower-figure. Comedians may occasionally rub
along on half salaries (or no salaries at all), but
your conscientious parson throws up his engage-
ment if the treasury isn’t up to expectations. The
plain, unvarnished tale of the Kev. J. A. Stuart
was particularly touching. He said:—“I have
been paid very satisfactorily, but the whole diffi-
culty is a question of finance.” Alas, poor con-
gregation! If they lay not up for themselves
some treasures on earth, In order to set that
church humming again, their last state will be
worse than their first. Number 393 in tho book,

English literature has just been enriched
by the publication of another royal volume,
“The Cruise of the Bacchante*” This is the re-
vised diary of those dear little innocents, Albert
Victor and George of Wales, written during their
never-to-be-foxgoiten tour round the world. That
the whole book is an insult to humanity goes with
out saying. But one passage of Australian interest
deserves embalming as a sample of unblushing
ImpudenceSquatters, with limited capital,
borrow money on the security of their station,
stock, or wool. If they go too far they get em-
barrassed, and the end of embarrassment here, as
in the old country and all the world over, is the
same.” If this should meet the eye of any squatter
who ever went “ nap ” on a aalnfall which didn’t
come off, let us trust he won’t say anything “ dis-
loyal ” about the aolf-satlsfled young prigs who
wrote It. We wouldn’t say anything “disloyal”
for the world. But we will sing an interrogative
ditty:—
The people of Queensland are apparently
rather proud of their new flogger and hanger
and Issue periodical descriptions of his general
appearance and well-being. He is, according to
the latest report, “ a man of somewhat gentle,
manly appearance, and looks like a person who has
seen better days, while his face carries a look at
times which is somewhat the reverse of one of
love towards mankind generally. At the same
time his features lack any expression of that
hideousness generally attributed to the genus
hangman.” No doubt the Queensland larrikins
appreciate the honour of being walloped tiy a gen-
tleman, hut we cannot quite understand the allu-
jffion to “ better days.” Mr. Wairr is now one o
the moat prominent members of the Civil Service,
and though he may not have a seat in the Cabinet
he la already about as well known as Mr. Griffith
himself, so his best days are just dawning. Some
slight excitement has been caused, we believe, In
well-informed circles, by the new official’s custom
of carrying an umbrella, the impression having
got about that he is In the habit of flogging his
patients with the gingham, but this rumour Is
entirely without foundation. In fact, to use up a
silk umbrella on the back of a bull-hide larrikin
would ha a sinful extravagance of which no sen-
sible man could ha guilty, and to judge from some
of tbe reports from Bananaland, if such a system
were adopted it would be necessary for Mr. Wairr
to carry a balloon-parachute, as no smaller
weapon would meet the emergency.

Hamo Thornycroft, the London sculptor,
is at woi*k on a statue of General Gordon, late of
Khartoum, and Mr. Murray Smith, who takes a
great interest in stone and wooden heads of all
kinds, has kindly forwarded a description of the
petrified hero. In his present condition, it appears,
he is habited in a long undress tunic, with a field-
glass slung over his shoulder, and a far-away look
In his eyes. His loft foot rests on a “disused
cannon,” while his right Is placed on top of the
vegetable-mould which forms the surface dressing
of this vale of tears. All this may be very satis-
factory to Murray Smith, but nobody else is likely
to get enthusiastic about it. General Gordon went
to the dark and goat-infested continent to jump
on an active prophet, and the British taxpayer
found the money for the live meat soldier on that
occasion. Now he is requested to pay for a stone
warrior as well, who is treading on a cannon in-
stead of on a prophet, and is expected to be
charmed with the far-away look in the rocky eyes
of his new graven image. Surely this statue busi-
ness Is getting about played out. If it goes on
much longer there won’t be room for live people
to walk about without jostling against all sorts of
quartz celebrities on stumpy pedestals.
A QUESTION OF FINANCE.
Poor sheep without a shepherd I Poor souls with
none to save!
With none to bring glad tidings of a life beyond
the grave;
Our bosom aches with pity as we think of your
mischance—
But be patient, and remember ’tls a question of
finance.
If funds had been forthcoming for to purchase
corn and oil
Wherewith to cheer your shepherd in his daily
round of toil—
If some Christian had been willing some few hun-
dreds to advance,
You would not be left lamenting. ’Tls a question
of finance.
Though the Master of your pastor had not where
to lay His head,
Yet his servant (and all servants) must be nicely
housed and fed;
He can’t get grub from ravens, like the Prophet
of romance, *
And to fix him up with comforts is a question of
finance.
Though the layman may need little, very little,
here below,
Yet ’tls money makes the Gospel (as It makes the
mare) to go;
And a parson is a puppet who is disinclined to
dance,
If the wires be not gilded. ’Tls a question of
finance.
So, boar up, friends and brethren, though your
road is rather rough,
You still may find salvation, if you’ll only find the
"stuff”;
Then the eye of Christ’s disciple will not look at
you askance—
Oh I the Church’s one foundation is that little word
" finance.”
But, if so be it happens that you cannot raise the
gold
To engage another shepherd, you will never reach
the fold;
For at Heaven's Gate St. Peter (with a disapprov-
ing glance)
Will refuse you, saying sadly—" ’Twas a question
of finance.”
TO THOSE PRINCES.
What is that end 1 We know a swell
Or two by duns much harassed,
Who seem to rub on pretty well
In life, although embarrassed ;
Some princes, as the whole world knows,
Drop coin at speculations—
Yet, does the British bank foreclose
And sell their lofty stations ?
Sweet twaddlers, guilders little youths
(In gilt-edged volumes jotting
A hoard of moral business truths
You gathered while globe-trotting),
Remember this—the man who toils
For riches e’en may lose ’em;
But he who grabs a people’s spoils
Quite nonchalantly “blues” ’em.
" The end the same /” The one comes down
To ruin and starvation,
The other—God preserve the Crown I—
Comes down upon the nation.
The busy bees may go too far
And lose their store of honey,
But drones, like you and your papa,
Shall never want for money.
(To conclude with the National Anthem.)
Political
Points
When Sir John Robertson resigned, Mu&gee
went to the Wall. ,
Judging by present appearances, J. P.
Abbott is likely to be leadibg a Protectionist
Government in N.S.W. one of these days.
The Sydney Daily Telegraph has lost all
confidence in Mr. Barton as Speaker. He has not
lost confidence iatheD.T. asa paper. He never
had any.
Mr. See, M.P., says he ought not to be ex-
pected to find brains for Sir Henry Parkes. Cer-
tainly not; at least, not till he has supplied him-
self.
8ir Henry Parkes applauds Sir Graham
Berry’s consistent advocacy of Protection. Now,
who will step up and applaud Sir Henry for his
consistent advocacy of anything ?
Sir Henry Parkes says he “ always denies
himself everything that he likes.” That is only
half of it. He denies himself when anything of his
record that he doesn’t like Is quoted against Min.
The Maoleay Argus says that a lot of
selections are taken up at the Kempsey Lands
Office at the inspiration of dummymongers. It
avers that from 30 to 50 dummies have lately
selected.
“ One word more,” said Dan. O’Connor,
and he proceeded to say it. The “ one word ”
contained 3,967,318 syllables, and the strangers’
gallery solemnly filed out before he had got one
quarter through.
E, W. O’Sullivan, M.L.A., swore he would
pass the N.S.W. Customs Duties Bill, or keep the
House sitting till " Hell was frozen over.” His
next move Is for a tax on agricultural produce,
for which at least 65 members will vote.
Whatever Harold Stephen’s faults may be
he is a good Liberal. For over seven days Jbe
had been singing "The Marseillaise” and otherwise
girding himself for the Protectionist battle, but
when the crisis came, he—simply went into a fit.
The Sydney Herald reporter gave Mr. J.
B. Neild a straight drive over that Goulburn Free-
trade speech. Tho oration was out down to a
dozen lines, and then aline inserted, alleging that
as Mr. Neild continued orating until after 10 p.m„
other speakers were obliged to curtail their re-
marks I
The cost to the State of educating children
in the public shools of N.S.W. is £6 13s. Id. per
year, calculated unon the average attendance.
This is a big slice of Socialism. The rate is £110s.
higher than that of any other colony, and more
Than £3 above the average of English Board
schools.
An English paper censures some of the
Commons for bringing tumblers of brandy and
soda into the House and drinking them from time
to time while addressing the chair. It is different
in the N.S.W. Assembly. Members often bring in
a lot of brandy-and-soda with them, but not in a
tumbler. The member himself is generally the
tumbler.
The N.S.W. Opposition fiercely opposed
the appointaient of T. M. Slattery as Chairman of
Committees— mainly, m it came out during the
debate, because he is of the R.C, faith! However,
Mr. Gould, who was “ run ” as the rival candidate,
was defeated by a large majority. Mr. Gould, it is
explained, was put up “ beoausff his name smelt a
bit yellow.”
The children of John Pilkington, London,
were wholly without food for two days. John
could stand it no longer. He took a four-pound
fancy loaf from a baker’s barrow; he was followed
and arrested. Mr. Partridge, the magistrate, dis-
charged him, and called the attention of the re-
lieving officer to the case. Ninety years ago
John would have been transported.
The Bogan is the most expensive electorate
i’’’ N.S.W. At the general elections of ’BO, ’B3. and
’B5 it cost the country £956, £789, and £6BO for
the respective occasions. Against this must be
set the fact that Sir Patrick Jennings is a valuable
member. The total cost of a general election in
N.S.W. varies from £9009 to !£13,000. And yet
there are plenty of members dear at any price.
In Regent-street, London, on the afternoon
of Primrose Day, a correspondent counted 308
men, women, and children who wore the Beacons-
field badge. Of this number, 185 were females, 14
were coachmen, 13 footmen, 5 page boys, 3 blind
men, 1 a human sandwich, 1 a barrel-organ with
wheezy pug dog thrown In, 3 Celtic milkmaids.
About 30 were females with bleached hair and a
profusion of jewels.
Joseph Arch has failed, by 20 votes, to
secure a seat in the new House of Commons. In
his time Arch has done good service for the Eng-
lish agricultural labourer, but of late the old man
has figured as a beslaverer of the Priocejof Wales. A
sycophantic speech which he delivered at a recent
public dinner is probably accountable for Joseph’s
defeat. The newly-franchised “ Hodge ” is be-
ginning to think for himself.
Mr. Jacob Garrard, the Orangeman, and
Mr, J. 8. Hawthorne, the Reohabite, both repre-
sent the Democratic and Protectionist consti-
tuency of Balmain in the N.S.W. Legislature.
Both these gentlemen voted for the Customs
Duties BUI, but they act in concert with the
Free-trade-Parkes’ party against the Jennings’
Government. Possibly, at the next election, the
Balmainites, a large section of whom are agitating
for State encouragement to the colonial Iron in-
dustry, will got stauncher Democrats to represent
them.
The N.S.W. Education and Survey depart-
ments have a newisystem of double-entry. It has
lust been found that they, with a pleasing spirit of
generosity, have both paid the same surveyors for
the same work. Very likely the surveyors didn’t
notice the error, or if they did, simply regarded
the double payment as a sort of anticipatory
Queen’s Jubilee bonus. While the N.S.W. Go-
vernment pays twice over for work, and only re-
ceives a percentage of the money due for freight
and telegrams, It is no wonder that the Treasurer
rubs his scalp through his hair in a fierce struggle
to wipe out that million or so comprising the
national shortage.
Henry George, in an article on “Home
Rule and the Land Question,” written in April
last, says “ Grattan’s Parliament—a corrupt
conclave of the ruling oligarchy, in which the
masses of the people had no representation—could
no more be resuscitated in Ireland to-day than
slavery could be re-established in America. An
Irish Parliament now must mean a Parliament in
which the landless, not the landlords, shall rule—a
Parliament which would at once address itself to
the task of abolishing landlordism. And while
nothing else than the full management of
their own affairs can satisfy the Irish demand,
any concession which falls short of that can only
increase the power of demanding more.”
The cause of Irish liberty is going to the
dogs. The people of Ashburton (N.Z) have de-
clared against it, and established an “Irish
Patriotic Union ” for the preservation of the
Empire, so Mr. Parnell may consider that his sun
has set. Ashburton is one of the largest general
stores and beer-synagogues on the Canterbury
Plains, and if the policeman and the bar-keeper,
and the old woman who sells the gritty sugar and
the sticky lollies, have all resolved to save the
Empire, no doubt the Empire will ultimately bo
saved. Perhaps, however, as the job is rather a
big one, it would be well to begin by saving that
part of tbe Queen’s dominions which is sticking on
to the roots of the local groggery, and when it
has been made quite secure, the Irish Patriotic
Union can look after the other items of the
Empire.
At the Cobar Appraisement Court the
squatters cried “ stinking fish” to their own hold-
ings to a fearful extent, and ran down the carry-
ing capacity of their runs to zero. But when the
local paper published only a part of their own
evidence, oh what a row there wasl In the sub-
sequent issues the editor wisely gave tho court a
wide berth. “ Ruin us with tna banks,” said one
irate sheopist, blaming the editor for publishing,
and not himself for swearing to, the evidence. One
pastoralist naively admitted that although he had
put 59.000 sheep on a run, the carrying oaoaoity of
which was only 30.000, it had been done to sell;
39,000 un-fbrtunate animals died of starvation to
enable one two-iegged brute to try and take
another biped in. These are the men who want re-
duction in rentals I
A very humorous dozen of Sydney men
have formed themselves into an association to
check recklessness of expenditure by the Govern-
ment and put the colony straight in the matter of
revenue and several other things. Judging from
the mental calibre of these doughty reformers we
prophesy their possession in the very dim future
of power in the political world, just about equal
to that now possessed by Brickhiil’s Baby or the
little boy at Manly. Mr. G. N. Griffiths, who was
once member for East Sydney, takes a front place
in the show. Mr. J. Armstrong, a man of much
weight and repute—for his weight—at the Bar,
and Mr. G. W. Tate, a butter-trade Demosthenes,
with several other men of equal importance, have
also their assistance to this magnificent move-
ment. Sir Patrick Jennings is unconcerned so
far, but Mr. Dibba is said to be haunted by visions
of the outcome of this gigantic storm in a re-
markably small tea-cup.
Mr. Wall, the new Mudgee (N.S.W.) mem-
ber, has given notice of a useful motion for the
6th August. Its effect will be to make land-
owners, who obtain permission from the Crown to
work mines on their own ground, subject to the
same conditions as to labour as apply to other
mineral leases. Unless some such motion is
passed, the “right” which the State reserves to
minerals contained in any land of which the sur-
face has been alienated wili be but a shadow.
Owners who obtain the right to mine on their
own lands under the present state of the law, will
be able to reserve the mineral* indefinitely unless
direct provision is made to block the little game.
Mr. Wall promises to be an acquisition to the House.
The motion above-noted is distinct from that also
in his name seeking to proclaim the whole colony
a mining area, so that lands taken up thereafter
may be subject to the conditions of tbe 45th sec-
tion of the 1884 Land Act, with respect to all
minerals as well as gold.
Mr. Abigail, M.P., claims credit for expos-
ing the N.S.W. railway frauds. The country
accords him all due kudos, but the Bulletin
holds that this Is also the time to gratefully re-
member the manful efforts made by Mr J. P.
Garvan, the present Minister of Justloe, to prevent
Mr. Wright (now charged with defrauding the
Government) from assuming office as N.S W.
Minister of Works at a time when he (Mr. W.)
was still head of the big railway-carrying firm of
Wright, Heaton and Co. Mr. Garvan then made
no personal Imputation against Mr. Wright—he
merely contended that no man could fairly serve
two masters-(his firm and his country)—ln cases
where the interests of the two might clash; that
no man co uld be a competent j udge in his o wn cause
—and that to put the most honourable of men into
a position where he might have to decide between
the claims of the State Treasury and of his own
breeches-pocket, would be to place an undue and
possibly breaking strain on human honesty. The
public should remember, also, that the S.M.
Herald vehemently opposed Mr. Garvan and up-
held the impudent position assumed by Mr. Wright’s
ao-calied friends on the occasion. All of which goes
to show that it is invariably better to champion a
principle than to support an individual. The
Bulletin has no wish to prejudge the case of Mr.
Wright, but it contends that that gentlemen, whose
unimpeachable honesty was affirmed at a public
banquet where he was presented with plate which
he said he would hand down to his family as an
heirloom, would now be enjoying a more peaceful
time had he never been Minister of Works
It is asserted that a private speculator has
offered to pay the N S W. Government £lOOO ayear
for a lease of the Jenolan Caves. This comes of
letting a Sydney mayor go round there on a visit
of inspection. His report on them in the Sydney
D.T. was funny enough to make a man pay £lOOO
a year just simply for the privilege of going there
to work out humorous items for Abigail’s
the Christian World. But the offer Is really
worth consideration. “ Jerry ” Wilson now gets
£2OO a year for seeing that the oaves don’t run
away, and as he holds a monopoly of aceommoda-
tlon, his billet should be as profitable as sheepsteal-
ing, and but little less lucrative than trucking wool.
It may be objected that If a mere speculator got
hold of the oaves, he might run them for all they
and the visitors are worth, whereas Mr. Wilson
is famed for the pure philanthropy of his dealings
with tourists, but this objection can hardly carry
any weight. Visitors to the caves should expect
to be charged full rates, and it is not likely that a
private owner would fleece patrons, any more than
Jerry Wilson does at present.
It is astonishing what a big grip of the
butt-end ®f universal truth a N-S.W. member gets
whemhe is boosted Into the billet of Minister for
Lands. Mr. Copeland is no exception. Among hla
more recent inspirations Is the discovery that
leased land ought to be worth Gd. an acre at the
very least—no, lowest—we have no wish to compete
with J. B. Neild In the bad pun line—as it would
produce £1 an acre if sold. There is a lot of trhth
in this proposition. The land ought to be worth
Gd. an acre rent, but, unfortunately, It isn't. Then,
too, if sold. It would return £1 an acre, but, un-
luckily, no one will buy most of it at half that
rate. And, further, although it would produce £1
ultimately, the present value of the purchase-
money would be very much less than that. Only
3s. is paid down by the selector, who then generally
gets three or four years’ intermission, at the end
of which time he pays the balance, with 4 per cent.
Interest added, by yearly Instalments. Mr. Cope-
land is about as smart as they make them for the
N.S.W. Assembly, but his genius broke.up when
he rose to the magnitude of this Crown lease
question.
The Melbourne Herald, which is run by
an Irish gentleman who considers it good business
on all occasions to demonstrate his loyalty, loves a
lord about as dearly as any journal In Australia.
It has j ust been gushing over ttael Duke of Cam-
bridge’s after-dinner oratory anent Imperial
federation. The dook, fioncherknow, thinks that
federation is as necessary in peace as in war. and
is, in fact, “ one vast scheme of insurance/’ So
far as that goes, we quite agree with the dook. It
is a scheme of Insurance, in which the colonies
would be required to pay the annual premium,
and when any serious claim was made upon the
Home office It would probably be unable to come
up to the scratch. But we are forgetting about
the Herald. These opinions of the dock’s are
exceptionally valuable in the opinion of our little
contemporary, because “the Queen’s cousin has
been a soldier from his boyhood, and is almost ex-
ceptionally military in his ideas and prejudices.”
Dear dook 1 Even his own mother wouldn’t re-
cognise him from such a description. The very
wildest stretch of imagination cannot picture the
fat rubicund oommander-in-chief of the British
forces as a soldier. He onoe took a distant sniff at
gunpowder in the Crimea, and it so affected his
poor Anglo-German nerves that he returned home
Immediately with a minute wound, which nobody
ever knew how he got. The Duke of Connaught
is a veritable fire-eater compared with his elderly
second cousin, and this latter’e “ exceptionally
military” Ideas form the text for a Herald
leader. It is very sickening, but it is also rather
sad.
The working classes of N.S.W. are, as a
body, about the worst educated people politically
in the colonies. Just now the iron trade is in a
very depressed state, and hundreds of men are
badly in want of employment. Last week a meeting
of Ironworkers was called in the Protestant Hall,
Sydney, to take some steps to relieve the distress
existing amongst them, and from the way they
acted it was quite evident that their distress had
not taught them the necessity of adopting a pro-
tective policy in order to keep foreign labour out
of the colony. The chairman (F. P. Frankl) said
they wanted a 10 per cent, duty, and then he spoke
disparagingly of Protection. Then another speaker
referred in complimentary terms to “Honest”
John Sutherland, M.P.; another mentioned Sir
.Henry Parkes’ name, which was received with
’cheers ; Jacob Garrard, M.P., came forward and
met with a cordial reception; and little Abivall,
M.P„ was lustily cheered. One would have thought
that working men out of employment would have
kuown better. So long as they allow themselves to
be gulled in this manner so long will they remain in
their present state. What reason have they to
cheer Messrs. Sutherland, Garrard, and Abigail 2
The first-named legislator is a staunch. Free-
trader; Jacob Garrard is now acting in concert
with the Freetrade- cum- Parkes faction to
oust a Government which is just now doing the
work of the Protectionists : and little Abigail
only recently voted against ad valorem duties In
the House, besides being the henchman of Sir
Henry Parkes—the statesman who fights against
Protection, payment of members, and every other
Democratic measure. The Sutherlands, Garrards,
and Abigails are the worst enemies the N.S.W.
tradesmen have got. Such politicians are wolves
in sheep’s clothing. They have the words “work-
ing men ” always on their lips when making elec-
tion speeches, and by talking in this hi-falutin
style and promising everything they manage to
practise on the gullibility of the industrial classes
who return them to Parliament. If the working
classes allow themselves to be so easily bam-
boozled they have only themselves to blame for
their distress. It la time they were able to dis-
tinguish between their friends and their enemies.
N.S.W. TO SIR JOHN.
Jack Robertson, my jo, John,
When first we two did meet;
Your looks were dark and clustering,
Your voice was clear and sweet;
Bat now your hair is white, John,
Your voice would shame a crow,
’Twas spoiled in fighting for my cause,
Jack Robertson, my jo.
Jack Robertson, my jo, John,
You’ve won some gallant fights;
You helped to gain for me, John,
My liberties and rights:
And though you’re old and crank, John,
I’m loth to let you go,
Some younger men were better spared,
Jack Robertson, my jo.

crease has occurred in the price of wool at
home, and it is only to be expected that
prices of Woollen Goods will be higher
next winter than they are this ; so that if
any of you will be requiring
NEW BLANKETS
next winter, how much better to buy them
now, and save the inevitable increase in
price.
Those who have bought blankets from
this winter know what excellent value we
have been giving, and we feel sure that if
you do so also you will never regret it.

On dit that it is intended to start a new
cricket club, in Sydney, which will Include most
of the prominent members of the Carlton and
Warwick clubs.
The detectives, haying been so far foiled
in their efforts to root out the truth about the
North Harbour (N.B.W) mystery, Professor
Proud, thought-reader, Is going to try what he can
do. At present we are inclined to back the
mystery for all we are worth.
There must have been something exquis-
itely touching about the performance at the
opening of the “ Colinderies,” if we may judge
from the reports in the “ loyal” English press.
The great feature of the ceremony, of course, was
Mrs V. Guelph, Defender of the Faith, who was
present in state, and to whom Wales handed an
address prepared for the occasion. Victoria, how-
ever. merely looked at the document and then
threw it back, telling her son to read the internal
thing himself, or words to that effect, and Wales,
having caught the flying scroll in mid-air, read it
accordingly, in his usual gutteral Saxe-Coburg
English. Nobody male out much of the preamble,
but it was understood to contain a brief resume of
Britain’s greatness, for several times when Wales
stopped to get his second wind the Queen was
heard to say "‘Them’s my sentiments. ’ Towards
the end, however, it appeared as if trouble was
likely to ensue, for the prince had put in a remark
about the Cappadocian pig-butcher who is now
supposed to be eating pork pies on the
steps of the throne up above and guarding the
sacred destines of the Empire, and at this point
the Queen remarked audibly that Brown would
have made much the better saint of the two.
Wales stopped reading with a kind of groan, and
told his mamma that saints did not wear kilts or
show off their legs as the Gillie used to do, to
which Her Majesty retorted sharply that she be-
lieved the most of them were so skinny about the
extremities that they dare not aopear in Highland
costume. In sheer despair the Prince then turned
to Lord Salisbury and asked if he could not bring
In a Bill in the Lords for the total abolition of
Brown. He did not object, be said, to the Queen
canonising Brown’s legs, but she would Insist on
paying similar respect to the whole of his carcase.
Lord Salisbury diplomatically promised to think
over the matter, and Wales hurried through the
rest of the address to avoid further interruption.
Then the Q ueen rose, and extending her arms
solemly feather-bedded herself on to the Prince
and looked over his shoulder after the manner of
a stage-embrace. Edward the 7th-that is to say,
Albert the First - tottered two or three times as
his mother came against him, and when Her
Majesty retired he was carried out insensible by
two dukes and th c parish beadle, while the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury prayed in the background,
and the ceremony of opening the Colonial and
Xndi8 n Exhibition came to an end.

Mr. L. R. Shewell’s “ Shadows of a Great
City” was the piece presented at the Sydney
Theatre Royal on Saturday last. Author and
drama are new to these latitudes, but are laid to
be well and favourably known In the land of the
Stars and Stripes. The great city referred to in
the title of the play Is New York. The shadows
are the troubles which beset a mother and
daughter. The title does not fit closely. As In the
drama of "’The Crimes of Paris,” with which the
play has some features in common, it suggests
more than is realised. Annie Standlsh marries
against her father’s will. Her husband dies and
leaves her destitute. With her baby, she is sent to
a gaol hospital. Her father at last, dying, be-
queaths his wealth to her, and makes one George
Benson her guardian. She dies. Benson, through
a pawnbroker and a gaol-bird, seeks to have the
baby destroyed. An honest fellow, Tom Cooper,
throws the gaol-bird into the bay and saves the
child. When the child grows up, Benson tries to
win her hand, but the honest fellow again inter-
poses and marries her- The gaol-bird informs on
the pawnbroker and Benson, and the pair of vil-
lains come in for their dessert.
♦ * ♦
Mits Agnes Thomas played the dual part
of Annie and Helen Standisn. Her visit to the
gawnbroker’s was g painful piece of acting. She
as great eyes for dying with, or looking unwell
with, or being destitute with. But It is one thing
to fet about dying In the beginning of a drama,
before anjone has come to care about the person,
and another to die at the end when everybody Is
interested. Everyone Is sorry when Antoinette,
in the play of that name, dies, but no one is sorry
for Vladimir. Wnlle dying as Annie Standlsh, Miss
Thomas was, therefore, an lilliotion, necessary
for ulterior purposes, as dying no doubt always is,
but possessing no claim on any special sympathy.
Hence her work was hard. 11 was a relief for her
to arise again as the full-grown daughter of her
dead first part. Her cheeks were no w red and her
movements elastic. We have not seen Miss
Thomas every time she has appeared on the stage,
the last character we remember her taking
being that of Anne Chute in Bouoloauit’s “Colleen
Bawn.” But then, as now, she looked to bo a little
out of the atmosphere of her work. Her abilities
are manifest, but though she labours studiously,
she carries an appearance of disaisoclatlon from
these around her.
* * *
Mr. Anson and Mr. Philip Book were the
villains. The one was Abe Nathan, a Jewish
pawnbroker, and the other George Benson, an
indigent and unscrupulous gambler. Both charac-
ters were well played, but neither was strong.
Mr. Beck was the weak copy of himself as the
Vlscomte de Vlsmcs, the part In which he first
appeared on his arrival In Sydney. Probably
Merritt made De Vismes like Shewell’s Benson,
or vice versa. Only that Jim Parren was in part a
fool he might be called a villain also. This charac-
ter was taken by Mr. J. C. Williamson. Mr.
Williamson deserves to have great things ex-
pected from him. He possesses the enviable
privilege of having the choosing of his play and
the choosing of his part. More than average suc-
cess is therefore looked for. In this case the
result la not striking. While Jim Farren is a fool
he is amusing. Years of gaol life destroy the
folly but put nothing interesting Instead. He
is in and out throughout the play, as the
instrument for clearing up difficulties, tut
as conceived or as acted he was not worth
the . powder spent on him. Mias Maggie
Moore placed Biddy Ronan well in front. Fine
abilities were liberally given to the making-
up of-the talkative, audacious, and kind-hearted
IristfAboathonse-woman. Something nearly real
wastoroduced. But it was far from being the size
of the actress. Miss Moore's best qualities were
not wanted in it.
« « •
There Is a good deal of variety in this new
play. It abounds In incident. It developes some
navel situations. It allows the introduction of
an exquisite panoramic' 1 view cf the harbour of
Netf York. But it wants firm coherence. It is
destitute of vivid power. Little in it appeals to
the imagination. Little in it lays siege to the
emotions. It taps no new source of thought. It
directs to'no new line of speculation. It is a dra-
matic mediocrity splendidly staged and excellently
acted.
* * *
Owing to an unexpected combination of
circumstances, we arrived at the Sydney Princess
at an unusually early hour on Monday evening,
and were therefore compelled to seek amusement
In studying the drop-soene-a combination of
light and shade which was apparently painted by
a naked artist of considerable genius shortly
before the dlscavery of Australia. On the left
this gentleman has depleted G. A. Bala’s famous
London mjhsion and a large raw cabbage, while
the right is occupied by a quartz reer which looks
as if it would pay better than Kimberley. In the
middle distance appears the rising suburb of
Woolloomooloo, and the back ground is oc-
cupied by Mount Sinai and a blue ditch. A
group of figures lends animation to the scene.
Tne most prominent of the party is Balaam riding
a cab-horse, while Sir Henry Parkes, dressed In a
red waistcoat and with his trousers rolled up to his
knees, is coming up behind and asking for his vote
on the Orange ticket at next election. One or two
prominent members of the N.S.W. Opposition,
attired in Hebrew football costumes, are sitting
on the gable-end of a brick by the roadside, and a
thin Privy Councillor, covered with red dust, ob-
trusively exposes his legs at the rear of the gor-
geous caravan.
* * *
The performance of the Buffalo minstrels
was not an unusually long one, but we wished we
were dead several times before It was completed
This was solely owing to the witticisms of the cor-
ner men, most of their j okes being overgrown with
a literary fungus which betrayed their extreme
old age. As is usual with this company, the skele-
ton of the remote Moses was dug up and a shiny
nigger perched himself on the prophet’s tomb-
stone and defiled his grave with Boeotian puns
regard!' g the hair which he wore in the wilder-
ness. The “Old Polks’ Jubilee,” too, was merely
the funeral of a decomposed comedy,(but the ting-
ing was good throughout, and served to show
that life is not all bald-headed woe. Mr. Fred
Turner signalised his first appearance by giving
"A Light in the Window,” and his light was so
extensive that It might have been mistaken for
the eruption of a glazed volcano. Finally the
“Gaffers of the Gang” brought down the house,
and concluded an entertainment which for re al
amusement is decidedly better than getting drunk
and spending the night among devils and assorted
snakes In the lock-up.

“His Natural Life,” at the Sydney Royal
Standard, is shortly to die a natural death, and In
a few days the convicts will fold up their tents
and steal away. During the present week Gabbett
still continues to eat his fellow-creatures as be-
fore, but he ia no doubt getting tired of a diet of
hashed Smith or stewed Jenkins, and will be glad
to put away his cannibal billy and return to the
habits of civilisation. So far, however, the piece
shows little sign of waning popularity, and the
only complaint we have yet heard came from
three diminutive dudelets in the dress-circle,
whese combined brains seemed about equal to
those of one weak-minded bank-clerk. Each of
Ice trio was pining away In the centre of
a lonely Sahara of collar, and they looked
out at the stage from the middle of this
linen wilderness like a sphinx with an em-
balmed eyeglass glaring across the Egyptian
sands. At last, however, a voice issued from
the centre of the starched desert, and said theSe
memorable words —“By Jove, these convict fel-
lahs are awful vulgah,” and with that the party
retired. It must be admitted, in justification of
their wrath, that such a piece as “ His Nature.
Life,” is rather rough on our leading aristocrats.
A family, which traces its origin from remote an-
tiquity, has generally a hereditary spectre of some
kind to roam through its aneestral halls, but a
banshee in yellow knee-breecheakad striped stock-
ings, who remarks in hollow accents, “ A worry
good thing, teo,” or a goblin murderer, Who is filed
up In the cellar at midnight, and flogged by a spirit
warder armed with the ghost of a worn-out
“cat,’must be a very distressing piece of pro-
perty to own. Probably it was some such reflec-
tion as this which grieved the three collars, and
made them retire in sorrow.
*# * *
At Sydney Opera House “The Private
Secretary” continues to draw well, though that
persecuted man complains nightly that he js "so
awfully hungry.” His bath-bun Is confiscated
with unfailing regularity by his Imaginary uncle,
his bottle of milk Is degenerating Into butter and
slush, and he is biffed on the head whenever he
attempts to got a surreptitious bite at his stale
orange; so, it would appear that the lot of a secre-
tary in a good old English family is not a very
cheerful one. The only change worth noting is ia
Mr. Sydney Gibson, who appears to get more
inebriated and more “ hambltlous” every evening,
and there seems every probability that the un-
happy tailor will pass away to a better land amid a
halo of alligators and blue snakes, unless he're-
forms his ways. We would be much obliged to
Mr. Gibson, by the bye, if he would send along the
new suit we ordered from him a week ago; punc-
tuality In this matter will go a long way towards
redeeming his character for steadiness and so-
briety.
** * *
The Federal Minstrels, at Sydney Aca-
demy, have not improved matters much by taking
off “Castor Oil,” but, on the other hand, there Is a
certain gratification In noting that the picture of
N.B.W, dispensing porous-plasters to the Ly-ee-
Moon has also disappeared and will trouble the
sons of man no longer. The singing Is as good as
usual, and the jokes are hardly bad enough to
lead a coroner’s jury to return a verdict of justifi-
able homicide, but the strongest point in the
entertainment is a burlesque on the society drama
“Clothilde.” This piece presents a striking re-
semblance to the “Corsican Brothers,” but the
twins have been silt down the back and only one
half of the pair is present. Clothilde, the heroine,
is an artless cow-nigger, who plays with the cafs-
tail (and makes the negro pussy yowl behind the
sdenes until an avalanche of Ethiopian sorrow
descends upon her and rends her Innocent
heart asunder. She is engaged to Victor, a
sleek and shiny African, but just before her
wedding-day, an evil genius turns up In the shape
of a former husband, a vengeful black Italian,
with an episcopal hat and a tragic glare in Ms wall
eye, whom Clothilde had married while unner the
controlling influence of drink. The scene of re-
crimination that ensues brings the heroine to
such a state of prostration th&t she has to be re-
vived with beer, and leads the servant with the
patched trousers to faint seven times. Finally,
the lover and the husband meet with swords in
the midst of a snowstorm, and having taken off
eight coats and three waistcoats, they fight a duel,
which ends fatally for the former. The black
Italian afterwards kills his wife and her sister, his
father-in-law, the two seconds, and the surgeon,
and stands about in a careless attitude, looking
at the pile of corpses, till an indignant Providence
throws a bit zing wooden thunderbolt at his head.
This weapon misses its mark, but the Corsican
twin gazes thoughtfully at it for five minutes,
and then, suddenly comprehending that it was
meant for him, dies standing, and is turned into a
pillar of blacking as a warning and an example to
his fellow sinners.

The Widow O’Brien, at Sydney Gaiety, is
fast attaining ths age of a burlesque fossil, but
the good lady will continue to excite the laughter
of her friends even after she takes her place
among the petrified Irishwomen of the past. Her
18st. of solid brogue and beauty now receive ad-
ditional support from the presence of Mr. Dudley
Reid, the Engiifh cartoonist, and Mr. Arthur
Gordon, a remarkably clever mimic, while one or
two comic sketches help to keep things moving.
Mr. Reid promises to be a favourite, being able to
draw anything from a buliock-dray down to an
inference or a cook on the shortest notice, and
he can make notes and amusing remarks at the
same time. Life] is too short to permit of
our doing full justice to the entertainment, but
unless prevented by sudden death we will endea-
vour to give Mr. Stieildan’s company a more ex-
tended notice on some future occasion.

The frescoed walla of Sydney Alhambra
i look down nightly on the teeming myriad forma
of human mould which gather witbin those pre-
cincts adorned with the Thespian art and sancti-
fied by song. This is our picturesque way of say-
ing that no matter how many Salvation Army
meetings or dog-lights may be going on outside,
the Alhambra is always well filled. The pro-
gramme Is an olla podrida of all the sentiments
and emotions, terminating with a farce Inlwhioh a
stage club, and something to sit tfpon, are con-
spicuously prominent. Millions in It,”
is the name of this morceaji, and, as Frank Smith
gazes upon the assembled chorus, he gratefully
murmurs the same thing of the theatre— 41 There’s
mlllionS’ln it.”

Even without taking any notice of the
Sydney churches, there are lots of worse places of
amusement In the city than Cottier’s “ Pops” at
the Protestant Hall These are run with unfailing
regularity every Saturday and Monday night, and
the show ia such as to roll a buoyant billow of
blest oblivion over the soul-rending sorrows of a
wearying world. The cheapness of the tariff is
not tne most notable feature of the entertainment,
and there is neither word nor gesture uttered or
expressed which would Ming the blush of buffeted
modesty to the cheek of the sensitive school-girl.

“A Mad Marriage,” written by Frank
Harvey, and now being played at Briiban© by Mr.
W. J. Holloway’s company, gets notices redolent
of oleomargarine from the local critics. Essie
Jenyns, Nlta Steele, Alice Deorwyn, and Marian
Merris are all in the cast, so we with cynical sus-
picion attribute a lot of the eulogy to their ador-
able presence.

The result of the efforts of the Sydney
theatrical amateurs in the cause of the Ly-ee-Moon
fund was £ll3lls. 3d. After paying £3O for the
Gaiety Theatre, and £l5 to Mr. B. N. Jones for
supervising rehearsals, the net amount ia £77113.

Those talented performers who are Sum-
mer field young men in the daytime, but emerge
into the full glory of Davenport Minstrels upon
completion of the vespernal meal, slung a big
supply of their musical and histrionic stock upon
the stage-counter for public approval on Thurs-
day night. Things went on as though made to
order, and the business was nicely fitted to tfe
performers. We always thought there was the
inspiration of heroism in kid gloves at Is. 9d., and
the pathos of poetry In pants.

Sir Henry Loch and the members of the
Ministry went to Melbourne Royal last week to
see “ His Natural Life.” This was a delicate mark
of respect for Lord Rosebery’s judgment in
literary matters. When he visited Australis,
Rosebery "took up ” the memory of poor Marcus
Clarke, and since then, the dead author has found
dozens of professing admirers in men who sneered
at him in life. Not but what there have been
members of Victorian Ministries with some ex-
cuse for tabooing “ His Natural Life,” and sena-
tors whom wild horses couldn’t drag to a repre-
sentation of the play. The work is altogether too
historical to please their families. It is only fairly
due to the Gilliea-Dsakln crowd to say that they
looked on the convicts without flinching, or turn-
ing a hair. Neither did(the Governor betray any
symptoms of suppressed emotion. As for the
gallery boys, they had learned to love Gabbett like
a father.

Mr. Walter Henry Wallace, the haeter—
just now of the Melbourne Opera House—appears
to be even better fun “ off than he id on the
stage. The other night he was strolling quietly
home, about 3 30 a m., rehearsing a part in a minor
key, and emphasising the points with an umbrella.
This led to an altercation with a matter-of-fact
myfmidon of the law. The policeman said: “ Get
along home,” and then somebody fell down. It
was Wallace. With the dauntless courage of a
stage hero, he announced his Intention of taking
the policeman’s number. “ Kill me if you will,”
says Wallace, “ but that number shall yet be
mine.” Then the policeman walked off whistling
and the comedian set about hatching a scheme
for bringing the insulter of his honour to justice.
Next night he went to the old spot In a disguised
voice, lured the policeman on to speak, identified
bis accent, and took out a summons against him.
Tho peeler got 40s. for assault, and, take It alto-
gether, his fun was cheap at the price. One of
Wallace’s speeches at the watohhouse had a true
Shakesperian ring. “Dog, how darst thou stand
’twlxt me and liberty ? ”

Bert. Willison writes us from Batavia, as-
suring all whom it may concern that the Bquesour-
rioulum Is doing superfine business In those sun-
stricken regions. The company will return to
Sydney about Get. 1, with several new animals,
Including monkeys, tigers, and a band of Javanese
performers. The show, with its Sydney accessions,
will then be known as Fryer, Gayland, and Fitz-
gerald's Cirque, Museum, and Menagerie—which
name should alone be sufficient to captivate the
dollars of the million.

The “ Silver King” company are doing a
good business at Charters Towers (Q.), and Thady
O’Kane, of the Northern Miner, has taken the
opportunity to drive a long nail Into the drama
and hang one of his peculiar sermons thereon,
“ The chief moral of the piece,” he says, "Is that
a fellow should never get so tight as not to know
what he Is doing,” and then later on he adds,
“ Foggon and the other sauiflebusters ought to go
and learn a lesson.” As Foggon Is a gentleman who
makes hla living by preaching and otherwise
knocking the perdition out of the scripture, this
is rather rough, and a little—j ust a little—personal

As chorus girls when they first appear in
the classic attire are prone to act upon a very
natural Impulse and bend forward in a style which
has nothing of the picturesque managers have
come to the rescue of art, and now the debutantes
are said to wear another very tight, strong, and ab-
breviated pair underneath the other ones. This is
called a “ booster ” and prevents distressed beauty
from appearlrg in shape like unto an inebriated
note of Interrogation. The idea was probably
suggested by the error of a young mother who
made her boy’s pants without any rearward slack,
and then had the gratification of seeing him
boosted over whenever he tried to pick up any-

ONE PHASE OF PROTECTION.—THE PROTECTION OF THE POLICE.
“It is an open Recret that, during the last few days, the N.S.W. Colonial Treasurer and Colenial Secretary have both received letters, threatening their lives, from persons
who, by the tenor of their epistles, are Freetraders. That to the Colonial Secretary is a particularly wild production. The writer states, inter alia, that he is tired of his
life, but before he dies he intends to kill Mr. Dibbs.— Daily, Paper.

responded the menial.
“That’s exactly what she
dashed well Is.”
She was an elderly
widow, and although she
had not had much to do
with paisons in her life,
one was now attending
her bedside. After he had
been soothing her for
some time, she said :
“Fancy, In a few hours

A Chainman’s grievance. “Dear Bul-
letin,—l am engaged in Sydney, by a Government
surveyor, ts chainman, at £1 per week and my
food. I find that the Government daily allow-
ance for each chainman is ss. 3d., i.e., 365. 9d. per
week. Of this, I receive £1 in cash, and am
charged 16s. 9d. for food which, honestly speaking,
is not worth a cent more than Bs. (it consists of
bread, meat, tea, and an alleged pudding thrown
in occasionally), so that we—l and the other man
in camp-conclude that our employer unjustly
makes out of us Bs. 9d. per week per man. It
seems to me, that even if our food be put down
at the extravagant value of 10s. per week each,
we should be paid the balance between the total,
£1 10a., and the £1 16s. 9J. allowed by Govern-
ment. At the end of the month, blank voucheis
are handed us to sign; we sign for sa. 3d. per day,
but, as I have explained, only get in cash a frac-
tion over 3s. 10d. per day. Is this the fair thing—
and is it permitted by “ the office ? ” Is not our
employer “ having ” either us pot r devils or the
Government of his bleeding country ?- Yours,

A good many Australians seem to be still
clinging desperately to the hope that “Wales” may,
after all, import his duty-free anatomy here next
year, and they are already growing loyal carrots
and Imperial beans to weave into triumphal arehes
over his head. The Mayor of Adelaide is one of
the most earnest of those who await the tread of
the royal goloshes upon colonial soil, and he is still
frantically writing letters to similar officials all
over Australia asking them to get up an excite-
ment on the subject. Among others, he has
routed up the general storekeeper who greases the
municipal wheels at Rockhampton (Q.), and has
apparently convinced that misguided man that
H.R.H. will visit his dreary pumpkin-flat so that
it is necessary to prepare a welcome. Accordingly
the Council called upon the town-surveyor to
furnish plans, specifications, and estimates for a
“ burst of enthusiastic loyalty,” a “cordial recep-
tion,” and an “ expression of heartfelt devotion,”
respectively. The harassed official sent in his
figures at last meeting, and, after some discussion,
it was resolved to have the “burst” as being the
more elegant of the three, and it is now being pre-
pared accordingly.
At Cooktown (Q.), a dinner was recently

if j . .. „ ,
it is \ ery sad that the Sydney D.T. cannot
get a single political idol that is good for more
tnan a month's adoration, or a political demon to
denounce for more ttan a like period, but such,
aias is the lamentable fact. Pro'ectlon was once
a thing which this delirious daily offered sacrifice
unto, but there came an end to this worship, and,

mighty as soon as the D T. lifted up an indignant
voice against it. And so with Sir Henry Parkes.
has be en alternately blasnhemed and applauded,
and his popularity has waxed and waned just in
inverse ratio to the commendation of the King-
street oracle. Likewise the Speaker, Mr. Barton,
Only a very short time since the Telegraph cried
out, ‘ Ecce Homo! behold the coming Premier I ’
But he didn’t come, he just stayed where he was.
And now the organ of hysteiios has discovered
that the idol is a very bad lot. Indeed, politically
speaking. He evinces, the Daily Shhiek asserts,
“ a tendency to stietch and strain to breaking-
point the powers of the House over individual
members and over minorities.” and by his late
action has closed his career as Speaker. That any
decision from the chair should have been against
the minority, which the D.T.; now loves, is quite
sufficient to account for the jeremiad against Mr.
Barton. The present idols of the Telegraph are
the venerable but not much venerated Parkes, the
masher Neild with his everlasting “mag,” the
Fonetik Frawnsis, who is an Orangeman first and
anything that’s going afterwards, and the rest of
the senseless obstruction orators—these be the
D.T. gods now, and all who do not fall down and
worship them are to be utterly detroyed. We are
really sorry for the poor little paper. It has gone
so far as to call upon A. G, Taylor to come and
help the oppressed minority, but AG. knows
better. His convictions are with the other side,
and he knows also that a single leader in favour
of any man, any cause, or any party, is quite
sufficient to blast any prospects of success that
there may previously have been. The political
death-warrant is signed when that ill-omened
paper breaks forth into praise of anything. If the
D.T. really wants to retain the bastard system of
Freetrade until lately in vogue here, it should
commend Sir Patrick and support Protection.
One leader on such lines would leave the Premier
with a sad and sorry following; a second would
squelch Protection utterly: and a third one, cover-
ing Sir Henry Parkes with abuse as with a gar-
ment, woqld bring him back to the TrcßSury
benches in triumph. Here is a magnificent oppor-
tunity for the Telegraph to exhibit its much-
vaunted patriotism. If our hint is taken. Sir
Patrick and the ad valorem duties will go down to
one common destruction.

Crfhsn, anchor of “ afQT
staid part author of *« -
F»war» ft. Golb, Book Arcade
nd ? ” A novel, by I. Reginald
Stanhope,” ‘‘Loch Ard,” &c.;
“ Give it a Name/’ Sydney:
Professor Tucker, of Melbourne, is intro-
ducing a bran-new way of pronouncing Latin,
and he means to show Julius Caesar how to speak
language. One great feature in the Pro-
fessor’s style seems to he the substitution of “ w ”
fog “r” and “v,” so that we are led to Imagine
Pompey and Cato must have suffered se verely from
cofd in the head, which might account for them
talking that way. Probably the old Boman dude,
like the modern Australian one, used to come home
“ corned,” and kick up no end of a shindy at his
boarding-house, and then at breakfast, in the
morning, he would crane his neck oyer bis tall
Latin collar, and ask of bis next neighbour, in clas-
sical language, “ Did you heah that awful “ wow”
last night ? ”
“How Will it End?"
“ How Wlll it End ?” by Mr. I. Reginald Cohen,
of Sydney, is not one of those novels which are
likely to be rushed by an admiring public. It
possesses many beauties and many defects, but
the beauties are mostly in the binding, while the
defects are inside. We have met Mr. Cohen on at
least one previous occasion in connection with a
sinful waste of printer’s ink, and the Interest
which he aroused was chietiy on account of his
mysterious initial. Presumably it represents the
patriarchal name of Isaac, in which case the
owner has knocked off 80 per shent of the letters
—a very liberal discount. We have read “ How
Will it End ? ” through with all possible care, but
are still unable to answer the question contained
in the title. In real life amateur authorship
generally ends in a freeae-out, or in a renewal for
three months with the indorsements of two re-
spectable householders on the back, or in a writ
of fi. fa., but Mr. Cohen’s book has really no end
at all. The story promises, like one of Mr, Nelld a
speeches, to fill up tt e realms of time and space
and hang its bloated tail over their narrow
borders Into the shadowy abyss of eternity.
Half the novel, too, might appear appropriately
as the “ Musings of an Evangelical Clergyman,”
or the “ Stutterings of a Blighted Jebusite,” while
the other half might have been sized up under
some such title as the “ Sallow Murderer of Sheol-
blaze Flat.” Every five minutes or so the author
takes his characters by the lobe of the ear and
backs them against a fence in order that he may
apostrophise them in some such manner as this;
"Tremble, viper Melville, for you have over-
reached yourself;” or “Woman, how dare you
think of him ?”—a style of address that reminds us
painfully of the Chinaman’s invocation to the
ghost of a departed ancestor: “ Spirit of ihy hog-
eyed grandmother, look down on me.” But these
interpolations have at least one advantage, for, in
the intervals thus afforded, the limping, splay-
footed narrative sits down to get its second wind,
and wait until the policeman returns to bid it
“ Move on.”
• * »
In another sense, too, Mr. Cohen acts the
part of the “bobby” to perfection, for when things
grow dull and spiritless he seizes some unoffend-
ing character by the neck and the slack of the
pants and runs him violently into the story where
he is expected to lean up against the gas-stove
and talk the same kind of hide-bound dictionary
which distinguishes the rest of the asylum. The
unfortunate who has picked the dry bones of a
fortnight-old newspaper, and is actually reduced
by intelle etualfamlne to read “ How Will it End ? ’>
must not be surprised, therefore, when the villain
says that “In the ventilation of a subject having
any tendency t® a silly ebullition of thought or
fee 11 ng I must express profound ignorance;’
this expression is merely a burlesque—or Cohen-
esq ue—on the ancient Latin phrase, “I don’t care a
tinker’s ouss.” There is a fearful sameness, how-
ever, in the dialogue, and the author’s style
is apparently made up of SO per cent. Miss
Braddon, and 70 per cent. Hop Bitters ad-
vertisement. The cultured gentleman in the
drawing-room talks Dr. Johnson, and the de-
praved ruffian, whom we encounter on “a dig-
gings,” talks Prophet Jeremiah, but the two are so
much alike that we are inclined to think at times
it was Jeremiah who wrote the dictionary, and the
snuffy doctor who was stoned to death in Egypt,
while both prophet and doctor have evidently
been edited by Mrs. ftalaprop. “Shall I risk the
criminal’s den 1 ” demands one mueh married lady ;
"she leaned her two hands on her chin in#deep
sjudy,” says Mr. Cohen of another female,’ and if-
he had also added that she had a bad cold, and that
she drank a tub of hot water, and bathed her
head in gruel, the sentiment would have been
complete. “He must implicate himself from his
own danger as best he could ” presents a really
choice specimen of blighted English; so do the
sentences “our future is wound up together,”
and “he therefore propagated the rest of his life
to the cancelling of the wrong he had done.”
• • •
But, unluckily, the author is not content
with getting impaled upon one language only; he
must needs spike himself upon half-a-dozen, and
they stt so heavily on his stomach that the results
are likely to be serious. Dog-Latin and mangy
French bulge outfin all directions, like fce shirts
protruding from an over-fed portmanteau, and
when we consider the amount of knowledge Mr.
Cohen must have contained before he penned
some of these foreign items we grow apprehensive
that he will one day split down the spine from the
pressure of internal lore. Surely not even Brick-
hill’s baby would imagine that the term bonvivant
meant “ a cultured man of the world,” or accuse
his characters of indulging in frivolous “ bandin-
age.” The latter term is, perhaps, Woolloo-
mooloo French for a bandage or a bonnet-
box or something of the kind, but it is
no pant of any civilised language except
Cohenese. In his preface, the author casts a slur
upon Australian novelists, because they delineate
“ the manners, customs, and idiosyncrasies of
bushrangers, cattle-stealers, dummies, and the
■whole famfly of adventurers,” but he has himself
delineated nothing-not evenParkes’ yellow pup.
He also explains that he has abstained, for special
reasons, from giving any definite location to the
scenes described, but he does not add—as he well
might—that he has mashed geography into a pulp-
and sawn latitude and longitude asunder in this
attempt at concealment. lathe opening chapters
the reader gets doubled up by a sudden collision
with “ one of the most successful merchants in
Australia,” and an allusion to Port Jackson leads
Mm to believe the scene is laid somewhere near
Durand’s Alley, Sydney. Later on, however, he
©ernes to a baronet’s widow who owns an ancestral
•aetle a few miles away, and this palatial structure
seems to suggest that England must be Intended.
New York, too, seems rather close at hand,
which makes the confusion worse confounded,
and finally the discovery of “a diggings” not
far distant drives the distracted victim to con-
clude that be is somewhere in New Guinea or
Patagonia. The baronet, who formerly owned the
oastle afore-mentioned, met his death at the chase,
and before he started on the fatal morning he
promised to bring his wife “ many brushes and
tails of bunted foxes,” so he evidently lived in a
land where foxes go in droves and wear a tail at
one end and a brush at the other.

Mr. Cohen’s work is weak in grammar,
orthography, and half-a-dozen other things, but
the plot is by far the weakest thing of all. The
entire story is working up from the very outset
to one tremendous climax, but no climax ever
comes. The whole book is an attempt to crush a
single wicked man, and he dies of heart-disease
after all. He is tolerably healthy, too, up till the
last moment, but the author evidently feels he is
not equal to the task before him, so he hastily
explains that the villain has long been suf-
fering from an incurable complaint, and then
squelches him like a wet rag, and all
that is left is a corpse lying on a sofa,
and a belltopper perched on a chair. All
through the novel Mr. Cohen takes time by the big
toe instead of by the forelock. He drags men
into difficulties, or makes them turn pale and drop
on top of the furniture, and then explains In an
aside to the reader that it is because they have
committed bigamy or murder some Zyears ago.
Mysterious women jump out from mysterious
corners and prove to be long-lost wives who have
been married oftener than is good for their health,
and Fate is kept busy throwing rooks at one or
two people, but the reader never knows the reason
why till afterwards. A separate and independent
story is gummed on to the original cataleptic
narrative, but the only connection between the

THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN CARD-CURSE
MRS. BROWN (to Bridget O’Hooligan, servant at Mrs. Jones's): “I LEAVE MY OWN CARD AND TWO OF MY HUSBAND’S
CARDS, AND ONE CARD FROM MY ELDEST SON, AND TWO FROM MY GRANDMOTHER. AND THREE FROM
MY SISTER-IN-LAW. PLEASE TELL MRS. JONES THAT I’M SORRY I CAN’T LEAVE THE BABY’S CARD,
BUT I’LL SEND IT AS SOON AS HE’S CHRISTENED.”
BRIDGET: “BEGORRA, IS THAT ALL?”
two appears to be that one of the characters
in the second tale is inquiring for the ad-
dress of one of the characters in the first ;
and at length the double-barrelled novel
winds up with a few touching remarks about
death, leaving four lovers still on the loose. The
book, however, presents one gratifying feature—
it is not bound in kangaroo-skin like many recent
publications, and we are glad to note this act of
forbearance, for we hate to see a kangaroe wasted.
* * *
We had almost forgotten to mention that
the book is .dedicated to the Hon. (hon. that is in
N.S.W.) Henry B. Cohen, “ with sentiments of re-
spect and esteem.” It must be admitted, how-
ever, that to dedicate such a book is a remarkable
mode of showing respect and esteem, and that a
dedication to so prosaic a lawyer as Hon. Henry
B. Cohen is a still more remarkable way of ensur-
ing an extensive sale for the novel. The Town
and Country Journal, too, has come to the
front with a tolerably favourable critique, and
praise from such a quarter is enough to damn any
author.
“An Aristocratic” Newspaper.
“PIGGING IT IN ONE ROOM!”
Vanity Fair, of 29th May, says “it is glad to see
that the Whig dukes, and other territorial mag-
nates, are beginning to realise what fools they are.
Their rage against their former idol, Gladstone,
is Inexpressibly diverting. Hartington heads a
conspiracy to pulverise it; the Duke of Argyle
knocks it off its pedestal; and even Lord Derby
musters up courage to kick the wretched image
as it rolls in the dust.” The words italicised above
let the cat clean out of the bag, and announce in
a sufficiently direct way that the “ territorial mag-
nates ’’—the great titled landed proprietors—have,
in the opinion of the fashionable Tory weekly,
abandoned Gladstone because he proposed to
burst up in Ireland a selfish and tyrannical land-
monopoly, against which the English working-
ciasses have not yet commenced to kick in earnest.
Vanity Fair goes on to say :
“ There are still about 40 Liberal trimmers who
are dark horses, and may vote either way. Ask
the waverers whether it is worth while—unless a
very substantial price is offered them—to do in-
calculable mischief both to their country and
their Party merely to gratify the vanity of their
god-Gladstone— and such a godl a god with the
appearance of an escaped lunatic, the accent of a
Lancashire labourer, the vituperative powers of
a washerwoman, and the temper of an Incarnate
fiend—who, in the natural course of things, must
shortly pass away ? When my grandfather re-
tired to another world he left me some wonderful
’Siport—the best urine I have ever drunk. Alas! I
have finished it long ago, all except two bottles.; and
these lamkeeping to cheer me up on the night when
Mr. Gladstone dies. I should be extremely re-
luotant t® be guilty of the indelicacy of hurrying
Mm from any purely selfish motive. My motives
for hurrying him are patriotic as well as selfish.
But there is no harm in my mentioning that
I hear that ’34 port is losing its colour, and
that I should be exceedingly grateful to him
if he could make it convenient to supply
me with the opportunity of drinking it. . . .
The Lunatic Asylum is really on the Job this time.
The Grand Old Gladstone’s Bill is pretty certain
to be beaten, and in that case the odds are two to
ene that he will have te be carried out of the
House of Commons in a straight-waistcoat, if he
doesn’t expire on the spot in a fit of apoplexy
brought on by senile fury. Of the two alterna-
tives, I would sooner for his sake see him take to
apoplexy, that solution of his difficulties being
both inexpensive and effectual, and certain to
keep him quiet for good. But on the other hand
he would look very pretty in a cosy, comfortable
asylum, with his eighty hats all round him, and it
would be rather fun to go and poke buns at him
through the bars on the end of an umbrella.”
Further on, the Tory pimp, Bowies, in writing of
the Deceased Wife’s Sister Bill, says ;
“ Prohibition of marriage with a deceased wife’s
sister is often a great hardship on the working
classes. If a working-man is left a widower with
a family, the duty of bringing up the children in
thousands of oases devolves upon their aunt; and
if, as often happens, they are all obliged to pig it
together in one room, the aunt and the widower
probably indulge in tha inward and spiritual grace
of matrimony, even if they are debarred from its
outward and visible sign.”
“ Compelled to pig it in one boom I” See how
tenderly, how humanely, this lofty aristocrat talks
of the misery of the workman whose wife is dead,
and who, perchance, is forced by the greedy in-
solence of the loafing privileged classes of Great
Britain to divide a stolen turnip or a parish loaf
with his starving children in the fireless room
wherein they shiver beside the pauper coffin of
their mother! ;Mr. Bowles, of Vanity Fair, Is, it
is plain, steeped to Ithe lips In the idea of, the
anoien regime that the poor should be fed on straw.
Vanity Fair writes just as wrote and talked the
“nobles” of the pre-Revolutlonary epoch in
France; and one of these fine mornings, if all the
life and fire has not been squeezed out of the
British proletariat, they will arise in their naked,
hungry might, not merely to wreck drapers’shops
and sack restaurants, as on the last occasion, tut
todecorate every spike of Hyde Park railings with
the head of a Bowles or a bishop. We trust that
the_Englieh Radical newspapers have told the
hungry men of London not to forget, when next
they assemble a hundred thousand strong, the
building wherein sits the writer who has con-
temptuously likened them, their mothers and
their sisters and children, to pigs.
The Princes’ Book!
A LITERARY FEAST FOR POTTS POINT AND
TOORAK!
The members of the German Boyal Family which
has managed to stick to the British throne for
half-a-dozen generations, and hopes to stick there
for half-a-dozen generations more, seem to have
an insatiable mania for the fame of authorship.
The Queen set the evil example by ladling out her
trashy maunderings about “Brown’s legs,” and
her touring generally; Princess Alice (who, poor
unfortunate woman, could write a tolerably de-
cent letter) was then enthusiastically trotted out;
Princess Louise followed suit; and in an exceed-
ingly retail manner, as becomes a moneygrubber,
the Duke of Edinburgh likewise poured a measure
of his Imperial soul over dreary pages. The latest
things in royal literature are the unconsequential
speeches of the epileptic Duke of Albany, edited
by the versatile YIo. herself, and the two volumes
written by the Princes who sanctified the colonies
by their presence in 1881, “carefully edited by
the Rev. J, N. Dalton,” who accompanied them on
their trip in the capacity of clerical nurse-girl.
There are some eloquent passages in the
book which must probably be ascribed to
Daltonian editing a work which probably
includes the writing of all but the royal
signatures. Thus, in the pages descriptive of the
visit to the West Indies, we come across stuff like
this:—“We should be less than Englishmen, less
than men, if we did not feel a thrill of pride while
Balling here. The air, yet even in clearest blaze
of sunshine, seems full of ghosts—the ghosts of
gallant sailors and soldiers. Truly here ” and
then follows that wormeaten old quotation about
“spirits of our fathers ” bobbing up from every
wave—on this occasion possibly to wonder who the
deuce that wooden-headed, stupid-looking young
sawney in gold lace, Albert Victor, could be?
There is a lot of unintended sarcasm about that
opening sentence. Mr. Dalton evidently forgot
for the moment that the
royal writers were not
Englishmen, but Ger-
mans, and not men—only
priggish and precocious-
youngsters. Being, there-
fore, neither English nor
men, they probably did
not feel any thrill of
pride, and as the devoted
Dalton was at hand he
probably felt it for thena-
and then wrote—that is,
they wrote, accordingly..
On the same page, the
royal diarists drift into
conundrums concerning
the mlsgovernment of
the West Indies:—
“ Was it for this,” they
ask, ''that these seas
were reddened with the
blood of our own fore-
fathers year after year?
Did all those gallant
souls go down to Hades
in vain, and leave nothing
for the Englishman but
the sad and proud memo-
ry of their useless val-
our ?”
No, your Royal High-
nesses, it was not. These
•‘gallant souls went down
to Hades” (nice way
this of saying that they
died), because a bump-
tious old German bully
who then sat on the throne
of England was jealous of
the power of the French
and Spanish rulers, and
plunged the toilers of the
British nation into mourn-
ing and debt that he
might knock the stuffing out of his royal II rivals.
That is the answer to your Highnesses’ little comm,
drums. Melbourne, according to these veracious
volumes, was founded in! 1837, and land then not
worth £1 an acre was sold in ’Bl for “ £5OO per
square foot.” This is news indeed. At this price
a block SO feet by 100 would realise exactly
£1,000,000, and a SOO by SOO block would be worth
£20,000,000. This would seem to be scarcely cor-
rect, unless real*.property in Melbourne did an
immense boom when royalty was around. Perhaps
it did. The book contains some philosophical
disquisitions which do not seem to square with
what we know or should suspect of the princes.
These observations, referring to Haytl, may serve
as an instance
“ The theories of Liberty, Fraternity, and
Equality, a heaven-sent Gospel in themselves,
have, in the way they have here been applied and
carried out, turned a Paradise of God and ‘the
cradle of the new world ’ into an Augean stable
and a very hell upon earth.”
It would be interesting to know which of the two
wrote this; whether it was the fiddle-headed
museum specimen of German humanity who be-
lieves that he will one day rule England, or the
larky, good-natured boy, his brother, who, at the
time of the voyage, probably thought a pastry-
cook’s shop the very Nirvana of his aspirations.
Notwithstanding the peculiarities of the publica-
tion, which we may briefly describe as Daltonian
in sentiment, and Guelphic in literary style,
it is probable that every sucking C M.G. will
love them even as a Mahommedan adores the
Koran; other people less enthusiastic will be in-
elined to consider that Mr. Dalton only half did
his work—after editing the book as he has done he
should have edited it into the Thames, It would
1 have sunk.

Flvedock (N.S.W.) has started a debating
society to grapple with the questions which para-
lyse the world at the present period. As ladies are
admitted to debate, it was natural that the bent of
their reflections should be followed In the selec-
tion of subjects, so the society first worried the
important theme, “Flirting, its usee, methods, and
results.” Much valuable information was con-
tributed, and the feeling of the meeting seemed to
be that this institution should be revered with a
deep reverence, and the meeting made an early
adjournment to collect fuller information. “ The
Dress of Gentlemen,” was next discussed, and a
strong opinion expresses that “a tail-coat with-
out a crinny was an utter absurdity,” and that the
vest of the period was incomplete without a frill.
Flvedock has thrown a tow-line to the van of pro-
gress this time, and is likely to make itself the
very hub. of the social wheel unless the female
conspirators take to stonewalling. “ Are Bings
Beautiful ?” will be the theme for an early sitting,
and a soul-stirring discussion on spring bonnets
will subsequently eventuate.

think that Hennlker would try to palm off a
Bennett as a peeress; that would be too huge a
lark. At the same time, though, It seems not at
all unlikely that Hennlker may some day manage
to pass off a Heaton as a peer, which would be
playing it still lower on England’s old nobility.

That aristocratic corps, the Lanoeahs, are,
we notice, playing “ the very doose ” with Sydney
sassiety. Thus, one reads in the suburban (New-
town) Independent, under the title “ Hymenial
(by and bye people will be spelling it “ High-
menial”) the following exquisite little yarn:—
On Wednesday evening, 14th inst., the mar-
riage of Mr. George Draper (of the firm of Tabrett
and Draper, timber merchants and builders, St.
Peters) to Miss Minnie Day, fourth daughter of
George Day, Beq., of Nambuooa River, and sister
of Mrs. Marcus Clark, took place at Victoria
House, King-street, Newtown. The ceremony
was performed by the Rev. Mr. Troy, of the
Christian Church, Sydney. About 80 guests were
present, including the bride and bridegroom s
most intimate friends and acquaintances, and the
elite of Newtown. The new part of Victoria
House was converted into a dining-room fcO feet
lOng, and a table was erected in the centre, ex-
tending from end to end, and was beautifully and
tastefully laid out for the occasion. The catering
was entrusted to a local firm, and was carried out
satisfactorily. Mr. George Draper is one of the
oldest members of the Sydney Lancers, and is also
one of the Governor s escort, Lord Oarlngton
being colonel of the regiment. In consideration
of these circumstances, Mrs. Clark sent an invita-
tion to Lord and Lady Carington to be present at
the ceremony. A reply was received from Lord
Cirington, stating that they felt sorry at not being
able to accept the invitation owing to the pres-
sure of other impartant business, but wished the
oouole every happiness In their future life. An
invitation had also been sent to Mr. Quong Tart,
who made a very courteous reply, stating that
owing to previously fixed engagements he was
unable to attend.” Yegodsl

Mr. and Mrs. T. Lakeman gave a delight-
ful dance to a company of about 150 in the Odd-
fellows’ Hall, Church-street, Waverley, on
Tuesday evening, the 13th. De Groen’s excellent
band, a large number of smart dresser, an elegant
supper, and the indefatigable efforts of the host
and hostess, all contributed to the perfect success
of one of the pleasantest balls ever held at
Waverley. The hostess wore a magnificent robe
of deep claret velvet trimmed with real Limerick
lj.ce, bodice cut low, sleeves short, and long train.

Thousands will join in sympathising with
Sir John Robertson in his hour of bereavement.
Just as he had retired from the toil and strife of
politics, his daughter, Mrs. Harry Gllliat, is taken
from him. The lady was beloved by a large circle
of acquaintances, for she possessed in a high
degree the many amiable qualities of her father.
As is known, she died shortly after giving birth to
a child—the only one born to her in a married life
of 10 years’ duration. The child ii alive and well,

Mr. R. S. Smythe has done the musical
folk of Sydney a good turn in bringing over
the Zerbini Quartette.” The first concert was
given in the Y.M.C.A. Hall, last Friday night, and
inclement though the weather was. nearly every
seat was taken for t hat evening. The Governor,
Lady Carington and suite, attended, and seemed
to enjoy the excellent music thoroughly. The
gem of the concert was, perhaps, Haydn’s quar-
tette in E flat Op. 64, which was given by the two
violins—viola and’cello—with such precision and
musicianly skill, that at the termination the
players were greeted with thunders of applause,
and nothing would satisfy less than a repetition of
the last movement. Mr. J. H. Guenett, the
pianist of the company, is an unaffected per-
former. Of the nine refined class of artists. Miss
Cnristlan, who was in capital voice, sang two
charming songs, one “To Chloe,” by Sterndale
Bennett, and the other. “ Far from my love,” by
tiavti. For the second the lady received an encore,
upon wßioh she gave, “ Cans’t thou believe," most
expressively. Only six items were down on the
ftrogramme, but as each was almost a concert in
tself, the audience left more than satisfied with
this most delightful entertainment.

On Wednesday, 13th inst., a hunt was
held about Double Bay and Bondi, Mr. Edward
Terry having brought over his bounds from
Ryde. There was a large number of horsewomen
and men, and the object of the chase was the wily
red herring. That splendid creature was followed
with wild excitement by about 25 human beings
and 10 dogs, all thirsting for its blood. It was
wonderful how long that fish eluded the pur-
suers and dashed over the ground and among the
furze-bushes as though it had been at tho game
all its life. One stout M.P., however, never really
gave it a chance. He stuck to the trail with the
tenacity of a shark, and had at last the satisfaction
of eating it. It is to be hoped that so glorious a
sport will not be allowed to die from want of suf-
ficient support—or herrings.

A laudable effort is being made to secure a
“ drive ” about Sydney that shall compare favour-
ably with the fashionable “drives” of older
countries. It has been proposed that a start
should be made at Bourke'sstatue, thence through
the gate into Macquarie-street, down that street
and round to the beginning of the sea wall, near
Fort Macquarie. In order to avoid encroaching on
the Botanic Gardens, it was proposed to carry the
roadway outside of the sea wall by a light iron
platform to Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair, thence round
on reclaimed ground to Foley’s baths, and by an
easy gradient into the present road, again diverg-
ing round the Art Gallery and across from thence
by the Technological Museum to starting-point.
Distance, about 3M miles. The chief objects
of this movement are to encourage tho use
of horses and vehicles, and to improve the
breed of carriage-horses, a clast of animal
ia which New South Wales is ttrangely defi-
cient. Lord Carington has gone heartily into the
matter. His Excellency also makes tho useful
suggestion that the unemployed might be put to
worse uses than cutting long riding-tracks through
the Randwick and Botany watersheds. All must
agree that it is good policy to make Sydney at-
tractive. It may be said that all this seems very
like doing work at the cost of the country for one
class of the community, but this would be an ex-
tremely narrow view as the thing means trade
and labour all round.

The committee of the Sydney Mercantile
Rowing Club report huge progress in the way of
preparations for thtir annual ball. Already a big
majority of the tickets are sold, and these pass
ports to paradise are likely to become as scarce as

bright, fair bloom of the glowing cneek of bud-
ding beauty, before the plaintive wail of the
witching waltz weaves its potent spell.

The crowded audience at the Zerbini
Quartette Concert was noticeable for the absence
of the dead-head element. No Sydney musician
ever gives a concert—not even a benefit concert—
without having to send orders to so-called patrons
—people who 6mow their appreciation of high-class
music by never paying to hear it. The Melbourne
artistes did not believe in this sort of patronage**
and their audience meant money.

The famous divorce case of Crawford v.

opportunity of divesting himself of raiment and

Knglaud appear to like this gamey perfume, and
the Court Is second only to the “ Colinderles ” as a
public resort. Judging from present appearances
Sir Charles Dllke will be j nst about seven shades
darker at the close of the proceedings than he is
at present, for though he has solemnly kissed the
infected Bible and sworn that he is as pure as
snowy mutton, he ad’mltted in cross-examination
that he had excised some awkward entries from
his diary and had split up the seventh command-
ment on previous occasions. The most dangerous
witness against him—the mysterious Fanny—is
still missing, and appears likely to maintain a
prudent remoteness from the scene of trouble,
and In her absence it will probably be rather diffi-
cult work to scrape off the spots which the Radical
leopard has so unfortunately contracted.

“ Victor H.”: No, certainly not. A state-
ment may be calculated to bring a man int ocon-
tempt, and yet not be actionable. You might, for
instance, call a man “a stonewaller” or "a
suburban alderman ” with impunity...." A.F.”

if Mr. Parsons were responsible this is merely a

Thanks for cutting. We think Sir John Robert-
son fairly earned a grant. Remember, he legis-
lated in rougher, although perhaps soberer, times
than the present...." Port Melbourne”: On 18th
May, 1884. (3.) You can’t get over the fact that
when Sir James M'Culloch accepted a knighthood,
Berry made capital out of it in his harangues to
the working classes, and declared that no man
could take such a meretricious bauble and
be an earnest Democrat. When Sir Gra-
ham Berry returns to Victoria ho will
pose as a respectable Liberal-Conservative
“J. J. Roberts”; Very well “ R.8.G.” (Christ-
church): Thanks. The fact that he comes from
the Adelaide Y.M.C.A. may* however, arouse a
prejudice against him in the minds of the irre-
verent and ungodly “James Ashe”: We don’t
remember any previous instance of Parkes attend-
ing an Orange gathering. The earnest Orangemen
—the conscientious fanatics, as contra-distin-
guished from tbe conscienceless political schemers
of the order—regard Parkes’ present attitude with
contemptuous loathing “ Moira”: We don’t see
how an unprincipled legislative reducer, or a mem-
ber of Parliament notorious for shadowing little
girls round dark corners-a man whose immorality
is so notorious that his glance directed at the face
Of any decent woman is an Insult—can possibly
entertain any particular reverence for the sanctity
of the Sawbath.... “ J.P.”: The difference so far
seems to consist in the fact that while in Victoria
all tbe snuffiers, ranters, hypocrites, whited
sepulchres, and blathering men of straw
travel on the Radical and Protectionist ticket
(which nevertheless has of late years in
the Cabbage Garden never lacked sincere
and able advocates)', the N.S.W. snuffiers and
frauds nearly all array themselves on the side
Of Freetrade and “ holy-joeylsm,” because they
think it much the stronger side. By-and-bya,
when Protection and something like a progressive
liberal policy shall] have been firmly Jnsta'led In
N.S.W., the Orangemen will change their
tune and “rat” with the utmost celerity
"Loyalty”: "Worship” is fair verse, but want-
ing in both force and elegance. With either it
Would be acceptable...,“T. S.” Sandgate (Q):
Thanks: hint very welcome....." The Three
Balls ”: Thanks for suggestion; we deal this week
with the work In question...." James Miller”:
No wonder your brother never receives It; the
Russian authorities have, for years, refused to
pass The Bulletin through the post. Its political
opinions are "too steep” for them...."R.R.”;
The only solid argument we have yet heard ad-
vanced against the legalisation in England of
marriage with a deceased wife’s sister, is that f
if such marriages were permitted, women would
go to the homes of their brothers-ln-law and
make love to them, and by so doing bring about
proceedings in the Divorce Court, and ultimately
marry, or live with their Bister’s husband in adul-
tery. This argument is on a par with the con-
tention that Britishers, unlike Germans, wouldn’t
respect the law if hanging and flogging were
abolished "Alfred 8. Stevens” (Melbourne);
Many thanks. However, we re-published the
verses months ago. Always glad to hear from
you "Thespis” (Maryborough, Q.): Thanks.
Has already been noticed “L.F.”: Thanks
“ J. 8.” (Forbes): If she said, “I love you, Joe,” it
must have been before you wrote that poetry—
" Hudson Shaw ”: Will possibly print “ Recon-
ciliation ”: Basket. Treatment not strong enough
for the subject. Metre fairly correct, save when
you use the double-ending words for your lines.
"J. Marshall” (Ravenswood): An ignorant,
ravenous quack, iwho’d swindle his own father,
and who doesn’t know erysipelas from epilepsy,
or paregoric from paralysis .."Jonas”: The "hectic
flush” of The Bulletin’s cover is caused by in-
creased circulation..." L oyal”: When the decision
of a Supreme Court Judge is upset on appeal, the
Judge isn’t deposed from the bench. Why should
Speaker Barton lose the Speakership on account
of one mistake ? The only man capable of filing
Mr. Barton’s place is Sir Henry Parkes, and he
would not be likely to accept the post save as a
last resort "Fitzroy”: Yes; Dan. O'Connor
formerly abused Sir Henry Parkes with much
vehemence, and now supports him with equal
ardour. There are some men who would rush to
carry sulphur in Hades, for the sake of currying
favour with old Nick “J.P.”: Your theory is
worthy of consideration, but will not stand debate.
..." Dynamo ”: The reason why letters of introduc-
tion are always handed unsealed to the bearer is
this, that in ancient times, in N.S.W., when an
assigned servant was refractory, or hia master or
mistress happened to be in bad humour, he or she
would give the servant a sealed letter, addressed
to the nearest J.P., running thus:—"The bearer,
J. Smith, has been cheeky to me to-day. Please
give him 250 lashes, and oblige John Bilkins ” (or
" Sarah Biikins,” as the case might be). By-and-
bye convict servants got tired of walking 20 miles
only to got a flogging, and as they truculently re-
fused to present any letter of which they did not
know the content!, it became customary never to
give a man in N.S.W. a sealed letter of introduc-
tion. To gum-up such a letter is the worst insult
you can offer to a Potts Point patrician, and he In-
stinctively says “ Ooh I ” and rubs his back, even
If merely asked to post a letter “C.M.G.”:
Sketch held over until the case has been decided.
“M.8.L.H.” (Ashfleld): No fear “A.H.C.”;
Thanks. The verses extensively re-printed
already.. .“J. Bell”: They can legally charge
you what they like—for, you see, you are not
bound to buy from them. They must, however,
be mean people if they extort from you at sea
ss. per pound for duty-free tobacco “B.
Lang”: Will read verses. We have a photo, which

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tbe youngster who saw hia mamma dressed for a
ball and asked her where she was going to bathe
may have been an enfant terrible of a more than
usually pronounced character, but the boy had,
no doubt, sufficient reasons la his mother’s attire
to prompt him to the inquiry. Perhaps there was
never a time when bareness, accompanied or un-
accompanied by beauty, wr.s so extensively in
vogue with women as the present. Take photo-
graphy. When two fond parents take their first-
born—the finest child in the world, of course—to
the pboto.-man, their joint production must
be stripped and laid in the half-she 1. It gener-
ally does not do to have the small box of
yells taken in his christening cloak, the gift of his
aunt. This would show the cloak, but it would
not display the child’s limbs. It is pardon-
able pride that prompts the action, we
admit. But we were just thinking tbe
other day how many children caught cold
or were given a disgust for art all through their
after-life by the cold half-shell and the awful
sound the portrait-man gives forth to engage
their attention. Then Miss Minx, aged 14, must
have her taper arms and neck taken, to be satisfied
with what the sun thinks of her. The professional
and stage beauty business has naturally given an
impetus to naked photography. We do not
know what tbe British matron is beginning to
think of it. She may tolerate Mrs. Langtry’s and
Mary Anderson’s portraits in her drawing-roomi
but the picture of the little girl round at the
theatre who shows her lege with more modesty
than the British matron’s daughter shows her face
and bosom would send the lady into hysterics if it
were found stuck up by her eon—destined for the
church—upon the chimney-piece when the bishop
came to visit. We do not object to graceful arms
and " animated busts ” being photographed, but
we think there is too much of it. That uncomfort-
able, irrascible old man, Thomas Carlyle, bade
those who had something good to say, out with it
In Heaven’s name I ” We say the same to women.
If a competent judge has assured you that your
bust and arms are really beautiful, out with them
on every fair occasion, and gladden the heart of
the men who look on you. But if your arm is a
wire, your neck a rope of wrinkles, and your
besom—well, not there—have pity on the world,
and leave them to padding and the imagina-
tion. The old Greeks worshipped beauty. When
Pbryne, at the Feast of Neptune, plunged into the
sea, she gave to Apelles and Praxiteles the idea of
their great works. The Venus de Medici, at
Florence,is, according to Thomson, “the statue
that enchants the world,’’ and, as Byron says, a
work where
“ The goddess loves in stone and fills
The air around with beauty.”
The love of the beautiful, if not stronger, is more
general now. Art flourishes, but fiesh is tri-
umphant. Soon, no one will care to write like the
imaginary Herr Teufelsdrockh a Philosophy of
Clothes. There will not be sufficient to write
about. But the stage is not wholly to blame, for
the example has been set by the dress-circle and
society. Have you never seen at any of the typi-
cal comic operas of the period, the elder Spriggs,
Mrs. Spriggs, and low-dressed daughters in the
dress-circle? Spriggs seizes the family opera-
glasses as soon as the ballet-girls come on in cos-
tume. He steals furtive glances through it until
his wife’s eye discovers his little game, and with a
nudge, which would almost break an elephant’s
rib, he is admonished not to look at “ those crea-
tures,” and the glass is taken away from him, con-
fiscated in a fashion, and given to the young ladles
who wish to stare at Billgreeno. Oh, for a forty-
parson power to chant thy praises, nineteenth
century hypocrisy 1 But bareness, like the poor,
we now have always with us—from the picture
upon a little French matchbox to the advertise,
ment of moral soap, or of parcels sent all round
the world at a reasonable charge. Alfred Austin
wrote some hard things in his satire, “ The
Season.” He pretty well summed it up in one
part where he asked—
" What can be man’s, the while ’tie woman’s part
To bare her bosom and to hide her heart? ’

Br not heeding the warnings of Nature, many persons
are laid up on a bed of sickness and suffering for weeks,

will be nipped in the bud. Note the following..— _

' Pain in Small of Back, Pain in
Loins, Flushes of Heat and Chills,
with Disordered Stomach, Bowels,

Bell’s Bitters will positively relieve
any of above symptoms, and cure
Dyspepsia.
Any one of the above symptoms is not sufficient to
cause any alarm, and many persons do not pay any
attention to it until the symptoms multiply, and they
discover disease has made great inroads, and .possibly
firmly established itself in the system.

The strictest examiner may try every test of touch
and sight without discovering that these are other
than the Genoa Velvets which they so closely resem-
ble, while the peculiar arrangements resulting in the
fast woven pile enable them to stand 1 interminable
and rough wear, which would ruin- teal 1 Velvets at
four'times the pHce. For Costumes and
Trimmings it is unequalled-, and in fact
for all purposes in which Silk Velvet

Mabel.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Downcast eyes and looks demure,
Mabel, this I know,
You are always very sure
When ’tis better so;
Then your dress so simple is.
Soft and comme il faut;
I translate your smile to this—
It is better so.
I have seen your brown eyes flash,
Mabel, strangely bright;
Seen beneath your eyelid's lash
Scarcely mellow light;
Bather startling first it seemed,
What it meant I know:
’Twas not like the dreams he’d dreamed—
Was it better so ?
But a year ago it is,
Since your downcast eyes
Give soft answers unto his—
Mabel, they were lies;
He was kingly, brave, and true,
What you were you know;
Scorn of him recoils on you—
And ’tis better so.
Basking in a mother’s smiles,
Gold enough, I trow,
To become you in your wiles
As the fashions go—
You will find some sunny day,
Reaping as you sow.
That the fates will have their way—
For you, better so.
Debts don’t outlaw, Mabel, dear,
Of this kind, you know;
And your notes of hand, I fear,
Would rate rather low;
Just a lien on yourself
Suits; ’tis not so slow;
Human hearts don’t count by pelf—
Even better so.
And sometime at rout and song
** She is quite fand -
Been out, too, so very long,”
Cruel lips will say.
People, dear, do say such things
So malapropos;
Little bees have bitter stings—
Well, ’tis better so.
Is your power so very sweet—
Does it pay to win ?
Tares are never reckoned wheat,
Mabel, it is sin.
Be a woman as you may,
Let the siren go;
Shall I greet you thus some day ?
Far, far better so.

What wonder of mystical grace

With sweetness surpassing of face I
What dreamer’s fond visions begat thee ?
What visions of beautiful things ?
What longing—what ravishing rapture ?
No mortal's dull fancy-lent wings
To scale the far-faint empyrean,
And draw thee to earth from the skies ?

We’re also exceedingly chased!

AtDeniliquinonce an Irishman, arraigned
for stealing a bottle of whisky, sought, in a very
Hibernian manner, to throw cold water on the
charge by asserting that the whisky was of an in-
ferior brand. Mr. Dailey,who was prosecuting,
remarked, however, that it was a well-known
principle in British law that when an Irishman
stole whisky it was always the best.
A correspondent, “Silex,” complains that
although there are 5000 persons at the Prospect
Waterworks, there is no resident medical prac-
titioner. Men die here unattended. A scene
of dying misery occurred here the other
day which discredits our common humanity.
Yet is there about £6O fortnightly retained
by the contractors as contribution to a sick
fund.” We publish these astounding state-
ments, not vouchiag for their accuracy, but
in the hope that should they unfortunately be
true, Immediate action will be taken in the
matter.
A correspondent, writing to a Sydney
daily, suggests the erection of a hall for the ac-
commodation of those unfortunates who having
only the “ key of the street ” at night are com-
pelled to sleep on kerbstones and gutters. The
idea is worth a lot of support, A slice of the
Patriotic Fund would be well bestowed, but the
treasurers of that money are holding on to it, pos-
sibly in anticipation of a war between Dubbo and
Bega.
Some More "Peeress.”
The Town and Country Journal’s “ Peeress ”
now promises to prove rather a disreputable sham
after all. Last week she appears under the new
style of “The Daughter of a Peer,” and the
Jbrnil does not even say whether she is a legitl*
mate daughter or not. To pass her off on an un-
suspecting public as an actual peeress was cer-
tainly playing it rather low down on the bush
community, unless the paper which she ornaments
with the bony end of her intellect is prepared to
prove that the son of a Queen is necessarily a
King, or that the offspring of the Town and
Country is necessarily a jackass. The bogus
peeress is still discoursing about “ Wales,” but
haying left off writing in a semi-obscene manner,
she has degenerated into something like the sedi-
ment at the bottom of a sermon. Among other
valuable items, she gives two examples of the
British Heir Apparent's correspondence with
Lady Mordaunt, a subject which one would
imagine to be about as sore a one as his unpaid
tailor’s bill, and a little the more disagreeable of
the two to the daughter of a peer. In the more
interesting of the epistles H.B.H. drivels about
some long-forgotten period when he had measles,
or softening of the brains orjsomethlng of the
kind, and writes as follows l -
“ My dear Lady Mordaunt,-! cannot tell you
how distressed 1 am to hear from your letter that
you have got the meas'es, and that I shall in con-
sequence not hare the pleasure of seeing you. 1
have had the measles myself a long time ago, and
I know what a tiresome complaint it is, I trust
you Will take great cars of yourself, and have a
good doctor with you. Above all, I should not
read at all, and I suppose you will be forced to lay
up for a time. The weather is very favourable
for your illness, and wishing you a very speedy
recovery, believe me, yours most sincerely,
ALBERT EDward,”
Ye gods I "To lay up I What a pity that the tutorial
eye of the reverend Dalton, under whose auspices
“ Wales’” sons have developed so great and unex-
pected a fund of literary expression, was not per-
mitted, in the Interests of the Queen’s English, to
wander over the platorllo little epistle of the
future Defender of the Faith 1 “ I hate had the
measles myself a long time ago 1 ’ Great Scott 1 We
ask Baron Carlngton and the aristocracy of Potts
Point (some of whom have big sons and
daughters proficient in grammar) whether
the publication under the sign-manual of
the great and glorious Albert Edward of
such an awful example of muddled tenses
is calculated to advance the cause of Imperial
Federation—whether it IB not, on the other hand,
calculated to Incite Woolloomooloo to open rebel-
lion, and sow the seeds of sedition in the most
fashionable quarters of Woollahra. The “daughter
of a peer,” we observe, is still suffering a little from
the recollection that her brass fetich once diced
with Leon Gambetta, and it is very probable the
great French statesman, on his part, is even now
looking down—or up, as the case may be—at this
mortal earth, and vowing that he will never, never
do it again. Wales, according to the hired Town
and Country aristocrat, does not keep a diary,
which is one redeeming feature in his character,
but he seems to have " kept ” almost everything
else on which he could lay his hands, barring the
Ten Commandments. However, if he should pay
his long-looked-f or visit to Australia, the colonists
will have a better opportunity of judging his
value than is likely to be good for their loyalty,
and we can only express a hope. In conclusion,
that the next time the “ beeress ” dips the split-
end of her reputation in the ink-pot, with a view
to writing society news for export to this country,
she may find a more interesting, as well as a more
respectable subject for discussion.

** * BOCHESTEB, June J, 1883. “ Ten Years

deathly pains In my back and —Kidneys
“ Extending to the end of my toes and to
my brain!

“ When my wife
heard a neighbour tell what Hop Bitters had
done for her , she at once got and gave me
some. The first dose eased my brain and
seamed to go hunting through my system
for the pain.
The second doso eased me so much that I slept
two hours. Something I had not done for two
months. Before I had used five bottles, I was well
and at work as hard as any man could, for over
three weeks; but I worked too hard for my
strength, and taken a hard oold, I was taken with
the most acute and painful rheumatism all through
my system that was ever known.
I called the doctors again, and after severa
weeks they left me a cripple on crutches for life!
as they said. I met a friend and told him my case
and he said Hop Bitters had cured him and would*
cure me. I poohed at him, but he was so earnest
I was indueed to use them again.
In less than four weeks I threw away m v cm toheo
and went to work lightly and kept on using thl
bitters for five weeks, until I became as we l as

“The Intended Pienic to Sir John Robertson has been indefinitely postponed.” —Sydney
Daily Paper.
SIR JOHN: “CONFOUND TOUR PICNIC. DON’T YOU KNOW I’VE GIVEN UP POLITICS,
AND PICNICS ARE THE WORST PART OF POLITICS.”


A volcano, supposed to be extinct, has
bien discovered in Tasman'a, and a Chinese mis-
sionary, accompanied by a few amateur scientists,
has started out to poke up the sleeping monster
wi h a pin ana see if he is quite dead. Perhaps,
a'ter the recent experiences in New Zealand, they
would be wiser to let the animal alone. In that
colony misguided men have been treading for 40
years on the curly tall of Nature, dropping bricks
down Into geysers, boiling potat es in the hot
springs, and throwing extinct cats into the silent
craters of Tuawora, and at last the outraged
goddess has humped a whole district into kingdom-
want as a warning to piople who won’t leave her
a one.
The practical utility of the Victorian tor-
pedo-boats has now been satisfactorily proved.
All sorts of unkind remarks had been made about
tn-8 branch of the fleet. Captious critics asserted
that even la the p ping times of peace, wita
nothihg to ii arry them, the torppdo-cfli iers never
landed their dea ly missiles within haif-a-rnlle of
the object aimed at. It was insinuated, in fact,
that a Victorian torpedo couldn’t bit anything by
a iy chance. The captious critics, as usual, were
all wrong. While practising oil Geelong, a torpedo
fired from one of the boats made a two-foot hole
lo the hull of an aoj c?nt steam-launch, which —
obi irony—was employed In fishing for another
lost torpedo. CoEsidarlng that thsre were no
otner vessels in sight at the time, this must be re-
garded as a most encouraging experiment. Only
one object to hit—and the torpedo made a bull b-
eye at the first attempt.

The part played by the most insignificant agents
in provoking a breach of the world’s peace is nearly
always underrated. An underdone pork chop may
play old Harry with the peace of two mighty em-
pires, while a twinge of rheumatism or a colicky
baby can upset the “ Love in a Cottage ’! business,
and introduce the very demon of discord into a
pious family in less time than it takes to draw the
cork of a St. Jacobs Oil bottle; and this marvellous
oil is a sure antidote to all the troubles, as shown
by the thousands of testimonials over the names
of live people, who will be happy at any time to
back up their statements by verbal assurances of

BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
In England the balance of strength in
cricket has been transferred with marvellous
rapidity from batting to bowling. Hitherto
the cry has been that English bowling was weak,
and that batsmen had it all their own way. this
year, however, the Bngll-h bowlers are asserting
their supremacy in an astounding fashion, -tne
wet season has'helped them, but this does not al-
together account for the unprecedentedly low
rate of scoring. The advent of Spoffortn and
Co. in England has induced their best bowlers to
make a study of pitch and pace, with the result
that they are now able to take advantage ot a
difficult wicket when they get one. I eate and
Watson bowled unchanged through the two Aus-
tralian’s innings at Manchester, the former cap-
turing 13 wickets for little more than 4 runs per
wicket, and the latter 7 wickets for less than 5
Few parallels can be found for this in Eoglisn
bowling ; and yet It is quite in keeping with their
form this season, as the week bef ore Peate took J
Sussex wickets for 31 runs, and Watson 7 Derby-
shire wickets for 15. English amateur bowlers are
little behind, as the performance of Messrs. Whitby
and Cochrane against “our boys’ at Oxford will
show. At one time, Spofforth’s figures of 15
■wickets for 36 runs in a first-dags match would
have scared every county club in England, but
now the Britishers are not so far beeied such per-
formances themselves.
* * *
In the second innings of the match Aus-
tralian Eleven v. Yorkshire (won by the Austra-
lians with six wickets to spare), Scott went in lirst
and carried out his bat for 67. In the final over he
scored three sixes and one tour, making a total of
33 runs for the over.

“Fairplay ” writes to The Bulletin, ask-
ing now it is that the always-attractive list of
boxing eve'nts announced to oorae off at Foley’s
rooms, Saturday after (Saturday, is rarely or .ever
adhered to. Our correspondent bluntly remarks
that Foley undertakes to supply a certain thing
for a certain amount, and should carry out his
contract to the letter, falling which he should step
forward and give a full and satisfactory explana-
tion of his default. It is very evident that “ Fair-
play ” has never run a series o f boxing encounters,
or he would know what cattle “pugs.” are to deal
with. For instance, a counle of boxers are hilled
to appear on a certain evening, and If they do
meet, the odds are they have fixed uo the event
beforehand, and either a light and elegant tap-
ping-match comes off, or one of them is
knocked out before the bout Is half through,
according to agreement. We have seen adealof
the game, and commend us to the introduction by
the*MC. of “two friend?, gentlemen,” which is
usually followed by a right down slogging en-
counter. Foley’s Saturday nights are now an
institution attended by the Sydney public of all
classes from city aldermen and members of Par-
liament upward, and It is only under the iron rule
nf Larry, that our comsoondent, who states him-
self to be a lover of the “noble art,” may hope to
cnlov an orderly evening with the mittens. So
far as the Jackson-Leas affair was concerned, the
writer was, to a certain extent, behind the scenes,
and he knows for a fact it was not till the after-
“nnn of the day they were billed to appear that
Tackson’s hacker had definitely stated that he
would not allow his protect to W, with the
urosnect of a match with Lees, which, by the way,
has since been ratified. Intimation of this change

counter was one of the best seen here for many a
dav Smith Is a fine young fellow, but appeared
rather overdone in bis training, while M‘Carty,
as usual looked tbe stayer which he must be to
withstand the heavy body punishment doled out
bv Smith, who is a hard hitter. In the fourth
round Smith had his man beaten to a standstill,
hut he threw away hjs opportunity, and the
minute’s spell pulled fl’Cirthy together again.
After this it was anyone’s fight until the eleventh
?ound. when M’Carty got in a lucky one on the
point of the jaw. which knocked smith “groggy.”
and M’Carty was declared the winner. Smith is a
game youngster, not yet out of hi* teens, and pro-
mises great things for the future,

undoubtedly give way, more especially as the

Metropolitan week will he a gala one for
the Sydney boxing fraternity, as both Jackson
and Lies, and the rival amateur champions of Vic-
toria and N.S.W, are set down for decision therein.
On public form Lees should beat Jackson, as the
Sydneyite was twice beaten by a man who was
defeated by Lees, but this line of comparisons is
not always a sure one to go by. Jackson, incur
opinion, Is a much-improved man tn when he
boxed Farnan, and should he goat Lees in the way
he boxed Dooley, he will take a lot of “ doing.”

The old Prince of Wales was run down
outside Sydney Heads by the Peterborough, on
Friday morning, owing to the jamming of her
rodder-chains. Before the one boat arrangement
came into vogue on the Parramatta, the Prince
was an identity on the champion course, in the
Tr ckett cum-Rush-cum-Layoock days, and with
or without the permission of the Marine Board,
she was in at the death with a greater certainty
than the pound a head boats. Two men went
under with her, but this was as nothing compared
to the men Tommy Waterhouse has talked to
death on her decks. We recollect on one occasion
Tommy, who in his day was no end of a bruiser,
getting into high argument with a man on board
over the merits of a couple of scullers The
stranger talked flvht when Tommy shrilly re-
marked: “Do you know who I am ?’ “I’m
Tommy Waterhouse I.’ “ I wouldn't care,” calmly
replied the stranger, “if you were Thomas Pa'-
liamont House, Bush is still the better scuilt. of
the two.” And Tommy collapsed.

In the Rugby football field this season, the
two far and away best clubs have been the Gordon
and University, and we were naturally surprised,
when the composition of the N.S.W. representa-
tives came to light, to find that the two crack
clubs have only three men each in the team, while
the Wallaroos have four men and an emergency.
This may be all right, but on paper it seems to
want a lot of explaining. The Brisbane contingent
are expected to arrive about noon to-day (Thurs-
day). Their stay, inclusive of trips to Newcastle
and Maitland, will last about a fortnight, during
which period they will play three matches in Syd-
ney, two Intercolonials, on S4th and 31st of this
month, and one against the Juniors on 3nd August.
The matches take place on the Association Ground,
and, as all “ club” matches on the dates mentioned
have been declared off by the Union, a big attend-
ance will no doubt show up on Saturday next.

From the London Sporting Times “ A
most interesting event took place in Romano’s
tnls week, when our shifter was introduced by
Harry Lane to Mr. Barney Thompson, the cele-
brated Australian bookmaker. Fancy, whispered
the Conkster to the Roman, fancy the bliss of
taking the Antipodean knockl The utter joy of
going with the gloves for a man who has taken
his passage to Sydney, and must start before Mon-
day.” Alter all, there mightn’t be so very much
j oy for any man who went with the gloves for the
Barney Thompson, thinking that he had a “soft
thing.”

A little sentiment is mixed up with the
victory of The Last Request la the Victorian
Waterloo Cup. The dog formerly belonged to the
late “ Tommy ” Dodd, SlrW. J. Clarke’s trainer.
Tommy thought very highly of the son of Castor-
Mint, and before his death, expressed a strong
wish that it should be nominated for the big event.
Hence the dog’s name. That poor Tommy was
not at fault In his estimate of the young one’s
promise, is proved by results. Being a dark ’un,
outside odds were procurable about The Last Be-
quest on the night of the draw, and the “ stable ”
supported their pet to win some £lBOO at a very re-
munerative figure. Had the Sydney dog, Mon-
arque, pulled through, the “books ” would have
fared considerably worse than they did.

The veteran Alfred Shaw seems to have
lost very little of his old accuracy of pitch. Iq
the return match with Nottingham, ha took four
Australian wickets for 30 runs, not a bad per-
formance for a mao in his 45th year. Considering
how the standard of bowling has been improved
since Shaw first made his reputation, it can easily
be understood that he was formerly regarded as a
phenomenon. A good yarn is told of the first
occasion wbe i young Alf. Shaw essayed to lower
the pride ot young W. G. Grace. The bowl u? had
openly exoressed his intention of getting the
rising champioo’s wicket in five overs. After an
hour 8 trying, somebody asked the Nottingham
maa “ what he thought of Grace now.” “Well,’’
said Shaw, “ 1 put the hall just where I pleases,
and that - puts the ball just where he pleases.’

It is quite saddening to read of the de-
cease of Bell’s Lira in London on May 39ih
last. Founded in 1833 Bell’s Lite was for many
years the sporting paper of the world. Even after
the advent of the Sporting Life, the old j rurnal
held its own fairly well under the editorship of
the late Mr. Dodd, but when the London Sports-
man became the leading authority on racing mat-
ters, Bell’s took a back seat altogether, and was
scarcely to be found anywhere but in the parlour
of old country taverns. The paper will always be
associated with the palmy days of prize-fighting
in the memories of old sportsmen. Whenever
dispute? ariie as to the exact age of the “ Bloom-
ing Chicken” when he fought his celebrated 93
rounds with the “ Smiling Badger,” the dispu-
tants will wipe away the silent tear as they re-
member that it is no longer possible to get an in-
fallible an?wer by writing to Bell’s Life.
Dear Bulletin,— l am a medico residing

paragraph in The Bulletin of June 36 about the
ex citioaof the leper, Wong Chong, in Brisbane
the remembrance of former teaching came to me.
When I was attending a great London hospital
Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, the most eminent living
authority on distaa is of the skip, brought cases of
leprosy to the students for inspection. I recollect
one day in particular when three lepers were pre-
sent, all of whom had acquired the disease abroa 1.
“Gentlemen,” said the great surgeon, “come
here, see and handle these lepers for yourselves.
Leprosy is not a contagious disease, as was for-
merly taught. [Mr. Hutchinsen referred to the
Mosaic law, no doubt ] Leprosy is a distinct disease
of the skin and lymphatics, fit is a disease pecull .r
to people who are excessive fish-eater?, and par-
ticularly to those who have a morbid desire for
badly-cured fish. The disease is generally found
on the sea coasts—[again referring to sacred
teaching, for instance, the Sea of Galilee.] None
of you, gentlemen, need hesitate to become
urgeon to a leprosy hospital.” lam now satisfied
from experience that Chinese leprosy, anyhow, is
associated with Chinese fish-eating, and that it is
non-contagious, and but a mnrbid or perverted
growth of skin produced from imperfect or mal"
nutrition.—Yours, &0., Pro Bono Publico.
