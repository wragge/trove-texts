This eminent Specialist is a graduated physician of
Harvard University, U.S., registered by the Governments
of N.S.W. and N.Z., and has devoted Sixteen Years
to the special study of the CHRONIC and SKIN
DISEASES of MEN and WOMEN. All applying
to him will receive his honest opinion of their com-
plaints. No experimenting ;no mercury used. A posi-
tive cure guaranteed or forfeit £2OO. His vast experience
tells him that where there is no organic disease, and
nothing but an inorganic trouble, Or, in other words, a
conglomeration of symptoms producing a certain result,
there is no reason why it cannot be removed with the
proper remedies : therefore he guarantees. He claims to
he the most skilful ana sucoessiful physician in N.S.W. in
his particular speciality, viz., the CHRONIC DISEASES
of MEN and WOMEN.
Examination and Advice Free to all.
Office Honrs : 10 to 12 a.ni.; 2to 4 and
7 to 8 pan.
In consequence of the prevailing
HARD TIMES,
Dr. SPEER has determined to REDUCE his FEES to
exactly ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
trusts that this will prove itself
GOOD NEWS INDEED
to those thousands of pool but honest sufferers, who,
though willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
means are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
■completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.
NERVOUSNESS.
CONSULT Dr. SPEER in all cases of NERVOUSNESS
and WEAKNESS, for his many years of practice with
these diseases enables him to remove all traces of them,
and to return the victims to full VIGOR and HEALTH.
O.—TWENTY SHILLINGS is sufficient to
send for remedies necessary for the cure of
NERVOUSNESS and WEAKNESS.
In all cases o<
WEAKNESS consult Dr. SPEER.
LIVER AND KIDNEY COMPLAINTS consult Dr.
SPEER.
ASTHMA consult Dr. SPEER.
BLOOD DISORDERS consult Dr. SPEER.
SKIN DISEASES consult Dr. SPEER.

MAKE KO CHARGE.
If you are subject to symptoms which you do
not understand, send for Dr. Burgoyne’s Com-
plete Treatise, entitled, “Nervous and Skin
Complaints,”
PRICE, ONE SHILLING.
This book is replete with useful hints to
sufferers, and even though you do not require
medical advice, you should send for a copy, if
solely for its
Prescriptions and Illustrations-
To avoid superfluous correspondence, intending
patients should be careful to describe ail symp-
toms in the first letter. To enable them to do
this I append a few questions : —Do you experience
Giddiness, Weak Back, Palpitation of the Heart,
Flushes of Heat, Dryness of the Skin, Pale,
Sallow Complexion, Restlessness at Night, a
Despair of Recovery, Anxiety without Cause, Fear
of Death, Tendency to Suicide, Lack of Mental
Capacity, Sluggish Liver,lndigestion, Heavy Feel-
ing after Meals, Piles, Pains in the Chest, Cold
■Shudders, Loss of Memory, Bad Taste in the
Mouth, Foul Breath, Coated Tongue, Hacking
Cough, Expectoration, Sleepiness during the Day,
Pains in the Back, Specks before the Eyes, Weak
or Bloodshot Eyes, Oozing of Yellow Saliva from
the Mouth during Sleep, Violent Temper, Loss °*
Ambition, Lack of Development, Fits, or Short-
ness of Breath, Ringing Noises in the Head ?
Patients Should Send
ONE POUND
with first letter, and describe all symptoms. This
Fee includes Medical Book, enclosed in linen
wrapper free from observation, also free from
Customs Duty to any Colony.
WHY SUFFER
Hidden anguish while the
FOLLOWING GUARANTEE
Is offered ? Dr. Burgoyne will, on receipt of
ONE POUND,
send his world-famed “ Electric Girdle,” which is
guaranteed to cure even the most obstinate cases.
Many persons have wasted large amounts in vain
endeavours to rid themselves of irritability and
weakness, and, as a last resort, tried Dr. Bur-
goyne’s
“ELECTRIC GIRDLE”
■with eminently satisfactory results. As a proof
of my confidence in the power of my Electric
Appliances, I am prepared to allow any honest
person to
test them free,
or wear them one month before payment, and
should they not do exactly what I claim, they
may bo returned. The “Electric Girdle” has
been so widely lauded by the Medical Profession,
Press, and
Cured Patients,
that I feel no hesitancy in advertising it as a
Certain Cure for Debility from any cause arising.
I CHARGE NOTHING
for Consultations; therefore, be yon ever so
1 oor. you may have the benefit of my experi-
ence and advice.
Patients may Depend
upon Inviolable Secrecy, Pure Remedies free
from Mercury or other injurious ingredients.
Persons who suspect taint in their blood, or
weakness should write to Dr. BURGOYNE for
Advice and Treatment; ho will cure all Local
Complaints, and thus enable them to marry
honourably.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges ,and hospitals of Europe.
He has devoted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints,
He has by profound research thoroughly invest!-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hh
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
■embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
DO YOU SUFFER

round the eyes, giddiness, irregularity of the
bowels, specks before the eyes, bashfulness, dis-
contentedness, weakness or pain in the back, liver

about to happen, weak stomach, yellow or blood-
shot eyes, constipation, impure blood, hasty,
uncontrollable temper, hacking cough, nervous-
ness in society, wakefulness, palpitation of the

tions may assist you in restoring some poor friend
to health, even though his case has been previously
pronounced incurable.
One Pound is Sufficient to Send
for remedies necessary to cure any ordinary com-
plaint. Should you require medical treatment, as
procrastination is sometimes dangerous, it would
be advisable for you to sit down quietly in your
chamber and write to the Doctor detailing all
experienced symptoms. He will, on icceipt of
such a letter, write you promptly and courteously
a candid and straightforward opinion of your
case. If you do not think you understand your
case send for his famous medical work, the price
of which is but Gd. ; enclosed in the volume

your ailments. Dr. Richards uses nothing but
the purest remedies, and never prescribes injurious

THE
NAMBROK ESTATE,
situated on the Latrobe River, Gippsland
comprises 15,000 acres of very rich land
which can scarcely be surpassed for agri-
cultural, fattening and dairy purposes. The
land is specially adapted for the growth of
maize, hops, root crops and ceieals, and is
practically ready for the plough. The
Nambrok sheep and cattle have been for
many years noted for the excellence and
high prices obtained. The rainfall is abun-
dant, averaging about 30 inches per annum,
and the climate salubrious, being free from
extreme heat and cold. An unlimited
supply of water can be obtained at a mode-
rate depth, under 30 feet, in any portion of
the Estate.
The Thompson River, which is close to
the northern boundary of the property, can
be easily and cheaply utilised for irrigation
purposes. The Rosedale Railway Station,
111 miles from Melbourne, is within 2|
miles of the property, and the railway line
runs directly through the property, and
the Heyfield station on the Maffra line is
about 5 miles distant.

MELTON PARK ESTATE
comprises 7146 acres, close to Bacchus
Marsh, in the Parish of Yancardook,
County of Bourke, and is well known in

“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to

GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured

and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
HITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Baron Berzilius’
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB-I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take _
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
tlie cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

A Wail from the “Expressionless."
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Yes ! our thoughts are ever dwelling
Where we oft regret they should,
por we’re no great hands at spelling.
And our grammar’s none too good ;
For our tongues are poor at wagging,
And our words are all in vain,
And we lack the gift of “magging ”
When we’re eager to explain.
Yet we know some things worth saying
If we could but speak or write,
And, like laden men, we’re swaying
With the burden of their might.
There are waters sounding sweetly
From the fountain’s rainbowed spray,
There are clear springs hid completely
Under desert-plains and clay.
And there’s no means of expression
Outside “pencil, speech, and pen,”
That can make a deep impression
On the hearts and minds of men (
There is nought in manly action,
Only actors seem to please,
Moral strength has no attraction
Till assumed by Pharisees.
What’s the use of truth unvarnished?
Was not Christ Himself denied,
And with giant love—untarnished—
For the people crucified ?
Is not honesty suspected
While the spieler’s sleight of thought
Is made much of and respected,
And his favours madly sought?
We are only silent readers,
But we’re waiting, millions strong,
Till the greatest yet of leaders
Comes triumphantly along
With such powers of expression
As will make the dullards see_
What they have in their possession
If they love humanity.
tet him tell to et’ry faction
Where their creed is wrong and right,
And dispel the wild distraction
And confusion of our plight J
l,et it be the foulest treason
To receive his words in doubt J
Let his grand and potent reason
Wipe our diff’U'ences all out.

EIFFA.
Ah Obstacle Race.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
lAM not Joe Scott. I never walked 100 miles in
one day nor in two days; but, all the same, I knew
I was too many for Scandalous. We had cut out
at a shed and were making for Hungerford.
Scandalous Jack was the only one going my road,
but, as it was over 100 miles and a lonely track, I
was glad of any sort of company.
Skite? Well, I like a good lie, but don t like a
man to think I believe it. When Scandalous told
me about his being out on No Tree Plains where
there wasn’t a stick of wood big enough for a
toothpick for 278 miles, and how he used to get
up in the morning, pull two or three blackfellows’
spears out of himself, and thank God that he had
something to boil the billy with, I suffered him.
But when he made a casual remark about his
walking miles in one day, I jarred him up a
“Look here, Scandalous,” 1 said, “you can’t
walk a little bit. Why, I’ll back Mad Scotty to
walk you.” This was a strong statement, con-
sidering that Scotty always wears a long overcoat
and has three billies hanging down each leg on
wire hooks. Scotty is known all over the back-
blocks. At a little distance he looks like one of
these Chinese-pump affairs where the buckets run
up one side and down the other. But he isn’t.
Scandalous looked at me calmly for some time,
and then “ performed ” very mildly to what I had
expected. “ Well, Billy,” he said, “if you fancy
yourself at that game, I’ll walk you into Hunger-
ford for your cheque against mine.”
So we made the wager. VV”e each had a cheque
for £l5, and when we came to a bush post-office
we put both cheques into one envelope and
addressed it to “ W. J. Brown, Hungerford—till
called for.”
I knew Scandalous’ game. He would pretend
to fall behind, and then make over on to the
coach-road, take the coach, and consequently both
cheques. However, I would watch that and lose
some sleep. I knew he could neither get ahead of
me nor far behind me. He should have the
pleasure of my companionship till within a few
hours’ walk of the town, and then —well, if we
didn’t part company then it wouldn’t be either
my fault nor his.
“Now, there’s one thing, Billy,” he said, “I’ll
trust to your honesty not to sling away that swag
of yours if we separate. And if the P.O. is closed
when one gets there and don’t open till you get —
or, I mean, till the other comes up, it is a draw.
Each takes his own cheque.” This was agreed to,
of course. It was only natural for him to make
the remark about my “ swag ” as it was nothing
but two good strong , flour-bags sewn together at
the ends with the bottom cut out of one. It had
been used as a mattress. I had picked it up before
Icameto the shed and was too mean to buy blankets
going away. The boys chaffed me a lot about it,
but as I wanted to get into Sydney with .£lO I
held out. I wovdd only bo a few days on the
track, and then the blankets would be of no
further use to me, as I had sworn to keep off
the track once I could get a start in Sydney.
Anyhow, this affair was nearly as good as a blan-
ket. I used to crawl into it feet-first, and no ants
or mosquitoes could disturb me.
I didn’t sleep a wink the first two nights.
Whenever T heard Scandalous make a start I
would get up and accompany him, telling him it
vas very lonely camping by oneself. The third
night was cold and chilly, and I crawled well into
my long bag, but not to sleep. I enjoyed Scan-
dalous’ company too well for that. The town was
2o miles off. But I did sleep, and when I awoke
next morning I didn’t spring to my feet and start
cursing, mostly because Scandalous had taken one
of the wires out of the fence above my head and
sewn up the mouth of my couch, and then fastened
the end of the wire to the post again. For obvious
reasons I stopped there all that day, and might
have been there yet only for two shearers coming
along in the evening. Scandalous had told them.

Panic Legislation.
The New South Wales Banking Bill, passed
hist week by a large majority in the
Assembly and by a practically unanimous
Council, which, almost to a man, arose early
in the morning and attended to do the deed,
is a tine specimen of that panic-stricken
legislation for which the province has made
itself famous. It is an utterly selfish device,
created exclusively in the interests of bank
shareholders, and enacted in red-hot haste
by a Legislature composed very largely of
the very class which it is intended to benefit.
It was drafted in a moment of frenzy, and
rushed through without time for considera-
tion and with hardly a semblance of discus-
sion, and it commits the country to a possible
liability of which hardly anybody can define
the magnitude. In its original form it was
iniquitous, and in its amended form it is
partly fraudulent and partly imbecile. In
the first instance, it was intended simply to
authorise certain private institutions, if they
chanced to get into a condition of practical
insolvency, to repudiate their liabilities, and
compel their creditors to take worthless
IO I sin place of gold. And, as an im-
provement on this original inspiration, it
now makes the nation responsible for the pay-
ment of these I O U’s, and undertakes that,
if necessary, the country shall make up the
shortage, caused by dishonesty, or ravenous
greed and senseless extravagance, and take
its chance, whatever that may bo, of making
good its loss at some later date. And the
banks pay nothing at all for this guarantee,
and instead of surrendering any of their
old privileges they receive extensive new
ones, apparently as a consideration for
allowing the country to take over their re-
sponsibilities, so that altogether the bargain
is a monsti’osity of which only a Legislature
of bank shareholders and their dupes could
possibly have been guilty.
# # #
The Bill is surrounded ana fenced in by
various elaborate provisions and so-called
“safeguards,” not one of which is of any
value whatsoever. It does not come imme-
diately into operation, but is to bo
put in force by proclamation at the
request of any institution which stands
in need of assistance. The sinking bank
must first make application to that hazy and
undcfinable affair described as the Governor-
in-Gouncil, with which corporate dignitary
rests the power of setting the new law in
motion. The Governor-in-Council (who may
chiefly or partly consist of the brother of a
bank-manager) is directed, before taking any
rash or ill-judged steps, to assure himself
that the applicant bank is really and truly
solvent—which is the first and most useless
precaution on the list. There is no official
supervision of banks in New South Wales,
so that neither the Governor-in-Council, nor
any other outside person or institution,
knows whether any one of the financial
corporations doing business in the province
is solvent or not. Neither is there any
means by which he can decide this essential
point. To ascertain the real condition of
affairs it is often necessary to inquire into
the status of several hundred, or possibly
of several thousand, debtors, and to travel
over the length and breadth of the continent
and make expert valuations of all sorts of
properties. This is a work of months, and
when a run commences on an attenuated
bank there are generally only a few days—
sometimes only a few hours—to spare.
Therefore, it will inevitably happen that
there will be a cursory inquiry—if there is
time even for that —and then the in-
stitution will be taken practically at its
own valuation. And on that valuation
every bank that exists, or ever did exist,
is always solvent to the bitter end. There
never was an establishment which burst
miserably, and paid l|d in the £, and fur-
nished a whole board of director’s to orna-
ment the local gaol, which was not, by its
own showing, absolutely sound. And, what
is much worse, there hardly ever was one
which could not convince a panic-striken
Governor-in-Council, with little time or
capacity for investigation, of its complete
soundness. It is only after weeks of slow
liquidation that its rottenness comes to
light. To all intents and purposes the
Bill might as well set forth that the State will
guarantee any and every bank without ques-
tion that it will be responsible for
Matthew Davies— (he was the Victorian
Speaker, and his gold-bug word was sacred),
and Thomas Smith Richardson, and will
make up the shortage of ex-Premier James
Munko, and will see everybody through pro-
miscuously.
* * m
As already mentioned, the Governor-in-
Council is the person, or aggregation of per-
sons, whose business it is to decide which
bank is, or is not, worthy of assistance from
the State. This dignitary consists, in a general
way, of the Governor and the Cabinet. The
Governor is a stranger to the country, gene-
rally guiltless of a knowledge of finance, and
almost always wanting in every qualification
—save honesty of purpose —which would en-
able him to form a reliable judgment on such
a matter. Moreover, he acts almost entirely
on the advice of the Cabinet, so that he is
practically a cipher, so far as the purposes of
the Act are concerned. As for the Cabinet
itself, it may consist largely of shareholders
in the staggering institution, or depositors
who want to get time to “stand from under”
before the financial land-slide gets fairly
started, or it may be an embarrassed Cabinet
with a big overdraft and its individual paper
in the hands of the Jews, or be otherwise
interested in many ways. It is questionable,
in fact, whether there ever is a Cabinet
which has not some interest, direct or in-
direct, in every bank in the province, and
under these circumstances also the chances
of any serious investigation before the State
guarantee is given are unspeakably remote.
Also, though the Act authorises theGovernor-
in-Council to demand such security from the
bank as will guard the Treasury from loss, it
does not compel him—or rather, it—to do
so, and for the same reasons as above-stated
no security will be demanded. The Govern-
ment —especially if it is such a one as the
present ignorant and bewildered Administra-
tion—will simply lend its support wherever
required, and ask no effective questions.
# # #
Thereupon, the notes of the suffering bank
will be declared legal tender, the bank can-
not be called upon to redeem them until the
expiration of the Act, and they must be
accepted unquestioningly at their nominal
value. Under these conditions, the bank
may force as many notes into circulation as
the law allows—which means that, as a rule,
it can issue from seven to thirteen times as
many as are now in circulation. The average
note circulation in New South Wales is some-
thing like £1,500,000 ; but when the banks
now in process of “ i’e-construction ” get
afloat with their immensely increased capi-
tals, they would, if they saw fit to take
advantage of this comprehensive measure, be
authorised to force upon the public some
£12,000,000 or so of paper-money at their
own discretion. Also, as there is no State
supervision whatever, they could force almost
as much more as they saw tit. And if the
institutions which issue the multitudinous
I Oil's fail to redeem them in gold, the
State undertakes the liability, whatever it
may amount to. Further, and more aston-
ishing still, the Act apparently applies, not
merely to banks belonging to the province,
but to all banks, local and foreign, doing
business there, and makes New South Wales
a foundling hospital for the lost or mangy
banks of all nations—at least, there is abso-
lutely nothing stated or even hinted to the
contrary. Therefore, it would appear that
an unstable foreign bank, or one belonging
to another Australasian province, with a
nominal capital and reserve of, say,
£1,000,000, though it may have only one or
two offices and a mere shadow of business in
New South Wales, may compel the people
of that province to accept £1,000,000 worth
of its notes, and scoop in gold in exchange
wherewith to prop up its main business else-
where, and then leave the ruined and dis-
tracted cornstalk community to pay the hill.
Also, there seems no visible reason why all
the tottering hanks of issue in the British
Empire should not open branches in Sydney
and fill the country with paper, taking away
gold in exchange, and then allow the people
of New South Wales to redeem the valueless
rag money at their own expense. And
whether the paper belongs to local or foreign
institutions there is nothing in the Act to
explain what the Treasurer is to do with it
after redemption; Probably it is left to the
aforesaid Governor-in-Coundil to decide
fidiether tiles State is to stand the loss or to
sell up the defaulting bank and thus recover
as much as possible of its outlay ; and in that
case tile decision of the Governor-in-Council
will probably be guided by the same motives
which led him to put the Act in force in the
first instance. In other words, the Cabinet
will go as the panic of the moment, or its
own interests and those of its supporters,
direct.
# # *
Out of all this folly the country gains
absolutely nothing. It is virtually made
liable, under conditions beyond its control,
to support certain aggregations of insolvent
private speculators from all parts of the
earth—for whatever may be the condition of
a bank on paper, the mere fact of its in-
ability to cash its own promises to pay bearer
on demand is insolvency. The Government
is to have no control over these individuals,
no guarantee as to their honesty, no means
of checking their extravagance, and no
authority to keep an eye on their accounts ;
it is simply to pay up the deficiency, whatever
it may amount to, after providing special
facilities for the indefinite enlargement of
that deficiency. The assertion of Premier
Dibbs that this tremendous foolishness is
undertaken not “out of any great desire to
serve the banks,” hut owing to profound
sympathy for 141,136 depositors, “many of
them working-men ” is too pitiably thin to
deceive any one. During the last two years
nearly 40 “land-banks” have suspended
payment in New South Wales ; their deposi-
tors, who numbered tens of thousands,
were almost exclusively working men
and women, and these depositors lost,
upon an average, three - fourths of
their savings. But the shareholders in
these institutions were illso, as a rule,
members of the working classes ; very few
capitalists were seriously distressed by the
calamity ; and Premier Dibbs did nothing to
relieve the miseries of the innumerable
sufferers, nor has he, to this very day, even
attempted any legislation to prevent the
gigantic “land-bank” fraud being repeated
at any moment, should the opportunity pre-
sent itself. And, on the other hand, the
depositors in the large banks of issue are nob,
as a rule, working-men—a fact of which
everybody, save, apparently, Mr. Dibbs him-
self, is fully aware ; moreover, even if they
were, it matters comparatively little, for in
most cases, by calling up all the available
capital, they, and the other creditors, would
be paid in full or very nearly in full. There-
fore, when we compare Premier Dibbs’ seem-
ing utter indifference when the working-
classes were seriously concerned with his
present frenzy when they are directly con-
cerned hardly at all, the natural inference is
that he cares not a straw for the poorer
section of the community, and that his
alarm is solely for the wealthy shareholders
who loom up so extensively in both Houses
of Parliament. Also, the enthusiasm of the
Legislative Council—which strictly capital-
istic gathering was much more unanimous
even than the Assembly—is another evidence
pointing in the same direction. Nobody
ever found the Council in a state of agitation
over 141,136, or any other number of poor
depositors, but the woes of one corpulent
shareholder strike a responsive chord beneath
its vast white waistcoat every time.
The Queensland Elections.
Within two members of three-fourths of the
new Queensland Legislative Assembly have, as
we write, been elected, to probably rule and
roll thc roost for the next three years. The
Labour-party has received an apparently deadly
wound, and the idolaters of Theft, miscalled
Thrift, are just now throwing their hats in the
air, in anticipation of a general scramble, in
which the life-juices of the province shall be
sucked dry by the well-nourished vermin now
crawling on the helpless carcase. The Fat Man
in the Belltopper has once more fallen upon the
Lean Ghost in the Billycock. The result could
not, under the circumstances, have been other-
wise. Five years ago, the constituencies were
desperately appealed to by the hypocritical
Fat Man, who wept crocodile tears" of repen-
tance, and swore by all his gods and his honour
—his honour ! —that he would and did there
and Lhen abjnre the unclean and hateful abomi-
nations which thc voters vetoed. Those ac**
cursed things, cheap coloured labour and land-
grant railways were publicly and protcstingly
renounced by every candidate who followed the
Great National Deliverer, MTlwraith, who
created a wondrous bubble, which he called
the National Party, talked high-falutin trea-
son against Imperialism, and swore to ont-
Radical the Red Radicals in his Republi-
canism. A whole people was completely
deceived.
MTlwraith was returned in ’BB by a five
to three majority, and, from that time, the
arch-spider commenced to weave the most
complex cobweb of treachery ever disembowelled
in Australia. The political jugglery of the last
five years—from the sensational winepress of
the Mount Morgan boomers, throughout the
Ishmaelitish seclusion of M‘llwraith, his sub-
sequent self-absorption into the Griffil wraith
and his cuckoo act of emergence in his present
character, are too startlingly recent to need
recapitulation. Queensland trusted in the
permanence of MTlwbatth’s ’BB protestations
mainly because it believed that he had so much
of personal grit as would, under all circum-
stances, prevent him from making a devil’s pre-
tence of friendship towards his life-long personal
enemy, Griffith— the man who had publicly
stigmatised him as a thief in intention, and has
never yet, so far as the world knows, apolo-
gised for the accusation. But the masses knew
not MTlwraith. He was a superior brand of
political devil to any they had previously en-
countered. He was a more sinuous serpent than
Milton’s Satan who preferred ruling in Hell to
serving in Heaven. He was content for a time
to follow the nominal lead of Griffith while
cajoling and directing him, and bided his time.
It has now apparently come.
* # *
During the last two years, the whole might of
the Queensland Government has been concen-
trated, in all its phases of energy, on one
ambition—the destruction of the Labour vote.
Fat Men of all political principles, and of no
political principle at all, combined venomously
for this achievement. Past misrule prepared
the favourable conditions. While M ‘llwraith
talked glibly of the gigantic evil of the
Griffith-Miles ten-million loan, he added to
its aftermath with the skill of a veteran dung-
farmer. The creation of a position of apparent
national bankruptcy was the strategy" of a
deep chess-player. Then came the wonderful
Coalition—“ to save the country.” This placed
Parliamentary parties at the mercy of the
new and strange allies who knew no
mercy. The very daring of the unexpected
combination paralysed the hitherto com-
pact rival camps, which disappeared as
separate factions. Parliament lay prostrate
and powerless as at the feet of a conqueror.
Then began the game of magnificent allure-
ments. Most of the active politicians were
personally as well as collectively insolvent.
The quackery of the syndicates was to them
the balm of salvation. It was now that the
sugar-coated pill of Black Labour was again
offered and greedily swallowed, and the elixir
of Land-Grab Railways lapped up as the one
means of continued life. Parliament shame-
lessly recanted its hustings religion. But the
masses were aroused and there were volcanic
rumblings of a threatened retribution. Then
the last move was unmasked—“ Let us dis-
franchise the workers.” This was effected by
one of the hugest conspiracies that ever suc-
ceeded with a people mockingly supposed to be
self-governing. The irresponsible Parliament-
elected to support a policy which it had shame-
lessly renounced and contravened—combined
with outside capitalistic associations—in other
words, with the comrades who were to assist it
in despoiling the land—and the electoral laws
■were altered, a new and complicated machinery
was introduced into the voting power, and
the electoral-rolls were “ purged ” whole-
sale. Purged, not only by official supervision,
but by the set and secret action of a purely
capitalistic association, called a “Defence
League’’—equivalent to New South Wales’
“National Ass,” How effectually this dis-
franchisement was carried out may be gauged
by the fact that in Brisbane North alone—the
constituency that has just returned MTlwraiTh
and his new congener, the plausible sewing-
machine - agent, Kinosbury about 1500
workers’ names were wiped off the roll last
year.
* * *
But even this was not enough for the
Fat Man’s full purpose. The Pastoralists’
Association undertook to effect the disfranchise-
ment of those objectionable voters against whom
open measures might be dangerous. The huge
foreign-owned monopolies controlling all the
wage-earning chances in the various districts
had their complete agencies of enquiry, which
had reliable lists of voters ; and all voters in
any electorate were promptly refused employ-
ment in their own districts, men from far afield
being taken on in their stead. The workers
were thus compelled to leave those districts in
which they were qualified to vote, in order to
gain, in distant places where they had no vote ;
the bread necessary to sustain their bodies.
The alternative offered them was—Disfran.
chisement or Starvation. The usual Freedom of
Contract; for Queensland is a free country ;
* # #
Labour, defrauded of its franchise, has
loyally polled all that it could. In that fact
lies the present promise of Queensland’s ulti-
mate salvation. No time need be wasted in
useless fretting. Labour must continue un-
wearyingly to—Organise, Organise, Organise !
Its day of just and merciless revenge must
come. The latest triumph of the Fat Man is
but one more addition to the black list of scores
to be wiped out —by legitimate process
always, until legitimate "process be exhausted j
but wiped out at all hazards just as assui’edly
as natural justice must in the end conquer
Unnatural usurpation. The future evils that
the present hour must breed will not be
on the head of Labour. Let the masses but
set their faces firmly—disfranchised though
they now are—and say that the people’s land
shall not be stolen, and a resistless wave will
engulf the would-be robbers of a national
heritage. “ Australia for the People ”is worth
a Civil War, And when Federated Australia
uplifts its crest from the girdling Pacific, the
issue—now regarded by the ecstatic Fat Man as
decided once for all —must be fought out, if
not at the polling-booths, then in blood and
desolation.
* # #
In some of the minor details of the elections,
Labour (or it may have been Labour-traitors)
assisted to lose its own cause. At Townsville,
for instance, the two MTlwraithiati nominees
were opposed by two Labour men and two


alleged “Independents.” The prevention of such
future mistakes must be part of the programme
of the continuous organisation. How much of
their defe at, too, the Queensland workers owe to
the deserters from the ranks who have chosen
to withdraw their energies from the contest and
to follow Lane’s mad projected exodus to Para-
guay cannot be estimated. But let that pass.
The future belongs to the faithful remnant.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Millionaire Burdekin and the
“Workman.”
One of the worst and most suggestive disasters
which lias of late happened to the N.S.W.
Labour-party is the Workman-Burdekin ex-
pose, concerning which a long series of lame
apologies and explanations are raging in the
discredited organ of unionism. The story
itself is a great deal shorter than are the
explanations. The Workman, a few months
was financially on its last legs, and having
utterly failed to raise enough money among its
own friends to meet its liabilities, a deputation
was sent to Sydney Burdekin, landlord
and capitalist, to humbly borrow £3OO.
The attempt was partially successful, for
Burdekin advanced £9s—a sum which
looks like a loan of £lOO with one year’s
interest deducted in advance. Very shortly
thereafter the Workman’s creditor stood as a
Freetrade and violently capitalistic candidate
for the Hawkesbury electorate, and “in the
absence of a Labour candidate ” —so the apology
rall the paper boomed him. It didn’t boom
him very strongly, but it boomed him all the
same. Thereafter, by some process not very
definitely explained, dissensions broke out
between Burdekin and the Workman, and
Burdekin promptly gave the transaction away,
and it was exposed in the Sydney Worker,
There are quite a lot of morals to be drawn
from this short and miserable story. The
Workman is distinctively a Labour organ, and
it is run, presumably, by the best literary talent
the Labour party can command, yet it would
appear that the party cannot produce a paper
sufficiently readable to keep itself afloat; or
else the paper is readable and the party won’t
support its own organ, and prefers to buy the
capitalistic sheet and read the murders and
brutal-assault horrors. Therefore, somewhere
between these two alternatives, it comes to
pass that the Labour publication leads a
wretched, precarious existence on the brink
of starvation, and cannot get fair wages
for its own staff while persistently advocat-
ing fair wages for others, and works 16
hours per day trying to keep up the eight-hour
movement, and lives wretchedly on all manner
of I 0 U’s and expedients. Ultimately it came
down to borrowing from its enemies, and the
cause which does that is practically lost.
Burdekin’s party never invested £95 to greater
advantage than in this instance, for it made the
Workman its tool in the first place to boom a
capitalist for the Hawkesbury election, and
made the Worker its tool in the second
place for the purpose of exposing the
Workman. W T hereby the Labour-party now
hales the one paper for its folly, and the other
for its frantic haste to turn informer upon its
colleague. The Labour paper that was mad
enough to accept aid from Burdekin and then
drift into the position of his friend and advo-
cate, deserved to be exposed—by the capitalistic
press, but the spectacle of another Labour
paper hungrily reaching for the job is pitiable
in the extreme. The Labour press, as well as
the party, has been split asunder for £95, and
it doesn’t even get the price of its own down-
fall, for Burdekin now wants his money back,
and may yet finish up by selling the machine to
recover the amount. No quantity of explana-
tion can undo the miserable transaction. It
was not, so far as the evidence goes, an act of
treachery, but it was an outbreak of such
extreme foolishness as to be beyond apology.
+.
Humiliation and Prayer.
The Presbyterian Assembly of Victoria has
evidently decided that it is time to do some-
thing desperate for the resurrection of the
vanished boom, and in pursuance of this resolu-
tion it invites the Governor “ to proclaim a
day of humiliation and prayer in connection
with the present depression in the financial
and business world.” It is this sort of thing
that makes the Church look ridiculous in the
eyes of the scoffer. The depression is now
fully two years old, and if the massive, in-
tolerant Calvinists, who rule and are the tyrants
of Melbourne, had any special faith in their
own nostrum, it may be safely assumed they would
have tried it two years ago, when the trouble
first began. When the Church, in its indivi-
dual capacity, has a violent corn or an agonising
back tooth, it doesn’t wait two years before
it sends for a doctor—provided it has any faith
in the doctor. Moreover, the Church, up to
date, hasn’t done anything of a surprising
nature to ease the depression, saving that it
has pounded its pulpit cushion considerably on
the subject. It hasn’t voted any of its salary
to feed the hungry and provide pants for the
naked. Almost the only thingit has contributed,
m fact, is the supply of land-boomers and fraudu-
lent bankers who created the disaster, and it has
neither censured this gang of swindlers, nor
expelled them from its capacious bosom, but has
rather shown a desire to -whitewash them and
wail over their failure to keep theswindle going,
•he Church, in fact, consists mostly of
boomers, and it is these same individuals who
' v ant to humiliate and pray at a time when it
would be much more seemly if they would go
out and hang themselves. The spectacle of
the Church gathering together all the thieves
nnd dishonest bankers of the province to
humiliate themselves in bell-toppers and broad-
cloth and much valuable jewellery, and to pose
as salt of the earth, and pray for the
return of the good old days when they could
always get the working-man’s savings on fixed
deposit and nobody threw any doubt upon their
balance-sheets, and lament that the hand of
I rovidence is heavy on the land because of
the want of religious observance among
the depositors who are sleeping out
beside the Yarra, is horribly grotesque’
but the Assembly is impervious to humour
and doesn’t see it. The Bulletin has its own
idea of the kind of humiliation and prayer
which Victoria is most in want of. It would
set apart a Sunday for the performance,
because the man who is lucky enough to have a
job in these times can’t afford to lose a day’s
wages at the present starvation rates in order
to attend the ceremony. The devotions
would begin with a procession through the city,
rail the land-bank directors going in sack-
cloth and ashes, and all the boomers, and the
speculators in allotments, and a solemn array of
ten thousand pious church members with
their fraudulent accounts and their insol-
vency schedules dragged in front of them by
the common hangman. And along with them
would go the members of the last three Cabinets
in rags and without boots ; and most of the
clergymen of Victoria with a huge bill pasted
on each one, telling the amount of his stipend,
and how much of it he gave to the poor, and
the name of the building society or land syndi-
cate that he was connected with ; and all the
members of Parliament similarly decorated.
And then it would yard this mob in the Fitzroy
Gardens, where all their ruined creditors would
pray for them, and sing hymns for the rest of
the day, and when evening came on it would
turn them loose and let them go home alive —
if the public would let them. If any kind of
humiliation and prayer would help Victoria in
its present strait, this is the kind that would
do it. There is nothing wrong with the remedy
itself: it is all a matter of humiliating and
praying for the right individual.
—
The “Argus” on Home Buie.
Melbourne Argus, in a recent leading article,
struck a new argument against Irish Local
Government:—
If an Irish Parliament were established, it would have
to levy taxes principally upon incomes and upon land. If
the former tax were made too high, the industries would
be taken elsewhere, and the burden of supplying the
Nationalists with public offices would fall upon the land.
But, on account of recent legislation, the land is coming
gradually into the possession of the farmers. The farmers
would, accordingly, have to bear almost the whole brunt
of the expenditure of an Irish Parliament. Is this a pos-
sibility that any Irishman can contemplate with
equanimity? Does it afford the slightest hope that his
country would be one whit more prosperous under Mr.
Gladstone’s scheme than it is at the present moment? Is
there not every reason to fear that the position of the
people would be worse? These are questions to be con-
sidered calmly.
The Argus logic is good so far as it goes, bub
it doesn’t go far enough. What our con-
temporary quite forgets is that if the British
Government continues to be established it will
also have to levy taxes ‘ ‘ principally ” on
several things, and if one thing is taxed too
much it will probably be abolished, and then
the burden of supplying the Queen and the
British Tory peers with public offices will
naturally fall on the other things. This, also,
is a question which requires to be considered
calmly, and it tends to show that the British
Government should be abolished. It also tends
to show that every other Government should be
abolished, right down to the local authority
that looks after the paving and the street-
lighting, and the police, and the drainage.
Further, the Argus horror is based entirely on
a presumption : “if the former tax were made
too high ” Ireland will burst up, and, there-
fore, the Irish Parliament is not to be
thought of—which is about as logical as
remarking that if the Victorian Cabinet were
to bolt down Collins-streeb without its clothes
on the country would be much shocked, there-
fore there should be no Cabinet at all, and the
country should be run entirely by the Governor.
A calamity which consists entirely of the fact
that if something happens something else may
possibly ensue and then another thing will,
perhaps, take place, seems to suffer from too
much remoteness.
Two of the unpaid Mclb. magistrates who went
baldheaded for the acquittal of Matthew
Davies and Millidge considered that the
Crown evidence had been refuted by Gyles
Turner (!!!) Another of them, Mr. Gardiner,
threw in promiscuously an opinion that “ a
verdict of committal would not tend to improve
the present calamitous state of things.” This
particular sage, then, considers that the epi-
demic of bank smashes, which has resulted,
from the scandalous Mercantile smash, is an all-
powerful reason for any magistrate to strain
and point and let the Mercantile smashers go
free. No wonder that the venerable “ dis-
senter,” Mr. M'Donald, should say, “ When
the names of the magistrates who have
addressed the court are published, the public
will probably arrive at their own conclusions.
To me, as a very old magistrate, the case is
very clear.” The public have arrived at their
own conclusions, and it is very clear to them
that Melbourne wants a few more M ‘Donalds,
Even should M ‘Donald be bounced out of his
determination to commit Matthew Davies and
Millidge for trial, the fact that one magistrate
spoilt a cleverly-planned coup will always be a.
matter for congratulation. But for him Aus-
tralia would have been disgraced by the
spectacle of those two men being carried!
triumphantly out of court by their influential
friends, in the disguise of martyrs to unwar-
ranted suspicion.
♦
The Bulletin wonders whether magistrate
M‘Donald, of Melbourne, has received any
private and important communications on the
subject of his refusal to acquit Matthew
Davies and Millidge right away. The Bulle-
tin even dreams of the out standing beak being
conducted into dark corners and told that his.
first decision was “ inadvisable ” in the present'
disturbed state of public opinion on bank
matters. Weird, peculiar figures, surmounted
by responsible silk hats, seem to catch him by
the button-hole and ask him to consider the
folly of thinking differently to Henry Gyles
Turner, who holds that all the dealings in
connection with that £lOO,OOO were technically
correct. In the silent watches of the night The
Bulletin sees large, fat ghosts drawing the
attention of poor McDonald to the fact that
the Crown Law Department altered' at the last
minute the indictment against the Mercantile
bankers, and the grin of these spectres as they
wink the other eye is extremely horrible. The
Bulletin usually wakes from that nightmare
with a start occasioned by the office-dog. The
faithful animal is barking at a certain copy of
the Argus which contains a report of some-
body observing in the Victorian Assembly
that the Crown’s eccentricity was calculated to
produce a miscarriage of justice and a general
feeling of surprise, both at home and abroad.

Let the Democratic voters of Australia engrave
imperishably on the tablets of their memory the
unrestrainable joy, the frenzy of gratified malice,
evinced by the daily papers of Australia, and
particularly by the Sydney Daily Telegraph,
upon what it conceived to be the grave of the
defunct Queensland Democratic Party. When-
ever the D.T. claims in the future—as it is sure
to do when it would fool the N.S. W. workers
—to be the toiler’s friend, let its late d. t. of
delight be resurrected and remembered. When
the time-serving penny organ —controlled by a
set of traders and commission men, whom and
whose interests only it represents, again speaks
smooth words of flattery to the workers, and
pimps for votes for one of its own patrons, let
the mask of bogus friendship be torn off,
and the Tory organ be confounded with
the echoes of its recent jubilate.. The
workers of N.S.W., with this latest evidence
before them, are asses indeed if henceforth they
ever for a moment expect one honest, dis-
interested service or one deed of true friendship
from the D.T. A trap must be suspected in
every overture, however specious, Falseness
must be felt to lurk beneath every smile and
every cringe. Like “Madam Bubble,” the
daily press only offers its person, its purse, and
its bed to its intended prey. But when it has
got its prey down—as in the present Queens-
land case—see how joyously it foots a fandango
ever the prone carcase !
The Bulletin predicted, weeks ago, that
Matthew Davies would plead, through his
counsel, the excuse that his official position
prevented him watching over the bank
which nourished so many Daviesian tentacles.
It duly popped up in Fink’s speech : “In 1891
he was terminating his second period as
Speaker. In that year the session was pro-
tracted right up to Xmas Eve ; and while he
was fulfilling these arduous duties, the minute-
book showed no more than the ordinary weekly
attendance of an hour at the bank by the
directors.” An hour, indeed ! He wasn’t
always there for a full hour. When the board
was considering an advance of £25,000 or so to
one of Matthew’s prosperous little companies,
was it not usual for the gallant knight to “with-
draw ?” The blessed minute-book says so. And
it is quite certain that the chairman of a bank
never exercises control over the institution in
any way that isn’t explained in the minute-
book. Good old minute-book ! It tells as
much of what the people want to know as the
average good old auditor.
Graham Berry was the first of Victoria’s
“ distinguished ” men to put the great Gyles
Turner-crto-James Service salvation of the
country game in its proper light. The salva-
tion failed to come off, and now Berry candidly
observes that “ the remarkable enthusiasm
shown on behalf of the Commercial Bank after
the public had, by their action, closed its doors
has puzzled the other banks, so that instead of
making any determined struggle to meet a run
they feel inclined to follow suit in the recon-
struction process.” This idea was in the mind
of every sensible man who had no strong per-
sonal reasons for praying that the precious
Commercial might be pulled out of the mire it
had waded into. But no sensible man breathed
his thoughts aloud for fear of exciting his
idiotic neighbour—and one’s neighbour is
generally an idiot—to denounce him as a
“ traitor.” Was Turner, the high-priest of
boom speculation, to re-erect his fallen bank in an *
“unassailable position” (ride “respectable”press) :
at the expense of the banks that had managed
to hold up ? The injustice of the fulsome
praises bestowed on the Commercial trick
became more apparent when the scare caused
by the big smash began to bring down the stir- ■
viving houses. If Turner had accomplished '
a glorious thing, what had he done to deserve a
monopoly of the glory and the sole right to
public confidence ? They, the other banks—
prepared to back their assets against those of
the Commercial for soundness —should also con-
fiscate deposits for a period of five years and
increase their share capital. A good every-
bank-for-itself argument, too. At the end of
five years, when the long-locked-up money |
begins to fall due, the i-cconstnicted bank that
has realised the least on its old assets can go
under and remain there. lii the meantime, j
none, except the very strongest, could afford to
run the risk of being slowly bled to death (if ,
they outlive the panic), that their blood might •
be injected into the one particular bank which j
so many powerful and deeply-interested in-
fluences were conspiring to boom.
For years it has been a common saying in Mel-
bourne that any well-known “ duffer ” could
get a big overdraft, or an advance on anything,
at one or more banks, whilst the unpretentious
trader would be sternly reminded that his
account was £5 on the wrong side. Bank
managers, The Bulletin repeats, have kept
very bad company, and flourished on the
use of depositors’ cash until the supply ran
out. It is absurd to say that all the money
must be in the country. Some of it went to the
absentee holders of city and suburban land who
were glad to sell at fictitious prices. Quite a
lot of money was swallowed in the form of
champagne. Think of the mushroom men who
drank French fizz by the bucketful during boom
time! They didn’t pay for it. Their tem-
porary wealth was borrowed from the banks,
and although those rampageous institutions
were presently said to be putting the screw on,
they couldn’t screw back magnums of Dry
Monopole or any other imported liquors.
Worth, of Paris, and the English drapery,
furniture, jewellery, and fancy-goods trades got
their share of that boom-gold with which the
banks created representative snobs and bogus-
(, land values. And so much cash has gone for
i ever. The banks, or some of them, invested
their deposits in human securities of a
thoroughly rotten character, and no scheme of
reconstructioh can wipe out that disgusting
fact.

“Walker, London,” which was produced
at Sydney Criterion on Saturday night, with good
financial results, is a tale of the yearnings of a
barber whose soul revolts against his sordid occu-
pation of removing superfluous hair from this
tenement of clay. Therefore, in his desire to soar,
he abandons a stout girl named Sarah upon what
was to have been their wedding-day, and by a
series of accidents finds himself upon a house-boat
on the Thames, and the guest of various society
people who imagine him to be a colonel and an
eminent African explorer. Thereafter the story
begins to travel somewhat heavily, and the barber
—who is a dreary person at the best—threatens
to be bogged in a good many different places. He
is only saved by the awful stupidity of the society
people, who can’t see the discrepancies in his
African geography, and who are guiltless of the
anatomy of the chimpanzee, and evidently don’t
know the habits of the tree-crocodile, and the
bread-fruit, and the whangdoodle, and the other
monstrosities concerning which he feebly stuffs
them. Also, his explanation about the way
gorillas are killed—which is simply that “ when
you meet a gorilla, what else can you do ? You
have to do it!”—ought to break up the reputation
of any explorer. But the barber lives on peace-
fully and unsuspected, , and becomes engaged
to a pretty girl, and is regarded with
gaping wonder by the rest of the family,
and borrows their clothes, and tells them
how he slid down the Andes, and how the ladies
in Africa go about with nothing on—till one awful
night when he can’t find his best suit, and going
on deck discovers Sarah asleep there and grasping
his pants hard in her dreams, and then the grass
witherethand the flower fadeth, and he feels that
he is lost. Nevertheless, he manfully quenches
Sarah by threatening to dip her in the river, and,
having crowded her into a punt, he states with
suppressed emotion that he is going back to
Central Africa, and vanishes into the darkness.
And when they ask for his address, presumably in
case they should want some more information
about the chimpanzee on a post-card, or about the
gorilla by telegraph, or concerning the red ant by
letter, a voice out of the gloom answers unac-
countably, “ Walker, London.” Whereupon the
curtain descends leaving a general sense of incom-
pleteness and a hazy recollection about an old
lady having finished a knitted under-vest in the
Alhambra.
• # •
The humour of the barber depends almost
entirely on Mr. Brough—the barber himself has
practically none. There is much more genuine
fun in one “ W.G. (a schoolboy),” played in a joy-
ful fashion by Mr. Boucioault—a youth whose life
consists chiefly of reverence for a man who made
121 runs against Norfolk; and if this person could be
enlarged so as to over-shadow and partially blot
out the barber’ it would-be a good thing for
“ Walker, London.” Also, Mr. Chichester—gener-
ally a harmless member,of the company—blooms
into sudden glory as one Andrew McPhail. The
rest of the honours descend in a golden shower on
Miss Brenda Gibson, with a few over for Miss
Temple. A one-act play, by Clement Scott,
which is thrown in because “ Walker ” is rather
short in the tail to be a whole entertainment by
itself, is chit-fly remarkable on account of the fact
that in it Frank Cates does really and truly play
one Davy Wright, whereas he generally only plays
F, Cates. Titheradge and Mrs. Brough their
best for this show, which is a sick and depressing
trifle, consisting principally of a lunatic sleeping
in an awkward position on a sofa.

Bland Holt’s first appearance at Sydney
Lyceum was a great and massive event. There is
a wildly Oriental gorgeousness about Bland when
he gets enough room to spread himself, and on the
vast stage at the Lyceum he developes into a
pageant of the first order. The size of the spec-
tacle dwarfs the performers, and half the time
they look like ants wandering in front of a pano-
rama. The two great features of the drama are
the Finish for the Derby and the Shipwreck, but
smaller ones are scattered around everywhere;
even the poorest and baldest scene of the lot has
six times as many features as Crick had when
Haynes was dragged off him, and the worst of
them is brighter than Crick’s eye after Haynes had
done hitting it. As for the play, “A Million of
Money ” is somewhat better and more intelligent
than the average spectacular drama. It is a story of
the downward slide of a garish ass who had a vast
sum left him by his uncle, and straightway pro-
ceeded to waste it, contrary to the advice of a
red headed divinity student, upon a siren, who
afterwards dies of hunger on a rock with her hor-
rible, insane husband bounding around her and
wanting to cut her head off with a table-knife.
Also it is, incidentally, the story of the ass’s
deserted wife who, while mourning in her desolate
home, sees this tragedy faintly in a vision,
like a crucifixion viewed through a Brussels
carpet; and watches the siren’s Nemesis prowling
about for a chance to cut her in 16 pieces and
stick a separate sixteenth of her on each crag
and pinnacle of their lonesome island. The rest
of the story consists principally of the wicked
major, who loved the deserted wife many year g
ago when he was still a comparatively good and
pure major; and the major’s confederate Bounder,
who rounds on him in the fifth act as that person
always does, which proves that the typical major
should always kill his confederate Bounder in the
fourth act if he wants to save himself from
destruction; and the red-headed student who,
all through the story, stretches out a bony,
freckled hand to save the millionaire from
destruction, and finally seizes the confederate
Bounder, and partially smothers him at a railway-
station, and makes him tell all, and then
offers him a billet as an organ-blower. Bland
Holt performs the red-headed student, and though
that person does practically nothing except hover
around and mean well, he manages to convey an
impression of much humour, and comes in for an
ovation. The other more prominent members of
a very strong company are Mrs. Bland Holt,
Misses Henrietta Watson, and Maud Williamson,
and Messrs. Sass, Baker, and Fabert —who is an
artistic triumph as Bounder. Mrs. Holt, like
Bland, has no definite part in the plot, but she
stands round gracefully, and looks beautiful, and
extends a small white hand in time of trouble,
and hounds the divinity student on Bounder’s
trail. A lot more enthusiastic commendation is
held over.

This nation has sinned grievously, and has
done evil in the sight of the Lord, and now its sin
has found it out and its transgression has risen up
like a ghost in the night and refuses to be laid.
The evil that men [do lives after them, and the
corpse of their dead past—though it may be
secretly buried in a cave—will rise up in the
noon-day, and call aloud for vengeance. Sydney
is full of broken banks and fraudulent finance
companies, and the Government is inwardly rot-
ten, and the legislators bang each other in the
senatorial halls—therefore has Providence raised
up George Rignold and incited him to play the
lugubrious “East Lynne ” at Her Majesty’s next
Saturday as a visitation and a curse upon the
people. And, in order that the vengeance may be
all the more awful, the sickly, maudlin tragedy is
to be farther adorned —for the first time —with a
view of the railway accident in which Isabel Car-
lyle is supposed to be killed. The Bulletin
views “ East Lynne ” as a Divine vengeance, and
as it is no use trying to dodge Divine vengeance,
this paper urges the public to roll up promptly
and have it over. Whether a man has to see
“East Lynne ” or to get his principal back tooth
taken out, it is no use postponing the evil day.

The “Slaves of Sydney” goes up next
Saturday at Sydney Royal in place of “ His
Natural Life.” Concerning the new drama but
little seems to be known, though a great deal is
strongly suspected. The “Georgia Magnet”
turned up as a new attraction at the Royal Stan-
dard too late for notice in this issue, but the
manner in which this lady lifts huge, fat capi-
talists with her white forefinger, and positively
declines to be lifted herself by tiie combined
efforts of four coal-heavers, and the manner in
which she makes massive personal property cavort
around like feathers in a gale of wind, will be
explained next week.
* * * *
Harry Rickards’ latest attraction, at Syd-
ney Tivoli, is a new chorus, “ Br-room-de-doo-
dum.” Mr. Rickards holds the Australian rights
of “ Br-room-de-doo-dnm,” and anyone infringing
the same will be prosecuted.

What was intended to be one of the most
gigantic advts. ever received by an artist was the
Cosmopolitan Club show, in Sydney Town Hall,
to boom Sculptor Leysalle. The large attendance
was very good-humoured, for everybody—singers,
artists, musicians, printers—had given their ser-
vices, so if the plaster-cast of Mayor Manning,
who sat on the stage while the hero of the hour
evolved his alleged likeness out of blobs of mud,
was more like Minister Suttor than the sitter—if
a lady tried to sing the Jewel Song through
clenched teeth —and if you quite failed to see the
inwardness of a cart-wheel of laurel being handed
to Mons. Leysalle by a person who hasn’t a corner
in laurel, so to speak, and no more visible authority
over the herb than any other person in a clean
shirt and a new smile —well, you simply looked
away. There was much light and music and
enthusiasm oyer the entertainment, which was
permeated with the gaiety inseparable from a
Frenchy festival. Miss Manning unveiled M.
Leysalle’s “Rescued from the Floods” group,
which, when purchased from the sculptor, may or
may not find its way into the National Gallery.
Club President Kowalski, Madame Kellermann,
MM. Deslouis, Wiegandand Poussard headed the
contributing musicians, and Messrs. Collingridge,
Spence and Tom Roberts contributed lightning
sketches,

“La Cigale” drew a great audience to
Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday. All parts of
the house were crowded with people who, speak-
ing generally, knew the strength and weaknesses
of the show beforehand, and therefore expected
nothing more than was given to them. “La
Cigale ” is a French opera translated down to the
requirements of Mrs. Grundy, a female even more
potent in Australia than in the land of her birth.
The giddy, vain singer of the original version is
transformed into a young woman of excellent am-
bition and moral character, happy in her virtuous
“engagement” to a chevalier with long hair.
Mrs. Grundy’s Marton has no apparent connec-
tion with the foolish Grasshopper of La Fontaine’s
fable. A gifted vocalist of eminent respectability
may break off her engagement to a chevalier with-
out seeing visions of an impecunious future,
when she will wander back to the “old
home ” in a snowstorm, bereft of her last
bonnet. The moral of that vision scene in
the third act seems irrelevant to tlie matter
under discussion, and the amphitheatre very pro-
perly received it in a derisive spirit on Saturday.
Why not dispense with the absurd scenic inter-
polation? To the story as told in English it is of
no value whatever. The damsel might swoon, as
usual, and be taken to the ante-room where the
duchess could turn penitent in the same old way,
and nothing need happen differently to now. Out
out the false vision. Pat it aside in a place of
safety until next pantomime season comes round.
Then tag it to the harlequinade, and let the thrift-
less, dissolute clown, brought to misery and want
by his misdoings, return, like the prodigal, to the
scene of his innocent boyhood. A first-class idea,
although we say it ourselves.
* * •
The dancing, always an important feature
in this opera, is rather more festive than before.
It is noticeable, too, that the Duke’s own parti-
cular ballet-girl, La Frivolina, doesn’t go into
convulsions of jealousy when Mary Weir con-
tributes a serpentine-dance. Possibly, however,
it was La Friv. who insisted upon Miss Weir’s
tights being bright-green instead of pink fleshy-
coloured, whereby much of the sweet suggestive-
ness of the real “serpentine”is lost. The whirler
manages her transparent draperies with skill, and
her step is very light, but the effect of the green
legs in the limelight is somewhat bilious.
Howard Vernon has advanced, if possible, upon
his first representation of the ducal sinner, and
Ryley is still a bright figure of a chevalier. Also,
Florence Young has gained experience in all
respects, save the management of her long arms,
which always seem to have been fastened on in a
hurry, and to work stiffly at the joints. As a
mere pair of arms they are delightful, but as
acting portions of Miss Young they frequently
fail to move with the times. George Lauri closely
imitates, and perhaps improves on, Elton
appears as the Dutch uncle, and the minor
characters, not forgetting the donkey, and
Lissant’s little picture of the blind-man, are
made the most of. Up to a certain point, Violet
Varley is very good in the title r6le. She has
never been so prettily displayed before, and
though her singing is not as dramatic as Marie
Halton’s, the freshness of her voice very nearly
equalises matters. But a character which touches
tragedy is as far above Miss Violet’s present
capacity as her stature is short of a real prima
donna’s. Local feeling favours her, as it favours
Flora Graupner, but the fact remains that a
specially small-sized “star,” whose manner is no
larger than herself, tends to diminish the effect of
any performance in its entirety. Pity the tiny
pair can’t be amalgamated ! What a fetching
woman they’d make !

“The Vicar of Bray” is announced for
Saturday next, and in this essentially British
opera the newly-imported prima donna, Miss Fffie
Clements, will debut. The new tenor, Joseph
Tapley, makes a first appearance at the same

for tickets is assured.

The Alhambra advertises the continuation
of business without reconstruction. Also the
Steens, at St. George’s Hall, are rejoicing in the
support of the clergy and others interested in
spiritualism. They talk of raising the devil there
at an early date. The Gaiety defies the banks to
do their worst, and the Waxworks has put up a
champion light-weight kangaroo to fight adversity
to a finish. People appear to flock freely through
the gates of the new Jerusalem Cyclorama, and
Snazelle has inaugurated “rational Sunday even-
ings ” at the Opera House. A deeply religious
sentiment pervades Snazelle’s entertainment. The
programme concludes with “Rock of Ages,” the
verses of that respectable hymn being flashed on
to the sheet by G. H. S.’s dark lantern, so that
the audience may not sing secular words for want
of knowing any better. Then comes a collection
at the doors for the poor heathen ; Snazelle beinir
the heathen in this instance.

George Darrell’s season at Melbourne
Royal closed with the orthodox benefit on Mon-
day night. It was expected that the indefatigable
actor-manager and builder of plays would revive
something or other from his heap of manuscripts,
but he contented himself with two final represen-
tations of his Melbourne Cup drama, and then
departed for Adelaide. So the old Royal is shut
up once again. This, like most other things in
Melbourne, is not as it should be,

The Vic. Artists’ Society is giving another
exhibition at the new gallery, Eastern Hill, Melb.,
by way of protest against Josh. Lake’s show of
British and Australian (especially British) pic-
tures. The display is exasperating in its preten-
tion to be worth a shilling to go in and another
shilling for a catalogue. Victorian art is only
Victorian art —the production, practically, of a
city containing 400,000 inhabitants—and it over-
estimates its strength. It spreads itself over too
much space, and pretends to go in freely for
sculpture when there is no sculpture there, Percival
Ball not being represented. The present writer
speaks as one who spent two shillings upon the
entertainment provided by the Vic. Artists’
Society, and who considers that the. florin ought
to have purchased one or more of the least satis-
factory pictures hung upon the walls. Good work
is to be seen here and there in the three rooms,
but the localism of the local painter becomes too
evident. The Society cultivates mutual admira-
tion rather than the Art which consists of some-
thing more than a notion of drawing, snpiwrted
by a knowledge of technical terms. The V.A.S.
should digest Reynolds’ discourse upon “ Imita-
tion in Art,” and disabuse its collective mind
of the idea that it can detect inspired some-
things where the eye of unenlightened man
sees nothing but a pitiful combination of
incapacity and impudence on canvas. In the
matter of putting extravagant values upon their
works, the Victorian artists are less ridiou-
lous than formerly, but there are again some very
small pictures on very large canvasses, and in
appallingly huge frames. The chief offender
again is Fred C. M‘Cubbin with “Found.” A
quite uninteresting old man has found a ghastly
representation of a lost female child in a clearing
in the bush. The figure of a man in the alleged
distance is apparently signalling the glad tidings.
The scheme of colouring is Vic. art, and a haze of
paint is over it all. Mr. M'Cubbin has produced
an ugly, irritating picture of heroic dimensions
price 270 gs. “A Harmony in Gold and Silver ”
by Tudor St. G. Tucker, is a fat-faced, brainless-
looking little female wrapped in a white mist.
Perhaps she is clad in bridal array, or possibly
she has just been confirmed. Her figure, as far as
can be seen through the mist, is that of an un-
graceful little woman, but she may be a child not
yet endowed with a “waist.” She is destitute of
all charm, anyway, and her surroundings are in-
explicable. Tudor St. G. Tucker estimates this
mystery at 00 guineas. Another female by the
same brush has a pleasing face and many points
to recommend her but no clothes oil. She
is, indeed, a study from the nude of a good
natural tint all over, and effectively placid in spite
of an impossible kink in her body. A creditable
attempt with a difficult subject, Mr. Tucker calls
the picture “Day Dreams.” The girl is lying o n
a long hair mat, a bed-pillow thrown carelessly
aside, and unless her dreams are sultry she must
be likely to catch cold. Mr. Tucker has other
large pictures on show, all of which seem to have
suffered from the circumstance that his front
names are Tudor St. George. That is to say, they
have the air of assuming to be something very much
out of the common. The best of them represents
a girl lying humanly and gracefully (she is, no
doubt, the other girl clothed and in her right
mind) upon a salad-green sward. The turf is
impossibly gaudy, but the artist has not laboured
in vain, J. Mather, not quite up to his usual
high mark, shows water pieces for the most part
and his sea sometimes gives one the impression of
being out of the level. Three or four large
portraits, notably one of Professor Tucker by
E. P. Fox, show plenty of strong painting. If
this is a true likeness of Tucker, however, the
Professor ought not to sit for any more portraits.
He doesn’t make what ladies call “a good one.”
Arthur Loureiro has pictures hanging there, pain-
ful samples of that unlovely Victorian Art colour-
ing in which he is pre-eminent. There may be
the results of hard work and intelligent study in
these productions, yet they are not true pictures
of anything, to the writer’s eyesight, even when
they are not untruly drawn. Some promising
little landscapes by A. W. Bassett are less out of
harmony with the real appearance of things than
many others, but the most convincing scenes in
the show are contributed by J. (? Miss) Suther-
land. Four of them hung together are good, un-
pretentious pictures, pleasant to look upon. They
seem to have been suggested by facts, and not by
the yellow, brown, and liver tints of the repre-
sentative Victorian landscape painting. Amongst
two or three hundred oil and water-colour efforts
not particularised there is merit more or less, or
no perceptible merit at all, but not a dozen
pictures which are conspicuous for even reasonably
good colouring. The Victorian artists have
founded a school of artificial tinters, and the
scarcity of buyers for works of this school is the
only natural effect they can lay claim to.

Archibald Forbes’ fee for lecturing in and about London
is twelve guineas. Melton Uriah costs a shade under this
figure, as he will discourse for ten guineas, a sum which
Fred. Villiers and Bennet Burleigh can also command.
Harry Furniss has come down a peg, for whereas he used
to get twelve guineas for “Caricatures” and other illus-
trated lectures, he will now accept ten—a sign of the
times. Du Maurier, of Punch, is in demand at twenty
guineas, which no doubt will be reduced as he begins to
be played out, as they all do. To thcss fees must be
added exes, when travelling out of the London radius,
according to distance.
Extract from a private letter received last week from
London by a Bulletin correspondent:—“The ‘Becket’
performance, at Windsor Castls, went off most success-
fully—though does not speak with enthusiasm
about the Royal hospitality. A medley meal, called a
dinner, was served at four o’clock, the service and plate
being magnificent, but the viands few and unsatisfactory.
In fact, a feast for the eye only was provided. They
reached the Cast le at noon, and as everyone had break-
fasted early they were fairly famished before the meal was
served, and no intermediate refreshments were obtainable.
and went into the town and bought a pie on
their own account. The performance commenced at
9 p.m. The old Queen seemed greatly interested and was
loud in her applause. She sent for Irving, Terriss, Ellen
Terry and Miss Ward, but not for young Australian
Byrne. She unluckily praised Terriss’s hingly manner as
Henry 11, so Terriss, who was already several tirmstoo
large for this world, will now want a new planet created
for him. Miss Terry carted off young Byrne and intro-
duced him to innumerable dukes and duchesses and to
Princess Beatrice Battenberg, so he was not quite in the
cold. There was asupper afterthe play, and Paddington was
reached soon after 2 a.m. There is one funny incident I
must tell you. The company was arranged in four
sections—A, B, C, and D, A representing the principals,
B thedressers,attendants, and orchestra, C the carpenters,
gas, and properly men, and D the supers. Four rooms
were arranged for the simultaneous dining of these
parties, each room hearing its distinguishing letter.
Now for the story : ‘ Plain Bill ’ Holloway—who since
playing Lear during Irving’s illness is now disposed to
look down on even his manager—was inflated with a
double dose of loyalty when he reached Windsor, but his
self-importance rose equally. In the lobby, or in one of
the corridors, he saw several gentlemen-in-waiting, and
mistaking their uniforms for liveries said to one of them,
in his most lofty tragic style, and in a voice 200 fathoms
deep, ‘ Er—l say—just get me a cigar, will you—or show
me where I can find one.’ The equerry, who must have
been a born humourist, said, sweetly, * Oh, certainly,
with pleasure. Just come this way;’ and he conducted
him to room D. Wasn’t it lovely? Bej'ond all the
supers, invading their dining-room and getting half-
fuddled as soon as they arrived, and being ordered by
Irving to sleep for two hours to wear off the effect -which
they did—the proceedings were marred by no accidents.

best have been done by Brough or Thornton.

Besides contests for two double-seated
constituencies —Charters Towers and Rockhamp-
ton—the elections for seven single Q. electorates
will take place this Saturday, but in only two of
them will there be a square, man-to-man fight-
in Bundamba, between Labour-leader Glassey and
mine-owner Thomas; and in Maranoa, between
Labour-candidate King and “der only farmer’s
freimdt vondimes,” Francis Kates. At Burrum,
a “ farmer’s representative,” Biddles, will help
the MTlwraithian Tooth (defeated by Power at
Maryborough), by taking away votes from
Labour-candidate Willard. At Croydon, Labour-
man Browne stands a show of slipping in between
two MTlwraithians —Morgan and Hunter —-unless
(which is dangerously likely) the “ contingent
vote ” counts adversely. At Kennedy, Baby-
Minister Lissner gets a much-needed lift by the
intrusion of M'Culla, sailing as “ Independent
Labour,” to the detriment of Labour-candidate
Jackson; the “contingent vote” here may also
alter the first count. Lockyer should have a per-
fect shivvoo, with —station-agent Kellett and
Armstrong as land-grabbites j R. Hall as a fanners’
representative; and the irrepressible W. O.
Hodgkinson as an “Oppositionist.” What s
Hodge’s little game this time? At North Rock-
hampton, four candidates have a regular mill—a
Ministerialist, a Labour-man, an “Independent,”
and a nondescript. These contests will bring the
number elected to 63 out of 72.
Out of 52 members-elect of the new Q.
Assembly, the MTlwraith party claims 34
nominees, or already within two of an abso-
lute majority not counting the casting vote
of the Speaker or Chairman. As there are 30
more seats to be filled, MTlwraith may be re-
garded as fairly in the saddle, unless his
health breaks down and necessitates his
absence, when the elements held in suspen-
sion will commence to react on each other,
and precipitate unexpected ineompatibles. The
coming three years in Queensland will pro-
bably prove the seed-time of terrible harvests.
The only votes upon which Labour can with
certainty count as friendly in all stresses are
these five, so far—Crosse, Fisher, Hoolan, Read,
and Turley. Those of the Oppositionists and
“Independents” who may be regarded as occa-
sionally sympathetic with Labour are_ seven
Chataway, Daniels, Drake, Leahy, Lovejoy, Mor-
gan, and Powers. So that the Labour vote, at
its present very best, numbers 12 out of 52 ; at its
worst, five. There is one alleged “ Independent ”
who may be classed as an unadulterated M ll-
wraithian —a barnacle of squatterdom the
chief heir of the scattered crumbs of Jimbour
—J. T. Bell, eldest Joey of the late Joshua
Peter, whose crumpled-up estate floated intoaco.,
furnished the choicer morals in the big Mortgage
Co.’s law-suits last year ; and yet this fresh-from-
Oxford youth had the alpine impudence to style
himself an independent champion of Labour !
Shades of old grandfather Tom Bell ! Old
Queenslanders will recollect the times when “ wool
was down ” and station-mortgages were being
ruinously foreclosed, but when Jimbour was, as
the phrase went, “so deeply into the banks ’ that
the latter institutions had to stand by it and lift
the “fine gentleman” over the puddle into the
good times of a wool rebound. Can any of the
spawn of the lords of the soil of that period ever
be a workers’ champion? Ernest Stevens, son of a
Warrnambool grocer, another alleged “indepen-
dent,” is a monopolist’s man every tune, a chum
of the laud-jumping squatter, and on minor
matters only an in-and-out voter, whose chief
fad is to denounce payment-of-members as un-
gentlemanly and vulgar and degrading ! In
spite of the present odds against the Queensland
Labour-party, there must be no heart-failing in
the Democratic vitals. Though a succession of
sweeping defeats may make the hearts of the
masses bitter, ultimate victory is as certain as the
past collapses of all ancient tyrannies, which blazed
in their days like fierce suns, but were blown out
by the draughts through their own leaks.
The opening of the Ideal Portrait Co.’s
photographic gallery at 480 Oeorge-street, the
other day, makes a tally-spot in the notched-stick
of the Sydney Art calender. The Ideal Portrait
Go. holds the rights of the American patent
known technically as the “Air Brush, an inven-
tion that, skilfully controlled, sprays the photo,
enlargements with Indian ink, or other colours,
and minimises the labour of stippling, thus
enabling a reduction of 75 per cent, to be made to
the customer. The walls of the vestibule of the
Ideal Oo.’s premises exhibit to great advantage
large-sized portraits of eminent newspaper no-
bodies, celebrated somebodies of the stagepmore
or less notorious politicians, and some well-known
artists, sculptors, and johnnyallsorts. Hilda
Spong, as titania, J. P. Macdonald, as a well-fed
theatrical lessee, can be gazed at as illustrious
samples of the art-perfection now brought easily
within the reach of most people.
Next Saturday (May 20) will witness the
fourth set of Queensland elections, seven in num-
ber, after which all but two members of the new
Assembly will have been returned.

being 631 and 610.
The Bundamba (Q.) election will be fought
out this Saturday. Labour-leader Glassey is there
opposed by Thomas, a coal-mine proprietor, who
professes to hold in his certain grip the votes of a
few hundreds of working miners out of the thou-
sand and odd names on the roll.
Andrew Petrie downed Gannon for Toom-
bul (Q.). Gannon gammoned to turn In-

Charters Towers (N.Q.) could not induce
an undisguised MTlwraithian candidate to dare
its polling issues, though Sayers, “ Independent, '
may be regarded as a Ministerialist so far as
Labour is concerned. The other candidates for its
two seats are Labour-men Dunsford and Dawson,
and “Republican-martyr” Vosper.
The Barcoo (Q.) election, which takes
place next week, is being worked in the sinuous
style that should become recognised as inspira-
tionally MTlwraithian. To cumber the chances
of Labour-member Kerr against Ministerialist
Banks, two alleged “ Independents ” are divert-
inglv introduced. When will Labour learn the
value of organic unanimity ?
South Brisbane (Q.), should have re-
turned two Labour candidates, considering the
splitting up of the MTlwraithian votes, but Mid-
son, who managed to gain second place, had the
full benefit of “contingent” voting, being the
least objectionable of the land-grab nominees, a
connection of that old Griffithite party with whom
land-grant railways were anathema.
The Mitchell (Q.) electors will be asked
next week to decide between candidates C. B.
Fitzgerald and J. A. Campbell, both friends to
the workers, and squatter Cameron. Under the
pitiable circumstances, the only hope of the
Mitchell workers returning one of their men is for
all voters for Campbell to give their “ contingent
votes ” to Fitzgerald, and all Fitzgerald’s suppor-
ters to vote secondarily for Campbell.
Billy Smyth came in second at Gympie
(Q.), but was beaten hands down by Labour-man
Fisher. Stumm, Billy’s mate, was fourth on the
list. Had not Chappie made a fifth man as a so-
called “ Independent Labour ” candidate —he was
a bad last—Gympie would now have been repre-
sented by two Labour members, as Ryland was
onlv 26 behind Smyth, while Chappie lured away
249” votes, or 23 more than Ryland was
behind Fisher. A clear loss to the Labour-party,
through Chappie’s fault.
B. D. Morehead owes his return for the
Balonne (Q.) district to the strictly domestic
organisation of the Pastoralists’ Association,
which had successfully driven most of the hand-
workers whose names were on the Balonne roll
out of the district; and generally gave good, long
engagements to men who had votes in other dis-
tricts, so that neither the men who were refused
work nor those who got it were able to roll up to
the ballot-box. In the whole of the Balonne elec-
torate only 393 votes were polled, all told !
Labour-candidate Ogden, who secured
third position at the Townsville (N.Q.) polling,
was only displaced by the second man, Burns, by
three votes, in spite of the spreadeagling of the
workers’ choice in the uperop of four candidates
all claiming to be Labour-men, as against two solid
MTlwraithians. Had there been no contingent
vote, Ogden would now be in Parliament; had
there been no “ independent ” intruders and no
contingent vote, two Labour members would now
sit for Townsville. But significant indications
like these will not stay the arrogant greed of the
monopolistic gang.
Dear Bulletin,— The medicine - woman
multiplied in Sydney, and the most noticeable
thing about her is that the newer the degree the
bigger the brass-plate tacked on to her portal.
And in this connection I would like to say, in
hollow', Sphinx-like tones, that when any lady
wants to be elected to anywhere she should choose
her nominator as carefully as she would a new
hat. If you are at the mercy of a ladies’ com-
mittee, vour nominator should be a pleasing man,
gifted with a melting eye and an idyllic parting
to his hair. It is most unwise to pose as the
protegee of a Fiji idol in spectacles and modern
evening-dress, under circumstances akin to the
above. N.B. —These impenetrable remarks are to
be read upside-down in a mirror at midnight.
—S.S.
M‘Master and John Watson, now both
MTlwraithian M.’s P. for Fortitude Valley, were
deadly political enemies in the days when Griffith
called MTlwraith a steel-rail rogue. M'Master
was for years an uncrowned king in the ‘‘Valley,”
and the working-man there was his trained gull.
Watson, a Scotch Roman Catholic, was always a
MTlwraithian creature, and swore for years by
the clan and by the “ Boozacawts” (the Buza-
cotts). The Labour candidates polled badly in
the “Valley ” —once a working-man’sconstituency,
and the result shows how well the electoral rolls
had been “purged ” ; also how the sectarian votes
were manipulated. In North Brisbane, the R.C.
vote went to MTlwraith and to his chum Kings-
bury ; while the Protestant votes went to Kings-
bury and his chum MTlwraith. So with Watson
and M'Master, only the majorities were reversed.
George Adams’ (Tattersall’s) hotel—a huge
building which spreads from Pitt-street right back
to George-street, Sydney—is, since the completion
of the new bar, about the most popular rendezvous
in the city. Tattersall’s is now known chiefly by
the new bar, which is a dream of Oriental magni-
ficence, and only requires a sultan sitting up on a
throne at the further end to bo a palace. Very
few people ever succeeded in compressing more
hard cash into a small space than Mr. Adams has
done. For example, he has spent over =2lOOO in
pictures with one Sydney artist. Hisjiew estab-
lishment is a malachite drunk, a d.t. in lapis-
lazuli, a porphyry “ bust,” a delirium petrified in
marble and Corinthian columns. Consequently,
“ Tatt’s ” bar has practically become the centre of
the city, and everybody who wants to meet any-
body instinctively goes there to look for him, and
anybody who wants to find somebody sits down
there and waits until the ether person drops in—
which, temperance apostle Allen will be sorry to
hear, he invariably does in half-an-hour or less.

Savage, strident song, 1
Waken from tlieir slumbers
Ox-bell, horn, and gong !
Swing the scaring tocsin
Till the dead grow quick—
Latest thing in boxin’

Shout an epic that’ll
Meet a long-felt lack ;
Sing the bloody battle,
Shriek the sounding smack !-
Howl the swift collision
All in words that clang,
West Macquarie’s vision
Bunged with one big bang !
Ho ! ye men of Derry,
Listen to this lay,
Things with you are very
Far from being gay ;
Your great Cause don’t prosper
As it used, at ’Ome,
And the cloven, phosphor-
Scented hoof of Rome
Seems about to step on
William’s sacred bones!
Brandish every weapon,
Hunt for sticks and stones }
To the Bones prove loyal,
Rush to take arms up—
In this battle-royal
Victor was the Pup !
Let the Orange banner
On the breezes swim,
Glorying in the manner
John reached Patrick’s glim !
Bid the Orange doglet
Give a joyous yelp
Haynes a swinging slog let
Crick have — such a skclp !
O the murtherin’ “job ” he
Fetched him in the eye —
It was in the lobby,
People standing by :
“ As a legislator.
You,” says Crick, “ are not
Quite the clean potater ”
That’s as far’s he got.
“ Anything more sludgy
In the way of brain,”
Interrupted Mudgee,
“One would seek in vain
Than is on your shoulders
Shortly after that
Several beholders
Standing forninst Pat,
Saw him in his dander
Seek his foe to smite—
O ! the weak left-hander !
O ! the deadly right!
O ! the sudden scrimmage !
O ! the' sickening thud !
West Macquarie’s Image
Fallen in his blood !
None knew it was in you,
Jack, or thought you strong—
Who could guess such sinew
Grew in Wollongong?
None believed at that trick
You were half so quick—
“ Call him off !” said Patrick,
“ Lemme up !” said Crick 1
O ! the iron muscle
None knew of before 1
O ! the hideous tussle
Over half the floor —
Shout the skies in sunder,
Orangemen, nor stop,
Rome throughout was under—
Yellow Pup on top !
True, the sky seems frowning
On your noisy crowd ;
Even N. B. Downing,
When he shrieks aloud,
Cannot get a hearing—
Hooted for his pains—
Still it may be clearing,
Help may come from Haynes !
Therefore, men of Derry !
Heroes of the North—
For to-day be merry,
Peal the tidings forth ;
Sing this thing and shout it,
Set to music rude ;
Here is all about it —

The Rockhampton (Q.) election two
vacancies—is a straight duel spoiled by the inter-
vention of Separationist Curtis, between two
Labour-men and two MTlwraithians.
A candidate named Forrest (it has a
MTlwraithian sound just now) has stepped in to
spoil the straight-out issue in the Leichhardt (Q.)
district between a squatter and gridiron-map
Hard acre.
Billy Little, ex-M.P., and now a MTl-
wraithian candidate, will probably hold on to the
Woothakata seat (N.Q.), because the Labour
electioneers up there have put up two candidates
instead of one only against him.
The Clermont (Q.) Labour-electors have at
last paid out John Chinaman Stevenson, a part-
ner of B. D. Morehead, who thought he had a
perpetual lien on the Clermont constituency, by
returning the workers’ man, Crosse.

themselves in New South Wales. Now that you have
come, I feel sure that yon have COMB TO STAY.

more than satisfied with it. I firmly believe that it is the
best machine on the market.
There is one thing I would advise intending purchasers
to do—that is to study the alignment of OLD MACHINES.
If that is done, they will see the superiority of the
“ YOST.”
The beauty of the work of the “ YOST ” has been conv

Premier M llwraith, we are told, never
employed a Kanaka on any station directly owned

manager, MTI wraith even refusing to allow wages
for his services.
That brilliant lawyer,

settled contempt of court
in curious and summary
fashion. One day he was
proceeding into court to

a stranger barred his way,

him, said, “Confound

The Judge paid no atten-

“ Confound you, Judge

obstructionist. The Judge,
not being sure he heard

Everybody who knew the late Carl Feil-

When Thompson Moore, ex-M.L. A. (Vic.),
was working on Ben ligo goldfields, 40 years ago,
he acted as cook for himself and party. It was
noticed how quickly the “dry ” tea went, and on 6
morning the cook was questioned upon the sub-
ject. How much tea did he use at a time?
Replied Moore promptly : “ A handful for each

G. H. Reid boasts that he went to work at
13 years of age. It wasn’t killing work, however.
He merely answered the door and carried letters

journalistic exercise was the only thing like hard

The Czar did not, it seems, tell his Im-
perial engineer to drive over 42 peasants, and the
odds are 50 to 1 that he didn’t get dropped into a
river, as cabled. In fact, The Bulletin believes
nothing more about the Czar except that he is
very likely dead. A ruler who, more often than
not, is represented in public by a waxen effigy,
might be dead a long while ere the newspapers got
hold of his decease.

Parkes likes polish. When in the
height of his glory a few years ago he visited Mel-

office messengers. A crowd of distinguished people

mittees, rode about 40 miles, from one town to
another where he was to address the electors.
When half-way, his horse trotted off with a bag
on his back containing Mason’s speeches, statistics,
&c. At the next town, one of his opponent’s com-
mittee-men met and caught the horse, and, on
examining the bag of papers, handed them to the
“other fellow,” who was just going to address a
meeting. He promised in advance everything that
Mason meant to promise and knocked the bottom
out of all Mason’s arguments.
London Police Gazette describes the
absconding Jabez Spencer Balfour, ex-M.P. for
Burnley, the pious fraud of bubble company
notoriety, whose victims represent hundreds of
thousands of pounds in workmen’s savings :
Aged 50, but looks at least five years older. Height,
about sft. Cin. ; very corpulent, broad shoulders, short
neck; legs have the appearance of being too weak for
weight of body. Hair (thin on the top, parted in centre)
dark, turning grey; eyes (prominent) grey; very thin
straggling whiskers and heard dark (turning grey);
moustache dark-brown ; very fat. flabby face ; usually
dressed in dark or black jacket suit; high black hat.
But why doesn’t the Police Gazette editor boil it
down? “Looks as if lie had a stake in the
country ” would have covered the lot—“ legs too
weak for body,” Snd all. In fact, a typical Fat
Man.
The Sydney pen-lady who “reminisces "a
about Gov. Jersey makes no mention of the#
political cooper of Newtown. This Walpole of
the Cask desired to stand for a country constitu-
ency, but being temporarily short of cash he in-
tended Earl Jersey to stand in with him. “Your
lordship has the money,” he said, “ and I have the
brains” (ye gods!); “we agree absolutely on alll
important political matters, and as your position!
binds you to silence the use of me as a tongue is-
worth thinking about. I should suppose <£Bo wxlll
carry me through.” Gov. Carington was the re-
cipient of even funnier proposals.
A problem raised by the recent Haynes-
Crickslogging-match inN.S.W. Parliament House.
Crick, who has long travelled (chiefly per aid of his
ugly frown) on his reputation as a bruiser and a man
of stupendous strength and valour, and is alleged
to have thrown John Norton down a stair, was
simply crumpled up by Haynes. Now Haynes,
a few years ago, was collared and dragged all over
the floor of the House by Fletcher—now deceased.
Therefore, how much would have been left of
Crick had he met Fletcher instead of Haynes,
and how glad he ought to be that he didn’t ?
This problem is to be worked out by the rule of
three, and the answer sent by post to William
Nicholas Willis, Esq., M.P.
The late Judge Cope, of Victoria, used
sometimes to doze on the Bench. One day, sud-
denly and loudly, counsel asked a witness, with
his eyes at the same time fixed on the Judge to-
note the effect on his Honor of the expected
answer —“ Were you ever charged with an indict-
able offence, sir ? ” The tones, and the eyes fixed
on him, startled the Judge from his reverie, and,
not quite awake, he stammered out —“ No, no ;
only five shillings for letting off fire-crackers !”
and then solemnly added, “and that was when I
was a little boy.”
Arthur Desmond, who was fined £3 and
costs in Sydney the other day for writing the
words, “ gone bung,” on the Government notice
guaranteeing the re-payment of the money lodged
by depositors in the N.S.W. Savings Bank,,
strongly contends that he performed a public-
service in drawing attention to the insecure
condition of the deposits aforesaid failing a per-
manent Government guarantee—inasmuch as at
least the liquid portion of the savings of the public
are deposited in one or other of the associated
banks. When Desmond was arrested, the police
and the press gave it out that he was insane.
Here is a piece of verse from his enthusiastic
brain, printed long ago in The Bulletin. It
contains several lines which any man in the world >
might be proud of having written :
OUR KING THAT IS TO COME. *
“ He shall give justice to the poor of the people—he
shall save the children of the needy and shall break in
pieces the oppressor.” —King David’s Song—No. 27.
O, the Leader of the Future, will he come to us as comes
The chief of conquering cohorts ’mid the roll of battle-
drums ?
Will he come as came the victor in Olympian days of old,
Will he come in regal raiment with a gleaming crown of
gold—
A crown of gleaming gold,
A crown of gleaming gold,
Will he come in regal raiment with a crown of gleaming
gold ?
No, his hand will bear no sceptre, and his brow will wear
no crown,
And no robe of Syrian purple shall enfold his loins around,
His throne shall be the heart of Man and he will utter
words
To thrill the listening myriads like reverberating chords—
Like reverberating chords,
Reverberating chords.
To thrill the listening myriads like reverberating chords.
A hero—vindicator he will come at first as comes
The music of a clarion-call above the roll of drums,
O, let us list in hopefulness to hear the prelude song
That will tell desponding millions—“ Lo thy leader’s
marching on ”
Thy leader’s marching on,
Thy leader’s marching on,
That will tell desponding millions—“ Lo thy leader’s
marching on !”
No nimbus shall illume his brow—no flashing diadem—
Yet his name will shine resplendent as the lustre of a gem,
And the Emperor of the Universe upon this man will
smile,
Who’ll beard the lofty and the proud like Moses by the
Nile-
Like Moses by the Nile,
Like Moses by the Nile,
He’ll beard the haughty and the proud like Moses by the
Nile.
He’ll view the hosts of tyrants with their battle-flags
unfurled,
And his heart will bleed in anguish for a subjugated
world,
Then—his voice will sound a bugle-blast, his hand will
grasp the pen,
Each word will mean an army-corps, each line a million
men—
Each line a million men,
Each line a million men,
Each word shall be an army-corps, each line a million
men.
He’ll bare his brow to heaven, and he’ll speak the word of
might
That will shatter marshalled foemen as the morning
scatters night,
And the lords of iron legions and the robbers of the poor
Shall fnrl their blood-soaked banners to rule and rob no
more—
To rule and rob no more,
To rule and rob no more,
Shall furl their blood-soaked banners to rule and rob no
more.
His nation shall be nations, and Truth his sword shall be,
To cleave the mail of mighty ones and set the captive free,
Yet, come he will, in lowly guise, with neither trump or
drum—
Up ! Up ! Prepare the way for him, the king that is to
come—
Our king that is to come,
Our king that is to come,
Up ! Up 1 Prepare the way for him, the king that is to
come.

“We seem to be doing everything in an emo-
tional manner nowadays. The remarkable en-

The Canadian-Pacific railway, from Mon-
treal to Vancouver, is the one from-coast-to-coast
transcontinental railway in the world under one
management throughout its entire length. It
climbs, pierces, and leaps the magnificent Rocky
Mountains, the majestic grandeur of whose
scenery, where Nature huddles convalescent from
unthinkable convulsions, cannot be adequately
conveyed by any art of language. The dizzy
traveller is equally charmed and awed by the
daring engineering that has threaded a safe track
along precipitous verges, shouldering glaciers,
plunging boldly down shudderful gorges, piercing
rock-bored tunnels, or stilting it across ravines on
giant trestles, till mountains recede, rivers broaden,
the Pacific Coast is neared, pre-limned by restful
river scenery, and, with a view of a fine ocean-
basin, Vancouver is reached. The trip across
occupies six days and nights—a week of indolent
domestic luxury combined with a wonder-course
of natural education. The Canadian-Pacific line
fcrms the overland stage of a favourite globe-
girdling route between England, Australasia,
Japan, and China. The Canadian-Australian
Steamship Line (Agents: Burns, Philp and Co.,
10 Bridge-street, Sydney), connecting with the

Retrenchment.
The pruning-knife of financial reform has been
unsparingly used in the various Government
departments. The members of the Civil Service
have been classified, and an earnest endeavour
manifested to consolidate the working forces of
the various offices and minimise expenses. We
shall, therefore, soon feel the pulse of our national
life beating with a healthful vigour that will
electrify the world. Commerce and trade will
flourish once more, our credit will be thoroughly
restored, and the scares of the past few days re-
membered only as the phantoms of a disordered
brain. That the physical health of the people
will be assured, we need but quote the
words of those universally respected gentlemen,
Captain Fisher, Stipendiary Magistrate, and
Captain Heselton, J.P., which are as follows.
The former says : “I have used Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, and I am convinced that it is a valuable
therapeutical agent possessed of excellent Tonic
properties.” And the latter writes ; “ For many
years I have used Marshall’s Tonic Nervine, and
I can therefore personally testify to its many ex-
cellent strengthening properties. I may say that
I have also, on many occasions, presented it to the
employees of the company, and always with the
most beneficial results. I conscientiously consider
it to be a most invaluable Nerve and Brain restora-
tive, a thing which even the robust sometimes
may require. I gladly subscribe my name to
endorse the merits of a remedy like Marshall s
Tonic Nervine.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Wesley an s are very strong in the new
S.A. Assembly.
The want of confidence motions are now
all towards the banks.
The balance of Power is with the workers
when they have a Ballance.
Fourteen insolvents in North Brisbane
electorate own among them 100 votes.
Svdney Evening News again pronounces
definitely against payment of members.
At Wollongabba (Q.) election, despite
"contingent” pitfalls, not one of the 617 Labour
votes recorded was informal.
The annual interest on public loans pay-
able by N.S. Wales amounts to .£2,072,860. The
total amount outstanding is .£54,209,933.
The epigrammatic A. G. Taylor, now
managing Echo Farm Inebriate Retreat, appar-
ently does not like to say right out whether he
will stand for next N.S. W. Parliament.
Lord Howe Island, a little speck in the
Pacific from which N.S. Wales gets a few bags of
onions annually, cost the province for mainten-
ance during the past 27 mouths .£1845 15s. 2d.
An employe in Melbourne money-order
office was promptly "sacked ” for predicting that
the National Bank would be the next to go. Truly
a prophet is not honoured in his own country.
M‘llwraith will probably be returned to
power with a strong majority. But. whatever
happens, a repetition of the scandalous legislation of
the coalition is no longer possible in Queensland.
The plural votes recorded at the polls held
in Brisbane for the outlying constituencies of
Oxley and Woollongabba were alone sufficient to
absolutely ensure victory for the land-swindle
candidates. _
Reading Melbourne papers, one is led to
believe that every workman attending a deputa-
tion to a politician in office is expected to produce
credentials as to his respectability, signed by a
parson or a J.P.
A beautiful contrast is afforded by the
haste of N.S.W. Council to pass the Bank Issue
Bill and their alacrity to destroy the Marine
Board Reconstruction Bill. Their haste in each
case was grossly indecent.
“ A meeting ” is one thing, “ a public
meeting” quite another. The Empire Defence
League meeting was advertised as "a public
meeting of citizens ” : any citizen, therefore, had a
right to submit an amendment.
The S.A. Legislative Council Labour repre-
sentatives gave South Australia free education
two years ago, and now it looks as if the Labour
members in the Assembly have, in the nick of time,
appeared to prevent its abolition.
“ Thrift ” again. No less than 60 members
of N.S. Wales Legislative Council attended early
on the morning of Wednesday week to pass the
Bank Issue Bill. There are but 71 members on
the roll, and five are absent on leave !
Trickett, M.L.O. (N.S.W.), is fathering a
bill to reduce the Public Works Committee from
13 to s—three from the Assembly and two from
the Council —three to form a quorum, and com-
mitteemen to receive <£2 2s. a day instead of
£3 3s.
In Bouillon, a commune of Belgium, land-
nationalisation has come about on a small scale.
The local government owns about a third of the
soil, and as a result not only are there no taxes,
but a considerable annual dividend is paid to each
inhabitant.
“‘Financial Crises,’ says Max Nordau,
‘are simply the piston-strokes with which the
capitalists pump the savings of the industrial
classes into their own reservoirs.” the
time for every Democrat to read Nordau’s “ Con-
ventional Lies of Civilisation.”
The special trains at excursion rates run
by the M‘llwraith party to facilitate the record of
plural votes were crowded. Hundreds of votes
were thus recorded at Dalby, Aubigney, Stanley,
Ipswich, Oxley, Toowong, Woollongabba, North
Brisbane, and Toombul on the same day.
The Downer (S.A.) Ministry will, it seems
certain, be defeated immediately the new
Assembly meets. Holder and Kingston may join
forces, and there is the off-chance that Playford
and Cockburn will be in the new Ministry.
Kingston, it is presumed, will be Premier or
nothing.
Tricky orator, at Woollongabba (Q.) :
“ Gentlemen, Willie Stephens, the boy politician
whom we put into Parliament five years ago, is
still the same. ("Hear, hear,” from MTI-
- He will never ” —with emphatic slow-
ness—-“no, never— be —a — man!” (Wild cheers
from the Anti-grabbers.
“Ninian Melville supplements his income
as Chairman of Committees in N.S.W. Assembly
by running a second-hand furniture shop,’ says
the Australian Workman. Quite right. No
man should be above his business. Melville’s
office is elective, not permanent, and he cannot
depend on his State salary.
Parliamentary privilege ! N.S. Wales
Speaker Abbott has ruled that, under the Consti-
tution, two M.sP. may punch each heads
in the Parliamentary vestibule, without interfer-
ence, but that strangers blackening each other’s
eyes “within the precincts ” are liable to be run
in. After this decision, no time should be lost in
providing Parliament-houses with a prize-ring for
the use of members.
The reassuring Age on the situation :
“Unpleasant as is the position of the public of
Victoria just now, owing to the general want of
confidence in its banks, the condition of affairs is
by no means without a parallel. All communities
of any antiquity have suffered from time to time
from similar deplorable panics.” But then Vic-
toria hasn’t any antiquity. Its chief boast at
home and abroad is the toadstool-like newness of
its marvellous capital.
Secretary Bevill, of the N.S.W. United
Licensed Victuallers’ Association, challenges a
press correspondent’s statement that there are 750
pubs, in Sydney (out of a total of 850) in the
hands of the brewers, and conducted by salaried
managers, paid from =£3 to =£4 a week and com-
mission ; also, that the U.L.V.A. numbers only
about 150 members. But Bevill gives no figures
to support his general denials, beyond stating that
the U.L.V.A. numbers more than five times 150.
Six thousand pounds have been spent on a
chapel, opened by Bishop Goe, the other day, at
Melbourne Church of England Grammar School.
This is as a test to the head-master, who is
required to preach therein. Heterodoxy and
Democracy go hand in hand. Higinbotham’s
son-in-law, Professor Morris, was “a splendid
man,” till he followed the lead of Prof. Pearson,
of the Presbyterian Ladies’ College, in Melba’s
days. The Victorian atmosphere is so corrupting,
full of Socialistic microbes, and your boy’s mind,
little Master Tallowphat’s, may be poisoned ere
you know where you are.
Sydney Daily Telegraph’s chief objection
to the abolition of garnishee orders against wages
is that the workman living in lodgings will not be
reachable, whereas the man who furnishes his
house will be liable to distraint. The objection is
worthy of attention —not as against the abolition
of garnishees, but only as against distraining on
necessary household furniture. A workman is
allowed his tools of trade as against creditors, and
the extension of this allowance to the necessary
furniture for himself and family is a reasonable
corollary. No credit should be based on the
creditor’s power to turn men, women and children
into the street.
Salomons, Q.C.,
is determined to figure
no longer as a “fos-
sil” of the N.S.W.
Legislative Council.
He believes his genius
to be of the initiative
character, and will
seek a seat in the
Lower House with
the intention of “ let-
ting her go.” His
difficulty is to find
a party. Although a
man of many strifes
he heals quickly.
He one day
thinks of running
against Dibbs, on
another of tackling
See at Grafton, and
later still of fighting
Barton for East Syd-
ney. The men of the
Lower House whom
he most admires are
M'Millan and Bruce
Smith.
Already certain
smart S. A. politicians
endeavour, with the
aid of the S. A. Regis-
ter, to trap the
Labour - members by
suggesting a “ com-
promise” between the
“ country party’s ”
programme and the
labour platform. The
country party in-
cludes all the “ Ass ”
representatives and
the game is to induce
thelabour men tocom-
promise on the land
tax. Which they won’t
The Behring’s Straits difficulty proves the
wisdom of U.S. Secretary Seward, in securing
Alaska from the Russians in 1807 for a song.
Canada is thus between two jaws. Glad England
would have been to buy Alaska, but Russia had
no idea of allowing a sort of Gibraltar opposite
its Petropaulovski and Yladivostock. England
would have paid 20 times as much as Russia asked
of the States—but it was not to be.
A member of N.S.W. Parliament grew
eloquent at the refreshment-bar a few evenings
ago on the advantages of a national bamk, and
scornfully upbraided the elder politicians for
allowing a young country like Queensland to take
the lead of N.S.W. in banking legislation. It
transpired that the wrathful member really
believed that the Queensland National Bank is
owned by the State—instead of owning the State !
Ex-Premier Parkes opposes the abolition
of the N.S.W. Parliamentary refreshment-bar,
and declares it wicked for any body of members of
the House to attempt to dictate to other members
whether they shall or shall not drink spirits ; and
then on Parliamentary notepaper he writes to
the secretary of a Local Option League, stating
that he will with pleasure attend a public meeting
next month in support of local option, and will do
all he can to suppress the nefarious, soul-blighting
traffic.
The fear of the Melbourne unemployed
that the much-vaunted, parson-blessed Labour
colony will turn out a pauper institution is not
without good reason. Premier Patterson was .
asked twice during an interview with a deputation !
if men taking advantage of the colony would lose
their votes under the Rolls Purification Act. _ Ihe
wily J.B. dodged the first question. When it was
pressed again he replied, shortly : “ I think you
are more concerned with victuals than votes.
First victuals for votes, then neither victuals nor
votes —and be damned to you 1
Mat. Reid, successful Labour candidate
for Toowong at Q. general election, was_ formerly
assistant to John Burns in the organisation of the
dockers prior to their great strike, and on arrival
in Brisbane preached the Single-tax doctrine on
Sunday afternoons at Victoria Bridge. Some two
years ago, at a public meeting called by the Early-
Closing Association, presided over by, at that time.
Chief Justice Lilley, he delivered a strong social-
istic Labour speech, causing consternation among
the clergymen and so-called Labour M.’sP., who
had seats on the platform, and was afterwards
taken to task by Lilley. The electoral victory
over ten-shillings-a-week Unmack is hailed with
delight by the Democratic party.
The Queensland electors of outlying con-
stituencies must, before next general election,
insist that all the ballot-papers shall be taken to
one place, and mixed together, before the count.
As it is, a dozen papers or so are counted at each
of as many different places, and (especially on
stations) the men who have dared to vote straight
are marked for dismissal. The squatter can
always make a very shrewd guess who voted for •:
Labour when there are but a dozen voters in all.
On many stations, especially those of the big
syndicates, the men got very broad hints that if. '•
any Labour votes were cast there would be a -
“reconstruction.” This must be stopped, even it
it should take a month to get the papers to the.
principal returning officer.
Copeland’s interjection in N.S.W. Assem-
bly that Michael Fitzpatrick was among the
strongest supporters of the local Public Instruc-
tion Bill, recalls the fact that the deceased poli-
tician lost his career through the very thoroughness
and pertinacity of that support. . The great bulk
of his co-religionists threw him over, Archbishop
Vaughan making no disguise of his personal anti-
pathy, and the Parkes crowd, among whom he
fell, after using him to the uttermost, turned their
backs on him when the service was over. I itz-
patriok died a disappointed man. Had he
remained a schoolmaster, as he was in early life.

THE SLEEPLESS ORATOR.
“Hullo, off on the wallaby?”
“No. Didn’t you hear! Jawbone Neild, M.P., is in town. I’m going
to hear him speak, and I’m going prepared—that’s all.”
or a member of the Civil Service, as he afterwards
became, his closing years might not have been
embittered by so many conflicting emotions.
The Sydney dailies, of course, attempt,
chiefly by innuendo, to make out that
M'Credie defeated that political duffer, the
“ reconstructing ” Nobbs, for Central Cumberland
election because of the former’s antagonism to
payment of members. There is no truth in it.
Nobbs’ building society connection, allied to the
fact that the bank scare had made all “suspen-
sions” very unpopular, decisively laid him out.
The cries at Nobbs’ meetings of “ What about the
people you’ve made penniless?’’ betoken the under-
current of public feeling that swept Nobbs into
the limbo of forgetfulness. Apropos, is Mr.
M’Credie a man of independent means? If not,
how does he propose to earn his living and pro-
perly discharge his legislative duties simultane
ously ?
N.S.W. can, in a few hours, enact legisla-
tion to help wealthy shareholders out of financial
troubles arising from their own recklessness and
greed, but tens of years pass by while urgently-
needed domestic legislation is neglected. After
all the villainies exposed during the past few
years, there is no law, any more than ever there
was, to prevent the establishment of a bogus bank;
there is no law to test the stated value of any
bank’s assets—or worse, ten million times worse
still—the value of the assets of any life-assurance
company. And how have the life-assurance com-
panies fared in the bank smashes? There is no
means of definitely ascertaining. Quack remedies
like Dibbs’ Bank Issue Bill, to help corporations
which have over-traded and are insolvent, are
labelled “ cordial co-operation,” and are enthusi-
astically swallowed whole by the Upper House,
the House of Stomachs, which jointly and sever-
ally arises at 9 a.m. to endorse the measure ; but
radical legislation of the kind needed is contemptu-
ously termed “sick nursing” and “spoon
feeding.”
The rough-and-tumble worrying which
Crick, M.L.A., got from Haynes, M.L.A., the
other evening, in one of the corridors of N.S.W.
Parliament House, was apparently a premeditated
business that miscarried —probably for want of
sufficient rehearsal. Crick got angry over the
obstructive tactics of Jawbone Neild and Haynes,
in re the Attorneys Admission Bill, and remarked,
with restrained enthusiasm, and probably in a
purely figurative way, to Frank Wright (M.L.A.
for Glen Innes): “I’ll plug those (substantives)
directly.” “ Well,” observed Frank, reflectively,
‘“if you plug anybody, you’d better plug Neild
first. If you start to plug Haynes, you mayn’t
live to plug the other man.” (Somebody else told
Crick this, years ago.) Crick’s bill was still in
Committee when tea-time came and shouldered it
over sine die, and Crick went out feeling savage.
But Neild didn’t happen to cross his immediate line
of route. Haynes did. Crick, it seems, snapped at
Haynes, who sneered back. Crick made an
abortive blow at Haynes’ face. In a twinkling,
the pair were rolling and squirming about the
floor —-Haynes generally uppermost. A delighted
ring of spectators—hon. members, general public,
messengers, etc., kept edging back and leaving a
fair space for the ground action, till Crick was
heard painfully yelling—“ Take him off! Ta-a-ke
him off !” After some feeble undecidedness, two
policemen (who should traditionally have gone
round the corner) laid hold of Haynes by the
legs and released Crick from his grip. Crick had
a fine swollen and bleeding eye, with a patch of
gravel-rash or something beautifying half of his
face, and seemed to have had just about enough ;
but Haynes was simply panting for gore, and
wanted blood for supper all the rest of the even-
ing. By the time the scrimmage was stopped,
Jawbone Neild had lounged along, and he busied
himself sci entifically exploring Haynes for inj uri es,
and found that he had lost a shirt-button and a
coat-button. (John has been that bad hundreds
of times.) The picturesque accounts of the clumsy
sprawl given by each principal to a news-re-
porter are wonders of skite. Crick seems to be
pained at heart because Haynes, after getting
him down, didn’t spring up and count 10, and
generally observe Queensberry rules, and his
threat that he would make Haynes fight it out
fairly at the first convenient opportunity is the
final squeak of a busted concertina. On the other
hand, just listen to Haynes’s gobble-gobble :
I never like to strike anyone for fear of my great
strength. People do not know how strong I am. . . .
I am often afraid to strike people, fearing I might harm
them.
According to Samson Haynes’s—this name is going
to stick —version of his own prowess, he was
simply carrying Crick all round the place, trying
to find a nice little closet where he could undis-
turbedly murder and eat him, but Crick’s legs
would keep giving way at the knees, and all that
Crick wanted to do was to lie down. It is little
affairs of this kind which endear the victorious
country member to the hearts of his constituents
—and utterly discounts the other fellow.
A Depraved Appetite.
A craving for extraneous and undigestible
materials of all kinds may occur in all people, but
most frequently and prominently does it appear
among those employed indoors, and next in fre-
quency among stout people. This depraved or
deranged appetite makes its appearance generally
during the winter, although it may also occur in
summer.
The disease consists in a disturbance of nutri-
tion. The abnormal appetite is instinctively
caused by a lack of potassium, sodium and lime
ealts in the blood ; by insufficient digestion of the
food, or its fermentation in the stomach, and con-
sequent acid-formation. The food materials given
do not include the normal contents of the
various salts named, are deficient in nutritive
elements, relax the digestion, the gastric juice is
secreted in insufficient quantity, and its com-
position becomes in course of time abnormal, loses
its digestive strength, and thus digestion and
nutrition become faulty and we lose in general
condition. As in the case of all nutritive dis-
turbances, the skin becomes dry, unyielding, hard
and covered with dandruff. Sometimes softening
of the bones becomes associated with this con-
dition, because it is due to the same causes.
Eor all cases we recommend Clements Tonic,
which is the greatest invigorant of the human
stomach known to science. It has cured 40,000
cases of indigestion, flatulence, heartburn, liver
complaint, kidney disease, &c. This is no vain
boast of the proprietors, but a fact there is no
gainsaying, and one of the latest proofs comes
from the pen of Mr. F. T. Sharp, commercial
traveller, George-street, East Maitland, N.S.W.,
who writes on February IGtb, 1893 : —I have great
pleasure in bearing testimony as to the curative
properties of your valuable Clements Tonic. For
several years I have suffered from rheumatism in
the sciatic nerve from the hip up the spine. After
other remedies failing I was induced to try
Clements Tonic, and at once found relief there-
from. In fact, I can safely say that owing to its
wonderful virtues I am now thoroughly cured,
and able to attend to my duties again. At one
time I thought it was impossible to recover, as it
had become deep-seated and chronic. I have
much pleasure in adding this unsolicited testi-
mony to the number you have already received.
Hoping that others may also receive the same
benefit that I have done. —I remain, yours faith-
fully, F. T. Sharp, commercial traveller, George-
street, East Maitland, N.S.W.
W. T. Stead criticises a novel entitled
“ The Heavenly Twins,” wherein the writer
(a woman) argues that a bride has as much
right to expect a husband whose life has been
morally pure, as a man has to look for absolute
virtue in his conjugal companion. Stead fears
that the authoress “needlessly pours too much
spring-water unawares on the shrinking nerves of
an unaccustomed public.” This, from the author
of “ Modern Babylon” and the Dilke “Character
Sketch,” is charmingly ingenuous.
THE GENUINE
Wolfe’s Schnapps has a superlatively fine flavour,
and is a capital remedy for indigestion, bilious
ness and rheumatic complaints.

Society
Magistrate M‘Donald, the dauntless, after
Mating the cogent reasons that moved him to
doubt the legal innocence of Matthew Davies,
asked, How , then, could any bench of magistrates
arrive at any other decision than his?” And how
could Henry Gyles Turner consider that the loan
of £lOO,OOO, borrowed as a last desperate ex-
pedient from the Commercial Bank, was a “satis-
factory increase in the deposits at the Mercan-
tile? How can a lot of things happen in Mel-
bourne that do happen? The fact is that the
representative ” Melbournians of the present
day are a peculiar people—upright, honest,
generally pious, patriotic, remarkable for simplicity
of character—but very peculiar.
* # #
John M‘Donald, the “one magistrate one
decision ” man, is a Melbourne capitalist of the
solid order. Not so long ago he married a second
wife and in due course became the happy father of
a boy baby. This to the keen satisfaction of the
gentleman who had married his only daughter
some years before.
* * *
On dit that a young Australian medico,
more or less related to the English peerage, has
just married a well-known Sydney barmaid—who
will have a real live lady (a countess in perspec-
tive) for a sister-in-law.
* * #
It is at last officially announced that
Prince George, heir to the British throne, is to
marry Princess May, his dead brother’s fiancee.
It is likewise cabled that London Star publishes
a rumour that the young man has already been
married, secretly, to the daughter of a' naval
officer at Malta. “ Tis in the blood.” Were the
fact of the secret marriage publicly established, and
were it attempted to thrust the secret wife aside
against her will and bigamise in the good, old-
fashioned royal style, the monarchy might crumble
in a week. The rumour, which possibly has some
sort of foundation in fact—(by the way, the present
Prince of Wales’ youthful Irish liaison, so
disastrous to the girl involved, is not yet forgotten)
—recalls the George IV-Mrs. Fitzherbert alliance.
“ That selfish dog,” as Greville writes, put up
Fox, backed by the royal word of honour, in the
Commons, to deny the marriage. After the

In a Sydney marine
suburb a big man-
sion has long been
vacant and “ to let
at reduced rent to a
good tenant.” The
other day the good
tenant came along
and took it for a
prolonged term.
Then twelve fami-
lies, mustering about
fifty people in all,
moved in, and spent
the first two days
making furniture
out of palings and
thelike —apparently
the whole twelve
had been sold up m
some previous state
of existence, and
had resolved to club
together to save
expenses and make
the one remaining
saucepan do for the
lot. The rent of
the mansion is .£l2O
per annum, so that
each family pays—
or fails to pay—
about 4s. per week.
Ten of the families
have dogs, eight of
them keep fowls,
they all have a cat,
and two of the cats
have kittens, one
family wants to take
i n boarders, and
there are three par-
rots, a nanny-goat,
and about six in-
fants in the assem-
blage.
The Duke of York’s “engagement,
coming immediately after the story of his private
marriage to a girl at Malta, is certainly evidence
in favour of the private marriage. V.R. and her
Royal Family couldn’t let the obstacle longer in-
terfere with tho “ welfare of the Empire,” and the
Malta girl, no doubt, will be requested to name
her own terms for a morganatic divorce. ‘ The
story’ just about explains the singular delay in
the fixing up of the George-cum-May arrange-
ment.

The Australasian, in a fit of disloyalty,
reproduces the “ water colours and etchings ” by
Her Gracious and the deceased Albert, now on
view in Melbourne, and the throne is tottering in
consequence. No more abject collection was ever
passed off as art. One Bulgarian atrocity is
entitled “Old Women, by Prince Albert, after
Landseer,” and represents a cockroach leaning
against two toothpicks and talking to a rag-bag.
An “Eagle’s Head, by Prince Albert, after Car-
racci ” —Prince Albert is always “after” some-
body in this collection, like a snail running after
an omnibus —is obviously a dog’s head with
broken feathers on it. “The Queen” sends
mostly infants and pups, and her style is sug-
gestive of that primitive variety of art which
draws a man as a concern with a head and two
legs and nothing more. Almost all her girl
infants have idiotic jaws and lank, wispy hair;
some of them look bloated and some look vicious,
and they all have cavernous eyes and a general
aspect of insipid contentment. The most bloated
offspring of the lot is in long’clothes and gazing
at a parrot. The whole collection comprises
thirteen infants, five birds, two dogs, one nigger,
one drunken-looking monarch, and the aforesaid
staggering cockroach on two sticks, which pro-
fesses to be an old woman. The drunken
monarch, by the way, is by Prince Albert, “ after
Lucas.” If Albert had only lived a little longer,
what a chance he would have had to sketch Wales
after a ballet girl, or Edinburgh after half-a-
ero wn !
* # *
The Australasian also publishes a portrait
of Mrs. Clara Parker, which shows her as a nice-
looking lady, somewhere short of middle age, and
generally a slightly inferior edition of the beau-
teous Mrs. Gordon - Baillie. Considering how
matters have turned out, it seems a pity someone
didn’t introduce the latter lady, when she was in
her glory, to millionaire “Joe ” Clarke, and leave
things to work themselves out in the pages of
Joe’s bank-book. She would probably have cost
less in the end than Clara did, and there was more
of her for the money. Men of the unfortunate
Joseph’s kind don’t care for the young and unripe
charmer; when a very rich man is a trifle past his
prime, and is looking a little blotchy here and
there, and his hair begins to grow grey and strag-
glesome, he generally wants to make the acquaint-
ance of a handsome and well-developed Woman,
who seems about 30 (and really is about 37 or so).
Gordon-Baillie was calculated to look like an
attractive woman of 30 till she was 80. It is only
when the same man gets very old indeed, and is
all one blotch, and has begun to spill all his food
into his hoary beard, and has to get assistance to
lift his swollen hoof on to a footstool, that he
desires to “hear from” a girl of 16. Then he
throws out his middle-aged lady, and she generally
retires on the accumulated plunder—or, if she

The people of a certain northern N.S.W.

the chief performers being a churchwarden (who

the bank). She sits near his pew, and asks him
strange, irrelevant questions, not in the church
service, and to which there are no orthodox
responses, until he gathers up his Bible, &0., and
makes a bee-line to the nearest door.

At Broken Hill, last week, a labourer
named King shot himself in the brain with a
revolver. He walked a mile or so, and, two hours
after the accident, asked a doctor to remove the
l ea( j—which was extracted ; and then his condition
became “serious.” Wonder is expressed that the
man didn’t die instantly, instead of living to walk
about. It is wonderful, but there are many such
cases on record. For instance, Mr. Norton, P.M.
of N.S.W., who was shot through the brain by the
fascinating Mrs. Wilkie, lived and was sensible
for weeks. A few years ago a man who had shot
himself through the brain in Sydney Domain,
marched up and reported the fact to a Macquarie-
street surgeon. Both patients died.

tised. The Chinese are as unsatisfactory, from
a Christian missionary point of view, as the Jews.
And, like the Jews, they possess a large number
of admirable virtues with which Christians aren’t
endowed. The most odious creature on earth,
by the way, is the Jew who has crooked-mindedly
turned Christian for “ social ” reasons. And no
man born a Jew ever turns Christian for any

Every time the divorce-court gets into
full blast —and, for that matter, it is in full blast
most of the time—the impression grows stronger
that marriage is a failure. The pity of it is that
the divorce-court only keeps a record of those
marriages which are a failure ; the other kind are
never recorded. As a method of getting reliable
statistics all round The Bulletin suggests that
all couples found living happily together should,
say once in three years or so, be fined .£5 with
the alternative of seven days in gaol, with hard
labour. Then, by comparing the convictions
tinder this head with the divorce and wife-kicking
statistics, a tolerably accurate result would bo
arrived at. It is always best to stand facts on
their heads and look at them upside-down.

THE FAVOURITE PRESS “GAG.”
CONFIDENCE (after reaching the North Pole), is
now said to be returning rapidly.
The Paraguayans are gathering together in
readiness for the exodus to their paradise in the
wilderness. At Balmain (Sydney), Lane’s argo-
nauts have taken two houses in a small terrace,
and there about sixty men, women and children—
more or less —are crowded together, and more
keep dropping in. On their first arrival they were
mistaken for a circus. Then the general supposi-
tion was that they were a Buffalo Bill exhibition.
Next they were set down as an opera company in
low water. On the morning when the first
pioneers arrived the butcher and the grocer called
simultaneously, and when a quiet-looking woman
stepped out and ordered 001 bs of meat and 240
eggs they both fell backwards insensible. The
argonauts are a sober and seemingly well-con-
ducted crowd, and on Sunday they sing hymns
and hold service most of the day. The first rein-
forcement which turned up consisted of about
fourteen girls, and when they moved up
the street in procession, a rumour went round
that an idolater had arrived witli his house-
hold. A big, grave-looking, bearded man who
showed them the way was generally accepted as
the idolater. Then it was decided that the place
was a private hospital or a lunatic asylum, and
the quiet-looking woman who stepped out every
morning to order 800 eggs and about lOOlbs. of
steak and 144 loaves was set down as the head
keeper. Every now and then eight or ten married
couples drop in casually as an addition to the
number, and another piano arrives almost every
second day. Apparently the New Australians are
under cast-iron discipline, or else they are all
orderly by nature. Nobody is ever drunk or
noisy, there are no fights, none of the women call
each other a “eat” in the back yard, and the dis-
hevelled small boy who vociferates in the street is
instantly removed in custody. One theory is that
certain of the meh and women act as a police-
force, and that the two cellars serve as a gaol—one
for males and the other for females —where any
disturbing member is incarcerated until he or she
has cooled down.

A lady-member of Spurgeon’s Tabernacle
died the other day, and in her last hours the con-
gregation entrusted her with a message to be
delivered to the deceased preacher’s spirit up
above. The idea originated with the Taber-
nacle’s Yankee pastor, Dr. Pierson, and it has
excited a groan of horror on account of Its
“ irreverence.” Yet it isn’t irreverent; it is only
logical. The church professes a cast-iron belief m
a hereafter, and if the belief is real then there is
nothing surprising in sending a message by the
dying to the dead to the effect that the baby is all
right and is cutting his back teeth satisfactorily.
INFORMATION.
If you ask for information
You are far beyond salvation,
And, in pompous agitation,
Someone grabs you by the neck-er;
A person found distrusting
Reconstruction after busting
Is a scandalous, disgusting,
Rlanky, evil-minded wrecker.
Wrecker, avast! Seek not to blast
Any gentleman’s reputation,
By trying to look on a private book,
And yelling for “ information.”
Let your confidence continue
In the narratives they spin you,
Straining every nerve and sinew
To support your failing “ pecker,’*
And declare yourself enchanted
By the facts you take for granted ;
If you want the assets ante-ed
You are nothing but a, wrecker.
Wrecker, get! Nor dare to flout
The truth of an explanation ;
A bank that is poor can’t open the door
To a beggar for “ information.”
All the parties acquiescing
In the management’s finessing
Are deserving of a blessing,
But the canny, cautious checker
Must be sat upon, midst laughter,
From to-day and ever after,
By the haughty overdrafter,
Who is, after all, the wrecker.
Wrecker, you fraud, whom fools applaud,
Crush suspicion with indignation,
Be brazen and bold, and keep alight hold
Of that damaging information.
O Lord!
Behold us on our knees before Thee,
All broken up, and crumpled,
Ruined and rumpled,
Out of all semblance of respectability,
And trodden down and gored
By horhs of devils of bad luck, and Worse luck—
(Which made us curse luck !).
Lift, we implore Thee,
With deep humility,
This cloud which, like a pall,
Covers us all,
O Lord 1
On every hand,
O Lord, what piles of debts each man owes!
The Bailiff is a burden in the land,
The daughters of music are brought low
In consequence of so
Exceeding many seizures of pianos.
We who are here
Thy servants are, sincere,
The pillars of Thy Church for many a year—
True, we have also worshipped Mammon,
But he’s gone back on us, and so
(This is no gammon !)
Now that his worthlessness we know,
We turn to Thee, O Lord 1

An excited lady, attended by a heavily-
laden black servant, rushed into Melbourne P.O.
Savings’ Bank the other day (before the bank
cloture) and commanded the first man she met to
bring the manager before her. Ultimately she
and the coloured menial were brought before the
manager. She motioned Sambo to drop his burden
on the floor of the sanctum, and proceeded to ex-
plain that she wished to pay in £3OOO on the spot.
The manager protested that he couldn’t take more
than £lOO at a time, but the fair customer, having
landed her bullion in a place of safety, refused to
take it back into the streets. There the sack of
money was, and there it would have to remain.
The cruelty of ejecting the good woman and
dumping her £3OOO upon the mat was so apparent
that the manager ultimately consented to take
charge of the capital and lock it up until the
matter could be officially arranged. Since then
there have been several large lump sums accepted
at the Savings’ Bank,

There must be in Melbourne city circles '
a general want of that sympathy for old Jimmy

of £5 ; a stranger came forward and paid the
“ fiver ” out of his own pocket, and a number of
Stock Exchange men raised a comfortable little
subscription for the assailant. The demonstration
presumably wasn’t intended to encourage a ruth-
less banging of every bank-buster. It merely
recognised the common feeling that a man who
creates genuine grievances, without being called
to account by the law, is a very irritating circum-
stance. “You assured me that eveiything was
all right, when you must have known, or sus-
pected, quite otherwise. And the Crown sym-

Mrs. William M‘Evoy, of Melbourne, has
just had an unpleasant experience of the English
Divorce Court, writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent, she having been one of the “ inter-
veners,” or, in other words, co-respondents, in the
case of M'Kerrow v. M‘Kerrow. The case against
her was dismissed ; indeed, it may be said that,
beyond the fact that she had made the acquaint-
ance of M’Kerrow without a formal introduction,
there was absolutely no evidence against her. It
seems that M'Kerrow was “doing” Brighton,
getting up a case against a railway co. for
damages for injuries sustained in a railway acci-
dent, and he used to go about in a bath-chair on
the Parade. Mrs. M'Evoy’s children got to know
him somehow, and what more natural than that
mamma should come to know him, ton ? A rather
close intimacy followed, with the result that the
lady was dragged into the proceedings. This
experience should be a caution to Australian
grass-widows to be careful how they get in tow
with men of whom they know nothing. M‘Kerrow
is a noted lady-killer, an uncommonly good-look-
ing young fellow possessing the “open sesame ” to
women’s hearts. Mr. M‘Evoy was aware of these
divorce proceedings, and, confident of the inno-
cence of his wife, he had the case defended. It
must have cost him a nice penny, for the most ex-
pensive counsel was engaged. The case was dis-
missed with costs —which Mrs. M'Kerrow will
never be able to pay.
Outside a Sydney hotel, now undergoing
alterations, is placed the legend : “ This house
will not suspend during reconstruction. Neither
will any trust accounts be opened.”

found camped on top of a high wire fence, dead.
Apparently, she had tried to take a short cut over

and was slowly suffocated by her collar. Woman
was never intended to take short cuts unless she

Another run on the banks in Melbourne
last week—Yarra-banks. The police raided the
houseless and homeless who sleep in all sorts of
holes and nooks along the river within the Domain,
and rounded up 13 men, criminal in having no
work, no homes, and no bread. Some were “ sent
up,” others were turned loose after being warned
not to sleep out again. The ass is a monument of
intellect compared with some laws. Some night
an outcast humourist will break into the house of
a fat J.P., and insist upon sleeping in the best
bed with his boots on, in order to observe the law
and keep it holy.

Jingoes continue to send Keir-Hardie silk

Hardie regrets he cannot return the compliment

Latest bush-pub joke. New-chum, with
bell topper, is making “ the boys” drunk. Enter
bushman with single-barrel gun, which he leaves
ostentatiously in a corner, while he goes out for a
minute, saying as he goes—“ Don’t fool with her,
boys, she’s loaded.” In his absence one of the boys
draws the charge, and “kids” the new-chum to
have a lark with the gun-man. The gun-owner
re-enters and joins the crowd. Presently, after a
tall shooting skite, new-chum rashly bets gun-man
that he can’t hit his belltoppor at ten paces “ with
that antiquated old musket.” Bushman gets riled
and planks his money. New-chum gaily covers it.
“ Stick up ycr nail-keg on the corner post,”
says the gun-man. The tall hat is targeted.
Bang ! Smithereens ! “ Yer see, mister, I sus-
pected some o’ yer English tricks, and so I put
two charges into the gun, one atop of the other.
I rather guess you only drawed one.”

Now this is a starter —
Deep lace on the garter !
An unmarried darter
Regards it with glee,
Yet (notion quite shocking)
Such flounces are mocking
That contrasted stocking
Which men inusn’t see.
Heigho ! for the graces of silk and fine laces,
In wonderful places
Which men musn’t sec.
In voice rich and fruity
Let’s toast the young beauty,
Though keen sense of duly
Compels us to be
Respectably blinking
The thoughts we are thinking,
Each chappie when drinking
Is dying to see
The glories forbidden (and shall they be chidden?)
Of articles hidden
Where men musn’t see.
O, still growing fonder
Of Dorothy, yonder,
’Tis pleasant to wander
Round Sydney with she,
The mention of “ shopping ”
Impels us to “popping,”
Are Dorothy’s dropping
Right over the knee!
How sweetly distressing the system of dressing
That tempts us to guessing
At what we can’t see!
“The Day that is Dead.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ah, Jack ! Time finds us feeble men,
And all too swift our years have flown.
The days are different now to then —
In that time when we rode ten stone.
The minstrel when his mem’ry goes
To old times, tunes a doleful lay—
Comparing modern nags with those
Which Lee once bred down Bathurst way.
The type to-day’s a woeful weed,
Which lacks the stoutness, strength and bone
Of horses they were wont to breed
In those days—when we rode ten stone.
But all of us remorseless Fate
O’ertakes, and. as the years roll on
Our saddles carry extra weight,
And old age mourns the keenness gone.
The young ones, too —’mong men, I mean—
Watch not the sires from whom they’ve sprung,
They nowadays are not so keen
As when we —and the world —were young.
They’ve neither nerve nor seat to suit
The back of Paddy Ryan’s roan —
That wall-eyed, vicious, bucking brute
You rode —when you could ride ten stone.
But, Johnny, ere we “go to grass ’’ —
Ere angel wings are fledged to fly—
With wine we’ll fill a bumper glass,
And drink to those good times gone by.
We’ve had our day—’twill not come back !
But, comrade mine, this much you’ll own,
’Tis something to have had it, Jack—
That time when we could ride ten stone !

SHEARER (whose knowledge of Human Nature is very limited) :
“But, tell me, mister, who washes up?”
A new difficulty has arisen over the
threatened disestablishment of the Kirk of Scot-
land. That church was established by the old
Scottish Parliament—so securely that it is doubt-
ful whether anything except a Scottish Parlia-
ment has power to capsize it. And as no such
Parliament exists, the blessed institution seems to
have a long life before it yet. Also, it was a
special item in the treaty of Union between the
Scottish and English Parliaments that the Kirk
was to go on for ever, and it is alleged that that
treaty can’t be legally modified without the con-
sent of both parties, and as the English Parlia-
ment is now also extinct nobody can find either
party, and modification is therefore impossible.
If there is a cast-iron, hob-nailed, copper-fastened
institution in the empire, it is evidently the Kirk
of Scotland.
It was calculated that during a recent fog
in London, owing to the intense stillness of the
air and the massive bank of vapour weighing it
down, the inhabitants breathed and re-breathed
the same foul air for over 100 hours. Somebody
recently wrote a thrilling story—which, appar-
ently, may yet be verified —concerning the destruc-
tion of that bloated metropolis. According to his
tale, some time in the twentieth century a great
and continuous fog descended on the city and shut
out the fresh air until the millions died of their own
poisoned breath, and asphyxia fell upon the
population. The calamity came suddenly.
One morning the oxygen gave out, and
heaps of apoplectic wretches collapsed in every
street, and omnibus-loads of dead, with dead
horses in the shafts and dead drivers frozen on
the box, stood about the thoroughfares; and train-
loads of corpses mouldered in the railway-stations
with dead engineers in charge; and everybody
turned blue or purple and died as he stood or sat or
walked, and there and then London utterly
withered away and became practically deserted
Then a breeze sprang up and drove away the fog,
and half the nation turned out to dig graves for
six million dead, and when the job was finished
they left the accursed city to its desolation. And
then the Maoriland globe-trotter came and stood
on London Bridge.
Smythe wrote his own notices, and then
stuck on the bills : “The Press, for once, unani
mous.”
Moncure Conway has astounded friends
and foes by lecturing in opposition to the dis-
endowinent of the English Church.
A young lady at Newark (Eng.), who fell
and broke her leg while dancing, has sued her
partner for damages on the ground that his clum-
siness caused the disaster.
A Scotch bagman of 26 has just succeeded
in convincing the Court of Session that he is
legally married to an old deranged female of 78.
The marriage was not registered, but the bag-
gentleman got there by documentary evidence.
The old lady is worth <£6ooo. At the time the
wedding took place the bridegroom was only 20,
so he was evidently a far-seeing Caledonian and
had an eye to the main chance at a very early
ago.

On the Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s stiffness in my muscles, and my feet are
blistered sore ;
This shoulder-strap is cutting, with the bluey’s
weight suspended—
(The load was light at starting, now it seems a ton
or more)
The road is hot and dusty, too, —I wish the day
were ended.
A plague on these mosquitoes, and their hellish
thirst for gore !
There’s trouble in the region that’s encompassed
by my belt;
The belt is pulled its tightest, as a sort of make-
shift succour,
For persecuted stomach, which insists on being
felt,
The ruse is scarce successful as a substitute for
tucker.
I wonder what would happen, say, if pork and
greens it smelt ? ■
This realism blasts another romance of my
youth :
I recollect in boyhood’s days I deemed the
frowsy “ bluey ”
A theme for admiration. Ere I cut a wisdom-
tooth
I reverenced the “billy” and the weird, romantic
“coo-ee.”
I don’t know that I'm better, if I’m wiser, for the
truth.
In olden days all public men, you’d find, had
humped the swag—
Were heroes of tradition—men whose courage
never faltered.
They never sought to hide the fact —it gave them
room to brag;
’Twas something to be proud of. Well, the times
are somewhat altered.
Now th-e man who tramps the country is no hero,
but a vag.
I curse the day I started ! yet I don’t know that
Ido;
It’s bad—but then it might be worse, that fact
there’s no denying.
The romance of the subject is dispell’d, it’s very
true ;
There’s little recommends it, but it’s better far
than dying
By inches in the city. Better than a berth at
Kew.
At least, my soul’s unfettered. I can go upon my
way,
Nor dread the molestation of some coat-of-blue
official;
The bush has no d d bye-laws. If I manage
for to-day
I do not dread to-morrrow, so cares are super-
ficial,
And firewood’s cheap and plenty, and I’ve got no
rent to pay.

A mild sensation is apparent amongst

Writes a London correspondent to The
Bulletin
The "Long arm of coincidence” (Haddon Chambers’
phrase) was remarkably illustrated at London Sivage
Club’s pleasant farewell dinner to Phil. May. Villiers
was then introduced by Charley Lett to L. L. Smith, of
Melbourne. "For years,” said Villiers, "I have
endeavoured to trace a person of your name in Australia,
Mr. Smith, but, unfortunately, I have never been able to
find the man I am in search of; perhapsyou can help me?”
Well,” said L.L., “ that is a big order. Who and what
was the cove ?” “I can only tell my story,” said Villiers,
"and then you may judge. Years ago my uncle gave me
a gold watch and chain, with the injunction that I should
try and find out the son of Mr. E. T. Smith, formerly well
known as a theatrical speculator in London, and hand
them to him. AH I could find out was that the young
man had gone to Australia, but, though I have mad ■
every enquiry, I have never been able to trace him.”
“ Well, well,” was L.L.’s reply', " that is wonderful. Why,
lam the very man you want! lam the only son of E. T.
Smith, and 1 have just come from Australia.” And, sure
enough, there was the long-sought-for Smith, and,
through this accidental meeting, Villiers was enabled to
obey his uncle’s behest, and hand the watch over to its
I r iper owner. Could any thimr be more extraordinary ?
Yes, replies The Bulletin, lots of things. There
are in Australia hundreds of people who know
that L. L. Smith’s father was E. T. Smith, the
London theatrical speculator, for the fact has
more than once been published in The Bulletin.
If Villiers wanted to give Smith his watch, he
could have managed it by means of a shilling
advt. in any Australian metropolitan paper.
A South Australian applies in Queensland
for a patent to protect “an improved contrivance
for stamping advertisements on eggs.”
At last Victorian election Hancock, being
asked a tongl', “ readied-up ” question by a hostile
elector, wished to explain, but the other side
roared “No palaver, ‘Yes’or ‘No!’” At last
Hancock got a show, and confounded his adver-
sary with an ancient and ingenious chestnut: “ I
will answer your question ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’” said
he, “if you answer mine: Have you left off
beating your wife yet?” The other fellow then
wanted to explain.
It is alleged that the trained fire-brigade
horse can smell a fire long before it becomes per-
ceptible to the human nose. In support of this
assertion a Wellington (M.L.) paper states that
recently, when the local engine was just coming in
from a fire, the horses unaccountably started off,
galloped furiously down the street for 200 yards,
and drew up behind a pedestrian from whose coat-
tails a small cloud of smoke was rising. Enquiry
proved that he had put his pipe in his pocket
without extinguishing it, and but for the sagacity
of two noble quadrupeds he might have been
burnt to the ground.

A PROPHECY.
DON’T BE DISTRESSED. Depression will soon give place to prosperity by thoughtful economy
and good laws. The lands of the colony should be its source of wealth, but this can only be
practicable by a profitable market being provided for the products of the land. The railway rates
should be adapted, somewhat upon the Zone system, to the wants of the inland districts. By carrying
rates to the sea-board, so that the tillers of the soil may have a profitable market provided (America
owes her great prosperity mainly to this), emigration would then flow into the country, population
increase, and a natural boom the result.

John Donaldson, whom the Tory Press has
sought to elevate to the leadership of the present
Queensland Opposition, never had any chance of
ousting ex-auctioneer Dickson from Bulimba.
Dickson ran under the MTlwraithian banner, and
had all the votes of the old-time “ Liberals ” at his
service. Donaldson is not much loss, anyhow.
He was a self-boasted teetotaller, who trafficked in
brewery-company shares, a mongrel cross between
a Warrego squatter and a city “ flotater,” and he
had two or three times announced publicly his
retirement from politics. The voters have retired
him.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“Old” John Roberts, inventor" of the “spot-
stroke” and the unrivalled billiard-champion of his day,
died a few weeks ago. lie drank like a fish all his life,
but nearly got into the seventies, nevertheless—another
testimony to the excellence of billiards as a steady
gentle exercise for body and mind. Roberts was getting
on towards middle age before he discovered the awful
uses that the “ spot” could be pub to, therefore he never
attained the mechanical perfection of his young dis-
ciples. His best break in a public match was 360, or
thereabouts, but none of his contemporaries being able to
play' the stroke at all, he reigned supreme ; 1000 up was
the regulation match game in those times, and Roberts
was open to give a si art of 300 points to any man t n
earth. People regarded him as a marvel of supremacy in
his particular busimsi, which he certainly was. They
expected him to die a champion, with the secret of the
spot-stroke locked in his fine broad chest. Then the
younger generation came on. Cook, who had been a boy
marker at Roberts’ rooms, was discovered to have mas-
tered the system, and Roberts junior had the reputation
of being “as good as the old man,” although he wouldn’t
challenge his progenitor for the championship. However,
in 1870 William Cook challenged the veteran to play for
£2OO and the title. They arranged to make the game
2000 points up (an unprecedented task), and the Heir
Apparent was brought to witness the historical event.
Cook eventually won by about 150 points, nervousness
holding him back a lot. Then the billiard world awoke to
the fact that John Roberts was a phenomenon of the past.
Young John came forward to share honours with Cook.
Gradually he knocked out Cook, and every body else, at the
“ spot stroke.” As the big breaks grew more and more
monotonous, he turned his attention to cannons, and led
the way to the “ spot barred ’" game, at which he gives a
start of 9000 in 24,0u0 to players who could have
smother.d the ‘‘old man” in bis prime. But the old
man was the first great artist in English billiards. The
game, as we now know it, was born and bred in his rooms.
T.iere was no poetry in billiards until John Roberts
originated the ideas that his successois, with more in-
dustry and greater technical skill, were to develope. |
* # •
John Roberts, who began very easily, beat Mit-
chell in their recent “spot-barred” match, 24,000 up, the
latter getting a start of 9000. Up to the fourth day,
Roberts seemed off-colour, but on Friday he woke up and
continuing to play marvellously on Saturday won by
1139 points. He threatens yet to show the public a break
of a tnousand. Perhaps it will come in his match with
the rising Dawson.

The interprovineial eight-oar race is fixed for
next Saturday, to be rowed this year over the champion
course, Parramatta River. If form shown in practice
rows goes for anything, the crews should about finish—
Victoria, N.S. Wales, Queensland.

Bullies are not always curs, as many people
believe. Joe Goddard, one of the greatest bull-dogs in the
ring, is as big a bully out of it. Before his fight with
Smith, Goddard had a “barney” with Alexander, Daw- i
son’s trainer, when the big fellow struck the little ’un
hard. Alexander proved, however, that a little ’un,
armed with a whisky-bottle, is a better man than a big ’un
without one, as he duly smashed Mr. Goddard on the side
of the head, severing an artery, which gentle passage-of-
arms, by the way, could scarcely have helped Goddard’s
chances with Smith.

Thus is a Bulletin prophecy literally fulfilled.
Cable:—“The horses supplied to the Australian military
team in England, though fine animals, are not used to the
Australian method of work, and this fact renders the team
timid as to their chances of success in the competition.”

It transpires that a bookmaker lately furnished
a Melbourne football team with suits of clothes.

A Melbourne football club lately resolved that
the appointment of a paid secretary at a yearly salary of
£75 was imperative. The captain of a rival club was next
given the post, which involves about five months’ work
annually, but the club refused its ex-skipper a clearance.
It will lie interesting to learn whether full salary will be
paid this gentleman in the event of his not playing.

The “system” would have again panned out
on the first day of Adelaide May meeting. 73 horses
started ; £1 on each would have brought in £lO Bs. profit.
The same with the bookies would have meant about £2O
to the bad !

Mr. L. Foley, for whom most people have a
genuine respect, for several reasons—one of which is
because they’ve got to —called round at The Bulletin
office, the other day, to assure us that he was in no sense
whatever “a rascally Papist,” but an obedient son of
the Church. We’d take Larry’s word for much steeper
statements than that. At the same time, we think that
Mr. L. Foley has slightly misapprehended the acicular
projectility of Tub Bulletin’s observations, which were
intended lo convey the probable sentiments of Sandy
Ross, the loyal Orangeman, when in mournful contempla-
tion of the moighty batings he resaved (and probably
deserved) at the doughty hands of Mr. Lawrence Foley.

About 100 enthusiasts in Victoria persevere

The first “lift” in the world of sport achieved
by Humphrey Oxenham, (he Australian leviathan book-
maker now on his way to impress Europe, was when he
carried on his head, without using his hands, an enormous
pumpkin, from the Royal Hotel at Bathurst to the Mel-
bourne Hotel at Kelso, a distance of two miles, for £lo—
he won.
Isinglass, the Isonomy colt who won the Two
Thousand Guineas last week, is unbeaten thus far. When
will Australian punters be able to back dandy two-year-
olds for the next season’s events with any degree of con-
fidence? They took 9to 4 about Isinglass for the Epsom
Derby before he started in the Two Thousand race !

One of the gentlemen prosecuted in connection
with the Sydney alleged long-firm frauds was, six years
ago, worth £40,000 made at bookmaking. East year he
was twice in trouble in Melbourne for forgetting what
wagers he had made. Two more of the unhappy gentle-
men detained on the same charges started their Australian
careers as missionaries— i.e., canvassers for Douay Bibles.
Another was favourably known in Melbourne in connec-
tion with the mysterious disappearance of weight from a
heavily-backed winner, whom he had peppered.

Young Claude Rome, son of Tom Rome, of
Northampton Downs (Q.), is a Harrow boy, and captains
both the school eleven and the football team. He has
thrice played against Eton, at Lord’s, and came out with
a higli average each time both with bat and ball. The
other day he won tire prize for middle-weights at the
public schools boxing-competition, at Aldershot—a great
feather in ins cap ; lie has three times taken the school
prize for bowling, and has won the cup for fielding twdce,
so that he is a real good “all rounder.” He stands
6ft. lin., and is intended for the cavalry, for w'hich he is
well-fitted, as he is one of the pluckiest and straightest
goers with the Colswold hounds. With all this lie sticks
to study, and was third in the recent exam, m the sixth

Millionaire Abington Baird, manly, generous,
rowdy, prince of amateur horsemen, sighed over the
inscription on Hastings’ grave : “ Judge not, that ye be

million.

Through mismanagement, the record which was
undoubtedly put up at the recent Sydney jumping con-
tests will, in all probability, not be accepted abroad. It
is the recognised thing, when jumping for records, to nk
in the ground at the take-off a piece of board on its edge.
This was not done, and it will be hard on M'Manus should
he be robbed of his record by the bungling of the
authorities.

Mitchell Doesn't Believe in the Sack.
(FOR THE BULLET IN .)
“If ever Ido get a job again,” says Mitchell,
“ I’ll stick to it while there’s a hand’s turn of
work to do, and put a few pounds together. I
won’t be the fool 1 always was. If I’d had sense
a couple of years ago, I wouldn’t be tramping
thro’ this damn sand and mulga now. I’ll get a
job on a station, or at some toff’s house, knockin’
about the stables and garden, and I’ll make up
my mind to settle down to graft for four or five
years.
“ But s’posing you git the sack ?” said his mate.
“I won’t take it. Only for takin’ the sack I
wouldn’t be hard up to-day. The boss might come
round an’ say ;
‘I won’t want you after this week, Mitchell.
I haven’t got any more work for you to do. Come
up and see me at the office presently.’
So I’ll go. up and get my money; but I’ll be
potterin’ round as usual on Monday, and come up
to the kitchen for my breakfast. Some time ’n
the day the boss’ll be knockin’ round, and see me.
‘ Why, Mitchell,’ he’ll say, ‘ I thought you was
gone. ’
‘I didn’t say I was goin’,’ I’ll say. ‘Who told
you that, or made you think so?’
‘I thought I told you on Saturday that I
wouldn’t want you any more,’ he’ll say, a bit
short. ‘ I haven’t got enough work to keep a man
going ; I told you that ; I thought you under-
stood. Didn't I (jive you the sack on Saturday ? ’
‘ It’s no use;’ I’ll say, ‘ that sort of thing’s
played out. I’ve been had too often that way ;
I’ve been sacked once too often. Taking the
sack’s been the cause of all my trouble; I don’t
believe in it; if I’d never taken the sack I’d have
been a rich man to-day ; it might be all very well
for horses, but it don’t suit me; it don’t hurt you,
but it hurts me. I made up my mind that when
I got a place to suit me, I’d stick in it. I’m
comfortable here and satisfied, and you’ve had no
cause to find fault with me. It's no use you
trying to sack me, because I won’t take it. I’ve
been there before, and you might as well try to
catch an old bird with chaff.’
‘ Well, I won’t pay you, and you’d better be
off,’ he’ll say-tryin’ not to grin.
‘Never mind the money,’ I’ll say, ‘ the bit of
tucker won’t cost you anything, a,nd I’ll find
something to do i-ound the house till you have
some more work. I won’t ask you for anything,
and, surely to God ! I’ll find enough to do to pay
for my grub 1’
So I’ll potter round and take things easy and
call up at the kitchen as usual at meal times, and
by-and-bye the boss’ll think to himself ‘ Well, if
I’ve got to feed this chap I might as well get some
work out of him.’
So he’ll find me something regular to do—a
bit of fencing, or carpentering, or painting, or
something, and then I’ll begin to call up for my
‘stuff ’ again, as usual.”

A Verdict and a Story.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Old Bentinck, the schoolmaster, was found
by his assistant dead in his front garden one
morning in the little settlement of Jarrahfell,
W.A. An official, who was two officials rolled
into one—a resident magistrate and a Govern-
ment medical officer —with the name-tag
M.R.0.5., presided at the inquest. He did not
perform a post-mortem dissection, but awaited
developments. An intelligent policeman pro-
duced a bottle, half-full of a yellowish fluid, and
which he had found near the corpse.
It Was whisky’d water, and not even watered
whisky (said the jury).
The coroner summed up : “ Gentlemen, I find
that this unhappy man suffered from a weak
heart, and resorted to stimulants. Unwisely he
watered his whisky so excessively that his weak
heart-action was not sufficiently encouraged, and
it stopped. Syncope, gentlemen, is the term we
medical men give to the immediate cause of
death.”
The jury returned its verdict, laboriously
scrawled out by the foreman —“ We find that old
Bentinck died of sin-cupping by over-watering his
whisky.”
And so it went into the official records.
* 9 •
Old Bentinck, as young Bentinck, had been
a merchant-skipper. He was convicted of
scuttling a vessel and sentenced to 14 years’ penal
servitude in West Australia.
From that time his well-connected wife dis-
owned him. “He is dead,” was her cold remark
to all family enquiries.
Only “Baby Nellie,’ three years old when he
last saw her, lived in the convict’s officialised
affections.
Bentinck served his term, and went out to bush
work. He was hermit-like in his habits and held
intercourse with few. “ A mean old wretch who
never takes a drink or does a shout ” —was the
verdict of his co-workers.
Years after his release found him working at
the Jarrahfell Sawmill, where many hands were
employed—bond and free, ticket-of-leaves, run-
away sailors, ruined gentlemen, fugitives from
justice, &c.; some with wives, others with substi-
tutes. Children were plentiful. A State school
was started, and, by a fluke—and for the want of
another man on the spot—Bentinck became school-
master.
Now the years rolled on less gallingly. Ben-
tinck dressed more decently, bought land, built a
house, and furnished it. His school increased,
and he was granted an assistant.
At last he made a move that was to gild his life-
time with a serene sunset. He wrote to a firm of
solicitors who had done his business in the
vanished times, and enclosed them a bank-draft
and a letter for “ Baby Nellie,” now a woman.
Then he waited expectantly.
* * *
The English mail bad reached Jarrah-
fell. Old Bentinck went to meet the post-boy
coming along his garden-path. The boy handed
him a bulky envelope and trotted off.
Next morning, the assistant found the old man
dead.
An open letter lay beside him, and a bank-draft.
The letter was brief: —“We regret to inform you
that Miss Helen Bentinck died last year, at Goff-
ham, Woldshire, of phthisis. We enclose you a
bank-draft for the amount you forwarded, less the
usual fees for enquiry, commission, &c.”
• •••••
Now, of what did old Bentinck die?
WOMMERAH.
President Cleveland .and ex-President
Harrison stood side by side at the former’s in-
auguration—a grand demonstration of the Ameri-
can spirit.
The reporters who “do the rounds” at
the public offices are known as the “ news ants.”
This somehow has become contracted to “nuis-
ance,” with a d d before it.
Rev. Buchanan, Brisbane’s fancy preacher

on the new Jerusalem-Jaffa railway it takes six
hours to go 50 miles. Also, any passenger whose
bat blows off may order the train to stop.
Alittlebit of “graft” at a village settlement

before Jack Bryan.
Note how the public service juniors are
squeezed in Premier Patterson’s scale of percent-
age sal ary -reductions. If the scale rose propor-
tionately, the maximum would be 50 per cent,
instead of 20. Why should it not be ?
Kater, M.L.C. (N.S. W.) : “ I look on the
butcher-bird as one of the most beautiful songsters
of Australia.” Dangar, M.L.C.: “As for the
butcher-bird’s musical qualities, I think its note
the most harsh and abominable I have ever
listened to.” The Bulletin agrees with Kater.

THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS.
Mr. J. 13. Warbrick, or “Joe Warbrick,” as he
is familiarly known, was captain of the New
Zealand Native Football Team (better known as
“The Maoris”), which visited the Old Country
and gave such a Rood account of itself during the
season there of 1888-89. This team firmly believed
that St. Jacobs Oil is one of the secrets of success
in football, and kept itself in prime condition by a
free use of it. The team was so unanimous in its
verdict that the matter is worthy of special men-
tion. Mr. Warbrick, in conversation with one of
the representatives of the Chas. A. Vogeler Co.,
in Sydney, after their return, stated: “ I have
much pleasure in testifying to the efficacy of St.
Jacobs Oil. I have used it constantly since my
first visit to New South Wales in 1884, having
then injured my knee in our first match ; and dur-
ing our tour in Great Britain we have used bow l '
ing else, and the New Zealand Native Football
Team all speak in the highest terms of its
qualities. In fact, so much did we think of it
tnat we hardly ever travelled without a case
of it.”
AN ENDORSEMENT.
Mr. J. R. Scott, the successful proprietor of the
leading hotel in Gisborne, N.Z.—the Masonic
Hotel—and the able manager of the above-men-
tioned New Zealand football team on their tour
through Great Britain, endorses the above by
letter, in which he states : “ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the wonderful properties of St.
Jacobs Oil. While there (Great Britain) I got for
the team’s use nearly a dozen different embroca-
tions, but none seemed to do the men the same
amount of good as St. Jacobs Oil. In fact, we
never considered our baggage complete without a
case of it.”

The Wild-Cat Column.
The A.J.S. Bank’s re-construction scheme, in
its original form, was a brilliant example of that gall
which passeth all understanding. According to this pro-
ject the Bank was to call up definitely about £1,670,000 of
new capital, and of this amount the shareholders were to
provide about £234,000, while the depositors were to take
up shares to the value of £1,434,000 —in other words, the
depositors were to supply nearly seven-eighths of the
capital needed to keep the staggering institution on its
feet, while the proprietors of the institution paid only the
remaining one-eighth. The shareholders were to pay by
five instalments spread over a whole year, while the de-
positors were to settle up in one lump with no grace what-
ever. The ordinary shareholders were to get all thedividend
they could—which might mean anything from 8 per cent,
to 25—while the new shareholders (i.e., the unhappy de-
positors) who saved them from destruction and who were
bounced into supplying most of the money, were to get
no more than a maximum dividend of 7 per cent. The
latter also were to have the balance of their deposits—the
amounts which remained after they had paid in full for
their shares—locked up for four years, after which the
company would begin to pay them by half-yearly instal-
ments extending over five years more, so that nine years
were to elapse before they were finally liquidated. And
among all this wholesale confiscation the one advantage
offered to the depositors was that their shares had the
first claim for a dividend up to 5 per cent., and as the
bank, considering the terms made with its creditors,
would probably be able to pay eight or ten per cent, from
the very first, this advantage was by no means so glorious
as it looked.
* * 9
The re-construction idea has introduced a new
era in Australian banking. In former days the bank that
got into trouble made a call on its shareholders, but now
it makes a call on its creditors instead. The A.J.S.
scheme has since been so far modified that the present
shareholders are to put up £460,000, or about one-fourth
—instead of one-eighth—the amount supplied by the
depositors, and the latter may, under certain circum-
stances, get the same dividend as the ordinary share-
holder, but even with these modifications the institution
is about 16 times better off because it stopped payment
than it would be if it hadn’t stopped. It gets by force, in
its partially-ruined state, nearly a million and a half of
capital on cheaper terms then a sound bank could get
it in the open market, and it staves off its creditors for a
long term of years without any extra payment for
the accommodation. Truly it is a blessed thing to be a
re-constructed bank. And yet somebody—probably a
shareholder or possibly a disguised director—actually
writes to the Daily Telegraph pointing out that the
depositors should be joyful with an exceeding great joy
because they are not charged anything for goodwill I They
are only shoved by main force into a semi-insolvent com-
pany and haven't to pay a premium for the privilege.
Which is much the same as being thrown overboard in a
storm without being charged any rent for the use of the
ocean.

Dear Bulletin, —From scheme of A.J.S. Bank
reconstruction:—“ 6. That in order to provide for the
event of the requisite number of preference shares not
being voluntarily subscribed for by depositors and share-
holders and the public, a resolution shall be passed, and
the sanction of the court thereto obtained, to bind all
depositors to apply for them pro rata.” Could a resolu-
tion sanctified by the court bind me to take value for my
deposit or current account in pictures or old port? If
not in these, why in preference shares? What are we
coming to? Communism, general division of property,
with the banks and courts leading the way.— Current
Account.
• # •
An expensive legal opinion obtained by a <£6ooo
depositor is to the effect that no order of a Supreme
Court Judge can validate a scheme of reconstruction as
against a contract to repay.
• • •
Thk Bulletin hearsthatthe Victorian Treasurer
proposed that, to allay panic, each of the ten hanks
should put up £lOO,OOO, to form the nucleus of a substan-
tial reserve-fund ; the Treasury to add another million to
the million thus raised. All the banks agreed to this, save
Ihe Union and the Australasia, failing whose assent the
proposal fell through.
9 9 9
The big A.J.S. meeting was, from one point of
view, simply a deplorable affair. The bank had no spokes-
man worthy of the name, and would have been utterly at
the mercy of the other side, had there been another side
with a spokesman. Mr. Walter Friend—well, the direc-
tors might just as well have asked a graven image to
speak for them. Mr. Bill Long—they might as well have
put up poor old Paddy the Ram as an orator.

Suppose the banks’ creditors had treated the
banks as the latter have been accustomed to treat their
smaller debtors I
* * #
The reconstruction of any bank, sound or rotten,
ensures secret liquidation of the old assets by the old
management. Davies went “ home ” with the wild hope
of inducing English shareholders and depositors in the
Mercantile to adopt a reconstruction scheme. Was Davies
“ put up ” to the idea, which, as people now remember,
received vigorous support from certain Melbourne news-
papers? Cables to the Age and Herald represented for a
time that Matthew's “mission” was likely to prove a
gorgeous success.
• • »
Who can guarantee that large and influential
depositors will have their money “ locked up ” for five
years or more, and not draw it out in overdrafts at the
earliest possible opportunity ?
• • •
Chief Justice Acting-Gov. Madden was the
moving spirit in the Victorian bank-holiday muddle.
Both he and Patterson had long been bursting with a
desire to come out strong, and they accordingly did burst
last Sunday week. If two banks hadn’t immediately

that Madden and Patterson might have “saved the
country.” There are innumerable ways of saving the
country just now. The Commercial was said to have
accomplished that feat by its free-and-easy reconstruction,
although at latest dates the Australasia and Union had
saved the country by cashing up in the ordinary prosaic
way.

A few years ago the manager of a now comatose
big Australian bank had just told a bank official of many
years’ standing, who had made a mistake, that he had to
resign. The official pleaded for another show—his long
and faithful service—it was his first and only error—some
friendly consideration might be extended him. "By
God I sir,” said the grim autocrat, '“I am a bank manager
and have no friends. I never had any friends. I am
above the world, personally, sir, and I care a damn for
nobody. You’ll have to go.” And he went. But he
now can’t help smiling over the ashes of the other man's
ruined amour propre.

If there be ten per cent, of truth in the rumours
concerning the overdrafts allowed by one Melbourne
bank the prodigious effort made to “ keep the fine busi-

let such a fine business be given away—by liquidation—

John Grice, chairman of the National, couldn’t
he accused of talking wild nonsense such as was heard at
the Commercial reconstruction meeting. Grice mildly
and sensibly said ; “Should this scheme be adopted, in
the course of a few years the National Bank shares will be
eagerly sought after.”
• • •
The National (Melb.) is seemingly the soundest
bank that ever feared to fight a panic, and its reconstruc-
tion will take a lot of wind out of the sails of the Com-
mercial craft. There was to have been such a rush to buy
Commercial preference shares at “par,” and such a ready
market for its deposit notes—until more banks chipped
into the game. The Commercial crowd were observed
to be looking very sad and weary on May Ist, the
day on which the new bank had intended to start
business (of a kind) in its new premises amidst the
hosannahs of daily journalism.
# ' # *
Almost every one of the banks which have gone
broke of late was offered abundance of assistance from
other institutions—and flatly refused to accept it. They
seemingly didn’t want to be saved. Anyhow, going broke
meant a chance to get more capital, and to stave off their
creditors either for a long term or—by the perpetual-
inscribed-stock device—for ever and ever, and the idea of
borrowing money to escape such a joyful culmination
wasn’t business, but insanity. In fact, they couldn’t have
been induced to accept a big loan in gold by any means
short of partial strangulation of the board Of directors
and a brutal assault on the manager.
* * •
The chairman of the Standard Bank maintains,
like all other chairmen, that his bank is thoroughly sol-
vent, and adds, in a warning tone, that “liquidation
would surely prove disastrous to depositors.” Now, what
is solvency—in a bank ?
* # *
The same gentleman (Mr. Langton) was able to
say, at last week’s meeting, that he personally “had
nothing to fear even should the bank collapse.” Also, he
assured the depositors that, “ instead of having over-
drafts, some of the directors had credit balances, and he
was not there to screen a rotten institution.” So far so
good, but things have come to a queer pass in Melbourne
when the chairman of a bank feels called upon to make
much of the fact that he and some of the directors haven’t
helped themselves. The inference is that Mr. Langton
knew he was addressing a number of men who were aware
of rotten institutions being screened, and he therefore
wished to dispel their very natural suspicions.
• • •
It is stated, on what appears reliable authority,
that one Melbourne firm has a £250,000 overdraft with a
lately-suspended big bank. If this, and other stories of a
like kind, are true, no wonder a member of said firm so
generously “ rallied around ” the bank in its adversity.
# • #
Lawyer Godfrey is of opinion that the Standard
Bank, which has suspended payment for the second time,
should “ cease to exist,” because there are already “too
many of these small institutions” in Victoria. There are
too many large institutions, likewise.

When the bank-scare was at its worst, hardly
any of the passengers per English mail steamers took
drafts with them. Almost every man humped his little

would arrive to find the bank gone smash, and the draft
unnegotiable, and themselves vagrants in a strange land.

The bluff indulged in by counsel for the Mer-

organised social and political assumption of Matthew
Davies’ angelic innocence. Alfred Deakin, incited to fury
by the discovery that one magistrate had not been “ talked
over,” raved about " a day of shame and degradation for
the prosecution.” The people who have watched this
delectable case ail through will be able to judge between
Deakin’s scream and the reply of Walsh, Q.C.—"Oh,

The Colonial Bank of Australasia closing
for “reconstruction” was a surprise outside bank-
ing circles. The Colonial has existed for forty-
seven years, and being backed by the millionaire Clarkes
—who were the biggest shareholders and seemed solid
enough to hold up a failing empire—it ought to have
been safe. But when something like £400,000 had been
withdrawn in the course of a month's run, the Colonial
evidently decided that it was easier to reconstruct than
to call up unpaid capital. There was no excitement over
the stoppage. The bank that creates a furore in these
times is the one that doesn’t stop.

Andrew Rowan, of the Melbourne boom
fraternity, has given his valuable opinion on the crisis
and its causes. Merry Andrew considers that the Mel-

for the sinful slandering of Victorian credit by ignorant
London papers. Why the London papers should question
the soundness of a financial world whose “representa-
tive ” men pay pennies in the £, and whose Premier and
Speaker were identified with the original bank smashes on
which the “slanders” were founded, is a complete
mystery to Andrew'Rowan. But why doesn’t some news-
paper publish the views of B. J. Fink and others on this
matter ?

of the first robbers, who, however, so soon as silver prices
declined, fell over each other in their eagerness to sell
out. The construction of the four tramlines—for which
no security was given to the State—is now postponed till

A few ideas from Canada for Australian politi-
cians to consider when they begin to reform the local
banking laws. In Canada no bank can start business with
less than £lOO,OOO capital, and it has to deposit £50,000
with the Treasury as some measure of security for its
creditors. It is not allowed to pay more than eight per
cent, to its shareholders until it has accumulated a
reserve-fund of not less than one-third its paid-up
capital. Its note issue must not exceed the amount of the
capital actually remaining and available after all losses
are deducted, and a sum equal to five per cent, of the
note-issue must be deposited w ith the Treasury as security
for note-holders. No bank is allowed to lend money on
its own shares or on those of any other bank, or on
land, and it cannot hold any real estate except
for its own use—longer than seven years. Consequently,
the Canadian bank never gets all its alleged capital and
reserves invested in unsaleable land at boom prices.
Monthly returns must be supplied to the Government,
and if the Government feels suspicious about anything it
can call for special returns at any time. No institution
which hasn’t fulfilled all the above conditions is permitted
to call itself a “ bank.” Also, every bank is compelled to
keep at least 40 per cent, of its cash resources in
Government notes. The Government notes in circulation
amount to £4,000,000, against which the Treasury holds
about £BOO,OOO in gold, consequently the State has a
perpetual loan of £3,200,000 without interest. In Aus-
tralia it is the private bankers who get the aforesaid loan.
They also “ get a loan ” of the public.

A typical wild-cat case. A Northern paper was
ruined by a libel action. It had cast reflections on
a certain local mine. The mine was run on
foreign capital, with a magnificent manager at £lOOO a
year. When the foreign money-tide ebbed, the mine
collapsed, and was sold, under distraint—tools, machinery
and all—for £6o—leaving £4OO wages due to the working
hands! Then the princely manager went insolvent, but
he was given a clean discharge and a banquet, for having
been the means of introducing so much capital into
the place I Next, a firm that had been the manager’s
forgiving creditor for £BO went insolvent also. And there
are said to be more to follow. Thus goes the gallant
game of “ we’ll all go smash.”

At one half-yearly meeting of Broken Hill South
shareholders not so very long ago, the chairman, after a

promising dividends in three months. At that time the

and for the rest a vast extent of practically unexplored
territory. Yet .the all-devouring smelters had been
erected, and dividends promised, on the 'reckless assutnp.
tipi that the whole of the co.’s untried ground contained
bodies like those first opened up. Practically no fresh
bodies of carbonate have been found since then, and the
present position is—oxidised ore practically exhausted

Mount Stewart has reached the quiescent
stage. The directors regret that explorations don’t show
the local oxidised ores to be sufficient to keep the furnace

should not exceed £1 a ton, but will greatly depend on
the perfection of the plant and facilities for handling raw
material. There are 5000 tons of sulphides exposed, but
beyond the statement that they contain silver in payable

What about diamonds now? “Our correspon-

same. If I find the new drive as rich as the surrounding
country, I venture to say that, by putting on over 100
men, I shall he able to send a ton of diamonds to London
everj/ three months." Then “ our correspondent ” has
his little say He is a practical miner of over 30 years’
experience; he has no wish to blow or mislead. “The
richest diamond drift in Africa only averages somewhat
less than one carat per load; the result here shows nearly
30 carats per load.” By the same calculation, the value
of the Monle Christo mine is 30 times that of the De
Beers Consolidated, the profit of which is only *2,000,000
a year. “ Our correspondent ” indicates that at the end
of five years the veteran Captain will be one of the
wealthiest men in Australia. There is no doubt of it. A
comparison With De Beers proves that in five years, at
30 carats a load, Rogers should make, by the sale of
diamonds a'one, three hundred millions a year. Bingera
will then look up, and a daily coach will certainly have to
be put on.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was a hot, close, thundery night, and
very dark. However, the calendar said there was a
full moon, so the lamps were not lit. But the cab-
lights fell on the man’s face as he handed a coin
up to the cabby, and Lander recognised him. It
was Jack Wallace. The woman was standing
back on the pavement, muffled up, and he couldn’t
see what she was like.
As the cab drove off they walked along a few
yards and rang at the next door. Lander, from
across the street, looked after them and smiled
behind his cigar. He knew the house. In the
old days he and Wallace had been there pretty
often together. But he was married now, and
that sort of thing was over for him.
He thought of his wife and smiled again. What
would she say if he told her about Jack ? He had
been a good deal amused at her confidential
opinion that Mr. Wallace was too mild and puri-
tanical. Women often had that idea till they
came to know Wallace.
“She would begin by abusing him for a low
beast; and end by wanting to know what sort of
thing the creature was. By Jove! she carries
Jierself well; I wonder who she is ! She’s too tall
for ———— girl;”,
The woman had thrown back the hood of her
cloak to get some air. Then, just as Wallace was
about to ring again, the, door suddenly opened
and the light streamed out on her. As she jerked
the hood forward, Lander caught a glimpse of her
face, and the smile died out of his own.
It was his wife.
When the door had shut behind them, he chewed
the butt of his cigar for a minute, then, turning
round, spat it out and walked slowly off. His
eyes were half shut and he was whistling softly to
himself.
* * #
Fred Lander was a “ rising ” medico. In
fact, he had risen, and was afloat on the top. He
had given up general practice and confined him-
self to the specialty he ha,d chosen—diseases of
the throat. But that was pure business, the thing
he made his money at. His hobby, to which he
devoted all his spare time, was bacteriology.
Bacilli of every kind were his pets. Disease-
germs flourished in his laboratory and waxed fat
in all sorts of unsavoury soups. If you wanted
tuberculosis, or yellow fever, or cholera, or typhoid,
he had it, so to speak, on tap, in innumerable
degrees 6f dilution, from the over-proof brand as
deadly as prussic acid to the mild culture guaran-
teed to put just enough fever in your blood to run
up the pulse one beat a minute. Lander was
admitted to know a good deal about these things
—more, perhaps, than anybody else in Australia.
• * •
When Mrs. Lander got home at two in the
morning, she found her husband busy with a test-
tube half-full of A turbid liquid. He came to take
Off her cloak.
“Another experiment, Fred?” She put out
her cheek to be kissed.
“ Yes,” he said, carelessly, “it’s a thing I want
to finish before Igo to bed. How did you enjoy
yourself to-night? Anybody particular there?”
“Oh! it was pretty slow, I’m dead tired ;
good-night. Be sure and take some supper before
you come up,”
“ All right; I have some consomme ready. You
had better take some, too ; I’ll bring it up.”
A little later, when she had emptied the little
cup, he sat down by the bed and commenced to ask
her about the ball. In the middle of a sentence
she incontinently dropped off to sleep. Which,
considering the extent to which the beverage had
been drugged, was not surprising.
Lander was not surprised. He went down-
stairs, and returned with the test-tube. Opening
a cabinet, he took out a neat little needle-pointed
instrument, and calmly injected a few drops of
the liquid into her arm. Then, after putting the
things back into their places, he went to bed him-
self. His experiment was over for the night.
# * *
Three days afterwards pretty Mrs. Lander
sickened with a mysterious fever. The illness
lasted exactly a week, and then she died. Her
husband, who, in conjunction with a colleague,
had attended her unremittingly throughout, was
heartbroken. He handed over his practice to a
friend for a few months and went off to Europe.
In the fortnight that elapsed before the steamer
started, he secluded himself with his grief. His
friend, Wallace, was the only person he would
admit to anything more than the briefest inter-
view. Wallace wa§ the confidarit of his ndost ul-
timate sorrows. They talked chiefly about his
wife. The evening before Lander sailed, they
sat together till very late, and he insisted on Wal-
lace staying the night. He gave him a shakedown
in the room next his own.
• » »
Dr. Lander got back from Europe in the
winter, and settled down quietly to his practice
and his experiments. He seemed to have re-
covered his old cheerfulness. It was a week after
his return before he saw Wallace, who had been
away on the mountains.
“ Wallace is a good deal off-colour, lately,” said
a man at the club, of whom Lander had made
enquiries. “He had to go away for a spell.”
Wallace did look changed. There was a haggard
look about his eyes, and he had acquired a new
habit of gnawing the ends of his moustache, rest-
lessly. Lander was much concerned,
“ What the devil have you been doing to your-
self?” he asked, the first time he met his friend.
“ I don’t know what the matter is. Jones says
it’s overwork, that I want rest; but I know I’ve
not been doing anything of that sort to hurt me.”
“What do you feel?’ said Lander. He was
eyeing his friend keenly.
“Oh! generally shaky and depressed. Can’t
sleep at night. Shooting pains in the head. And
then——.” He stopped and laughed nervously.
“All that sort of thing, you know.”
“Come round to dinner to-night,” said the
doctor. “ I must look after you.”
* * *
Lander had a good cook, and he was a
capital talker. During the meal that evening,
Wallace seemed to shake of his depression. He
became interested in his host’s account of some
new discoveries of Pasteur’s. When the coffee
was brought in, Lander went out to get some
microscopic slides.
“ I won’t be a minute,” he said.
“ Wait a bit; I’ll come with you.”
Lander noticed it and smiled. One would
almost have thought that the big man had some
absurd fear of being left in the empty room !
They went together to the laboratory, and,
coining away, the doctor brought with him a stand
containing half-a-dozen test-tubes.
“This is some of my own work,’ he said.
“There are some bacilli there never isolated
before. This stuff ’’—indicating one of the little
vessels—“has enough pestilence bottled up in it
to devastate all Sydney, if you could only distri-
bute it judiciously.
“ Did it ever strike you, Wallace, he went on,
as he carefully and deliberately emptied a tiny
glass of cognac into his coffee-cup, what a
revolution modern science is going to bring about
in the higher branches of murder ? A drop of the
liquid in this tube, for instance, injected into
your arm, would kill you just as surely as a dose
of arsenic; but it wouldn’t commence to operate
for a fortnight. That is to say, you wouldn t
know there was anything wrong with you till
then. It would be fermenting in your veins all
the time, of course, and you could fix the date of
your funeral almost to a day. Think of that in
the hands of a man who had an enemy to make
away with—or, say, a wife ! If he administered
it the day before she started on a European tour,
he could foretell the port the news of her death
would be cabled from. And no one would be
likely to convict a husband in Sydney with a fever
his wife caught in Colombo, eh 1”
# * *
Lander stopped to strike a match 4 with
which he touched the floating cognac in the cup;
The spirit flamed up, and he watched it intently.
“ The bacillus in that second tube,” he said, “is
what killed poor Elsie. It runs its course in ten
days. She must have contracted it the night of
Mrs. Taylor’s ball. Poor girl, it was her last
festivity, and I fancy she enjoyed herself. By-
the-way, you were there, weren’t you?” He
looked up enquiringly.
“ I —l—yes, I think I was.”
There was an awkward pause. Lander ab-
stractedly watched the flame again till it flickered
and went out. Then rousing himself, as if with
an effort, he continued :
“The next tube is what I am interested in just
now. It is the bacillus of insanity,”
“Insanity?”
“ Yes, one form of it. It develqpes in the blood,
and sets up a morbid condition in the brain. It
acts very slowly, though. It takes six months or
so before the symptoms begin to show themselves.
Then the patient commences to suffer from sleepless-
ness, shooting pains in the head, and gets into a
depressed nervous state all round. He doesn’t
like to be left in a room alone. After that, he
begins to see things, and becomes a pleasant com-
panion for himself generally,’’
Wallace’s cup, which had been arrested half-way
to his lips, went back into the saucer with a
clatter. His face was grey. His breath came
hard, and his wide-open eyes were fixed on
Lander across the table with a frightened stare.
But the doctor was thoughtfully watching the
little whirlpool his spoon made in the coffee as he
stirred. At last he raised his head, and sat back
in his chair.
“ When a man’s wife,” he began quietly, “and
his closest friend ” ——_
Wallace started to his feet, gasping. His hands
on the table, he bent over and glared in the other’s
face. He seemed to struggle for utterance, but for
a time no sound came to his lips. The blood
rushe l to his face, and the veins on his forehead
stood out, gorged and ropy. Lander stopped
sp aking, and looked coolly back at him. At last
the words came, brokenly, in a sort of husky
scream.
“ You infernal wretch ! You cursed ”
He broke off with an inarticulate howl, and
rushing to the end of the table, Seized the carving-
knife. For a moment he stood irresolute, then
dropped into a chair, and, throwing his arms oil
the table, buried his head and sobbed passionately,
convulsively.
“It is a curious thing,” said the doctor, who
had not changed his careless attitude, “that, at
this stage, the patient’s nerve always does give
way when he wants to do something rash. Now,
in a fortnight’s time, Wallace, with that knife at
hand, you would be distinctly dangerous.”
The unhappy wretch at the table shuddered and
groaned. Lander sipped his OOffefe. _ ,
“ If you had a properly-trained, scientific mind,
Wallace, your observations on the progress of the
case might be very valuable. As it is, you ought
to employ your lucid intervals that way. For
weeks at a time you will be comparatively sane,
you know, and time is sure to hang heavy on your
hands. And in your quiet moments,” he added,
slowly, “ I think you will admit that we are just
about quits.”
Wallace lifted a white, quivering face from the
table, and tried to rise; but staggered and fell
senseless to the floor.
* * *
“How is poor Mr. Wallace, doctor, do
you know?” ,
The lady who asked the question was Miss
Gertie Taylor, whom Lander had taken in to
dinner, and to whom the distinguished young
scientist was considered to be paying marked
attention. Nearly two years had elapsed since
his wife’s death. His voice now took on a tone of
deep sympathy as he replied ;
“lam afraid he will never get better. I drive
round to the asylum occasionally to try to cheet
him up a little, but his delusions are Very fitmly
rooted. He seems to have taken a dislike even t(J
me.”

closes.
Shaw and Williams, two mining engineers
(the former well known in Melbourne), had a
pugilistic meeting on theßandt field a month ago.
It was a great gathering, several missing the Eng-
lish and Australian mail-steamers to be present.
The gloves weighed half an ounce; rules, London'
prize ring; time reduced to 30 secs.; and as one
had called the other a liar, they refused to shake
hands. One of the spectators fainted at the blood
running from Shaw’s ear after the first round. He
used up Shaw’s brand}’, so when Shaw was dazed
he had to recover without any. At the end of the
24th round the odds were against Williams, who
was battered and exhausted. Shaw had regained
his senses, and was grinning through his wounds.
This annoyed Williams, who roused himself to a
final effort. Placing his arms round Shaw’s waist,
he lifted him in the air, threw him with all his
might on the ground, and fell on top of him.
Shaw failed to recover his senses in 30 seconds,
and so lost the fight. Williams was so smashed
that he couldn’t be removed from the field for
three days.

Mrs. Liardet: A South Sea Trading
Episode.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Captain Dave Liardet, of the trading
schooner Motutakea, of Sydney, was sitting
propped up in his bunk smoking his last pipe.
His very last. He knew that; for the Belgian
doctor-naturalist, his passenger, had just said so ;
and, besides, one look at the gaping hole in his
right side, that he had got two days before at La
Yandola in the Admiralties from the broad-bladed
obsidian native knife, had told him he had made
his last voyage. The knife-blade lay on the cabin-
table before him, and his eye rested on it for a
moment with a transient gleam of satisfaction as
he remembered how well Tommy, the Tonga boy,
who pulled the bow oar, had sent a Snider-bullet
through the body of the yellow-skinned buck from
whom the knife-thrust had come. From the bladeof
obsidian on the table his eye turned to the portrait
of a woman in porcelain that hung just over the
clock. It was a face fair enough to look at, and
Liardet, with a muttered curse of physical agony,
leant his body forward to get a closer view of it,
and said, “Poor little woman; it’ll be darned rough
on her.” Then Russell, the mate, came down,
* # »
“Joe,” said Liardet, in his practical way,
which even the words of the doctor and the face
of the clock before him could not change, “ cock
your ears and listen, for I haven’t got much time,
and you have the ship to look to. I want you to
tell "the owners that this affair at La Yandola
wasn’t my fault. We was doing fair and
square trading, when a buck drives his knife into
me for no apparent reason, beyond the simple
damned fun of the thing. Well, he’s done for
me, and Tommy Tonga for him, and that’s all
you’ve got to say about that. Next thipg is to
ask ’em to sling Tommy a fiver over and above his
wages—for saving of the boat and trade, mind,
Joe. Don’t say for potting the nigger, Joe ; boat
and trade, boat and trade, that’s the tack to go on
with owners, Joe. Well, let’s see now. . . My
old woman. See she gets fair play, wages up to
date of death, eh, Joe? By God, old man, she
won’t get much of a cheque—only four months
out now from Sydney. Look here, Joe, the Bel-
gian’s all right. He won’t go telling tales. So
don’t you log me dead for another month, and
make as bad a passage as you can. There’s only us
three white men aboard, and the native boys will
‘ake their Bible oath I didn’t die until the ship
was off Lord Howe Island if you give ’em a
box of tobacco. You see, Joe? That’s the
dodge. More days, more dollars, and the
longer you keep the ship at sea the more
money comes to all hands. And I know I can
trust you, Joe, to lend a hand in making the old
woman’s cheque a little bigger. Right. . . .
We’ve been two years together now, Joe, and this
is the only thing I’ve ever asked you to do or done
myself that wasn’t square and aboveboard. But
look here ” —here, for some half-minute, Captain
Dave Liardet launched into profanity—“ I tell
you that the owners of this ship wouldn’t care
a single curse if you and I and every living
soul aboard had had our livers cut out at La Van-
dola as long as they didn’t lose money over it, and
haven’t to pay our wages to our wives and
children.”
* * *
Liardet gasped and choked, and the little
Belgian naturalist tripped down, and wiped away
the dark stream that began to trickle down the
grizzled beard, and then he and Russell, the mate,
laid him down again.
“ Don’t go,” whispered the Belgian to theother,
“ he sink ver’ fast now.” The closed eyelids
opened a little and looked up through the skylight
brown face of Tommy the Tongan, and
then Russell gave the dying skipper brandy and
w ater - Then, with fast-fading eyes on the picture
m porcelain, he asked Russell what course he was
keeping.
. As near South as can be, said the mate, “but
with this breeze we could soon make the Great
Lamer, and there’s always hope, cap’n. Let
™ e keep her away to the Westward a bit, and who
knows but you may——”
answ er, the grizzled Liardet held out his
hand, shook his head faintly, and muttering, “ I
“°P e come on a Hell of a Calm for a
Month of Sundays,” he turned his face to the
P an< l went over his Great Barrier,
* » #
Everyone was “ so sorry for poor little
Mrs. Liardet.” She was so young to be a widow,
“and having no children, my dear, the poor creature
must have felt the shock the more keenly.” Thus
the local gabble of the acquaintances and friends
of the pretty widow. And she laughed softly to
herself that she couldn’t feel overwhelmed with
grief at her widowhood. “He hadn’t a thought
above making money,’’she said to herself—O, Nell
Liardet, for whom did he desire to make it!—
“and yet never could make it.” And then she
thought of Russell, and smiled again. His hand
had trembled when it held hers. Surely he did
come so often to see her merely to talk of
rough, old Dave Liardet. A man whom she had
on ly tolerated—never loved. And then, Russell
was a big, handsome man; and she liked big,
handsome men. Also, he was captain now.
And, of course, when he had told her of that rich
patch of pearl-shell, that he alone knew of at
Oaille Harbour, in which was a small fortune, and
bad looked so intently into her blue eyes, he had
meant that it was for her. “Yes,” and she
smiled again; “ I’m sure he loves me. But he’s
terribly slow; and although I do believe in the
old saying that blonde young widows look 1 fetoh-
in £ ’ m black, I’m getting sick of it, and wish he’d
marry me to-morrow. ”
* * *
Russell had stood to his compact with the
dead skipper. The owners had given her £l5O,
and Russell, making up a plausible story to his
dead captain’s wife of Liardet having in bygone
days lent him “fifty pounds,” had added that
sum to the other. And he meant, for the sake of
old Dave, never to let his pretty little widow run
short as long as he had a shot in the locker. The
patch of shell at Caille he meant to work, and if
Dave had lived they would have “ gone whacks.”
But as he was dead, he wouldn’t do any mean
thing. She should have half of whatever he
got—“go whacks” just the same. But as for
love, it never entered his honest brain, and had
anyone told him that Nell Liardet was fond of
him, he would have called him a liar and “plugged’
him for insulting a lady,
• * *
“ Going away ! Mr. Russell—Joe ! Surely
you won>t | 0 anc jf leave me without a friend in th '
world? I thought you cared for me more than
that ?”
The big man reddened up to his temples.
“Don’t say that, Mrs. Liardet. If you’ll allow
me, I’ll always be a friend. And, as I thought it
would be hard for you to have to spend the little
that Liardet left you, I have made arrangements
for you to draw a few pounds whenever you need
it from the agents. And as long as ever I have a
pound in the world, Dave Liardet’s wife—”
“Wife!” and the blue eyes flashed angrily.
“He is dead and lam free. Why do you always
talk of him ? I hate the name. I hated him —a
coarse, money-loving—”
“Stop!”
Russell stepped forward. “ Good-bye, Mrs.
Liardet. I hold to what I have said. But the
man that you call coarse and money-loving died in
trying to make it for you. And he was a good,
honest man, and I can’t stay here and hear his
memory abused by the woman he loved better
than life.” And then he turned to go, butstopped,
and with a scarlet face said : “Of course you’re a
lady and wouldn’t do anything not right and
straight, so I know that if you intend to marry
again you’ll send me word ; but if you don’t,
why, of course, I’ll be proud and glad to stand by
you in money matters. I’m sure poor Dave would
have done the same for my wife if I had got that
knife into me instead of him.”
Nell Liardet, sitting with clenched hands and
set teeth, said, in a hoarse voice: “Your wife?
Are you married ? ”
“ Well— er—yes, Oh, yes. I have a—er —native
wife at the Anchorites. Poor old Dave stood
godfather to one of my little girls, God knows
how anxious I am to get back to her.”
“ Good-bye, Mr. Russell ! ”
LOUIS B.
Dear Bulletin, —Every ground-parrot,
who has a few acres of wheat or corn, and wants
one man for one day once in a year, and doesn’t
find a man waiting round to be called in, writes
immediately to a newspaper about the scarcity of
labour in his district, although the hired man
might ask in vain for work during the other 364
days of the year. The general experience of at
least 50 per cent, of bush-workers is 10 weeks’
work per year, and 42 weeks of “ humping bluey.”
You have referred to Whiteley King being able to
supply station labour at 7s. 6d. a week. That’s
nothing. Not 50 miles from where I write, there
are —or there were the other day—men cutting
down pine scrub for ss. per week plus shepherd’s
rations, or equal to about 2s. more. Fifteen
shillings a week has been the top wage in
this district for years, with the exception of
the rates ruling at about two stations that
have never yet gone under £1 per week. For
years past, about Tenterfield (N.S.W.) and on
this side of the Queensland border, numbers of
men have been easily procurable for 12s. 6d., and
even 10s. per week. There are also hundreds who
cannot get work at any price. What wonder
wages are low, when ploughmen advertise their
willingness to take 15s. a week, carpenters £1 a
week, and other men 12s. a week ? At haphazard,
out of six men I see advertising for employment,
only one carpenter and one Chinaman demand <£l
per week. Give the Chow his due : he generally
does stand out for fair wages. In ’B4, a shepherd’s
wage on the Dawson was 12s. 6d. per week.
There is a station on this river where a plough-
man—a strong, young Englishman—is paid only
10s. a week. This is the paradise—the perpetual
picnic—of the working-man, and don’t you forget
it. This is the country to which people are
asked to emigrate.— The Liar Bird, Texas,

When the “Army” Prays for Watty: A
Western Picture.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the kindly hours of darkness, save for light
of moon and star,
Hide the picture on the signboard over Doughty’s
Horse Bazaar;
When the last rose-tint is fading on the distant
mulga scrub,
Then the Army prays for Watty at the entrance
of his pub.
Now, I often sit at Watty’s when the night is very
near,
With a head that’s full of “jingles” (and the
fumes of bottled beer),
For I always have a fancy that if I am over
there
When the Army prays for Watty ITn included in
the prayer.
Watty lounges in his arm-chair in its old accus.-
tomed place
With a fatherly expression on his round and
passive face;
And his arms are clasped before him in a calm,,
contented way,
And he nods his head and dozes when he hoars the
Army pray.
And I wonder does he ponder on the distant years
and dim,
Or his chances over yonder when the Army prays
for him ?
Has he not a fear connected with the warm place
down below,
Where, according to good Christians, all the pub-
licans should go ?
But his features give no token of a feeling in his
breast,
Save of peace that is unbroken and a conscience
well at rest;
And we guzzle as we guzzled long before the
Army came,
And the “bummers ” wait for “’shouters,” and—
they get there just the same.
It would take a lot of praying—loti-s of thumping
on the drum—
To prepare our sinful, straying, erring souls for
"Kingdom Come,
But I love my fellow-sinners, and I hope, upon the
whole,
That the Army gets a hearing when it prays for
Watty’s soul.

Don’t fish for sharks in a rain-barrel
but print your advertisement where it will be seen. “ In
my travels in Australia I found The Bulletin every-
where, and everywhere found it powerful,” wrote David
Christie Murray in the London Contemporary Review.
That is true. The universality of The Bulletin’s circula-
tion in Australasia is the envy of all other papers. In and
beyond Australia, The Bulletin, now in',its fourteenth
year of issue, is the most popular, best-known, best-
quoted, and most widely and numerously circulated of all
Australasian publications.
The Eucalypte Lozenges for colds, made by
Colemane and Sons, are unsurpassed.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25 c.
Skins on Fire
with Itching and Burning Eczemas, and other itching,
scaly, and blotchy skin and scalp diseases, are relieved
by a single application, and speedily, permanently, and
economically cured by Cuticura Remedies, the greatest Skin Cures, Blood Purifiers, and
Humor Remedies of modern times. Price: Cuticura, the great Skin Cure, 50 cents; Cuticura

Mr. JAS. E. NICHOLSON,
A well-to-do Farmer of Florenceville, If. B, t
Canada, suffers for seven long
years with
CANCER OF THE LIP-
Agonizing torture relieved, Disease Cured.
“lam 56 years of age, and until 1884 had al-
ways enjoyed good health. About that t me, a
little hard bunch, like a wart, appeared on my
lower lip. Finally, the bunch gathered, broke,
and formed a sore ; then it began to eat into the
flesh. The Cancer—for that is what the doctors
finally called it—kept getting worse and worse,
year after year. It caused me great pain and
uneasiness. During the last year, I would wake
twenty times in a night, suffering intens3ly
from twitching pains. It was as if my flesh
was being torn from me by pinchers, bit by bit.
m
m
At last, I began to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
In the course of a week or two I noticed a
decided improvement. The twitching and the
pains were very much less, and the sore began
to look healthier. In three months my lip
began to heal, and, after using the Sarsaparilla
for six months, the last trace of the Cancer dis-
appeared, and left very little scar.”—J. E. Nich-
olson, Florenceville, N. 8., Canada.

A Meeting after Years.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In front, a long line of white breakers extending
northward and southward as far as the sight
could reach, but there was no land to be seen
beyond. The two men in the clumsy boat gazed
wistfully in vain. Nothing but that line of living
white and the dark waves around them, speeding
onward to be hurled back by some resistless sub-
marine power. The force of the Pacific, un-
checked for thousands of miles, shattered into
mere foam on the submerged outer edge of the
Great Barrier Reef.
Even to the two men, worn down very low by
the pangs of hunger and thirst, the sight was
grandly appalling, more so than if a visible barrier
of frowning cliffs had been in sight. To them, it
apparently meant death all the same.
The boat was large for but two men to manage.
Perhaps the crew had once been more numerous.
Only a small sail was set, but there was a stiff
breeze and she went swiftly on to the coming
destruction. As they neared the breakers, the
man in the bows pointed out to the one who was
steering a dark break due ahead. The steersman
nodded wearily as if, after all, it mattered little,
but kept the boat for the point indicated.
But a short time for suspense, then the water
rose boiling, carrying them up, and on either hand
the wild rage of smothering foam roared and
thundered. Down ! with a swift, sickening glide,
and the boat was in easy water, and the impotent
breakers behind her.
The sea was now calmer and strangely parti-
coloured. Here a bright blue—unlike the dark
shade of the fathomless, outside depths—there a
brilliant, transparent green, and above all, even
from the low altitude of their boat, they could now
see land. They had entered one of the small boat-
channels that intersect the reef, and the Aus-
tralian coast, and, perhaps, life, were ahead.
The sun was low when they neared one of the
low, sandy islets of the inner Barrier, and ran
their boat ashore. They scrambled out as well as
their cramped limbs would allow, and gazed
searchingly around. The tiny patch of sand was
as barren as their leaky boat. In the middle was
a circle of low, scrubby bushes, and towards this
they went. The bushes surrounded a shallow,
marshy pool, tepid and brackish, but sweeter than
the purest mountain rill to these unfortunates.
They drank and drank, and washed the salt'
rheum from their eyes, and with relaxed tongues
began to talk.
The two men differed greatly in appearance,
despite a certain similarity induced by their for-
lorn condition. One was a man with a coarse and
brutish face, a common churl; the other far more
refined and intelligent.
The coarse man spoke first.
“ We are saved,” he said in French ; “ let us
make fast the boat and sleep; then, when we
awake strong, we will pull to the mainland.”
“We might miss a steamer if we sleep. We are
on their track here.”
“ A steamer ! ” growled his companion. “We
are better over there. A steamer is a trap.”
“ Nonsense. We have our story by heart; even
on the mainland we should die before we reached
a settlement.”
The other grumblingly assented, and they
returned to the boat, vainly looking for anything
edible on the sand.
They had pushed her afloat and were about to
climb in, when the coarser man pointed to the
north. There was the smoke of a steamer.
The sun was sinking—it would be dark long
before she passed, and they had ample time to
row out to her probable track and await her
coming. The two men spoke little during that
weary vigil, for one felt uneasy and held to his
opinion that the mainland was safer. In due
time she came on, aglow with light and throbbing
with life. The men had judged their position as
well as possible, but, owing to some change in the
steamer’s course, she was passing them at some
distance, and, worse still, a slight land-breeze had
sprung up and they were to leeward. In despair
the one who was anxious to hail her dropped his
oar, and, standing up, raised his voice in a wild
cry for succour.
The steamer passed on abreast unheeding, only,
is if in very mockery, the sharp clang-clang,
clang-clang of her bell striking the hour was borne
distinctly to their strained ears.
“ I am glad,” said the rougher one ; “ now we
can pull quietly. Enough of that! ” he cried
suddenly, as his comrade was about to raise his
voice again. He caught him to put his hand over
his mouth.
The two struggled fiercely, and the stronger
and stouter of the two would have had the advan-
tage but for a luckless slip in the water at
the bottom of the boat. As he rose to his
feet his companion, who had drawn his knife,
stabbed him in the side. With one harsh scream
of pain and rage the wretched man went over-
board.
The panting survivor put his hand to his fore-
head, “ Tis better so,” he said, “bis hang-dog
face would have only betrayed me. By myself I
ghall manage.”
On board the steamer, the passengers, fresh
from a good dinner, were lounging on deck. The
captain, free from responsibility, for the coast
pilot was in charge, was chatting with one of his
lady-passengers when, to both of them, it seemed
that vaguely, indistinctly a cry came over the
calm water. The captain mounted the bridge and
the tinkle of the telegraph was followed by
the startling stillness that falls on a steamer on
the sudden cessation of the engines. In the hush
of that stillness came, out of the darkness, a dis-
cordant wail of agony. The death cry of the
escapee.
The bearing of the sound was hastily taken, a
boat lowered, and the light of its approaching
lantern soon told the survivor of his speedy rescue.
With feeble cries he guided them and was soon on
board, and the useless, leaky boat abandoned.
Helped up the side, he was handed over to the
doctor.
“ He is a ship-wrecked sailor, and, I think, a
countryman of yours,” said the captain, a little
while afterwards, to a French lady on board, the
same who had been conversing with him when
they had heard the first cry for help. “ Would
you like to step forward and speak to him ?”
The man was sitting on the forward hatch,
stronger now after a meal. The lady advanced,
guided by the captain, and a quartermaster held
aloft a riding-light.
“ Are you better, my poor man ?” she said, in
French, in a soft tone.
As if galvanised from death to life by the voice,
the haggard form sprang at one bound to his
feet. For a second the burning eyes fastened
themselves on her face, and then—before n
hand could be raised - before the cry of
horror and recognition had escaped her lips
—the knife on which his comrade’s blood was
scarce yet dry was buried to the hilt in her
breast.
Ur lifted his lean hands to the stars—
“Traitorous harlot, I have paid my debt!” he
hissed. )
Then he held them forth as though to welcome
the handcuffs. “For ten long years I have worn
them through her perjury,” he said, and as their
hands seized him he dropped in a nerveless hean
upon the tarpaulin-covered hatch.

"THE BULLETIN.
(Published at SYONEY, N.S.W.)
THE Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,"
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Jl the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System. x
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap
. Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System —one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
oally-condensed columns all matter which is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
itarted eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
»ad has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
»nd the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued .The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new typo of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of nationa
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
orusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same oftiee. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
