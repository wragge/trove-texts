BOTTLES?
The current vintage of Barossa Riesling is
bottled in green bottles for those who like
their Rhine Riesling to be youthfully fresh
and crisp.
For those who prefer their Riesling to be ag«d
and rounded, with the developed character-
istics that come from bottle ageing, Barossa
Riesling is in the traditional European amber
bottle. Amber glass keeps out the light and
protects the wine while it is ageing.
Because of the time it is held and the care
taken during ageing, the older vintages are
more expensive than the Riesling in green
bottles.
Since its inception in 1953, Orlando has won
more awards than any other Australian
Riesling - including a Gold Medal in 1964
and 1965 at Montpellier, France.

LETTERS
Communist China
Sir,
Mr. Samuel’s views on China (8.,
August 27) make very depressing
reading. The Chinese leaders, we are
told, are “mindless,” “brutal tyrants,”
“romantic perverts who idolise war,”
“fanatical nuts,” etc,, etc. It seems
that the lesson which we are expected
to draw from his assessment is that the
possibility of any sort of accommoda-
tion with China, under its present
leadership, is extremely remote and
that we might as well prepare ourselves
for a long, hard struggle—a second cold
war. This is, I believe, an excessively
pessimistic view which reflects Mr.
Samuel’s extremely emotional analysis
of contemporary China.
Turning to more specific issues I
would like to question the accuracy
of certain statements made by Mr.
Samuel.
1. I would like to know what evi-
dence Mr. Samuel has for his assertion
that both North Korea and North Viet-
nam are “aligned to China,” particu-
larly in the light of recent American
and English scholarly studies of Inter-
national Communist affairs. I would
have thought that both Kim and Ho
have been quite successful in steering
a path between both the Soviet Union
and China and have thus avoided the
unwelcome step of aligning themselves
with either of the Communist giants.
2. What evidence does Mr. Samuel
have for his assertion that the Chinese
Communist Party has “increasingly re-
jected . . . the expansion of consumer
welfare”? Does the fear, by the
Chinese leaders, that increased material
well-being will sap revolutionary ardor
imply, as Mr. Samuel suggests, a lack
of concern for the material welfare of
the population? Or does it simply
reflect their view that growing afflu-
ence, unless accompanied with inten-
sive political education, is likely to
result in the growth of “revisionism”
in China?
3. While I agree with Mr. Samuel
that the Great Leap Forward was a
foolish and disastrous policy, I find it
difficult to accept his reference to “a
process of immiserisation of the masses.”
It is certainly not an accurate reflec-
tion of Chinese economic experience
during the past five years, particularly
in view of the growing availability of

STRENGTH. When you're buying racking, plan for future require-
ments. You’ll need good, strong racking that can carry anything,
whose stability increases with load.
FLEXIBILITY. Good racking has to be adaptable and preferably
self-locking. It is also important that it can be readily re-arranged
by your own staff to accommodate any sized products. There
should be no nuts or bolts to meddle with—they are time wasters.
PRICE. Truly efficient design produces the least expensive rack-
ing. Make sure that the price you pay will buy racking that will
do your job today . . . and tomorrow!
ADVICE. The more your rack supplier knows about your storage
problem the more chance he has of solving it. Acrow have the
best space consultants in the business. Phone them now,

Finally, if Mr. Samuel is revolted by
the presence of violence and coercion
( as lam sure he is), then I am sur-
prised that we have not yet read his
comments dn the horrifying massacre
of hundreds and thousands of Indo-
nesians, both Communist and non-
Communist, a massacre which the New
York Times columnist C. L. Sulzberger-
described as being the worst since Hit-
ler. Similarly, there has been no men-
tion of the ruthless suppression of the
minority Naga and Mizo tribesmen in
Assam by the Indian army. Condem-
nation of China for her suppression of
the national minority in Tibet is clearly
justified, but one should be ready to
condemn the use of unnecessary force
and coercion when exercised by any
government, Communist or non-
Communist.

Sir,
It seems likely that many who read
Myra Roper’s book “China The
Surprising Country” or your recent re-
view (8., August 27) of it will think,
like the reviewer Professor Wittfogel,
that Miss Roper is at present
Principal of University Women’s Col-
lege in Melbourne. Miss Roper resigned
from this position in April, 1960, and
the present Principal is Angela A.

Higham’s Phobia
Sir,
It is amusing to observe your Mr.
Higham’s phobia against Australian
Film Festivals. The last example of
this is contained in his article about the
excellent work of the State Film Centre
of Victoria (8., August 20) in which
he takes the opportunity once again
to censure all the Australian Festivals
for their “appalling snobbery” mani-
fested by their exclusion of the works
of young film-makers.
So far as the Melbourne Film Festi-
val is concerned, the facts (if such
ephemera are of interest to Mr.
Higham) are as follows: The Australian
content of the Festival is selected
through the yearly Australian Film
Award competitions, conducted by the
Australian Film Institute. Award-win-
ning entries in this event are automati-
cally included in the program of the
next Melbourne Film Festival. Thus,
the winners of the 1966 Film Awards
(judged in September) will be screened
in the 1967 Festival. What is more,
in addition to screening the award
winners to its members, the Festival
traditionally opens the doors of the
yOO-seat Palais Theatre during one
night of the Festival and presents a
hree-hour program of these films, free
of charge, to anyone interested. The
Festival is pleased to have an average
of 2000 persons of the general public
present at these screenings each year.
The Festival has presented during the
past three years numerous works of
young film-makers. John Richardson’s

You need more than a driver's licence
to be a Remington technician
No joke. It needs three years training and regular re-
fresher courses. Only then is a Remington technician
allowed even near a customer's machines.
Pretty solid, you might say. But it pays off. The Reming-
ton trainee school turns out the most highly trained team
of office equipment experts in the country.
One particular thing Remington men learn is that a
client hates to be kept waiting in an emergency. That's
why they've built a reputation for being the fastest
qualified experts of this type, on the scene anywhere.
And we mean anywhere ! Remington's service team
has offices in 94 cities and towns throughout Australia.
When you've got more machines throughout the country
than anyone, you need the largest team to service them !
A Remington technician certainly goes through a lot
before he's sent out on the road. But it means that
Remington's clients can forget about service worries. -
What driver's licenc- --Quid do that for you?

find their way into so many shops, offices, restaurants and work rooms.
Here's why!
A Carrier packaged unit is big enough to control temperature and humidity
in places too large for a small air conditioner. Yet it’s compact so you
can tuck it discreetly away in a corner, standing on its own base. One of
the Carrier range of packaged units the 50K8, 50K10, the new 50K14 or
the 50K16 is exactly right for your premises. It will run so quietly

public (and even the "Press) is sadly
oblivious of these young people’s films,

Rado may have made a start, but he
has a long way to go.
Independent State Schools
Sir,
As the article by John McLaren
(B., August 13) seems to have been
sparked off by some remarks of mine,
I should like to make it clear the con-
text in which I said them. As reported,
it would appear that I was advocating
a wholesale changeover to a system of
appointing headmasters in our present
State High Schools by committees of
parents. While I agree with much of
what Mr. McLaren has to say about
such a system, my original suggestion
was made with existing independent
schools in mind- I had outlined a plan
under which our existing independent
schools might become a new type of
State school.
Very briefly the proposal was for an
additional category of State schools to
be created. These schools would be
financed for staff and buildings on the
same basis as existing State schools, but
organisationally they would be more
loosely linked with the centralised
Education Department. This type of
school within State systems is not
uncommon in other countries. If such
a category of State schools was added
to our educational scene, it may be
that many existing independent schools
would be prepared to become State
schools of this type. In becoming such
a “State” school, they would give up
some of their existing features, viz.,
economic exclusiveness, ownership of
existing buildings and property, etc.,
but they would be able to retain edu-
cational and other emphases they hold
dear. These features would probably
include the appointment of headmasters
and other staff, and particular religious,
cultural, and humanist activities. The
latter features would not, of course, be
government financed, but neither are
they in our present State schools,
although they are allowed to exist. In
its turn, the State would, of 'course,
have control of the viability of such
schools, be adequately represented on
their councils, and see that they did
not cripple by academic or other selec-
tivity (as independent schools now do)
the major group of State schools.
Such a scheme is aimed at bringing
within the State system some flexibility
of educational practice and particular
emphases so that parents of all eco-
nomic levels who desire such an edu-
cation for their children may partici-
pate in the widened State system.
Schools which chose to remain out-
side this enlarged State system would
appear to have little right to any form
°f State aid and such questions would
at least be more easily settled. Prob-
ably few of our existing State schools
would be in'a position to, or want to,
appoint their own heads, as their coun-
cils would not have a sufficiently

No record organization in the world chooses its releases
from such an outstanding body of labels. Members are
offered exclusive recordings from Erato of Paris, Lyrebird,
Columbia, Decca, His Master’s Voice, Electrola, Counter-
point and others ... the finest records in the world today!

SUPERB PRESENTATION
Record Society recordings are presented in de luxe folio-
albums embodying extensive analytical, biographical and
historical notes. They are the finest in Australia amongst
the finest in the world. The standard of its releases both
technical and musical —is outstandingly the finest in this
country. The rewards it offers are limitless, as an examina-
tion of its current programme illustrates. And its standing
in the community is extraordinarily high —as the news-
paper quotes at right may perhaps demonstrate.
Membership of the Society has in the past been restricted
to 3,500 members in Australia and overseas, but the
acquisition of computer servicing now enables an extension
of membership to 5,000. It will definitely be restricted to
this figure. If free details, without obligation, are required,

WHAT NEWSPAPER CRITICS
THINK OF THE RECORD
SOCIETY.
“Since its establishment in 1960.
The Record Society has concentrated
with conspicuous success on provid-
ing music for the keenly, as distinct
from the casually, interested lis-
tener.” (John Sinclair—Melbourne
Herald.)
. . the other volumes of this set
(of lieder) would in themselves make
membership of The Record Society
the sine qua non of a serious col-
lector.” (Kenneth Robins —The Aus-
tralian.)
“The Record Society which has
established an Australian reputation
second to none for its reproductions
of the world’s best music wins new
laurels . . .” (Bruce Kneale — Post.)
“The Record Society, whose policy
is to explore fruitfully the byways
of music, has new treasures for us
in the latest of its albums to be
released here.” (Stradivarius Syd-
ney Telegraph.)
“For those to whom music is more
than a pleasant diversion, The Record
Society, of all the record clubs, pro-
vides the most consistently high
standard fare. A large percentage
of its catalogue is unavailable from
any other local source ... It would
be wrong to regard The Record
Society as catering for the esoteric
in music or the precious in listeners,
since its catalogue seems to be based
on one criterion, that of artistic
excellence.” (Kenneth Robins The
A ustralian.)

However, the opportunity to become

Orr
Sir,
It was a pleasure to read the im-
passionate letter of Tim Bowden (8.,
Aug. 13) on Sydney Sparkes Orr. He
stated that he felt this may be an
inopportune moment, just after the
death of Orr, to refer to his alleged
martyrdom, but it seems, in fact, that
there was no other time before the
death of this man when it was safe
to make public expressions against the
man without being a sure target for
a legal action. The records and Orr’s
own statements show that he was “law
happy.” As for his alleged martyrdom,
this was the very thing he seemed to
want. He was preoccupied with martyr-
dom long before the “Orr Case” ever
arose. Perhaps his continued references
to the Roman Catholic martyr Patrick
Hamilton may have been responsible
for, in part, the Church’s support of
this man.

Lullaby Lads and Lasses
Sir,
Your correspondent John Hooker
(8., Sept. 3), in a restrained comment

“slovenly” is an adjective.

Sir,
Apart from the criticism of Mr.
Buckley’s “Lullaby Lads and Lasses”
(8., Aug. 27) I feel that many of his
platitudinous generalisations need to be
examined for veracity.
All dissenters are compactly cate-
gorised as either runny-nosed adoles-
cents, far-Left radicals, ethereal
aesthetes, 8r unthinking undergraduates
hiding behind the “angry-young-man”
facade of the politically fashionable
socialist groups of the campus. Needless
to say, one need not be in any of these
categories to hold an opinion differing
from the conventionally acceptable. The
list of aversions of the dissenters could
epitomise some of the worst aspects of
our modern society and some of their
best supporters, or give us a Who’s
Who. of McCarthyism and the all-
American “Great Society.” Surprisingly
and erroneously George Orwell’s name
is dropped, and if “1984” is not a tirade

tarnished facets of the immaculate gem
called “Western Society” (e.g., “Boys’
Weeklies” and “How The Poor Die”)
are not an expression of dissatisfaction,
then his writings are capable of wide
interpretation.
Then a number of socialist propa-
ganda sheets are instanced as the vade
mecums of dissenting youth. That these
magazines represent the opinions of only
a modest proportion of Australian dis-
senters is overlooked, as is the fact that
the majority of youth, many Leftists
included, regard the Australian Com-
munist Party as on the same plane as
the DLP, only on the opposite end.
The hierarchy of the Australian Com-
munist Party is antbintellectual and
still clinging for support to mid-1930
Stalinist doctrines and our venerable
union bosses. And for Mr. Buckley to
suggest that the DLP and “younger
generation Liberals” (a highly nebulous
category) would concur wdth rationali-
sation and workers’ participation i n

Party’s fire is doing the DLP and our
“younger generation Liberals” a gross
injustice it would seem.

Asquith (N.S.W.)
Rough-shod Salter
Sir,
Mr. Aslanides’ letter (8., August
27) is both timely and apt. David
Salter’s reviews of local music generally
ride rough-shod over most accepted
maxims, and while he has as much
right as the next man to do this,
one wonders why THE BULLETIN in-
flicts this inexperienced young man
upon its readers, many of whom hold
more catholic views than he does. I,
for one, strongly object to any student,
no matter how brilliant or sincere, or
for that matter any critic professing
an obvious contempt for most of the
music in the currently unfashionable
romantic period, being the musical
conscience for a quality magazine like
THE BULLETIN. I am not particu-
larly interested in whether Mr. Salter
likes Franck or not, or for that matter
Delius, Elgar, Brahms, or any of the
other favorite whipping posts of the
avant garde. What I am interested in
is how the x trio played them and Mr.
Salter should be able to convey this,
instead of resorting to a diatribe of
embryonic opinions about compositions
for which he obviously cares little.

86 Years Ago: September 18, 1880
CIR HENRY PARKES certainly
exceeded his duty in interfering
with Mr. Proctor’s Sunday lecture
(on astronomy, which the Premier de-
clared would offend the Licensing
Act) and ought to receive condign
punishment at the general election
for that arrogant and despotic inter-

reverence for Sunday is gone by. That
it will be in every civilised Christian
community a day of rest and recrea-

of it may not be profitably devoted
to a scientific lecture is an assertion
we cannot possibly subscribe to. Since
the Museum, the Public Library, and
the Botanic Gardens have been
thrown open decided improvements
in the manners of the people have
been observed. The despicable Chad-
bandism which pervades our holy
Premier’s snuffling deliverances, and
the greasy adroitness with which he,
the tottering Southern Czar, seeks to
introduce religion into every difficult
question, are contemptible beyond ex-
pression. How he must laugh in his
sleeve as the unsuspecting church-
wardens, elders, and deacons send in
blessings galore and assurances of
their heartfelt thanks to this wolf in
sheep’s clothing, this ass in lion’s skin.

SEPTEMBER 17, 1966
One for the Books
ON the second floor of a small
building in Elizabeth Street,
Melbourne, is a small bookshop
run by Moscow-line Communists,
the International Bookshop. Last
Thursday week there descended on
this small shop a band of burly
warriors from the Vice Squad of
the Victoria Police who seized 86
copies of a pamphlet called
“American Atrocities in Vietnam."
Before the seizure the International
Bookshop had sold 14 copies of the
pamphlet, which was originally re-
printed in Sydney by the Vietnam
Action Committee from the Feb-
ruary edition of the American
magazine “Liberation."
The pamphlet contained a few
photographs and articles about
alleged atrocities committed in
Vietnam. The photographs were
poorly reproduced, and two had
appeared before in Melbourne daily
papers. The pamphlet contained
reports from papers such as “The
New York Times,” “The New
York Herald-Tribune," and
“Newsweek," as well as carefully
edited letters from United States
soldiers, details of interrogation
procedures, and alleged tortures.
However, a policeman bought a
copy from the International Book-
shop for 25 cents and the Vice
Squad took it to Mr. McConville
in the City Court and applied for
a warrant of seizure. Mr. McCon-
ville found the pamphlet obscene
on the grounds that it contained
illustrations of gross cruelty. The
detectives then returned to the
bookshop and seized the 86 copies
left of the original hundred in
stock.
A group of Melbourne Peace
Parsons then decided to sell the
magazine in the streets. They sold
300 copies on the corner of Collins
and Elizabeth Streets in a short
time. Just after the last was sold
the Vice Squad arrived and ques-
tioned the clergymen, including
the Reverend Terry Lane, who
said that the clergymen would be
getting more copies from Sydney.
Meanwhile, the Chief of the Vice
Squad said that the action of the
police was not political but based
on the emphasis of violence and
horror. “They tended to horrify
and sicken."
As we go to press it appears that
no action will be taken against any
bookshops, but the clergymen may
be charged. The clergymen claim
that they have no plans to sell
pamphlets available which describe
the cruelty and torture inflicted on
South Vietnamese civilians by the
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
regulars. By now a thousand or
more copies of the pamphlet have
been distributed in Melbourne,
compared with the bare 14 which
the International Bookshop sold.
It is on sale in the universities.
Readers are invited to draw their
own morals from this true-life
parable. One may be the value
of our present disunited censorship
apparatus. With unified censorship,
the pamphlet would have been
banned everywhere and supplies
could not have been taken to
Victoria from New South Wales.
In this case a worthless pamphlet
was saved, but next time it could
be an important book. Another
moral is that getting banned re-
mains the best way of getting free
publicity. A third is the reminder,
always useful, of the stupidity of
people who imagine that the best
way to handle Communist propa-
ganda is to suppress it.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Twilight of the Commonwealth
In whatever form it now emerges, the British Commonwealth can never be the
same. Day after day last week Britain was in the dock charged with insincerity,
dishonesty, chicanery on Rhodesia. It was urged to use force against the rebel
lan Smith and to back U.N.-imposed mandatory oil sanctions.
Britain was expected to recognise the
viewpoint of every African nation at
the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’
Conference. The Africans—and others
—were not prepared to concede that
Britain had a viewpoint—and difficul-
ties. They wanted action, and they
wanted Britain to do the acting.
For British Prime Minister Mr.
Harold Wilson it was a bitter week.
Whatever its shortcomings in the post-
war period, Britain had at least demon-
strated sincerity of purpose in getting
rid of her world empire. It was left to
the Asians and Australia —to show
appreciation of Britain’s plight. Singa-
pore’s Prime Minister, Lee Kuan-yew,
gifted, sardonic, and realistic, summed
up the situation. Rhodesia, Lee said,
had no real economic or strategic sig-
nificance for Britain. He refused to
believe that Britain would assist the
rebel Smith regime in Rhodesia and
depart from its postwar policy of
liberating its former colonial subjects
with due regard to the rights of the
indigenous inhabitants.
There were other factors operating,
Lee indicated. There was firstly the
question of force. As Lee pointed out,
it was doubtful whether Britain had
the capacity to enforce a military
solution. Another Asian, Tunku Abdul
Rahman, of Malaysia, went even fur-
ther. He doubted whether Wilson could
carry the British Parliament and British
public opinion on the question of the
use of force. Although the Tunku did
not say it, he obviously had the feeling
that many round the table must have
had during the moments that they wen-
prepared to exercise their political
judgments unclouded by racial passion.
The British public, accepting that
Britain had an obligation to rid itself of
its former empire, would not be happy
to fight for something for which in a
short time it would not have any
responsibility. Pointing out that this was
the context within which the conference
had to operate, the Tunku appealed
for “reason.” The task as he saw it
was to get Britain off the hook and
to persuade the Smith regime back
into the paths of constitutional recti-
tude. He threw in the idea that a mis-
sion of Commonwealth representatives
—he left the composition completely
open—should go to Rhodesia so see
both white and African leaders to
see on the spot whether they could
reach a solution.
India also had sympathy for the
British plight. It was not a British
problem but a Commonwealth one,
said the Indian spokesman. It was not
a case of British versus the rest, or of
white versus black, but of whether the
Commonwealth could find a solution.
It refused to question both Wilson’s
and Britain’s sincerity. Almost antici-
pating the point that Australian Prime
Minister Mr. Holt was to make later,
India pointed out that Britain, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand had refused
to recognise the Smith regime, had
condemned it, and had joined in im-
posing sanctions in the hope of bringing
about the overthrow of the Smith
regime. But, having said that, India
added that it would not be satisfied
with the status quo (which is basically
what Britain wants). Existing sanctions
were not working out. There was no
sign of a weakening of the Smith
regime. India wanted more done to
rectify “the immoral position of a
white minority ruling over a black
majority.” It would not even flinch
from the final sanction of force against
Rhodesia. lan Smith should not be
left in the assurance that force would
never be used against him.
But whatever the threats of the
Africans and their supporters, it was
clear that Wilson and Britain would
not could not agree to the use
of force. As the Tunku said, it could
not as a matter of practical politics.
It could not carry the British electorate
with it. On mandatory U.N.-imposed
sanctions, particularly on oil the
commodity which the Africans insisted
Lee Kuan-yew - realistic.
must be cut off from the Smith admin-
istration Wilson was in almost as
hopeless a position.
South Africa and Portugal were the
main suppliers of oil to Rhodesia. South
Africa was a major British customer.
British investments in South Africa
were in the neighborhood of £ 1000 m.
sterling. Further, through the £4oom!
sterling worth of gold which South
Africa marketed through London
and on the purchase of which the
United Kingdom was given the first
option South Africa was an impor-
tant stabilising influence upon sterling.
If South Africa defied the U.N. man-
datory sanctions on oil and continued
to supply Rhodesia with oil, the imposi-
tion by the U.N. of an oil sanction
would be meaningless. Unless the
sanctions were enforced, all that would
have been produced would be a blow
to U.N. prestige and world authority.
If they were to become effective,
somebody would have to physically sup-
ply the means of enforcing them. The
United States, with its hands full all
over the world, would not be anxious
to volunteer for the task. This would
leave it up to Britain. If, because of
Britain’s attempts to enforce the U.N.
sanctions, South Africa turned nasty,
it had the potential to bring Britain
to its financial knees very smartly. It
was a terrific problem with Britain in
the middle.
Britain so far has restricted itself to
saying that it would not grant legal
independence until there were guaran-
tees that Rhodesia was moving toward
a situation in which both native Afri-
cans and Rhodesians of European ex-
traction would have equal represen-
tation. This left Wilson with room for
manoeuvre, as did Lee Kuan-yew’s
suggestion that the issue be decided in
twelve months, when it would be known
how tighter sanctions had affected the
situation. (Lee wanted them enforced
by the RAF and Royal Navy.)
For Britain, the problems have been
steadily mounting. On the one side
are Africans who are not prepared to
walk out of the Commonwealth because
of the loss of benefits they now enjoy,
and on the other side Africans who
would like to walk out, but who want
to keep the benefits they also receive
and to wait until it is done by the
Africans en masse.
Last week’s conference at least
pointed up a fundamental weakness in
the Commonwealth as now constituted.
With eight Africans among the 22
member countries represented at the
current conference, African problems
dominate the discussions, while Asia,
where as Lee pointed out the freedom
of South-East Asia is being decided in.
Vietnam, had no prospect of being
mentioned or discussed until the con-
ference’s time had almost expired. A
Commonwealth of Nations by name, it
is a group which in practice concen-
trates almost wholly upon African
problems.

A Second-Class Scandal
The Bolte Government is in the middle of a solid, second-class scandal and its
attempts to deal with it raise even more serious issues of democratic principle and
constitutional practice.
In July this year the Education De-
partment bought some land at Row-
ville, about 220 miles west of Mel-
bourne, for $89,000, a cost of more
than $4OOO an acre. Subsequent in-
quiries revealed that First Constable
Cunningham, who was the vendor, had
bought the land a short time before
for about $l6OO per acre. A further
inquiry discovered that First Constable
Cunningham had bought the land from
two ladies, who in turn had payed $620
per acre as recently as February.
Soon after these facts became known,
the Leader of the Labor Opposition,
Mr. Stoneham, announced that a
Sir Henry Bolte - another inquity.
Dandenong estate agent had bought 15
acres of land in 1960 for $7OO an acre
and on the same day sold it to Over-
land Development Corporation for
$9OO an acre. In August, 1964, the land
was purchased by the Education De-
partment for $3OOO per acre.
THE BULLETIN can add some
further examples. The interim report
into Reid Murray Holdings reveals
that in May, 1960, Reid Murray De-
velopment bought 73 acres at Maribyr-
nong for $4120 an acre. In July, 1961,
in the middle of a credit squeeze, the
Education Department acquired 15 and
a half acres of this land for about
$7200 an acre. In November, 1961, the
remainder of Reid Murray’s 73 acres
was sold to Heights of Avondale Pty.
Ltd. for $3500 an acre. Even allowing
for the possibility that the Education
Department got the best of the land,
the difference between the three prices
raises some serious doubts about de-
partmental valuation practice.
The method the Bolte Government
has chosen to investigate the first two
purchases raises serious questions of its
own. Before Parliament reassembled
for the spring session, Sir Henry an-
nounced that a board of inquiry into
the transactions would be set up under
a Queen’s Counsel, Mr. Voumard.
An objection to this was raised by
Mr. Jack Galbally, Labor Leader in
the Legislative Council. It concerned
the whole question of ministerial re-
sponsibility to Parliament. The Bolte
Government has frequently been ac-
cused of stifling Parliamentary discus-
sion before by appointing boards of
inquiry, and Mr. Galbally declared in
the Upper House last week: “It is the
prerogative of Parliament itself to con-
trol Ministers of the Crown, and that
prerogative cannot be taken away from
Parliament. That a Minister of the
Crown is made directly and primarily
responsible to Parliament for the ad-
ministration of his department is a
necessary and vital safeguard against
department aggression, incompetence,
and malpractice. Deep-rooted in our
constitutional history, it is confirmed
by Parliament itself.” -
Mr. Galbally continued: “Twenty-
four hours before Parliament assembled,
the Cabinet, which includes Ministers
whose first duty by every canon of
constitutional law wants to explain
their actions to Parliament, abdicated
its responsibility. The Cabinet, of which
they are members, thought that by ap-
pointing a board of inquiry this would
snuff out or stifle Parliament’s right
to question.”
Without danger from a weak opposi-
tion the Bolte Government has cer-
tainly weakened Parliamentary powers
and privileges in its prosperous reign
and the power of the administration
has grown at the expense of the elected
Parliament.
But appointing boards of inquiry
may not be a solution in future. A
recent decision of the House of Com-
mons, for which there will be a lot
of support in Australia, extends the
area of Parliamentary discussion into
matters formerly regarded as automati-
cally sub judice. Such a decision would
affect the standing orders of Australian
Parliaments, although the details of
the extension of the area of debate
have yet to be worked out by Speakers
and their Parliamentary committees.
BRIAN BUCKLEY
Mt. Isa—After the K57
John Stokes, the first European to lay his eyes on the countryside around Mt.
Isa, proclaimed them the Plains of Promise. He saw promise in the possibility
of developing the area as a haven for yeoman farmers.
In his diary for August, 1841, he
wrote that he had “breathed a prayer
that ere long the now level horizon be
broken by a succession of tapering
spires rising from Christian hamlets
that must ultimately stud this country.”
Stokes’ spiritual hopes for the area
are yet to be realised.
But perhaps there is compensation
for him in the remarkable material
progress of this apparently barren part
of Australia. Instead of his church
spires, the skyline is dominated by
500-foot chimney stacks belching sul-
phurous smoke, slag heaps like medium-
sized hills, and giant warehouses pro-
tecting machinery from the sun and
the dust and the very occasional rain.
Last week a hundred southerners
were flown in by Mt. Isa Mines to
observe and celebrate the formal open-
ing of two new pieces of machinery.
One is the K 57 Shaft and its head-
working machinery rises like a city
building 192 feet into the air. Most
of the project is underground, a world
record sized shaft, giving access to
lead-zinc-silver and copper ore deposits
as far as 3700 feet down in the ground.
Together with the second plant - the
Concentrator plant housed in a shed
130 yards long and about as many
feet high these works will sustain
Mt. Isa’s metal production for a solid
ten years and raise its value by a half
to well over $lOO million a year.
The company put on a lavish dinner
for over a thousand visitors and pro-
vided them with beer stocked in re-
frigerators in their motel rooms. Yet
Mt. Isa is not all affluence and gaiety,
There is widespi'ead and genuine pride
in the development of the mine, but
there are also resentments against the
company. There are modern amenities,
but the town is still a frontier settle-
ment, with its share of shanties. As
the chairman of directors, Mr. George
Fisher, said at the ceremonial speech,
the company has a paternalistic out-
look toward the citizens of the town,
The company makes itself responsible
for the provision of almost all com-
munity services, and, consequently,
many of the town’s people regard it
as a Big Brother overseeing every
aspect of their lives,
The union movement is as badly
splintered as ever, and the office of
the Australian Workers’ Union cur-
rently has written on its front wall in
red paint the message “SCABS.” But
the Committee for Membership Con-
trolj 0 f p at Mackie fame, and the mili-
tant Trades and Labor Council are
losi their hold When they moV ed for
a al st on the occas ion of

, , r It „„i,

for « »‘ th th ? m , and were able to
attract a crowd of only 85 to a protest
meeting.
A number of genuine grievances re-
main. Housing could be better, the
influence of the Company on every-
day life could be a little less per-
vasive, and a better system of profit-
sharing could be introduced,

The Late Late Show
Stripped of all the palaver in Parliament and in the Press, the wrangle among
retail chemists in Sydney about after-hours trading really boils down to a simple
question: Can the public obtain a comprehensive and continuous sales service
without creating chaos in the industry?
In other words, is there some way
in which you can buy your medicines,
toiletries, or sunglasses from a chemist
24 hours a day without cut-throat com-
petition and loss of efficiency? The
State Government is sandwiched be-
tween two opposing groups of chemists
on this one, trying to please both, the
public, and, of course, itself.
The main contestants in this battle
are the New South Wales Branch of
the Federated Pharmaceutical Service
Guild and the Association of Pharma-
ceutical Chemists. The Guild, a regis-
tered industrial organisation of employ-
ers with some 2000 members in this
State, claims to be the recognised in-
dustry authority in pharmacy for New
South Wales. It has the backing of
the Pharmaceutical Society of N.S.W.,
which is a professional, educational,
and scientific body. The Association of
Pharmaceutical Chemists is also
registered as a union of employers, but
it was formed only a few months ago,
largely because a small, but apparently
growing, number of chemists no longer
saw eye-to-eye on Guild policy.
'J'HE industry has been in a state of
ferment since 1964 when the Indus-
trial Commission, which regulates trad-
ing hours of the Chemists (State) Award
under the Factories Shops and Indus-
tries Act, gave some chemists permission
to keep their shops open longer than
the legally stipulated trading hours.
These chemists operate in beachfront
areas, Kings Cross, Circular Quay
Wharf, and Wynyard Station.
Against Guild opposition the Com-
mission ruled that where chemists,
operating in particular areas, can prove
a public need, they should be legally
permitted to trade outside normal trad-
ing hours.
Chemists in other areas, encouraged
by the “Kings Cross example,” have
embarked on what is now known as an
“all-night” service, selling medicines
as well as non-essential goods normally
stocked by pharmacists at all hours of
the day and night. Despite more than
300 prosecutions by the Guild against
this form of illegal practice, some all-
night chemists have done rather well,
building up trade and from their
profits, financing free delivery and
other customer services by the use of
radio-controlled goods vehicles.
Some of these chemists, operating in
various parts of the Sydney metropoli-
tan area, have asked the Industrial
Commission for permission to extend
trading hours because, they claim, ex-
perience shows there is a public need
for a comprehensive after-hours service.
The Guild is plainly worried about
what it describes as disorder in the
industry, because some chemist shops
trade long hours, build up a sizable
following to the detriment of other
chemists, who, to observe the law, put
down the shutters on time and, as a
result, lose business.
To prevent the spread of this type
of competition the Guild has been try-
ing a series of after-hours schemes, not
all of which proved successful. Its
latest plan, however, for special night
prescription services operated by
chemists acting as partners in 36 Syd-
ney metropolitan areas for a start,
appears to have gained Government
approval. The plan is borrowed from
Melbourne, where ten of these after-
hours partnership prescription services
have been operating for some time.
These partnerships would not intensify
competition, as they are intended to
operate only with a limited range of
essential medicines and pharmaceutical
products at times when most chemists
are normally closed.
The Association of Pharmaceutical
Chemists does not think much of the
partnership scheme, which it fears is
unprofitable, cumbersome and, in the
end result, unworkable. It prefers a
system of trading for
all areas w'here the Industrial Commis-
sion recognises the existence of a pub-
lic need and allows chemists to keep
their shops open as long as they like.
To avoid unfair competition, the Associ-
ation thinks retail chemists should be
allowed to operate like family doctors
who have private roster arrangements
or work in group practices. Last week
some all-night chemists urged the
State Government to postpone its
proposed legislation and to allows the
Industrial Commission to make
“impartial judgments” on the public’s
needs of chemists’ services.
The question arises whether
under present circumstances, the busi-
ness hours of a chemist, running an
open shop, should be controlled by
Parliament and, if so, whether his claim
for extended trading hours is not
greater than those of corner shops or
pubs, for instance. The Government
has answered this question by propos-
ing a legislative compromise under
which the Guild would get its way with
after-hour pharmacies operating in
partnerships of at least six local chem-
ists, and the Association would be
shown some goodwill through the
establishment of special pharmacies
that may stay open 24 hours a day.
BUT, as with so many contrived com-
promises, this one is not without
its glaring shortcomings. By approv-
ing two new types of chemist shops,
customers would literally have to visit
different pharmacists for different goods
and services. This is because, under the
Government’s legislative proposals, the
all-night chemist would be allowed to
sell only essential medicines and a
limited range of pharmaceutical items.
There would be one law for Kings
Cross chemists and another for chemists
in other suburbs.
All of which suggests that the pro-
posed legislation recently explained
by the N.S.W, Premier Mr. Askin in
order to resolve the issue will not
stop the wrangle. Even the opposing
camps of chemists agree that the prob-
lems facing the industry are complex.
Perhaps Professor S. E. Wright, of the
Pharmacy Department at Sydney Uni-
versity, w r as not so far off the mark
when he suggested a couple of months
ago that there should be a searching
enquiry and survey of the whole in-
dustry to define the public’s need and
determine the minimum population re-
quired to support a professional phar-
macy.

Three Million Useless Acres
The Western Australian Government is split in a most unusual way over a
tract of land that has been considered useless. It is a bitter dispute which, at
first glance, is simply an extension of internecine rumblings between the Country
Party and Liberal and Country League, partners of the governing coalition.
And basically this is so. But a closer
look shows demarcation lines so fuzzy
that some Liberal young Turks and
even a minister—have joined what many
see as “Country Party ranks,” and
similarly there have been “defections”
from the other side. The issues involved
are so basic, and the campaigns from
both sides are being fought and lobbied
so cleverly and persistently, that cer-
tainly this will provide one of the
most edifying tooth-and-claw jobs of
the year.
At. stake is Western Australia
Development Corporation’s claim to
three million acres of land between the
western end of the Bight and the
trans-Australia railway line. WADC is
a group which first began looking the
State over in October 1963, and since
then has developed to a multi-national
concern, 40 percent American, 30 per-
cent Australian (the Commercial Bank,
Australian United Corporation, and
Wesfarmers Coop), 20 percent British,
and ten French. But it has been the
American predominance which has
grated on opponents to the group’s
participation in the State, and this has
been greatly magnified by a backlash
of bitterness over the Chase develop-
ment scheme at Esperance where Aus-
tralian money and ideas subsidised
American speculation.
WADC was granted provisional study
rights to 4.4 million acres of land fring-

ing the desert, with the idea of bringing
the vast technological and financial re-
sources available to its participating
members to bear on studying what
might be done to develop this
apparently useless area. It seemed a
simple enough deal: If something came
out of it, the new knowledge would be
made available to the State but the
corporation would be able to have the
land to sell, with half Australian equity;
if nothing came of it, only they would
stand to lose the risk capital.
But, quickly, questioning began: Is it
as useless a tract as has been thought?
Could much of it be developed already
with conventional farming methods? If
they could do it, why should Aus-
tralians not do it, even if it had to wait
a few years? This is the concern of
most farming people and their advisers.
Top men from the Agriculture Depart-
ment, Institute of Agriculture, and
CSIRO have added their voices to the
protests. In the light of such feeling
negotiations for continuation of study
rights were suspended in March when
the Liberal Minister for Lands, Mr.
Bovell, felt he could no longer back
the corporation’s hopes. The case for
the corporation gained nothing in the
farmers' eyes when the Minister for
Industrial Development, Mr. Court,
took up the baton, which has only
recently been grasped by the Premier,
Mr. Brand.
March a seven-man committee
of Government backbenchers has
been looking at it again. The chairman,
Liberal rebel Mr. Bill Grayden, who
once resigned from the Party and stood
as an independent Liberal, says: Basi-
cally I am opposed to Australians having
to purchase from a largely overseas cor-
poration a stake in their own country.
There is not a single valid argument
in favor; the only possible reason would
be to have development a few years
earlier.” It has been reported that this
committee voted 4-3 to toss out the
scheme, but this is now questioned. One
member of the committee, Country
Party man Mr. Tom Hart, has been
too sick to comment, and this has added
further to the bitterness of exchanges.
Opponents say some of the corpor-
ation’s schemes have verged on the
science fictional or downright cheeky.
They cite a plan to turn waters of
south-west flowing rivers inland to irri-
gate the Nullarbor Plain; of a sugges-
tion that the corporation be granted
mineral rights plus a cut of royalties
that would flow' when overseas mining
exploiters w ; ere brought in. Yet the cor-
poration can answer both charges: the
water scheme was a theoretical exercise
done from maps in Los Angeles by par-
ticipating partners, the Ralph M. Par-
sons Corporation who have, in fact,
turned rivers around in many parts of
the world. It was dropped when, on site,
they learnt that projected development
would call on all known water resources
in the area. The one-eighth cut of
royalties for landowners is common
practice in many parts of the world,
compensation for granting physical
access to otherwise inaccessible regions.
The corporation plans to build roads
which can be used by mining groups,
a proposal only recently rejected.
As things stand, 1.4 million acres has
been trimmed from the areas originally
granted for study now to be over
three years. Claims that the Govern-
ment has over-ridden the majority
opinion of a committee set up to look
into the scheme, along with new devel-
opment only now coming to the boil,
will ensure a hectic passage if a Bill
of ratification comes before Parliament.
Even this is contentious. The Minister
for Justice. Mr. Griffith, replied with a
truism when, in answer to a question,
he said a Bill would be needed before
any big area of land could be alienated.
He did not say this was being framed,
and this implies that WADC might be
asked to study for three years, unpro-
tected by legislation, before negotiating
begins— not the kind of bargain such
people would take on.


New wine variety
from Australia
wins Gold Medal
at International
Wine Fair
Me Williams
Private Bin 56
Lexia has been
awarded a Gold
Medal at the
1966 International
Wine Fair held at
Ljubljana,
Yugoslavia.
McWilliam's Lexia, recently
introduced to the Australian
market, is a distinctive, dry
white table wine which
could not be exhibited in
any Australian Wine show,
because there was no classi-
fication for this new variety.
McWilliam’s. therefore,
entered it overseas, and are
justifiably proud of receiv-
ing a top Gold Medal
award.

In the short time it has been available, this wine
has received considerable acclaim. McWilliam’s
Lexia is made from the grape variety known as
Lexia. and was produced at McWilliam’s Robin-
vale Winery in Victoria. During fermentation
the temperature was maintained below 55° F.,
and this has helped to retain in the wine a very
powerful aroma of the grape, as well as a
tremendous volume of flavour. This light, dry
white table wine is an ideal accompaniment to
most foods, particularly seasoned fish dishes,
white meats and poultry.
Other successes at Ljubljana for McWilliam’s
included Gold Medals for Sparkling Chateau
Gay; Private Bin 530 Claret 1963; Mount Pleas-
ant Sauterne; Dry Friar Sherry; Sherry (fruity
type); Muscat; Mount Pleasant Hermitage;
Champagne and Brandy.
This continued success overseas follows immedi-
ately on the award for the third successive year
of the trophy for the Most Successful Exhibitor
at the Queensland Royal National Show, 1966.
For a number of years McWilliam’s Wines have
enjoyed unparalleled successes at wine shows
and exhibitions throughout Australia and over-
seas. Due to public demand larger stocks of
show wines have been laid down in recent years
and are now available from your Hotel,
Licensed Grocer, Club or Restaurant.

The Plodding War
“There are no quick solutions. There can be no substitute for slow, gradual,
laborious effort. The war is grey and plodding.” This was one of Dr. Frank Knop-
felmacher’s main conclusions after a visit to Saigon and a week’s tour of the main
provincial centres, of Dalat, Danang, and Hue.
A Senior Lecturer in Psychology at
the University of Melbourne, Dr.
Knopfelmacher visited South Vietnam
as part of a three-week Asia tour
sponsored by the Australian Association
for Cultural Freedom. He also visited
Djakarta, Bombay, and Calcutta.
Dr. Knopfelmacher returned to Aus-
tralia last week more convinced than
before of the necessity and justice of
American and Australian intervention
in South Vietnam. Not unexpectedly,
therefore, he had some strong words
for the local critics of the involvement.
“My intellectual contempt for the
Left Wing academics who oppose the
Government’s policy is boundless.
When one is confronted with the
reality and compares it with what
these people say, their arguments are
so utterly fantastic. You could say
that my contempt for them has escal-
ated now that I have been to Viet-
nam.”
There was criticism, too, for some
of the supporters of Government poli-
cies. “Some Government supporters
ai’e longing for quick victories, for
dramatic solutions. There are none in
Vietnam. The true difficulty of the
war is not understood. Normally wars
are between the armies, navies, air
forces of two States. In Vietnam the
problem is that the infra-structure, the
administration of the villages in the
countryside disintegrated and the Viet
Cong have set up their own. Now at
the same time as the Viet Cong are
being fought, a whole new infra-
structure has to be established in the
liberated areas. You have to provide
security in the villages and protect the
people from torture, intimidation, and
terror. This is the main aspect in
the depth of the war. It may take five
years.”
But surely this was the way many
commentators saw the problem? Dr.
Knopfelmacher felt it was not widely
grasped. “People assume that guerrilla
warfare, succeeds in the three classic
stages outlined by Mao Tse-tung and
General Giap. But the three stages
operate simultaneously, and this is not
realised. For instance, in the Delta the
war is between Stage 1 and 2, that is
political terror and small-force insur-
gency. In the highlands it is in Stage 3,
with main-force units fighting. In the
cleared villages it might move back to
Stage I—terror1 —terror and intimidation.”
He was impressed, indeed surprised,
with the “outstanding quality” of the
Australian personnel, both military
and civilian. Australians he said could
be really proud of their effort. Another
one of the great surprises was the
quality of the American personnel. They
were well-behaved, rather more than in
Europe after World War 11, and their
morale was high. This high quality of
the Allied personnel was quite out-
standing and if this military power was
the only variable the war would come to
an early end. But there was more to it
—the big headache was that the South
Vietnamese Army was not yet up to
the task of breaking the administrative
hold of the Viet Cong in many areas.
“It is not capable of meeting the chal-
lenge of counter-government.”
The trouble was that the South Viet-
namese Army had traditionally been a
mandarin army with no incentive for
initiative. The aim of many of its
officers had been to avoid casualties
and to angle for position and wealth in
Saigon. Some of the leading generals
are widely reputed to be corrupt and
this has been reflected in morale.
Ironically, said Dr. Knopfelmacher
President Diem has been blamed for
many things he did not do, such as
persecuting the Buddhists and not
blamed for his real sins. His chief sin
was that he had no conception of the
need for a modern army.
J)R. KNOPFELMACHER felt that
the Americans must develop more
leverage on the South Vietnamese to
force better performance. “The trouble
with the Americans is not that they are
running the place like imperialists . . .
the trouble is that they are not running
it enough. If American blood and
treasure is being spent in Vietnam and
sections of the South Vietnamese popu-
lation are benefiting out of this, as they
undoubtedly are, then they can be
expected to show more leadership.”
Having been to Vietnam what did
he think the war was about? “The
war is essentially about the proposi-
tion that this kind of counter-insur-
gency involving terror, defamation,
false promises, murder, and subversion
can succeed a way has to be
developed to show that it cannot
succeed or else it will spread.” And
how willing were the people of South
Vietnam to fight the war?
Dr. Knopfelmacher pointed out that
distinctions had to be made between
the people at village level and the
politically conscious section of the
public. At village level “normal poli-
tical concepts did not apply.” The
only consciousness is the village, and
the villager is prepared to support
those who can protect his property. “A
Vietnamese villager would agree with
the maxim of Locke that the para-
mount task of government is to
protect property.”
Among the politically conscious
sections, Dr. Knopfelmacher could not
find any identifiable opinion that sup-
ported the Viet Cong and wanted the
Viet Cong to win. Even among South


Vietnamese opponents of the Saigon
government who had long jail sen-
tences hanging over them, he found
complete opposition to the Viet Cong.
“The Viet Cong are the fiercest Com-
munists in the world they are
worse than the Chinese ever were. No
one wants them to win.”

Revolution
A senator from the Philippines is
touring Australia with a call to revolu-
tion. Eloquent and committed to the
need for the “Asian revolution,”
Senator Manglapus of the Philippines
wants Australia to help bring it about.
“Australia will have to take some
far-reaching decisions requiring bold-
ness and vision not only to benefit
Asia but to benefit the whole world,”
he told THE BULLETIN last week.
For Senator Manglapus the revolution
hos in the new ideas and vision which
will bring an end to the “crushing
burdens which crush the human spirit
' the concern with the next meal, the
roof over the head, the medicine for
the sick wife, the education of the
children.” If countries like Australia
and the United States are unable to
export this kind of revolution, then the
Communist Chinese style of revolution
ma y appeal more widely to Asians.
This is one of the themes in the
Dyason Lectures which Senator Man-
glapus is giving as a guest of the Aus-
tralian Institute of International
Affairs. Regarded in the Philippines as
one of the “new breed” of political
leaders, he has, at 45, already had a
distinguished career in law and politics.
He was the late President Magsaysay’s
Secretary of Foreign Affairs and last
year ran as the third candidate for
the Presidency now held by former
Senator Marcos.
For Australia to play her role in
the “Asian revolution,” fie feels one of
the bold decisions must come in the
area of immigration policy. In one of
his lectures Senator Manglapus quotes
approvingly from the work of a Ceylon-
ese theologian, Father Tissa Balasuriya,
who has asked for the rich white nations
to open up their frontiers to the mil-
lions of Asians in the name of “macro-
justice.”
The theologian laments that if he
was born of white parents he could
go anywhere and “reproduce his kind.”
If he was white, countries like Austra-
lia, Canada, and South Africa would
not speak of unemployment and other
difficulties. But these same countries
“generously give non-whites arms to
fight the Communists to make the
world safe for political democracy and
Christian civilisation. And they blame
us when we are not enthusiastic.”
Senator Manglapus adds that this
might seem extreme to some, but it
explains why many Asians do not find
inspiration in “democracy” and the
traditional values which go with it.
“Those successful slogans of Australian
pragmatism, ‘Freedom, equality, afflu-
ence, pursuit of happiness,’ roughly
corresponding to the American Jeffer-
sonian declaration, do not titillate the
rural Asian. He is shackled by three
chains tradition, tenancy, and
colonial centralism and he must
first be liberated.”
And one way for Australia to do
this is to move in the direction of the
“first truly international nationalism
and the first genuine bridge between
East and West, North and South.”
Australia could succeed where others
had failed because it was aware of
the mistakes of others, because it was
unsaddled with the conflicts of con-
queror and conquered, and because it
had a spirit of “give-her-a-go.”
Senator Manglapus said that he was
all in favor of the idea of free enter-
prise in theory, but the old-fashioned
idea that free enterprise left to its own
devices would somehow bring pros-
perity to all was wrong. When free
enterprise resulted in the many losing
their dignity and the few' sharing the
benefits as had happened it was neces-
sary to think again.

Verwoerd’s Life of Crisis
A South African Tragedy
From a SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT in CAPE TOWN
PR. HENDRIK FRENSCH VER-
WOERD, whose life spilled out on
the floor of Cape Town’s House
of Assembly last week through the stab
wounds made by an apparently un-
balanced misfit, was a man of crisis. At
the age of two his religious father, Wil-
lem, appalled at the “atrocities” com-
mitted by the British on the Boers in
the South African War, closed his
grocery store in a little village near
Amsterdam, in Holland, and migrated
to South Africa.
For Hendrik and his elder brother,
Len, and their sister, Lucia, who was
born in South Africa, life .was one up-
heaval after another as their father
moved further and further away from
his new South African grocery business
to embrace the church eventually,
to become a missionary. In 1912 Wil-
lem Verwoerd was posted to Bulawayo,
in Southern Rhodesia, and the young
Hendrik found himself at a school
steeped in the British tradition
which he hated from the outset.
He was a bright scholar,
hungry for learning, and a great
reader. When his headmaster re-
vealed to him that he had won
a scholarship for continued study
in Rhodesia, he refused to accept
it and elected to accompany his
parents to the Orange Free State
of South Africa the most anti-
British province in the country.
His very British headmaster was
so incensed that he literally
shoved young Hendrik out of his
study with the words “you
wretched little rebel.”
Verwoerd never forgot the in-
cident. His entire background up
to this point was related to a
distrust of the British and,
although in his later years he
tempered this distrust with the
need for political expediency, he
never lost his anti-British senti-
ment.
Verwoerd was never the
revered, national figure. His
people leaned on him more than
they loved him. He was always
the man who could be relied upon
to stave off trouble, to confound the
enemies of South Africa. In this he
never failed. No other leader in
South Africa’s turbulent history was so
adroit in anticipating a crisis so accur-
ately and so accomplished in taking
avoiding action. Only a man who be-
lieved so thoroughly in himself and
in his cause could have steered his
country through the problems of the
six years since Britain’s former Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan made his
historic “wind of change” speech in
that same house of assembly in which
Verwoerd succumbed to the assassin’s
dagger.
Only a man who could guilessly con-
fess as he did that “I never have the
nagging doubt that perhaps I am
wrong” could have been so resolute, so
uncompromising, and so immovable
from the course he had set for his
country of adoption.
Apartheid or separateness was more
than a belief to Verwoerd. It was a
creed, a means of white survival. He
went to his death still believing in the
rightness of apartheid. I knew him well
enough to know that had his assassin
last Tuesday offered the choice of re-
jecting apartheid, Dr. Verwoerd would
have had the courage to choose death
instead.
There are many South Africans who
believe that Verwoerd was destined for
the assassin’s gun or knife. He was too
vital to retire and quietly relinquish
Dr. Verwoerd and Nigeria’s Sir Abubakar - both
assassinated.
the power he had assumed over his
country. Nobody who knew him well
could imagine him in such a role.
In 1959, a year after Verwoerd be-
came Prime Minister, a Nationalist
Member of Parliament confided to me:
“I’ll tell you something. We’re stuck
with this chap Verwoerd until some-
one shoots him.” The following year
David Pratt, wealthy English-speaking
farmer who was something of an un-
balanced epileptic, shot Verwoerd in
the face 50 feet away from me. Pratt
went on trial for attempted murder.
He made repeated outbursts in court
about Verwoerd representing the “epi-
tome of apartheid” and was committed
to a mental institution, where he
ultimately committed suicide.
Verwoerd’s survival from the attempt
on his life was hailed as a miracle, a
sign that the protective hand of God
still hovered over the people to whom
he had given the task of maintaining
Christianity on a black continent. But
for Verwoerd, his recovery was more a
will to survive than a miracle. Pratt
had left a spark of life in the sturdy
body and the sturdier mind fanned it
into flame.
Verwoerd had scarcely regained
consciousness when he began pulling
together the Nationalist Party, which
under the successive blows of Sharpes-
ville and the assassination attempt, was
starting to waver in its avowed de-
termination to carry apartheid through
to the limit.
It was a testing time for the men
in Verwoerd’s cabinet and several of
them were found wanting in his eyes.
He never forgave them for their
political frailty, but at the same
time he seized events immedi-
ately following the attempt on his
life to establish himself once and
for all as the strong man of the
party and the unquestionable
leader.
I knew Verwoerd from the
time he took over the editorial
chair of the National newspaper
“Die Transvaler.” He was not a
brilliant editor and frustrated his
staff almost beyond endurance.
But for all that he was a friendly
man, and his carelessly brushed,
silver hair softened the austerity
and produced a kindly looking
man. He was deeply sincere, but
his very sincerity always fright-
ened me. He could make logic
out of nonsense. His mumbo-
jumbo about separate develop-
ment, Bantustans, blacks develop-
ing in their own sphere, black
and white being equal. but
separate was delivered in a
friendly, sincere tone of voice
which had an hypnotic quality
that left his listeners unable or
unwilling to separate fact from
fantasy. One had to shut one’s eyes
and ears and focus the mind on the
fraud of the Bantustan policy, the in-
justice of job reservation (for whites),
the blatant affront of a “whites only”
sign on a park bench, the immorality
of the Immorality Act, the torture of
house arrest, ban and exile, and the
brutality of solitary confinement with-
out trial to break the spell. These are
all things done in the name of apartheid
and accepted by the bulk of South
Africa’s whites. Yet, it is difficult to
blame Verwoerd for them. Certainly
he did not set out to produce these


evils for he was not an evil man. Some-
how they crept in as part of the system
of maintaining apartheid.
Dr. Verwoerd was a good psycholo-
gist. As a Professor of Psychology at
Stellenbosch University one of his
favorite exercises was to stage a mock
assassination and get his students to
describe what they had witnessed. “The
mind tends to believe what it wants to
believe and rejects what it does not
want to believe,” he once said, and he
used the varying “eye-witness” accounts
given by his students of the assassina-
tion to prove it.
Verwoerd brought his psychology to
the political arena with great success.
He accomplished his life-long ambition
to establish a republic with consum-
mate skill. It was a painless operation
for South Africa and a great triumph
for Verwoerd.
There are many who believe that
he was equally determined to withdraw
South Africa from the British Com-
monwealth at the first opportunity and
that he did, in fact, manufacture the
opportunity. I do not believe that.
Verwoerd was always a man of his
word whether he promised punishment
or reward. I am convinced he would
have kept his bargain to English-speak-
ing South Africans to remain in the
Commonwealth had the African States
not made continued membership unten-
able.
Significantly, he obtained his Doc-
torate at Stellenbosch for a thesis on
“the blunting of emotions.” After
he had completed his studies in
psychology in Germany and the United
States, the young Verwoerd returned
to Stellenbosch and in 1932 was
appointed Professor of Sociology and
Social Welfare. It was a post that
brought him face to face with the
poverty among so many Afrikaners
who, forced off the land by the depres-
sion of the early ’3os and having no
other skills, were forced to take jobs
as laborers wielding pick and shovel
beside Africans.
'y/’ERWOERD decided to champion
South Africa’s poor whites almost all
of whom were Afrikaners. He became
an authority on their plight which he
believed would drag them down to the
level of the blacks and which would
eventually result in economic and
social integration. This was the begin-
ning of Verwoerd the politician, and
through sheer force of personality and
an ability to stir the emotions of people
around him, he started the Nationalist
Party off on an emotional binge that
was only halted temporarily by World
War 11.
With the first post-war general elec-
tion (1948), Dr. Verwoerd gave up his
editorship of the “Transvaler” and
made himself available for election to
Parliament. Disappointed as he was by
his personal defeat, he was jubilant at
the success of the Nationalist Party and
his reward came in the shape of an
appointment to the Senate. Two years
later he was made Minister of Native
Affairs. Verwoerd was then 49. It
was ironic that the man who had striven
so long for the recognition of the whites
as an elite class should suddenly find
himself the great white father of the
blacks —the Great Induna.
There were powerful members of the
Nationalist Party who were afraid of
Verwoerd. He was too dedicated,
almost fanatical—a martyr in the mak-
ing. The portfolio of Native Affairs
was a comfortable little backwater for
the man who had to be rewarded. But
for Verwoerd there are no still ponds.
He stirred his department with zeal.
“He’s had us on the hop from the first
day,” complained a senior member of
the Department a week after
Verwoerd’s appointment. Far from
being sidetracked, Verwoerd began to
build an empire. His Native Affairs
Department soon became the most vital
Government department in Pretoria and
he the most talked about member of
the Cabinet.
The Government had come to power
in 1948 on the policy of apartheid, and
while Verwoerd’s colleagues in the
Cabinet could think of little more than
erecting huge signs “Whites Only” in
railway stations, post offices, and on
park benches, Verwoerd, tackling apar-
theid from the other end, soon out-
stripped his fellow Ministers in effort.
He was already working toward the
logical conclusion of apartheid—terri-
torial separation.
He developed the Bantustan policy—
physical separation with the theory, at
least, of equal development for white
and black in their own areas. By
arbitrary decision, Parliamentary legis-
lation, and Government proclamation,
Verwoerd pegged out the African
homelands and made Africans aliens
in white areas, which were available
to them only temporarily while they
served the whites as migrant workers.
Verwoerd weathered the storms both
inside and outside South Africa that
gathered momentum as his policy un-
folded. He stood fast and assured the
world that what he was doing was, in
fact, for the benefit of the Africans
themselves as much as for the whites.
“I stand four-square for apartheid,” he
said, “but it must be apartheid with
justice for the black as well as the
white ... no minority can claim per-
petual domination just because it is a
white group.”
Verwoerd stumped the country ex-
plaining, simplifying, and expounding
his policy. Always his wife, Betsy,
whom he married in 1927, was at his
side. Formerly Betsy Schoombie, Mrs.
Verwoerd is herself a woman of great
intelligence. She took her M.A. at
Stellenbosch and has been as staunch
a champion of the Afrikaners and as
much a believer in apartheid as her
husband was. They were a devoted
couple and Betsy’s contribution to her
husband’s success is incalculable.
His violent death, apart from the
personal tragedy for his wife and their
seven children, is a tragedy for South
Africa however much one may disagree
with apartheid. Dr. Verwoerd so over-
shadowed his colleagues that only the
strongest of them emerged as a likely
successor and if he, Mr. John Vorster,
the present Minister of Justice, steps
into Dr. Verwoerd’s shoes, the pace at
which southern Africa is heading
toward explosion will quicken.
Mr. Vorster is dynamic in a tough
way. He lacks diplomacy and is forth-
right in his utterances to the point of
recklessness. He is dangerously smug
about his success in keeping down sub-
version and eliminating African poli-
tical leaders. Mr. Vorster frightens
people and he has a powerful police
force as a weapon against those who
would step out of line. I think he may
get the job, but I hope he doesn’t.
The other two candidates, Minister
of Transport, Mr. Ben Schoeman, and
Dr. Eben Donges, the Treasurer, are
too timid about apartheid to please the
inner Broederbond clique of the
Nationalist Party, which will ultimately
decide who will be Prime Minister.
M R. Schoeman, a former railway
engine driver who became a
moderately successful real estate agent
before becoming a cabinet minister,
leads the Nationalist Party in the
Transvaal, where control of the Party is
centred. But the 61-year-old Mr. Schoe-
man is more of a practical politician
than a theorist. His railway portfolio
has taught him that the African is so
inextricably interwoven in his transport
complex that economic apartheid
scarcely exists. Furthermore, he has
failed the Party by his inability to im-
plement their policy of withdrawing all
Africans from the Western cape to
which they were not indigenous. His
railways could simply not function
without them.
Dr. Donges, on the other hand, car-
ries the image of the liberal cape
Nationalist who long ago came to terms
with the cape coloreds. At 68 and
as a cape Nationalist he is scarcely in
Mr. Vorster’s league.
Dr. Verwoerd’s assassination may,
however, have sobered the extreme
Nationalists for a while at least. They-
may be urged to take a breather from
their extremism and appoint as Prime
Minister a man who can be relied
upon to hold the situation at its present
simmering level. This would provide
an opportunity for an outsider such as
the present Minister of Defence, Mr.
Piet Botha, who at 50, has come a long
way in the party in a comparatively
short time.
Perhaps the greatest irony of Dr.
Verwoerd’s death by violence is that
South Africa in trying to justify
apartheid will now no longer be able
to use her favorite finger-pointing
argument that peace and tranquillity
prevail in South Africa whereas else-
where on the African continent the
black States are involved in perpetual
coups, bloodshed, and murder.

Germans and Jews
Visit to a Belgian Death Camp
By ISI LEIBLER
DELEGATES to international con-
-1 ferences frequently convince
themselves that their trips can
only be justified if their names are
incorporated into the records of pro-
ceedings. Six hundred representatives
from Jewish communities throughout
the world meeting at a World Jewish
Congress Assembly once in seven years
are no exception.
The proceedings of the 12-day Fifth
Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish
Congress, which took place in August
in Brussels, were therefore inordinately
loaded with irrelevant, tedious, paro-
chial monologues by speakers who felt
impelled to get to the rostrum and have
their say. The dramatic climax of the
Congress was to have been the so-called
German-Jewish dialogue. Already
prior to the Congress a lot of tension
had built up concerning the proposed
dialogue. At one stage the World
Jewish Congress President, Dr. Nachum
Goldmann, had been forced to resort
to a threat of resignation in order to
subdue the group on his executive who
wanted the meeting cancelled. Yet,
when the discussion took place, not even
the mass of journalists and TV cameras
prevented the evening from being a
great anticlimax. At the outset, a
number of groups boycotted the meet-
ing after releasing formal Press
statements justifying their stand. There
were also quite a few individual dele-
gates who quietly absented themselves.
In his introductory remarks. Dr.
Goldmann went out of his way to
emphasise that the discussion was being
held to demonstrate that “the problem
is far from solved. There is no
reconciliation around the corner . . .
There can be no forgetting or for-
giving.” A message from Professor Karl
Jaspers stated that the Nazi crime
against the Jewish people “will remain
associated with the very idea of Ger-
mans just as pyramids of skulls evoke
the name of the Mongols.” A paper
was then presented in German by Pro-
fessor Gershon Scholem, of the Hebrew
University, attempting somewhat un-
successfully to outline the love-hate
relationship which had developed over
the centuries between German Jews
and their motherland.
Professor Golo Mann, a distinguished
German intellectual with a strong anti-
Nazi record, followed with a lecture
designed to discount the thesis that
Nazism was an organic development
having roots in earlier German auth-
oritarian and anti-Semitic trends. At
the same time he said: “I cannot get
rid of this burden on my life. I can
never fully trust my compatriots, the
Germans; I can never fully trust human
beings, as the Germans are also human
beings, highly civilised Europeans.
Whatever we may do and may strive
for the shadows of Auschwitz,
T'reblinka, and the Warsaw Ghetto are
upon us.”
The distinguished American Jewish
historian Professor Salo Baron then
presented a well - documented paper
contradicting Mann’s thesis. Baron
traced the origins of Nazi anti-Semitism
back to the 11th century when the
demonic stereotype of the Jew as the
Antichrist and Satan became embedded
in German culture. Baron described the
Nazi Nuremburg racial laws as a return
to the Germanic Middle Ages with
the absence of the medieval system of
law and order.
The highlight of the evening was the
speech personally delivered by Dr.
Eugen Gerstenmaier, the President of
the German Bundestag. Dr. Gersten-
maier came right to the point. He
frankly conceded that “such a cloud
of darkness and aimlessness emanates
from this debt of blood that today, even
after more than 20 years, many Ger-
mans are utterly unable to face it . . .
We find a muted protest against the
burdens of a cursed past which no man
can overcome.” The Bundestag Presi-
dent’s most telling point was that “re-
pentance, contrition, understanding of
the terrible extent of brutal annihilation
-—all this exists. The wish for compen-
sation as well—if this is at all possible
—but what is still missing is that initial
balance between Germans and Jews
which, as a rule, requires normal human
relations. But where should they come
from? How can we free ourselves from
the traumatic inhibitions laid upon us
by a past of which we must still say that
it does not lie only behind us but upon
us —upon all of us, on those, too, who
do not wish to think of it and much
less talk of it? As long as that is so,
there are limits to our tongues and to
our behaviour, which we Germans can-
not cross, even when our heart impels
us.”
The discussion culminated in the
early hours of the morning with a final
paper by Dr. Joachim Prinz, a Rabbi
who had occupied a pulpit in pre-war
Germany and is today one of the lead-
ing spokesmen for American Jews.
Rabbi Prinz hit a responsive chord with
his audience when he said: “The Ger-
mans must understand that the relation-
ship between the Germans and the Jews
of our generation can never be nor-
malised. We can talk to each other,
and indeed we must, but only for the
purpose of clarifying each other’s
minds. But it must be understood that
Germany, which was our home for so
many centuries, is no longer that, nor
can it ever be that . . . The relation-
ship between Germany and Israel can-
not be normal and must not be normal,
and whatever political exigencies and
practical considerations there may be,
the principle of the unique relationship
must not be relinquished. If this is
done, the basis even for a discussion and
for a collective dialogue is totally re-
moved.”
Like many other delegates, the even-
ing left me with a sense of frustration.
Far from helping to crystallise some
kind of a rational Jewish approach to
Germany, the discussion merely
heightened emotional feelings. Dialogue
is a two-way traffic. In this particular
case it is impossible for a Jew to discuss
the Nazi era and set aside his own
personal involvement. This was aptly
articulated by the spokesman for one
of the Congress groups which had boy-
cotted the German-Jewish discussion—
“ Our generation is the generation of
the ghetto, and the concentration
camps, of the Holocaust and the ghetto
uprisings. Before us, there still stands
the generation which marched to the
sounds of the ‘Horst Wessel,’ the
generation of the SS and the Gestapo.
The time for mutual exchanges has not
arrived. Six million Jews are unable to
participate in this discussion. Their
absence obligates us to forgo the
attempt to arrange a confrontation
which can be interpreted as the begin-
ning of reconciliation.”
An even more emotional speaker
put it this way: “The German people
has destroyed one-third of Jewry in our
generation after it had willingly
accepted and elected Hitler as its
leader ... In thousands of German
homes there are still the Sabbath
candlesticks of our mothers; countless
German women still wear the jewellery
given by Jewish parents to their child-
ren on festive occasions . . . Between
us and the Germans there rises a high
mountain which cannot be scaled
a pile of 6 million martyrs . . . These
horrible crimes for which human
language has no words to describe are
resting on the whole of the German
people; they are all responsible. The
mark of Cain is borne on the brow
of every German.”
This extreme condemnation of the
entire German people including a new
generation with no responsibility for
the sins of its fathers would not be
shared by most Jews. But to the non-

Jew, particularly the non-European
even the more “moderate” form of Jew-
ish “hatred” of Germans is usually re
garded as somewhat paranoid or at bes
an understandable but nonetheless ir
responsible pandering to nationa
hatred. In the age of Hiroshima anc
Stalinism, of general war crimes anc
the regular roll call of man’s in-
humanity to man, the Jewish refusa
to forget the past and look to the future
is more often than not regarded with
distaste.
Yet there is something unique in the
unspeakable sense about Jewish experi-
ence under Nazism. Even if one can
close one’s eyes to the quantitative
aspect of Nazi extermination (a third oi
the Jewish people and the overwhelming
majority of European Jews), the enor-
mity of the Nazi crime rests primarily
in its qualitative aspect. It represents
the climax to European Jewry’s heri-
tage of persecution. It is the 20th cen-
tury’s starkest example of a deliberate
and systematic effort to practically im-
plement genocidal measures. The death
sentence on every man, woman, or
infant of Jewish descent was final and
irrevocable and this sentence was im-
plemented by one of Europe’s most
civilised nations. When the chips were
down it was the Germans, not the bru-
tal peasant-based Eastern European
pogromists, who did the job.
It is because of these circumstances
that Jews do not regard the Nazi period
in the same manner as a nation look-
ing upon a past adversary or combat-
ant. It is also with good justification
that Jews do not make great distinctions
between Nazis and the Germans of
Hitler’s generation. If ever there was
an example of overall national culp-
ability it was the German involvement
with Nazism. This does not mean that
all Jews share a uniform attitude to-
ward the German question. For ex-
ample, once a year the Melbourne
Town Hall is packed out with a Jewish
audience gathered together for the pur-
pose of commemorating the extermin-
ation of their six million kinsmen. The
majority of the participants are middle-
aged or older and are first-generation
migrants to Australia. A large propor-
tion of them are actual survivors from
concentration camps and Nazi
persecution.
The atmosphere at these gatherings
is intensely emotional. Most of the
addresses are in Yiddish the verna-
cular language of East European Jews.
In recent years all the speakers con-
stantly complain about the absence of
young people at the gathering. But
young Australian-born Jews simply
cannot find a meaningful communion
with the majority of participants at
these commemorations. It is not sur-
prising that the older generation, which
underwent first-hand suffering, is unable
to communicate its attitudes to an Aus-
tralian-born Jewish generation.
The average young Australian Jew''
recognises the Nazi experience as a
terrible period in the recent history of
his people. Yet, for the older-genera-
tion Jew who personally survived Hit-
ler’s New Order, the Nazi experience
has become a basic part of his Jewish
identity. He will constantly be hauntec
by nightmares of the past. He is
hypersensitive to even the slightest
manifestation of Nazism, and often
demands unqualified condemnation o:
Germany and of all Germans for ever
He also considers it his sacred duty
to raise the nightmare of the past at
every possible occasion so that future
generations do not forget.
This is not to suggest that the
younger Australian-born Jewish genera-
tion is insensitive or indifferent to the
problem or even in favor of forgetting
or suppressing the whole nightmare.
Far from it. But it has a different
attitude probably tempered by not
having had direct personal experience.
They may avoid buying a Volkswagen
and share a general suspicion and
prejudice against Germans, but the
question of Germany as such is not
constantly uppermost in their mind.
Perhaps I can best illustrate this
attitude with my own personal approach
to this question. I was born in Belgium
but I was fortunate enough to have
been brought out to Australia at the
age of three before the outbreak of
the war. In most respects I have led a
normal enough life as an Australian.
But, like most Jews, I grew up in a
world where the shadow of Nazi
extermination loomed high. Like many
other Australian Jews, the bulk of my
family perished in Nazi death camps.
The Abyss
despite this, my whole educa-
tional orientation has always turned
me against anything smacking of racism
or nationalist xenophobia. I would be
the first to concede that 20 years have
passed and that a new generation is
emerging in Germany which cannot
be held responsible for the sins of its
parents. Unlike Ulbricht’s East German
regime, which is today pandering to
Arab extremists, Adenauer’s Germany
has attempted to make financial resti-
tution for those who survived the
Holocaust, and, without discounting
the remnants of Nazism in present-day
Germany, I recognise the genuine
efforts by many Germans to make up
for the past.
Despite the fact that there has been
considerable concern at the proposed
implementation of the Statute of Limi-
tations to incorporate Nazi war crimes
and although some war crime trials
held in Germany in recent years have
made a parody of justice by the
leniency of the sentences, this is only
part of the picture. By and large, the
German Press, radio, and television is
liberal and has been at the fore in. de-
nouncing the re-emergence of anti-
democratic forces. For a nation in which
individual guilt and involvement in
Nazism has been very great, war
crimes trials are still grinding on des-
pite understandable, if inexcusable, re-
sentment by the German public. If
West Germany has committed in-
credibly stupid blunders since it re-
cently commenced diplomatic relations
with Israel, on balance it must also bf*
conceded that the German Government
did avoid the temptations of “Real-
politik” and did not pander to black-
mail and economic threats from the
Arab Bloc.
But despite all this I am opposed to
any formalised acts of forgiveness or
reconciliation. Like most other Jews,
I do not consider myself as being in
a position to forgive and I am too close
to the event to forget. The day after
the German-Jewish dialogue, I joined
a group of delegates who left Brussels
for a 20-minute bus trip to Malines, the
deportation transit used by the Nazis
prior to the dispatch of Belgian Jews
to the death camps. My family per-
sonally went through this centre on the
road to their final extermination. They
were not combatants but had Been
scheduled for extermination by decree.
Now in what meaningful manner can
I or any other Jew of my generation
discuss such events with Germans?
What can a decent German be ex-
pected to express other than shame at
his immediate past? What sort of com-
munication can overcome the “abyss”?
There is none. Dr. Gerstenmaier rightly
pointed out that German-Jewish rela-
tions would not be reconciled by mani-
festations of philo-Semitism by some
Germans.
Dr. Gerstenmaier looks to a normal-
isation of relations. It is unlikely that
this will eventuate in the near future.
The traumas of guilt on the part of the
Germans and unspeakable suffering on
the part of the Jews cannot simply be
washed away. The dialogue between
Germans and Jews in Brussels con-
firmed that such a process cannot be
artificially inspired.
A complete normalisation of relations
between Germans and Jews is unthink-
able in the near future. However, given
the therapeutic impact of time and
the emergence of new generations of
Germans and Jews, it is probable that
the present relationship will be modi-
fied. The onus of responsibility for
bringing this about will rest primarily
on the New German generation. On
them will be placed the arduous burden
of facing up and not avoiding the past.
They will have to ensure that the
crimes of many of their parents will
not be expunged from German history
books but held up as examples of the
by-product of unfettered racism.


DISSENTERS
A Rejoinder to the New Reactionaries
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
LIKE most people—many of them,
it appears, correspondents to THE
BULLETIN letter, pages my
immediate instinct is to feel hostile to
those who are being nasty to me: and
after my recent article (or, rather, a
cut version of it) on Australia’s
magazines of Revolt-ion, Radicalism,
and Dissent (B. August 13) some people
have been very nasty indeed.
lan Marsh (B. August 27) thinks
me an “arrogant man” who “seems to
have no device except innuendo, with
which to vilify opponents.” That
widely published master of English
prose (see how the hot, sarcastic, spleen
rises up and out) John Hooker (B.
September 3) calls me “ambidextrous,”
“spleenish,” “facile,” assembling my
“ragbag of cliches” in “shoddy, slovenly
punctuated, and badly written political
journalism.”
Patricia Healy (B. September 3)
thinks I write “absolute tosh” to sup-
port “a shaky case.” Jan Cooper (B.
September 10), who scores extra marks
for prudence in that “I do hesitate
to reveal that I am a female” (never
mind, one of my best friends is female)
dislikes my “bias” and “hackneyed
cliche.” Then in today’s issue D. J.
Burke says I have “unreasonable and
illiberal attitudes” underneath my
“platitudinous generalisations.” And
the Communist “Tribune,” through the
agency of “R.M.” (No prize for guess-
ing who that is), has been a bit bitchy, •
too.
Surely the most arrogant, splenetic,
and illiberal spirit would bow before
the fury of such a storm of adjectives?
But, ah (perhaps Mr. Hooker will allow
a little prose licence), amidst a
thousand lawsuits in a faithless age
there is a comfort, a consolation: most
of the correspondent-critics are unable
to face the arguments which were
raised; and they also fail to read with
tolerable accuracy my simple, slovenly
prose.
Mr. Marsh says that the dissenters
“might wonder at (my) capacity to
denigrate the social problems which (I)
credit them with raising.” I wrote that
dissenters “on domestic issues. often
raise, even discover, important issues
and discuss them with intelligence and
authority: in education, migration,
social welfare, and security, economic
injustices, etc.” How does Mr. Marsh
get the verb “denigrate” out of all
that?
Mr. Hooker has the advantage over
Mr. Marsh, who may learn a salutory
lesson from the occasion: whereas Mr.
Marsh tries to say something and gets
it wrong, Mr. Hooker, in his usual
cleverly polished prose, says almost
nothing except that he doesn’t like me.
He also tells us he is a dissenter, he
stands left of centre, he rates Orwell
highly, he does not have an inherited
hatred of capitalism, he sees the need
for the military, and not only is he
not “a mindless drop-out,” but he does
not “keep their company.” (A slip in
the grammar of number here, but then,
which of us is perfect?)
The presumption here is that Mr.
Hooker has exhausted my list of dis-
senters and not found himself amongst
them, and so much for the kind of list
that excludes such a notable personage.
Mr. Hooker suffers from Mr. Marsh’s
trouble after all, for the list I gave was
much more extensive than his polemic
pretends. What about the liberal
Utopians forever dreaming of lands
just over the political rainbow, the
middle-class adolescents projecting their
revolt against the bourgeois standards
of their parents into the political
arena, the simple leftist ideologues
parading their substitute religious
creeds, the aesthetic revolutionaries re-
treating from admass and the society
which gave it birth, the Christians and
other humanitarians concerned for
social justice, the timorous petition-
signers and “New Statesman” readers
scared into conformity by loud-mouthed
Leftists of the campus and the oral pro-
fessions, and the tired old rump of the
Stalinist left? I feel sure that if Mr.
Hooker reads the list again he will
find himself adequately included.
GU D as I was to learn that Patricia
Healy shares my dislike for Coca-
Cola and my like for George Orwell
and LBJ, I cannot accept very much of
her defence of “Dissent.” I was on the
original editorial board of “Dissent”
when it emerged from the Melbourne
University ALP Club about six years
ago, calling itself a “radical quarterly.”
The magazine was democratically
Socialist and anti-Communist: the
temper was pragmatic, the bias def-
erentially Australian. On domestic
issues, as I said in my article, “Dis-
sent” has printed intelligent and well-
researched articles, and no one left
of the League of Rights would deny
that on many social and economic
issues “Dissent” has played a minor
but honorable role of exposure and
documentation. To a lesser extent
the same is true of “Arena,” “Out-
look,” “Comment,” “Melbourne Parti-
san,” “Overland,” etc. Nobody could
deny that the people who run them
are not concerned about social and
economic injustice in the Western
world and about economically assist-
ing poorer nations.
The mystery is that the publishers
of the dissenting magazines tumble
down into a sentimental heap when-
ever they are confronted with the
foreign-policy problems posed by Com-
munist China, the National Liberation
Fronts established by Peking and the
Indo-Chinese Communist Party, the
possibilities of a genuine rapproach-
ment with Russia (I do not deny the
possibility), Communist subversion in
Asia, Africa, and South America, and
the not infrequently vicious internal
and external policies of political
leaders of former colonial territories.
In these areas “Arena” is deliber-
ately prevaricating, “Outlook” i s
blinded by its compulsive anti-
Americanism, “Comment” adopts
adolescent moral poses (with an
innocuous hint of civil disobedience,
enough to warm the seeds of middle-
class revolt, but not sufficient to get
anyone into any trouble), “Melbourne
Partisan” was mainly ignorant, and
“Dissent,” I am sorry to say, is just
plain gutless.
It was easy enough for radicals to
decide where they stood in 1880 when
Gladstone overthrew Disraeli’s policy
and withdrew from Afghanistan, and
no harder to decide what liberal prin-
ciples demand in 1882 when Britain
moved into Egypt and finally became
embroiled in the Sudan and Khartoum.
It w'as easiest of all for radicals to
know their minds in 1899 when
Britain manoeuvred itself into a dirty
little expansionist war in South Africa.
The trouble is that English-speaking
radicals have been judging Western
foreign policy in the same way ever
since; in foreign policy the radicals
have become the reactionaries. They
cannot accommodate themselves to a
world in which power relations and
ideologies have turned inside out. Their
liberal heritage lies in struggles and
concepts of a pre-totalitarian age in
which Britain and a few other Western
countries were the major expanding
powers. So the radicals keep watching
and condemning western foreign policy
and military actions, and ignore or
turn their eyes from the depredations
of the Communists and the new emerg-
ing forces. Senator Fulbright con-
stantly warns of the danger of power
brimming over to arrogance, but he
cannot face the fact that the alternative
to use of Western power is capitulation
to totalitarian terror. It is a kind of
arrogance to say, like Professor Gal-
braith, that if America were not in-
volved in Vietnam the area could
return to “richly deserved obscurity.”
International politics demands using
one’s strength to limit the selfish and
disruptive ambitions of other States.
Nineteenth-century radicals understood
those terms; they are what radicalism
is all about. Right now this points,
above all, to China. The periphery of
China has emerged from obscurity. I
am afraid our radicals and dissenters
have not.

My main concern is the kind of future they can expect. I want them free to choose the
profession that suits them . . . not forced to take just any job. And I want security and
prosperity for them.
Well, that is the kind of life Ampol is helping to build. Its earnings stay in Australia and
are spent on developing Australia, on making us a stronger, richer nation . . . because

THE POST-GRADUATE Committee
in Medicine of the University of
Adelaide is holding a seminar on “The
Unmarried Mother and Child Adop-
tion.” The program carries the uni-
versity crest and an advertisement for
an oral contraceptive.
Children's Hour
NEXT CASUALTY in ABC tele-
vision’s struggle to move up the rating-
charts will be children’s programs.
From October 3 there will be a major
reconstruction of television programs
from 3.30 p.m. through to the 7 p.m.
news.
Gone will be “Wonderbox,” “Story-
book,” and “Roundabout.” The ABC
hopes to find a niche for these some-
where in the quiet backwaters of Sun-
day, to which their loyal, but small,
band of followers will presumably fol-
low them. The ABC hopes to get over
what it calls “the 5 p.m. block.” Until
now it has not been transmitting be-
tween 3.30 p.m. and five. The basic
idea is to build up audiences which
will carry through to the evening pro-
grams.
Children’s programs will not be so
definitely aimed at age groups. The
ABC has found that the younger age
group, at which most of its efforts,
have been aimed, is, in fact, “im-
bedded” in the larger audiences for
older programs. This translated into
everyday language means that small
children will watch programs for older
children or for adults if they are given
half a chance.
The ABC is prepared for some criti-
cism of these moves, but it might well
ask its critics: If the ABC is supposed
to cater for minority audiences, just
what is a minority? Some of the ABC
children’s programs had audiences so
that they remained, in the jargon
of statisticians, “undetected” in surveys.
At its highest, ABC television between
5 p.m. and 6 p.m. has rarely gained
more than 20,000 homes in Sydney and
Melbourne out of a total of 600,000
homes. This is an audience of less than
four percent of possible. (By contrast,
ABC children’s radio has been both
highly regarded by educationists and
popular, if not spectacularly so, with
children, and remains so.)
Some of the programs to be trans-
mitted between 3.30 p.m. and 5 p.m.
are wholly or in part replays of
“Lassie,” “Mr. Ed,” “Dr. Who,” and
“The Magic Boomerang.” “As nobody
watched them the first time, we can
safely replay them,” an ABC spokes-
man, wiser after surveys than he was
before, said. Although the ABC may
no longer be looked for children's pro-
grams which lay claim to be “posi-
tively good,” it still feels that it has
nothing “positively bad.” “If horror
television turns children into little hor-
rors,” the spokesman said, “none of
our programs will do that.”
The changeover has nothing to do
with new stipulations for Australian
content in prime-time television and
was planned long before the stipula-
tions were announced. The ABC will
probably be presenting more Australian
material for children when the older-
established programs are transferred to
Sunday and new programs, such as
“Be Our Guest” and “Crackerjack,”
are presented in the early evening.
The ABC is now more or less pre-
pared to admit that what it thought
children wanted to watch is not what
children will watch. But surveys car-
ried out for the ABC show that parents
are just as much astray as the ABC
programmers on children’s tastes.
This changeover is probably the final
demise of the sort of program which
serious-minded people thought of as
desirable children’s television and which
experience has shown serves no particn.
lar purpose. What does it matter how
elevated and worth while a program is
if no one is watching it? And why
should the ABC take on the job of
both parent and school?
Slow Motion
FROM THE OUTSIDE- the building
from which Sydney is cleansed, num-
bered, planned, paved, and approved
show's a quaint contrast between its
Victorian style and the newness of its
aluminium window-frames. Inside,
however, the decor is unflinchingly
Early Public Service.
A wide marble stairway curves
around an ancient lift-well reminiscent
of those contraptions which carried
food down into the Valley of the
Lepers in biblical times. On the walls
of the upstairs committee room—a not
inelegant chamber originally—there
hangs a pictorial roll of honor com-
memorating the 1963 visit of the Queen
to Sydney. It has the appearance of
having been designed in 1903.
The committee meeting itself is more
lively, at first glance. Someone is talk-
ing about “this great city of ours.”
One hears the phrase “design co-
ordination of street furniture,” which
evokes more frightening images than it
need.
One alderman is talking about
something he calls “beautification.” The
others listen, apparently fascinated. He
mentions the words “tree” and “grass.”
A good-sized poplar could have risen
beside his chair since he first started
flogging that hobby-horse. He is smil-
ing, and why not? He lives in the
suburbs,
The first shock comes when one
realises that some of these matters
have been under discussion for up to
three years, or at least under words.
A complex structure of sub-committees
ensures that each matter can be well
and truly chewed over almost in-
definitely, until its emasculated re-
mains may be implemented by the only
body having any actual power at all,
the full Council.
Outside, Sydney’s busiest intersection
wallows in the grip of a set of traffic
signals that would bring blushes and
amazement in Toyko or London. It
could do badly with a network of
pedestrian tunnels or overwalks, this
city. The last tunnel built by the Coun-
cil was to the Woolloomooloo car park
some years ago. Soon, someone will
suggest a new one to a sub-committee,
which will recommend a mutilated
version of it for “action” by the Coun-
cil’s officers, who will . . . and so it
goes on. The Council’s time is un-
limited, unlike that of the drivers out-
side.
So, apparently, is the eloquence of
the aldermen. At any rate, it flows
faster than the cars outside these
soundproofed aluminium windows.
Perhaps, to get some action, Sydney s
long-patient motorists and pedestrians
plight make up a delegation to visit a

Loss of Power
REACTION of contemporary artis
and students in this field to the an
nouncement that Mr. Gordon Thon
son, deputy director of the Victoria
National Gallery, has been offered th
post of curator of the Power Galler
of Contemporary Art at Sydney Un
versity has on occasion been “Who?
What Mr. Thomson’s job will be
should he accept the appointment,
somewhat imprecise and perhaps no
enviable, judging by the terms in whic
the Vice-Chancellor of Sydney Univer
sity, Sir Stephen-Roberts, set it out a
a Press conference last week. Si
Stephen said Mr. Thomson was th
only person offered the job and woulc
not specify how many people had ap
plied. He did add, however, and some
what gratuitously one would think, tha
some local applicants “had no calim
at all except in their own minds.”
The offer to Mr. Thomson is th
first definite move the University
Senate has made in 4| years to put into
effect the provision of the will of Di
John Wardell Power. Yet to come ii
the Power contemporary art complex
are the Professor of Contemporary Ar
and the research librarian. Sir Stephen
said experts in contemporary art were
“as scarce as hens’ teeth.”
In spite of this unpromising situation
Sir Stephen expects to have a suitable
head of the department by the end o:
the year. In the meantime, the new
curator will be busy. The Power estate
left to the University, is in the form
of 194,550 shares (and possibly more]
in the MLC life assurance company.
The value of these has been sliced from
$3 million to only $1.6 million by the
failure of its subsidiary, the H. G
Palmer group, and Sir Stephen saic
no sale of shares will be effected until
prices recover. This means, he ad-
mitted, that the new' curator will have
no gallery in which to display his pur-
chases of contemporary art until that
happy day. However, Sir Stephen said,
there were “plenty of places” in the
University to display art, and the Uni-
versity would be able to have “more
exhibitions than it wanted.”
However, the new curator can begin
his buying trips soon after his appoint-
ment. There is, as a result of the 4-|-
years’ delay, a sum of $287,614 in
kitty. The annual income is $61,606.
From this must be deducted salaries—
the professor’s will be $10,400, the
curator’s $B6O0 —and travelling ex-
penses. So the curator may have some-
thing less than $30,000 a year for pur-
chases.
Even if the curator goes off with
the $287,614 accrued income, he will
hnd that Impressionist paintings, or
anything which would build up a gal-
ery showing the beginnings and de-
velopment of the modern movement,
!V°uld be right out of his price range.
He could, a local expert said, buy
cleverly and well among the younger
American and European artists at
prices below $5OOO, with the risk
and the risk will always be there with
contemporary art that they may ap-
preciate in value or may slump heavily.
Whatever the curator buys, the pro-
fessor, when he appears, will have to
build his academic courses around
what is in the gallery for the whole
thing to have any coherence at all. Sir
Stephen expects the head of the depart-
ment and the curator to work together
happily. We hope they do, too.
The Letters of Trevor Gooseboot
Dear Mother, (Intercepted by Will Rushton)
. 1 received a most disturbing letter from sister Elsie saying that you had been
picketing the Commonwealth Prime Minister’s Conference with placards reading
Australia must act and Smithy for King.” Not only, Mother, is this in direct
opposition to Dr. Pearson’s advice—“No undue excitement until the Conservatives
aie leturned to Office and God is once more in His Heaven”—but it could, were
they to learn of our relationship, land me right in it with the Immigration people
heie. I know you have never had much truck with our colored brethren since that
unfoi unate business with the bus conductor from Barbados, but you must learn
to live and let live.
Here, of course, there is no such problem. You are welcome whatever your color,
class, or creed unless it is black, brown, yellow, working, or “I believe in Mrs.
Jones the all-Australian lady who’s damfool enough to like margarine!” (That’s
not entirely fair as Wes Hall is allowed in during the cricket season.)
I don’t think they are fully geared here for wholehearted integration. The term
“wog,” for instance, which, as well you know from your enormous graffiti in
Leicester Square, is in England abusive. In Australia it refers to “La Grippe.”
There are signs of reform in the White Australia policy. A few Asians are being
let in which shows that the Christian spirit is yet alive in the Antipodes. “Love
thy neighbor” as the Good Book says “and thy trade boometh.”
I think I’ve got a job with J. C. Williamson’s, the theatrical impresarios. It’s
either as a stage-hand or managing director. But more of that next week.
Do be careful with yourself, Mother. Try to think in the past.
Your loving son,
Trevor.


THE PROBE PEOPLE
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“rTlHE trouble is, it’s an inverse ice-
' berg. Everything you see is all
there is.” Bob Moore, serious
and acute producer of the ABC’s
“Four Corners,” was talking about the
fact that TV programs of this kind
have not enough deep research and
preparation and thinking behind them:
circumstances —lack of money and staff
(he might have added in the ABC’s case
official pressure)—prevent them from
being more than what they are: super-
ficial, fixed permanently on the sur-
face of things . . . merely visual maga-
zines containing high-powered features
intended to stimulate and excite; they
offer no dynamic statements worth
talking about; they lack point or drive.
“Four Corners,” of course, started out
with notable ambitions; initially, under
Michael Charlton and Bob Raymond
and later under Gerald Lyons and Allan
Ashbolt, it strove at times to- present,
without much imagination or flair but
with a certain amount of nerve and the
beginnings of intelligence, some flaws in
Australian society. These programs also
suffered from superficiality and lack of
research facilities, but at least they went
out on a limb. The RSL was shown in
unflattering colors; Australian housing
came in for a drubbing. But the RSL
fought back. The late Senator Spooner,
after refusing to appear on the housing
program in his position as Minister for
National Development, insisted on ob-
taining air time later to state, sten-
toriously, his case away from any prob-
ings interviewer; and other programs
were scotched altogether by the powers-
that-be. The Four Corners team was not
allowed to cover the takeover by Indo-
nesia of Dutch New Guinea; a pro-
jected survey of the Orr case was can-
celled; and later there was the
notorious incident of the program on
the Fremantle hanging of Edgar
Cooke, postponed after the Liberal
Premier of Western Australia, David
Brand, demanded it be withdrawn.
Allan Ashbolt, the executive producer,
was “kicked upstairs”; John Power, the
producer, and John Penlington, one of
the reporters, were fired, too, and
gagged. The shadow of this has, one
feels, been hanging over Public Affairs
men on the ABC ever since.
After this official degutting, “Four
Corners” might have closed up shop,
but following a recess it managed to
collect itself and revive again. John
Penlington was reinstated, with Brett
Porter as producer. From then on, with
various staff changes, the program has
been, with exceptions such as its expos-
ure of the Nazi Party and the two-
airlines controversy, very carefully
balanced, presenting both sides of every
case. The Philippines elections provided
one suitably remote and safe topic; a
close-up of a revivalist meeting was
sufficiently “colorful,” while giving little
offence; and even an attack on the
Liberal Party was lacking in detail
and bite. While the old regime was
superficial but polemical, the new
regime strives for a mature, detached,
and balanced approach, which, in its
avoidance of idiosyncracy, risks becom-
ing blandly innocuous.
Today, Bob Moore is the producer,
with John Penlington, Dick Oxenburgh,
Bill Peach, and Frank Bennett on his
staff. Penlington began as a cadet
journalist before becoming a talks
trainee; Frank Bennett was a journalist
and radio announcer; Bill Peach was
a schoolteacher and talks trainee be-
fore coming to the program via Channel
10’s “Telescope”; Dick Oxenburgh was
an actor, milkman, and radio man.
Moore, a graduate of Adelaide Uni-
versity, also took a Bachelor of Philo-
sophy degree in politics at Oxford. He
then worked for the BBC, and
Research Assistant to Hugh Burnett,
producer of John Freeman’s famous
interview program “Face to Face.” For
that program, Moore said, preparations
were made weeks ahead: a special re-
search assistant and another assistant
worked with Moore on the assembling
of dossiers of prospective interviewees;
and by the time Freeman was ready to
interview someone he was fully
familiar with every possible aspect
of their career. Later, on “Panorama,”
the BBC’s documentary-type program,
the producer would go out to the subject
—say an industrial town—and spend
weeks on the spot interviewing pros-
pects; once again very full dossiers were
prepared.
Back in Australia, Bob Moore found
that this kind of detailed preparation
was unheard of. It was impossible for
him to make long-term plans in the
way that the BBC had planned “Pano-
rama.” Sufficient money and staff
simply have not been placed at his
disposal. He had only one research
assistant and the ABC’s library did not
compare with the BBC’s. Frequently
the necessary facts weren’t available
under the ABC’s roof. Rushed and
harassed, Moore had to use scattered
time through the week for groundwork
on a future subject, while working on
the present one. He has only two units
-—if, while he is working on one seg-
ment, he hears of a possible new subject
that might make news he can’t pull a
unit off the story it is shooting be-
cause he might ruin a perfectly good
subject to capture one that might not
turn out to be satisfactory. At the
BBC, a producer would simply call up
an extra unit; if the story turned out
to be no good, only the time of that
extra movable unit would have been
lost, and the other segments would
still have been filmed.
Much the same problem dogs ATN’s
“Seven Days,” which began as a pro-
gram for John 'Pringle, who later be-
came editor of the Canberra Times
and the Sydney Morning Herald.
Peter Westerway, head of the
station’s public affairs department and
producer of the show, works with
limited equipment and limited facilities.
Peter Westerway said that he had
organised the program’s shooting on
the basis of a chart; but, although he
obviously didn’t want to air any com-
plaints, it was easy to sense that he
is in his own way as cramped as Bob
Moore. Despite these restrictions, the
program had brought off some coups:
a sharp close-up of Gough Whitlam,
Richard Croll’s famous interview with
Menzies.
A political science graduate and later
lecturer in Government and Public
Administration, with some freelance
journalistic experience, Westerway has
the kind of organising ability to plan
on limited money up to six programs
ahead. But didn’t he feel the financial
restrictions of making such shows? “Its
a basic fact of life that programs like
this lose money. We are lucky if we
ever get a 20 rating. We are certainly
never going to get a 30 or 40 rating,
like feature films.”
Tanya Halesworth brushed aside any
suggestions that she was constrained
by budget or other considerations; on
Channel 10’s “Telescope” in Sydney,
she sails through nunnery, plastic-
surgery theatre, homosexual bar, or
prostitute - haunted street without
turning a well-groomed hair. Cool and
tough, she isn’t fazed by tight schedules
or short budgets; strict editing of the
material pulls her through. She had


Interviewing the
TV Interviewers
been hired by Channel 10 in England,
where she had hostessed a children’s
program for Granada, after several
years as the ABC’s most celebrated
announcer and a spell as student and
actress.
She had no fancy notions about plan-
ning subjects well ahead or doing depth
research on them. “One morning, I’ll
think, ‘Let’s do prostitutes today.’ And
I do.” Were the interviews sketched
out in her mind in advance? “Oh, no,
I don’t think about it. I work off the
cuff —I work by instinct.”
The formats of “Four Corners,”
“Seven Days,” and “Telescope” are
similar. (Robert Raymond’s “Project
’66,” essentially a documentary rather
than an interview program, begins in a
different category altogether.) Once
a newsy subject is decided upon, highly
charged interviews are shot, and the
ends are neatly tied up —with none of
us any more informed about the inter-
viewer’s viewpoint than when we
started. The effect is like reading a pic-
ture magazine: a few shocks, a few
touches of humor, and then into the
barber’s seat. Abortion, unmarried
mothers, drugs, drunken driving, cos-
metic surgery, homosexuality, all are
typical subjects, picked up, wrung dry,
and dropped. They stimulate and move,
but their presenters seem far from
intent on bringing about social reforms.
I asked Tanya Halesworth why she
didn’t come out and make statements:
that homosexuals, say, should have a
better deal or that enclosed orders of
nuns might not be the best thing for
certain personalities. “Oh, no, that
idea’s shocking. I just w'ant to present
a subject, that’s all.”
“Presenting a subject” was all those
solo interview programs-—Bob Sanders’
“People” in Sydney and Gerald Lyons’
“People” in Melbourne did, too.
Sanders’ long-running program (since
the beginning of television) seems to
be based on the idea that a perfectly
ordinary man was talking to people in
his living-room, and was overheard. It
is produced by Hudson Faussett, an
American once with NBC in America,
a former Hollyw'ood actor (“Women in
the Wind,” “Tomorrow’s Headlines”),
and producer-director of the cele-
brated color-TV “Macbeth,” with
Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson.
Faussett complained of insufficient re-
hearsal time, or none at all, and a
lack of the kind of technical resources
which could insure smooth transitions;
crew members were not exclusively
engaged for the program, but were
working on others. He hoped to iron
this problem out shortly. Sanders said
there were as many technicians on
“People” as there would be in a similar
BBC production; but again he pointed
out that they weren’t exclusive to the
show—or at least to the Talks Depart-
ment—as they should be.
Perhaps because of this weakness on
the technical side, the technique of
“People” is rough and the approach
pretty fundamental. Sanders said: “We
have three or four interviews in half an
hour. It takes me two and a half
minutes to establish a character, two
minutes to get their views on a subject
across, and a half minute to get them
off. I’ll say ‘goodbye’ and they w'on’t
go and I’ll say ‘goodbye’ again and
they still won’t go.”
What about critics who said Sanders
was too much the ordinary man, not
sufficiently probing, profound, or in-
formed in his interviewing? “Well, it’s
a question of people seeing the pro-
gram at different levels. To the ABC
it’s a light program. To the public it’s
a heavy one already. The critics want
to make it heavier. But it is a question
for me of how' far you can go beyond
your audience. The public already
thinks we are intellectually stimulat-
ing. The critics are a bit out of touch
with the audience. I must keep bear-
ing in mind the point that I might
start leaving the audience behind. I’ve
got to bring the interview back to the
understanding of the audience.”
Technically speaking, weren’t there,
during an interview', too many shots
of Sanders? “No, only three.” Three
an interview' surely? “No, no, wait a
minute I’ll ask Hudson Faussett . . .
bloody Higham, .you’re right.”
How closely did the ABC vet his
lists of guests for the occasional
“dangerous” or “outspoken” individual
w'ho might ruffle its cosy calm? “A
reference officer, usually Allan Ash-
bolt.” Usually? “Well, ahvays he might
wander in and have a look at the list
of guests.” Every week? Or how often?
“Well . . . you can say he does a spot
check.”
Sanders had only once clashed head
on with the ABC: over the late Lenny
Bruce. The comedian had been re-
jected by the ABC as a subject for
“People” and Sanders had declared
that if Bruce didn’t go on the air he
wouldn’t go on either. But Sanders
had gone on without Bruce. Why?
“Well, you know how it is. You get
on a charger and start galloping. Then
comes the day and you think—what’s
going to be solved by acting this
w'ay?”
Gerald Lyons had evidently got off

" You're despicable, degenerate, perverted J,
repulsive, and I want you on my program.
. . on the other hand
you're treading on my foot!"
"Tonight we take a look at

largely despised section of

his charger and stopped galloping a
long time ago, too. Edgy, in a crumpled
blue suit at the interview before dash-
ing off to a “Celebrity Game” luncheon
at Melbourne’s Southern Cross Hotel,
he had not been much heard of since
as announcer and editor of “Four
Corners” he had been embroiled in the
sometime famous fiasco of the RSL
inquiry and had been fired from the
program. Before joining the ABC he
had been a freelance writer in India
and Hong Kong and had been on the
Reuters-AAP desk in Sydney—of which
he rapidly tired, although he said it
had given him a healthy respect for
facts. What was the point of his
“People”? “Just to get back to the
close-up ... to what is the most exci-
ting thing in the world, the human
face.” Sanders’ “Peopi’e,” he thought,
was a lighter program than his. Lyons
didn’t, did he, attempt a Freeman-like
turning inside out of a personality?
“That would be ludicrous in short seg-
ments. It can’t be done. But I do try
to look for inconsistencies to seize on.”
“PEOPLE” is preceded by a whistled
“River Kwai” theme and the
camera dollies in to Lyons at a desk.
The camera stays focused on the inter-
viewee’s face in very long takes, with
the minimum of reaction shots. Lyons
has a technique of introducing each
interview rather professorially with an
account of the subject; then he
settles down to talk to the interviewee
as though asking for references. There
are no long shots, lighting effects, or
elaborate transitions as on Sanders’
program.
Channel 9’s Tony Charlton, brother
of Michael Charlton and, together with
Lyons, the best-known Melbourne inter-
viewer, appears in a wide range of
programs, of which the most outlandish
is “The Big Game.” Against a score-
board to a background of wild watusi,
a frantic go-go girl whirls flags and
streamers as Charlton, clad in an open-
necked shirt and football shorts, asks
moronic footballers questions between
announcing the latest scores (Samples:
“What is the day of the year when
people get romantic and send each other
cards?” “Armistice Day.” “When you
unscramble the letters SESEDNNO you
get the name of a famous football team.
What is it?” “Geelong”). The look
on the players’ faces when asked ques-
tions like “Tolstoy was a famous
novelist who wrote a book called ‘War
and Peace.’ What nationality was he?”
makes a charming picture.
For Tony Charlton, Bob Sanders, and
Gerald Lyons, there are constant and
worrying problems. Frequently, stars
or politicians or other foreign notables
are in town only for a day or two, and
can’t be grabbed easily for interview.
As Sanders and Lyons pointed out,
neither has a small unit exclusively to
his program: a deficiency which, in
addition to the rushed rehearsals or
total lack of rehearsals, gives their work
a far from polished look (although
Lyons’ show is smoother and simpler,
eschewing showy effects). This surely
is an area in which the ABC could
brush up its organisations and add an
expert researcher or two to these inter-
viewers’ staffs, giving Lyons secretarial
help, and ensuring that both men have
a permanent production team not to be
used by others.
It is perhaps unfair to demand that
the Probe People should make politi-
cal statements or attack major social
flaws on their programs, although one
would like to see more Freeman or
Day or even “Monitor -like probing:
the tone is far too genial and super-
ficial and consoling at present. The
final disappointment, after seeing all
the people on the field, was that “Seven
Days” and “Telescope didn t crusade.
Tanya Halesworth wasn’t having any
such suggestion; Richard Croll, chief
interviewer on Peter Westerway’s
“Seven Days,” felt that he wasn’t suf-
ficiently qualified to campaign: he had
briefly studied law, had worked in
country radio, and felt he was no more
than a reporter (“I don’t think a re-
porter should crusade, do you?”). I did,
as it happened, and Peter Westerway
certainly is qualified. Why didn t he,
after presenting both sides of some
burning political issue, go ahead and
say such-and-such a person was wrong
or such-and-such an institution was
bad? Well, in the first place, he said,
because he didn’t want to be associ-
ated with any specific point of view
politically. “I am just as delighted if
someone calls me a Menzies stooge as
I am if they say I am a red-hot Com-
munist. I try to present both sides of
every question.” But couldn t he go
beyond that after presenting every side
and say something crusading? “No,
because it is there unofficially as a
convention that you can’t. The Broad-
casting Control Board takes a very dim
point of view of such things. Every
time your licence comes up for review
there is a questionnaire. They ask you
how you presented your case on a poli-
tical program. I have been made to
understand that it is very much the
philosophy of the management, which
makes a specific distinction between
newspapers and TV, not to make poli-
tical statements at the end of such
programs.”
I asked Myles Wright, suave, grey,
sharply intelligent chairman of the
Broadcasting Control Board, what he
thought about Westerway’s remarks. In
the first place, he denied that any such
questions about political programs and
their bias were put to stations in annual
questionnaires. Wright was, in fact,
severely critical of the failure of TV
commentators in Australia generally to
make political statements or denounce
social wrongs in their programs. What
about the excuses given, e.g., that the
board might take a dim view of poli-
ticking* at the time the licence came
up for consideration? “These are
simply excuses. These interviewers in
Australia are only trying to disguise
their pusillanimity behind a smoke-
screen. The idea that licences might
be'in jeopardy if they make political
capital out of some issue is a realm of
the purest fantasy. At election time,
of course, all parties must be allowed
an opportunity to state their case. But
at other times there are no restrictions
on politically slanted programs.”
What he did think was that, by con-
trast with Britain, there was a shortage
of good and well-informed polemical
interviewers in Australia.
What about the notorious policing
of public affairs programs by the
board? This was done, Wright said,
not on any political ground but to
ensure that a program on, say, nudists
or homosexuals was not simply crude
or sensationalist but was in the public
interest. What form did the policing
take? “We have monitors to do that.”
Who are they? “Members of this office.
No, not specially recruited as a rule,
but public servants who have been with
this office from the beginning. They
make out a detailed report on specific
programs. Obviously with our limited
resources we can’t see every program.
But the monitors do watch certain pro-
grams. Their very full report goes to
our program officers.”
Obviously, then, any public-affairs
program producer must watch his
sociological Ps and Qs. But equally
clearly no public affairs man can now
claim that there is any danger of the
station’s licence in his becoming a
crusader on television. Whether this
fact will make any difference to the
situation remains to be seen.
Is it too much to hope?

ON THE MARGIN
Please Be My Guest
IF you are a per-
son of any
eminence today,
it is desirable that
you should be able
and willing to give
interviews. Not
only newspapers
and magazines but
radio and television
stations will want
to talk to you. This
is especially the
case if you happen to be a visitor from
foreign parts.
In Sydney, any famous economist or
flautist or obstetrician is apt to face
searching questions from Bob Sanders,
Andrea, Eric Baume, and Tanya
Halesworth. A distinguished acrobat or
baritone or puppeteer may be quizzed
in quick succession on the Don Lane
show, “The Barry Crocker Show,”
“Beauty and the Beast,” etc.
The system imposes on celebrities
special demands above and beyond
their professional skill. A good sur-
geon or ballerina or statistician is not
necessarily a good talker as well. I
remember the difficulty interviewers
had in eliciting replies from Ella Fitz-
gerald a lady Who, though pre-
eminent in her chosen field, is not
markedly fluent in conversation.
As that occasion illustrated, the in-
terviewing business makes demands on
the people who ask the questions, too.
Years ago I was an obscure TV inter-
viewer -if there is such a thing
and I found that the job, while fun at
times, involved certain problems.
Some of the persons questioned were
too articulate by the time a Cabinet
Minister had finished talking, I would
forget what I had asked him. One or
two subjects notably the comedian
Victor Borge were smart guys, in-
tent on making the questioner look
silly. The most alarming subjects of
all were the reticent ones who uttered
laconic answers. A TV interviewer’s
nightmare is to be questioning a strong
silent man.
Important persons, by and large,
are adjusting themselves to modern
conditions. We are growing used to
chatty generals, reminiscent statesmen
voluble architects. Yet, in looking back
over past, pre-electronic eras, one notes
that fame and talent were not always
allied to loquacity. William the Silent
for example, would probably have been
an unsatisfactory guest on the Graham
Kennedy show. Oliver Cromwell used
to rapping out terse orders like
“Take away that bauble!” would have
been out of his element in the com-
pany of Dita and Buzz.
This line of thinking was prompted
when I read an article on Calvin Cool-
idge, the most taciturn of America’s
Presidents. Coolidge was an interest-
ing character with an ultra-concise
brand of humor. A worhan at a dinner
party said to him: “Mr. Coolidge, I
have made a bet that I can get you to
say three words.” He replied: “You
lose.” In the 1920 s it was still possible
to base a successful career on a reputa-
tion for saying hardly anything. But
how would Silent Cal have made out
in the communicative world of today?
On a visit to Australia, he would
at least have been a challenge to the
professional interrogators. The young
men from “Four Corners” would
doubtless have first try at him:
“Mr. Coolidge, do you think the
present growth-rate of the U.S.
economy is likely to continue?”
“Maybe.” . . .
has the next go: “Mums
and Dads, I have here today that
great American, Mr. Calvin Coolidge.
The first time I met you, Mr. Coolidge,
was at Cecil B. De Mille’s place in
Hollywood. Remember those parties he
used to give?”
“No.” . . .
After some pithy remarks to the
Beauties as guest Beast, a few incisive
words to Bob Sanders, Don Lane, and
Hazel Phillips, and a minute’s silence
on “Seven Days,” the ex-President gives
a controversial interview on “Tele-
scope”:
“Mr. Coolidge, is it true that you are
heterosexual?”
“Yes.”
“Do you know many other hetero-
sexual people in the United States?”
“Yes.”
“Are they exposed to any social
ostracism?”
“No.” . . .
“Do you think this indicates a grow-
ing spirit of tolerance in the American
way of life?”
“Could be.” . . .
Quizzing Cal would be uphill work.
But luckily they don’t make them like
that any more. The celebrities play ball.
As each one packs for his trip to Aus-
tralia, his wife says: “Now, have you
got your replies ready for Barry, and
Bob, and Dita, and Eric, and Anne, and
Graham, and Tanya, and Don, and
John, and . .

With a Grain of Salt
Graham Kerr ... cheese with television.
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
I WAS on a diet the day I called
on Graham Kerr and therefore
unappreciative of the cookery
demonstration being televised in his
wrought-iron kitchen. Mr. Kerr’s hair
was fairer and face fatter, otherwise
his image was the same as we last saw'
on the box, jolly and relaxed except
for one brief moment w'hen he asked
'guest cook Sue Du Val if she liked his
steak and she replied No.
What with this sort of thing and
various other interests, including the
running of food companies, a food
school, and the writing of food books,
Mr. Kerr puts in about 60 hours a
week. He doesn’t know' to the nearest
$lO,OOO how much he earns, but Harry
Miller, his manager, gets 40 percent
of it.
Mr. Kerr (as in hair) lives in a
rented flat at Bondi, the decor of which
was not exactly restrained. I was
relieved to hear the mock flock, sunken
pools, king-size circular bed, and other
Hollywood paraphernalia were not to
his taste, either. He is looking for a
place of his own near the water that
is rather more cosy.
The 32-year-old Scotsman, dressed in
suitable leisure-wear, rattled on for a
couple of hours about his experiences
in the British Army, the 17 questions
asked in Parliament about his func-
tions therein, his marriage to childhood
playmate Treena van Doom, his climb
in the hotel world, and five-year stint
in the New Zealand Air Force as cater-
ing officer, culminating with his debut
on New Zealand television.
However, what I had really come to
find out was w'hat this thing was that
everybody feels about Graham Kerr but
nobody says. Well, I didn’t find any
hidden depths. Unless you count being
an esoteric Buddhist, which he used to
put on forms inquiring into his religion
but now leaves blank. Or his aptitude
(past) at sport, w'hich did surprise me
somewhat. Rugger with the English
Wasps, cricket for Sussex, British Army
(Western Command) foil and sabre
champion, winner of the Uffa Fox 1947
Cup for Redwings, a very good (he
says) squash player, and his ability to
run the 100 yards in ten seconds. I
noted, too, that Mr. Kerr’s activities
have a habit of turning into lists. He
did have cold eyes, now I come to
think of it, but if my manager was
taking 40 percent I probably would,
too.
fS TO ; My reaction to Mr. Kerr was
favorable. I tend to come out on
the side of anyone willing to break
down Australian obsession with overseas
goods in preference of their own, and
his efforts to promote Australian
national cuisine will, one hopes, be
fruitful. His idea is something a bit
more haute than eggs and bacon, but
not as haute as coq au vin. Why copy
foreign dishes all the time? Why not
think for ourselves and use what’s avail-
able here? Fried steak in tomato sauce,
for instance. After eight years of hard
flogging in New Zealand, he reckons
he’s converted 2000 people to the idea
of creating dishes of their own.
His own eating habits are pretty
simple. A couple of boiled eggs for
breakfast, eaten before cornflakes, which
he says is logical unless the poor cook
(his wife) has to hover round the stove
all the time, no lunch, and an evening
meal of one course plus a plate of
cheese the Kerrs nibble while watching
television. He entertains solely for “good
conversation,” of which he is presum-
ably deprived while doing his own slog-
ging at the stove. I also noted, en
passant, Mr. Kerr’s passion for mint
chocolates.
Anyway, there he is in this hideous
flat testing recipes with the aid of one
assistant, Barbara Small, who is a
Cordon Bleu. Mr. Kerr is not. She gets
the stuff out in readiness for her em-
ployer to perform. And, yes, he glugs,
splashes, sloshes exactly as he does on
the box. He wishes his critics would
realise that what they see is the real
him, not an inverted snob in a “House
and Gardens” kitchen. And as for say-
ing his recipes are too complicated,
well, compared to haute cuisine they’re
a walkover. His one aim is to get the
same effect with less trouble. Criticism
used to worry him and he got out of
breath, but now. he realises that any
reaction, even violent dislike, is better
than none.
Mr. Kerr plans to eat his way round
the world next year in the company, he
hopes, of 31 ladies. He hasn’t got
them yet and insists on vetting them
first. It will cost a packet. Any offers?


A Science-Fiction Week in Athletics
Women “ trying to dance in chains”
From CHRISTOP HER BRASHER in Budapest
WHEN another woman athlete,
Rumania’s world champion
high jumper Ilanda Balas,
failed to compete here, it was the
climax of an astounding week. Like a
number of other women competitors
here, she declined to attend the medi-
cal examination now required by the
organising committee to determine the
sex of competitors in the women’s
events. She said that trouble with a leg
muscle had obliged her withdrawal
from her event.
Miss Balas has held the record since
1958, and no other girl has come near
to equalling her.
I came here to report the eighth
European athletic championships, but
the events in the stadium have not
only been of an indifferent standard
but have seemed unimportant, and far
less fascinating than the happenings in
the athletes’ village and the rumors
and facts that have been floating about
in the restaurants and nightclubs of
Budapest.
The problem of sexing athletes is
not new. At the first European cham-
pionships in Vienna in 1938, Dora Rat-
jen, of Germany, won the women’s
high jump with a world record leap
of sft. 7in. A few days later the Ger-
man Athletic Federation announced
that Fraulein Ratjen “has no right to
participate in women’s competition.”
Her world record was taken away
from her and reverted to Mrs. Dorothy
Tyler (then Miss Odam), and the
European title was given to the Hun-
garian girl who had come second.
“Dora” Ratjen is now a Hamburg
waiter named Hermann.
This is not the first such case. My
colleague, Norris McWhirter, knows
offhand of cases involving English,
Dutch, French, and Russian “girls,”
and says he could find more if he had
his record books with him.
Nobody who’s been in athletics for
long is surprised that the whole subject
has now come into the open as the
result of the authorities’ insistence on
a check of all the women athletes.
M EN are better athletes than women.
A woman athlete is, as one doctor
put it to me, “trying to dance in chains.
She has a wide pelvis, more fat than
a man, and the disadvantages of breasts
flopping about. Obviously, the nearer
she is to a man the better she will be.”
But what is more surprising is that,
medically, “there is no definite line be-
tween male and female.” I am quoting
a doctor with considerable experience
of such matters.
The athletics authorities, the men
who make the rules under which these
championships are held, have been beg-
ging the doctors to define the difference
between men and women, but this is
not as easy as it sounds to a layman.
This is why the doctors insist on having
a panel, rather like a jury, at the medi-
cal examination.
Medically, it is a highly complicated
subject, as I found by spending three
fascinating, but highly confusing, hours
over lunch with a British surgeon in
the Hungaria Restaurant yesterday.
What I do now understand is that we
all have male and female hormones, and
the balance between the two determines
whether our bodies look male or
female.
The balance is not easy to measure,
but affects secondary sexual charac-
teristics, like distribution of hair and
fat, size of breasts and genitals, etc.
However, some individuals and they
may be less uncommon than was once
thought have genetic abnormalities,
which may express themselves as
anatomical abnormalities.
For instance, it is possible for a
“woman” to have testes concealed in
her labia minor (the outer lip of the
entrance to the vagina), or even testes
associated with the ovaries. Are such
people male or female? Then there
are people classified as an “intersex”;
they are very rare the surgeon with
whom I had lunch says he has never
seen a true case.
Quite recently direct tests of genetic
make-up have emerged. Normal males
have a characteristic chromosome pair
in each cell, with an X and a Y
chromosome. Females have two X
chromosomes.
But it has now been discovered that
abnormal and intermediate cases, with
several Xs or Ys and other variations,
can exist. In particular, some females
may carry a male genetic element
and these may make better athletes.
Nobody, as yet, can say how many
such women there are, but it is obvious
that there will be a far higher propor-
tion among female athletes than in the
normal population, because the female
athletes at a championship like this
are the result of an immense filtering
process that skims off the athletically
elite.
This does not mean that all women
athletes have male characteristics, nor
does it mean that all the great women
athletes are any more male than the
average woman—after all, many of
them have had children, the ultimate
proof that they are female.
But up to now it has been sufficient
for a woman athlete to produce a chit
from her family doctor confirming that
she was a woman. Despite this, I’ve
sat in the stands at many international

championships and wondered about the
true sex of the athlete in front of me.
And, of course, the authorities have
been worried; hence the new rule in-
sisting that all women must be
examined by an independent panel of
doctors.
This entails the girls stripping and
parading in front of the panel a
very embarrassing procedure.
One Italian girl long-jumper, Maria
Trio, refused on religious grounds to
take the test and this led to rumors
that she was scared to take it. But I
am assured by members of the British
women’s team that there is no doubt
that she is female.
So she did not compete.
All sorts of questions are thrown
up by this strange dilemma. Does par-
ticipation in sport make a woman more
masculine? The answer to that is
“definitely not.” Is it possible to alter
the male/female balance by giving a
girl male hormones? Again rumor has
been rife on this point and some people
believe that the Russians may have
been feeding male hormones to at least
one of their women athletes.
J>UT apparently a course of male hor-
mones may alter the hair distribution,
may affect the breasts, but will not
change the anatomy unless and this
is not yet proved a prolonged course
of male hormone is given to a girl
between the ages of 10 and 14. This
prompts the horrifying thought that it
may be possible to take a 10-year-old
girl who shows athletic promise and
make her more masculine and thus
a better athlete.
It is a science-fiction thought, but this
has been science-fiction week. Dianabol
is a new drug which apparently retains
proteins in the body and increases bulk
and mass. The “heavy” men, the shot-
putters, hammer-throwers, discus and
decathlon athletes, now face the prob-
lem of whether they should take Diana-
bol.
It boils down to a very simple equa-
tion: mass multiplied by acceleration
equals force, and the more force you
can get behind your shot, or hammer,
or discus the farther it will go. So if
you can greatly increase mass without
losing too much acceleration you will
throw farther. And this has been hap-
pening.
Ron Pickering, the Welsh national
coach and the best field events coach
in Britain, says that he is at a cross-
roads. “Do I go on training my
athletes knowing that they* haven’t got
a chance against the Dianabol men,
or do I give them Dianabol and alter
their size and not be certain of the
side-effects?” These side-effects are re-
ported to be a possible decrease in the
size of the testicles and also some
blood-pressure trouble.
This question of how far you go
in search of athletic improvement is
acute for Pickering and every field
event athlete in the world, and it is
also a very real problem for athletics
as a whole.

The Last
Blood Sport
Rugby League viciousness
IT is a long way from the Plaza Toro
in Madrid to the Cricket Ground
in Sydney, but since March this
year the two arenas have had much
in common. On one the bloodletting i s
accomplished with surgical precision
by a matador, on the other the same
result is achieved by an initial twenty-
nine starters in Australia’s newest blood
sport, Rugby League. Most of them
finish or don’t finish the game in
various stages of health. (This includes
the referee and linesmen.)
In each case the afficionados of the
game tend to become frenzied at the
thought of blood or a broken bone.
In this year of League grace, it has
been an especially open season for the
headhunters, the kidney-kickers, the
vicious stiff-arm tacklers, whose prey
is always the talented and brilliant
players most likely to provide the pub-
lic with entertainment they’ve paid
hard cash to see. A top-class player
in the game today can have no feeling
of longevity, as under the existing
interpretation of the rules he has a
second-to-none chance of being flat-
tened, perhaps permanently, by a
bumbling Behemoth with nothing to
offer in the way of skill except a rigid
right arm.
Bred in the Rugby principle, we for-
sook the suburban atmosphere sur-
rounding the Union code to take in
the first League Test between England
and Australia, attracted to a certain
extent by incredible realms of League
information promulgated daily in
Press, radio, and television by sports-
writers, wingers, locks, coaches, cricket-
ers, disc jockeys, and sundry personali-
ties. From time to time it has won
front-page space even in Sydney’s lead-
ing daily, which finally succumbed to
the irresistible urge to report the start-
ling allegation that “a player had not
acted in the best interests of his club.”
Among the more thoughtful comments
was one from a prominent player who
stated that death in the afternoon
could result if vicious play was not
immediately curtailed.”
The Test had not been in progress
long before we were given a fair indi-
cation of what he meant. The most
glaring and vicious stiff-arm tackle
ever seen on the Cricket Ground had
brilliant English second-rower John
Mantle flopping around like a headless
chicken for five minutes. He was a

tors and players alike. In one bloody

pleasant array of head-high, sandwich,
and late tackling to soften their op-
ponents, more often than not with a
chopping right hand to finish off.
With this preoccupation with inflict-
ing the maximum bodily harm the
standard of play in main games this
season has fallen away to such an ex-
tent that the ball seldom gets to the
outside centre or the fleet-footed
wingers who more often than not com-
plete the game with jerseys unsoiled.
The bash-and-barge brigade have come
into their own, helped to a large extent
by farcical scrums and consistent off-
side play.
The fact that attendances are an all-
time high seems to indicate that pre-
vailing sense of values in the com-
munity 'today are being projected on
to the sporting arena and that the stir-
ring spectacle Rugby League can pro-
vide when players concentrate on the
game are a secondary consideration; or
maybe they’ve forgotten what a fast,
open game looks like.
We asked Darcy Lawler, the long-
time international League referee,
whose head remains unbowed, for his
opinion on the current League situa-
tion. “In my opinion all this bashing
and barging should be eliminated in
the judiciary room. A good stiff sen-
tence and the players would soon
realise that the paddock is for football
and brains, and not for coat-hanging
and kicking. Quite a few fans wrongly
blame the referee. But week after week
he sends players off only to find him-
self put on trial when he meets in the
judiciary with the players. Questions
are asked: ‘Where were you when he
punched him?’ ‘How far away?’ ‘Are
you sure it was the right man?’ He be-
comes the man on trial and not the
player. On top of that the players
who are sent off can cook up a few
lies and it is the referee who is found
guilty, not the players. One solution
I would like to see would save all this
vote-catching talk each year about the
judiciary not suspending players in
case they won’t be voted in next year.
It would be to have the Referees’ As-
sociation select a panel of six, one
of whom must go to each ground and
see for himself the game and the in-
cidents.”
By the time this goes to print the
unfortunate team to meet St. George
in the Grand Final will be known. Bal-
main have already had a taste of what
to expect. In their last encounter, the
field at one stage looked like a casualty
clearing station.
Officials of the game would do well
to reflect on the long-term results of
the vicious trend of the game at
present. The younger generation may
have second thoughts about continuing
in a game offering the prospects of
serious injury and the public will be
the eventual losers as prospective cham-
pions vanish into the limbo.

In those
32 stately floors
246,960 sq. feet
of Celdek
Steel decking
In the State Office Block in Sydney,
Lysaght Celdek plays a large part. An
unseen part. Yet it offers advantages
not found in any other flooring systems.
Celdek is a galvanized steel cellular flooring.
It cuts fixing time to a minimum,
eliminates the need for temporary props,
reduces crane and handling time. And
following trades simply “walk in and work.”
All electrical and communications wiring
is carried within the floor. This means
that office layout can be altered easily and
economically at any time —telephone and
power services can be placed at random.
Although you won’t see an inch of
Celdek when the State Office is complete.
Engineers, Architects, Tradesmen,
Technicians and Tenants will never forget
that Celdek is there. It’s a product you
can’t forget. Build it with steel, build it
with strength, build it with Celdek.
Available through structural decking
contractors.

Guardian Angel
BY E. A. GOLLSCHEWSKY
A SHORT STORY
IN his chair at the window he leaned
forward intently, watching the thin
sliver of smoke that rose above the
athel trees marking the boundary of
the oats paddock. What could she be
burning over there? Not grass, at this
time of year . . .
“A fire over there between the oats
and the road.” A question, in the form
of an observation. And she under-
stood it as such, answering sparely as
usual. She’d never been a loquacious
woman.
“Yes, I picked up the dead wood
lying around. That’s the stack burn-
ing—l set it off last night. Must be
just about burnt out.”
“Picked up the dead wood?” He
could hardly believe it. The action of
a penny-pinching share-farmer, that
was. “Why?”
“We want grass.”
“Always did, didn’t we? Tell me a
farmer that doesn’t.”
“Our stock’s nearly doubled the last
coupla years.” She flipped over the
mattress of his bed, hands much
stronger than they looked. Hands and
wrists. Sure in their work. She never
skimped on her job, give her that.
Mattress turned every day regular as
clockwork. Always sending away for
new treatments she heard of,
laboriously composing the letters. She’d
never had much schooling, you could
tell. But made up for it in shrewd-
ness, make no mistake about that . . .
H E peered resentfully at the pencil
of smoke, darker than the mist
rising over the river. Something wrong
downright wrong, about a fire burn-
ing on a man’s property without his
either lighting it or giving orders for
it to be lit. And stock had no right to
double in number without sanction
from the owner. Who had arranged
the servicing of his cows? Such things
a man should know.
Because the affront to his pride was
indefinable, he wished he could, in some
way, take it out on the woman. But
she gave him no opportunity. Deftly
she set the room to rights, not glancing
his way as he sat in the thin wash of
wintry sunlight, face turned outward
from the room in which he now lived.
His feeling of fretful discomfiture
increased. The outlook from his window
was curiously unfamiliar . . . and yet
he’d been aware of changes going on
for some time past. But vaguely. This
morning, with his attention caught by
the smoke, everything seemed to have
crystallised. Take the pullets scratch-
ing under the orange trees where the
earth was cool and damp. For one
thing there was a helluva lot more
than in his time, and pure-bred Rhode
Islands at that. His had been scraggy,
long-legged, wild-eyed chooks, few in
number, inbred, sneaking into the kit-
chen after scraps and leaving grey-
white dollops on the floor, or crawling
up the leaning stems of the papaws to
pick holes in the ripening fruit. They
were scavengers and laid their eggs
anywhere (when they did lay, which
wasn’t often, true) and dressed for
the table they were stringy and tough.
Must be fifty or sixty of those plump
red pullets rolling round, washing their
feathers in the loose soil. All very
well to go in for chooks in a big way,
but what you gonna feed ’m on, eh?
The price of feed these days ... a
silvery thread of saliva swung from his
mouth to catch on the grey flannel of
his shirt, leaving a snail’s track across
his chest.
“Chook feed —” he grumbled threat-
eningly, “is a tumble price.” He had
gone to a good agricultural college until
he was 18, but like most farmers’ sons
tended to disguise the fact in his speech.
And manners. One taunting cry of
“Tonk!” and country boys felt they
were ruined for life.
“If you buy it.” She sniffed. “I grow
my own. And sell some besides. You
never did grow enough stockfeed. No
pumpkins or milo or sweet potatoes
for the pigs a few miserable sticks
of cassava and you expect to rear pigs
on that! But who could tell you? You
alwus knew best.”
“I was reared to it.” His offensive
tone said plainly “You weren’t.”
“Reared to what?” she laughed mock-
ingly. “Reared to think you only have
to ow'n a bit of land and you’re the
big grazier? To ape the big man?”
She slapped a pillow into shape and
set it exactly where his back would
rest. “Order a hundredweight of this
and half a ton of that to keep the cows
alive in bad weather. A bag of this and
a bag of that to keep the chooks from
starving. I grow my own, like I said.”
The corner of the bedclothes, tucked in
securely all round so they wouldn’t
slide, was flipped back ready to receive
him. “I’ll leave you a Thermos of tea.
I’ll be away all morning picking corn.”
His ungainly head swung about and
he stared at her in astonishment,
deepset little eyes grown even smaller
with suspicion. “What corn?”
She raised her voice in the irritating
habit she’d acquired since his illness,
as if his hearing were affected. “Ruben
ploughed the four-acre last September.
I borrowed Hagermann’s planter and
put the seed in. It’s a fair crop. But
I want it in the barn as soon as possible
in case the weather breaks.”
He ran a distorted hand over his
shaven head, absently feeling the bumps
and hollows her ruthless razor had ex-
posed. Knobs he’d never known were
there when the barber cut his hair
regular every second Saturday, side
parting, long on top. When she was
forced into dealing with the shock it
became after he was confined to bed,
she simply shaved it off. “Quicker and
cleaner,” she said. “You know, an
invalid aunt of mine got a nest of mice
in her hair once. After that they made
her brush and comb it every day.” How
was it possible for an entire crop to be
sown and ready for harvest on a man’s
land without his knowledge?
“That barn’s pretty well fallen


down,” he heard his own voice say
evasively, dodging the issue after all.
“It won’t keep out no bad weather.”
“I had it repaired. Last autumn.”
So there was nothing else to say.
She stood for a moment, bony, cal-
loused hands hanging from the shrunken
sleeves of her red cardigan. Pity for
her touched him. No doubt she’d done
a man’s work this past year. Say the
past couple of years, maybe five if you
were fussy. For the fact must be faced
he hadn’t done much for a while there,
even before he got crook. He had
already started leaving things to her
to see to. Married nine years last
Christmas. Yes, her hands showed it.
His own were whiter than they’d ever
been in his iife. Whiter and plumper.
But was that his fault? Arthritis didn’t
mean a man couldn’t eat it, did it?
YES, she could work, he’d give her
that. And nothing much of her,
come to look. A quick little sparrow of
a woman. Looking round the room now
to see if she’d missed anything, but she
never did. Thorough. That was her.
“I’ll come back and help you into
bed before I go to the corn paddock,”
she said, turning away.
The blue dog emerged from under
the bed to follow her. “Crikey,” he
wheedled, and clicked his tongue,
“here, boy. Come on, Crikey. Come,
boy . . .” but the dog ignored him, Dad-
ding after her down the long hall, nails
scratching on the linoleum. Ever you
see such a bastard?
He picked up a saucer containing
scraps of sausage meat from where it
stood on the table beside him. With
some difficulty—for, though plump and
white, his hands were badly twisted —
he picked up the scraps and laid them
out on the window-sill. Later, the
birds would come. It was something
to look forward to.
Funny, how when she left a room
the quietness seemed intensified. The
silence kind of deepened. Yet she was
quiet enough when she was present,
sometimes not speaking at all, working
silently. But it was always the same.
Like a hush. He could hear the familiar
morning sounds through that hush:
the windmill’s leisurely creaking, dis-
tant fowls cackling hysterically after
laying their eggs, the sow’s demanding
squeals, the butcher birds and magpies
in the macadamia nut trees, somewhere
far away a tractor growling, and now,
above all other sounds, Crikey barking
and woofing like a damned lunatic
around her legs as she went about the
outside chores.
That Crikey, he thought venomously.
Ever you know a dog before to leave
its master and take to somebody else
voluntary, a woman at that? But he’d
said all along the dog was no good.
Never did show a grain of sense even
a s a pup. Still, Crikey was his dog,
a nd somehow a man expects his dog, at
lea st . . . he’d heard once of a kelpie
that lay under its master’s sick bed for
months and wouldn’t leave it until he
did, and there was that alsatian they
hadda shoot because it wouldn’t leave
a kid’s grave and kept scrabbling at the
loose dirt, unnerving everyone who saw
it. You wouldn’t catch Crikey at any-
thing like that. Frisking out there
round her skirts instead of lying in here
being faithful unto death.
She came into view carrying a
heavy bucket of pig swill in each hand,
shoulders dragged down under the
weight. The slops had splashed out on
to her dress. The sow squealed franti-
cally, thrusting her long snout over the
top rail of the sty. He could see her
enormous hairy ears flopping forward,
the great girth of her looming behind.
She was heavy in pig and always
ravenous.
That was another thing.
He frowned. They’d never bred pigs
before, being content to buy a few
weaners when the stores were sold or
slaughtered for home curing. Say she
had fourteen young, that sow, when she
farrowed. Made a lot of pigs’ mouths
to fill. Was she counting on carting all
that feed to the pens herself? Or putting
in automatic feeders? The place, you
might say, was in full production. It’s
been built up. He sighed.
In her inexorable way she w as chang-
ing everything. With Ruben’s help. He’d
painted the house. Always had him
hanging around doing something, work-
ing, to be sure, for she wasn’t one to
tolerate idleness even in a pet such as
Ruben, but paying out good money on
his wages all the time. Mending fences,
pruning fruit-trees, spraying the citrus,
whitewashing the outhouses, burning
off. She always had something on the
go. Like a woman possessed. Or possess-
ing? That was a cold thought.
It occurred to him that the mental
picture he carried of the ramshackle,
rundown property, going to seed since
his father’s time and not improved in
his, was out of date. It must look very
different now.
Well. He was willing to bet she’d get
jack of it. The ground wasn’t up to
much, all said and done, and on the
land you had everything against you—
seasons, contrary animals, ever-
mounting costs ... you couldn’t tell
him —he’d been born here. It all got a
man down in the end. He’d been only
too glad to clear off to towm every spare
minute.
That was what his illness had robbed
him of, the free and easy life, no disci-
pline, no hard work, no being tied down
to regular hours and monotonous duties.
He did what he felt like doing and left
the rest. Christ, yes, that was what he
missed. The long, lazy Saturdays at the
pub, the races, the yarning, the cards,
the companionship. The bi-weekly sales
at the stockyards with dust rising in
clouds above the backs of milling cattle,
the reek of horseflesh, of animal urine
and manure, the cracking of stockwhips,
the freely obscene language, and, at the
end of the day, washing the dust and
tiredness away with rum. No, he knew
damned well it was never farming as a
job he was addicted to, it was the way
of life it made possible. A lord’s life.
That’s what she used to say: “You live
like a lord. Why don’t you work your
land?”
He’d been content to enjoy it. Made
enough to keep his head above water.
In at .the bank a bit, of course, but
she’d soon paid off that mortgage.
Did it mean a man didn’t have a
feeling for his land even if he did let it
run a bit to seed? Neglect, she’d called
it. He’d thought of it as, say, a bit
of easy living, for him and the land.
No pushing. Just knowing it was yours
and that you weren’t tied to anything
and making a living. . . .
Why, then, had he married her? The
old, old reason for country dwellers.
He’d need a housekeeper. To a farmer
a wife is almost as necessary as water..
But that didn’t explain why she’d
married him . . . better than slushying
at the pub where he’d met her, prob-
ably. He had stayed over one week-
end and she’d shared it with him, nurs-
ing him back from a heavy drunk.
Tractable enough, she’d seemed,
anxious to please, malleable. He’d
married her confidently enough. She
was meticulously clean in her habits.
He had no complaints then or later.
And if she had any, she kept them to
herself. Sometimes, she tried to organ-
ise the work around the place a bit and
he’d had to put her down, keep her
in her place. But what was her “place”
now'? She was a kind of Boss Cocky.
When had everything started to
change? There had been his illness
when he was so dependent on her.
And afterwards a kind of passive re-
sistance in her attitude had made itself
felt. She became, in fact, an unknown
quantity. Which accounted for his
present wariness, his uncertainty, his
wish to placate her now.
£jHE came in wearing an old pair of
his khaki pants cut dowm to fit her,
one of the boys’ shirts of which she
had a number, and an Army hat. It
seemed an added injustice that at —
what? 42—she retained the figure she
must have had at 16. No face to speak
of, but trim behind, firmly pointing
in front, slim hips, and swift, light feet
that sped about their work. Red-eyed
with worry and resentment, he deliber-
ately made it harder for her to get
him into the bed, jerking away from
her, tugging impatiently. But he failed
to goad her into protest.
“You want your bottle before I go?”
“Not now. Leave it handy.” He
still disliked her standing near after
she’d put him on the commode or while
he used the bottle, after all this time.
Not that it worried her. She usually
hummed unconcernedly to herself

while, in an agony of embarrassment
he made water.
“I’m off to the corn paddock now
If you want anything- urgent, there’s
the cowbell.” A green cord fishing
line was tied to his bedhead, passed
through the window, and attached to
an old cowbell hung above the barn
Ruben had rigged it. Its clamor could
be heard for miles. He’d only had
cause to use it once: when he set fire
to his bedclothes. She’d seen to it that
he gave up smoking after that.
As she bent to tuck in the covers
about him he glimpsed the soft, muzzy
growth of black down between her
breasts. You ever know a woman grow
hair there before? Wasn’t feminine.
He’d told her so, the first time he saw
it. But she’d only smiled. He realised
later why she smiled. She’d known
he was wrong. . . .
“Don’t knock the Thermos over, now.
Biscuits in the plastic dish. Should be
home about one. You’ll notice I’ve
left the windmill on but don’t worry.
I’m irrigating the young grapes.”
He'd never done any irrigating in
his time. Lot of fancy nonsense in his
opinion. You couldn’t irrigate for
nothing, neither. It meant laying out
money. Was there no end to her ex-
travagance? And just say anything to
her! See how her little tight mouth
hardened then! A woman who never
had a suitcase to pack her things in
when she came—just rolled ’em all up
in a chenille dressing-gown. That was
how much she had. But look at her
now! Spend, spend, spend . . .
Crikey hadn’t come in this time. He
waited at the door, yellow eyes follow-
ing her, ears cocked, whining softly.
When she left he bounded ahead of
her. Joyfully. The mongrel!
Again the settling silence. He heard
the Land-Rover coming down the track
that led from the main road, its bumps
and thumps and roars muffled by over-
grown oleanders lining the roadway.
People hereabout didn’t go in for
gardens much, but flowering shrubs
like hibiscus, oleander, and belladonna
were popular because they required no
care.
rpHE Land-Rover stopped in the yard.
Ruben. Always about lately, some-
times far into the night. He lived in
a galvanised iron and bag hut down
by the river, picking up odd jobs and
seldom having to go looking for work.
“Get Ruben,” the farmers said when
they were shorthanded. Good-tempered,
childishly generous, always laughing,
Ruben was spoken of with tolerance.
If not mateship. He had no mates.
He’d been in trouble with the police
a few times, nothing serious, and with
that cherubic face you tended to for-
get there’d ever been trouble. One
farmer wouldn’t pay up when Ruben
finished some contract fencing for
him. Ruben had caught the farmer’s
bull one night and tied a piece of
plastic cord around its pizzle, letting


t fie bull go again in the paddock. With
cows on heat, the breeding paddock.
That had caused a bit of trouble one
wa y and another. Then he'd used a
ca r without permission of the owner,
enjoyed carnal knowledge of a girl
under 17 (though everyone knew what
Libby Chase was, still) and things like
that. The queerest thing about Ruben
in his lonely river-hut existence with
Lis crab pots lying around and his
fishing nets festooning the oak trees
was the fact that he kept no pets. No
birds picked around his camp looking
for titbits. No stray dogs made it their
home and no starving cats prowled
about.
There’d been no sound of a door
slamming from the Land-Rover, but that
was to be expected since all the doors
had long since fallen off it. But he heard
the crunch of boots on gravel, and
Crikey, that pseudo watchdog, barking
aggressively in the distance. Let a
stranger come near the place, though,
and he slept on regardless, or cracked
fleas with concentrated attention . . .
Light was abruptly blotted from the
window as Ruben’s head and shoulders
pushed through. The house was raised
a little off the ground, but Ruben was
tall. A big, gangling fellow. The sun,
stronger now and having dispersed the
wisps of fog hanging in the still air,
struck through the upper panes of glass
and lit his roughly sheared, innocently
fair hair with dazzling brightness.
Angelic. That was the look of him.
Yet Ruben was not as young as
his looks suggested. The network of
lines about his tranquil eyes was
meshed deep, but you didn’t see it
except in bright sunlight or close up,
so smooth and brown was his com-
plexion. His mouth was full and wide,
lax, but there w'as the setness of maturity
about its very laxity.
“How’s it today, Mister Boss?” Easy,
drawling voice with the eternal half-
laugh, the bubble of spittle at the cor-
ners of his lips. Candid blue eyes re-
garding him benevolently. The childish
face with its fleshy features expressing
nothing but goodwill. Yet he must know
his continued presence on the farm had
caused row r s.
“No use complaining.” Perhaps he’d
go soon. It wasn’t customary for him
to come near the house when she wasn’t
there. Usually he went straight to where
she was working to get his orders for
the day. The uneasiness he abvays felt
in Ruben’s presence was intensified
today. He felt nervous, and Ruben’s
reassuring smile filled him with disquiet.
There was something he couldn’t trust
about a man who had no mates, didn’t
drink, never brawded, always smiled . . .
why, for Christ’s sake! Ruben w ? as a
bit of a nong, everyone said so.
“Where’s the wife?”
“Picking corn.”
But instead of going Ruben got out
his Gold Flake tin, extracted a paper,
and set it wetly on his bottom lip while
he rolled the makings. Never in a hurry,
Ruben. Except at knock-off time. He'd
seen him down tools a good quarter
hour before he should and he’d told
her. She didn’t sack him, though. Only
saw to it that he worked full-time.
“She —er —said anything to you, like?
Know what I mean. Been discussing?”
Give him a cold stare. Not that it
shifted the pleasant grin on his face.
On the contrary, his growled “No. Why
should she?” seemed to make the grin
grow wider. He added, “You know
her.” Meaning her quiet, not to say
secretive, ways . . .
“Yeah.” Ruben’s grin broke into
spitty laughter. “I know her all right.”
What the be-Jesus was he laughing
at?
didn’t tell you, eh? Said she was
gonna. But like you said, we know
her. Well, nothing for it but to tell
it my way. Baldock Brothers want to
buy you out. Offered a good price.
Nine thou, actually.” Like many men
who’d never had a dollar to their
name Ruben spoke of large sums of
money with grandiloquent casualness.
His serene eyes grew suddenly menac-
ing, but for no other reason than that
they narrowed against the smoke rising
from his cigarette. “Not bad, eh? When
your old man’s father took up this
land for nix, practically, in open selec-
tion. She told me. She thinks it’s a
fair enough awfer.”
“Might be. But I ain’t thinking of
selling and it ain't hers to sell."
“Come off it! Too beddy right it
is. I’m telling you now. It wouldena
kept a family of bandicoots alive be-
fore she got the reins. You wouldena
got a quarter that for it.”
“Had I wanted to sell.”
“You ain’t got no say, see? Made
it over legal to her you did, when your
arthuritis got so bad you couldn’t
hardly hold a pen. Someone had to
write the business letters and cheques
and orders for stuff for the farm and
that. You were only too glad to hand
it over, holus bolus, to that good
woman then.”
“Why, you bastard! It’s got noth-
ing to do with you —” he wanted to
groan with the indignity of it. That
he should have to lie here and listen
to this great stupid ox . . . wouldn’t
be so bad if what he said wasn’t true
. . . only it was all so different to the
way he said. She was submissive then.,
she was humble. Kept her place at a
word from him. Never wrote a cheque:
without his permission, talking it over
first. He checked the orders . . . but
how long now since he’d seen a wages
sheet, a bill, a cheque book? “Mind
your own business. And get out of
here, you dirty big swine. I don’t have
to put up with you and your stieky-
beaking into my affairs. Go on, get!”
Ruben beamed at him. But how
could such a rotten bastard have a —a
beatific smile? It just: wasn’t possible.
“Arright, Mister Mighty Boss. Don’t
do your narna. Just reminding you of
a few facts you seem to have forgot,
like. What she sh.oulda told you her-
self. Don’t understand her. Reckons
she’s fond o’ you.. Ever hear the like?
It’s got me beat.”
“You crazy coot —”
“No, I’m a lotta things, but I ain’t
crazy.” Limpid, gentian eyes, all too

reasonable. The terrible reasoning of
non-feeling. For the first time he felt
a stab of real fear. Fear. But not
channelled; fear like an amorphous
shape. “We been talking of going-
north, see? Up to the Isa. Big money
there. Me brother’s got a proposition if
I can get hold of a big truck. But we
gotta have a van to live in as well.
It’ll cost a heap. But no risk. There’s
money to be made, you can ask her.
Catch her risking money?” He laughed
admiringly. “She’s got a better head
for business ’n you’ll ever have. But
you were always so arrogant you
wouldn’t see it. But you can trust her—
she don't throw- no money down
drains. He nodded vigorously, adding
emphasis to his trust.
It couldn't be possible. A man smil-
ing tranquilly at you while he planned
to rob you of wife, home, and farm in
one sweep. He shook his head dazedly .
And her part? He said shakily, "You
mean —she and you—”
"Like that we are, the two of us.”
He held up the first two fingers of his
left hand, pressed close together, the
gesture made ludicrous by the missing
notch of his forefinger. "Time for you
to know. I kept telling her, 'Tell him,
what’re you so soft on him for?’ Well,
now you know.”
JT was the smiling, untroubled face
that unmanned him. He heard him-
self whimpering like a pup frantic
to pee. He shut his eyes, but the face
stayed imprinted on his vision, even
to the faint green moss on his big-
teeth ... he felt tears cooling on his
cheeks.
“No need to upset yourself atall.”
Incongruous words made more mon-
strous by the tone of kindly concern
in which they were spoken. He felt
Ruben would be gentle, pleasant, until
the moment when his fingers closed
round your windpipe. “No hard feel-
ings, I hope? Brooding gets you no-
where I always say.” He withdrew. His
soft chuckle came floating back
through the w-'indow. "Best I get going
or she’ll do her narna. Never knew a
woman such a slavedriver. Well, that’s
the way they get on. Be seeing you.”
When the familiar stillness settled
on the room once more, a butcher bird
hopped on the window-sill looking for
scraps. Ruben must have knocked dow n
the crumbs of sausage, for, after lift-
ing its head and emitting its heart-
breaking trill, it peered restlessly about
then dropped to the floor inside the
window. He heard the threadlike scrip
of its feet on the linoleum, as he’d
heard Crikey’s harsher scratchings
earlier. Then the bird flew up, alighted
on the back of the window-chair,
flirted its tail a time or two, then sur-
veyed the man through beady eyes.
They reminded him of Ruben’s, except
that his wore the disguise of goodwill.
The birds were openly wdthout feeling.
He'd never realised before how cold
and hard a bird’s eyes were. He was
glad when it flew away. After deposit-
ing a white streak on the chair.
He heard them come home at one
punctual as usual. He could almost
believe he’d had a nightmare, that
he’d dozed, and dreamt the interview
with Ruben.
The usual sounds. Ruben whistling
as he washed his face and hands on
the bench at the back door. Voices.
Slam of the fridge door. Lid of the
teapot rattling. Crikey yelping in sharp
protest —somebody must have kicked
him out of the way. The clink of
china and cutlery, then above every-
thing the clear enunciation of the news-
reader as the volume of the radio
was turned up. Light, quick steps
coming down the hall toward his room.
She sat the tray on his bedside table,
plain food but appetising, prepared
with the unfussing cleanliness that was
second nature to her. But how' in hell
expect a man to eat?
‘'You want your transistor?”
He shook his head. “I can hear the
news.” As he pulled himself upright
she reached for the grey cardigan
hanging on the knob of the bed and
helped him on w-ith it. “If I want to.”
He stared at the tongue and salad.
The slice of cheese. “Why don’t you
poison it and get rid of me altogether?
I've been crook so long nobody would
question it.”
“What a way to talk! It wouldn't be
right.”
Morals! God! “You think selling a
man’s farm over his head is right.”
“You signed it over to me when you
got sick. And you know why? I do.
Because you had the runs thinking
I’d clear out and leave you on your
own. It was a bribe to keep me here.
You’d never bothered to treat me
decent before. After the first coupla
months you never even slept with me
no more. Why? What was wrong with
me?”
He stared at her. What had been
wrong with her? How strange to think
he’d dumped her so easily . . .
“Think I didn’t know' about that
slut in Leichhardt Street that you
dressed the chooks for and took to her,
and bottles of cream? The grapes and
apricots and everything? Wasn’t I as
good as her?”
Well, better, come to that. But how
to explain? Even to himself . . .
“You think there’s nothing to be
said for my side of it? Look at it my
way. Ruben’s got faults. But I know
them, see? I can handle him. I might
even have a kid. It’s not too late for
that.”
“But you’re married to me! Not
him!”
“Put yourself in my shoes.”
He tried to and couldn’t. He’d never
known how her mind worked, he
realised that now r , not in all the years
he’d been married to her.
She said, “Who’ll know' anything

£jHE crossed to the window and peered
out at the overcast sky. “We’ve
got to get that corn in quick. It’s
coming up like rain. The crop isn’t
in the purchase price.” Her smile was
self-satisfied. She’d driven a hard bar-
gain.
Then she noticed his wet cheeks and
the mucus running from his nose. She
tossed him a handkerchief. “Wipe your
face.” Regarding him with a certain
friendliness. After all, didn’t she owe
it all to him? You could see that in
her own fashion she was grateful.
“Don’t worry,” she said soothingly.
I’ll see that nothing happens to you.

noon from time to time he heard
Crikey barking, away in the corn pad-

of a fox was enough to send him into
hysteria. Sometimes Ruben brought
him back with,a shrill whistle. Once
he heard the woman’s laughter mingle
with barking as if she were playing
with the dog.
That Crikey!

Casino Pays for Culture
From PAUL FROLICH
THE French, bless them, turned the
other cheek. Despite all I’d done
to mangle their beautiful lan-
guage, they rewarded my two weeks’
stay in France with the finest music
festival I’ve yet attended. Some of the
English and German music critics
I met earlier looked down their noses
when I mentioned I’d be visiting
Aix-en-Provence. They were wrong, of
course; what’s more, at least some of
their colleagues must have thought
otherwise, for there were quite a few
writers from Britain, Ireland, Germany,
and Switzerland, to say nothing of the
French, present to join in a delightful
occasion.
Among the things that made this an
outstanding affair was the location: Aix
is a lovely old town where Roman
remains abound among the mostly
18th- and 19th-century French buildings.
With the lovely vine-clad countryside
of Provence spread out around it, the
starkly bare hills encasing the Rhone
basin and fertile plains stretching away
to historic Avignon, Aix has a lovely
climate, pleasant inhabitants, and a
flourishing casino.
The town provides a splendid set-
ting for the festival, which is effici-
ently administered from the casino,
with its fine gardens," terraces, foun-
tains, and restaurant; it is from casino
funds, as it happens, that the deficits
of the city’s festivals have been met.
I’ve learnt by now that all festivals,
no matter how well patronised, must
operate at a loss; judging by the mag-
nitude of the program and the high
standard of presentation, the loss at
Aix must be quite a substantial one.
'JHE program at Aix is mainly
opera, with just a few concerts,
some of them staged at various castles
in the neighborhood. I heard a sacred
concert in the cathedral and three
opera performances in the court of
the Archbishop’s Palace. The concert
opened with a Mozart fantasia for
organ, very well played on a reason-
ably suitable instrument. The major
work was Beethoven’s “Missa
Solemnis,” in a performance vastly
superior to the one I’d been to in
Holland. The Paris Orchestre de la
Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire,
which also played for all the operas,
was excellently conducted by Serge
Baudo. His direction, though never
over-emphatic, was pretty definite all
the same and gave a real unity to the
whole performance. The Cathedrale
du Saint-Sauveur is a fine church, parts
of it dating from the 12th century
and providing quite acceptable acous-
tics. All the soloists were good, the
choir of Elisabeth Brasseur sang
splendidly, and the orchestra also was
very good indeed; however, this per-
formance was marred by very crude
solo playing from the unnamed con-
cert master.
The three operas were all works
which are not frequently staged. At
Aix, opera is heard out-of-doors, with
the audience in tiered seats erected in
the palace court under the open sky,
with stars and sputniks overhead.
Orchestra and players are under cover,
with a conventional pit and proscenium
arch. The sound is amazingly intimate,
with not a word or note being lost.
Although performances may start as
late as 9.30 p.m., this is only shortly
after dark and one doesn’t grudge
sitting up until after midnight.
Conducted by the same Serge Baudo
an impressive conductor in every
respect I heard Debussy’s “Pelleas
et Melisande,” so bravely staged by
Goossens at Sydney Conservatorium in
the ’4os. The work, to a text by
Maurice Maeterlinck, is often con-
sidered unsuited to the stage, but the
Aix production disproved this. Sets
with mysterious hanging shapes in sil-
houette, hints of dark waters and dark
passions, and imaginative lighting con-
tributed to a wholly convincing per-
formance. The stage, including orches-
tra and conductor, was enclosed with
a gauze curtain which helped to deepen
the air of unreality. The play calls
for a small cast only. Pelleas was sung
by James Workman, a 26-year-old
American trained at Curtis and cur-
Luigi Alva and Ronald Dowd in
Mozart’s “Idomeneo,” at the Aix-en-
Provence Festival.
rently a member of the Hamburg
Opera; he is a capable performer with
a fine voice and considerable acting
talent. Golaud was played by Gabriel
Bacquier, possibly the most accom-
plished singer in this company and
that’s saying quite a lot. Arkel was
sung by the justly renowned Nicola
Zaccaria, and Melisande by Elaine
Lublin, a very fine Milan-trained young
singer. The part of Genevieve, regret-
tably a very slender one vocally, was
taken by English mezzo Anna Reynolds,
who has been carving a remarkable
career for herself in the U.K. and in
Italy.
rarely staged opera was
Mozart’s “Idomeneo,” dramatically
a far less convincing work than
Debussy’s. Sung in the original Italian,
its libretto certainly gives no opening
to good theatre and the performance
was further handicapped by a rather
dull single set and rather sketchy
production. Musically, the opera is
quite unlike Mozart’s other operas. As
the libretto is completely humorless,
Mozart, with his sure dramatic
instinct, wrote much more seriously
for it. Much of the music is very fine
indeed, but less immediately ear-
catching than that of the better-known
works. The singers were Ronald Dowd
in the name part, Luigi Alva, Louis
Williams, Enriqueta Tarres, and Teresa
Stich-Randall, the conductor Peter
Maag, a renowned Mozart specialist.
All the singers, and for that matter the
chorus, sounded very good, but the
orchestra played rather poorly on this
occasion an off night in several
respects and there were such almost
incredible noises from the bassoons and
occasionally other players that I felt
rather sorry for the singers, best of
whom was negro baritone Williams as
the High Priest. Where the production
failed most spectacularly was in the
treatment of the chorus, members of
which were made to perform com-
pletely inane group movements in the
manner of a ballet class; Miss Tarres,
at whose true appearance I could not
guess, was unsuitably costumed for
Elettra and very badly bewigged and
made up. Teresa Stich-Randall, a
young singer about whom I had heard
a great deal, was, again by bad make-
up, made to look unduly old and
shrewish.
The best evening’s entertainment,
worthy of the brilliantly clear sky and
elegant audience, was Strauss’ “Ariadne
auf Naxos.” This is an opera which
truly suits a festival atmosphere, with
its rich score and a play compounded
of whimsy and musical satire. The
opera was conducted by Georges Sebas-
tian, whose long association with Rich-
ard Strauss and his music guaranteed
authenticity, and we were treated to a
sparkling performance. The orchestra,
on this occasion, better described as a
large body of instrumental soloists,
played exceedingly well, and the only
singer to disappoint was Mady Mesple,
whose shrill Zerbinetta was dramatically

impossible and vocally inadequate. Out-
standing among the men was Jean
Cox, a very able tenor with great his-
trionic talents. Of the women, Regine
Crespin, as Ariadne, proved to be an
even greater artist than records had led
me to expect. Impeccable vocally, she
is an impressive prima donna on stage
and off it; she carried off her role with
immense aplomb and humor and, in
the prologue, managed to give a bril-
liant parody of the Marschallin, one
of her own greatest parts.
The surprise of the evening came
from Tatyana Troyanos, my greatest
vocal discovery on this tour. Born in
the U.S.A., of Greek descent, Miss
Troyanos trained at Juilliard and, after
some work with the N.Y. City Opera,
has just completed the first season
under a three-year contract to the
Hamburg Opera. She is some six
feet tall, dark and lively, with Octa-
vian, Carmen, Juliette among her
parts and songs by Alban Berg and
French composers in her repertoire.
Her singing of the Composer’s part
was musically and dramatically stun-
ning, and I hope Australia may get to
hear her before her assured success
makes her unavailable to us.
I continue to be amazed by the
number of fine artists who, it seems,
have never been seriously considered
for Australian tours. Conductors of the
calibre of Norman del Mar, Baudo,
and Maag, singers like Crespin, Rey-
nolds, and Cox, pianists as outstand-
ing as Ashkenazy and Heidsieck the
list could be a long one. There are
indeed so many fine artists of whom
we, in Australia, have hardly heard, as
yet, that I am puzzled by the fact that
so many of the artists on the ABC
circuit are invited to tour more than
once; these omissions seem doubly
strange when it is realised that not all
the ones invited are really first-rate
and that we remain so desperately short
of good conductors. While truly great
ones, such as a Klemperer or Walter,
will always be very few in number,
there is in Europe today an abundance
of gifted and immensely capable
younger men, at least some of whom
have no permanent attachments, and
it is a fact that most of them express
an interest in Australia and seem to
be merely waiting to be asked.
THEATRE
The Measure of Failure
Private Yuk Objects. Alan Hopgood.
Directed by John Sumner. Russell
Street, Melbourne.
Joyce Grenfell. Comedy, Melbourne.
SHORTLY after the 1956 Revo-
lution, the Hungarian writer Tibor
Meray was brought to Australia by
the Association for Cultural Freedom.
It was hoped that his revelations of
Soviet brutality would break scores of
bleeding left-wing hearts, but he disap-
pointed his sponsors by taking a dif-
ferent line.
In draughty Kelvin Hall, Melbourne,
pulpit for Fabians and faith healers,
he did dismiss the Russian interpre-
tation of events, but then treated the
United Nation’s white paper with equal
contempt. Meray reminded us that
when Horthy marched into Hungary
in 1916, it had taken weeks for the
outside world to get any picture of
what was happening, whereas, in 1956,
the world sat and watched the Revo-
lution happening on television. We saw
the tanks and the street-fighting and the
secret police shot down and, Meray
insisted we’d been completely mis-
informed. His version of the events of
1956 is not relevant here but his
insistence that modern communications
allow events to be profoundly con-
fused and distorted most certainly is.
The war in Vietnam has had unpre-
cedented coverage in mass media. The
streets of Saigon have become as fam-
lliar as Bourke Street or Castlereagh
Street. The sight of the American
marines trudging through rice paddies,
frail Vietnamese faces, and helicopters
as thick as locusts are as much part of
a nice night’s entertainment as Fab’s
white knight, Dick Van Dyke, and The
Munsters. Yet, not only do viewers
find it hard to pick the real corpse from
the actor playing dead, but they have
little hope of relating the fragmentary
reports to the elusive issues. We have
a community which knows exactly what
the war looks like, but next to nothing
of what it is about. This has prompted
Mr. Hopgood to help us out by tackling
the whole subject in three acts.
He sets out to do for Vietnam what
Hochhuth did in “The Representative”
to give us in documentary and dra-
matic form a complete run-down on an
epic problem. But unlike Hochhuth,
Hopgood is unaligned. His play bends
over backwards giving everyone a fair
go. But since when has drama been
objective? Hopgood has a projector
flash up news photos, quotations and
statistics. He gives us interminable
family arguments on conscription. He
has an articulate Victor Charlie debate
the war at length with a laconic Aus-
tralian soldier. And when it was all
over, the audience clapped and stamped
their approval.
This, to me, was a measure of Hop-
good’s failure. He had offended no one.
Every viewpoint had had a sporting
chance. What summing up tljere was
came from a grotesque Speewah Jack
character called Daddy Yuk, a sort
of Holy Man down from the Baw
Baws, who up until then had been used
for the crudest imaginable comic relief.
His contribution was the sort of phil-
osophy beloved of the “Reader’s
Digest” and headmasters.
I say Hopgood offended no one.
That is not completely fair. He cer-
tainly would have offended any young
dissenters. For the three dissenting
characters an agonised young man,
his tough - minded sister, and the
Schweik-like Private Yuk were all
converted from total opposition to
shamefaced obedience by just one
cliche-ridden speech from a Liberal
MP.
But when it was all said and said
and said and done, everyone had been
provided with adequate evidence to
reinforce their original opinion or to
add further to their original confusion.
I have no argument with the cast
or John Sumner’s production. David
Turnbull did his best with Private
Yuk, a character left over from Hop-
good’s footy play “And The Big Men
Fly.” While George Whaley turned in
an ingenious performance as Daddy
Yuk, the character was too grotesquely
overstated to have any part in ostens-
ibly serious proceedings. Michael Duf-
field was a substantial MP, Brian
James brought off the difficult role of
the Vietnamese intellectual, and the
author was chilling in the role of the
tough, laconic and brutalised Austra-

Irish accent, V.C. Private John Paton
chatted his pig-Vietnamese quite con-
vincingly.
A farm in the Baw Baws, a Vietna-
mese village and a Toorak living-room
were fitted on to the stage but not
very artfully by Kristian Fredrikson.
Joyce Grenfell’s brand of satire is
also scrupulously inoffensive. Some of
her songs are charming and poignant,
and occasionally a sketch can be ex-
tremely funny. But generally the pro-
ceedings have a tired and dated feel-
ing.
PHILLIP ADAMS
Not Our Cup of Tea
The Fantasticks. Produced by Jeff
Warren. Phillip, Sydney.
FOR a time it seemed as if “A Cup
of Tea, a Bex and a Good Lie
Down” might take up permanent
residence at Sydney’s Phillip Theatre,
like the builders at Bennelong Point.
But all good things must come to an
end and the Australian revue has now
been followed by the American musical
“The Fantasticks.”
“American musical” is somewhat
misleading. With a cast of eight and
music from harp and piano (both very
clumsily on stage) “The Fanasticks”
would not exactly be J. C. Williamson’s
idea of a musical. Based on the late
19th-century farce by Rostand, “Les
Romanesques,” it has been running off-
Broadway that world away from
Broadway for six solid, inexplicable
years.
But the small-cast musical should
offer possibilities. Freed from the tyran-
nies of big production numbers and
static chorus-lines, it should be able to
provide greater development of charac-
ter and more pointed wit. “The Fan-
tasticks” may inspire some local writer
to devise a small-cast musical. It can
hardly achieve much more.
The idea behind “The Fanasticks”
is featherweight two fathers faking
a feud as the one sure way to make
their son and daughter fall in love and
marry. The cast works hard to skim
over the sticky sentiments and limp
patches and in one or two spots may
have over-compensated.
Australian actors do not have much
gift for whimsy (for which we may give
thanks). Their faces do not settle in
the right lines, their voices do not take
on the right ring of spurious enchant-
ment. Brian Hannan as the young lover,
Willie Fennell and Ron Shand as the
fathers, and Robin Cuming as the nar-
rator brought expertness and energy if
not much deep conviction to then-
parts. Rosalind Seagrave looked
pretty and performed capably and
David Spurling and Frank Lloyd
worked splendidly as the two knock-
about clowns.
PATRICIA ROLFE
FILMS
Below-stairs
The Diary of a Chambermaid. Director
Luis Bunuel.
BUNUEL is probably unique anions;
film-makers—a director who
first scandalised his audiences
over 30 years ago with “L’Age d’Or,”
who is sometimes not heard from for
years at a time then comes back to
the screen as commandingly as if he’d
never been away; whose films never
seem to be influenced by any wave,
new or old, yet never look old
fashioned. Individualistic, anarchic,
idiosyncratic, he uses the language of
the film to express his own beliefs,
speaking in the tones of tragedy!
comedy or melodrama of his digust
with the perversion of human society.
Yet his films though often disturbing,
even horrifying, are not in the last
analysis depressing: only a lover of
humanity could so clearly recognise,
so warmly deplore, how far man can
fall from his own high potentialities.
“The Diary of a Chambermaid” is
one of Bunuel’s less scarifying films, a
screen version of Octave Mirbeau’s
turn-of-the-century novel brought for-
ward to the early 19305. “Bourgeois
morality is for me immoral and to be
fought,” Bunuel has stated, but what
we see here is less of an attack than
the spectacle of a sleek cat playing
with a mouse it can and will slay when
the mood takes it. The subject is
even treated with a certain sadistic
humor.
Celestine, a Parisian maidservant well
aware of her own weapons, takes a
job with a provincial family where she
deals expertly with the old proprietor’s
fetishism, the meanness and complaints
of his chilly daughter, the lecherous
desperation of his insignificant son-in-
law. She is less successful in coping
with a surly manservant whose banked-
up violence both repels and attracts
her.
It is not one of Bunuel’s major films
—it hasn’t the brutal harshness of
“Los Olvidados,” the kinky, macabre
humor of “The Exterminating Angel,”
the curious lyricism of “Robinson
Crusoe”; but it is still impressive and
important. Jeanne Moreau, with her
cold, withdrawn expression and under-
stated playing, is an ideal actress for
his direction, with her correct domestic-
servant bearing only thinly masking
her insolent contempt; the atmosphere
of the provincial house and town,
where depravity and perversion
flourish behind a facade as respectable
and closed-in as Moreau’s, is conveyed
with deadly accuracy.
And there are some unmistakable
Bunuel images in the black-and-white
photography—Celestine politely sup-
pressing a yawn as the master of the
house lustfully fondles her booted feet,
the manservant joyfully and slowly
killing a bird for the table, or the

Not for sale!
Mr. David Gordon, company accoun-
tant came into our showroom the
other day, and was astonished when
we wouldn't sell him an Addo print-
ing calculator he saw there.
Wanted to know why we had a
machine on display if it wasn't for sale.
We explained, that although it was
for sale, there were 17 other models
in Remington's Addo range and
one of these might prove far better
for his particular needs.
And sure enough after talking
about the type and volume of work
Mr. Gordon's department handled
we found the Addo machine that
suited his needs exactly.
Which shows that there is always
a best Addo machine from the
range for your particular needs. This
is the one for sale !
You see, we aim to satisfy clients
the first time round. Can we add you
to the growing Remington list?

OPERA
The Best Ingredients for “Boris”
Boris Godc/unov, Moussorgsky. 11 Trova-
tore, Verdi. Elizabethan Trust Opera
Company. Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
ENOUGH is as good as a feast,”
as Moussorgsky may well have
said when cutting his second ver-
sion of “Boris Godounov” down to size.
With two rearrangements and re-
orchestrations by Rimsky-Korsakoff and
any number of later compromises be-
tween the four “original” versions, it
is surprising that an Australian pro-
ducer should have found the way to
make the feast better than enough.
John Young’s Boris contains almost all
of the two Moussorgsky versions in a
logical sequence of dramatic events
w/hich makes a lot more sense than
might be expected. Unfortunately, the
resulting feast was not cooked with the
best possible ingredients, though the
chef produced one or two very good
courses indeed.
“Boris Godounov” is a difficult opera
to produce, quite apart from having to
decide what to include and what to
leave out. If any opera needs realism
in its sets, it is this. But William Con-
stable’s original sketches of the scenery
only prove that as a stage designer
he is a fine painter. In execution the
sets simply do not fill the bill, in com-
plete contrast to the excellent bill-
filling done on the costume side by
unsung William Paterson (hidden care-
fully among Lux, Omo, and Hoover-
matic credits in the program) and the
creditable props by, presumably, the
stage director Peter Smith.
But “Boris” is Boris and the best
scenery in the world cannot save this
opera unless a fine acting bass is avail-
able to play the title role. Neil Warren
Smith is no Christoff or Chaliapin, but
his Boris can hold up his head in
better company than he is likely to find
in Australia. His magnificently con-
vincing death scene shows the heights
to which he can rise and he is helped
immeasurably by the finest diction I
have heard from an opera singer.
The rest of the cast has some strong
elements, though the company shows a
sad deficiency among the second-
stringers. Donald Shanks is an impres-
sive Pimen who will have little diffi-
culty in filling the shoes of Boris in
years to come. There is a fine Shuisky
from Allan Ferris and Robert Gard is
quite superb in the tiny, but most im-
portant role of the Simpleton. The
strong chorus (reduced?) is a credit
to the care the producer has obviously
lavished on it.
There will be arguments about the
two Polish scenes which Moussorgsky
added as an afterthought. They are
poles apart (no pun intended) from the
rest of the music but contain the score’s
most tuneful pages. Three first-class
singers could have made their inclusion
a great asset to the whole. Unfortun-
ately, the available cast is only just
passable. Rosina Raisbeck is very well
cast and sings with assurance. But her
lack of diction contrasts sharply with
the aristocratic bearing of her Princess.
Sergei Baigildin, as the false Dimitri,
has a fine voice and articulates his lines
with great care, but does not yet know'
how to use his assets to best effect.
Both he and Ronald Maconaghie
(Rangoni) are badly miscast and
destroy the dramatic illusion of these
scenes. The same cannot be said about
Alan Light’s Varlaam who clowns his
way through a clown’s role, but pays
no attention to the words and even less
to the conductor!
Moussorgsky’s original scoring gives
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra a
greater opportunity to shine in detail
than Rimsky-Korsakoff’s luscious slush
and Denis Vaughan makes the most of
this. Vaughan is probably as close to
a celebrity conductor as this company
Neil Warren Smith as Boris Godounov
in the Elizabethan Trust Opera Com-
pany’s production of the Moussorgsky
opera.
is ever likely to get and he justified
his presence in the pit to the full. (fj e
even played God Save the Queen as
though she really needed saving.)
Happily both orchestra and conductor
lavished just as much care on the much
maligned, so-called “simplicities” of
Verdi’s monumental conglomeration of
brilliant tunes, “II Trovatore.”
Trovatore contains more known arias
duets, and ensembles than any other
opera. Its tunes led the hit parades of
our great-great-great-grandfathers with-
out the help of radio, publicity, or payola
and their appeal to the unsophisticated
is as great today as then. To serious
music lovers they have the added charm
of old friends one likes to meet again
and again—and again. (Musical snobs
are not rated as music lovers in my
book.) Verdi wrote a singers’ opera
and the Trust is lucky to have real
singers to ensure its success. Donald
Smith, an authentic star import for
once, will not mind taking second place
to Lauris Elms’ astonishing Azucena.
Legitimately ignoring the fallacy that
the gypsy is an old hag, she presents a
virile personality with that necessary
streak of madness which makes her the
key to the whole opera. Vocally she
ranks with the best which could be
expected in any opera house anywhere
today and I can only regret that after
this she must inevitably be snapped up
overseas, a loss the Trust cannot afford.
The other two principals are not in
the same street but are far from bad.
Rosemary Gordon produces a well-sung
Leonora without interpolated top notes,
obviously cut due to her inability to
reach them rather than any attempt to
stick to original scores. But no notes
are good notes when their advent could
be the harbinger of doom and the lack
of strain in what Leonora does sing is a
refreshing change. Alexander Major
(di Luna) failed to produce his adver-
tised bel canto but showed that he can
belto in the right places. Lastly, Donald
Shanks made a resonant Ferrando, not
as good as his Pimen, but a positive
asset to the evening.
With singers like these the produc-
tion is of minor importance. Producer
Stephan Beinl failed to add to the
excitement in any fashion. He was not
helped by an incredible all-purpose set
which looks brilliant in one or two
scenes but usually leaves the singers
clambering all over and under what
looks suspiciously like two of the sails
off the Sydney Opera House. It is little
short of miraculous that they are not
put off by their mountaineering acti-
vities. Fortunately, the best uses of the
set ocur in the last scenes and the
excitement generated by all principals
(led magnificently by Donald Smith)
in the last scene of all will undoubtedly
produce more of the spontaneous audi-
ence demonstrations w'hich crowned the
Sydney opening.
A delightful, if unintentional, touch
of comedy was provided by the audi-
ence’s rising reverently to the opening
drum roll of the score. This put every-
one into a good mood and is an innova-
tion wLich should be retained.

BOOKS
Australia with Coffee
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The Australians. Robert B. Goodman
and George Johnston. T. H. Rigby.
$7.95.
Australian publishers seldom
“sell hard”: “The Australians” is
a notable exception to the rule.
It comes accompanied by a handsome
letter printed over the photograph of
a sundowner who appears on the dust
jacket, a letter that announces some
startling facts: the book took four years
to prepare and cost over 200,000 dol-
lars to produce (as much as a low-
budget motion picture); together with
the letter is a detailed account of the
volume’s making. Robert Goodman,
photographer for the National Geo-
graphic Magazine, became interested in
Australia when sent here on an assign-
ment in 1962; in 1963 he left his job
and brought his family here; and ever
since he has supported by a number
of firms travelled all over the
country, assembling a portrait of it
through American eyes. George John-
ston, “a writer with the knowledge,
experience, and literary ability to com-
plement and enhance the pictorial con-
tent,” was engaged to do the text.
Goodman amassed 300,000 photo-
graphs, out of which he selected 80
color and 96 black-and-white illustra-
tions.
The result is a book of very uneven
quality. Exciting at first glance, it ap-
pears rather cramped visually, on
further inspection: one can’t help feel-
ing that a larger format would have
been preferable, to give the pictures
that sense of release which Goodman’s
vision obviously cries out for. Too often,
the photographs seem to have been
squeezed to fit into the format,
squashed tight and jostled rather than
given the kind of shoulder-room they
need.
MR- GOODMAN’S is a very Ameri-
can vision, and he eloquently illus-
trates the parallels between the New
West here and the old one in his own
country. His opening photographs are
strikingly good: a dead ram on cracked
brown earth, the umber ridges of Simp-
son Desert sands like a gigantic
blanket, the eerie humped loneliness of
the Olgas, the marvellous abstract
shapes of the Finke River dunes, the
dazzling purple-and-crimson sky, gashed
with lightning, of the Northern Terri-
tory during a rain squall: this last is
among the greatest of all landscape
photographs, hauntingly empty and
Martian. From then on, Goodman
moves into a study of the Australians
as people; the influences Cartier-
Bresson here, Avedon there are
clear, but Goodman’s strong and sober
observations all his own.
The level, as I have said, is uneven:
there are inexplicable lapses: a photo-
graph of Dean Dixon conducting, which
would disgrace a publicity still; con-
ventional shots of a mother and daugh-
ter at the Radio School of the Air
class; an ordinary aerial photograph of
downtown Sydney; a dull evocation of
a Government House garden party; and
a stodgy photograph of the Opera
House. Yet, elsewhere, there are superb
achievements, only occasionally marred
by the quality of the printing. The
man leaning against a veranda post
in south-west Queensland against a
blazing russet-and-orange sky is worthy
of a composition by the great American
cameraman Lee Garmes; the shot of the
sheep-drover reminds one of some of
the great Steichen or Cartier-Bresson
portraits of Americans; the bush
policeman, too, is a photograph in the
American mainstream.
The shot of station hands after the
Leura races evokes with startling vivid-
ness a life of leathery austerity and
humor among the beer bottles. Richard
Avedon-like furred and furbelowed
women swoop on a Melbourne theatre;
a survivor of the goldrush talks amid
the clutter of the past against an up-
right piano crowded with photographs
of Hill End; migrants arrive taut with
worry and strain, and others are seen,
relaxed and untidy, New Australians
already at Silver Lake, S.A. And per-
haps finest of all, in the chapter on
The Land Builders, Goodman conveys
an unforgettable sense of powerful
machinery, stretched muscles, and
dazzling produce, symbols of the
greatest of Australian dramas the
wrenching of sustenance from the un-
willing soil of the continent. It is a
struggle again symbolised in the fine
images of science, from the fathomless
blue eye of the air seen through the
radio-telescope at Parkes to the plant
in a glass phial at the Canberra Photo-
tron; indicators of a startling range of
practical achievement.
George Johnston’s text seems to me
in every way less satisfactory than the
images. Early on there is some good
descriptive writing, a strong feeling for
the outback comes through, and there
is a useful chapter to go with Good-
man’s images of science. But in many
ways Mr. Johnston’s writing falls down
badly. Discussing the economy, he fails
to point out just how intimately we
are still here involved with Britain,
and he repeats the fallacy that Japan,
not Britain, is our greatest trading
customer; the suggestion that we are
turning more and more to the Orient
seems to me true, but I would say that
the young people are still largely dis-
interested: who of them prefers to g 0
to Tokyo rather than to London? &
In his chapter on the arts, Mr. John-
ston quite fails to take into account
the persisting and profound colonial
attitude of so many artists here, and
their lack of a sense of national pride
He hasn’t touched on the appalling
mutual ignorance among creative
people, who tend to be far'better in-
formed about British or American
artists than they are about each other.
Moreover, he compounds this state of
affairs by making an error of disastrous
proportions: he omits all but a passing
reference to Patrick White, unquestion-
ably the greatest genius this country has
produced; and that Mr. Goodman has
not seen fit to include a photograph of
Mr. White is also an absurdity. T 0
ignore this superb writer and then to
ask where the giants are is to display
a startling lack of perspicacity on Mr.
Johnston’s part.
SIMILARLY, every poet with the ex-
ception of Judith Wright is omitted:
no reference to the fact that, apart from
Charles Tomlinson, A. D. Hope is the
only non-American poet to have ac-
quired a large reputation in the United
States since Dylan Thomas. Richard
Meale, by far the most inventive and
advanced of Australian composers, goes
unphotographed. Publishing and archi-
tecture should have been dealt with
at length: why not surveys of the work
of Dusseldorp, Seidler, Utzon, creators
of a new Australia? And why no
analysis of the work of the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust and the ABC-
central (if not always welcome) facts
of our artistic existence?
In the field of politics, Charles
Perkins, too, should have figured; and
the opportunity to bring to life for the
first time in pictures and print the
major political and religious figures has
been sadly fluffed. Where are the prob-
ing shots, the verbal analyses of Menzies,
Whitlam, Calwell, Gilroy, Holt? By
stripping the country of its religion
and politics, Johnston and Goodman
deprive it of half its life; and John-
ston’s comments on our social structure
are sadly inadequate and unsophisti-
cated in an era of Galbraith, Wright
Mills, and Riesman. Unlike Pringle and
Horne, Johnston fails to take account
of our central problem: can we move
into the realm of high achievement
while still retaining a levelling egali-
tarian casualness and parsimony?
But perhaps one shouldn’t be too
hard on the text: this may well have
been intended as nothing more than
the biggest Press release in Australian
history, a blurb for us to gobble.
Coffee-table books are normally in-
tended to be dipped into, not read in
depth; the regret one has is that so
skilled a professional writer as George
Johnston has too often forsaken de-
tailed analysis for ripe description.


In the Inferno
By R. M. WILDING
Doomsday Morning. Wynwode Reid.
Rigby. $2.75.
You Can’t Come Back. Bruce Beaver.
Rigby. $2.25.
BOTH of these novels are set in
Australian country towns. In
one the town is finally des-
troyed, in the other the town is thank-
fully left. Neither of the authors puts
forward any case for idyllic rural exist-
ence, for homogeneous communities;
there is no nostalgia or sentimentalism
for a better way of life outside the
capital cities. In “Doomsday Morn-
ing” two characters look down from a
hill “at the straggling little township
below them in the valley. It looked
mean and huddled, even smaller than
it was. Not a ghost town, but a town
in decay, rotting, yet still alive.” That
is the way these towns are seen; “Peyton
Place” has been built in Australia.
Wynwode Reid’s first novel is a very
professional production. The opening
—“Fear came to Alba like pollen on
the wind”—misrepresents the tone of
the rest of the book. Attempts at
purple prose are forgotten, and we are
given instead the much more satisfac-
tory, much less pretentious straight-
forward account of how the town of
Alba is condemned to destruction as it
lies on the site of a proposed dam. The
dam is needed to irrigate the district;
Alba has nothing to recommend it; a
few old people remain living there—but
most of the inhabitants make little
objection to leaving; the compensation
is good. The old ones, though, have
nowhere to go; a committee is formed
to attempt to get the dam resited.
The action of the novel mainly re-
volves round Redgate, a man with a
past, alone, who has taken a P.R. job
and arrives in Alba to try to persuade
the few defiant ones to sell out their
property to the Government. He settles
down to work slowly. And eventually
the dam is built. Not before various
complications, however. Before Red-
gate’s arrival a con-man petty criminal
has been hiding in Alba and sees a
way of raising money from the protest
committee; Tom Pitty, the shopkeeper,
tries to persuade his successful poli-
tician son to help the protest; Redgate
himself has an encounter with the beau-
tiful daughter of one of the town’s
dying inhabitants the beautiful
daughter who has tried a theatre
career but hasn’t quite succeeded.
,r pHERE are continual surprises in the
action of “Doomsday Morning”; in-
deed right till the last couple of pages
new suspense is developed, different
crises are resolved. There are not any
surprises in the characters, though; the
near recluse schoolmaster, kindly,
gentle, felt to be odd by the towns-
people; the religious mother looking
after her daughter’s illegitimate son and
pretending it is hers; the undutiful suc-
cessful son in Canberra; the madwoman
looked after by her sister. All the soap-
opera ingredients are here; only the
absence of an uplift ending makes it
not typical of its genre. It is a fully
competent entertainment.
“You Can’t Come Back” lacks this
professional competence. It seems to
value itself too highly to claim to be
more than an entertainment. Bruce
Beaver has chosen a notoriously diffi-
cult form the first person colloquial
narration. Bernie is a young railway
laborer working in a gang that has just
arrived in a New South Wales country
town. But his personality is not estab-
lished by the liberal use of the vernacu-
lar “busted our guts,” “niggly,”
“some poor, stupid clot,” “whacking
great slope.” It is hard to use slang
successfully for an entire book and
instead of a linguistic richness we have
the awful sameness of a recorded con-
versation. Bruce Beaver has cut himself
off from most of the resources of the
language and this is especially un-
fortunate, as he is much admired as a
poet. Certainly, it could be argued that
Bernie is a dull and conventional, in-
articulate character but the novelist’s
job is also to sustain interest as well as
to produce verisimilitude. There is far
more art in “Huckleberry Finn” and
“The Catcher In the Rye” than their
easy demotic might suggest.
Yet “You Can’t Come Back” does
have a distinctive flavor. Bernie’s
mates in the gang are not very well
established (the first person narration
and its concomitant breathless, throw-
away incoherence probably are to blame
again) but Bernie’s own involve-
ment with the half-Indian girl, Jean, is,,
anyway, the centre of this short novel.
Simply, it is a story of betrayal; Jean,
it seems at the end, is not, as Bernie
hoped, the only virgin in Clifton, but
yet another part-time whore. And he
has fallen in love with her.
Error and redemption are the terms
that Bernie seems to think in and
the author, too. There is not a great
deal of distance between Bernie and
his creator, and this limits the novel’s
success. But a further problem is that
Bernie seems as neurotic about sex
when he arrives in Cooma as when he
meets Jean. All the beddings are
squalid and it is not clear whether
this is just Bernie’s obsessive world
picture that we are meant to evaluate
or one endorsed by his creator.
It is a picture, though, that is
firmly established. And the images of
flowing middle-aged female flesh,
mother and daughter at home to visi-
tors in their shack in the bottle-collec-
tors’ yard, the aboriginal girls wander-
ing the streets at night looking for
rides from truckies, Norma with her
black moustache that catches the beer
froth all these create a powerful
Australian Inferno. No wonder Bernie
drinks too much.
The Reverend Charles Wadsworth Visits Emily Dickinson
In regular Amherst it is cool dusk.
Crunched gravel on the path spells out
The tread of careful Wadsworth.
One ring sharp, Presbyterian
And he is in the parlor.
Emily in white brightens the dark plush,
Avian and aphoristic.
The poems upstairs are tight in their packets,
But Emily, circumspect, circles the spirit
That Wadsworth lodges in his words.
Sherry is poured.
Questions are warm and gentle;
For her there is no move closer to Christ
Than this. Wadsworth, adviser and Master.
He leans forward with drained glass
For departure. The door tolls
Its tiny bell by accident.
Emily watches from behind the curtain.
The last brown drops of sherry
That startle the dull light
Are in her eye; the color
Of pale September, when Wadsworth
Moves across the continent,
Too distant for Comfort.
The poems climb in their packets:
The boy sings by the burying-ground,
Afraid.

Pitchforks in Paddington
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Period of Adjustment. D. H. Crick. Aus-
tralasian Book Society. $2.75.
THIS is the third published novel
of D. H. Crick and is the winner
of the Mary Gilmore Centenary
Award. It is prefaced by a quotation
from Karl Marx and another from Bob
Dylan.
“Period of Adjustment” is a serious
novel, w'ell thought out and w-rit-
ten. I was afraid when I started read-
ing the book that the political theorist
might take over from the creative
writer. However, this does not occur.
Harold Furnley is the son of an
industrialist, whose success in industry
has been contributed to by World War.
11. Harold’s father has great plans for
Harold and is about to establish a new-
industry wflth Harold in charge which
will set the seal of success on the Furn-
ley empire. However, these plans take
everything into account but Harold,
who is the product of a different period
and way of thinking. Harold is sensitive
but unimaginative. When younger he
liked to play what his father described
as “that damned flute.” Harold lacks
the drive of his father and has never
been able to do anything with his
sensitivity and intelligence. Anne, his
fiance, is more intelligent and domi-
neering than he is, and makes him
feel like a cultural hanger-on.
Then he meets Sue Campion, the
daughter of a lowly foreman employed
by his father wLo resents Sue’s rela-
tionship with Harold because he is
a stick in the mud, proud of his own
position as a foreman, and resentful of
change.
Furnley’s, the business, is the brood-
ing presence throughout the book,
Furnleys, the abstract devourer of men,
expanding, ramifying, sacrificing the
human element on the altar of
efficiency. It is a dramatic moment
when the machines of Furnleys stop
and the reactions of all the chief
characters are described with skill.
Don Crick has created a very tight
and efficient plot. Harold’s father is not
presented as an evil industrialist but
as an intelligent, skilful manipulator
of people and social forces, a man with
a vision, even if the vision is ultimately
dehumanising. The tone of the book is
humorless and a trifle grim.
I myself ultimately differ with Don
Crick’s viewpoint. I do not think that
social stratification is necessarily a bad
thing, as it adds to the varieties of ex-
perience and texture of a society. In
so far as social stratification pauperises
people and deprives them of food and
clothing, it is obviously evil, but in out-
own society this is not the case. Social
stratification produces situations of con-
flict, but situations of conflict I feel
are a necessary ingredient of life. With-
out such situations of conflict this novel
would not have been written.
The cover design by \ Rod Shaw
neatly illustrates the author’s theme of
a young man finding himself and
rejecting dehumanising values.
The Old Survivor
By RAY EVANS
My Years in the Communist Party.
Ralph Gibson. International Bookshop.
30c.
WHEN Cecil Sharpley w'rote of
his experiences in the Austra-
lian Communist Party (“The
Great Delusion”), he had this to say
of Ralph Gibson: “He had always im-
pressed me as a sound idealist, and the
personal sacrifices he gladly made for
the Communist cause commanded my
respect. His father was Professor of
Philosophy at Melbourne University
and he himself graduated at both Mel-
bourne and Sheffield Universities
... If the Communists ever rule Aus-
tralia I expect they will eventually
hang Gibson.”
Regrettably, but predictably, Gibson
is not nearly as kind to Cecil Sharpley
. . . “He had led a loose personal life,
he was drinking too much, he had been
borrowing freely.” But Gibson’s book
validates Sharpley’s evaluation.
The book will be read in Australia
primarily for its comment on domestic
affairs. This is generally disappointing.
There is no mention of intra-party
struggles, but there are a few tasty mor-
sels for the student of the peace and
cultural fronts. For instance: “The Vic-
torian and Tasmanian Conference
of the Methodist Church in March,
1953, called without a single dis-
senting voice for ‘an immediate halt
to bloodshed in Korea.’ ” It would
be interesting to know who organised
that display of unanimity. And then
there was the three-day Citizens’ Con-
ference on Peace and Disarmament
organised by the Ministers’ Peace Quest
Forum in 1952. Gibson notes, “The
only contribution (on this occasion)
calculated to fan hatred of Russia,
China, and North Korea was that of
Lord Lindsay of Birker. After this
gentleman finished his long rambling
discourse, Dr. Burton swept to the plat-
form and demolished him in two min-
utes. Neutral, Left Wing, and progres-
sive Catholic viewpoints were expressed
in a useful symposium on Disarmament
conducted by the Rev. Palmer Phillips,
Dr. Lloyd Churchward, and Mr.
Vernon Rice of the Newman Society.”
After 30 years as a Soviet apologist,
Ralph Gibson must be asking himself
if it has been worth it at all. As far
as the younger generation are con-
cerned, the answer seems to be no.
At a Fabian Society Forum recently,
Rex Mortimer did not mention the
Soviet Union once. But as George
Orwell pointed out (“Inside the
Whale”) when you have got rid of such
“primal things as patriotism and reli-
gion you have not necessarily got rid
of the need for something to believe in.
Patriotism, religion, empire, military
glory—all in one word, Russia. Father,
king leader, hero, saviour—all in one
word, Stalin. So after all the Com-
munism of the English (and Austra-
lian) intellectual is something explic-
able enough. It is the politics of the
deracinated.”
Ralph Gibson has clearly appreciated
this fact. Rex Mortimer will also have
to recognise that you cannot build a
tightly knit semi-conspiratorial political
group on propositions such as the
inability of capitalism to solve the
social problems of the computer age.


a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vita! part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You’ll be
pleasantly surprised.
Irregulars
By R. GILLESPIE
S()K in France: An Account of the Work
of the British Special Operations
Executive in France, 1940-1944.
VI.R.D. Foot Fler Majesty’s Stationery
Office. London, 1966. $7.
HERE. in the form of an official
history, is the narrative of intri-
cate and dangerous underground
resistance waged, outside the frame-
work of more orthodox operations dur-
ing World''Wat 11, for the libera-
tion of franco from Hitler and
the Nazis. The author had the ad-
vantage of Inditing alongside Special
Operations Executive, without being
involved in its activities; so his ex-
amination of its work is eompletelv
objective. He is a professional his-
torian, was allowed access to what re-
mains of the London arc hives of SOL.
and was able to supplement this In
further research, limited onlv In the
secrecy in - which the book was pre-
pared. The result is impressive- and
timely.
At its peak, in 1944,' SOE reached
a strength of nearlv 10,000 men and
about 3200 women, equal in numbers
to a weak division. It has been agreed
by German leaders, as well as In those
of the Allies, that its effort shortened
the war in Europe by about six months.
Certainly no single formation of
equivalent strength in any army exerted
anything like this disproportionate in-
fluence on the course of the war. Such
prowess deserves chronicle. Vet, until
Mr. Foot’s volume was published, no
account of SOE’s work comparable to
an ordinary regimental history had ap-
peared in English.
There- has been publicity enough
about secret operations in France, but
it has generally been piecemeal and
often ill-informed. Some former agents
who took part in operations have writ-
ten honest accounts. Others, seeking
to protect or inflate their reputations,
have not stuck so faithfully to accuracy
sometimes, no doubt, because of the
emotional strain wdiich is inseparable
from work of this kind. Again, many
of the more important doings of SOE
have not, until now, been mentioned at
all, because those who took part in
them failed to return. At the same
time, authors have been attracted by
the dramatic episodes which were
bound, by the nature of the service, to
befall men and women operating be-
hind the enemy’s lines. It is a happy
hunting-ground for writers of thrillers.
This is w'here Mr. Foot’s work is in-
valuable in its complete and dispassion-
ate examination of the whole field of
SOE’s activities from the time of its
formation until France liberated.
The narrative does not gloss over
failures, like the “run of errors” in
1943-44, wdiich brought disaster, but
Miere the names of Jack Agazarian,
Charles Grover-Williams, and Noor
fnayat Khan stand out for heroism.
Stories of success, like that of Armada,
the brilliant team of RF canal
saboteurs, or of the final French out-
burst which SOL led in 1944, make
clear how much can be done by clandes-
tine forcers in sabotage and disruption
of enemy communications and how
valuable these forces are in war.
What Mr. Foot has done, in his rea-
soned analysis of a series of military
operations which cannot help reading
like an adventure story, is best summed
up in his own words.
"People who have not faced the
perils of clandestine agents live among
are not well placed to pronounce on
the agents merits. Like any other
body of irregulars, the survivors of
SOE's agents face the world with
private knowledge, that the world
cannot share, of what they went
through. They know which of them-
selves were any good, who should and
who should not be wearing which
medals; they know", but they cannot be
expected to say, as Longfellow said of
the sea, ‘Only those who brave its
dangers comprehend its mystery.’ ”


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Banking Fringe
THE far-reaching further implications of Reserve Bank
approval for the lead by the Bank of N.S.W. into the
unsecured personal loans business, in direct competition
with the hire-purchase companies, are even more important
than the move itself. The approval rests on an assurance by
the Wales that the move into personal loans at 6 percent flat
(equal to about 10| percent reducible) will not affect the
capacity of the banks to provide normal overdraft accom-
modation at percent to its customers.
How', then, is the Wales going to' finance the scheme?
There can be no doubt that any diversion of existing bank
resources, for which the demand already far exceeds the
supply, would have serious implications for the community,.
apart from going against the spirit of the Reserve Bank
approval.
In this respect the timing of the Wales request was
exquisite. It could back its strong case for the banks being
allowed to lend more for personal borrowers by the fact that
the Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, wants personal consumption
expenditure to rise. These personal advances, of up to
$lOOO with two years to pay and no questions about
uses, sound just the thing to help the ailing motor-car and
appliance markets. In these circumstances, it would not be
unreasonable for the Reserve Bank to expect that some of the
future releases it may make from SRDs as liquidity pres-
sures arise may well go into these personal loans, as should
a fair proportion of the seasonal increase in liquids at present
under way.
But now that the first move has been approved, the most
striking possibility is that the trading banks could finance
their personal loans by entering the unsecured note and
debenture markets in competition with the hire-purchase
houses. Neither the Reserve Bank nor the Bank of N.S.W,
will be drawn on this point. There is no doubt that cash
borrowed from the public this way, being capital raisings,
would not be a part of the ratios of deposits to advances that
the Reserve Bank regulates through its SRD mechanism
and so would provide the banks with cash for lending that
would be as far outside the Reserve Bank’s control as are the
unrestricted lending operations of the h.-p. companies.
Of course this would be dearer money than the banks
can now attract on interest-bearing deposits—but not much
dearer. And in view of the financial strength of the banks
there would be little need to go in for the longer term
borrowings at higher interest rates that the h.-p. companies
must seek to cover their longer lending component. The
banks could finance their whole operation on cheap, short-
term notes or debentures in a borrowing-short-lending-longer
operation effectively underwritten by their own massive
resources.
But the Wales’ move is a major departure, not only
because it forces the Reserve Bank to recognise the banks’
rights to enter the “non-banking” uncontrolled area of money
and compete with its new rivals there, but it also provides a
better deal for personal borrowers who have been very badly
treated by the banks, due, one gets the impression, largely
to the strong pressures from the Reserve Bank on the
monetary system. As far as can be judged from the latest
figures put out by the Reserve Bank (which are indefensibly
more than nine months out of date!) the proportion of bank
advances going to personal borrowers had fallen from 17
percent to little better than 15 percent over 12 months, while
personal deposits as a proportion of all deposits went up
from 30 percent to more than 32 percent. At the same time
MEN AND MATTERS
NEW SOUTH WALES can bank
on hearing more of Mr. F. J.
(John) Darling, who on Septem-
ber 5 took over from Mr. John Self as
director of the State’s employers’ feder-
ation. He has been an employers’ man
since leaving school 31 years ago, mov-
ing through the Western Australian
organisation from office boy to deputy
director. The only break to this pattern
was his war service; he was among the
AIF men pinned down on Crete by
German Stukas, and had three fingers
shot off before being taken a POW.
John Darling has proved himself a
man with a flair for controversy. 'He
has two sets of manners, one extremely
genial, the other so much in contrast
that opponents hold him in awe. He
is implacably opposed to the strike
weapon and his forthrightness in such
cases leaves the air blue and faces red.
His strength of conviction on other
issues has also been the fuse to power-
kegs. Many skilled migrants viewed
him as an ogre for his attitude to
their grievances when they believed
they had been brought in to provide
a potentially unemployed labor pool.
He was the strong man on a panel
which underwrote W.A.’s development
by going it alone to recruit needed
skills. And this angered the Common-
wealth so much that they diverted
planeloads of Spaniards to the eastern
States; the result-
ant mess caused
Spain to shut the
door on migration
to Australia.
After forcing
unions away from
direct action to
arbitration, he has
become architect
for many new in-
dustrial agreements
that have brought
about big savings
to Western Australian employers, par-
ticularly in the metal trades whose
unions’ militancy has lost much of
its edge. No doubt this has been the
kind of strength Sydney employers have
considered in appointing him to their
key position.
Satellites and cables fin the
world of dapper Indian-born Dr.
Manchar Sarwate, the secretary-
general of the International Communi-
cations Union, who was on a short visit
to Melbourne last week for the opening
of the Union’s conference, at which
about 150 delegates from 28 countries
will spend the next six weeks sorting
out world communications problems.
A good many delegates looked
awfully like post office officials. Indeed
Dr. M. Sarwate
F. J. Darling
P. J. Self
we met Dr. Sarwate in the chairless
spaces of our greying Federal Director-
General of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr.
T. A. Housley, who after all these
years also hasn’t got around yet to
putting chairs or stools in Australian
post offices (have you noticed?).
But Dr. Sarwate himself is not a
postman. He is now very distinctively
an international civil servant living in
Geneva. His first love is electronics,
which he studied in Indian and British
universities before serving with research
establishments at Farnborough (RAF)
and Swanage and then as Squadron-
Leader in the Indian Air Force. After
a distinguished career in the Indian
Civil Service he was appointed deputy-
secretary of the ITU seven years ago
and secretary last year.


advances to businesses rose to 82 percent of all advances,
while businesses contributed only 57 percent of deposits.
This reply by the Wales on the personal front follows a
striking increase in the role of h.-p. companies in the business
financing area, with leasing, factoring, discounting, and
straight financing for business filling the gap left by the
shortage of cheaper bank accommodation, due, so the banks
claim, mainly to Reserve Bank policies.
One of the leaders in the move into business financing has
been Australian Guarantee Corporation, in which the Wales
has a 40 percent shareholding interest. It may be significant
that the Wales has chosen to fight back at the h.-p. houses
in an area where AGC is probably proportionally least
involved of all the major h.-p. companies—personal loans.
But the bad-tempered comment from Custom Credit that
“The Wales should stick to wholesaling money and leave us
to do the retailing,” indicates that the Wales move has struck
a tender nerve in at least one h.-p. house which specialises in
personal loans.
An Underwriting Marriage
MOST of the discussion on next month’s $3 million
debenture issue by IBM has been about the prin-
ciples involved in foreign companies raising money
here, the Reserve Bank’s “guidelines” approach, and how
the rise in overseas interest rates has removed the “too
costly” tag from the Australian money markets.
But perhaps the most intriguing thing about this issue
is that it is being jointly underwritten by the Sydney brok-
ing house of Ord Minnett, T. J. Thompson and Partners,
and the Melbourne merchant banker Australian United
Corporation.
There is nothing unusual about a broking house joining
with a merchant bank in an underwriting; AUC and lan
Potter and Co., or Ord Minnett and Darling and Co. make
regular joint appearances, for Potters and AUC are very
closely tied together and Ords have shareholding and direc-
torial links with Darlings. But IBM has managed to get
both these groups working for it without hiring rival
enterprises, by aligning the broking side of one with merchant
banking bit of another.
The big local groups like these have been getting a fair
volume of business out of the changed arrangements com-
panies have had to make following the Johnson and Wilson
restraint measures on export of capital. Not only do they
get the job of raising money here, they also can handle
those cases where the measures mean that foreigners have
to withdraw, such as last week’s sale by Spillers of the U.K.
of its large Allied Mills holdings, which were partly dis-
posed of in Australia and partly in London.
Record Wheat Crops
WESTERN AUSTRALIA’S reign as our top wheat-
producing State is going to be short; not even the 20
percent expected rise in W.A.’s record wheat crop
this season will prevent N.S.W. recovering the crown it lost
for the first time in last year’s drought.
The good rains in N.S.W. have set the scene for a record
N.S.W. harvest, with so many graziers putting in wheat for
a quick cash crop to help get them out of their drought-
induced money problems and to help finance some re-
stocking. So Australia’s wheat crop looks like exceeding
400 million bushels this year for the first time. With about
60 million bushels likely to go into home consumption, this
should leave 340 million available for export, worth just
on $2OO million almost double last season’s exports of
180 million bushels.
Last season the West helped compensate for the drought
effects by setting new figures with 97 million bushels of
wheat delivered and 6 million retained for seed. This was
from 6 million acres planted, and this season plantings have
been lifted to around 6.8 million acres.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Treasurer, Mr.
W. McMahon, believes Australia’s economic prospects
are brighter than they were three months ago and in
areas other than motors “particularly bright” ... A
smooth expansion of the public sector and greater will-
ingness in community spending are still necessary, the
ANZ Bank maintains.
Commonwealth Government revenue for July and
August totalled $553.2m., a s24m. drop on the corres-
ponding two months in 1965; expenditure rose by
$73.6m. to $808.5m. . . . Imports reached a peak
monthly level of $294.1m. in August, mainly an after-
math of the U.K. seamen’s strike; exports were very-
satisfactory at $247.3m., to leave current deficit $46.8m.
Closing wool prices could not hold gains made early
in the week ... New quarantine regulations for cheese
are not intended to hinder imports since “quarantine
is entirely divorced from economics,” according to the
Commonwealth Department of Health.
For the markets: Practically all industrial sec-
tions on Australian share markets are displaying unease;
indeed, the end of the week showed a wide lack of
buyer interest. Metals issues are the only ones to furnish
a degree of stimulus. The leaders have become erratic
again and BHP in particular has suffered because of a
feeling that Boral may sell some of its holding to
finance the Bayview takeover.
Another edgy week saw a slight advance in London
stemmed by ICl’s lower profit, unaltered dividend, and
announcement of a £stg.6om loan issue . . . President
Johnson is seeking to suspend the 7 percent investment
tax and faster depreciation; Wall Street was mildly
pleased overall, but its blue chips continue to drift.
For companies: A proposal by directors of
F. W. Williams to liquidate, distribute the AC I shares
and form another company failed to achieve sufficient
shareholder approval; Martin Corporation has received
acceptance of its bid from 21 percent of the Williams’
shareholding . . . IBM Australia Ltd., now a public
company, is to make a local debenture issue in October
with Reserve Bank approval . . . Directors of Bayview
Quarries have accepted an enlarged cash bid at $2.20 a
50-cent share from Boral ... Financier Commercial
and General Acceptance (GAGA) has bought a 22.2
percent interest in men’s suit maker Anthony Squires
Holdings; the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney owns
40 percent of CAGA.
Short-term money market dealers are doing better
. . . AMP Discount Corporation brought profit from
$14,278 to $172,690 and doubled the 5 percent dividend
. . . Likewise Trans City Discount increased its portfolio,
shifting profit up by $37,756 to $67,268.
Other finance institutions were cheerful, too . . .
Electronic Industries’ A. & I. Discounters earned
$167,682 (previously $162,410), holding an 8 percent
dividend . . . Merchant banker and investor Develop-
ment Underwriting leapt from $212,936 to $315,365
and gently raised the payout from 7to percent .. .
Mercantile Mutual Insurance will make a 1-for-10
bonus without changing the 12| percent dividend; its
profit has gone up 9 percent on lower premium income
and improved underwriting surplus.
A varied bevy of textilers was mostly better . . .
Rayon maker Bruck Mills decided to lift dividend from
10 to 12| percent after earnings moved from $431,100
to $653,997 . . . Cotton spinner Bonds Industries
had no difficulty in raising dividend by 2 percent
to 12 percent following a record $1,139,761 profit, a
28.3 percent jump . . . Tasmania’s STP Holdings
retained a 12J percent payment on a $477,000 profit,
which represented a slightly lower earning rate of 26
percent (previously 28.8 percent) . . . Spinner and
weaver Yarra Falls turned a $465,652 loss into profits
of $48,368, but cannot manage any dividend ... In


CUSTOM CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED
Annual General Meeting , held on Friday , 2nd September , 1966
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Thirteenth Annual Directors’ Report, Balance Sheet
and Profit and Loss Account for the year ended 30th June,
1966, has been circulated. I presume you wish that these
be taken as read.
We welcome Mr. F. D. H. Beames, C.8.E., of Perth, who
has joined our Board of Advice in Western Australia and Mr.
C. A. Edwards, C.8.E., of Brisbane, to the Queensland Board
of Advice. Both gentlemen are well and favourably known
throughout Australia.
It is my pleasure to report another good year of progress
and an important period of strengthening profitability, pro-
visions and reserves. We have been able to expand investment
and promote a greater coverage of our services by opening
up new branches in important centres. This is the pattern
of our future endeavour so that diversification will continue
to broaden the base of the Company’s activities and augment
our resources.
You will note from the Consolidated Balance Sheet that
our Assets total $160,992,605, an increase of $8,205,171. I
want to say at the outset that this pleasing movement was
made possible mainly because of the support received from
Stock Exchange Brokers, the Shareholders and Investors who
demonstrated to a marked degree their faith in our Company
by increasing their holdings of Debenture Stock, Unsecured
Notes and Deposits by $5,944,545, to a total of $119,827,661.
An interesting feature in regard to this latter amount is that
amounts payable over the next two years are $67,833,701,
whereas over the same period our Receivables total
$130,872,535. This is a very satisfactory situation for both
Investors and the Company, more especially in view of the
high percentage of Debentures and Notes that are renewed,
as and when they mature, particularly at a time when there
is strong competition for fixed interest borrowings.
Other important features are the rise of $5,702,217 in
Gross Receivables which stand at $178,310,091, and the
increase of $2,463,743 in our cash, funds at call, and Govern-
ment Stocks and Bonds (since matured) which total $5,195,023.
There is, therefore, ample justification for believing that our
Company is in a thoroughly sound liquid condition and geared
to take advantage of the opportunities that will be available
during the current year for the acceptance, on a selective
basis, of the sound business that will be offering.
I should now like to refer to the trading result for the year
which showed a consolidated profit of $2,942,418 after taxation
of $2,166,093. The increase in profit was $556,262 (after
providing for an increase of $313,695 in taxes) which repre-
sents a rise of 23.3% for the year and is equivalent to an
earning rate of 20.1% on Ordinary Capital.
A satisfactory feature is, that although there was a sub-
stantial rise in volume over the year, the amount of debts
written off was slightly lower than last year. This confirms
the efficiency of our Management and reflects creditably upon
the selection and control of accounts.
You will today be asked to approve the payment of our
year’s final dividends and we can now turn our attention to
the appropriations of the remaining profit. It has been decided
to allocate $BOO,OOO to General Reserve, a further $500,000
to the Provision for Doubtful Debts and increase the amount
carried forward to $847,146.
After allowing for a small adjustment of $34,268 in Capital
Reserve, following the winding up of Liverpool Finance Ptv.
Ltd. and Darling Point Pty. Ltd. (two wholly owned subsidiary
companies which had served their purpose), the total Reserves
and Retained Profits is $6,453,838 and our Provision for
Doubtful Debts $2,012,500.
In making these appropriations your Board is continuing
the policy of consolidating the Company’s financial structure
and thereby strengthening the protection offered our Deben-
ture and Note holders as well as the capital investment of
our Shareholders. I am sure you will appreciate the merit
in this policy.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, National and General
Insurance Co. Limited, is continuing the trend of satisfactory
expansion and with increased premium income, it now ranks
among the leading Australian Insurance Companies. This is
reflected in the improved results of the net profit for the year
ended 30th June, 1966, at $411,697 (tax $272,221) compared
with $212,152 (tax $214,272) in 1965. It is gratifying to
observe a profit on underwriting, which marks ability and
efficiency.
The sound growth of this and other wholly owned Aus-
tralian Insurance Companies should leave no one in doubt
that they possess the necessary skills to compete with and
match the service of those operating here under overseas con-
trol. Consequently, I make no apology for saying that there
is a real need for a much greater awareness by the public
generally of the benefits that can accrue to the Australian
economy, if our locally owned Companies were to receive a
larger share of Australian risks. I suggest that this is some-
thing that should be better appreciated by all sections of
the community because, in my opinion, far too much money
is lost to Australia bv the flow of funds to overseas controlled
companies, with the resultant adverse effect upon our Balance
of Payments position. Your Company is fully conscious of
this and will appreciate the support of all Shareholders and
those associated with us in business to contribute towards a
change in this situation.
So far as our Organisation as a whole is concerned, your
Board and the Management believe in keeping close to our
business in all States. Accordingly, and following an earlier
successful meeting in Brisbane, the Board met in Perth in
June last. These visits enable the Board to have on-the-spot
discussions with our State Boards of Advice, directly assess
the progress and efficiency of our local administration in the
particular State, learn at first hand the local trends and
developments, and assess the possibilities in relation to the
Company’s business generally. This direct contact with our
Local Boards, business friends, Civic and Public Leaders, and
many others, is invaluable to us. As a result, forward plan-
ning to provide services to meet the tremendous growth of
Western Australia and its potential is being undertaken. We
intend to continue this policy and Board meetings in other
States will take place at suitable times in the future.
In regard to the future prospects of the Industry, you may
feel assured that in our case your Board has been conscious
for some time of the possibility of even stronger competition
in the future. To meet this challenge action has already
been taken by broadening the base of our activities and in
the establishment of new branches at selected centres. This
enables us to extend our services in a variety of ways and
provide our facilities at points where it is economically
sound to do so. During the past year we have seen an increased
interest in our field of activity by some of our overseas friends
and, while we believe it to be in the best interests of Aus-
tralia to encourage the entry of capital and skills in certain
vitally important industries, it is, I suggest, nevertheless
equally important in those fields which are being efficiently
serviced by local enterprise, that control should remain locally.
The experience of the past 25/30 years has shown that
properly managed and controlled Australian financial institu-
tions providing funds for instalment payments have been
abreast of the needs of the community and have, in the
main, not only catered efficiently for all sections throughout
the Continent, but also assisted the overall development of
our Country to a very material degree.
This situation has received great help as the result of the
shareholder interest of the Banks, and in our own particular
case, you are well aware of the close association and valuable
assistance we receive at all times from The National Bank of
Australasia Limited, which owns 40% of our paid capital.
In looking forward to the future with confidence, your
Board realises that our best asset is the loyalty, efficiency and
team-work of our Management, Executives and Staff. There
has been ample evidence of this throughout the year, in
which they have been led so ably by the Chief General
Manager. For the energy and enterprise they have displayed,
which has been a major contribution to the excellent results
achieved, I, on behalf of the Board and the Shareholders,
thank them most sincerely.
LIONEL W. COPPLESON, Chairman.

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Butter States Its Claims
MRS. JONES’ frequent public
statements on behalf of the Mar-
rickville Margarine Company
have been subjected to critical review
in these columns. Now that the Dairy
Industry Council seems to be respond-
ing with a similarly lavish advertising
campaign, it is only fair that some of
their claims should be questioned, too.
First, it is extraordinary to claim that
quotas on margarine production are
part of general Government policy for
protecting local industry. The protec-
tion which butter gets at present is
quite unique. It is the only product
among tens of thousands of diverse
goods on sale in shops which is pro-
tected through restrictions on the manu-
facture of its chief competitor.
General Government policy for pro-
tection of local industry relies exclu-
sively on measures which discriminate
between the imported and the local
product. Tariffs on imports are, of
course, the most common, though a few
import controls and licences remain.
There are subsidies to local products to
give them a competitive advantage over
imports. Two-price schemes which
enable a marketing board to subsidise
export sales by charging local customers
a higher price than foreigners have the
same effect.
Butter gets all these types of protec-
tion against foreign competition and in
that sense it is not unique. It is unique
only in that it additionally gets protec-
tion against a local competitor.
The second proposition of the Dairy-
ing Council is that every bit of existing
protection is needed to ensure full
employment. One of the elements in
full employment, certainly, is the
general level of protection granted to
local industry. As long as adjustments
do not have to be made too quickly, the
protection granted to individual indus-
tries does not affect general employ-
ment. In any case, we live in an age
when there is no general lack of jobs.
To encourage industries which create
a lot of jobs is not only unnecessary but
disadvantageous. It is a negation of
everything aiming at higher productivity
—mechanisation, technical improve-
ment, managerial reform, the lot.
Thirdly, there is no threat to the
whole dairying industry. Most dairy-
farmers are well able to survive very
healthily with less than present pro-
tection.
The point remains that any changes
must be controlled. It is unreasonable
to expect any elected Government to
suddenly abandon quotas altogether,
desirable as that may be in the longer
term. A full-scale advertising campaign
to promote the sales of table margarine
might cause butter sales to drop off
sharply and cause dairy-farmers to go
out of business with unnecessary loss
and waste. The answer is a phased rais-
ing of quota levels, followed, say, six
years from now by an abandonment of
all quota restrictions.
In the meantime there have to be
quotas and they have to be enforced,
because among other things law enforce-
ment is the most elemental duty of
government.


Thinking about
new plant
expansion?
If so, you are probably thinking about the many complexities to be over-
come. The problems of design, of how to expand or modify an existing
plant or add process or plant capacity. Of how to effect these improve-
ments with the minimum interference to present plant output. The
problems are many and various, however on top of all of these factors
you’re undoubtedly concerned about getting the best value for your
construction dollar.
This is where we can help you, because this is one of the fields in which

After the Investigator
By CROESUS
POST-MORTEMS on company
crashes may seem a bit tiresome
and time-wasting when there is
so much fresh work to do on so many
more productive fronts. But if the
Crown thinks it right to put investiga-
tors into companies and those investiga-
tors come up with allegations of fraud,
weaknesses in company law, and
dubious accounting practices under-
lying losses of millions of money, their
revelations deserve the full treatment
by the courts, the legislatures, and the
professional bodies concerned.
Thus far, surprisingly few charges
have been laid in the courts; attempts
to reform the Companies Acts have
been fitful and uninspired; professional
bodies have been displaying holier-
than-thou attitudes towards cleaning out
the Augean stables. Let us be thank-
ful, then, that the Press refuses to take
its teeth out of the main issues,
I am not all that worried about the
small numbers of people brought to
book for their part in the crashes,
They are all marked men, few of them
can be dangerous losers of public
money in the future, and that is really
mostly what I’m concerned about here,
Our main attention should be focused
on seeing that new ones are balked,
Here I want to pose the question
whether it is not time to register
accountants and lay down standards to
which they must conform.
The text can be taken from the
interim report of the investigators into
the Reid Murray group dated March
25 last year, in which it was stated
that what appeared to the investigators
to be “indefensible” accounting
practices in Paynes Properties Pty. Ltd
were condoned by the company’s
auditors. All the practices instanced
had the effect of inflating book profits
on land deals. The cases cited in the
report concern property in Victoria
at Sydenham, Scoresby, Lower Plenty,
Metung, Deer Park, and Maribyrnong,
some of which the Receiver is still
trying to sell.
In the case of the 379 acres bought
at Sydenham in January, 1959, whose
eventual sale resulted in a loss of
£90,000 for Paynes, the company took
£22,540 profit to account in 1958-59
for a sale of part of it on a conditional
contract which was subsequently re-
voked when the condition was not met.
This case illustrates the effect of in-
flating profits which can result not only
from taking profits on conditional
sales when “the condition is not unlikely
to (and does) defeat the contract.” It
also illustrates the effect that can result
from capitalising holding costs, in par-
ticular inter-company interest payable
(but in this case not actually paid) on
funds borrowed (in this case presum-
ably from Reid Murray Acceptance) to
buy land.
involved a purchase of
land for £llO,OOO, also in January,
1959, for subdivision purposes. Selling
of subdivisional lots started in advance
of development and were conditional
on the plan of development being
sealed within 90 days. In 1958-59 and
1959-60, 77 and 65 lots respectively
were sold (on the condition) and
£26,558 and £20,520 were taken into
profits for those two years. Actually, the
plan of subdivision wasn’t sealed until
1962 and most of the contracts were
cancelled. By 1962, holding and de-
velopment expenses of £102,392 were
capitalised. The investigators say that
in their view no profits should have
been brought to account for 1958-59
and 1959-60 because of the nature of
the contracts of sale. They add that it
appears insufficient costs and expenses
were charged against sales in these
years.
Lower Plenty, where in February,
1959, Paynes bought 12 acres for
£16,100 and ultimately lost £20,000
and incurred inter-company interest
charges of £15,119 (unpaid but capital-
ised in Payne’s books), was another
example of the distorting effect of
capitalising holding costs. Metung,
where an area of 304 acres was
bought in December, 1959, illustrated
the need to keep a close watch on
book values of land in the light of
rescissions (ultimately one-third or
total sales), particularly land
holiday resorts where the completion
of contracts has generally proved un-

reiiable (Metung is in the Lakes En-
trance district). The investigators say
that about £50,000 of the £BO,OOO
brought into the accounts for 1959-60
on this estate “were the merest paper
profits, hoped for but never realised”
and added “we can only regard the
accounting practices which produced
this result with the deepest suspicion.”
Parkville was an instance of account-
ancy practice run mad. In June, 1959,
Paynes bought a block of land there
for £21,000 to build a block of Own-
Your-Own flats. Two firms of archi-
tects were employed to draw up plans.
Their fees of £17,000 or more were
capitalised. So was £5899 interest.
The building was never commenced.
The property was sold in October,
1963, for £22,000, making Paynes’ loss
on the project nearly £25,000. “We
cannot understand,’’ state the investiga-
tors, “how on any theory of capitalisa-
tion it can have been thought proper
to capitalise twm sets of architects fees.”
J)EER Park, where in August, 1959,
Paynes bought 1291 acres for
£122,611 for residential sub-division,
represents a slight variation on the
practice of taking profits into account
without making allowance for the pos-
sible non-completion of the contract, in
that in this case the subsequent pur-
chasers from Paynes proved to be
buyers of little substance. What hap-
pened was that, after buying the land
for residential sub-division, Paynes
couldn’t get the necessary permit for
this purpose, so split the land into five
lots which it sold in 1960 and 1961 on
long-term contracts, three being to
private companies of little substance.
Despite the fact that the investigators
expect this project ultimately to show'
a loss, £79,000 profit from it was taken
into the 1959-60 accounts.
Of course, the allegations in these
sample cases (there are plenty more
in the report) all relate to transactions
in land and building. These w'ere only
part of the widely diversified operations
of the group, but they were still a
big part. One can only guess at the
standards of accountancy and the degree
of false profit inflating in the rest.
What is more, although these low-
standards have been brought to light
in a company which has been forced
into liquidation, is it beyond the bounds
of possibility that up and down the
land in a variety of private as well as
public companies the standards are
any better? We simply do not know.
Neither will we have a chance to un-
less we get compulsory registration of
accountants and uniform standards in
the profession.
At the very least we can say, with
the Reid Murray investigators, that
w hile auditors accept company accounts
drawn up in accordance with the
practices revealed in that investigation,
h is not easy to see how the true
state of a company’s affairs can be
estimated from a perusal of its pub-
lished accounts.”

ONE OF THE WORLD’S 5 GREAT WHISKIES
J. C. HORSFALL'S MELBOURNE
Oil Rush in Bass Strait
THE surge in offshore drilling in
Victorian waters is not so remark-
able, perhaps, in view of the con-
siderable finds of oil and gas made
there by Esso-BHP in the past year,
but even two years ago few people
thought it was possible.
Next year five rigs will be drilling
for oil and gas off the Victorian coast,
so I was assured by oilmen down here
this week. Woodside (Lakes Entrance)
tell me that champagne will splash at
Newcastle in a week or two on the
5000-ton Zapata-ODE rig being fitted
at the State Dockyards there prepara-
tory to coming down to Gippsland for
spudding in Woodside’s first offshore
well four miles from the coast at Sea-
spray on December 1. I wish mv
father was alive to see this. He was one
of the first to look for oil in Gipp s .
land and that is going back fifty y ears
or more.
Also in eastern waters, the 5800-ton
Glomar 111 rig, now drilling an offshore
well there for Esso-BHP, will be joined
by a twin from the United States early
in the year and then by another, flying
the same partnership’s flag, whose
platform is now being constructed at
BHP’s Whyalla shipyards.
Dramas are still being enacted in
eastern waters, what with the boil-over
of the Esso-BHP No. 5 well the other
day. Everybody, especially specu-
lators in Woodside’s shares which have
rocketed since BHP struck oil in an
adjoining permit area earlier this year,
will be looking hopefully for success
around Seaspray. But what is more
intriguing to me is the prospect off the
coast of the rich western district. To
me it is astounding that Frome-Broken
Hill, which has for years held the
exploration permit for the whole of this,
has not up to now drilled out at sea,
JTROME - BROKEN HILL has been
virtually asleep these past few years,
The current fairy godmother of the area
is Shell Development, which by spend-
ing: $2 million in the Frome-Broken
Hill area, will gain a 25 percent in-
terest. rising to a half share when it
spends $4 million. The seriousness of
its intentions was sealed this week by
the company doubling its authorised
capital to $4O million and its an-
nouncement that a 8500-ton rig was
on its way from Japan under Shell’s
auspices to drill offshore around Port
Fairy.
One doesn’t have to be a mathema-
tician nor an Interstate Oil shareholder
to see that, as looks highly likely, if
Shell spends $4 million on its farm-in
with Frome, the other partners in the
venture, BP, Mobil, and Interstate, will
have their interests in it reduced to
about 15 percent each. Interstate Oil
is the Australian public’s only route of
entry into it.
Shell is earning its interest in the
area the hard way by spending mil-
lions, as it did in getting into Wapet,
a move which looks like paying off
now that Barrow Island has come good
and promising finds have been made
in other Wapet holes in the West. How-
ever, the question does arise whether
Shell is not now a little overstretched
in Australian oil search.
All in all, Mr. Jack Spinks, the 41-
year-old exploration manager, has re-
kindled Shell’s interest in oil search
here with a vengeance and we should
all be thankful. This Scot came here in
1953 via doing oil jobs for Shell in
such distant lands as Venezuela, Bolivia,
Turkey, and Indonesia. When he ar-
rived here he went on an extended
safari of Australia’s sedimentary bases.
When he returned he told me, in com-
pany with Mr. Lewis Luxton, the Shell
chairman, that he thought they looked
good and he has been true to his
opinion.

Packing a Good Punch
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
WHEN this year’s expected round
of fairly dreary results from the
fibre container packaging com-
panies are finally out of the way, the
industry should present some magni-
ficent buying opportunities.
The meagre profit rise from Reed
Paper Products, and the slight falls
from Queensland Can and National
Bag (the rumor-prone multi-wall
sack company) are likely to be followed
by a lower result from Fibre Containers
and a presumably steady one from J.
Fielding.
But all these stocks, and others in
packaging like Containers Ltd., which
have a large stake in fibre containers,
are now in a fascinating stage of de-
velopment where their turnovers should
rise considerably with little need for
plant expansion as the excess capacity
installed in recent times is taken up.
As the article on APM on page 75
shows, use of packaging board in Aus-
tralia jumped by one-third in the past
four years and should continue to rise
at that rate.
In the circumstances, 1965-66 re-
sults have been quite gpod. Drought
hit the operations of Queensland Can,
particularly its fibre container business
for boneless meat exports, which is its
biggest single activity, as beef exports
dropped 13 percent.
And this year’s agreement to end
the savage price-cutting in the industry
comes too late to help the present
batch of results
Another bullish point for package
makers is the plan by Tasman Pulp in
New Zealand to make packaging
board for Australian users.
APM’s domination of the packaging
board industry here has been the sub-
ject of many verbal attacks. One of the
reasons for the strong urge to merge
among fibre packaging companies has
been to create large groupings that
would be able to bring strong price
pressure to bear on the only major
supplier of packaging board in Aus-
tralia.
One of the major shareholders in
Tasman is the British Reed Paper Com-
pany. This has a majority share-
holding in one of Australia’s larger
packaging companies, Reed Paper Pro-
ducts Ltd., which buys packaging board
from APM. Reed also has a stake in
(and a technical servicing agreement
with) United Empire Box, the New
Zealand-based packaging group with
substantial Australian interests and
w'hich is also a customer of APM.
Whether the Tasman venture goes
ahead or not, it is clear that the Reed
interests in Australia are determined to
bring some sort of price pressure on
APM. And there is every indication
that Reed is eager to increase its role
in packaging here by takeover, in order
to build up its capacity to a level
where it could take a large proportion
of the planned Tasman output.
It may also be significant that
Bowaters, another U.K. paper group
that some years ago made an unsuccess-
ful takeover bid for Fibre Containers,
is also a large shareholder in Tasman
Pulp.
LAMSON Industries appears to be
emerging as a growth stock with
potential, following a partial re-
organisation last year and expanding
demand for its products all types of
stationery and office equipment. Per-
formance has been pretty static for
some time; between 1962 and 1965
earning rate edged slowly up from
about 10 to 14 percent. But the up-
surge which made itself apparent in the
final half of the 1965 year to December
31 has continued in the current year,
which seems to confirm that the group
is making a break-through.
Basically, the rise is a reflection of
the business world’s rapidly growing
The Chartist says:
O.D.E. still appears to have further growth prospects. The long-term trend since
1960 reveals a very broad trend channel at a basic rate of 15 percent
appreciation per annum. It can be readily seen on the chart that at times
the intermediate trends offer a much higher rate of appreciation. The downtiend
which followed the 1964 top formation took the stock to a low point of 53 cents
in March, 1966. Since then a substantial base reversal pattern has formed and
investors could expect a strong rise once the resistance at the 76 cents level is
broken on high volume, but it is quite likely that further consolidation will take
place below this level in the short term. Technically, this stock has appeal and
the consolidation to date suggests that prices could eventually rise to approximately
$1.15 and possibly higher. Last sale price on 8/9/66 —68 cents.

use of computer programs and other

These have generated an unprecedented
demand for the company's sprocket-
punched and multiple business forms,
together with the ancillary equipment
associated with such systems. On over-
seas trends, this type of business is due
for rapid growth in Australia. Lamson
is in the box seat for getting a big part
of the rising demand, especially follow-
ing last year’s moves to improve the
efficiency of the business forms division
and increase the local manufactured
content of the engineering subsidiary.
Profits for the full 1966 year should
return a minimum 17 percent-odd on
capital and provide about double cover
for the 9 percent dividend. Add further
growth potential to this situation and
the shares seem sound buying at cur-
rent prices of $1.62. Yield from the
dividend, after allowing for brokerage,
is an attractive 5i percent.
THE Confrontation tensions that
knocked some of the shine off the
island trading companies, Burns
Philp, W. R. Carpenter, and Steam-
ships Trading, have passed, but the
stockmarket has not yet responded to
the change.
The research men of Melbourne’s
leading broking house feel the time is
ripe for investment in these three listed
island trading companies. The areas
they operate in are finding improved
political stability and fast economic
growth, giving the groups an appeal
and some insulation against the more
competitive outlook for most local
companies. To back their case, the
researchers point out that the boom in
Australia’s Trust Territories will gnwv
as the Commonwealth Government
presses them toward nationhood. The
end of Confrontation and the change
in the Indonesian Administration has
eased political tensions in that area
generally, and co-operation wdth Aus-
tralia now seems possible for the devel-
opment of West Irian. A diversion of
funds from defence to development is
a likelihood on both sides of the border.
In 1965-66, Government expenditure
rose 25 percent to $132 million $36
million was from internal revenue, $6
million from loan raisings, $2B million
in direct Territory spending by Com-
monwealth departments, and $62 mil-
lion from the annual non-repayable
grant to the Administration. This year's
Budget lifts this grant to $7O million.
And in the private sector a French-
Japanese oil venture plans expenditure
of $lO million, BP is surveying in the
Papuan Southern Highlands, Oil Search
is to recommence drilling in Central
Papua, CRA is at Bougainville With a
copper find (the Administration has
estimated that this project alone could
double the Territory’s exports in five
years) and currently making geological
searches at Wewak and on New Britain
Island. On the agricultural front,
copra, cocoa, and coffee shipments are
rising and future exports should get a
boost from new ventures in tea and
pyrethrum. Naturally, world pri Ces
affect such returns copra prices have
had a bit of a tumble, but are still
satisfactory, while cocoa is recovering
from its earlier low levels.
Against this background, the island
traders seem set for several years of
growth. W. R. Carpenter gets more
than half its profits from the area. It
has a 23-year record of rising profits
and earning rate should doubly cover
the dividend this year. At $2.50 the
shares yield only 3 percent but they
are a solid buy. The company treats
its shareholders well; there have been
three bonus issues since 1962.
Burns Philp gets enough income
every year from investments alone to
cover its 10 percent dividend. At
$3.67 the shares are well below their
peaks of recent years and, while they
still yield only 2.7 percent, the back-
room boys have suggested a bonus issue
may not be too far away. The 10
percent dividend has been unchanged
since 1953; but the cash payout to
shareholders has trebled during that
time because of four bonus issues and
one cash issue on favorable terms.
Steamships Trading pales a little in
financial strength when compared with
Carpenter and Burns Philp, but holds
a strong and expanding position in the
Territory. Profits this year should equal
20 percent on rising capital and widely
cover the 13 l-3rd percent dividend.
The attraction of this stock, apart from
the growth prospects it shares with the
other two, is its price. At about $1 the
shares are within reach of all investors
and, possibly more important, yielding
more than 6 percent from dividends.
In the light of this, its growth pros-
pects may Ire better than those of its
associates.
As an afterthought, the broker feels
that ANG Holdings, a newcomer to
the Territory, may prove interesting.
It is priced around the same level as
Steamships, but offers a more specu-
lative approach. A maiden dividend
rate has not been struck yet; whatever
it is, directors expect it to rise progres-
sively from year to year. They have
engaged the company in several pro-
jects, each of which will gradually start
adding to profits as it reaches matur-
ity.
So the islands are currently offering
something for every investor. For a
solid and gradually growing invest-
ment, W. R. Carpenter. Burns Philp
offers the same, but has the added spice
of a bonus issue soon. Steamships pro-
vides a cheaper entry into the area
and an investment in the fastest grower
of the four, although not the most
solid. ANG is for the more specu-
latively minded.
FOR a company with a recent record
as dismal as Cellulose Australia s,
directors of this paper company
seem surprisingly unabashed by the
final result for 1965-66. Profit of
$190,920, with no tax provided, was
better than three times higher than the

The yawn
that killed
a business!
Here was a company going places. Up to the minute on the market, knew what their
competitors were doing, continually checking with surveys, research and statistics.
Trouble was, they ignored the most vital statistics of all . . . that major fires put up
to 71% of companies out of business. We tried to point out all these vital points, but
were met with the “Won’t Happen To Me” attitude. Finally the discussion was closed
with a polite yawn of boredom. It happened! They paid the high price . . . loss of
wages, turnover, key staff and customers of years standing. Insurance covered the
physical things . . . but it wasn’t enough! Statistics also show that fires can be
beaten. In fact major fires can be eliminated or drastically reduced. EVERY 24 HOURS
FIRE STRIKES . . . WILL YOU BE NEXT?
Our fire protection engineers can show
you how to provide business-preservation.
They’ll assess your fire risks and offer
advice on the most suitable system for
your type of business ...
Your security is our only business.

previous year’s results for all that
it returned only 3.9 percent on capital.
However, the improvement counts
for very little in view of the un-
explained reversal in the second half.
The interim statement reported net
earnings of $185,864, and increases of
27.7 percent and 30 percent respectively
in production and sales. The final half
added a little more than $5OOO to the
full year’s earnings, and dragged over-
all production and sales increases back
to 10.5 and 11 percent.
This is not the first time Cellulose
has left the market in ignorance of
significant changes in the trend of
earnings. What is amazing is that the
market keeps the shares as high as 50
cents. The company hasn’t paid a divi-
dend for two years and, unless direc-
tors can explain away the final six
months of 1965-66, doesn’t appear
likely to do so in the near future.
BHP’s cautious forecast of a revival
in steel demand is a less direct
pointer to S.A.’s Austral Steel
Holdings Ltd. than it might first ap-
pear.
Probably the country’s largest distri-
butor of steel products, Austral suffered
a comparatively small decline in turn-
over in difficult 1966. Net earnings,
however, slipped back 23 percent and
dragged the earning rate down from
18 percent to 13.7 percent.
On a per capita basis, South Austra-
lia is served by about the same number
of BHP franchise holders as Victoria
and N.S.W. Only a few, however, have
displayed much energy in exercising
them and this has contributed to
Austral’s solid record.
Austral’s 1965-66 figures bear out the
general impression that the situation
has lately become considerably more
competitive. What’s more, the current
year would seem an opportune time for
BHP to enlarge its S.A. representa-
tion, as it has been tipped to do for
some time. Short-term prospects for
some sort of improvement in the lot
of Austral’s shareholders now are a
little dimmed.


COMMODITIES
Tungsten Ores Go Higher
THE London tungsten ore market
has been creeping higher recently,
after a long spell of steady prices.
Wolfram and scheelite, the main ores
for the steel-hardening metal, sold at
255/- to 275/- stg. a unit (22.41 b. at
100 percent grade) for several months
after U.S. stockpile releases cut about
100/- from the post-Korean War peak
reached earlier this year.
The recent rise has been expected,
although there has been little pressure
on the market from either direction.
One new development, though it is
hard to tell what effect it has had on
the market, has been the Chinese politi-
cal campaign reported by some ob-
servers to be a near civil war. The
activities of the Red Guards have been
aimed at the sort bf people ex-
capitalists in many cases who nor-
mally handle export dealings, including
wolfram, of which China is the world’s
major source.
The bi-annual Canton Trade Fair is
the normal meeting place for buyers
and the seller of wolfram, and it is
feared that the October 15 exhibition
could be postponed or cancelled. In
the longer run, a resurgence of national-
ism in China could lead to opposition
to trade with the West in general and
the sale of this important element of
armor plate and armor-piercing missiles
in particular.
Lanolin Boom Breaks
ONE of the more unusual by-p ro .
ducts of wool production
lanolin, extracted from wool
grease is passing through a period
of over-supply. Raw wool grease cur-
rently sells at about £stg.Bs a ton
a year ago it reached a peak of
£250, after rising from £BO levels a
year earlier.
The boom last year was caused by
a relatively modest upturn in demand,
partly for the Vietnam war.
Lanolin is used not only in cos-
metics, where it has lately been modish
in that industry of fads, but is import-
ant in leather polishes and additives,
lubricants, anti-corrosion compounds,
and fine chemicals.
The boom attracted outsiders to the
small circle of wool-grease extractors
further processing to make the lano-
lin is carried out by only a handful of
firms, with a subsidiary of the U.K.
Woolcombers group, the largest refiner.
The old hands are currently biding
their time until some of the newcomers
lose patience and decide to move out
of the industry.
Cocoa Turns Down
COCOA prices have turned down in
the past week or so, reflecting a
better-than-expected West African
crop. Earlier this year a shortfall of
production of 200,000 tons for the cur-
rent season was expected, compared
with a considerable surplus the previous
season.
The range of cocoa prices in London
this year has been 152/6 to 216/3 stg.
a cwt., with prices last week at about
185/-. A year ago the price was 120/-.
Heavy selling by speculators brought
the latest decline.
Apart from the prospect of higher
African output, the U.K. credit squeeze
has hit both dealers and speculators.
A prolonged fall is not likely—manu-
facturers are already beginning to buy
to replenish stocks run down from the
high levels established in last year’s
market slump.
Sugar in the EEC
THE Common Market’s internal
agreement on agriculture contains
provisions for a boost to sugar
production.
In 1968-69, the four producing mem-
bers of the EEC will have quotas to
supply 6,480,000 metric tons of sugar
(largely derived from beet). Forecast
EEC consumption for that year is
6,280,000 metric tons.
So, if the production quotas are filled
—and the high price to be paid fo r
sugar produced within the quotas seems
set to ensure that they will —the EEC
will permanently move from being a
net importer to a net exporter of sugar-
PLANET OIL COMPANY N. L.
The Directors of PLANET OIL COMPANY N.L. advise that the following
announcement was made to the Australian Stock Exchanges and
Press on the 30th August, 1966.
On behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary, Planet Mining Company
Pty. Ltd., we advise:—
MOUNT ROBIN PORPHYRY COPPER PROSPECT
Assays which have now been completed have established the
presence of disseminated and segregated copper and silver mineral-
isation in quartz feldspar porphyry at Mount Robin, near Ravenswood,
about 85 miles south-west of Townsville, in North Queensland.
An area of about 3,000,000 square feet has been outlined as possible
ore.
An independent overseas geological consultant, experienced in por-
phyry copper mineralisation, has investigated and surface-sampled
this prospect and advises that a provisional estimate of the possible
average surface values can be conservatively established at 0.8%
copper and 2 ozs. of silver to the ton, after making allowance for waste
and low-grade rock.
Assays of 67 surface channel samples range as high as 12.1% copper
by wet analysis and from traces up to 101 ozs. of silver to the ton by
fire assay. Significant values of gold, lead and molybdenum are also
present.
To date, no true porphyry copper mines have been discovered in
Australia. However, the world’s largest copper producers are low
grade disseminations of copper in porphyry. They are mined by large-
scale, open-cut methods.
Directors regard this copper-silver open-cut mining prospect as
promising, but emphasise that the extent, depth and overall grade
can only be established by drilling and that no drilling has yet been
carried out.
Further field work is in progress. An airborne magnetic and scintil-
lometer survey over the whole of the Company’s 520 square mile block
will commence shortly. Drilling will follow.
PETERMANN RANGES PROSPECT
A field party will proceed this week to the Butler’s Dome area in the
Petermann Ranges in the Northern Territory.
It will map,, in detail, the large Opera House structure in which
mineralised gossans outcrop over a distance of five miles. Drilling
will follow this programme.
A leading overseas Consulting Geochemist will accompany this party.
Photogeological studies of the Company’s 4,081 square miles con-
cession have now been completed.

MINING
Molybdenum in Demand
ALTHOUGH in recent years Aus-
tralian production of molybden-
ite ore (MoS2), the main source
of the metal molybdenum, has only
amounted to a few tons, won mainly in
association with tungsten or bismuth, it
is not often realised that, prior to 1920,
Australia was the principal world pro-
ducer. Queensland was the most im-
portant producing State, the Chillagoe-
Herberton-Mareeba district being the
main source of output. Other impor-
tant centres were in the northern New
England district of New South Wales
and at Everton, near Wangaratta, in
Victoria.
Molybdenum is mainly used as an
alloying agent in the steel industry to
increase the hardness and toughness of
steel, its resistance to shock and cor-
rosion, and its strength at high tem-
peratures. Other specialist uses in-
clude the use of molybdenum com-
pounds in lubricants, catalysts, rust in-
hibitors, paints, and fertilisers. Aus-
tralian imports of molybdenum alloys
and compounds are increasing and, in
1964, the cost of such imports
amounted to $900,000.
0 N the world scene, the molybdenum
industry is undergoing a tremendous
period of expansion, particularly in
North America, which furnishes over
three-quarters of the total world pro-
duction. In 1965 world production
increased by 20 percent to nearly
51,000 tons. It has been anticipated that
by 1968 North American output will
have increased by 65 percent over
1964 levels to about 48,000 tons per
annum.
This boom in the molybdenum in-
dustry is partly due to increased in-
dustrial demand, which is estimated
to be growing at the rate of about 5
percent per annum, but more sig-
nificant has been its acute scarcity in
recent years. The main factors in pro-
longing this scarcity have been the
lengthy strike in 1962 at the Bartlett
Mountain mine of Climax Molybdenum
Co., followed by increased U.S. require-
ments for the Vietnam war. The im-
mediate situation has been relieved by
releases from the U.S. stockpile, the
latest being in April this year when
the sale of 7000 tons was authorised.
Despite the scarcity, quoted prices
have remained traditionally very stable
a t $U.5.1.55 per lb. of contained
molybdenum in concentrates. How-
eve L free market prices have been
substantially above this figure. As a
result of the current expansion in the
industry, it has been forecast that
supply/demand balance will be
achieved in 1966 or 1967, bringing an
elimination of premium markets.
Perhaps the most interesting over-
seas development for Australian share
m arkets is the commencement of open-
cut mining operations in May, 1965,
by Endako Mines Ltd. (N.P.L.) in
which Placer Development Ltd. has a
76.6 percent interest. Placer anticipates
that Endako Mines Ltd., with its
molybdenum, copper, lead, and zinc
interests, will make a substantial con-
tribution to group earnings.
Although treatment operations did
not reach the initial design capacity of
10,000 tons per day until August, 1965,
in less than a full year to April 30,
1966, Endako earned a net operating
profit, after provision for write-offs, in
the vicinity of sCan.7 million.
Endako has recently announced
plans to expand the capacity of its
concentration to an average of 22,000
tons per day by mid-1968. This ex-
pansion program, which will cost some
sCan.s million, will permit a reduc-
tion in cut-off grade from 0.12 percent
MoS2 to 0.08 percent MoS2, thereby
increasing ore reserves by approxi-
mately 80 percent. The expansion will
allow an increase in sales commit-
ments from 4000 tons of molybdenum
per annum to about 5400 tons per
annum.
The world’s largest single producer,
the Climax, Colorado, mine of Ameri-
can Metals Climax Inc., is also in-
creasing capacity and over 25,000 tons
are expected to be produced in
1966. This is the only large mine
operated principally for molybdenum.
It is interesting to note that much of
the increased world production will
come from molybdenum recovery in
copper concentrates, both in North
America and in Chile, where a 50
percent increase over 1965 levels of
4200 tons of molybdenum is forecast by
1970. In Greenland, where significant
molybdenite deposits exist, develop-
ment has been deferred pending a more
favourable market .

a 20 percent interest in a joint venture
agreement with Freeport of Australia
Inc. for the exploration of an exten-
sive molybdenite occurrence. Geologi-
cal an d geophysical work is in pro-
gress.
Incidentally, although concentrates
produced by King Island Scheelite
(1947) Limited contain about 2 to 3
percent molybdenite, no payment is
received for this content, which is
regarded as an impurity.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
The Challenge for APM
AUSTRALIAN Paper Manufac-
turers Ltd. is now in a challenging
situation; it is raising $lO million
for more expansion at a time when de-
mand is slack, existing production is
10 percent below capacity, earning
rate is down, and when the threat of
real competition from New Zealand has
at last become serious. But APM is
used to handling challenging situations.
No matter what the immediate de-
mand position (which is believed to
be improving, anyway), the company
must cater for the anticipated growth
in paper and board use by the package
ing industry or else allow the existence
of an unsatisfied demand on which a
rival enterprise could be built. In the
past four years, its fixed assets have
gone up by one-third and so have its
sales—-a rate that may well continue
in coming years.
But APM’s real growth is going to
be greater than its apparent expansion.
A significant and rapidly increasing-
proportion of APM’s activities are not
consolidated into the annual accounts;
these are the major joint ventures with
Kimberley-Clark in toilet tissues, with
CSR in Pyneboard, and with N.Z.
Forest Products in Fibre Products New
Zealand, which last year together added
$781,000 in tax-free dividends to
APM’s profits, compared with only
$llO,OOO the previous year, and should
contribute much more in future years.
APM’s equity in 1965 profits of asso-
ciated companies was $630,000, but the
1966 figure has not yet been revealed.
There appears to be great profit
potential in the Kimberly-Clark ven-
ture, making Kleenex and Dawn tissues
and other sanitary papers. About sl2m.
has been spent on expansion since
1964, covering extensions to the Apcel
pulp mill at Millicent (S.A.) completed
after balance date, and a new No. 2
tissue machine which began producing
on April 1.
A new Pyneboard factory at Tumut
is being built at an estimated cost
initially of $4.5m., to start operations
early in 1967.
THE threat of competition in its
packaging papers and boards is not
a particularly cheering one in such a
capital-intensive industry where high
volume production is vital for profitabi-
lity. So there are serious implications
in last month’s announcement by Tas-
man Pulp and Paper Ltd. in New Zea-
land that it intends to expand from
newsprint into packaging board in a
$35 million development aimed at pro-
ducing an initial 100,000 tons a year by
the early 1970 s equal to about one-
quarter of APM’s output last year ■ —
l°r export to Australia.
APM feels this is not in the spirit
°f the new Australian-New Zealand
trade agreement and could retaliate by
Usi ng more pulp from other overseas
pountries and from its own sources
mstead of N.Z. APM is Tasman’s
major customer for pulp. It also says
there will be no shortage of liner board
in Australia by 1970 in view of its own
expansion program.
APM’s growth may occasionally
bring lower returns (as in the latest
year when earning rate on inevitably
higher average capital fell slightly to
12.6 percent), but the key fact about
an expanding company is that the
profits from the capital invested usually
run a couple of years behind.
This year should see the first returns
on the new s9m, Spearwood (W.A.)
mill, which began commercial produc-
tion on June 22. A new No. 6 machine
is being installed at Fairfield and
another one is being considered for the
Botany, N.S.W., mill, where the No. 2
machine is being converted to wrapping
papers following the transfer of Kleenex
tissue production to Apcel.
LAST year’s considerable increase in
plant coincided with the current
business downturn, with the result that
capacity was only about 90 percent
used in the April-june quarter—a level
at which the company’s profitability is
only moderate. This meant that APM’s
profit (pre-tax, pre-depreciation) to
sales ratio fell from 20.7 percent to 18.7
percent, its lowest since 1961.
Last year, in fact, APM’s profits from
its traditional pulp and paper activities
fell by about $i million, and the two
reasons for the $929,000 rise in group
profits were that tax fell by $828,000
because of investment allowances on
new plant and dividends from associ-
ated companies jumped by $672,000,
jointly providing a $H million stimulus
to profits. These investment allowances
will play a further role, in keeping tax
down in the current year. In 1965-66
tax of s2.lm. was only 22 percent of
pre-tax profit.
The profit also benefited from a
once-and-for-all reduction in interest
charges. Although terminable loan
funds rose from $19.1m. to $20.6m.
over the year, a large convertible note
issue which carried annual interest of
$741,200 was converted on 1965 balance
date, explaining the drop in interest
from sl.6m. to sl.om, in 1966.
After the $lO million note issue in
October APM will have raised $23.5
million from the public in 18 months.
The $ 13,325,000 raised by the 1965
share issue (one-for-five at 25 percent
premium) lifted capital to $64Jm.
The note issue, open from September
14 to October 21, will provide slom.,
bringing loan funds to about half the
size of share capital, and one-third the
size of shareholders’ funds,
Plant expenditure rose from $7.6m.
to $12.5m. in the year to June (mainly
in connection with the new Spearwood
paper and paperboard machine) which
gave APM an investment allowance of
fl.lm, Tax deductions of $276,000
were also allowed for calls on shares
in APM Forests Pty. In the previous
year, total allowances were only
$585,000.

Guide to World Economies
FEARS of a world trading recession
because of a shortage of inter-
national liquidity have set a seri-
ous background for the coming meet-
ing of the International Monetary
Fund, whose annual report last week
outlined proposals for improving the
situation. These. would involve both
additional drawing rights on the IMF
and the creation of a new reserve unit
of international currency by an affili-
ate of the IMF.
As their delegates prepare to
attend the IMF annual meeting, what
is the economic state of the leading
international trading countries of the
Western world? The Economist maga-
zine has provided this guide:
AUSTRALIA
Tight credit policy, already in effect
for two years, eased slightly in recent
months in response to hesitant trend in
the domestic economy, demands for
drought relief finance, and a brighter
external payments outlook.
BELGIUM
Stabilisation policy, but some finan-
cial help for private investment. Credit
ceilings re-imposed in May and price
controls introduced. Some consumer
prices to be reduced by negotiation
and cuts in domestic taxes; other
prices frozen for three months. Govern-
ment investment, specially in schools,
postponed. Discount rate raised in
June.
BRITAIN
Massive deflation and a wage-freeze
at home coupled with direct measures
to cut spending abroad by private in-
vestors, tourists, and government de-
partments. Toughness of domestic
credit squeeze underlined this w r eek;
the banks have been told they must
keep within their tight credit ceilings,
even if this means reducing overdraft
limits already agreed, or calling in
existing advances to non-priority cus-
tomers.
CANADA
Credit restraints reinforced by tax
increases and modest reductions in p u j )
lie expenditures. Worry over accelera'
tion in price rises.
FINLAND
Import restrictions and deflation
Growth slowing but no early re |j e j
from restrictions while external p av .
ments remain weak.
FRANCE
Cautious reflation. Emphasis on tax
and other financial incentives to private
investment. Price controls now morp
flexible.
HOLLAND
Credit restraint and wage and price
controls. Discount rate raised in May
Wage increases for 1966 still being
negotiated must not exceed 7 percent.
Price rises permitted only to cover
increases in non-labor costs. A stop on
hiring new government staff and cer-
tain government investments post-
poned.
ITALY
Cautious reflation. Although recovery
from 1963-64 recession has been slow,
with employment yet to respond sig-
nificantly, the authorities feel further
measures to boost the economy inappro-
priate. Reliance will be put on speeding
government investment already planned.
JAPAN
Reflation continuing, with a deliber-
ately and successfully expansionary
budget, higher public investment pro-
grams, and the discount rate at a post-
-1951 low.
NORWAY
Strict credit control; banks’ reserve
requirements raised July. Taxes on
petrol, drink, and tobacco raised in
June budget; and government invest-
ment cut back to cover substantial
wage rise for civil servants.
S. AFRICA
Still deflating.
SPAIN
Stabilisation continuing.
SWEDEN
Tightening credit squeeze; bank rate
raised in June to postwar high and
restrictions on house-building. Trade
deficit worrying authorities. But indus-
trial output recently weakened and
labor market eased slightly.
SWITZERLAND
Continued credit restraint and con-
trols on inflow of foreign capital. But
building controls removed.
UNITED STATES
Gradual tightening of credit in re-
sponse to continuing gold losses and,
still more, fears of inflationary pressures
in the long domestic boom. Short-term
interest rates up considerably in recent
months.
W. GERMANY
Credit squeeze. Unofficial observers
think it may have gone too far,
although the recent upswing in exports
has blunted fears that the economy is
turning to recession. Official talk still
peppered with warnings of inflationary
pressures. Central bank discount rate
raised late May.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Brickworks' Loss of Favor
IT is now nearly three years since I
last reviewed Brickworks Ltd., and
at that time the shares were selling
at $6.90. On the basis of the disclosed
1962/63 earnings which had just been
announced at that time, the price/
earnings multiple was 21.9. However,
after making an adjustment for the con-
vertible notes, this multiple increased
to 27.8. Today the shares are selling at
$7.00 and, after making adjustments for
the various provisions made in 1964/65,
the price/earnings multiple would be
9.4 on 1964/65 earnings.
One must wonder what has happened
to cause this stock to lose so much in
investors’ favor over the past two years.
Brickworks Ltd. was formed by a
consortium of Sydney brick manufac-
turers in 1934 and acquired the Home-
bush Bay brickworks from the State
Government. Today, the company oper-
ates brickworks from ten different loca-
tions in the Sydney area and also pro-
duces bricks at Rochedale, Brisbane. It
is almost certainly the largest producer
of bricks in the Southern Hemisphere
and without doubt the largest producer
in Australia, with production well in
excess of 200 million bricks per annum.
It would appear to have about 40 per-
cent of the market in the Sydney area
and about 30 percent of the Brisbane
market.
The company has never ventured
outside the field of brick making (ex-
cept perhaps into the field of land
development to dispose of its surplus
brick land) and it hasn’t attempted
to move into the competitive Melbourne
market. Some years ago, in 1958, it
decided to move into the Brisbane mar-
ket, probably because it saw an oppor-
tunity in Queensland, where the usage
of bricks was at a very low level. It may
have been influenced by the fact that
the concrete-block manufacturers seem
to have acquired a strong position in
the Adelaide market because the brick
manufacturers there did not take action
quickly enough to combat them.
This means that Brickworks’ future is
tied almost entirely to the future of
bricks. Because Sydney and New South
Wales are by far the most important
markets for the company, it will be of
interest to examine the trends of brick
usage over the past five years in New
South Wales. Production figures are as
follows:
Year- to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Million bricks
Face & texture 172 165 196 237 256
Commons 292 265 259 260 305
Total 464 431 455 497 561
When expressed in an index form,
using the average of the three years
1959/60, 1960/61, and 1961/62 as the
base, the following trends are notice-
able:
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Face and texture 104 99 118 143 154
Commons 292 266 259 260 305
Total . 104 96 102 111 125
It is immediately apparent that brick
manufacturers who were only produc-
ing commons during this period would
not have enjoyed a very buoyant mar-
ket. It is equally apparent that the face
and texture brick manufacturers would
have been having a good time with
their market growing at a very rapid
rate.
It seems likely that this trend is due
almost entirely to the brick veneer
home, aided possibly by the emergence
of the project builder. It is true that
the price of commons has increased
rather more than the price of face and
texture bricks over this period, but the
difference is not sufficiently significant
to affect the demand. In 1960, face
bricks were priced at 36 percent more
than commons and in 1965 they were
priced 31 percent more. In a sense,
the brick veneer home has reduced the
demand for bricks in total because in
the. averaged sized home the number
of commons used in a brick veneer

all the year round
home is only 25 percent of the number
that would be required in a full brick
construction. However, brick veneer is
gaining at the expense of fibro and tim-
ber and does not seem to be affecting
the full brick construction. This means
that in the average-sized home the con-
sumption of common bricks is increased
by 33 percent and the consumption of
face bricks by 166 percent!
Brickworks moved into the field of
texture bricks in a big way in 1960/61
and constructed a modern plant on a
large site it had purchased at Wall-
grove, west of Sydney. This plant came
into production towards the end of the
1961/62 year, but full production was
not achieved until the end of 1963/64.
At that stage the company was produc-
ing 38 million bricks a year at Wall-
grove, and at the end of the last
financial year (1964/65) a new kiln was
brought into operation there, raising
capacity to 60 million bricks a year.
Clearly the company is expecting
further growth in the demand for tex-
ture bricks, for this capacity repre-
sented over 25 percent of Sydney’s
demand for face and texture bricks in
1964/55 and demand was running at
high levels in that year.
In the half-yearly report for the
period to December 31, 1965, the com-
pany reported reduced sales but said
that the three Wallgrove kilns operated
to capacity. As a result, the company’s
profits rose during the first half 0 f
1965/66. It is likely that this position
did not continue into the second half
although there may well have been an
improvement in the final quarter.
JJOWEVER, it would be difficult to
forecast the likely earnings for
1965/66 because in 1964/65 the fol-
lowing deductions were made before
arriving at the published profits:
$220,000 was deducted for plant re-
placement and maintenance, but was
shown as a reserve in the balance
sheet; $139,522 was deducted for doubt-
ful debts, increasing the provision to
$272,504, but no withdrawals have
been made from this provision;
$144,000 was deducted for long service
leave but again no withdrawals have
been made from the provision, which
now stands at $336,742. Furthermore,
it would appear that $20,836 was de-
ducted from profit to write off de-
benture expenses. If all these items
were treated as appropriations of
profit rather than charges against
profit, earnings would have been 65
percent higher than actually disclosed.
In other words, earnings would have
been at the rate of 36 percent after
allowing for the notes which were con-
verted to ordinary shares last Decem-
ber.
On the same basis, I would not ex-
pect the 1965/66 earning rate to be
less than 32 percent and I believe that
over the next five years we should
see per share earnings increasing at a
rate of 10 percent per annum or even
better. Therefore, a price earnings
multiple of between thirteen and fif-
teen would not be unreasonable, sug-
gesting a price of between $8.30 and
$9.60.

Steps to Farmers' Unity
ANOTHER step along the tortuous
path to farm organisations unity
has been taken with the policy
familiarisation meeting of the National
Farmers’ Union and the Australian
Primary Producers’ Union. It is pos-
sible to make too much of this meet-
ing, just as it is possible to make too
little of it.
Most observers have taken the cyni-
cal view that the meeting w ? as more
talk than action and that unity is as
far off as ever. We are not so sure.
The big difference that is going to
come in the next four or five years is
that the old guard will go. We believe
that, while farm organisations are con-
trolled by men over 65, unity is im-
possible. If executives w r ere restricted
to men under 55, unity would be close
to reality; if the executives were re-
stricted to men under 45 it would be
.automatic.
In no farm organisation is there a
right, centre, and left. There are only
different shades of the conservative
right. All organisations have a few-
young rebels, but the general opinion
is that they wall grow out of it.
The Australian Wool Industry Con-
ference is a parliament of the wool
industry, for example, only in the sense
that it is an 18-century parliament of
Whigs and Tories. Beyond lie the dis-
enfranchised masses their role is to
keep their proper place, (outside).
Of course, these remarks might apply
to other aspects of Australian life at
this particular time. The Menzies era
in Australia has been verily an
Augustan, Walpolian one: “Toleration
to dissenters and preservation of things
as they are”; “No saint, no Spartan
and no reformer am I.”
To make this point is not to mini-
mise the very real achievements of the
Age of Menzies. An age of splendor
and magnificence it has been p ro .
vided, of course, you happened to be
one of the chosen. And if you were
not, then you could hardly complain
that things have been too hard. No
one has starved; few have gone with-
out a job.
Times change, but men do not. This
age, being a creation of man, has
within it the seeds of its own destruc-
tion. Assuming, for the moment, that
men between 45 and 55 take over all
the farm organisations in the next few
years (under 45 would be better, but
unlikely), farm unity, as such, would
have a different objective. And priority
would be given to different matters.
Things as they are would not be the
objective.
A unified, younger-farmer voice
would, for example, take a somewhat
jaundiced view of what is termed con-
solidation. It would refer to it, probab-
ably, as takeover. Which is what it is.
The reason that this has taken place
at such an alarming rate has been
largely because risk capital has been
denied those people who, by their
youth and vigor, are best able to take
a risk.
To be a pioneer in the old days you
needed a lot of nerve and a strong
back. Science, perhaps, has made the
load on the back a little lighter, but
nerve is still needed even more so.
It is not found in men in their 50s,
60s, and 70s.
YOUNGER generation of farm
leaders would be more concerned
with using the organisations as an aid to
getting things done than as an end in
themselves. One of the reasons, in
fact, that old men have multiplied in
the organisations is that many sons
have encouraged it. Get the old man
off to Sydney, or Melbourne, for a
couple of weeks, or, better still, over-
seas for six months, and the boys have
a chance to get something done on the
farm.
Testimony to this war of the
generations on the farms in recent
years is to be found in the number of
court cases in which sons have sued
fathers for a rightful share, and say,
in the farm operation. We know, per-
sonally, of five such cases, and we have
heard of many more. Overall, we sus-
pect that the number of such cases
would be staggering.
The difficulties confronting young
would-be farmers, without family
property, need no elaboration. The
banks, the insurance companies, the
Government plans; all, somehow,
benefit those who already have.
A young, unified farm voice would
be unlikely to agree that selling land
to Americans at -20 cents an acre is
necessarily in the “national interest.
A young farm voice would undoubtedly
have a better appreciation of both the

advantages and the disadvantages of
the Government role in agriculture.
It would also recognise the duplica-
tions and the empire building.
Xhe old guard view is that it is
wrong, but a measure of it is necessary
because it keeps the natives happy. The
old guard tactic has been to express
approval and then to ensure that the
rewards go to those least in need of
help. There is not a. stabilisation or
price support plan in Australian agri-
culture which does not benefit the
larger farmers more than the smaller.
In Walpole’s day they called it en-
closure. It is a fascinating analogy.
Of Walpole, historian J. H. Plumb has
written: “His way was the control of
parliament by government not the
reverse. He disliked the spread of
opposition views, both tory and radical.
His deep understanding of human
motive, amounting almost to genius,
was the true foundation of his great-
ness.
“If anyone threatened, as Carteret
and Townshend threatened his mastery,
he worked with a steadfast purpose to
eliminate them.”
JN Australia it would apear that we
are in for some bitter controversy
for quite a long while also. Walpole, of
course, was followed by Chatham and
this is where the analogy appears to
break down. We have any number of
potential Pitt the Youngers, well-bred,
well-educated, charming fellows, but
where, in any party, is the man of
destiny believing, above all else, in
his country and countrymen?
Mr. Calwell, and others in the Labor
Party, would appear to have disquali-
fied themselves through their attitude
toward the ambitions of Red China.
Chatham tolerated one ambition only
England’s. Mr. McEwen will be
seen, in retrospect, as possibly a loyal
Townshend to the Menzies’ Walpole.
Farm unity is not, of course, in-
trinsically right or good simply for its
own sake. But it will come, we be-
lieve, and come fairly rapidly, simply
because all the indications are that our
Augustan Age is over and unity will be
identified with a purpose which, until
now, it has lacked. It will be based
more broadly and it will differ most,
we think, in that regional rather than
industry aspirations will play a bigger
part.

The Cost of Making Hay
Agricultural economistsh. a.
White and L. E. Cozens, of the
Victorian Department of Agri-
culture, have costed the making and
storing of grass hay. They find that the
cheapest way of getting the job done is
by neighborly co-operation. Two far-
mers who pool their labor and machin-
ery can make hay at a lower cost per
ton, no matter what the quantity, than
by working alone or calling on contrac-
tors to help with part of the process.
They also found that unless a farmer
makes more than 8.5 tons of hay annu-
ally, it does not pay him to own and
operate his own baler. If he usually
.makes less than this amount of hay,
baling is done more cheaply by con-
tractor. However, if a farmer does not
have to employ any outside help, 55
tons is the break-even point for baler
ownership.
No matter what system of making
and storing hay is used, the cost per
ton rises steeply for quantities less than
about 50 tons. Small farmers, those
needing to feed out less than 50 tons
a year, should consider whether they
can buy hay more cheaply than they
can make it. This possibility would
seem to be highly likely when a small
farmer is unable to team up with a
neighbor. It is a pity that Messrs. White
and Cozens have not analysed this
aspect. Depending on how a farmer
goes about it, the cost of making rela-
tively small quantities of hay can easily
exceed $l2 a ton. On the other hand,
the per ton cost reduces only very
slowdy on quantities greater than about
100 tons. The economics of hay-making,
then, seem to indicate that you either
make very large amounts or co-operate
with your neighbors.
In the past, fodder conservation has
been urged on farmers w hile .sufficient
information on the economics of mak-
ing and storing hay have been lacking.
White and Cozens, therefore, merit
our appreciation and' their report
should be read with interest far beyond
the borders of their owm State.
Briefly, they compared the economics
of four typical systems of making hay.
In the first, the farmer and his sons did
all the work and owned all the neces-
sary machinery tractor, trailer,
mower, rake, baler, and elevator. On
the second farm, only the mowing and
raking is done by the farmer; contrac-
tors are called in to bale, cart, and
stack. The third farmer does everything
except the carting and stacking, for
which he hires a contractor. In the
fourth situation, two farmers club to-
gether, share the machinery, and do all
the work without bringing in any out-
side help.
In Victoria, at least, the second and
third systems are the commonest,
despite the fact that they are the most
costly to operate, except for the farmer
using the first system and making loss
than 55 tons of hay while not possessing
a haler. In view of its cost advantages
the fourth system of hay-making should
of course, be the most widely employed'
In fact, it is the least common arrange-
ment. And this is poignantly odd, since
Australian country people have always
prided themselves on their mateship.
Canadian farmers naturally have the
same problem with machinery g
costs too much for the amount of use
they get out of it. To get around this
they have recently instituted a system
of “machinery syndicates.” The move-
ment has the full blessing and support
of the Federal Government. Perhaps
this is the secret of successful sharing
and neighborliness plays the minor role.
The Canadian Government, through the
Farm Credit Corporation, lends a syndi-
cate up to 80 percent of the cost of any
machinery that can be used co-
operatively. A syndicate may borrow
up to $15,000 per member or to a
total of $lOO,OOO for the group as a
whole.
J -OANS are repayable over seven
years, with bonuses for quicker re-
payment. Interest rates vary from time
to time, depending on the Corpora-
tion's source of funds, but generally
they are considerably lower than ruling
bank rates. Each syndicate is legally
constituted, but their formatipp. seeing
to be effected with a minimum of hiss.
The Farm Machinery Syndicates Credit
Act, to give it its full title, requires each
group to consist of a minimum of three
farmers. The original members usually
soon persuade others to join. No
obstacles are put in the way of those
who want to quit a syndicate, however.
Other formal rules regulate the keeping
of accounts, apportionment of capital
and maintenance costs, responsibility
for storing the machinery, and who has
first use of it each season.
Strange though it may seem, the
machinery firms are supporting the
syndicate idea. They expect to sell
more equipment of all sorts in the long
run. Syndicate farmers not only have
the loan funds to spend but in addition
the savings accruing from co-operative
ownership. With these the farmer
should be able to afford the luxury of
mechanising jobs that are still ordin-
arily done manually, besides keeping all
the machinery more up to date. The
Government expects that its return will
come by way of greater surpluses that
can be put on world markets at more
competitive prices. The Canadian
scheme resulted in the formation of lG
syndicates during the first few months
o'f its operation and loans totalled
almost a million dollars. Before draw-
ing up next year's Budget, our Federal
planners might like to investigate
further the Canadians’ realistic method
of helping farmers to help themselves.

Williams' Unfinished Story
Hopes for an uncomplicated solution
WHILE the present market may be dull, company meetings are not. Following
closely on the heels of Intrade Chemicals was the F. W. Williams extra-
ordinary (sic) general meeting.
This was another two-cornered con-
test. In one corner, weighed down by
recent losses but proudly holding a
share certificate for 1,650,000 ACI
shares (the “6” has recently been
crossed out and a “4” inserted) was
the board of directors. And in the other
was the Martin Corporation, whose
voice is A.B.S. White & Co., F. W.
Williams’ ex brokers.
To head off the cash and/or share
offer by Martin Corporation, the F.
W. Williams’ directors had put up a
proposal involving the liquidation of
the present company, a part-distribut-
tion of the ACI shares to F. W.
Williams’ shareholders, and the for-
mation of a new company, F. W. W.
Industries Ltd.
The 54 percent vote in favor of the
motion for liquidation fell well short
of the required 75 percent. More
telling than these figures was the
obvious disapproval of the board in-
dicated by the great majority attending
the meeting.
T° combat all the criticism, the chair-
man, Mr. O. McL. Falkiner, again
made known the fact that shareholder
funds (or net assets) had grown from
less than $1 million to more than $lO
million during the past 10 years. But,
as Miss Treloar had earlier pointed out
in letters to the papers, it’s not much
use having assets if they’re not going
to earn profits. In fact, the very size
of the assets could be turned against
the directors if one looked at the poor
return earned on them in recent years.
The F. W. Williams story is not yet
finished. Let’s hope some of the feel-
ings of the shareholders have rubbed
off on to the directors and a simple
ACI share and/or cash solution with-
out any tags is in the offing.
As usual I have wandered off on a
tangent. Perhaps if I’d been more
observant of the market I would have
been into Cope Allman at $1.20. Now
they’re touching $1.50.
Closer to home is AMI. This stock
came into the portfolio a month or so
before the very good profit announce-
ment. The threefold increase in profit
in 1965, to give an earning rate of 33
percent, was impressive enough. How-
ever it pales against this year’s earning
rate 9.42 percent. Admittedly both
years had the advantage of paying little
tax. Even so, on normal tax, earning
rate in the latest year would have been
22 percent.
Struggling against the pessimism felt
for motor companies, the shares hardly
budged from 50 cents. Still cum a 10
percent dividend, this would seem to
make the shares a pretty cheap propo-
sition. What’s more, the Chartist
still likes them. I added 500 shares
to my existing holding of 500, so mak-
ing a total of 1000.
In this sort of market, buying comes
easier than selling. But with the ex-
pectation that the industrial market is
going to be battling against both inter-
nal and external economic pressures
for some time to come, I’ve thought it
best to reduce the number of industrial
stocks. Both Comeng and Tennyson
Textiles were sold out just below their
purchase price. Comeng should be
bringing out a very good result shortly;
in this market, that probably won’t
make any difference.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 Comeng 1.10 $539
500 Tennyson
Textiles (x div.) .75 $382
BOUGHT
500 AMI .51 $261
The credit of $6BO gives me good
room for manoeuvrability if the market
does show any sign of improvement.

The Pacific’s wide blue bowl is home-
territory to AIR NEW ZEALAND. Now
you can fly all round it by new long-
range DC-Bs, perfect version of the
world’s most preferred jetliners. New
accents on comfort and quietness. And
a bright new concept: Five Star Jetline
Service, dedicated to you. Five Star?
Food and wines you’d rate outstanding
anywhere. And quietly thoughtful atten-
tion all the way.
AIR NEW ZEALAND, the airline that
goes to more trouble to make your
flight a great pleasure.
AIR HEW ZEALAND
★★★★★ The Five Star Jetline
in association with BOAC and Qantas, Air New Zealand’s general sales agents in Australia.
