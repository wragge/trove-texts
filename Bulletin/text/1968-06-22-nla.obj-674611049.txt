at the end of the rainbow: a pot of black
Black is the combination of all colours. In the rainbow
above they’re separated by the Thin Layer Chromato-
graphy techniques.
This is the newest overseas method of identifying
antioxidants used in modern rubber compounding. So
Australian Carbon Black has introduced the apparatus
here to assist the rubber industry in this specialised
field of organic chemical identification.
Even though A.C.B. makes only the carbon black that
is an ingredient in most things rubber, we go to every
known length to ensure that it meets exacting speci-
fications.
So when a manufacturer or compounder comes to
us for black, he knows that it has been subjected
to every quality control test available.
We’ve eight years' experience behind us as suppliers
of furnace black. And that experience adds up to tech-
nical know-how, better service and definite economies.
So next time you think of black, think of us. Could
be your pot of gold.

TALKING BIG
NOBODY is unduly surprised to hear
that students from three Victorian
universities are concerned about their
public image and hope a “talkathon”
next month will improve it. The idea,
put forward by World University
Service, is to have hour and half-hour
group discussions continuing for 24
hours. The WUS executive secretary,
Brendan O’Dwyer, says the response has
been greater than expected; everyone
wants to talk.
WUS wants the occasion to be “a
window on the universities.” “It will get
over to the public that there is wide
diversity at the universities,” O’Dwyer
said. “It should give a more accurate
picture than the public has about the
ferment of university life. It should
become clear that the student also has a
role as a constructive critic of his
society.”
O’Dwyer rejects the suggestion that
students need not give a damn about
public opinion. “A university is a very
important part of the economic set-up.
It has to toe the line to some extent.
However, students can be alive, active,
and alert. Their radicalism can be
encouraged and developed.” He cited
the remittance by WUS of nearly
$40,000 overseas to assist tertiary educa-
tion in poor countries as an example of
true radicalism.
TV and radio have expressed their
interest in the talkathon and WUS
hopes part of the proceedings will be
broadcast. Letters have been sent to
firms suggesting ithe sponsorship of some
segments. The proposed figure is $100
an hour. Who will sponsor the Labor
Clubs?
GREAT ISSUES OF THE DAY
IN ANOTHER flurry of student
activity, 700 students of the Univer-
sity of N.S.W. settled into the Round-
house last ■week for the first open forum
with the university administration and
staff. However, most of the questioning
remained at what the Pro Vice-
Chancellor, Professor Myers, on the
platform to take the brunt of the
attack, called the “Dorothy Dix” level
rather than emulating Dany le Rouge.
One student asked why his university
correspondence was still sent to his old
address; it turned out he had filled
in his old address as his new address
in his change-of-address form.
Another student attacked the Sports’
Union for not admitting mountain-
climbers and skindivers. A question
about the 16 percent rise in union fees
last year backfired when Professor Myers
explained that the students run the
union themselves and were responsible
for the rise.
However, the students are due for a
gingering-up. “We aim to put a bomb
under the lot of you, but it’s going to
be a loving bomb,” said a spokesman
for ALF (Action for Love and Free-
dom), the new student group which was
responsible for organising the meeting.
ALF, formed last term, is described
as a “loose connection of people.” The
moving spirit behind it is a fast-talking
Englishman, lan Channell, a 35-year-
old teaching fellow in the Sociology
department, who spills out a non-stop
stream of social theories and phil-
osophies and “pop-culture” slogans,
and distributes a prolific supply of
roneoed notes from the gurus of the
student revolution: Marcuse, Riesman,
Fromm, McLuhan.
He describes himself as a “comi-
cophilic WASP Pommie oldie” and
wears a button saying “Owing to lack
of interest, tomorrow has been can-
celled.”
Black as the present university struc-
ture appears to him, Channell still be-
lieves that universities are “one of the
last little enclaves of freedom in our
society,” and for this reason social
revolutions like those in countries
throughout the world today must start
within the university.
He criticises his own student body at
N.S.W. as “apathetic, wet, silly, irre-
sponsible,” but claims this is precisely
a symptom of degree factories, which
are “repressive and meaningless” and
alienate students from staff and adminis-
tration and from themselves as adult
human beings.
“We want a revolution of conscious-
ness, not a class revolution against speci-
fic grievances,” he says.
For Channell, who is a believer in
Marshall McLuhan’s theory that the
medium is the message, the demon-
stration is what is important, not what
it’s about. It gives people the oppor-
tunity to express their individualism, is
therapeutic, and calms the nerves! “We
are not going to do anything at all.
Transformation is going to happen, any-
way —so why not sit back and watch
the spectacle,” he says.
He can reiterate the things that are
wrong with the present university sys-
tem, such as matriculation requirements
to enter university, exams to gain
degrees, set textbooks that must be read
to pass exams, and faculties organised
under so-called important people like
professors. And the well-chewn hang-
ups of society at large—“national power
and economic development.”
But he has no Utopian blueprint for
the future in his back pocket. “Luther
couldn’t have provided a blueprint for
the Reformation,” he says. “Individuals
in the system can’t transform it, any-
way.”
While ALF doesn’t sound to be doing
very much at all, Channell doesn’t rule
out the possibility of violence erupting
here as it has in student revolts in other
countries.
But judging by the non-emotional
response at the first lunchtime meeting
with staff and administrators, somebody
will have to shove a pretty powerful
bomb under the students before they’ll
even come up with a few strong
criticisms.

conceptions. But it was right. Although
Mr. Wilson is no longer bearded, he is
definitely of 1968 with greying side-
burns and moustache, an elegance which
allows him to wear a lilac polo-neck
sweater and get away with it, and a
slight air of wariness which vanishes
when he smiles.
He is in Sydney to direct yet another
production of “The Boy Friend,” which
has now been done so many times in
so many countries that only Mr.
Wilson’s agent keeps count any more.
Its success gives him two things
enough security to make him his own
master (“I work on things I want to
do now”) and a yardstick against which
all his subsequent work is measured.
One critic described his music for a
new show, “As Dorothy Parker Said,”
as “ ‘The Boy Friend’ with teeth,” some-
body else greeted his 1958 musical,
“Valmouth,” with the remark “It’s
not like ‘The. Boy Friend,’ is it?” and
Mr. Wilson knows that whenever any-
one telephones him at work it’s likely
to be a project set in the ’twenties or
’thirties.
“The opinion about the new show
quite pleased me, but the other one,
about ‘Valmouth,’ was ridiculous. It’s
actually my favorite one I suppose
you could call it a decadent fantasy,
with a lot of jokes about sex and
religion in it, and it’s certainly not
meant to resemble ‘The Boy Friend.’
But I don’t mind being identified with
the ’twenties. It’s what I know each
to his own and I’m not bored with
it.”
He was born in 1924 a little late
to participate fully in that decade’s
frenzies, but he had two elder sisters
then in their teens, and his childhood
was pervaded by repeated renditions
of the music of “No, No, Nanette” on
a gramophone, and he has memories
of living-room rugs being dragged back
for charleston lessons.
He was writing pop songs and con-
tributing lyrics to musicals when the
Players Theatre in London, a group
specialising in Victorian music-hall
productions, decided they needed a
change of style, and asked him to write
a divertissement set in the ’twenties.
Finally, it was decided he write a full
musical, which he did in two months.
“It seemed to write itself, everything
fell into place it’s an experience that
hasn’t been repeated for me, with the
possible exception of ‘The Boy Friend’s’
sequel, ‘Divorce Me, Darling.’ I suppose
because the pattern was set.
“Another thing, there wasn’t much
research necessary for ‘The Boy Friend,’
because at that time, the late ’forties
and the beginning of the ’fifties, com-
panies were actually touring with shows
like ‘No, No, Nanette’ and ‘The Girl
Friend,’ as if they were modern musi-
cals.”
The forthcoming Australian produc-
tion of the show will be the third one
he has directed. He did the West End
revival season and the South African
production. “I love directing I’d like
to direct a work by somebody else. To

me, writing and directing complement

He also wants to make a second
attempt at writing a straight play (“I
did one a few years ago which was
almost put on”), and there is a possi-
bility he will write a musical for tele-
vision. Meanwhile, there are two new
productions to think about: “As
Dorothy Parker Once Said,” a revue
built round a set of Dorothy Parker’s
poems and written for Canadian actress
Libby Morris, and a musical about Amy
Johnson and her flight to Australia.
“It touches on three decades, but
it’s been written as a modern musical,
and we’re using modern techniques like
slides, movies, and tape recordings to
tell the story, because I don’t think
you can tell the story of something like
a transpacific flight on stage any more
without using things like this.
“There’ll be comedy, because she was
a funny girl. She decided she wanted
to fly, then, just like that, decided she
wanted to fly the ocean. It’s like a
show-business story.” And about that
Mr. Wilson knows.
WHOSE PLACE IN THE SUN?
THE EXPATRIATE Victorian Aider-
man Bruce Small, Mayor of the Gold
Coast, returned to the cold country
recently as more than the generalissimo
of “the fight for the tourist dollar.”
He came as conqueror of the swampy
Nerang River. No longer concentrating
on bikinis, the beach, and the swinging
nightlife, Mr. Small brought word of
Surfers as a place to retire to, indeed
the only place to retire to.
With simple candor he places the
beach fourth in the list of attractions.
Not that the beach is inadequate or
washed out or anything of that kind.
It is just that Bruce Small thinks
“climate, hills, and river, and always
the incomparable way of life” take
precedence. His Paradise City, across
the Nerang from the shopping centre,
he thinks is close enough to the centre
to preserve the glamor, but sufficiently
remote for the oldies to set their own
pace.
This new emphasis comes at a time
when Surfers is just emerging from a
serious depression. The drought down
south took off the cream, but there
were long-term causes of the recession.
As early as the late, ’fifties the Gold
Coast was no longer fashionable, its
monopoly of the bikini declined, only
to be followed by the threat of the
package-deal ovei'seas tour. The long-
range threat may come from nearby
resorts.
Two projects 100 miles north of
Surfers Paradise are throwing out a
direct challenge to Mr. Small’s Paradise
City.
L. J. Hooker’s Kawana and Alfred
Grant’s Bundilla Lakes also come com-
plete with climate, hills, canals, and
beach. Unfortunately for the peace of
mind of the Gold Coast, the climate of
the Sunshine Coast (a name officially
accepted late last month) has a climate


just as balmy, closer and more spec-
tacular hills, plans for far more canals,
indisputably better surf, and beaches
that so far haven’t washed away.
Where Bruce Small has plans for
2500 houses around the canals dug from
the Nerang swamp, Hooker’s plan
17,000 house sites and as many as
twenty canals branching from a six-
mile main canal running down the
coast. Bundilla, a johnny-come-lately
in the canals boom, has surveyed. 7000
house sites.
The Bundilla and Kawana projects
have been given a big boost by the
move of the Port of Brisbane pilot ser-
vice from Caloundra ten miles down
the coast to the Mooloolah River.
The $1,600,000 boat harbor at the
mouth of the Mooloolah not only has
rocks as huge and unsightly as those
along the Surfers beach but offers “the
safest still-water-to-sea access on Aus-
tralia’s East Coast.” The harbor will
not only shelter the pilot launches; it
will be the haven for the big-game
fishing craft which will nip out to “an
ocean teeming with marlin and other
game fish.”
Wherever the tourist goes he is
banded a tourist map of the Sunshine
Coast which lists 48 “points of interest,”
which, as lan Hayne, a local chemist
and president of the Tourist Promotion
Committee, says, is twice as many as
the Surfers brochure lists. “We are not
competing with the Gold Coast,” he
says. “The Sunshine Coast is not the
same and never will be. We are aiming
for every mobile man, woman, and
child to spend at least one holidav
here.”
Unfortunately, that is what Mr. Small
wants, too. Perhaps tourists could see
both places in the one holiday. Once
might be enough.

LISTENING TO THE
CRICKET ISN'T WHAT
IT USED TO BE
IT WAS JUST after lunchtime that I
extracted the earplug from my ear,
turned over, and went to sleep, some-
thing I hadn’t done intentionally during
a Test match in 30 years. I was bored.
Alan McGilvray, our dean of commen-
tators, goes about his task with a
solemnity as if he were describing the
funeral of Queen Victoria. Other men,
like Trevor Bailey, have an earnest,
-on-the-spot approach, like Stock
Exchange reporters, and, of them all,
•only John Arlott has a sense of poetry,
an actual gift for describing the scene
of the game.
Of course, part of the beauty about
the old commentators was that they
didn’t talk very much about cricket.
Charles Fortune could waffle on most
charmingly about ladies’ hats, seagulls,
and such while three wickets fell
unnoticed, and there was always a
beautiful straight-man comedy relation-
ship between Victor Richardson and
Arthur Gilligan. “What do you think,
Arthur?” And Arthur, with vast polite-
ness, would quietly disagree with every-
thing that had been said.
And upon extracting the earplug
one began to reminisce. Listening to the
cricket is not what it used to be. Before
the war one could drive around the
city at 2 a.m., and lights were on
throughout the suburbs, beer-and-crav-
fish parties in full cry, at least until
they took Stan McCabe’s wicket.
Don Bradman did for radio what the
Olympic Games did for television in
1956. During the cricket in 1930, mil-
lions of pounds’ worth of radios were
sold. In the early days of TV people
used to sit outside the shops at night,
and it was the same with radio during
the Test cricket. This was Depression
time and not everyone could afford
radios; the enthusiasts would bring
along kerosine tins full of hot coals to
keep themselves warm. Out in Colling-
wood and Fitzroy they would cook
chops and have beer parties on the
footpath.
Ah, yes, and if you are old enough
you will remember the synthetic broad-
casts of the ABC. They began with the
1934 series. The ABC used to get cables
from the Test ground which described
every ball, every movement. They had
a model of the ground in the studio
with players in their correct positions,
so as the cables came in they could
describe players as if they were actually
seeing it.
Sir Charles Moses, begging his
pardon, was Charlie Moses then. He
would use artificial applause and he
was most precise about the sound of
the ball hitting the bat. He had three
pieces of wood of varied sizes and he
would strike these with a pencil to
give, say, the sound of a full-blooded
drive, a late cut, or a straight bat.
Then it could be most difficult for
him when the cables came through
announcing that Hammond was gone.
It was utterly impossible for the boys
in the studio to restrain their whoops
of enthusiasm, for Charlie Moses would
still be describing play two overs back
and would have to keep back a tremble
of emotion from his nicely modulated
ABC voice.
If there was any delay in the cables
this could be devilish awkward. Charlie
Moses would say, “Woodfull is taking
a long time getting to the wicket . . .
ah ... I don’t think Woodfull has
actually left the pavilion yet . . . he’s
still adjusting his pads.” Then a purist
would telephone that this was a serious
breach of the rules. Surely it was a rule
that a player was allowed only two
minutes to get to the wicket.
Yet Charlie Moses wasn’t the first.
Test broadcasting began with the com-
mercial stations during the 1930 series.
David Worral, of 3DB Melbourne, and
Oswald Anderson, of 2UW Sydney, got
the idea, wouldn’t it be wonderful if
somehow, some way, they could do a
broadcast. They looked into it, and
urgent cables from the ground were
6/- a word, which was frightening, and
sponsors did, indeed, flee in terror.
However, they decided on the first
day of the First Test at Nottingham
to try it until midnight, and at that
time, with no obvious results, David
Worral took the microphone and said:
“Is anyone listening out there? Shall
we close down now or go • on until
stumps?” The result was unbelievable.
Every telephone was ringing at once.
One caller said: “There are 30 of us
here, the beer’s run out, but we’re still
with you.” The next day there were
several thousand letters, 500 telegrams,
and there were presents, cases of
oranges, cases of whisky, wine, and
one group sent in a keg of beer.
'But 3DB did not do the simulated
broadcasts — they turned on a variety
show with commentaries and read the
cables as they came in. There were
appropriate songs for the occasion. For
example, when Sutcliffe was caught by
Homibrook in the Second Test, they
played “Thanks Be to God.” Eventu-
ally, for every fall of a wicket they
played ‘‘Rickety Kate,” and for an Aus-
tralian fall the words showed a pathetic
display of defiance:
“We don’t worry, we’re not cryin’ —
We’re not afraid of the big, bold lion.”
And this was the time that produced
the most deeply moving of all stories
by the late Len Lower.
You must remember it. The year was
1930, the time was 2.30 a.m. Bradman
had passed 300 and the family was
huddled around the loudspeaker of the
wireless set and one of the sons was
putting down all Bradman’s hits on the
back of a player roll.
The burglar dropped his occupation
when he heard a groan from the living-
room. “Wot’s up,” he cried, rushing in.
“Is he out?” “Clean bowled by that
beast Larwood,” sobbed the mother.
“That’s the front door,” said the father.
“Someone answer it.” No one answered
it. “Tate bowling,” said the announcer.
“I suppose I’ll have to go,” grumbled
the burglar. A scream came from the
room as he opened the door. “What’s
wrong here?” said the policeman
sternly. “Richardson’s out for one,”
murmured the burglar in a hoarse voice.
“My God,” exclaimed the police,
rushing in.
So it goes on until 3.45 a.m., and
finally the burglar, forgetting his loot,
goes home muttering: “Any’ow, I don’t
care, 566 is goin’ to take some
catchin.’ ”
Do you get the picture, dear reader?
Nobody is moved like this any more;
perhaps we should ask Mr. Duckmanton
to send some cables to London asking
them to brighten the broadcasts. Mr.
McGilvray and Co. can simulate move-

40,000,000
tons of iron ore
by pipeline
At Savage River, Tasmania, 53 miles of pipeline cut through
some of the roughest country in Australia-over mountains,
across rivers and gorges-in one of the country’s newest
development projects. The miles of pipeline were welded on
site in 30 ft lengths to carry 40 million tons of iron ore
slurry during the next 20 years-every single inch of the
welding with Lincoln equipment-arc welders, electrodes, weld-
ing guns—and by Lincoln-experienced welders.
On BIG welding jobs—the top ones where thousands of man
hours and miles of weld are needed-welding performance and
costs really go under the microscope-resulting in X-ray
quality welds accomplished with minimum waste of materials
and man-hours.
That’s Lincoln-thinking; doing a BIG job at the lowest cost
through advanced welding technology and products. That’s
why professionals on the BIG ones look to Lincoln.

NO DRAMA
ON THE STAGE, BUT
PLENTY OFF IT
THE 1650 people have spent hours
beautifying themselves for tonight:
dinner jackets, turtlenecks, patent
pumps, erotic scents, long dresses, false
hair, false lashes, face-shade, the full
bit. They have eaten early, too, had the
first tiff of the evening, and they are all
heading for Her Majesty’s Theatre, off
Railway Square, Sydney, for the first
night of the opera and are beginning,
on account of the strain of it all, to
feel the first pangs of indigestion.
And there, according to John Young,
administrator of the Elizabethan Opera
Trust Company, they receive the news
that “Tosca” is cancelled and they can
ail turn round and go straight home
again, without so much as a quiver.
Well, no one complains to him.
Actually, no one really believes that
Antonietta Stella, one of La Scala’s
principal singers, and Donald Smith, the
Trust’s principal tenor, could both be
ill and out of action the same day for
the same performance. Well, it’s hap-
pened before, when tenor Giuseppe di

Stefano and accompanist Ivor Newton
were struck with a virus about a year
ago and people were sent home from
Sydney Town Hall. But tonight they’re
saying it’s a students’ rag, and carry on
quizzing everyone’s gala gear and buy-
ing 30-cent programs and the Trust’s
souvenir album full of fun-ads like
Overture to a Masterpiece, referring to
Conzinc Riotinto’s projects, and stars at
the Southern Cross, and Opera isn’t
Opera without Alitalia. On sale at $1 a
time, and designed to remind them of
tonight for ever.
Harry Miller, whose baby this Opera
Subscription Season is, well, he got the
loose strings and pulled ’em together,
has a whole day of horror to remember.
John Young rings him up after lunch
and says are you sitting or standing,
Harry? Because you’d better grab
something. Donald Smith’s gotta raw
throat. Won’t be singing tonight. Jeeze.
Harry nearly faints. Just after six the
phone rings again and Harry, halfway
through his early three-course dinner,
hears John Young’s standing-sitting
routine all over again, apropos of
Antonietta Stella. Jeeze. Harry means
Jeeze. He can hardly tie his new
floppy pussy-bow tie which he’s wear-
ing tonight because turtlenecks are
finally, irrevocably, out. You know, once
they’re mass-produced they’re not H.
Miller. And they ring up the television
and radio channels with the 'hot item
of news that for the first time in the
history of Australian opera an opening
is cancelled, because one thing they
definitely do not want is 1650 patrons
turning up and having to tell ’em to go
home.
“. . . well, where the hell do we go
now?” everyone’s asking when the
penny finally drops, which is roughly
when ten of Mr. Young’s dinner-
jacketed staff are seen flitting up and
down Quay Street stopping cars and
breaking the news . . . “Weil, we can’t
go to Les Girls dressed like this . . .”
Back stage, Madame Stella reclines on
her purple sofa, refusing to see the
Press, refusing to leave until they’ve
gone. Should she be smuggled out?
asks someone. Certainly not. What a
thought. She is finally persuaded to put
on some make-up,
her beige mink coat
with matching hat,
and risk the brutes.
And so it is that a
patient reporter gets
his scoop interview,
which consists of,
“I’m so sorry you’re
ill, Madame Stella,”
to which she replies,
“Hmm.” Outside
the boys are wait-
ing. The star turns
on a 100-watt smile,
climbs into her
chauffeur-d riven
car, and drives off
with two men
nursing a mountain
of first-night
flowers. Kinda wish-
ing they weren’t. And H. Miller bets
when that picture’s published every-
one’ll say, well, she doesn’t look ill.
Meanwhile, back at the theatre,
“Tosca” scenery is coming down and
“The Magic Flute” is going up ready
for tomorrow. On stage the company
is rehearsing “Tannhauser.” Dammit,
they’ve got a hired orchestra, a hired
theatre, and hired singers.- All paid
for. Why waste it all? And baritone
Raymond Myers, who plays the sinister
police chief who hungers lustfully for
the love of Tosca, says sure he’ll show
everyone what happened. He was sit-
ting there in his dressing-room half
made up and surrounded by swords
when he hears a cry for help, and
Madame Stella, she murders him in
“Tosca,” you know, Madame Stella is
lying there by his door. He cannot be-

ON THE STRAIN
OF BEING
PERMANENTLY CONTEMPORARY
ONE OF the difficulties of trying to
lead the cultured life is that you are
always battling to keep up with the
pacesetters. I found this out a long
time ago when I bought a print of
Van Gogh’s Sunflowers , I thought it
would put me slap bang into the ranks
of the avant-garde, but almost immedi-
ately I was disillusioned. Too many
other people had Van Gogh prints, and
the pacesetters had switched to Picasso.
Doggedly and dutifully I plodded on
behind them. Picasso was harder work
than simple old Van Gogh, but I was
young and ambitious and I stuck at it.
Eventually I saw a light at the end of
the tunnel and began saying to people:
“I think I see what Picasso is trying
to do As evidence of my progress I
bought a print of his picture The Three
Musicians. Alas, it was too late. The
pacesetters were saying: “The school of
Paris is finished. Now the Americans,
like Pollock —
No matter how hard you try, the
knowing boys are always a jump ahead.
The contemporary culture marathon
has a Lewis Carroll quality you have
to run like hell just to stay in the same
place. And you feel permanently guilty
for failing to catch up. The great
strength of the pacesetters is their power
to inspire this sense of guilt.
They do it by referring casually to
someone or something you don’t know
about. If a pacesetter has to mention a
familiar name, it reminds him of an
-unfamiliar one. “It is hard to resist the
suspicion that Sidney Nolan in recent
years has been influenced perhaps
subliminally by the structuralism of
Rumpelmayer.” A few words like that
are sufficient to put the Nolan-watchers
in their place. Pale and uneasy, they
wonder: Who is Rumpelmayer? What
is structuralism?
Though art critics are the champions
at this sort of thing, writers on literary
subjects can sometimes do pretty well.
There was an example lately in Max
Harris’ column in “The Australian.”
He said: “A 1 Alvarez found Australians,
even those of developed literary interests
and skills, frighteningly ignorant of the
amazing poetic developments taking
place in Europe. Who has read Holub?”
Mr. Harris touched with the deftness
of the true pacesetter on one of the
weak points of my cultural defences. To
his challenging question: “Who has
read Holub?” I could only reply
sheepishly: “I haven’t.”
A point of interest is that the visiting
critic A 1 Alvarez should have found
such ignorance frightening. From what
I have read of Mr. Alvarez he is a
tough man of letters in the Hemingway-
Graves tradition, who climbs moun-
tains, drives fast cars, and plays poker
for high stakes. He does not sound as
if he would scare easily. Yet we are
led to infer that Mr. Harris saw him
white and trembling at a literary party.
“What’s the matter, Al?” he said.
“You don’t look too good.”
“I—l’m sorry, Max, but I’m feeling
upset.”
“Why—what happened?”
“I was talking to some people about
Holub, and I found they had never
read him. Honestly, these Australians
frighten me!”
“Take a grip on yourself, Al! Get
right back in there talking again before
you lose your nerve . . .”
One has to be impressed by the
earnestness of someone to whom a
knowledge of Holub matters so much.
For full-time pacesetters like Mr.
Alvarez it is of supreme importance to
know what writers and artists are doing
at the present moment. Like Craven
Filter, they belong to the world of
today. Yet I have come to doubt the
view, implied as axiomatic by Mr.
Harris, that it is everyone’s bounden
duty to keep up with contemporary
doings in the arts.
Instead of continually picking up new
authors and dropping old ones, there
is a case for finding those you like and
sticking with them. It is always possible
that they will enjoy a revival. Look
what happened to Galsworthy. The
pacesetters gave him the full snubbing
treatment for a generation, and he
suddenly made a comeback on tele-
vision.
Must we go on, decade after decade,
trailing after the cultural front-runners,
forever straining to keep in radio con-
tact with the Zeitgeist? It becomes tiring-
in the long run. If a person would
rather read Horace than Holub, I don't
think he should necessarily be treated
as an outcast. To the Craven Filter
crowd he can reply that he is a
Benson and Hedges man, for whom
only the best will do.


Fighting the
next election
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
THE TUG-OF-WAR which will de-
cide the issues on which the next
general Federal elections will be fought
has already begun. Labor is clearly
seeking to establish a situation in which
the coming elections will be fought
on domestic matters. The Government
is equally clearly determined that they
will again be fought on issues involv-
ing defence and foreign affairs.
Acting Prime Minister John Mc-
Ewen last week revealed the Govern-
ment’s approach during the Labor
urgency motion on the subsidy designed
to act as an incentive for oil ex-
ploration in Australia. Labor Party
parliamentary executive member Rex
Connor had already revealed the desire
of Labor’s Right Wing to bring the
election fight back to domestic issues.
Referring to the possibility that the
subsidy given for locally found oil
might increase the domestic price of
petrol, Connor said, “Labor will fight
the next general election on this issue.”
Retorted McEwen, “I can understand
the Labor Party wanting an issue other
than the decisions of the Victorian
Labor Party conference held last week-
end. The Labor Party will seek to
avoid the issues raised by the Victorian
ALP conference decisions. I can under-
stand that very well. These are issues
that Labor must avoid.”
The Government is not completely
stupid, though sometimes when you see
such inept bungling as occurred in its
handling of the political aspects of the
amendments to the National Service
Bill tightening up control over young
men seeking to evade National Service
you wonder whether you can make that
statement.
There are those in the Government
like McEwen himself who participated
in the 1949 elections when the Chifley
Labor Government lost power and was
replaced by the Liberal-Country Party
Coalition which has endured to the
present day. Undoubtedly other factors
such as the Chifley Government’s
attempt to nationalise the banks and
general public resentment against war-
time controls still then operating played
their part in bringing down the Chifley
administration. But a factor undoubt-
edly was Labor’s attitude that petrol
must continue to be rationed. The then
Opposition pledged that if returned to
office it would lift petrol rationing with-
out the disastrous consequences which
Labor forecast and went into office to
do precisely that.
Over coming months the Government
will undoubtedly be breaking its neck to
see that prices do not rise unreasonably
because (paradoxically) of the discovery
of domestic oilfields.
It could be that in the long run
Labor is left without this issue. But
as McEwen has justly pointed out Labor
now has to live electorally with the
decisions made at the Victorian ALP
conference. These decisions include the
return to Australia “forthwith” of Aus-
tralian forces in Vietnam and the
repudiation or at least a significant
watering down of the Australian-United
States alliance.
These things are not yet ALP Federal
policy. They are merely notifications by
the Victorian ALP of changes that they
will press for federally. But the history
of ALP foreign policy over recent years
is that when Victoria presses for some-
thing and is backed by such formidable
Labor parliamentary figures as Dr. J. F.
Cairns, Mr. Arthur Calwell, and Mr.
Gordon Bryant, Victoria usually gets
what it wants.
To some extent it is unfair to say
that it is a two-way tug-of-war between
the Government and Labor over what
shall be the next general election
issues. It is really a three-way tug-of-
war. The Government wants the elec-
tions fought on foreign affairs and
defence. Right-wing Labor wants them
fought on domestic issues, so as to avoid
the embarrassment of its Left Wing’s
decisions on foreign affairs and defence.
But Left-wing Labor at least honest
in its approach is prepared to fight
on foreign affairs and defence.
Rightly or wrongly, the Left Wing
believes with the Government that in
the present world situation foreign
affairs and defence are more important
than domestic matters because they
involve the long-term future of the
country. They also believe that world
history is on their side and that, despite
the disastrous electoral outcome of
Labor in the 1966 elections, their poli-
tical prospects would be improved
rather than threatened by fighting on
foreign affairs and defence. They believe
that if the United States-Australian
alliance does not operate for Australia’s
good but to its detriment in its relation-
ships with Asia and the rest of the
world, the ALP should say so instead
of ducking and weaving, as the Right
Wing ducks and weaves to prove that
Labor is just as fervent in its support
of the alliance as the Government.
They also believe and only another
general election would reveal whether
or not they are mistaken that in
the present state of world opinion the
Australian voters would applaud a
declaration that all Australian Forces
in Vietnam be withdrawn “forthwith.”
Although, at this stage, it is impos-
sible to say on what issues the next
general Federal elections will be fought.
Failing some very major domestic issue,
it looks as though Right-wing Labor’s
desire to fight the elections on domestic
issues will be thwarted.
How to celebrate
Captain Cook
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
SOMETHING BETTER will have to
be done to celebrate the 200th anni-
versary of Captain Cook’s landing on
these shores than last week’s suggestion
that the Queen should be asked out
here for the occasion. If that is the
best the N.S.W. and Federal Govern-
ments can produce as an idea, it
might have been better if Captain
Cook had never cast anchor in Botany
Bay.
it is not a question of whether or
not the Queen should be invited. There
are good reasons why she should be
invited, but as Queen of England, the
nation that sent Cook here, not as
Queen of Australia, the nation that is
the principal result of his explorations.
It is up to Australians to celebrate
in their own way Cook’s discovery for
Europeans of the eastern coast of Aus-
tralia. It must be in an Australian
way, and in the way of a power that
borders the Pacific Ocean.
Here are three suggestions:
• The Com'monwealth Government
should invite to the Cook celebrations
high representatives of the nations who
provide the famous ports of the Pacific.
Not only Americans and Japanese and
Filipinos and others who have already
entered the consciousness of Australians
as Pacific powers but Mexicans and
Peruvians and other Latin Americans,
the founders of whose nations were
the archetype explorers and adventurers
of the modern age, the very originators
of the revolutionary globalism of the
modern world. In this there would be
a reminder for us of the idea that
Manning Clark tried to suggest in the
first volume of his “History of Aus-
tralia” that the settlement of Australia
was not an isolated and British thing,
but a fragment in a general explosion
that is still changing the world.
• In co-operation with the New
Zealanders or without their co-opera-
tion if they don’t feel like it, the
Com'monwealth could also establish
a South Pacific Foundation. This
Foundation could concern itself with
assisting the people of the South
Pacific Islands in a more generous way

than is at present happening with
the South Pacific Commisison. It
could provide scholarships to tertiary
education institutions in Australia and
New Zealand; it could formulate .tech-
nical assistance schemes and put them
into action; it could start a kind of
South Pacific Peace Corps; and it could
encourage all kinds of voluntary bodies
to take a practical interest in the South
Pacific islands. Such a scheme would
not cost much. In fact, it could be
funded by reducing Australia House in
London to the size of the Australian
Embassy in Washington. It would be
a reminder that Australia had neigh-
bors not only in South-East Asia but
also in the South-West Pacific. And
it would provide conscience money on
behalf of those Europeans like Cook
whose adventurousness produced such
early disasters in the area they
opened up to European influences.
• The N.S.W. Government should
establish in Sydney a Cook Museum
of the Pacific. Not just a few rooms
devoted to a few relics but a museum
of international standing trying to
explain in museum terms what the
exploration of the Pacific was like. Not
'merely navigators going along the
eastern Australian coast, but also some
dramatic indication of, for example,
the early enterprise of the Chinese or
the famous galleon trade between
Manila and Acapulco, flourishing be-
fore Captain Cook was born.
Even to a government so unimagi-
native about the future of Sydney as
the Government of N.S.W., it must
occur some time that there is money
in tourism, and that more people are
likely to come to Sydney if Sydney
offers them something to see. By a
number of expensive flukes Sydney is
providing an opera house that inter-
national visitors will find worth visit-
ing: at much less expense Sydney
should be able to provide half a dozen
museu'ms that are also worth seeing.
A Cook Museum of the Pacific (per-
haps looking out at the Pacific from
land regained from the Commonwealth
on Sydney Harbor’s South Head)
would make a good start: the Convict
Museum that Sydney obviously needs
should not wait until the bi-centenary
celebrations of the First Settlement in
1988.
However, it is not just a matter of
the natives putting their hands into the
tourists’ pockets. It is ti'me that, in
Sydney, there were established per-
manent reminders to Sydney people
(and to Australians generally) of what
their history is and the kind of people
they are. Perhaps the N.S.W. Govern-
ment will produce nothing better in
1970 than one of its predecessors
achieved in the sesqui-centenary cele-
brations of 1938 (the last time Sydney
celebrated itself). This awful possi-
bility was already being contemplated
last week in Sydney. If it proves to
be so, it would leave one wondering
why men with 1938 minds could be in
power 30 years later.

IF ONE CAN BELIEVE
THE MOTORING EXPERTS
(AND WE DO) EACH OF
OUR THREE DIFFERENT
ROVER 2000'S IS THE
FINEST CAR IN
THE WORLD.
DOES THAT MAKE YOUR
CHOICE HARDER OR
EASIER?
You now have a choice of three Rover
2000’s: single carburettor (S.C.), twin car-
burettor (T.C.) and Automatic. Of our S.C.
model, "Wheels" says: "A magnificent
motor car that stands as the world's finest
argument against the people who would
eliminate fast cars." Of our T.C. model,
"Car and Driver” says: "We believe that
the Rover 2000 TC is absolutely the best
sedan that has ever been presented in the
pages of this magazine." Of our Automatic
model, “Road Test” says: “Our previous
consensus that the Rover 2000 is amongst
the finest cars in the world is enhanced by
the addition of the Automatic.” At first sight
this plethora of praise may tend to make
your choice more difficult. But in fact it’s
fairly straight sailing if you think of it like
this: The S.C. model costs the least and has
enough power (0-100 in 45 secs.) to keep
all but the most ardent enthusiasts purring.
It has so many safety features (about fifty)
that it consistently takes out the top safety
awards around the world. It has bucket
seats (both front and rear) which have been
called the most comfortable in the world,
with particular regard for the small of the
back. Other creature comforts include
genuine leather upholstery, wall-to-wall
carpeting and a virtuoso heating and ven-
tilating system. Plus, of course, typically
Rover-ish touches like an electric clock
and a steering wheel that adjusts up and
down to suit you. The road-holding and
braking of the 2000 SC are legendary, so
much so that the motoring writers of the
world are still inventing superlatives to
describe them. The T.C. model has all the
above plus an 18% lift in horsepower that
makes it a very hot motor car indeed. (It
also has a tachometer of the hero-driver
genre for the benefit of enthusiasts like
Jack Fury.) The Automatic, likewise, has all
the features of the S.C. model with the
added advantage of clutchless driving. (In
fact, you can drive this one either auto-
matically or manually.) Well, there it is. Now
all you need is an hour or so to test drive
the one that is you.

Capital reaction: “Gorton’s
getting back on beam”
WITH PARLIAMENTARIANS busily
rushing through the last legislation of
the session, preparing to go a-tripping
overseas or simply keen to get home out
of the cold of Canberra, not many of
the nation’s tribunes last week could
find time to think or talk about the
great issues of the day. Nevertheless,
in such reactions as they had to the
Five Power talks in Kuala Lumpur
and the Prime Minister’s pronounce-
ment on his South-East Asian tour,
Government members seemed happier
than they have been at any time since
May 8, when Mr. Gorton made his
famous speech to the Government
Parties at which he enunciated his
dams-before-defence priority and talked
of the need to “get white faces out of
Asia.”
“It looks as if Gorton’s getting
back on beam,” was a pretty typical
comment from Liberal parliamentar-
ians last week. They said he had
obviously revised his thinking about
the future of South-East Asia, abandon-
ing the idea he had expressed privately
on a number of occasions in April that
the Americans would go from Asia in
the way the British are withdrawing.
He no longer takes seriously the view
that all the dominoes are about to fall.
Officials were also pretty happy with
Mr. Gorton’s performance, though
some are worried about his Nui Dat
claim that the Paris talks “are not
peace talks,” only “preliminary talks
to see whether there is any basis for
a chance to have talks later.”
“He will obviously get something of
a drubbing, now he’s back home, for his
claim that 90 percent of Australians
supported what our troops are doing.
A bit of political poetic licence there,”
said one official. But officials thought
he had been badly and unfairly mis-
quoted by commentators who inter-
preted him as writing off all oppon-
ents of Government policy as “nuts.”
Quoting from the text of his speech
to the troops, they pointed out that he
had used the term “nut” only in refer-
ence to demonstrators who carried
placards or engaged in sit-downs.
There was criticism, too, of com-
mentators’ descriptions of Mr. Gorton’s
speeches as “hawkish.” Officials
claimed that Mr. Gorton had only been
making the point that as long as the
Communists maintained their military
pressure, the Allies must respond by
keeping up their defensive efforts in
South Vietnam. The talks in Paris did
not alter that principle. Some said
bitterly that these days some Press
commentators branded a man as a
hawk if he advocated anything but
capitulation in the face of Communist
military assaults.
By his speech to Australian troops,
Mr. Gorton indicated for the first time
that he thought the outcome in Viet-
nam was very important: “You are
doing a magnificent job for our
country. I feel the result will be felt
in our country for decades to come.”
Up to this time he had given the im-
pression that the Vietnam War was of
relatively minor significance to Aus-
tralia and that his new Government
was far less concerned about the out-
come than the Holt Government.
The Kuala Lumpur talks provoked
a wide range of comment in Canberra.
Those who wish for Australia to take
an active, initiating role in developing
regional co-operation expressed dis-
appointment. “We gave the impression
of being reluctantly dragged along,
making the absolute minimum of com-
mitments, and generating the absolute
minimum of influence,” said one critic
who described Australian policy as a
display of defensive diplomacy in a
situation where Australia should be
acting creatively and positively. He
expressed sympathy with Singaporean
Goh Kong Swee’s reported comment
that the Australians “made well-
meaning gurgling noises.”
But officials who have been privy to
the Cabinet and departmental discus-
sions on Malaysian-Singapore defence
expressed themselves well satisfied with
the outcome of the talks. They said
there had been a real possibility at
one stage that Mr. Gorton might have
insisted on announcing that Australia
would withdraw troops with the British
but now all the options have been
kept open, and Australia has, in general
terms, committed itself to a continuing
role. “All the implications and in-
nuendos in the communique point to
that,” claimed an External Affairs man.
“From a Hasluckian, External Affairs
Department viewpoint the conference
outcome was favorable.” However, he
was forced to admit that the Australian
posture was a retreat from Mr. Has-
luck’s February statements in Kuala
Lumpur when he said: “1971 is not
a point of timetable as far as we are
concerned. It is a date that is significant
(only) to the British. But for the
Malaysians and the Australians 1971
does not terminate anything. We have
to work out our own relationships . . .”
That Australia is still involved in an
“ongoing situation” in Malaysia-
Singapore has been a favorite phrase
of the policymakers. Australia is now
committed to a role in a broad range
of defence planning in the area in
running the jungle-training school at
Kota Tinggi, in the joint air defence set-
up, in aid and training, and in joint
exercising and planning activities. And
Australia has not mentioned any with-
drawal of ground troops. To dissociate
from this ongoing situation in the
future would be a major step for Mr.
Gorton, or any other Prime Minister.
It is now felt in Canberra that Aus-
Prime Minister Gorton talking with Singapore Army training leader Colonel Ronnie
Wee. In the background, Israeli adviser Lieut.-Colonel Jehuda Golan


tralia’s air and naval presence in the
Singapore-Malaysia area is certain to
be maintained beyond 1971, when the
British withdraw. The army troops
presently based at Terendak are quite
likely to be “de-garrisoned,” in the
word being bandied around the
Defence Department. Units would be
rotated through Malaysia more quickly
so that troops could be sent there with-
out their families, so enabling the ex-
pensive housing, schools, hospitals, and
swimming-pools of a garrison base to
be done without.
Army people insist that the rotation
of army units through Malaysia is
essential both for Australian training
and in order to help develop Malay-
sian-Singaporean army units. In-
dividual instructors, they say, have
proved to be no substitute for the
presence of formed units to which
Malaysian officers and NCOs can be
attached and with which they can co-
operate in a continuing series of joint
exercises.
The future of general Australian
defence policy is, however, hardly
“firmed up” yet following the Kuala
Lumpur talks. After Mr. Gorton’s
sensational May 8 speech, the Defence
Committee ordered a major reappraisal
of Australian strategy, and for about
six weeks now a group of people in
the planning section of the Defence
Department have been working at a
hectic pace on hypothetical position
papers on likely threats to Australian
security in the ’seventies. It is said to be
the broadest review since the Labor
Government fell in 1949. Lately, the
Defence Department has thought and
worked entirely within the Menzies-
Holt policies of maintaining a small
token military presence in Asia.
The Budget this year will, it is said,
provide for no expansion of the defence
forces, except possibly a small expan-
sion of the CMF in deference to Mr.
Gorton’s Israeli whims. On present
Government planning, serious expan-
sion and remoulding of Australia’s de-
fence effort is impossible before next
year. The Defence Department’s major
strategic reassessment will be in some
sort of shape by about August. Another
few months will be needed to work out
the hardware and financial require-
ments so no real defence plan
before November.
MPs' salaries
Not so much "How
much?" but "How?"
IT LOOKS like being a Gorton budget
this year, which means that extra money
will go heavily in the directions of
Social Services and Development, with
Defence picking up few crumbs. The
pensioners will almost certainly—under
Gorton-Wentworth patronage-Ado well.
And with pensioners getting a rise, so
may another little hand of people who
live on the public purse: the Parlia-
mentarians.
It is four years since Federal poli-
ticians got a rise, and a strong cam-
paign has been mounted over the past
three months for this to be remedied.
But the politicians do not just want a
cost-of-living adjustment, so to speak.
They want a rise in their margins, so
that their relative salary position is
adjusted upwards.
At present they have a salary of
$7OOO. In Canberra this puts them on
a par with Class 8 officers in the third
division of the Public Service, about a
dozen levels down from the top. It is
a salary level which an average uni-
versity graduate joining the Govern-
ment service can expect to get by the
age of 30.
Parliamentarians were once paid at
the same level as Arbitration Commis-
sioners and second division officers in
the Commonwealth service. Now they
are $5OOO behind.
“The Parliamentarian gets paid less
than the Public Servants who consult
him, the reporters who interview him,
the TV cameramen who photograph
him,” said Mr. Edward St. John, MP,
who is leading the campaign. “Politics
was once an occupation for unpaid
gentlemen, then for part-time amateurs,
and today I feel it is becoming a job
for professionals.”
Mr. St. John himself has demon-
strated his seriousness by completely
abandoning his well-established legal
practice and devoting himself fully to
his life as a Parliamentarian. One of
his difficulties is that many fellow poli-
ticians are still part-time amateurs.
Sometimes they keep another job going
because they have to, or as an insurance
against the time when the electors may
sack them. But a good number would
probably keep up their other occupa-
tion however secure and well paid they
were as Parliamentarians.
The reason Parliamentarians are so
poorly paid is quite simple. They are
dead scared of the public reaction to
moves for improving their salaries. But
Mr. Gorton, who last year as Minister
for Education did not quibble at raising
the salaries of university professors from
$10,400 to $12,000, is said to have
agreed privately that in principle Parlia-
mentarians should now get a substantial
rise.
It is simply a question of when, how,
and how much. The “when” is limited
by the fact that, with the Labor Party
in an almost unprecedented mess, the
Government is very tempted to find a
reason for holding an election this year.
Until this is ruled out as a possibility,
since it is an article of political faith
that you do not let such sensitive
matters muck up an election campaign,
the Government is not likely to move
on parliamentary salaries.
All parties except the DLP support
higher parliamentary salaries, but with
Edward. St. John...full-time pro-
fessional
its amazing political skill and vigor the
DLP can cause terrible havoc when on
a popular issue like this, even when it
has all the other parties lined up against
it. Its success in the nexus referendum
last year under these circumstances is
well remembered by other parties.
Mr. St. John himself would like the
issue right out in the open: “I believe
we have an overwhelmingly powerful
case for more pay. I would like to see
us presenting this case to an indepen-
dent arbitration tribunal. It would give
the public a better appreciation of the
strength of that case, and most impor-
tant it would enable objectors to state
their case.”
A lot of criticism of past rises in
parliamentary salaries has concentrated
on the means by which they were
gained: simply 'by the MPs voting
themselves the extra money in a few
minutes of parliamentary work. The
tribunal idea of Mr. St. John is one
way around this. Another more likely
idea is that parliamentary salaries will
be geared to the salary scales of the
public or the judiciary. They would
then rise automatically with the pay
rises of the great bulk of Government
employees, following arbitration pro-
ceedings conducted by public-service
unions.
It is quite likely that for the time
being Parliamentarians will be geared
into the base salary level of the second
division of the Commonwealth service,
the junior grade assistant-secretary,
which at present means $9600 a year.
South Australia
Wooing Millicent
ON BEING asked recently by a Syd-
ney journalist whether he belonged to
the Left or Right wing of the ALP, the
South Australian Opposition Leader,
Don Dunstan, replied mildly, “I need
both wings to fly.” It was a politic re-
joinder shortly before the long week-


end’s ALP conferences when it was
clear that in the Sydney and Mel-
bourne ALP aviaries there was to be
a great deal of wing-clipping.
Back in South Australia the Milli-
cent by-election campaign was well
under way and had Mr. Dunstan
allowed himself to be drawn into the
sectional fight it would certainly have
been used against the ALP in the by-
election.
As it was, the 65t.h conference set
standards of harmony sufficient to
grace any South Australian vicarage,
and when Federal Leaders Whitlam,
Wyndham, and Keefe delivered their
addresses they were circumspect, polite,
and almost entirely conciliatory in tone
and manner. Mr. Dunstan simply sat
back, the acknowledged parliamentary
leader, with both his wings folded.
Down in Millicent his wife, Gretel,
was door-knocking, conversing in
German with German settlers, drinking
a beer with the locals while watching
footy at Tantanoola. In towns through-
out the area canvassing continued
and public meetings were held with
Premier Hall and Mrs. Hall joining
in for a time. Rival canvassers
occasionally found themselves operating
only a matter of doors away from each
other while townsfolk stared at the
white ministerial cars as they cruised
through the main streets. As the week
wore on the local shopkeepers made
sure that all parties’ display boards
had equal prominence in their windows,
carefully giving offence to none, while
at home harassed housewives con-
signed batches of pamphlets to in-
cinerators.
But no 'matter what the professional
LCL and ALP organisers from Ade-
laide could do they were prepared to
concede that the result would again
be close and that the crucial electoral
reform issue meant much less to the
citizens than whether or not they simply
like one or other of the local candi-
dates as a bloke. The issues are fin-
ally parochial. ALP candidate Des
Corcoran is very well known and with
his father the Corcoran family has
held the seat of Millicent and before
that the seat of Victoria for many
years. On the other hand, LCL candi-
date Martin Cameron is a local farmer
and seed ’merchant who has, over the
past three years, worked very hard in
the electorate building up considerable
support in some of the fishing towns.
So, on Saturday when the people of
Millicent go to the polls, the deciding
factor is likely to be whether Des
Corcoran, no longer Minister of Lands
and so now back in town, has regained
his personal following. It could be that
his loss in the March elections of his
23 percent 1965 lead was directed
more at the Party and Government than
the man. It will also hinge on whether
the chronically discontented local fish-
ermen are satisfied with the working of
fishing controls introduced at their re-
quest by the previous Government, and
on the performance of the DLP candi-
date Douglas Barnes, a fishing inspector
from Port Lincoln on the State’s west
coast.
It’s hard to estimate just what effect
Labor’s Des Corcoran...keeping it
in the family
the DLP will have on the election.
Against Des Corcoran’s father, who was
very proud of his Irish-Catholic back-
ground, they showed up very badly.
But in another close result the DLP
preference could operate entirely in the
LCL’s favor.
Along with the fact that he’s a nice
chap, Mr. Corcoran’s campaign strategy
has been that the Government won’t
be changed if he wins and that it won’t
be changed this century if the LCL
wins. It is a sensible point to hammer
home to an electorate which appears
more interested in voting for a candi-
date who is at home when they call
than in the finer points of electoral
reform. It appeals to the fair-go syn-
drome and may influence a small, but
a crucial, sector. For his part, Mr.
Cameron is stressing the need for a
constitutional LCL majority, arguing
that this would guarantee the country
man a strong voice in State politics.
This will, no doubt, have definite
appeal. The DLP, preferences apart,
contends that both the LCL and ALP
are only interested in maintaining a
generally inequitable electoral set-up, an
idea Millicent will easily understand.
APOLOGY
In “Out and About” of the last issue
of The Bulletin it was stated that Dame
Zara Holt and shop “Magg” are get-
ting out of the Double Bay shopping
centre.
We have now been informed that this
is incorrect and that neither “Magg”
nor Dame Zara Holt intends closing
down the shop in Double Bay.
The Bulletin regrets the error and
apologises to Dame Zara Holt and to
“Magg” for the injury caused thereby.
Education
Examining exams
WHEN the Victorian Minister of
Education, Mr. Lindsay Thompson,
agreed last week that the school
examination system placed undue
strain on some students it did not mean
that Victorian students could take a
breather. The abolition of the examina-
tion system is still years away.
Mr. Thompson was commenting on
Mr. I. T. Maddern’s cogently argued
20-page pamphlet “The Trouble with
Examinations” a broadside which
the principal of Morwell High School
had levelled against the State examina-
tion system.
Mr. Maddern argued that by
becoming a self-justifying institution,
examinations had obscured their in-
tended purpose, which was supposed to
be the measuring of intelligence. From
(the premise that education ifieant the
ability to think, he argued that the mere
regurgitation of knowledge was no sub-
stitute for clear and original thinking.
Not only did exams cause students
anguish, despair, and humiliation, they
had, in extreme cases, led to mental
illness and even suicide. Students were
put through the hoops, despite the fact
that, for an arbitrary percentage, the
exercise would be futile. In a competi-
tive examination a certain number must
fail. Further, there were many instances
of widely different standards of marking
in different courses. Every school, Mr.
Maddern wrote, had stories about the
injustices of the Commonwealth
Scholarships.
In short, exams were “very inaccurate,

Thompson...strain on some

wasteful, unnecessary, and a clumsy
method of attempting to find out what
teachers know already.”
Mr. Maddern advocated in their
place the simple method of teacher
assessments, in which, at the end of
each year, the student would be advised
whether he could hope to complete
the following year.
Hostile as the pamphlet seemed,
Mr. Maddern was actually playing host
to the authorities in the week his
pamphlet came out. The Victorian
Universities and Schools Examination
Board was visiting schools in Gippsland,
where one of two pilot projects is being
conducted under the board’s super-
vision.
The projects attempt to achieve com-
patibility in teachers’ assessments by a
process of “moderation.” The method
is similar to one currently being used
in England. Teachers of the same sub-
ject meet regularly to compare and
adjust their marking in the hope that
“comparable, but not uniform,
standards” may be reached across the
State.
The board’s research officer, Dr.
R. G. Rowlands, said the board was
anxious to eliminate the bad effects of
exams. “But,” he said, “the board can
only abolish exams when there is
strong evidence that there is a better
method.” Tasmania had already
developed a moderating scheme which
it was more or less committed to, and
Western Australia was also tackling the
problem. “They don’t have exam-
inations in the formal sense, but have
an achievement certificate which rep-
resents the cumulative assessment of
projects, tests, and assignments.”
Although many schools in Victoria
no longer have external examinations
until final year, the university entrance
examination still dominates the last two
or three years of school.
Mr. Maddern, Dr. Rowlands, and
Mr. Brian Conway, the secretary of
the Victorian Secondary Teachers’
Association, all agreed that matricula-
tion would have to be changed. As
Mr. Conway said: “Why should edu-
cation be dominated by an examination
that is meaningless to most people?”
New Zealand
Pre-election infighting
NEW ZEALAND faces a general elec-
tion next year with a Parliamentary
session beginning June 26 and a by-
election for the seat held by former
Prime Minister Sir Walter Nash as
curtain-raisers.
The substance of New Zealand
politics at present probably lies in the
highest number of unemployed since
the Depression ’thirties and potential
industrial unrest if an awaited general
wage order leaves unionists relatively
worse off since devaluation and sub-
sequent inflation.
The Labor Leader of the Opposition,
Mr. Norman Kirk, has claimed that
the Prime Minister, Mr. Holyoake, has
delayed the opening of Parliament until
the last statutory permissible moment
“no doubt due to his unwillingness to
stand test on such matters as mounting
unemployment, the Government’s
refusal to hold a public inquiry into
the bribing of Customs officers, the
civil defence fiasco, and the shameful
administration of the Health portfolio.”
However, it seems that Norman Kirk
faces his own te9t. The Prime Minister-
ship may elude him despite the antag-
onism economic conditions have created
for the Government. There is a chance
that the economy could pick up, and
also a chance that the protest-based
Social Credit Party could gain the
balance of power and leave Kirk in the
wilderness.
Finance Minister Muldoon has sug-
gested there will be “no fireworks” on
budget night. Thriving on the good
political mileage he has got from what
he described in a letter to New
Zealand’s creditor, the International
Monetary Fund, as “fortuitous circum-
stances” which provided a $1 million
surplus in New Zealand’s foreign
reserves, he has set himself up as an
assessor of would-be Prime Ministers.
In the uncertainty about Mr. Holy-
oake’s retirement, the intentions of Mr.
Muldoon’s exercises are read as efforts
to groom himself for the inner circle
of Cabinet and the Prime Ministership.
“Unfit” is his estimate of Mr. Kirk as
a possible Prime Minister. But Labor
can easily see Mr. Muldoon coming, and
unless he outwits them their response
will be to sidestep him with studied
indifference that keeps its eye on the
voter who is looking for the substance,
not the shadow.
The National Development Confer-
ence, which will deliberate off and on
until next March, will remove from the
Parliamentary arena. Labor’s chance to
make some of the points about plan-
ning and the development of the
economy. Mr. Muldoon also awaits
insights from the education committee
of the conference to show him how to
cope with the increases in the co9t of
higher education.
The Government’s interest will be in
the side issues in the near future.
Labor’s will be in keeping attention
focused on the central economic
problems and Labor’s ability to provide
answers.

They earn a diploma in specialised car
care skills and mechanical services like
scientific wheel balancing and alignment,
headlight aiming, thorough brake and
automatic transmission service and how
to tune your engine to run sweetly.
Most times you’ll simply ask your Shell
Sentinel dealer for a tankfull
of Super Shell, but some day you will want
something more.
That’s when it’s good to know you
can be sure of your Shell Sentinel dealer’s
skills. Look for the Sentinel sign and
get that sure feeling knowing your car’s
running the way it should.
Go
well:

OVERSEAS
Sharing the Kennedy legacy
Nixon at his daughter’s graduation in New York
Humphrey, heir presumptive?
Rockefeller. .. first back on the trail
McCarthy under guard in Boston
THE OBSEQUIES of Senator Robert
Kennedy were not long over and the
crowds were lining up to troop past
his grave when the little conclaves
began to gather in Washington houses,
the men who had served him and those
who had fought him, discussing in
their separate groups where to go and
what to do next. Had President John
Kennedy not been murdered in 1963,
many of the men who worked this
year for his younger brother would
now have been members of a Kennedy
Administration, and if they had gone
campaigning it would have been in
defence of that Administration’s record.
Things fell out otherwise; they drifted
away from President Kennedy’s succes-
sor in twos and threes and eventually
gathered round the brother of their
dead leader to attack the Johnson
Administration and to demand a fresh
start. Now the brother has been killed
in turn and the leadership of the attack
snatched from them.
This happened at a moment when
they had managed to seize the lead
among the rebels by defeating Senator
McCarthy in most of the Primary
elections for the Democratic nomina-
tion, but when it was also becoming
reasonably plain that the leadership of
the whole Party lay beyond Senator
Robert Kennedy’s grasp. But, even
while the two rebel factions were
fighting it out in the Primary elec-
tions, their Party was displaying its
powers of resistance to rebellion. The
convention delegates were rallying
round Vice-President Humphrey, the
candidate of vindication of the
Administration’s record, whose answer
to the prophets of gloom is to point
with pride and warmth to the onward
march of mankind.
His position as Mr. Johnson’s Vice-
President and his inescapable role as
rescuer of his Party from division and
self-doubt impose certain disabilities
on Mr. Humphrey. He is genuinely
a warm, good man, he inspires trust and
affection, and, to people alarmed and
repelled by all the criticism and bicker-
ing, he is a natural refuge. But the
year’s political storms were generated,
after all, by the divisions that exist in
the nation about the war in Vietnam
and the clamor of social and racial
grievances. The Democratic Party is
still what it has always been, a coalition
of reforming forces with conservative
forces. That its desperate elements have
been growing further apart merely re-
flects the developing antitheses in
American society at large. But the
Party’s rebellion against President John-
son has brought some of the conflicts
into the open and made them un-
manageable.
By sticking close to themes of unity
and brotherhood Mr. Humphrey can,
as it now seems, hold together a suffi-
cient alliance drawn from the big
cities, the trade unions, the business
interests, the European ethnic groups,
the old-style Negro movements, the
southern conservatives to be sure of
the presidential nomination in the
absence of some new unpredictable
sequence of external or internal events.
But the rebels, who from their per-
formance in the Primary elections seem
to command a very large following
among Democratic voters (though not
among Party officials) in almost every
region of the country except the South,
are unlikely to be won back into the
fold by vindication and brotherly love.
Some of Mr. Robert Kennedy’s fol-
lowers say that they would be willing
to join Mr. Humphrey if he would
differentiate his position on the Viet-
nam War from that of Mr. Johnson.
But how can he, even if his own con-
victions would permit it, without mak-
ing more trouble for himself in other
quarters? The Negro poor and their
friends would want some kind of
assurance about the domestic policy of
a Humphrey Administration; that
would make trouble, too. Once elected,
Mr. Humphrey might well turn out
to be a President reasonably acceptable
to some groups, at least, among the
rebel Democrats. But how he can per-
suade them of this in advance without
incensing other powerful groups and
losing support either to the Republicans
or, in some States, to Mr. George
Wallace, the reactionary independent,
is a puzzle.
Some of Senator Robert Kennedy’s
supporters will go to Mr. Humphrey,
all the same. Not a few of them have
served until quite recently in the
Johnson Administration and are
naturally averse to abstention from
politics and government; although
loyalty or intellectual preference led
men of this kind to join the Kennedy
standard, now that it has been
lowered in death they may see no hard
obstacle of principle to offering their
service to the probable nominee of
their Party. The one remaining Ken-
nedy brother, much as he is liked and


even admired, is not ready to take the
place of his murdered elders, does not
intend to give a lead by attaching him-
self to one or other of the surviving
Democratic candidates, and is even dis-
inclined to advise the Kennedy follow-
ing about what it should do.
Senator Robert Kennedy in his last
weeks, and conspicuously in the last
hour in Los Angeles before he was shot,
was urging a union of his forces and
those of Senator McCarthy, subordi-
nating their differences of personality
to their agreement about many of the
issues. But Mr. McCarthy’s unconcealed
dislike of Robert Kennedy rankles with
his followers, whose devotion to their
chief was personal and strong. There
are also some aspects of Mr. Mc-
Carthy’s political character that they
do not like; these are not questions of
what ought to be done about this or
that problem but of how much ought
to be done and how the Presidency
ought to be conducted. Kennedy men
are activists: they like government,
they find political institutions fasci-
nating and itch to put them to work.
Their complaint against President
Johnson is that he does the wrong
things, or does them in the wrong way
not that he does too much. But
a reading of Mr. McCarthy’s speeches
over the past two or three months has
shown him developing, or at least
experimenting with, a model of the
Presidency that would be restrained in
its impulses, diffident and inclined to
non-interference in matters that could
be left to the individual or to society
to sort out. This is by no means the
concept of government favored by the
Kennedy supporters, one of whom said
this week that Mr. McCarthy “would
make a fine President if you could hold
his interest after six months.”
There are exceptions, thus Mr.
Richard Goodwin, who left Mr. Mc-
Carthy to join Mr. Robert Kennedy
in March, has offered to work for Mr.
McCarthy again. But the more com-
mon reaction of the Kennedy sup-
porters, who also cannot see how Mr.
McCarthy can posssibly win the nom-
ination away from Mr. Humphrey,
seems to be to shun an enterprise which
they find neither exhilarating nor likely
to be fruitful. Even more than the
active planners and workers in the
national campaign, this feeling is likely
to sway the convention delegates won
by the late Senator in the various States,
practical men working in local politics;
they have to take their votes some-
where, and Mr. Humphrey, the heir-
presumptive, looks like gathering most
of them.
First among the presidential candi-
dates to get back on the campaign trail
after the appalling event of Kennedy’s
slaying was the one with least time
to spare, Governor Nelson Rockefeller.
Sensible, authoritative, alert, he is pre-
pared to be brutal in contrasting his
own record of electoral success with
Mr. Richard Nixon’s narrow defeat in
the presidential election of 1960 and
his disaster in the contest for the
Governorship of California two years
later. Unlike Mr. Nixon, Mr. Rocke-
feller explains, he will not lose the big
States by failing to carry the big cities.
Unlike Mr. Nixon, he can offer him-
self as the natural champion of the
causes which Mr. Robert Kennedy
represented. He can provide a political
home for the groups left most desolate
by Mr. Kennedy’s death, the Negroes
and the urban poor.
Nevertheless, though Mr. Rockefeller
is prepared to campaign and campaign
extensively between now and the Re-
publican convention at Miami Beach on
August 5, he must know that the Re-
publican nomination is securely in Mr.
Nixon’s hands if any certainty exists
in this unpredictable summer. If nom-
inated, Mr. Rockefeller would probably
be elected and few people who know
him doubt that he would make a good
President. But Mr. Nixon has tilled the
Party soil, his garden is full of dele-
gates, and the old argument against
him, that he cannot bring in the popu-
lar vote, has been much weakened by
his excellent performance in the
Primary elections. The country is
worried about violence, turbulence, and
factious division at home and about an
unsuccessful foreign war. For Mr.
Nixon, embodying tranquillity and
authority, to represent the Democrats
as the Party of trouble ought not to
be too difficult. The Republican Party
faithful, when they contemplate the
outlook for November, see no com-
pelling reason to make a change.
France
Papering the cracks
AWAKENING from six weeks of
delirium—part euphoric dream, part
nightmare—the French are reaching out
to touch the world about them to see
if it is real.
They discover with dazed relief that
children can go to school, planes take
off, that rubbish is cleared away, and
that Paris can even spend a night un-
disturbed by bangs. Tired, cynical faces
of politicians mouth reassuring cant
from the television screens.
But all this is so much flimsy paper
over the cracks. France is not back to
normal. It remains in an extremely
fragile, barely convalescent state. At
every level there is profound concern
about the future, in spite of Premier
M. Pompidou’s unflappability and it
was he rather than General de Gaulle
who kept his nerve in the crisis. People
know that the complacent years of
Gaullism will not return.
And yet the Government is indulging
in a bout of self-congratulation: the last
strikes are ending, the election cam-
paign is in full swing, the revolutionary
movement has been decapitated, or so
it seems.
“Our policy has been patience and
firmness with a little more firmness
every day,” M. Pompidou declared,
when news reached him on Friday
morning that the red flag had been
hauled down from the Odeon Theatre
and its ragamuffin squatters evicted
after a month of “revolutionary occupa-
tion.”
This recovery of State property was
the latest act in the Government’s un-
folding counter-revolutionary strategy.
After what has seemed weeks of panicky
indecision, the authorities banned
demonstrations throughout France,
expelled 150 foreign “agitators,” and
outlawed the hard-core extremist move-
ments, mainly Trotskyist or pro-Chinese
in inspiration, who were largely respon-
sible for detonating the revolution and
for fanning the flames whenever they
seemed likely to die down.
The violence to which the Govern-
ment reacted last week spread from
workers to students and back again,
like a spark leaping between two
points. A schoolboy demonstrator was
drowned in the Seine near the Renault
factory at Flins. Two Peugeot workers
died in Eastern France. A student
demonstration in Paris on Tuesday
night led the police in a savage game
of hide and seek across the city.
Apologists claim that the Govern-
Paris... back to work but hardly
normal
ment’s tactic has been to give the
revolutionaries enough rope to hang
themselves; it has been strength, not
weakness, to face the public charge of
vacillation and let the revolution run its
violent, breathless course. The prob-
lem was to decide when td step in
and deliver the coup de grace —with-
out too much gore in the gutters.
Last Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting
decided on immediate repression, in
the belief that the public, exasperated
and frightened, was now ready to
support stern measures. On the other
side of the barricades, the analysis of
the situation is very different. In spite
of the ban on them, most of the
revolutionary groups view the up-
heavals of the past six weeks with
unconcealed satisfaction. They have


succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.
They have not demobilised, but gone
underground.
The principal lessons for the revolu-
tionaries whether Trotskyist, Maoist,
or members of Cohn - Bendit’s
anarchist-tinged 22 March Movement
—is that the strategy of direct action
and unrelenting provocation has paid
off a thousandfold.
The Trotskyists played the most
vital part in sparking off the revolu-
tion and provide the most coherent
analysis of it. In their view, a tiny
revolutionary avant garde detonated a
large-scale semi-spontaneous movement
of student protest. This mass, generat-
ing its own dynamic and only loosely
controlled by the revolutionary “core,”
clashed with the police, threw up
barricades, bred a legend of heroism,
occupied the universities.
The students’ fighting example then
fired the workers to “strike and occupy”
in turn. This was the next and vital
stage. It was as if the industrial
working class, long lulled by the prizes
of a consumer society, had forgotten
techniques of militancy. The great
strike of nine million workers unfurled
across France.
It is at this point that Trotskyists
get really excited. They are not par-
ticularly interested in university reform
or student power. It is the workers
they are after, living docilely under
the cane of that prim old governess
the orthodox Communist Party.
Their thesis is that between May 25
and 30 in the week de Gaulle
left Paris to consult his Army chiefs in
Germany the workers could have
seized power in France. Revolution was
within their grasp. It was only frus-
trated 'because of the timidity they
would say treachery of the French
Communist leaders. The Trotskyist
objective is to challenge this leader-
ship in every factory, and eventually
to break it. The Communists thought
they had buried Trotsky. Now, to their
horror, he stalks again.
The Trotskyists realise that the
Communist-dominated trade union
federation, the CGT, is strong, that a
rival revolutionary leadership on the
factory floor cannot be created by
propaganda. It can be forged only in
combat. Hence their strategy of per-
sistent and continuous provocation, of
seeking clashes, of inviting repression,
of glorying in police charges, and in
revolutionary martyrs.
The key question not yet ans-
wered in the aftermath of the
French crisis is: how far is their satis-
faction justified? What inroads have
they made at the base of the CGT?
Is there now a revolutionary embryo in
the French proletariat?
All eyes were focused on the fair-
ground of the Sorbonne, where the
Arts faculty, occupied by students since
May 13, was ordered closed by the
Government on Sunday, so that it
would cease to be “an inn,” and return
to its proper function as an educational
institution. But it is the revival of
working-class militancy and the
defensive measures this will generate
that threatens the stability of Western
Europe.
Vietnam
Saigon's ordeal
CIVILIAN LOSSES since the “second
wave” attack on greater Saigon began
on May 5 are now officially estimated
at 16,000 houses destroyed, . 160,000
people made refugees, and more than
400 killed. But these figures give little
idea of the overall impact of the fight-
ing on the city. Most of Saigon remains
physically undamaged. But where
there is devastation, it is almost com-
plete. The eighth precinct, for example,
home of South Vietnam’s only urban
community development program, lost
more than 8000 houses after heavy air
and ground 'bombardment by Govern-
ment forces in early May. This was a
poor area of one-storey masonry houses
inhabited largely by refugees from the
countryside; many of these second-
time refugees are now living in a
muddy shanty-town at the edge of the
ruins.
The eighth-precinct tragedy, fol-
Devastated Cholon, scene of the worst fighting against Viet Cong guerillas. In
Saigon, children shovel sand into bags for anti-rocket fortifications
lowed by the accidental killing of the
Saigon police chief and five senior
officers by an American helicopter
three weeks ago, have led to restrictions
on the use of firepower. For all that,
at least three factories in the north-
east suburbs have since been destroyed.
And in Gholon, where the worst of the
fighting has taken place, the street
scenes look like a French front-line
town in World War 11.
Most of the Cholon battles were
fought in a solidly built commercial
area about the size of the rectangle
between Circular Quay and Market
Street in Sydney. The Government
used 60mm. mortars and tanks, and
the Viet Cong on their side had some
106 mm. recoilless rifles. The extent
of the damage cannot be estimated yet,
but it must be very great. In one
building alone nearly $2 million worth
of imported textiles belonging to 100
Chinese merchants went up in.flames.
The number of Viet Cong guerillas
in Saigon has never been large. Even
at Tet, the Americans estimate a maxi-
mum of 4000 actually got within the
city limits. Since May 5 the South
Vietnamese' Army claims to have
killed some 3000 Viet Cong in the Gia
Dinh area. Probably no more than 300
guerillas were in Cholon at any
one time, and possibly more than
twice that number in Gia Dinh. Con-
ventional intelligence methods of cal-
culation are now complicated because
Viet Cong units are not only under-
strength but are organised in all sorts
of new combinations.
The Cholon and Gia Dinh fighters
are believed to have come in mostly
in groups of five or six, dressed as
peasants or workers and not carrying
heavy weapons. Their anti-aircraft
machine-guns and recoilless rifles must
have been brought in separately. The
soldiers here say that this sort of
infiltration can never be completely
checked; they expect the Viet Cong
to maintain it on a rotation basis from
their units around the capital.
The Viet Cong attacks have in-
directly brought about a major shuffle
of key military and police jobs in
Saigon. Because of the helicopter inci-
dent, there is a new Saigon police
chief, a new mayor, and a new corn-
mander of the capital’s military dis-
triot. If General Khang’s resignation is
accepted, there will also be a new
commander of 111 Corps area, in which
Saigon lies. General Loan, the national
police chief who was wounded in
early May, has also been replaced by
the commander of the Fifth Ranger
Group, Saigon’s main defence force.
Last Wednesday, General Loan’s
eminent ally, Vice-President Ky,
offered his resignation as chairman of
the central civil defence committee.
The political manoeuvrings behind all
this are tortuous. But the net result is
a formidable strengthening of President
Thieu’s personal power base at the
expense of Mr. Ky’s.


The other signs
WHILE THE Viet Cong are pushing
ahead with rocket attacks on Saigon,
there is at least one sign that the
Communists may be considering a
political solution to the war. This is
the appearance in South Vietnam two
months ago of an organisation called
the Alliance of National, Democratic,
and Peace Forces of Vietnam. The
alliance, which claims to be dedicated
to the pursuit of peace and a political
.settlement of the war, is undoubtedly
a Communist creation. But its nine-
man central committee consists of well-
known Saigon personalities only one of
whom is known to be a Communist.
About a hundred South Vietnamese
Intellectuals and businessmen, includ-
ing some very rich ones, are reported
to have joined the leaders in hiding
near the Cambodian border with the
National Liberation Front.
The Viet Cong have been anxious for
at least two years to set up such a
body, with wider appeal to the urban
middle classes than the NLF could ever
hope for. A Viet Cong document
captured last year declared, “The peace
and neutralist policy is proposed by our
Party for the south with the aim of
having more friends and less foes in
a very complex situation.” But, coming
at this particular time, the alliance
seems to have other possibilities than
just as a rallying point for anti-war
sentiment under discreet Communist
control. Above all, it could be used to
help get round the problem of what
part the NLF should play in a future,
peaceful South Vietnam.
So far the alliance has sounded re-
markably undemanding about the
future role of the NLF undemanding,
that is, by comparison with the long-
standing Communist claim that the
Front is “the sole genuine represen-
tative of the South Vietnamese people.”
In its first public statement, the
alliance merely said that the NLF “can-
not be absent in the settlement of any
problem in South Vietnam.” It may be
that the Communists are planning to
put forward the alliance as their com-
promise candidate for a place in a
postwar coalition government and keep
the controversial Front tucked away in
the background.
There are non-Communists in Saigon
who could be enticed to join the
alliance for two reasons: the more
Left-wing ones may believe that they
have no choice left but to work with
the Communists; others may feel that
peace is worth the risk. To both groups,
the alliance might seem to offer some-
what more chance of preserving their
independence than the NLF. The wide-
spread uncertainty caused by the Paris
peace talks and by the broad hints of
a revision of American policy in Viet-
nam could push people to make such
*a choice. In the case of the hundred
or so men in the jungle, it already has.
Our neighborhood
The new
Confrontation?
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Kuala Lumpur
A DRAMATIC and unexpected pre-
lude to the Five Power Conference in
Kuala Lumpur last week was the sudden
arrival of the Thai Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister in Penang on June 6
and Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku
Abdul Rahman’s journey there to meet
them.
While it is as certain as it is un-
provable that the Thai leaders used the
talks to add their pressure toward a
Malaysia-Singapore rapprochement that
could attract continued Anglo-Anzac
support on Thailand’s southern flank,
the ostensible reason was the “regional
situation.”
No doubt Vietnam occupied some
time, but the Philippines’ claim to
Sabah occupied more. Since, according
to the communique, the two Prime
Ministers discussed Malaysia-Philippines
differences “which have arisen as a
result of the Philippines claim to
Sabah,” the implication was that
Bangkok puts more of the blame on
Manila than on Kuala Lumpur. None-
theless, the Thai tone —Prime Minister
Thanom Kittikachorn expressed “deep
concern” while stressing that Thailand
would not want to be “directly
involved”—had a strongly neutral
flavor, as did Indonesian Foreign
Minister Adam Malik’s statement on the
issue later in the week and also some of
the Anglo-Anzac comments outside the
Five Power Conference.
Meanwhile the state of Malaysia-
Philippines relations continues to
deteriorate, making it appear prob-
lematical whether the “neutralists,”
both Asian and Anglo-Anzac, might
long be able to maintain their stance.
On the one hand there was abso-
lutely no sign on the horizon of any
way out of the impasse of the Sabah
claim. On the other the Manila Press
and politicians continued to work the
issue over in such a way as to make
reason and moderation distant pros-
pects.
“Nationalists” were reported as
urging President Marcos to prohibit
Foreign Secretary Ramos from indul-
ging in “love-talk regarding Malaysia”
largely Because Ramos evidently con-
sidered the propensity of Philippines
Foreign Ministry officials for firing off
fiery notes to Kuala Lumpur as
scarcely justified. The latest exchanges
have been over alleged but unproven
incursions into Filipino air and sea
space, which, since the aircraft were
unidentified and the ship was British,
would appear to bear out Ramos’ view-
point. Nonetheless, cries for beefing-up
Filipino military strength in order to
get Malaysia to take the Philippines
seriously are not uncommon and make
an ironic comment on Anglo-Anzac
talk of withdrawals being justified 'by
the regional situation.
“Under the circumstances,” suggests
one Manila magazine given Malay-
sian obduracy and Filipino pride
“it might be well for us to consider
a settlement along the West Irian for-
mula in 1959.” Indonesian Confronta-
tion then obtained Dutch aquiescence
in United Nations mediation, the
magazine argued, and “the formula put
Irian under supervision for five years,
after which a plebiscite was held to
determine the wishes of the inhabitants
on the island. Indonesia won.”
Quite apart from such a viewpoint
the hard fact is that in the largely
verbal world of Filipino politics argu-
ments such as these are not being dis-
missed as arrant nonsense. As one rare
iconoclastic Filipino columnist put it:
“The Philippines-Malaysia problem
may become larger than the figment
of the imagination of our leaders and
mass media, creating a more difficult
mess than necessary ... in the
Communications Minister Hurulle greets
Mr. Hasluck in Ceylon on Thursday
Philippines-Malaysia Confrontation a
more sober atmsophere should prevail,
for wars and dictators come on the
heels of hysteria.”
Maybe Australian External Affairs
Minister Hasluck’s presence in Manila
soon —.for a regional meeting of Aus-
tralia’s Ambassadors and High Com-
missioners -- could conceivably give
him diplomatic room for helping to
create a more sober atmosphere. None-
theless, the use of the West Irian
analogy reminds of an earlier Austra-
lian inability to choose the right time
to be neutral in regional disputes; as
well as an earlier failure over West
Irian to decide which Asian national-
isms it is in Australia’s self-interest to
support or oppose.


Headache cure
Gives long-lasting relief from nervous disorders caused by congestion of the
business communications system.
The best way to get rid of a headache is
to eliminate the underlying cause. The
STC Pentaconta Pushbutton PABX does
just that for businesses suffering from the
strains created by slow, outdated tele-
phony. Pentaconta. the most advanced
business telephone system there is, puts
automation to work in the office, elimi-
nating the bottlenecks that slower systems
produce. Pentaconta also simplifies
switchboard operation, makes a good
impression on people, and helps a busi-
ness achieve a new level of overall
operating efficiency.
Big claims ? But the STC Pentaconta is a
big step forward in telephony. If you are
accustomed to one of the older systems
you'll be surprised to discover what
advanced features are now available. For
example, in Pentaconta-equipped busi-
nesses it is no longer necessary to call the
operator to transfer a call to another
extension. An outside caller can, in fact,
arrange to be connected to a series of
extensions in sequence. His call will be
automatically re-directed to the operator
each time a conversation is terminated.
There are enough features to fill a book.
Ask us and we'll send you the book the
brochure on the Pentaconta, that is. The
Pentaconta comes in line capacities to
suit all businesses. Ask us to tell you more
about it and what it could do for you.

AUSTRALIA: HOW UNLIMITED?
BRIAN HOAD, an
Englishman now. living
here, speculates
on our future
SPECULATION and the study of the
future have become matters of respect-
able and fashionable scholarship, based
no longer on the abilities of enlightened
individuals but rather on the sustained
co-operation and systematic fact-gath-
ering of teams of devotees equipped
with the latest electronic aids. Predic-
tion has become no less difficult, and
no less unreliable, for human nature,
thank God, remains as devious as ever.
About the modern techniques there
is, too, a feeling of sterility which even
their practitioners will admit to when it
comes to suggesting that the impas-
sioned and gifted visions of a Wells or
an Orwell stand more chance of influ-
encing the future than they. At best
modern predictions provide grounds for
debate on what present policy decisions
may lead to. At worst they present a
kaleidoscope of ever - changing and
seldom-achieved figures on exports, or
incomes, or babies. While in between
there is the endless cycle of three-, four-,
or five-year plans undergoing premature
revision. Present-day politicians are
adept at admitting the false premises,
predictions, or projections of their
predecessors if not their own.
In modern speculation the present
Government in Canberra tends both
toward the worst excesses of numerical
prediction, and to old-fashioned evoca-
tions of “national destiny.” So that one
week Mr. McMahon will be heard to
scoff at the “forecasters and the sooth-
sayers who have generally tended to be
wrong” and the next he will be begging
the indulgence of 200 company directors
while he engages in what he calls a bit
of harmless crystal-gazing, and sees the
Australian economy expanding to 50
times its present size in 75 years. In a
similarly expansive mood on the fol-
lowing day in Washington, Mr. Gorton
was moved to remark that, “We are not
now a great people . . . though we are
destined to be.”
What is nice about all this is that
it invites a free-for-all; it does not
overbear and silence the nation as the
irreproachably based predictions
produced, say, at the Hudson Institute
of New York tend to do. To be faced
with such overwhelming distillations of
pure statistical fact, processed in
accordance with the latest techniques of
a rapidly developing science, to make
systematic conjectures about the future
is to be seized with a feeling of impo-
tence. Discussion, despite the modesty
of the predictors, is precluded.
But, in a world of crystal balls and
optimism and of pessimists, and
nihilists, too the future is common
ground to squabble over or to be forged
by those visionaries impassioned enough
and gifted enough to do so. At the
Hudson Institute there is no room for
vaguely formulated assumptions, tastes,
or values; there is no room either for
those flashes of human genius that have
regularly provided the progress of
history. The policy-makers of America
may have the advantage of a somewhat
less confused idea of what might happen,
but the extent of the advantage is the
extent also of the limitation they have
placed upon themselves.
No such inhibitions dog Australia’s
future. Export earnings from the much-
celebrated minerals boom, for example,
have been publicly forecast as anything
between $6OO million and $lOOO
million by 1972 (why 1972, anyway?)
a discrepancy which would appal
any inmate of the Hudson Institute
and make nonsense of any future
economic planning which had to take
such figures into consideration. Anyway,
the figure could be more or less, for all
anybody knows. Either way the limitless
optimism should take the credit or the
blame, and probably (probability being
one of the more reliable soothsaying
sciences) the blame; for bland, un-
seasoned optimism can be the deadliest
opiate of them all.
Why, for example, has next to no-
body queried the high hopes lavished
on the minerals boom other than to
boost the forecast of their export earn-
ings? What, apart from the export earn-
ings and the individual profiteering
on the stock markets, do the high
hopes involve? The U.S.S.R. has bigger
and better deposits of minerals, an
agricultural area of massive propor-
tions, and an ideologically conscious
population to exploit them. It has so
far achieved a standard of living and
a rate of economic growth far be-
hind that of, say, Switzerland, blessed
only with its granite peaks and native
ingenuity. There is more than histori-
cal factors involved in the difference,
which is, after all, that hardy perennial
of the economic primers thrown
up each year to show the uninitiated
how very little natural resources of
raw materials contribute to a country’s
level of economic prosperity. More
important are the qualities of the
human resources; the presence of a
basic economic objective be it
war, welfare, or whatever; the degree
to which social, political, and economic
factors in the state permit and en-
courage developments in technology,
industry, and agriculture; the method
of combining existing resources to
achieve their most efficient usage. Is
Australia so well off after all?
According to the Hewett-Lovering
prediction of the stages of mineral
production as advocated by the Uni-
versity of Washington, Australia, like
Zambia, Brazil, South Africa, and
Canada, is in a nebulous zone of mine
development. When mineral exports
start to decline, Australia is supposed
to pass through into the age of the
smelters. When the smelters fall in
number and increase in size, when
output of the mines starts to decline
and mineral imports are greater than
mineral exports, it is supposed to reach
its industrial area. But flashing on to the
year 2000 with the aid of a “scenario”
drawn up by the rival Hudson
Institute a different plot emerges:
Brazil and Zambia will still be lan-
guishing somewhere in the mining and
smelter regions; South Africa will be
in the full flush of industrial pros-
perity; Australia, the U.K., the
U.S.S.R., and a handful of European
countries will have passed over into
the ever-spiralling demands of the
world of mass consumers and waste-
makers; and the U.S., Japan, Canada,
and the Scandinavian countries will
have reached the never-never world of
a purely post-industrial economy with
too much pointless money jingling in
the pockets, too much heavy time on
the hands, a deficit of meaning in a
life super-saturated with material goods
the end of the road or a new
renaissance? The Hudson Institute
admits that its predictions are “some-
what optimistic.” Why argue? They
have discounted the possibility of
world war or world recession whether
through breakdown of the world
monetary system or an outbreak of
world peace. Who was able to pre-
dict several years ago the present
staggering student attack on Euro-
pean Government systems?
Australia has jumped the Hewett-
Lovering gun. Perhaps, despite the
much-predicted expansion of mineral
exports, it is already in the smelting
age. But there can nevertheless be no
argument that industrialisation in Aus-
tralia has still a long way to go; mineral
resources are the fuel, but not the
vehicle, for the journey.
For one thing, there is a lot of com-
petition. Sir Harold Raggatt warned
some time ago that the gaining of inde-
pendence by many new nations was
bound to lead to intensive exploration


for minerals, and that not only would
significant discoveries be made but that
strenuous efforts would be made to
develop them. This process is now well
under way. “Many of the countries in
which discoveries have been made are
much less developed than Australia and
therefore even less able to make use of
their resources than we are,” Raggatt
now says. “Though their long-term ob-
jectives—processing at home —are no
doubt similar to ours, they have such a
desperate need for capital that they are,
at this stage, much more willing to
export raw materials than we are. Aus-
tralia is selling its minerals in a market
which is already highly competitive.”
Another reason for caution is the fact
that some sectors of the world’s mineral
trade are controlled by relatively few
companies. This means that there is
either no free world market or that
there is a more ready trade for ores
and concentrates rather than for metals
aluminium is one good example
while for the potentially very rich
deposits of “rare earths” metals there
is no outlet whatsoever, either at home
or abroad. The only breakthrough into
these very competitive and restrictive
areas of trade is by selling them at very
low prices or by going into partnerships
with large overseas companies. Raggatt
is adamant that, unlike other new
nations, Australia should not sell at any
price: “We must be tough but realistic,
keeping firmly in mind that our objec-
tive is processing and fabrication in
Australia to the maximum extent
reasonably practicable. In some cases
we can reasonably expect a buyer to
purchase a processed product; in others,
by good timing in making administra-
tive decisions, measures can be taken to
encourage or, if necessary, force pro-
cessing in Australia.”
Easier said than done. Foreign com-
panies are not investing in Australian
minerals as a favor. They are in-
terested in making a profit and in
obtaining raw materials to feed their
manufacturing industries at home. It
would be easier, however, if the Fed-
eral Government gave some indication
through selective industrial planning
that it has as clear a view of what is
needed as Sir Harold Raggatt. It
hasn’t given any such indication. In
place of planning there appears to be
an ad hoc muddle of regulations. And
although planning involves regulations,
certainly, it uses them as tools to some
clearly defined purposes.
What clearly defined purposes have
there been in the Federal regulations
which have centred on the protec-
tion and cultivation of “infant” indus-
try for more years than Australians
now care to remember? The argu-
ments on this subject have grown tired
and frail as some of the industries
they have sought to protect but which,
in all that time, have failed to grow
up. The preservation of such patently
inefficient industries has shown up
time and again in the retrograde
effects which result in the economy
at large: the more efficient indus-
tries tend to become less so, costwise,
in the international marketplace; and,
even more importantly, the precious
and limited supplies of capital and
manpower are inefficiently employed.
There is a curious Government boast
that industry has become highly
diversified since World War II; dis-
sipated might be a better word. For
there seems to be no ranking of invest-
ment priorities on the basis of their
contribution to economic growth. The
Government’s infamous tariff policies
would seem to be aimed at protecting
industry because it is there rather
than forcing funds into those industries
where Australia’s much applauded nat-
ural resources would give an advan-
tage in international trade.
There is hope. The Tariff Board,
under the chairmanship of Mr. Rat-
tigan, has itself been dusting the
archives. Mr. Rattigan, in the face of
much Government controversy and
opposition, has been re-examining ideas
of what constitutes an economic in-
dustry a delicate point, that and
he and his Board have suggested a wide-
ranging review of all industrial protec-
tion, and the classification of industry
into high, low, and medium protective
categories. He has made the equally
fresh approach of taking into consider-
ation “other unsatisfactory features” of
Australian production when recom-
mending for or against protection. So,
in the case of the chemical lactose, the
plant was regarded as “old and un-
satisfactory”; in the case of dental
chairs “the range of goods produced
was not satisfactory”; and in the case of
bathing caps “there was little prospect
of supplying a reasonable proportion of
the Australian market.” Despite the
controversies and much lamenting even
Trade Minister McEwen may have been
shoved away from his fiercely aggres-
sive protectionism into a vague middle-
of-the-way limbo of “reasonable compe-
tition from overseas” and “frameworks
of private enterprise and profit.” Mr.
Rattigan was appointed to another five-
year session in the Board’s chair earlier
this year, and long may his good works
in casting industrial anachronisms to the
lions of free trade prosper.
The results of Canberra’s muddled
approach to economic planning have
been lurking in the statistics for years
in the form of figures which seem
to reflect a comparative weakness in the
economic growth rate and the rate of
growth in living standards. Whether for
reasons of muddle-headedness, patho-
logical optimism, or political humbug,
there have been few clear and concise
discussions of this in Australia. When
the United Nations’ Year Book of
National Accounts Statistics came out
last year, there was a bit of a fuss when
the Year Book showed that the growth
rate of the economy in real terms per
head of population between 1950 and
1960 was 1.5 percent for Australia,
2.4 percent for the U.K., and 4.7 per-
cent for the Common Market countries
on average. For the period 1960-64 the
figures were 2.6 percent, 2.6 percent,
and 4.1 percent respectively. Australians
are proud of having one of the highest
living standards in the world, but the
UN reports that in the increase in
consumption expenditure per head for
1960-64 Australia was only 1.7 percent
per year, while the U.K. was 2.3 per-
cent and Common Market countries
4.8 percent.
There are other indications that the
journey to and through industrialisation
will not follow the optimistic schedule
drawn up by the Hudson Institute.
There is the problem of human
resources, the outflow of entre-
preneurial, technological, and (signifi-
cant in economic terms, too) artistic
talent. Professor Peter Jones, of the
University of New South Wales, re-
cently wrote to the Press to explain
his imminent departure for the U.S.
After completing a Doctorate in Aero-
nautical Engineering eight years ago,
he left for England “because of the
lack of an aircraft industry here.” He is
leaving again “because of the lack of a
computer design and manufacturing
group in Australia.” There are many
thousands like him who, perhaps im-
patiently, have already left. Some of
them might have been more patient if
the community at large had shown a
little more activity in supporting and
encouraging efforts to create new and
exciting manufacturing and research
enterprises. It is mostly among those
young people who want to create rather
than just follow that the outflow occurs.
This is the measure of Australia’s loss.
There is, too, the potential mana-

gerial talent (surely one of the essential
keys to the future of successful indus-
trialisation) that is wasted in Australia
when faced not only with inadequate
management-training facilities (two out
of three applicants have to be turned
away) but with the antiquated attitudes
of so many prospective employers.
More of this is likely to be siphoned
off to the U.S. There are the teachers
who pack their bags for the greater
attractions of Canada. Until recently
there was the interesting case of the
pharmacists drawn irresistibly toward
the limitless funds of the U.K.’s
National Health Service. That particu-
lar outflow, at least, has now been
plugged. Australian pharmacists regis-
tered after March 31 this year are not
to be allowed to practise in the U.K.
until their standards are raised.
Back at the UN it was being pointed
out that the proportion of the Austra-
lian Gross National Product spent on
education is only one-third of that
spent in the U.K.; Australian expendi-
ture per student is only half that in
the U.K. There is not only a shortage
of skilled labor, there is a demand for
greater skills. It may be easier to
obtain a higher education in Australia
than in Europe, but it is probably not
such a high education when you get it.
Yet to skimp on education is, at most,
a step forward from despising it. To
recognise it as the only base upon which
a sound economic and political future
in the modern world may be built is
to begin to appreciate the Wellsian
prophecy that human history shall be-
come more and more a race between
education and catastrophe.
Preparing to strain the none-too-
healthy education system is the Minister
for Immigration, Mr. Snedden, who,
cheered by a sudden halt (after six
years) in the fall of the birthrate, is
planning by the year 2000 to have
300,000 immigrants a year flooding into
a country which will be carrying a
population of between 20 and 28 mil-
lion. It is Mr. Snedden’s job to count
heads, not to educate them. And yet
there is a popular, and again optimistic,
belief that despite the tireless pursuit
of quantity in Australian immigration
policy the quality will also come.
As things now stand there is no evi-
dence to substantiate such hopes.
Economic growth and rising living
standards in Europe are reducing Aus-
tralia’s attraction to one of climate.
There are, too, restrictive practices at
work within the Australian professions
that control the admittance of im-
migrants on grounds other than that
of professional excellence. Australia
has also gained a reputation abroad for
having preserved the old-English tradi-
tion of a rigidly immobile super-
structure built into the labor force,
while Australia’s own brains, drained
off to the U.K. and elsewhere, can
hardly be expected to represent ambas-
sadors of goodwill.
While Mr. Snedden talks of a trend
away from the Anglo-Saxons he is
setting his sights on the poorer areas
to the east and the south, looking to
Sicily, Greece, and now Turkey, while
the pontifications on the admittance of
more Asians—ostensibly for cultural
and political reasons also contain
purely economic factors. If education
was not still a matter of some indif-
ference to the Australian community,
and if the slant of eyes or the pig-
mentation of skins had become a matter
of no consequence, there would be
effective support for the suggestion,
already often enough made, that highly
educated, English-speaking Asian immi-
grants could make contributions to Aus-
tralia different from those of Sicilian,
Greek, or Turkish peasants.
But when they speak of population,
Australians look at the future through
very narrow sights. They ignore the
way psycho-biologists and neuro-
physiologists are working for a future
that—no matter how potentially dan-
gerous or frightful it might seem today
—may have more certainty of material-
ising than Mr. Snedden’s 300,000
immigrants. On the subject of growing
the human foetus under laboratory
conditions it is both easy and dangerous
to be facetious. Nonetheless, Professor
D. O. White, of Melbourne University,
gives due warning that by the year
2000 it will almost certainly be a
possibility. Already the experiments
are taking the fertilised ova of animals
and growing them in organ cultures.
For the moment things are somewhat
haywire and the ovas are producing
weak monstrosities which soon die.
But in due course factories where
humans are bred and, through gene
manipulation, endowed with whatever
characteristics shall be deemed politic-
ally or economically necessary may
have to be considered as seriously as
immigration programs.
You cannot stop a man exploring a
field of knowledge once he has become
engrossed in it. But as there should be
a conscious effort to channel resources
of capital and manpower into the most
economically viable industries, there,
too, should follow the even rarer re-
sources of research and development,
for in the world’s markets it is techno-
logical innovation and not price which
is rapidly 'becoming the prime factor
of economic competition.
There is little enough Australian
money spent in this field as it is
somewhere between 0.6 percent and 1
percent of the Gross National Product,

compared with 1.8 percent in Japan,
2.5 percent in the U.K., and about 3
percent in the U.S. and of that
only a small fraction (in the region of
one-fifth) finds its way into industrial
research. Australia has relied for too
long on a policy of begging, borrowing,
or stealing its technical know-how and
innovation which, in the practical
sense, is quite unproblematical so far
as the home market is concerned, but
presents the difficulties of limitations
and fat royalties when it comes to the
exports. Perhaps Australia should have
observed more closely the reaction of
Europe when faced with the supposed
choice between adapting to the techno-
logical reality of the day and the risk
of becoming economically and politi-
cally subjugated to scientific super-
powers; industrial helotry, as Mr. Wil-
son put it; or to paraphrase a U.S.
official to his French counterpart some
years ago: “Look, you Australians do
what you’re good at; and we’ll do what
we’re good at. You stick to wool and
mutton and leave the high-performance
aircraft and the computers to us.” And
how the French nuclear tests exploded
in protest at that, and how nearly was
the dollar brought down!
And in a way it is a pity that Aus-
tralia has so soon forgotten the sudden
seeming switch of U.S. attitudes in
Asia as it happily settles down again
under that omnipotent umbrella. The
horrible spectre of “going it alone” is
receding from the public conscience;
gone, too, is the chance of stirring the
essential slothfulness of an essentially
Anglo-Saxon people with the backs-to-
the - wall - we - shall - never - surrender
stimuli to which they best respond.
Defence would have been a good,
basic, economic objective at last, des-
pite the dilemma that Mr. Gorton
seemed to be squirming on at the time.
But there was no dilemma. There is no
difference between investing in national
development and investing in defence,
when development is the development
of metals and oil, when war is not a
matter solely of guns and gunpowder
but of roads and railways and rolling
stock, of machine tools and electronics,
and a thousand-and-one other products
of high-technology.
It could well be that the point was
taken after all, that the recent award
of a $600,000 Government contract for
the development of the local production
of micro-electronic devices for defence
purposes is only the beginning of a new
and useful policy on defence procure-
ment orders. But that is only prediction.
Since Eve ate the apple the common
ground for all prediction has always
been the common need for a better and
happier state than the present. And
yet in the philosophical pursuit of hap-
piness there occurs one of those con-
volutions of logic which demands the
pursuit and acceptance of unhappiness
when scrutinising the future—the worst
that could happen does so as infre-
quently as the best, and in-between-
times are a matter of delightful sur-
prises rather than disappointments.

Gorton in Asia:
uphill all the way
FROM BOB BAUDINO, WHO TRAVELLED WITH THE PRIME MINISTER
WHEN MR. GORTON went to South-
East Asia two weeks ago a confusion of
ad hoc theories on what was best for
Asians and for Australians went with
him. He has returned a wiser and (to
extend the cliche) a somewhat sadder
man because he now acknowledges
that, despite his dreams of an Austra-
lian utopia, South-East Asia will always
influence Australia’s future and Aus-
tralia must always honor its obliga-
tions to ensure that the future is the best
available.
Except for a two-day fact-finding
side trip to Bali, Mr. Gorton’s trek
through Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia,
and Indonesia was uphill. When some-
one is new to a job the going is always
harder. But a man “furthering” (Gor-
ton’s own term) the achievements of his
predecessor has double trouble, especi-
ally if he lacks the qualities of the per-
son he has replaced. The Prime Minis-
ter showed none of the ease and con-
fidence which Harold Holt exuded on
his travels. He stopped smiling at Dar-
win and did not look cheerful again,
in public at least, until he emerged
from talks with Singapore’s Prime Min-
ister, Lee Kuan Yew, four days later.
Mr. Gorton is no diplomat. His
background has not equipped him to
deal with other peoples’ uncertainties.
One of the few things he had in com-
mon with his hosts was his flair for
always being late. He found his first
few days uncomfortable, except for
his visits to Australian forces in Viet-
nam, which gave him the chance to
escape like a boy playing truant to a
swimming hole, and all of it in the
Gorton idea of comfort—jungle greens,
shirt flapping open to the waist, no
ceremony.
His constitution suffered. His
physician, Dr. Marcus Faunce, had an
anxious period three days out when
Gorton went to bed with a stomach
upset. However, despite enthusiastic
predictions from sections of the Press
party, Mr. Gorton emerged next morn-
ing to set the pace, through the Army
Task Force at Nui Dat, then the RAAF
Logistic Unit at Vung Tau, and he set
the pace so strenuously that Press
numbers were reduced from 16 to four
by the end of day. Whatever short-
comings the Prime Minister may have,
no one can match him when it comes
to physical determination to see a job
through.
Although the Vietnam saga must, in
the circumstances prevailing, dominate
memories of the visit, retrospectively it
becomes clear that Mr. Gorton placed
as great, if not more, personal impor-
tance on his meeting with Lee Kuan
Yew. There are signs that he may have
feared the outcome of the meeting, for
Singapore’s Lee, respected for what he
is doing in his trouble-plagued city
nation, does not mince words or suffer
platitudes. Their 90-minute talks suc-
ceeded without qualification. Mr. Gor-
ton came out smiling. His phrase for it
was “We meshed.” Later reports sug-
gested that Mr. Gorton’s submissions on
what he saw as the future of South-
East Asia and how best the desired
future could be achieved agreed in prin-
ciple with those of Lee Kuan Yew.
What did surprise those with the
Prime Minister was that although local
Press coverage of the visit was not large,
so many people in the street, like taxi
drivers and shop assistants, knew who
John Gorton was, and, in many in-
stances, were familiar with his back-
ground.
The Vietnam visit, first on the list,
started with a curtain-raiser that would
have made Hitchcock envious. As Mr.
Gorton spoke on a raised platform at
Tan Son Nhut airport amidst hun-
dreds of aircraft of all shapes and sizes,
someone was copping hell from seven
helicopter gunships in the background.
“I see this visit as reaffirming Austra-
lia’s support for a free Vietnam,” he
said after being met by the Prime
Minister, Tran Van Huong. He spent
the rest of his day in Saigon repeating
assurances to the South Vietnamese
leaders that Australia would not with-
draw or decrease its forces until the
aims of the 1966 Manila Conference
had been reached.
Mr. Gorton scored a special point
on his Saigon visit, as the official com-
munique later confirmed. He has never
forgiven the American Administration
for the manner in which it went ahead
with the suspension of bombing in
North Vietnam without any prior con-
sultation with the Australian Govern-
ment, although consultation had been
promised. The communique released
on Mr. Gorton’s departure from Viet-
nam on June 9, referring to peace
talks, proclaimed that “they” (Presi-
dent Thieu and Mr. Gorton) had re-
asserted their position that the Republic
of Vietnam should be a full participant
and play a major role in any negotia-
tions. The Prime Minister and the
leaders of the republic agreed that the
“allied nations which had helped to de-
fend the Republic of Vietnam should
Mr. Gorton is met at Kuala Lumpur airport by the Malay-
sian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman
With Singapore Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, on his left,
the Prune Minister speaks at a State banquet in Singapore


participate in any final settlement of the
conflict.” Mr. Gorton has thus taken
out insurance against future American
impetuosity.
Whatever his motives (and one sus-
pects that they might simply be to try
to give some comfort to the 4750 men
who live with the alternating red dust
and mud of Nui Dat), it was in this
all-Australian piece of real estate
(where local Vietnamese are banned)
that he delivered the most forthright
speech of his tour. Standing under
rubber trees, regimentally undressed to
his waist in jungle greens and sur-
rounded by Australian troops, he
launched a two-pronged attack on
“nuts” who waved placards and sat on
roadways, and, surprisingly, on the
Paris preliminary peace talks. “For
every nut there are 100 Australians
behind you,” he said. “Please believe
your Government is behind you and 90
percent of the Australian people.” On
the Paris talks: “You would have heard
talk of things which are called peace
talks in Paris. They are not peace talks
—they are preliminary talks to see
whether there is any basis for a chance
to have talks later.” Then he went on
to add: “It has been quite impossible
(at Paris) to persuade North Viet-
namese negotiators to admit there are
any North Vietnamese troops in South
Vietnam. I dare say you would be able
to correct them on that. That is the
stage it has reached so far and I
would not build too many hopes too
quickly. The hopes are to complete
the job, finish the job, and give the
South Vietnamese people a chance to
elect their own Government and to
demonstrate that aggression by force
does not pay.”
Mr. Gorton’s performance in Vietnam
delighted the South Vietnamese Gov-
ernment. His hawkish statements left,
them in little doubt that Australia
would stand firm on its commitment.
The Gorton “Fortress Australia” theory,
with a fire-brigade unit for South-East
Asian trouble spots, is a very remote
possibility now if Mr. Gorton’s Viet-
nam utterances are to be given
credence. Of course, the Prime Minister
has been known in the past to say things
which had a different meaning for him
than for the rest of the world. But to
observers Mr. Gorton changed
dramatically in the clammy and tense
atmosphere of Vietnam. There is no
doubt the hawks in Cabinet are on
top at present.
Despite the success of the South
Vietnam visit, Mr. Gorton managed to
upset the world Press by indulging in
the costly luxury of losing his temper
at the major departure Press conference
at Tan Son Nhut airport. Australian
journalist Pat Burgess, who has been
stomping around Vietnam for some
months, almost unseated himself from
the conference by asking Mr. Gorton
how he could say Australian troops
were making “military progress” when
casualties were higher and they were
fighting forces better equipped and
better entrenched. Mr. Gorton and in
fairness it must be emphasised that he
was correct in doing so angrily
denied he had used the term military
progress during the conference and
went into a long statement defending
the morale of the Australian troops.
As the Vietnamese interpreter did his
job, Mr. Gorton seemed to get angrier,
and, when his Press secretary, Tony
Eggleton, closed the conference, leant
forward and slammed into Burgess for
impugning the Australian troops. This
outburst seemed to be a safety valve for
Mr. Gorton obviously upset and
temperamental all day. By the next day,
in Singapore, he was smiling and happy.
The Singapore-Malaysia visits were
overshadowed by the Five-Power Con-
ference in Kuala Lumpur, but Singa-
poreans were amazed and delighted by
the spontaneous genuine affection
between their Prime Minister and Aus-
tralia’s. Mr. Lee, the ablest leader in
South-East Asia, raised eyebrows by
extending the talks 30 minutes after
throwing all officials out. He later told
an official luncheon that he and Mr.
Gorton had no time to waste on the
demands of diplomacy and their talks
had been “frank, almost brutal.”
This meeting has ensured future
personal contacts between the two
leaders, as both of them continually
emphasised in later speeches. Mr. Lee
Press conference in Kuala Lumpur
With the President of Indonesia,
General Suharto, at Djakarta air-
port
was right behind Mr. Gorton on the
encouragement of non-military regional
co-operation. These talks alone almost
certainly ensured that Australia in
future will lift economic and technical
aid to South-East Asia, whatever it
does about defence. Mr. Lee stressed,
and Mr. Gorton accepted, the view
(later endorsed by Malaysia’s Prime
Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman) that
all must concentrate on raising standards
of living in South-East Asia on the
basis that contented people are peaceful.

from last week’s Five-Power Conference
of Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, Aus-
tralia, and New Zealand hit Kuala
Lumpur at the same time. Although Mr.
Gorton received all the diplomatic nice-
ties, news about him was buried.
Immediately on arrival he went into
conference with the Australian repre-
sentatives at the conference, Mr. Fair-
hall and Mr. Hasluck. He was delighted
with the result —Australia’s determina-
tion to do something had won praise,
while at the same time its limitations
were recognised and acknowledged.
New Zealand, on the other hand, which
said nothing noteworthy and remained
mute when it came to the time to start
producing promises, received almost
universal condemnation.
Mr. Gorton later recouped on pub-
licity in Malaysia and enjoyed almost
the entire front page (shared with his
wife, who spoke to the influential
National Council of Women). But, as
one Australian official observed, he did
not earn it. His talks in Kuala Lumour
went smoothly, but his sense of public
relations was poor. He turned down a
suggestion that he should sign the $l4
million Australian aid scheme to build
a Sabah Road, leaving it to the High
Commissioner. He also turned down a
chance to see the million dollars’ worth
of X-ray equipment Australia has given
to Malaysia. He sent his wife instead.
And he again ended a major Press con-
ference so abruptly that the Malaysian
journalist who was delegated to thank
him for speaking was left with his
mouth open.
Gorton Press conferences are disaster
areas. He held them, but for what he
said at them he might as well not have
bothered. At all of them, caught with
curly questions, he resorted to the last
ditches of platitude. In Singapore Asian
journalists were instructed that Asia
was a continent with many different
races and creeds. In Kuala Lumpur
they were told, “I suppose if one had
tried in 1942 to sit down and formulate
what threats might have been posed
for this part of the world, one could
have easily overlooked the possibility of
the emergency and confrontation.”
Asked about his visit to Vietnam and
the situation as he found it there, Mr.
Gorton replied, “The situation clearly
is that fighting is continuing. It is
perfectly evident that the . . . that it is
continuing. I don’t think I would want
to go any more deeply into an analysis
of the situation in Vietnam than that.”

Our Bill takes over from Our Henry
By DENIS O'BRIEN
AUSTRALIA now contains so many
local festivals and carnivals that it is
possible for the hedonist (or the
masochist) to carouse from one to the
other across the nation without once
surfacing to reality and without fully
covering more than a quarter of them
in any one year. Excluding agricultural
shows, picnic race weeks, and com-
mercial trade fairs, Australia’s calendar
of community revelry and civic chest-
beating includes at least 250 annual
excuses for the town bunting to be aired
and the town band to play at the
head of a main-street procession of
floats, marching girls, the local fire
engine, and a piece of Army hardware.
New South Wales alone accommo-
dates an average of 60 festivals and
carnivals a year, the bulk of them
budding with spring during October,
but enough of them to keep the
bacchant busy from January (“Miss
Wagga Wagga Festival,” “Moruya
Mardi Gras Carnival”) through May
(“Yamba Fishing Carnival” and
“Singleton Floral Festival”) to Decem-
ber (“Batemans Bay Mardi Gras Car-
nival”). There are festivals in praise
of Fisher’s Ghost, snow, wool, and
mountain gums; carnivals to honor
oysters, wood-chopping, bananas, and a
variety of flowering trees and shrubs.
It all suggests a round of spontaneous
peasant celebration and thanksgiving in
the old English tradition; in fact, it
represents a calculated effort to raise
money, attract tourists, and -express
community pride and individuality. The
total effort makes up a sort of Aus-
tralian sub-culture in which each local
community is virtually lashed into
enthusiasm for civic idealism by a small
group of voluntary organisers, whose
price is often an almost blind loyalty
to their cause.
Few of the country or provincial
festivals ever get the national attention
suggested by the hyperbole of home-
town newspapers (“Visitors from all
over Australia are expected for this
year’s Gumnut Festival”) or in the
opening speeches by exuberant local
Members (“The Prime Minister has
asked me to apologise for his inability
to be among you on this festive and
joyous occasion”), although a little of
their proliferating growth was widely
broadcast in the days when Russ Tyson
ran the ABC Breakfast Session and
Hospital Hour and often seemed to be
toting his microphone from one carnival
of flowers to the next. It is part of the
organisational zeal for such affairs to
imagine that Ourtown is a cynosure
because of its Rhododendron Week;
simple, worthy pride is apt to grow to
undisciplined proportions. Most small
festivals and carnivals do a good enough
job for their own communities and
districts without needing the approba-
tion of the rest of Australia: from funds
raised, swimming-baths and child-care
centres are built, local arts and crafts
are encouraged, localities acquire a
certain individual identification. For
many small festivals, though, it is not
enough they seem to have an urgent
desire to express their local enthusiasm
in terms of national ambition and
importance.
A topical example is Grenfell’s
“Henry Lawson Festival of Arts,”
which is an almost superbly arrogant
case of the seven-league-boots syndrome.
Grenfell holds its festival during the
Queen’s Birthday holiday long weekend
in June, and this year’s festival was the
eleventh. An introductory note to the
official program concluded with this
paragraph:
“This festival, we feel, has tapped a
chord of vitality in the hearts and
minds of all thinking Australians . . .
that our main work in building the
nation has but begun for us all as the
present occupants of this Great South
Land.”
It is a sad fact more than a jibe that
a large number of thinking Australians
can’t even geographically locate Gren-
fell, and that despite its 11 years of life
the “Henry Lawson Festival of Arts”
is not listed among the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Tourist Bureau’s calendar of
festivals and carnivals, whereas
Mudgee’s “Henry Lawson Floral
Festival” rests comfortably under “Sep-
tember.”
The Grenfell festival’s claim to Aus-
tralian hearts and minds presumably
is staked on its worthwhile promotion
of the arts as a basis for its festivities
instead simply of some local accident
of nature or piece of environmental
charm. Even though its relationship
with Henry Lawson is tenuous (his
family moved him to Mudgee soon
after his birth on the Grenfell goldfield
in 1867), the festival is one of the few,
if not the only, of its kind annually to
attempt to enrich the memory of a
creative Australian by singling out con-
temporary creativity for modest en-
couragement. For a rural centre which
supports a town and district population
of not many more than 5000, the
thought is noble, even if the deed is
curiously confused.
Principal function of the festival is
to recognise Australian artistic endeavor
during the preceding year. There are
awards for the major contribution to
the arts, for prose, verse, an Australian
song, and an Australian television pro-
gram. With such high ideals, it comes
as a surprise to find the festival dimin-
ishing its own endeavor by submerging
it in artless trappings. Lawson himself
might have felt at home among the
roughcut informality of the festival’s
official occasions, but it is difficult to
reconcile the careless amateurism of the
Lawson Concert (at which the awards
were made) with the dignity and
prestige inherent in the purpose of it
all.
“And now, ladies and gentlemen,”
says the Sydney radio announcer
specially imported for the night, and
looking oddly appropriate in his 1930 s
smile among the glass vases of flowers
and upright piano on the stage of Gren-
fell’s draughty Oddfellows’ Hall, “and
now, put your hands together to greet
Miss Mumble, who will sing a bracket
of songs.” A young amateur soprano
actually sang “Love’s Old Sweet Song”
at this year’s concert; a 16st., bald-
headed farmer whistled selections from
“The Sound of Music,” closing his eyes
with the effort and opening them
occasionally as if to assure himself that
we were all still there; the last half hour
of the concert was an uninhibited, un-
organised folksong sing-song by some
of the performers and assorted officials,
and among whom Brendan Behan, in
his livelier moments, wouldn’t have been
out of place.
I felt momentarily sorry for Ted
Roberts, of Sydney, when he climbed
up among the cut glass to accept the
Song award for the ditty “My Pal
Skippy,” which he and Eric Jupp had
written: the song had just been given
a relatively tuneless performance by a
local amateur and the purpose of the
prize seemed doubtful. And during an
apologetic tenor’s singing of something
from “Carousel” it was difficult not to
think how Russell Drysdale, Sidney
Nolan, Sir William Dobell, Douglas
Stewart, A. D. Hope, Patrick White,
and Sir Robert Helpmann would have
felt in the same hall. All of them are
past winners of the major arts award.
Not all of them were able to attend
to accept it—as neither was Thomas
Keneally this year—but the award vir-
tually beseeches attendance, and atten-
dance must surely require a high toler-
ance of amateurism.
No one wants to embalm the arts or
their practitioners in stuffy formality;
neither is it suggested that the author
of “Voss” or the painter of “The
Cricketers” doesn’t occasionally enjoy
relaxing his standards and taking off
his boots as much as most of us.
But it hardly seems appropriate to en-
courage distinguished professionalism
with one gesture and diminish it with
another, no matter where the heart is.
Grenfell seems uncertain how to sus-
tain the high ideals of its festival. It
suffers a common complaint in its
treasury (although it did get a $5OO
subsidy this year from the N.S.W. Cul-
tural Grants Committee), it has to cater
both for its local population and its
sense of national prestige, and its plan-
ning and organisation are handled by a
small group of civic-minded volunteers
who aren’t always certain either of
local support or wider interest,
This year the festival seemed con-
sciously in search of something more
than Henry Lawson to revive the spirit,
There was reliable talk in town that
Rolf Harris had been proposed as the
winner of the major arts award (Rolf
Harris? For arts?) on the assumption
that his visit as a recipient would bring
in the crowds in droves. Whether or
not the talk was unfounded or the pro-
posal fell through, the award went, to
Mr. Keneally, and the star attraction
was Bill Peach, who opened the festi-
val, attended with his executive pro-
ducer, Allan Martin, to receive the TV
award for “This Day Tonight,” and was
paraded through festival functions like
minor royalty. Mr. Peach made quite
an impact. He was often surrounded
by adult and juvenile autograph
hunters, was represented in one of the
processional floats, sang in the concert,
drove a cautious circuit of the go-kart
track, and was sought out and had his
hand pumped by 647 friendly strangers,
Not only did his fans wear “I Like
Bill” buttons, a costumed group of them
chanted it in front of the Lawson Park
grandstand before he opened the fes-
tival.
It’s fan to say that Our Bill per-
formed with admirable charm and
commendable courtesy, but there were
times when one wondered what on earth
any of it had to do with Our Henry.
It’s also essential to note that Gren-
fell’s hospitality is rich and powerful.
I was felled by it after an eventful
evening at something wild called the
“Roaring Days Ball” and survived to
enjoy it gently through a weekend of
social and official occasions. Unfor-
tunately, anyone less privileged would
have felt deprived of the meaning of
the festival.
Several improvements suggest them-
selves. Although it is Grenfell’s right
to honor the greats in the arts, it seems
rather pointless to confirm the obvious;
much better, surely, to endow some
promising youngster who at least could
be seen to grow on Grenfell’s
encouragement. Writers are almost
pathetically grateful for any formal
recognition, but I’m afraid a Grenfell
statuette alone is not enough to attract
high-quality verse and short stories;
an annually alternated prize, even if
only in pen nibs, could enhance the
overall value. The art show, held con-
currently with the festival, displays
considerable growth potential and could
usefully take over the statuette alloca-
ted for an Australian song; on this
year’s evidence Australian amateur
painting deserves much more attention
than Australian professional song-
writing.
And something will have to be done
about the gumleaf quality of the
award-giving concert and its stage in
the Oddfellows’ Hall. Preserve the hall
as a Lawson museum and hire the local
cinema for the night, or scrap the
concert altogether and hand out the
awards at a dinner in one of the local
pubs. Do anything . . . but do some-
thing before Sir Robert Helpmann wins
the major award again: the Odd-
fellows’ Hall doesn’t even have a hook
for his fur coat.

Appointment in Kuala Lumpur
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Kuala Lumpur
External Affairs Minister Hasluck and Defence Minister Fairhall (centre) at the opening of the talks
THERE WAS Defence Secretary
Healey smilingly sighing on Monday
“only 36 hours to go,” but late on Tues-
day handling his Press conference with
skilled professionalism and command of
his brief ... in marked contrast and
just to remind that the Brits were still
the heavyweights, there was Mr. Holy-
oake who gave no formal Press con-
ference and Mr. Gorton who appeared
at his to have neither professionalism
nor brief (he managed to use the word
“Malaya” four or five times when
meaning “Malaysia”) . . . there was
Singapore’s Dr. Goh Keng Swee,
animated and humorously cynical, re-
sponding to a query on regional defence
with “Of course, it would be wonderful
if we could all start loving each other”
. . . there was Malaysia’s Tun Razak
as undemonstrative and as restrained as
ever, refusing countless opportunities at
his Press conference to demonstrate
something more than a lukewarm re-
sponse . . .
Close up, an international conference
such as the Five Power Commonwealth
Defence Conference held here last week
dissolves into impressions such as these.
Best of all for my money is the memory
of one Australian journalist reflectively
ruminating at the end of it all: “What
I want to know is what are we giving?
The Malaysians and Singaporeans have
promised to spend more and work
harder at co-operation and the Brits
have promised to give millions of
pounds’ worth away and to hold a
bloody great exercise. We’re keeping
the Mirages at „JJutterworth. because
there’s nowhere to put them in Austra-
lia, but what are we giving? What are
we promising?”
His remarks reflect a widely held
view of the conference’s work pro-
ductive but, as expected, not con-
clusive. The British left nearly everyone
feeling that they had been more forth-
coming than expected and Malaysian-
Singapore co-operation, essential pre-
requisite to further planning, was firmly
established. Australia and New Zealand
demonstrated political interest, but
scarcely commitment. In the words of
the communique, “the Australian and
New Zealand delegations observed that
their Governments would take into
account the proceedings of the confer-
ence in formulating their longer-term
defence policies and in deciding what
part their forces would play in the col-
lective defence and combined training
arrangements which the conference had
discussed. Meanwhile, they would main-
tain forces in the area and continue to
assist the Governments of Malaysia and
Singapore in the development of their
forces by means of assistance in training
personnel and defence aid.”
It now seems certain that Terendak
Camp will close once the British com-
ponent of the Commonwealth Brigade
at Malacca is withdrawn next year;
since Mr. Gorton, according to the
Tunku, pledged that Australia’s future
was tied up with the region, the com-
munique scarcely forecloses any option.
Australia and New Zealand are, after
all, “in the area.”
This extract was, however* one of
the less meaningful parts of a sur-
prisingly substantial communique, itself
underlining that this and future con-
ferences can be useful for, what Mr.
Healey termed, “concentrated decision-
taking.” Chief among decisions taken
or recorded on this occasion were:
• Malaysia and Singapore not only
reiterated that their defence was in-
divisible and that they would “do their
utmost” to sustain continuing close
co-operation, but also agreed to work
for “an effective joint-defence system,”
progress toward which was particularly
registered in relation to joint air de-
fence.
• To sustain such air defence the Aus-
tralian Air Force will remain at Butter-
worth “with elements deployed to
Tengah” at least until the end of 1971.
• Singapore accepted the ultimate re-
sponsibility for maintaining Tengah Air
Base in Singapore as the southern pivot
of air defence and formally notified the
conference of her decision to deploy
her own squadron of Hunters Mark
Nine (subsonic) by 1971 a well-
informed guess is that Lee Kuan Yew
will want to see the pilots now being
recruited fly past on August 9, Indepen-
dence Day, of that year.
• Malaysia has agreed to accept re-
sponsibility for the northern radar de-
fences at Penang, near Butterworth,
now operated by the British Air Force.
• Singapore agreed to allow continued
Malaysian use of their ngival base in
Singapore; both Governments agreed to
agree on arrangements for another in-
divisible problem, the control of the

• Malaysia has agreed though it
was not recorded in the communique
to Singaporean troops training in
Malaysia, most probably at Kota Tinggi
Jungle Warfare Training School in
Johore, which will be run “on a multi-
national basis.”
• Joint exercise planning machinery
will be set up and a major joint exer-
cise has been agreed to in principle for
1970.
• “In the light of the commitments and
contributions by the other Govern-
ments” Malaysia said she would be
prepared to consider “additional con-
tributions over and above” her present
armed strength a commitment
evidently more specific than it sounds.
• A further conference was agreed to
for the first half of 1969.
• On the negative side the conference
merely noted the need for “a new
understanding” about AMDA (the
Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement)
in due course.
How were these decisions reached?
Obviously the groundwork for most
of the Malaysia-Singapore agreements
was laid by the working advisory groups
set up by the British Far-East Com-
mander-in-Chief, Sir Michael Carver.
Composed of military men of the Five
Powers, these advisory groups, which
will continue to function, obviously
got further in their deliberations than
anticipated, and most of their recom-
mendations were soon accepted by the
conference. But not all. With a jungle-
warfare school of their own, the Malay-
sians were not interested in picking up
the Kota Tinggi tab. This resulted in
the multi-national formula evolving
instead. It has been obvious for a while
that the British military hoped it would
remain available for training, but the
doubt was as always whether its con-
tinuance would be politically acceptable.
More surprisingly, even incredibly,
the Malaysians were as uninterested in
maintaining the northern radar as they
were to make any “additional contribu-
tions.” Evidently they were looking to
others to continue operating it.
Obviously the joint air-defence pro-
posals and the conference could have
broken down at this point. Strong
British, and considerable Australian,
pressure was evidently exerted, with
the Australian decision to stay at Butter-
worth being the sweetener which
immediately broke the bottleneck.
But overall, as a pressure on the
Australians as well as the Malaysians,
there was what appears to have been
the basic British pressure. This pres-
sure had to be applied because
the brutal fact of Britain’s complete
unwillingness to go on shouldering the
major burden still had to be brought
home.
Malaysia started off the conference
by suggesting Five Power control of
the retained basic facilities and then
pleading development needs over ex-
tended defence expenditure. The Five
Power control suggestion staggered
everyone else but particularly the
British, since they thought they had al-
ready told Tun Razak in London
recently that it was not on. Conceiv-
ably the suggestion might have got
somewhere had Malaysia lined up
support from Singapore, Australia, and
New Zealand. They hadn’t. Mr.
Healey quickly reiterated that Britain’s
decision to withdraw was caused by
Britain’s need for development rather
than defence expenditure,
This development-defence dicho-
tomy was one of the conference’s under-
lying themes. Had everyone used it for
special pleading everyone would have
withdrawn from the conference. People
were recalling the old Bob Hope joke
on Bing Crosby: “There’s nothing I
wouldn’t do for him and there’s noth-
ing he wouldn’t do for me and that’s
how we go through life doing
nothing for each other.”
Luckily there were those who were
willing to do something. The pressure
for progress came from the Singaporean
and Australian assumption that con-
tinuing British interest and involvement
had to be sought, induced, and en-
couraged through upping their own
antes. Hence Butterworth, hence Ten-
gah, hence 12 to 18 Hunters. Hence,
too, British willingness to adjust the
withdrawal timetable so that, for ex-
ample, it is likely that RAF elements
will now remain at Butterworth until

the end of 1971, to make available
the training, the loaned personnel, the
airfields, the radar, and communications
facilities, and ground-to-air defence
equipment out of which a joint air
defence system can be constructed.
Unhappily Malaysia provided her
additional contributions only under the
strongest pressure, thus giving the im-
pression that maybe subconsciously she
was still looking for protectors rather
than allies.
However that may be, certainly some
of the voluble assurances by the Malay-
sians during the Gorton visit betrayed
a hope that Australia will take over
where Britain has now left off, con-
tinuing British interest is very de-
finitely tied to being an ally, not a
protector. Their willingness to be part-
ners in running Kota Tinggi Jungle
Warfare School is contingent on some-
one else commanding or controlling it.
The Malaysians are not interested, since
they have their own school elsewhere
(as has Australia). The advantage for
Australia is, of course, the definite
British interest in using the school for
training even after 1971, not to mention
the interest of third-party countries,
such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the
United States, using it now in its con-
tinued availability.
Similarly in the case of the major
exercise in 1970. Mention of the exer-
cise leads on to the larger questions
the one-and-a-half-day conference
raised but did not answer: Is the
British commitment in future real or
imaginary? And —given the probability
that even the limited concessions
Healey made will land him some dif-
ficulties with the ideological Left back
in London were the other four
countries deluding themselves—or the
Press —in insisting they were satisfied
with British reassurances?
Similarly, were the British, Aus-
tralians, and New Zealanders justified
in likewise asserting their satisfaction
with Malaysia-Singapore reassurances?
Is that promised co-operation indicative
of realised need or merely the product
of a fear that the Australians and New
Zealanders might quickly and com-
pletely depart? This time, presumably
as a result of good diplomatic prepara-
tion, the pressures were not upon Aus-
tralia and New Zealand—but next
time. This time the presence of the
Australian and New Zealand Prime
Ministers was a substitute for decision.
Malaysia and Singapore recognised that
the Anzacs needed time. The conference
itself kept many options open, but time
will move to close them. But what do
the conference decisions mean in terms
of Malaysia-Singapore-Australian and
New Zealand self-interest?
Sufficient for now to note that every
participant thought or said they thought
that the conference was a success. Only
journalists were visibly sceptical
apart from Dr. Goh Keng Swee, who is
always sceptical. But at very least five
separate countries sat down, made
decisions, and got up even more sepa-
rate —but still allies.

Inexpensive Sisalation keeps winter out and slashes
fuel bills up to 40%. It also makes summers 15
degrees cooler. Think what the extra comfort means
in terms of improved productivity. Everyone works
better because they’re comfortable and happy.
Install fire-resistant Sisalation 450 in new or existing
buildings, in the roof and walls and it will work for
you 24 hours a day without pay. Not only will it

Containerisation: senators

of inquiry are often greeted with
cynicism. They are often expensive,
annoying affairs which produce
thoroughly predictable recommenda-

Given broad sensible terms of reference
and good staffing they can throw up
valuable information and conclusions.
In an area where the individual Parlia-
mentarian is becoming overwhelmed by
the specialisation and sheer volume of
Governmental activity, one of his few
means for creative action is in com-
mittee. The American Congressmen
realised this long ago.
The Australian Senate Committee’s
recently released report on containerisa-
tion stimulates this conclusion. It is a.
very worthwhile effort.
The most significant conclusion is
that the Australian National Line can
usefully expand its operations. Not
only can it move into new routes profit-
ably, but it will serve the national
interest by gathering information on the
operational costs on conference routes.
If Australia is to get a fair deal from
the overseas shipping monopolies it may
be more effective to use the Australian
National Line as a source of informa-
tion and as a competitor than to rely
merely on the new restrictive practices
legislation.
The committee made a number of
sensible recommendations for further
investigation of matters it was not able
to come to firm conclusions on. It
suggests the Bureau of Roads should
survey the roads where loads in excess
of present limits could be carried and
the costs of extending these areas. On
the face of it, there seems a case for a
real effort to expand the length limit
of trailers from the present 35 feet to
40 feet. Containers come in 20ft. and
40ft. lengths and with present regula-
tions it will only be possible to carry
a single 20ft. container on a truck—
40ft. containers will only be able to be
used on ships and rail. Extension of the
length limit by five feet would double
the productivity of trucks carrying con-
tainers and allow the big economic
40ft. containers to be carried by road,
as they are in the U.S. and many parts
of Europe. In some cases modification
of bridges might be needed, but over
the long term this may be justified.
We need surveys to find out.
In any case, design of new roads
Containerised shipment for Australia
should obviously allow for an expansion
of the length limit at some time in the
future. As the committee says: “Acute
problems could arise” if the trend to
40ft. containers continued to develop.
The most disappointing aspect of the
report is its failure to come to grips
with the question of the comparative
advantages of Scandia and pure con-
tainer-type ships. The Scandia ships are
all-purpose ships, large, fast, and
modern, which take unit loads as well
as containers. They have already
achieved 25 percent reductions in costs.
The Celular container ships which
exclusively take containers are not yet
in service and so the savings they will
bring are not yet known. The com-
mittee estimates that the overall saving,
terminal-to-terminal, will be of the
order of seven percent.
Tariffs
Board supporters
WE REPORTED LAST week that Dr.
Cairns in the House of Representatives
had adopted the manufacturers’ line on
the Tariff Board’s projected classifica-
tion of industry. Interestingly, in the
Senate, he was subsequently contra-
dicted by one of his colleagues, Senator
O’Byrne:
“At the present time the Tariff Board
is receiving the attention of pressure
groups and even adverse criticism from
people in high places relating to its
proposal to classify industry into
various categories. I commend the
Tariff Board for its initiative and
courage, despite the criticism from pres-
sure groups and from high places in
going ahead with the proposal. In
my view this is the only way in which
we can get a broad look at the whole
canvas of industry as it is developing
in this country. I hope that the criti-
cisms of the Tariff Board will not deter
it from going ahead with its complete
survey. I believe that the time is right
for the classification of various indus-
tries.”
He was then supported by two Gov-
ernment backbenchers. Senator Sim
(Lib., W.A.) said: “We believe that
investment capital and skilled labor are
scarce commodities in Australia and
that they should be directed to indus-
tries which will make the greatest
contribution to our national growth and
not to industries which have received
over many years a high level of pro-
tection which does not sustain either
an efficient or an economic level of
production because it isolates those
industries from the chill wind of com-
petition.”
Senator Bull followed: “I support this
concept because I believe that it is by
encouraging low-cost industries that we
can make our greatest contribution to
the economic growth of Australia. The
classification of industries is something
which has been needed for a long time
and it is with the greatest of gratifica-
tion that I note this is to be done
now.”
Canada
Similarities
IS AUSTRALIA another Canada? The
mineral discoveries of recent times and
the inflow of so much foreign capital
to develop them (both countries’
mineral industries are 60-70 percent
foreign-owned) have underlined many
apparent similarities between the two
countries. But the key question is
whether Australia will benefit as much
from its mineral development as Canada
has. In a forward to an excellent Invest-
ment Review of Australian Companies,
issued to clients of Sydney stockbroker
Ralph W. King and Yuill, similarities
between Canada and Australia are
pointed out by mining consultants Ken-
neth McMahon and Partners.
McMahon makes the point that an
eight-fold increase in the Canadian


mineral industry in the past 20 years
has strongly stimulated Canada’s
economic growth as minerals’ share of
Canada’s gross national product rose
from four percent to seven percent; he
expects the share of g.n.p. made up
by Australia’s minerals to double from
three percent to six percent in the next
decade as Australia increases its
mineral production three-fold and its
exports four-fold.
So Australia’s standard of living
should rise as Canada’s has done;
Canada is now second in the world with
a g.n.p. per head of $U.5.3005 a year,
while Australia is fifth with $U.5.2361.
But there are some differences
between the two countries. Canada uses
a far greater proportion of her own
minerals locally, exporting 55 percent
of production, while Australia will
probably be selling about 70 percent
of her mineral production overseas in
ten years’ time. But Australia has one
decided advantage over Canada, and
that is in the greater relative price
stability of the minerals contributing
most to export income. For instance,
the three major minerals which will
dominate Australian exports in ten years
(iron ore, black coal, and aluminium)
are expected to have good price
stability.
The prospect of less stable prices for
Australia’s next-in-line minerals, like
lead, zinc, copper, and nickel, are not
nearly so important as in Canada, where
prices of two and possibly three of
Canada’s major mineral exports
(copper, nickel, iron ore, and zinc) are
sometimes subject to severe fluctuations.
MEN AND MATTERS
BIDDING FOR Great Boulder shares
was so fierce last week that the an-
nouncement that Mr. M. J. Cody was
going to vacate the board’s chair, after
not quite five years’ occupancy, in favor
of fellow director N. E. Nilsen, who has
been a director for seven years as
against Cody’s 15, was quickly passed
over. Cody joined the board on the
death of his brother P.J., and although
he will remain a member of the board,
his intention is to devote much less
time to the company’s affairs, which
have rather galloped away from
the slow-moving gold into the exciting
new nickel fields of Scotia and Mt.
Martha.
The elsewhere is primarily the hotel
business into which he is reinvesting
large sums made in the minerals world.
Already he has purchased several Mel-
bourne hotels—just how many is prob-
Emil Nilsen
Sir Arthur Petfield
lematical, but at least he owns Chloe—
as well as her abode Young and
Jacksons and the only pub in the
basement of a bank in Melbourne. How
many more he will acquire remains to
be seen until his financial interests in
such as Great Boulder and Loloma are
crystallised into hard cash.
Nils Emil Nilsen, who takes over from
him at Great Boulder at the ripe age
of 66, is, like Cody, an astute financial
tactician (some might put it stronger),
but he is also a mining technocrat with
some forty or more years of widely
varied practical mining experience in
Australia behind him. It was this exper-
tise which the board thought fitted him
perfectly to pilot the Great Boulder
nickel operations. He is, in fact, the only
technical man on the board. Nilsen, who
was born of Norwegian parents at
Pequaming (U.S.), learned his engin-
eering at the Michigan College of
Mines and Technology, and when he
emerged qualified in 1925 went to Can-
ada as a mining engineer before, in
1929, taking a job as a development
engineer at Mt. Isa.
While there he married an Australian
girl, but soon after moved to Lake
View and Star, where he spent a couple
of years, before returning in 1936 to
Mt. Isa to be assistant underground
superintendent. Then in 1936 he
switched over to gold mining and
moved to Fiji, where he stayed until
1949 as general manager of the
Emperor-Loloma-Dolphin trio of min-
ing companies, as well as accumulating
a host of directorships in other mining
companies and becoming vice-president
of the Australian Institute of Mining
and Metallurgy.
THE NAMES Petfield and Queensland
Can Co. have been synonymous in
Brisbane for as long as many can
remember, so when the company was
re-christened United Packages Ltd., it
was appropriate that A. H. Petfield
was dubbed Sir Arthur in the Birthday
Honors.
At 55, Sir Arthur has 38 years’
association with the can company. He
started at the age of 17, and within five
years was company secretary, reaching
top managerial status in 1948 (when
the profit was $49,000), managing
director in 1951, and chairman in 1958.
He can view with satisfaction the
growth of this organisation to a national
complex with tax-paid profit of nearly
$1 million, stockholders’ equity exceed-
ing $ll million, and 1100 on the pay-
roll.
That old provincialism is gradually
breaking down. Sir Arthur called on
Queensland companies to adopt a
national approach and look beyond
their own State borders, and set an
example with United Packages, by
giving it a less parochial name, obtain-
ing Sydney listing for the shares (which
had been listed in the deep south since
the takeover of Paper and Board Indus-
tries at the end of 1961), and by
acquiring a Sydney operation with the
purchase of plastic manufacturer
Ceeco Holdings Pty. UPL now covers
all five mainland States. Last month
the company found overwhelming sup-
port for a $3 million debenture issue.
Besides a seat on the board of
Queensland Insurance and Vinlon Pty.,
Sir Arthur has been a past president
of the Queensland Chamber of Manu-
factures, ex-vice-president of the
Associated Chambers of Manufactures
of Australia, past president of the Com-
monwealth Can Makers’ Association, a
member of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s Manufacturing Industries
Advisory Council (since 1962), and a
commissioner of Overseas Telecom-
munications since 1963.
He was born and schooled in Bris-
bane, and this is still home base. He
has three sons and a daughter, relaxes
at fishing and golf, and in the Queens-
land, Brisbane, Masonic, Brisbane Golf,
and South Brisbane Rotary clubs.
Publishing
Exit the King
THE DEPOSITION of Cecil Harms-
worth King from the chair of the Inter-
national Publishing Corporation was not
so much the outcome of some titanic
power struggle as the near-exhausted
patience of the institutions which hold
the reins, including, in this particular
case, the Pearl, Co-op, and Norwich
Union Insurance Companies and the
Royal Bank of Scotland.
Publicity shy and eminently discreet,
the men who control the investment
portfolios of the institutions have none-
theless drawn increasing comment on
the important role they play in the
U.K.’s public-company life. Their
patience is reputedly long-suffering, for
they understandably tend to think on
a longer-term basis than individual
investors. But should the bacon fail to
be brought home in reasonable time,
it is they who tend to “suggest” what
changes could be made to precipitate
its advent.
Mr. King was hardly undone through
megalomania alone. His personal attack
on an unpopular Prime Minister should
have raised little more than a few eye-


brows in the institutions, although the
associated attack on the economy was
a more serious lapse in discretion (King
being on the Board of the Bank of
England), and in addition clipped 15
pence from the share price of
IPC, though still leaving it standing
well above the year’s low. Unforgive-
however, was King’s apparent
inability to effectively control the cor-
poration he wove together some five
years ago from the strands of the
“Daily Mirror,” the “Sunday Pictorial,”
and the Newnes, Oldham, and Fleetway
publishing groups, together with a £47
million holding in the Reed Paper
Group, £8 million in Associated Tele-
vision, and £2 million in British Relay
Wireless. Further expansion and diversi-
fication of interest took in Paul Hamlyn
and Butterworth in the U.K., a 40 per-
cent interest in Cahners Publishing Co.
in the U.S., Cheshire, Lansdowne, and
Jacaranda in Australia (through the
joint holding with Wilkie and Co. in
Publishing Associates Proprietary Ltd.),
to name but some.
Three major rationalisation schemes
were undertaken in the fields of maga-
zines, books, and printing, which in
Australia brought the various publishing
interests under the central control of
the newly formed IPC Investments
Proprietary Ltd. But notwithstanding
all this activity, the profits of IPC
have slipped badly over the past two
years. Capital employed has shot up
from £66 million to close on £9O
million, while earnings per share have
dropped from 1/9 to 9d. The latest
dividend cut to the new rate of 18
percent, coupled with the need to take
a £1.3 million dip into reserves to pro-
vide it, probably indicates the real
reason for King’s abrupt departure and
the sorry state of the empire he has left
behind.
Obviously, with the “Daily Mirror”
and “Sunday Pictorial” forming the
richest popular-paper combination in
the world, the wilderness of magazines,
the imminence of one of the world’s
largest book-publishing enterprises
under the irrepressible Paul Hamlyn,
and in International Printers, the
biggest printing combine of its kind,
the scope within IPC remains enormous.
And yet there are doubts that even
without Mr. King, and with King’s
protege, Hugh Cudlipp, now in the
seat of the master, the potential can
be tapped.
Many of the 200-odd magazines are
seriously in decline, particularly the
women’s weeklies. Apart from the
“Mirror” and “Pictorial,” there is the
“Sun” making a steady loss of £1.75
million a year. The printing side of the
business, through as many as 21 strikes
and stoppages in nine months, has
chalked up a loss of a couple of million
pounds. Devaluation added another £7
million burden to the corporation. The
cut in the Reed Paper Group’s dividend
last year despite the healthy state
of the Australian subsidiary cost IPC
£680,000, with no particular prospect
of early restoration. And as for the
The Croesus Touch
THE WOES AND MUDDLES
IN PREPARING
FOR CONTAINERISATION
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IF THERE IS ANY regret on the
score of containerisation here it must
be that so far as the overseas shipping
routes are concerned Australia will be
a very late starter and even then only
in a small way. This is a fact of life
on the shipping scene, and the Senate
Select Committee, which tabled its
report on containerisation last week, had
to accept it along with everybody else,
including those who see an assured
future for Australian ships in the over-
seas cargo trades.
But as the Committee first demon-
strated at its various hearings and now
underlines in its comprehensive report,
containerisation, though familiar
enough in coastal shipping, had been
sprung on an Australian canvas woe-
fully unprepared in its overseas cargo-
trades guise.
Detecting muddle and unpreparedness
in various quarters, the Committee
issues a general warning on obscurantist
attitudes to containerisation and singles
out the Melbourne Harbor Trust for
being reluctant to spend more on recep-
tion facilities for the new ships. It
could be that the Senators are a bit
too critical of the port authorities. For
one thing, a spokesman of Associated
Steamships, which will initially handle
most of the feeder services from the
three container ports (Fremantle, Mel-
bourne, and Sydney) to other interstate
ports, seemed satisfied enough with the
progress made when I last spoke to
him.
The Melbourne Harbor Trust has
reason to be piqued at the report, con-
sidering its installations are so well
advanced, indeed almost as well
advanced as those at Fremantle, which
has pulled out all stops to get things
ready by early next year.
Anyhow, although the report is
rather disgruntled with some of the
authorities, at least recent evidence that
some of the ancillary services, such as
customs and forwarding agents, are get-
ting more firmly into position to cope
with containerisation. A company,
International Container Freight For-
warders, was recently formed in Mel-
bourne by a consortium comprising 24
customs agents and one forwarder to
handle such services, and more such
companies are to be formed in other
States. The Melbourne company is to
make a start on the freight problems
thrown up by the roll-on,- roll-off ships
plying between Australia and New
Zealand. It has already established a
depot on a two-acre site in Melbourne
and is prepared to do containerisation
business on an international scale.
Against this, little more has been
heard of the mooted wool villages and
such-like arrangements for co-ordinating
services of other special types for con-
tainerisation, though, as mentioned in
The Bulletin last week, some pro-
gress has been made in Western Aus-
tralia in the provision of facilities for
wool to make it more suitable for con-
tainer and unit-load ship transport. One
can also report that, sad to say, the two
British consortiums which will run the
nine container ships on the Australia-
U.K.-Continent route have so far given
no orders to Australian firms for the
manufacture of any of the 15,000 con-
tainers they will ultimately require,
thus belying an earlier suggestion that
they would be made here. Nor, appar-
ently, has the fibreglass container made
here, which proved successful on a trial
run to Britain, yet been adopted as
hoped by AC:I. As most of the special-
ised wharf equipment, cranes and such-
like, has been imported from Britain,
the main Australian benefit from
preparations here for containerisation so
far has gone to local contractors.
True, Associated Steamships’ new
feeder vessels (fully containerised) are
being built here, but against that the
ANL’s new container ship is being con-
structed in Japan.
The Senate Committee seems pretty
confident that ANL’s venture into the
Japan trade will be a success, and if so
it sees an extended future for its opera-
tions on other overseas routes. The
Federal Government is advised to keep
the possibility under close study. By the
same token, the report advises the ANL
to be wary of any pressures brought to
bear on it (from you know where) to
give concessional rates for exporting
Australian produce because, as it points
out, these would merely be subsidies
under another name. In the meantime,
the report suggests that the ANL will
provide an indispensable guide to the
future possibilities for extension of
operations to other overseas routes from
the valuable information it will gain
on operational costs in plying its con-
tainer between Australia and Japan
from next year.
It wasn’t through want of trying that
the Senators failed to get a clear pic-
ture of the 'benefits in reduced freight
rates that are likely to accrue to Aus-
tralia from containerisation of the
Australia-U.K.-Continent cargo trades
next year. This part of the report can
say merely that some cost saving, cal-
culated by some export firms, of the
order of seven percent from “terminal
to terminal” will result. Failure to get
anything more precise is, of course,
most unsatisfactory, as the Senators
well realise. However, they can comfort
themselves with the thought that they’ve
thrown up many angles on containerisa-
tion worthy of closer attention by the
Government, including those relating
to Federal-State powers, constitutional
questions, likely monopoly tendencies,
and labor problems.

Mining
"Nil desperandum"
IT IS ONLY too easy to lose sight of
the reality of mining in these days of
armchair speculation. But miners are
still something more than a list of
names and figures in the daily Press or
the companies behind those. Individuals
still do burrow into the ground backed
up by little more than their own
enthusiasm in search for copper or
silver or nickel on their own account.
Plenty of them “go broke,” few make
fortunes, but in the Mount Isa area
alone 100 or so have come up with
ores over the past ten years for which
Mount Isa Mines have paid out $7
million. Those particular miners are
not complaining.
The Mount Isa miners “gougers,”
as Queenslanders call them more
appropriately are a motley inter-
national collection of irrepressible
optimists who work “Bill’s Folly” or
“Try Again” or “Nil Desperandum”
(leases which they either own or work
on a tribute basis), down crooked shafts
and along winding drives under the
watchful eyes of the mining wardens
from Mount Isa or Cloncurry. It may
be untidy, but it is not as dangerous
as it seems.
At Cloncurry a Government assayer
performs free assays for the prospectors,
and on the basis of his findings a 101 b.
sample of ore is then dispatched to the
Mount Isa Mines for further testing.
The samples arrive in old vests or news-
papers or rusty cans. If the tests prove
positive the consignments of ore start
rolling up in anything from a World
War II blitz-wagon to the latest
acquisition of a cartage contractor. In
a good week as many as 20 such loads
may appear.
It is something of a mystery what
attracts a former member of the priest-
hood, a waiter from the Savoy in
London, or a one-time window-dresser
to a lonely wilderness. It is hardly
money. Many gougers earn little more
than they would in a suburban factory,
and that .tends to be regularly dissi-
pated on a binge along the Gold Coast.
Some say they like the life, or the free-
dom, others that gouging is a disease.
All are evasive. But for 100 years there
has been some attraction there which
makes the physically and financially
precarious life of hard work, loneliness,
and privation acceptable, and it still
remains to a suprising extent.

The economy: The Acting Prime Minister and the
Minister for Customs and Excise gave conflicting reasons
for the proposed increases in prices of Australian-made
cars . . . but Mr. McEwen blamed Japanese dumping.
April imports of Japanese motor vehicles were the highest
for any month ever.
The Australian Resources Development Bank chairman
repeats that overseas borrowing is unattractive. Chairman
of the Australian Finance Conference said Australians
had never been better credit payers than now, and were
not overcommitted, with savings bank deposits averaging
$5lO, almost four times average instalment debt of
$l2B. Australians were paying only 7.8 percent of their
take-home pay to meet instalments compared with
14.3 percent in U.S.A.
The markets: After nine successive days’ climb, the all
ordinaries index in Sydney was checked on Friday, with
a shading from 603.79 to 606.06. Exuberant trading on
Wednesday put the index through the 600 barrier.
Non-ferrous metals also sobered up from Wednesday’s
peak of 3638.10 to 3569.92. Similarly, Queensland’s
oil index eased from 450.11 on Wednesday to 432.99
by Friday.
Great Boulder staged one of the most interesting
performances during the week, with observers in suspense
over what eventuated as the anticlimax of Mr. Cody’s
retirement, and later in the week assay results which were
nothing spectacular. Top price in anticipation of news
was $l6, but the final price for the week was $ll.BO . . .
Plenty of call options were taken out on Western Mining,
and the price on the market touched $14.50 before settling
20c lower. Hamersley moved to a new level of $l6,
but dropped $1 on Friday.
Golds were all over the place, with Hill 50 coming
in for concentrated attention on Friday.
Oil spectacular last week was the launching of Abrolhos
Oil, shortly to spud-in in W.A. waters, at up to 11 times
initial subscription.
An industrial newcomer, Byrne and Davidson, the
roll-a-door people, provided stags with a 50 percent
capital gain on opening sale of 75c . . . Gollin rose
mysteriously by 44c to $1.30 on Tuesday, but the company
knew of no reason why it should.
Australian nickel shares bounced back strongly in
London on Friday with Great Boulder trading at $2.22
above Sydney’s closing quotes. Hampton Properties,
Western Mining, Metal Exploration, Broken Hill, and
North Kalgurli all rallied after Thursday’s setbacks, prices
being generally firm on Sydney’s close.
Volume on Wall Street reached a record 20,413,000
shares on Thursday. Prices declined slightly, however, to
be followed by a strong Friday afternoon rally to close
the week.
Companies: Tax deductions on Mt. Newman iron ex-
penditure helped CSR to boost profit 13 percent in the
year to March to $14.5 million. Pre-tax was steady.
R. Fowler plans a bonus to fend off the $4.5 million
takeover offering from its competitor in sanitary-ware,
the Royal Doulton group. A one-for-four has been promised.
L. J. Hooker’s bid for the Hotel Metropole is being
opposed by apparently two other parties on the market.
The mystery bidder for Mick Simmons has reduced his
sights from 28.6 to 10 percent of the capital.
Rothschild’s International Pacific Corporation opened
and closed heavily oversubscribed for its share issue. Directors
will allot 1\ million shares, including 2\ million over-
subscribed.
Bushells’ profit rose nine percent, but only because of
lower tax and depreciation. Profit of unlisted Massey-
Ferguson slumped from $833,000 to $469,000 in the April
half-year due to drought. Dividend to the Dutch parent
from Philips Industries, the electrical group, was slashed
from 15 to 10 percent in 1967 calendar year, when
profit fell from 17.4 to 9.9 percent on capital.
Jeffries Industries earned $135,000 for the May six
months, after two full years of unprofitable trading . . .
Nock and Kirby earned higher profit in the February
six months . . . Taubmans had a steady profit for the
six months to March.
Sundry rumors surrounded A. G. Healing and directors’
denial did little to settle the matter . . . The Attunga
Mining Co., which is stockpiling copper near Tamworth,
was understood to be giving Healing a 10 percent
interest.
The MLC predicts a record year for 1968, as 1967
growth has been sustained in the first five months. More
jam for shareholders of Monbulk Preserves; a
one-for-five issue at 50c par, to service higher production
in the canning and fresh meat divisions. Exceptional
circumstances relating to the Tasmanian bushfires destruction
of the brewery did not prevent Cascade Brewery from
topping last year’s record profit.
Total, currently marrying with Boral, made its first
profit in 15 years’ effort in Australia. Caltex’s Australian
Oil Refinery made a $5.9 gain on sterling devaluation,
not all realised yet, and the profitability of its refinery
recovered to $879,000.
Volkswagen Australia is negotiating with Nissan and
other Japanese car manufacturers to assemble Japanese
vehicles here.
Jumping in on the mineral bandwagon, Kamilaroi Oil,
that misnomer, announced a one-for-one par issue with
options. United Uranium is making a one-for-two issue
at 50c premium.

THE PROSPECTS OF
RECOVERING
FORMER GLORIES
IT’s tpl\T TIME of year again
when we polish up our biros, develop
devious looks, straighten our halos, and
prepare for our annual joust with the
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation
(I’ve often wondered just what the
actual Commissioner does perhaps
he saves his energy for the really dif-
ficult ones). An Englishman summed
up the whole situation rather admirably
the other day when he said: “Having
a row with the Tax Commissioner is
like having an affair with an elephant.
There can be no possible enjoyment in
it for anyone. You are in serious danger
of being overlaid and, in the unlikely
event of any results being manifest,
they will not be seen for 21 months.”
Never mind. A company which I
feel will produce the goods far quicker
than our elephant is Dickson Primer. It
is probably one of the best recovery
prospects for 1967/68. You may
remember that this was the company
that got into strife two years ago when
one of its then newly acquired sub-
sidiaries started churning out losses in
such a great volume that Dickson
Primer itself went under to the tune of
$20,000. Last year, however, the com-
pany was able to sort itself out again
and came good with a profit equal to
about two-thirds of its 1965 effort and
returning 12.3 percent on capital. This
year it looks as thought 'the return to
•past glories will be even more marked.
The December half-year’s earnings were
reported to be at the annual rate of
15.5 percent and getting better every
day, as is the company’s share price.
It started off the year at a low of $0.35
and is now up to $0.54. Allowing for
a return to a 9 percent dividend rate,
which now seems on the cards, as the
interim dividend has been moved up
from 4 to percent, the current price
gives an effective yield of 8.2 percent.
In my opinion this is far too high for a
stock of Dickson Primer’s calibre. In
the hope that it won’t be too long be-
fore the rest of the market comes
around to this way of reasoning, I
bought 400.
Another company whose shares are
rocketing along at the moment is Lend
Lease Corporation. This year they have
gone from a low of $l.OO to a high
and current price of $1.75, the highest
they have been since 1962. This recent
buying support, a lot of which has
come from London, where the stock
enjoys some degree of popularity, is no
doubt justified. Last year the company
earned a record profit of $1.5 million,
which was almost sufficient to cover its
11 percent dividend twice over. This
year it should do even better as the
profits begin to flow in from several of
its projects which have been completed
over the past 12 months. These would
include the Sulman medal-winning Aus-
tralia Square in Sydney and the Princes
Gate in Melbourne. The fact that the
interim dividend was hitched up 1
percent is also encouraging. Anyone
wanting a good investment for a year
or two would find it hard to justify
passing up Lend Lease even at today’s
price. Unfortunately, it has now prob-
ably moved too far too quickly to be
a short-term investment, which excludes
me from being a buyer. Guess it serves
me right for not being on the ball
earlier.
Another company whose shares are
currently at their high for the year but
which I consider are Still a good pros-
pect in the short-term are Leighton
Contractors. This company, which
operates an Australia-wide civil
engineering and building business, has
done, and is doing, very well indeed.
Both its profit and its earning rate (to
say nothing of its share price) have
been doubled in the past two years—
last year’s earning rate being in excess
of 40 percent. And this has been
achieved along with two par issues, both
1 for 4, and a hoist in the dividend rate
from ten percent to 13 percent. The
current year looks like being another
good one. The mere fact alone that
1967/68 has been such a buoyant year
generally and especially for construc-
tional work must mean that a com-
pany like Leighton’s can hardly miss
out. The company’s interim report
tends to reflect this. It reveals that the
company had $24 million worth of
work on hand, which compares with
the total turnover for the whole of
1966/67 of $l6 million. On the basis
that this year’s final result will show
quite a leap up in profits and on the
basis that its shares will probably
follow in sympathy I bought 200.
Sales this week were Email and A. V.
Jennings. Both companies proved good
investments. Email earned profit of $53
and Jennings returned $127.

Better nickel news coming?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
EVERY TIME the market gets nervous
(which it has every right to do in such
reckless times) it is worth remembering
that it only needs good news to give it
another kick along. Last week’s sudden
downturn, with Great Boulder’s dis-
appointing report from Mt. Martin
adding to speculators’ uneasiness, is
simply the other side of that penny;
unimpressive news gives the market the
wrong sort of kick. The market was
even disappointed when an exciting-
sounding Great Boulder Press confer-
ence turned out be nothing more than
an announcement that the chairman
was retiring; it did seem an unusual
thing to call a Press conference for.
But there could be plenty of the
right sort of news in coming weeks
(apart from the disturbing information
that growing numbers of official in-
vestigations are going on into some
well-informed buying—and selling—that
has marred the boom in recent weeks).
If the very strong reports from Mel-
bourne are any guide, then at least two
nickel stocks, Western Mining Corpora-
tion and Great Boulder, could have a
lot more to say for themselves long
before their next regular reports are
due to come out.
There has been a great deal of specu-
lation about the depth that Great
Boulder’s last three diamond drib holes
near the Mt. Martin mine are going
down. There are very strong reports
indeed that holes numbers 87, 88, and
89 would have gone through an in-
teresting area had they been deepened
to below the 1000 ft. level. Unfor-
tunately, the company does not say in
its official reports what its basement
is in these holes, although the number
of feet of diamond drilling completed
since the last report (14,298) suggests
either that there were many more holes
drilled than the report .talks about (and
that they were presumably unsuccessful;
there may be nine in this category at
Mt. Martin if the gaps in the drill-
hole numbers in the report mean any-
thing) or else that the ten holes re-
ported on went far below the levels
of interest for which directors issued
assays. The reality is probably a mix-
ture of both, although there are sug-
gestions in the market that at least
one hole may have been drilled to
great depth—something like 1400 ft. In
this situation, it seems that perhaps
mineral companies could contemplate
putting out the same sort of reports as
oil companies and state the basement
depth.
If these reports turn out to be fact,
then the possibility of Great Boulder
coming up with some good values
underneath its existing proven ore-
bodies may well explain London’s re-
markable enthusiasm for the shares.
(Last Friday it added back a large
slab of what it took off after last Thurs-
day’s reports of only moderate values at
Mt. Martin, none of which exceeded
2.05 percent nickel.)
But, even without such speculation,
the fact that Great Boulder really does
have some nickel and has the prospect
of ending up with two mining opera-
tions, one at Scotia and the other on
moderate values at Mt. Martin, makes
the company a lot more interesting
than many of those whose only stake
in the nickel search is a mining lease
(or the hope of one) in an area more
or less in the nickel belt. At least
with Great Boulder a speculator
couldn’t lose all his money; there will
always be a residue or quality no
matter what could happen to the com-
pany’s shares in a shakeout.
The same goes, only more so, for
WMC, which is also the centre of great
speculative activity right now. The
remarkable strength of demand for
WMC shares, which had them up at
their peak last week despite the un-
happiness being felt in most other sec-
tions of the speculative market, is said
to rely on discoveries of nickel values
so staggeringly high that they are be-
ing checked and rechecked before be-
ing released. The amount of call option
activity in WMC has been remarkable;
last week we pointed out that 50,000
calls had been written on the stock in
the previous week, and this was fol-
lowed by a further 70,000 last week.
The shares will have to rise to about
$l7 before most of these even begin
to pay off.
THOSE BRITISH trusts that are
sticking by the British Government’s re-
quests for restraint in their export of
capital to Australian can nevertheless
take up positions in British stocks with
Australian interests. For instance, the
Pan Australian trust of Southern Cross
Management Ltd. has the U.K.
Treasury’s blessing in making a new
issue of units for the first time in two
years. The reason is that Pan Australian
The Chartist says:
WESTERN MINING CORPORA-
TION LTD. was again, recommended
in this column in April of this year
when prices were about $8.70. It was
then suggested that a rise to $ll.OO
could be expected. A further comment
was again issued in May, 1968, to the
effect that a target of $15.00 was a
possibility. As prices are now close to
that level, the situation can once again
he reassessed in terms of a move of
major importance to approximately
$25.00 in the short to medium term.
Last sale price on 13/6/’6B $13.80.

is buying shares in British companies
with iarge investments in Australia. In
this category are Consolidated Gold-
fields and Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation
in the mining market and Rowton
Houses, S. Hoffnung, Van Diemens
Land, Slater Walker, D. & J. Fowler,
and Oddeninos (parent of Lend Lease)
in the industrial list.
But Pan Australian nevertheless
holds many Australian stocks; its “star
turn” has been BHP, which makes up
16| percent of the present value of the
trust. And many British trusts seem
to be going ahead buying up Australian
shares despite the British Government’s
policy. So long as the Australian Gov-
ernment leaves the sterling funds in-
volved in British investment here in its
London credits, then the British Gov-
ernment may feel little inclined to do
anything really savage about stopping
this flow, as the difficulties in trying to
do so would be immense and would
damage sterling still further as a world
currency. It looks as if the flow of
funds from Britain will continue until
it stops of its own accord—whenever
that might be.
THERE HAVE been repeated warn-
ings on this page that some of the
more speculative stocks in the mining
boom will end up at only a fraction of
their current prices when nickel fever
eventually eases off. But there is no
doubt about the Short-term benefits to
be had from these, many of which
are hangovers from past booms with
little else to their name but mining
tenements.
Bamboo Creek Gold Mines NL has
long been good for a laugh. An in-
operative gold-miner, its 50-cent shares
paid up 'to ten cents were worth only
a few cents last year. This year the
low-point has been 38 cents. The reason
is that Bamboo Creek has eight nickel
tenements eight miles south of Marble
Bar. And this, too, would be worth
another chuckle, for it is several hun-
dred miles from the accepted “nickel
belt” between Higginsville and Scotia.
But right alongside Bamboo Creek,
the giant Canadian company Comico
Exploration Pty. Ltd. is doing exactly
the same thing . . . seeking nickel from
7500 acres of pegged claims.
There was even some degree of con-
firmation to the strong market rumors
that Bamboo Creek had nickel. It was
confirmed that gossans, which can in-
dicate sulphides down below, had been
taken south for assay.
Similarly, Haoma Gold Mines NL
has been among the low-priced specu-
lative stocks for many months. Last
week the punters closed in on the
rumor that the company was to get
direct equity with North West Mining
NL (a company that had unsuccessfully
sought listing) in a tenement south of
the Scotia lease where the Great
Boulder-North Kalgurli partnership had
reported at the weekend a nickel find
that, on the face of it, indicates a com-
mercial proposition.
North West Mining confirmed that
it was negotiating for three mineral
claims held by F. R. Smith. But it was
harder to link nickel with dry-cleaning
and building development in Brisbane,
which has been the forte of Alexander
Sterling Ltd., the listed Queensland
company; here rumor has it that the
company also is interested in the Scotia
area —and this was enough to double
the share price.
Another building developer in on the
hunt is the Sydney-based Project
Development Corporation, whose prin-
cipal, Mr. Eric Clementson, has already
made a name for himself in the Western
Australian cattle industry. The com-
pany has been operating at Southern
Cross, 120 miles west of Kambalda, and
the market was expecting something
rather better than the announcement
that the company had found traces of
nickel and copper, with nickel values
averaging 0.25 percent.
The Adelaide-based Poseidon NL also
found nickel values—'but again only
0.45 to 0.6 percent, and hundreds of
miles from Kambalda, in the Bindi
Bindi district. Yet all of these finds,
small as they are, tend to confirm the
vastness of the potential nickel ore
regions in Western Australia. Already
sulphides have been intersected over
more than 100 miles, and anywhere
this has happened there is a potential
nickel mine. And many hundreds of
miles away around Marble Bar com-
panies experienced in nickel prospect-
ing are spending a lot of money seeking
ore-bodies.
Of all the punters’ stocks, few can
match the London-based Hampton
Properties and the Perth-based West
Coast Holdings for sheer spectacle.
Hampton Properties holds the ground
around the Mount Martin mine where
Great Boulder is exploring. The shares,
4/-stg. fully paid, were worth a few
cents this tim? last year. Since then
they have arrangements both with
Great Boulder and with the giant
International Nickel (which certainly
has found something but has announced
absolutely nothing). The shares have
been split to l/-stg. units, which last
week were selling for more than $6.
West Coast Holdings, $200,000 in
de'bt, was made liquid by a share place-
ment during a period of de-listing at
the company’s request while negotia-
tions were under way with the Boulder
Syndicate—a group with a tenement
adjoining the tenement containing
Western Mining Corporation’s rich
Durkin Shoot. It will be seeking re-
listing later this month. This year the
price has risen, again from less than
10 cents, to $1.40 at the time of de-
listing. Last week in Perth punters
were advertising for shares, being
traded as high as $5.
And now the inoperative W.A. gold-
miner Hill 50 Consolidated NL is
negotiating an option with a “big and
well-known” American mining com-
pany (rumored variously as Newmont
or Cleveland Cliffs) over 34 nickel
tenements near Grants Patch, in the
Broad Arrow district down the line from

The Melbourne market
Export difficulties
for aluminium
ALTHOUGH THE SHARES of Mel-
bourne-based Metal Manufactures
Ltd. are not listed, as, say, in the case
of Alcoa, which is similarly unlisted, a
considerable stake is owned by Broken
Hill, South and North Broken Hill (the
majority shareholder being British
Insulated Callender’s Cables of Britain
with about 61 percent of the capital).
The local shareholders won’t get all
that much joy from the account for
1967 published last week, except that it
portends what should prove to be a
very useful increase in fabricating cap-
acity in aluminium. Directors indicate
that major development programs
initiated by the company last year are
going ahead according to plan; these
include a new continuous casting and
rolling plant for aluminium rod and
modern heavy wire drawing and
stranding plant at Port Kembla, to be
commissioned in 1968; and also, at
the same works, two 84in. bull blocks
with ancillary equipment for the manu-
facture of tubing.
At Alexandria, a new rod-extrusion
press is about to be commissioned and,
at the Cable Makers Australia Pty.
Ltd. works at Liverpool, a new factory
for the automated processing of PVC
compounds and high-speed production
of building wire is about to come into
operation.
The introduction of plant improve-
ments such as these are designed to
increase efficiency and reduce manu-
facturing costs, and should enable the
company to meet increasing competi-
tion and maintain volume of sales. By
these means directors expect to be able
to avoid having to pass on the full
impact of increasing costs of wages,
salaries, and services.
However, into this play now comes
Alcoa’s announcement 'this week of its
first increase in the price of unalloyed
primary aluminium for which Metal
Manufactures is one of its best
customers. Admittedly, the rise is only
from 23.2 to 24 cents a pound, but
taken over big volume it could make a
considerable impact on Metal Manu-
factures’ profit margins, thus dimming
the prospect for its profits as a whole
(these moved up from $6,135,458 to

$6,498,776 in the year to December 31
last after a relatively poor first half
and later recovery in demand).
Added to this is the fact that, as the
report confirms, sterling and N.Z.
dollar devaluations export business has
become more competitive, quite apart
from the lower Australian currency
equivalent of sales to Britain and N.Z.
The question is whether the company
can pass on the increase in metal costs
in its fabricated ones. So far as its Aus-
tralian business is concerned this will
probably happen because Alcoa is lead-
ing the way with selected increases in
the prices of semi-fabricated products
and these will be of the order
of l-g- percent a pound.
This should assist any move by
Metal Manufactures to pass on the
higher cost of metal, but it can hardly
be calculated to help its competitive
position in export markets where it is
making every effort to step up its
sales. It is a bit ironic that Alcoa’s
price increases, according to the com-
pany, have been dictated by “increased
materials and wages costs which can
no longer be completely absorbed.”
The Achilles’ heel of this sort of merry-
go-round in cost increases is the com-
petitive position of exports on which
the vigorous expansion of the alu-
minium industry seems to be geared
much more than it is to the sheltered
domestic market for prefabricated pro-
ducts. Perhaps the lesson is worth
noting for industrial companies as a
whole. As pointed out by this column
a while back, the best bets on the
market are the sheltered industries,
whose business is in the home market
and, therefore, largely insulated from
the effects of overseas devaluations and
international squalls generally. In
present circumstances, with the Aus-
tralian dollar somewhat overvalued in
the world’s foreign exchange markets,
a good rule for investors might be to
give manufacturing companies with
substantial exports a wide berth at
present.
Of course there’s a lot more to the
difficulties facing such manufacturers
in their export business than having
the over-valued Australian currency
to reckon with as apparently the Aus-
tralian Trade Mission now in London
has discovered after trekking through
Europe. One of the things we need,
according to the mission’s leader, Mr.
P. C. Murray, is an Import-Export
Bank similar to the one in the U.S. to
extend the sort of credit terms available
to most of our competitors in overseas
markets for manufacturers. We’ve got
practically all kinds and sizes of banks,
but not this one. So when Mr. Murray
gets back he should sound Mr.
McMahon’s usually receptive ear on
the idea of starting one. This could
help give manufacturing exporters a
better image in the market. But for
the present there’s not much of a case
for them.

Bright Steels after rain
THINGS have been a bit tough in
the bright-steel business for the past
couple of years, what with the drought,
disappointing new-vehicle sales, and an
only modest rate of economic growth.
But now it looks as if prospects for
Martin Bright Steels Ltd., the only
exclusively bright-steel maker, are get-
ting much brighter. And the timing
could not be better; this week trading
opens in the company’s one-for-five
rights issue.
The issue, of $1 shares at 20-cents
premium, is to raise $606,000 of the
unstated cost of the recent acquisition
of ACl’s Sydney and Brisbane bright-
steel operations. This was paid for by
short-term loans (which this issue will
repay), some long-term borrowings,
and the issue of 100,000 $1 shares at
70 cents premium to ACI. So the total
cost was probably around $1 million or
so.
Both the ACI placement (with re-
stricted right of disposal) and the
new-issue shares are ineligible for divi-
dends until January, 1969, which means
they do not participate in the interim
for 1968-69, allowing the company a
breathing space in which to integrate
the acquired assets and improve
efficiency.
The ten percent dividend should be
maintained on the new capital, in the
absence of unforeseen circumstances, say
directors, so the dividend commitment
for 1968-69 will be lifted from $252,000
to $283,000, and in 1969-70 to $312,000
(still well covered by last year’s profit,
even though working profit has shown
no rise over the past two years).
Business is still not really booming,
but it is healthy, according to the com-
pany. In the last year to June, profit
picked up 13 percent after higher
taxation, and the greater part of the
improvement was apparently in the
general engineering sphere. But earning
rate was still below the 1964-65 peak.
The interim report for 1967-68 spoke
of a continuance of this improving
trend, although directors then feared
the second half’s profits might be
affected by the present disturbed
national labor position (a fear which
has not been justified by events).
The chairman’s report spoke of
cautious optimism. In general terms:
“Provided that overall conditions, in-
cluding wages and production costs,
remain reasonably stable, the year now
current could result in a satisfactory
net profit. The major doubt is, of
course, the recurrence of drought in
many important primary producing
areas of Australia including some of
the eastern wheatgrowing areas of
N.S.W. and Queensland as well as the
important Riverina area.”
Labor costs must, nevertheless, be a
worry. There were three wage increases
within the year to June, 1967, in
July, 1966, December, 1966, and June,
1967, which lifted wage costs by
percent, and then the metal trades
award of December, 1967, ranging from
$7.40 to $10.05, which exceeded the
combined increases of the three pre-
ceding decisions.
Employers are now paying 70 per-
cent of the rises granted, or $7 a week
for the average metal tradesman, while
the remaining 30 percent is deferred
until December. If the metal trades
decision flows on automatically to all
awards, with no absorption into over-
award payments, award wages could
rise by ten to 20 percent. So far, how-

ever, industrial stoppages relating to
the wage increases have been fairly
minimal.
The company has had to increase
selling prices slightly this year, but this
has not affected sales; earlier price
increases were made in July, 1964, and
in August, 1966. At least it has no diffi-
culties with the availability of the raw
material from BHP and Australian Iron
and Steel.
But profits are certain to rise appreci-
ably despite higher labor costs. By the
purchase of ACl’s Queensland and
N.S.W. machinery and stock, Martin
Bright Steels expects to effect economies
through increased production in Sydney
at its Rozelle plant.
In addition, it puts Martin Bright
in a very strong position in bright steel,
with a virtual monopoly in N.S.W. and
Queensland. In Victoria, (here is only
ACl’s remaining plant, Brunton’s
Bright Steel Co., at Spotswood, to con-
tend with, along with Massey Ferguson,
which is not very big and produces
mainly for its own requirements.
There seems little doubt that busi-
ness is picking up for bright steels,
which are made from normal carbon or
alloy steels supplied by BHP and Aus-
tralian Iron and Steel. (The processes
employed by Martin Bright of drawing,
turning, grinding, and curing the steel
give it a silvery finish but do not
make it rustproof and reduce it to
accurate sizes, an important require-
ment in the engineering industry.)
Almost all steel-using manufacturing
industry directly, or indirectly, uses
bright steel as raw material or as part
of its production plant. This almost
universal usage provides a sound base
for the company’s business. The com-
pany has been in bright-steel manufac-
turing since 1929, and distributes
throughout Australia and New Zealand
steels under the “Marbrite” brand. It
acquired Beverley Bright Steels Pty.
Ltd. from Australian National In-
dustries in 1958-59 for $515,000.
Bright steel is used in the production
and maintenance of mechanical equip-
ments for primary industry (tractors,
harvesting and picking mechanisms,
irrigation and pumping equipment,
agricultural machinery); in the local
manufacture of autos, trucks, and foad
and rail transport vehicles and their
replacement parts; in electrical and
household appliances, including lawn-
mowers; in defence equipment; as the
basic raw material for manufacture of
bright bolts and nuts; and in hand
tools.
Drought has influenced- trading
adversely in the past three years, but
seasonal conditions are now more
promising for farm equipment, a large
user of bright steel. Similarly, rising
rural purchases of new cars and trucks
should continue to be a factor in better
production figures of motor vehicles,
another large user.
The company has voiced disapproval
of the Government allowing the import
to Australia of original and replace-
ment auto parts, and, of course, the
import of fully assembled vehicles
reduces the consumption of locally
produced bright steel. Imports of
motor vehicles fell 11 percent last year
to $213 million, but in 'the nine months
to March of the current financial year
these imports rose 28 percent to $196
million, and this has been a cause for
continuing concern.
From the 1967 accounts, it looked as
if the company’s higher turnover had
been brought at some cost; debtors rose
30 percent, while stocks rose 16 per-
cent. But the company seems content
enough; debtors are said to fluctuate,
and their increase does not denote any
policy of extension of credit for
customers. Stocks are influenced by the
rolling program of the suppliers.
The current ratio remained steady at
1.9, even though overdraft more than
doubled to $684,000, but long-term
liabilities were reduced from $985,000
to $805,000, as loans on mortgage and
notes of $lBO,OOO became repayable


CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

during 1967-68. Deposits repayable at
call fell from $337,000 to $187,000.
The interest bill on term loans and
notes fell from $lOB,OOO to $78,000.
On June 30, 1966, convertible notes
issued in November, 1961, were con-
verted to 300,600 ordinary shares.
Directors regret that this form of
financing developmental expenditure is
no longer available.
Freehold land and buildings were
in the books at $3,081,000 before
depreciation of $64,000, affording a
security for mortgage borrowings which
could provide the long-term funds the
company currently needs for the ACI
purchases.
Of the plant, machinery, and equip-
ment, $616,000 is shown as 1961
written-down value, additions since
then $2,056,000, less depreciation of
$l.l million, a net of $1,571,000..
The original works were at Rozelle,
and a fairly considerable sum,, relative
to the size of the firm, has lately been
spent on up-dating the whole building,
demolishing and rebuilding the old
parts. In October, 1956, the company
began production in a plant in Kilburn
(S.A.), and in April, 1963, in Somerton
(Vic.).
There was some investment allow-
ance available in 1963 as tax relief,
but ever since tax provided has been,
if anything, in excess of standard rates.
The 1965 tax provision of $506,000
was in excess of declared profit, sug-
gesting some conservatism in the
accounting for that year at least.
TO SUM UP: The right trading,
which begins this week, could afford
an opportunity to get into a sound,
basic manufacturing concern with in-
creased production facilities and good
prospects at something around $1.82,
calculated on present cum rights price
of $2.00, and allowing for dividend dif-
ferences. The yield then would be
almost 5.5 percent, and 10.9 percent
on last year’s earnings. If investors buy
the new shares they will have to wait
for a dividend until next financial
year’s final payment.
The shares are no high flier, and
wage increases do place a question
mark over current profitability, at least
until the additional costs can be
absorbed by greater rising demand,
higher turnover, and adjusted selling
prices. But the company’s growth in
recent times should soon begin to pay
off.

Stramit: building on straw
MR. J. B. HOBART, then aged 43, a
builder with experience also in manu-
facturing, went on a European trip for
two years in the early 19505, and in
1954 obtained an exclusive licence to
produce Stramit board in Australia.
• Back in Australia, Hobart formed a
new company and commenced manu-
facture late in 1954 in a Brooklyn
(Melbourne) plant. In its then existing
product form, the commercial advan-
tages of the board were somewhat
limited, as it had dubious load-bear-
ing capabilities. The new Australian
company pioneered a new type of com-
pressed-straw board, which was capable
of being used as a trafficable ceiling
with a load-bearing capacity up to five
tons.
In 1956 the strawboard operation was
transferred to a new plant at Bendigo
(Victoria), where large-scale produc-
tion commenced. Later the Australian
company was granted patents for the
new manufacturing process involved.
Bendigo was selected for the new
plant as it is a suitable centre for the
gathering and storage of straw, a bulky
material much more difficult to trans.
port than the finished product. In an
average season, up to half a million
bales of straw are harvested for
Stramit. The company employs 20
teams of balers, who work only at night
so as to get the right moisture content
in the straw. In what is now the big-
gest concentration of straw in the world,
set on a 43-acre site, the straw is first
cleaned, then conditioned, transferred
to a vertical hopper, which feeds the
straw to a horizontal compression
chamber which is heated to 300 deg. C,
through which it is forced by a ram,
applying a pressure of 20 tons to the
square inch. The straw core emerges
from the curing chamber permanently
stabilised. The kraft liners are then
coated with urea formaldehyde resins
and adhered to the core, and the board
is re-cured by heat in a second curing
and compression chamber.
Important as the Stramit board range
is to the company, this division now
represents only 17 percent of group
turnover, while metal building products
add up to 50 percent and the balancing
33 percent is in contracting services.
Since 1960, Stramit Boards Ltd. has
been publicly listed and the company’s
activities extended interstate to Sydney
in 1959, Canberra 1960, Brisbane 1962,
and Hobart 1963.
The production of roof decking by
a continuous process through the tech-
nique of roll forming came to Australia
in the 1950 s from the U.S. Metal
strip is passed through a series of
rolls, which progressively form the
corrugations or other shapes, and from
thence to the shears, which cut the
rolled-form metal to the desired length.
This makes possible the manufacture of
galvanised steel, aluminium, and copper
decking in variable and long lengths.
Stramit was the second Australian com-
pany to enter the roll-formed roof-
decking market. This was in 1957, with
a product known as “35,” designed as
an outside weather shield for the
Stramit board ceiling. More recent
designs by Stramit have been “Speed-
Deck” and “Monsoon Deck,” which
are both continuous metal deckings.
These are produced in Min. and 20in.
widths in galvanised steel, aluminium,
and copper, and in spans up to 12 feet
between the purlins. In prefabricated
form before leaving the factory, the
decking can be supplied up to a maxi-
mum length of 50 feet, or as long as
transport regulations permit. The com-
pany also produces the purlins, which
are roll-formed metal products used as
supports in roofs and ceilings. Associ-
ated products include metal wall clad-
dings and fascia gutters. Stramit 'nas a
strong engineering division, which de-
signs and manufactures most of its
capital equipment.
The popularity of continuous-metal
decking comes from its being a virtually
leak-proof roof even when applied to
near-flat roofs. It is exceedingly strong
and fast to lay. It is increasingly in
demand by architects for the new flat-
roof factory trend, but has become
popular also in the low pitch to the
steep “A”-frame construction.
Including aluminium, the popularity
of which is rapidly advancing in the
Speed Deck profile, and copper, Stramit
claims to be running second only to
Brownbuilt in the Australian continuous-
metal-roofing stakes. (Since 1967,
Brownbuilt has become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Lysaghts.) Stramit has
practically the whole of the Canberra
and Tasmania market to itself, is co-
equal leader with Brownbuilt in Vic-
toria, and is in third place in New South
Wales and Queensland. What dis-
tinguishes Stramit from its major com-
petitors is that it is prepared to install
its own products on site by its own
contracting department about 60
percent of Stramit’s group turnover
is earned on a supply-and-erection basis,
and the company will give a ten-year
guarantee for both workmanship and
materials. With their own contracting
department being such a major element
in their business, the Stramit people are
probably right in believing that they
are more closely in contact with the
practical requirements and the thinking
and preferences of the building industry
and the architects and engineers who
influence it than most of their com-
petitors. The contracting division started
up in Melbourne in 1958 and extended
to Canberra in 1960, Brisbane in 1963,
Hobart in 1964, and Sydney in 1965.
About 50 percent of Stramit’s group
employment is made up of men in the
contracting field teams.

The slowing down in the rate of
profit growth in 1967 largely reflected
reorganisation in the New South Wales-
operation. In New South Wales, the
manufacturing and sales departments
were housed on a one-acre site at
Dee Why, which proved an uneconomic
location; a new sales centre was opened
in Miller Street, North Sydney, in 1967,
at a cost of about $200,000 —this is very
close to where many leading architects
have their offices and the manufacturing
plant was rehoused on a new four-acre
site at Girraween (near Parramatta).
The Dee Why premises have since been
sold.
The interim announcement in March,.
1968, indicated that sales for the six
months to December, 1967, rose 14
percent compared with the previous
six months and were 10.7 percent higher
than recorded for the half-year ending
December, 1966. Net profit for the six
months to December, 1967, showed an
increase of 11 percent over the corres-
ponding period of 1966. Although the
interim dividend has been raised from
2.5 cents to 3.125 cents per share, the
full dividend for the year will probably
be at the unchanged rate of 6.25 cents
per share.
In December, 1968, the company
will launch a new type of two-inch
structural polyurethane board, which,
although competing with Stramit straw-
board, will also open a whole new
market to the company. The new
board has a weight of per cubic
foot compared with 231 b. per cubic foot
for the Stramit board. Although the
polyurethane board will be slightly
dearer than the traditional Stramit
product, final installed cost, taking
labor as well as materials costs into-
account, will be cheaper. The light-
weight board is expected to be popular
with the home handyman. At present
only about 8-10 percent of the com-
pany’s sales are to the domestic build-
ing market.
At $l.ll the shares show a dividend
yield of 5.6 percent and the price earn-
ings ratio is 8.4. The shares are worth
buying at this price.


Mining
AOG in the Sydney Basin
IT SEEMS CERTAIN that Australian
Oil and Gas Limited’s forthcoming
wells, to be drilled in the Sydney Basin
north of Windsor, will attract a high
level of interest; and this not only from
shareholders or possible shareholders but
more particularly from the Australian
Gas Light Company and Planet Oil, as
well as BHP and Esso.
For although Australian Oil and Gas
has drilled several holes in this basin
over the past thirteen years all with-
out success the potential of the area
still exists, especially in view of the
possible markets for natural gas which
-exist within its boundaries. Should
commercial quantities of gas be found
there would have to be a reassessment
of the links between Planet Oil and the
Australian Gas Light Company in the
far west of New South Wales, and any
plans for piping BHP-Esso’s gas in Vic-
toria to Sydney would also take on a
different complexion.
AOG’s very first hole was drilled in
the Sydney Basin, at Kurrajong Heights,
in 1955. It was suspended due to drill-
ing difficulties.
Since then it has carried out extensive
surveys, both seismic and gravity, as
well as detailed stratigraphic surveys
and photo-geological work, and has
drilled further wells in order to assess
the potential of the basin. That this was
rated highly is evidenced by the very
active drilling program which the com-
pany undertook during 1963 and 1964
in and around Sydney itself. Fifteen
holes were sunk, so'me as close as Fair-
field and St. Marys, while others were
drilled at Camden and near Singleton.
Almost all of these wells encountered
significant traces of hydrocarbons, but
>( unlike BHP-Esso) these did not turn
out to mean commercial deposits of
petroleum. The Cecil Park No. 1,
drilled in June, 1964, almost at the city
“gate,” four miles west of Fairfield,
yielded a flow of natural gas at a rate
of 200,000 cu. ft. per day in open-hole
tests. But the flow decreased and after
sustained testing in 1965 had to be
abandoned as non-commercial. The
gas in ithis well was from a. depth of
2026 ft. The Badgelly No. 1, five miles
east of Camden, which was drilled in
August, 1964, encountered flows of
natural gas between 1199 ft. and 1251 ft.
From several intervals the combined
flow reached only 100,000 cu. ft. per
day and this well, too, proved to be
non-commercial. Both of these wells
established near-commercial quantities
of gas, but flow rates were uneconomic
due to extremely tight reservoir sands,
and attempts to stimulate them by
acidising and fracturing were un-
successful.
Perhaps the company’s most hopeful
result has come from the Camberwell
No. 1 well drilled late in 1965 five miles
west of Singleton. A drill-stem test of
the interval 2400 ft. to 2471 ft. gave cores
containing sandstone with a petroli-
ferous odor and stain with bleeding oil.
Here again the formation was tight and
lacked sufficient porosity and permea-
bility.
The information provided by seismic
work as well as the results of drill holes
has established thait the deepest and
most significant part of the Sydney
Basin appears to be in the area north of
the Hawkesbury River, where there are
considerable problems of terrain and
access despite the proximity of the area
to major centres like Singleton and
Sydney. Seismic work has been slow
and difficult, but by the end of 1966
the company was in the position of hav-
ing completed all the major surface
mapping and seismic survey work
needed to arrive at a minimum drilling
program necessary to fully assess the
potential of the Basin.
The first well in this program, the
Martindale No. IA, was drilled in the
north-west part of the Basin, 25 miles
south-west of Muswellbrook, early in
1967. It was plugged and abandoned
at 3878 ft. in volcanic basement with-
out encountering significant hydro-
carbons.
The three wells to be drilled in the
coming months are all to be drilled to
about 4000 ft., rather deeper than most
of the earlier wells drilled closer ito
Sydney. The company’s geological
adviser has said that the small number
of deep wells drilled to date is
inadequate to test the Basin, and the
results of the forthcoming holes should
therefore be most significant.
THE STATUE of Paddy Hannan was
polished up last week while Kalgoorlie
celebrated the 75th anniversai'y of his
finding of gold. But the main interest
in the town was up Hannan Street and
around the corner by the Palace Hotel
to where the stock exchange prices are
posted. It’s still called the Goldfields,
but this part of the world is winning
new fame as the hub of the nickel
belt.
As it was 75 years ago, the town was
full of prospectors. Then they had
left the Bendigo fields and the depres-
sion and often their wives and chil-
dren to seek out the gold. Paddy
Hannan was one of these, an Irishman
who had followed the gold rushes in
New Zealand and Victoria. Bayley and
Ford had made the West the new lure
for men like him at Coolgardie, “The
Old Camp,” where men walked 'more
than 100 miles through the red bush
with everything they owned on their
barrows in front of them.
But Paddy Hannan went beyond this,
and when he returned with his saddle-
bags bulging with lOOoz. of gold, the
rush farther inland was on to Hannan’s
Find (the name Kalgoorlie came from
the shrub galgurli). In the rush were
two South Australians representing a
syndicate on a lease then called The
Boulder; their coinpany set up on Han-
nan’s Find was called Great Boulder.
The prospectors of today are of a
different breed. Most of the 2500 nickel
seekers represent more than 100 com-
panies, ranging in size from giants to
the get-rich-quick syndicates; they are
corporation prospectors whose comings
and goings are watched as closely as
ever were those of the gold prospectors
75 years ago. This is the reason so
many Goldfields people are so inter-
ested in the board near the Palace
Hotel.
The United States Congress, cursed
for its unwillingness to place a more
realistic price on gold, is probably the
direct cause of the current nickel boom.
The inevitability of this can be traced
back to the philosophy of the late Mr.
W. S. Robinson, who set up Western
Mining Corporation in 1933 as a gold-
prospecting organisation with a differ-
ence; instead of using the methods-
Paddy Hannan and his successors had
used, the new corporation used every
scientific aid available to it. This worked
well with gold until the squeeze between
a static price and a rising cost of pro-
duction made it no longer economic.
But about 1954 Western Mining were
willing to loqk to minerals other than
gold. With their accent on scientific
exploration, they have built up a com-
prehensive geological picture of the
area, which has now become invaluable
to them, and has put them at least two
years ahead of their nearest rivals.
Despite conviction of some of their
employees that base metals existed, it
was a tremendous task to persuade
investors in what, by then, was a
poor but respectable organisation
that exploration was worth while.
The reason for this can be seen in
the history and geology of the gold-
fields. Gold has been a way of life, an
obsession, for 75 years. The topography
of the country does not make prospect-
ing easy. It is generally flat with few
outcrops of the signs that are now so
eagerly sought by geologists. The sample
that led to Kambalda was found a
staggering 17 years before it was taken
to Western Mining, and only then be-
cause it was thought to contain uranium.
It was another two years before the
investors could be persuaded to put up
the money, to drill into what geologists
believed would be nickel sulphides.
If such an attitude seems hidebound
in retrospect, it was completely logical
at the time. How in 75 years of close
prospecting could anything significant
have been overlooked? The answer to
this is that it was overlooked by men
obsessed by gold, as men on the gold-
fields have been since the days of Paddy
Hannan.

THE LAND
In defiance of equalisation
A FEDERAL MINISTER was hard
put to it at question time the other
day to think of a rural material or com-
modity whose Australian price was
lower than the price ruling on the world
market. Failing all others there was
one case of cheese as sold at home and
abroad by the Melbourne firm Italiano
Cheese, which, When asked why it would
have nothing to do with the dairy in-
dustry’s equalisation scheme, explained
that, if it did so, it would have to raise
its domestic price and so go against
its long established policy of keeping
it the same as its export price. With
this product, and most other rural ones,
obviously the home price is no more
nor less than what men in concert
choose to make it. Italiano Cheese can
be considered the exception and not
the rule only in the sense that all other
primary producers seem to consider
themselves robbed by their customers on
the world market, whereas, apparently,
it does not.
Italiano’s open defiance of equalisa-
tion, which all local consumers will
applaud, should be an object lesson to
the Federal Government at this crucial
time, when, as custodian of consumers’
interests, it is seeking to strike a balance
between these interests and the under-
standable desire of wheatgrowers to
maximise their incomes under stabilisa-
tion arrangements. These, as any estab-
lished or prospective beneficiary of
stabilisation naturally construes them,
are largely an exercise in making up to
the swings of the home market (through
rigged prices) and the taxpayer
(through subsidisation of stabilisation
funds) what these days is most likely to
be lost on overseas market roundabouts.
Washing dirty stabilisation linen in
public is understandable at the moment,
as defenders of the faith are put on the
spot by producers and Governments
alike. So you get a spokesman of the
Italiano subsidiary (the Perfect Cheese
Co.) involved in the “blacklegging” of
dairy products equalisation, taunting
the Victorian Dairyfarmers’ Association
with the suggestion that the scheme
practically obliges local cheesemakers to
dump their products on overseas mar-
kets, and the Association calling all
farmers to close their ranks. In its
Journal, VDA not only exhorts its mem-
bers to support stabilisation; it has also
warned them that any farmer who
supplies any company that is not a
party to the equalisation scheme that
he must accept responsibility for help-
ing to endanger the stability of his own
industry by such supply. In a text
worthy to be hung on any cowshed
wall, farmers are rerpinded in un-
equivocal terms by the Association
exactly what the scheme means for
them.
It runs: “Equalisation assists the
industry in many ways, such as the
pooling and distributing of home and
export returns for butter and cheese;
the distribution of the Commonwealth
butter and cheese bounty; the main-
tenance of supply to meet in full the
domestic requirements of the Australian
public for butter and cheese. Without
equalisation, there would be no possi-
bility of a continuation of the present
Government underwriting which ensures
a reasonable commencing level of
values each season.”
Against this hot gospelling, what the
future holds for Italiano Cheese is
problematical. Unless it toes the Asso-
ciation’s line it seems more than likely
to lose some of its cream as an invest-
ment. In the meantime the wheat-
growers, who are now on the brink of
possible vital changes in stabilisation
arrangements for their industry, have
been gathering statistical support
where they may, even at the Bureau
of Agricultural Economics, for their
final stand in front of the Government’s
apparent determination to replace the
cost of production formula which has
served them so well. Some of the
powder taken by the Australian Wheat-
growers’ Federation from the Bureau,
for instance, has been lifted from its
Director, Mr. D. M. Mackay, himself.
The claim is that since its beginning
wheat stabilisation has cost Australia’s
wheatgrowers a conservative estimated
loss of $316 million. The loss is said
to result from the long early period in
the scheme when wheat was selling
well in excess of the Aus-
tralian domestic price in other words,
farmers were denied bountiful overseas
returns from a large part of their crops
in order to provide cheap bread and
feed in Australia. As a matter of fact,
Mackay’s estimate for these imputed
stabilisation losses are regarded far too
low by two University of New England
economists, J. H. Duloy and A. S.
Watson, who have researched the sub-
ject. On the other hand, they can hardly
be taken as an argument for bleeding
Australian consumers of wheat for the
next five years in the cause of increasing

Putting pets on proper diets
IF YOU KEEP a snake at your place,
do take care to feed it some fur or
feathers. It will get indigestion if you
don’t; and no one wants a “snaky”
snake about the house. Normally, snakes
dine only on small, live animals, but
will live happily on strips of beef or
mutton provided they get fur or feathers
for dessert. This is only one snippet of
helpful advice that pet-lovers could
have gleaned from a veritable potpourri
of information released at the recent
conference of the Australian Veterinary
Association held in Hobart.
Other creatures rating special men-
tion at the meeting apart from the
inevitable cats and dogs were tor-
toises, wombats, possums, kangaroos,
mice, ferrets, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and
racehorses.
Feeding standards for draughthorses
were clearly established through con-
trolled experiments supervised by our
Departments of Agriculture many years
ago, when work horses were important
in farm economics. However, when Mr.
J. M. Bourke, veterinary consultant to
the Victoria Racing Club, wanted to
become acquainted with feeding
standards for racehorses, he found he
simply couldn’t look up the information
in a textbook. Consequently, he carried
out a survey of the feeding practices
currently in vogue in 45 racing stables,
He has found that the usual rations
fed to thoroughbreds in training are
generally deficient in calcium, salt,
and possibly iron and cobalt. He
attributes much of the lameness and
many of the spontaneous fractures that
occur in apparently sound horses to the
l ac k of these minerals. All horses in
training should be given at least half
an ounce of ground limestone or calcium
lactate and up to two ounces of common
salt with their feed each day during
warmer months. He was also sui-
prised to discover how rarely vitamin
preparations are offered, and feared that
most horses, young and old, may not
be getting enough protein concentrates
for growth or body maintenance. The

cereal grains and dry roughages usually
supplied in the stables are deficient in
certain vital amino acids, notably
tryptophane, histidine, and cystine. To
get enough of these, the diet should
include a goodly proportion of lucerne
meal, cotton-seed meal, or skim-milk
powder.
These several dietary essentials are
relatively expensive and their provision
at optimum levels would cut into the
profits of the trainers — a pretty mean
bunch apparently. Most stable diets are
very monotonous. If trainers took the
trouble to mix and vary them often, the
cost of feeding would rise somewhat,
but the need to supply the more expen-
sive supplements would be avoided.
At the opposite pole, tortoise fanciers
should also watch out for lack of
calcium in the diet of their charming
charges. Cracking of the shell denotes
this deficiency.
Veterinary practitioner Miss J. H.
Edols, of Mosman, N.S.W., instructed
the conference about the problems of
unusual pets. She mentioned that
wombats make affectionate pets, but
beware of the nursing female. She may
attack suddenly out of concern for her
offspring, which is carried in the pouch
until December after mating in March.
Wombats are generally robust and
healthy creatures, more likely to fall
victim to motor accidents than anything
else except old age.
Possums, too, can be readily tamed.
Their main hazards are dogs and cats.
Miss Edols dropped a handy hint for
people having to rear young possums
and kangaroos. Simply feed them on
undiluted canned milk from the
grocer’s; its composition identifies fairly
closely with the rich, natural milk of
marsupials. Kangaroo milk, for instance,
has a fat content of 16 percent and total
solids up to 35 percent, including 16
percent protein. Remember that kanga-
roos, like sheep, can carry hydatid cysts.
They are also prone to coccidiosis and
stomach worms. Warning: do not
attempt to eradicate their external para-
sites with DDT, which is toxic to kanga-
roos. Adult kangaroos need long, coarse
grass rather than pasture.
Mice are also sensitive to DDT.
Unlike almost all other animals, in-
cluding even cats, mice do not need
green feed in their diet. Cats kept in
high-rise flats, on board ship, and in
other such odd places where they
haven’t a chance to chew some grass
occasionally need special arrangements.
The owner should try to grow some
grass from birdseed in pots in his
quarters. Guinea-pigs get scurvy unless
given plenty of green feed.
Lest it be supposed from all this that
the conference ignored the more
common pets or, indeed, such important
animals as sheep and cows, we hope
to be able to continue this account next
week.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Adding music to three R's
Madina music to three R's
by KENNETH ROBINS
SIR KENNETH CLARK has said that
even under ideal conditions we cannot
expect more than two percent of the
community to have a genuine apprecia-
tion of the fine arts. Although this dis-
maying dictum was based on a survey
connected with the actual appreciation
of painting, Sir Kenneth is not the type
of pundit to apply specific findings
generally without good reason; so if he
used the term “fine arts” he obviously
thinks the findings of the survey would
apply equally to music, poetry et al.
Undeterred by such evidence, the
Education Department of New South
Wales makes music a compulsory sub-
ject under the Wyndham scheme for
secondary-school cfiildren from first to
fourth form. Now this course is a far
cry from “singing,” which was the
class activity most adults will remember
from their school days.
The “core” course, as it is called to
distinguish it from the elective examina-
tion course, in music is, broadly speak-
ing, designed to achieve what Sir Ken-
neth regards as impossible for 98 per-
cent of the community. Education is
largely, however, a process of leading
horses to water, and if this process
assures that the two percent will experi-
ence something of magic and delight
then it has been worth it. If music had
no appeal whatsoever to the submerged
98 percent there would be little hope
for the “core” course as a whole, but
there are many outside the rarified
two percent who derive intense pleasure
from some aspect of what is, after all,
the most popular of the arts.
Most heads of schools in the past
regarded the singing class as a disaster
area, but as it came under the heading
of culture too few of them were game
to declare this activity an incentive
to riot. However, they need have no
qualms about getting fully behind the
‘‘core” course in music, for presented
with imagination and enthusiasm it can
be of genuine educational significance.
The more obvious pay-offs are
already to be seen; Noye’s Fluddes and
Madrigals, Messiahs and Magnificats
are blossoming in what was a musical
desert and it is quite extraordinary how
accurately and stylishly the youngsters
are handling vocal music which was
almost the province of professionals.
Naturally enough, instrumental music-
making in schools is still pretty primi-
tive, with the exception of some remark-
ably proficient recorder consorts; but
to hear youngsters get around some of
,„. , , .
the most florid vocal parts ever written
is most exciting.
However, it is in the classroom that
the most valuable work is done, for
it is here that the ait of listening must
be cu tivated. The spectacle of 30-odd
14-year-olds with their noses buried in
scores istenmg to a major work with
more concentration than their parents
aye achieved in a lifetime of concert-
constitutes a significant break-
t rough. .
All this sounds rather rosy, but
unfortunately the “core” course in many
schools in the State receives only token
implementation. Lack of trained staff,
inadequate facilities, heads of schools
who are unable to see beyond the three
R’s, and in some cases an excess of
thuggery among the students combine
to confine worthwhile efforts to pockets
in the educational complex. The
casualty rate among music teachers is
also rather high for they are, on the
whole, sensitive souls and the natural
philistinism of the young leaves them
bloody and too often bowed. Neverthe-
less, the course has 'been launched, has
been running for five years, and despite
the afore mentioned vicissitudes is
being accepted by increasing numbers
at the student level.
The present approach to music in
schools has received its share of criti-
cism but, as you can imagine, little
of it has emanated from premises like
•those of Sir Kenneth Clark. Our belief
that we can make silk purses out of
sows’ ears is taken for granted, and, in
fact, to admit the presence of sows’
ears at all is somehow un-Australian.
This attitude, that of desiring aesthetic
awareness in 98 sinners rather than two
righteous, must be the ideal in a system
where education is compulsory. It also
means, unfortunately, that the dimin-
ishing and largely discredited group of
educationists known as the “playway”
boys are enjoying an Indian summer in
the music field. The inordinate rever-
ence accorded to the act of creation, no
matter how puerile the result may be,
and the equation of the needs of
children with the desires of children
are two of the more disturbing features
which plague the “core” course as a
result of the activities of these benign
and well-meaning anti-intellectuals.
At the other end of the scale are the
medievalists and the neo-Neanderthals,
to whom no piece of music between
Machaut and Orff is either desirable
as study or worthwhile performing.
This is the group which is prone to go
on regarding as obvious aspects which
their pupils insist on regarding as highly
esoteric.
Between these groups lie the teachers,
who are doing the most admirable job
of all. Catholic in taste, adventurous,
efficient, and imaginative, they take the
best of all worlds and present their
material with a judicious mixture of
entertainment and instruction. They
don’t make the mistake of allowing
their embryo instrumentalists to play
vintage Mozart or Beethoven in public;
they encourage their charges to wallow
in Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov,
believing that passion, the hotter the
better, is something a healthy
adolescent understands and welcomes.
An educated man was once defined
rather wryly as a person who reads
Milton for pleasure. There can be few
such folk about, despite a century of
English in schools, but five years of a
sensible approach to music has already
been responsible for producing know-
ledgeable and aware listeners who are
still in their teens.
The opera season
Hope is with the singers
By JOHN CARGHER
ONE CANNOT associate the word
tradition with opera in Australia. It
means continuity growing out of
natural growth, something which is
found more often in the minor opera
houses of Germany, or Sadler’s Wells
in England, than the famous houses
like La Scala or the Metropolitan.
Once upon a time Vienna and Berlin
were houses of tradition, but time and
the star system have changed all that.
What hope, then, is there that any kind
of tradition can be created in a country
which, until recently, has relied on
scratch companies of overseas artists
assembled for limited tours?
There is much that can be criticised
about the management of the Eliza-
bethan Trust Opera Company, yet it
is beginning to create a tradition in the
one field where it matters most: singing.
The establishment of an orchestral


tradition is in sight, if the efforts of
Carlo Felice Cillario are any indica-
tion. The total absence of artistic
direction is regrettable. But the con-
tinuity of young voices which come
forth year after year bodes well for
the company’s future. It is easy enough
for overseas companies to experiment
with young singers from any and all
countries, including Australia. The
Trust’s attempts to do the same have
been notably unsuccessful and unneces-
sarily expensive, but there is no denying
that the supply of new singers from
the home front alone has been remark-
able in both numbers and in quality.
The success of the current season is
proof that continuity in an Australian
singing tradition is becoming a reality.
Let us forget the Stellas, the Col-
liers, the Gobbis. Let us forget even
the singers living in Australia who have
had overseas experience. Eliminating all
of these, there remains a core which is
as strong or stronger than anyone can
reasonably expect to find in a country
which has only one single outlet for
operatic talent. The black bass of
Donald Shanks has now been tamed
into a fine instrument, which could
hold its ow'n anywhere. The artistry of
Ronald Maconaghie has the polish and
versatility of some of the best European
singers, and the beautiful voice and
outstanding acting ability of John
Pringle in this, his first, season must
give pleasure to even the severest critic.
These three singers alone show that
what Australia can produce without
any outside help is comparable with
the best “local” artists any opera house
can produce anywhere.
They are backed by a whole series
of singers who, while perhaps not
destined for international stardom, are
certainly capable of producing the
tradition without which the current box-
office success of opera in Australia can
not be sustained. Reginald Byers may
not possess the most beautiful of tenor
voices, but anyone familiar with the
true state of tenor singing in the world
today will admit that this is a fine
voice awaiting only the honing of
experience. Maureen Howard’s clear
and admirably controlled soprano is a
tremendous asset and will remain so if
only the management will refrain from
pushing it into roles which are too
heavy. Janice Taylor has looks, person-
ality, and voice to match; she is an
ideal lyric soprano who can, and does,
also cover some coloratura roles. For
dramatic roles the company has Mary
Hayman, who more than makes up in
voice what she lacks in histrionic
ability.
Not one of these singers rates top
billing with the Trust. But, then, neither
did Gregory Dempsey, Jennifer Eddy,
Clifford Grant, Leonard Delaney,
Althea Bridges, Geoffrey Chard, and
dozens of others who are now helping
European theatres to carry on their
own traditions, not to mention Donald
Smith, Lauris Elms, and Neil Warren-
Smith, who are busy doing the same
for the Trust itself. It remains to be
seen whether the management is inter-
ested in encouraging this tradition,
which has inadvertently come into
being. Nobody will grumble with the
importation of box-office stars. But
reliance on the excellent singers avail-
able in operas suited to their individual
talents is preferable to the importation
of second-rate singers for operas which
can not be cast locally. It is to be
hoped that the Trust will learn the
lessons of this season’s secondary casts.
Gently dominant
By PHILLIP ADAMS
SATYAJIT RAY speaks as gently,
precisely, and reticently as he directs.
Just as he never uses a camera move-
ment or a clever edit for its own sake,
he wastes no words, making points
without embellishment. When he feels
a question has been answered, he sits
silently, waiting until you ask another.
No, the caste system has little
relevance in Bengal, and even less in
artistic circles. He finds it necessary to
explain to Western audiences that the
so-called “caste mark” is purely
decorative. On the other hand, religious
factionalism can be a problem and
there has been conflict between Hindu
and Muslim extras during the filming
of crowd scenes.
I asked him whether he shares the
cultural stage with any Angry Young
Untouchables and he laughs. “No, but
as a result of Alan Ginsberg’s stay in
India there is a group who call them-
selves the Hungry Young Men and
write beat poetry.”
He laughs again at the West’s pre-
occupation with Indian mysticism,
which he finds tiresome and absurd.
Did I remember the river bank in his
film “Aparajito”? Well, he couldn’t
film them there today. The holy men of
Benares have been dispossessed by
American hippies.
Yes, he’s aware that the trendy
critics reject him because he’s too
literary, too committed. Some have said
that his films look like UNESCO docu-
mentaries, that Westerners enjoy them
Because of a collective guilt complex.
He shrugs this off, confident that his
films are sufficiently realised in visual
terms, and scornful of the present pre-
occupation with formal tricks at the
expense of content. Thus he rejects films
like “A Man and a Woman” as being
empty-headed, and is bored by the
decadence of “Last Year in Marienbad.”
If the cineastes prefer the school of
empty gesture, that’s their funeral. The
pendulum may or may not swing back
to the directors with something to say,
but he himself will never impose showy
technique on a scene. Nor will he
increase his editing pace to conform to
Western .tempos. His films are, he
argues, contemplative, and they com-
pensate for lack of speed by subtlety.
Ray concedes that Luc Godard is a
true revolutionary who’s enlarging the
entire vocabulary of the medium. But
he has little sympathy for what Godard
is saying. He prefers the work of his
friend Truffaut for its greater integrity.
Bergman’s brilliance, like Fellini’s,
excites him, although he’s not interested
in his dbsessions. “It must he hard to
make films in the Scandinavian
countries. They’re so comfortable, so
lacking in social conflict. All they have
left are their neuroses.”
Influences? Among others, he
acknowledges John Ford, and Donskoi,
the creator of the immortal Gorki
trilogy. But he feels that he has been
more influenced by artists outside the
cinema the still photographer Cartier
Bresson, for example. Ray, a trained
commercial artist and graphic designer,
rarely writes scripts as such. Instead
he covers pages with diagrams and
scribbles, and works from a rough story-
board. He casts amateurs and profes-
sionals according to his instinct and
their appearance, post-synching all his
dialogue. And he prefers to direct his
actors “through the lens,” while oper-

Satyajit Ray. .. “the only way to make a film”


ating the camera himself. “That is im-
possible for an American director. The
unions wouldn’t tolerate it. For me it’s
the only way to work.”
He feels this technique is also largely
responsible for the economy of his pro-
ductions. Where a normal director
might shoot 20 feet for each usable
foot, Ray’s waste ratio is negligible. His
films cost no more than $50,000 to pro-
duce, and “all but two of my 17 films
have made a profit.”
He’s puzzled by the suggestion that
his films sometimes sentimentalise
poverty, and feels his social concern is
implicit in films like “Pather Panchali.”
No, he doesn’t feel that he should make
his films angrier. That would be self-
defeating. His way, his audience, and
influence grow steadily. In contrast, a
young director with more talent than
discipline has made some bitter films
which have failed to make any impres-
sion. In any case, if Ray was to make an
angry film, his subject wouldn’t be
poverty but Calcutta’s self-indulgent
youth who enjoy la dolce vita in an
environment created by the decay of
religion, tradition, and the nation’s
political bankruptcy. Ray is deeply
depressed by the state of the Congress
Party, and talks of the rapid and related
growth of both the population and the
Maoist Communist Party.
He admits to taking a calculated risk
with his next film, which, being made
for the world market, stars Peter Sellers
as a Bengali businessman. It’s a risk in
the sense that he expects the critics to
maul him for using Sellers. (“They’ll
;say I’m selling out.”) However, he
points out that Sellers’ notorious Indian
accent quite accurately mimics a cer-
tain Indian group, and that Sellers
spent some years living in India. “With
a good director he’s a wonderful in-
strument.”
Born to an artistic Bengali family 47
years ago, Ray still edits a children’s
magazine founded by his grandfather,
and last year published an award-
winning book of children’s stories.
He made “Pather Panchali” at week-
ends, while working in advertising be-
cause he was determined that some-
thing decent should be done in India’s
active but relentlessly quaint industry.
Now he dominates Indian cinema more
absolutely than Bergman does Sweden’s,
and while young critics sharpen their
knives on his reputation, no film-maker
offers any challenge to his position. But
Ray takes little comfort from his pedes-
tal. For one thing, he’s so lionised that
filming is becoming increasingly diffi-
cult. Whole trainloads of sightseers
follow him about the villages, ruining
scene after scene. Ray hopes that India’s
film school, established some years ago,
will find some talent among its 600
students. He also has high hopes for his
son, now 14.
After the interview Ray turns tables
and asks about our industry; he listens
sympathetically as I apologetically ex-
plain that it’s like trying to make films
in an underdeveloped nation.

COMFORTING IMAGES
IN TODAY’S airline advertising you’re
likely to find every jet-setting symbol
but an aircraft. Tired businessmen
undergo a lightning metamorphosis into
oriental potentates in the time it takes
■to fly to Tokyo, and hostesses invariably
are glamorous, cosmopolitan Florence
Nightingales. But the most important
thing is that everybody cares about your
comfort.
Humanity is everywhere. In fact, you
might be excused for wondering if an
aircraft is a machine at all and not
some magic carpet powered by a band
of angels. While it’s not always possible
immediately to differentiate between
the brand images of, say, PAL and
JAL, one is aware that they’re all intent
on getting you there comfortably.
Most persistent in putting their
creature-comfort message across are the
BOAG people, who recently installed
an improved seat in their aircraft and
launched a coincidental advertising
campaign titled “Up in Armchairs,”
which is characterised by a wide assort-
ment of happy people lounging in aero-
plane seats.
Nixon Compton, the Australian
agency in charge of the promotion,
says it was prompted by market research
which found that “people who had
flown overseas out of Australia in
Economy Class were particularly critical
of the lack of leg room under seats and
the distance between the seats, par-
ticularly when the passenger in front
reclined his seat.”
Phase 1 of the armchair advertising
campaign broke in Australia in April
of last year with such slogans as “Flat
out on the Pacific,” “Relax, it’s all
bunk,” and “Are you going to take that
lying down?” The campaign is now in
Phase 3 on the triumphant note of
“Everyone’s Up in Armchairs.” Adver-
tising’s palliatives for the social prob-
lems of the coming jumbo-jets are
awaited with interest.
DEATH OF 22 PROJECTS

THE WRONG "HURRAH"
WHEN WORD got around that John
Tasker was to produce “America Hur-
rah” for the New Theatre in Sydney
inevitably he got a phone call asking,
“Do you want any dancers?” Well,
“America Hurrah” does sound like the
next offering by Bill Orr at the Don-
caster Theatre Restaurant, so how was;
the caller to know it was, in fact, the
latest searing indictment of the Ameri-
can way of life from off-Broadway?
“America Hurrah,” which consists
of three one-act plays, is by Jean-Claude
van Itallie, and Tasker feels it is quite
unlike anything he has produced, or
even seen, before. He doesn’t want to be
ghoulish, but he does feel that recent
events have made now an even better
or worse—'depending on your point of
view—time to put it on.

DOCTORED DRAMA
GROTOWSKI is to actors what Cohn-
Bendit is to students, and the latest
Australian to go off to Poland to
worship at the shrine is playwright Jack
Hib'berd, a Melbourne doctor of medi-
cine.
Until recently Hibberd wasn’t inter-
ested in theatre. His models are Pinter
and Beckett, and his characters, often
of low intelligence, are the sort of
derelicts he dealt with and studied as
registrar to the alcoholism unit of St.
Vincent’s Hospital, Melbourne.
“I use these types,” says Hibberd,
“because they fit my themes. Just like
Antonioni has to use women to express
his ideas, because if he used men they’d
come out queer.”
He’s currently writing a play about
political commitment, which amuses
him, and another for Professor Robert
Quentin, which is his first com-
mission. As well there’s a piece coup-
ling Ned Kelly and Dame Nellie
Melba. This, Hibberd fears, will never
be produced in New South Wales be-
cause of the law of retrospective libel.
Hibberd often starts with a bor-
rowed idea. (“So did Shakespeare,”)
His plays will begin with a typically
Pinteresque crisis, such as the con-
tested ownership of a shabby room.
But as victimisation becomes violence,
there’s something awfully Australian
about its quality. Hibberd’s work is dif-
ferent, too, in its use of humor. “My
plays usually start off funny, but the
humor turns sour,” says Hibberd, with
understatement. Most of his plays end
in murder, and the murderers feel no
guilt.
The Old Tote had his three-act play
“White With Wire Wheels” under con-
sideration for some time; Jim Sharman
was very impressed with it and wanted
to direct it. But he’s yet to have it or
any other play professionally produced.
Looking very much the part (of the
playwright, not the doctor), Hibberd
is quiet, confident, and unquestionably
talented. He tends to be specially con-
spicuous in Melbourne, where most
intellectuals take theatre, if they take
it at all, with a grain of salt.


Art
Persistence wins
By ELWYN LYNN
John Cobum. Kym Bonython Gallery,
Sydney.
A LOT OF paint has flowed under the
brushes since the Sydney Nine of 1960,
now looking a little tired or desperate,'
thought John Coburn unworthy of
membership, and this dazzling show that
crowns his buoyant persistence reveals
how wrong they were, for Coburn has
those rare, inner resources of integrity
that adjust so productively to the winds
of change. Admittedly, he did not
weather ithe hurricanes of lashing,
action-painting so well, but his sense of
iconic form remained undamaged and
his shapes emerged, cleansed, to be
levitated in those contemplative spaces
that have 'become his brand image.
Naturally, the new abstraction influ-
ences his present exhibition of a new
tapestry, 19 canvases and 11 water-
colors, though much less so in the last,
which are the antithesis of the new
abstraction’s enclosed, opaque areas, for
Coburn here balances opacity,
liquescence, transparency, and palpable
color in a way that is found only in
recent Olitskis.
Superficially, the new Coburns might
resemble the work of Janet Dawson,
Schlicht, McGillick, Aspden, Ball, and
Leach-Jones, to name representative
practitioners, but Coburn is pursuing
what has engrossed him from his earliest
figurative paintings of the late ’fifties:
he is after the singularity and isolation
of forms, their iconic discontinuity with
their surroundings; but at the same time
he wants to lessen the disjunction by
-enclosing forms in a balmy atmosphere
or by embracing them in an overall
rhythm. He does this, generally, in two
ways: he isolates and floats discs, ob-
longs, triangles, ovals, and crescents in
glowing, or deadpan, dun hues in an
encompassing, beneficent, almost sopor-
ific, void of the most delicious color,
usually just inflected enough to make
it waver or palpitate. This is his familiar
methbd, exemplified in Africa II (68 x
"92in., $2000), where, on lambent red, he
.sets adrift a light brown decapitated tri-
angle, a symmetrical leaf-form, a black
column, and an orange disc
over another decapitated brown triangle.
These simple ingredients advance, re-
treat, expand, or stand sullenly still,
poised, as it were, before an act of
revelation.
Before I discuss his other method of
-rhythmical cohesion of disparate shapes,
I must note what happens when he
grows impatient with what he suspects
as too bland, effusive, and seductive, and
sharpens the rhythms, silhouettes, and
colors as in ACE II (60 x 60, $1000),
where red cuts in on a sharp green
foliate form. The color is too unrelent-
ingly flat and the rhythms too staccato
for the Coburn serenity to calm the
conflict.
His greatest triumphs now come from
his concentrating and crystallising the
rhythms in single bands of undulating
color or in concentric bands in part
ovals and semicircles. Trajectory (60 x
124, $2500) is a blazing-red canvas
where a blue band flows from the left
to swerve out the top just before it
meets a free-wheeling black oval on
the right; it ought to be about Gestalt
tensions and Freudian encounters of the
oval and the rod, and so it seems from
the sketch I’ve made, but the happy
color and the slow, sweet pressures of
the red on band and oval are about the
non-psychological life of forms; it’s no
use reaching for a tract on perception
theory.
It’s the growth and varied pace of
such surging ribbons that fascinate: their
genesis, their poise, and sudden rush to
conclusiveness. This is best exemplified
in Mosque (60 x 72, $1200), a local
masterpiece of the late ’sixties. On a
pearly ground, a giant M, balanced on
the bottom edge, curves its way around
a rich, matt blue. The black band
squeezes the blue at the peaks of the
M, but the hollow, or valley, between
is a shallow, smooth, drooping curve,
luxuriously tired, yet is so essential that
it prevents the legs of the M from run-
ning out of the bottom, and gives the
blue and the painting both an
aggressive and vulnerable look.
Elsewhere he carries discontinuity
further. Input (60 x 70, $1400) bands
a white oblong with green and orange
on the left, while a black curve and a
pale blue moon drift across the remain-
ing white area; it works with greater
eclat in Power Game (60 x 120, $2500),
where a similar band meets, halfway
across, a horseshoe of bands of red,
white, and blue on golden ochre. Such
works are almost two paintings, but the
rhythmical cohesion makes true dip-
tyches of them. Maybe he is a little
over-concerned with such dichotomies
and in Jackpot (60 x 60, $1000), which
owes something to the earlier Gottlieb
and to Vasarely, he divides the canvas
into nine squares each with a disc, Arp-
shape, and so on. Color is strained to
avoid discordance in shape, but it proves
what a consummate colorist Coburn is.
Moving Geometry (60 x 102, $2000),
which has a triangle and horseshoe
bands leaving the edge of the painting,
as in Mosque, indicates new areas and
problems for Coburn to investigate: it
sounds banal enough, but it’s about life
at the periphery of a painting and should
be no trouble to Coburn.

Abundance at St. Kilda
By PHILLIP ADAMS
NEXT TO Captain Marvel, my
favorite comic-strip character was
Donald Duck’s miserly Uncle Scrooge,
who used to hoard his money in a huge
room and then, ecstatically, swim in it.
One feels much the same abandonment
wallowing in the cinematic abundance
that Erwin Rado has packed into the
St. Kilda Palais.
The festival began with Ray’s “Kan-
chenjungha” film in the hill station of
Darjeeling. All the rage under the raj,
it is now a sort of staid Surfers Paradise
shared by impecunious office staff and
an affluent elite. In this whimsical loca-
tion, still haunted by a few absurd
Britishers, Ray weaves together a
number of plots. The action takes
place in actual time, and while the
film isn’t a major work, Ray blends
and resolves the stories with his usual
elegance and compassion and a
humor we haven’t seen before.
Set in a grim boarding school before
World War I, young “Toerless” is a
heavy Germanic job based on Robert
Musil’s highly regarded novel. Intended
to depict the psychological environment
that made Fascism inevitable the
film is engineered as solidly as a
Mercedes. But it is thoroughly detest-
able in the way it relishes the prolonged
sexual degradation and physical torture
of a weak student. I see the thematic
point quite clearly but am deeply sus-
picious of the director’s probity.
Russia's "In the Town of S” is a
likab)e ad apation of an ironic Chekhov
concerning an earnest, awkward
doctor who, rejected by his
dream w d ates a J larmin rf y xhe

Despondency
at Rose Bay
by BEVERLEY TIVEY
I CAN’T say that this was the
cheeriest of festivals, from the point
of view either of location or of choice
of films. Not that I’ve anything against
the Rose Bay Wintergarden it’s
reasonably comfortable, well-heated
(indeed, overheated), the projection
machinery doesn’t break down, and
viewing conditions are generally good
(but look out for those posts in the
back stalls).
But the fact remains that it’s in
Rose Bay, a charming: district (with
easy parking), but difficult of access
if, like me, you happen to live on the
wrong side of the tracks. “Most of the
critics live in the Eastern Suburbs,” I
was informed by one of the Festival
Committee when I ventured a mild
complaint. Still, I expect there are a
good many film enthusiasts even in the
wilds, who may be discouraged by the
thought of getting to Rose Bay practi-
cally every evening and then even
worse getting home again after-
wards.
The general tone of the movies shown
was despondent: their concern with
misery and death (preferably violent
and self-inflicted) reached its peak in
Bresson’s “Mouchette,” in which one
woe trod upon another’s heels. The
14-year-old heroine, after glum
encounters with poverty, tuberculosis,
alcoholism, and rape, finally drowned
herself. She wasn’t even very efficient
at that. Nobody actually died in “Young
Toerless,” but I wouldn’t have cared
much if they had. I’m no Pollyanna,
but something nice must happen some-
time.
For this reason I was all the more
grateful for the nostalgic frivolity of
“Judex,” and the mild, humorous
observation in Satayajit Ray’s pleasing
but unimpressive “Kanchenjunga.” The
savage comedy of “How I Won The
War” had to me much more impact
than the deliberately mournful films;
Jiri Menzel’s “Closely Watched
Trains” skilfully blended humor and
tragedy.
The short features mercifully not
too many to each program were, in
general, more notable for solid worth
than originality. Films like “The Sum-
mer We Moved to Elm Street” (Canada)
and “Opus” (Great Britain) were care-
fully composed, meticulously observed,
and added up to very little.
There were enough worthwhile
movies to make it a fairly rewarding
festival (though I’ll never know how
“Paranoia” made the grade). But I’d
like them to make it a bit jollier next
year.

THE AVOCADO'S COME
A LONG WAY
SINCE THE AZTECS
THE AVOCADO first became known
to Europeans through a description
published in 1519 by one Martin Fer-
nandez de Enciso, who had seen the
fruit in Colombia as he coasted along
the shores with one of the first Spanish
expeditions to South America.
Its original name is thought to be a
sound substitute for the Aztec ahuacatl
. . . and, either because it was difficult
to pronounce or because of its peculiar
skin, in Jamaica it became known as
an “alligator” pear. Although widely
cultivated in tropical America before
the Spanish conquest, it didn’t receive
serious horticultural attention until about
1900, when it was found that a more
uniform fruit and yield could be
obtained by grafting. Now there are
several hundred varieties obtainable
throughout the world, and each variety
has adapted itself to its local climate.
In Australia the most common
varieties are the small, dark, thin-
skinned ones the hardiest variety,
rich in flavor and of excellent quality;
the medium-sized ones, characterised
by a thick, woody skin, and the very
large ones, bright green in color and
full of flavor, though somewhat less
soft than the others.
Much has been said about hors-
d’oeuvre which provide something
beautifully fresh looking, and which will
at the same time arouse your appetite
and put you in a good mood for the
rest of the meal. The avocado will
painlessly (for the cook) achieve just
that. Halved and sprinkled immediately
with fresh lemon juice (to retain the
color), it can be served with a variety
of dressings. It is certainly one of our
most delicious salad fruits.
But, please, do resist the temptation
to serve it on a bed of wilting lettuce
with a blob of mayonnaise nothing-
can be more off-putting. The place for
wilted lettuce is the dustbin, and not
the hors-d’oeuvre plate.
One of my favorite dressings for the
avocado is a french dressing prepared
with oil and red-wine vinegar, a sliver
of pounded garlic, salt, and plenty of
freshly ground black pepper. I might
even add a sprinkle of finely chopped
parsley. Once prepared, I serve it
separately, so that guests may help
themselves to the dressing.
If you wish to serve avocado with
seafood as your starter, don’t stuff your
seafood straight into the halves. Instead,
scoop out the pear with the small end
of your apple-corer. Sprinkle the little
balls of avocado with lemon juice, cover
with plastic, and place in the
refrigerator.
Clean up the avocado shells and
chill thoroughly in the freezer. Mean-
while, prepare your crab or lobster with
a first-rate dressing either vinaigrette
or mayonnaise thinned with a little dry
sherry place into a bowl, cover, and
leave to mature in the refrigerator.
When ready for dinner, blend the
avocado with the seafood gently and
quickly, and fill into the chilled shells.
Serve with hot toast spread liberally
with unsalted butter.
Equally interesting is baked avocado
with crab. For four people you will
need two large avocados. Prepare one
pint of bechamel sauce, add two table-
spoons of tomato puree, and one table-
spoon each of grated onion and currv
powder. Fold into flaked crab meat and
heat but do not allow to boil.
Halve the avocados lengthwise, and
score the flesh lightly with a fork.
Sprinkle with lemon juice to preserve
color, and pile high with crab-meat
mixture. Place into a baking dish, add
an inch of boiling water, and cover the
dish with foil. Then bake in a slow
oven for about 25 minutes. Serve with
garlic bread.
At home we are all dead keen on
guacamole. Spicy and piquant, it has
many uses. It makes an excellent dip
with a biscuit or firm potato chips for
a cocktail party, or with drinks before
dinner. And I am particularly fond of
serving it on hot toast fingers as an
accompaniment for home-made tomato
soup.
For six people one avocado is suf-
ficient but it should be at the stage
of being fully ripe, or even over-ripe,
but in that case discard the dis-
colored pieces. Halve and mash quickly
with a wooden spoon. Add immediately
the juice of a lemon. Mash one or two
cloves of garlic and add to the mixture
with a finely chopped onion. Season
with salt and freshly ground black
pepper. Add half a teaspoon of good
curry powder and sprinkle to taste with
tabasco sauce. Start off with four or
five drops and, if you can take it, add
more to taste but beware of over-
doing it for guests!
A very simple, but delicious, soup
can also be made quickly for six people
from one large avocado. Chop one
onion and a stalk of celery and saute in
two tablespoons of butter until tender.
Blend in 2 tablespoons of flour to make
a roux. Remove from fire and dissolve
two chicken stock cubes in two cups of
hot water. Add to the flour mixture
gradually, stirring constantly over
medium heat until smooth. Then add
a tablespoon of lemon juice, a table-
spoon of horseradish, a clove of crushed
garlic, a teaspoon each of curry powder
and salt. Finally, a dash of tarragon,
allspice, and some freshly ground black
pepper. Simmer slowly for no more
than five minutes.
Meanwhile, peel the avocado, mash
with a wooden spoon, and blend into
the soup. Add two cups of milk or thin
cream, and allow to warm through
but not to boil. Serve garnished with
crisp bacon crumbles.
And when they are plentiful, don’t
forget to put an avocado into salad.

A POKER GAME
THAT BECAME A
SIX-DAY WAR
By SAM LIPSKI
The Road to War. Walter Laqueur.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $7.40.
HANNAH ARENDT gave us “the
banality of evil,” now Professor Laqueur
offers us “the banality of history.”
Writes Laqueur: “Nasser stumbled into
it . . . Israel was unprepared and con-
ftised, Russian Intelligence was incom-
petent, and Russian judgment poor . . .
America was powerless to do anything
all this sounds too banal to be
generally accepted.” No conspiracies.
No grand plans. No ineluctable geo-
political forces. And hardly any secrets.
Israel and the Arabs went to war last
June without really wanting to go to
war. Events took over and acquired a
momentum of their own.
This approach of Laqueur’s comes
through in his summing up: “It began
like a standard scene in a Western. A
game of poker in a sleazy saloon . . .
the Arabs did not have enough money
for the stakes and should never have
played, still less issued a challenge . . .
indeed, this game should never have
taken place, but no one could withdraw
once the play had started.”
The rejection of a complicated view
of history is, of course, both reassuring
and frightening at the same time. It is
reassuring to feel that history is made
by human beings stumbling along, much
as we do, making decisions about war
and peace on the basis of rather
ordinary feelings like pride, fear, and
ignorance. Yet it is at the same time
more frightening than the bromide-like
determinisms of more complex explana-
tions.
One problem with an account of a
crisis which comes out less than 12
months after the event is that it can
easily say, as Laqueur certainly does,
that future revelations are not going to
change the picture very much. Laqueur
insists quite strongly that the develop-
ments which lead to the June war are
generally matters of public record. Thus
he tries to guarantee us in advance that
liis view will not become obsolescent,
that it will not be replaced with a new
model when the 50-year ban or the 30-
year ban (or whatever ban applies in
the Middle East) is lifted and Cabinet
minutes, diplomatic exchanges, and
other documents are made public.
All you can say to that is, perhaps
he is right; certainly his view is lucidly
expressed, backed with authoritative
evidence in most cases and plausible
evidence in others. It is a view which
fits the facts as we know them. Besides,
Laqueur’s book is very welcome because
he writes with great skill and economy.
His factual account makes far more
dramatic reading than anything the
Leon Urises or the Morris Wests could
hope for.
Laqueur’s “poker game” can be sum-
marised briefly. The Syrians, impatient
at the continuing talk of liberation, had
become convinced that a combined
Arab attack on Israel would succeed
in destroying it, or at least result in
the kind of stalemate which eventually
forced the French out of Algeria. In
this view the Israelis were latter-day
colons, unwilling to defend a homeland
to the last man, but imperialists who
would scuttle once real force was
applied.
The Soviet Union encouraged this
view because they, too, misjudged the
Israelis (“Jews do not fight”) and
because their military intelligence was
poor. They also overestimated their
control over the Syrians and the
Egyptians. The early months of 1967
found the Syrian Ba’ath regime in
trouble, trouble which had little to do
with affy border clashes with Israel.
Israel’s General Rabin...the victory
was his, but not the kudos
But to strengthen the Syrian regime
the Russians used the false pretext of
Israeli troop concentrations to force
Nasser’s hand into a public commit-
ment, a show of support for the Syrians.
Other pressures had been building
up against Nasser and it suited him to
make a show of moving his brigades
into the Sinai Desert. In Laqueur’s view
there was no “deliberate warmongering”
by the Soviet Union. The Russians did
not want a war between the Arabs and
Jews. Things just got out of control.
As Nasser’s confidence grew, as his
prestige rose in the Arab world, he
became bolder. Convinced that the
Americans would not interfere, he
pushed his luck by blockading the
Straits of Tiran and bluffing a hapless
U Thant into removing the United
Nations Emergency Force. He pushed
his luck too far. The Israelis would take
only so much threatening and bullying.
The book is mainly concerned with
the three weeks beginning with May 15,
when the first reports of Egyptian troop
movements in Sinai reached Jerusalem,
and June 5, when the Israeli Air Force
destroyed Egyptian air power. Those
three weeks seem to have been over-
shadowed by the six days which fol-
lowed; the drama had shifted away from
the crisis and on to the military battles
and victory.
Laqueur reminds us vividly that the
crisis itself provides some fascinating
insights into the realities of international
affairs. The “impotence of power” was
not just a phrase in the crisis it was
very much a fact. The Russians had
supplied the Egyptians with billions of
dollars’ worth of arms; they had drilled
their staff officers in armored warfare
(rather badly, as it turned out), they
had put the pressure on Nasser to com-
mit himself; when it came to the crunch
they left him to ignominious defeat,
not so much because they wanted to
see him lose but because they found
themselves without much room to
manoeuvre.
The United States, for its part, urged
restraint on the Israelis, made vague
promises about getting international
support for a breaking of the blockade,
and tried to restrain Nasser, too. Israel
did not wait. Laqueur concludes: “Small
nations in critical situations cannot rely
on the big powers for help.”
Laqueur is particularly useful in his
description of the public mood and
political decision-making process in
Israel during the crisis. As he points
out, Israel’s victory has tended to make
many forget that the weeks leading up
to the war revealed an Israel unpre-
pared politically for the crisis. A. few
popular notions are examined and
debunked. Israel’s supposedly indecisive
Premier, Levi Eshkol, was, in fact, a
“hawk” inside the Cabinet, which was
split almost down the centre on
whether to go to war or wait. Nor was
General Moshe Dayan responsible for
military victory. The “architect of vic-
tory” and the man who should be get-
ting the kudos was General Rabin, now
Ambassador in Washington. Dayan
joined the Cabinet three days before the
war and had an important morale-
boosting influence but Laqueur
argues, quite reasonably, that he had
little influence on the military plans.
A couple of bonuses from Laqueur:
first, the picture of Egypt’s President
Nasser which emerges from the book
“a leader of immense shrewdness and
little wisdom,” a mixture of great quali-
ties and dangerous deficiencies. Second,
the Appendixes: these are not usually
given a mention in a review, but there
are 100 pages of very useful ones, in-
cluding tJ Thant’s report on the with-
drawal of the UNEF troops, Nasser’s
important speeches, and Israel’s Abba
Eban at the UN.

MARKO VERMOUTH
and 1869, for which reason many
readers will vaguely remember refer-
ences to him as an influence on the
young Henry Kendall, friend of Clarke,
Gordon, and George Gordon McCrae.
“A lesser literary lion,” the bookjacket
of Ann Blainey’s fine, full, and lively
biography describes him. He was also
and often a thorn in the paws of greater
lions, and during his long life (1802-
84) his acquaintance included so many
truly important people writers,
social reformers, politicians that this
full-scale presentation would be amply
justified even if its subject were dull
and Horne is far from dull.
Horne’s childhood and its traumas
were not unusual for his times but do
contain unusually clear clues to some of
his later preoccupations. Mrs. Blainey
has sensibly avoided quasi-Freudian
speculations a.t this point. Horne was
also a most peculiar-looking fellow
short, dumpy, deceptively and im-
mensely strong, who probably wisely
chose to enhance his oddities in High
Romantic fashion. Prematurely bald as
an egg, he framed his dome-like skull
with long auburn ringlets, and in his
youth added long drooping moustaches
to match. He played the guitar and
sang well even at a wild Australian
goldfield the guitar was heavily
ribboned.
Horne suffered another disadvantage
in that his formal education, though
conventionally adequate, was never
along his own lines of interest. He failed
Sandhurst in his first year and there-
after, abetted by a somewhat equivocal
friend called Charles Wells, taught him-
self all he thought he ought to know
for his consciously chosen role of poet.
He venerated Shelley and Keats. Haz-
litt, whom he never saw alive but whom
he viewed as a corpse, was his god.
Horne was no mere inactive wooer
of the Muse. He wrote prolifically as
a youth and delightedly grasped a
chance of adventure in 1825 when he
sailed as a midshipman in the Mexican
Navy at Vera Cruz. There he saw
action, endured squalor, nearly died of
yellow fever, was cheated of his pay,
and, in order to return to England,
worked, often as a laborer, in America
and Canada.
In London again, he wrote in many
forms poems, plays, novels, criticism,
and editing work, and he achieved
enough moderate success to give him
an entry into some of the liveliest circles
of his time.
For some years the centre of his life
was the house of William Johnson Fox
at Craven Hill. Fox, an editor, had an
eye for talent which had early discerned
Browning and Tennyson. At his house
the important issues of the day were
aired, from literary injustices to social
reform. “Though elsewhere the ideas of
Shelley and Bentham might be at war,
at Craven Hill all visitors were expected
to discuss poetry and Utilitarian reform
in the same breath.”
Here Horne met Mary Gillies, a
Scottish author who was to be the most
influential' woman, and one of the
kindest, in his life. For Horne had a
disastrously unerring ability to fall in
love with frigid females and eventually,
and unhappily, married one. Another
friend was Dr. Southwood Smith, a
pioneer of public health, through whom
Horne was appointed a sub-commis-
sioner on a Royal Commission investi-
gating the employment of children in
mines and factories. Horne’s published
report with its frank revelations of in-
human, bestial, hopeless conditions in
Staffordshire was disbelieved by some
people and found “offensive” by at least
one MP. Elizabeth Barrett, however,
transformed it into “A Cry of Factory
Children” and indirectly it made some
useful impact on a complacent society.
With Elizabeth Barrett, Horne long
corresponded both before and after her
marriage. Dickens was his friend, Leigh
Hunt also indeed, Ann Blainey’s book
should effectively dispel imputations of
being a mere “name dropper” which
have been made against Horne.
At last, in middle age, Horne wrote
a real poem, “Orion.” This work he
promoted with all the zeal of a 20th-
century advertising genius. “Orion” was
at first sold at a farthing a copy, one
copy only to a customer and none to
prospective buyers who mispronounced
its title. Success was sweet for a time,
and so was marriage to young, cold,
hero-worshipping Kate. Then Kate grew
up, life became stale, gold was dis-
covered in Australia and Horne escaped
to the antipodes.
In Melbourne Horne had a succes-
sion of ill-paid and often short-lived
jobs. He commanded a private gold
escort in a sort of swashbuckling fancy
dress brandishing very necessary pistols.
He was variously a Commissioner for
Lands and Gold Commissioner in sev-
eral rowdy, remote places, and Commis-
sioner for Water and Sewerage of the
new Yan Yean water supply!
He achieved fame as a swimmer;
misery as a lover and father of short-
lived babies; satisfaction from some of
his writing; disappointment and humili-
ation from efforts to enter Parliament.
He was often poor and sometimes des-
perately so and forced to beg aid from
English friends. But he was, neverthe-
less, compensated by the literary status
which Melbourne accorded him one
could wish that Ann Blainey had given
a fuller account of his friendships with
Melbourne writers and of the climate
of those times. Before he returned to
England in 1869, Horne was forced to
sell many of his long-treasured books
and pictures. A public auction brought
in £6O-odd for one of the most valu-
able lots ever offered in Australia.
In England, in his old age, Horne
received a Government pension
authorised by Disraeli, grew friendly
with young Edmund Gosse, championed
Swinburne, and retained his ability to

THE PRIDE OF SPAIN
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Spaniard and the Seven Deadly
Sins. Fernando Diaz-Plaja. Gollancz.
$8.15.
THERE IS nothing quite as enter-
taining as reading native on native when
the writer has a shrewd eye for the
foibles of his fellows and a lively pen
to record them witness Muggeridge
among the Anglo-Saxons and Luigi
Barzini’s “The Italians.” Now comes
Diaz-Plaja on “The Spaniard and the
Seven Deadly Sins,” all of which, if
one is to believe the author, he commits
cheerfully and religiously as a matter
of national pride and pride, of
course, as Public Sin No. 1, is accorded
place of honor in this survey, hogging
half the space.
Dr. Diaz-Plaja, a cosmopolitan
academic, has no illusions about his
compatriots, but he is not one of those
expatriates with some parochial double-
edged axes left over to grind, either. Flis
tone is drily understated, pleasantly
ironic, and completely devoid of any
form of insularity. By means of merci-
less verbal X-rays, pointed anecdotes
from daily life, and liberal quotations
from the greatest Spanish writers, he
builds up what is probably the first
fully rounded portrait of the Spanish
character at home that a foreigner can
understand and enjoy. .
For this reviewer personally, some of
of the more puzzling aspects of a pro-
fessional sojourn in the Iberian penin-
sula some years back and of the
hitherto inexplicable behaviour of
many characters throughout Spanish
literature suddenly became clear for the
first time. When, for instance, during
a festival, a party of late overdressed
patrons stamped into the Barcelona
■Opera House talking and laughing
loudly in the middle of a visiting com-
pany’s performance of “Twilight of the
Gods” (your reviewer being among
those on stage at the time), it was not,
as the guesting musicians then imagined,
lack of manners, education, or thought
for others, but according to Dr. Diaz-
Plaja simply an acceptable national
form of self-expression or a declaration
of individuality. And when the rest
of the audience hissed and shouted to
shut them up, this, too, was another
demonstration of independent thinking!
Every Spaniard, one learns, reserves the
right to be himself.
However, the louder and more
ferocious the bark, the rarer the actual
Spanish bite (see slo/h), and sloth
naturally does not need to be discussed
at length in the land that gave the
world “manyana,” the tomorrow that
never comes. All the Spaniard really
needs is to let off steam; the rest is
too much bother. Bullfights come under
the same heading: the Spaniard satisfies
his desire for blood-letting vicariously
in the arena, the bull becomes a uni-
versal sacrifice to purge bigger sins
which remain uncommitteed.
One of the most fascinating sections
(under pride) is the Spaniard’s attitude
toward his religion the phrase is
carefully chosen, religion is always
“his,” a piece of personal property. A
country that has spent centuries killing
all kinds of races, including its own, in
the name of the true faith can afford to
remain individualistic about worship at
home. Thus Spanish men, as the author
observes, are more likely to die in
defence of a church door than to go
through it. And' the said church door
will more often than not carry the
startling notice: “You are requested not
to spit, out of respect for the sacred
place.”
Likewise, when Pope Leo XIII pro-
claimed the unpopular bull “De rerum.
novarum,” dissenting Navarrese families
prayed seriously every night “for the
conversion of the Pope.” And when a
friend of the author heard that fasting
and abstinence had been dispensed with
on papal authority as a temporary war-
time measure, she refused to comply,
stating angrily, “Well, I shall go on
fasting. If the Pope wants to damn him-
self, let him do so.” (Footnote: every
Spaniard not only has “his” religion,
he also has “his” Pope, an image which
is not a copy but the original!)
The Inquisition, as Dr. Diaz-Plaja
points out, should not be condemned,
as it usually is, for its physical violence,
which was at that time universally prac-
tised, but for its intellectual torture
and brainwashing, which was not. It is
interesting to note, in passing, that our
advanced age has since caught up with
the Inquisition. However, the author
maintains, rather surprisingly, that
sadism, which he defines as a mental
attitude toward pain, is, in fact, totally
absent from the Spanish character and
that the national form of cruelty and
love for blood is almost “healthy,” as it
lies right at the surface, and being
freely indulged has no need to go
underground and take more devious
and, therefore, more sinister shapes.
This is one of the few places where
the reader may feel that the author’s
logic, too, is Spanish.
However, honor is also' a surface
affair: a husband would rather be
betrayed, in fact and in secret, than to
be thought a cuckold erroneously. By
the same token, if a man enters a
maiden’s room she has already lost her
virtue in the eyes of the world. The
deed becomes more or less irrelevant.
In this context, Donna Anna’s reaction
to Don Juan’s arrival through her
window, always one of the least satis-
factory moments, begins for the first
time to take on a glimmer of sense
(Spanish style, of course). This can
also be applied to the curious legend
of Margarita la Tonera and the Virgin:
our Lady, it now appears, was simply
being Spanish when she arranged for a
substitute to take the nun’s place in the
convent during a temporary absence
with a lover. What they don’t know'
won’t hurt them . . . and, of course,
Margarita repents, so it all comes right
in the end, in “Don Juan Tenorio.”
Lust is a prized Spanish possession,
together wdth virility, hence those
extravagant street compliments, “Who’s
going to make love to you, gorgeous?”
and other popular local forms of the
wolf whistle. And a quick warning to
female tourists: for a Spanish escort a
goodnight kiss is the 'beginning not the
finale. There is no end to the compli-
cated rites before the altar of mascu-
linity: even today cigarettes must be
held only in the left hand. Any man
w r ho holds one in the right is either
a homosexual or a foreigner.
All these sins are, of course, not the
prerogative of the Spaniard alone, as
much as he might like to annex them
for himself (see pride), but one must
admit on the author’s showdng that he
has achieved a flying start with most of
them and is constantly trying to repos-
sess the rest (see pride)! As a post-
script, one might add a typical story
sometimes heard in Spain which did
not find its w ? ay into this book. It con-
cerns twm wealthy noblemen w ; ho died
of starvation; they were in a doorway
and neither wmuld go through first.
Courtesy? No. The ultimate in inverted,
pride (see pride).

Rural exports
Your comments (8., May 25) on a
recent projection of mine in the March
“Economic Record” suggest that my
reasons for expecting a much lower
growth in rural exports in future were
presumably the fear of greater competi-
tion from synthetics and the expectation
of greater agricultural protectionism
overseas. In fact, however, two other
main reasons were advanced by the
agricultural economists on whom I
mainly relied for this part of the pro-
jection.
First, the past decade was, until
recently, marked by unusually good
seasons, whereas a medium-term pro-
jection can reasonably assume only
average seasons; moreover, even with
average weather .conditions, the recent
droughts will continue for a few years
to hold back the growth of wool output
well below its rate of the past decade.
Secondly, rural output has, over the
past decade, benefited greatly from the
high level of rural investment financed
by the high earnings of farmers and
graziers early in the period; whereas
recently their incomes have been very
much lower, and the level of rural
indebtedness is very much higher. The
consequent financial problems mean,
therefore, that the growth of rural in-
vestment, and so of rural output, cannot
be expected to be as great in future.
Thirdly, some agricultural economists,
at least, doubt whether in the coming
decade there will be technological
advances as important as the introduc-
tion of myxomatosis.
One might add that most observers
would wish to make some allowance
for the risk (greatly enhanced by this
month’s events in France) that Britain
will enter the EEC and that our food
exporters will consequently lose most,
or all, of their preferences in the British
market.

New Jews?
Sam Lipski’s article “A new kind of
Jew?” (8., March 16) sparked off a
controversy in the Jewish Press, aspects
of which spilled over into the national
Press. I should like it put on record
that while I have challenged his thesis
that there is a “new kind of Jew” and
his prototype is the Israeli paratrooper
rather than the rabbi and scholar, I
have most certainly neither said nor
implied that “Israeli paratroops are
‘militarists’ who live on blood.” What
I did say was something quite different,
that “there is no such thing as a ‘new
kind of Jew’: the Jew is eternal . . .
Only the fools, anti-Semites, and Jewish
self-haters ever suspect the Jew lacked
courage. It may take courage to be a
paratrooper; it can also be an escape.
But whatever courage it takes to be a
paratrooper, make no mistake: if the
choice is between living as a Jew, or
risking one’s life as one, the former is
the courageous choice.”

Fear of China
I have only recently seen Mr. Samuel’s
review, “China, in slick phrases” (8.,
April 20), of my book, “In Fear of
China.” If Mr. Samuel really believes
that I have said half the things he
says or implies I have said, he should,
in all honesty, regard me as silly rather
than slick.
He reports me as saying that China
has no security police. I, in fact, say
(page 13): “China does not appear to
have developed a secret police network
which could compare in size or power
with that of most other Communist
countries in earlier years.”
I am supposed to suggest that the
North Korean attack of 1950 was pro-
voked by the South. I had thought my
argument to be that while the North
Korean attack was probably planned in
advance, it was unlikely the Chinese
had instigated these plans.
I do not state that China’s action in
Tibet was “legally correct.” While Mr.
Samuel is quite justified in interpreting
my Tibetan argument in this way, he
should not quote me as saying some-
thing I do not actually say.
Similarly, Mr. Samuel is quite
entitled to reject my interpretation of
China’s behaviour, and to put forward
his own view that China harbors
nationalist ambitions. As evidence he
states that China has “border claims
against almost all neighboring
countries,” and that the Chinese had
published “various- maps,” including
“the famous Li Pei-hua map of 1960
showing Chinese boundaries extending
to take in all the mainland of South-
East Asia . . .”
In my book I quote the Chinese
Government as stating that it has settled
its borders with almost all neighbors.
It also so happens that the famous Li
Pei-hua map is none other than one
reproduced in my book (page 153),
with a translation of its legend stating
it to be a map of territory claimed by
China in the 19th century. I fail to
mention any other maps. Since my
apparent errors on these territorial
questions may be in part what Mr.
Samuel has in mind when he accuses
me of lack of intellectual rigor and
failure to document or substantiate
assertions, I was wondering whether he
could be persuaded to substantiate the
new and important information he has
produced?

the winemaker. A great sherry in the Mildara tradition of quality.
Here is a true, pale, delicate dry Sherry of Fino style. Mildara
