"THE BULLETIN” BOOK EXCHANGE.
On receipt at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal to the price stated (which is
published price with postage added), books in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australasian address.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
PHI. May’s Mustrated Winter Annual (Is
3d) comes to cheer the Australian summer.
The pictures are many and clever, and the
prose is up to the English short-story
average. In “ Fun, Frolic, and Fancy,”
by Byron Webber and Phil. May (Is 3d),
tbe pictures are fewer and the writing
duller.
The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table is
issued by Walter Scott in a cheap and
charming dress (cloth, 2s lOd) —an act of
homage which the manes of the dead
Autocrat, Poet, and Professor will doubt-
less appreciate.
The Goldfields of Westralia (cloth, Is 3d) is
a small handbook of W. A. mining, issued
by Barker and Co., a firm of London
brokers. The news and comment are now
mostly superseded, though the reader is
carried up to July of last year ; but there
are a big map and half-a-dozen sketch plans
of all the leading fields, which are well
worth the price.
Beenes from the Show (cloth, 2s. lid.) is
another collection of G. R. Sims’ stories,
written down to the level of the middle-
class English intelligence —weak in con-
ception and dull in treatment.
A» Introduction to Comparative Psychology,
by C. Lloyd Morgan (cloth, 6s. 6d), is the
latest volume in the “ Contemporary
Science Series.” It is interesting to the
student, but hardly fitted by treatment to
be a favorite (apart from the difficulty of
the subject). The increase of price beyond
the 4s. average has thus no special justi-
fication.
Gould’s Game of Draughts (cloth, 2s. lOd.)
is a handy little compendium of problems,
critical positions and games, which experts
and would-be experts will find one of the
best text-books published.
The Tales of John Oliver Hobbes (cloth, 6s.
6d.) now appear in a very nice edition,
worth buying “ for keeps.” The volume
includes “ Some Emotions and a Moral,”
“A Study in Temptations,” “A Bundle
of Life,” and “The Sinner’s Comedy;”
and comes with a piquant flavor of literary
olives very refreshing to the jaded palate.
J. O. H. has perhaps the most masculine
intellect among the notable woman writers
of the day, and her wit is of a Wilde-ish
deftness which none of her rivals can
approach.
The Manxman, by Hall Caine (cloth, 45.),
is republished in a cheap and readable
form, and can be recommended as a good
and powerful novel of the dramatic class.

engravings of N.S.W. scenery, shipping,

Medical.
The "KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, hut now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
eountry the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, In confident
assurance thiit its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “ Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In on® size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as bur
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
* CURED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkervllle, S. Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-

weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
r-JS
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything aui sleep

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the CutlCUra Remedies will, in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,
skin, and restores the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite skin beau-
tifier, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor
Remedies, cleanses the blood of all impurities and poisonous ele-
ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies
cure every disease and humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss
of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.
Au. about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-
tions,' and 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cu 1 icura Resolvent.

A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
Typhoid is raging at Five Dock, Sydney.
In other words, filth has come home to roost.
The Duke of Argyle is getting ready to
marry a third wife. The duke has done his best
to cheapen the distinction of being step-mother to
the Queen’s son-in-law, Lome, and that poor,
forgotten individual is said to deplore the nuptial
tendencies of his “old man” in a minor key.
This is how the British mercantile class
loves the British seaman. Runciman, the Tyne-
side shipowner, has lately been transferring
several ships to the Norwegian flag. Says he :
“ On a ship of 2000 tons burthen, I thus save <£C2
10s. in wages and <£lo on provisions per month.”
The band will now play “Ye Mariners of
England ! ”
The late Dueness of Montrose had a free
and independent tongue in any sort of company.
Once, when Albert Edward, trying to dissuade the
choleric old girl from scratching a favorite at the
eleventh hour, suggested that their Jockey Club
friends would not like it, she turned her back
on royalty, saying “The Jockey Club can go to —
Rockhampton 1”
From the S.M. Herald ! !
In a, Bookseller’s Shop at Brighton (Eng.). Lady:
“Will you give me ‘The Eloping Angels,’ by William
Watson?’’ Shopman: “I am sorry, madam, we have not
a copy left. Will you take the sequel to it, ‘ The Heavenly
Twins’ ?”
Shame !
Henry Yarley, tue loud-mouthed butcher-
evangelist, has come back to Australia. Yarley
used to be about the coarsest and most aggressive
of the evangelist type, and his addresses “tomen
only ” were among the steepest and most naked
things of their kind ever heard in this country.
Why is it that coarseness and a certain hunky

From Cheltenham (writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent by last mail) has just come
the news of the death of my old friend, Mr.
William Watson, brother of Mr. Geo. Watson,
Master of the Melb. Hounds. The late Mr. Wat-
son was a real specimen of an old Irish, or English,
sportsman, and seldom failed to put in an appear-
ance at the Cotswold meets. He was probably
the most popular man in Cheltenham, where
everybody admired and respected him. The
Watsons are a real straight-going lot of riders.
Another brother, John Watson, has been Master
of the Meath Hounds for over 40 years, and is
still hard to follow. A week or two ago he had
a nasty fall and his horse rolled on him, but
happily, barring a broken shoulder-blade, he is
not much the worse for his spill.
When a new Czar of Russia is proclaimed
the masses are promptly summoned to the nearest
police-station for the purpose of taking the oath
of allegiance. As soon as swearing-time has
elapsed the police start on a house-to-house
enquiry, and any person found trying to dodge his
duty is served with a blue notice paper, com-
manding payment of oath arrears within 24 hours.
The penalty of disobedience is a prosecution for
treason. Invalids, who can’t. take up their beds
and walk to the station, are made loyal on the
premises by a vigilant, inspector ; and in cases
where the subject happens to he dying and unable
to articukite, the inspector seizes the cold, limp
arm of the defaulting party and &wears him or her
in by proxy. Arraueement-f fur obtaining an all-
round allegiance are thoroughly* Russian in their
completeness. People are vaccinated, so to speak,
with loyalty to the new Czar, and get no chance
to plead hereafter that they didn’t “ take.”

Ihe soul of J. H. Angas, a South Austra-
lian squatter, is aching on account of two abori-
gines, the last survivinginhabitar.ts of a “station”
that lias been reappropriated by the local Grown.
They were shifted the other w.eek by Act of Parlia-
ment and the Act forgot to flnd’ariotherreslingplaoe
for them. “ The case of these two primeval lords of
the soil is truly one with a barren and hopeless
outlook, and considering the dispossession of
their race, it certainly not only savours of, but
is sheer inhuman,” says this eloquent squatter in
a letter to the local Advertiser. In a sad, re-
proachful tone of voice, Mr. Angas calls upon the
Government to allow his dark and lonesome breth-
ren to choose a block of. the land which is “their
heritage,” where they may live in peace and
security. The Bulletin begs to support the
squatter’s touching appeal. One of the richest
bits of country in South Australia is a trifle of
15.000 acres at the back of Melrose, and J. 11.
Angas figures as the nominal owner of it. He has
another 45,000 acres close handy, but this is land
on which he raises cattle and rents and other
useful things. The smaller block is merely unoc-
cupied soil waiting to be picked up by the first
primeval lord who comes along. Squatter Angas
bought the property from the Crown that stole it
from the blacks, but on his own showing he stands
in the position of a man who buys the proceeds of
a robbery at a ridiculously low price. He took
the risk of a claim for restitution from the rightful
owners, and the blacks aforesaid, being the rightful
owners of Angas’s earth, ought to have those
15.000 neglected acres handed back to them at
once.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 19, 1895.
A Financial Nightmare.
The Victorian Legislative Council has acted,
in the country’s dire emergency, as every-
body who knew it well foresaw that it would
act. The Land and Income-tax Bill was
thrown aside by an almost unanimous vote,
the Governinent representative forming a
lonesonie minority of one in favor of the
measure. Victoria, as the Council is fully
aware, is just now in the direst straits that
province has yet experienced!. The revenue
has "fallen off, in five years, from nearly
£10,000,000 per annum to considerably less
than £7,000,000. To cover the ever-
acfcutnulating. deficit successive Treasurers
have borrowed all the available trust-funds
—some £4,000,000 or more —and it is prac-
tically' impossible to raise any more tem-
porary loans froin this source without com-
pelling the Savings Bank to stop payment.
Retrenchment has been practised on an
enormous scale till there is hardly anybody
left to retrench. The interest on the public
debt has been provided only by the hard
expedient of postponing payment of many
of the country’s just debts, on the under-
standing that the arrears would be liquidated
when the returns from the land and income
taxes began to come in. As Premier Turner
truthfully stated, the province is on the
verge of stopping payment—in fact, unless
some source of income can be foundapart from
the ordinary revenue, Victoria, apparently,
must file its schedule when the next half-
year’s interest to the English creditor falls due.
The proposed land and income tax was the
only promising means whereby the necessary
revenue could be raised, and when the 48
rich, fat men of the Legislative Council were
confronted by the necessity of taxing them-
selves and their own class, or else letting the
country go broke, they decided by about the
largest majority on record that the country
could go broke if it wanted to f ,
There is a calm and hog-like candor about
the attitude of the Victorian Upper House
in this matter which is beyond even the
ordinary record of that body and others of
its species. The reason assigned for
its action is that the land and income
tax is a measure designed for the
spoliation of a class —admittedly its own
class. And so, undoubtedly, it is. All
taxation is spoliation, more or less ; and the
choice in the present instance lies between
taxing the class which possesses available
wealth and can pay, and taxing the class
which lias no wealth and can’t pay. The
Turner Government necessarily chose the
former expedient, but the Council, which
directly represents almost all the accumu-
lated wealth of the province, flatly refuses
to contribute anything to help the country
in its time of trouble. Hitherto there has
been practically no special taxation on wealth
in Victoria. The present land-tax yields
about £120,000 a year out of an aggregate
income which fluctuates between six and ten
millions, and, apart from this, the poor and
the rich pay very much alike. The roads
and railways which have opened up the Fat
Man’s property and added about£loo,ooo,ooo
to its value have been made at the expense
of both classes, but mainly at the ex-
pense of the poor. because there are more
of them. The ten or twelve millions which
have been spent in buying back lands
at enormous prices for railway purposes have
been mostly levied on the poor and almost
wholly paid over to the rich. The poor have
helped to pay for police and military forces
for the protection of the Fat Man’s property,
and in every other way a beautiful equality
has prevailed. And now that the poorer
section of the community can no longer
struggle on under the burden of the vast
liabilities it has incurred;/mostly for the Fat
Man’s benefit, it invites him to save the
country by contributing a little more than
his present share of taxation, and his un-
hesitating reply is that if the country can
only be saved on these terms he is quite
content that it should be lost.
• * •
Under such circumstances, the Turner
Ministry has very few alternatives before it.
It may attempt to save another £500,000 per
annum by retrenchment, and let the present
huge deficit stand over in the good old way ;
but unfortunately no one knows where any-
thing like another £500,000 can be saved
out of an annual expenditure that has already
been retrenched unto seventy times seven.
It may attempt to raise the required half-
million p#r annum by more taxation on the
poor, seeing that the wealthy classes have
given definite notice that they won’t pay, no
matter what happens—but taxes on the poor
hardly pay the cost of collection. Or it may
announce to the British creditor that the
province proposes to compound on the basis
of ss. or 10s. in the £ until times impro/e,
and chat, when the improvement comes, it
may or may not resume payment, according
to how it feels on the subject. A fourth
alternative—that of floating a loan to supply
this year s deficit, and then floating a larger
loan to supply next year’s deficit plus the
interest on this year’s loan, and floating more
loans every year until borrow ing comes to an
end by a natural process of collapse—is left
out of the calculation. Victoria’s difficulty
is its almost total inability to pay out of its
present revenue interest on the existing
public debt, and under these circumstances
the folly of contracting to pay more interest
in the future is sufficiently apparent. More-
over, the trouble lies, not so much in the
want of resources—-for Victoria is still about
the richest province in Australasia—as
in the definite resolve of the propertied
classes, expressed through their own especial
branch of the Legislature, not to contribute,
a copper to rescue the country from bank-
ruptcy. The only hope for th,e immediate,
future is that the aggregate. Fat Man of Vic-
toria will repent of his hog-like selfishness
and assume a more reasonable attitude, and;
this chance i,s so exceedingly remqte th,a,t
to incur new liabilities which can only be
met when the Fat repents, and amends
his way would be a worse form of dishonesty
than almost any other that can be imagined.
# # *
The reasons why the Victorian Democracy
should prefer—supposing the Council per-
sists in its present attitude—to leave the
English creditor unpaid rather than stave
off the disaster by temporary expedients are
sufficiently logical. In Victoria, property
represents three-fourths of the Legislature.
The propertied classes elect the Council
which represents them and their interests
alone. They also, by virtue of the extra
voting power which is conferred on bricks and
mortar, electsomething like half the Assembly.
They hold, and always have held, by far the
largest share of political power. It was the
votes of the propertied classes which piled
up the huge public debt of Victoria. It was
also the propertied classes which controlled
its expenditure. It was these classes that
built hopelessly unprofitable railways all
over the province, that created the hideous
disaster of the boom which is responsible for
all Victoria’s present troubles, that refused
to face the deficit in its early stages—that
did everything, in short, which brought the
community to its present pass. And now
that Property, through its elected represen-
tatives, unanimously refuses to do anything
to meet the emergency it has itself created,
the Democracy is fully justified in letting
things slide. The case for the citizen who
does not own property—the person who
represents two-thirds, or thereabouts, of the
community—can be logically expressed in a
few words. The public debt is not his debt.
'I he public bankruptcy is not his bank-
ruptcy. The emergency is not of his
making nor of his seeking. If Vic-
toria is disgraced by the failure to
meet her liabilities, the Fat Man is
Victoria for all governmental purposes.
He contrived to be Victoria all through her
period of prosperity, and it is only fair that
he should remain so during her adversity.
When the representatives of Property—the
men who borrowed £50,000,090 on the
nation’s credit, and spent it mainly to tor-
ward their own interests—refuse, as they
have done, to hear a very small measure of
the liability which they themselves created,
and state, in, effect, that the Democracy
must make up the entire deficiency or else
the country must burst, the answer should
be easy. It is, and always has been, the
Fat Mart’s country. If he won’t save his own
country, then the sooner it bursts the better,
« » •
The situation is one where a strong man,
with a strong party behind him, could make
history. ■ Unluckily, most Victorian poli-
ticians are only strong-smelling men —not
strong ones. Premier Turner finds himself
confronted with almost the most remarkable
set of circumstances in Australian history ;
the position is strikingly original—the man,
so far as has yet been seen, is only respect-
able, well-meaning, and a little less common-
place than the average. The emergency,
however, is not new ; it has been visibly
approaching for the last five years or so, and
the fact that the Legislature is taken by
surprise says little for its foresight. The
first beginnings of the trouble descended on
Gillies, in the year when the boom suddenly
began to decay, and he quietly retired from
the scene and handed the difficulty over to
his successor, James Munro. That vener-
able banker found it steadily assuming a
more aggravated form, and presently fled
to London, leaving the spectre of insolvency
to Shiees. Shiels did nothing to meet
the emergency, and it grew steadily worse
under his feeble reign until he handed over
the insoluble problem to Patterson.
Patterson did, if possible, a little less than
Shiels, and the only result of his term of
office was that the public finances, which
had previously been bad, became utterly
desperate. Now' Turner must either find
a remedy, or else retire in his turn and pass
on the ghastly incubus to Deakin, or
Harper, or anyone else who will have it.
The one consistent feature about the in-
cubus is that it gets worse the more it is
passed on, and the country is so tired of the
process that almost anything which could
happen would be a relief.
Federation Geographically Considered*
Blot the Murray system out of the map of Aus-
tralia, and the eastern half of the continent would
be nearly as big a geographical blank as the
western portion. It is the Nile of Australia ; and
few, perhaps, appreciate the extent of its ramifica-
tions, or how its favors are shared among the
principal provinces. Cross the Blue Mountains —
a few hours’ rail from Sydney—and you are on one
of the head waters of this great artery. Go up
to Brisbane and cross the range there, also but a
few, hours’ ride, and you are again on its sources ;
it is the boundary of a long border-line in Victoria;
and South Australia sees its waters safely to the
sea. Putting the area of these four provinces
roughly down at two millions of square miles, the
Murray basin drains 414,253 square miles, op an
eighth pare of the whole continent. Starting from
the northern heads, Queensland claims 101,525 s. m,
of this drainage area, N.S. Wales 234,3(32
Victoria 50,979 s.m. and S. Australia 24,387 s.m.
The bond of union, then, between the four may
bo said to be based upon the one great; rivtyc-
system. Westralia is as aloof from the other
provinces geographically as she is in the spirit
of Federation. At present, with the bumptious-
ness of a hobbledehoy just entering manhood,
tjhe mulga and saltwater province affects to sneer
at Federation. When, however, the rainbow gleam
of the present transient gold-rush has passed, and
the “ dull, sickening thud 11 of the bottom dropping
ou,t of the boom brings the swelling down, Wea-
tralia will probably think differently. Mean-
while, her presence in or out of the coining Federa-
tion is immaterial. Nay, it might even have been
better for Australia, climatically considered, if
that vast, unwieldy tract of aridity had never been
upheaved from the sea (or only in the form of some
islands), and the waves of the Indian Ocean lapped
a shore-line situated somewhere about the present
western boundary of South Australia ; “ but in a
great job like the making of the earth, small
points are apt to bo mislippened.”
# * *
To return to the rivers of the eastern table-land.
In addition to the Murray, Queensland and South
Australia own a joint interest in the big eastern
rivers of the Lake Eyre system. The streams
that unite to form Cooper’s Creek are in Queens-
land. The Diamantina and Eyre’s Qreek are
in the main in that province, and the tropical
rainfall that floods these rivers often brings relief
to the drought-parched regions of South Aus-
tralia. Given some time during the next century
when a system of locking will have widely ex-
tended the navigability of the Murray and
Darlfng, and a like system, combined with the
retention of flood-waters —quite feasible in the
flat interior—has made permanent water - ways
of the channels of Cooper’s Creek and the
Diamantina, the necessity of Federation is at
once apparent. The American who said that Aus-
tralia was “nothing but an infernal ant-bed ”
was right enough, only he did not put it nicely.
If he had said that from end to end one found a
surface configuration which induced a similarity
of pursuits, occupations and amusements amongst
the inhabitants and a little similarity of animals,
birds, insects (ants included), and vegetation, he
would have been more explicit, if less epigram-
matic, That nature has appointed no geographical
divisions is evident in the distribution of the
aborigines. Though some tribes living under
more favorable conditions than others have at-
tained a slightly higher grade physically and men-
tally, the race is essentially the sanifc. From the
Murray flats to the jungles of Cape Writ Penin-
sula, and from the sand-dunes of Fraser’s Island
to the mulga thickets of the Murchison, the
blackfellow and his national weapon, the
boomerang, are unchanged. One can under-
stand, for instance, why Spain should be a distinct
and different country from France, from the
mere result of the geographical structure of the
two; but one cannot understand why a man
living on the Warreuo River should hold his
neighbour, who lives 20 miles lower down, as an
alien and a foreigner. But that is sure to be the
outcome of our growing up independent states
with nothing better than aminvisible line of lati-
tude or longitude to divide one from the other.
# # *
Not only are we jointly interested in the streams
of the upper world, but we are all partners in
those of the under world. Take that much-vexed
and not yet settled question of the permanency of
the artesian supply. Say two provinces, Queens-
land and N.S. Wales, hold different views on the
question. N.S. Wales believes in the probable
falling off of the output and institutes a strict
system of supervision and economy. On the other
hand, Queen dand considers the supply inex-
haustible, and consequently takes no steps.
Water drawn from the same deep-buried reservoir
may be being rigidly saved on one side of the •
boundary and lavishly wasted on the other..
Again, to show how absurdly our artificial boun-
daries work, take the case of the Georgina River,,
in Queensland. It heads in that province, flows
across the boundary into the Northern Territory,,
takes a bend, and presently returns to Queens-
land. There is not a particle of difference in the ■
value of the country on its banks, but the lessee -
of pastoral land in Queensland has paid a much -
higher rental than his brother squatter across the •
border. In this case the difference is accentuated;!
by the river passing to and fro between the two •
provinces, but it is the same throughout the con-
tinent. Between N.S. Wales and Victoria the
Murray forms a natural boundary, and between;-
N.S. Wales and Queensland there is a fainti'.
attempt at one, but otherwise we are like four
people living in a large room drawing invisible •
lines on the floor and each warning the other to ■
keep within his bounds.
# * *
But there is still a wider view of the -
question. The territory we have to deal with -
may be said to have to have been handed over, to .
us, in the rough, to finish. Naturally, we have
first settled down on the most finished parts and! I
left the remainder for the aftercomers, yeti this -
remainder has, we now find, a value of its.own.
But while its reclamation or development could: be ■
well accomplished by united action, our waste-
territory will never become productive in the -
present state of things. Under Federation every .-
dry creek and parched billabong should be filled I
either with the impounded flood or artesian i
water, and thousands of miles of productive •
territory added to our possessions. The •
proper natural features of the country would 1
be followed, quite irrespective of artificial. I
boundary lines, and Nature aided in the •
work she is still striving to accomplish. Al-'
though it is customary to speak of desert country ,
as occupying a large share of the interior of the ■
continent, experience and history both teach us
that “deserts,” in tropical and semi-tropical I
climes, cease to exist when once they are assailed !
by the resources of money or numbers. The Aus- ■
tralian desert is a desert truly in its primitive .
state, a desert in its loneliness and lifelessness,,
a desert in the harsh and stunted nature of its:
vegetation, a desert in its grim monotony and I
repellent front, its aridity and desolation, but lett
the magic elixir of water be applied and all these-
attributes disappear. The hot, dry climate be-
comes a fostering mother of life, to be depended!
on for its constant uniformity ; the hard, prickly,
growth, spawn of the hot wind and sun,
pears ; and the aimless creeks, but half-formed by
the rare and doubtful rainful, once filled with tins
subterranean water, become long serpentine lagoons
—centres of life and moisture.
* • * /
All this may seem visionary and Utopian, but
it is within the power of,.a Federation to accom-
plish. So-far, there has been no jiheck to the west-
ward march of the drill, and there seems no reason
why there should be. Experiments have now
finally proved that the old idea that artesian water
is useless for irrigation purposes may go the way
of many other old ideas. In the hands of a Fede-
rated Australia the reclamation of Central and
even Western-Central Australia is possible, and
Nature has* even prepared the way for it in the
adaptability of the soil and the formation of the
surface. The unification of the four provinces,
-Whose life-blood may be said to be the Murray
and its host of tributaries, must eventually lead
to the reclamation of the whole continent for
purposes of close settlement. What could not be
attempted by one province single-handed would
be within the reach of them all united, and
the work would be no /longer provincial but
national. Our long seaboard is another
item which Nature has lib.-rally endowed
us with as a whole, although, as our arti-
ficial boundaries stand, it is unequally dis-
tributed. With all interprovincial tariffs swept
away, the good natural ports would be as available
for one province as foranother, and thefruitlesslabor
and expense of trying to m dee artificial harbors
would be doneaway with. The longer Federation is
delayed, the greater become the difficulties in the
way, for every year adds to the exclusive feeling
of each province. Trie N.S. Welshman becomes
more New South Welsh and the Queenslander
more Queensland i h ; while all the time there is
ilttle difference, geographical or climatic, between
the. districts in which they reside. There are
about five centuries of work to settle Australia
throughout and make it habitable even to the
most barren tracts, and when once we realise
that we are the people of a continent, not of a
province only, we shall probably commence to
think about starting on the job. With a smaller
rainfall and more meagre appliances the
Romans pushed their way far into the Sahara .
and made fruitful spots there, commencing
what the French are now going on with. The
Assyrians did the same, and we have evidences of
great works of reclamation done by nations whose
very names are lost. /With all the new science of
the world within our grasp, and the hereditary
pioneer spirit in our hearts, the foundation of a
great nation that will people Australia from end
to end should be now laid in the eastern half and,
by the natural and irresistible progress of expan-
sion, gradually embrace the continent.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Fat Man's Version of the Vic. Crisis.
There is something especially beautiful about'
the unanimity of the capitalistic press on one
aspect of the recent political crisis in Victoria.
The point on which it is so unanimous is that
the Turner Government was defeated because
it proposed to reduce the salaries of M.’sP. as


part of the general scheme of retrenchment.
On the strength of this assertion almost every
Fat Man paper in Australia has rushed to the
front with a leading article, showing how the
paid politician—and especially the paid labor
politician —is prepared to sacrifice everybody
save himself to the necessity for retrenchment
—how he cheerfully sacked hundreds of civil
servants, and retrenched the salaries ot the
remainder, and cut down sick pay, and econo-
mised on Judges, telegraph-messengers, school-
teachers, and Ministers of the Grown, with
equal readiness, but preferred to overset the
Ministry, and waste all the work of the
;session rather than have his own salary re-
duced below £270 per annum, ihe inference
drawn from this state of things is that the
politician—and especially the paid labor poli-
tician—is a grasping, cold-blooded person who
dives for his salary only, and has no vestige o
I patriotism in his composition. 1 his, tor
instance, is Sydney Telegraph s reading of the
11 'litrf who, before the constituencies and in the House
had strenuously supported the Ministry and backed them
up in all thfir measures of a progressive character, sud-
denly discovered that the moment that their pockets were
touched political allegiance to their leader was no louder
possible. The result is the humi hatma sp 'Ctaole of a
Ministry bein<c practically defeated by a selhsli, salary
grabbing clique, by whom political principle was shame-
lessly sacrificed for the sake of pecuniary and peisonal
The S.M. Herald takes the same view, if pos-
sible a little more enthusiastically
The majority of the Victorian Assembly-in this re-
sembling very closely majorities of other Assemblies
■which it is not now necessary to name—were deeply
shocked and grieved to see so commercial a spirit dis-
played by the Ministry. But they never for a moment
hesitated as to what they ought to do, and in resolving to
.do it even though the path of duty should he over a
shattered Ministry and over the ruins of their country.
When they spoke so freely and so imprudently about
cutting down their salaries, the tacit reservation was, of
course, implied that what was meant was the salaries of
everybody else, from the Governor to the poorly-paid
office messenger. But the moment a rash Ministry, rely-
ing on the explicit declarations of members themselves
that they would consider no retrenchment complete that
did not include cutting down their own salaries pro-
ceeded in all simplicity of mind to give effect to these
pledges, it is promptly determined that, whatever may be
the cost or peril to the country at this juncture, that
Ministry has got to go.
These two extracts are fair specimens of the
attitude of the Fat Man press in general. It
assumed this attitude all over Australasia on
the morning after the trouble arose; there
was no collusion about the matter in
fact, there was no time for collusion ; an
unerring Fat Man instinct led all the capi-
talistic press in the same direction at the
same instant. And yet the whole story is
one great, unvarnished lie, and the fact that all
the organs of capital should have risen up
together and simultaneously told the same lie
is, therefore, all the more remarkable. The
real narrative, as told in Hansard, is as unlike
the Fat Man paper’s version as can well be con-
ceived. Years ago the Victorian politician en-
joyed the very moderate wage of £3OO per
annum, but when bad times came and an all-
round reduction of 10 per cent, was made in
official salaries, the Assembly cheerfully re-
duced its own salary on the same scale
as the rest, making it £270. In view of the
continued bad times and the necessity for still
more economy, Premier Turner proposed—
and the Fat Man, who loathed payment in any
;shape, cheered him on—to make a further re-
duction to £2OO, and, after a long discussion,
■carried on mainly by half-a-dozen members, the
second reading of the Bill was carried by 60
wotes against 20—about the biggest and most
.enthusiastic majority that the Turner Govern-
ment has had on any question. An attempt
was made in committee by J. B. Patterson
to make the payment £250 instead of £2OO, but
Turner’s majority still stood by him, and the
meat-man of Castlemaine was suppressed by
another substantial majority. Then, the im-
portant business being over, most of the mem-
bers went home to bed, and the remnant, being
very tired, proposed, at a late hour, to adjourn
and do likewise, and carried the adjournment
motion against the Govt, by eight votes in a
very thin House ; whereupon Premier Turner,
whose nervous system was apparently in a bad
state, made a foolish exhibition of himself by
threatening immediate resignation. That was
all the crisis there was. It had absolutely no
more connection with the Payment of Members
Bill than it had with the Japanese war or the
recent snowstorm in Hungary. There was no
question of patriotism or want of patriotism in
the matter ; the beginning and middle and
end of it was that the Assembly was worn out,
and was still suffering from the Christmas fes-
tivities, and badly wanted to get to bed. The
ingenuity of the Fat Man press, in making so
much out of so little, was a clumsy lie from first
to last. No one but a Minister in a bad state
of liver and exasperation would have regarded
so trivial an affair as a defeat at all, and if
Turner had been his usual self the incident
would have passed quite unnoticed. Not being
I his usual self he blew up in a vaguely irres-
ponsible fashion to the astonishment of his
party and of the House generally.
Turner “Defines his Position.”
When Premier Turner lost his head after Vic.
Assembly had carried a one-horse motion of
adjournment against him, and blew up like a
Chinese cracker, he started out in his excite-
ment to define the position of the Government,
and did it a lot more truthfully than he would
have done in his calmer moments. “So far as
this Government is concerned,” said Turner,
“ it is not going to remain in office to be dic-
tated to by members.” Under these circum-
stances the advantage of having members at all
is not very apparent. According to a legislative
fiction, M.’sP. are supposed to rule the country,
and the policy of the Government is supposed
to represent the aggregate wisdom or foolish-
ness of the Parliamentary majority. In reality,
under the blessed system of Government by
Contradiction, when the Government goes
wrong, according to the opinion of the majority,
and the majority tries to make it go right, then
it is its duty to resign and give place to
another Cabinet which will also resign as
soon as it is asked to run the public
business as Parliament thinks it ought
to do. The duty of every high - minded
Ministry, under the present system, is to resist
the dictation of the Assembly and “get
up on its ear” whenever that body
attempts to assert itself. Under these
mixed conditions, The Bulletin would respect-
fully ask Mr. Turner what he thinks Parlia-
ment is intended for ? If it is not to dictate to
the Ministry then it is evident that, in Mr.
Turner’s opinion, the Ministry should do “ what-
ever it darned well likes,” and the business
of the Assembly is merely to vote for whatever
the Ministry proposes. Under these conditions
the country doesn’t want an Assembly. All it
wants is to elect a Cabinet once every three
years or so, and let it whoop along just as it
pleases till its term expires ; and when its term
expires the business of the country is to re-elect
it and let it whoop along again. On second
thoughts, however, The Bulletin doesn’t see
what the country has to do with the matter
either. If the country has no right to dictate
to the Ministry indirectly, through its elected
representatives, then it has no right to dictate
to it directly or any other way. And if it has
no right to dictate what the Ministry
shall do, it becomes an open question if
it has any right to dictate what the
Ministry shall be. When the system of Party
Government, as Turner understands it, reaches
its full development, the Cabinet will probably
hold office for life and then hand down its billet
to its son, or its nephew, or its wife’s eldest
son by a former marriage, or something like
that. The situation resolves itself into two
alternatives —either the country is to dictate to
the Ministry or it is not. Turner says it is
not, therefore the only logical result is a here-
ditary Cabinet which won’t even pretend to be
responsible to any one.
Railway Deadheads.
Since the publication of the recent stupendous
list of New South Wales railway deadheads, a
good many papers have arisen to point out, for
the several thousandth time, that it is the duty
of Commissioner Eddy to stop this old-
established robbery, and that, in not stopping
it, he has failed in his duty. This sort of
experience goes a long way to account for the
Commissioner’s anxiety to leave New South
Wales for good. He was engaged by Parlia-
ment for the purpose of making the railways
pay, of running them on commercial principles
and putting an end to abuses. Parliament
demands that he should put down the dead-
head evil as one of the abuses, and harries him,
at the same time, for free passes for its wife
and all its relatives. If he doesn’t grant them he
makes a bitter enemy of every begging M.L.A,
whose application for a free-pass has been re-
jected, and that individual and his kind accuse
him in the House of mismanagement and
nepotism, and sool their newspapers on him,
and compel him to defend himself at great
expense, before Parliamentary commissions,
against all sorts of charges, and refuse to defray
his heavy legal expenses afterwards. If he
does grant them, someone rises up after a while
to ask for a return of railway deadheads, and
when the appalling list comes to hand, the
press and the members who got the free passes
want to know why Commissioner Eddy doesn’t
do his duty and abolish this great swindle upon
the public exchequer. Yet no one among all
these bogus reformers proposes to relieve the
Commissioner of the responsibility of acting as
sole buffer between his greedy employers
and the public revenue. Not one indivi-
dual who demands passes from Eddy, and
afterwards curses him for granting them,
and would curse him still harder if he didn’t
grant them, even suggests that the effective
way out of the difficulty is to abolish free-
passes altogether, except in the case of railway
employes travelling on duty only. That is the
simple and obvious remedy, but nobody wants
that kind of remedy. Then if the Government
wanted to help along any distinguished visitor,
the only way to do it would be for the Treasurer
to hand the distinguished one the price of his
or her ticket, and explain the matter afterwards
the best way he could in his Financial State-
ment, and then Parliament could order that the
amount thus expended be deducted from his
salary. Will some democratic M.L.A. try the
experiment of bringing in a bill to this effect ?
A Specious Proposal:
The Victorian Property party raises its flat-
catching cry for Parliamentary Reform at an
opportune moment. Retrenchment is in the
air, the character of the Legislative Assembly
—the character of the precious Council is not
touched upon in this “reform” question—
stands only a little higher than it stood before
last elections, and Fat Man’s agitation for
fewer members at a very much reduced salary
receives honest support from democrats who
haven’t thought the matter out. At a first
glance every Senate in Australia appears
too bulky, and, therefore, too expensive.
Payment of members is absolutely necessary
to a fair representation of the people, and
.£3OO a year is, in The Bulletin’s opinion,
the smallest payment consistent with public
faith in the principle. If the unwealthy section
of Vic. Assembly agrees to a reduction of
salary out of respect for the spirit of the times
it doesn’t follow that the aforesaid principle
has suffered a fall in value because the
Treasurer’s deficit is steadily rising. Nor will
any wise democrat give ear to the Tory hubbub
which is certain to come anon, when the
Labor members shall feel justified in demanding
a return to the normal .£3OO rate. Common-
sense may be bamboozled, just now, by the
party that would gladly supply the country
with a small Assembly free of charge. But the
folly of allowing the thin end of Eat Man’s
wedge to touch the Act that enables thin men
to have a hand in law manufacture will soon be
understood by the very voters who created
the danger. It is easy to see the mistake—
when pointed out—in reducing the payment of
members. The error of advocating a reduction
in their numbers is rather less obvious to the
average eye, which, after all, is a very dull
optic, with a wonderful capacity for holding dust.
The fact that little Great Britain gets along with
one honorary M.P. to every (50,000 inhabitants
or thereabouts, is hastily accepted as evidence
that Victoria carries five times as many paid
legislators as the country requires. “ What
do we want with 95 members ?” is a common
enquiry. The common reply is, “ Heaven
knows!” followed by a sage shaking of the
head. The Lord knows why His servant Fat
Man encourages the idea that a smaller House
is desirable. Fewer members would mean an
increase in the area of electoral divisions, and
the bigger the electorate the smaller a poor
man’s chance of heading a wealthy candidate at
the poll. Remove 35 seats, as proposed by the
Voice of Proputty, from the Victorian As-
sembly, and, so far from having a brisker,
brighter competition for the remaining 60
places, the country would find itself represented
more and more by leisured capitalists, able to
spend the money and time necessary to a care-
ful “working” of large, sparsely-populated
districts. That is the Parliamentary Reform
desired by the land-owning and Freetrade class,
and now advocated by their press organ. Fat
Man’s scheme is like a cheap, sheeny dress
material in Sargood’s store. It appears good
goods until one holds it up to the light, and
sees the figure of Sargood through its thin
texture.
Trial by Cabinet Minister.
A simple means of increasing the Victorian
revenue without the aid of a new bill will
doubtless be adopted by the Customs Depart-
ment sooner or later. At present, the influen-
tial importer whose goods are invoiced at less
than cost price, is encouraged in his fraud by
the Minister’s indisposition to prosecute when,
perchance, a particularly glaring case came
before him. These swindles are compounded
in secret. The big importer pays a fine to the
department, which fine is not calculated to
make him honest in the future, and presently a
Chinaman is proceeded against on a much smaller
charge, financially speaking, in order that the
majesty of the Law may be asserted. A very
poor excuse for drawing this distinction between
BuadiNS & Co., of Flinders Lane, and Wing
Cow, of Little Bourke-street, is offered by the
Customs Dept. It is suggested that Buggins
and his commercial friends are such deter-
mined liars and artful dodgers that the depart-
ment would generally fail to prove its case,
so the private compromise is therefore a
prudent expedient. Only a political mind
could deceive itself with such an argument
as this. A fraudulent merchant must be fairly
cornered before he will pay a fine, and the evi-
dence which he can’t wriggle away from at the
Customs would be even more overpowering in a
law-court. Moreover, money paid in private
to avoid a prosecution that would break down
is money illegally obtained. The Vic. Minister
of Customs, on his own showing, extorts cash to
which he is not entitled. Furthermore, he cheats
many a hungry lawyer out of the job of suc-
cessfully defending a trader whose guilt, if an
accomplished fact, can’t be proved. Here is a
potent reason why the Legislative Assembly,
where every ninth man is licensed to wear a
wig, should insist upon a fair trial of all alleged
revenue - robbers. The system of trial by
Cabinet Minister is bad all round. Bad for the
Minister’s moral sense, bad for the suppositious
victim who allows himself to be bounced, bad
for legal business, exceedingly bad for the
public pocket. The effect of a strictly stern
and honest administration of the Customs
Dept, would be to raise the average invoice-
price of dutiable goods at once and for ever.
Firms that swindle now because swindling is a
good spec., and their precious characters are
not injured thereby, can be made honest by the
fear of exposure, whilst the inveterate rogues
who can’t trade straight, not having been built
that way, are bound to draw their frauds
milder when they have to run the risk of day-
light prosecutions.
The fatheaded London shopkeeper who con-
siders the Queen a good thing for trade is not
alone in his ignorance. He has supporters in
the Vic. Legislative Assembly, for o ie place.
Harper, the pious grocery dealer, and Foster
Rogers, an eccentric Tory with a socialistic
kink in his brain, were both of them against a
reduction in the Governor’s salary, on the
ground that it would be bad for trade. The
difference between £lO,OOO and £5OOO a year
would mean a loss of .£5OOO to “ legitimate
circulation ” in Victoria, said these two poli-
tical economists. By the same token, of course,
an addition of tyvo millions to Hopetoun’s
annual stipend would improve the legitimate
circulation by that amount, provided that he
spent it like a noble earl. In fact, the country
couldn’t do better than give all its loose
cash to his Excellency as often as it
had any loose cash, and ask him to do
some more circulating. The world suffers
considerably from shopkeepers’ theories.
Loyalty to the Crown is very much a matter of
believing that a Court ball “ causes money to
be spent which wouldn’t be spent otherwise.”
The House of Peers is a benefit to humanity in
the eyes of Harper and Rogers, seeing that it
circulates a lot of money in keeping up its
“dignity.” The late Lord blackguard Ailes-
bury was a champion useful peer because he
circulated so far above the average. Trade is
deeply indebted to the Jubilee Juggins. An
uncle, or somebody, bequeathed a fortune to
the young man, and he sacrificed it, like a true
patriot, on the altar of commerce. Cod
bless him for that ! He didn’t work and
produce wealth in any form, but he circulated
coin, therefore it would have been a thousand
pities to poll-axe the Juggins and hand his
estate over to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Believe all this, and you will be saved—or
rather, you will cease to be a confounded
democrat, which amounts to the same thing.
The shopkeeper’s dream of a universal aris-
tocracy, with an unlimited circulating power,
doesn’t quite harmonise with Fat Man’s extra
vote for Thrift—but no matter. The one sad
circumstance we are considering at present is
the loss of .£5OOO to Victoria’s circulation all
along of reducing the vice-regal salary.
Messrs. Hogue and O’Sullivan, M.’sP., joined
hands the other day in an appeal to N.S.VV.
Minister Young on behalf of the unemployed.
They assured the Minister that the unemployed
were in a parlous state and should be provided
with work, but as all eould not be put into
harness, they urged the immediate employment
of some 25 or so, whom they specially repre
sented. Hogue and O’Sullivan should sit
down and ask themselves why they were created
and sent into the political world. Was ranker
political patronage than this ever aimed at ?
“ These twenty-five men,” they said, “ are not
agitators or Domain spouters, but good, ca-
pable and trustworthy workingmen.” So far as
Editor Hogue is concerned, it may be men-
tioned that the difference is little between a
man who agitates with his pen and one who
agitates with his tongue. The journalist is
always on the alert for something to excite
interest, and if some people prefer talking to
writing the preference is not to be charged to
their detriment. It is pretty much the same
impulse, the same character of mind, and the
same conception of duty which drive one man
to write an article and another to jump on a
stump and talk. As regards Mr. O’Sullivan’s
fine scorn for “agitators,” it was as
an agitator that Mr. O’Sullivan started,
and, until his salary and fat perquisites
bulged out his pocketbook, as an agitator he
lived, and no doubt, if lean days come again, as
an agitator he will die. Which is not the
slightest harm, provided he agitate for what is
right. The heart of the vicious position both
men took up beats in the innuendo that
agitators are necessarily not good working men.
This has been the convenient phrase of all
tyrannies, of all despotisms, of all superiorities
founded on pretence instead of desert, and has
been applied to newspapers as well as to men
for ages.
The usual weekly “ tragedy ” has occurred at
Forbes (N.S.W.). Another zealous and intel-
ligent policeman has shot his man—a diminu-
tive Italian resident of the township, known
as “ Little Bennie.” The policeman was asked
to sleep in a house whose inmates complained
of night annoyances. According to his own
story, he was roused about one o’clock by a
noise on the verandah. It was very dark, but
he looked out and saw three men, one of whom
raised the open window-sash slightly. The
constable rose, jumped out of the window,
revolver in hand, fired in the air, and called on
the men to stand. Two of them ran away
and have never been heard of since. The
third was a miserable little cranky Italian
whom the constable chased into a cul-
de-sac. The Italian tried to dodge and get
out, and the constable shot him through the
head and killed him. This is the constable’s
own story; and the dead man can’t deny it.
The Italian was unarmed, but a screw driver
was found in his pocket by another constable,
and a pair of slippers—only one pair of slippers
—were at the gate of the house. The man was
possibly an intending burglar, but, burglar or
none, the law declares that a policeman shall
make every effort to arrest his quarry before
taking life. In this case the constable
appears to have made no effort whatever. He
was in no bodily danger ; the Italian was a
resident well-known to him ; the Italian was
much the smaller and weaker man ; yet the
constable appears to have lost his head and
blazed away at random. The other two men
may have been real or they may have been mere
men of buckram —myths of the disordered con-
stabulary imagination. And the usual wooden-
headed jury sitting on the body the same day,
a dozen hours or so after the slaughter, brings
in a verdict of justifiable homicide, and thanks
the constable for his valour! The case urgently
demands enquiry.
It is urged by an anonymous daily newspaper
correspondent that in according free passes over
the New South Wales State railway lines, to
certain so-called “distinguished visitors,”
officialdom was acting wisely, as the advertise-
ment given to the attractions of the country by
the visitors in question might be expected to lead
to a great increase of traffic. But just carry
this argument out of N.S. Wales and look at
it: How often does the P. and O. Co. carry
deadheads with a view to advertising the trip
to Australia? How many of the “ Ladies
Smith (2),” and “ Lady Joskins and daughters
(6),” managed to travel to Australia “on the
nod” per (say) the Messageries Maritimes and
Orient steamboats last year? The parlia-
Supply and Demand.
The Argus, dealing with the Newcastle (N.S.W.) col-
liers’ troubles, sheds a few green tears over “ the hapless
men who have to suffer for a terrible act of folly com-
mitted by past leaders,” holding that “ the difficulty is
largely due to the great strikes of several years ago,”
but owners are sooner or later compelled by the pressure
of competition to reduce rates to the level of poorer col-
lieries which first get the advantage of the excess of
labour, and there vs no power on earth that can prevent
them.’’ — Bulletin italics.
Lost the cause for which you’re fighting, futile
all your hopes and vain,
For the Loud has set His face, and marked a
way,
And no power on earth can turn it, or can plan
a course again,
Whilst men hunger, and they thirst, and toil,
and pray.
Like the sun, the Law is steadfast, none may
change it, none command —
Man is but the servile creature of supply and of
demand !
Gnarled and bent and stained with labour,
sweating, striving ’neath the goad,
Look not onward, look not upward for a
star.
Do and dree in brutish patience, set your
shoulders to the load,
For ye can but be the wage-slaves that ye
are.
In His image God made men, and gave to them
the teeming earth,
There to fight for life in fury from their luck-
less hour of birth.
And the few who have not fallen ’neath the
curse of Adam’s flaw
Mock your weariness with false and empty
sighs,
And with mouthing of the mighty and uncon-
querable Law
Made of fraud, and force, and ignorance, and
lies.
So the rich will spread the Gospel, while its
sentiments imply
Theirs the pleasure to demand, and yours the
duty to supply.

mentary return, on the subject of New South
Wales State-railway dead-heads, reveals some
interesting facts, but the root-facts of the case
are not disclosed. For instance, when “Lady
O’Roarty and daughters,” of whom nobody in
Australia (barring her ladyship’s relatives)
ever heard before, came to this country
and were barnacled on to the State-
linea gratis for six weeks at a stretch, how did
they get their free passes? Is it the habit of
the Commissioners to chase round with free-
passes every mere globe-trotter who comes out
to glare at Australia with the superciliousness
characteristic of the people who wear loud
checks and travel with twelve trunks apiece ?
If not, who makes application for the tickets?
Is it the Premier of the day, who meets these
people at Government House, or are these dis-
tinguished spongers foisted on to the Treasury
by the people who ought to entertain them, and
who find it easier to plunge their hands into
the State coffers than into their own well-filled
pockets ? The inquiry should be pursued
further next session.

846 Macquarie-strget North, Sydney,
3 anuary 16, 1896.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
I must say that I quite fail to see why they re-
produced those lists of women dead-heads on the
railways in a Sydney daily recently, although, of
course, one must take one’s newspaper sensations
thankfully, asking no questions, about this time of
year. But I don’t quite appreciate the horrible
spectacle in printer’s ink supposed to be afforded
by these aforementioned lists, although, as I have
never travelled “ on the nod” in all my born days,
1 ought to be thunder-stricken at the bare idea of
anybody else doing so, undoubtedly. The
overwhelming majority of these unprofitable
passengeresses appear as “wives of M.’sP.”
Well, I honestly think that the more free
passes the average member can beg, borrow or
steal for his wife (always making it distinctly
understood that he mustn’t go up the line with a
tall, thin, dark wife, and down with a short, fat
helpmate with Jersey hair), the higher will be the
moral tone observed in ten-minute tunnels. Also,
there will be noticeable decrease in rash hopes
born only to wither on the stem in unsophisti-
cated rustic bosoms which mistook the gentle-
man in the long hat for a respectable single man.
Nor_ do I want to throw any violent
aspersions on the dead-head duchesses, “stiff”
honorable Miss So-and-So’s, and free-listed Lady
Toplofties. It seems strange, perhaps, that
these people, whose prototypes scatter diamonds
on their hirelings in the pages of fiction, cannot in
real life pay for their railway-tickets; but while
Australia is a continent dotted with Gov’ment-
houses these abuses we will always have with us.
Where is the portfolio’d politician who would
dare to hang “Free list entirely suspended ” over
the door of his department, and brutally tell a
Governor’s mother-in-law applying for a sleeping-
berth on the nod that Her Grace, if she wished to
travel cheaply, would have to go as a corpse?
Wtiile Australia tries to behave itself as a little
tin-pot imitation of England, with Governors,
seconded by titled Premiers, to lead the way, our
taxpayers should decidedly take all these things
as part of the expenses consequent upon maintain-
ing a fashionable establishment. It’s all very
How often do Wo not wish during our hot
summer days to have something to refresh us
with ; and how near it is to hand. Just give the
sanitary toilet requisite “Amykos” a trial, and
you will never be without same as a refreshing,
cooling and wholesome compound to pour into
the washing-basin ; or, used as a mouth-wash and
gargle, you will always keep your mouth in a
healthy, clean and purified condition. To
be had from all chemists and perfumers at Is. 6d.

well to groan over statistics that don’t talk
back, but how does the thing look in
reality? For example, Lady Jersey’s one
and only chum—Lady Galloway—figures on
the black-list. But what a social bungler a
Minister would seem if he refused a Governor a
free pass for his wife’s bosom friend ! It’s an old
story that no man can serve two masters. If a
man is a Gov’menthouse politician he is necessarily
easy game for the stream of distinguished visitors,
who go through him for all his office is worth,
and leave him to face the Opposition benches when
the band begins to play. And, if he isn’t a
Gov’menthouse legislator, who is he? So long as
there is a Governor left on these shores so long is
there bound to be an everlasting golden political
goose on the parliamentary roost for the Luke
and Duchess of Plaza-Toro to exploit at their own
sweet will. And that’s my ultimatum.
Tailsing of M’s.P., a lengthy and ennobbled ex-
Premier would still seem to fill the public eye and
be a dress-circle hero, in spite of being somewhat
out of the running. It seems a lady wrote him a
most furious love-letter the other day. Not that
M’s.P. think much of a little thing like that; but
this billet-doux was written in the lady’s gore,
drawn from her romantic veins, first pierced by a
silver stiletto with which she had killed a man in
Napoli. That was her little tale, at any rate,
though I suspect she got the whole effect out of a
steel nib and a bottle of red ink.
The story goes that the moderately-brand-new
bride of a Maoriland mail-boat captain was not
taken seriously on a recent trip, owing to her
badly-concealed idea that the wife of a steamboat
authority is a sort of queen of the deep so long as
she sails under the flag of her husband’s company.
From the very first hoisting of the gangway the
lady had been tentatively doing the honors of the
ship, though it wasn’t her husband’s boat—a far-
seeing management doesn’t allow Captain and
Mrs. Binnacle to travel together, “ as there would
then be two bosses aboard instead of one”—but
it was not until they were well into the voyage
that Mrs. Brassbuttons began to be really amusing.
Stopping too long on shore at, say, Rio, she sent
an imperative note to the captain—” Stop the boat,
I shall be late.” In spite of this, when she arrived
at the wharf there was the liner in sea-going trim
slowly steaming away ! By the help of a fleet
boat and frantic signallings with her gamp, she
managed to reach the ship and was hauled on
board anyhow, choking with indignation. “ Didn’t
you receiye my note?” she acridly demanded of
the captain, as if the failure of the missive to hit
the bull’s-eye- was the only explanation possible.
tl Oh, yes,” was the careless reply, ‘‘but surely
you understand that we never wait for ordinary
passengers.” They say that the bride wore a
more deferential air for the rest of the run. The
big mailboat companies are wise in their genera-
tion. There really can’t be two bosses on a ship.
The farewell banquet and reception given re-
spectively to Vice-Admiral Bowden-Smith and
the Admiraless by the citizens of Sydney in the
Centennial Hall the other evening, were pleasant
festivities and much less perfunctory than such
affairs usually seem. As a rule, when people band
together to give a distinguished personage a meal,
it generally means that half-a-dozen enthusiasts,
grateful for past hospitalities, have been clever
enough to hoodwink a number of uninterested
people into booming what ought to have been a
club dinner into a public banquet. But the ban-
3uet under notice was surprisingly free from the
isaffeeted person who shows symptoms of a desire
to call out “No !” and “ Turn him out!” when the
chairman starts upon the oily task of flattering
the guest of the evening.
It was rather mischievous of the departing
Admiral to be so enthusiastic over the naval
dwelling at Kirribilli Point which he alluded to as
a “ pleasant residence which it probably is
when the wind is in the east and flowing towards
the hide-depot next door. If it was his purpose
to lure the new Admiral into slinging his hammock
there he appears to have succeeded. Rear-Admiral
Bridge has expressed his intention of haunting
-Admiralty House just as much as his predecessor
did, though it is hard to see what good that will
do. A grass-widower like Admiral B. might just
as well hang out at the top of his own mizzen-
mast for all the social use he is likely to be from
a feminine point of view.
I thought the departing Admiral threw a new
light on naval suffering in the beastly kawlinies
when he told the anecdote of the brother officer
who ‘‘took umbrage” when a Tasmanian once
pointed an impressive finger at H.M.S. Katoomba
and said “ That’s one of our ships.” The officer
in question bitterly resented the possessive pro-
noun, first person plural—when applied to the
subsidised man-o’-war. Considering that Aus-
tralia contributes the whole cost of the
Auxiliary Squadron, and pays, that iden-
tical officer’s salary, I don’t quite see why any
tax-payer shouldn’t allude to the ships as “ours,”
if he likes. The only way out of the difficulty ’is
for the incensed naval Johnnie aforesaid to leave
off talking about “my ship” and always allude to,
the Auxiliary fleet as “ those beastly kawlonial
punts, don'tcherknow.” But it is vain to imagine
such an effort. Deprive a Britisher of his pet
possessive pronoun (“my lawyer,” “ mv hotel ”
“my banker”) and he will wither like an un-
watered flower.
The new Admiral spoke at the banquet—but I
got the best view of him at the reception. Admiral
Bridge is an abbreviated hero with a thin, rather
pale face, trimmed with- a scrubby moustache
beard and whiskers. Owing to his being a rear-
admiral, he doesn’t train so much gold over his
person as we have lately been accustomed to, and
altogether ha impressed me as a marine potentate
who would be scared to death if a deputation of
women ever waited upon him to urge him into
Riving a kettle-drum. His suite, however, looks as
if it would bo equal to a dozen such emergen-
cies. Secretary Hopkins (who now holds the
marine social fate of Potts Point in the hollow of
his hand) is a tall and athletic youth facially
resembling Robert Brough, though, of course, he
considers himself much lovelier. Blag-Lieutenant
Huff (not Gov. Huff’s eldest son, as has been
stated : his Lxcellency’s first-born is in the army)
is also a clean-shaven Adonis of the deepest dye,
and other satellites of the naval system seem to be
more or less up to date.
~ Ik i s touching to see what a back number the old
‘suite ” becomes when the new turns up I Its com-
ponent parts stalk about like skeletons at the feast,
while Society belledom longs to see them hustled on
board the mailboat ere they have time to give the
new men any pointers as to how fond Miss Blank
is of looking at cabin-albums, or what marvellous
uses Miss Hash puts ship-hatbands to. Admiral
Bridge and his festive following have come to stay
three years, by the way. It is a little too early
for Australia to congratulate herself on the subject
just yet awhile.
A fashionable gathering farewelled Mrs. Bowden-
Sraith and her unaffected daughters at the public
reception given in their honor. The great hall
was gay with flags and potted plants, while inces-
sant band and organ music made it necessary for
people to bellow their graceful valedictory remarks
to the heroines of the hour. The Admiraless made
her last public appearance in mauve silk, with
black lines, and carried a charming bouquet of
roses and water-lilies—a get-up in which Mrs.
Bowden Smith looked so well that one found it
hard to believe that she owns to having seen
Charles Kean play Henry V. In a farewell letter
to Mrs. Rignold the Admiraless confessed to
having seen only two Henry Yees, “Charles
Kean, at Hrury Lane, and your husband in
Sydney.” Judging by the latter-day appearance
of the kindly lady, it is evident that Kean was
no stickler about admitting babies in arms.
Miss Bowden Smith wore a becoming yellow
brocade, Miss Mildred Bowden Smith (who made
her debut at a Sydney Govt. House ball) sported
shell pink, while a small sister, in pure white,
her committee bouquet with obvious
pride. There was a fair sprinkling of good-look-
ing gowns on the floor, considering that it is now
the full swing of the recuperating season. The
committee-ladies were all got-up to the last hair
of their heads, and greatly conduced to the success
of the evening. You knew they were committee-
ladies because they each wore a badge like an
attenuated archer’s target over their hearts.
Whether these things were intended to suggest
Cupid’s darts to the new naval contingent is quite
beyond my reckoning.
la] king about the navy, a Melbourne daily
waxed indignant recently over the fact that the
Auxiliary Squadron prefers Barm Cove to Hob-
son s Bay, and tried its best to provoke the Vic-
torian Government into asserting the obvious
rights of Melbourne belledom to a thicker slice of
the gallant tars’ society than they are in the habit
of receiving. And, seeing that Victoria really pays
her share of the “ naval agreement ” that keeps
‘our ships ” in commission, it does seem a hard
thing that the Southern province hasn’t even one
society engagement to show for it.
I think the surest remedy is to run two Mel-
bourne Cups instead of one. A stern sense of
duty always takes the whole fleet —from the flag-
ship down to the fussiest little torpedo-boat—over
to Hobson’s Bay towards the end of October to
guard Port Phillip from the foe, and supposing
another Cup were run in March, or thereabouts, a
half-yearly naval hegira would undoubtedly take
place.
It really does seem a shame that the Melbourne
maiden hasn’t an equal chance with her Sydney
sister in trying to bring Captain Corcoran to the
altar—and, yet, despite the Squadron’s apparent
predilection for Barm Cove, Toorak hasn’t done so
badly from a naval point of view. The only Aus-
tralian Admiraless in the world is a Victorienne.
I hear that a gilded Maoriland youth fled to
Australia the other day under painful circum-
stances. He wrote to a lady proposing marriage,
and then for a whole week he. waited in vain for
an answer. Being driven to fury at last by the
lady’s cold neglect, he arose and proposed to
another girl and was accepted. Next day the
original girl, who had been out of town, returned
and received the letter, and replied with an enthu-
siastic affirmative; and the distracted vouth,
finding himself affianced to two girls at once, des-
pairingly packed up his high collar and left hia
native shores.
A sister of Lady Carington is about to. share the
Luck of Lden Hall,” as she is shortly to be
married to young Musgrave, a Cumberland
baronet of much wealth, who, if I am not mis-
taken, was in Australia not long ago in the
leading-strings of a Mr. Wyndham Tuffnel. He, as
the proprietor of the romantic Eden Hall, owns
the celebrated jdass vase, which tradition says was
stolen from fairies, and which brings such good
fortune to its possessor that it is called the “ Luck
of E len Hall.” Bearful pains and penalties are
attached to its loss or destruction, and therefore
it is diligently cared for, and is only used on very
grand occasions. Miss Nora Harbord is the
lady s name, and she counts three more years than
her fiance, who came of age only a short time
ago.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, January 15.
The Oamperdown chemist, called upon in the
doctor’s absence for professional assistance to Lady
Hopetoun when she was bitten by a dog, is
evidently another of Fortune’s minions. He is said
to have met the emergency nobly, with calm, un-
moved front and a composite treatment, including
all known remedies for bite, sting, scratch, wound,
bruise, cut, shock and rabies.
I heard lately that the hauteur of Melb.’s Em-
press was cultivated in the first instance at the
suggestion of her “ dear ” predecessor. That wily
diplomate confided to the young neophyte, who
sought her guidance in London, that the initial
mistake of her own colonial career had been a too
gushing demeanour, which, once inaugurated, had
to be kept up. The result, she stated, was most
annoying familiarity on the part of her subjects,
especially the dowagers who (horrid old creatures!)
actually took_ to kissing her on every possible
occasion. This explains a good deal. We under-
stand now why Somebody, though not so much as
at first, keeps her own sex at arm’s length, fight-
ing particularly shy of any stout purrer who
shows signs of wanting to clasp her in a motherly
embrace.
Ihe Princess’ Panto, bowls rather merrily along,
handicapped though it be by a partial misnomer.
The Beast, whose accents would be audible in the
midst of an earthquake, comes up to expectation,
but no one answering to the description of a
Beauty is to be seen anywhere about, and we look
back with a sigh to Vi Varley as last season’s
pretty Red Riding Hood.
The heroine of the present production is a
bridling young thing who would have been suited
well enough by the name of “Disy ” or “ Beller,”
in fact, anything at all but “ Beauty.” However,
if the pantomime star in question plumes herself
on her music-hall wriggle and a twang which puts
the “ colonial ” article to the blush, no one has
any right to dispute her possession of these
charms. Certainly she is a graceful dancer of the
saucy, piquante school.
. Beauty’s Dad, another importation, is an amus-
patriarch, as times go, but when, as the result
of a rough-and-tumble, he gives an unusually life-
like representation of certain phases of internal
upheaval, no one laughs much. Perhaps a hot
climate is not conducive to the thorough apprecia,-'
tion of that sort of joke. The flower of the*
foreigners, so far as “ Beauty and the Beast v- is
concerned, is Marie Luella, otherwise ‘-‘the ’
Prince,” though one would like the dashing
creature all the better if she hadn’t an extreme
weakness for nigger ditties. I hear Miss ,
Mane was formerly an Amurkan, which,explains,
the prevalence of banjo in her musical accompani-
ments.
Clever D’Arcy Stanfield was promptly spotted s
among the pantomimists by two- friends from!
Bananaland, who, thereupon, related that the last,
tune they had seen him was ’way up Nonh
travelling about with a piece called ‘‘Cockalorum, ” ’
or some such name. The ballet, and so on, said i
the narrators, was represented by four very tall!
stout ladies dressed as pages. The stage was.
small and low, the audience uncomfortably near.
All the bold, bad young men of the district crow-
ded into the front chairs and sat glowering and
sniggering at the dunseuses. But the fairy four
presented such a very muscular and well-trained
appearance as they defiantly returned their tor-
mentors scrutiny, that at first opportunity the
latter sauntered out, singing “ The people would
roar and roll on the floor, if they saw the old
woman in tights.” After the interval, those flash
young men were seen to have found places further
back in the building, where they sat prepared for
hasty flight if necessary.
Last summer, bright sun-bonnets were suffi-
ciently numerous to supply a dash of welcome,,
color to the sombre scenery of Victorian beaches.
This season they are epidemic. A substantial 1 /
dame, sojourning not far from Beaumaris, daily
listens to the sad sea-waves, accompanied by her
10 daughters; the whole party, from 16-stone ma
down to two-year-old Tottie, tied up in capacious
pink hoods identical in everything but size.
The Austral Salon, in the full expectancy of
female suffrage, intends indulging in political dis-
cussions. Things have not been altogether peace-
ful of late among the gushing Salonites, and the
modest members who have hitherto kept quiet
show signs of revolting against the autocracy of
one or two blatant pen-women, who have bem
running the Salon as a huge advt. for themselves
and their puny literary efforts.
It is whispered that English cricketer Phillip-
son is engaged to a Toorak heiress, the daughter
of a well-known stock salesman.
At a certain fashionable wedding, not long ago-
the rejected one went to the church, determined!
to quench her with his eagle eye. Coming down,
the aisle, she beamed on him with a gracious-
smile. He ducked, bowed, and grinned from ear
to ear. Afterwards, I am told, he was “ fit to.
bash his hat in.”

The pretty comedy of “Hans the Boat-
man ” is doing a brief season at Sydney Criterion
with rather less success than it deserves. 11,ms
with his quaint German accent, and his wildly in-
verted English, and his dog, and his songs,' and
his picturesque costume, is always welcome, and
just now, when Charles Arnold seems to be in
even better form than usual, he is more than
usually welcome. Hans and the big dog fall in a
refreshing shower on a community which is feel
mg sun-dried with much garish pantomime and.
vast, flaring melodrama. They are a curious
mixture of bright comedy and unspeakable pathos,
with enough mu«ic and dance thrown in to make
an ordinary-sized opera, and enough small children
for two or three pantomimes. Charles Arnold
may be briefly dismissed with the statement that-'
he is the only actor in Australia who could plav
Hans, and he plays that attractive person for aft
that is in him and a little more. Also, his hi.*
dog is the only dog in the-world that could piav
Hans’ dog; he is letter-perfect in his part and
performs it with much feeling. Miss Dot Frederics ■'
has improved on the character of Jeffie until I
there is little to choose between her and thaD
vanished idol, Pattie Browne, Mr. E W
Thomas, as old Yank Tbursby, is a notable sue-'
cess, and the infant, the baby coquette, and the
“kiddies” generally, are the brightest crowd of
small offspring that Sydney has seen for some
time—barring only the infant builders in RignoldY
pantomime. “Hans” is a comedy without any
trace or semblance of vulgarity, an opera with the'
high-kicking element left out, and a pantomime
with the naked element wholly omitted, and is;
hereby cordially recommended as a show that
deserves the warm support not only of every-
ordinary human man, woman, and child, but also,
of the Y.M.C.A., and the Y.W.C.A. and the
W.0.T.U., and the 1.0.G/l’., and the A N. A
and the A.S.U., and the A.L.F., and kindred in-
stitutions.


LUXURY FOR THE MASSES.
Adam Smith, the greatest economist, used to say
that one should not judge of a man’s fortune by
his expenses, but by his savings. This saying
finds its confirmation amongst all classes of the
people. However, there are luxuries which a man
does not like to deprive himself of, such as going
to the play or a concert occasionally. There are
other luxuries which grow on man, becoming habits
first and then necessities of every-day life.
Amongst these the most prevalent is smoking.
Now, if a man be wise he will take care to injure
neither his health nor his purse by indulging in it
injudiciously ; he will, therefore, look out for the
best-value smoke in the market, and by adopting
Em■■■sard's Gavour cigars he is sure to hit on the
right thing. They are mild and aromatic, and are
sold in pickets o' eight for one shilling.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It) has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to"all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

The greatest circus on earth— every circus
is the greatest circus on earth—was announced to
open at Redfern (Sydney), opposite the railway-
station, last Tuesday. This is Woodloch’s first
appearance in N.S. Wales, and his show—entirely
apart from the fact that it is the greatest circus
on earth —is a large and well-equipped concern.
It includes 70 horses; a gambling pony which
plays euchre and holds a remarkably good mouth-
ful of trumps; two clever troupes of acrobats,
trapezists, and contortionists ; a lady-rider who
does remarkable feats of horsewomanship and is
young and rather pleasant to look upon, besides ;
a number of trained monkeys; and many other
things. That well-known personage, Mr. Allan
Hamilton, manages the show.

148 Pitt-street, Sydney, and sundry new pictures
have been added for the sake of variety. A
wrestling-match by the late J. K. Emmett’s big
dog is one of the present attractions. Others are
Caicedo, the wire-walker;theblacksmith’sshop with
three men hammering on the anvil; the wrestlers
two individuals who drag each other round in many
picturesque attitudes; theinfuriated cock-fight, &c.
The kinetoscope, as a means of showing all the
particulars of an assault and battery, a football
scrum, a murderous disagreement between two
dogs, a fire, or any other stirring episode, is even
more graphic than the original performance. It
has no equal as a condensed chamber of horrors,
and has innumerable points as an educational in-
fluence, a leg-show, an art exhibition, a com-
I ressed skirt-dance, a ballet, and many other
things.

Sydney Lyceum pantomime of “Cin-
derella” comes to an end at the close of next week.
At Her Majesty’s, “ The House that Jack Built ”
is still meeting with the success it deserves, and,
in view of the large business that is doing, it will
probably last another month or two, or more. G.
Rignold’s Christmas show began well, and it keeps
improving as it goes on. Bland Holt’s “ spec-
tacular marine novelty,” at the Royal, is also
prospering on a large scale, and Mr. W. E. Baker,
the manly actor with the phenomenal voice, will
continue to get up on top of the lighthouse every
night, and ring the alarm-bell over the troubled
sea as a warning to the steamer, for an undefined
period. A photo, of this talented Australian
actor —perhaps the best all-round man the country
has yet produced—appears in this issue of The
Pulletin.

The last nights of Melb. Princess’s panto,
are already announced, although the actual retire-

for another fortnight. “Beauty and the Beast ”

Little Alma Gray, who sings of her unrequited
affection for a phlegmatic, serious-minded musi-
cian down among the orchestra, and dances with
wopderful grace, considering her inches, is an
oasis in the desert; also a baby member of the
perennial Faust Family seems to be a popular
feature of a show which, as previously remarked,
is strongest in its occasional bits of juvenile
interest.

“Aladdin,” at the Royal, continues to
pick up fresh ideas as it runs along, and the
history of last year’s success is being repeated by
Maggie Moore & Go. Widow Twankey (H. R.

disposition to comment on passing events. A
Caledonian minion of the Chinese Emperor plays
a more useful part in the business than at first,
and several polite remarks concerning Miss
Roberts and other active supporters of the lady
superior can be accepted as read. The children’s
variety display at 8 p.m. counts for a good deal.
Likewise, the popularity of the prices, which
appeal to the tenderest part of human nature, is
thoroughly well deserved.

Elton’s broad comedy, assisted by the

Elton’s legs will make their farewell appearance,
for the present, in connection with a stage foot-
bath. They have been the main support of “ The
Judge,” those two coy limbs. When Miss Clara
Thompson draws aside the Turkish towel that
curtams them and starts drying her tears upon it,
the audience is unfeignedly happy. On Saturday

Mr. and Mrs. Dacre, whose portraits are

debut at Melbourne Bijou early next month.
Amy Roselle brings with her the reputation of
being one of the most powerful actresses in
emotional characters that the present generation
has applauded, and her husband is an equally
high-class artist. During the last six years the
Daereshave been several times Mentioned as “stars”
who would arrive shortly under engagement with
Messrs. W. &M.orß. & B. Now they are really
here, or will be by the next Orient boat, accom-
panied by some new people, and as far as any
time can be right in the present state of Aus-
tralia’s finances, this is the right time for these
whole-hearted artists to make themselves fully
appreciated. It is almost settled that the Dacres
will open in “A Wife’s Ordeal,” a play written
specially for the leading lady by G. R. Sims.

The New York Life Insurance Co. has recently
had a complete audit and valuation of its securities by
the Insurance Commissioners of Massachusetts, Illinois,
and five other states of the Union. These State officials,
after a careful audit of the accounts and an examinalion
of all the various securities which go to make up the
£32,000,000 of the co.’s funds, report that there is enough
to meet all liabilities to policy-holders and other creditors,
and a magnificent surplus of £3,505,651. It would be a
good thing for Australia if the same facilities tor State
audit existed locally. A certificate of solvency from the
State auditor is worth more than dozens of certificates
from private auditors hired by the company, yet even if
an Australian society desired to submit its accounls to
public inspection in this fashion, the law provides no
method by which it can do so.

Among the petitions presented to the Victorian
Legislative Council against the Land Tax Bill were one
from the Scottish Union and National Insurance Co., one
from the Caledonian Insurance Co., one from the North
British and Mercantile Insurance Co., all of Scotland, one
from the Norwich Union Insurance Co., one from the
London Guarantee and Accident Co., and one from the
London and Lancashire Insurance Co., these three latter
being English concerns. And the Upper House solemnly
professed to regard these six English and Scotch insurance
companies, which have hardly any property—some of
them no property at all save a small bank-balance and
some office stools—in Victoria, as being the voice of the
people, to be treated with reverence accordingly!
When the Australian nation grows a little more demo-
cratic it will shunt the foreign insurance co.’s right out of
the country on the ground that they do nothing that the
local co.’s couldn’t do quite as well, and that they send
£150,000 or £200,000 a year in profits to England for which
this suffering country gets no return whatever.

The people of Toronto (Canada) have ascer-
tained that there are 40 foreign insurance companies
doing fire business in their city, aud that they send away
annually £140,000 in profits. To stop this exit of hard
cash the people are now thinking of establishing a muni-
cipal insurance department, and summarily ejecting the
foreign institutions. It is estimated that when the
salaries of 39 managers, and the rent of 39 offices, and
the expenses of 39 separate agency staffs are dispensed
with, the municipal institution will be able to reduce
rates one-half and still make a substantial profit.

The Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. (Mel-
bourne) pays a div. for the half-year at the rate of 7£ per
cent, per annum. The net profits for the six months
were £2265, and the amount received from rents and
interest on the invested funds of the shareholders was
12493. Therefore, the co., as in several previous half-
years, makes, to put it mildly, no profit on its legitimate
business, and its only real source of revenue is the interest
on its own invested capital and reserve fund.

Of the N.S.W. Treasury notes, which the Dibbs
Government issued to relieve the financial crisis of ’93,
£426 worth are still afloat, despite the fact that they
have been nominally withdrawn for a year past. It will
be interesting to learn how many of these notes fail to
come back, and are never heard of again. Considering
how very few of them were issued, the limited area in
which they were circulated, and the very short time they
were in circulation, if even £25 worth ultimately drops
out of sight it will be a sufficient proof that there is a big
source of revenue in the note-issuing business.

“ Is there any reason, is there any sense of jus-

bour, who puts £lO,OOO into Government debentures, only
pays £6 13s. 4d. (C. J. Ham, estate agent, in the Vic.

advancing £lO,OOO on unproductive land ? A bundle of
proofs of folly and roguery contains no sort of argument
against the broad land-tax principle, though it may brislle
with evidence that many Melbourne financiers should be
picking oakum instead of doing the block and hoorooing
for the Legislative Council. As well might Ham ask":
“Is there any sense of justice in taxing the income
derived from a business which only pays J per cent, on
capital, because the company which bought it was a com-
mercial swindle ?”

A N.S.W. borough council auditor sued his em-
ployers for £3O, for services performed. A lawyer cun-
ningly raised the point that the Municipalities Act did
not order that an auditor should be paid, but only per-
mitted a local body to award any fees that it might con-
sider adequate; therefore, an auditor had no power to
recover legally any amount at which he might value his
services. A Small Debts Bench bowed to the lawyer’s
contention and gave a verdict for the borough council.
Which reminds that quite recently a municipal auditor in
N.S.W. was actually fined for “resigning” his position.
The law of municipal auditing in N.S.W. seems to be a
huge joke.

The Liverpool and London and Globe Co., an
English proprietary co. doing both fire and life insurance,
has started life business in N.S. Wales within the last few
days. It is a big and most reputable concern with total
funds of over £8,000,000. The management is in England,
much too far away for any Australian policy-holder to
make any serious personal investigation into its
doings; the funds are also in England ; and the
business is wholly controlled by the shareholders, who
take what share of the profits they think fit and leave the
balance to the policy-holders. Nevertheless, the L.L. and
G. pays reasonably good bonuses, and has a respectable
reputation tor liberality—and it makes one more among
the vast array of English companies which propose to ex-
ploit Australia for the benefit of the übiquitous British
shareholder. It is also worth noting that its premiums,
with a very few exceptions, are higher than those of the
A.M.P. Society, which charges the highest rates among
the big Australasian offices. Therefore, the gap between
the premiums of the Liverpool, London and Globe, and
those of such offices as the M.L. Government Department
and the Colonial Mutual, which charge bed-rock rates, is
something considerable.

Is that abandoned shaft at Parker’s Range,
W. A., on which no work had been done for ten mouths,
identical with “the Jacoletli gold-mine” so liberally
advertised for flotation in London Daily Teleqraph of
Oct. 24? This is the shaft for the forfeiture of which J.
R. Filewood applied to the Coolgardie Warden, proving
that the labor regulations had never been complied with,
and being informed that no exemption had been granted.
Then the Warden wired to Premier John Forrest, and
received the astounding reply, “I granted exemption
personally three months ago.” And, on the strength of
this telegram, lessee Turnbull was maintained in posses-
sion by the Warden. The question was simply—Were the
goldfields regulations complied with ? Admittedly they
were not. Then why was the forfeiture not granted?

the “ advisory committee in Australia ” of “ the Jacoletti
gold-mine J. Matthew Turnbull, Alexander Forrest
(Premier Forrest’s “little brother”), John Turnbull.”

Londonderry shares, writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent by last mail, do not go over well in
the market, and at, present are at a sixteenth dis. They
are now and then “ faked up” to par, but as soon as any
of the underwriting crowd try to slip a few shares down
they slump. This will make the Wealth of Nations deal
difficult to engineer, and North and Co. will have
to be contented with a much smaller grab than they
had out of the Londonderry. A friend of mine sub-
scribed—against my strong advice—for 250 shares, as he
was told by some interested person that he would only
have a few allotted to him, but to his disgust he was
landed with the lot. So much for letters of regret. I
don’t believe that the public took £25,000 worth of shares.

An American mining journal describes North’s

for the owners of this small-area mine ; £50,000 working
capital; £354,000 in cash and shares, profits from the re-
sale of the property ; total, £700,000. These figures
must have taken the public’s breath away, for it is under-
stood that not £lOO,OOO was subscribed. The under-
writers were left with stacks of shares, and with so many
cheap scrip in the market they were soon offered at a
discount. The thing was badly manoeuvred. Taking one
consideration with another the original owners’ lot
£lBO,OOO cash and 116,000 shares, is a happy one. Their
executive partner ia/a smart financier, and has handled
his mine excellently. The Londonderry is a flittering
show, but it is circumscribed and undeveloped, and may
be worth a million or not a tenth of it.

so. Since Xmas holidays, 147 loads have been washed

consumption, and even when Adelaide was reached, no
fresh supplies were taken in. The only two kinds of meat
on board appeared to be “fresh” lamb and corned beef.
The beef could he smelt far to windward, and the lamb
was generally served half raw and not sufficiently “done ”
to destroy the maggots.

The controversy as to who was the first

Ilosking, in 1812. Thirty eight alderman have at

The just-demised Judge 0. B. Skinner
(Melb.) was an out-of-the-way man. He was
brought up as heir to one of the largest English
fortunes, but his father died of a broken heart,
after dropping his all in Venezuela silver mines,
so young Skinner had to go to work. He made a
name in India as a barrister, one of the first to
plead in a native language. Another celebrated
Skinner in India at the time, no relative, was Co).
Skinner, who had 12 native wives. C. 8., coming
to Melbourne with cash, became a useful land-

Malvern. A boom-burst drove him to accept a
county-court judgeship.
J. H. Dalziell, M.P., writes to Hogan, M.P.,
who leaves Sydney for England this week, saying
that he intends to tour Australia when the British
Parliament rises. Dalziell is one of the few men
who have risen to eminence in politics in England
straight from the position of a newspaper reporter.
He was Parliamentary representative of the
Scottish Leader, and the editor of that paper
thought he would get in front of his rival, the
Scotsman, if he had a correspondent in the
House. Accordingly the whips were asked to find
a seat for Dalziell. They found him one in Scot-
land, and he has made his mark since he has been
in the Commons. Gladstone has paid warm com-
pliments to the strenuous young Radical.
A very few months of wrestling with Vic-
toria’s finances have sufficed to shatter the nerves
and sour the temper of Premier Turner. He is
one more argument for the theory that a man
must become inured to political life and
“party” struggles in his young days if he is to
carry the responsibility of leadership without
breaking down. The “hard, common-sense”
persons who enter Parliament in their middle age,
and try to be fairly honest when they get there,
almost invariably come to physical grief if they
force themselves, or allow themselves to be
dragged into leading positions. They may sit in
the odour of politics without danger to their
health, but when they get right into the stink of
Ministerialism they soon collapse.
The late N.S. W. ex-Chief Justice Stephen,
writes an Anglo - Australian from London to
The Bulletin, used, in all cases where he thought
that he might have taken too severe a view of a
prisoner’s case, to postpone sentence until he had
consulted his wife, to whom he read the whole of
his notes of evidence. “He told this to me,” con-
tinues the correspondent, “and added: ‘ I have
many times escaped making a mistake by that
means, and I never know her to be wrong in her
judgment, which I frequently tested by enquiries
made privately. Nor did she always err on the
side of mercy, but took a just and impartial view
of every case on its merits.’ The Judge,” adds
the writer, “was occasionally severe, but he was
always conscientious. He had a theory that a
man who had committed a great offence never
reformed, and that the Discharged Prisoners’
Societies did a great deal of harm. He carefully
scrutinised the demeanour of witnesses, and
looked upon a defence supported by doubtful
evidence as a strong presumptive proof of the
guilt of the person in whose behalf it was given.
With all his faults and peculiarities, which occa-
sionally made him appear petty, he was a great
and a just Judge, and it will be long ere you look
upon his like again.”

Do you think we are going to tax our-
selves ?”— Splatt, M.L.0., Vic., 40 years ago.
Federation is now chiefly a feed-oration,
just as Separation was a sup-oration in the fifties.
Parkes, once supreme head of the “great”
N.S.W. Foreign-!ride Party, is now only its
cloven-foot.
The payment of members question has

The Sydney D.T. is not content with
blackguarding Reid, but is commencing also to
butter Dibbs. Rats ? Or is it that a daily paper
can only keep “live” by being “agen the Govern-
ment”?
Premier Turner’s accrued deficit of about
£4,000,000, which, up to date, has been met by
the misappropriation of trust-funds, means a cost
of £140,000 lor interest each year that restitution
is delayed.
R. Barr Smith, partner and brother-in-law
of Thomas Elder, is the commercial king of S.A.
He has never tried to enter Parliament, but he
has paid the expenses of more than one member
who has got there.
The Upper and Lower Houses of Parlia-
ment, all the world over, arc, says a much-married
N.S.W. politician, true pictures of married life,
the prime question in both spheres being, “Who

The opponents of the lately-passed S.A.
progressive land and absentee taxes tried, by
petition, to persuade Gov. Kintore that the Act
ought to be reserved for Imperial sanction. But
they were officially snubbed.
The one gem of oratory amidst the vapid
drivel of Vic. Leg. Council on the Land-tax Bill
came-frorn House-and-Land-agent Ham :
The bill was an “ iraplicable phenomena.” (Laughter,
and a Voice : A what?)
Mr, D. Ham (with emphasis): “An implicable pheno-
m na.” (Roars of laughter.) The bill had been drafted
by a genius of an immaculate conception. (Great laugh-
ter.)
Such are the people who throttle the democracy.
S.A. Register,
though a confirmed Tory
sheet, supported adult
suffrage right to the end.
Years ago, under Med-
way Day’s - regime, the
Register was a Radical
paper, and able articles
advocating woman’s suf-
frage were penned by
Catherine H. Spence,
that wonderful woman
who has done so much for
S.A. democracy. When
the Register pledged its
soul to Toryism, adult
suffrage was expected to
go by the board, but it
didn’t, for reasons which
will only be known on
the Day of Judgment.
Thus one of the

‘ The gars hurts me

Premier Nelson goes to the conference
of Premiers in Melbourne only because he
goes to the Federal Council in Hobart. Had
MTlwraith not vacated the seat at the Council,
Nelson would not have troubled to foregather with
Reid in Melbourne.
John MHntyre, Yic. M.L.A., thinks that
uis K.C.M.G.-ship demands a new Assembly atti-
tude. He now combines the Balfourian leg-twist
with the Harcourtian knack of balancing his bell-
topper on the bridge of his nose. Titles are awful
things to live up to.
G. D. Clark, the N.S.W. artesian bore,
bewails the fact that “ our banks are becoming
the virtual owners of grog-shops.” The banks are
also virtual owners of several sleek teetotal
apostles, and could, if they liked, shut up the
ranters as effectually as the pub. doors.
The Vic. Govt., being unable to make
terms with the P. & O. and Orient Co.’s re
freights, will shortly call for tenders for the
carriage of the province’s products to British and
other markets. This will burst up the shipping
combine, which, in grasping at too much, will
lose all.
By what process of mental somersaulting
can Premier Reid, as at last meeting with licensed
victuallers, declare that there is scarcely a law on
the N.S.W. statute-book that is not a disgrace to
the community, and in the next breath laud with
fulsome adulation the abilities and services of
Parkes ?
The Australian Tory catechism. “ What
is the M.P. who votes for Payment of Members?
A Sturdy Beggar.” “What is the M.L.O. who
votes against his own land being taxed ? A Pure
and Holy Patriot, a Champion of the People’s
Liberties, and a police patrol for the Sacred Rights
of Property.”
The explanation of the fact that land-
taxation is opposed chiefly by—in Victoria, Free-
traders, and in N.S.W., Protectionists —lies in the
fact that party politics have made Legislative
Councillors the temporary political abettors of—•
in Victoria, the Freetraders, and in N.S. Wales,
the Protectionists.
A Jap boom is now the exploiting feat
which the British pawnbroker intends to try on
Australia. London Times puts the scheme
bluntly ; “If Japan Can offer both labor and
markets to the (Australian) sugar industry, there
is no reason why it should not do the same for
other forms of agricultural production,” But
why only agricultural production?
The Australian Star defends the Vic.
Council’s rejection of the land and income-tax
with the plea that that eloquent fossil “represents
four-fifths of the community in simple numbers
and 99 per cent, probably of its educated intel-
ligence.” The Council, as it happens, represents
just 162,000 adult males out of about 350,000. If
the Star didn’t know a little tiling like that it is
a foolish and illiterate rag winch isn’t fit to
instruct the public. And if it did know it, then
it is a good and truthful paper which is sure to go
to heaven when it dies.
During one of the many retrenchment
debates in Vic. Parliament it was proposed to
abolish the Minister for Defence —the person who
looks after the standing army which isn’t there,
and considers whether the barnacles should he
scraped off the old Nelson —and the Solicitor-
General, whose business it is to stand round in a
legal capacity and say ditto to the Attorney-
General. The House decided, however, by a large
majority, to retain these two useless decora-
tions ; so the boss of the fuss - and - feathers
dep u-tmont will fly round and mobilise two mm

The Argus describes the Yic. Labor

The Municipal Council of Aberdeen (Scot-

“A coalition in the sense of a patriotic
combination of all parties to pull the country
through its troubles” is mooted by the Age, and

A week or two ago The Bulletin men-
tioned that Premier Turner was tired of his post.
He has not the soul to ruin a fine private business
for the sake of politics, and perceives that the
game is for the adventurers only. In short, he
would be glad of a decent pretence to retire, and
get back to his sarcastic legal partner, Sam

Schey, M.P. (N.S.W.), on being twitted
with his apparent inconsistency in tirading
against the issuing of free passes for the railways,
and yet applying for one for his wife, candidly
admitted the principle to be wrong, but added
that, so long as it was tolerated, he “ did not see
why he should not take the benefit of it along
with others.” It was ever thus. Those who are
most blatant in their cries for reform generally
take full advantage of existing abuses.
A possibility of £ £ Smith getting back
into the Assembly hangs over Victoria like a—
suppose we say, a rainbow in the sky. The
Mornington election—which £ £ lost by a nose, a
neck between second and third—has been declared
void, and the mercurial doctor may perhaps
regain his Paradise after all. But Bourke, who
polled only 22 votes behind Smith last time, ought
to do the trick if he tries again. Downward, the
disqualified member, has proved himself a hard-
shell Tory, whilst Bourke is the only land-taxer of
the trio.
Australian Governors are expected to keep
the Home Office apprised of all important changes
in the body politic in their charge. They conse-
quently find it necessary to occasionally state that
So-and-So’s letter to the Times merely echoes an
individual opinion, and an individual of small
consequence, to boot. Some great little men
should bear this in mind. When it came to
Parkes’ knowledge on one occasion that a N.S.W.
Governor had so communicated concerning certain
opinions of his he became unreasonably excited ;
but while Governors are imported such things
must happen.
Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat, addressing
Vic. National Scripture Education League :
The Church of Rome was doing what the other Christian
churches neglected to do—grasping hold of their children.
Why were conversions so rare amongst Roman Catholics?
Simply because their religious education was looked after
in their youth, and thus a sort of artificial conscience
was created which made them refuse to even listen to
attempts at proselytism.
It is good to know exactly what the pietists want
to bestow upon the children. Even Samuel Bal-
larat will be content when every youngster is
fitted out with an “ artificial conscience”—which,
by the way, would do credit to Voltaire as a
definition of religion.
These three petitions to the Vie. Legisla-
tive Council, asking that august Chamber to

The appointment of a .reliable auditor to

some good in Melbourne. The other day the

According to the Fat Man organs the hall was

cation, “is creating an
artificial and hollow peace,
which may some day be
shivered to a thousand
fragments by an explosion
of selfish passion.” This
is the average parson’s
apology for his miserable
existence. When he dis-
covers a country that does
not regard him as a press-
ing necessity, he either
insists that that country
is a sink of iniquity, or
prophesies that it is about
to develope all the horrors
of a combined Sodom and
Gomorrah, with up-to-date
improvements. Australians
have no faith in reverend
prophets, and few of these
latter have faith in them-
selves. Those who have, in-
variably leave the pulpit
for the stock-exchange.
Before Secretary Brunker appoints to the
N.S.W. unpaid magistracy any of the 400 or 500
applicants who now worry him for J.P.-ships, he
ought to call for the police report, now almost
completed, detailing the number of existing magis-
trates who keep public-houses or are insolvents,
By doing so he may be able to remove from the
Bench as many as he contemplates at present
appointing. It is to be hoped that the day for the
utter extermination of the entire order of honorary
justice-ship, as known in Australia, is near,
Premier Reid (N.S.W.) announced that
under his able management the unauthorised
expenditure would be limited to <£50,000 per
annum—the Dibbs Government used to spend
<£200,000. A Parliamentary return just to hand
shows that G. Reid “blewed” <£45,965 of un-
authorised expenditure in November alone, and
he has kept up this average ever since he has been
,n office. G. Reid is painfully suggestive of the
large schoolboy who is going to shift the earth as
soon as lie leaves school, and who is never heard of
again.

Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER'S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and im-
purities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines, and do riot-contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic
purgative, but operate by perfectly natural means,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural catharses without the annoyance and pain
of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of F.

TO THE HON. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, &C.
We beg to state, with deep respect,
That broken be our backs will

So “chuck ” that Bill, we humbly pray.
Signed, Three of Fat Man’s Childring.
I write from Muggerwugger shire,
And as a favor ask it—
Please put that bill upon the fire,
Or drop it in your basket.
It isn’t that I don’t agree
With Turner’s propositions;
But, here’s the point : my mortgagee
Is working up petitions.
Poor Farmer.
A busted bank-manager I,
A friend of all frauds and abuses ;
I therefore take part in the cry
Which proper taxation produces,
And state, at your urgent request,
That the sight of a land-taxing measure
Gives Capital pains on the chest,
And moves me to instant displeasure.

A delicate little misunderstanding arose
concerning the public demonstration in Adelaide
t<> bid farewell to Gov. Kintore. The Mayor con-
vened a meeting of citizens to consider the matter,
and the usual ousequious group of rich Conserva-
tives attended. They carried a resolution that
the valedictory gathering should be in the Town-
ball, and that Lieut.-Gov. Way should preside.
The Mayor, however, firmly declined to grant the
Town-hall for a public meeting of citizens unless
he was to take the chair, and the Municipal
Council loyally upheld him in his very proper
determination.

An illustration of the relative importance
of things in Australia, just now. Premier King-

see the third test cricket-match in Adelaide !

If members of Parliament may deadhead
their wives over the railway lines of Australia,
may women, when they become members, similarly
deadhead their husbands? It is to be hoped that
the first woman elected in South Australia will be
married, and will put the “ principle ’’ in practice,
so that the whole continent may obtain an oppor-
tunity of jumping to its feet and stamping the
system out o existence.

The publication of that list of free-passes,
issued to the “wives” of N.S.W. M.’sP., has
ciusedmuch gnashing of teeth. One law-maker
is credited with obtaining a pass for his “bitter-
half,” though the latter has very material evidence
to prove that on the date mentioned it was a
physical impossibility for her to leave home.
Another legislator, who was generally supposed
to be a bachelor, is now being shunned by the
hopeful girls of his acquaintance.

Delicious rigmarole from “Counterblast
to Spookland.” Dr. M‘Carthy is trying to explain
why his so-called spirit-photographs are some-
thing quite different :
“ But how do you explain it, doctor?”
“Very easily ; I had been some days previously think-
ing a good deal about my dead friend and had actually
been trying some sketches of his face which was, so to
speak, photographed on the tablets of my memory. I
had, lo he sure, forgotten all about the face during the
seance, hut the idea was taken from subliminal conscious-
ness telophatically and spontaneously by the sensitive,
when I was in the best condition for such an occurrence,
that is to say non-expectant. It was then proj cted and
objectified (materialised) under subtle sympathetic in-
fluence by means of the psychoplasm proceeding from the
body of the sensitive, but the fiaure was a mere automaton,
hearing temporary life manifestations from the medium,
and was in no way connected with the spirit of my
departed friend. It was simply an evolved thought-form,
taking on certain characteristics in facial expression, &c.,
through sympathetic force, and materialised through the
medium’s special power.”
Hjw charmingly explicit!
# • •
“A Counterblast fco Spookland ” will not
be very pleasant reading for Mr. T. S. Henry, the
head and front of the Mellon spook-exposure,
whose “treachery to the cause” which be formerly
loved is made the subject of much unkind ridicule.
There are also pictures of an individual, presum-
ably Mr. Henry, gliding like a snake in the grass
into the holy affections of “Josephine,” together
with a poem to the same lady, written by Mr.
Henry in his raw and credulous days ; and another
picture showing a wild man, also presumably Mr.
Henry, digging in Dr. M'Carthy’s back-yard for
the imaginary body of a foully-murthered citizen.
Altogether, the spooks score heavily.

This is the season at which the mailbags of
each Australian Ministry are stuffed with letters
recommending the appointment of Prominent
Citizen, Esquire, of Everywhere, as J.P. Con-
sidering the present brand of that gentleman, how
ho sprouts, and that it would he scarcely possible
to find a worse job-lot of him, and considering
also the present hard-up-ness of all the Australian
Treasuries, would it be a good or a bad idea to
license Jaypees? Let every man who has an
ambition to retail so-called Justice send in his
application, accompanied by a specified fee, and
take his chance. If even the small degree of care
were taken with respect to such applicants that is
taken with regard to applicants for liquor-victual-
ing, hawkers’, tobacco, milk, or other licenses, the
odds would be in favor of a better average Jaypee
being struck than by the present method of
nomination as a reward for political (that is,
party) services rendered. -And if penalties were
provided for the commission of offences which
might be comprehensively scheduled under some
such generic term as “ unjaypee-like conduct,”
petty “Justice” as she is now scandalised might
be improved upon. “The Great Unpaid ” would
at least give place to the Great Paying-for-the-
honor.

A story of life and death. In Victorian
public life there was a certain undertaker. One
day, while he stood at a festive board surrounded
by notables, their champagne-glasses raised aloft,
a telegram was slipped into his bands. It was
from his wife, who, in his absence, attended to
the details of the business, and ran thus : “ Can’t
get Smith into coffin, his knees are stiff —what
shall we do ?” The undertaker set down his glass,
turned up the corner of the telegram, and wrote
with a stumpy pencil, “ Cut his sinews.” It
was done. Such is life. You can’t always tell
what a man is thinking of when he flourishes his
glass and drinks your very good health.
A woman’s great mission in life is to make
her dress hang straight, and to keep her pocket
from bulging and spoiling the look of things; con-
sequently when she has any luggage to carry she
has to stow it about her person in all sorts of un-
expected places where it won’t stick out. On a
recent Saturday night a Sydney lady, with a
bottle of medicine in her stocking, fell while run-
ning after a tram, and drove the broken bottle so
effectually into her system that she had to be
taken to the hospital to have it extracted. Also,
the medicine got into her wounds and contusions,
and aggravated things considerably. A month
earlier another lady who had bestowed a bottle of
scent in the bosom of her dress, fell out of an
omnibus, and eight pieces of scent-bottle had to
be picked out of her snowy bust with tweezers.
Woman will never be the equal of man until she
has ten pockets in different parts of her clothes
and can find them without walking round herself
six times and then retiring to her bedroom and
undressing herself to look for them.

The bankruptcy of “So-and-so, gentle-
man,” is wired from Brisbane. “Gentleman!”
old Judge Noel, of Melb. Bankruptcy Court, used
to exclaim when his eye spotted this designation
on a schedule. “Gentleman! gentleman!” And
glaring around the solicitors’ table in search of the
assignee he would say, “ Call him a man !” Poor
old Moel didn’t believe a man without money could
be a gentleman, and as far as in him lay tried to
set the world right on the subject.
* * *
Coroner Youl, of Melbourne, who is grow-
ing old, and isn’t able to go and “view the body”
with the agility of former years, wishes to have
this ancient formula dispensed with altogether.
Considering, however, that the jury goes and
view's the body with the very reasonable object of
making quite sure there is a body, the force of
logic goes w ith the old system, and the probabili-
ties are that the jury will go and see the remains
as of old. Coroner Ghoul, as ah'eady mentioned,
is getting old, and his work grows no lighter.
Last year’s Melb. morgue statistics included 38
suicides, 125 accidental deaths, 8 wilful murders,
25 infanticides, 26 found-deads, 4 manslaughters,
4 executions, 1 justifiable homicide, and 74 myste-
rious deaths among infants. A man with such a
year’s work as that might well grow tired of view-
ing the body.
* * *
The long-windedness of legal processes is
exemplified in the investigation into the Awhina-
Princess collision in Poit Jackson. The parties
to this collision will, before all is over, have to
appear before a coroner’s court, a police court, a
Marine Board and a Supreme Court, the whole or
almost the whole of the evidence being gone over
anew before each Bench. Afterwards there may
be civil actions, which will also call for the bulk
of the same witnesses with the same statements.

Applicants for a N.S.W. country editor-
ship, lately vacant, were invited to “ state reli-
gious beliefs.” One out-at-elbows pressman
replied: “My journal is my religion—while the
ghost walks.” The journal in question isn’t his
religion, so far.

Sydney D.T., of Doc. 25, prints an absurdly
tall account of the scholastic exploits of a certain
lady who lately returned to Sydney with British
medical qualifications. Whatever the lady’s
British diplomas may be (they are given as
Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, London,
and L.R.C.P. and S., Glasgow) it would appear
that she did not also graduate at Sydney Uni-
versity, though from the Telegraph’s account the
contrary might easily be inferred. In printing its
story about the doctress in question being the
“ first N.S.W. lady to graduate with high honors
in England ” the Telegraph pays a very poor
compliment to the girls who stayed in their own
country and successfully faced, not a mere three
years’ curriculum, but one of the most arduous
and comprehensive five-years’ courses of study in
the world.
# • •
The flock of a parson, who has of late been
distinguishing himself, have long since ceased to
ask each other, “Are you going to church?”
Instead, they simply inquire, “ Are you going to
hear about Adam and Eve?” Try how lie will,
that poor parson can’t keep the fable of our spare-
clad ancestors out of his sermons. Seized
with the beauty of the story’s simplicity, especi-
ally in the matter of costumes, he (so goes
the story) a short time back attired himself in
nothing in particular, and started a Garden of
Eden in his own backyard, himself in the rdle of
Adam. He kept hard at it for some days, when he
began to feel lonely, so he tried to induce his wife,
whom he called Eve, to come and keep him com-
pany in his Eden, She refused and threatened
to call the police ; but even the wild incongruity
of a policeman in the Garden failed to startle the
unhappy parson back to his senses.
* # #
That barbarous institution, a “surprise-
party,” was lately tendered to a Sydney pawn-
broker, who, ere allowing the guests to take
possession, exacted from them 10s. cash for the
use of the room. It takes a Melchisedec or a
Cohen to rise to such occasions.

A Melb. Presbyterian clergyman of un-
doubted piety (and venom), advocates bicycling
for girls, because bicycling has made the ’Murkan
girl “stronger in body, clearer in mind, and purer
inspirit.” The “ meenister ” has in preparation
a sermon called “To Heaven on a Bicycle.” The
rev. gentleman doesn’t say wh her it is possible
for a girl to go to glory in knickerbockers.
« * *
N.S.W. educational system provides for
Godliness but not for cleanliness; it allows the
parson to upset the arrangement of the classes by
giving, once a week, instruction in his particular
brand of religion to a mere handful out of each
class in the school, but it leaves such a small
matter as the pupils’ cleanliness to the care of the
teachers, who frequently need to supply soap and
towels out of their own pockets. By the way,
teachers complain that the visiting parson’s hope-
less failure to turn tip at the appointed time
greatly interferes with the carrying out of the
school’s regulation programme.

The “unemployed” at Shea’s Creek
(Sydney) Govt, relief works are only, in future,
to get one week’s work in every five in lieu of
one week in four, as hitherto. By the way, a
“leading” Sydney dady lately printed an article
concerning the works, from a special reporter,
setting forth the artifices used by the unemployed
in their eagerness to get more than the regulation
share of work. One poor wretch who had read in
the papers that a man employed at the works had
been injured and had gone to the hospital, promptly
put in an appearance and, impersonating the
disabled man, took his place in the gang and did
his work. But he was found out and got no pay.
Shaving and assuming another name; begging the
work-tickets of their mates who were ill or had
had the luck to get other and more remunerative
employment—these tricks, and many others, were
recounted in the special article of a newspaper
which daily says, or insinuates, that “the un-
employed don’t want work !”

Vic. detective Lomax, who died suddenly
last week, figured in the Vic. Missing Mace en-

Lomax for confirming “a libellous rumour in a
scandalous foreign newspaper,” but, somehow, the
worthy man didn’t get called upon for an apology.

Dear Bulletin, —As an etymologian,
“Worry M.” has a tendency towards the far-
fetched. For instance—“ Gone bung.” “Wurry’s”
billabong idea won’t do. “ Gone bung ” means
“burst up.” When a Chinese cracker bursts it
“ goes bung ! ! !” “ Push ” is derived by inference
from “crowd,” in connection with which “ push-
ing ” is inseparable. A gang of larrikins “pushes”
its way along a path, jostling pedestrians as it
goes. “Bart,” from “barter,” being applied to
“one who barters ” her charms. It is not larri-
kinese, but English “flash.” Here are a few
additional derivations of interest; —“Mnlty,”
from “ moulty,” as applied to birds ; “ tart,” from
“sweetheart,” the terminal t of “sweet” being
contracted with “heart,” illustrating a tendency
well-known to philologists, as in English “a nag,”
from Danish “an og,” a horse. Finally, here are
four for solution :—“Kybosh,” “nark,” “grig,”
and “quid” (a pound). —P.M.

Dear Bulletin, The Japs on the
Northern plantations are treated much better
than white folks. For instance, on A plan-
tation the men all get black sugar—sometimes so
bad that you can see the molasses running out of
the bag. The Japs stood this for a week or two;
then, seeing that the co. was making white sxxgar
in the mill, they struck work, and did not resume
until they got best white sugar. The whites are
still using the molasses. The Japs are not to be
sneezed at as far as holding out for their rights is
concerned. - S UGA r Miner. Mackay, Q,, Dec. fi.
# # ♦
Attempts are being made to explain the
numerous Mackay (Q.) murders on the vendetta
principle. In the New Hebrides a tribesman’s
death demands a tribesman’s death. All white
men (to the Kanaka understanding) are of one
tribe. It is possible, then, that the Mackay
outrages are simply acts of vengeance for the
many hitherto unavenged murders by blackbirders
visiting the islands.

Chemists and grocers up North are at
loggerheads. The chemists are retailing tea (on
which they make a handsome profit) by way of
retaliation on the grocers, who have been vending
patent medicines at “ ridiculously cheap prices.'’
“Ridiculously cheap,” in the druggists’ lexicon,
probably means anything less than 200 per cent,

The wicked action of N.S. W. Government
in permitting unwholesome liquor to go out of
bond gets forcible comment from the Licensing
Guardian. Next day, perhaps, an ignorant publi-

duty of 14s. per proof gallon, is the real gainer
through the scandalous transaction.

The Australasian gives a series of illus-
trations of a rational-dress picnic that went from
Mel I lourne into the leafy wilderness recently. A
casual survey of the ladies’ “ knickers ” shows that
they must be bad things to sit on a bull-ant in.

One of the saved saloon passengers of the
Wairarapa gave a little thanksgiving picnic to a
few Sydney friends the other Sunday. The party
proceeded in a steam-launch from Circular Quay
to a quiet spot in Middle Harbor, where pulling-
boats awaited them. Everything passed off well
till they were returning, when it was found that
one of the boats leaked so badly that it had to be
abandoned. As the sculls had mysteriously dis-
appeared from another, the remaining boat had
to tow the whole party back to the steamer, which
the picnickers boarded after nothing worse than
the incident of a lady falling into the water and
being rescued by two gentlemen. But their
troubles were not quite over. As the tender
rounded Middle Head a stiff “southerly ” sprang
up, and when they stepped ashore at the Quay,
almost wet through, they fervently vowed they
would never again accept the hospitality of a
saved shipvvreckite.

Sydney unemployed were refused the
Town Hall to meet in, but, to justify the Mayor,
the daily papers had to publish the resolutions at
length and anathematise them. So the agitators
gained fuller publicity than their meeting would
have received, and they ran no risk of being
jugged as anarchists!

excuse is :“ We can’t help it. We sinned ignor-

Garden Island, in Sydney harbor, the fruit-
ful source of bickering between naval authorities
and aesthetic citizens, never really belonged to the
people. A Government order, issued in 1841,
directed that the island was to be considered a
part of Government House domain, and that all
the growth and produce Of the island, whether
timber or grass, was to be appropriated to the
exclusive use of the Governor’s establishment.
Fines and other punishments were inflicted for
wanton trespass.

in, three shops and two houses badly damaged,
one sehoolhouse perforated, one chimney knocked
down, one badly-scared gunner, one probable

pleasure here and there and everywhere, is the girl who
marries first.”

Ab Deeringullen, near Goulburn (N.S.W.),
a dog dropped upon the canvas of a buckeye
reaper-and-binder that was being worked in a
harvest field. Before anybody could interfere,
the dog was carried by the elevators to the binding-
table, tied up in a sheaf of wheat, bound and
tossed out ! When the sheaf was unfastened, the
dog walked stupidly out, quite unhurt.
Father Curran, the geologist, was lately
nominated for a fellowship at St. John’s R.O.
College, Sydney. A certain Dean was marched
out to oppose him, but finding that the geologist
was bound to go in with a big majority the Dean
retired. However, the church has a say in the
matter, and it appears to have been arranged that
the Dean is to “get there just the same,” whether
the graduates like it or not.
Samuel Deering, late assistant - Agent-
General for S. A., got his C.M.G. on New Year’s
Day by “working the Colonial Office.” The
Kingston Govt, feel very wroth with him because
he threw up his position and claimed compensa-
tion just when the late John Bray’s illness was
most acute, and when the services of Deering
were most needed in London. Some criticisms
by the S. A. Assembly as to the cost of the Agent-
General’s office, and a characteristically brutal
threat by then Treasurer Play ford to retrench
him, are supposed to have piqued Deering, who
on retirement was entitled to eight months’ leave
on full pay and a solatium of .£2400. So it came
about that for runny weeks the S.A. Agent-
General’s office was left to the mercies of a clerk.
Dear Bulletin,— -Your paragraph re George
Grey and the fussy bush storekeeper seems to have
been “made to order,” as Grey, so far as I am
aware, never attempted to address the Maoris in
their own language. So far from being the best
speaker among the M.L. white population, he had
but a very imperfect acquaintance with the Maori
language—a knowledge acquired mainly through
intercourse with half-castes of the native race. I
remember hearing Grey about 14 years ago ad-
dressing a Maori meeting at the Karainu, a settle-
ment in Hawkes Bay, and he spoke in English,
John White having to act as interpreter for him.
This White was one of our best Maori scholars,
and ab that time was editor of a Maori news-
paper (the WhakaWhaka), published in Hawkes
Bay. Even Donald M’Lean, who was the most
prominent Native Minister, and best Maori
speaker in any Government, did not venture to
address in the Maori language the large and im-
portant gathering of natives held at Ngarua-
whaia, in the Waikato, just previously to Governor
Bowen’s departure. He spoke in English.—Yours,
&c., Huia.
[Grey, in the preface to his book, “Polynesian Mytho-
logy, ’’ states that he commenced the study of the Maori
language prior to 1850, so that he might Psten to the
petitions of the natives in their own tongue. W. H.
Taipara, the great chief of the Thames natives, once told
the writer that Grey, Dr. Shortland, and James Mackay,
junior, were the only Europeans who could speak fluently
the old classic language, as it was spoken before its
corruption by the introduction of English words, and
Wetere te Rerenga paid him a similar compliment,
although the Ngatimaniapoto chief noticed that the
great Pro-Consul’s korero had the accent of the Ngapuhi,
a northern tribe. Moreover, Grey has often fluently
addressed the native c hiefs without the intervention of an
interpreter. On most official occasions, however, Grey
would speak through an interpreter for the benefit of the
reporters.—Ed. B.j
It is just as well to hear both sides of a
story. In reference to alleged rioting at Greta,
N.S.W., the manager of the local colliery says :
The Greta miners are using all sorts of threats, tearing
boards out of houses, carrying firearms. He and Sergt.

The Mayor of Greta says :
The men working the colliery have repeatedly
threatened to come to town and fight the unionists to a
finish. Fourteen of them marched up High-street with
their right hands clutching revolvers, closely followed bv
a number of policemen. . . . Nasty, filthy remarks
uttered by the invaders caused great excitement ”
Now, the question is-Wha? was the ,t„t y of the
police following those fourteen men ? Clearly, to
lock up the whole of them if the Mayor’s story is
true. Apparently those most needing protection
are not the fourteen pistoleers.

pelled to pay for the State education of other people's
children 1” Neither, probably, do you see why you
should have to pay for police to keep other men’s de-
scendants in order, and for gaols to put them in, and
Judges to try them, and a hangman to hang them. If it
is right to make every man pay for the compulsory educa-

bill for the hanging of his own son. ..Geo. A.: Hardly

Ernest Hosking, the versatile spook-exposer, has been suc-
cessfully touring northern Victoria and Deniliquin with a
young lady illusionist as his assistant. Too much
spookery beginning to pall on the audiences, he added
ventriloquism and musical olios to his repertoire.
His assistant, described as a handsome, curly blonde,
helped the show along with clairvoyant tricks and memory
tests. She used to run the same show with Oscar Smith,
another ventriloquist.
_ Nina Boucicault, who is playing in "The Case of Rebel-

outj of the Austral Salon, Melbourne, and gives a most

twang.
Mrs. Edouin Bryer will leave for London on an interest-
ing mission on 7th Feb. She has been playing in Aus-
tralia for upwards of 43 years, and was under engage-
ment to Coppin for 23 years. She was engaged at the
old Haymarket, Bourke-st. E., Melb.; at the Lyceum,
Lonsdale-st. (now a livery stables): and at the old Melb.
Rojal.
Although Maggie Moore was quite agreeable to play for
Mrs. Edouin Bryer’s farewell benefit, Mr. Coppin
objected. “ Because,” said he, “ Maggie Moore is
‘ billed ’ to make her farewell appearance in ‘Aladdin,’
and, therefore, I can’t allow her to play for this benefit.”
Some people aver that the veteran was annoyed because
Mrs. Bryer consulted Maggie Moore first.
Amy Roselle’s one-night performance of Lady Macbeth
with Irving’s company, is historic in the purfesh. It was
at Birmingham, where the great Henry was playing his
short annual season, that Ellen Terry became “very
seriously indisposed” and retired from the cast with the
apparent intention of resting for some considerable time.
Amy Roselle filled the breach, and her representation of
the Thane’s terrible spouse was so magnetic that it cured
Ellen’s complaint in three hours. She had no more ner-
vous attacks until a weaker "understudy ” was provided
in the Roselle’s stead.
One of the satin-attired fairies at Melb. Royal panto, is
referred to by Aladdin as “ a white spirit,” whereupon
she retorts: “Yes, I am the very best square gin 1 ”
Happily, however, Melb. is ignorant of the slang of the
far North.
The supers, on in the last scene at Melb. panto, pleaded
hard that the chill should be taken off the water into
which they are plunged. The management, however,
elevated its eyebrows at their audacity, and hinted
that the two-shilling-a-nighters ought to be very
glad of a cheap bath. This Melb. summer has, so far,
been like an average October.
Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat, wrote to the local hospital
committee expressing grave disapproval of the proposal
to ask Girly Yarmouth to skirt-dance in aid of the funds
of the institution. Some heathen suggests that the

The willowy Bernhardt’s latest is to wear a live falcon

A London correspondent: It has been decided that
Beerbohm Tree will re-open the Haymarket with “ John-
A-Dreams,” after his return from ’Murka. He is now
turning away money—and big money, too—nightly, much
to Haddon Chambers’ delight. The play would fill
Covent Garden or Drury Lane.
It is refreshing for the two English actresses who

The committee of Melb. Distressed Actors’ Fund, after
making necessary additions and improvements to the
Homes and putting aside sufficient to keep the inmates
for 12 months, has given away close on £4OO during the
last six months in cash to deserving and hard-up members
of the profession. The total cost of this distribution has
been £2 Bs. for advertising for applications.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent by last mail:—
“ The Dacres sailed by the Oruba for Melbourne, where
they will join Elton in a kind of co operative theatrical
venture, under the aegis of Wilson, of the Bijou. Elton
writes hopefully of their prospects, and everybody wishes
them well, as they have been very badly treated by certain
individuals. They have a very fine repertory, including
a new play by G. R. Sims, from which they expect great
things. They take with them two pretty and clever young
ladies, better known in the Provinces than on the
London boards, who will play minor parts. I am sure
you will like the Dacres. Mrs. Dacres (Amy Roselle) is
too well-known to require any eulogy at my hands. She
is certainly one of our very best all-round actresses. Her
husband is a capital fellow and a capable actor, whose
handsome appearance alone is almost enough to carry off
any part he undertakes. Full of bonhommie, he is liked
wherever he goes. A very large party of friends
assembled at the station to wish them bon voyage and
good luck. The Savage Club mustered in full force
last night at a real “send-off” supper to Dacre.
It was one of the most pleasant evenings we have
had there for some time. Australia was well represented
by Mackennal, Alfred Dampier, J. Longstaff, Fry, of
Tasmania, Pilcher, Q. 0., of Sydney, Lett, Henniker
Heaton and others, including Phil. May, who is looked
upon as half an Australian now. Arthur Dacre, by the
way, is not alone a mummer—he is a not undistinguished
member of the medical profession, and gave up a good
practice to follow his fancy for the stage.”
Arthur Bourchier’s marriage to Miss Violet Vanbrugh,
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, took place
at a High church at Earl’s Court, and was quite a
smart affair. Bourchier is a “somebody” by birth,
but a wooden actor. His wife is a daughter of the late
Prebendary Barnes, of Exeter. She is a charming
daughter of a charming mother. They are both great
friends of Mrs. “Jack” Purves, at whose residence I had
the pleasure of making their acquaintance. The most
conspicuously-dressed woman at the wedding was Mrs.
Bernard Beere, who wore a gown of white serge with any
amount of braid, a most expensively-embroidered black-
velvet cloak, the whole topped by a huge hat of many
trimmings. Picture this to yourself, Sappho Smith 1
Debrett was well represented at the function.
The Daily Post, the new Sydney Labor
organ, is published at last in the face of enormous
difficulties ; and while there is nothing very bril-
liant about it thus far, it has so much room for
useful work that The Bulletin cordially hopes
the venture may succeed.
The point raised as to the illegality under
the present statute of paying N.S.W. members of
Assembly is a miserable lawyers’ quibble. If pay-
ment is not technically legal Parliament intended
it to be so and will very soon make it so. The
point is apparently to be used by Mr. Tom Slat-
tery’s friends as an advt. for his law-business.
Rumor now credits Premier Turner with
meaning to drop the land-tax altogether and re-
introduce the income-tax, with exemption to
.£2OO. This is expected to yield £200,000, which
it probably won’t ; and with £lOO,OOO more
knocked off municipal endowment, £178,000 worth
more retrenchment in the railway, postal, and
defence departments, and £35,000 gained by re-
taining the primage duties, the unfortunate
Minister hopes to make ends meet. And the Vie.
Fat Man, having successfully shifted the respon-
sibility from his own shoulders, sits and chuckles
serenely.
MTI wraith is off to England again, retain-
ing his seat in Queensland Parliament and his
place in the Ministry. For over a year he has
never set foot in the House; he has given no
assistance to the Government; yet no one has
been found to deny that he still draws his salary
regularly, without doing a tittle to earn it.
The papers which continually comment on the
greediness of Labor-members in taking pay (after
working for it) might found a profitable homily
on this.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
After more or less narrowly losing the
first two out of the five test matches, the com-
mon impression wgs that Australia would crumble
away again in the third match also, and that the
Englishmen having thus won the rubber all interest in
the proceedings would vanish there and then. Instead
of this Australia suddenly rose up and demonstrated
once more the glorious uncertainty of cricket by
winning with 382 runs to spare. Australia made
238 in the first innings and 411 in the second. Gregory
didn’t come off either time, his combined scores only
amounting to 26. In the first innings, Giffen (58), H.
Trott (48), Callaway (41), and A. E. Trott (38), were top
scorers. The second innings consisted mainly of Iredale’s
score of 140, Bruce (80), and A. E. Trott (72). The
Englishmen's first innings totalled 124—Brown (39)
and M‘Laren (25) being top scorers. Ford (21) and
Briggs and Brockwell (12 each), were the only others
who got into double figures. In their second innings
M'Laren (35), Stoddart (34) and Brockwell (24) were the
only notable features, and the rest was mostly blanks and
desolation. Under these unexpected circumstances some
sanguine Australians are already beginning to reckon on
this country winning the rubber, after all.
• • » «
The match between N.S.W. and S.A., at
Adelaide, was chiefly remarkable for the small scores, as
the wicket was first-class. When N.S.W. fell for 192 on
the Saturday several S.A. sports backed S.A. to win with
an innings to spare, and one wealthy Adelaidean lost
nearly £lOO in this way.
• ♦ « •
George Gi Sen’s average of 16 wickets for 186
runs against N.S.W. on a batsman’s wicket, is a perform-
ance without parallel in Australian first-class cricket.
Giffen clean-bowled most of his victims, including Moses,
in each innings. Moses was dubious about his form when
Giffen bowled him for 13 in the first innings, but at the
second venture he baited as well as ever, and when hs
went out Blackham, Trott and Turner worried him about
the test-match for over an hour. A. H. Jarvis’ 98, not
out, was made by beautiful cricket, marred by one
chance ; and Jarvis was very cut-up when Jones made a
wild swipe and robbed the wicket-keeper of his chance.
Jarvis has never made 100 in first-class cricket. Callaway
was the best N.S.W. bowler and got valuable wickets.
Lyons was again a comparative failure ; in fact, he seems
to be getting rapidly “ out of print.”
* ♦ • •
Cricket patriotism doesn’t seem to run wild in
Melbourne. A topical verse in the Royal panto., stating
that Australia intended to win the next three “teat”
matches, met with a rather supercilious reception last
week.
* • * •
The Englishmen back themselves in each test-
match, and some of their play suggests that they have
wagers in their eye.
* • • *
E. T. Smith wagered Lyons .£5O to nothing
he would not make 50 against N.S.W. in the first innings,
and laid him £1 to nothing about every run over that
number. Lyons made 47. The same offer was made in
the second innings. Lyons made 7.
* * ♦ •
S.A. Advertiser describes Trumper, the
N.S.W. junior, as a “ typical Comstock 1"
» * * •
It rained heavily in Adelaide two days before
the N.S.W. match, whereupon caretaker Checkett
covered the wicket with galvanised iron and canvas,
banked with sawdust, and the result was a perfect bats-
man’s wicket instead of a mudheap. Experientia docet I
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Walter Giffen is the mystery of S.A. cricket.
Against England he failed in both innings, but (he selec-
tion committee picked him against Vic., and he failed
again ; nevertheless, he was selected against N.S.W. to
make a third failure. Geo. Giffen is not on the selection
committee, and the S.A. public are asking why Wally is
continually picked, and good players like Bennett, Green,
and Richards overlooked.
* • ♦ *
The Australian public want to know what
particular brand of hair-dye a certain Australian crioketer
is advertising.
• • • *
Business, it was at first said, and not fear of his
leg again collapsing, precluded the ever-reliable Moses
from taking part in the third test-match. Anyhow, no
one named Moses ever lets cricket, or anything else, inter-
fere with business.
• • • •
What other game can hold a candle to cricket
for luck ? A Stanbury, a Charley Samuels, a Peter Jack-
son, or a Carbine, if “ well,” must make a good showing
against an opponent, even if beaten. If, at any fportion
of the contest, they make a mistake they have a chance
of retrieving their position ; but in cricket, if a man errs
in the first over, which he is perhaps more likely to do
than in the hundredth, he is snuffed out for good. Take
Sid. Gregory’s two innings of 201 and 2, or Stoddart’s 170
odd and las instances. At what other game would it be
possible for a first-class man to show such a woeful dis-
parity-let the weather or track be what it might?
• » * *
Is it a coincidence only that the Englishmen, in
the three test-matches, should have the worst of the deal
in the first innings ?
♦ * * *
It must much surprise the candid friends of lob-
bowler Humphreys to learn that his is the best bowling
average of the team so far in all matches (not including
the Adelaide one). His 43 wickets cost 13-15 runs apiece;
while Brockwell comes next with 14-9, and Peel (17 - 3),
Briggs (18-45), Richardson (20-13), and Lockwood (50-9)
follow as named. In eleven a-sida matches Peel is easily
first.
• • * •
Carnage is nominated for the Newmarket and
Australian Cup, which looks as though Mr. W. R. Wilson
has hopes of getting his handsome rogue to do his best
again.
• * * «
Paris is not entered for either the Newmarket
or Australian Cup, as it is really intended to ship him to
England. The people who excused Ringmaster’s defeats
by saying that he was a second-rater in Australia, cannot
say the same if Paris goes down.
* * * *
There were only seven Sydney entries for the
Australian Cup at V.R.C. Autumn Meeting. The New-
market flutter has a batch of 19 Sydneyites engaged,
Ruenalf, Pilot Boy, and Solanum being the only ones set
down for both events.
* * * ♦
Handicapper Scarr (who is finally retiring) drew
out the handicaps for last Saturday’s Warwick Farm
meeting, but asked the club secretary not to say who the
handicapper was. The handicap was duly posted up, but
without Mr. Scarr’s initials as usual. Owners and trainers
drew round and criticised the imposts, and one of the
principal trainers remarked that owners would never
stand that sort of handicapper, whoever he was. And
when Mr. Oatley informed them that that handicapper
was Mr. Scarr, there was a collapse. The little joke only
goes to show that if the man to be appointed is even the
veteran’s equal as a handicapper, the ‘‘clever ” division
intends to blackguard him as a matter of course.
One thing is very certain. The associated clubs
should fight shy of any man who is anxiously wanted,
and whose application is “ boosted ” by any remarkably
astute stable. The advocacy of the latter should at once
damn its protege’s chance.

An Australian in London to The Bulletin, by
last mail: Peter Jackson donned the mittens for the first
time since his return from the States, at the Sporting
Club, last Monday evening. His opponent was David St.
John, who recently fought a game fight with a fellow-
Welshman named O’Brien (not a very Welsh name). O
course, it was merely an exercise canter for Peter, who
showed all his tine science, and seems none the worse for
his long idleness. Frank Slavin is to have a send-off ben.
at one of the big halls, when he will have a few rounds
with Joe Steers, the amateur champion. Steers is a
blacksmith, and a very line, hard-hitting boxer, but I’d
like to see George Seale, of Sydney, in the ring with him
for 20 min. Slavin is going to Johannesberg. Steers, by
the way, has not a very high opinion of the British
middle-weight boxers, and is willing to put his notion to
the test, as he offers to fight either Ted Pritchard, Craig,
“the Coffee Cooler” (so named from his dark hide), or
Ted White, the erst amateur champion, now a profes-
sional, at the Nat. Sporting Club, for any sum put up by
that institution, he to take a trophy if he wins, his
opponent to take cash. It is likely that White will accept
the gage of battle. If the affair comes off it will equal in
interest any of the fights between the big-wigs. Clark
has accepted the challenge, but the N.S.C. has a word to
say in the matter, and that word has not been spoken at
time of writing. The Coffee Cooler, aforesaid, has been
matched against Pritchard. Before the Pritchard-Burga
affair he announced that he would fight the winner, as he
did not believe in tackling either of the two men until it
proved which was the better. Altogether boxing is look-
ing up again in this effete old land.
• • * •
Rowing, says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, will take a start again after the Sullivan-Hard-
ing race, as Mr. Harding is an ambitious lad, and doesn’t
mind giving a bit of weight away. If Stanbury came to
England he would find some one to tackle him I feel sure,
especially if the “ bantam ” should happen to lick Sulli-
van. He might do worse than try a trip. Surely .his
friends would raise the required funds ?

Sydney Press 0.0., playing the School-Teachers’
0.C., raised the hopes of their admirers by making 25 runs

’ The Melb. ready-money starting price “ books ”
got a bad Jolt over the win of Pickles at Maribyrnong
last week. There were only six starters in the race, and
although the betting opened at 6 to 4 it closed at 10 to 1.
'Cos why ? No “ heads ” were backing him on the course.
He won, and the parties who backed him in town won
some hundreds at 10 to 1, but even that amount has
shaken some of the ap. merchants up so much that they
are asking time.
Latest Centralian grievance, A Rock-
hampton paper tells how a requisition was sent to
Brisbane for a dozen lead-pencils for Custom-
hpuse_ use. And the Southern authorities sent up
six with a reprimand for extravagance.
No wonder that cruel assaults by the
police upon citizens are common when the
offenders know they may wreak their rage or spite
with impunity. At Newtown (Sydney) Police-
court this week, before Mr. Giles, S.M., Francis
Young (overseer of works for the borough of
Newtown), J. Howard (contractor), T. Lincoln
(farrier), and J. Eyles (news-agent), witnesses
whose credibility is not challenged, deposed
that a constable brutally assaulted a man
named James Slade, whom he wished to
arrest. Slade’s only apparent offence was sitting
on the steps of the Town Hall at 8 a.m, ; but it is
alleged the police have “a down’’ on him, and
the constable, in arresting him, according to
the four above-named witnesses, threw Slade
down, put his knee on the back of Slade’s head,
and “rubbed Slade’s face into road-metal,”
inflicting serious wounds. The defence was the
constable’s simple denial of violence; and the
magistrate, in effect, told Slade’s four witnesses
they were liars, affirming that Slade was “ a flash
fellow and a thoroug-h scoundrel,” and had brought
the violence upon himself. Another case, heard
before the same magistrate, was just as flagrant-
looking an instance of police savagery, yet, as
usual, the magistrate sided entirely with the
constable concerned. As the citizens of Sydney
want to be able to respect the police and to assist
them in maintaining order, the authorities had
better take instant steps to prevent men with
violent tempers from wearing police-uniform and
carrying arms. It will also be necessary to
appoint to the Bench police-magistrates capable of
dispassionately weighing evidence and of giving
due value to the oaths of reputable civilians.
Holdsworfch, Macpherson & Co., the well-
known Sydney ironmongers, held a big picnic
la,st week to celebrate the opening of their splen-
did new premises in George-street, which effectu-
ally lay over anything in the ironmongery line
in Australasia. The firm dates hack as far as the
Waterloo year, and after much success and a few
vicissitudes it starts 1895 with the determination
to deserve all the patronage that the public can
give it. The firm claims its stock to be the best
and largest south of the equator.

Ed. Bulletin, —My definition ; The poet
is the mouthpiece of his age speaking to all time.
—-Flufey.
The young King of Tonga, though only 19
years of age, is a recluse and a failure. He fears
assassination, writes a Bulletin correspondent,
a.id annexation, and his palace is guarded night
aid day. lie never goes outside the enclosure,
and two officers of guards sleep in his bedroom.
His Majesty (who spends most of his time playing
bagatelle with his secretary and coachman) was to
have prorogued the Tongan Parliament in Oct.
last. Invitations w ;re sent to the Consuls and
foreign r.-sidents, and a large crowd mustered; but
no King appeared, the speech from the throne
King read by his father, Tuibeleaki. The only
foreigner who has free access to the palace is Rev.
Jabez Watkin, his spiritual adviser.
A painter hal a Govt, contract, and was
much harried by the inspector. When the job
was completed according to specification, the
officer was a deed for a final certificate. He
pointed out that the iron spouting and pipes had
not been painted, and was referred to the specifi-
cations. Finding the items omitted, the con-
tractor was asked for a price, and said £ 5. As the
job was only worth 305., the inspector demurred,
until it was pointed out that the erection of scaf-
old cost .£lO, and if the contractor removed his,
the next man might do the job for 305., but plus
.£lO for erection of scaffolding. The painter got
the job at his own figure. Ignorance and careless-
ness cost the Government small fortunes every
year through faulty specifications; in fact,
some contractors, when they detect a flaw,
take the contract at an unrenmnerative figure,
knowing full well that their opportunity for profit
lies in the work necessary for the completion of
the job, and omitted from the specifications.
The present Victorian Premier is in every-
way different to Patterson, the meat-man. Pat-
terson found his greatest political delight in
striving to impress the ’Ouse and appal the multi-
tude. He had no sooner got used to his position
than he started to cultivate a heroic style, sticking
his left hand behind his lightly-buttoned body
and crooking his right forefinger, in imitation of
some British person as depicted by a Graphic
artist. His public life was spent in sitting or
standing for “the portrait of a famous states-
man,” and had ho not been thrown out of office
the scowling mummer would by this time have
been acting the voice of the country in a Roman
toga, or a suit of glittering cha n mail. Patterson
was, and is, an even vainer delusion than Gillies,
whose commonplace pomposity suffered from a
suspicion that his legs were too short and
straddling for the character. Turner, on the
contrary, is not a little bit of a poseur.
The axiom that “no man is a hero to his
valet” doesn’t deter Premier George from taking
a dip at Hegarty’s baths, St. Kilda. At about
(5.30 a.m. any warm morning you may see the
leader of the Government as he is—a rotund little
solicitor, with perhaps a mole or two on his plump
back. All the early bathers seem to look
kindly on Turner. There’s an air of naked
truth about him, and (being rather short-sighted)
he avoids the risk of offending a voter by saying
“How d’yer do” to everyone who comes near
him afloat or ashore. A couple of minutes in the
briny satisfies Premier T. He ducks his repre-
sentative head, swims half-a-dozen strokes, then
off for the fresh-water shower. His platform
manner is unassuming, and he doesn’t even stand
on a pedestal whilst drying himself.
“ The soldier talks of his sword, the sailor
of his guns, but the candidate never talks of his
money.”

It appears to be the intention of Lever
Bros, Ltd., the famous Sunlight soap manufac
turers, not only to inculcate habits of cleanliness
in our homes, but also to educate the people in
fine arts and literature. There is many a cottage,
especially in the country districts, that is adorned
with really fine copies of the best Academy pictures
given by Lover Bros., which must add a pleasant
and cheerful tone to the homo. It is difficult to
see the connection between soap and the fine arts
and literature; still, where cleanliness is sur-
rounded by the beautiful in art, the mind is more
easily educated to enjoy and benefit by reading
the works of our best writers, and Lever Bros, are
contributing to this by distributing some very
fine books as prizes, including Chambers Journal,
Sylvia’s Annual, the Art Heview, and works
by Dickens, Thackeray, Lever, &0., and to in-
augurate the New Year are giving through the
storekeeper a collection of useful Year Books,
which, dealing witli home subjects, such as home
pets, poultry, games, and amusements, the garden,
fashions and patterns, and sports, must be in-
teresting to old and young. All lovers of cricket
and cycling will rush for the book upon sports,
which contains a clever illustrated article upon
cricket, written by England’s champion, W.
Brockwell, who, as the Australians realise, can
play as well as write upon the subject. The
article by Shorthand upon cycling is also very
interesting, and the almanac is a complete com-
pendium of useful information. A serious run
upon the grocers for these books may be pro-
phesied.

"it BORN PHYSICIAN?.
The Greatest and Most Successful Practitioner in the World.
His mode of treatment is unfolded in his last work (nearly 100 PAGES),
PRICE-Posted, Sealed-*!, including ONE MONTHS MEDICINE, for
any Disease.
But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
■minence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word; almost every other man you meet has 3
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power anc
vigour, wasting weakness, and not nnfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.
PRIVATE
troubles of every kind, name and nature,
treated tar fn advance of any institution in Australia; fe-
male complaints, liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, blad-
der, kidney and heart disease; ruqfure - piles, fistula,
hydrocele and kindred troubles.
VARICOCELE CURABLE
WITHOUT operation by Surgeon Langston's Electric Quadrant with doufife compress and support; the only safe
and rational treatment for Varicocele, price £2. Constitutional or acquired weaknesses of both sexes treated suc-
cessfully. CONSULTATION is free to all, but where £1 is enclosed a careful diagnosis of the case will
be made, and appropriate medicines sent. Before confiding your case elsewhere, consult the old and success-
ful Specialist, SURGEON LANGSTON. A friendly letter or call may save future suffering. New
edition of my latest work “Mens Sana in Corpore Sano,” nearly 100 pages, sent free to men.

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than

“This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
“ It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-

One-half the world believes in its descent
from monkeys ; the other half proves it.
It is probable that at least one steamer
will leave Sydney for London next March
freighted with 750 to 1000 live cattle.
Lord Teynham is just married. Last year
a set was made at him by an Australian heiress,
who employed a retired military officer as her
broker, and the affair caused a good deal of talk.
There are enough women on the town in
Adelaide, remarks an official correspondent, to
return a member of their own class to Parliament
if they were all clustered together in one con-
stituency.
When 001. Fox, commandant of the Maori-
land forces, went to Auckland recently to inspect
the battalions, the gas-jets could not be lighted in
the drill-shed. The local commander said it was
so “ blawsted unreliable, don’tcher know; they
should have electric-light.’’ So the inspection had
to bo abandoned. Next day, the angry colonel
discovered that the gas co, had cut the drill-shed
off because its bill hadn’t been paid.
The good young man who remained alive
writes to a Maoriland paper in this strain : “ I do
not see anything about chess or chess problems in
the sacred Scriptures, and therefore I cannot
approve of them.” By-and-bye, this young man
will probably find out to his great astonishment
that there isn’t any mention of pants, or socks, or
boots, or white boiled shirts in the sacred Scrip-
tures, and then he will be arrested on suspicion of
insanity for going about with a pair of sandals on
and a sackcloth round him.
The new Ozar, by promising to release
political prisoners, and to grant a Constitution,
has practically exploded the fiction that his father
wanted to do a lot of things, but dared not on
account, of the Muscovite nobility. In point of
fact, the new Czar “gave away” his father’s
corpse before the weeping populace—who wept
under police instructions and supervision—had
completed their great national sorrow. Is is com-
monly believed, by the way, that the grandfather
of Nicholas 11. did sign a decree granting a Con-
stitution on the very day of his death—the ink
was still wet on the document when he went out
and was blown up by the Nihilists. If they had
known of the fateful document, old Alexander
might probably have sat on a powder-magazine
along with the boss-Nihilist with impunity. But
then they didn’t know.
The gentleman associated with an actress
in a small cab-smash up North, the other week,
displayed an almost pathetic anxiety to have his
name “kept out of the papers.” He was an
Englishman on a visit to the beastly kawlinies,
and he rushed round to each of the local editors
in a tall collar and a profuse perspiration, stating
that he was really “aw’fly sorry at being mixed
up in this confounded bore of an accident, don-
cherknow,” and he hoped they would say nothing
about him because of his “ people at ‘home,’
bai jove !” The press respected the poor fellow’s
feelings, and preserved his incognito in the matter.
He was not much more than 40 years of age,
consequently it would have been most unkind to
alarm the family, who might have reduced his
pocket-money. A doosid narrow escape, though.
The English gentleman couldn’t afford to risk
any more friendship with an. actress who has cab
accidents, dash it all I and when last heard of he
was aboard a P. and O. steamer, returning to his
“people.”

For some time back the North Canterbury
(M.L.) Education Board has ukased that no girl
over 12 shall be caned in any of the district
schools, but recently this order has been rescinded,
and young ladies of any age can now be whaled
in case of need. Experience proved that the very
bad girl of the school, on her twelfth birthday,
would commence making faces at the master, and
put out her tongue at him, and otherwise knock
discipline into a cocked hat. The miserable
teacher had no redress save to “ keep her in,” and
she generally refused to stay in ; or to expel her,
whereupon the truant officer would order her to
be re-admitted. In almost every large school
there was at least one bad girl who kept the
establishment in a state of riot. Now the in-
furiated teacher, after months of worry and
smothered indignation, has at last a chance to get
level with that young lady of a little over 12,


A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big I Our Store is Big J
Our Ideas are Big!
We get bigger every day; on Saturday niglit
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil-we afe planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered „by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow ?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us I
It’s cupboard love. We suit ;them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no' mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughput Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your

SOMETHING ABOUT TWO BOYS.
“The most pathetic incident of my childhood is
this : My mother had been very ill for several
weeks, and the doctor solemnly announced that
she could not live more than two or three days
longer at most. That night my father roused me
from sleep and took me out of my little bed to bid
her a last good-bye. I shall never forget the
scene, which was new and awful to me. People
were weeping all round the room, the air of which
was heavy with the odour of candles and lamps,
and reeking with the fumes of drugs. My mother
knew and kissed me, and then they took me hack
to my bed. But ere I was led away some one
opened the window a few inches from the top, and
I noticed the grey dawn resting on the glass, and
heard the ‘cheep, cheep,’ of a newly-awakened
bird. Since then I have associated that hour and
sound with that unhappy episode.
“But (and to say what now follows I have
written the foregoing paragraph) we were all
rasped and tortured for nothing. My mother
proceeded to get well hand-over-hand, and died
quietly thirty years afterwards. She survived
every person who stood at her bedside that night,
except me.”
(Speaking of the illness of her son, a boy of
nine, a lady says : “We had to sit with him
night and day, giving him brandy, wine, beef-
tea, &c., to keep him alive, and expected every
day would be his last. The physician plainly told
us that nothing more could be done to save him.’’
Yet, in spite of the disease, and—we almost
said—in spite of the doctors, the lad is well to-day.
And this is how it all came about. There is a
moral in it, too, but suppose we serve that up at
the end of the story. All right, you say. Very
well, then.
It seems that this boy, George Westmoreland,
had previously been a strong, healthy little chap,
as all boys ought to be. But about the middle of
last November—lB9l, that is—he was taken
down. The family couldn’t make out what ailed
him. He complained of a bad pain in the stomach,
and vomited a quantity of yellowish-green stuff.
Presently the pain was so sharp he couldn’t lie in
bed, and they had, so his mother says, to apply
fresh hot poultices one after another. The whites
of his eyes turned yellow, and his akin, too. He was
hot, and feverish, and had to fight for his breath.
Of course his mother sent, for a doctor, and the
doctor said his young patient was suffering from
inflammation of the bowels. He gave medicines
which, however, did no'good, so far as the boy’s
friends could see. On the contrary, he grew
worse, and a second doctor was fetched. This
medical gentleman differed from his predecessor,
and gave out that George had an attack of rheu-
matic fever—in other words, acute rheumatism —
a disease which no boy has any business with
whatever.
The treatment on this theory availed nothing;
George was worse. He now had a hacking cough,
and his expectoration was so offensive that the
people had to use disinfectants. He broke out
into sweats, so as to saturate the pillows.
He could take no nourishment save a little milk
and lime water. He wore away to a skeleton, did
the poor boy. He was nothing but skin and bone,
and they had to lift him in and out of bed. Then
he fell so ill he would not notice anyone in the
room, and lay for hours never opening his eyes.
Then came the time when a third doctor said he
couldn’t possibly live.
What happened after that the boy’s mother
tells. We give you her exact words: “In
February last,” she says, “ my husband, as a last
resource, determined to try Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup. After a few doses the boy’s breathing
was easier and he took food. In three days he
was able to sit up, and in a week’s time he was up
and dressed. He gained flesh and strength every
day, and is now able to go about. Sometimes I
look at him and can hardly believe he is the same
boy who was so recently at death’s door. Seigel’s
Syrup saved his life. Yours truly, (signed) Mrs.
Mary Westmoreland, 5, High Street, Plumstead,
London, April 27, 1892.”
Now, half a dozen words. Little George had
no bowel inflammation, nor a single touch of rheu-
matism. That was the doctors’ professional guess-
work. He had a sharp attack of biliousness and
indigestion, of which Mother Seigel would have
cured him long before had her medicine been
appealed to. Here is the moral to conclude with:
Learn what the true remedy for illness is,, and use
it first instead of last.

Until you get into the inner circle of the London
company-promoting world, writes a well-informed A iglo-
Australian to Tub Bulletin, you have no conception
of the depth of swindling there or the extent to which it
is encouraged by prominent and “ respectable ” men,
only provided there is “ bunce ” enough. The life of a
promoter, when successful, is only a short one. Unsuc-
cessful promoters may live long. Success in landing the
public “properly” may mean 12 months’ working in one’s
own name ; after that in somebody else’s ; so a new man
never knows who is pulling the strings when he is inter-
viewing an ostensible promoter. You can never find a
man who runs his business in his own name for long if he
be at all prominent.
• ♦ ♦ ♦
Stockbroker Meudell, of Melbourne, writes to
the Financial News an expos 6 of the greed of London
promoters in floating Westraliary mines. How matters
stand in many of the recent floats .the public will never
know. As some of the mines are valueless and were
obtained for next to nothing, it is fair to guess
that the promoters would take five-sixths of the profit in
cash and shares, and that more money was spent in adver-
tising than will ever be spent in the mines. The London
mine-promoter is a marvellous personage. He takes little
or no risk, and has no right of ownership ; if the public
fail to put up his £lO,OOO profit he declines to pay the
owners, say, £lOOO for their mine. He is an agent who
charges 500 per cent, commission. In the Londonderry
case, the public knew that five-sixths of this mine had
been bonded tor £170,000 by the payment of £lO,OOO
deposit, and are alleged to have taken it at about four
times that price. Who gets the difference? The pro-
moters, who had taken a risk of £lO,OOO, and who, had
they failed to float at £700,000, would probably have been
backward when the day for the payment of the £160,000
arrived.
* * * *
During a public examination in London in con-
nection with the African Landed Estates Co. it transpired
that the “ estates” had been bought for £lOOO, and sold
to the miserable shareholders of the co. for £400,000.
Considering the fatherly lectures on financial morality
which are perpetually cabled out from Hingland to Aus-
tralia, this sort of thing is interesting. With such a
record as hers the good old mother-country ought to lie
low and say as little as possible.

The Wesfcralian gold-boom in London has been
overshadowed by the great activity in South African gold
stocks, and even London cannot boom two fields at once.
Last advices say London was mad on deep-levels, and the
S. A. boom was at high level.

D. G. M‘Fie, who originated and is now manag-
ing director of the N. Queensland Mines Agency (Ltd.), at
one time ran a little mining paper in Croydon and Bris-
bane, but could get no chance to spread himself. D. G.
is a man of big ideas. He goes on the principle that it is
as easy to engineer a big scheme as a little one, and this
half-year he is giving the Britishers an interim div. at the
rate of 25 per cent, per annum.

It would be interesting to know the nature of

The good ore in Mt. Drysdale consists of a pipe-
shoot about 40ft. long, and varying in thickness from a
few inches near the surface to several feet at 125 ft.
Quartz-veins occur occasionally, but are barren. Chloride
of silver is associated with the gold, and the rich ore can-
not be distinguished from the barren country rock.
Nevertheless, this geological puzzle last year paid £22,784
diva, from 2300 tons.

A new phase of the lottery business. Share-
broker Scott, of Auckland (M.L.), asks Govt, to authorise
a co. of 120,000 shares at £1 each to be floated by lottery,
and to have 120 prizes of 1000 shares each—the State to
provide £1 for £l, and the proceeds to be spent in work-
ing the reef levels of the Thames goldfield, now drained
by the Big Pump.
The throe Sydney oronk-bank directors who are
to be released in February will by then have served three
years out of the seven to which they were sentenced.

N.S.W. insolvency records give 17 boarding-
house-keepers and 81 hotel-keepers as victims of last year.
These, as a rule, are the lines of life most directly affected
by general prosperity and adversity, and the figures
quoted support the theory that the past was a “ bad ”
year.

The Maude Proprietary is the low-grade mine
of the Glen Wills field, working an auriferous dyke of
great width, from which about 1000 tons of half-oz. ore
have been crushed. Recent tunnel-explorations at a
deeper level disclose a lode 18ft. wide, assaying about
an oz.

“ As rich if not richer gold than ever ” has been
struck at Falkner’s, Pambula, and samples have been sent
to Sydney for the satisfaction of the shareholders, who,
now-a-days, are not so easily satisfied as they used to be.

N.S.W. mines, alas, all get on the down-grade
with tonnage. Mt. Allen was once an ounce mine. Last
crushing, 423 loads for 2360 z.

Tilden’s Proprietary, N.S.W., has had another
crushing— l 74 tons for 58oz. It can’t stand many more
turns of that sort.
• • • •
A vendor of gold-field condensers has a tap
of pure water running into the tank of the article,
so that when a customer comes in and witnesses
the slimiest and saltest filth imaginable poured into
the top, he very naturally imagines that the crystal
fluid issuing from the apparatus three minutes later
is the same liquid in a purified condition ; whereas the
smellful stuff is really at that time floating peacefully
gutterwards through an underground drain connected
with the hollow leg of the condenser.
The grip patent (for which .£3OOO was paid),
used on the Ocean-st. (Sydney) cable tram-line, having
proved defective, a local manufacturing firm took the
matter in hand, and patched the grips up so that they
are now quite serviceable. The n<-xt difficulty was the
warning-bell, and experiments have been s;oing on for
several weeks with a view to ascertaining the particular
sortof hell best suited to the traffic ; consequently almost
every dummy has a It'd! of different tone and shape,
which ding-dong a perfect jargon of misery to nervous
people. In the end it is believed the bell to be adopted
will be in shape something like a policeman’s helmet, and
will emit a sound quite unlike any other street-noise.

Bradford (Eng.) manufacturers complain, on dit,
that Australian wool is reaching them in bad order, being
knotted, torn and tangled. They are inclined to blame
machine-shearing for this, but this view is hardly borne out
by facts. The real culprit is the festive “blackleg”
shearer, who takes off wool, skin, and a good slice of mut-
ton as well. In the hands of the “blackleg” the machine
becomes a murderous instrument of torture—as the poor
sheep find. Now the torture seems to be extending to the
squatters themselves. - .
• • • •
Brisbane (Q.) Courier urged a reduction of
shearing rates, as an appropriate comment on a Brisbane
conference of squatters. Which means that the Q.
squatter means to run another strike in ’95.

A Coolgardie paper wants to know the result of
the Great Boulder crushing. Tub Bulletin has reason
for believing it was 200 tons for 13oz.
Steelman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Steelman was a hard case. If you were
married, and, settled down, and were so unfor-
tunate as to have known Steelman in other days,
he would, if in your neighborhood and dead-beat,’
be pretty sure to look you up. He’d find you any-
where, no matter what precautions you might
take. If he came to your house, he’d stay to tea
without invitation ; and, if he stayed to tea, he’d
ask you to “ fix up a shakedown on the floor, old
man,” and put him up for the night; and, if he
stopped all night, he’d remain—well, until some-
thing better turned up.
There was no shaking off Steelman. Also, he
had a way about him which would often make it
appear <ts if you invited him to stay, and pressed
him against his roving inclination, and were glad
to have him round for company, while he remained
only out of pure goodwill to you. He didn’t like
to offend an old friend by refusing his invitation.
* * *
Steelman knew his men.
The married victim generally had neither the
courage nor the ability to turn 'him out. He was
cheerfully blind and deaf to all hints, and if the
exasperated “missis” “said anything” to him,
“straight,” he would look shocked and reply, as
likely as not—
“ Why, my good woman, you must be mad !
I’m your husband’s guest!”
And if she wouldn’t cook for him, he’d cook for
himself.
* * #
There was no choking him off. Few
people care to call the police in a case like this ;
and, besides, as before remarked, Steelman knew
his men. The only way to escape from him was
to shift—but then, as likely as not, he’d help pack
up and come along with his portmanteau right on
top of the last load of furniture, and drive you
and your wife to the verge of madness by the calm
style in which he proceeded to superintend the
hanging of your pictures.
* * #
Once he quartered himself like this on an
old schoolmate of his named Brown, who had got
married and steady and settled down. Brown
tried all ways to get rid of Steelman, but he
couldn’t do it. One day Brown said to Steelman :
6 Look here, Steely, old man, I’m very
sorry, but I’m afraid we won’t be able to accom-
modate you any longer—to make you comfortable,
I mean. You see, a sister of the missis is coming
down on a visit for a month or two, and we ain’t
got anywhere to put her except in your room. I
wish the missis’s relations to blazes ! I didn’t
marry the whole blessed family ; but it seems I’ve
got to keep them.”
Pause—very awkward and painful for poor
Brown. Discouraging silence from Steelman.
Brown rested his elbows on his knees, and, with a
pathetic and appealing movement of his hand
across his forehead, he continued desperately:
“I’m very sorry, you see, old man—you know
I’d like you to stay—l want you to stay. . , It
isn’t my fault—it’s the missis’ doings. I’ve done
my best with her, but I can’t help it. I’ve been
more like a master in my own house —more com-
fortable—and I’ve been better treated since I’ve
had you to back me up. . . I’ll feel mighty
lonely, anyway, when you’re gone. . . But . .
you know . . as soon as her sister goes . .
you know
Here poor Brown broke down—very sorry he
had spoken at all; but Steely came to the rescue
with a ray of light.
“ What’s the matter with the little room at the
back ? ” he asked.
“ Oh, we couldn’t think of putting you there,”
said Brown with a last effort; “it’s not fixed up ;
you wouldn’t be comfortable, and, besides, it’s
damp, and you’d catch your death of cold. It was
never meant for anything but a wash-house. I’m
sorry I didn’t get another room built on to the
house.”
“ Bosh ! ” Interrupted Steelman, cheerfully.
“ Catch a cold ! Here I’ve been knocking about
the country for the last five years—sleeping out in
all weathers—and do you think a little damp is
going to hurt me ? Booh ! What do you take me
for ? Don’t you bother your head about it any
more, old man; I’ll fix up the lumber-room for
myself, all right; and all you’ve got to do is to let
me know when the sister-in-law business is
coming on, and I’ll shift out of my room in time
for the missis to get it ready for her. Here, have
you got a bob on you ? I’ll go out and get some
beer. A drop’ll do you good.”
“Well, if you can make yourself comfortable,
I’ll be only too glad for you to stay,” said the
utterly defeated Brown.
“You’d better invite some woman you know to
come on a visit, and pass her off as your sister,”
said Brown to his wife, while Steelman was gone
for the beer. “ I’ve made a mess of it.”
Steelman knew his men.
» * *
But, at last, Brown reckoned that he
could stand it no longer. The thought of it made
him so wild that he couldn’t work. He took a
day off to get thoroughly worked up in, came
home that night full to the chin of indignation
and Dunedin beer, and tried to kick Steelman
out. And Steelman “stoushed him”—gave him
a hiding.
* * *
Next morning Steelman was sitting beside
Brown’s bed with a saucer of vinegar, some brown
paper, a raw beef-steak, and a bottle of soda.
“Well, what have you got to say for yourself
now, Brown ?” he said, sternly, “Ain’t you jolly
well ashamed of yourself to come home in the
beastly state you did last night, and insult a guest
in your house, bo say nothing of an old friend—
and perhaps the best friend you ever had, if you
only knew it? Anybody else would have given
you in charge and got you three months for the
assault. You ought to have some consideration
for your wife and children, and your own character
—even if you haven’t any for your old mate’s feel-
ings. Here, drink this, and let me fix you up a
bit; the missis has got the breakfast waiting.”
* # #
That was five years ago, and Steelman is
still living with the Browns.

The Fire at Thompson’s Ford,
A VICTORIAN SHEARING EPISODE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Hottest pf hob December’s days.
Fierce and strong are the sun’s keen rays ;
The north wind’s sulphurous breath blows strong;
Even the magpie stills his song.
Over the pools of the stagnant creek
Steaming hangs the vaporous reek.
Under the scanty she-oaks crowd
Panting cattle, breathing loud.
Slowly, out in the eastern sky,
A wreath of smoke climbs clear and high.
It sways in the air like a tangled cord—
A fire has started at Thompson’s Ford !
Thompson’s shed is late this year,
Most of his sheep are yet to shear ;
“ Blackleu” labor, with half a board —■
No “truck ” with fhe Union at Thompson’s ford-
- The Union camp breaks up to day ;
Horses are saddled and ready, but stay !
Thompson shears with “ scabs.” Just so.
But a big bush-fire is a common foe.
Down the old gully, along the flat,
Red Bill leading with one-eyed Mat ;
Past the stockyard, over the brush,
Mat now first, the rest in a crush ;
Seven long miles in a blazing sun,
And yet the prelude has but begun.
The flames in mountains roar and swirl;
Dense, black smoke-clouds over them curl;
Bounding, crackling, leaping higher—
Ah, strong men shrink from a big bush fire !
“ A real old bender,” says Mat, “ Good Lord !
But we’ve got to stop her at Thompson’s ford,”
The river at Thompson’s ford runs low —
“ But the homestead goes if it’s crossed, you know. ”
Yes, that was a battle, and, even now,
The very thought just pains my brow.
Choked with smoke, dry as a board,
With our teeth hard-set we held the ford.
Side by side in that desperate band,
Squatter and shearer, hand-to-hand,
Fought like tigers for hour on hour,
Never a man was seen to cower.
The sun in the west began to sink,
When, choking, panting, gasping for drink,
We sent up a cheer, aye, how we roared—
We had stopped the tire at Thompson’s ford !
Next year, Thompson’s notice states :
“Shearers wanted, union rates.”

" On the Land.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hot!
A blistering heat, that drove the fowls, with
their beaks gaping, off the burning ground into
the shelter of the slab hut. A scorching, wither-
ing heat, that had made sapless hay of the grass
in the paddocks, and reddened the foliage of the
gums and the stringy-barks like the blaze of a
bush-fire. A heat that had sucked up all moisture,
and marbled the land with cracks of shrink-
age, and turned the waterholes into mere mud-
baths ; while the distant creek had nothing but
its brown flag-grass and dry swamp bed to show
where the water had run.
About the homestead, the few cattle still alive
hung with their heads stolidly over the slip-rails,
refusing, in spite of all driving, to seek again for
the sustenance it was impossible to find. The
framework of a horse, his head between his legs,
and as much in shade as he could get on the lee
side of an old ironbark, stood impassive and
motionless. All round the horizon, a dirty haze
of smoke that melted into a yellow veil of fog
covering the sky.
The sun glared down. The air shimmered
tremulously, as though it sickened with its burden.
And over all that land not one gleam of freshness,
not one sound of joy, not a murmur save the
eternal zing-zing-zing of the locust. Seared,
blasted, stricken, a curse was upon it and upon
every living thing.
Abe Saunders was down at what used to be the
creek, trying to drag out his last milking cow
from the place when she had bogged in a vain
effort to find water-grass.
Abe hauled and strained at the rope, his shirt
and trousers clinging to him with sweat. The beast
kicked and plunged feebly, its little strength
quite gone ; and after two hours’ work it was more
firmly bogged than ever.
“ It’s no good,” said Abe, “ I must get help;
I’ll go up the gully for old Mason and his tackle.
If we lose that cow, what will the children do for
milk ? ”
Wearily he turned to go, when the sound of a
“ Coo-ee ! ” turned him sharply about.
“Coo-ee ! ” he shouted.
A little pause, and again the cry echoed.
“Coo-ee!”
“ It’s Mary,” he said ; “what the devil’s up?”
It was a good three miles to the ridge ; but, like
a wallaby with the dogs in full cry, he sped
over rock and gully back to the homestead. Long
before he got there, he heard a strange roaring in
the air, saw black, belching clouds over the tree
tops, and felt a fierce rushing furnace breath.
The bush was on fire.
With the energy of fear he dashed along. There
was the clearing, with Mary at the house-door
still shouting at intervals. Even as he came up,
the red storm was upon them. In mad frenzy he
seized the two children, one under each arm, and
shrieking to his wife above the din of the fire to
bring the baby, he rushed to the centre of the
ploughed paddock. There they crouched panting.
The children were howling, the baby was crying.
and Mary was sobbing. The man said nothing,
He watched the fire.
Would the house escape ? There was fifty feet
of bare ground all about it. But the air, so calm
a minute ago, was now a roaring hurricane travel-
ling at racing speed over the ridge. The tea-tree
scrub melted before it, and the bush trees remained
in its rear only as black and burning trunks. The
fence had caught; the flames licked it up daintily,
The shed, with his cart and harness, were, and
were not, while he looked. A piece of burning
stringy-bark, whirled by the wind, settled on the
shingles of the house. The woman moaned and
pressed the child closer to her bosom. The man’s
face was drawn in agony.
Week by week, day by day, he had seen the
work of his life perish under the merciless sun
The best of his cattle were festering carcases; his
horses were dead, though his last pound had been
spent in hay for them. His season’s crop was
sickly beyond redemption. All this he had borne,
and still toiled in the unequal struggle.
And now the house was burning, the work of
his own hands. How many months of weary
sawing and splitting had its shingles and slabs
cost him ? He thought of it all as he stood there,
helpless and half-suffocated. In less than a minute
the flames were shooting out of the doorways and
windows, _ and a loud report was followed by the
fall of a side of the house. It was the explosion
of his powder-flask, hung on the wall.
“ Can’t you put it out, Abe ?”
“ Put but hell!” And he ground his teeth.
another. The spirit of the man revolted.
, u ~ u • j . v . «
T L ? Mary,’.’he cned, ‘ there goes the cradle
I made for the kids. And as he spoke t e as-
pect of his face changed. The limit of his suffer-
mg had come, and, like an old-time victim of t o
rack, he began to laugh. A hollow laugh, weir

You re mad, Abe, said his wife, shrinking
from him, with a great dread in her eyes. Don t
that. It s horrible , .
“Mad, my dear! That s good. Ha, ha, ha.!
Say I’ve been mad—the most confounded lunatic
in this blasted, blistering country. To slog and
belt for ten long years to make a home of our own;
to clear land, to fence it, drain it, plant it—and
all to make five minutes’ bonfire ? Yes, I’ve been
mad, stark staring mad ; but now-ha, ha, ha I
I was never so sensible in my life !
“See how the cradle burns, Mary. It was a
bit of she-oak, and worked like a watch. Don’t
it look pretty now ?—they might be silk curtains,
all those flounces round it! Why don’t you laugh.
girl?—it’s a great joke. Look ! the roof is falling
in. It’s as good as fireworks. Hold up the kids ;
let them laugh. It’s all the same price. Ha, ha,
ha ! ”
But the woman replied nothing, frightened,
staring at him. The children screamed.
The driving sheet of flame had long gone by.
Skirting the ploughed ground where they stood, it
had left the bare surface an untouched blank in
its ghastly funeral trail. Only tree-stumps, posts,
and fallen branches, smoked and smouldered here
and there. The man stood motionless till nothing
but the four charred corner-posts remained of his
home.
“ Let’s see the play out,” he said. “ Ha, ha,
ha! Ha, ha, ha!”
The fire was raging many miles further onward
when Abe Saunders, taking the two children by
the hand, led the way down the track to the main
road. His wife dragged wearily after him, the baby
in her arms, looking back from time to time at the
smoking ruin.
The group passed on to the road, where the red
dust blew in thick choking clouds that shrouded
them from view. But long after they had dis-
appeared there sounded the wail of the children.
the moaning of the woman, and loud above all the
mirthless laughter of a broken-hearted man.

The Victorian Land-tax will not he applied
to the closed roads. The rich man, who owns the
adjacent* property, gently fences in abandoned
roads, but he doesn’t pay for them, and he isn’t
charged rent for them because he only holds them
in trust for the State, and he won’t pay land-tax
on them because they are not his own. By-and-
bye, however, the fact that they are public pro-
perty gets lost in the gloom of antiquity, and he
keeps them altogether. At £1 an acre there are
over .£lOO,OOO waiting to be collected as the price of
abandoned roads which the Fat Person has
quietly absorbed.
This is one of the things which make men
believe in Providence. A few weeks ago a gang
of eight men were cutting a road over a huge cliff
at Rangitikei (M.L.). The cook’s clock, by some
unaccountable process, gained 15 minutes during
the forenoon, and he called the men to dinner at
a quarter to one o’clock. About ten minutes to
one a dozen tons of rock fell on the spot where
they had been working, and buried all their tools
beneath the ruins. And now eight men firmly
believe that Providence came in silently while the
cook wasn’t looking and shoved the clock ahead
to save their lives —which could have been saved
quite as easily by postponing the fall of that rook
until 1.5 p.m.
