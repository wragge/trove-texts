I “A White Australia: Is It Possible?” by
Hastings Young, M.B.
(Robertson & Mullens, Ltd,, Melbourne.)
To the making of unwise and ignorant
books there is no certain end, and Dr. Has-
tings Young s latest effort doesn’t help the
ending. liis work is defined as dealing
with “the Problem of the Empty North,”
which is no legitimate problem at all, but
has been made one, like the bogus pro-
blem of the Sydney Harbor bridge,
because it is easier to blame the Nature of
b-od than the laziness .and incapacity of man.
1. lie volume begins in the usual liackneyed
tashion: ‘ Australia is a country rich in
mneral and other resources.” That text
.vhich should be broiled by the common
hangman, has been the excuse for many
oans, the resources” being such splendid
security; and it has justified more loafing
han enough, for in a land where Nature
lows, harrows and reaps itself, why need
nan work. Australia as a reality is weak

or its size, in coal; and a considerably-
dayed-out gold proposition. It is short

“fully > 01 ‘ all three, than most other white

good-enough land: it is healthy and wide •
la . llS own, and the North is the best part
it. Last year the purely State loan-
oney crop was more than twice the mineral
op, yet Dr. Hastings Young doesn’t men-
mit among the “resources.” But he goes

agine that prejudice is dead yet, in a general
way, where the late war is concerned. How
e e |i imself notably fair-minded. He is
one of those who, from their official posi-
tions, have had exceptional opportunities to
watch and reflect upon the trend of
events. He was ambassador in St. Peters-
during the period of rapprochement
between Russia and France. He was Min-
ster for Joreign Affairs at Berlin when the
notion caused by the German naval pro-
gramme developed a distinct coolness in the
■elations of Britain and Germany. And he

usace Lorraine. Australian readers will
emember the stir caused by the writings
f Bernhardi, and the other prophets of
aii-Germanism. But Von Schoen asserts

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
War.
I am a singer of many songs,
The sad, the mad, the gay :
The ruthless righter of countless wrongs,
The Master of The Day!
The King of Death; and the Lord of Life.
To all I bring release.
I am the huckster of Hate and Strife;
The Harbinger of Peace.
The fathers come at my trumpet-call;
The mothers curse my name.
The sons in ecstasy fight and fall;
The daughters flee from shame!
Mine is the bottomless pit of Hell
Where writhing souls are crammed;
The howling voice of the Tocsin-bell;
The Moloch of the Damned!
I am a saint, a sinner, a sage,
A friend the gods abhor:
I have been worshipped in ev’ry age,
For my name—my name, is War.

Any Man.
O unknown woman I shall never know!
Whose touch would thrill me into ecstasy.
Whose laughing and desirous eyes would
show
Infinite luring depths of joy to me,
Somewhere you pass through the same com-
mon day;
Somewhere you stir the hearts of men to
flame,
And go unsatisfied your darkling way,
With lips that have not even formed my
name!
But sometimes in the night I know you
dream,
Strangely bewildered, tortured by vague
fire.
Among the shadows comes a sudden gleam,
I and my kindling rapture of desire.
And then you wake and gaze into the gloom,
And hear the unquiet curtains near your
bed
With restless longing fill the darkened room,
While eddying whispers cease above your
head.
Here in the street, perhaps, we meet, and 1
Can only turn to watch you as you go,
Moved blindly, dimly. Then you pass me
by
For ever, and we two can never know
I Tow we would find in our astounding kiss
The unguessed splendor filling all our
days.
And through their woven yearning grown
to this
By strange and unimaginable ways.

Dark Rivers.
There are dark rivers under tropic skies,
Oily, with scarce a ripple in the flood
Which silently creeps through the reeking
mud,
Breeding strange fevers, eddying about
A scaly back, or hideous, mottled snout:
Or, where some war-canoe the surface broke,
Where dead white mists break into rings of
smoke.
Great stars and wonderful between the
boughs,
Shine on the river, and great creatures wade
With broad and glossy sides, as though they
made
A rendezvous with Pleasure in the night,
And from the sword-grass, yellow eyes and
brigh t
Appear a.nd disappear. An angry beast
Roars from the jungle, greedy for his feast.
The warthog grunts, and charges, like a
flame,
Branding some fleshy flank with bloody aim.
Here flows a shallow creek from shallow
hills,
Black with stream-tin and banked by ragged
grass,
Where ragged Chinamen, ore-seeking, pass,
Some stray white goats tramp down on
anxious hoofs;
Here is a wooden church, and iron roofs,
A poppet-head in ruins, looking down
On this worn-out, lean-pastui’ed, mining
town.
And beyond this, are many empty plains,
And farther still, a railway, and the scrolls
Of the straight, unwound lines, the naked
poles
Along the ancient coach-road, rutted deep,
From the wet passing of a mob of sheep.
Hard by, the rotting timbers of a bridge,
A sapless plant of bracken tries to grow,
A harmless lizard scuttles to and fro,
A frugal meal on feeble flies to make:
There’s nothing here as subtle as a snake!
So the long days melt into quiet nights.
Dun-colored flats and fire-blackened hills.
Butpver there the python hangs, and kills
The' shuddering doe, and in the light and
shade
Of forest paths, such games of death are
played
That life soars, glowing on exultant wing.
Man having learned the value of a thing
For which he wrestles daily! Surely love
Must be worth having—where such hazards
move!
The sickly sunset bathes the sallow stream:
A toneless twilight on the township lies.
There are dark rivers under tropic skies;
And though I have not seen it, yet I think
I know the way a lion comes to drink!

FANS
For Summer Comfort
(§) Electric Fans Provide
Refreshing Breezes on Sweltering
Days.
s
OON the oppressive and sweltering heat
of Summer will settle down over the
home, office and shop, bringing inevitable
lassitude and the tendency to slow down in
the day’s work. These conditions emphasise
the necessity of G.E. Fan comfort, bringing
with it refreshing breezes and all-round
efficiency.
Good ventilation is an economic and
hygienic requisite for all whose work necessi-
tates their being either temporarily or perma-
nently indoors.
The electric fan is the most simple and
effective means yet devised to secure better
hot-weather ventilation.
The G.E. electric fan is a promoter of
personal comfort, a conservator of public
health, a business and manufacturing asset.
In uncounted homes its steady, powerful
breeze brings relief from the discomfort and
enervation of hot summer days, and promotes
quiet sleep through otherwise wakeful nignts.
It safeguards the health of children and
hastens the recovery of the sick.
It cools every corner.

EVERY SECOND CHILD.
Dr. James Barrett, of Victoria, told a
luncheon-hour gathering in Sydney last
Thursday, that “50 per cent, of all the chil-
dren born in Melbourne Hospital were syphi-
litic” ; and he went on to emphasise that this
state of affairs was not confined to Mel-
bourne, but prevailed in every city in Aus-
tralia. There is no need to stress the misery
suffered by these unfortunate little creatures
whose lives are thus blasted before they have
well begun. In religious circles it is usually
taken for granted as an interesting fulfil-
ment of a familiar Biblical prophecy.
Modern Governments, even if they’ are un-
able to give very serious consideration to
humanitarianism, at any rate do not derive
their policies from the more ferocious of the
Old Testament texts. As a general rule they
are not concerned either to succor or to
penalise those who have fallen by the w-ay-
side —unless the derelicts become nuisances
to those w T ho have had better luck in life’s
struggle. When that happens a vigorous
attempt is made to abolish such affronts to
the general standard of decency or security.
The case of a dangerous lunatic, for example,
is attended to by the authorities with the
utmost expedition and complete indifference
to expense. The basic idea which actuates
the churches in respect of large classes of
unfortunates —drunkards, V.D. victims, mor-
phia and cocaine addicts—is a form of ex-
ultant hatred. The righteous feel that they
do well to be angry with these wretches;
and in any eyent a sombre pleasure is taken
in the spectacle of afflictions which can be
shown to be the direct result of Sin. There
is no logic either in the gratification of the
good at the mental and physical misfortunes
of those who are known generic-ally as “the
wicked”; or in the common clerical notion
that the disabilities under which these people
labor provide a useful moral lesson. For
the plain fact is-—and Dr. Barrett’s pro-
nouncement, last week, should convince the
most intolerant Puritan of it —that the
wages of sin is death in many cases, not to
the guilty, but to those who have never had
a chance to sin. The attitude of the pro-
fessional politician in this matter is as un-
scrupulously rational as that of the profes-
sional churchman is scrupulously irrational.
In considering the V.D. and kindred pro-
blems the politician considers nothing what-
ever but votes.
t ♦ ♦ •
Take the State in which Dr. Barrett
made his appalling revelation. A study of
the different platforms which the different
members of the Fuller Ministry are offer-
ing the electors would suggest that “the
greatest killing disease of modern times”
had been reduced, as regards its incidence,
to, say, .5 per cent, of the population (which
were the figures in the A.I.F. in France by
August, 1918), instead of being over 10 per
cent., or worse than anything that was
known in the ranks of our expeditionary
army even during the early days in Egypt.
Almost every panacea for the ills which are
supposed to be besetting N. S>. Wales is
shouted by the various Ministerial candi-
dates for their leader’s job—except a pana-
cea for the thing which is causing every
other child born in our public hospitals to
be a cripple or a moron; an affliction to
itself and a charge, until the day of its
death, upon the taxpayers. The Minister
for Education, apparently with memories
stirring in him of the days when he ham-
mered a tambourine at street corners, has
insisted on a form of corybantic Empire-
worship in the schools, which is as offensive
to many Australians who offered their
lives for the Empire in the late war as
the methods of worship which Mr. Brunt-
nell once practised would be offensive to
many sincere Christians if imposed upon their
children. The Minister for Justice, heedless
of the protests and denials of the Premier,
keeps repeating the assurance that legislation
will be introduced to nullify the Ne Temere
decree. For the rest, he is occupied largely
in such activities as smelling out infamies in
Gyx parlors, and devising legislation to abolish
barmaids. llruntNell is iiot so stupid as
to imagine that Australia —the country which
depends for its national life on Britain
at the present moment, and knows it well—
needs to testify daily to its loyalty through
its children, after the manner of a reformed
burglar protesting his newly-found honesty
at a hallelujah meeting. The time and
energy which the Minister has expended in
this direction are matters not of safeguard-
ing the Empire, but of safeguarding his
job ; it being a political axiom that a parade
of Empire loyalty never costs anything, and
always earns votes. Ley is seeking to
undermine Fuller by satisfying those who
aspire to uproot the Vatican, that Codlin,
of St. George, is the friend where anti-
Romanism is concerned, and not Illawarra
Short. Militant sectarians are tempera-
mentally disposed to believe the worst about
that of whidh they know least; and so we
have the horrors of Gyx parlors insisted
on, and the need of abolishing them and
other institutions which probably do not
matter at all, and certainly do not matter
much. Ley knows he is talking bunkum
about the Ne Teniere decree—that no lay
legislation ever has, or ever will, influence
a religious doctrine unless to the extent of
strengthening it —and he knows he is talk-
ing bunkum about the Gyx parlors. He
knows that a modern State is very like a
modern army: that the chief requisites are
efficiency and good government, and that
these can only be obtained by the promo-
tion of harmony and health, There was no
sectarianism in the A.I.F. because its lead-
ers had no need to consolidate votes by set-
ting sect against sect; and measures were
taken which, by the end of the fighting, had
reduced V.D. to vanishing-point in the field,
because the army leaders had no V.D. vote
to fear. Sectarianism is being busily pro-
moted by both the Fullers and the Dooleys
of N. S. Wales, because it is an easy means
of whipping-up votes: V.D. is being left
alone with equal zest because any attack
on it means the loss of votes. 'McGirr.
Minister for Health in the late Dooley Gov-
ernment, posed as a particular friend of the
mothers of N. S. Wales. He wanted to pro-
vide them all with a weekly dole out of the
taxpayers’ pockets, by which they would be
enabled to remember him at the polling-
booths for all time. And he suspended
simultaneously the compulsory clauses of the
V.D. Act, thereby giving a free run to the
diseases which are directly responsible for
about 75 per cent, of the internal troubles
from which mothers suffer. One Skelton.
of Newcastle, is posing as the friend of
poor children, and he lately tore a passion to
tatters over two little boys who were said
to have emerged in a deteriorated condition
from an orphanage. Yet he has not opened
his mouth in Parliament on the subject of
the horror which is causing every second
child born in a public institution in this
country to be a physical or mental degen-
erate, or both.
* * * •
So that those who are working to rid
Australia of this cruellest of plagues have
nothing to hope for, at present, from the poli-
ticians, Labor or Tory, Orange or Green.
Syphilis is in the happy position of the pony-
racing and bookmaking industries: it is con-
tinually being saved by friends who might
fairly be expected to be its enemies. The
Churches object as strongly to practically
every proposal which is put forward for the
Government control of venereal disease as
they do to the Government control of bet-
ting. And every move that is made
against V.D. by men such as Dr. James
Barrett is blocked by Australian women
such as Mrs. Booth, of the “Association to
Combat the Social Evil”; or by Maoriland
women such as Mrs. Atkinson, of the
“Society for the Protection of Women and
Children,” The only hope lies in the inten-
sive education of those who are open to be
educated —being neither crooks nor cranks—
on the two grand points: (1) That venereal
disease is causing the country infinite suf-
fering and a vast amount of money ; (2) that
it is as preventable as small-pox. It should
be easy to drive home these facts by refer-
ence to what happened d"ring the war.
There, the existence of the Empire being at
stake, there was a conspicuous tendency to
cut out the foolery : there were no "two-up”
raids, no prohibition meetings, no Sinn Fein
or Orange celebrations. It was discovered
within two months of the beginning of the
training at Mena that 3 per cent, of the men
were infected, and, though the normal pro-
portion in civilian life is three times as great,
the doctors were horrified. Their cam-
paign, which chiefly consisted of warning
lectures, was interrupted by the Gallipoli
landing. After the Evacuation things
became so bad that the whole of the shams
by which V.D. lives here were jettisoned;
prostitution was rigorously supervised;
the men were provided with prophylactics;
ablution rooms were instituted ; and the cam-
paign of education was intensified. Auto-
matically V.D. began to fade away, till, by
the Armistice, any given A.I.F. battalion
represented about the cleanest aggregation of
adult human beings for its size on record. This
is not theory, but documented history. And
exactly the same results could be obtained in
civilian Australia to-day. The only real
difference lies in the issues at stake. Most
soldiers agreed that every form of attack
should be directed at venereal disease, since
neglect might end in defeat. ~ And most
civilians are likely to agree to the same
course when it is made clear that, without
such measures, another army must know a
form of defeat far worse than that experi-
enced on any battlefield—an ever-growing
army of polluted children who will be born
into the world only to curse it and their
parents.
THE COMMONWEALTH BANK’S
EASY MONEY.
When the latest Loan Bill was being dis-
sected in the House of Reps., the Common-
wealth Bank, which has put such gorgeous
commissions in the way of the architectural
Kirkpatricks, with whom Mr. Denison
Miller’s son is associated, came in for some
spirited criticism. Somebody quoted the
statement of Denison Miller that the Bank
had constructed 1874 war-service homes for
£1,184,062, in respect of which transactions
J. and H. G. Kirkpatrick have claimed, and
presumably collected. £48,950. "The less
said about that matter the better,” Best
testily interposed. “It was a most disgrace-
ful thing from beginning to end.” Dr.
Maloney mentioned that when it became
known that the Bank intended building in
Collins-street, Melbourne, the Victorian In-
stitute of Architects asked Denison Miller
to let the architectural work go to public
competition. The reply, of course, was that the
Bank had already made arrangements with
the inevitable Kirkpatricks and Miller,
junior. No others need apply. This
b'Vught up the question of the note-printing
edihce, for which plans had been pre-
pared by the Government architects and
adopted by the Public Works Commit-
tee, only to be discarded in favor of a Kirk-
patrick and Miller design for a much more
expensive structure. "I have always agreed
with the late John Forrest,” ‘said the
M.H.R. for Melbourne, "that too much power
has been given to the Governor of this
Bank. No other manager in the history of
banking has had the ; power that Denison
Miller wields. He is an absolute dictator.”
J. E. Fenton, another Labor member, con-
tended that the Bank, by its very existence,
had been useful to Australia. But he ob-
jected to its profiteering on the country by
lending out enormous amounts lodged with it
by the Government, and allowing the Govern-
ment neither interest nor any portion of the
profits. "When I was a member of the Pub-
lic Accounts Committee,” he said, "we dis-
covered that at one period the Bank held
about £18,000,060 of public funds, on which
the Treasurer ivas receiving no interest. The
Bank .earned a considerable amount by plac-
ing this money in short-dated loans on the
London market. But the Treasury didn’t
get a penny out of it.”
H. L, Pratten, one of the few men in
the House with a knowledge of finance, took
up the parable where Fenton had dropped
it. _ He roundly condemned the practice of
letting the Bank have the use, gratis, or for
a trifling consideration, of large unexpended
loan balances on which the country was pay-
ing high rates of interest. Quoting from
F e ,^F*\ t ° r '. General ’ s report, he showed that
in 19-0-_1 the Bank allowed the Government
P e , r . eent - o n a fixed deposit of
£5,060,000, which had conceivably been bor-
rowed at 6 per cent, or more, and that the
transaction had been renewed for six months
from June 5, 1921. On current-account
money nothing whatever -was allowed • and at
that moment the Bank held £9,000,000, on
which the Government was paying interest
u l the Public creditor and receiving no set-
,P ere RUCE - the Tr Aurer. protested
that the amount in que a fell short of
£9.000,000. But he didn't by how much.
Returning to the attack. Pratten declared
that nearly all the profits of which the man-
agement boasted so mightily had been made
during, and as a result of. the war; "and
chiefly,” he added, "at the expense of Com-
monwealth finance”—

Total war and post-war earnings. £3,478,363. Most
of these earnings, I maintain, were due, not to the usual
profits of banking institutions, but rather to the
Government s enormous deposits with the Bank on
which no or little interest is paid- I believe these
deposits for some years have averaged an amount
peaching eight figures, that is to say, £10,000,000
or more. When such huge sums of monev are in
the custody of the Bank, and it pays little' interest
on them, its operations are naturally highly profit-
able. Maybe the Commonwealth has borrowed its
Own money, on which it has received no interest,
and has paid up to 5 per cent, for it.
It is quite possible. Anything is possible in
a country where the national Government
levies Customs duties on the imports of a
State Government, retains portion of the
proceeds for its own use, and distributes the
balance, at the rate of 255. a head, among
the importing and non-importing States
alike. There is an appalling amount of make-
believe about Australian finance. It is a
potent cause of the lordly ostentation that
prevails in matters of government, and of
the hilarious excess of civil servants, to the.
multiplication of whom there js no end.
The member for Parramatta devoted some
attention to the disposal of the Bank’s
profits. Under section 30 of the Act these
a £ e divided between a reserve fund, "which
shall be available for the payment of anv
of its liabilities,” and with which no one
proposes to interfere, and a redemption
fund. It is provided that this redemption
fund
, j 56 , us ? d in repayment of any monev advanced
to the Bank by the Treasurer, or in the redemption
ot the debentures or stock issued by the Bank, but
if the fund exceeds the amount of' debentures and
stock in circulation the excess MAY be used for the
purposes of the redemption of any Commonwealth
debts or State debts taken over by the Common-
wealth.
But the Bank is not indebted to the Trea-
surer, nor has it issued debentures or stock.
Therefore, the whole of the redemption fund,
which now exceeds £2,000,000, should be
available for the purpose which Parliament
had in mind when it called the institution
into existence. It is notorious that Deni-
son Miller objects to narting with the con-
trol of this money. There is a story that
when Joseph Cook tried to get it for the
1 per cent, sinking fund he talked of estab-
lishing, he was sent away with a flea in his
ear. But Parliament is not in the mood
to suffer any more impudence from the
Commonwealth Bank. It can no longer sub-
mit to an imperium in imperio being set un
by one of the people’s servants, who has
developed an inflated idea of his own im-
portance. P batten’s proposal is that the
£2,000,000 should be commandeered, if the
Bank persists in its contumacy, and paid
into the sinking fund. In this he has the
support of Best and Fenton. He can also
count on the support of the general public,
which has never been able to see the neces-
sity for paying such vast sums to .T. and 11.
G. Kirkpatrick:. Another suggestion is
that the Bank should be encouraged to prac-
tise economy, signs of which are conspicu-
ously lacking, by being made liable for in-
come-tax, as other banks are. In the result,
it might be necessary to dispense with the
priceless Kirkpatrick'S, issue a less expen-
sive house magazine than the gloating nubli-
eation which features ladies’ legs, and find
room for a few Diggers in place of the flocks
of flappers who can be seen wandering aim-
lessly about the head-office fixing up their
back-hair. But these are deprivations that
the nation would survive.
THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF M.L.
Taxation is out on its own as the favorite
subject for discussion in Maoriland just now.
Every newspaper is full of it; every com-
mercial or industrial association deplores its
crushing effect; every meeting of shareholders
is clamorous with the apologies of directors
explaining the minuteness of dividends and
the monstrousness of taxation. The last
report of the Bank of New Zealand, the
Dominion’s largest financial institution,
pointed out that in M.L. alone £512,208 had
been paid in taxes, of which £342,022 was
income-tax, while the dividends were but
£412,500. Even more painful was the re-
port of the Kaiapoi Woollen Co., the largest
concern of the sort in the islands, which con-
ducts a combined manufacturing and trading
business on a paid-up capital of £376,265.
Last year rates and taxes took £38,912. while
the total dividend for the 12 months was only
£28,847. And these meagre results were
obtained only by encroaching on the reserves,
operations for the year having resulted in
a net loss of £86,108. The company happened
to have been particularly successful in the
past, and had provided for a rainy day by
building up a reserve and insurance fund
of £196,032.
Such an anomaly as the payment to the
Treasury of £38,912 in a year when the loss
amounted to 23 per cent, of the paid-up capi-
tal has. raised the question of the equity
of Maoriland’s taxing system under which the
tax for any year is based on the profits of the
previous year, and not on current earnings.
And there is a cry for a reduction of the
present maximum rate, which works out at Bs.
9 3-sd. in the £ for large companies—a clamor
which is causing Premier Massey peculiar
embarrassment by reason of the fact that
an election is due in December. If the in-
come-tax is maintained at its present level, all
income-taxpayers, big and little, are going to
be antagonist. On the other hand, if the
rate is reduced, it can only be met by (1)
increasing income in other directions, and, so
far, nobody has been able to discover them;
or (2) by reducing expenditure, which would
increase unemployment and have a disastrous
effect otherwise on the Government’s elec-
tion prospects. The third possibility is a
deficit, and as this year’s Budget is already
facing one of more than three millions, any
suggestion to increase the calamity would
get a bad, not to say, vituperative, hearing.
In the meantime, Prime Minister Massey
lias been expending quite a lot of eloquence in
proving that taxation in the Dominion is less
than it Is in the Commonwealth. In the
House recently he tried. to bluff a member,
who had compared the M.L. with the Aus-
tralian figures by claiming that he ( Massey )
was the only man in the country who had
the latest Australian figures. In reply the
Government’s critic produced a cable he had
just received from Melbourne, the contents
of which proved the point he was striving
to make up t° the hilt. The last five years
compare as follows :

At the 1919 election the Government made
itself popular by distributing over £6,000,000
in cash gratuities to returned soldiers, on
top of the biggest boom in trade that the
Dominion has ever known. It is now gener-
ally admitted that the pouring out of this
vast sum, coming at the end of a year dur-
ing which the Government had already cre-
ated a boom by spending £17,000,000 out of
war surpluses in buying land at the top of
the market for returned soldiers, was one
.of the direct causes of the collapse a year
later. It induced buying on an unprece-
dented scale in a market of depleted im-
ported stocks. Importers doubled or trebled
their indents, in their efforts to keep pace
with the unexpected demand, and grew care-


less as to the great mass of accumulated
unexecuted orders piling up in England and
America. These orders descended on tne
embarrassed traders like an avalanche six
months later. Whereas imports for the 1-
mouths ending March, 1920, were valued at
£32,162,029. for the following 12 months they
amounted to £67,463,269. probably the heavi-
est importation per head of population that
has ever been registered by any country m
the world. Exports gave only £48,119,01-,
and the inevitable happened; a financial
stringency which had not been paralleled
since the early ’nineties. For the June
quarter of 1920 deposits exceeded advances
by £19,808,511: but by the June quarter of
1921 the advances were on top to the tune
of £8,874,382 —a most dramatic change. It
is true that the position is improving. Dur-
ing the year ending June, 1921, the imports
exceeded exports by £15,000,000, and returns
for the year ending June, 1922, show an
excess of exports valued at £14,000,000. But
the country has to go a long way yet
before it emerges from the financial wood in
which the war-boom landed it.
SOME THOUGHTS ON LIQUOR
REFORM.
The strength of the Prohibitionist move-
ment lies chiefly in the total lack of any
constructive liquor-reform policy on the
part of the other side. People who know
exactly what they want usually get it, no
matter how disastrous the achievement may
be to the rest of the community. Only
habitual drunkards desire the perpetuation
of those existing conditions, which induce
drunkenness. Only fools will believe, with
me evidence of the last 75 years before them,
that Prohibition on U.S. lines is capable of
abolishing drunkenness. America is as
drunken to-day as it was before the Vol-
stead Act materialised, though it is less so,
of course, than it was quarter of a century
ago. But Australia is also soberer it
used to be, and for the same reason. The
world will never forego alcohol altogether,
but it can be made so much less alcoholic
that an inebriate will be an offence; and
that state of affairs ought to be the aim of
the liquor-reformer.
* . * * #
A Sydney clergyman, writing in one of the
morning papers last week, suggested that
the Churches should leave adults alone in
this respect, and concentrate on the children.
He got there to the very heart of the
problem. It is a tragic fact that drunkenness
is still more or less fashionable throughout
the British Empire. Not So much so as it
was; but still enough to do infinite damage.
Youth does not set out to achieve drun-
kenness. It drifts there along a path broad
and easy. Women in Australia are less
addicted to drink than men. This is not
owing to any greater virtue on their part:
but because convention has made it more
difficult for them to get drunk respectably.
The goal ahead of the practical drink-re-
former is, therefore, to make intoxication
not merely unheroic but shameful, whether
indulged in by male or female. An insuper-
able obstacle to anything like national sobri-
ety must always be, of course, the sea-
soned drinker ready to go through fire and
water and majority-made laws to obtain
his accustomed dope. He should be accepted,
to begin with, as a necessary evil and
licensed. It is as logical to license drinkers
as it is to license drinking-places. As a be-
ginning a license for life to consume
alcoholic liquors should be granted to
anyone applying for it, except minors
at* law. Minors at the time of the
inauguration of the system would never
become eligible. To keep guard over
the unlicensed minors, the practice ot taking
a bottle home would have to go. Practically
all home-drinking would be barred unless
the licensee was in a position to prove he
was a hermit and lived in a wilderness or
with other licensees. The licensed grocer,
who is how responsible for most of the
women drunkards, would have to go. The
sociable, but calamitous, custom of shouting,
which brings in a lot of new recruits to
drink, would be made illegal. As time went
on the aleoholist might thus be stamped as
old-fashioned. He might begin to stand for
the queer fashion of a bygone age. The
younger set would be inclined to poke quiet
fun at the old fogey’s indulgences. A little
healthy ridicule would probably do more to
put drink to rout than the heaviest sermons
ever fired. #
It might be urged that a free-born Brit-
isher would never agree to produce a license,
and possibly a birth-certificate, on paying
for his drink. But Britishers, in queues,
stood similar interferences when they pro-
duced their coupons for such necessaries as
bread and butter and sugar- and meat during
the war ; and —in the interests of the younger
generation —'they would be likely tb suffer as
much again. Almost any father is ready to in-
sist on a Spartan regime in the interests of his
son. though he may be too weak to impose it
on himself. And even a member of the demi-
monde may desire her daughter to be moder-
ately virtuous. Having thrown a barrage
up against the entry of youth into the alco-
holic zone, reformers, whilst waiting for re-
sults. might turn their attention to the
character of drink as now sold. Many cases
of alcoholic poisoning, delirium tremens
and plain murder are due, not to wine or
beer, but to bad beer and bad wine. An effec-
tive antidote might be a general lowering of
the alcoholic standard of all drinks. Something
of the sort took place in the U.K. during
the war, with marked effect on the pulse of
British drunkenness. Australian wines win
praise at. foreign exhibitions; yet. cheap
wines, as ordinarily sold in Australia, pro-
duce fearsome results. These effects are
noticeably absent in countries such as France
and Italy, where large quantities of inexpen-
sive wines are consumed by the poor. Pos-
sibly liquor-trading hours might be clipped,
or adjusted, to coincide with the principal
meal hours on the ground that a good meal
tempers even a bad drink. The present
trading hours practically cut out the even-
ing meal. Probably, with a gradual tran-
sition, matters would adjust themselves.
Hotels would develop the hostel and recre-
ative side of their business, bars lose their
punch, and perhaps, at last, the remnant of
the licensed legion would have to line up
to the chemist’s counter for their refresh-
ment —the chemist, of course, possessing the
right to stock medicinal alcohol. And such
a miserable thing is human nature that, by
that time, the wowsers being all dead, tne
worst examples of drink out of sight and many
of its evils forgotten, quaint myths of the fine
old drinking days might be written up and
Time’s cantankerous pendulum might swing
back from an era of comparative soberness.
Yet, on the other hand, the young having got
the temperance habit, might "keep it and hand
it on as a tradition like the surf-bathing, or
tennis- or golf-playing habit. It is an eventu-
ality worth working for, and it gives
points and to spare to the bludgeoning
methods prescribed by the Yankee prohibi-
tionist agitator who is in our midst at the
moment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another War?
Another war, in which Britain and Turkey
found themselves ranged on opposite sides,
would have disastrous consequences to the
Empire whichever way it went. Indian un-
rest has travelled a long way since 1914, and
if the Turks are defeated now by a Chris-
tian combination of Powers, it is doubtful
if any white garrison will be able to bold
what used to be known as the brightest jewel
in the Imperial diadem. On the other hand,
if another entente is defeated, it is Russia
that will win—the cabled item on Monday
concerning the mobilisation of the entire
Russian Army being particularly ominous
in this connection. The Russians claim to
be able to put 5,000,000 men into the field
to-day, equipped with weapons and stores
which, if not of the highest quality, are,
anyhow, superior to anything issued to the
rank and file under the Imperial regime.
However, if Britain is ever defeated in Turkey
it will not matter greatly who enjoys the
distinction of doing it, for the Empire will
fall. Such a catastrophe would give a
Turko-Russian combination command of the
strategic centre of the Empire. Lloyd
George’s cry for help to the Dominions can
mean nothing but that his Government is
unable to trust the British workers to re-
spond to another call to arms; that there
is fear in Downing-street of another rebuff
from those classes without whose co-opera-
tion no great war can be undertaken, simi-
lar to the one which blanketed Churchill's
proposed adventure in Russia. It is hoped,
apparently, that with a decisive lead from
overseas the disillusioned British unionist may
be shamed into facing the music, whether in
munition-shop or trench. As for Australia,
nothing shows more clearly how out of touch
our modern Labor leaders are with the spirit
of the country than Matthew Charlton’s
forecast on Monday that the workers of the
Commonwealth would have nothing to do
with anoth6r war in Turkey—implying there-
by that it was no concern of theirs. The
truth is, as probably 90 per cent, of Aus-
tralian workers know', if war comes
in the Near East, and if Britain
goes down, or even fails to, score a straight-
out victory, Australia cannot live. The
British working-man who refuses to fight for
the path to India will certainly not fight to
save Australia; and for our own part, both
on sea and on land, we have deliberately
rendered ourselves defenceless. No: the
Australian worker may be relied on to enlist
again if he is wmnted, partly for reasons of
self-interest, but partly, also, from a sense
of duty to the country 12,000 miles away
which has made his national existence pos-
sible. There may be no war (even the most
poignant situations are capable of last-
minute adjustments) ; or w'ar may be de-
layed, and when it does come it may be
localised; and finally there may be another
general war. It is towards this goal that
the Russians are clearly working. They
have all to gain and nothing to lose by the
overthrow of civilisation as we understand
it. Their position is that of the tailless fox
in the fable. And, after the Russians, the
Turks are perhaps best fitted of any more
or less white folks for a reversion to primi-
tive conditions of culture and comfort. Un-
less the diplomatists are better intentioned
and more skilful than they were eight years
ago another world-war may emerge from the
present trouble; and with it the downfall of
the capitalistic system, the smashing of the
machine that has taken the world 70 cen-
turies or more to construct, and starvation
for the town-dwelling races which have
largely lost the art of tearing the means of
subsistence out of the bosom of Nature.
•
Aiming at Hughes and Hitting
Australia.
The damaging attack last week by German
propagandists on Australia’s administration
of the Hun’s late Pacific possessions is an
outcome, largely, of the Age’s recent efforts
to damage W. M. Hughes. For months that
paper has been producing reasons to prove
that the Commonwealth is unfit to have the
care of any colony, and to demonstrate that
our performances in the islands amount to
an abuse of the League of Nations’ trust.
No charge was too wild and no charge-
leveller too irresponsible or discredited to be
denied the hospitality of the paper’s columns.
And the outcome may be disastrous. Aus-
tralia has not been given the German posses-
sions for good: it is merely in the position
of a trustee, who, at regular intervals, will
be required to submit accounts to a superior
Court. Yet articles and photographs, illus-
trating alleged instances of cruelty to the
natives whom it was Australia’s duty as a
mandatory power to protect, have appeared,
and statistics have been quoted designed to
show that the Commonwealth’s policy has
resulted ip the ruin of the staple indus-
tries of places like Rabaul and Nauru.
Many of the cases cited had no foun-
dation in fact, or else contained a sub-
stratum of truth overlaid with thick layers
of exaggeration —as in the instance, dis-
covered by the Age. of the native who was
tortured by being suspended by his fingers
for six hours. The League has stated its
objection to the principle of ownership in
perpetuo, and has announced that it will go
no further than to issue mandates which are
to be continually subject to revision. By
this very revision it is always on the eards
that a mandate may be revoked and given to
some other country; perhaps one which is
more friendly to Germany than Australia.
The sole necessity would be to show that the
mandatory power was not fulfilling its obli-
gations, or that it was exceeding the
authority that had been given to it. It is
not to the open meetings of the League’s
committees that propaganda will be directed
with the object of showing that the Common-
wealth has made a mess of things, but to
individual members of the committees. And
what better proof could a pro-German agent
have in support of his case than a bundle of
Australian newspapers containing articles
that are German in all but language?
Already there are indications that some of
the support upon which Australia could
formerly depend is waning, and it is well
within the bounds of possibility that the
League, having been duly impressed by the
statements of Little Australia, may inflict
upon this country the supreme national de-
gradation of taking away the colonies with
whose administration we have been entrusted.
Australia is probably the >only country
amongst the mandatory Powers, or, for that
matter, in the world, possessing reputable
and influential organs whose aim it is,
purely for the purpose of party advantage,
to demonstrate that it is not as cap-
able or as efficient as other nations had
given it credit for being. Certain it is,
anyhow, that one might search long and
vainly in the columns of French, Japanese,
Italian or United States papers for state-
ments to the effect that any of those coun-
tries was .not competent to carry out any
national job that had been handed to it.
The Useless Mouths.
It was cabled from London last week
that the great Australian immigration
drive had begun. The time has been
chosen, apparently, to suit the con-
venience of Britain rather than that of
Australia. Australia can certainly find jobs
for men who have the knowledge and the
grit necessary to a. life out back. But there
are no jobs at present for laborers and few
enough for artisans. For the few that offer
our own army of unemployed, and more par-
ticularly our unemployed soldiers, have a
right to first choice. Britain, of course, has
an appalling unemployment problem, and is
apprehensive of what this coming winter
may bring forth in the way of hunger riots.
To Britain, every emigrant means one mouth
less to feed, which accounts for the Govern-
ment’s enthusiasm to push people over-
seas in immense numbers. If nothing is
done to arrange for the selection of suitable
types and for their absorption on arrival,
Australia is going to be confronted with a
problem containing all the elements of a
national disaster. The dissatisfied immi-
grant is the Commonwealth’s most promis-
ing Bolshevik, as past experience has many
times proved. Town-bred immigrants,
brought out in the pious hope that they
may settle on the land, have often never
tried so to do, or, having tried and failed,
have drifted back to unskilled work in the
cities. To mich men Woolloomooloo or
Footscray, as the case may be, has a very
home-like look, and consequently they settle
in these and similar slums. Lacking the
comfort and easy companionship of the
pub, w T hicb shuts at 6 o’clock, the Trades
Hall gives an opportunity for sociability.
Jock Garden and other astute agitators
have made the most of this fact, and of the
material it has placed at their disposal. Up
to the present the only activities undertaken
by the upbeavalists have been the passing of
resolutions sympathetic to communist
Russia, or to the rebels on the Rand. Yet
these sports are not so harmless as they
appear. Continued talk in praise of vio-
lence will in time loosen the restraining
sanctions, and the result is not pleasant to
contemplate. Australia, if only from elemen-
tary considerations of self-preservation,
should first select her new citizens with
special care, and next and even more im-
portant, organise their absorption to the
last detail. The Commonwealth has enough
genuine suffering and discontent already
without, whether wilfully or through mere
lack of energy, importing a further consign-
ment.
Cocks in Pursuit of a Surplus.
There is the promise of financial righteous-
ness in Cocks, the N. S. Wales Treasurer.
His Budget speech was a weighty essay on
the folly of (1) vigorous borrowing policies,
(2) public works to absorb the unemployed
and develop the potentialities of this great
country, and (8) securing the workers the
full results of theft labor by extending the
economic function of the State. Because
a generation of dull politicians, Tory and
Labor, has persisted in these mad courses,
N. S. Wales is suffering from a plague of
financial embarrassments; also, its Treasurer
is immersed in trouble and is acquainted
with gloom. The borrowing has been so
vigorous that on June 80 the public debt
stood at £170,000,000, and “some of the
money,” says Cocks, with a candor rare,
though incomplete, “has been thrown away.”
Not only that, but loans amounting to 101
millions fall due this year, and no provision
has been made to meet them. Since 1918-19,
owing to a special outbreak of enthusiasm
for borrowing and absorbing the unemployed,
the annual interest hill has jumped from
£5,680,000 to £8,318,000, although the
Commonwealth Government played up
£16,000,000 in N. S. Wales during the same
period. And, inasmuch as more loans are
needed to complete the works started by the
last Government to absorb the unabsorbable,
and us Coiien is, quite naturally, increasing
his exactions (“there is every indication that
the average rate of interest on the whole of
our loans will approximate £5 ss. per cent,
at the end of the year,” whereas it was
£3 13s. 4d. per cent, in 1914), a further
large jump is in prospect. The loss on ex-
tending the economic function of the State
to sawn oregon and trawled flathead
amounted last year to £90,000 on the Gov-
ernment timber-yards and £47,000 (£14,000
more than the first estimate) on the hapless
trawlers and fish-shops. In a whole-hearted
attempt to buy the cocky vote the Labor
Government guaranteed the farmers about
£1,000,000 more than their wheat was worth
Besides this, there was a deficit in 1921-22
of £1,329,000. Cooks, for his part, has
undertaken to produce a surplus of £6OOO.
He has shown some energy in cutting down
the estimates, and some courage in resisting
the demand of the citv press for reductions
in Sydney railway and tramway fares. It is
also to his credit that he proposes to end
the scandal of granting immunity from
income-tax to single men and women in re-
ceipt of £250 per annum, while married men
have to contribute from their earnings above
that figure (in many cases they are really
worse off) at least Is. 3d. in the £. For vote-
catching purposes the people who pay
income-tax in a country with a population
of 2,100.000, and whei'e legions of profes-
sional gamblers are nourished by the privi-
leged class, are limited to 85,000. Cocks
purposes increasing the number, and distri-
buting the burden of taxation more equi-
tably, by bringing the exemption down to
£2OO. He has also pledged himself to “give
considerable relief to taxpayers with moder-
ate incomes,” a class which has hitherto been
pursued with pitiless ferocity, and which can
neither dodge its heavy imposts nor pass
them on. Cocks anticipates a drop in
revenue, as compared with the year in which
his Labor predecessor went £1,329,000 to
the bad, of £302,000, If he turns that to the
account of a credit balance, and if in other
respects his practice is as good as his pre-
cept, he will have earned his salary. A
thing which can’t with justice be said of
any N. S. Wales Treasurer since God knows
when.
What’s Wrong with the Sky-pilots?
From one of them: —
The question here raised is not what is wrong with
Christianity, but what is wrong with some of those
who claim to be the exponents of it? That something
is wrong few will deny. The leaders of the differ-
ent denominations are for ever deploring the fact.
And it is worth remarking that the average car-
toonist, actor, etc., is very much at home when he
lays “the cloth” under contribution for the purpose
of illustrating something grotesque or futile. He
is at home because the attitude which he adopts
represents the mental attitude of the multitude; and
he knows it all too well. Why should this be so?
Is it because of the caste aspect of clericalism, which
to many seeijis out of harmony with the natural
simplicity of the Founder of Christianity, and especi-
ally so when a distinctive uniform is assumed ?
This may be at any rate a part explanation. Early
Christianity made no provision for, and pure Chris-
tianity has no place for, such vanities. The “com-
mon people” who heard the Christ “gladliy,” are
asking in their children: Why this distinctive dress ?
Why the vestments, the peculiarly-cut coats, the
gaiters, the aprons and the bulldog collars? Why
should men who seek to influence their fellows be
arrayed differently from the men whom they seek
to better, when it is never in points of difference
that one influences his fellows, but in points of
similarity? If we sky-pilots were more natural,
and were allowed to put aside our professional frills
and airs, our chances of acquiring influence and using
it for good might be enhanced. There is no reason
in the world why these gauds should be retained,
since none of them form any jntegral part of Chris-
tianity. They may have had their uses in the .past,
hut to-day they are more a hindrance than a help.
Again, why our continued insistence on dogma ?
Why worry people about the creeds of the past?
These were framed by men who doubtless believed
them, and, so far, so good. But why make them
fetters for the present ? Few' scientists will accept
scientific data that goes back beyond a decade or
two. Whilst truth is ever truth, men’s views of
it are ever changing and enlarging. Why, for example,
preach the old theological Hell, in which intelli-
gent men have ceased to believe, or a materialised
Heaven so dear to the imagination of the hymnist
—and the Mahommedan Arab? And why continue
to theologise God, reducing Him to a capricious par-
His Creed.

tisan, to whom a people in war-time can turn and
use to the detriment of other people, no less dear
to the heart of Universal Fatherhood? The fact is,
the churches have succumbed to temptation,
and are exploiting Christianity. The original
idea of the Christ could not have been the creation
of churches for their own pride and glorification, as
we see them to-day. Rather, His idea was that
His followers would be the simple but effective instru-
ment of that kingdom of social service and justice
which He sought to establish. But, what moral
and social dynamics of righteousness are the
churches projecting to-day upon the community?
What, for example, is the ethical effect of their
presence upon the sweating, exploitation, rack-rent-
ing, prostitution, gambling and slumdom that ravage
all our great cities? Chesterton has said that
Christianity applied is “hot enough to boil society
to rags.” Can it be that the churches are afraid
to apply it, for fear their own little mechanism
should suffer? Christianity is revolutionary, or it
is nothing. Dare the churches be revolutionary?
Dare they stand by the moral, social and political
implications of the principles of the Galilean? If
so, there is not a system, social, economic, industrial,
or even ecclesiastical, they would not assail and
seek either to drastically alter or to destroy.
A Tale of Folly and Ruin.
N.S.W.’s soldier-settlement scheme looks
like coming to partial, if not total, smash.
Begun in a wave of hysteria in 191 b, a few
months prior to the 1917 general election
it was rushed forward under the control of
a Minister whom long continuance in office
had rendered autocratic, while he had for
lieutenant one totally devoid of experience
of Lands administration. The stunt was
speeded up by the Nationalists during 1919
for electioneering purposes. Being a money-
spending affair pure and simple, it naturally
attracted the attention of the usual crowd
that sees in extensive Government expendi-
ture a chance to rake in easy money. A
special Act was passed, the main feature of
which was the granting to each settler of an
advance of £SOO. A later amendment in-
creased the sum to £625. The cry went up
that land was wanted —not Crown land,
which the Diggers would have had to clear
and fence, but improved properties. The
noise was immediately heard by the land
profiteers, and they dejuged the Department
with offers —at a substantial increase on
current market values. A few purchases
were made in cash, but most of the estates
were acquired under the provisions of the
Closer Settlement Act, and in resoect of
them payments were made in bonds. Practi-
cally all “paper purchases” of this kind are
on a basis of over-valuation, which, however
slight, cripples the unfortunate who acquires
the land. If the property is subdivided on
the basis of the amount spent, making each
farm worth, say, £BOOO, he* is likely to go on
to a block which is less than a living area.
If, on the other hand, he takes up a living
area, he finds in time that the value placed
on it is too high. As land values were
booming at the time the Government went
into the market, and continued to boom in-
creasingly as long as it remained in, the fair
market value of the land at date of purchase
was vastly higher than it is to-day. On top
of this the prices for wool, meat, and wheat
have gone down. The Digger-settlers are
required to pay in cash for what the Gov-
ernment bought with, bonds, and as cash
grows scarcer and scarcer the outlook grows
blacker and blacker. To add to their
troubles, most of them went to the limit of
their £625 advances: and then came the
drought. The growth of the staff to administer
the scheme was phenomenal. It was recruited
from all quarters, and of course political in-
fluence played its part. The various changes
of policy, the constant political log-rolling,
and the revelation of scandals have no doubt-
hampered the staff. But, anyhow, it never
had a fair chance. A sum variously esti-
mated at between 12 and 15 millions sterling
has been blewed, and, if half of it is ever
repaid, the State will have a right to con-
sider itself lucky. The Digger-settler swears
and opines that he is stiff, while the fool
public growls that somebody wants shooting
—and prepares cheerfully to vote for that
somebody, or one exactly like him, at the
next election.
The Might of Asia.
Dear B., —Far be it from me to preach before
Buddha, but I have my own theory on
“Asia’s Quiver,” and it is different from
that of “Fengshui” (B. 10/8/’22). The
blame for the “teeming millions of Asia”
rests largely on the white races, and for the
reason that the whites have interfered with
the course of Oriental development, and will
have to pay the usual penalty of meddlers.
An old China hand once said to me: “The
curse of the whites in the East is that they
believe themselves so damned superior to
everything Oriental.” They do, and they
insist on shoving their religion, ethics, econo-
mics and everything else down the Oriental’s
throat, a process mostly accomnlished by
the superiority of their guns. Orientals are
polygamous. Polygamy cannot exist without
birth-control. Western influence has depre-
ciated polygamy and abolished birth-control.
Simultaneously, the West is practising birth-
control and, by the divorce-court records, also
polygamy. The result is that Eastern popu-
lations vastly outnumber Western popula-
tions, and, as the late Count Okuma said,
compensate for Western scientific superiority.
At the same time, the West cannot populate
the vast territories it has appropriated, whilst
the territories which the yellow races con-
trol cannot support their populations. There
is the whole problem of the “Yellow Peril.”
Take the case of Japan. The Japanese are
a polygamous race by nature, and until 1894
by law. The concubine is still a recognised
institution, and her, offspring legalised. In
the days of the Shogunati there was a regu-
lar system of birth-control, based on the
carrying capacity of the arable land, and
enforced by the local daimyo. It was called
ma-biki, a horticultural expression meaning
weeding out, also translated in the diction-
aries as “infanticide.” Where ma-biki was
in force no family was permitted to have
more than one child within two years. Any
excess was weeded out. It is still practised in
Kyoto and Kagoshima provinces. Again, a
survival of birth-control is to be seen in the
custom of tightening the pregnant woman’s
obi in the fifth month, a practice originally
designed to induce premature birth. Ma-
biki was introduced into Japan from China,
where it is still widely nractised, especially in
regard to female infants; while it is to be seen
in Shantung. Kwantung and Kansu in regard
to males: Western influence has been largely
directed to breaking down polygamy and birth-
control, or actually life-control. The result
is that polygamy legally has disappeared in
NOBODY LOVES A PLAIN GIRL.
Japan: concubinage is disappearing, and
illicit prostitution and ex-nuptial births are
booming. Birth-control has disappeared to
such an extent that the younger generations
do not even know the meaning of the word
ma-biki; and the authorities actively dis-
courage any propaganda for birth-control, as
seen in the recent visit of Mrs. Margaret
Sangar. Much the same is happening in
China. Li Hung Chang refused to allow
the Hoang Ho to be canalised, as it was a
vital safety-valve against over-population.
“Christianity,” he said, “does not approve of
Chinese methods of restricting population,
so we have to rely more and more on
Nature.” To what extent has the Yellow
Peril menace been caused by the smug inter-
ference of the West with the East? There
is no doubt that the standard of life in the
East has fallen very considerably since the
arrival of the West. This is not only due
to population, but to the methods of Western
civilisation and intercourse. Higher educa-
tion means higher taxation. Battle-cruisers
cost money, and a lot of it. Railways have
speeded life up all round. But the net result,
so far as the people are concerned, of all
modern adoptions has been a greater struggle
to live, and a very distinct unrest with their
lot. It is at least notable that the great
diplomats of the early days of intercourse
with China and Japan—such men as Elgin,
Parkes, Alcock —never anticipated any
menace to the West from the East. To-day
there is a real menace. The West has kicked
open an antheap. On the other hand, there
were long-headed Orientals who foresaw
what would happen, and their successors to-
day are preparing for eventualities. —Yours,
Yelcop.
From “Godoy,” who is a South Oss Liberal:
Premier Barwell, of Black Australia celebrity,
has broken out in a new place. Preparatory to
doubling the Parliamentary screws he uttered his
great slogan, “Wages must come down.” In pur-
suance of this ideal he is introducing a bill de-
signed to destroy 80 wages boards and substitute a
fantastic system of voluntary conciliation. Employers
in the smaller industries, realising that this must
eventually throw all industrial squabbles into the
Federal Arbitration Court, are almost as hostile to
the bill as the Labor party. The latter, however,
will ultimately gain, as the certain mess that must
ensue will give them five suburban seats at the next
State election, owing to the inevitable stampede of
Nationalist Laborites back to the fold. The amaz-
ing feature of the position is that the Liberals are
pledged by a platform carried last year, and re-
affirmed this month, to the “maintenance of the
wages-board system.” There is a growing feeling
within the party that a position on the Supreme
Court Bench should be found for this impetuous
reactionary. Politics is not his game.
e
“Agricolazyph” : A Bulletin writer
(17/8/’22) advocates the inclusion of cotton in
rotation with other crops, and quotes, as an
example of the evil attending the continuous
planting of one crop, the experience of South
Australian farmers, who are finding that
superphosphate with wheat is losing its
magic. It is also alleged that Warrnambool
spuddists are getting: neither quantity nor
quality in their potatoes, fertilise as heavily
as they may. By all means have rotation
of crops, and, where possible, include cotton
in it, hut for the sake of the increased per
acre yields in practically all forms of cul-
tivation. which Australia so badly needs, let
us have our farmers educated to a more lib-
eral and comprehensive manorial practice.
Most of them know only superphosphate, and
the wonder is that it is not also used for
veterinary purposes. Man does not live by
bread alone, and neither can wheat nor any
other plant subsist on an exclusive diet of
phosphoric acid. The farmers’ faith in a
purely phosphoric-acid manure for all re-
ouirements is largely the result of leaving
fertiliser research work to the artificial-fer-
tiliser manufacturing organisations, who, if
one may judge by their propaganda, concen-
trate all their sales efforts on “super.” The
solution of the difficulties in South Aus-
tralia and at Warrnambool would appear to
be the use of “complete” manures, that is,
manures combining the three elements—
nitrogen, potash and phosphoric acid, but it is
debatable whether the manufacturers could
be prevailed or to put up such mixtures. Cer-
tainly, the man who is to benefit by them will
not do the mixing himself. Allegedly effete
old Europe can show us a few agricultural
wrinkles, and when England woke up to the
fact that food supplies were likely to be-
come short during the war, locally-produced
sulphate of ammonia, which had hitherto
been exported to her foreign neighbors, was
diverted to local avenues of use. By utilising
internal fertiliser resources home-grown food-
products rose from something like 25 per
cent, of the consumption to 80 per cent. Now
nitrogen is. regarded as a negligible quantity
in Australian farming, but in Europe gen-
erally, and in the country infested by our
enemy in the recent unpleasantness particu-
larly, this element occupies the most promi-
nent place in agriculture, as evidenced by
the expenditure of huge sums in the erection
of nitrogen fixation plants, notably at
Oppau, where the poison gas came from.
While waiting for our agricultural colleges
and universities to supplant the fertiliser
manufacturer, as his educators, Wirewhis-
kers ruminates on “super” having lost its
kick, and allows our Australian-made nitro-
genous manure—sulphate of ammonia—to go
to our colored brother in Java or Japan.
And, periodically, our colored brother shows
his appreciation by returning to us some of
the produce he has grown with his purchase.
From a harassed business-man:—
The Commonwealth postal regulations provide an
impregnable fortress for the protection of Incom-
petency. So many delays and mutilations i'n tele-
grams have occurred in recent years that in some
cases it has been found advisable not to fully act
on the contents of a telegram until the postal con-
firmation (a private safeguard) arrives. Should the
telegram be delayed, mutilated or lost the complain-
ant has regulations 346 and 232 indicated to him.
They read: —
346.—N0 responsibility shall be undertaken, nor
any claim for compensation entertained, for any
errors or mistakes in transmission or delay in de-
livery of telegrams, whether repeated or unrepeated ;
or for non-transmission or non-delivery of tele-
grams, from whatever cause such errors or mistakes
in transmission, or delay in transmission or delivery,
or non-transmission or non-delivery may arise.
232.— Where a telegram is lost, or mutilated in
transit, and therefore becomes useless as far as the
sender is concerned, the Postmaster-General may, as
an act of grace, and not in consequence of any legal
liability, refund the amount paid for transmission.
The “act of grace,” referred to in the latter regula-
tion, occurs when the defaulting officer has been so
overcome with the realisation of the calamity com-
mitted that he has paid the original charges out of
his own pocket. Business circles in Vermont
(U.S.A.) became so annoyed over the lax methods
of its private telegraph companies that the State
Legislature passed a “Mental Anguish Law,” which
provided: “Any telegraph company, doing business in
the State of Vermont, shall be liable for damages
for mental anguish or suffering, even in the absence
of bodily injury or pecuniary loss, caused by negli-
gence in receiving, transmitting or delivering mes-
sages.” Such a law in Australia would be a salu-
tary spur in the lethargic flanks of our pampered
Government calf. As an instance of the present
position, my firm received an order, some time ago,
by wire, and acted on it. A month later a second
telegram arrived giving a similar order. A second
consignment was naturally forwarded. It turned
out later that the telegram had been duplicated by
the telegraph authorities, and the second consignment
of perishable goods was refused by the consignee
and had to be sacrificed. We sent in a bill to the
Department, and were informed that “the circum-
stances were regretted.” but that “the officer at fault
had been suitably dealt with.” Mutilations in mone-
tary amounts, and in quantities, often cause heavy
loss to the business community and a refund of a
paltry shilling, as an act of grace, adds salt to the
injury. Vermont’s law would be welcome here.
The only trouble is that, if the Government
Were “stung” on account of laxity, the attempt at
fixing responsibility would resolve into a depart-
mental head-hunt, and some junior would doubtless
be chosen as a scapegoat.
•
“Solomon Malaprop,” pessimistic as usual:
Theoretically, the Communist or Bolshevik element
is an inconsiderable minority in Australia (as it,
like the army and the nobility, is everywhere else),
and. theoretically, the level-headed working-class
majority (represented by the eminently reasonable
strikers of Broken Hill and Newcastle) will ne\er
allow it to be other than inconsiderable. All the
same, the official Labor programme nowadays is
blank Bolshevism and revolution, as even Theodore
was moved to tell the party bosses at Brisbane. And
as Jesuit programmes don’t blossom on Primitive
Methodist trees, or vice versa, people are moved to
judge accordingly. The Council of Action is a
revolutionary body, which is allowed to represent
Labor, and its avowed object is to supersede the
Parliament of All the People, and run Australia.
It is Imperially Federated with the Red Inter-
national of Moscow, in the land which the Commu-
nists have reduced to cannibalism; and it receives
advice and instructions from it as to how Australia
should be managed. It decided lately in favor of a
policy of go-slow and reduced output and “irritation
strikes,” not for the redress of any specific griev-
ances, but to reduce the country to such a condition
of weakness and disorder that it will fall an easy
prey to the brigand Council, which takes its tip
from Moscow. A strenuous ruler might have it
enacted that bogus Parliaments which conspire
against the industry, the production and the self-
governing rights of the people are not allowed. He
might have the Council declared an illegal associ-
ation, its funds seized, its correspondence (especi-
ally that with Moscow) stopped, its members (if
they didn’t subside) arrested. But, unless such a
man arises the Council of Action will win. Courage
always wins. The workers will obey its orders to
reduce production to a minimum, and to stop pro-
duction altogether when ordered, as they have done
and are doing now, so long as the Council of Action
is the stronger force. And it will be the stronger
force so long as the people’s Government insists on
being the weaker force.

Afraid of losing the seat, the Bendigo
Liberals, backed by the Argus, are making
frantic efforts to induce Premier Lawson to
nominate when Hughes flits to North Syd-

remain in State politics as long as lie is
wanted as a leader, and defeat of t lie M uiis-
try is the only thing that can release him.
He is not going to ride for a fall.
Mindful of his past services and present
sickness, the Westralian Primary Producers,
who control the Country party, have over-
looked Gregory’s outbreak of Hughesisrn last
year and endorsed his candidature for Dam-
pier. It is a kindly act, for poor little
Gregory is in no condition to take on a light
with his old friends. In fact, the indications
are that lie will be unable to do any active
electioneering when the present House ot
Reps, goes out of business.
It is asserted by the graziers that “nearly
5000 unionists” are shearing in N. S. Wales
on Federal award terms. If this is true, or
only 50 per cent, true, then the strike
against the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court is the greatest, as well as the latest,
of the A.W.U. executive’s many blunders,
and the union has suffered a. serious loss ot
revenue as well as a smashing blow to its
prestige. One of the ironies of the situat on
is that the Westralian shearers are working
for the 355. a hundred that the Sydney
ward bosses turned down, the possibility ot
extracting another ss. from the Groperland
squatters having been dismissed as hope-
less. It was an evil day for the chap who
dissevers the sheep from his overcoat when

of the union rejected the policy of Spence

It leaves the way clear for the complete clearance

rump which has so long dominated Federal polities,
and presages the early dissolution all over Australi

take place either previous to or just after the election.

favor was upset on appeal, Ted liiley, a
bright young Digger, easily won the Labor
nomination for Cook, polling 523 votes to
346 scored by Arthur, one of the A.W.U.
heads. Riley senior is M.H.R. for South Syd-
ney, and before that was Labor rep. on the
first N.S.W. Arbitration Court, succeeding
Sam Smith. A daughter married Walter
Duncan, now a Nationalist Senator. Cook
is a Labor electorate; but young Riley will

"Gallery”: When the remission of duties
on wire-netting and galvanised-iron was
mentioned in the Reps, the other day, the
only commentator in the Corner was
Stewart, the artless young man from Echuca.
His complaint was that the relief didn’t go
far enough. Actually, the position is that
duties to the tune of £350,000 a year will
be cut out and that the manufacturers will
have their feelings partially mollified by a
present of £250,000 from the Treasury. It
is one of the most barefaced cases of
political bribery en masse on record; but. of
course, it is insisted that the party respon-
sible for it is acting from the highest patri-
otic motives.

in ’46, five years before self-government was
conceded to Vic. The “town of Melbourne’
was then in the Port Phillip district of “our
colony of New South Wales.” A quit rent
of a farthing, “if demanded,” was provided
for, and it was stipulated that the land was
to be used for no other purpose than a
market. The point has been raised whether
this condition has been violated by building
shops on the frontages and turning the base-
ment into a garage. Anyhow, the Council
wants a better title from the Vic. Parliament

In the redistribution of the Speck’s electoral
boundaries Wilmot, hitherto Llewellyn At-

place of ex-Premier Lee, now State Trea-

been altered most. It now comprises over
a third of the island, and has put Frank-
lin’s nose out of joint. Politically, Labor
will gain ground in Wilmot, through the in-
clusion of the eastern mining fields, but the
addition to Darwin of the populous agricul-
tural area between Forth and Devonport
will redress the balance.

Premier Fuller. Forty hours later he was
a dead man. On Thursday of last week
Robinson, M.L.C., who only got his appoint-
ment three months ago, made a vigorous
speech on the Lotteries Bill. Within 60
hours he, too, had gone to his account.
Robinson was an unbending Orangeman, but
generous according to his lights. Iu the
speech aforesaid he told the House proudly
that since he arrived in Australia, 36 years
ago, he had never missed making a weekly
contribution to the hospitals: also the
orphanage of which he was a director had
never raised a shilling by gambling.
“J.E.’s” opinion of it:—
A Sydney ex-politician recently returned from
Melbourne with the news that people there regard
Canberra as a joke. He could hardly have stated
the case better. Canberra was the achievement of
men of the Hughes-Reid-Lyne-Cook-Pumpkin Smith-
Bruce Smith type, who did not want Federation. Hav-
ing had the thing forced on them, they decided that
it should live in lodgings at Sydney, ami be under
the control of the State Parliament. That failing,
they plotted to put the Commonwealth in a mean
house, worthy of their hatred for the Federation —a
place which, as the anti-Federal Sydney Tkleuk.u'h
said joyously of Canberra, “would never be more
than a large country town." They overdid the
thing in the end, and the one fact which causes the
Seat of Government to linger indefinitely in Mel-
bourne is that Canberra, the only alternative, is too
mean, too hole-and-cornery, and too devoid of any
visible future. The English people had no love for
Charles 11., but he had a solid insurance on Iris
useless life;—no one would kill him off to leave room
for his brother James. Canberra is James to a
dot. The best of the joke is that it was the Can-
berra-ites who sent the Seat of Government to
Melbourne, which, but for them, hadn’t a hope. It
was the price the conspirators paid to ensure, by a
new clause in the Constitution, the fixing of tin-
capital in their State. If they had left well alone
Sydney might have been the permanent metropolis
after all.
Straws, ghostly straws, in the wind! At
last A.N.A. annual conference a motion was
brought forward that only Australian-born
politicians should be eligible for the Prime
Ministership. And Bendigo was where it
originated.
From the State that will see the eclipse
iirst: —
Charley Maley, member for Irwin in the Groper-
land Assembly 7, and brother of Harry Maley 7 , Minis-
ter for Agriculture in the Mitchell Cabinet, is as
silent a member as Bailey, of N. S. Wales. He
weighs 19 stone and has the heart of a boy 7. “When
'are you going to make a speech?” he was asked by
a pressman the other day. “Aren’t there enough
without me?” asked Charlie, indignantly. He added,
confidentially, “I was congratulated by one of the
Hansard men the other day.” “What did he Say?”
“He said 1 was the only man in Parliament who shut
that —— door properly.”
When the Theodore Government decided .to
resume a huge junk of Queensland for its
Burnett River scheme, it went into ecstasies
of admiration about the quality of the land.
Moved by these transports, the owners there-
of, or of 11 million acres of it, are demand-
ing £248,000 more than the Lands Depart-
merit’s estimate of its value, which is
£163,500. It is a familiar incident in the
history of Government land-booming. I nci ~
deutal'lv, one of the three railways which
will serve the Burnett area traverses the Fort
Curtis electorate, held by Fletcher, of the
Cocky party, by a majority so thin that the
pick-and-shovel vote is expected to obliterate
it. That, also, is a familiar incident in the
history of political jobbery.
"Gallery”: Melbourne Age is lamenting
the Ma State’s domination of the Federal
Parliament. In the Ileps. both the Speaker
and Chairman of Committees are from
N.S.W., as are the leader and deputy-leader
of the Country party and the head serang-
of the Labor crowd. In the Senate the
leaders of the Government and Opposition
also come from beyond the Murray, but since
the Cabbage Garden isn’t- represented in an
Opposition of two, complaint on that score
is rather ridiculous. But the greatest cause
for grief is the lessening of \ ictoria’s influ-
ence in the Cabinet. Hughes being now a
Sydney man, only Bruce and Rodgers are
left to voice Melbourne’s wrongs; and both
are committed to Canberra. The probabili-
ties are that the Priminister will drop one
of his fellow Ma Staters —probably either
llyrie or Lamond —and substitute a \ ic-
torian to maintain the balance of power.

Advertiser in fair circumstances, and a suitable per-

Quilpie is a hamlet on the western line,
much frequented by shearers and other good
unionists. But. according to the gospel oi
Bolsh, an Australian can’t be a good union-
ist nowadays unless he consents to be bis
brudder’s keeper.
On politicians who lacked the Hughes
touch; —
Hughes’s remarkable alacrity in getting out of
insecure seats as an alternative to being thrown out
reminds one that few front-rank British statesmen of
this last generation haven’t faced almost certain de-
feat at least once in preference to showing the white
feather. Oxford University went back on Glad
stone at a fairly early stage in liis career, but he
took it with a stiff upper lip. East Manchester
would have no more of Arthur Balfour in but
he faced the storm of unpopularity gamely and went
down with his colors flying. Doubtless lie could have
found a safe seat elsewhere as easily before the
general elections as, after them, but such action
would have been accepted as a craven admission
that the party he was leading feared the worst.
Asquith might have funked East Fife in 1918 —it
was perfectly clear that he wouldn’t be returned
without a desperate struggle—but such pusillanimity,
even if lie had been capable of it. would have hurt
him, in the end, twice as much as being defeated
there. Some years ago there was a well-known W.A.
journalist, noted for the pungency and brevity of his
judgments on his fellows, who, after listening to a
speech from Hughes, summed up the Priminister in
as few words as possible as “a wordspitiner without
guts.” One may wonder how many people at Ben-
digo have since arrived at the same conclusion.
There was a rumpus in Queensland Par-
liament recently about the scandal of over-
racing in Brisbane, which never has fewer
than four meetings a week, and occasionally
has six. For years Labor has been pledged
to curtail the evil, and there were unreason-
ing optimists who expected that something
would be done this session. But. coinciden-
tally with the visit of a good Labor man
from Melbourne, who described himself in
the witness-box the other day as "an inves-
tor,” reform was called off. The subject
was discussed by a group of politicians in
the Assembly bar. “I’d like to know what
is to be done about it,” an Opposition mem-
ber said. “He who Wrens may read,” a
colleague chipped in sagely.
“Rienzi”: John Lemmon, who has just
•been appointed chairman of the Pnblie
Accounts Committee in the Vic. Parliament,
is one of the few bright lights in George
Prendergast’s team. He was once a tailor’s
cutter, and sharpened his tongue for public
life in the A.N.A., of which he has been
president. Lemmon has had one term of
office —13 days in the only Labor Adminis-
tration that has reached the Treasury
benches in Victoria. Apropos of this
achievement, the newly-fledged Minister
once greeted a well-known pressman who had
just been delivered of a novel. “Author!”
ejaculated Lemmon mockingly to the red-
dening novelist; but it was his turn to
blush when a yell of “Statesman!” came in
reply.
THE GAME.

Tliis is tiie Promised Land of sport,
Of games that experts play ;

No greater expert shows his skill
In perfecting new tricks,

Of bringing grist to feed the mill.
Than he who plays with crafty Bill
The game of polities.
One sees the cost of government
Increasing year by year;
The money raised is gaily spent,
’Tis born to disappear.
Fat schemers plead for move “control.
Despite the protest shrill
From those who pay a higher toll
On beef and sugar, wool and coal.
The Fat man lias his log to roll,
And Bill makes out the bill.
Taxation never can decrease
Till government grows less;
Those war “controls" will never cease
Whilst Hughes outwits the press. .
His motto terse is “D~— n Expense!
And public cash lie “blews”
Through actions rash or negligence.

By granting us the commouscusc
To stop the game of Hughes—

Controlled by Bill-y Hughes.

*Portion of year only.
The period under review was not favorable for
inter-State shipping; trade depression, high
costs and competition from overseas freight-
ers curtailed profit-earning. The chairman
gave shareholders some interesting facts con-
cerning the competition by British and other
cos. The overseas steamers formerly dis-
charged at principal ports only, leaving the
job of transhipping cargoes to other centres
to the local concerns. Nowadays, however,
many of the overseas steamers have added to
their ports of call, delivering iron and steel,
salt, cement, etc., at a cost which, after pay-
ment of duty, gives the foreigner an advan-
tage over local industry. The working ex-
penses of a 5000-ton British steamer trading
to iS’America were recently officially estimated
at not more than £9OO per month ; this Adel-
aide co. confides that to run a vessel of
similar tonnage on the Australian coast costs
£2OOO per month. But despite all recent
troubles this co. discloses a net profit for the
past year which provides the usual 74
p.c. div., and as that gives p.c. on capi-
tal as it stood prior to the 1920 reconstruc-
tion—shareholders received three fully-paids
for every one held previously—proprietors
continue to be fattened. The profit shown
in the introductory table is £25,000 more
than was claimed by the directors: that
amount was dropped into an insurance fund,
and, judging by reconstruction happenings—
the whole of the insurance accumulations
were then capitalised—it can reasonably be
regarded as genuine profit. The management
provides for depreciation on the quiet, and
the allowances for any year are not ascer-
tainable. In the past, depreciation provi-
sions were far in excess of actual require-
ments. and in the reconstruction the book
value of the fleet was written up by almost
a million. No. satisfactory statement of
actual net earnings can be given without
knowledge of the depreciation requirements
and allowances made. Possibly not so much
was laid aside during the past 12 months as
in other years. The £199.485 profit which
is discoverable for the adverse year hints
that in previous terms the co. must have
been doing magnificently. Still, there is some
doubt whether sales of assets did not influ-
ence earnings. The 1051-ton Oorama and
a tug were purchased during the year; but
the Nardoo (2940 tons) was sold. Whether
the latter showed a surplus over its written-
up book value is not disclosed. Also, a new
property was acquired for Brisbane head-
quarters, and an old freehold there was sold.
The Adelaide S.S. accounts are nowadays
presented in a way that hinders a satis-
factory investigation of the co.’s position. In
the war years sales of steamers at boom
prices gave the co. cash far exceeding the
figures at which they stood in the
books. The management decided to hide the
extent of the cash it subsequently invested in
public securities, and parcels of Government
lOU’s and shares in other cos. of unknown
dimensions are nowadays included with
steamers, hulks, lighters, plant, properties,
wharves and other fixed assets. At June 30
no less than £2,259,841 of the paid capital
of £2,325,135 was represented by that mix-
ture. The accounts also show £235,420 in
War Loans. £100.871 in coal stocks, stores,
etc., and £273,272 of book debts and cash.

Prior to 1915 the co. had been adding to
its fleet, and was leaning on outsiders for
the necessary cash. But the sale of steamers
at boom prices and subsequent happenings
have given the co. a surplus of liquid assets,
not including those grouped with fixed assets,
totalling £416,684, in place of an excess of
liabilities of £209,354 seven years ago.

Some big changes have taken place during
the period covered by that table. Seven
years ago, when a tire had damaged the
upper floors, contractors were called in to
add a couple of storeys and to modernise
other sections. During the past year further
extensive additions and alterations have been
in progress, the hotel having been enlarged
by erecting a modern building at the rear
of the old property. In 1913 the hotel stood
in the books at £147,365, and furniture and
machinery at £20,000; at June 30 last the
property account had grown to £357,754, and
furniture and machinery to £56,023. The
co. was also committed to the payment of
£25,000 more on work in hand at the bal-
ance. The extensions have, of course, re-
quired the assistance of a lot of new capi-
tal : in 1913 there were 6 p.c. prefs. for
£33,000 and £75,000 of ordinaries; no addi-
tional prefs. have been issued, but ordinary
capital has grown to £251,728, some of
which, as entries in the table show, is profit
transferred.
Last year’s building operations naturally
disturbed business, and all-round depression
must also have affected earnings. Neverthe-
less, several revenue-earning extensions were
made available for the Easter rush,
and the co. earned sufficient to pay
10 p.c. on the larger ordinary capital.
That was a very creditable performance.
“Even with the added accommodation,” says
the directors’ report, “the hotel was none
too large for its patrons, and the season was
a highly successful one.” They add that,
as a result of the extensions and improve-
ments, the Australia “continues to stand
alone” among the hotels of the Common-
wealth in “accommodation, appointments and
cuisine.” A few years ago investors would
not have thought it possible that the Hotel
Australia could have expanded in a way
to profitably employ nearly a third of
a million of its own funds. Since then
Usher’s, the Carlton and Hotel Sydney have
been established, and the Wentworth ex-
tended ; but the boom created by the war and
the development of the well-equipped hotel
as an adjunct to social life have given good
profits on all the cash put into new hotels
and extensions of old ones.
The £246,412 net additions to the Hotel
Australia and its equipment since 1913 have
not been wholly provided by shareholders.
At June 30 liabilities totalled £120.997,
compared with £36,782 last year and £32,151
in 1913. This shows balance-sheet move-
ments over the nine years, and compares the

Toohey’s Standard Brewery celebrated the
arrival of Pussyfoot Johnson with profits
considerably larger than for any other year
and by seeking shareholders’ approval of an
increase of nominal capital by £200,000. All
except £1639 of the present authorised capi-
tal of £600,000 had been got in at July 31,
£74,242 having been called in during the
past 12 months. The growth of capital must,
of course, be considered along with the im-
provement of profits. On the other hand,
the co. now admits earning considerably
more- on its funds than a few years ago.
Variations in the returns on combined capi-
tal and reserves, after allowing for depreci-
ation of plant and machinery, are shown
hereunder:—-
Average Net Written Profit p.c.
Funds. Profit. Off. of Funds
1915.. £547,041 £60,206 £lO,OOO 11.0
1917.. 574,822 36,909 10,000 6.4

1922.. 800,851 82,856 15,000 10.3
Higher costs of manufacturing, dislocation
of the Trade by the war and Government
restrictions were, no doubt, partly respon-
sible for the falling-off of profits a few
years ago; but not unlikely the threats of
prohibition also influenced the amounts dis-
closed by managements. There is not the
slightest doubt that during the years when
the Cold Tea party was raising its voice
brewery directors were putting a bit extra
aside for contingencies. Nevertheless, div.
rates did not suffer: Toohey’s 8 p.c., first
paid in 1914, was maintained until 1920,
when the payment of 9 p.c. began and has
since continued. Meantime, £160,000 or so
has been added to visible reserves. Latest
disclosed profits gave nearly 14 p.c. on paid
capital, so a substantial addition has been
made to reserves after paying 9 p.c. The
co. may have done even better than the
accounts admit: profits in the introductory
table do not include £15,000 set aside for de-
preciation of plant and machinery, but the
directors announce that those assets “have
been maintained in a high, state of efficiency,
and all expenditure in connection therewith
has been defrayed out of current revenue as
heretofore.” Consequently there is some
doubt whether the £15,000 provision was
necessary. Incidentally, the past year’s pro-
fits were assisted to some extent by the
lower cost of raw materials.
Toohey’s had no doubts as to the out-
come of the no-license agitation. Net addi-
tions totalling £302,313 have been made to
brewery, machinery, plant and freehold and
leasehold properties during the past seven
years, and that amount was £9237 in excess
of the new capital and reserves put into the
business between the balancing dates. This
comparison gives further details:—

Cash and public
securities .. 3,562 22,775 28,864 16,496
The outlay on fixed assets has been so large
that, notwithstanding all the new capital got
in, liabilities are now heavier than at any
other time. And though fewer funds are
now tied up in stocks, an expanded trade
and new hotel interests have added consider-
ably to book debts. The surplus of more or
less liquid assets in July, 1915, was £185,905,
and at the latest balance £193,413, an in-
crease of only £7508. A feature of Toohey’s
is the size of reserves in relation to capital.
After payment of the final div. there were
net liquid assets equal to 4s. 6d. per 16s.
share and 18s. Bd. more in brewery and
hotel assets.

For seven years, through boom and slump,

performance is better than that bald state-
ment suggests, because the 10 p.c. is nowa-
days declared on a paid capital which, within
the past three years, was increased from
£56,644 to £79,300 by the issue of new
shares at par. Some of the additional capi-
tal was required to enable the management
to hold adequate stocks when prices were
high, but values having receded, £7600 less
is tied up in that asset than was the case two
years ago. Most of the new funds have been
utilised in erecting and equipping a new fac-
tory and in adding a couple of storeys to the
city freehold premises. Two years ago free-
holds and plant stood in the balance-sheet
at £23,771, but now no less than £69,172 is
in fixed assets. Consequently liabilities
have increased from £10,240 to £36,316 dur-
ing the same period. The co.’s position is
still comfortable enough, though: at the
latest balance the surplus of stocks, book
debts and other liquid assets over and above
all outside liabilities amounted to £29,048,
equal to 6s. sd. per £1 fully-paid after the
half-year’s div. had been extracted. There
was a further 17s. sd. per share in the book
value of properties, plant, etc., giving a
total of 235. lOd. of assets to support every
share.

June 30 closed Geo. Farmer’s third year as a
public co. For hnlf-a-century the business
had been a proprietary, but in 1920 the pub-
lic paid £87,000 cash and 33,000 fully-paid
£1 ordinaries for it, the public taking up
£60,000 of 8 p.c. cum. prefs. and £27,000 of
ordinaries. The co. has done very well:
disclosed profits have been a couple of
thousands better than was shown by the
books of the old concern. So, though £27,500
of capital is represented by goodwill, the
ordinaries received 10 p.c. for the first two
years and 15 p.c. for the past year. The
co. did better during the past 12 months than
claimed by the directors: they give £18,044
as the net profit after providing for deprecia-
tion and taxation, but the accounts show
£2500 to have been written off goodwill, and
that amount was apparently also portion of
the year’s earnings. The balance-sheet also
tells in another way that the co. has had a
very good run. Deducting the final div.
from cash in hand at June 30, 1921, there
was a bank credit of £8484. At the latest
balance £31,023 was on hand —£14,145 of it
fixed deposit—after having paid £5400 in-
terim divs. This collection of balance-sheet
figures assists further comparisons:—

At June 30 stocks, book debts and cash
showed a surplus over and above lia-
bilities of £82,976, compared with
£67,559 a year previously. Taking divs.
into account, the period’s operations con-
tributed £26,217 to the liquid surplus. Dur-
ing the three years to June 30 the co. had
written off £2500 from goodwill, £11,224 of
preliminary expenses and vendors’ considera-
tion, and had added about £22,000 to .net
tangible assets. After payment of the year’s
handsome divs. the co. had been strengthened
by about £16,750 since the commencement.
The public has thus had no reason to regret
having taken over the old concern. The
former proprietors are, of course, still inter-
ested—in the float they took 33,000 of the
60,000 ordinaries. After payment of the
latest divs. there were net tangible assets
with a book value of £102,819 to protect
£60,000 of 8 p.c. pref. capdtal. Allowing
cover for the prefs., the accounts showed
tangible assets of 14s. 3d. to represent each
£1 ordihary share.

For the past two years this old building
society has paid 10 p.c. on capital its writ-
ten down in a reconstruction in 1910. But
there is visibly only a small margin of sur-
plus profit after making the distributions,
so a. continuance of that rate of div. is not
assured by any means. Disregarding the
profits from sale of old foreclosure*? —inci-
dentally, the book value of vacant land in
possession is now down to £424 —divs. for
1921 and last year took all except £137 and
£260 of the net earnings from current
business. Consequently, only a slight dis-
turbance of the present balance between in-
terest and other earnings and expenses
would reduce profits below ID p.c. div. re-
quirements. Last year interest on loans was
slightly less than for 1921, and exes, were a
little heavier; but compensation was provided
by a small reduction in the amount paid on
borrowed funds, and by the, increase in net
rents from £3587 to £3778. The co. is nowa-
days very comfortable. *Paid capital of
£96,605 is assisted by reserves totalling

Beaudesert < Q.) got excited last week
over a statement circulated iu the town that
Dr. Milsom, the American geologist, had
examined samples from Dunn’s bore, and
pronounced them of crude origin. It was
then and there decided to bore, and the locals
are putting up the cash, and preliminary
steps have already been taken. It was also
stated that Dr. Milsom, accompanied by a
Queensland geologist, would visit the district
at an eaidy date. Geologist ,1. 11. Reid has
been in the district for the past fortnight
unearthing anti-clines, and, in particular,
making an examination of the Overflow area,
where Edgar Joyce has applied for an oil-
prospecting area. Two samples from a well
on E. Kittle’s property were sent to the
Government Analyst. One showed mineral
off : in the other it was absent. The owner
has since applied for a prospecting area
covering these wells.
“W’gabba”: Let me supplement “Talpa’s”
remarks (B. 14/9/’22) regarding oil-explora-
tion areas in Westralia and elsewhere. The
practice in the U.S.A. in wild-cat country
—the term is nqt used in an opprobrious
sense, but to indicate unproved areas, where
oil has not been found, and where evidence
may be very favorable —is to allow 1000 sq.
miles to prospecting cos. for a limited period
for roconnaisance work only. This generally
includes a rough geological and topographi-
cal examination, and before the period ex-
pires it must he decided, ou the data secured,
what area is then wanted for trial boring.
The prospector is then allowed a second
title over 640 acres, and the residue reverts
to the Government and is available for other
applicants. Then the detailed work begins
on the 640 acres with a geological survey,
from which structural contour maps are
prepared. The bores are all under Govern-
ment regulation, and supervision is very
strict. Logs of bores have to he submitted
monthly to inspectors, and if they turn out
duds the records are available for future
generations, and may prevent much waste of
cash. If successful the data is at hand to
guide work in the area around.
Freney’s directors deny that any import-
ant development has occurred on their oil
areas in the Nor’-West. Boring at Alt.
Wynne is proceeding in very hard ground,
and a drill is also at work at Price’s Greek,
where the ground is more favorable. Boring-
superintendent Kessal, of the Okes-Durack
co., states that boring at a point 100 miles
inland from Wyndliam should commence in
November.
The Mines Department of the Federated
Malay States recently issued an interesting
circular on the tin-mining industry of that
country, and on market prospects. It states:
Ah the major portion of the rich alluvial flats iti
the F.M.S. has already been worked, successful mining
becomes more and more a matter of fine adjustment
of costs and cheap power, the controlling factor
being the p.riee of tin. When the world has re-
sumed its normal powers of consumption one may
expect to find the price of tin gradually rising,
owing to increased consumption and decreased output.
With the possible exception of China, which is popu-
larly credited with vast stores of most of the valuable
minerals, no new tin-fields are known or even sus-
pected, and I think it will be found that tin will
eventually reach that price at which it will pay
consumers to use a substitute.
This official opinion must be reassuring to
Australian tin-miners, who have been hard
hit by the slump in value of tin and advanced
working costs which have prevailed for over
two years.
There are indications that Westralia’s
gold output will not decline much rnoi’e
for some time. Ivanhoe, Golden Horse-
shoe and South Kalgurli have all
developed considerable additional payable
tonnages in their bottom levels. They are
all satisfactory bodies as regards width,
height, length and value. Great Boulder
appears to have about only thi'ee years’ ore
in sight, but even it has prospects of addi-
tional ore reserves. Tributors are winning
thousands of ounces monthly from areas
leased to them by Kalgoorlie mining cos.,
and they are now casting longing eyes on
other shows now locked up. During the
winter months vigorous prospecting has re-
sulted in new finds of promise in outlying
districts, so there are reasonable expectations
of improved gold yields next year.
Westralian Inspector of Alines Wilson
gives Ives’ Reward a good chance. Regard-
ing the 120 ft. level, where developments have
been regarded as doubtful, he says: "Values
are low at No. 4 shaft, and, apparently,
values in the north drive are somewhat
irregular; but, according to Mr. Ives, gave
an average for the 50ft. driven of 9£dwL,
while the present face is worth 30dwt. per
ton. The south drive went out of values at
a distance of 20. t., and, as this is apparently
due to a disturbance, it is important to con-
tinue this drive to see if payable values can
be again picked up.” He concludes that the
mine is well worth further development:
“on accouut of the great width over which
values are obtained, a large tonnage of ore
may be developed for a relatively small
amount of development work.”
* * * *
Celebration, White Hope and St. Ives dis-
tricts, like most Westralian mining centres
outside the service of the Goldfields Water
Supply, are afflicted by a shortage of water.
The Government has been requested to con-
nect the three places with the Kalgoorlie
main, but as the cost of the necessary pipe-
line is estimated at £lOO,OOO the chances of
its being laid are remote.

Bendigo Amalgamated holds a meeting
to-morrow to consider the proposal to form
six new cos.—Carlisle, Constellation, Her-
oules, Koch’s Pioneer, Monument and Nel-
son. Each co. is to have a capital of £30,000
in 60,000 shares. The B.A.G. will receive
10.000 fully-paids in each co. and 48,000
contribs. will be allotted free to sharehold-
ers, or eight shares for 300 in the 8.A.G.,
equal to 48 for the six cos. All told, B.A.G.
will get 348,000 shares —60,000 paids and
288,000 contribs. The latter “will be sub-
ject to calls, but without any personal lia-
bility whatever —shareholders may, if they
choose, decline to pay calls.” The weakness
of this is that there is no surety that any
capital will be subscribed. The curious
anomaly may arise that cos. may be regis-
tered and all .the shares may be forfeited for
non-payment of the first call, whereupon
the cos. would, ipso facto, cease to exist.
The Crown leases—but not the plant, etc.—
are to be disposed of to the new cos., but
the circular does not specify what will be-
come of them in case the anomalous posi-
tion referred to should ai-ise. The new cos.
are to have the use of plant at a rental equal
to 7 p.c. of its value, but “this arrangement
may be terminable on three months’ notice
on either side.” This provision will put
the subsidiary cos. entirely at the mercy of
the parent co. On the two points mentioned
the scheme seems to be quite impracticable.
Aix impartial critic might have some justi-
fication for assuming that the project is
tantamount to “riding for a fall” ; that it
does not . represent the .financial acumen with
which the sponsor of it is credited; that, if
serious business were intended, a simple and
effective plan would be to increase the capi-
tal of the present co. Obviously, if there
be prospective justification for the forma-
tion of six cos., there ought to be a strong
incentive for the B.A.G. to retain posses-
sion of the properties.
The latest Bendigo float is the New Bird’s
Reef, which has been formed to work the
reef of that name at Kangaroo Flat. This
reef was a consistent producer in the early
days. It was worked for a length of about
half-a-mile to a depth of about 200 ft., and in
one shaft only was anything done at or below
300 ft. About nine years ago a Melbourne
co. sank the principal shaft to 500 ft., and
several good erushings were taken from a
large body of spurs at 400 ft. At 500 ft. an
entire change of country was revealed. A
bed of slate 40ft. wide, which did not show
in the level above, was passed through.
Spurs in this bed yielded from 4dwt. to
14dwt, per ton; but they were not di'iven
on. The most important development at
this level was that it intersected the apex
of an anti-cline, the first defined formation
of this kind seen in the mine. Such lode
material as there was in this strata was of
fairly good quality. On developments the
co. was really at a stage w r here, in a sense,
it ought to have been starting work instead
of stopping it. Bendigo practical men re-
gard the prospect as most promising, and
the bulk of the shares which have been taken
up locally have been applied for by mine-
managers. A large parcel has been under-
written for Sydney. The co. consists of
50,000 shares, of which 6000 are paid up
to 55., and the balance being issued at Is.
“Bendigonian”: This field sustained an
inestimable loss by the tragic, untimely death
of Victor Pabst over two years ago. He
was a native of Bendigo, and from a humble
start worked himself up to the impoi’tant
position of geological surveyor to the Ben-
digo Amalgamated. His compi’ehensive tech-
nical description of the mines owned by the
co. (contained in a book of 236 pages) will
be an undying memoi’ial to his industry, care
and insight that seems almost uncanny. His
survey of the Constellation mine, as re-
corded, indicated almost within a foot the
location of the bonanza from which the co.
won such a large quantity of gold. But his
most remarkable recommendation was in
connection with the new Blue Consolidated
mine, on which he prepared a report not
long befoi'e his death. . It is something more
than prophetic; it pictured almost to the
minutest detail that which has become an
actual reality. The report reads like a
description of the present productive work-
ings which were outlined as the “first in
importance” to be undertaken bv the recon-
structed co. lie also predicted important
developments at the 1700 ft. level—work at
which is now in progress. As to the shaft, he
states that it was 2430 ft. deep, the last
600 ft. proving unproductive of reefs. “This
is considerably above the average of sinking
without the existence of saddle reefs on the
Bendigo field. As payable saddle formations
have been found to a depth of over 4000 ft.
on the parallel New Chum line to due west-
ward, it is practically certain that early
developments of an important character
would quickly follow on the resumption of
shaft-sinking with the contemporary sinking
of a centre winze from the bottom crosscut.”
There’s a straight tip for the co. to fol-
low. These conspicuous successes ought to
end the old controversy as to the relative
importance of the trained geologist and the
practical pickologist.
United Gleeson’s, Gaffney’s Creek ( Vic.),
looks like another old-timer that is to have a
new lease of life. A tunnel has been driven
2Uoft. below old workings. Manager Nicol
is to be credited with having accurately fore-
casted events. Several months ago lie re-
ported that the new tunnel would have to
lie driven 900 ft. to intersect a shoot of gold
which had been followed from the surface to
the tunnel above. The reef was struck with-
in a foot or so of the point indicated, it is
2ft. wide and the last report stated that it
was showing gold freely. Shares trebled in
value within a wee' - .
* * * *
Cohen’s Reef, VValhalla, in 60 years pro-
duced over £6,000,000 of gold, chiefly from
two famous mines, the Long Tunnel and
Long Tunnel Extended. These cos. opened
tunnels at the creek level and delved down
below the adit to 3000 ft. without working the
backs up to the surface. Last year a pros-
pector, ,r. G. Whittles, tested the surface
above the Long Tunnel Co.’s ground for
Cohen’s Reef. He traced the outcrop for
two miles, and got specimens of the same
laminated quartz which carried the gold in
the great mines underneath. Whittles did
not apply for his well-earned leases till after
some local people pegged out his southern
ground and opened two adits. The North
Overseas Co. has been working with good
prospects on the westerly underlie of the
Cohen’s Reef near the surface. Whittles
still has 375 acres left running due north
from the North Overseas, and the outcrop of
the Cohen’s Reef lias been proved by loam-
ing and costei.iirg as far as Fear Not Gully.
Why the old reh cos. did not do a bit of sur-
face prospecting, instead of costly shaft-
sinking, is a mystery.
* «■ #■ *
Finney’s Hill United, the principal show
amongst the Indooroopilly (Q.) silver-lead
mines, is carrying on exploratory work in
the lower levels. From the mainshaft at
224 ft. crosscutting has been completed for
69ft., and there is an encouraging showing
of galena in brecciated schist. Another drive
has been started at 324 ft. vertical, but has
been in schist only for 15ft. Finney’s Hill
Block, a newer co. which has yet to make
good, is trying out the eastern end of the
area. It is sinking vertically, and a depth
of 58ft. has been reached. The country has
become brecciated, and is showing a little
galena, so prospects are improved thereby.
This co. hopes to strike a make of ore from
the United inside of 300 ft., and yyill sink to
that depth before opening out. The pros-
pecting work in and around Indooroopilly
seems fully justified if Edgar Hall, of Silver-
spur, knows anything about silver-lead. He
considered that the ore find there was about
the most important mining discovery made
in the northern State for many years, and
that there was every indication of perma-
nency.
Mining in Australia has suffered from the
poet’s double curse: “Gold, a curse to have
thee : a curse to be without thee !” In many
cases a superfluity of cash at the outset has
led to wilful extravagance and undeserved
failure, and in other cases shortness of cash
has retarded legitimate development. The
Tyrconnel (N.Q.) appears to be a mine
which comes under the latter category. The
latest directors’ report states that “if suffi-
cient capital had been provided in the early
stages for the proper development and equip-
ment of the mine the co. would have been
paying dividends for some years.” Those
wlio know the history of the co. will sup-
port this statement. Timidity of outlook
has led to restricted working with tinpot
appliances, and good managers have retired
in disgust. Recently, however, the mine
itself has beaten the go-slow policy of its
shareholders. Last year 5383 tons ore were
treated for 47150 z. gold, which realised
£34.033, with £3185 as premium and £3042
from concentrates. There was a net profit
of £3299, or slightly less than one-sixth of
the product, which shows high cost of work-
ing. Two divs. of 3d. each have been paid
during the current year, and the directors
anticipate an early resumption of profit dis-
bursements. There are 140,00 U shares in
the co.
The scheme for open-cutting Blair Athol
(Q.) coal is now well under wav on the
B. A. Timber and Coal Co.’s lease. The
machinery is all in position, and excavation
has started. From 40ft. to 60ft of over-
burden has to be removed, and about 50 men
are on the job. No announcement has been
made as to the intention of the Newcastle
Co. to follow suit since the preliminary
statement a couple of months ago, but as the
B. A. Coal Co. will reduce the cost of pro-
duction at the pithead from 15s. to probably
ss. by open-cut methods, it will have to get
out or follow that system. The Bluff, the co-
operative colliery, which is run by tributors
and has generally picked up its share of tin*
local trade, will probably close down or be
absorbed.
“J.R.K.”: There is still a speck or two
of tin left in the old shows around Iler-
berton (N.Q.). Eaton’s New Bradlaugh is
the outstanding show in the district: a 7ft
face bulking 40 p.c. tin concentrates is
reminiscent of the old days. Day Bros, have
just cleaned up 140 tons stone for 34 tons
concentrates from the old Boundary claim.
The “Wild Irishman” party are at present
hammering away on 350 tons estimated to
go 3;> p.c. In spite of the poor price for the
metal, numerous applications are in to resur-
rect some of the has-beens.
Since Langford introduced Briseis to Lon-
don, only on three occasions has that old
Speck tin-mine shown a loss. The first was
at the outset, when Fraser’s Ringarooma
water-supply scheme was not completed.
Next, in 1014, when the war shut the claim
down. Finally, last year’s loss of £19,000-
odd due to the stoppage of sluicing while
Lindesa.v Clark was completing the river
diversion. Despite all the puff at the float,
Briseis has been a very big mine. Profits
have run to £750.000, and just on £600.000
has gone to shareholders. Subscribed capital
has been returned, and as there was a
lot of water in the float the mine has stood
up to its burden. Clark is now working
on a block of 800,000 c. yd. of drift over
which the river has been running, and from
which he expects to rake up 600 tons oxide.
Later, lie will tackle 5,000,000 c. yd. of
stripped ground on the far bank of.the Ringa-
rooma. His estimate for this patch is 3213
tons oxide.

ALEX. HEAN, Hon. Minister in the
Tasmanian Ministry.
William J. Sowden, who resigns his posi-
tion as editor of Adelaide’s Register at the
end of September, gained his earliest know-
ledge of newspaper work as a type-snatcher.
Robert Burns, probable successor to S’Wil-
liam, once studied Caxton’s craft in Edin-
burgh. In the same office, F. S. Wallis.
ex-M.1..C., until recently a familiar figure
m the Cultured City’s political swirl, is
again reading proofs for a living.
Brig.-Gen. T. H. Courtney, for whom the
Last Post sounded the other dav, though too
ancient for active scrapping when the Hun
broke loose (he died at 63), did useful work
round the camps in Australia’and on troop-
ships. A brother. Col. Dick Courtney, com-
mauded the 14th Batt., and his name is im-
mortalised at Courtney’s Post on the Penin-
sula. He was afterwards commandant in
M estralia, and died a year or two ago. An-
other brother, Lieut.-Col. Charles Courtney,
although a mpdical man, commanded a Light
Horse regiment in Palestine. He is now
P.M.O. at Repat.; and still another, J.H.,
is a colonel on the retired list.
Edgar J. McCloughry, D. 5.0..
D.F.C. (B. 7/9/’22) has written to his
parents in North Adelaide confirming the
cable that he, together with Mclntosh and
Tymms, intends to have a shot at a round-
the-world flight. The youngster asks them
not to worry about him, and cheerfully re-
marks that “the enterprise will not be so
dangerous as flying in the war.”
Capt. Philip Charley, of Belmont Park,
J• (N.S.W.), who is just entering
lus 60tli year, was born at Ballarat, and
began life in a lawyer’s office in Melbourne,
but, his health not being good, he went
on a station on the Barrier Ranges
(N.S.W.) to gain
experience. Broken
Hill was discovered
while he was there,
and he was one of
the original seven
of the Proprietary
Co., but sold half
his interest to help
him retain the
other, as the ex-
penses were heavy.
Later, he went in
for ca ttle-breed in g
and pedigree stock,
with success, and
invested largely in
Sydney city pro-
perty.
FRANK TATE,
Victorian Director
of Education, who
is tipped for a
knighthood.
A knighthood for Frank Tate, Director
of Education, may mark the jubilee of free,
secular and compulsory education in Vic.
Tate, who is already a C.M.G. and 1.5.0.,
is the doyen of his State’s permanent heads,
and every hilltop and valley in Vic. bears
evidence of his 20 years’ work. The yarn
goes that both Federal and State recom-
mendations have been forwarded to George
V. on his behalf. The shoulder-tapping act
may happen when F.T. turns up in London
in May to attend the Empire Education
Conference.
About a G.O.M.: —
William Benjamin Rounsevell, of S. Aus., who is
80 on the 23rd, was four times Treasurer of the
wheat State. In the early eighties of last century
he “fathered” the Land and Income Tax Bill through
the S.A. Parliament, and inaugurated the taxation
system which obtains in its main principles to this
day and was afterwards copied by. the Ma State.
There were three Benjamins of the North Terrace
Assembly flock when Rounsevell was enjoying his
palmy days; “W. 8.,” the giant of the trio and the
most distinguished of them, was known as “Big Ben.”
Nearly half-a-century ago, at the age of 33, Ben
Rounsevell was elected to Parliament for the Burra,
which he represented off and on for about 23 years,
ltounsevell’s father, William, a Cornishman from Bos-
castle, ran coaches in the early days, and Ben and
his brother John, long since dead, had a big hand
in the business. Later Ben stocked Corrvton
Park station, ran racehorses, and bred some of the
best greyhounds in Australia. Remarkably active
for his age, he has been for many years chairman of
directors of a big business house in the city.
“The Printer”: Henry Lawson’s death
reminds me of the day his first MS. was
received by the late J. F. Archibald, then
editor of The Bulletin. Whatever dignity
attaches to the position was sacrificed by-
Archibald on that occasion. The “Song of
the Republic” so fired Archibald that he
dashed up to the composing-room and sub-
mitted it for criticism to the present writer.
Lawson, even in those far-off days, was so
hyper-sensitive that it was only with extreme
difficulty he could be got to visit the
office. He made up for that in later years,
however. As evidencing J.F.A.’s enthusiasm
over his literary find the following editorial
introduction to Lawson’s second poem (pub-
lished in The Bulletin, Dec. 24, 1887), is
interesting:—
In publishing the subjoined verses (The Wreck
of the Derry Castle) we take pleasure in stating that
the writer thereof is a boy of 17 years, a young Aus-
tralian, who has as yet had an imperfect education,
and is earning his living under some difficulties as
a house-pa inter—a youth whose poetic genius here
speaks eloquently for itself.— Ed. B.
James Robinson, whom Fuller made an
M.L.C., a while back, and who died sud-
denly last Sunday, arrived in N.S.W. at
26, from County Tyrone 36 years ago. He
occupied every important L.O.L. niche in
the meantime, was managing director of
The Watchman, a Freemason, and at
times helped by sermons from the pulpit to
keep Scotchbyterians on the right track.
Albion Tolley, wine and spirit merchant,
of Adelaide, lately dead, left something like
£150,000 to his family.
By the death of Thomas Francis Moore
Melb. Museum loses a man who did much
to place its collection upon its present well-
organised foundation. For a couple of de-
cades he had charge of the articulating and
mounting of skeletons and other osteologi-
cal exhibits, among these being the remains
of Carbine. One of his biggest jobs was the
fixing up of a skeleton after the elephant
that originally owned the framework had lost
all further interest in it at the Zoo. In his
spare time Moore did much useful work in
comparative osteology of Australian fauna.
He died in harness, collapsing in a tram on
his way home after a day’s work.
It seems dangerous for a pressman to* go
out of harness too suddenly. Robert Rusk
retired from the Adelaide Register last
February after 53 years in the news-room.
Now he is dead, at only 71.
“P.”: Reuter’s Smyrna correspondent,
who got out of the burning city by the skin
of his teeth and a hospital ship to Makta,
is Guy Beringer, only son of the late Oscar
Beringer, Director for umpteen years of the
London Academy of Music, in the Maryle-
bone-road. For some years he lived by
Swiss mountain accidents, during the sum-
mer months, being Reuter’s correspon-
dent in Geneva, from which centre
he cabled home the suicides and slips
on the glaciers. During the winter months
he did odd jobs in Old Jewry. There seemed
to be no prospects of advancement, so he
decided to migrate to South America. He
had arrived-at Marseilles to board the
steamer when he received a telegram offer-
ing him the Petrograd agency. That was
the beginning of 15 years on the Neva. He
speaks French and English with equal accu-
racy. He never acquired fluent Russian.
His secretary would read him the Russian
press leaders in French, and he would tran-
scribe simultaneously in English shorthand.
When the Bolshevist regime came in he fled
to Finland, where he remained during the
German occupation. His sisters are Esme
and Vera Beringer, well known on the Lon-
don stage, whilst his mother is a composer
of meHt.
“M.D.” A link with Sydney’s medical past,
when consultants were few and occupied
rooms in College and Liverpool streets, with
a predilection for Lyons-terrace, was sev-
ered by the recent passing of George Hurst,
M.D., aged 70 (London). He was honorary
physician to Sydney Hospital in the infant
’nineties, and would have been one of the
city’s most successful consultants, only its
climate was anathema to him —he was
a martyr to asthma. He sought relief for
his neurosis at Bathurst, and died at Black-
heatli.
“Stellsby”: Let this end all further argu-
ments, for it is dinkum. Horatio William
Bottomley was born on March 23. 1860, at
16 St. Peter-street. Bethnal Green, London E.
His father was William King Bottomley, a
tailor’s foreman, and his mother was formerly
Miss Elizabeth Holyoake, a niece of George
Jacob.
Robert Welchman, killed by a falling tree
at Lilydale (Vic.) the other day, was for-
merly a lecturer at Melb. ’Varsity. He went
up from Scotch College while in his teens,
and after a brilliant course in Arts bagged
a degree with honors in history, political
economy, logic and classics, subsequently get-
ting a classical lecturership in Ormond, a
job which he combined with an English
mastership at one of the public schools.
Welchman had a rare gift as an essayist, but
as he preferred to circulate privately what
he wrote, only those who knew him were
aware of it.
J. W. Satchwell, whom the Brighton
(Vic.) bumbles have elected their Mayor, is
an ex-John Hop, having retired from the
fo-orce years ago with the rank of inspector.
He is one of the Jack Blunts, and his first
act on reaching the chair was to send the
rabbit-skins back to their camphor-reeking
box. “Satchy” is credited with having, as
prosecuting officer of a suburban council,
summoned himself for having found his cow
wandering about the streets. And when a
young mounted man up-country, he bagged
half-a-dozen hefty sleeper-cutters who had
been terrorising the district, and brought the
lot in, shackled together, on his own.
“Chris” on one of M.L.’s earliest colonists:
Alex. Grey, of Aberdeen, reached the Rickety Isles
in 1826. The sight of tattooed savages doing their
fearsome war-haka and the horrible Stories told of
the ferocious ways of the warriors, caused the young
Scotsman’s friends to fade away, but he hung on.
In 1830 he married Kotero Hinetangi, of the Ngate-
ruanui (Taranaki) tribe. She was just back from
Sydney, where that enthusiastic Maori missionary,
the Rev. Sam Marsden, had taught her pakeiia
wajs. Sophia, the late celebrated Rotorua guide,
vas a Grey girl. The youngest of the daughters,
Jane, born 1836, has just passed out. She and her
deceased husband, G. W. S. Phillips, did fine pioneer
work as native school teachers. In the Taranaki
province, however, Te Whiti, of Parihaka fame, with
his anti-British notions, nullified their efforts.
OSCAR
ASCHE.
Another old Bulletin man followed his
friend Henry Lawson to the grave last week
—Alex. Montgomery (“Montalex,” “Sar-
donyx,” etc.). He was born in London-
derry, in 1847, and came from a mixed
parentage that combined Irish, Scotch,
French and Spanish blood, lie was edu-
cated for the British Diplomatic Service,
but felt the call of a wanderer’s life, and
took to the sea. He struck Melbourne in the
early ’seventies did a bit of writing there,
and then drifted away again to the
Malay Archipelago, Java and elsewhere. He
hit Sydney in ’B4 and worked for the Even-
ing News and Echo. Then he began to
write for The Bulletin, and eventually
joined the staff. He wrote many colorful
stories about life in the Straits, and pub-
lished two books on the subject. He was also
an authority on aboriginal lore and zoology.
“Tally Ho”: Edward Henry Butler, senior
partner of the Hobart firm, Butler, Mcln-
tyre and Butler, has just rounded off a half-
century at the Tas. Bar. He served his
articles with his father, the late Charles
Butler, formerly of the same firm, and in
his younger days was for a while with Nutt
and Blake, now Blake and Riggall. of Mel-
bourne. Law runs in the Butler blood, and
three generations of Charles Butlers have
chased Costs for the old Hobart firm which
was founded in the early ’thirties.
William Gray, who died at Maylands (S.
Aus.) at 91 the other day, had been in that
State since 1851. His first job there was
that of head gardener for Justice Gwynne
of Glynde. Later he started a gardening
business, which he ran for 64 years. In
’53 he married Charlotte Layers, a great-
grand niece of the late Lord Ashton, of
Ashton Hall, Lancaster. She died 11 years
ago. There are 200 direct descendants of
the union, including four great-great-grand-
children.
“Morehead”: Sydney Domain was, four
years ago, a lions’den of windy socialists; and
then Aliek Dudley Kay arrived and dared to
be a horse-sense Daniel. His audiences now
outnumber those of any other Sabbath orator,
and his Wednesday mid-day addresses on
individual effort in Martin-place are listened
to by thousands. Born in Sydney 35 years
ago, and a public-school boy with useful war
service to his credit, he contested the hope-
less South Sydney seat for the Nationalists
in the 1917 Federal elections. Under the
redistribution scheme, a large slice of the
hottest industrial centres has now been
lopped off South Sydney and Conservative
Randwick tacked on, and as Kay is a vigor-
ous speaker, used to handling hostile list-
eners, level-headed and young, he might, if
given another chance, wrest the seat from
Labor and put bluff old Edward Riley out
of work.
“Gallery”: .Tim Sharpe, formerly Labor
M.H.R. for Oxley (Q.), is to make a third
try to wrest the seat from James Garfield
Bayley, whose only claim to recognition in
his constituency is that he represents the
brand of politics favored by the majority.
Sharpe, a saturnine-looking character with
a taste for bright company, was once a
bookie and owned the Albion Park race-
course, Brisbane, which he sold to John
Wren. Afterwards he bought a big interest
in the Brisbane Daily Mail, which, true
to its T ffinra l principles, opposed him when
he stood for Parliament.
FIRST OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Laurence Ginnell, who created many scenes in
the House of Commons as M.P. for Westmeath, was
the first discordant element to appear in the Dail
Eireann. He refused to sign the roll, defied the
Speaker, and was ejected, resisting violently.”— Cable.
First to be emptied out! Heroic soul!
His lips would frame no oath where knees are
bent;
He scorned to sign his name upon the roll,
The parchment record of a Parliament;
But on a more illustrous, virgin scroll
He scrawled it for the ages as he went,
In letters firm, with ink indelible,
Laurence —or Larry, I expect—Ginnell.
He did not fall in fight, or pine in gaol,
For Erin’s sake, as lots have done before,
But as they dragged him forth, defiant, pale,
Seeking to dig his heels into the floor,
And flung him, fighting hard, out of the Dail
And shot him, still undaunted, through the door,
He must have glowed beneath his bruised hide
With all a pioneering martyr’s pride.
What though bright sons of freedom, by platoons,
Are doomed to leave the House this strenuous way,
While ev’ry night, and on most afternoons,
On heads and shoulders Irish blackthorns play,
And grinning galleries deem it tame, eftsoons,
When two or three aren’t frogs-marched out a
day—
Westmeath the glory holds of having nursed
The patriot who was ejected first.
Then fill your glasses up with fierce potheen,
Or froth them to the brim with Dublin stout.
Here’s to the Parliament on College Green!
A true-to-label one, beyond a doubt,
For when the curtain rose upon the scene
A job was waiting for the chucker-out,
And through the door upon his ear there fell
Laurence—-or Larry, it may be—Ginnell.

HE: "Hullo! What brings you out so soon?"
SHE: “This him; it wouldn’t stay at home
another minute.”
“Bullwhanger” : The Digger sat on a Mos-
umn (Sydney) ferryboat near a couple of
those Japs who pervade this suburb in such
hordes. Presently he pulled out his pipe,
filled it and produced a matchbox, lie struck
about 20, and as each one spluttered its head
off he looked earnestly at the Nipponese as
if debating some serious question with him-
self. After a couple more failures he handed
the lot over to one of the homunculi with the
remark, “Here, you have a go. lad. Y’ought
to know more about the blankards than I
do.”
* * * *
“Cosmopolite” on some Sydney hostelries:
Sydney is beginning to take that intelligent interest
in its hotels which has long characterised London
and Paris; lind the remarks (B. 14/9/’22), are an
indication of tlie fact. With some of the conclu-
sions, or suggestions, it is possible, however, to differ.
Has the Wentworth really supplanted any of its
rivals in the affections of those who make hotels
pay? The answer is in the negative. It is in very
much the position of the London Savoy, when Joseph
was brought there from Paris 20 years ago. Like
the Savoy, the Wentworth is in an out-of-the-way
part of the town, and also, like the Savoy, when the
greatest chef of his day was there, it offers a unique
feature —its dance-hall. Yet the Savoy, even at the
height of its fame as a restaurant, was not particu-
larly fashionable for residential purposes—one of the
reasons, no doubt, being the popularity of its rest-
aurant. Many of those' visitors from the Continent
or the country who patronised it continually for
meals would not have dreamt of inhabiting it. They
preferred quieter establishments, while others, rather
than face the journey to the shopping region and
Mayfair, from the big place on the Embankment,
would stay at relatively dingy old resorts, such as
Brown’s. An extraordinary example, by the way,
of the importance of situation in a great city, used
to be afforded by London’s Continental, opposite the
now defunct Raleigh Club. Every week-night its
supper-rooms were crowded with the ladies of the
half-world and their admirers: yet its residential
section remained respectable. It was so handy to
everywhere that middle-class moralists were impelled
to patronise one part of it, despite what went on in
the other.
The Hotel Australia will never be supplanted by
any Sydney hotel, if only for the reason that its
situation i 6 absolutely ideal. On the right side of
the most convenient and interesting street of Aus-
tralia’s most attractive city, it is the Claridge’s of
the Commonwealth. The present managerial policy
Of catering chiefly for the solid section of the com-
munity is the right one, at the present juncture, for
the Australia, as it is for. Usher’s and the Carlton,
over the way. Those who are “living the life”
have their drawbacks from the standpoint of a great
hotel; more especially when—-as is the case with
us—any given mass of revellers is leavened generously
by a section which has not learned the art of being
cheerful gracefully. That admirable manageress,
Mrs. Maclurcan, has shown her appreciation of this
truth by virtually quarantining her dancing cus-
tomers in a place apart from the permanent resi-
dents.
Sydney’s best hotels, which used to be amongst the
worst in the world, are rapidly moving up into the
class of those of Piccadilly and the Place de la
Concorde. The process will be closely watched; for
it is one of the marks of a civilised city, these days,
that the inhabitants should be almost as absorbed in
the manners and customs of their leading Kostelries
as in the ways of their friends.
“Flicker”: A heated discussion raged in
the Melbourne-to-Adelaide express on the
subject of the Melbourne City Council’s at-
tempt to stop the St. Patrick’s Day proces-
sion. So animated was it that the poker
game was threatened with ruin. Then did
Cohen (who was fondling three aces) try
to oil the troubled waters, as a prelude to

“Ah, veil,” he said, “vy shouldn’t they have
processions if they vant to? All the nations
like to honor the national saints. Let ’em
all have processions, I thay, the Irish and the
Welsh and the English and the Jews”— —
Here Mulcahy fixed the speaker with a
Stony glare. “Th’ Jews, is it? An’ since
when have then had a saint? And who is
he, anyway?” “Vy, I thought everybody
knew that,” said Cohen. “St. Hilda, ain’t

the two small mounds at the St. Hilda

called “The Gates of Jerusalem.”

“Harold Hardupp”: A Sydney youth left
his boarding-house last week steeped in debt,
drink and gloom, and shortly afterwards his
landlady found a note indicating the depths
of the harbor as his immediate destination.
The credulous dame broke for the nearest
police-station, and the flower of the force
began a diligent search for the corpse. The
results were absolutely nil. The personal
appearance of a prisoner, presented on re-
mand at one of the police-courts, was the
first thing to arouse suspicion that there
was no corpse to find. The prisoner con-
fessed, on being interrogated, that he was the
missing link. He had hona fide intended
to suicide, but a few more drinks had de-
cided him that life was still worth while,
and a three days’ spree ended in his being
jugged under an alias for drunk, disorderly
and tearing a bar to shreds. He had been
strongly held by the sleuths during most of
the time they were searching for him.
“Aek F. C.”: That Melbourne Herald
yarn about the girls who were attacked
with hypodermic syringes and ulterior
motives in a picture-theatre was imbecile
whichever way it was looked at. London
papers rioted! in such melodrama during
the early part of the war. when the Canucks
were blamed fur introducing dope to the
light lydies of the Piccadilly front. In addi-
tion there were harrowing tales of female
dope addicts, whoso insteps and calves were
masses of tiny needle sores. And sensational
stories were circulated of innocent country
girls being betrayed, following a puncture
on the arm in; the onen street. In these
stories the blushing maiden was always the
victim of an alluring hound in loud checks
and a foreign accent, who twirled his mo
with one hand and injected cocaine with
the other at the same moment. The
cocaine-needle, besides producing a “bite”
like a stab from a red-hot skewer, introduces
a stimulant, not an opiate, and a healthy
girl, on being so treated, would be more
likelv to kick her would-be destroyer in the
waistcoat than to fall helplessly into his
immoral arms.
“Iford” in nomenclatural vein:—
There are some names, mostly Biblical ones, that
seem to confer on their possessors a sort of hallmark
of rugger! democracy. Jabez is one of them. If I
wanted to contest Labor-selection ballots, there is
nothing I would sooner be called than Jabez, unless
it were Iliram. Nobody ever questioned the late
Jabez Wright’s solicitude for the toiling proletariat,
and when the other Australian politician with the
same front-moniker —Jabez Dodd, of W.A.—split
with his old party over the conscription issue, the
wage-earners not only refused to go back on him, at
ALL HE KNEW.
“I met Mrs. Seeks to-day
“What did she have on ?”
“Oh, a green sort of thing—she looked splendid?"
“George, you are not telling me the truth; she-lives in that green rag and looks horrible
in it."
the behest of the Trades Hall, but gave him a walk-
over when he had to re-contest his seat for a mining
electorate. It mightn’t have been due to his name
entirely, but don’t tell me it didn’t help powerfully.
There has only been one Jabez in modern times who
ever went back on those who believed in him ; and
that w’as Jabez Balfour. I believe he was a freak,
and In any case it helps my' argument, because, if
he had worn any other name, people wouldn’t have
believed in him half as long as they did. There is
another almost unique feature about the name that I
have never seen noted in print. The poet Swin-
burne once complained bitterly that there was no
rhyme in the English language to the most beautiful
of all words, “babe,” excepting “astrolabe.” But
Jabez, abbreviated, fills the bill, too. So, of course,
does Abe —short* for Abraham —but there is something
humorous-sounding about Abe, which disqualifies it
for poetry. If only Swinburne had been on inti-
mate terms with somebody' named Jabez, he might
have enriched the language with one more lyric upon
the subject that made such an appeal to him in his
declining years.
HIS TONGUE SLIPPED.
“Mai waife’s in Melbourne, and I'm going
down next week —just to give her a sur-
prise, doneherno."
“Why — e r— who —who? Who has she gone
with”
The Anglicans of Adelaide have agreed
to bury the meat-axe at last. When
the Synod was moved to authorise payment
of £153, the Bishop’s law costs in the pro-
ceedings instituted by him against Canon
Wise (and never carried out or actually
withdrawn), and £l4(i, the Chancellor’s costs
in the proceedings, which Wise brought
against him to show that he should not be
judge of the case, it was moved ns an
amendment that £l5O be paid to the Canon,
towards, his expenses in the matter. The
Bishop and the Canon, both, of whom were
present at the meeting, undertook to do
their best to have the past forgotten. The
amendment was carried, and parsons and
laymen relieved their feelings by singing
“Praise God from Whom all blessings flow."
“Digger's Batman”: Most ex-DSggers will
agree with “Onarek” (B. 7/0/’22) about
the frequency with which war distinctions
were given to the undeserving. But be
spoils a good case by quoting the back-area
sergeant-baker who got a D.C.M. This deco-
ration was earned. In the course of a
severe bombing, the bakery was smashed,
yet the Sarge carried on. re-organised his
work, and, in spite of further bombing, kept
the supplies up. Those battalions which
had been anticipating (after hearing of the
bakery smash) a bread-ration of 17 to a
loaf, or no loaf at all, were agreeably sur-
prised to find that there was no shortage of
the staff of life. If that sergeant didn’t per-
form a useful war-service under dangerous
conditions I would like to know who did.
“X2X” analyses the new Samoan
quencher:—•
“Prof's” mention of the Samoan niggers who are
becoming their own distillers (B. 31/$/'22) is a
reminder that bananas and pineapples may be made
to produce a drink which, for kick and potency,
beats potato-spirit or rice-whisky hollow. The two
fruits in question contain only a very small amount
of sugars capable of being fermented into alcohol,
but there are present other substances which are
amazingly potent and toxic. These alcohols may be
got rid of by “ageing” the distilled liquor in burnt
wood, which absorbs them. But the amateur, home
or kitchen distiller, even if he knows anything about
physical chemistry, is generally too thirsty to prac-
tise it, which explains why moonshine whisky
usually possesses so much of what has been termed
“authority'.” Fermented bananas or pineapples act
as deliriant narcotics: their effects being something
like those of hashish, which first inspires the reveller
with a desire to pull down houses and cut throats,
and next causes him to fall unconscious. As a matter
of fact, the Samoan native has not done much in the
sly banana-grog line yet; but each time one does
get busy the neighbors who have not taken cover
know all about it.

“Snell”: The poor old swaggie had come
stumbling down the road in the blinding heat
of a November day, seated himself on a log
opposite Barney’s hotel, and slid from that
into the dust in a fainting condition.
Barney explained all this. “And what did

“Ynot”: Those who are bewailing the
scarcity of apprentices in all the Aus-

cause in the relatively miserable wage paid
them during their term. The embryo car-
penter, for instance, in the third vear of
his apprenticeship, gets 275. 6d. per week,
the painter £1 155., the blacksmith 235. In
his fourth and fifth years each is, in most
particulars, a finished tradesman, but a car-
penter-apprentice in his fifth year gets only
£2 4s. Del. a week, while the tradesman gets
a minimum of 2s. 6d. an hour. Many people

“Sammas” detects a jewel in a toad's
head:—•
It is debatable whether the long-drawn-out news-
paper strike in Perth is a misfortune or a benefit.
The reading of the morning paper has hitherto been
regarded by most people as the chief virtue and
necessity of life after godliness and cleanliness.
Events have proved how easily we can swallow our
prejudices. Instead of the heavy leaders, the padded
news items and the morbid divorce and murder stuff
the city’s news has been served up in a concise and
balanced manner by a small week-end journal, which
has had the luck to keep out of the dispute. Apart
from one or two rumors that France and Germany
had again taken off their coats, and that Billy
Hughes had lost his job and was turning pro-
fessional lion-tamer, the information retailed has been
fairly accurate. It is quite possible that the ponder-
ous satire directed at the capitalists by the Labor
press, and vice versa, materially conduces to a
weakening of the average intellect. Twelve months
of newspaper starvation in Westralia might easily
improve the selective powers of the multitude, and
in that way make for the creation of the right sort
of politicians.
“Herodot” reviews one of Bananaland’s
minor industries :—•
“Camp Horse’s” policeman, who eulogised the
local J.P. for his prowess with the kip in a two-up ring
(B. 31/8/’22), is appropriately located in Queens-
land. North of Brisbane the
national game flourishes more
luxuriantly and openly than any-
where else in the Commonwealth,
and in many of the coastal towns
there are permanent schools which
are just as much a part of the
local landscape as are the muni-
cipal councillors or the pubs. In
most places there seems to be a
tacit agreement between police
and players that if the latter keep
out of the public view and do not
make nuisances of themselves they
will not be interfered with. At
Mackay there is a school in which,
when the cane-season is at its
height, some thousands of pounds
may change hands in a single
night, while Townsville, Cairns,
Innisfail and other places are all
homes of this popular diversion.
Sometimes it is conducted in an
elaborately fitted-up building; less
ambitious “stadia” consist of a
few seats, arranged circus-wise in
a mangrove swamp, with a plenti-
ful supply of manure at hand
wherewith the clouds of mos-
quitoes may be smoked off. A
year or so ago there was an estab-
lishment on the outskirts of
Cairns which was run almost on
the lines of a successful club.
Each applicant for admission was
required to show his “roll,” and
unless this was of certain stipu-
lated dimensions he was uot
allowed inside. Refreshments were
always available free of charge,
and should a patron meet with
such complete misfortune as to
be cleaned out entirely, he could
rely on obtaining enough from the
proprietors to pay his fare home, on th- Monte Carlo
principle. There seems to be no record yet, however,
of any ruined gambler damaging the prestige of a
two-up school by shooting himself on the doorstep.
“Sa.mmas”: A military censor of my
acquaintance swears to this. In performance
ot his unties, he had to open and peruse five
letters despatched by Private Smithers, all
to feminine destinations. The first four
contained four pages (apiece) of airy and
amorous nothings addressed respectively to
Ruby, Gwen, Mill.v and Trixie. The fifth
and last, a gem of brevity, bore the super-
scription of Mrs. Smithers, and read

“Lexite” : According to the ethics of 20
years ago, Dash, of the N.S.W. Public School

dressed to the Min-
ister of Education, be-
fore the recipient had

its contents. But the

regarded as quite

tioning to the dailies
that, as the Minister
for Customs has not
put a duty on the

union is thinking of
going on strike. The
idea that the person
written to may have a satisfactory
reply is completely overlooked. And as
he probably hasn’t—and, even if he has, a
satisfactory reply is the last thing wanted—
it saves time to let the public know all about
it straight away.

O-. '/?•/££•” : “Eddyson’s” courtship par. (B.
01/o/22) reminds me of a romance in which
I played a humble part. My cobber Bill
and I were convalescing at Alexandria soon
after the sounding of the Gallipoli gong.
Every evening the girls of the place would
promenade the ■ seafront, elderly chaperons
m attendance, frigidly impervious to the glad-
eye advances of the bandaged yet impassioned
Aussies. Nevertheless, Bill and I got to
know, two fair Italian sisters, and Bill soon
did his block in the most comprehensive
fashion in respect of one of them. She
spoke Italian only. Her sister spoke French
and Italian. Bill spoke neither. I could
spruik a little French. So there you are
Every evening William wooed his inamorata
per medium of the sister and myself. I put
his sallies into French, and the sister trans-
lated them into Italian. He finished up bv
marrying the girl. A little while back I
met them in Bandwick. Tinder his adorino-
- she has improved considerably in
linguistic attainments. “How do you like
Australia?” I said. “Bonzer!” she answered
fluently. Dinky!”
bis shuddersome story:
Some months ago I was at a Vic. V.D. clinic
hen a Greek reported as a patient. His was obvi-
ously a case of some standing, his body being covered
ith sores of varying dimensions, while on his hands
were a number of macular rashes and pustules. After
he had given his occupation as fishmonger, it was
sternly impressed upon him that the law forbade
him to handle food until he had been cured, or
pronounced to be no longer in an infective con-
dition He departed, grumbling, and failed to report
again for treatment, whereupon the authorities were
duly notified. A few weeks ago I ran across him
fw* 11 * c h an ged his former occupation for
that of confectioner, and was serving some children
with sweets. While I stood there this host for
millions of syphilis-germs thrust his loathsome hand
into one of the glass cases on the counter, and grop-
ing round in it, withdrew it full of lollies. At this
f ° 1 ' ecalled myself to his notice, and followed
that up by ordering the youngsters outside. What is
needed is a department specially equipped to track
down those who fail to submit themselves to treat-
ment, and to bring them before a Court when they
have been found. At present every State in Aus-
tralia is in the same position as Victoria—that is
“o * ay ’ lf is recklessly exposing innocent people to

‘‘The Rumpus”: The Westralian Govt.
Railways Death Benefit Fund finds itself
mi\ peculiar position. It was started 15
years ago, the Department paying all costs
ot administering a levy of 2s. per death.
In the early years of the fund everythin!'
went smooth as pie, with a light rate of
mortality. Death benefits rose as high as

six figures. But the war brought an almost
unbeatable crop of levies, and hardly any
new members joined. The result is the
fund is tottering. As old members die oft
the benefit decreases, and soon it will be
the realisation of the only phrase Andy
hisher ever coined—“the last man and the
last shilling! The last member will have
to levy on himself for a couple of paltry
bob. The part that hurts most will be that
he who gets least will have paid the most
away.

“ ’Dona’s” thumbnail sketch :—■
It is not only the kids in slum areas who get
a bad start in life. In one of Melbourne’s suburbs
I often see a youngster of about 13 being tucked
into a Rolls-Royce to be sent to school. I don’t
know the parents, but a mutual acquaintance assures
me that Gwendoline is quite a healthy and normal

child—so far. The car draws up at the gate; the
: liveried Jehu opens the door and stands stiffly by.
Mamma, a nurse and the passenger appear. The
nurse arranges the cushions and rugs, the chauffeur
takes the wheel, and her flappership is whisked off
(along a tram route) to her school. At good schools
m, say, England—where they know a lot about
educating the “classes” —particular care is taken
to discourage this kind of thing, in the interests of
the moneyed youngsters themselves. Nothing is
more calculated to turn a kid into a purse-proud
and altogether detestable character for life than such
a daily ritual gone through at a child’s most im-
pressionable age.

Ack F. C. ’: Melbourne is full of rumors
dealing wifh the possible sale of the Town
Hall. \\ ithout considering the question of
its being large enough (and it should be, for
in proportion Melbourne has four times as
many town-halls as London) there is the
fcict that the Town Hall corner is the most
the city and would realise up
to £200.000. It is suggested that with the
proceeds of a sale the Council could build a
larger and more impressive structure, either
across the river, near the Botanical Gardens,
or in place of the condemned Eastern
Market, of unsavory reputation and smell.
On the completion of the new hall the Coun-
cil would still have at least £lOO,OOO to
play with.
MY WIPE’S HUSBAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I often see him in the tram, the husband of my wife.
Observing’ him I smile aside, and moralise on life,
I wonder is he happy as I was in Ninety-nine,
Or wretched as was I when she for eight years had
been mine.
The husband of my wife is tall and spare, while I
am short.;
He’s fair, and I am dark; he has long whiskers of
a sort.
His chin is weak. Beneath the hair that’s rusty
and too thin.
You see his Adam’s apple jumping out and sliding in.
He has two large teeth prominent beneath his
upper lip ;
His nose is long and pendulous; and crimson at the
tip ;
He’s rather bald, and in his eyes that palely blink
at me
There is a power of patience that is marvellous to
see.
I wonder if she nags at him, I wonder if she weeps,
I wonder is he wretched when she dusts, and scrubs,
and sweeps.
I wonder if he ever takes the mud in on his heel!
And now and then for him a great compassion I
can feel.
I do not envy him, by God, though eyes as pansies
bright
My lady had, although her luir a forest was by
night.
J grieve for him while yet I think how terrible
was she
In anguish or annoyance, and I feel we brothers be.
I pity, when remembering her tongue that ran by
night;
But when I think of her red lips, her bosom round
and white,
A sudden, sullen passion makes me terrible and
grim.
I could his long neck take, just so, and squeeze the
life from him 1

“The Rumpus”: Three Westralians, Gro-
per-born and not within coo-ee of each other,
have told me the yarn with only slight varia-
tions. Forty years ago a man nicknamed “Hoppy
Dick” or “Duff-legged Dick,’’ who, despite his 16-
stone and deformed foot, managed to get about
fairly smartly, one day tackled an unusually-3ized
old man ’roo that had been stuck-up against a
jarrah-tree and was giving some dogs a bad time.
He was excited, grabbed a lump of wood and rushed
in jerkily-—and the next thing he knew the boomer
had him in a tight hug. It looked as if he was
going to be ripped down, but, the ’roo having lost
his position up against the tree, the dogs shot in
and attacked from behind, and at that moment
some men appeared. The big buck took fright and
made off again, carrying the 16-stone man in his
arms! But the load was too much, and he soon
threw “Hoppy” to one side and escaped. Can I
get further verification of this; or has any Abo.
heard of a similar case?

"Bad Bill”: A gang of us were arguing
in the cook’s galley one wet afternoon as to whether
a man could ever really understand women. The
cook himself listened a good while, then put the
lid on with: “Look here, yous blokes, Solomon, the
wisest man that ever lived—and mind you, he lived
with a thousand women for a thousand years—said
to a reporter when he was snuffing, ‘They’ve got me
dodged.’ So what flamin’ chance have yous got?”

man who carried the two sacks of flour might

Barker, at Rockhampton (Q.), for a small wager,
carried one 2001 b. sack of flour under each arm
and another on his shoulder, a distance of 50 yards
into Tom Irwin’s store. The same anaemic gent.,
also for a wager, rode a horse up the Stairs of
the Commercial Hotel, in Rocky, and after a trip
round the upper storey rode the prad down the
stairs again.

“Bill It.”: “Centurion” asks (B. 31/8/’22)
if any Abo. has known birds to repair their own
broken limbs. In Young’s Swamp (South Coast,
N.S.W.), after the opening day of the duck-shooting
season, I have often caught broken-winged and
otherwise maimed birds. They have always had
their wounds plastered over with a mixture of
dried blood, feathers and shreds of swamp reeds
that, apparently, had been fuzzied into a pulp and
applied green. Never having observed the bird
surgeons at work, I can’t swear that the application
did not cling to the wounds by accident; but I
do know that a bandicoot that has had a leg
cut dff in a rabbit-trap will pull fur out of its
body to cover the raw of the stump—because I
watched one poor fellow doing it.
“Yarrum”: Red Ned unyoked his bullocks
in front of the schobl, and next morning we heard
him cursing as never puncher cursed before. The
trouble was that the keys he had left in the bows
were missing, and he couldn’t yoke up to take his
load to the station. After a bit, the butcher strolled
along, and joined me to listen. “Gripes, isn’t he
a beaut!” said he. “I planted his flamin’ keys
under a bag in the bottom of the waggon, ’cos I
wanted to hear old Ned at his best.” When he had
had his money’s worth he buzzed off, remarking as
he went, “After a while, when he eases off a bit,
you can tell him where they are.” I didn’t feel a
bit like telling.

“Jim Domino”: Sundowners along the
Lachlan tell the yarn against a wealthy squatter,
Mr. Blank, well known for his practical jokes. A
swagman once put the hard word
on him for a pair of pants. “Pants
is it you want?” asked Mac; then
a twinkle lit up his eye and he
added, “Let’s see—wait here a
minute.” He went into the house,
and soon returned with a neat
parcel. “There you are,” he
grunted, “these should fix you
up.” The swaggie with profuse
thanks backed away, and slipped
down to the river to try on his
new strides. But when he opened
’em up he concluded that Mr. Mac
had given him the wrong bundle.
Returning to the homestead, he
encountered Mrs. Mac and, hand-
ing her the parcel, explained that
he thought the boss had made “a
bit of a mistake.” Mrs. Mac
blushed red when she discovered
that the “bit of a mistake” was
her own property; but, recover-
ing herself, she bade the man
wait, went into the house and re-
turned in a few minutes with
another parcel, “There is no mis-
take this time,” she said. Neither
there was —she had rolled up one
of her husband’s brand-new suits.
“Bouragi”: Will “Colub”
tell us what that snake is like
which lives “on the N.E. coast of
New Guinea” and “invariably
leaves its fangs in whatever it
strikes” (B. 31/8/’22) ? Also the
beast’s native name? 1 have put
i-n a lot of time on that coast
and never heard of such a snake,
though bites of the ordinary kind
are frequent enough. It is to be
hoped “Colub” is sounder on
Papuan snake yarns than he was on
Papuan geography when, not long
ago, he located loma station, four miles above
old Tamata, on Tamata Creek, at Buna Bay, 80
miles away on the coast. As to the fangs, Dit-
mars, the American herpetologist, says it is a
common thing, for some species, and he instances
the Indian cobra, which chews and worries at its
“bite,” to leave fangs in the flesh.
“Ver De Gris” (N.T.) : I’ve got a nanny-
goat that recently started milking herself. I was
inclined to think that this lacteal looping the loop
vvas a solution of the problem of perpetual motion,
till it struck me that; after a few more laps, the
milk would churn into butter, and the animal would
die of fatty degeneration of the heart. So I put a
wicket gate round her neck, and she has gone back
THE SUBTLE CAPTAIN.
“Did, ye buy a teckit from the C’ptain for the benefit for
Billy’s widow?”
“ Naw, I deedn’t; I reckon Captain's often marryin’ ’er.”
to her natural diet of jamtin-labels and beer-bottle
tops, which, judging by the product, are very rich
in proteins.
“Heredot”: Do animals ever commit
suicide? Years ago, in North-west N. S. Wales, I was
sitting one day on the bank of a railway dam, and
not far from a large iron tank, from which the loco-
motives took water, when a large t>lack duck crashed
into the side of the tank and fell dead. While I was
wondering how he could possibly have collided with
anything of such a size in broad daylight, I noticed
another duck, apparently the mate of the first, wheel-
ing overhead. A minute later there was another
crash, and the second bird dashed against the side
of the tank and was killed instantly. There was
no possibility of the ducks having mistaken the
tank for anything else, and it is hard to believe that
creatures with such highly-developed eyesight could
not have seen it in their flight. I’m inclined to
think, however, that this is what did happen in the
case of the first one —and the tragedy must have
driven the second to suicide.
* * * *
“Aramac”: What looks like a record pig
was killed the other day by a Gladstone (Q.) farmer.
It was 17 months old, and weighed, when dressed,
4001 b. The hams were 401 b. When cut up it took
a 60-gallon boiler to hold it all in salt. The pig
was reared on separated milk for the first 12 months,
and thereafter on ditto and sweet potatoes. Has
anyone heard of a bigger lump o’ pork ?
* * * *
“Yaminon”: “FY7” (B. 24/8/’22) is on
delicate ground when he talks of deerhounds killing
dingoes single-handed. Granted that some of them
will; but most hunters I’ve met say the majority
won’t. We’ve all read of their tenacity and courage
in the time of Scott; but if “FY7” got a specimen
from a Scottish home, whose ancestors for genera-
tions were used as ladies’ pets only, it probably
wouldn’t kill a cat.
* * «• •
“Morehead”: The bush horse hasn’t got
all the brains. In Baptist-street, Redfern (Sydney)
the other day, a tram-driver rang his warning bell
for a baker’s cart ahead to get off the rails. The
old bay in the shafts, cocked his ears, poked his
head around, then pulled the cart into the gutter.
There was no one in the cart,; and the baker was
serving a customer yards up the street.
I don’t think the snipe described
by “Ida Dawson” in her par. from the Argentine
(B. 24/8/’22) can be identical with the jack-snipe
of the marshy lands of Australia. Our jack-snipe
migrates about early Autumn, and marked birds have
been identified in Siberian marshes. There they mate
and nest, and the plumage changes at this period.
I know of no instance of a snipe nesting in Aus-
tralia —and “Ida D.” avers that the Argentine
snipe does not nest in the Argentine. While on
the subject, can any Abo. explain the mystery of the
jack-snipe call-bird? In the first week in August
(which is particularly early) I rose a solitary
snipe on a swamp near my home, and several days
later I put up several in the same place. I have
noted the arrival of a solitary bird year after year,
and he is always joined later by scores of his pals.
Is he a scout whose job it is to investigate the
larder? And does he send a wireless to birds pass-
ing over?
* * * *
“W.A.D.”: I think “Pro” (B. 17/8/’22)
is wrong in saying certain flies slaughter insects
to use their bodies as incubators and mu-series.
Wasp-flies (Conopidae) deposit their eggs on living
creatures, bees, caterpillars,
etc., and the living host is
ultimately devoured. Another
species sting spiders into par-
alysis and seal them up in mud
nests with their eggs, the
young grub feeding on the
living but inert spiders. The
real vixen, however, is Priocne-
mis bicolor , of the order
Pompilulce, one of the fossores,
or diggers, and it is prob-
ably the “fly” noted by “Pro.”
This large wasp is yellow and
striped with black like a tiger,
and its chief prey is the cicada
(miscalled locust). One thrust
of the great wasp’s sting, and
the song is ended. The cicada
is not killed, but its motor
nerves are paralysed. The wasp
then drags the helpless body to
a tunnel she has prepared in
some sandy place, and buries
it with her egg attached. Were
the cicada dead—as “Pro”
suggests—it would decay, and
the young wasp-grub would
perish for want of food; but
as it is the tucker supply keeps
fresh and juicy for the young-
ster’s arrival.

“L. & To m m y”;
Strange foster-parents is il ?
A friend of mine, at Unley
(S.A.), had an Orpington hen
which, after hatching a clutch
of six, got into a dispute with
a cat regarding the young ’urn,
and died. The chicks would
probably have gone out also
were it not for my friend's
collie, who, though an inex-
perienced bachelor, took charge
of the fluffy ones. They would
follow him about the yard,
nestle between his front paws when he lay
down, and at night they went into the kennel
with him and found a warm spot against his hairy
body. The dog stuck to his job for some weeks
until the youngsters could fend for themselves.
Another brood in the same yard was somewhat
depleted by feline marauders, but no cat got a
chance at the dog’s foster-family.
“Yarran”: My candidate for the young
Australian stakes (B. 31/8/’22). is Austin Fowler,
of Port Macquarie (N.S.W.). He stands sft. llin.
in his socks, weighs 13st. 9Jlb., and is only 13
years of age. His parents are both ordinary-sized
people. I know another young Australian who has-
been putting on a stone a year ever since he was
a little chap. lie is now 23 in both age and weight.
* # * *
“Min Yip”: Re controversy on exter-
minating cockroaches on board ships. Nothing shoit
of sinking, as suggested by “Sandgroper’’ (B.
7/9/’22), will completely get rid of them in the
tropics; but on the monkey boats, on the West
African Coast, we had a simple way of keeping them
from over-running our cabins. Smear the inside of
a glass tumbler with glycerine, put a little stale beer
or anything that the pests like, in the bottom, and
place close to a bulk-head near their runs. I have
BLACK PESSIMISM.
“Here, Billy, which road's the best—this one
or that one?”
“It doan’ matter wot pheller road you take;

often got the tumbler half-full in the morning. The
glycerine, if evenly smeared, prevents the ’roaches
from crawling out. In my case a few drops of
chloroform did the rest; but there’s always plenty
of water in the sea to drown ’em.

THE HOMESTEAD DANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Soft and scented and still and fine,
Night on the homestead lies ;
Solemn the timbered hills around,
Cloudless the starry skies.
iloof-strokes sounding on rock and root,
Echoing far, ring out—
Who comes hither so hot of hoof?
Lovers in haste, no doubt. •
Lovers in haste, with love to spur,
Riding ’neath gumtrees stark —
Else why gather the homestead girls
There, at the gate, in the dark.
Lovers up to the garden-gate
Galloping out of the night—
Greetings, laughter and jingling bits,
Brown hands closing on white.
Darkness lies on the timbered hills,
Bright is the night indoors;
Rough was the track the horsemen rode,
Smooth are the polished floors.
Stillness now at the homestead gate,
Silence and nought to rouse
Creek-side curlew or cattle-dog;
Mirth in the lamp-lit house.
Out to the garden, green and fresh,
Sweet in the scented gloom,
Music, summoned from ivory notes,
Steals from the drawing-room.
Darkly-drooping the roses sleep
Dreaming of dam, perchance;
Measured and slow the lovers move,
Dancing an old-time dance.
Rose-light lighting their shining hair,
Tresses and coils and curls,
Sweetness, making them almost swoon,
Thrills through the dancing girls.
Round and round in the polished room,
Each with her partner goes,
Each with a flower-name, flower-like, too,
Violet, Lily and Rose.
To-and-fro, with their wise old folk
Watching from window and door,
Dance the dancers till midnight sounds,
And the dancers dance no more.
Gone the horsemen, and near and far
Nought in the night is heard—
Nought but a song in the river-gums
Sung by a shepherd-bird.

“Pick”: “Yarrum” (B. 31/8/’22) had hia
leg Stretched when told by Monaro (N.S.W.)
ancients that the stonewall fences had unaccount-
ably disappeared. Though neat enough, when
erected by Chinese gangs in the ’eighties they
later bulged out of shape, fell by the road, and
became an eyesore on the landscape. Moreover,
sheep on the roam used to canter casually over
them, and, when in the ’nineties the rabbits invaded
Monaro, they afforded a ready harbor for the cotton-
tail myriads. The landowners then dismantled
them. Some had the stones tipped into creeks and
gutters, where, in time they were buried in silt;
but if “Yitfrrum” looks round on BiWbenluke,
Gunningrah, Mt. Cooper and the plains of Bobun-
darah and Cooma, he will find many miles of the
scattered gibbers lying thickly along the bound-
aries and cross fences.

“Jim Carew” : In the early days dysentery
killed off thousands of Binghis ; and yet they had an
unfailing remedy close at hand. But this was known
to very few tribes. The gum of the wattle, is a sure
cure. It is effective if eaten raw, but it seems to
act better if it is boiled in milk. The gum can be
gathered at any time of the year, and will keep for
an indefinite period.

“Cutter”: I never took my booze in the
form of pumpkin until I visited a Maori cocky at
Bell Block (M.L.) the other day. Wirimu runs one
end of a piece of woollen thread through the
cork of a bottle of port-wine and implants the
other end in the pumpkin stalk. Capillary attrac-
tion empties the bottle in 24 hours. The only
trouble with the delicious product is that it won't
keep, and I promised William to ask the Abo.
‘Council to try and solve that part of the problem
ifor him.

“Murkah”: Re “M. Beedy’s” iodine cure
(B. 24/8/’22) for strychnine baits. When iodine is
added to a solution of strychnine (the contents of
the dog’s stomach) iodide of strychnine is immedi-
ately precipitated. This is practically insoluble, and
thus passes off before absorption takes place. It will
not, however, work with the human animal. I once
Saw a drover cure a strychnined dog by more violent
means. He held it under water till it ceased to
struggle. Then, holding it downhill, he “pumped”
till the dog was empty. “Cruel, but it works,” he
said.

“Waiter, do you know.l have been waiting half-an-hour for
my steak?”
“Yes, sir; I know, sir. If they was all as patient as you, sir,
life would be worth living.”
“E.P.D.”: “FY7” (B. 24/8/’22) says
the female of the red ’roo is always of a bright blue-
grey color. I have frequently shot red does with
coats as bright as any buck’s. The blue ’roos, both
buck and doe, are always called “blue fliers,” and
I have understood them to be a different breed; but
I have often seen a red doe mothering a blue joey,
or vice versa. So, is the coloring only a variation of
the one breed?

“How vos der telephone service around here, Mr. Jacobsen?”
“Aeh, it vos all righdt. Ven Goldstein had his fire it took t’irty minutes to raise der

“Caesar”: The ’possum-snarer’s cheque
mentioned by “Derf Commor” (B. 31/8/’22) wasn't
anything out of the box. Most of the trap-
pers on the Upper Brisbane River (Q.) are now
cursing the income-tax. A fortnight after the season
opened one brought in 40 dozen to a local buyer, and
collected £175 in notes. He swore blind he got
them all in the fortnight, too. I haven’t heard the
amount of his cheque for the season, but, anyhow,
he’s bought a motor now, and you can’t get within
a mile of him for the stink of ’possum and petrol.

“’Sfact”: I know a Hamily who ilived
in the Tasmanian bush, nine miles from a township,
and the three eldest youngsters (ages, when I in-
quired, 12 to 17) walked the nine miles regularly
twice a day to and from school. None of the three
missed one day for three years ; and the bush track
was through very hilly country, too.
* * » •
“Billern”: I have never come across a
case of a bird le-
setting its own
leg (B. 31/8/’22),
but at Capetown a
party of us, all Diggers
minus a limb, were
inspecting the Zoo on
the Rhodes estate,
when we came on a
fellow-warrior. He was
an old crane gravely
plodding about on an
artificial leg. No, I’m
not asking you to be-
lieve he made it him-
self. The foot had evi-
dently been amputated,
and a humane keeper
nad inserted the stump
in a piece of bamboo
with a rubber cap.
The yells of delight
from the “stumpies”
quite upset the old
chap’s dignity. The
climax, however, was
reached when we re-
turned to the boat and
told the rest. They
were frankly sceptical
and accused us of try-
ing to extend the only
leg each had left. At
last one big Billjim
drawled: “But didn’t
youse chaps see the pelican? No? Why yer clean
missed it. They’ve an old bird there, what’s a
double amp. and you just ought to see him—lie
wheels himself lound in a chair!”
* * * * .
“Chum”: “Aramac’s” bullocks must have
been drought-stricken (B. 17/8/’22). Six sold at
Addington (M.L.) National Market killed as fol-
lows: 1904, 1820, 1760, 1536, 1440 and 1437 pounds.
They were all bought by one butcher.
“Stellsby”: I wouldn’t like to call “M.F.”
(B. 31/8/’22) another, but I doubt whether his old
mutton-birds stick to Trial Harbor and Macquarie
Heads (Tas.) all the year round. Anyhow, young o v
old, their sojourn at Cape Woolami and Westernport
(Vic.) is limited to three weeks, and every year their
advent and exodus are timed to the day, which proves
that the fishy-flavored birds do migrate. While we’re
about it —where is the bush and city birds’ God’s
Acre? I’m often in the bush, but I’m darned if I
ever see a dead bird. Even the domestic sparrow
shoos off somewhere to die. Probably the final
migration is to Macquarie Heads.
“Morob” : About the only form of narcotic
that Binghi in his wild state ever uses
is the Central and Northern Australian
plant known as “pituri,” with which
a habit somewhat similar to that of
opium or cocaine may be formed. The
leaves, which exude a gummy sub-
stance, are pounded up, then rolled
into six-inch rolls, the gummy exuda-
tion holding them together, so that
they may be carried behind the ear.
In the old days abos. would travel
hundreds of miles to get it by barter
from tribes living where it grew;
but to-day the only Binghis who even
know of it are a few tribes in the
southern portions of the Territory,
and in some of the western Gulf dis-
tricts. The plant contains a very high
percentage of the alkaloid known as
“duboisine” and two other bodies, one
an alkaloid and the other a glucoside,
both of which are as yet unclassified.
These bodies produce a certain physi-
cal and mental stimulation, in which
respect they resemble cocaine. The
habit formed by them, however, is by
no means so deep-seated, and although
the natives made every effort to get
the stuff, they did not suffer much
when they failed.
* #
“Larrapinta”: It may in-
terest those Abos. who object to the
use of clean mud as a covering for
wounds to hear that a well-known firm
of druggists has had a good embrocation and oint-
ment on the market for years, which consists of a
finely-ground white clay (kaolin) and oil.

“W.K.8.”: As an Australian lumbering
in Borneo, with a knowledge of virgin bush in the
Otways, Upper Yarra and Gippsland (Vic.), I have been
struck by the comparative absence of fauna in actual
timber areas in their virgin state in Australia.
’Possum are never really numerous, koala ditto; and
wallaby, wombat and flying squirrel thrive better
after the bush is burnt off or in more open messmate
and peppermint country. The only prosperous in-
habitants of virgin ash, gum and stringy bush seem
to be lyrebirds, native cats, black cockatoos and
kookaburras. Coming to these tropical parts, the
real timber country holds the maximum of live-
stock. Elephants leave their footprints round the
egging machines nightly, pythons, orang-outangs,
bears, deer and iguanas are numerous. The latter
have a rough time, as the Chinese fallers reckon
them the daintiest of flesh. The Malay bushman
anmes specially the planduck, a small deer of about
lb., with a bird-like call. The übiquitous monkeys
1 have not mentioned. They are as familiar as the
fleas round a Victorian timber camp.
“Tren”: While mutton-bird is on the
menu let me remark that of all birds in the world
they are the most easily caught. They can’t rise
from the ground without first running and planing
down hill for a dozen yards or so; consequently,
as they are not as fleet of foot as a common fowl,
one merely heads them up hill and—there you
are. I have always been puzzled as to whether
they alight on the water at any time during their
fishing excursions, or when they migrate. If they
do, how the devil do they get into the air again?

“747 ’: They’re getting scared of a new
mice plague in Northern Vic. If it comes it will
have to be a pretty hefty one to beat some of the
figures of the 17 visitation. At Lascelles, for a
four nights’ catch 500,000 mice (estimated at eight
tons) were disposed of. They were trapped by the
double-fencing system. Curious how these mice
plagues disappear as suddenly as they arrive, and
dead mice are not found to any extent either. Where
they come from and go to in such quantities is a
mystery. Another remarkable thing is the absence
of young ones in the swarm. The mice practically
all appear to be full-grown.

“F.H.R.”: A horse belonging to a trapper
scoffed 500 thistle baits, containing, roughly, a
quarter of an ounce of strychnine, and suffered' no
ill effects—in fact, he hasn’t been poor since. An-
other prad, discovered in the act of purloining the
same sort of baits, was shooed off before he got the
full issue—and promptly died. Can a dose be so
much over the odds as to be harmless ?
“Rhino”: While Abos. are arguing about
the best rifle and ammunition for killing alligators,
what about the old-time method of some of the
Malaita (Solomons) natives? A short length of the
bowel of a pig is tied at one end, then filled with
small hermit crabs in their shells (thousands of
which can be picked up on any of the Solomons
beaches), and the other end tied up. This is thrown
into the water where the ’gator is, and, when he
swallows it, the crabs try to eat their way out, and
kill him in quick time by puncturing his stomach
and other vital parts. I’ve never seen this method
used, and don’t want to; but it’s sworn to by many
old natives of parts of Malaita.

“Jackerooster” : Recent pars, re feathered
suicides remind me of a swan found hanging by
the neck from a telegraph-pole on a Riverina
(N.S.W.) station. Flying low, he had, by unlucky
chance, driven his head into the “U” hook between
pole and insulator. As the reporter at the execu-
tion puts it, “death was instantaneous.”
“Joe Collins”: The other day I dropped
on a novel scheme for stopping a horse from jumping
fences. A neat hole was punched in the point of
A CASE FOR THE S.P.C.A.
“Yes, you're a good dairy-farmer all right; but yer too
blanky cruel to kookaburras.”
“What! I never shot no jackass in me life.”
“No, hut yer keep those milkcans rattlin’ so constant the
poor birds is all dying fer leant of sleep.”
each ear, a string looped through these and tied
under the throat, so that the ears were pulled down-
ward. The idea was that a horse always puts his
ears forward before jumping, and won’t jump unless
he can do this. Anyway, it stopped the prad I
saw it used on, and had the advantage over other
methods of not otherwise hindering the animal.
“Old Timer”: Can any Abo. tell me how
dingoes kill 18-months-old cattle? They don’t choke
them, as they do small animals. I invariably find
the beast in a sitting position with the hind legs
under the body, fore legs extended, and the neck
and head stretched between the forelegs. The top
of the shoulders (withers) is eaten away, but not
enough to kill them, or even make them helpless.

What an important factor the tyre
plays in motoring—the utility and
charm of the automobile absolutely
depends on the reliability of the tyres
used. This being the case the question
as to which tyres to use is a vital one. To
experiment with various makes of tyres is an
expensive experience—and it is far better to start
off with the best. There is unmistakeable evidence
on our roads that there is ONE MAKE of tyre more
popular with carists than any other—and that is the
Dunlop ‘‘Railroad.” You see it everywhere—in fact
about 50 per cent, of the cars in this country are shod with
DUNLOP TY
This popularity has been earned by giving exceptional service
at a low running cost. These tyres —by their quality and
strength—have won a reputation for running many thousands
of miles without giving the slightest trouble —and that’s what
motorists want. Undoubtedly “Railroads’’ are the best tyres on
the road to-day—and it’s a payable proposition to fit them. Made in
sizes to fit any car and any class of rim. Your garage can supply

podge Brothers Motor Car does not owe its popularity to
individual or occasional performances.
The attributes of reliability, long life and economy for which
Dodge Brothers Motor Car is known everywhere are univer-
sally conceded to be the three qualities which should first
be demanded in a car.
That these three features stand out so prominently in Dodge
Brothers Motor Car can only be due to the fact that it is
very reliable, that its life is very long, and that its saving
of petrol and tyres is pronounced.
The petrol consumption is unusually low
The tyre mileage is unusually high

Instead of going to the dance Millicent
had Jones drive her to the home of Mrs.
Douglas—a friend of whom she was very
fond. J
“I’m delighted to see you, dear,” was Mrs
Douglas’s greeting; “but I understood you
to say that you were going to a dance to-
night.”
“I was, but —er—well, I’m tired of being
a wallflower.”
I m sorry, dear. Did you enjoy that
book I lent you?”
“I did, indeed; especially where Trine
says that you can usually be what you make
np your mind to be. Now, I want to be
beautiful. Do you think if I desire beauty
long enough, and earnestly enough, it will
ever come to me?”
It will, dear, if, as Well as desiring, you
take practical means of assisting nature.”
“I would love to. I wonder if you would
be kind enough to advise me?”
“In the first place you need a good cream
that will nourish, and at the same time
remove the discoloration from your skin.”
“I did use a cream, and that horrid hair
you see on my face is the result.”
“So many creams do grow hair on the
face; but have you ever tried mercolized
wax?”
“No; I’ve heard of it. I thought, how-
evei, that it, too, might favor the growth
ot hairs.”
Not at all, dear. I’ve used it for quite
a long. time. You’ve heard of Frenchwomen
going into retirement during Lent, and hav-
ing the skin of their faces and necks re-
moved by a painful process.”
“Yes; I’ve read about it.”
“Well, mercolized wax has the same effect
without causing any pain or inconvenience.
At night, before retiring, you simply wash
your face in warm water, using a good
soap—l always use Pilenta Soap—then
w i ■* die ' wax t° your face and neck.
Wash it off in the morning, and before
powdering rub in a little of the mercolized
wax, . which is obtainable from most good
chemists. Instead of ordinary powder I
always use cleminite, which gives that soft
velvety bloom to the complexion.
I or those blackheads on your nose and
chin, stymol tablets are the best cure. Drop
a tablet in a tumbler of hot water, and when
the fizzing has subsided bathe the face with
the liquid. After drying you will find that
the blackheads have come out on the towel.
“For the hairs on your face there’s
nothing better than powdered pheminol,
which removes the hairs without disfiguring
the skin.”
How very fortunate I met you, Mrs.
Douglas.”
“Now, for your hair. The first thing to
is to shampoo it with stallax!”
Yes, I’ve written that down. But I don’t
suppose you know of anything that will
keep my hair in curl?”
“Yes, I do—something, in fact, that will
make it curl.”
“How marvellous!”
“It’s a perfectly simple preparation, callec
silmerme, which you can get at the chemist’*
and you apply on retiring at night. Brush
your hair out in the morning, when it wil:
be beautifully wavy, and any short piece*
curly.”
“Oh, how lovely that will be! You can’t
think what a load you’ve taken off my mind.

politics, in which Australia is vitally in-

(1) Why did the Belgian mission consist of two

(2) Why was the British press-agent the owner of
a rather scurrilous weekly paper?
(3) Who is Ma Soo?
(4) Why does Elihu Root sit sideways to his visi-

(5) Why has Henry Cabot Lodge become only a

(6) In what respect are Charles E. Hughes and

human slaughtering of animals? Account for his
rise to be First Lord of the Admiralty.
(10) Why does M. le Baron de Cartier speak Eng-

(11) What are the relations of the “Servants of
India” to the “untouchables”?
(12) Why is Aristide Briand a habit with France;
and does that give him an “anonymous face” ?
The answers are contained in this derisive
volume, and much more information of a
similar character —all invaluable in the
opinion of the world’s chancelleries.
Sologub
Feodor Sologub lias been loosely described
as a compound of Tchekhof and Poe, but one
might as well say that he recalls Blake or
Dickens. Mystic, realist, romantic, decadent,
he has covered the whole ground of litera-
ture, writing of anything as his imagina-
tion willed, and producing a pile of books
that defy your endeavors to pin him down
to a definite attitude to Life. There are
short stories of his expressing the childish
wistfulness and fatalism of Tchekhof. There
are others as ruthless as anything by
Andreyev or Gorki; others again that are
dream-tales reflecting Dunsany’s sophisti-
cated wonder. Strange dramas, posed in a
symbolism to mask a nervous political pro-
paganda, have come steadily from his pen
along with novels that lurch from a sweet
and ghostly idealism into lubricity and dip-
somania. Some of his characters have a
bristling: and vulgar sanity ; some are elusive,
shadowy, wan—but all seem to have the
definite mission of parading some fancy that
has seized their creator’s soul for the
moment. They, in fact, are the sandwich-
men of illusions that have come from the
hinterland of the mind.
It is in “The Little Demon” that we behold
Sologub in all his variations from solemn
realist to mystic poet and philosopher. The
“Demon” is called the Nedotikomlca, an
animal from the same menagerie as Marie
Corelli’s green tiger in “Wormwood.” The
beast is the constant companion of Fere-
donov, a village school-teacher, whose con-
genital tendency to lunacy has been deep-
ened by vodka until he lives in a nightmare
of hallucinations. For example, he tears
down the wallpaper in his room because he
is convinced that the Nedotikomka is hiding
behind it. In another delirium he puts out
the eyes of the kings, queens and jacks of
a pack of cards because they haunt him.
An even more garish imbecility is to brand
himself with the letter “P” on stomach and
forearms through the fear that one Volodin,
whom he subsequently murders, is going to
impersonate him. The dreadful creature
staggers through the book, and is kept vividly
in the foreground by the power of his fren-
zies. But he has none of the frank brutality
that would be a passport into the desperate
company of L'Assommoir. He is presented
as a peculiarly Russian horror with his
native pessimism and artlessness bestialised
by drink into outrageous perversities. One
cannot overlook Peredonov. Perhaps the
memory of him remains because there is
something racial in his tragedy—something
that is strongly suggestive of the national
haplessness and decay.
But “The Little Demon” is not confined
to Perodonov’s biography. There is a curi-
ous idyll between a boy, Sasha Piliukov, and
an older maiden, Liudmijla Routilov, which
has the faint complexion of a matured amor,
yet recalls the unearthly lyi'ic innocence of
a pair of Maeterlinck phantoms. The same
distant rapture runs through “The Created
Legend,” a novel that assumes a poetic
stature and wanders in odd places into reli-
gious mysticism. But the most striking
feature is the episode between Alkina, a
beautiful girl of accommodating virtue, and
Tiridov. a poet and teacher. As far as one’s
knowledge goes, the literature of the world
contains nothing so paganly shameless as
Alkina’s surrender to Tiridov’s tired lust.
She is the chief offender in a scene that
would make Anna Karenina swerve into
mid-Victorian respectability. Anna was, at
least, a lady, and never allowed Tolstoi to
pry too closply into her assignations. But
Alkina’s eroticism brooks no concealment,
though her affaire is robbed of the porno-
graphic stimulus of a Hubert Wales peep-
show by her refusal to embellish a natural
passion with the decor of English impro-
priety.
Sologub, whose real name is Teternikov,
and who was a Petrograd schoolmaster, has
written many essays and plays, and has pro-
duced poetry of a very high order. The
late George Calderon, the brilliant author of
“The Fountain” (it was once staged in
Melbourne by Gregan McMahon), spoke
favorably of Sologub’s dramas in a witty
article in the Quarterly Review some years
ago. A back number of the Fortnightly
also contains an appreciation of Sologub’s
other prose work, so he is not unknown to
English students of literature. My own
acquaintance with his writings began with
the aforementioned novels and numerous
short stories which have been issued in Eng-
lish translations. If not dead—l have not
heard of him since the beginning of the war
—he must now be a very old man. His
first story was published in 1864, and in
the late ’seventies he has joined the
charmed circle of Best Sellers. A “politi-
cal,” like most Russian intellectuals, he
escaped the attentions of the Government
by allegorising bis opinions beyond identifi-
cation by the police. The “Created Legend”
is . full of disguised allusions to political
events, ritual murders and musty traditions
that shocked his finer sensibilities. What-
ever the verdict of posterity on his work, he
must remain interesting for his mental com-
plexity. Dostoieffsky’s spirit we know from
his books. Turgeniev is visible through the
smoke screens of “Fathers and Children.” But
even if on a lower literary plane, Sologub
has the looming significance of an enigma.

Henry Harland
An American, born in St. Petersburg, edu-
cated at Rome and Paris, who did most of
his work in England. That is as near to
the cosmopolite as it is given a man to
be, unless he were married in Greece, and
murdered in Germany. Henry Harland, no
inconsiderable figure himself, was the man
who fought failure with the “Yellow Book”
in the “naughty ’nineties,” and numbered
among his contributors Henry James,
Arthur Symons, Dawson, Yeats, Beardsley
and Max Beerbohm. Ills name was the peg
upon which were hung the literary ambitions
of the reactionary young realists, Gallicists,
decadents and dilettantes who clustered
round his chair. Harland was early in the
field of letters. His first novels dealing with
Jewish-American life appeared before the
days of Zangwill; and “As it Was Written,”
the story of a Jewish musician, saw the
press in 1885, when Harland was not 24
years of age. In this book and its succes-
sors he was sensational without being suc-
cessful.
His early work appeared under the name
of Sydney Luska; but in 1890 he came to
conquer London, and published under his
own name “Two Women or One” and “Mea
Culpa.” Neither of these could be called
inspiring; but Harland, like Oliver Wendell
Holmes, was simply making the public pay
him while learning how to write. lie was
as ready as Bennett to write “shockers” for
sale. In 1893, his preliminary over, he
came out with “Mademoiselle Miss and
Other Stories,” which revealed the real Har-
land j and in the year following he was
appointed editor of the “Yellow Book.”
“Mademoiselle Miss” contains five short
stories, all of which exhibit, for the first
time, the grace, charm and airy treatment
which are associated with his name. Har-
land had come under the French influence
early in life, and in his fourth volume are
echoes of de Maupassant. The sketches are
typical of the French conte, and in their
humor and happiness are not to be bettered
even bv our most Gallic of writers, Leonard
Merrick. The two finest tales, indeed, are
French in their setting; the title story tells
of a little English governess who finds her-
self in a cheap hotel and is thrown into
some of the most disreputable company of
the Quartier, while “The Funeral March
of a Marionette” is typical of the pathos
which Harland can command, and which is
so closely linked with laughter. Harland.
was a master of the conte; like Tchekhof and
the later Russians his stories lead to no-
thing : they are airy trifles spun round the
moment, real pictures of life in which there
is no continuity and no climax. He should
never have essayed the novel, for his inven-
tion was not strong, and he was incapable
of sustained effort.
In “Grey Roses,” published in 1895, he
repeats scenes and sentences again and
again. Like Wilde, when, he wrote a good
thing it did not stale for him in the re-
setting. But he was doomed to be a popular
success; and it was with “The Cardinal’s
Snuffbox” and “The Lady Paramount,” pub-
lished at the beginning of this century, that
he at length “set the great silly public by
the ears.” These stories are sensitive and
sentimental, gracefully written and relieved
by flashes of brilliant wit. The unreality of
their atmosphere is rivalled only by their
slenderness in subject matter. They are
excellent essays in decorative art.
Harland seems to have been, to some
extent, conscious of his limitations—perhaps
sure of his strength. He remained content
with his craft; he was an etcher of instants,
and he did not yearn towards the crowded
canvas or the painting of an acre of Academy
theme. From our modern atmosphere of
argument and incident he stands apart. His
work is not ambitious; but when did the
dry-point needle build a battleship? In
“Mercedes,” “The Broken Looking-glass,”
“When I Am King,” “A Responsibility” and
other of the stories contributed by him to
the first half-dozen numbers of the “Yellow
Book,” his art is seen at its finest. He
was the first of our prose impressionists,
the precursor of a movement which will be
long in the land.
QUENTIN POPE.
The Inky Way
“My dear lady, there is not a bucket-shop or a
fraudulent mining company in the world which
dares to conduct its business on such swindling
lines as a church-bazaar. There is no form of finan-
cial enterprise, however unsound or illegal, which
is not beatifically smiled upon there. I should
think you might even pick people’s pockets if you
dressed up for it and called it a game.” —A cynically
candid parson in James Hilton’s new novel, “Storm
Passage.”
“Thor”: Did ever a black-and-white artist follow
the fashions as cleverly as Souter has done for SO
years or more? I have been looking up some of his
bygone sirens and comparing them with his skimpily-
clad and showily-gartered flappers of to-day. He
seems to have missed no point in the frocking pro-
gress of the fairest to the barest. But Souter’s
blasfi old tile-roamer has never changed with the
years. Surely that cat has lived more than its
allotted nine lives.
A not unhumorous aspect of the recent trouble
between Hobart Mebcury and its linotypers was the
fact that the latter could draw payment, at scheduled
rates, for all the “house”-made process blocks of
type-written sheets of news printed in lieu of the
ordinary linoed matter. Owing to the number and
length of the conferences and stop-work meetings
the operators found it necessary to hold there was
hardly any time left for type-setting. But as the
cost was “on the house” there were no complaints
among the down-trodden wage-slaves.
“Coot”: The Argos, finding itself cramped for room
in its Collins-street home, has purchased a large block
of land at the corner of Elizabeth and Little Latrobe
streets. Here up-to-date premises will be erected,
and when the importer’s organ shifts its
cotton brolly there the Age will be the
only paper published in Collins-street. For many
years three Melbourne dailies came out within a
stone’s throw of one another, the now defunct Daily
Telegraph being published next door to the Argus.
When the D.T. expired the Herald took over the
Weekly Times and the deceased’s building. It re-
moved to Flinders-street in the ’nineties.
“The Rumpus”: The newspaper strike in Perth
(W.A.) hit two men badly. Both are inmates of
the Home of Peace (incurables). One is quite a
young man with his spine so injured that he will
never again, feel the floor under his feet. The other,
a subject to fits, fell into a fire and had his sight
burned out. It was the joy and pride of the blind
man, each morning, to feel his way to the office, get
the morning paper, and return triumphantly to
his cobber with the bad back. Equally was it the
bedridden one's pleasure to read aloud every particle
of news.
“The Rumpus”: I like reading the “Answers to
Correspondents,” but I still cherish a grievance
against the column. I wrote a perfectly bonzer
story, but it reached The B. when the editor had a
crook liver, and he made some remarks 'discouraging
to a literary aspirant. J next sent my literary
gem to the ’Possum Flat Outlook. It was returned
with a shilling to pay, being gummed down.
The blamed editor at ’Possum Flat wrote on the
MS.: “The ’P. F. Outlook is not a dumping-
ground for other papers’ rejects; otherwise your
story would have been accepted.”
At the St. Peter’s College Exhibition (Adelaide) on
the 29th August a letter (the property of Mrs. Arthur
Rymill) written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in the
year 1822 was on view. This shows the poet in a
somewhat unexpected r6le. The letter was addressed
to Leigh Hunt—evidently in reply to a request that
Shelley back a bill drawn in favor of Lord Btyron
for £3OB. Shelley states he is quite willing to do
this, but only on condition that he is guaranteed
“a tip of from £5O to £60.” lie concludes his
benevolent epistle with t-he statement that he merely
awaits an assurance of this commission before for-
warding a bill for £250 on his bankers in place of
that for £3OO.
“Bret Vane”: A Gallipoli story without Anzacs!
Critics are quite concerned because Ernest Raymond,
in his “Tell England,” does not mention the Austra-
lians. (Which he does, by the way.) The fact of
the matter is that the yarn is not a Gallipoli story,
anyhow, nor yet even a war story, and the book
does not profess to give a detailed account of the
operations on the Peninsula. Raymond’s hero spent
some of his life at school and some in the army—on
Gallipoli, as it happened—and the tale is one of his
development during those years, a tale of his re-
actions to the particular bit of play and war in
which he moved. As he himself savs of the story,
“It is me." The story of the schooldays is quite the
best part of the book, by the way.
“Ike Hollar”: The Australian is well in the
picture in the literature of the U.K. just now—a
matter chiefly of A.I.F. memories. He stands chiefly
for courage, steadfastness and several other iron
virtues, also divers physical graces. This is a
bouquet propelled by John Buchan, in “Hunting-
tower” : “He was tall and free from any superfluous
flesh; his face was lean, finely-drawn and deeply
sunburnt, so that the hair above showed oddly pale;
the hands were brown and beautifully shaped, but
the forearm... ;was as brawny as a blacksmith’s'....
His voice was low and pleasant.” Again: “Aus-
tralians—you can’t mistake them. There’s nothing
else so lean and fine produced in the globe to-day.
1 was next to them at Pozieres, and saw them fight.
Lord! Such men! Now and then you had a freak,
but most looked like Phoebus Apollo.” Later still:
“You can never mistake their voice; it’s got the
sun in it.”
“Wilfrido”: Under the will of Joseph Pulitzer
certain prizes are given annually for the best liter-
ary and journalistic achievements in Uncle Sam’s
country. The selection committee consists of mem-
bers of the teaching staff of the Columbia Univer-
sity School of Journalism. The 1921. awards include
2000 dollars to James Truslow Adams'for his history
of the founding of New England, and 1000 dollars
apiece to Booth Tarkington, Hamlin Garland, Edwin
Arlington Robertson and Eugene O’Neill for the best
novel of American life, the best biography, the best
volume of verse and the best play of' the year.
Kirke L. Simpson acquired 1000 dollars for the
best bit of reporting (the ceremonies attending the
burial of the “Unknown Soldier”), while 500 were
doled out to Frank M. O’Brien for the best editorial
and the same to Rollin Kirby for the best cartoon.
This is the second time that Booth Tarkington has
been a prize-winner, and, judging from a recent
survey of his book sales, the honor should be worth
a lot more to him than the money.
“Machete”: “Burton Admirer” (B. 24/8/’22) dis-
courses of the naughtiness of Richard Burton’s
“Arabian Nights,” and speaks of expurgated and
unexpurgated editions. There is nothing very dread-
ful in the “Nights” themselves, as the translation
by Payne shows. Payne was one of the greatest
Oriental scholars of all time, and Burton sought his
aid and borrowed his translations in many cases.
Oriental scholars say that Payne’s translations are
much truer to the text than Burton’s, and anyone
comparing- the two will admit Payne’s literary
superiority. Where Burton excelled all others was
in his extraordinary acquaintance with the pornicity
of what we call the Eastern mind. He never touched
this side of life without probing it to its depths. His
acquaintance with his subject is shown in the extra-
ordinary notes in the complete edition of his works.
He catches up an allusion in the text and takes his
reader down strange bypaths which lead from Persia
to the American prairies, from Canton to Antwerp,
and make one marvel at the mind which mapped
them out. It is in these notes that the value of
Burton’s work lies —but it is not good currency
virginibus puerisque.
“E.C.”: Why do so many writers, in committing
to paper the vernacular used by their characters,
mutilate the spelling of the common little preposi-
tion “of”? The usage of centuries has softened the
“f” to a “v” in our everyday speech (except where
the word is incorporated in “hereof,” “whereof,”
etc.), and as a rule there is so little vowel sound
as to almost permit of the consonant “v” doing duty
for the whole word. The Welsh are the only people
who pronounce “of” as it is really spelt, and the
Irish the oidy users of English who employ any
really extraneous vowel, making it “av.” In many
northern English dialects the word is mutilated
beyond recognition (or a totally different word sub-
stituted) as in the Yorkshireman’s “Coom out on
it!” For the rest, I contend that unless the “f” is
dropped, when the word is admirably represented
by the customary “o,” any mis-spelling of it to give
point to an utterance in the vernacular is unwar-
ranted, and not only fails in its object but robs a
sentence of its smoothness —-and vernacular is essen-
tially smooth-running. Edward Dyson’s “iv,” con-
stantly recurring throughout his stories and sketches
and certainly never used by anyone but his charac-
ters, is the worst example; but "uv,” “ov” and “erv”
are equally destructive to true vernacular represen-
tation.
“Nimshi”: Why all this blither about Joe Conrad?
\yhat wares does he exhibit in the shop-window to
elicit so much hysterical gush? Every would-be
highbrow on the bench of critics waxes almost tear-
ful in his reverential tributes to this dreary apolo-
gist of Failures. Thirty years ago, at my suggestion,
his “Outcast of the Islands” was procured for a
library of which I was a member, and since that
cruel disappointment 1 have struggled in turn, at
intervals of years, through “Almayer” (twice), “Nos-
tromo,” “Lord Jim” and “Victory”—hoping always,
hoping ever. All vanity and heavy sorrow. Perhaps
I have missed the “pea.” I certainly haven’t missed
the sound and fury, the weary reiterations of unin-
teresting psycho-analytic moonings, “the florid mental
gestures” ( vide 11. (I. Wells) of the most unmiti-
gated bore now prosing. Certainly he did master
English, as few of the natives do. But he can’t
narrate even when he has a yarn to tell.
The tales meander witii such a mazy
motion that if you open one of his works
at the middle yon are liable to find the beginning ;
likewise the end (or a version of it) in the first few
chapters. The heroes are generally fugitives, either
from justice or from injustice, and moonstruck
idiots in either case; while the recital of their woe-
ful self-comnmnings, together with the agonised
ruminations of their sympathisers, tends to make a
morass of sentiment where a mere puddle would be
slop enough. Furthermore, Conrad is absolutely humor- •
less, for that occasional wry grin of his only empha-
sises his disrelish of any intrusion of antic fancy.
Away with him. After Hardy, amongst the English
novelists, here is a vote for Eden Phillpotts, author
of “Sons of the Morning,” “The Mother,” etc. The
“austere splendor” of his work lingers in the
memory, and he remains the most vivid word-painter
since Blackmore.

VITAMITE! VITAMITE!!
You Ask, What is Vitamite?
We Answer the Question.
T r is a Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria, which, when
. P laced in the soil, increases by millions, supply-
ing the much-needed Nitrogen to plant life.
When the great American national increased-food-
production stunt was in full force, one of the Direc-
tors, A. S. Gould, F.R.H.S., publicly staked his
reputation on VIHAMITE, and won all along the line.
For the increased production of all plant life it
stands absolutely alone for Flowers, Vegetables
Fruit and Wheat. Give it a trial; if it doesn’t do
what we say, money returned.

“B.”: The Speck has been to the fore
in the woollen industry for many years.
Near Launceston the Waverley woollen
mills turn out top-quality stuff. Now
Kelsall and Kemp, Rochdale, Eng.,
are taking a hand, and are building
big woollen mills close to Launceston’s .new
wharves. The cost of the concrete buildings
is estimated, at £70,000, and a large portion
nli ca Pital has been locally subscribed.
Ihe latest machinery is already on the way.
latons and Baldwins, of Halifax, England,
and Allpwa, Scotland, are also building in
Launceston large spinning worsted mills. A
local firm is erecting buildings which will
cost £lOO,OOO. Cheap power, cool climate,
abundance* of water for wool cleansing, and
freedom from industrial disputes are some
of the firings that are attracting the big
people to the little island.

“Gnarek”: “Ship Rock” (B. 31/8/’22)
laments the neglect of Australian woods in
the manufacture of furniture. The woods
he mentioois as neglected, such as silkyoak
tulip wood and black-bean, are admittedly
seldom used, but mountain-ash and stringy-
bark, with the trade title, “Australian oak'”
are used in over 75 p.c. of the furniture pro-
duced in Victoria. Judiciously stained,
these timbers can be made to represent any
of the more expensive kinds, and properly
cut the grain has a striking simi-
larity to the English oak. Incidentally,
the white enamelled stuff and the “walnut
finish furniture is mostly made up of “white
Pine,” a Queensland product. Altogether
there seems no crying need for an associa-
tion to arise and boost what is already a
well-estaiblished industry.

Azac” : The N. S. Wales Department of
Agriculture (B. 3/8/’22) complains of the
unfairness of my statement that,' during the
year just closed, out of 100 Government pure-
bred cows tested, only 77 per cent, reached
the required standard, while out of the 540
privately-owned cows tested 85 per cent
reached tlte standard.. Their contention is
that the comparison is one-sided, since the
Government farms submit “all their stock”
for testing, whereas the private breeders only
submit tiheir best. I am quite unable to
square this with the fact that the Depart-
ment has* nearer 500 than 100 milch cows
(the number tested last year), and there is
no Government farm at which there are
exactly 100 milch cows. What, then, does
wu e r^ Hy .™ e i ln ? - Is not the ob J'ect of
herd-testing to determine the best cows and
weed out tfie others, and has not the Depart-
ment of Agriculture been practising herd-
testing long enough—it has been preaching
it long enough—to have already enabled its
farms to harve weeded out the worst milkers?
It is interesting to learn that the “taxpayer
does not pay for the maintenance of inferior
cows on Government farms,” and it would
appear to ‘.follow from this that the cows
weeded out in previous tests, having been
proved inferior, are no longer kept. But
if all tiie stock submitted for testing are
the Department's best, it is surely surprising
that onflv '77 per cent, should come up to
the standard as against the 85 per cent of
the private* owners’ best.
HE DID HIS DUTY.

And dropped an oath or two,
And said that lately he’d been had.
He swore that he would do
For one bald man with pigeon feet,
If he should meet him on the street.

And got a pack of swag
To yield a tidy bit of tin
If traded to the Snag.

What I do reg’lar business with.
“I’m makin’ fer the winder, when
This bald bloke interferes.
I draws me little pistol then,
He don’t care, it appears.
‘You’ll shoot perhaps,’ he sez, ‘but, oh,
I simply cannot let you go.’
“ ‘I can’t allow this sw'ag of truck
To be removed to-night!’
Gorstruth! it’s jest my bloomin’ luck,
I got to kill this skite
Or leave the blessed goods behind,
And I am not the killin’ kind.
“Sez I, ‘You better stand aside,
I’ll blow yer brains about!’
He still resisted, still denied,
And answers through his snout:
‘I can’t allow no goods to stir,
Me dooty it forbids it, sir.’
“Before I’ll kill him where he stands—
He’s hangin’ on so tight—
I drops me bundle, and I lands
All end up in the night.
I’m lucky too, a passin’ cop,
Just fails to catch me on the hop.
“I want to meet old Pigeon Toes.

And I have learned it’s true
He’s bin put in the house by Nat—

It is not the first cost, but the last cost, in Shearing Machinery that counts
most with the practiced sheepman. A thorough investigation will satisfy you
tihat “Lister” Machines, while costing no more in the first place than any
other British-built machine, will save you a great deal when it comes to
upkeep expenses. With “Lister” Machines your shearing is quicker and
better done, your repairs are less frequent and less costly, and the life of
your plant is indefinitely longer.

An 8-Point Lead for the Shear.
1. “Lister” Patent Self-levelling Taper Crown Plate—automatically
ensures level tension, requires no hammering or screwing in, as it
simply drops into its seat, and, being glass-hard, outwears ten old-style
crown plates. The princiDle of the “Lister” Crown Plate is sure to
be imitated, but only at the expense of simplicity.
2. “Lister” Patent Self-seating Long Bush for Main Spindle—first intro-
duced by the “Lister,” and still a better and simpler fitting than its
imitators, as, like the crown plate, it simply drops into its seat and is
held in place by screwing up the tail-piece sleeve (4). Obviously
much easier to fit than the old separate bushes, and ensures perfect
alignment. There is thus no danger of over-heating or wear on the
spindle.
3 “Lister” Designed Oil Recesses in Long Bush and Spindle—act as a
reservoir for oil for the whole of the spindle and prevent the over-
heating caused by some styles of long bush.
4. “Lister” Designed Renewable Tail-piece Sleeve —takes the wear of the
swivel half of the shear joint, and so makes the tail piece everlasting.
As it is simply screwed on, it can be renewed in the shed.
5- “Lister” Patent Adjustable Split Lid Bush with Lock Ring—a stronig,
hardened bush, which will outwear several old-style bushes and can
be adjusted to meet the variation in tension nuts. As a result, the
tension nut can be made hard, and lasts years longer. Also the
Expander and Stock and Die are no longer required in the tool kit.
6. “Lister” Designed Reinforced Spindle at Crank-head Screw.—Every
sheepman knows the weakness of the ordinary spindle where it is
threaded for the crank-head. The “Lister” Spindle, however, is
made much larger in diameter at this part, and 3.11 danger of breakage
is eliminated.
7. “Lister” Designed Oil-returning Grooves on Main Spindle.—These'
grooves on the spindle prevent leakage of oil from shear body.
8. “Lister” Designed Adjusting Screw for Shear Joint.—While the shear
joint is still of the well-known screwless pattern, this screw has been
added to the “Lister” Joint, so that any side play due to wear can be
taken up quickly and simply without the use of washers.
The introduction of Patents No. 1 and No. 5 alone did away with the need for 9 tools in the expert's tool kit.
The distinctive “Lister” features illustrated above have put the “Lister” Shear so far ahead that hundreds of machines of
other makes are sent in to us every year to have “Lister” Patents incorporated. Other additional “Lister” features, such
as the unbreakable Tube Spring and the practice of sending out Combs “done-up” ready for use, are explained in detail
in a booklet entitled “Saving £5 on Your Handpieces Alone.” Let us send you a copy and quote for a suitable “Lister”
installation.

On-Sept. 2, near Scone (N.S.W.), John
and Thomas Barwick, twins, celebrated their
80th birthday. They were inseparable in
their youth, and about 56 years ago took up
adjoining selections in the Scone (N.S.W.)
district. They built their homes about 400
yards apart, and have lived there ever since.
The new Coadjutor-Archbishop of Sydney,
Dr. Sheehan, who, so the cables say, has
just had a yarn with the Pope, will be the
fifth R.C. Archbish. of Sydney. The first two,
Polding and Vaughan, were English, and the
other three, Moran, Kelly and Sheehan, Irish.
“Malua” : Judging by the capacity of the
new oil-tanks being erected by the Yanks
at Tutuila (American Samoa) the U.S. Gov-
ernment has lost no time in concluding that
a large oil-reserve in the Pacific will be essen-
tial later on. This, on top of the Washing-
ton Conference, makes one wonder if that
meeting of diplomats was eyewash, and
Hughes’s famous speech the biggest bluff in
modern history. Tutuila is essentially a
naval station.
“Randolph Rentless”: Australia’s next
Christmas dinner is likely to consist of more
beef than usual and less poultry. A
new export trade has been discovered, and
every kind of bird served with stuffing is
being rushed to the freezing-works. In the
Young district (N.S.W.) alone 3000 turkeys
have passed over in nine weeks; and buyers
for the prospective overseas market are pre-
pared to take all that come along. Unless
turkey-raising gets a tremendous impetus
from the outside demand, the outlook ahead
is gloomy for householders who love to plunge
a knife into the fare that Uncle Sam devours
with cranberry sauce.

If John Mathew, of Coburg (Vic.), the
new Scotchbyterian Moderator-General,
doesn’t want to be a mere office-warmer he
will have to do some more vigorous thinking
than he exhibited at his installation. The
only “remedy” he could suggest for the evils
of mammon, luxury, selfishness and fallaci-
cious doctrines of government rampant was
that Vic. Protestants should force the Bible
into the State schools—in other words,
oblige the already overworked 4000 women
and 2500 men who give secular instruction
to take on, as an unpaid side-line, a big
lump of the work supposed to be done by
the shepherds. Grandmaster Snowball’s
motion favoring lessons from the Book to
pupils whose parents don’t object is listed
for discussion in the Vic. Legislative
Assembly to-day (Sept. 14). But as it
hasn’t a ghost of a chance of passing, he
proposes to defer it.
The rich young Chinese man-about-town
(mostly the son of a fond millionaire father)
in the East is always ready to swank heavily
over the white business man, or planter,
whose income the Celestial youth regards as
beggarly. One day a Sydney man in charge
of an engineering job in Malacca walked
into the village cobbler’s shop and ordered a
pair of tennis shoes, to the soles of which he
instructed the shoe-architect to attach a
layer cut from a worn-out Ford tyre. He
illustrated what he meant on paper, and
then produced the tyre. Lounging in the
shop was a magnificent Chinese youth, turned
out in Bond-street’s last word from head to
heel. He looked superciliously at the some-
what shabby Australian, walked to the door
of the shoo where his own Rolls Royce was
breathing opulence, and beckoned the uni-
formed chauffeur. Some short sharp orders
and the chariot left in a hurry. Just as
the mere white man was about to depart the
driver dashed into the shop with a mammoth
tyre. “There,” said the magnificent youth.
“I. too, will have tennis shoes—but cut my
soles from this!” This was worth some £l5.
“Atherton” : A timber that deserves more
attention than it gets from cabinet-makers
and house-furnishers is the Atherton (or
Queensland) red oak. It has a texture very
similar to Queensland maple, but when pol-
ished up looks twice as well. The difficulty
is, however, that it grows only in Northern
Queensland, whence it is difficult to obtain
small supplies. Some beautiful samples were
exhibited in Sydney last year by the Queens-
land Government Tourist Agency, but when
I inquired after some to make a few con-
traptions at home I couldn’t find any in
Sydney. The Agency would supply a ship-
load but no less, and that at about six
months’ notice. Meanwhile, huge quantities
of this magnificent timber are being destroyed
by settlers, who must remove it from their
holdings but are unable to sell it.
“Dido” : At Colombo, Mrs. Brown’s select
boarding-house, St. Kilda, they came to the
conclusion that that nice Mr. Grieve was a
pianist, because of the extraordinary care he
bestowed on his hands. He wore gloves
about the house even, and his fingers were
manicured with the very nicest precision. He
had exercises for keeping the digits pliable,
and was continually putting his hands
through a form of drill. Grieve did not
deny that he was a pianist, hut no persuasion
could get him to the piano. He said one had
altogether too much of that sort of thing:
besides, Mrs. Brown’s piano was not an
instrument a professional gentleman could
afford to associate with. It was assumed
that Mr. Grieve had rooms at one of the
musical warehouses in town, and he spent
much of his time there with his pupils, we
imagined. Meanwhile the hands were a
source of ardent female admiration, and
Grieve confessed that he had them insured
for a good sum. Then the wretched man
went and spoiled it all by getting ttvo years
for picking pockets.

SFlatulence
The regular use of ENO’s “Fruit Salt” not
only removes the causes of these digestive ail-
ments, but greatly minimises their recurrence.
For the treatment of flatulence, always allow the
effervescence of ENO to subside before drinking.
The action of ENO is gentle but effective —and
even with its repeated use there is no “lowering”
effect. Ask your chemist for a bottle to-day!

‘Coot”: The feverish activities of the
jerry-builder are discouraged in Port Mel-
bourne. So, for that matter, is every other
sort of builder. During the last eight years
only seven houses have been erected in that
neck of the woods.
Thomas J. Dunn, who went out at Mosman
(Sydney) last week, was a grandson of a
captain of the Royal Irish Foot who came
to Australia in 1808 and was made Chief
Constable of Sydney. He was a Glebe aider-
man for 38 years, and the Town Hall bears
his name as Mayor at the time it was opened.
“D.F.”: There were Chinese in Australia
long before the diggings attracted them, and
even before the one or two rather half-
hearted attempts to introduce them as
shepherds. Cunningham, writing in 1826,
mentions that there were already sev-
eral of them in N.S.W., and speaks in par-
ticular of one John Shan, who had settled
at Parramatta as a carpenter and a dealer
in tea and groceries. Shan seems to have
been there some time, as he had an English
wife and a family of half-caste children.
“Morehead”: The Smiths have not made
much of a splash in N.S.W. politics. In
the 66 years of Responsible Government,
three of the eight that have graced the
Upper Chamber are also included in the 12
that have sat in the Assembly, making alto-
gether a total of 17. Bruce Smith (later
M.11.R. for Parkes), who was Sec. for Public
Works for a while and Colonial Treasurer
for two months, was about the best known.
The only other to hold a portfolio was Syd-
ney Smith (also, later, an M.11.R.), who
was Sec. for Mines twice. At present none
of the plebeian clan is an M.L.A., though
three (T.J., Joynton and Fergus Jago) are
M’s.L.C. It says something for the democ-
racy of the State that not one Smythe has
ever been put into Parliament.
“J.11.' (London) on one of the mipor
horrors of war :
This old country will stand anything. A Labor
M.P. forced the admission from Sir Robert Horne,
in the House of Commons a day or two ago, that
various collaterals of Nelson have been drawing
£5OOO a year for 116 years from the British tax-
payers’ pockets. None of these limpets, of course,
had anything to do with Nelson’s victories or his
services. The people he did ask a grateful country
to look after—Lady Hamilton and his daughter
Horatia—were callously neglected; but his brother
and two sisters had a grant made to them of £lO,OOO
each. The brother was the Rev. William Nelson,
and this parson was created an Earl, given £90,000
to buy an estate, and granted a perpetual pension
of £5OOO a year in order to maintain the dignity
of the Nelson family. There have been altogether
four earls engaged in bleeding the British taxpayer
since Nelson died, and they have drawn a cool half-
million between them.
“Gallery”: Burchell, M.H.R, for Fre-
mantle, will probably not stand at the next
elections. Having acquired business inter-
ests in Victoria, he has lost touch with the
West. There is also a story that he re-
sented the loss of the Whip’s billet to the
bustling Marr. Burchell’s successor, if he
retires, may be James Cornell,, a former
union secretary, who has done a power of
work for the Westralian Diggers, and is in-
variably their spokesman at R.S.L. confer-
ences. The only thing against Cornell is
that he is an M.L.C.
Intensely relieved were the Libs, in Vic.
Assembly when they heard that Lawson was
going to stick to the Premiership as long as
he is wanted. Lawson ihas managed to keep
the four sections of the party together, to
prevent Labor and the F.U. forming an alli-
ance, and to pull well with the Uppah Cham-
bah. Peacock was the only alternative if
Lawson had succumbed to the Federal
temptation. McPherson—excellent purse-
minder as he is—has no fancy for the art
of holding a party together, and playing off
one group against another.
310”: Moncton would have his readers
believe that his departure removed from
New Guinea its only really important offi-
cial. As a matter of fact, much better work
is being done to-day under Governor Mur-
ray by a smaller staff of natrol-officers and
fewer native police. Under the present
regime swindling and ill-treatment of natives
are practically impossible, while the patrol
officer who would indulge in the slaughter
of natives, as frequently recounted by
Moncton, would last about as long as it took
the survivors to wireless the news to lI.E. If
the present-day patrol-officer cannot find tribes
of dwarf and webfooted Papuans, not to
mention weird animals never before or since
seen by whites or natives, he can at least
hold down more jobs than any other class of
official known to the writer; and they're
not extravagantly-paid jobs, either.
IH. T. Dunn, one of the oldest printers in
Sydney, who went west last week, at 70
was born at Solitary Creek, now Rydal, and
served his apprenticeship with the old-time
firm, Reading and Wellbank, of Bridge-
street. In 1885 he founded the firm of
H. T. Dunn and Co., now of Reiby-lane.
“Stellsby”: “No memorial exists for the
man who founded Melbourne” (B. 7/9/’22).
Fawkner Park, one of the seven wonders of
Melbourne, may be credited to a vindication
account. Add Fawkner-street, St. Kilda;
ditto, South Varra, and you have the famous
pioneer’s name immortalised. God’s Acre
at Fawkner may also be included —greater
memorial than this hath no man.
“Centurion”: As to the crudity or other-
wise of South African wines, as compared
with the Australian (“11.K.R.,” B. 31/8/’22),
it depends on the particular brew you get
hold of. All round Constantia and the Paarl,
a few miles from Capetown, lie dozens of
beautiful vineyards, some of them close on
200 years old, flanked by wonderful old
Dutch cellar-houses. The best wine that
comes out of these vineyards is as good as
our best, while the worst is not deadlier
than some of the stuff you can get in
Sydney and Melbourne wine bars. A hun-
dred years ago, Constantia sherry and
Madeira were widely drunk in England.
There are irreproachable wines of the still-
hock types, and the brandy is excellent. <T
mean the genuine grape brandy, not “Dop”.)
There is one brandy, distilled from muscatel
grapes only, which has no counterpart in
Australia that I know of, and has helped
many a man to a bilious headache. Gener-
“he South African wine-making
methods, like those of their stock-raisers,
were old fashioned and conservative, but
they are waking up in both departments
nowadays.

oA Player-Piano can ensure their positive success .
A PLAYER- PIANO makes the unexpected arrival of
friends doubly enjoyable. Those who sing are relieved
of the embarrassment of well-intended but inadequately-
trained accompanists.
For the player-piano provides a faultless technique which,
when subject to such interpretive controls as the New Beale
possesses, ensures a perfect, artistic performance. Both singer
and accompanist are thoroughly at ease, and the technique
of the music is entirely lost in the spirit of interpretation.
You can possess a Beale Player-Piano for a small cash deposit
—the balance spread over one, two, three or even four years.

"Yorbell”: The incorrigible Tommy Cos-
grove has had a variegated stage experience,
ranging from pantomime —he was clown in
the harlequinade at Her Majesty s, Sydney,
one year—to Shakspeare. George Rignold
cast him for Fluellen in ‘‘Henry \ . at the
same theatre. But Tommy’s long suit is
‘‘Hamlet,” and he knows all about it, having
played Young Osric with Alfred Dam pier,
and First Gravedigger with W alter Bentley.
Tommy’s methods are unusual. I once saw
him do “Hamlet” as a songandauc-e turn.
His costume was an outrage on Elsinore,
but he kept pretty close to the text, to a
popular tune, thus: —
One day when I was sleepin’ in mine orchard,
(Ma custom always in the afternoon),
Your uncle came along with juice of Lebenon,
An’ poured it in ma ear, the saucy coon!
An’ then he went an’ pinched ma queen, ma baby.
An’ then he tried to steal away ma crown.
So, Hamlet, if you meet him in the corridor,
Just get a club an’ knock the blighter do« n !
Farewell Hamlet, you’ll remember me!
( Tum-tiddly-um-tum, tiddly-umpty-tee!)
All I want is a tanner for ma tea.
(Break as before.)
There was a good deal more of it, and Foots-
cray thoroughly enjoyed it.

“Cairo” is described as a mosaic in music
and mime. Indubitably it is an eye-opener
that might drive a bewildered critic to worse
alliterative feats.
0 amorous, alluring, archaic
Play-pageant of passion and crime,
Pale pilgrims in habit Hebraic,
Lithe limbs that are Jit by the lime,
Mad, mazy, mysterious mosaic
In music and mime.
Yet, it is more pantomime than play; and
the plot in its lack of verisimilitude is essen-
tially pantomime. There is a faint flavor
of the Elizabethan about the diction—mostly
blank verse with an occasional clinching
rhyme at the end of a speech—but it is not
the sort of verse that would have passed
muster in the Mermaid Tavern until Shaks-
peare and Ben Jonson had reached for their
hats and gone, and the poetasters had closed
up and somebody had dropped hashish into
the beer. Most of the dialogue is cheap
stuff, and the songs are pure doggerel. The
acting, with half-a-dozen exceptions at most,
amounts to little enough. The appeal of
“Cairo” is almost entirely to the eye. Sel-
dom, surely, were Eastern scenes —gorgeous
or sombre —depicted with such rare and
speaking art and stagecraft. The costumes
worn are in themselves a marvel of quaint
variety, and, there is no reason to doubt,
painstaking fidelity. There are gorgeous
panoramas of colors, and there are paste-
board pictures, as of mosques under the
moonlight, that grip by their very simplicity.
Spectacularly, “Cairo” is a triumph of the
'L.signer’s and producer’s art.
One leaves it with a generous assortment
of impressions, running into one another,
of Eastern city scenes, palaces and temples
and noisy bazaars and hushed seraglios, of
hot sands shimmering in the desert and
cool, green, palm-girt oases in the moonlight,
of sultans and pilgrims and wrestlers and
dancing-girls, and much the same assorted
tides of humanity as those around which the
Arabian Nights were written a thousand
years ago. The plot doesn’t matter, or the
words ; it is the changing pictures, the marvel-
lous stage illusions, that count. That and the
co-called “Bacchanalian” scene —a fine study
in whirling abandonment of mostly feminine
limbs coming eventually to rest in a pant-
ing, gleaming pattern, like a huge piece of
human lacework. One wonders what Oscar
Asche could make of a certain scene of
mythological abandonment that Keats has
made immortal. It should be right into his
hands.
* * * •
As Ali Shar, the strong man from Persia,
Asche cuts himself indelibly into the memory.
He is the epitome of boisterous force and
assertiveness that tramples through, after
the vicissitudes necessary to the plot. Edith
Drayson, as Zummurud, Ali’s daughter and
a sort of beggar-maid, as it were, to the
Sultan’s Cophetua, achieves a real success.
Her father’s hugeness and her lover’s height
make her look more dainty than ever in
her Miminutiveness; and her singing voice is
sweet and clear. Gladys Mason, as Sharazad,
is a queenly figure, as she needs to be
to set off those majestic trains. Wensley
Russell, as Ali’s clown, is excellent. Richard
Hatteras is a trifle diffident or nervous for
an Oriental sultan ; no potentate can avoid
hauteur of an exaggerated description with
foreheads perpetually banging on the floor
at his feet. Cecil Humphreys, as the wicked
pretender to the throne, is more effective.
Beaumont Collins plays Zarka, the house-
keeper, with spirit, not to say unction.
Mason Wood and Jessie Page, as the Chinese
spy and his wife, are doubtless admirable,
but the characters themselves are a little
irritating in their Mongolian squeakiness. It
goes without saying that “Cairo” will de-
light thousands. The first-night audience
was more profundly appreciative than tumul-
tuously enthusiastic.

Rosina Buckman and Maurice D’Oisly
more than fulfilled Sydney’s expectations last
Saturday at the Town Hall. Rosina’s fine,
clear soprano has the dew of youth still upon
it. She sings with fire and enthusiasm when
those qualities are called for, and her clear
enunciation even stood the test of Mourssorg-
sky’s whimsical “Evening Prayer.” Her first
introduction to her Saturday’s audience was
in the appealing “One Fine Day,” from
“Madame Butterfly,” and from the opening
line she had found her old place in the affec-
tions of the public. Four bracketed songs
that ended with Walter Morse Rummel’s
“Ecstasy” evoked a double encore apiece. Her
encores included Musetta’s aria from
“Boh&me,” “Cornin’ Thro’ The Rye,” and
Alfred Hill’s stirring “Waiata Poi!” much
to the delight of himself and his small wife,
who were front-seaters and frequent applaud-
ers. Her last number on the programme
was a love duet from “Madame Butterfly”
with D’Oisly. Sydney agrees with Melbourne
that D’Oisly appears even to better advan-
tage as a concert singer than as an
operatic artist; and his four French songs
on the opening night of the season were
delivered with delicate charm and impeccable
accent. Percy Kahn, at the piano, renewed
acquaintance with a public who last heard
him scintillate in conjunction with Mischa
Elman; and Adelina Leon’s ’cello sang with
a marked rise in its normal temperature.
** * *
At Sydney Criterion Laurence Grossmith
continues ta play Ambrose Applejohn with
quiet humor and Captain Applejack with
lurid force. Meanwhile, Diana Wilson,
whether as Russian or Portuguese, or merely
as a British burglar’s accomplice, recalls an-
other line, beyond those quoted in the play,
from Stevenson’s pirate ballad, viz.: “By
God, she was stuff for a plucky jade, Yo-
ho-ho and a bottle of rum.”
** * *
“Nobody Loves Me,” Wee Georgie Wood’s
latest playlet, at the Sydney Tivoli, is going
to make him patron saint of every broom-
stick warrior in the State. Dolly Harmer,
his widowed ma in previous sketches, ap-
pears in this as the better half of an un-
couth plumber. In the uniform of a Boy
Scout, the chubby-kneed, smooth-faced little
star scores every imaginable point, and a
few over. So far, this turn is easily his
best. Zoha D’Arcy contributes acceptable
extracts from grand opera and simple Eng-
lish ballads; Maggie Foster radiates melody
by means of a violin, and Madeline Rossiter
is still going strong.

Sydney’s boom film this week is. “The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse” at the Cry-
stal Palace, with Rudolph Valentino as Julie
Desnoyers. “North of the Rio Grande,” at
the Lyceum, is a cow-punching epic, and
“The Magic Cup” (which flad nothing to
do with the “claret cup” of the Artists’ Ball)
is the chaser. At the Rialto, Hobart Bos-
worth may be seen in a U.S. clink. “Why
Girls Leave Home” has shifted quarters,
and the answer is now to be found at the
Empress. Jackie Coogan is at the Hay-
market in “Trouble.” Phil Smith, is also
at this house in a musical act. Hoyt’s rests
its faith on “The Bishop’s Emeralds,” and
Shirley Mason, in “Lights of the Desert.”

Local industry is busy harnessing pictorial
entertainment and dramatic representation,
so to speak, into its car. In other words, the
N.S.W. Chamber of Manufactures is staging
an “All Australian Exhibition” on the Royal
Agricultural Show Ground, from October 7
to November 18. Besides the display of manu-
facturing processes there will be free cinema
shows, vocal and instrumental music com-
petitions for substantial prizes, and war
trophies galore to view. Hours: 12 till 5,
and 7 till 10.

MAJESTY'S.

well.” “The Great Lover” was worth do-
ing better in three or four places that matter
to the story, whereas in characters outside
of the plot some capital work is achieved by
Mervale, John Bedouin, Leslie Victor,
George Blunt, and a tall Italian gentleman
who talks always in his own native lan-
guage or makes any other language sound
like it. He and Gaston Mervale may be
said to. help waft a behind-the-scenes atmo-
sphere into the front of the house. But the
two tall men with alien operatic manners
and accents are but trimmings on the play.
They have nothing to do with the fit of it.
The characters that Marjorie Bennett and
Lou \ ernon misrepresent are essential to
the life of the stage story, whilst the pale
memory of the past which Gwen Burroughs
briefly stands and talks for, as though she
were an animated vindictive ghost, rather
than a mother pleading for her boy, is also
of some importance. Furthermore, the dress-
ing might as well be consistent. From the
red gown of the raging Sabattini, in the
first scene, you gather that the story dates
back to days when “Don Giovanni” was still
a popular opera, but from the clothing of
Miss Bennett, as Ethel Warren, you learn
that Ethel Warren, the young lyric soprano,
couldn’t have been born till long after “Gio-
vanni” dropped out
of date. All these
weaknesses the
performance should
have guarded
against. Marjorie
Bennett, in parti-
cular, is conspicu-
ously unequal to
her task in every
respect, and Lou
Vernon lacks the
attractive person-
ality of the Carlo
Sonino—the “dear
boy”—indicated by
the text. All the
sympathy of those
who can appreciate
the truth of the
main character
study is monopol-
ised by Bennison
in the name-part.
The faults of Jean

gives him much, excusing even his weird
Americanised accent on the ground that he
is said to speak eight languages imperfectly,
has presumably learned his English in
America, and has, for some inexplicable rea-
son, travelled with an American valet all
liis professional life. The fact that his valet
doesn’t happen to talk with a twang need
not be advanced against the theory afore-
said.
* * * *
At Melbourne Tivoli two turns of import-
ance came to hand from a long sea voyage
on Saturday. One was a concert party of
Arthur Agent, baritone; and Edith Page,
whose clever piano-solo might sound soulful
on a richer-toned and more tuneful instru-
three, consisting of Ethel Hook, contralto:
ment. The songstress is Clara Butt’s sister,
and she looks every inch the part. Also, she
has much of Clara Butt in her clear frank
voice and honest enunciation, though she
wants some of the depth and width of her
sister’s low notes, and is, in fact, a mezzo
rather than a contralto. But her appear-
ance ! Ethel Hook is divinely tall, delight-
fully proportioned and noised (to use the
latest term) and engagingly countenanced.
Not too much of a goddess to be called win-
some. The turn concluded on Saturday with
“The Keys of Heaven Duet,” wherein the
baritone introduced the same dramatic ges-
tures, or thereabouts, that Maurice D’Oisly
uses when he sings it with Rosina Buck-
man, which theatrical touch is as improving
as a drop of James Hennessey in a cup of
tea. The other new turn is Gene Gerrard, a
young comedian who shows great orieinality
on old lines. The refined “drunk” has
almost been done to death, but Gerrard,
with an assistant to play the policeman,
restores the exhausted figure and commends
it to new favor.
#* * *
“The Lie,” at Melbourne King’s, continues
to prove a lucky thing for several people.
Marie Ney, by telling an almost pardonable
untruth, secures a rich husband who will
give her illicit offspring a good start in life
after making her father happy for the sake
of the other- daughter who is living with
him. Frank Harvey gets the pleasure of
capturing the Good sister after discovering
what a self-sacrificing person she really is,
whilst Emelie Poloni, the Good sis. in ques-
tion, gets a promising young man for a hus-
band. Come to think of it, every member
of the cast (with the exception of‘the dress-
maker) benefits by “The Lie.” There is
nothing for Emelie Polini to get so mad
about. Instead of winning the tepid capi-
talist outright she becomes his wife’s sister,
with whom, as a cynical Frenchman once
remarked, every Englishman appears to be
in love. There is but another fortnight left
for the present season. On October 7 comes
*•’ v
“The Sentimental Bloke” to the King’s.
At Melbourne Majesty’s the painful ques-
tion as to why a lady and a vicomte went
mto a “nasty stuffy summer-house,” and
the further question as to whether the lady
was more kissed against than kissing when
she got there, are being repeated to large
audiences eight times a week. Nor is the
wile of “The Merry Widow” likely to slacken
fire during the coming Show Week.
Melbourne’s Pioneer Players change their
bill at the Temperance Hall this Thursday.
Vance Palmer is the new author this time,
his comedy of Australian life coming up for
judgment under the title of “The Happy
Family.”
#* * *
“Pagan Love” is making little appeal to
White Australian sentiment at Hoyt’s, Mel-
bourne, this week. It repeats the motif of
blameless Chinese affection for a sweet
white girl, but reeks with false pathos. “The
Killer,” on the same sheet, affords a divert-
ing symposium of dead-shot attitudes on the
part of a miscreant who has a refined weak-
ness for Chopin and hair-oil. Peace breaks
out occasionally in “Headin’ West,” starring
Hoot Gibson, and there is much bogus
slaughter inflicted with Boz. gloves in the
sixth instalment of “The Leather Pushers.”
“Madame X,” with Pauline Frederick as the
unknown quantity, is the best film screened
at the Majestic for months. The play is not
over melodramatically handled, and Pauline
nets her part with commendable restraint.
The follow-on is a stoush and racing drama,
The Sport of Kings,” with an agreeable
English setting. “The Prodigal Judge” is
the Britannia’s main suit, and the Melba
provides a feast of scrambled legs in a
Parisian thriller, “The Green Temptation.”
>;= *!; >[:
John Shirlow’s latest exhibition at the
Decoration Gallery, Melbourne, includes
several efforts in water-color and oil that
will bring him no kudos among his brother
artists. His portraits are almost equally
crude and unsatisfying, except, perhaps, in
the case of the picture of Raymond Wallis.
A pastoral symphony isn’t soothing, and
there is a night effect of a paper-mill that
invites derision. “A Hillside, Sassa-
fras,” is subdued to a sombre mulligatawny
tone and has a disagreeable flatness as well.
The etchings, in which the artist is more
at home, are also rather dispiriting on the
whole. The best is a section of a well-
known pub seen from a narrow angle in
Flinders-lane. Another good one reveals a
vista of tall buildings in the same thorough-
fare, in which the difficult perspective is
consummately handled. “The Pool, River
Yarra,” fails through the economy of line
in the foreground. “The Stock Exchange,
Collins-street,” is generally poor in quality,
and two or three others haven’t the charm
of execution which is the chief appeal in the
etcher’s art.
** * *
Adelaide has rallied round Hans Heysen’s
show at the. Society of Arts rooms. His
splendid fruit-and-flower pieces came as a
pleasant shock to those who hadn’t seen the
picture Sydney bought last year. Then there
are the drab, harrow scenes, under Millet
influence apparently, including “Toilers,”
which won the Wynne prize; and sheep
under drought and other conditions; and
cliffs on the Murray; and turkeys curiously
mingled with young gums, whose trunks show
color almost as vivid as theirs. Melba gave
the show a start by buying a fruit-piece in
oils, and a “Pastoral” in charcoal. The
prices are high, and the sales are said to
have broken already all Australian records,
not merely for a one-man show, but for an
exhibition of any kind.
** * *
In Adelaide during the September Agri-
cultural Show Week, Louis Bennison gave
a quick change from his Caruso-like “Great
Lover” to Johnny of the Gun; and he
threw in, one evening, an extempore denun-
ciation of his countryman “Pussyfoot”
Johnson. Since then Maude Fane, Frith
and eo. have been crowding the theatre right
to the back wall with “A Night Out.” Her-
bert Myers, who is both owner and William-
sonian manager, has an easy seat these
times; the population of Adelaide is increas-
ing rapidly, while there is still only one
Royal. Althouse and Middleton have hardly
had the audiences they deserve at the Town
Hall, but the applause has been terrific
from those who did turn up. The King’s
continues to score with melodrama, and at
the re-opened Majestic Harry Thurston and
Dorothy Lena have been the big lines in
a variety co. which is strong all round. In
pictures, the York scores with a combina-
tion of Mary Pickford and Jackie Coogan.
The Pav. has the powerful “Way Down
East.” The bill at West’s. Wondergraph
and the Grand has been of the sort one
doesn’t remember afterwards, but which
gives great pleasure at the moment.

“Blackfriars”: Alfred Bellew, stage direc-
tor with Oscar Asche, acquired most of his
theatre knowledge when providing boy
choristers for BeerboLm Tree productions
and others of the kind. Whenever boys’
voices were required, recourse was had a de-
cade ago to Bellew and Stock’s vocal fac-
tory, and it was also a prolific source for
church supplies of cherubim. Church and
stage again.
“T. 0.1.”: “King John” (B. 31/8/’22) was
first played in Sydney at the Victoria
Theatre, Pitt-street (now covered by
McCathies’), on June G, 1842. The King
was impersonated by Nesbitt McCron.
Knowles, for whose benefit the play was
produced, was Faulconbridge, and his wife
Arthur. When Barry Sullivan produced the
play in Melbourne he took the part of Faul-
conbridge.
“Second Murderer”: “0.K.” credits the
late George It. Sims with the authorship of
“a play called ‘Esther Sandraz,’ produced
here by the ill-fated Amy Roselle” (B.
14/9/’22). Arthur Dacre and Amy Roselle
did “Esther Sandraz” here in 1895. but on
the programme they called it “Sydney
Grundy’s powerful play, adapted from Adolp.i
Belot’s ‘La Femme de Glac6,’ as produced by
them at the Prince of Wales’s Theatre, Lon-
don.”
“Abbott Park” : Dredged-up in a Melbourne
second-hand bookstall recently was a pocket-
size copy of J. S. Knowles’s “Virginius,”
with the name “G. V. Brooke” on the cover
in gold lettering. Inside, there are numer-
ous directions, cuts and so forth in a hand-
writing that was the tragedian’s, no doubt.
One would like to trace the history of the
little olaybook since the waters of the
Atlantic closed over Brooke’s noble head.
“Cassowary”: The Firm misses few
chances of adding to its revenue. Thus, the
main ground-floor entrance to Melb. Theatre
Royal is now the address of a portable to-
bacco kiosk—it is ported when the evening
entertainment begins. At the reserved-stalls
entrance a shine parlor of the approved
American pattern is plying for business
among the racing gents, who are always
hanging around. Still, it hasn’t been noticed
yet, except by me, that the long walk to the
reserVed-stalfs entrance would make a great
shooting-gallery. Also, the rather forlorn d.c.
foyer could be brisked up a bit, to say no-
thing of the profits, by a few try-your-weight
and ball-punching machines.
“Gnarek”: Although several London
dailies credited Lord Astor with having
saved the old Vic. (B. 31/8/’22), it tran-
spires that the money was given by George
Dance. Seemingly “R.D.” hasn’t much use
for Astor. Still, that Anglo-American peer
turned all his residences into hospitals dur-
ing the Avar, and staffed and equipped them
at his own expense. Those Diggers who
were lucky enough to convalesce in his Avon-
derful mansion at Cliveden Reach, on the
Thames, wouldn’t begrudge the man a duke-
dom.
“T.W.” : “Orb” cannot get away with the
goods so easily on behalf of Allan Wilkie
as a Shakspearean record-breaker. What-
ever Frank Benson may be doing uoav. it was
“Benson’s Shakspearean Company” that for
nearly a score of years produced nothing else
but the bard, and it was always called upon
to form the nucleus of the big festivals at
Stratford. Oscar Asche was with Benson
in the times when it was the ambition of
every struggling mummer worth his salt to
put in a year or two in that fine school of
Shakspeare and nothing else. "Orb” also
seems to have lost sight of another unshake-
able Shakspearean, Ben Greet.
“Stargazer”: O. Asche does not say that
he wants an Australian play; what he hints
at is a play by an Australian. Unless an
author founded a sort of pantomimic fantasy
on the Federal capital, casting his drama in
the future, and allowing his fancy the liber-
ties a rabid Canbeeraite in Sydney politics
extends to his mind when expatiating on the
future glories of the over-Fed capital, no
Australian writer could find here a theme
of Baby lonic grandeur satisfactory' to the
florid ideals of Oscar. The Australian play
may be a comedy of town or country man-
ners, or it may be four acts of the wilder
life; it could hardly be a “Chu Chin Chow”
or a “Cairo.” I would advise the local
aspirant to take to some theme adapted to
Mr. Asche’s advertised dimensions. For my
part, I am building- him a play around Moses,
with the crossing of Egypt’s dark sea by
the hosts of Pharaoh as a striking tableau
for the third act.
“Machete”: London’s Grand Guignol,
which goes in for realistic playlets, has been
closed by the Lord Chamberlain. Why, it
is hard to say. In one of the latest produc-
tions, a little girl, irritated at the antics
of an idiot brother, puts his head in a bag
and drowns him in a pond. In another, a
great surgeon has discovered a method of
heart massage which revives the apparently
dead. He is looking for a suitable subject
for a demonstration when his own daughter
is carried in by her dead from syn-
cope, after a motor smash. Enlisting the
young man’s services as assistant—he is a
surgeon too —the good doctor gets busy on
the job at once, in full view of the audience.
Blood from an artery splashes into his eyes,
and while he stops to wipe it out the. revived
corpse grabs him by the throat and strangles
him. Then she dies all over again. A really
strong curtain, and one which makes me
regret that Dan Barry was born 30 years
too soon.
“T.W.”: Ethel Hook, now doing the Mus-
grove circuit as contralto balladist, suffered
for years under an edict from big sister
Clara Butt that she must on no account tell
the public that the Voice was a family affair.
Clara was good enough to allow her sisters
Pauline and Ethel to sing as duettists at the
Boosey ballad concerts, in which the large
Dame was the most resplendent among many
stars, but the relationship was maintained a
dark secret. Pauline’s rather shaky soprano
dropped out, and Ethel found a more pro-
pitious job for her beautiful voice and grace-
ful figure on Stoll’s halls, where she could
no longer be overawed by Clara.
“CAIRO," AT SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Wensley Russell as Abu, the clown.
"G.K.’s” final detonation :
In reply to the person who calls himself (or her-
self) “K. 0.” (B. 7/9/’22), I repeat that Madame
Wiedemann never had a beautiful voice. I heard
her in a German comic opera in Melbourne when
she was quite a young woman, not more than a year
or two retired from the German stage, and can swear
that she wasn’t even a charming singer, as the
tern is understood in Australia. Moreover, members
of the Deutscher Turn Verein, speaking from recol-
lection of Miss Wiedermann on the German stage,
assured me that she never had a voice of much
consequence. As to her having “appeared in every
German theatre of note, with a visit to Covent Garden
thrown in,” the same might be said of scores of
operatic German singers, who never sang beautifully
in their lives. The lady may have been a member
of a company that played in Covent Garden theatre.
She certainly was no star. And to say that her hands
were capable” is to misrepresent the truth. As a
teacher Madame Wiedemann was a calamitous failure.
i the 1000 or more promising young voices that
underwent her tuition, how many have achieved fame,
how many were ruined? Marshall Hall, who was
obsessed with German philosophy and German music,
was hand in glove with the Pinschois when they were
posing as “der grade padrons of moosik” in Melbourne.
e , p. to teach at his Conservatorium,
id a bad day it was for many fresh young voices
when they came her way. I hark hack as far as
the time of Nora Dane and Lovie Mueller, both of
whom were declared to have been charming singers
before Madame Wiedermann taught them to mimic
her guttural rendering of “Ich grolle nicht,” or
Heaven knows what. They groaned and gutturaled
un..il it was practically impossible to tell what
language they were trying to sing. 1 have sat in
the front row at Melbourne Athenaeum Hall, and
thought that Nora Dane was delivering a German
dirge . in German when she was actually
wrestling with an Irish ditty. The slaughter
of Conservatorium voices by Madame Wieder-
mann at that time was a matter of common
talk among all people interested in singing,
outside the German cult It was a scandal. As a
good Australian I protested against the Germanising
of the Conservatorium before the war, and I still
protest that Madame Wiedermann was a calamitous
personage in her official capacity. Privately, the
lady was a very good sort. But I object to anyone
untruthfully contradicting a paragraph that I
wrote with no worse object in view than the pre-
\ention, if possible, of any further appointments of
third-rate ex-opera singers, and foreigners at that,
to positions on University teaching staffs.
“Orfa” : “Gnarek” (B. 14/9/’22) i a as
reckless m his mis-statements as he is in his
choice of adjectives. If Benson told the
literary Diggers at Tidworth in 191 S that he
hadn t missed playing the Bard for one night
in three years, then the literary' Diggers had
their legs pulled, and there is more than
one member of Benson’s then co. here (Syd-
ney) now to prove it. The fact that. Benson
usually concluded his Sunday-night recitals
with the wonderful prayer from ‘Henry
V. which is only 16 lines long, proves
nothing except that Benson is a showman.
Ihe late Dan Barry usually concluded his
curtain speeches with the wonderful state-
ment that the thriller for the next evening
had been specially written for him by the
Melbourne 168 Spurgeon or the Archbishop of
. “Snell”: At least, it must he admitted that
in their treatment of authors, the film-play
producers can give the legitimate theatre
many points in manners. Coming into town
to-day, I noticed all the big posters, and
whereas the names of authors were given in
display type on the film advts., the identity
ot the literary man behind the play pro-
duced at the ordinary theatres was shrouded
m deepest mystery. The theatre managers’
attitude towards this matter has been crudely
expressed : “The audiences don’t give a d—n
who writes the plays, so long as the right
people act them !” Even when the author is
a notorious person like Mr. Shaw, there is
a certain reluctance on the part of the
speaking theatre to declare the fact openly,
I fancy there is in the managerial mind a
grievance against fate that these infernal
writer-fellows should have any finger in
theatrical matters at all.

“0.K.”; Isn’t it time Thorold Waters
ceased to gibe at the ghost of Marchesi because
Amy Castles quarrelled with the old sing-
ing-mistress? He alleges (B. 7/9/’22) that
the late Elizabeth Parkina had “a great and
gorgeous” voice when Amy Castles first heard
her, hut “Marchesi thinned it to a ghost of
its former self.” I say stuff and nonsense
to that. When Parkina was studying in
Paris, and Amy Castles entered the class,
Marchesi had a very high opinion of another
Australian pupil in Olive Kingston. The
three were there at the academy together.
Aot so very long afterwards Parkina came
to Australia as a vamped-up concert “star,”
and Olive congratulated her on her beautiful
voice. Whereupon the American girl replied
laughingly that Olive knew quite well she
had a finer one herself, which she certainly
had. The statement that Parkina’s voice was
ever great and gorgeous beyond Amv Castles’s
conception of earthly possibilities is pure
tosh. What is this grievance that Miss
Castles is said to have against the memory
of Marchesi? The old woman wanted to
tram her for the concert platform, asserting
that she was not fitted for a great operatic
career. Well, has Amy Castles achieved a
great operatic career by going from Marchesi
to another teacher-? Wouldn’t it have been
better for her to take the word of Marchesi
and stick strictly to the concert platform,
on which she has earned nearly all her in-
come these past 23 years?

and, since V. M. Hughes is looking for
another electioneering stunt, here is one to
his hand.
“T. 0.1.”: Some old theatrical memories
are revived by the demolition (to make way
for a six-storey building) of the old edifice
on the south-west corner of Russell and
Bourke streets, Melbourne. Away in the
early ’sixties it was known as The Hum-
mums Hotel, and kept by an old circus
ringmaster, Tom Nunn. (In Covent Gar-
den, London, was the original Hummums.
an eastern word meaning baths.) Tom
Nunn was one of the characters of Mel-
bourne. He arrived in the roaring ’fifties,
which also brought Tom Barry, clown, and
G. B. W. Lewis, circus master and ring per
Tom opened the house on the corner
60 years ago, and had the patronage of
most of the Poverty Pointers of the period.
He lies in Melbourne General Cemetery,
close by John Dunn, comedian, whose tomb-
stone bears the epitaph, “A fellow of infinite
.lest. John Dunn was the father of Rosa
(Mrs. L. L. Lewis) and Marion (Mrs.
Marcus Clarke) and grandfather of Miss
Marion Dunn Clarke of to-day. Rosa is a
resident of Paris. She retired from the stage
on her marriage.
“T.W.”: No vocalist in my recollection
sings with such positive enjoyment
aa Rosma Buckman. It is only pos-
sible when perfect placement goes with
a compelling temperament. Rosina had
the advantage of keeping away from voiee-
quacks, and, as soon as she drifted to the
hmoke, of finding its first real grand-opera
school in full swing. She got the vocal and
dramatic goods there from Grunebaum, a
Covent Garden sub-conductor, and Fair-
bairn, one of Beecham’s producers, both of
them unpretentious but thoroughly equipped
enthusiasts. For any hard worker who has
® r b?ht: gifts, that is now a sure portal to
‘the Garden,” but in the days of earlier folk
like Melba, Lalla Miranda, Frances Saville,
Amy Castles and Lempriere Pringle it was
essential to visit the Continent first.
“0.K.”: At the Lyceum, Sydney, due re-
gard is paid to the amour propre of employees
who at other theatres would remain name-
less and . unsung. A whole page of pro-
gramme is devoted to advertisement of the
managerial staff, w’ith the result that head
manager, chief treasurer and permanent
orchestnans seem to be robbed of compara-
tne importance. ’Midst the multitude of
names one loses sight of class distinction,
i • ! e ,? ame , s the ushers figure in the
list, though without any information re their
ages and weights. Their young sweet
feminine colleagues are listed under the
heading of ‘usherettes.” There is something
very saucy and coquettish about “usherette."
-Lne assistant projectionist” (who sounds
like a cousin to the assistant tormentor)
figures on the bill, and finally the “head
cleaner is not overlooked. Kvidentlv the
management took a leaf out of the book of
the twin Kings of Barataria, in “The Gon-
doliers.”
DISCOVERED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw her first, a maid in white,
So slim and tall and virginal.
Her voice was gentle, soft and light;
She sang divinely to us all,
And I was .charmed, but I alone —
The audience was made of stone.
She sang “Sweet Lavender,” and then
A folk-song full of native grace.
The ladies said, “Not much!” The men
Agreed she had a pretty face.
Indeed a slight bird-soul was she,
• And sang with bird-like subtlety.
I saw her next, assured and bold,
Before a fashionable crowd;
Her voice, metallic now and cold,
Was sonorous and large and loud.
She technique had acquired, the whole
Soprano tricks, and lost a soul.
The audience listened with delight.
“Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark!” she sang,
And “Butterfly” with all her might,
And noisily the plaudits rang.
'Tis true, as doubtless you infer,
S'omebody had “discovered” her.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
The Bulletin’s idea that Gloaming’s
defeat in the Chelmsford Stakes was due to his hav-
ing to take on two challenges in the severe Randwick
straight after making all the running was amply
borne out in the Hill Stakes at Rosehill. There,
Wood, Beauford’s rider, tried to set a pace that
would break the older horse up, but signally failed
to do it. Drawing No. 5 position at the barrier (Gloam-
ing had the fourth
marble) Beauford
cleared out with a
long lead, and at the
turn, though Green-
wood’s horse was gain-
ing on him, lie was
still two or three
lengths ahead. But in
the straight Gloaming
drew up to the
N.S.W. crack, and ran
past him without
apparent trouble to
win by a length and
a quarter in lmin.
38}sec.- —a record mile
for Rosehill. True, he
carried 711). less than
Beauford, but the 71b.
wouldn’t have brought
them together, as the
race was run. Gloam-
ing won by a lot more
than that. Beauford,
who went out at 5 to
2 on (Gloaming was
3 to 1 against) will
have a chance of
avenging himself in
the 12-furlong Spring
Stakes on September
30 unless Gloaming is
reserved for the 10-
furlong Craven Plate.
But this page wouldn’t
be surprised to see
David beat the pair
ALBERT WOOD.
of them over a mile and a half.
In the bulk this season’s three-year-olds are not so
good as last year’s lot, but two or three are pretty
decent. Soorak beat everything but Gloaming and
Beauford in the Hill Stakes, and Furious and Wish
Wynne were among the starters. He finished fairly
well, though six lengths behind the Beau Soult
gelding, but he has yet to answer the question
whether he can go the Derby distance. There is no
such doubt in Oaserta’s case. That fine son of
Comedy King shapes like a real stayer. Always
favorite for the Rosehill Guineas (his best price
was 7 to 4), he ran home lengths ahead of Cliffdale
and Tressayr, and appeared to have the race won
at any part of the journey. He will see a short
price on Derby day.
Alfort (4’s) took the first division of the seven-
furlong Camellia Stakes, and Gilray (5 to 4 on)
the second division. There was nothing impressive
in Alfort’s exhibition—-only King’s fine judgment
of pace saved him from being beaten by the fast-
finishing Colonel North —but Gilray’s performance was
very satisfactory to his Epsom backers. lie won
like a racehorse. Still, Dunwil, who ran third
(I.arillo separated them), might have troubled him
but for bad luck in running. Wren’s sturdy little
chestnut got away badly, but ran round the field
and finished stoutly-—so much so that there were
many inquiries about him for the Epsom, in which
he has Bst. 71b.
The 12-furlong Rosehill Handicap went to the use-
ful old Poseidon gelding Greg, who was solidly
backed at 7’s. Syce Knight, who looked a bit above
himself, was a close second, and the outsider,
Basella, pipped Punch for third place. Punch was
finishing well, and has an outside chance in the
Metrop.
# - * * #
The Hawkesbury club will lose nothing
bv holding its annual on the Rosehill course. Nom-
inations are numerous, and winners have been well
concealed. For the six-furlong Flying Handicap
Loyal Irish is not over-burdened with Bst. 61b. In
his absence Duke Isinglass (7st. 121 b.) may win.
If Cliffdale (Bst. 31b.) starts in the Guineas and
Soorak ( 9st.. 81b.) in the Three-year-old Handicap
each will be dangerous, and Belle Shot (7st. 111 b.)
is well handicapped in the seven-furlong Highweight
Handicap. But if the stable puts a jockey on Sea
Risk (Bst. lllb.) nothing will beat that horse, given
a fair getaway and ordinary luck in running. With
a small boy atop and a big field to get through, he
will be hardly worth considering. The 11-furlong
Spring Handicap looks like going to one of the
stable companions, Prince Sandy (7st. lllb.) and
Duke Napoli (6st. 121 b.).
Nothing of special note happened in Mel-
bourne’s horsey world last week except the defeat
of Statton at Moonee Valley, after a series of vic-
tories that had brought him many backers for the
Caulfield Cup. It proved nothing, considering that
Statton was carrying stones more than his Cup
weight, but it suggested that the Land of Song
horse has possibly touched his highest point for
ihe present. There is a deepening impression in
Melbourne that the winner of the Caulfield Cup is
among the horses now in training on the other side
of the Murray. After the second day of the A.J.C.
meeting a number of minor hopes for the Cups are
bound to be snuffed out.

“Fax”: Since March, 1921, when Eric
Connolly bought him, Rostrum has been a shining
example of how a horse can get along nicely without
having been "raced into form," "sharpened by a
few gallops with the colors up,” “satisfactorily
tried in public,” etc. Sporting journalism tries
hard to excuse the practice of running byes with
unripe gees, thereby deceiving the great mass of
unsophisticated punters, whilst enabling those in
the know to get good odds about the frequent
failure as soon as the stable means business. But
the record of first-class racers proves the dishonesty
of the “sharpening-up” process. They are none the
less fit to win when backed, because they didn’t run
when unbacked. Revenue, the 0 to 4 winner of a
Melbourne Cup, was backed as a certainty despite
his not having raced in public for 12 months.
Eurythmic and Beauford are not “raced into form.”
They are expected to be in form every time they are
raced. And Rostrum’s record for the past 18 months
is three wins, no defeats. As a three-year-old he
ceased racing in March, and there was a pause of
11 months before he ran again, at Caulfield, beating
Dunwil, who was considered unbeatable by the John
Wren crowd. A week later Rostrum won the New-
market. There was another pause of six months,
and then he won the Tramway Handicap at Rand-
wick.

“0.K.”: The cabled announcement of old
John Osborne’s demise sounded to some ears very
like the news that Queen Anne is dead. Turf history
has almost forgotten the time when Johnny Osborne
began to be pet jockey of the North of" England.
“Measter John,” trainer and jockey, was a grave
and reverend seigneur among the boys 50 years ago.
He then sported the light grey belltopper of a
bygone age, and no rising young lightweight
addressed him without touching his cap. He was an
institution in 1874, when he had the mare Apology
in his stable, and rode her to victory in the One
Thousand Guineas, Oaks and Leger. Apology, unfor-
tunately for her owner, Mr.“Launde,” got to be talked
about in the sporting p'Pess as “the parson’s horse,”
which she certainly was. Up to then the Rev. James
King, the breeder of Apology, had kept his identity
from publicity, though he had raced several good
horses. But as soon as his ownership of Apology
got talked about, the North-country vicar received
a letter from his bishop demanding to know whether
there was truth in the allegation. The parson said
“Yes.” Then the bish. required him, as a minister
of the Gospel, to state whether he would retire from
the turf, or remain in sin and resign his pastorship.
The sporting parson retired from the controversy
with all his colors flying. He had inherited from
his father some valuable thoroughbred horses, he
wrote, and had taken a family interest and pride in
his little stud-farm, where a fine strain of racing
blood had been improved upon. Personally he had
never gone upon a racecourse or made a wager since
he . entered the church as a young man. But as he
was now an old man, and wanted to end his days in
peace at his vicarage, he would sell his brood mares
and part with Apology. Obituary notices in the
English press of old John Osborne are sure to fea-
ture the story of the parson’s horse.
“Murningurry”: Exit William Yabsley,
for years president of Coraki (N.S.W.) Jockey Club,
and a member of the well-known squatting family
of Bungawalbyn. Yabsley was a small boy when
the first race meeting was held at Casino, and was
booked to ride a big grey called Whalebone for
George Sparkes. At the last moment Sparkes decided
that he was too tiny to manage the grey, and gave
the mount to another boy. Young Bill was annoyed,
and as nobody else required a very small jock he
entered his own hack for the Hurry Scurry, rode the
horse himself, and won. Next he nominated for the
Hack Race, for which Whalebone was a competitor.
Jocks were required to wear colors, but the only
colors Yabsley had were in a regatta shirt he was
wearing. Old Henry Barnes, of Dyraaba, after argu-
ment, said: “Let the boy start; his color’s straw-
berry.” “They let me start,” said Yabsley, “because
they thought 1 couldn’t win.” But win he did, to
the surprise of everybody. He went to Casino with
10s. and returned home with £3O. But instead of
the cheers lie expected, old dad Yabsley said to him:
“This racing business is no good; turn the horse
out.” And out he went.

The difference between this year’s edition
of J. J.-“ Miller's Sporting Annual and its prede-
cessors is in the slimness of the volume, in spite of
a few extra pages. The paper is rather finer and
better, and what is printed on it will always be found
good value for reference purposes.
The Australians did fairly well in the
U.S. singles championship, but only Patterson reached
the semi-finals. Then, playing against Tilden for
the right to meet the winner of the Richards-Johnston
match, he lost by three sets to one, which is about
the best score that he has put up against the Yankee
to date. It is strange that Anderson, who was
easily beaten by Patterson at Wimbledon, should do
so well against Tilden, and yet succumb to the youth-
ful Vincent Richards in three straight sets. Richards,
who was gravely announced as a world-beater, and did
indeed down Tilden at a Rhode Island championship
a while hack, is evidently off his form this year, for
Johnston knocked him out without losing a set. Pat
O’Hara Wood, who apparently had strong opposition
in the draw, severely walloped the much-fancied
Willis Davis, of California, but was unable to do any-
tiling with Tilden, whom he met for the first time.
Tilden, a master tactician, forced Wood to stick
mostly to the baseline, where he would feel acutely
uncomfortable, whilst the Australian strove to reach
the net, where his genius for interception would put
him on much better terms. Beautifuilv-placed pass-
lng shots oft forehand and backhand evidently drove
'' ood into a reluctant retreat at an early stage of the
Same.

In addition to being Rugby League pre-
miers, North Sydney have become entitled to hold
the City Cup. They established this right by dust-
ing the earth with Eastern Suburbs, against whom
they scored 18 points (4 tries 3 goals) to 11 (1 try
4 goals). The surfers, with Sandy Pearce raking
and the breeze astern, put up a great go in the open-
ing canto, and should have got several more points
than the 9 which stood to their credit at “lemons.”
But in the second half Duncan Thompson, Peters,
Green and Blinkhorn carried too many guns for
them. Green, their hooker, did wonders against a
much heavier set of men. Border was away with
the N.S.W. Eeague XIII visiting M.L., who won
their first match, that against Auckland, by 40 (10
tries 5 goals) to 25 (5 tries 5 goals). Burge. Glebe’s
giant forward, was himself responsible for 5 tries
and 3 goals.

“Centurion” : Hector Forsayth, who went
to Oxford by way of King’s School (N.S.W.), will
return to Australia before next football season. As
a full-back he got his Rugby blue for Oxford, like
his schoolmate Bettington, and was five times capped
for Scotland. Critics reckon him the best full-back
seen in Britain for years. In Hector’s first match for
Oxford, at Queen’s, one amazed individual broke the
calm of the members’ stand with his agonised cries.
He gazed angrily at his programme on which, in
English fashion were printed the names of the
players with their schools and colleges. “Forsayth,
Parramattah I” he cried. “Parramattah! Can any-
one tejl me wheah the devil is Parramattah?”
That Soccer is on the up-grade in Sydney
was shown on Saturday, when a crowd of 7000
witnessed the final between West Wallsend (holders)
and Granville (winners in 1904 and 1914), for the
Gardiner Cup. Granville scored the only goal. J.
Comrie (their skipper and centre-half) got it and
played a game that sent the Geordies into raptures.
The footballers who play Australian rules also had a
final, Paddington beating Newtown by 54 (8 goals
6 behinds) to 44 (5 goals 14 behinds). Newtown
have been runners-up for 10 consecutive years.
Saturday saw the end of the first round in
Vic. League football, and Melbourne, Richmond, St.
Hilda, Geelong and South Melbourne disappear from
the scene. Only one game mattered, and about
33,000 turned up to see whether Collingwood or
Essendon would be minor premiers. It had rained
heavily all Friday night, so there could be little
opening for science, but keenness and determination
kept the scores almost level from beginning to end,
and with “30 all” at lemon-time it was anybody’s
game. Essendon sailed in strenuously, but ever the
Magpies put on point for point and goal for g0a1..;, In
the end they came out 4 points ahead—4 7 to ’Don’s
43. For the rest, Fitzroy outed Melbourne by 63
points to 55 ; St. Hilda smashed Richmond by 64 to
37, and South piled up a mountain of 21 goals 10
behinds to Geelong’s 8 goals 10 behinds. The final
for the Association minor premiership was battled out
before 12,000 spectators between. Port and North,
but the men who outed Footscray last week had no
hope after the first quarter, when the board notified
Port, 30 points; North, nil. In the end the River-
siders won by 66 points to North’s 28. Next- Satur-
day absolute finality will be reached, between Ports
and ’Scray, minor premiers, and the collision promises
to be memorable.

“Winkle”: Dick Lee. the greatest forward
that ever played the Australian game, has kicked
his last goal at Victoria Park. After helping Colling-
wood in the coming finals, he will retire with 17
years’ service to his credit. He was first picked
with the Magpies in 1906 when but 16 years old,
and, except when injured, has never been out of the
team. During the period he has kicked 706 goals
in premiership matches —easily the record —and is
the only Victorian who has played in all the foot-
ball carnivals since 1908. Though cool and calculat-
ing, he fights desperately for the ball, and for this
reason has received more knocks, both fair and un-
fair, than any other player. During four years he
carried on with an open sore and exposed bone on
the shin; and on another occasion, a groggy knee
that interfered with his play for two seasons was
only patched up by the removal of the cartilege.
Absolutely fair, unselfish- —he will always pass to an
unguarded and better-positioned player—a great high-
mark and a straight kick, he has only one fault,
according to opponents—he “stages” to bluff the
umpire. But so do other forwards. It is a coinci-
dence that Harry Lever, St. Hilda's full-back, who
has been Lee’s closest opponent on more occasions
than any other man, should retire this year after
19 years football, 18 of which were with the Sea-
sides.
“G.A.S.”: “Trenwink’s” (B. 7/9/’22)
nomination for the long-service footballer competi-
tion has to take a back seat to Ted Holloway, who
has played half-back for the Avenel (Vic.) team
for 29 years. And he served four years in the
ruck on the other side, at that.
Football in Adelaide could hardly be more
dramatic if arranged by a movie producer. Norwood,
\\est Torrens and South Adelaide sat safe for a place
in the finals. Port, last year’s premiers, had started
badly but came with a late run; with two matches
to go, they had only to win either of them, and
if they lost both might yet get into the four by a
better goal-average than West Adelaide. They lost
the first of the two, by just 2 points, to Norwood.
Then they met Torrens in the other —and were 6
goals behind at three-quarter time. Also, news
came through that West was having an amazing
13-goal win over South, so the goal-average resource
was gone. Port held their opponents pointless in
the last quarter. They got 5 goals. They kicked
a sixth. Through the wild enthusiasm the umpire’s
whistle could be heard, calling the ball back. The
winning goal, which had been signalled and hoisted,
was disallowed. Then the final bell went, and
pandemonium set in. The rest has been appeals and
recriminations, and even bitter talk of a Supreme
Court injunction.

Fred Ivohlman’s sturdy legs again carried
him to the front in the annual 10-mile run at Caul-
field (Vie.). Early in the afternoon a thunderstorm
broke over the village, but it fined up afterwards,
and the great army of peds had a comparatively easy
journey when they started out from the racecourse
at 4 p.m. Kohlman, however, encountered stiffer
opposition this time. Tenacious rivals clung to his
heels and compelled him to move briskly to keep his
advantage. At five miles J. E. Bell, an ex-Sydney
man with a good record, was plodding cheer-
fully 10 yards astern. Later on Bell gave ground
to Page and Boyd, the latter moving up in the final
lap and finishing strongly Csec. behind the champion,
who had covered the distance in 59min. ssec. F.
Page, who was runner-up last year, ran third, Stain-
field was fourth, Bell fifth and Vines sixth. As all
those and Boyd aforesaid belonged to St. Stephen’s
Harriers, that club took the trophy for team work.
While Kohlman was winning in Melbourne,
11. L. Sheaves, his South Sydney rival, was
heading the field in the 12-mile race that Manly calls
its Modified Marathon. But Sheaves had to travel
all he knew to beat A. Gainsford (St. George)
and M. J. Mackenzie (South Sydney), and he was
only seven yards in front of Gainsford at the finish.
His time was excellent—6Bmin.. 33sec. Botany won
the teams race with 48 points from South Sydney
(54) and East Sydney (109), 4,6, 7,9, 10 and 12
being Botany’s remarkable figures.

Charlie Campbell, of Leura (N.S.W.), is
Australia’s! latest golf champion!. He met the pick of the
Commonwealth’s amateurs and professionals, barring
Kirkwood, at Rose Bay (Sydney), last week, and at
the end of the two days’ play had an aggregate card
of 307, with A. le Fevre (310), E. J. Quirk (313)
and Ivo Whitton (314) next in order. Campbell
began indifferently on both days, but a brilliant 73
the first afternoon gave him a good lead, and he
completed the job with a workmanlike 75, after le
Fevre had drawn level with him. Legh Winser, the
S.A. crack, failed to get the strength of the greens,
and was fourteenth with 324. Campbell used to be
a caddie at Rose Bay, and was afterwards a pro-
fessional at Brisbane. For the past decade, he has
been associated with the Leura club. The amateur
foursomes were won by F. G. Murdoch and R. T.
Armstrong (N.S.W.), who beat E. .1. Quirk and
H. O. Morrison (Vic.) by a stroke—ls 2 to 153. The
handicap connected with this event went to R. and
L. Nettlefold (Tas.), who are father and son.
The Bathurst-Sydney bike race was a
hard plug over 130 miles of heavy and rough roads,
but 47 riders chanced it. L. Post (40min.) led
most of the way. and won decisively with 7|min. to
spare in 7hr. 57min. 22 l-ssec. Post also put up
fastest time, and therefore goes as N.S.W. rep. in
the Warrnambool-Melbourne race next month.
Those who paid 21s. Bd. and 10s. lOd. to
see .Tack Daniels box Bill Grime at the Sydney
Stadium have a good ground of action for recovery
of the money. Nothing more barefaced has ever
been imposed on a marvellously tolerant public, even
at the Stadium. Billed as a Welsh champion who
had never been knocked out, Daniels proved a worse
fighter than even the Stadium’s other Great Un-
known, Delamore. In five rounds of farcical milling
he failed to land a single clean punch ; on the other
hand, Grime, who is no wonder, hit him where and
when he pleased. The towel soared from Cam-
bria’s corner amidst a tornado of hoots. Tenders
for the conversion of the Stadium into a fowlhouse
will presumably be announced in due course.

Jimmy Semmens, who has grown out of
the bantamweight division, gave Bert McCarthy s}lb.
and a bad beating at Melbourne on Saturday night.
After experiencing a fierce time in the first round, he
mastered Mae’s style of fighting, cut him to pieces
with his lance-like left, and outed him in the seventh.
It was an astonishing victory, and none was more
amazed than Isaac Mcßook, who demanded from Mc-
Carthy’s backers 5 to 1 on.
“Bongo”: Alf J. Wilkins, who died at
Manly the other day, used to be an athlete of note.
He held the 880yds. and 220yds. running champion-
ship? of N.S.W., and won many swimming handicaps,
although never quite first-class in the water. Bris-
bane knew him as a patron oi amateur boxing. He
was only 43 at the end.
* * * *
“Derf”: At Herberton (N.Q.) recently
died James Drysdale, a one-time international
cricketer, who played with an Australian eleven against
W. G. Grace’s team in ’9l-2. Poor Drysdale had
been in ill-health for some time, but refused to give
in. Then his friends took the matter in hand, and
four volunteers carried him 22 miles on a stretcher
to the Herberton hospital. He had been in N.
Queensland for about 20 years when the Umpire
gave him out.
MARKSMANSHIP
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Supposing' a man did kiss a girl exactly in the
centre of her hare expanse of back at the Sydney
Artists’ Ball, is there any harm in it?”- —Bohemian
apologist in the dailies.
What harm could lurk in a salute so chaste?
He wasn’t the sort
The brethren of the brush to have disgraced;
Though wowsers snort
Between white shoulder-blades that kiss who placed
Was sure a sport
V\ith more to be exultant than ashamed at,
Assuming that he hit the spot he aimed at.
What harm when with a marksman's rapture rare
His heart was full ?
As one who stands before a target fair,
His bow to pull,
And knows, while dcaf’ning plaudits split the air,
He’s scored a bull,
Making his feathered shaft unerring enter
Exactly in the geometric centre.
Harm? Rather should he rank with William Tell,
He should, indeed ;
The hinder surface of a ball-room belle
Who scanned with speed,
And picked one speck, with eye infallible,
And drew a bead—
And with a kiss solved the perplexing riddle
Of what was the exact and perfect middle.

You will find that a razor which strops itself is as great an improvement as
a motor car which starts itself. It is even better because it means more

The Ada Reeve matinge at the Palace on
Friday to help the maimed Diggers brought
in close on £lOOO. The house was packed,
and big money had been paid for special
seats. Some lovely ladies, with flowers,
bushranged the entrance, so that most of
the audience were decorated with violets and
daffodils before they rustled down into place.
Ada auctioned a table-centre worked by a
Digger who had lost his legs and his hope
of his pre-war work. It was a creditable
thing, and brought a wad of money at the
finish. Several boxes of chocolates brought
from £lO to £5O each. Walter Marks.
M.H.R., sitting in the front stalls with Billy
Hughes, planked down 45 guineas for one,
and tossed it in a casual way to a lady in
the same row. Mrs. Bendigo Hall rose to
•‘>s guineas on two occasions, and eventually
bagged a box.
Hughes came in to the stalls late, and
caused something of a flurry. In a nervy,
fussy, careful way, he took off his greatcoat,
and having shaken it and folded it into pre-
cise folds, placed it carefully on his knees,
and mounted his gleaming tower of a silk
hat on top of it. Then he peered round
this pyramid with the solemnity of an oWI,
and remained unmoved by the vaudeville
until one Spangle asked another Spangle if
she knew Esther. “Esther who?” “Esta
stuff to give ’em.” This touched Billy’s
funny-bone, and lie rolled in contortions of
mirth. His tall, dignified silk hat was saved
from destruction only by the presence of
mind of his tall A.D.C. from Wentworth.
All the theatrical shows in Melbourne did
their bit to help the affair along, and the Reeve
Spangles items finished the bill. As Hughes
clambered on to the stage to thank Ada for
all she had done for the limbless soldiers,
one Digger shouted: “What are you going
to do yourself, Billy?” William, being deaf,
heard not. Ada made an answering speech,
and called Hughes “My dear Prime Minister”
half-a-dozen times. She also held his hand
while she speeched, and the little man gazed
down at his wife in the stalls in an exag-
geratedly unperturbed way. Eventually the
buxom star embraced him violently, and said,
"I shall never forget that 1 once appeared
on the stage with you.” Hughes blushed
violently and remarked, “It may not be the
last_ time. I may be cornin’ to you for a
job.” All this vaudeville turned the house
dizzy with delight, and the show finished
up in a turmoil of applause.
Mrs. Tom Walsh, who was Adela Pank-
hurst, recently gave point to some of the
vivid oratory of her violent suffragette days
by collecting her third baby bonus.
Melbourne is smiling over the way Wilma
Berkeley, the happy victim of Melba’s gush-
ing, is being rushed. Not many months ago
the Nice People who heard her obviously
fine voice showed no particular desire to hear
it again. But since Melba has told them
that it is wonderful, they are all on their
knees to the possessor of it.
They brought poor old Hans Irvine all the
way trom London to bury him at Great
Western, in the shade of his beloved Gram-
pians. It was there that he began his big
job of wine-making. Always a country of
vineyards, the vines have spread consider-
ably since then. A big sheeprun of those
days, Conconjella, lias long since been cut
up and divided among the, vine-growers. One
early vigneron, Best, chlled his vineyard
and his brand of grape-juice after the pic-
turesque old sheepery.
Bessie, the Stanley Argyle girl, is to wed
young Eric Hill on October 3 at St. John’s,
Toorak.
Charity, which covereth a multitude of
stunts, accounted for a bridge-party at the
Wattle Tea Rooms, last Friday, Melbourne
Hospital being the particular object in view,
and the Herbert Smith’s being foremost in
the brigandage. A charity auction is some-
thing that everybody knows about. It brings
voluntary subscriptions under gentle pres-
sure of excitement. But the mock auction-
sale, such as brought in a three-figures’
total at the Wattle the other night, fetches
involuntary subscriptions under a pressure:
that comes pretty rough on some of the vic-
tims. The auctioneer selected what “marks”
he chose, and knocked down any old thing
to each of them for whatever sum he cared
to mention. Everything else having been
disposed of at a fancy price the auctioneer
arrived at a leg of pork. There would have
been no charity-auction humor in foisting
the forbidden food upon a Gentile, so he
knocked the unclean thing down to Joel Fox
for £4, and the sufferer made the best of his
compulsory donation by getting away With
the goods.
Consciously or unconsciously, the rounds-
men who wrote up the stocking robbery at
Incley’s the other day emphasised the point
that Melbourne women have unfairylike feet.
The burglars, who must have known what
they were about, according to the reports,
spurned the sheaths that would fit dainty feet
and lifted only the big sizes. “It’s time women
were put on juries,” declared one indignant
dame, when she read about it.
May Brahe, once of Melbourne, who is
now perhaps the most successful dasher-off
of those sentimental ditties that get them-
selves whistled all over London, has re-
married. He is an actor named George
Morgan. Morgan is a graceful dancer, a
clever light singer and reciter, and he did
much to entertain the Diggers in their Eng-
lish camps after the recruiters had passed
him by with a sniff. He Avon a small niche
in revue, but may now find his work cut out
managing his wife’s song interests and her
four semi-grown boys and girls.
Nearly 500 of the Best Dressed fluttered
into the Oriental Hotel the other day for
“tea, music and cards” in aid of Queen Vic.
Hospital. Lady Mayoress Swanson was at
the head of the affair, with Mrs. Hewison
and Adelaide Allan as bon. secs. The
Stradbroke Countess failed to materialise, but
her daughter Helena came on as understudy
in biscuit-colored upholsterings and nodding
plumes on her yellow-bound black lid. Miss
Currie acted as bodyguard. Kiosks in the
Winter Garden did a roaring trade, among
the amateur shop-ladies being Mrs. Russell-
Gabb, Mrs. P. McCauley and Mrs. H. J.
Robertson. Rene Maxwell, all brown cbif-
fonery and dimples, lent a hand in hawking
sweets in the dining-hall, where poker and
bridge enthusiasts massed. Mrs. Barry
Thompson organised the musical events, with
Gordon Terry as showman. After warbling
in the lounge, each performer scudded to the
dining-room to save the card-players from
being musically starved. Among those who
did the double turn were Wilma Berkeley,
Weston Pett, Gladys Moncrieff, Robert
Chisholm, Esther and Betty Paterson, Mrs.
Teddy Dyson and Gordon Terry. Miss Mc-
Rae not only lent the hotel and the services
of her staff, but also contributed tea and
cakes to the cause.
Paymaster Reginald Egerton, who trans-
ferred to the Aussie Navy after his marriage
with Margot Mcßean, and lately crossed from
Sydney to Melbourne, is casting his gold-
lace trappings early next year. The pair
propose to settle doAvn on a pleasant acreage
they have acquired at Frankston.
This is Adeline Hittmann, of Adel-
aide. Her lather
was scholarly Tom
Dowling, of the old
Windmill esta t e,
Penrith, (N.S.W.),
who carried a pike
in the ’4B Rebellion,
and later sought
sanctuary u n der
Australian skies.
Mrs. Hittmann is
well known i n
Adelaide as a lecturer
on Celtic literature,
the soft voice and her
gift of words being
a heritage from her
kinsman, .1 a m e s
Clarence Mangan, of
"D a r k Rosaleen”
fame. There is talk
of her running for
the S.A. Assembly; in the meantime she is
busy preparing the MSS. of her father for
publication, together with a set of poems
and essays of her own.
The Honorary Justices are to have a musi-
cal night out on the 29th. It is part of a
great round of dissipation arranged for
Show Week, beginning with a visit to the
Herald office on the Tuesday. At a given
critical moment many members of the lion.
.Justices’ Association, accompanied each by
one of his own or somebody else’s woman-
kind, will enter the Herald building, and
be horribly in the way while beholding how
a Great Newspaper is produced. A mili-
tary bodyguard ought to be provided lest
many of the printers should chance to recog-
nise old enemies among the unpaid Jay Pays.
On Wednesday the stout gentlemen (they
must be stout and bald) will visit the New-
port Railway Workshops, and on Thursday
evening they are to have a riotous time at
Hoyt’s Pictures. Next night the concert.
It is to happen at Melbourne Town Hall,
and will include bird imitations. Gay dogs
those lion. Justices when they get off the
chain! .
Dark-eyed Guida Ilewison had a 21st
birthday dance in an upstairs room at the St.
Kilda Civic Hall the other evening, whereat
a joyous hand of young things whirled until
one in the morning with an interlude for a
gorgeous sit-down supper all set in masses
of daffodils and pink blossom. Mrs.
Hewisou beamed upon the frivol from black
silk draperies lined with white, and Guida her-
self was radiant in rose-pink. Lady Mayoress
Swanson was among the elders, and Dame
Mary Hughes blew in from the Wilma
Berkeley concert. Town-clerk Fred* Cham-
berlain was there with a 22-year-old son, and
his daughter Marie in white ehiffonery with
pink rose-buds wreathing her dark * locks.
Rene Swanson danced in white and gold,
and Margot Best girdled a white lace frock
with green.
There was a great party at the Occidental
the other day in honor of Robert Hazlewood
Lawson, who is retiring from his job as
Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the
State. A host of electoral people and Par-
liamentary big-guns came along to wish him
well in his resting time, and he was pre-
sented with numerous valuables and com-
plimentary remarks. The veteran, pictured
herewith by Mon-
tea th, has toiled for
half-a-century in the
Queensland and
Commonwealth Civil
Services. The first
white infant born on
the Burnett (Q.), he
was christened
“Munduberra” b y
the local abos.. and
the Bananaland Gov-
e r n m e n t subse-
quently fastened the
name to a flourish-
ing village west of
Maryborough in his
honor. Lawson did
fine work as Gov-
ernment surveyor in
Queensland, and pre-
pared the present
official map of the State. Afterwards he
was Registrar of Titles in Townsville, Chief
Clerk of the Police and Home Departments
in Brisbane, and then head Electoral officer.
Fifteen years ago he became the Common-
wealth electoral representative in Queens-
land, later on transferring to Melbourne.
He was on the recent Commission that re-
arranged the Federal boundaries of Victoria.
The latest example of the commercialisa-
tion of Collins-street East—the sacred
ground of the doctors and the Melbourne
Club—is the establishment of a branch of
the National Bank in one of a terrace of
three old-fashioned two-storeyed houses next
to Melbourne Mansions. If the Melbourne Club
feels inclined to resent the invasion it can
turn its frown on one of its own pillars—
Frank Clarke, Minister for Public Works,
who is a director of the bank.
The Town Hall was filled, save in spots,
for the Mewton Choir’s 20th performance
the other night. It was held under the
special blessing of the British Musical
Society. The singers warbled cheerfully in a
rich, full tone, which put them on a friendly
footing with the audience from the jump.
Stanley Orchard was the soloist, but he
marred an otherwise fine performance by
swallowing his own words. A feature of
the programme was a sonata for fiddle and
piano in three acts by Fritz Hart, inter-
preted by Gertrude Healey and Doris Had-
den. The finest choir item was a bracket
of sea songs, for male voices only, with
Stanley Orchard in the forefront.
Mrs. Frank Tate will leave in March for
England with her Director husband. While
he is attending the Imperial Education Con-
ference she will take stock of London and
note how it has changed since she saw it 15
years ago. Then she will tour the provinces,
and see on their native heath something of
the few Scotch who are not further south
ruling the Empire. If she doesn't come
back Lady Tate a few thousand State
teachers will be both surprised and disap-
pointed.
Last Thursday night the W. T. Rowes,
who have draped their walls at WaUindue
with Max Meldrurn’s canvases, entertained a
hundred friends and relatives at the painter’s
art discourse in the Athenamm Hall,
followed by a supper party at the Oriental.
Mrs. Rowe was in black silken draperies,
which revealed peeps of peacock-green, and
she further defied fate with peacock-feather
eyes embroidered on her bodice. The artist’s
little French wife, who brought along two
clever-looking daughters, hid black ehiffon-
ery under voluminous grey cloaks. The
hostess’s mother, Mrs. Norman, was another
successful lady in black. Oriental decorations
struck quite the right Meldrum art note —
massed groups of white lilies, with cloudy
banks of pink blossom gleaming against a
dusky background, while huge bunches of
daffodils, showed golden amidst the cream-
cakes and sandwiches.
Mrs. Stein —the Lady Mayoress of the
Prince’s time —is still in the limelight. She
is an earnest helper in charity shows, and
also keeps her end up as a wonderful hostess.
The Steins have bought a seaside cottage
round the bay at Seaford, and frequently
entice motor-loads of guests along to musical
at-homes.
William, the elder hope of the Brighton
Piercy Austins, who grazes his flocks
at Ardoon, Gippsland, is engaged to Ger-
trude, second daughter of the Campbell
Hoggs. Young Bill pulled a dark-blue oar
in the Ilead-of-the-River struggle before he
went to the war. The Iloggs loomed large
in the Society of the ’eighties, and even
before that.
There was a brilliant programme and a
large house for the 18th of Allan’s popular
concerts on Saturday. Guy Moore, Joseph
Foster, Vera Carew and Mary Thirlwell were
the singing stars, while Isobel Langlands
played the fiddle and Benno Scherek purred
at the piano. Mary Thirlwell was in a
duck-egg green gown, and Vera Carew
flaunted the greenest of Paddy’s color in
dress and headwreath, but the little violinist
came meekly on in glittering black jet with
her powerful arms quite bare.
Recognising the hopelessness of going on
with liis motion for Bible lessons in State
schools,. Grand Master Snowball had it post-
poned when the subject came before the
Leg. Assembly last week. A caucus of sup-
porters of the lessons mustered only 15 or
thereabouts. Greenwood wanted to go full
speed ahead, but he found himself standing-
alone. Ilis Licensing Bill leadership of
two years ago was not forgotten. Another
inglorious demonstration wasn’t desired. So
all the ammunition prepared by Alec Pea-
cock to combat the motion had to be put in
the storehouse.
Clifton Keat, who gave a song recital in
Queen’s Hall a few nights ago, is equipped
with a fine tenor which gives promise of
future success, though he is still in the
student class, and further handicapped by
excessive nervousness. Miss Phyllis Parlett.
was also on the programme with a couple
of rather too-ambitious piano solos, and Ivan
Vladinoff fiddled soulfully with impeccable
technique.
St. Paul’s Cathedral Erection Board has
awakened. It has decided to take immediate
action to complete the building. But some-
thing more effective will be required than
the ink-spilling of the last three weeks,
which resulted in one man opening his purse
and sending along 10s.
Ada Armytage and'Leslie Madden Nelken
planned a big stunt at the Exhibition a few
days ago in aid of all-children’s charities.
Unfortunately Mrs. Nelken was laid low with
pneumonia, but her husband bravely took up
the running, and he and Miss Armytage
worked the partv to a fine financial finish.
Dame Mary Hughes went along to give
them a hand and add a speech. The star
item on the entertainment programme was
the singing of Wilma Berkeley.
children’s Fairv parade is to happen
in the Town Hall on October 13, to help the
Broadmeadows Foundling Home. Jennie
Brenan is coaching and organising the show.
The Norman Brookes’ baby, Cynthia, willie
Queen of the Fairies, and Billy Hughes’s
daughter Helen will be her train-bearer. The
Geoffrey Syme’s youngest tot, Felicity, will
be Cupid, and hosts of other dainty cherubs
will make up the fairy throng. Lady Strad-
broke is to hand over the prizes.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
Show week surpassed all its own records for
crowds. The movies and shops—’specially drapery
—have been crammed to bursting point. But the
garment-sellers can’t work oft’ gaudy horrors as easily
as of old. Fashion has penetrated to the backblocks,
and, from the flimsy stockings and fantastic shoes
that encase her sturdy legs and feet, to the lumps oi
hair that modestly veil her ears, Miss Wayback is
bang up to date in her dressing.
. Madame Mouehette, whose home has been in
Australia since ’Bl, and in Adelaide since the early
'nineties, has gone back to France. A generation ago
she was almost as well known in Melbourne, where
her husband was secretary to the French consulate.
She and her sister, Madame Lion, taught French or
Spanish or painting to most of the girls of the day.
War work took them both to France for a time, and.
when Madame Lion died a few months ago, her sister
decided to go back to end her days with her own
people.
Even their own artistry, and Melba's written and
autographed behest on the posters outside Allan’s
(“Do go and hear them. They are so splendid!”),
didn’t bring Althouse and Middleton the audiences
they deserved till their last two concerts. Then
Adelaide woke up and surged along. Althouse rebelled
one evening at a second encore for his first number.
“Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you,” he said,
“hut there is a lot to follow” —and a wave of
laughter broke over the house when Middleton’s bulk
came up the steps.
The Herbert Rymills are moving from the Grange
to a house at Kooyonga—the new golf links that he
has been chiefly instrumental in floating at Lockleys.
The City Council is adding on another item to
its inventory' of mementoes of Queen Adelaide —a
gift from the Queen 6f a pair of candlesticks that
once belonged to William IV. and his wife.
The prize for a misguided sense of humor should
go to the unknown jester who rang up an Adelaide
citizeness with the news that her father had died
suddenly near Maitland, oh Yorke Peninsula. Hasty
messages collected the rest of the family, and the}
all set out for Maitland per motor, only to meet the
corpse in his motor a few miles out of the town-
ship, perfectly well, and with no intention of hand-
ing in his checks. A queer notion of a joke.

Do You Believe in the
Psychic Power of Cats?
*
Miss Sylvia Bremer does. She believes that the feline
species are possessed with psychic power, or the ability
to see into the future. But, more important still, she
believes in maintaining her physical welfare with the aid
of CLEMENTS TONIC. Writing from her present
home, the charming Australian actress says: —
“‘After a hard day’s work in the film studios, I
find that CLEMENTS TONIC soothes the irritated
nerves, and gives me sound, recuperative sleep. I could
not wish for a more effective nerve and blood medicine.”
- Thus, although across the sea, Miss Bremer avails herself
of that popular Australian medicine, CLEMENTS
TONIC, which has for thirty years past been a positive
boon to sufferers who sought relief from anaemia,
impaired vitality, insomnia, debilitated nerves, and
similar ailments.
There are no narcotics or alcohol in CLEMENTS TONIC.
Taken either with water or soda-water, it is most
invigorating and refreshing.
“It Puts the ‘ Vital ’ into Vitality.”

Rosina Buckman has been the star around
which some of the largest tea-leaf gatherings
of the week revolved. The prima donna
has returning to the stepping-off point of
her career quite unaffected by either her
full-bloom success or her alarming increase
of waistline. Her pink-and-white face was
wreathed in smiles the other afternoon. when
she, as guest of honor in the Mayoral lady’s
special sanctum at the Town Hall, went
through a lengthy hand-shaking ceremony.
She wore black millinery that had
burst info an ecstasy of ospreys (or their
twin), and was otherwise pale-grey georgette
topped by d black panne coat that trailed off
into chenille fringe from the knee down. Her
good-looking, and equally piump and smooth
husband smiled equably whether greeted as
D’Awley, D’Oyley, D’Weesly, or Doisley,
(the first syllable rhyming with “noise”),
which seems the pronunciation in vogue in
his domestic circle. All the music enthusi-
asts and the cultured rich who encourage
the Arts plunged about in the gathering;
and the Gaud Mayor’s little lady beamed
happily over yet another successful assem-
blage. Manager Gravestock brought his tall,
good-looking wife, who was accompanied by
a blue-clad Craig girl from Wellington
(M.L.). Rosina’s sister, Clarice Buckman,
basked in reflected glory and grey tailorings.
The Peep-show Baker couple drew like a
magnet, her wide-apart eyes and delicate
complexion shadowed by a drooping crino-
line straw hat of cherry-red tones.
Artist Thea Proctor, who brought a
young junoesque cousin, Hera Roberts
and Mrs Bertie Kelly were other
striking instances of interior decoration.
Pianist Percy Kahn and ’cellist Adelina
Leon were kept busy greeting old friends;
Mrs. Holman was mostly a wide hat and
white fox furs; the Hughes lady and Mrs.
Monte Severn camped in other dug-outs in
the crowded rooms; and Mr. Layton and
Mr. Horsfall respectively demonstrated the
cheerful and the impressive nature of a semi-
civic reception.
Frances Hope Bligh, of Burwood (she’s a
direct descendant of N.S.W. Governor Bligh),
is wearing a brand-new diamond hoop, re-
cently bestowed upon her by Hugh Webster
Urquhart, of Ceylon.
The Society of Artists’ smoke-night threat-
ens to blossom into one of the social func-
tions of the year. It certainly was the swish
affair of last week-end. Parties even came
on from “Cairo” and the Buckman concert
for at least one whiff of the artistic atmo-
sphere. The long gallery of the Education
Department was filled with little white tables
and tobacco smoke, through the haze of
which white shoulders and white-shirt fronts
gleamed freshly laundered or stage-whited.
The evening bodice of the Victorian era that
slipped off rounded shoulders found a fas-
cinating demonstrator in Thea Proctor,
whose black velvet frock carried a top petti-
coat of white lace, and whose right hand
was embellished all thi’ojugh the night with
one of those black-and-white pluiney fans
with which, according to the art exhibitions
of that period, the handmaids of Egypt’s
Queen swatted the restless house-fly. Mrs.
Ernest Watt, in the greeny blue of a sea-
maid, sat directly beneath her own portrait
half the evening, with George the Creator
of the framed lady hovering in butterfly
fashion about the same panel. Simple souls
like Albert Collins and Howard Hinton,
swilled minute glasses of lager and tried to
look as though they would have made it
absinthe, only for the drink regula-
tions. Town-planner John Moore and
black-clad Gladys Marks discussed all
things and the causes thereof. Jessica
England protected herself from the night
with a .Paisley shawl and a very tall hus-
band. Hera Roberts, a good-looking cousin
of Thea Proctor, disported in yellow taffeta
that suggested the apparel of the ladies in
Meredith, who either billowed or sailed like
a swan into a room ; D. 11. Son ter came with
his wife and daughter, president Sydney Ure
Smith was chaperoned by his mother, and
an amber-ear-ringed daughter saw that
Julian Ashton left in time for the last train.
The Narkunda is bringing back in time for
the Melbourne Cup an immense crowd of
wealthy Sydneyites, who have been having a
good time throughout the English summer.
Amongst the number are the Reggie Allens,
who have been visiting the Walter Allens-
now permanently settled near London-—the
William McMillans, Jim Fairfaxes, Noni
Wilshire and James Alison, who has been
much about the West End with Mrs. Alex.
Hay and her sister.
Mrs. Phil Morton’s new shop in Rowe-
street (near the Australia - ) is expected by
her friends to be the very last thing in
taste, smartness and so forth. There is
plenty of money behind the venture, and
only the most expensive folks are to be
catered for. Many of the things, by the
way, that are to burst on an admiring world
during the coming Spring meeting, were con-
structed in a room at the Sep Levys’, which
Mrs. Sep placed at her friend’s disposal.
A string of motor-cars took the road to
Narrabeen on Saturday afternoon bound for
Furlough House, the holiday home for sol-
diers’ wives and children. The day threw
oft' its early morning wrap of grey cloud and
rain, and cheered up wonderfully, which fact
probably saved the committee from being
poleaxed by the enthusiasts who went down
to the annual meeting, over which Lady
Forster was the presiding genius. The re-
port and balance-sheet had the usual things
done to them in a long, pleasant room with
chintz-hung windows in one of the holiday
bungalows, from the windows of which could
be glimpsed a stretch of blue sea and sky
and wind-bent trees. The Fuller lady, on
whose shoulders the mantle of the untiring
but absentee Mrs. Cooper-Day has fallen,
proudly announced a surplus, and later
showed a pretty wit in smoothing the slightly
ruffled waters when benevolent John Stinson
innocently suggested to her Premier husband
that he employ his wife’s financial genius on
the Budget S’George, in his speech, re-
torted that his Government might show a
deficit this year, but next year he looked
forward to a surplus of £6OOO. “Then,”
said his lady, “we’ll expect you to hand over
two of your six thousand to our home.”
Deputy Town-clerk Layton, in nut-brown
tailorings, and the Granville Ryrie knight
were among the speech-makers; and after
her Ex. had gathered up all the ravelled ends
and woven them into a final resolution there
was tea on the verandah for the committee,
sartorially cheered by Gwen Fuller’s French-
grey tailorings and old-rose hat, and Mrs.
F. G. Waley’s black-and-white striped smart-
ness. The also-rans picnicked on the grass
ministered to by Boy Scouts, and viewed
admiringly by an audience of grey-and-black
goats and a friendly dog or two.
St. Paul’s, Chatswood, last week saw the
matrimonial gyves riveted on Marjorie B.
Anderson, third of the W. W. Andersons’
buds, and Clifford J. D. Love, by the grace of
the usual vows administered by Padre E.
Walker. The cake was cut amid a volley
of speeches, two of the brightest orations
coming from Capt. J. M. Banks, the 92-years-
young grandfather of the bridegroom, who,
by the way, is the only son of J. Clifton
Love, president of the N.S.W. Chamber of
Manufactures.
Pretty little Rene Rich filled the Town
Hall with her fiddle music the other night.
This youngster of 14 already has brilliancy
and warmth, and handles her bow in a
fashion reminiscent of Daisy Kennedy. A
Handel Sonata and a Wieniawski Con-
certo offered no difficulties to the white-clad
youngster, and her success can be measured
to some extent by an audience that waited
without exception through a triple encore
number at the close of the concert. Will
Dallison’s sweet singing and Henry Oenn’s
piano music were other joys of the evening.
This is May Moore’s latest picture of
Enid D’Arcy, who will lift her lyric soprano
at the Conservatori-
um on the 28th. She
is a Sydney girl,
although she owes
her vocal education
to Mary Campbell,
of Melbourne, who
was her sole guide
for four years at
Melba’s Conserva-
torium. After tak-
ing her A.C.M.M.
diploma she studied
interpretation from
Mrs. Levina Voller,
who used to appear
in lyric roles at the
Vienna Opera House.
Mrs. Hugh Ward is
helping with her
concert programme.
Powder and Patches went cheek-by-cheek
to the ball at the Wentworth the other night
for the benefit of the Little Citizens’ Kinder-
garten, which is the pet chick of the
Feminist Club. Most of the women stepped
back into the panniers, quilted petticoats
and powdered locks of the Pompadour period.
And one thing the straight-fitting bodice
proved was the necessity of a waist-line.
The modern healthy lass has grown too
thick around the mid-ribs to show the old
style to advantage. One stunning ex-
ponent of the wear of other days was
Sunday News Mrs. Liddell, with her Irish
coloring and erect carriage. Another belle
was Mrs. Ernest Watt as Polly Peachum,
or some other lass from “The Beggar’s
Opera,” iu a blue hooped dress and a flat
straw hat, a costume which carried oil the
second prize, the first prize going to a be-
powdered Rawlinson girl, who added some
old-fashioned seed-pearis to her outfit; and
the third to organising sec. Ruby Rich,
who tucked an old-fashioned berthe of
ancient lace into the rounded neck of her
lilac panniered gown. The Charlie Lloyd
Jones couple, who had brought on a party
from the Australia, the Knight Braddons,
and the John Mackay pair, from Kirribilli,
were among the guests of the committee, of
which the iudomitable Miss Preston-
Stanley, in the voluminous yet politically
hampering petticoats of the 18th century,
was president. Little Mrs. Alec Gordon,
who wore a black frock, over which
sprawled cabalistic signs in gold embroid-
eries, sported a floral fan woven of yellow
Iceland poppies. Tall Mrs. Osborne Eng-
land, who wore powder-blue brocade, and ,
had her hair in a powdered pompadour
that ended in a ringlet, secured a prize for
her fan of pale pink carnations and forget-
me-nots. George Lambert, in ruby-red
doublet and hose, a ruby necklet, and a
cloak that looked like a studio curtain hav-
ing a night out, represented himself as
“Morocco Bound,” or an old Venetian or
something; and a Piddington youth, in a
judicial wig, was law’n’order, Wonderful
pearl entanglements were worn by Mrs. Eva
Wunderlich, and Melbourne girl Gertrude
Dix, who had the night of her life, was all
blue and silver and tiny frills, as Pearl of
the Orient. Red-frocked Connie Stephens
and Roy Bryce, of Tasmania, were the win
ning twosome in the old-fashioned waltz.
Mrs. Sep Levy’s brother (his name is
Marks) had a remarkable bit of bad luck
the other night, for which his family are
freely denouncing the proverbially lax
police. As he was walking home through
Hyde Park a couple of thugs fell on him
and beat him violently about the head.
When he came to they had vanished, and
with them his loose cash.
Tenor Sydney Kingsley and Lenore Gra-
ham, the Melbourne girl who made a hit with
a chiid-pierrot show in that city some years
.ago, have folded up their last contract and
taken to teaching again. Lenore has bright
ideas about a dinkum Australian school of
acting for children, and Sydney isn’t wholly
disheartened about most of them.
The Wentworth staged another kiddies’
party one afternoon last week, the fancy-
dress flutter going to strengthen the financial
staff that helps along Tressillian, the mother-
craft centre. There were hundreds of beau-
tifully-dressed youngsters; and Dr. Truby
King and Innes-Noad, president of the Wel-
fare Society, must have felt intoxicated with
the draught of childish loveliness placed be-
fore them. The benignant Maoriland special-
ist has a winsome lass of his own who is a
first-rank advertisement for the Truby King
methods. A clown, who showed tricks all
the afternoon, and a Charlie Chaplin were
notabilities of a party brimful of happiness;
but the really great event was the bursting
open of the monster bon-bon that had dangled
tantalisingly from the ceiling, and the con-
sequent deluge of balloons. Lady Forster,
in frocking that was a nocturne in black
and gold, strolled in about half-time. Mrs.
T. PI. Kelly hostessed the outsize children’s
party of the day, and was run a close
second by Mayoress McElhone.
The Town Hall stage, which is usually
an arid expanse, was giddily decked with
bunting and palms and massed flowers for
Lilian Gibson’s farewell concert the other
night. She owns one of those contralto
voices that, according to Melba, can beat
the world; and, anyway, the artist’s own
townspeople have voted her ’cello-like notes
among the most popular in Sydney’s aviary
for four years. The programme showed artis-
tic judgment; and Lilian, plump and pink
satin clad, gathered in a truckload or more
of congratulatory vegetation which culmin-
ated in a ladder of fame, and a laurel wreath.
The Musical Association had one of its
reckless Bohemian gatherings in honor of
Rosina and her Maurice on Friday night
against a background of Farmer’s week-end
riot of bunting. These parties never vary,
except in the matter of the artist enter-
tained. The guests perch in rows more or
less uncomfortably on chairs; then a musi-
cal programme is let loose on their defence-
less heads, during which no man dare speak
to his neighbor. A little variation, such as
blacking out the lights, as in a movie house,
during the programme, would be a help to
the young, and should be included in the
association’s suggestion book. After the
programme and a few words from the Presi-
dent, the star stands in a prominent place
and the company files past, giving a catch-
as-catch-can handshake. Then on to the lower
floor, where refreshments of a strictly pro-
hibition nature are partaken of to the melody
of more speeches. Rosina. who was cuddled
in the depths of an ermine coat, replied to
the verbal bouquets showered on her in a
happy mixture of simplicity and sincerity
delivered in tones like melting gold.
Alfred Hill spoke of the hit Rosina
as a flapper had made in his own “Moorish
Maid and all the Maorilanders in the
room, Amy Murphy of “Chocolate Soldier”
tame photographer May Moore, the Hugh
I>. \\ ilson couple, and a choir of voung sing-
ing things from the Rickety Isles' burst into
applause that shocked the decorous china
into such quiverings as might have been
caused by au Auckland earthquake.
Mrs. Ellis Rowan’s collection of paintings
of Australian wild-flowers and the flowers
and birds of New Guinea, including magnifi-
cent paintings of birds of paradise
(painted for the first time in their living
state), was purchased by the Federal Gov-
ernment in June of last year, subject to the
approval of Parliament. However, the
matter is hanging fire, as most things do
in Parliaments when no votes are hanging
to them, and meanwhile the lady is very ill.
It is to be hoped that the recognition her
brilliant work has earned will not be deferred
any longer. All parties in the Federal
Parliament are in favor of securing the
collection for Australia ; and V'aucluse
House, Sydney, will be the ideal place for it.
The sale of reproductions of the paintings
would probably cover the initial cost of
purchase.
This is Martin Garrick, the Town Hall
orderly, whose eyes were seared b,v the spec-
tacle of worse than Cairene orgies at the
Artists’ Ball. The photograph was taken before
he went through
that night of shame
and horror; and. in
any event, the white
h airs which he
acquired between 2
and 3 a.m. would
not be discernible
in a block of this
size. When not
occupied being scan-
dali s e d at the
goings-on of artists
and their friends,
and writing reports
to the Mayor about
his experiences, he
perforins a multi-
tude of duties, all
more or less pic-
turesque. The sight
of him, on guard,
as it were, at the main entrance to the Town
Hall, has lent an added air of pageantry to
the, place since those long-dead days when
the Union and Australian Chibs were finan-
cial enough to give regular balls there.
Marion Marcus Clarke writes to her pal
Diana Wilson that she has appeared in two
American plays. The last, “The Rotters,”
had a fair run, and at present she is rehears-
ing for “The Great Way” in a really splen-
did part. In her spare time Marion is work-
ing hard re-writing her father’s “For the
Term of His Natural Life” for an American
film organisation, which has purchased the
rights, subject to certain little reconstruc-
tions. Marion returns to Australia after
"The Great Way” puts up its shutters.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Governor Nathan opened the exhibition of loan
pictures in the United Service Club Building on Thurs-
day for the Authors and Artists’ Association. Sir Walter
Davidson and Dame Margaret came with Sir Matthew,
and were received by the president, J. J. Stable,
Steele Rudd, Colonel Pye, Mrs. M. Forrest and Dr.
Cumbrae Stewart. Rain teemed, but the building
overflowed, and afternoon tea was handed round by
a committee headed by the wife of Bulletin
“Tarboy.”
In the evening a vice-regal party filled a box at
“The White-headed Boy,” and a large audience wel-
comed the Abbey players at His Majesty’s, whence
“The Bat” had flown the night before, leaving Bris-
bane in a state of pleasantly-agitated nerves. By
the way, so captured by the eerie atmosphere of
“The Bat” was one fair citizen the other night
that when Emma Temple arrived in the garret with
a guttering candle and a dignified air, a clear
soprano voice rang out: “Oh, let one of the men
go first!” I
Canopies of blue and pink billowed above their
exes, later in the evening at the South Brisbane
City Hill, where sweet-peas and stocks perfumed
the air. Dobbyns’ band made dance music, and R.
Diddams did the overseering.
Six gallant gentlemen were invested with the
Royal Humane Society’s medal in the grounds of
Government House, after a luncheon party which
included the Governor Davidsons, the Premier and
his wife, Justice and Mrs. McCawley, and a melange
of canons, colonels and captains. Two men of the
Daily Mail staff scored for rescues at Redcliffe.
On the 13th the E. 11. Macartneys lunched with
his Ex. Grammar School-master Bousfield and his
spouse tea-ed thirsting vice-royalty at the Exhibi-
tion during the afternoon of the Grammar sports.
Heavy rain failed to keep people at home, and
stoical Captain Hammond followed their Exes,
through the weather. Prior to the sports Sir Mat-
thew lunched a party at Government House, and he
also dined a number in the evening, including the
Governor Davidsons, General Sir Harry Chauvel, the
Cumbrae Stewarts, pretty Mrs. Espie Dods and her
doctor husband, Mrs. Leslie Corrie and A. J. Thynne.
In rose pink Miss Celia Cooper gave her recital
in the Albert Hall, and gathered in sheafs of vege-
tation and kudos. Her knightly father, all smiles,
made one of a large audience. Esm6e Dawson played
the piano, and Wynne Jeffries did the accompanying.

cßenew Tour Linoleum
Is your linoleum dull and deadlooking? Bring it back to life
and it will reflect a bright, clean, well-cared-for home. All you
need is Johnson’s Prepared Wax and a cloth. The Wax gives
a dry, glossy, dustless polish of great beauty and durability.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax brings out the pattern of linoleum
—preserves and protects it from wear. It doesn’t take long—
an ordinary sized floor can be polished in less than an hour
and it may be walked upon immediately. Waxed linoleum
and tile are easy to keep clean—they require but little care.
JOHNSON’S
Paste—-Liquid—Powdered
PREPARED WAX
Polish all your furniture, wood-
work and floors with Johnson’s
Prepared Wax. It forms a thin,
protecting coat over the varnish,
similar to the service rendered by
a piece of plate glass over a table
or dresser top. It covers up mars
and small surface scratches, and
prevents checking and cracking.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax is made
in paste, liquid and powdered form.
Use the Liquid Wax for polishing
furniture, woodwork, leather goods
and motor-cars. We advise the
Paste Wax for polishing floors of
all kinds —wood, linoleum, tile,
marble, &c. The Powdered Wax
will give a perfect dancing surface.

taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. Ao
liability is undertaken re contributions voluti
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
T.A.C.: All that to state in the baldest
way that # the book canvasser got a sale after prais-
ing the children... .J. It. (Hobart): “Telegram” not
our style. .. .S.J.L.: A creditable schoolboy essay
and no more. .. . N.N.P.: No use. .. .A.A.A.: “Spring”
goes over the old ground, and is marred by bad
rhymes, like “cover”-“over,” and ridiculous phrases,
like “the peaks yearn highward”. .. .8.C.D.: They
don’t sound attractive, and seem to be too long;
but we can’t guess what they are like from the fact
that somebody stuck the letter A on them. .. .M.A.M.:
Old commonplace in fair verse. .. .M.C. (Tomerong) :
It’s an old yarn, but not brilliantly t01d.... Enmac:
Not bad verse, but only says an obvious thing....
J.F.K.: Verses not up....1.G. (Gladesville) : Sorry;
none of them manage it.... Tardy M.: Verse not
good enough, and tale too thin... .F.G.J.: Wooden
verse. .. .Frieda F.: 'The wattle is getting a great
doing just now, but yours is about the severest slash-
ing it has had this Spring... .J.K.1.: Best-selling
rubbish is hardly worth discussing; and you say
very little. .. .E.W. (E. Malvern): The “Babu” is
not specially meritorious. ... A.N.8.: An interesting
enough letter ; but not interesting enough for print.
. ...E.A.S.: A long way off. . . .E.S. (Sydney): Com-
monsense should tell you that two initials are not
sufficient for identification... .Q.P.: Don’t care for
the sonnet. .. .Portia G.: Note the fact that the
great artist does not use ball-pointed pens and
talks highly moral commonplaces.... Peter D.: No
g00d... .H.W.L.S.: Verse too slight... .Vara: It
has a hint of quality, but is not well enough done....
N.H. (Bundaberg) : Sorry, not up.... Carisbrook:
Both miss.... Cygnet: Riding “the soul of equine
grace” is too theological for u 5.... John R.: “’‘Slush-
lamp” verses not up.... Emily B.: “Prescience” too
slight.... Ohatterton: Not quite... .J.G. (South
Brisbane): Your Muses are rather a commonplace and
conventional crowd.... Sweeney’s Mate: Only enough
in it for a par.... Deirdre: Excellently described;
but the yarn of the repentant card-sharper handing
back his loot is too improbable... .Jim McC.:
Rugged verse, and subject handled a few years too
late... .Union Jack: What sort of an ear have you
got to rhyme “brown” with “own” ?... . J.W.
(North Sydney): The sonnet has a sporting chance.
....A.J.W.: Doesn’t get near.... Alice N.: Feeble
little flutter. .. .D.R.W.: If roses and cabbages
could exchange names, what a lot of bad verse would
be left unwritten.. . .A.McA.: Verse is in good shape
but gets to nothing. . . .Elsie B.: A long way off. .. .
John L.: Too rugged. .. .Michael 0.: The idea is
better than the verse. .. .J.G.M.: Not up. .. . J.D.G.:
Dozens of better verses on the same theme have
failed.... Bellerive: “In the Grip of a Crocodile”
shows all your old power:—
With presence of mind—
In he’s awful plight,
The settler brave for —
He’s life did fight.
In the fierce combat to —
A chance he did trust.
In the creature’s eyes—
He’s thumbs he thrust.
Blinded and dazed,
It writhed in pain.
Released its hold —
And charged again.
Man and reptile—
With fury and might,
I In the rank lagoon
Did grimly fight.
When the settler brave —
To the banks did wade,
And exhausted sank —
In the sheltered shade.
. ...F.W.: Yours are what might be called poems
of rapid action. Sample:—
The ship sailed on, right for the land,
The crew’s hearts were in their mouth.
Just then she ran upon the sand,
The steering gear had all gone south.
The cannibals crept along the beach,
Dressed in colors so gay.
As soon as we were within their reach,
They pounced upon their prey.
They marched us far back in the shrub,
Then they built a fire there.
They were going to roast us for their grub,
And little did we care.
The Captain was the first to go.
Our turn was coming next.
“Not tasty enough,” said the Chief, and lo
He did look vexed.
Then he picked on to me, he said I looked nice,
So into the pot I went.
Action was necessary, no time to think twice,
For on escaping I was bent.
So I sang them a song, as I’d never sang before,
As I stepped out of the pot.
And I danced, though it was to me a bore,
For the surroundings were very hot.
My mates followed suit, and we danced out of sight,
Then I woke up with a start.
’Twas all a dream, to my delight,
Though it played upon my heart.
.... .C.H.E.: Not enough in it to carry the irregu-
larities Quiz: Not up.... Mavis M.: Moral com-
monplace in wretched verse... .Harry M.: Rough
verse.... J.S.: Doesn’t shout for print... .D.T.: Very
thin.... Anna C.: All are too extravagant R.R.:
Most girls of sixteen can write better than that....
Made to Order: It isn’t much of a yarn, but better
handling might have carried it... .H.C.R.: No use.
....Wandering Plumber: Nicely done, but wants
more point... .Jack A. W.: As it’s your “last verse”
let it loose: —
Detectives know the dangers
Which brood in lonely lanes,
Where horrid hoodlums do collect
Who’d batter in one’s brains.
They taketh long precautions,
And know ’tis first-rate “biz,”
To duck their blocks like lightning,
When the sandbags whirl and whiz....
The pistol and the darbies,
In case of a collision —
The ’tecs all state are simply great.
To bring to requisition.
... .Red Pal: Just says the old things... .A.R.W.K.:
That has been said about 17,596 times already
W.J.M. (Eastwood): Verse poor; yarn dreadful....
G.H.G.: Yarn no good. Don’t write on two sides
of the paper. . . .W.M.8.: The “versical contribution”
doesn’t get near W.H.H. (or some other initials
that look most like that) : Wallow and bump verse
of the worst sort G.A.L.: Far too rough.
TO ARTIS ITU (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.S.H.S.: Nowhere near it A. J.: Will use one.
T.G.: Amazing essay in women’s feet....
J.W.S.: Better study figure drawing for a while....
G.A.: Below the mark C.P.T.: Even a lord
couldn’t look like that Tommit: Deformed clerk
can’t get past.... J.G.: All miss 5.8.: Bad
drawing G.H.: Still too wooden.,. .K.W.M.:
Nothing like him... .D.M.: How the deuce can that
glass stand without spilling the bubbly?
A POPULAR PAINTER.
THE VISITOR: “Jove, old chap! How did you manage to get such a beautiful model?"
THE ARTIST: “Well, you see, I just announced that I was going to paint a lady eating
HILLIER’S CHOCOLATES, and all Sydney wanted to sit for me.”

DENTAL
CREAM
How do you destroy
the film on your teeth?
The actual film on the teeth does not, in itself,
cause decay. It simply provides a “Pleasure
Resort” for colonies of Germs to do their deadly
work.
Remove this film! You MUST to save your
teeth! Common sense implies that scouring the
film away with grit obviously wears away the
enamel, too. Yet many people are unconsciously
using a dentifrice which contains grit.
There is no grit to harm your teeth in
DENTAL CREAM
It keeps your teeth naturally white and in its
composition are all the properties of thorough
mouth hygiene.
Dentists throughout the world recommend
Kolynos. They know that no other dentifrice
cleans, protects and preserves as Kolynos does.
If you have not tried Kolynos Dental Cream,
send to the nearest agent for a free sample to-day.
Please send me a free sample
of Kolynos Dental Cream

The Abandoned Mine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLD mine, that in a golden year was
born;
Whose poppet-heads above the tim-
ber lifted .
Those wheels we kept in motion night and
WheiTgoid was showing in the ore we
shifted *
Below your dumps the flooded crosscuts
weep, .
For life is blasted from your stopes and
No rock drills gnawing in your woi kings deep
Now court a reef’s surprises.
The air is foul below. No fracteur smoke
Comes rolling upwards from youi lowei
levels; .
From faces where the richest ore was
broke.
And sturdy miners toiled like sweating
devils. „ , _ .
Gone are the truckers of the flying gang.
The drones who loitered in secluded places ;
And all 1 see of them whose laughter rang
Are faint and fleeting traces.
In dripping sections now the fungus creeps
Up saddlebacks and stulls, along the rail-
That fence an open pass, adown which
sweeps ...
The poisoned draught, where erstwhile
swept the tailings,
Filling a gaping stope, by miners made
To serve a greedy mill, nor still its plead-
ing.
While over twisted lines of doubtful grade
The loaded trucks kept speeding.
Wild birds are nesting round your battered
While I*up' 1 *up' and down the shaft the blind
bats flutter;
When drifting clouds the autumn skies
efface
Among your twisted beams the hoarse
winds mutter.
On starry nights, or when the full moon
lays
Its lustre on your cabled ropes, yec
hanging,
I seem to see your furnace fires ablaze,
And hear the knocker clanging.
I see no more a cloud of steam outblown,
As through the hot exhaust it grinds and
rages;
Nor watch the loaded trucks of broken stone
Shoot skyward from the gloom in drip-
ping cages. . ,
Your engine-shed is but a ruined pile,
Wherein the racing drums kept taut the
cables,
When youth beheld the sun of fortune smile
And kiss its painted gables.
Where miners once assembled for the shift,
Around the smithy shop with red fires
glowing,
The tossing plumes of slender saplings lift.
And weeds on long-neglected paths are
growing.
Old forges crumble under twisted frames
Stripped-bare of all their garments corru-
gated-
Ah ! barren days have quelled the dancing
flames,
And nights are evil fated.
And heavy sledges beating out the steel
No longer i,n the dewy morning greet
them-^-
Nor tramping homeward to their evening
meal
Do laughing children scamper forth to
meet them—-
The men who blazed the track and reared
the mill,
Whose thunder called the toilers and the
trampers
To work the reef below the pick-scarred
hill
And feed the heavy stampers.
Alas! old mill, whose turmoil shook the
slope,
I see your twisted beams and columns
spreading.
Neglected in a land of perished hope.
Which hears no more the soufid of steel
shoes treading
The sulphide ore to gild those streaming
plates
Whose wooden bearers now are torn
asunder.
For wealth is eaten from the concentrates.
And silenced is your thunder.

GERARDY.
Two and Lena.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PETER flung out from the lighted
verandah, where the gramophone
blared waltz music to half-a-score of
dancers. Lena was there, dancing with the
white stranger—she had laughed, not ill-
pleased at his unconcealed jealousy.
It was intense moonlight. The road
twisting away through great trees was a
medley of shifting darknesses, laked fantasti-
cally with glimmering silver. On the stretch
of grass between the beach and the road the
shape of a cutter hauled up for repair loomed
grotesquely. He came to a halt by it and
flung himself down where the shadow' lay
deeply. He was in no mood for any soci-
ably-inclined passer-by.
It was his first night after a year’s
absence from the little settlement that had
seen the greater part of his life. He had
worked awhile in Levuka, but the latter part
of the year had been spent on the trading
cutter Tui Lau. Lena had cried when he
left —she had given him a scarlet silk hand-
chief, and a photo that showed her awkwardly
coquettish in a straining muslin dress and a
big hat with limp flowers. He had treasured
that photo, had set it up in a tortoise-shell
frame to brighten the dingy cabin he shared
with the half-caste captain. He had writ-
ten often to her, pouring out his heart in
clumsily-spelt, sincere letters that she had
answered now r and again.
It may have been the white blood in him
that drove him —something in the sea called
passionately to him. He had at times queer
longings for the sheer ocean spaced and the
shores beyond. There had been the bis
barque they had passed scarcely a week ago,
lying passive in Suva harbor, a thing of
beauty in the still dawning. He had felt
a moment’s tierce desire to know and see the
roads she had sailed and would sail again.
There was in him some unconscious response
to beauty and the stir of adventure. It
drove him to weird tunes on the cutter’s
ancient concertina in the long calms, when
the island sailors sang for wind. The Tui
Lau had no auxiliary. There had been a
cloud once at dawn, a white cloud on the rim
of the sea —like the dancing girl he had seen
once in a picture half forgotten, a dancing
girl poised a moment in a lovely drooping
attitude. Lena had not been at all inter-
ested when in fumbling, clumsy words he
had tried to tell her of the wonder of it —
the remote beauty he could not put
into the words he desired. Peter started up
so suddenly out of the darkness that a small
hoy, passing with a basket of pineapples,
took him for a tevoro —the island devil —and,
dropping his burden, fled with a wild howl.
lie was sullen the next day, and uncom-
municative. Moala, his mother, laughed at
first at his silence, but when she could get
no speech out of him she became vehement
and at last abusive. Voluble herself on every
occasion, the taciturnity he had inherited
from a derelict white' father exasperated
her. But, for the life of him, Peter could
not keep away from Lena. Afternoon found
him hanging about outside her . home —the
red-roofed house wearing so unmistakably
the half-caste air. But, though the creak-
ing gate swung half open, he lacked courage
to enter. He stood, awkward and hesitant,
a shock-headed youth in Levuka-bought
clothes that hung haggily to his lankiness,
with the scarlet handkerchief, Lena’s part-
ing gift, knotted about his young, brown
throat.
There was a sound of voices. Round the
corner of the house a little procession came
slowly. Lena’s white grandfather shuffled
into sight, followed by Lucia, with a canvas
chair and a little Fijian child trailing a tat-
tered cushion. It was the old man’s latest
whim to sit out in the shadow of the great
tree by the gate, and stare grimly at the sun-
splashed road. He was a tall old man —an
overbearing old man, who. even now, though
age had come relentlessly on him, tyrannised
over the whole household. At the sight of
Peter, sheepish by the gate, he broke into a
grim chuckle of amusement that jerked his
old throat up and down. Lucia looked kindly
across at him; but Peter, reddening now
under his brown slcin, got past somehow,
and, still hot with discomfiture, made his
way to the side verandah.
It was cool and shadowy there, though out-
side the afternoon sunlight lay golden and
the lime-tree was a mass of quivering lights.
There was a Sunday Stillness over it all. On
the rickety step Lena’s sable kitten drowsed
in a patch of sunshine.
Lena herself was nowhere in sight, but, as
he stood there, her gay voice floated out to
him in the lilt of an island air. “Tofa-tofa”
Lena sang, and stopped suddenly ; and in
his mood he took the words for an omen, for
tofa means farewell.
She trailed out a moment later. She
had been drying her hair, and it hung thick
and lustrous to her waist. In the shadowy
coolness she was a vivid piece of color; her
green petticoat fell from a low-cut yoke to
her tanned ankles. Under the great scarlet-
barred towel she had flung over her shoul-
ders her bare arms showed smooth and
golden-—on one of them a silver circlet,
some Indian woman’s gift, shone faintly.
Peter looked dumbly at her. She gave
him a careless smile and sank down in the
slant of light. Her loose hair flooded out
to it, and the kitten, dislodged, climbed purr-
ing to her shoulder. Something of last
night’s vehemence stirred in Peter as he
looked down at her. She didn’t care —she
was changed altogether from the Lena of
his memories. And here he stood, tongue-
tied, while she sat indifferent. But as she
looked up smiling lazily at him—some latent
caution in her impelled her to hold him —
the old enchantment came back. He dropped
awkwardly on one knee beside her on the
rickety step. “Oh, Lena!” he said, a year’s
longing in his tone. But she leaned away.
“Sa!” she said. “Peter, you are not to
be silly.” But she was laughing.
Peter sat on the lower step; he drew a
little cardboard box from his pocket. Lena
bent forward fascinated and the fragrant
darkness of her hair fell all about him.
“Look,” he said, “I bought it for you in
Suva.”
There was worship in his tone. It
was a string of yellow beads, and the sun-
light struck flame out of them. Lena cried
out in pure pleasure. She let him slip an
arm round her as she played with them,
holding them up to glitter in the light.
“Lena, Lena !” —it was Lucia’s voice—
“ Here’s Henry Austin coining up the road.”
Lena started up hastily. A wave of rose
flushed her tinted skin.
“Oh, look at me,” she said. “My hair all
untidy. Let me go, Peter, quick.”
She broke impatiently from his arm that
would have held her back, and the frail neck-
lace, caught somehow' between them,, snapped.
The shining beads scattered and fell with her
swift movement as she flew into the house.
Peter looked down scowling at his for-
gotten offering. Lucia laid a fluttering hand
on his arm. He swung round, and, at sight
of his quivering face, her dark eyes misted
with quick tears.
“You do love her,” she said strangely.
“Oh, Peter!”
But he shook her light hand off miserably
and broke into hurt, vehement speech that
trailed into incoherent stammering as emo-
tion mastered him. Lucia stood, drooping
in the sunlight, a slim, quiet girl—like Lena,
but without her comeliness.
There w r as a rustle of silk as Lena ap-
peared again, her hair coiled up now and
caught with a glowing tortoise-shell pin, and
in a gown of —to Peter’s eyes—such splendor
that he shrank abashed. Even the tap of her
high-heeled shoes on the matted floor was a
sound alien and remote. He looked dumbly
at her and went. Lucia’s soft glance fol-
lowed him, but Lena had not even noticed.
On the scene of Peter’s miserable retreat
Henry Austin came treading with assurance.
He was a tall, fair-haired young man, and
he had a stilted way with him that Lena’s
grandfather had described as “dam’ uppish.”
But Lena’s eves found no fault in him.

Lame in the morning! A dull, throbbing backache all
day long! Worn out and discouraged when evening
comes! And to-morrow —the same old round of suffer-
ing! It’s little wonder that one is nervous and dispirited.
Yet to endure such misery is both foolish and unnecessary.
You want to be well, and the quickest way to get well is
to find the cause of your trouble and correct it. More than
likely it’s your kidneys. That dull, nagging backache
may be Nature’s first warning of some hidden kidney
weakness. You may have headaches and dizziness, too,
with sharp, stabbing pains, a depressed, nervous feeling,
and annoying bladder irregularities. Help your weakened
kidneys before it is too late. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands and should help
you. Ask your neighbors!
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish Baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. lam fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to me
to try. this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing, giving
quick relief, and gradually effecting a perfect cure. I feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

He had brought something unfamiliar and
delightful into her uneventful life. It was
as if their brief friendship, broadening now
—for her, at any rate —into something
deeper, had let vistas open to her unshaped
mind, tinged as it was with the
blending of two races. She looked
almost afraid into a glimmering, half-
imagined future that she felt dimly she
might fashion to her desire. It would mean
escape for one thing—discontent had been
rankling in her overlong. She had not been
unhappy—the years had passed too languor-
ously for that. But, of late, the vague un-
rest had stirred in her more often. The
infatuation of Henry Austin had shown her
a clear path. lie would marry her-—take
her away from it all. But—she loved him.
God knows what she saw in that stolid,
honest, rather affected youth, or with what
surpassing qualities her mind invested him.
Yet in her heart —though she tried to choke
it into silence —there lurked the knowledge
that she was not his mate —that the dark
strain in her blood removed her too far.
She came forward now, blushing her wel-
come. She let him take both her hands and
hold them a long moment; but before his
eyes, grown ardent, her own fell. She drew
away, trembling a 1 *ttle.
Into the momentary silence that had come
between them broke the tap-tapping of a
stick. It was Lena’s grandfather, shuffling
now in the room immediately behind the
verandah. He had a way of peering and
prying at anything left about. She could
hear him now pottering at the shelves,
mumbling to himself. She began to hope he
would go away again, for she had schemed
desperately to keep him anywhere out of
sight on these visits —one was never safe
with him. He had an unbridled tongue that
his age adequately protected. The least
ruffling, the least vexation was liable to
cause an outburst of abuse that, though it
was shrugged at by the easy-going natives,
had not made him popular with his few
white neighbors. He did not like Henry
Austin.
But, as Lena well guessed, her hopes were
doomed to disappointment. The tap-tapping
came nearer, the bead curtains parted, and
he stood looking malevolently in on them.
He was in a bad humor, too. It may have
been the kava that should at this hour have
been prepared for him. Peter’s coming had
put that out of her mind; and, as usual, the
unreliable kitchen-boy had forgotten.
Henry Austin, immaculate as always,
looked across at him, not concealing his dis-
gust. He was a grotesque old figure, in a
frayed and dirty dressing-gown, worn over
his pyjamas, with a torn panama hat atop of
his ragged white locks. He shook his stick
at Lena.
.“Pack o’ dam’ niggers,” he said. “House
full o’ dam’ niggers, and you can’t get one
of ’em to make me a howl of kava. You’re
too slack with ’em, my girl, too fond of
wasting your time with dam’ young fools.”
“Grandfather, grandfather!” Lena began
in distress. But Henry Austin, flushed and
indignant, took a quick step forward—his
dignity was a tender thing with him.
“Leave Lena alone,” he ordered heatedly.
“You’ll not bully' her while I’m here.”
The old man stared at him a moment —to
Lena’s amazement his sudden gust of temper
seemed to have flickered down into a curious
malice. His intent regard took in the
younger man’s immaculate white suit, his
precise tie and his spotless shoes. He began
to chuckle quite amiably—as if at something
that pleased him. But Lena shuddered.
“You’lJ be like roe in time, my lad,” he said
at last. “I might have come out of a band-
box once —before I married one of ’em.
You’ll come to it —sooner or later. They
all do—sooner or later.”
Out of the furious eyes of Henry Austin
there looked a queer momentary flicker of
realisation. He gazed for a moment as if
he saw r everything for the first time —the old,
malicious face peering at him, a.nd Lena
almost in shamed tears. Involuntarily he
glanced round the verandah that displayed so
pitifully Lena’s untutored efforts at decora-
tion. She could no more change the ap-
pearance of that house than she could change
herself—after all—a half-caste girl. He
stiffened, drew back in a strange movement
of repulsion. Then he shrugged it off; but
the girl had seen. She knew a moment’s
agony of defeat, a sickening sense of broken
hope—there was too much, altogether too
much, to fight against. She gave up, pas-
sionately, on the impulse that drove her.
“Oh, go, go!” she said ; and at her tone
the old man gaped, and Henry Austin swung
round amazed.
“Go—don’t ever come back.”
“You want me to go?” ihe said incredu-
lously. “You want me to go, Lena?” Pride
surged in him; he threw 1 up his head.
“I’m not the kind to come back, Lena.”
She looked at him —a quivering, long look
—and turned away.
But it was not till he had gone in anger
that she dropped to the crazy rocking-chair
by the table, and let her head fall on listless
arms. The old man looked down at her a
moment and Shuffled quietly out. But in a
few moments he wms calling querulously for
Lucia to bring him kava.
Peter came hesitating across the matted
floor. But Lena did not look up. Nothing
mattered. He put his hand caressingly on
her bowed head. A long sigh shook her—
but she let his hand stay.

“Out of Weakness..."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fTHERE appears to be a universal be-
lief amongst wearers of. the cloth
that beer is an instrument of the
Devil, but there is at least one cleric who
believes, like General Booth, that Satan
should not be allowed to monopolise the
pleasant things.
The Rev. Phineas Pinochle, rector of one
of the most fashionable parishes in Sydney,
having decided that—but, in justice to the
holy man, it would be better, perhaps,
to tell the story from the beginning.
When the Australian activities of the
famous “Pussyfoot” Johnson culminated in
the triumph of the “Drys,” the brewing tirm
of Souse and Stonker was hit very hard,
They had believed that the whirlwind Yankee
campaign was merely a demonstration in-
tended to placate subscribers to the Prohibi-
tion movement, and that it would go the way
of many previous agitations of the sort,
Souse and Stonker had acquired huge
stocks at very low prices, from their
less optimistic rivals, and when prohibition
became a fact they were burdened not only
with a huge quantity of unsaleable material,
but with the necessity of meeting their lia-
bilities in regard to their acquisitions.
The name of Stonker had only graced the
firm’s stationery for about a year previous
to the opening of this story. Prior to his
elevation he had been the brewery chemist,
and it was only the wish to place him above
the temptation of trade enemies that had in-
duced Souse to receive him as junior part-
ner. Like most methodical men, Stonker
had many plans for the future, and the
advent of prohibition threatened to disturb
most of then*, lie recognised the necessity
of discovering a method of disposing of the
accumulated nectar. But how and where?
The law prohibited the sale of alcoholic
liquors, and beer certainly came within that
category. Ruminating thus, lu* was sud-
denly struck by the great idea. The new Act
said nothing about Solids, and to a chemist
of his ability this made the solution quite
simple. He decided to solidify the beer.
After some experiments, the desired end
was achieved. Beer could now be carved
with a bacon slicer and eaten as a sand-
wich, or used as a substitute for chewing-
gum. The brain that could accomplish
such a feat was not to be baulked by the
difficulty of disposing of its fruits. He
established a chain of “Souse and Stonker’s
Dainty Delicatessen Departments,” at which,
on the production of considerable currency
and certain secret signs, fche initiated could
obtain sandwiches of most satisfactory
quality.
The Reverend Phineas Pinochle was
gravely troubled. He had, while still a
curate, become engaged to Miss Ophelia
Bung, then a comely wench who admitted
to 27 summers, Six years had passed with-
out sufficient improvement in their financial
position to warrant the adventure of matri-
mony. Ophelia had now to admit to 33
summers, or, more particularly, to judge by
her appearance, winters. She was of the
chnging-vine type, and hardly the ideal
assistant in the shepherding of the ewes of
his fashionable flock. Candidly, Phineas
was not enthusiastic, and, besides, the Arch-
deacon s daughter had smiled on him to
some degree. There were only two courses
possible; either to jilt the lady or to accept
the same fate that he had helped to mete
out to so many other unsuspecting males in
his time. Being a man of honor, he de-
cided, after many hours’ meditation, to
accept the former, and with a resigned air
set out for the abode of his once-beloved.
Having subdued the spirit, Phineas re-
membered that his pre-occupation of the
morning had caused him to forget both
breakfast and lunch. He was hungry: in
fact, he was very hungry. Coincidentally,
he was at the moment in front of one of
the “Dainty Delicatessen Departments.” He
entered and ordered some sandwiches. While
the assistant was enumerating the varieties,
two things happened to the Reverend Pin-
ochle. His left ear itched with annoying
persistence, and he, very naturally, inserted
a linger to relieve the irritation. As he
did so, a speck of dust settled in his right
eye and caused him to wink violently. To
say the salesman was astonished would be
to under-rate his feelings. lie murmured
something that sounded suspiciously like
“Dam’ parsonical humbug,” and handed over
a neatly-tied packet labelled “To be eaten
lying down.”
By the time he had consumed the first
sandwich, Pliineas had enlisted the interest
of a policeman in a discourse on Coueism
as a cure for senile, decay, and, having re-
duced the guardian of the law to a state
of mental chaos, he proceeded to demolish
the second. lie wandered along through a
forest of telegraph-poles and verandah-posts
until he was confronted by a much be-
draggled dame, who separated him from the
third by means of a most pitiful tale. Phineas
wept sympathetically over the lady’s
troubles, while she. visibly cheered, prodded
him in the ribs with a bony forefinger and
admonished him for a "naughty, naughty
parson.” In a moment of charitable impulse,
he invited the derelict to accompany him
to the domicile of his future mother-in-law,
who, he believed, would be able to suggest
some method of alleviating her distress. The
door was opened by Miss Ophelia Bung, who
closed it again with considerable firmness
after a comprehensive glance at the happy
couple without. Thus was the name of
Bung forever excluded from the genealogical
tree of the Pinochles.
Meanwhile, only comparative peace reigned
in the episcopal dovecot. The Archdeacon
had mooted the advisability of a matrimonial
alliance between his daughter and our hero.
But the girl had hesitated because, she said,
“he was so dull and uninteresting.” They
decided to allow the matter to rest for the
time being, and set out to attend the evening
service.
Phineas arrived just as the curate finished
his sermon, and he hurriedly prepared to
make his customary weekly announcements.
After clearing his’ throat preparatory to
commencing, he collapsed into a sitting posi-
tion, from which he leered helplessly, albeit
benevolently, upon the assembled congrega-
tion. Two sturdy sidesmen, in whose breasts
the incident awakened memories of the “good
old days,” helped him to the vestry, and the
curate gave forth that the rector had been
seized with a sudden illness. The Arch-
deacon’s daughter was not deceived; in fact,
the Pinochle stock rose a hundred points in
her estimation, and when, some time later,
the rector laid siege to her affections, he
had an easy victory.
Nowadays, the abode of the Reverend
Pinochle is the Mecca of those weary pil-
grims amongst his flock who seek comfort
and a temporary release from the burdens
of life. And, be it said, that few leave the
portals whose eyes do not shine with the
evidence of a joy within.

A Saw that stands the racket
of High Speeds and Hard Cuts
—be sure of that!

Ask for “Book of
Saivs” and special
steel book, “Balfour’s
Hints on Steel.” They
are post free.
SAW experts are emphatic that Crucible Cast-
Steel is the only steel that successfully
stands up to high' speeds and hard cuts. Every
inch of “An Eagle on a Globe” Saws is Sheffield’s
finest Double Extra Crucible Cast-Steel. “An
Eagle o,n a Globe” Saw can be trusted to do its
job—to succeed even where high-quality saws have
failed.
“An Eagle on a Globe”
CIRCULAR SAWS
are installed in most of Australia’s leading mills
for this reason. They are consistently depend-
able. The steel is right. The tension is right.
Iney hold their edge abnormally well, and give
highest cutting service to the last inch of steel.
An Eagle on a Globe” Saws are made in Aus-
tralia from blanks produced in our own Sheffield
works. We can supply from 4in. diameter
upwards. Any size hole or gauge. Fifteen stan-
dard patterns of teeth —and the price is fight.
Remember the name—“An Eagle on a Globe”—the
best saw money can buy. Send us vour enquiries
now.

Which Nib?
Some prefer a fine nib, some
a medium, others a coarse, stub,
oblique or turned-up nib. Which-
ever YOU prefer can be matched
exactly in a Waterman’s Ideal
Fountain Pen —matched not only
in its point but in its flexibility and
action. Whoever supplies you with
the pen will gladly exchange the
nib until you are exactly suited.
