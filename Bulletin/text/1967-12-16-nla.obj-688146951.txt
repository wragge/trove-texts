ONE MORE
WEEK
TAKING HEART
AFTER THE South African heart
operation one can’t help but be worried
about the popular-song industry. You
must realise that at least 40 percent
of pop songs contain the word “heart.”
No longer do they sound loving.
Indeed, they even sound rather sick.
Just to mention a few of the 100,000-
odd heart songs there’s “You Gotta
Have Heart,” “Haunted Heart,” “My
Foolish Heart,” “My Heart Beats Like
a Drum,” “You Ain’t Got No Heart,”
and “You Can’t Tell a Lie To Your
Heart.”
Others are more troublesome and one
wonders whether it will be possible ever
to play them again: “Give Back My
Heart,” “You Are My Heart’s Delight,”
“Heart In Your Eland,” “You Belong
To My Heart,” and, even worse, “My
Heart Belongs To Daddy.”
In future heart songs will need to
be more clinical, with such titles as:
“I Do Admire Your Left Ventricle.”
Or perhaps “You Oughta Have a Nicer
Aorta.”
KEEPING IT CLEAN
ADELAIDE’S FESTIVAL continues
to run true to form. The South Austra-
lian Theatre Company has not only got
rid of its director, John Tasker, but has
abandoned plans to produce for the
Festival Brecht’s “Puntila” and John
Whiting’s “The Devils.”
The official reason is that no theatre
is available, but it is not given with any
seriousness. Everyone knows that dis-
cussions by the Company with the Fes-
tival began long before theatres were
allocated.
The point seems to be that “Puntila”
has a scene in which two gentlemen
gently urinate, while “The Devils” con-
cerns a 17th-century French priest who
had no scruples about bedding his
parishioners. Displaying cultural broad-
mindedness, and bearing in mind the
high artistic aims of their Festival, the
Governors have now definitely arranged
that Marlene Dietrich will perform
where devils fear to tread.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROBLEMS
ROBERT MOORE of the ABC’s
“Four Corners” probably intended to
set down a reasonable and construc-
tive view of the program and his con-
nection with it last week, but mainly
sounded grouchy and depressed. How-
ever, there seems little doubt that the
ABC is well aware of one lack which
Moore mentioned -- the shortage of
good people.
They have carried on lengthy and
apparently sympathetic discussions with
Moore in an effort to retain him, al-
though “Four Corners” is now gone
definitely to Sam Lipski. This move
leaves a gap in “This Day Tonight.”
Lipski’s editions were often tougher
and, it seemed, more intelligent than
Ken Chown’s, so the move, unless a
first-class replacement is found for
Lipski, may mean a cosier, watered-
down “This Day Tonight” next year.
Also, after Moore’s disheartening ex-
periences at “Four Corners” it would
seem essential that Lipski remain either
in front of or behind the camera. So
the ABC has so far really only solved
half of its “Four Corners” problems.
RESTORED
EARLY IN THE PIECE we stopped
thinking of William Boustead as an art
restorer, and mentally gave him a white
uniform and a stethoscope. Rather dis-
armingly, he said he thought of paint-
ings as people with ailments, some
chronic, and bacterial infections. Indi-
gestion? we asked, but he was busy
with his microscope, which he said was
worth an astonishing amount of money.
We were at the rear end of the Art
Gallery of N.S.W., a kind of out-
patients’ department into which came
damaged paintings from all over Aus-
tralia.
Behind us hung Five Seasons, whose
recent X-rays showed an advanced stage
of cracking and bad structure. Mr.
Boustead and his staff had been work-
ing on it for 18 months, which is
formidable, considering Five Seasons is
merely attributed to Guercino.
“Restoration, or the more modern
concept of conservation, is an all-
consuming job,” said Mr. Boustead. It
finally ate into his former passion for
painting and sculpting, and he became
obsessed with the work of the Old
Masters. Now he spends his weekends
cutting tapes on the subject for his
cadet students. He scratched his grey
hair, an 1 remarked that he got caught
up with restoration in an odd way with
a background of the National Art
School via the Army. The Australian
Government had awarded him a
scholarship to study abroad after he had
invented a vacuum press to treat flaking
canvases, now in use around the world,
which a German later patented and
made a great deal of money from.
Since his return to Australia, Mr.
Boustead found himself wishing he had
all that wonderful equipment he’d set
up in Florence. He has been back a
week, after spending nearly six months
on loan from the Australian Govern-
ment restoring work destroyed in the
Florence flood. When he arrived with
his French-speaking wife, Eleanor, who
knows something of restoring, the
Italians blessed him for his specialised
knowledge on mould, a benefit of living
in a sub-tropical climate. He was
immediately given the most depressingly
damaged prints, which lay in sodden
bundles, further tainted when the sewer
and oil tanks burst during the flood.
Mr. Boustead and his wife could
have cried when they saw them first.
But soon they busied themselves with
setting up a new print-restoration
department in Florence, with the res-
ponsibility of spending the Australian
Government’s gift of $30,000 on equip-
ment and on training a staff to take
over. It is now the best-equipped print-
restoration department in the world.
Mr. Boustead estimates he restored
nearly 300 maps, prints, and documents.
It will take many years before the col-
lection is restored.
The Italian Government has invited
Mr. Boustead to return for a short while
next year. We asked him if he had
ever caused serious damage to a paint-
ing by using the wrong chemical solu-
tion. He had. But then he said he was
like a surgeon and was able to use
emergency techniques and knowledge
to iron out the mistakes.

What did Melbourne’s
biggest office building
say to Alcoa aluminium?
“Colour me Duranodic”
The A.M.P. Society’s St. James project,
now under construction in Melbourne,
represents the first massive order for
Alcoa’s newly-introduced Duranodic 300
permanent colour finish for aluminium.
The architects were looking for two
qualities in the material to be used for
doors, windows, entrances, shop fronts, etc.
1. Optimum resistance to weathering
and wear.
2. An attractive bronze colour.
Alcoa Duranodic provided the ideal
answer.
Throughout the world, Duranodic 300
finishes are defying extremes of climate
and hard wear. Duranodic 300 finishes
permeate the metal’s structure to give
in-depth colour. They provide a richer,
harder finish which is colourfast,
permanent and more lustrous in colour.
They are a product of Alcoa research
specially developed for architectural
exterior and interior surfaces where wear
is excessive and maintenance is difficult.
The selection of Alcoa Duranodic,
immediately following its introduction,
for Melbourne’s biggest office building is
a quick and striking testimonial to its
superior qualities.
Duranodic 300 medium bronze is but one
of the permanent colour finishes available
for aluminium from Alcoa of Australia.

Open day at
the Opera House
Photographs by ROBERT WALKER


Each Sunday, the only day workmen are not there, about 1200 people make a two-hour
guided tour of the Sydney Opera House, for which, incidentally, they book in advance. They
cover a good deal of ground, aesthetically and literally, and ask a lot of questions, not all of
which get answered. It is all part of a new approach to letting Sydney people become
more familiar with their Opera House. Until a year or so ago, public relations was one of
the most unsatisfactory aspects of the whole affair.


Open day at the
Opera House
By SANDRA HALL
AS SOMEBODY said before the tour
even started, the guides who take
Sunday tourist parties through the
Opera House need the patience of
Job.
After all, what do you say when
someone asks you why they didn’t
build a second Town Hall for the ABC
instead of spoiling this? Or why they
want a reverberation time of two
seconds for the orchestra and only 1.3
seconds for opera? Especially when
your questioner follows this up with
the observation that in no other hall
he has ever been in has a two-second
reverberation time been attempted.
Our guide, supported by a few
sympathetic “tsk, tsks” from a group of
hatted ladies on the left, took the
straightforward approach. He replied
that he was no acoustics expert and
all he could do was put forward the
Government’s reasons for its decision
about the major hall.
Anyway, he didn’t know how it came
to be called an opera house in the
first place.
Between stops, he told us that about
1200 people go through the Opera
House each Sunday. Interest has been
so great during the past few months
that the public relations staff has hired
extra guides, himself among them.
“Most people who come know noth-
ing about it except for the fact
that there’s going to be no main hall
for opera. But the interest is there.”
One had only to look around to
see what he meant. We were no far-
ther than the car-park entrance before
one man started waving his arms and
calling it a work of art.
The guide, who was wearing a micro-
phone-megaphone gadget, provoked in-
dulgent laughter from the party when
he said he hoped no one would em-
barrass him with questions about com-
pletion dates and final costs. “Certain
radical changes,” he added, had been
made to Mr. Utzon’s original design
by the panel of Sydney architects
for instance, Mr. Utzon had made no
allowance for escalators and none of
the 11 lifts had been set aside for pub-
lic use in the original plan. There
would now be eight escalators and two
of the lifts would be for the use of
wheelchair patrons.
Mr. Utzon’s name kept cropping up
in the commentary from time to time.
Mr. Arup hadn’t agreed with Mr.
Utzon “about the necessity for great
unsupported spans in the entrance area
. . . the engineers had said the rock
was too soft, but Mr. Utzon insisted
. . .”, the panel hadn’t liked Mr.
Utzon’s split-level restaurant at first,
and, finally, “this is one of the most
difficult building jobs attempted any-
where in the world, and if they’d
The Opera House tour covers a good, deal of ground
known how difficult it would be be-
fore they started, it would never have
been built. It’s common knowledge, so
I might as well tell you.”
After mounting the 93-yard steps
(“the longest of their kind in the
world”), we took a look at one of the
shells, and the guide told us about the
white tiles. “Five-inch ceramic tiles,
love,” a woman in a blue raincoat re-
peated to her husband as if she thought
they might go nicely in their bath-
room.
An earnest young man in glasses had
an obscure technical question about
cables and tension which the guide
parried deftly, and we went on to
what was to have been the chamber-
music room.
A row of windows along one wall
gives an impressive view of the Harbor,
and there was a slight diversion while
everyone gazed down at a cabin cruiser
sailing by. Its passengers stared back
—sipping scotch and looking amused.
Mr. Utzon’s chamber-music room
was now thought too small. It would,
however, still be a music room, but for
small recitals only.
His air of philosophic resignation
about this and other might-have-beens
prompted a man behind us to say
facetiously to his girlfriend that the
whole thing would probably turn into
a floating restaurant by the time they
came again.
Another man was impressed, though,
saying he could now see “why it’s taken
so bloody long to finish.”
Earnest Spectacles had another ques-
tion about columns this time, and
somebody else wanted to know whether
the concrete had been “aer-e-ated” or
not, then it was on into the major
hall and the saga about its seating
capacity.
One woman wanted to know how
they were going to fill in the gaps be-
tween the shells, and somebody else
wondered which charity would get the
proceeds from opening night. “Forty
dollars a ticket or something, I sup-
pose.” “A hundred dollars more
likely,” her friend said.
On the way through the workshop,
the guide showed us the rehearsal room
and the recording studio which will be
made out of space originally meant for
the stage machinery. And the Woman
in the Blue Raincoat said she was glad
they hadn’t wasted that bit, after all.
But the last word on the building
was left to a male. He said somebody
would probably drop a bomb on it
before it was finished anyway.
Never mind, a grey-haired woman
said, it had been a lovely tour and the
guide was a walking encyclopedia.

The art of
upmanship among
the joggers
IS ALL THIS physical fitness business
starting to wear a little thin on you?
We have been told that Mr. Holt can
snorkel for 1| minutes underwater
without coming up for air. He prac-
tises holding his breath underwater in
the bath. Dr. Forbes does push-ups.
Billy McMahon is terribly earnest about
squash. General Risson of our Tram-
ways Board does daily exercises in his
boardroom.
And it’s all getting worse. Several
months back 10,000 Melburnians took
part in a mass “walk-around” at Albert
Park. The course was three miles. As
we go to press 3000 people are taking
part in a 20-mile walk from the Myer
Music Bowl to Dandenong.
Percy Cerutty has just announced
that we are all unfit and Australians
are a nation of alcoholics. The only fit
man is Ron Clarke. Percy Cerutty is
always saying we’re unfit and a nation
of alcoholics.
Then the other night a gentleman
in a green track suit jogged up to our
front door. He was carrying a briefcase,
which aroused one’s suspicions at once.
He gave a contemptuous look at your
correspondent’s flabby stomach, opened
his briefcase, and announced that a
physical fitness course was available at
Ron Clarke ... the only fit Australian
the nearby “health centre” for only
$l5O.
This would include a physical fitness
course under a League football cap-
tain, no less, foundation membership of
the gym, and a free track-suit. So that
is the Melburnian scene at the moment.
The encyclopedia salesmen are out. The
new breed are young gentlemen who
run from door to door offering expen-
sive physical-fitness courses.
The latest craze is for jogging. It is
a disease that has spread from the
United States and New Zealand. The
bible for this is the book “Run for
Your Life,” by Garth Gilmour, who
tells of all the middle-aged joggers in
New Zealand. Ron Clarke, too, has
written of a 58-year-old Melbourne
solicitor, Alf O’Connor, who runs 12
miles every morning before breakfast.
Alf O’Connor is Ron’s ideal.
We have been told that running is
the only real way of getting rid of
the fatty tissue around the heart. Well,
the trouble with your correspondent is
that he believes everything he reads.
He believed the SBX book for a while
until he got tired of running on the
spot 550 times. He even believed the
National Fitness book until he got
tired of pushing doorways apart and
squeezing steering wheels.
But that line about “fatty tissue
around the heart” was the one that
really frightened. So, lately your man
has been jogging around the suburbs
at 6.30 a.m. You would be utterly
astonished at the number of suffering
men who are out on the track at that
hour of the morning. Quite obviously
they are the ones who have believed
all this propaganda, because they are
all over 40, and have the same
haunted, worried, fearfully red-faced
look.
Among the joggers on our beat there
is an accountant who can’t sleep, a
travel agent who can’t keep still, a
paint dealer, and a stockbroker. Now,
if you are planning to do this, here is
some advice. The first problem to over-
come is the feeling of doing some-
thing ludicrous and that you are out
of your mind. All joggers have to
suffer this. Even John Landy tells the
story how he used to fit in his training
schedules at all hours of the day and
night. There was one occasion when
he was panting past a parked motor-
car. A character wound down the win-
dow and said: “Who the hell do you
think you are—John Landy?”
Then there is the tendency to think
that you are off to play tennis, so you
dress up in white shorts and all. This
is utterly the wrong approach. Experi-
enced joggers prefer to look like dog
trainers, and they wear corduroy trous-
ers and old pullovers. It is even better
if you can wear a track-suit. However
this must not be new. Boil it up at
least six times before wearing. If you
can, get hold of a very faded green
track-suit. Sew a badge on the left
pocket, then unpick it again. This
might give the impression to other jog-
gers that actually you did compete in

"Have a Cinzano Party Folder.
House Founded 1757
the Berlin Olympics, but now you are
a modest fellow who merely wants to
keep fit.
Another important point is to plan
your course carefully. Some streets
average three dogs to every four houses.
Some houses have two dogs. Now dogs
are intelligent creatures. They assume
that anyone who runs along a street
at 6.30 a.m. is behaving in a peculiar
manner, particularly if he is dressed
in battered old corduroy trousers. So
they raise the alarm and some even
attack. It is always possible to note the
passing of a jogger by the magnificent
oratorio of dog barkings.
Another point of advice is not to re-
veal how far you run every morning.
Joggers are notorious liars and there is
much upmanship. However, if pressed,
be ready. If, when running around
Caulfield racetrack, you are asked by
another jogger how far you go, reply:
“Actually I don’t live here at all. I
jogged over from Williamstown.” Your
correspondent has found that jogging
makes him immensely fit, far more
capable of handling the day’s tasks. The
only difficulty is that he has to sleep
at his desk at least until lunchtime be-
fore he is ready to tackle them.
But there is another disturbing point.
Recently in the London “Observer”
there was an item about a model
agency called English Boy which had
opened in London. English Boy dealt
exclusively with male models with 26-
inch waists and 34-inch chests. The
director of English Boy, Mr. Kevin
Webb, was quoted as saying: “All the
old-style male models looked like rug-
ger players. They all looked as if they
played tennis. The new-look man looks
like a poet.” Mr. Webb made it clear
girls were uninterested in men with
40-inch chests.
So what will happen now? Is jogging
the answer? Certainly, if Mr. Holt is
to gain the youthful, twig-like vote-
catching image, he had better stop
holding his breath under the bath
water.
“I’m tired of supporting your husband’s
fitness campaign!”

In Siberia, life
grows cheerier
and cheerier
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
“COME TO Swinging Siberia” is the
newest exhortation of Soviet travel
agencies. Tourists say modern Siberia
is a great place for cool jazz; and I see
no reason to disbelieve them. At jump-
ing joints such as the Young Com-
munist Rhythm Club in Irkutsk (says
U.S. journalist Bernard Krisher in
“Asia” magazine) teenage Reds twist
and shake “as though it were the most
essential part of their lives.” It is a
far cry from the days of the old monk
of Siberia whose life grew drearier and
drearier. Former visitors like Dostoev-
sky would hardly know the place.
Its transformation to a good-time
region has raised certain difficulties for
the Russians, of course. This was evi-
dent when a young offender named Ivan
Lurkiev was sentenced by a Moscow
court to five years’ exile to Omsk.
“Gas!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm.
“Lead me to those crazy Siberian
chicks!” The policy now is to send
prisoners to unpleasant places nearer
home. There is no point in giving
them a free trip to the fleshpots of
Siberia.
For the foreign visitor the country
has many attractions —museums of
ancient Siberian artifacts, bleached
blondes in bikinis sunbaking round Lake
Baikal, guided tours of workers’ clubs
at model saltmines. It is a humane
improvement on the old penal set-up.
Yet—one cannot help feeling that
Siberia has lost something. It no longer
has the power to excite shuddersome

jungles of Peru have had less lure since
the authorities stamped out the
shrunken-head industry.
In more advanced countries as well,
the amenities are relentlessly spread-
ing. We have concrete toilets now at
the foot of Ayers Rock —useful struc-
tures, but out of tune with the
Aboriginal dreamtime. I have never
been to Rome, but I long hoped to
see it, and especially the romantic sur-
rounding landscape of the Campagna.
Lately there came from Bernard Wall,
in his book “A City and a World,” this
report: “The Campagna, with its car-
pets of green grass growing over the
hollow tufa, and its aqueducts and
tombs and air of gentle melancholy
as Poussin and Claude liked to paint
it, is now disappearing for ever. Motor
roads have cut through it like knives,
broken its silence with the roar of
trucks and cars night and day, and
scattered it with gas stations and blocks
of flats.” Soon a tourist in search of
the atmosphere of antiquity might just
as well visit the Appian Way at Banks-
town, N.S.W.
But to return to the news from
swinging Siberia. The most successful
pop group there at the moment is the
Tomsk Tomcats, whose disc “Power
Station Baby” is No. 1 in the charts.
They feature the big new Siberian
Sound, which can be heard for miles
across the tundra on a clear night.
The feminine fashion scene is
dominated by Marishka Quantova. At
her Vladivostok boutique, Gogol Gear,
she does a busy trade in mini-furs and
thigh-high Cossack boots. Male in-
group Siberians are wearing op-art
caps and old Tsarist uniforms.
Inevitably there is a conflict of
generations in the new Soviet Asia.
Hip young people refer to their parents
contemptuously as “oldniks,” and
annoy them by wearing long hair and
smoking narcotic cigarettes known as
“potsch.” The elders say the swingers
are decadent and would benefit from
an old-fashioned stretch of forced
labor. The Gorky a Go Go crowd retort
that oldniks and squarovitches should
be exiled from Siberia to a more back-
ward region.
Strangely enough, in their choice of
television favorites the young prefer
clean-cut, athletic heroes like Ilya
Bondiakin, secret-agent star of the top-
rating series “The Man From
SMERSH.”
Life in with-it Siberia is wonder-
fully fresh and exciting for those who
like that kind of thing. Yet I can see
gay pacesetters doing the watusi any
night by switching on the cigarette
ads on TV. I doubt whether I shall
save up and go to Siberia to see gay
pacesetters doing the watusi at the
Irkutsk Young Communists’ Rhythm
Club.
Perhaps something has died in me,
but the more travel literature I read
the less I want to travel. Even though
the French are offering a package tour
of switched-on Devil’s Island.

Sue Becker
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
SHE CAN REMEMBER it now, says
Sue Becker in that Southern English
voice of hers that reverts now and
again to something geographically
higher and less classy, because it’s all
happening. She means the fortune-
teller she met at a party in South
Africa when she was 21 who told her
nothing would come of her music and
movement talents until the latter half
of her life.
So much has come of them in the
past four months that even priests lean
forth from their pulpits and exhort
parishioners to switch on and get fit
with Sue. Twice a week, to be exact,
on ABC television around the ungodly
hour of ten p.m., when she appears in
sexy leotards to instruct Australian fat-
ties on the long and difficult path back
to slimness via a handful of home-
grown ditties, some smoochy music, and
a set of tortuous exercises that she
says are easy when you know how.
She also writes a twice-weekly piece
for the Sydney “Sun.” Horwitz are pub-
lishing her book “Swinging Time” to
coincide with next year’s ABC televi-
sion series. And her latest happening is
Harry Miller as business manager. Fol-
lowing this major coup, he doesn’t take
anybody, you know, will be radio work,
personal appearances, lectures, and so
on.
Becker the Wrecker, as they used
to call her when she taught gym to
schoolgirls, lives at Wahroonga in a
rented bungalow with her seven-year-
old son, Paul she is separated from
her doctor husband Lord Nelson, a
mongrel dog, who appeared in the pro-
gram once, jogging with her up the
Pacific Highway at six in the morning,
a large cat, Smokey, who also appeared
as an example of what under-exercise
and complete relaxation can do for
you, assorted furniture, a cuckoo clock,
and non-stop ringing telephone, which
she is changing to a silent number: so
many people ring up with figure prob-
lems, but giving five-month pregnant
ladies or mothers with asthmatic chil-
dren exercises on the blower can’t be
done. They should write.

Average looking after her body and
learning to enjoy life . . .” Batty or not,
she adores being on air with kind Anne.
Let’s have another cuppa.
Sue Becker has on a blue linen suit.
Her hair is blonde, newly cropped, and
lacquered. Her nails are pearl
enamelled. No one, she says, recognises
her in the street; it’s all that television
make-up stuff they put on, but they do
know her voice. There’s no mistaking
that. By the way, please say how kind
the ABC is; they let her say anything
she likes and haven’t stopped her once.
It’s all unscripted; they never know
what she’s going to come out with.
Surprise, of course, is the secret of it
all. What will Sue be saying tonight?
everyone asks. Will she do one of her
ditties? Will she have a guest? What
will she be wearing when she strips
off? It’s all part of her formula: infor-
mation plus entertainment equals a
captivated audience currently around
the 500,000 mark. “I mean,” she says,
pouring her fourth, “Harold Holt’s
national fitness thing has rather died a
natural, hasn’t it, deah? What everyone
wants is to be lured into P.T., not
commanded. I reckon in the end every
viewer slumped in his armchair watch-
ing me sooner or later says, ‘All right,
Sue, I’ll give it a go.’ ”
She has given P.T. a go, after getting
her Diploma of Physical Education in
England, at various establishments for
young ladies around the globe. Even
in those days she wore fishnets and
pumps and used to say to the girls as
she caught them, “Mind you don’t
break my nails, deah.” Have we, by
the way, got a picture of her? Harry
Miller’s got all hers. She’s got a mar-
vellous Christmas special planned for
this week. She’s calling it “Sue’s Special
Caper Sauce,” and it all ends, after a
series of analogous ditties, with: “Swing-
time with Sue is your only hope, it’s
that or the last ritual, C of E or the
Pope.”
That, she says, is her favorite line.

How to gain choice
in foreign policy
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
THE APPOINTMENT OF Sir Henry
Bland to the Defence Department must
mean something or other. We know
that, with only six months to go before
it comes out with its next three-year
plan for the armed services, the De-
fence Department has not come up
with anything that really fits Austra-
lia’s changed circumstances. And that
what with its cumbersome structure of
committees, its interservice dealings, its
equal matching of service officers and
departmental officers, and its complex
of no less than five ministries our de-
fence planning is almost certainly in-
capable of anything approaching cost/
benefit analysis and rational allocation.
It would take them three years to plan
a three-year plan.
What is encouraging is that there
have been signs that they are beginning
to wonder in the Defence Ministries
if it might not be better to key defence
planning to overall diplomatic con-
cepts. This could produce a result that
would be more sensible than merely
shopping for bits of the very latest
equipment as if we were stocking up
with the newest domestic gadgets.
We have, as yet, not achieved mat-
urity in our approach to the armed
services. We understand that we should
have some basic arrangements that can
be expanded if we ever have to defend
our country. And, as one of America’s
allies, we understand that now and
again we may have to send some bat-
talions overseas as part of the price of
alliance. But what we do not yet take
into account is the use of military
strength (along with trade policy, eco-
nomic strength, and anything else we
can summon) in such a way that we
have some options in our diplomatic
policy. We live in a part of the world
in which we are, in comparison with
the others who live in it, immensely
rich. This gives us an opportunity to
exert influence in a way we have not
yet attempted. It is only by exercising
strength that one can have choice.
This is not a matter of “prestige”
but of trying to play a role of benefit
to the region where we live, and of
making that role such that, by playing
it, we ourselves become a better people.
Thus do democracies such as our own
assert values in a way which the early
critics of democracy said was impos-
sible.
Our economic strength enables us to
play this role, but economic strength
may not in itself be sufficient. To
give ourselves the widest possible range
of choices for the future (which is un-
predictable) we should develop a mili-
tary strength that, related to the mili-
tary strength of the region, will be
significant. This should be the real
basis of our defence planning. It should
include equipment considerations that
may not be related to our other role,
that of a faithful ally. The building-up
of our Air Force should not be seen in
terms of world war (we cannot plan for
a world war); nor in terms of alliance
(we should not risk our Air Force in
an ally’s battle); but in terms of gain-
ing significance for ourselves in our own
region. The building-up of our Army
should allow both the expedition of
battalions to our main ally and the
development of other battalions that
might be useful to what we hope will
be our allies in the region. Our
central diplomatic aim should be one
of peaceful co-operation between the
nations of the region. Anyone who sees
a paradox between the building-up of
armed strength and a declared interest
in peace has not seriously contemplated
the problems of peace-making.
In trying to find themselves a role
that gives them a sense of identity be-
yond that of being an ally of the
Americans, the Canadians have turned
to an internationalism in which they
act as a kind of super-Scandinavia.
Australia is faced with the same prob-
lem as the Canadians, with two differ-
ences. Because the Canadians are irre-
vocably tied to the future of America,
and we are not, their problem of de-
pendence is both greater and less than
ours. Apparently locked for ever in the
embrace of America, they develop more
intently than we do the anxieties that
come from the position of dependence;
however, their very dependence gives
them freedom of action. How could
America let them go? In our case an
overall strategic dependence is associ-
ated with an uncertainty as to its
future. It is possible for us to follow
courses independent from those of
America, but caution suggests that they
should be in parallel. An independent
initiative in our own region seems to fit
this prescription. While Canada can
find relief from its dependence in inter-
nationalism, Australia can find it in
regionalism.
There is certainly one lesson we can
learn from Canada. In their plans for
more integrated armed forces the
Canadians have broken away from the
old British concepts and turned toward
something like the Swedish pattern,
with a simplifying of divisions between
the services and a sharing of their over-
heads. Sir Henry Bland won’t have any
time to do anything about it for the
moment, 'but when his department has
labored and produced its three-year
plan he might care to begin the highly
necessary task of rationalising the
present divisions between the services,
so that we get more for the same
money.

AUSTRALIA'S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
Which way now
for the DLP?
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
IN POLITICS even success creates
problems. The very success of the
Democratic Labor Party, unmistakable
beneficiary from the recent Senate elec-
tions, has brought closer the moment
of truth when the DLP will have to
answer the jackpot question: “Where
now, brown cow?”
Is the ultimate aim of the DLP to
reunite with an Australian Labor Party,
purified on policy and personnel lines
as dictated by the DLP (as was un-
doubtedly the aim of the original
founders of the DLP)? Or is it to seek
to become a permanent political force
in its own right, forgetful of the nostal-
gic yearnings of its founders for a re-
conciliation with the ALP?
Personally, I am inclined to agree
with the intelligent assessment by Ralph
Gibson, who led the Communist Party’s
Senate team in Victoria, published in
the Communist “Tribune” of Decem-
ber 6.
Writes Gibson: “One interesting
feature of the DLP vote is its uni-
formity throughout the State. It is
lowest (at 12 percent) in Higgins
(Prime Minister Holt’s electorate), and
highest in Wills and Maribyrnong (21
percent), but in nearly all electorates it
varies from 16 percent to 19 percent.
“In the five inner suburban and
heavy Labor-voting areas, the DLP
gained an average 17.6 percent vote.
In four true-blue Liberal metropolitan
strongholds, it averaged over 15 percent
and in country areas it seldom varied
much from the State averages.
'‘This would seem to indicate that the
DLP vote is no longer a vote drawn
from the industrial working class speci-
fically, even of the Catholic section of
it, though it undoubtedly has working-
class elements. In the strongly Labor-
voting electorates, the DLP vote varies
mainly from a quarter to a third to a
half. And in two Liberal strongholds,
Kooyong and Chisholm, it amounts to
half the Labor vote.
i .lectorates with the largest propor-
tion of white-collar workers would seem
to be among the strong supports for the
DLP. It would appear to have an
attraction for young voters with its skil-
ful propaganda about the ‘family man’
and better social services, and it has,
of course, a strong base in the Catholic
Church which again would help to
account for the State-wide character
of its vote.”
If this analysis is correct (and it cer-
tainly agrees with the impression I
gained in the recent Senate election
campaign when quite an amazing num-
ber of people who were not Catholic in
religion told me that they intended to
vote DLP), the DLP’s main strength is
coming from white-collar workers—the
fastest growing portion of the Austra-
lian community. And the Party itself
is shedding some of that strong
Catholic Church image which was, in
its earlier period, a major barrier to
electoral progress in a country pre-
dominantly Protestant.
Mr. Cyril Wyndham, Federal
Secretary of the ALP, has demon-
strated his impression that the current
DLP voter is not the same type of
voter who supported the DLP in its
earlier years.
Mr. B. A. Santamaria, of the
National Civic Council, who has been
a consistent supporter of the DLP,
obviously sees the changing nature of
the DLP and does not like it. In
giving the DLP his support, Santa-
maria had the limited objective of
“purifying” the ALP according to his
lights, and this is almost certainly
still his aim.
An article in his mouthpiece, the
“News Weekly,” goes very close to
expressing his sorrow that the DLP
made the electoral advances that it
did in the Senate elections. The article
takes the figure of 9.8 percent across
Australia as the DLP Senate vote.
“It would be tempting to believe that
9.8 percent represents a firm statement
of DLP strength,” the article states.
“It would be safer and far more
realistic to believe that overall
throughout Australia the hard DLP
vote is approximately eight percent,
which it 'has been since 1958, and then
to allow for accidental gains and losses
which depend on changing political
climates, personalities, and the posi-
tion on the ballot paper.
“That eight percent thus con-
servatively estimated always has
been, and remains, sufficient to achieve
the DLP objective.”
What Santamaria is saying is that
the objectives of the DLP should re-
main those of the founding fathers.
This approach will undoubtedly
bring Santamaria into conflict with
those within the DLP, such as its pres-
ent parliamentary leader, Vince Gair,
who hold to the viewpoint that the
DLP should cease lamenting nos-
talgically about what they see as
Labor’s vanished, unrecoverable golden
past and strike out boldly into the
future as a fresh force in Australian
politics.
If Gibson’s analysis is correct, it
could be that the decision has been
taken out of the hands of the elements
within the DLP who regard them-
selves as ALP men only temporarily
estranged from their Party.
But on Gibson’s analysis, even if
the DLP leaders tried to make a deal
with the ALP, there is no certainty
that they could take their followers
with them into the Labor fold.

Higher local content
a car plan flops
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
SOMETHING will have to be done
about it; the Federal Government’s
badly thought-out plan for the “Aus-
tralianisation” of the local motor vehicle
manufacturing industry is simply not
working properly. Last week, .Peter
Samuel (“Running Australia by the
seat of our pants”) pointed to this plan,
and the way it had been undone in bits
and pieces, as one example of the way
Australia was being run by people who
did not grasp the implications of their
policies. Since then, latest statistics
show that the Government’s attempts to
discourage imports (while encouraging
local makers to spend millions of dollars
on increasing the Australian content of
their vehicles) have clearly failed.
Imports have never been so high since
the new policy was introduced in 1963;
they are rising at a far faster rate than
total sales of new motor vehicles, and
so are cutting into the market for
locally made cars.
It is not just Japan that is hitting
the market with imported cars; the
Europeans (Britain, Germany, Italy)
have doubled their imports in recent
times, and Britain’s devaluation should
give it an extra edge.
The crux of the “higher Australian
content” problem is that a maker needs
to get big production runs of one model
before it becomes economic to use so
many Australian parts even with the
tariff assistance he then gets; Ford has
estimated that it needs sales of up to
24,000 cars a year at 95 percent Aus-
tralian content before it breaks even
with costs of importing them, and this
seems to be a generally agreed level.
But the Government insists that car
makers have 95 percent Australian con-
tent in their cars if they sell more than
7500 cars a year, a level that the in-
dustry says would make it suffer losses.
So the policy simply can never work
in its present form. The 11 makes that
are now committed to “Plan A” would
need to have a market between them of
at least 270,000 units a year; the 12
committed to the assembly part of the
scheme (“Plan B”) would probably
need something approaching 100,000
units a year to make a go of it, and
imports will probably make up 60,000
vehicles. This means a total of about
30,000 more than the motor market of
about 400,000 vehicles a year. And with
imports going up so fast, the 30,000 gap
is sure to widen.
The companies that stand to suffer
most from the policy flop are Volks-
wagen and BMC, which are both in-
volved in the small-car market where
most of the import competition exists.
So will the local manufacturers of parts
who have built up their industry as a
result of Government policy.
There had been hopes that by 1971,
when most manufacturers under Plan A
should have reached their 95 percent
content, these would have made up
about 83 percent of passenger cars sold.
But the big rise in imports has put
some doubts on these hopes. Under
Plan A, a manufacturer who progres-
sively attains 95 percent Australian con-
tent on a model within 5 years is en-
titled to import its (steadily reducing)
foreign parts at concessional rates of
duty. The second part of the scheme
is that smaller-volume sellers can also
have import concessions if they also
increase their Australian content, which
should be at least 45 percent for cars
with sales up to 2500 units, 50 percent
for those with sales up to 5000, and
60 percent for those selling up to 7500
a year.
But this small volume plan is do-
ing exactly the opposite to what it in-
tended; by setting limits on the sales
of any one model beyond which it must
increase its Australian content, the plan
has encouraged foreign motor com-
panies to send in small numbers of
many different makes, so providing a
proliferation of makes in the Aus-
tralian market that is really in no
one’s best interests. One survey re-
cently showed there were 57 different
cars on sale for less than $2OOO (of
which 24 were Japanese); the com-
bined sales of all of these provide solid
competition for the companies going
ahead and building up their Australian
content at great cost.
Whether or not it is important for
Australia to have its own motor industry
is another matter (it is a pretty big in-
dustry; about half the new passenger
cars sold last year had reached 95 per-
cent content). The point is that what-
ever policy is being followed must
work better than the present one.
Can we afford to offend foreign motor
exporting countries by increasing yet
further the tariff barriers against their
products? The Japanese would be very
angry indeed, although the dual pricing
system they have on their export and
local models puts them in a difficult
position to complain too loudly. The
more important question is whether it
is sensible to encourage a great con-
concentration of skills, resources, and
capital (all of which are in short
supply) into an industry in Australia
when the bulk of demand for its pro-
ducts could be met cheaper from over-
seas.
Do we really need a policy that en-
courages makers to aim at 95 percent
local content, or would it suit our book
just as well if only three or four did
so? There has to be some solid think-
ing done about this business.


AUSTRALIA
Sir Henry Bland needs
two fists for his new job
THE ONLY SURPRISE about the
appointment of Sir Henry Bland as
the new permanent head of the De-
fence Department is that it took so
long to announce. Tough, wiry Sir
Henry was marked some time ago for
the job. He was measuring himself
for the chair two years ago when
Former Defence Minister Shane Palt-
ridge died, forcing the cancellation of
plans for Defence Secretary Sir Edwin
Hicks to take up the post of Deputy
High Commissioner in London. But
Sir Edwin’s continued illness has now
forced the issue.
The post is the most challenging in
the Public Service, but even Bland’s
critics in the Public Service give him
credit for his driving toughness and
his unquestionable, and to a large
extent unequalled, negotiating capa-
bilities. Outwardly he seems malleable,
but inwardly he is something of a
Napoleon. He believes in holding all
the strings and in his new post he is
going to need two fists to hold them.
One of his greatest negotiating
assets is that he still has the ear of
the greatest Public Servant of them
all, the Prime Minister, and the atten-
tion of a majority of Federal Cabi-
net, including Treasurer McMahon.
This latter contact might come in
handy, since Bland’s first major clash
will probably be with the Treasury,
Bland ... short apprenticeship
a Department at present dedicated to
curbing defence expenditure.
As a new boy in the toughest arena
in the Public Service, Bland - has no
choice but to serve an apprenticeship.
As permanent head of the Department
of Labor and National Service, his
previous association with Defence has
only been peripheral. But time and
circumstance dictate that the appren-
ticeship must be short. Bland’s
capacity to digest ideas and concepts
quickly is going to be necessary to
him. Immediately ahead of him in
1968 are the talks between the Com-
monwealth countries involved in the
British withdrawal west of Suez,
Defence Minister Fairhall ... marked for a new post?
probably in Kuala Lumpur early in
the new year, and possibly a second
summit meeting of the Vietnam allies.
In the meantime he has walked slap-
bang into what is supposed to be Aus-
tralia’s most comprehensive Defence
review. Bland is going to have to
rattle the can very hard and very
quickly if he decides he wants any-
thing altered.
Another immediate prickle in his
new chair will be the escalating costs
of the Fill bomber, one of the cur-
rent series of continuing fables that is
causing the Holt Government con-
siderable embarrassment. Harassed
Defence PR people, frustrated in the
knowledge that in the long term
honesty produces a sympathetic ear
but unable to get out from under, are
looking for signs of a better deal
under Bland. Their first sign of
future PR policy will not be long in
coming! The Government during the
last Senate election campaign commit-
ted itself to telling the Australian
people the new price for the Fill
flight in January. Bland has to decide
how that announcement will be
shaped, although in the final analysis
it will come out under the name of
his Minister, Allan Fairhall.
It is what he is not an ex-
Serviceman that could give Henry
Bland his initial trouble. From the
start he is an outsider, and his first
campaign must be to bring the top
brass over to his side. Sir Edwin
Hicks used his close association with
Sir Robert Menzies to great advantage
in the 19605. It remains to be seen
whether Sir Henry Bland uses his
close association with Harold Holt in
the same way.
Fairhall, astute, hardworking, and
capable, is blunt and less sensitive
than most to the personal feelings of
others. Both he arid Bland are stub-
born. The temperaments of both men
make clashes inevitable and it remains
to be seen if Bland uses his influences
in other areas to push his cart. But
perhaps he won’t have to try. Rumors
are still circulating that Fairhall is
marked for a new post following the
Holt Cabinet reshuffle.


Immigration
A reversal of form
IN TWO MOVES last week the De-
partment of Immigration openly per-
formed a further reversal of form on
the touchy question of Asians in Aus-
tralia. Firstly, the Department an-
nounced that Vietnamese war orphans
would be allowed into Australia for
adoption. Secondly, it revealed that 36
mainland Chinese who had jumped
ship in Australia five years ago would
be granted temporary residence with
good prospects of renewal in 12
months.
Contrast this to the hard line of
the Department only three years ago
when it went out of its way to boot
five-year-old Fijian girl Nancy
Prasad out of Australia, despite
attempts by her sister to adopt her.
What a contrast also to the situation
in 1962 when illegal Chinese immi-
grant Willy Wong surrendered himself
to authorities after spending six years
in Australia. Wong was promptly
deported to Hong Kong and, in a
miserable ceremony on the border,
handed over to the Communist
Chinese.
The Department itself wasn’t admit-
ting that either the Vietnamese war
orphans or the Chinese seamen
amounted to a change of policy. With
the war orphans, it explained, it was
only acting as a visa-issuing authority
after satisfying itself that all the
adoption procedures had been com-
pleted. And the Chinese, it ex-
plained, had been granted temporary
residence after investigation of each
case on an individual basis. The fact
that the Department had been “investi-
gating” some of the stowaways since
1962—the time of the Wong case—
was overlooked.
Perhaps the jolt came from the bad
knocking the Department took over
the Prasad and Wong cases, followed
by some very poor international pub-
licity for Australia.
But whether the Department has a
new policy on Asians in Australia (or
any policy at all) it is not saying. The
last official statement on this was in
March, 1966, when the then Immigra-
tion Minister, Mr. Hubert Opperman,
announced a relaxation of restrictions
on Asian immigration and a reduced
waiting time for Asians to gain Aus-
tralian citizenship. His successor, Mr.
Billy Snedden, has not yet seen fit
to be more specific, but it is gener-
ally taken that the admission rate of
non-European immigrants to per-
manent settlement in Australia is now
around 1000 a year.

Customs
In the bag
THE POWER of Customs has always
been recognised throughout the Public
Service, but until recently that power
has always been mitigated by a feeling
of comradeship. But recent raids by
Customs and the seizure of much
Christmas booty carefully dispatched
by overseas diplomats, Trade and Im-
migration officials in diplomatic bags to
loved ones left behind has upset what
was a very nice perk.
Understandably, many people in the
Public Service are upset over the end
of one of their traditional perks, par-
ticularly in the Department of Trade.
Most of the Mikimoto pearls that feat-
ured high on the final tally of goods
removed from the diplomatic bags
were consigned to relatives and friends
of Trade officials.
There is also an almost total rejec-
tion of the official story that the raids
were made in collusion with the De-
partment of External Affairs. Some
very big people in that Department
knew nothing about the first raid until
it was almost over, and then they had
a second shock when they learnt the
magnitude of it.
In the Department of Trade itself
there is a sense of betrayal, as the man
who is being blamed, Mr. A. T. Car-
mody, now Comptroller-General of
Customs, was formerly a deputy sec-
retary in the Department of Trade and
the first head of its Department of
Secondary Industry.
Carmody can take most of the credit
for the new, revitalised Customs De-
partment. Rumors that he wears a
Contrabandits badge under his lapel are
undoubtedly mischievous, but if any-
body is entitled to wear one he is.
Since he moved to Customs in May,
1966, the Department has undergone
sweeping changes. His first directive
was that no one should speak to the
Press and he alone carried this respon-
sibility. He has now relaxed this a little,
but even today he still likes to clear
all statements. As he was in the De-
partment of Trade, he is respected by
his men. He works hard and bows to
no one. He is fully aware of the powers
of Customs and uses that power fully.
Customs under him has cracked down
heavily on drug trafficking, and in
recent months has raided importers’
offices, cracking down on alleged wide-
spread illegal trading practices by Jap-
anese and Australian companies (the
report is now being compiled).
Now he is to get fast Customs
patrol boats and even helicopters for
spotting operations.
Companies Acts
Patching up the
cracks
THE CURRENT AGITATION for
further amendments to the Companies
Acts arising from the fresh spate of
investigators’ reports (Cox Finance, the
Korman group, Savoy) in Victoria
seems unlikely to force the Victorian
Government into any precipitate piece-
meal changes in the law, at least at
this stage, nor to divert the All-Aus-
tralia Attorneys-General Committee
from its present intention to await the


report of the special junta they’ve set
up to look at company legislation as
a whole in Australia with a view to
making an overall revision.
On the other hand, the Victorian
Attorney-General, Mr. Wilcox, is now
under strong pressures from all
parties and also outside Parliament to
take up some of the leads for possible
prosecutions given in the reports,
especially Mr. Peter Murphy’s final one
on the Korman group in which the
Chevron (Sydney) prospectus and the
cheques “round robin of February
1961” which allegedly syphoned a
large wad of money from the Korman
public companies into the private ones
(though admittedly this was a mere
fraction of the total ssom. of public
money lost).
The latest reports from investigators
just about brings the witch-hunting to
an end, even if the courts still have a
lot of cases arising from it to prosecute,
quite apart from any new ones that may
now be thrown up. In the meantime the
search goes on for ways, and means to
stop all this happening again. For.
despite the patching up of cracks in the
Companies Acts in the past few years,
there’s an underlying suspicion, par-
ticularly in the Victorian Parliament,
that it could. The search is not only
directed at making directors foolproof,
though this has been the burden of
most of the MPs’ songs in the past
week.
“What interests me, and I’m sure
every Member of this House,” said
Mr. Galbally in the Legislative Coun-
cil, “is the practicability of providing
means of reasonable protection for
investors without limiting their specu-
lative or investment instincts.” It was
up to the Legislature to devise sanc-
tions against misfeasance or worse on
the part of company directors, but
Galbally looked as much to the Stock
Exchange to police the companies on
their lists; a role they were presently
doing unsatisfactorily because stock-
brokers feared that by pushing their
regulations and investigatioris much
further Stock Exchange committees
could render themselves liable for
defamation. While perturbed at what
had been going on in some listed
companies, they hadn’t yet come up
with an answer on how to stop it.
Among those most perturbed on the
matter was Mr. Staniforth Ricketson,
whose last memorandum to his firm be-
fore he died last week expressed deep
concern over some of the Exchange’s
present inadequacies.
Mr. Galbally wasn’t suggesting pre-
cisely what the Stock Exchange
should do to fill the gaps left by com-
pany law, though, as he should know,
the Associated Australian Stock Ex-
changes have been more active than
anyone in co-operating with the
Attorneys-General in exploring the
possibilities of tightening up the Com-
panies Acts. Indeed, the committee of
the Stock Exchange of Melbourne has
had a big fist in the drafting of
amendments to the Victorian legisla-
tion in recent years.
Metric system
Turning chaos into order
KING HENRY I IS often blamed for
beginning the absurdities of the British
system of measures. He is supposed to
have proclaimed the length of a yard
as the distance from the tip of his royal
nose to the end of his middle finger.
From that decision and others not much
less capricious has evolved the system
of weights and measures which Britain
and her ex-Colonies are now trying to
untangle.
The British Government decided in
1965 to implement a gradual change
to the metric system over ten years.
At the present rate of progress it is
expected that the process will be com-
pleted by 1972. Earlier this year the
Australian Senate set up a Select Com-
mittee to investigate the adoption of the
metric system. Introducing the legisla-
tion, Senator Gorton pointed out that
the only countries which were not
using the metric system or considering
its introduction were Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, and the United States.
The committee, consisting of four
Government Senators, three from the
ALP and one from the DLP, completed
the major part of its work of hearing
evidence last Thursday. It has heard
evidence in all capital cities and from
more than 150 witnesses representing
primary and secondary industry, Gov-
ernment departments, and consumer
organisations. Further evidence will
be heard by a sub-committee of three
Senators who will visit New Guinea,
where a new metric land title system
is being introduced.
The chairman of the Metric Com-
mittee, Senator Laught, of South Aus-
tralia, expressed concern last week at a
, Press report that the committee had
decided unanimously to recommend
that Australia change to metric weights
and measures as soon as possible. How-
ever, he was not able to deny the
report.
In reality it has been clear for some
time from the manner of the commit-
Senator Laught
Senator Gorton
tee and the weight of evidence before
it that the recommendation would be
for the introduction of the metric
system. Government departments have
supported the idea, primary producers
have pointed to the advantages of
metrics for our export trade, most in-
dustrialists and manufacturers have
agreed to accept the temporary incon-
veniences of the new system, and the
Australian Consumers’ Association said
last week that “for the consumer, once
it is in widespread use, the metric
system turns chaos into order. Our anti-
quated system of weights and measures
has no sentimental, national, tradi-
tional, religious, racial, or any other
conceivable significance.”
Most opposition has come from the
oil companies, which estimate that a
change-over from gallons, pints, and
quarts could cost them collectively
more than $l5 million. They claim that
it will cost $4O at least to alter the
measuring machinery on each petrol
pump. Some opposition has also been
expressed by car manufacturers, who
are angling for Government financial
assistance when the change comes, and
from milk bottling firms.
On present estimates, the cost of
changing from yards apd pints to
metres and litres will be more than
$6O million. But Senator Gorton and
others have suggested that the resultant
gain in domestic efficiency and in ex-
ports could make up that amount in
one year.
In all the discussions, the entrepren-
eurs of one particular trade have been
strangely silent. How are beauty-queen
organisers going to feel when they an-
nounce that the winner, Miss Shapen,
has dimensions of 80, 55, 80 (centi-
metres) ?


Aborigines
An Aborigine's reserve is not his castle
AN ABORIGINE’S HOME is
apparently not yet his castle. Aboriginal
leader Dexter Daniels has been jailed
for 14 days on a charge of having in-
sufficient lawful means of support. At
the time of his arrest at the Roper
River Mission Station, he had $lB in his
pocket and was residing in a native
reserve. Strong protests against his
sentence have come from all over Aus-
tralia and the Federal Council for the
Advancement of Aborigines and Torres
Strait Islanders is investigating his case.
The Council, according to its secretary,
Mrs. Faith Bandler, is appalled at this
action but feels that it may provide an
opportunity to determine an Abori-
gine’s rights on his own reserves.
Mrs. Bandler told The Bulletin that
the Council’s two executive members in
the Northern Territory were looking
into the matter and would make sure
that Daniels had all the legal and
financial help he needed for an appeal.
She said it was unfortunate that he had
pleaded guilty, but it was because he
had misunderstood his position. She
said that if vagrancy charges were
generally applied as they had been to
Daniels, “the jails will be crawling with
Aborigines. They rarely have much
money in their pockets.”
There was no doubt in her mind that
Daniels has been arrested because of
his union activities. Last year he was
a leader of the strike by Aboriginal
stockmen and had travelled around
Australia collecting money for them.
She said he was playing a big part in
getting equal wages for Aborigines and
guessed that he had been telling the
Aborigines on the Roper River Station
that they had the right to organise their
own social services. Missionaries and
employers, she explained, usually
handle social services, buying what they
see fit for the Aborigines. “I think
rather poorly of the particular mis-
sionary who called the police to the
reserve to arrest him. Good heavens,
I know Dexter and his family well.
He doesn’t drink and I can’t imagine
him behaving in any way that might
be offensive.”
The last such incident she recalled
was 20 years ago, when Lawrence was
arrested and Waters banished 1000
miles away for telling Aborigines they
should demand £7 a week instead of
£2. She had not thought it could hap-
pen these days, particularly in view of
the recent referendum. “You would
think the missionary and the police
would hesitate to use such action in the
face of public opinion. Our Council
will make absolutely certain Dexter
appeals. We will ask for a full-scale
inquiry into the arrest, and we want to
make sure it never happens again. We
want to know if Aborigines can be
arrested for vagrancy on their own re-
serves. If they can be, we want to
make sure that they cannot in future.
After all, where else can they call
home?”
Mrs. Bandler said that the Council,
which depended on fees from affiliated
bodies and on public donations, made
appeals where necessary. In Daniels’
case, the local branch had its own fund,
and it did not yet appear necessary to
make an appeal for money. She has
suggested to the many people who have
rung to ask how they could help that
they send a donation toward the costs
involved.
Papua-New Guinea
Women's pay
puzzle
AFTER THE Papua-New Guinea
House of Assembly election next year,
the new Parliament in Port Moresby
will have to face a puzzling legacy from
the old House —one which occurred
only because a radical young Australian
Member, Mr. Tony Voutas, wanted to
arouse one decent squawk from the
legislature before it closed shop.
Voutas unleashed a proposal to pay
equal wages to women in the Territory’s
Public Service who were performing
work equal to that done by the men.
To his and everyone’s surprise, a
majority of Elected Members shouted
down the unprepared and feeble opposi-
tion of the Government-appointed Mem-
bers and a few Elected conservatives.
Equal pay for women in the Public
Service of Papua and New Guinea was
established in just two hours— in prin-
ciple, anyway.
In 1965 the House passed a Bill pro-
viding for transfer of control over the
Public Service from Canberra into
Territory hands. Australia disallowed
it, but Territories Minister Barnes set
up a committee of inquiry to take a
more sober look at Public Service re-
form. In September, 1966, he accepted
an interim recommendation that the
practice of having two salaries for one
office one for indigenous and one
for expatriate officers should be re-
placed by one salary at the indigenous
level with a compensating allowance for
expatriates. At the recent House session,
the Administration introduced legisla-
tion to give effect to this “single-salary”
principle.
As few people in the Public Service
care how that difference is expressed
nobody anticipated other than a dull
routine debate on the legislation; but
owing to the form of the Bill, Voutas
was able to introduce, in the commit-
tee stage, a very simple amendment
preventing any salary determination
from discriminating between public ser-
vants on the grounds of their sex alone.
Taken completely by surprise, the
Official Members were unable to
counter his arguments, somewhat
scratchy in truth, in favor of the prin-
ciple, and, having failed to secure an
overnight adjournment to rally their
forces, they were defeated, 28 votes to
22.
It is by no means certain that Mr.
Barnes will use this power to rebuff
Voutas and the other dissentients be-
cause the Governor-General can only
disallow the whole of a Bill. If the
equal pay provision is disallowed, the
single-salary principle embodied in the
rest of the Bill would also have to be
disallowed. And Barnes and his senior
departmental advisers might not dis-
allow what they have called an “urgent”
measure.
Oddly enough, Voutas failed to
realise that his amendment related
only to the “salary” component of the
new system of expressing public ser-
vants’ pay, with the result that it is
only indigenous women who would
benefit from his move. He introduced
another Bill on the last day of the
session to cover equal pay for expat-
riate women, too. But the best he was
able to do was to have this Bill ad-
journed to the first session of the new
House next year, after an undertaking
by the Government that it would study
the question of equal pay for all women.
These days the Department of Ter-
ritories tends to back out of earshot if
anyone so much as whispers “discrimi-
nation,” and if equal pay is given to in-
digenous women but not to expatriates,
then there is no doubt that the expat-
riate women will find plenty of cham-
pions of both races to decry a racial
discrimination-in-reverse against them.
There are sound reasons why all
female public servants in Papua-New
Guinea should have equal pay with men.
It is absurd to deny indigenous women
equal pay because of the historical
quirks which, in Australia, have pro-
duced lower wages for women than men.
So far as expatriate women are con-
cerned, equal pay would act as a much-
needed attraction for vitally important
workers in short supply nurses,
teachers, and professionals of all kinds.
The highest estimate one can take
($700,000 p.ai) of the cost of paying
equal wages would mean an increase of
less than 1.7 percent on the Public Ser-
vice salaries bill and about .05 percent
on total Administration expenditure
scarcely beyond the Government’s re-
sources.

THE GALLUP POLL
The relevant Senate election questions pollsters asked.
The Gallup Poll
The DLP makes life miserable
KNOCKING THE POLLSTERS has
been a popular American sport for
years and since the Senate election the
mood has spread here. Last week Roy
Morgan, who runs the Australian Gal-
lup Poll, from offices in the Melbourne
“Herald” building, told The Bulletin
that he was now in “the bouquet and
brickbat business,” and that the Senate
result had come as a bit of a blow to
the reputation of his poll.
On November 18 Morgan sent his
200 interviewers into the field to ask
the formula question: “Now, we’d like
your opinion on the Senate election
next Saturday. To make sure we get
your views accurately, here’s a Gallup
Poll ballot. If the Senate election were
being held today which Party would
you like to see win?”
The interviewers handed their sub-
jects a ballot paper with the Parties
marked on it, and a pen and a ballot
Morgan ... pin-point accuracy
box in which the paper was inserted.
The result, after 1928 people were
interviewed, was: L-CP 44 percent, ALP
42 percent, DLP 7 percent, Indepen-
dent and minor Parties 2 percent, no
answer 5 percent. After dividing the
“no answer” percentage like the others,
the amended result was L-CP 46 per-
cent, ALP 44 percent, DLP 8 percent,
and others 2 percent.
In the event, the November 18 poll
was almost 4 percent too high for the
L-CP, 2 percent too low >for the ALP,
and 2 percent too low for the DLP.
The 4 percent difference between the
Gallup Poll and election figures for the
Government Parties was the second
greatest so far recorded since the poll
was founded in 1941.
For Roy Morgan the result was
especially tantalising because his
previous poll on November 4 turned
out to be accurate within 1 percent on
the figures of the two major parties,
and within 2 percent on the DLP.
Morgan blamed the DLP for the
difficulties encountered by the poll:
“The DLP has confused the issue and,
frankly, it has made my life miserable.
The poll is mostly in danger of putting
the Government vote too high and the
DLP vote too low. The DLP is helped
by compulsory voting and acts as a
kind of escape Party for the compelled
voter. And for the disgruntled Liberal
supporter, too.”
He produced figures to show that
whereas, in 1961, 63 percent of those
who said they would vote DLP were
Catholics, the Catholic DLP voters are
now only 53 percent, and 26 percent
of DLP voters are Anglicans. “Before
the DLP came along,” he said, “we
could predict the result with pin-point
accuracy. Now things are different,
despite the fact that our methods have

improved. In fact, they are just about
the best in the world.”
In an effort to trace the discrepancy
between the November 4, November 18,
and election-day figures, the Gallup
Poll has sent out reply-paid letters to
all of the 1928 people interviewed on
November 18. They have been asked if
they changed their voting intention
after being interviewed and why.
Waiting for the letters to return,
Morgan is inclined to guess that, apart
from the movement of disgruntled
Liberals and “compelled” voters to the
DLP, the most likely reason for the
swing back to the non-Government
Parties was their strong advertising
campaigns in the last week of the elec-
tion. The Government Parties had little
and ineffectual publicity on the last
Thursday and Friday whereas the ALP
and DLP Press publicity was at its
highest. “Whilst Harold Holt was talk-
ing about devaluation,” says Morgan,
“the ALP was saying you can’t trust
the Liberals and saying it in a striking
way, with reverse type and the lot.”
In future the last Gallup Poll will
probably be moved forward from pres-
ent week before elections to the Wed-
nesday evening, so that last-week
swings may be recorded. Morgan is
sure that his methods of probability
sampling are the best in the world
and that the figures he gets are accu-
rate at the time. “With short campaigns
and powerful advertising the problem
is to get close enough to the election
to pick up late swings in the popu-
larity of the Parties.”
Morgan and his staff point proudly
to the fact that they have successfully
predicted the result of every Federal
election since 1943' (except, of course,
the latest Senate contest). Among their
other successful predictions were: that
the Social Service referendum would
be carried in 1946, while the referenda
on Marketing and Employment would
be lost; that the Victorian Hotel Hours
referendum would be lost in 1956. That
the 1961 referendum in New South
Wales would be decided in favor of
the Legislative Council.
More recently the 60 percent vote
against increasing the size of Federal
Parliament was predicted with com-
plete accuracy and the 91 percent vote
on Aboriginal Rights was predicted
within 3 percent.
The Gallup Poll has twice lowered
its colors: in the 1951 anti-Communist
referendum and the 1954 New South
Wales Hotel Hours referendum. Both
of these issues were decided by the
smallest of margins.
With their computers, probability
sampling of areas in which interviews
are to be conducted, carefully framed
questions, and punch cards, Morgan and
the Gallup Poll organisation are con-
vinced that if the DLP were not around
“to confuse the issue” they would have
kept their record 100 percent accurate
on Federal elections.

indolents. These chaps avow, with a wave
of their Kangol caps, that to remove the
clutch pedal is to remove not only the
safety of engine-braking but the sheer joy
of driving. Rover couldn’t have agreed
more. So, in their dogged fashion, they de-
veloped their own breed of automatic
transmission —one which brings you the
luxury of clutchless shifting plus, when you
need it, the total control of manual shifting.
Yes, you get both. When you’re in heavy
traffic or you’re tired —or you just can't be
bothered—you relax and let the car do
the driving. Yet, when the mood strikes
you, you simply click the stick into the
hold notch marked “L" and it stays in first

Ins and outs
THE
“INSIDE”
STORY
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“THE HOUSE is sick, and we are the
doctors.” With this homely phrase,
Merle du Boulay, a leading Sydney
interior decorator, described her work
and that of her confreres. Self-styled
curers of the chronic Australian
aesthetic ailments of bad taste, dowdy
interior design, and a flock-of-china-
geese traditionalism, decorators are a
sensitive and high-toned breed apt to
have a wide circle of acquaintances,
and an ability to persuade that is
matched only, one suspects, by oriental
carpet sellers. Warmth, poise, a sug-
Terry Jonklass... no art nuveau
gestion of money, and the correct back-
ground enable them to mix in exclusive
circles, while at the same time impress-
ing the nouveau riche women or busines-
men who are their most frequent em-
ployers. They have to be masters of
the soft sell, so that when Mrs. Smith-
Jones rings up to say that Mrs. Brown-
Robinson’s living-room is adorable with
its pale pink wallpaper and its white
carpets and turquoise-green armchairs,
the decorator can discreetly suggest
something equally attractive but “dif-
ferent,” the cost of all this splendor
inserted into the conversation at the
precise psychological moment.
You need no special training or
qualifications to become a decorator.
The Society of Interior Designers under
architect Ed Dykes is trying at the
moment to insist on higher standards,
particularly knowing about the struc-
ture of a building before putting in a
fixture. Dykes says: “You get an in-
terior decorator going into an old house
and saying: ‘That’s a lovely place for a
chandelier’ and then putting one up
regardless of the suitability of the ceil-
ing. Somebody I know recently fixed
one and it fell down, damaging the
whole room.”
A decorator has to be an expert
gauger of personality, so that the bright-
ness of a woman’s dress or the way
she talks about colors can indicate how
far one can dare go in making her house
splashy. When the client’s taste is really
ghastly, it’s a question of coaxing her
not out of what she wants but into a
less disastrous version of it (that takes
real tact). A combination of artist, car-
penter, paperhanging, and psychologist,
a decorator also has to be a shrewd
buyer, importing fabrics cleverly so that
they do not duplicate what is widely
available, knowing which factories to
go to (although they say, “We’ll run
this up for you at our factory” they
often mean they’re getting it done by
a firm which may supply other interior
decorators as well, but the air of exclu-
siveness must at all times be main-
tained).
There are a good many procedures
which might tactlessly be called tricks
of the trade. Most materials are im-
ported and the really shrewd interior-
decoration departments of some large
stores go to, say, Stockholm, pick up
some samples on the pretext of want-
ing to order in bulk, then fly to Japan
or Hong Kong to have thousands of
yards run off cheaply. They thus
achieve the up-to-date look at the
minimum of expense, so that people
visiting the office of the decorator, see-
ing a magazine of the latest designs left
accidentally-on-purpose open on a desk,
will feel that they are not being cheated
in the matter of modernity.
When a material is locally made, it
will often have a discreet label bearing
a message like “Made in Denmark”
attached to it, only to be found by the
really keen inspector of the goods, but,
in fact, setting the seal of distinction on
the purchase. Australian designers of
these fabrics are said to trot around to
shops just to see what foreign point
of origin has been affixed to their latest
works.
Many decorators take factory fur-
June Carney . .. decorate and sell


nishings on consignment, declaring that
their window is a publicity showcase.
If the goods don’t sell they can be
returned to the maker. If they are
shrewd, decorators make sure that they
don’t imprint their style too firmly on
a house they are asked to furnish, but
just firmly enough to make sure visitors
know who did it, or at least ask. They
may use the phrase “Darling, that must
go!” But if they do, it is only with the
utmost caution.
One class of interior decorators begins
as window-dressers and ends up giving
you a living-room like a shop window.
They will do over a friend’s flat and
perhaps have a party in it to show it
off to the right people; or, more com-
monly, get into a close liaison with a
builder of home units. They fix up a
“model unit,” which they have bought
in a new unit building, and each arrival,
with the builder’s help, drops into the
“model unit” for a drink or just a look
around.
Soon everyone wants one “just like
it,” and the decorator gets to work.
Word of mouth spreads his fame
through a whole suburb, or series of
new buildings, so that finally he is able
to leapfrog from building to building,
doing new interiors as he goes along,
and letting his own units, one after the
other. Finally, looking at the units he
has owned, furnished, and let over, say,
five years, you can see illustrated the
fashionable styles of a whole period.
Other interior decorators break into
the field by buying a small house in a
fashionable suburb and turning it into
a pretty shop. They aim for the rich
old ladies of the district, beginning
modestly enough by buying, say, a
vaguely Greek or Middle Eastern figure
from St. Vincent de Paul and gilding
it, then putting it on show with other
touched up items in the window. Sooner
or later Little Old Ladies pass by,
and Bob’s Your Uncle.
In addition to the “quality” look
and that nowadays tends to mean
Scandinavian if you’re mod, Italian or
French if you’re antique-orientated
—a fancy name is often necessary. One
wouldn’t deny their talents, but the
names “Marion Hall Best” and “Merle
du Boulay” have something that un-
doubtedly attracts clients, and even
“Leslie Walford” is not without a cer-
tain distinction. Of the “interior-
decoration boutiques” or, to be blunt,
furniture shops, scattered through Syd-
ney’s suburbs, many have arty names:
at Avalon, Brunton and Alexis and The
Color House; at Narrabeen, Domus
Interiors; at Seaforth, The Far Away
Places Lighting and Art Studio; at
Pym'ble, Fifth Avenue Interiors. It
isn’t in the least surprising to find
Merle du Boulay. .. organised clutter
Terrace Interiors at Paddington, or
the House of Copper and Vogue In-
teriors at Double Bay.
Once they get into business in a big
way, decorators may well invade such
fashionable areas as the Antique Belt
at Double Bay-Edgecliff, and even
achieve shops as fancy as Decor, which,
amid the sterile coldness of New South
Head Road, offers a stone fountain in-
doors, complete, with cupid, or as with-
it as Neville Marsh’s shop, which has
zebra-skin scatter rugs in the window.
They usually rely on word-of-mouth,
and seldom advertise; this is left to the
furniture designers and stores, which
are apt to use a very arty-rural
approach: a settee photographed in a
field with a sheep nibbling nearby (sym-
bol of Australian conversion to stand-
ards of elegance?), a settee on the
banks of a river, materials draped over
a rough-hewn bench in the middle of a
desert. The technique is extended to
window displays, little piles of rocks
stuck out untidily but apparently allur-
ingly in the middle of a white carpet,
twigs and leaves showering over a desk
or dining-room table.
Among the most trendy of Sydney
shops is the one run by Marion Hall
Best in Woollahra. Mod in a Carnaby
Street watch, with bright, clever eyes
in a still pretty face, Lady Hall Best is
a veteran of the avant garde, as hardy
perennially up to date as an editor of
“Vogue.” She has a staff of 16, some
of whom, tailored, youngish women
with well-bred manners, were in the
shop when I called, talking about
“divine fabrics” and “poetic chairs” to
customers in genteelly subdued voices.
The shop offers tatami matting,
shelves of Finnish and Mexican
materials among others, and Saarinen
chairs—very much the “thing” at the
moment, one of which, a fibreglass item
like a scooped-out mammoth ostrich
egg, cost a cool $895.
A swivel black leather chair at
Marion Best’s would set you back- $344,
a candle on a glass base $75.50. Nearby
was a kinky item: a bowl of “silver
eggs” with instructions: “Borrow a
handkerchief. Place it tightly over the
super-egg. Then press the burning end
of a cigarette against the cloth and the
egg beneath. No damage will be done
to the handkerchief. The reason? The
heat is swiftly conducted to the super-
egg.” Equally bizarre objects are often
exhibited in shops of this kind, ad-
juncts to high living among the smart
set.
When Marion Hall Best started out
in the ’thirties, one of a group of young
women that used to go to Thea Proc-
tor’s design classes and study the over-


seas materials and furnishings bought in
by David Jones’ Molly Gray, she used
to deplore the fact that so many of the
Sydney rich went in for cream walls,
patterned carpets, and heavy chintzes.
She began to study the latest design, her
own ideas for rooms were featured in
the English magazine “Decorative Art,”
and she took a correspondence course
with the American “Arts and Decora-
tion,” earning herself a diploma in the
process.
She began her career doing different
colored walls and established her repu-
tation with a lavish decor for the
Eleanora Golf Club: blue ceilings, terra-
cotta pink walls, hand-blocked Canadian
curtains in deep plum grading up to
terracotta at the top. The ideas were
accepted, but when she did the club
again a few years ago the members had
got older and thought her ideas too
daring. They threw out her work and
started again. She ran into similar
trouble when she did a rather dashing
design for Elizabeth Arden in Sydney
(at Elizabeth Arden’s own request).
The design was scrapped and Powder-
Box Modern used instead.
She continued the fight against con-
servatism, doing a block of flats at
7 Elizabeth Street and the Rachel For-
ster Hospital Nurses’ Home in daring
color combinations (“almost like synco-
pation in music”). Post-war, she got
hold of valuable contacts in Europe:
Pierre Frey for fabrics in Paris, Witte
Baudisch for pottery in Vienna. In the
late ’fifties, she really boomed: she did
Eric Anderson’s spectacular flat in tur-
quoise blues and bitter greens, imported
Saarinen chairs, started designing offices
and more flats, but found wealthy
people still largely uninterested: “They
might use my kind of design in a nur-
sery or a maid’s room, but not in the
rooms they use to live in or entertain
their friends. Besides, I never could do
the social thing or bother with ‘con-
tacts.’ My husband was a dentist and he
always used to say that being on his feet
all day was all the social life he
needed.”
If Marion Hall Best “likes” modern
furnishings and decoration, Artes
Studios can be said to be obsessed with
them. Ask for an Art Nouveau wall-
paper in their two showrooms in Syd-
ney’s George Street and you are apt to
get very short shrift. Their windows
are really jazzy illustrations from a
European design magazine come to life.
A white carpet has pebbles on it, and
there are stone jugs, earthenware bowls,
a $l2O sculpture, “El Toro,” by Max
Cullen. Bookshelves boast the kind of
books people who don’t normally read
are apt to have around the house: Hein-
rich Harrer, Erie Stanley Gardner,
Kimball’s “Principles of Industrial
Organisation.”
Artes Studios make up offices with
the international look, and their shop
is full of Danish fabrics, Germanic or
Scandinavian-style furniture. They issue
young couples with furniture Master
Plans in collaboration with Pettit and
Sevitt project houses: the couples fill in
portions of the Master Plan over many
years, paying off one section and then
doggedly going ahead to pay off
another (what they are supposed to do
when the furniture goes out of fashion
is not clear). Terry Jonklass, one of
Artes’ Studios chief designers, finds a
lack of interest as Lady Hall Best does
from what passes for high society here:
“They prefer copies of antiques. But it’s
utterly foolish to have, a Queen Anne
setting in this climate.”
But, apart from Cabana, a North
Shore rival to Artes Studios (“take the
‘E’ out,” said one cynical decorator,
“and Artes Studios has lost half its busi-
ness”), and one or two good modern
decorators such as Barry Little, the
mood of interior decoration in Sydney
is staunchly traditional.
The late Deric Deane in the ’thirties
started it, and today a contemporary
of his firm, Artistry of King Street, is
as thriving as his still is.
June Carney, boss of Artistry, has a
clientele of women and doesn’t like
modern design (“It all looks the same.
It doesn’t have enough feeling.”). She
doesn’t aim to create a new look even
within her own terms of reference:
“Our business is to decorate and sell.
That’s all.” Her clients have conserva-
tive tastes: “We might suggest a soft
beige carpet, apricot silk curtains,
apricot and sauterne brocaded sofas,”
and her only bugbear is the lack of
rich people in Australia: “So many
people aren’t prepared to spend. They
want things done cheaply.”
You can’t have things done cheaply
at Leslie Walford’s: his showrooms at
Double Bay are luxurious, old-
fashioned, and subdued. He has pol-
ished manners, is well-educated with a
family tree that goes back to the first
settlement. Mustard-colored carpets, a
bell that at a foot’s pressure rings a
discreet chime, scented candles on
shelves, antique telephones, a cut-glass
chandelier, young men purring over
new curtains in the background: all
this has developed from fairly modest
beginnings in the 19505. Walford’s
clientele originally sprang from friends
of his mother, and a founder of the
Black - and - White Committee. He
studied at a school run under the
auspices of the Louvre, scoured Europe
for antiques, and established a name
for bringing them to Sydney: much of
his success is due to his wide circle of
social contacts, the ability to coax, and
skilful importing (he has to be careful
not to use fabrics that are too much
alike because most of his clients visit
each other’s houses). He writes a social
column, is active at parties, and even
lectures (the day before I met him, to
150 women).
Merle du Boulay is also rather tradi-
tional in her outlook. Asked to define
her style, she said simply, “coloring.”
“I love harmonies. I never clash colors.
I love each color to harmonise with the
others. I recently did a garden room
in turquoises, the only accent a vivid
acid-green. The whole room flowed
into the garden and the water view.”
She has to keep a sharp eye on a
client’s taste: “One woman whose flat
I did recently simply has to live with
strong colors. She always wears oranges,
limes, and yellows. And you have to be
versatile. One morning a club, the after-
noon a shop, then a flat.” Like other
decorators, she has a horror of mass-
produced furniture: “My blood runs
cold at it . . . those ghastly plastic
button beds and wardrobes.” And
modern design: “Too impersonal. I like
organised clutter. We’ve had all these
New Australians doing designs as well
as buildings. The result is that every-
thing there starts to look the same.”
Her comment on what was needed to
make a good interior decorator typified
her colleagues’ remarks on the same
subject: “Number one, a decent home
background that has given you an
appreciation of furniture from your
schooldays. Number two, a good know-
ledge of psychology. Number three, an
easy manner.” The qualities, one notes,
of a good high-class furniture sales-
man.
If there is one feature most Sydney
interior design has in common it is
copyism: “We are,” said furniture and
interior designer Gordon Andrews, “like
pre-war Japan in this respect.” Aus-
tralian manufacturers copy each other
as well as overseas figures: Artes Studios
recently discovered that an upholsterer
once in their employ is copying their
chairs, and in “Design Australia” some
firms advertised chairs as their models
of the season which were copies of
German originals. Anyone can copy and
pretend they are simply working in an
“international mould,” because modern
design is a commonplace in all
countries.
Gordon Andrews, one of the few
entirely original designers of interiors
and individual furnishings in the
country, himself stolen from, is doing
his best to combat the situation, so far
with little success. Retail stores here, he
said, have failed to encourage the local
designer, and breakthroughs in design
here have been rare, in fabrics as well
as furnishings. It’s much cheaper to
bring in the best from overseas and,
besides, the snob-appeal of the foreign
product is tremendously powerful
among the rich.
If you want to start in business as
an interior decorator and have the
right social contracts, you scarcely are
going to need training (though the
East Sydney Technical College and
designer Mary White, in business for
herself, both have courses). But you’re
certainly going to have to be careful,
especially if you’re entering the limited
and dangerous field of modem interior
decoration, about one thing: make sure
you get the overseas design magazines
airmail first.

The outsiders
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
THE JUNCTION of William Street
and Darlinghurst Road may not be so
celebrated as the corner of Haight and
Ashbury, nor any special symbol of
protest, but for young escapees from
parents, friends, jobs, middle-class
mores (and sometimes the police), it
offers the chance of getting outside.
The Reverend Ted Noffs of the Kings
Cress Wayside Chapel reckons that
there are between 2000 and 3000 root-
less youngsters, in their teens and
twenties, drifting around the Cross at
any one time, more often out of work
than in it, alienated from their families
and relatives, living sometimes in their
own bed-sitters, sometimes in some
communal pad, sometimes without a
roof at all. They hive to the Cross from
all over the country because the place
is a symbol of both excitement and
emancipation from common custom.
The young drifters of the Cross, and
their less numerous cousins in Carlton
and St. Kilda, provide some spectacular
and exotic cases because many of them
are in conscious revolt against some-
thing: exam failure or dad and mum or
a monotonous job or sexual inhibition.
However, much of their activity—or
non-activity is derivative. They have
heard, or seen on television, how drop-
outs behave in London or San Francisco
and they decide that they will have a
try at it, too. Apart from the hard
core, within five years most of them
will be back in the suburbs as young
marrieds, their excursion out of society
not much more vivid in their memories
than if they had spent those years as
members of the Royal Commonwealth
Society or the Bushwalkers’ Club.
They can hardly be said to belong to
the great Australian tradition of the
outsider. The swagman or sundowner
didn’t need to know what was the lat-
est overseas fashion in swags or billy-
cans before he took to the road. He
was generally a solitary and remained
so, not needing others around him to
reinforce him in his contempt for the
everyday life of the everyday man. And
to him the road was a lifetime’s path;
once he took to it he never looked back.
Swagmen now are few, but there are
still a fair number of Australians who
opt out of society with a thoroughness
which might astonish the Paddington
hippy.
These are the non-workers: the men,
and, occasionally, women, for whom a
regular job is something of a social
humiliation as well as a private torture.
Chief among these are the professional
punters, the gamblers, the occasional
hustlers, the con-men, those who are
said to live on their wits, the thieves.
On a city racecourse on a Saturday
perhaps two percent of the patrons are
professionals, men who are said to be
“on the punt.” Among a Flemington or
Randwick crowd of 20,000 it is gener-
ally accepted that a few hundred at
any one time are trying to make a
living at the game.
A minority of these are in the throes
of some “system” which they believe
will guarantee a fixed income from rac-
ing for life. System punters with a sub-
stantial bank may hold out for some
months before going broke, because
they are bound to some kind of staking
method which precludes them from los-
ing too much at a time. But in the
end the fact that there are a multiple
of variables in racing: previous form,
fitness, breeding, accidental injury, in-
terference, the intentions of trainers
and jockeys, etc., beats the system and
it’s a case of back to work or some
other means of income.
The shrewder kind of professional
makes an independent assessment of a
horse’s chances and then waits for word
or a betting move from the stable. He
won’t bet unless he estimates the horse’s
price as greater than its chance of win-
ning. Few professionals have the skill,
information, and self-discipline to win
consistently for years on end, but with
the aid of loans or some kind of private
income they can often hold out for a
surprisingly long time.
The great fear is work and the sus-
taining drive during working bouts is
the re-establishment of a bank “for
another lash at the bookies.” As one pro
put it: “I’ve just been sentenced to
three months’ regular employment, but
I’ll be out and among them again after
that.”
For the truly dedicated the gallops
are only one item in the weekly round
which also features the trotting meet-
ings, the greyhound races, the boxing
(if any), card games, baccarat, and,
perhaps, roulette. This weekly test of
endurance is sometimes known as “the
circuit.” In Melbourne the circuit goes
something like this: Monday, . grey-
hounds; Tuesday, country races; Wed-
nesday, country races and cards in the
evening; Thursday, greyhounds; Friday,
boxing and baccarat later in the even-
ing; Saturday, city races and trotting
in the evening.
The Sabbath is usually observed in
Melbourne as a day of rest; but in
Sydney some of the more profane types
have been known to be on the yacht
races.
Riders of this circuit are somewhat
different from the gamblers who year
in, year out, unless age or the grog
gets them, make a consistent living at
their trade and who regard the gallops,
trots, and dogs, as “all got up to fleece
mugs.” Usually a card player, and an
expert one, the non-punting profes-
sional gambler sets himself to win a
fixed amount per night and per week.
When the figure is reached he retires
or cuts his stake to minimal propor-
tions.
Some professional gamblers stick to
two-up for their dividends. No skill is
required; only a sufficient bank to with-
stand a losing run and enough will to
pull out during the inevitable winning
run. Because of their size and noise two-
up schools run a strong risk of police
raids.
The professional gambler has a lot in
common with the hustler who plays
billiards, snooker, some other cue game,
and even golf for money. Hustlers are
more commonly found among the
Greek, Italian, and Balkan communi-
ties. Their skill is not only in the game.
They depend just as heavily on their
ability to size up opponents, to know
how much start to offer, when to play
“dead,” and when to produce the win-
ning shots. Always, of course, the aim
is to win by a small margin and just
in the last moments of the game.
The immigrant clubs tolerate, even
grant a measure of respect to, such men.
In other circles they are not well re-
garded: a middle-aged character in
torn running shoes carrying a battered
set of clubs used to make a handsome
living each week at a well-patronised
Victorian public golf course by entic-
ing the unwary into social games with
side wagers; he was finally warned off.
From a sociological view all of these
types tend to share common features.
They tend to be non-owners of anything
much beyond some smart suits and
sporting equipment: field-glasses, fishing
rod, rifle, golf clubs. They rarely own
real estate or seem to want to. Quite
often they don’t own a car. Their
natural mode of transport is the taxi,
where they are at home swopping race
form or philosophies with the driver.


In some, the lack of concern to pro-
cure fixed assets, even after a really big
win, seems almost monastic.
They tend to be single, or divorced,
or separated from their spouses.
Women, they know or have learnt,
want houses, and the lawns mowed,
regular breadwinners in regular jobs,
lots of nights at home, and disapprov-
ing relatives over for dinner. The out-
sider prefers his women to be like his
work, casual and soon over.
The attitudes of the various gambling
types to work, and property, and dom-
esticity are often shared by profes-
sional criminals, whether con-men or
more brutal kinds of thieves. Many
of these seem to suffer a compulsion to
be at psychological and moral odds with
established community attitudes. But
whereas the gambler is disinclined to
work the criminal is positively anti-
work. The gamblers do not despise
those with more respectable attitudes to
job and family, the criminal frequently
does (although, as police can demon-
strate, criminals are seen to earn much
less than laborers when their proceeds
are measured against time spent organ-
ising crime and time spent paying for
it in jail).
It could, of course, be argued that
all of them are not so much opposed
to regular employment as concerned
to achieve self-employment: that the
punter with his form guide, the hustler
at the practice table, the criminal cas-
ing the job, are all hard at work like
the rest of us.
However, the contrast with other
kinds of outsiders remains strong in
this respect, at least. Contrast, for ex-
ample, the men who have fled from
or scarcely know about careers, Moonee
Ponds, and cities: outback miners, pros-
pectors, semi-hermits, drovers, the chap
who tends the rabbit-proof fence, the
circus people. Many of them work like
shearers, and even harder, and usually
with some pride.
Their hostility to the city, and even
the farm, is apparent, as in the case of
the former capital city solicitor who
sold his practice some years ago to go
opal mining and prospecting around
Coober Pedy and Andamooka. He
returns to his eastern State metropolis
once or twice a year, partly for sup-
plies and equipment, and partly to
demonstrate his contempt for what he
left behind.
Conversations on these visits back
home are likely to begin with the
The swagman is Australia’s traditional outsider and certainly makes a
more thorough job of opting out of society than the later breeds of
hustlers, gamblers, beats, and hippies. However, even the swagman,
chased away from back doors in the hungry ’twenties and ’thirties, is
now sufficiently accepted to march in the parade before the Sydney
Royal Easter Show

mark, “See you in a year or so; the
whole place looks diseased.”
Such men of independent whim com-
bine a day-to-day practicality with the
emotions of the romantic. They are
story-tellers, and more often than not
powerful drinkers in bursts. Although
subject to melancholia, they seem to
want to protect their loneliness. They
thrive on physical discomfort.
What all the various sub-groups of
outsiders have (and this obviously goes
for Aborigines and those groups of im-
migrant men who have not yet accepted
the career-job-property nexus) is their
own vocabulary and taboo systems.
For example, a member risks losing
his sub-group identity if he falls foul
of the following taboos.
KINGS CROSS DRIFTERS: work-
ing in a bank, admitting virginity, going
to Anglican service, refusing to share
food with pad mates, playing tennis.
PROFESSIONAL PUNTERS: wear-
ing shabby or baggy clothes, going to
the opera, heading straight home after
the races, getting too excited at back-
ing a winning horse, working when not
absolutely necessary.
INTELLECTUAL BOHEMIANS:
drinking in RSL clubs, singing pop
songs, defending the Liberal Party, talk-
ing about the football, living in a cream
brick-veneer house.
OUTBACK MINERS: leaving the
hard work to others, joining the Temp-
erance Movement, complaining of the
heat, giving in to bullies, using de-
odorant.
The taboos often seem to be without
logical connection, but, while amusing
to others, are often rigidly enforced in
a non-verbal kind of way. Nobody tells
the newcomer what they are. He is ex-
pected to know. If he does not it is a
sign that he is not a proper candidate
for the life of the sub-culture.
Apart from the taboo system there is
the special vocabulary which dis-
tinguishes an outsider from the normal
citizenry. Words and expressions like
“monkey,” “brick,” “in the red,” and
all kinds of rhyming slang, “two pounds
under cocky’s cage on the hammer and
tack” (the gamblers); others such as
“shoot up,” “pilot,” “round the cor-
ner,” for drifters, beats, younger bo-
hemians. The vocabulary systems can
be elaborate and mystifying.
The beauty of it all is that there
seems to be a place, a sub-group, a
taboo system, a vocabulary kit for just
about everyone. Being outside can be
just as cosy as being inside, perhaps
even more cosy than the position of
the average 27-year-old Australian male
who drives j of a car, earns $46 per
week, writes 18 letters per month, owns
1-5 th of a television set and half a
radio, and has to get through 224 pints
of milk after he has waded into his
annual beer consumption of 24 gallons.

How much does the
NLF matter?
Peter Samuel examines the nature of the National
Liberation Front, representatives from
which may soon appear before the Security Council
WHAT IS THE National Liberation
Front, this entity whose recognition is
wanted? What are its origins in the
light of the latest document finds?
What weight can it throw around right
now? And what consequences flow from
a concession apparently semantic in
nature?
The first question of interest is
Stalin’s apocryphal: “The Pope? How
many divisions has he got?” The latest
estimate of the troop strength of the
communist regular forces in South
Vietnam is 118,000, of whom three-
quarters are formed into mainforce
divisions, seven of them of the North
Vietnamese Army and three of the
“Liberation Armed Forces.” The seven
North Vietnamese divisions are con-
trolled through three local commands
in the South—at the DMZ, in the
Central Highlands, and in hills around
the populous coastal provinces in the
centre, and they all take orders direct
from military headquarters in Hanoi.
The LAF deploy their three divisions
in iv nr wwr rpo-impnts fahnnt DDD
in six or se\en egi ents [f ’
men) in a wide aic aiound Saigon In-
fused with northern officers and re-
placements, they are, nevertheless, pre-
dominantly indigenous still, the top of
the promotion ladder for guerilla and
regional force communist fighters from
the villages of the delta and the poor
plains along the coast. The LAF also
number among their regular full-time
soldiers 30,000 men formed into pro-
vincial battalions, operating as the
military arm of each of the province
committees of the Party. These are
principally deployed in support of
120,000-odd part-time guerillas and
political cadres engaged in the village
struggle where the full mix of military,
terroristic, political, and propaganda
methods are employed.
The bulk of the firepower of the
communist forces in Vietnam cer-
tainly all that which threatens American
troops and bases is wielded, these
days, by North Vietnamese troops,
commanded by North Vietnamese offi-
cers and under the direct control of
the Hanoi Defence Ministry. The
southern “Liberation Armed Forces”
and the Party organisation in the South
report to what is internally called
COSVN, the Central Office for South
Vietnam, headquartered north of Sai-
gon on the Cambodian border. The
National Liberation Front fits in here.
At least, nominally, it has a role in
running the southern side of the
struggle. In fact, on the military side
it is also run by northerners, at least
four of the eight members of the
COSVN Military Affairs Committee
members having been identified as
generals of the North Vietnamese
Army.
It is important in assessing the real
role of the NLF to appreciate a
striking historical fact: that a very
thoroughly organised, well-co-
ordinated, quite large-scale guerilla
war was already being prosecuted in
South Vietnam before the National
Liberation Front was even conceived,
Ho Chi Minh, at the conclusion of
the Geneva talks in July, 1954, toward
the end of a broadcast to the Viet-
namese people, spoke of the need for
an all-out struggle to install a com-
munist regime in the South: “We must
devote all possible efforts during the
peace to obtain the unification, inde-
pendence, and democratisation of the
entire nation. We shall struggle in-
fallibly to obtain these for all Vietnam
•,• . • The stru ggle will be long and
difficult; all the people and the
soldiers of the North and South
must unite to conquer victory. Since
a Communist claims that only societies
under his system of rule are inde-
pendent and democratic, this _ can be
taken as a call for a communist take-
over South. To facilitate this,
th< r entire Party apparatus was main-
tamed m the South as specified in this
July, 1954, statement. by he Lao Dong
Party in Hanoi. Naturally, at a time
when our (communist) troops and our
administrative authority are being
withdrawn to the North, the Party
members and compatriots in South
Vietnam will continue to remain in
the zone on the other side,
“Our compatriots and our members
must continue to wage a hard struggle,
The Party must struggle; its cadres
must remain with the people, educating
them, unmasking them, unmasking all
"The NLF is perhaps best summed up as a massive PR effort to promote
internationally, by high-powered advertising, a discredited enterprise"

activities of warmongers, maintaining
the influence of the Party and the
Hanoi Government with the people,
and winning the respect of the masses
for President Ho Chi Minh.” In other
words, from as early as mid-1954 the
general policy line was set, and the
groundwork laid, for protracted war-
fare in the South according to the
politico-military struggle models of
the Chinese and Viet Minh communist
take-overs. This was, of course, in com-
plete contravention of the ceasefire
agreement signed by the Hanoi Govern-
ment only days before at Geneva, which
provided for a political division of the
country and mutual non-interference.
A serious start to the struggle for
the South was postponed for almost
four years by a large uprising in the
North against the new communist
regime, as its collectivisation and Stalin-
ist purge measures created a situation
which Bernard Fall has compared with
the Hungarian revolt. With the com-
munist regime in the North “close to
disintegration,” to use Fall’s words, it
was in no position to rally to the
“liberation” of the South, let alone,
incidentally, to conduct elections in
1956 as they hypocritically claimed they
intended.
By 1958 all opposition in the North
was crushed and the authority and
strength of the communist regime there
restored. It then became possible for
renewed attention to be given to the
struggle in the South. That year saw
the beginnings of the second Indo-
China war, or the Vietnam war as it
has become known. Fall, Shaplen,
Crozier, Warner, Tanham all report
the beginnings of co-ordinated guerilla
warfare with selective assassinations.
Infiltration of cadres and guerilla war-
fare experts from the North began on
a considerable scale. May 13, 1959,
saw what might be described as the
official declaration of war by the North.
The Lao Dong Central Committee de-
clared: “The time has come to struggle
heroically and per'severingly to smash
the South Vietnamese Government.”
Ho Chi Minh, in an interview with
the Italian Communist Party newspaper
“L’Unita” (July 1, 1959), explained the
decision to intervene in the South thus:
“We (Vietnamese Communists) are
building socialism in Vietnam, but only
in half the country; while in the other
half we still have to complete the
democratic-bourgeois and anti-imperi-
alist revolution. Briefly, our Party to-
day has to make two different kinds
of revolution at once, in the North and
in the South.”
A Front 'booklet dated February,
1965, entitled “History of the Lao Dong
Party,” contains the following refer-
ences to the early stages of the war in
the South: “From late 1959 through
1960, our Party resolutely led the
masses to stand up and determinedly
break the enemy’s administrative grip,
annihilate enemy personnel, wipe out
Before the NLF was heard of, the Communists were waging large-scale guerilla war
in South Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh’s first “front” was the Viet Minh, whose delegates
(left table) are seen here at the 1954 Geneva talks which divided Vietnam
traitors, and liberate a large rural zone,
shaking the U.S.-Diemist Government
down to its roots . . . Our Party reso-
lutely led the entire people to carry
out a policy of omni-front, omni-state
and protracted warfare characterised by
simultaneous political and armed
attack. With a tough policy, with ex-
periences gained in the Resistance
(against the French), with the assist-
ance. and support of North Vietnam,
the socialist bloc, and the World Peace
Movement, the South Vietnamese
people’s struggle led by the Party is
scoring many basic successes . . .”
(TVC Section, Vinh Long Province
NLF.)
By mid-1960, statistics showed that
the communist insurgency in South
Vietnam had developed in terms of
daily assassinations to twice the inten-
sity of the Malaysian insurgency at its
peak. A major guerilla war was enter-
ing the second stage of Mao’s model
with widespread and frequent, if indi-
vidually small-scale, military actions.
This, it should be noted, was all
achieved before the National Liberation
Front had been spoken of. The first
indication we have of its conception
was in a speech by the First Secretary
of the Lao Dong Party, Mr. Le Duan,
at the Third Congress of the Party in
Hanoi in September, 1960: “In order
to ensure the complete victory of the
revolutionary struggle in South Viet-
nam, the South Vietnamese people,
under the leadership of the Marxist-
Leninist Party and the working class,
should endeavor to 'build up a worker-
peasant-army coalition bloc and set up
a broad united front . . .” Not surpris-
ingly the Congress obliged by passing a
resolution saying: “To ensure the com-
plete success of the revolutionary
struggle in South Vietnam, our people
there must strive to establish a united
bloc of workers, peasants, and soldiers
. . . directed against the U.S.-
Diemists . . . The Front must carry
out its work in a very flexible manner
in order to rally all the forces that can
be rallied, win over all the forces that
can be won over, neutralise all the
forces that can be neutralised, and draw
the masses into a general struggle
against the U.S.-Diem clique for the
liberation of the South and for the
reunification of the Fatherland.”
There is then a plethora of evidence
from impeccable communist sources
that the origin of the NLF lies in a
decision of the Central Committee of
the all-Vietnam Lao Dong Party, head-
quartered in Hanoi. Its nature is equally
clearly manipulative in that it was
designed as a political instrument to
mobilise support from non-Communists
to further an exclusively communist
cause: a war already organised and run
by the Communist Party. The NLF’s
main utility has always lain in its appeal
to liberals in the West, who have a
psychotic predisposition to accept
romantic stories about oppressed
peasants rising spontaneously in
righteous revolt.
The important chronological facts
are: the war started in mid-1958; it
was officially declared in May, 1959;
infiltration of cadres from the North
began that year; the need for a Front
was accepted in Hanoi in September,
1960; its foundation in December, 1960,
was announced in January, 1961; and in
April, 1962, the names of its “leaders”
were broadcast to the world.
It is worth recalling that the National
Liberation Front is part of a pattern
of communist organisational effort in
Vietnam extending over three decades.
It is the fourth major communist Front
in recent Vietnamese history. The first
was the Viet Minh, the alliance of
Communists and Nationalists formed in
1941 in South China among Vietnamese
refugees from the French. The next
was the Lien Viet, established in May,
1946, and it conducted the successful
war against the French, which lasted

about a different kind of power..
Stopping Power
A lot of ads talk about power.
Stopping power seems to us to be more
vital.
The driver of this car had all the power to
get him where he wanted, probably
faster than he needed to.
But, at a critical moment, he didn’t have
the stopping power to avoid disaster.
A simple brake adjustment would have
made the difference. He would have
stopped and lived.
Next time you drive, make a critical test of
your stopping power. Don’t settle for a
“fair” performance.
If your brakes are not absolutely right, do
something about them.

to you could save your life.

from December, 1946, through to the
Geneva Conference in 1954. The third,
the Fatherland Front, ‘was set up in
1955 with the slogan of reunification,
and the indications are that it would
have been the banner organisation for
the struggle in the South had this not
been postponed by the anti-communist
revolt in the North. Ho Chi Minh seems
indeed to have always relied very
heavily on the Front method. According
to Douglas Pike: “From the earliest
days when he worked under Michael
Borodin at Whampao (military
academy) he (Ho) had been fascinated
by social organisation, and clearly it
was the clandestine cell structure of
underground Communism rather than,
say, dialectical materialism that
attracted him to the cause. Most of
Ho’s political victories in pre-Viet
Minh days were the result of his skill
in creating, using, and propitiously
merging a succession of united Front
organisations, each a plateau higher
than its predecessor, each increasing the
Party’s power, broadening its mass base
of support, and eliminating its rivals.
His technique involves enfolding a rival
organisation into a broader social com-
munity as a means of obscuring its
identity and as a prelude to amputating
its leadership, after which it dis-
integrated.”
That the NLF is just another Leninist
Front for using non-Communists and
then destroying them has been stated
explicitly by the Communists in Flanoi.
The September issue of the Party
theoretical journal “Hoc Tap” said last
year that “The policy of founding the
Indo-Chinese Democratic Front be-
tween 1936 and 1939, the Viet Minh
Front between 1941 and 1951, the Lien
Viet Front . . . and the present NFLSV
policy of upholding the slogans of inde-
pendence, democracy, peace, and neu-
trality are typical examples of the
clever application of the (various) in-
structions of Lenin . . .” It went on to
expound the familiar communist prin-
ciple of successive struggles, pitting the
many against the few, to systematically
destroy all rival power.
The National Liberation Front for
South Vietnam seems likely to find its
place in history as one of the least
successful of Ho’s many Front organi-
sations. When he wrote, in 1965, his
classic study of the NLF, Douglas Pike
painted a picture of it as a highly
developed system with hierarchical
organisation of committees at a
series of levels, plus a developed set
of subsidiary specialised fronts or
■“liberation associations” catering to
the needs and manipulating the
potentialities of specific groups in the
rural community. Later information
than that which was available to Pike
when he drafted his book suggests that
this was far more of an ideal than a
reality. Close questioning of commu-
nist ralliers and refugees from com-
munist-administered areas has revealed
that a great deal of the NLF structure
exists only on paper: very rarely have
any examples been found of the set of
farmers’ association, the old people’s
association, the women’s group, and the
rest actually functioning, and the village
or regional NLF has proved in practice
usually to be just another name for
the local Party group.
It appears that the NLF has no oper-
ational significance, and no longer exists
as an entity apart from the Party in
the South. This is at least tacitly ack-
nowledged in the subtleties of its term-
inology. The “struggle” is waged
“under the banner of the NLF” but
“the partisans of Marxism-Leninism
are in fact the soul of the NLF.”
We know that as early as March,
1966, the Communists in South Viet-
nam acknowledged among themselves
that the NLF had outlived its useful-
ness within Vietnam as a political
weapon. Its credibility as something
somewhat distinct from the mono-
lithic communist machine had been
lost. The Communists began talking
of yet another front. The Fourth Con-
gress of the Central Office (COSVN),
the internal terminology for the ruling
committee of the Party in the South,
put it this way: “We must create and
develop the movements among various
classes, the laborers, the needy urban
people, the petit-bourgeoisie, the stu-
dents, and then gradually associate
them with other movements and or-
ganisations to form a coalition front
for widespread action, proceeding to-
ward the development of a united
front with a platform inferior to that
of the NFLSV but endowed with the
conditions to operate openly and at-
tract these classes for a struggle against
the Americans and their lackeys . . .”
The NLF failed, in brief, because
of an overmilitarisation of the com-
munist effort from 1964 onward, when
political activity was entirely sub-
ordinated to the military effort to
achieve a knockout victory. The popu-
lation was increasingly alienated by
punishing taxation, conscription, and
forced labor work. Promises of better-
ment went further from fulfilment, and
were replaced by demands for sacri-
fice. The movement became even more
alien as northern cadres moved in
among the xenophobic peasantry.
As yet, the Communists have not
come up with any replacement for the
NLF. This may be partly because they
do not have even the nominally non-
communist figures or groups who
could plausibly be projected as the
leaders of the new front. It may be
that they judge that the NLF is still
a useful political vehicle in the inter-
national propaganda struggle, and
worth retaining for that purpose alone.
The NLF is perhaps best summed up
as a massive PR effort to promote in-
ternationally, by high-powered adver-
tising, a discredited enterprise.
The Communist demand that the
NLF be recognised as “the sole, authen-
tic representative of the people of South
Vietnam” claiming, as Communists
always do, that they have the support
of “all the people” and are opposed
only by unpeople called enemies of the
people, lackeys of imperialists, or (a
Viet Cong favorite) country-sellers.
What support do they in fact com-
mand?
No answer can be categorical, but a
number of rough orders of magnitude
can be established. It is generally
accepted in Vietnam that 20 percent
plus or minus 5 percent of the popula-
tion is under fairly continuous and
comprehensive communist administra-
tion. This figure is based on a wide
variety of indicators —on a count of
villages which Government officials
seldom visit, on areas not taxed by the
Central Government, on lack of secur-
ity, and the like. We know that the
Saigon administration was able to issue
election voting cards to just on four-
fifths of the population of voting agp.
This provides a measure of minimal
government authority, since the com-
munist instruction was for people to
refuse to participate in the elections in
any way (“boycott completely the so-
called election farce” was the slogan).
People who registered for voting or
accepted or were even found with a
voter’s card risked “trial” and punish-
ment for collaboration with the im-
perialist lackeys. Death was threat-
ened.
Control is, of course, one thing, freely
given support, another. In government-
controlled areas there are of course
many communist supporters, as there
are in communist areas many sup-
porters of the Government and of
other non-communist groups. In areas
not controlled by the Communists,
many communist supporters appear to
have voted, and it must be assumed
that they voted for the dovish Truong
Dinh Dzu, whose program came closest
to that of the Viet Cong. Dzu got 18
percent of the votes cast.
No communist supporter would have
voted for any of the other candidates,
since they all pursued an uncomprom-
ising line on the prosecution of the
war, and competed with one another in
suggesting ways to win it. Only Dzu
suggested' a cessation of bombing and
talks with the NLF.
So the absolute maximum one could
possibly postulate for communist sup-
port is 18 percent of the 80 percent
voters plus the 20 percent in areas of
communist administration: which equals
34 percent. In fact, it must be far less
than this. For one thing, much, per-
haps a majority of Dzu’s vote, must
have been non-Communist. He was
simply the most effective of the anti-
government politicians and best mobi-
lised general anti-government senti-
ment. Of his 18 percent vote, as little
as five and perhaps as much as ten
percent might be regarded as a com-
munist vote. And in the communist-
administered areas we know there is
considerable antagonism toward the
communist troops and administration.

solidarity linking the armed forces and
the people’ ” was launched. The num-
ber of refugees (over a million from
communist areas) is in part at least a
measure of disenchantment. Opposi-
tion might be thought to range between
one-third and two-thirds in communist
areas . . . which in total suggests that
freely given communist support is most
likely to lie somewhere in the range
between 11 and 24 percent of the popu-
lation. It is clearly a minority move-
ment, completely undeserving of
political power on any domocratic prin-
ciples.
The NLF, therefore, has no inherent
right to a large say in the affairs of
South Vietnam, and it is arguable that
as long as it retains its present objec-
tive of achieving an irreversible capture
of total power it has no inherent right
to any place in the democratic politi-
cal set-up in South Vietnam. Its role
would be subversive, not representative.
The practical question, however, is
whether for purposes of achieving a
“political settlement” the NLF should
be granted “recognition as a Party prin-
ciple.” This is not a matter of seman-
tics; it is thoroughly substantive, for
certain far-reaching consequences would
follow from such recognition. Recog-
nition would almost certainly be taken
as an acknowledgement of a degree of
NLF sovereignty or proper authority
within the South. It would almost
straight away imply a willingness to
carve up power in South Vietnam,
either geographically, by giving com-
munist authorities certain provinces, or
governmentally, by some sort of coali-
tion arrangement in Saigon, or most
likely a combination of the two.
Coalitions with Communists in
South-East Asia have never worked.
Sukarno’s regime was one example,
Laos is another. But the most perti-
nent example for the Vietnamese is
the fate of the coalition of 1946 in
Hanoi, and of all other attempts by
non-Communists to work with Com-
munists. The Vietnamese communist
desire for total power is so strong that
any coalition is impractical and un-
thinkable for most non-Communists.
They know how non-communist ele-
ments of the Viet Minh were hunted
down and slain, or forced to flee into
exile; how members of the National
Assembly in Hanoi disappeared into
prison or into oblivion during 1946 and
1947.
Recognition of the National Libera-
tion Front would be an abandonment
of a proposition—amply supported by
evidence —which is at the root of our
involvement in Vietnam, namely that
the NLF is a contrived framework de-
signed in Hanoi and fully controlled
by it, and that the insurgency for which
it stands has always drawn much of its
strength and most of its inspiration
from North Vietnam and beyond. It
would, therefore, be a major erosion of
our moral and political position in
fighting in Vietnam.

OVERSEAS
Is Hanoi on Russia’s side?
Or China’s? Or Hanoi’s?
By Oliver Todd (bilingual reporter of
the French weekly "Nouvel Observateur,"
Who has just returned from an eight-
week tour of North Vietnam.
EVERYWHERE I travelled on my
eight-week, 2000-mile tobr of North
Vietnam, the Russian and Chinese con-
tributions looked formidable. It was
concrete evidence of the Vietnamese
skill in side-stepping any choice be-
tween the two sides in great com-
munist split.
They are now getting help from all
the communist countries with the sole
exception of Yugoslavia, still ostracised
for revisionism. They are all contri-
buting something: sugar, tobacco,
aspirin, hydraulic pumps, generators
. . . and not merely tokens. Some resi-
dent Eastern Communists a minority
grumble. “We are footing the bill,”
a Hungarian sighed gloomily. He
could be forgiven for this weary com-
ment: he’d just been bombed out of
his flat.
On the roads, permanently repaired
by fragile-looking girls, there’s a never-
ending coming-and-going of camou-
flaged cars and cranes and tank-wagons
at night. Most of them are Russian.
But besides the enormous 15-ton
Soviet Aurochs, there are round-
snouted Chinese gia-phongs. “A copy
of our Molotovas,” said a Russian cor-
respondent. Yet made in China. There
are vehicles from Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Rumania, and North Korea.
They are all “footing the bill.” When
the subject is mentioned, the Viet-
namese say gently: “We provide the
blood.” I’m sure the Vietnamese will
never accept “volunteers” as long as
they can avoid it.
The Russians claim they are giving
or loaning 80 percent of the material
goods swallowed up by the war. Just
what this means is not certain. The
publicised figures are unreliable by
their very nature. What is clear is that
Russia and China are doing as much
as they can, while accusing each other
of not doing enough.
The hard core of the weaponry, mis-
siles and planes, is Russian. The Sam
anti-aircraft missiles seem plentiful.
They are always on the move, in ac-
cordance with Vietnamese tactics. The
Russians work on the principle of fixed,
dug-in launching pads. The North Viet-
namese go through a fantastic ballet
with their Sams in order to confuse
American reconnaissance.
At 15.00, there might be a group of
the missiles near a bridge. The Ameri-
cans photograph the Sams, take back
the film to the Seventh Fleet carrier or
to Thailand airfields. When the fighter-
bombers arrive at 16.00 those Sams are
somewhere else.
I’d been told by professionals that
the Sams were antiquated, second-rate
surplus stuff: in the early days of esca-
lation, the Vietnamese crews had
trouble with them. Perhaps. Today the
Sams seem deadly efficient. The Viet-
namese have tinkered with the Sams
and improved them. Russian experts
admit it, admiringly. The Americans
load their planes with a lot of anti-
missile equipment, but the Vietnamese
have now got their anti-anti-missile im-
provements. And they evidently work.
One question still not clearly
answered is whether the North Viet-
namese, combining middle-age devices
and modern electronics in their defence
system, have got their hands on some of
the ground-sea missiles which the Egyp-
tians, for instance, have. These missiles
could certainly change the odds by
which the Americans can dominate
North Vietnam’s shores.
Many theories are going around
Hanoi concerning these missiles. The
Russians, some say, have refused to give
any to North Vietnam, since their ap-
pearance on the Asian front “would en-
large and complicate the war and no-
body wants that to happen.” Others
say that when ground SEA missiles
were offered, they were not accepted
for the same reasons, and because the
North Vietnamese felt that although a
sinking carrier would hit the head-
lines politically, and relieve bombing
pressure for a few days, the Ameri-
cans could soon make it up militarily
by using their Thailand and Laotian
airfields still more extensively. Some
East European correspondents, however,
claim that the ground SEA missiles have
been delivered and crews trained. “They
will be used at the right moment.”
Hanoi-ology is made up of half-baked
interpretations. Truong Chinh, one of
the top five, is still indexed by Rand
Corporation experts as “pro-Chinese,”
along with his successor as Party secre-
tary Le Duan. Just as General Giap
is supposed to have gone “pro-Russian”
while Ho Chi Minh, Premier Pham
Van Dong, and Foreign Affairs Minister
Ngyee Nguyan Duy Trinh are solemnly
classified as middle-liners.
This approach forgets that collective
leadership, a verbal facade in most
communist countries, has existed for a
long time in North Vietnam and that
for 20 years there have been few
shifts-of-power struggles in the hier-
archy. To classify the Vietnamese
leaders as “pro-Chinese” or “pro-
Russian” or into hawks and doves is to
superimpose a Western and American
conceptual framework on people who
are definitely Communists, but also, very
forcefully, Vietnamese.
The would-be sophisticated reports
that land on Foreign Ministry desks or
in academic think-tanks are often based
on cocktail-party improvisations. (They
have parties and films and plays in
Hanoi between bombings.) Rumors are
magnified because most diplomats in
Hanoi are claustrophobically confined
to the capital with an occasional trip
to Haiphong. Most Western informers
on the spot project their problems,
minor or major, into Vietnamese poli-
tics.
Sometimes various branches of
American intelligence suggest that the
North Vietnamese have been forced to
A warning of U.S. bombers in the area sends one Hanoi resident to cover


employ North Korean pilots. This is
highly questionable, like the United
States’ theory that the North Viet-
namese are landing on Chinese air-
fields. What is obvious, especially since
October, is that the North Vietnamese
Air Force has grown up. It is out of its
guerilla warfare period. Sometimes it
faces American squadrons in vastly
complicated multiple dog-fights.
It has MIGs 17, 19, 21 (improved
and called “Silver Swallows”), and
lately MIG 23 may have turned up.
Pilots, like the SAM personnel, are
trained abroad. At first this caused a
waste of time and some inefficiency.
But the Vietnamese are determined to
run their own show. They won’t have
Russian or Chinese officers ordering
their men around. As a puzzled Polish
civilian electrical engineer put it to me:
“The Vietnamese are the proudest
bastards west of San Francisco.”
Proud, polite, and realistic. “Under-
stand,” they say, “we might have been
more efficient at first had we accepted
chez nous many of the exports gener-
ously offered by our friends. But after
we would have had so many problems,
ideological and otherwise . . .”
This meant, I feel, that military mis-
sions come to advise, suggest improve-
ments, learn sometimes (it’s a testing
ground, the Spain of the ’sixties), but
not to control or stay. There is not the
slightest evidence of Russians or
Chinese in command anywhere, not
even of a radar battery. After innum-
erable long talks with Hanoi old-timers,
all eager to prove how much their
socialist country was doing. I’d say
there are, all told no more than 12,000
Hanoi’s telephone exchange built with
East German money ... “we are foot-
ing the bill”
foreign experts from communist coun-
tries, including large Embassy staffs,
Bulgarian doctors, and Georgian geolo-
gists who are looking for coal.
To me, Saigon and South Vietnam
in 1964, with only 40,000 Americans,
seemed very Americanised. In 1967,
Hanoi and the Vietnamese Democratic
Republic didn’t look at all Russian or
Chinese.
From outside Vietnam, networks
bombard the Vietnamese with virulent
broadcasts. None is jammed. But in-
side North Vietnam both countries are
extraordinarily quiet. I’ve seen more
Red Guards' propaganda in Paris and
Hong Kong than in Hanoi. In the two
main libraries, under a few plaster busts
of Uncle Ho, one finds stacks of books
by Mac (Marx), Angghen (Engels,
very popular), Le-nin (the unmovable),
and Sta-lin.
One has to search hard to find the
collected texts of Mao Trach Dong
(Mao). Very few copies of the little
red book in glass cases. Portraits
of Mao here and there but in very
limited quantities and, in lithographic
form, his poems rather than his
thoughts. I noticed some Mao badges
on passersby, but generally on
children.
North Vietnam allocates two hours
only because they allocate two hours
of Russian and two of Chinese langu-
age courses in the secondary schools
(French will be back in 1970 and Eng-
lish won’t be far behind). Just as they
devote two columns to news from
Moscow and two to news from Peking
in “Nhan Dan,” the Party daily.
There’s a somewhat colonial view
of the Vietnamese, entertained not
only by citizens of ex-colonial powers.
It goes with the implication that the
ordinary North Vietnamese are kept
insulated from the Russia-China split.
True, “Nhan Dan” and other papers
don’t publish anything about the
quarrel. But this doesn’t mean that the
big controversy has been hidden away.
In fact, it has been discussed, as un-
polemically as possible, at all levels
of the Party, down to the village cells.
Pros and cons had been weighed,
long before escalation hit North Viet-
nam. Now the Vietnamese have found
their line on the split. It came out re-
cently ... in “Nhan Dan” and in
pamphlet form. It is an 18,000-word
document signed by M. Le Duan, First
Secretary of the Party and a very im-
pressive theoretician in his own quiet
way. This text certainly got the polit-
bureau’s imprimatur and was discussed
at all the higher echelons. Owing to a
forbidding title, “Forward Under the
Glorious Flag of the October Revo-
lution.”
More than anything else it is an
appeal for the reunification of the
“socialist camp.” Aimed at both Rus-
sians and Chinese, it says that “The
construction of socialism is very recent
. . . therefore errors result.” It under-
lines that reunification is the most
“urgent” problem. After the last
Havana Conference certain specialists,
particularly in Europe, came to the con-
clusion that the “Third Communism”
advocated by the Cubans, with “neither
Moscow nor Peking” as a motto, had
Hanoi’s approval. That is obviously not
the case. The Le Duan report salutes
the Cubans en passant with East Berlin
and Pyong-Yang (North Korea).
In Hanoi, whenever the Castroist and
Guevarist doctrine of “Vietnams
everywhere” was discussed, I heard
people saying: “Naturally, we are in
favor of any action that will hurt
American imperialism, but a Vietnam
can’t be created just like that. Revo-
lutions can’t be exported.”
Longing for a return to “the purity
of Marxism-Leninism,” the Le Duan
report distributes criticisms to Russians
and Chinese. Le Duan never uses the
Russian-flavored phrase “peaceful co-
existence,” but neither does he count,
with the Chinese, on the inevitability
of a third world war.
Malaysia
Inter-racial hate
AFTER TWO WEEKS of arson and
arbitrary arrests, sporadic violence and
snap curfews, Malaysia has become
sharply aware that a new, chilling
factor threatens this multi-colored com-
munity of Malays, Chinese, and
Indians.
Race war has become the, ultimate
yet ready-to-hand weapon of all politi-
cal extremists, from fanatical Left-wing
Chinese Maoists to fanatical Right-wing
Malay Muslims.
The recent anti-government protest
strike against partial devaluation,
called by the militant wing of the pre-
dominantly Chinese Labor Party in
Penang, immediately provoked clashes
between Chinese activists and Malay
stall-holders unwilling to close down
and so lose business, and between
Malays needing food and Chinese shop-
keepers who refused to open and serve
them.
Malay hooligans and Chinese secret
society gangsters fed the growing fury
by seizing the opportunities offejed for
intimidation and looting, and bloody
inter-racial outrages quickly followed.
Twenty-seven died, most of them
Chinese, some disembowelled, nearly
200 were injured, many horribly
mutilated.
Police have detained nearly 1700 in
eight States, and a repetition of the
savage brutality of Penang was only
prevented in Kuala Lumpur by an
intimidating display of Government
forces.
A fortnight after the first disorders
the curfew has been lifted in Penang,
but continues elsewhere, troops patrol
in touchy areas, and the police say
that they are planning a new, knock-
out blow against subversives, racial
rabble-rousers, and thugs.
They have closed 16 branches of the


Labor Party, which claims 10,000 mem-
bers, and have arrested more than 200
militants of the Maoist “Anti-Rightist
Front” within it.
The Front was inspired by the Red
Guards in China and communist rioters
in Hong Kong. It has circulated to
Party branches propaganda directives
broadcast by Radio Peking and copies
of Mao’s thoughts.
Since 1965 Communists in Malaysia
have obeyed a directive to promote
“the method of violent struggle” and
trainees from the urban underground
have been taken up to the Thai frontier
for instruction with the 600-strong
nucleus of the Malayan Communist
Party’s guerilla force.
Politicians have also been given an
invigorating three-day “baptism of
revolution” in the border jungle.
Muslim extremists have in turn been
inciting the Malays to turn on the
Chinese, bum down their villages, shops,
and sometimes kill. The authorities have
so far detained 40 Malay agitators and
provocateurs, most of them in the Op-
position Pan Malayan Islamic Party,
but several from the Prime Minister
Tunku Abdul Rahman’s United Malay
National Organisation.
The jealous cultural chauvinism of
frustrated youth on both sides now
provides the live link between political
action and racial strife. With Malays
receiving six out of seven posts in the
public service and Malay introduced as
the national language since September,
many young Chinese-educated Chinese
fear that their tongue and their tradi-
tions may be suppressed and their status
reduced to that of second-class citizens.
At the same time young Arabic-
speaking Malays trained in Islamic col-
leges find English-educated Chinese un-
believers holding posts for which they
themselves do not qualify in a modern,
secular administration.
The two groups often find their re-
spective outlets in the Maoist mob
action of the “Anti-Rightist Front” and

Patient Washkansky after the heart transplant... now for the ethical problems
Heart transplants
What about moral
compatibility?
THAT TRANSPLANTED HEART in
Mr. Washkansky, of Cape Town, opens
up exciting prospects but there are
moral, and legal, worries, too.
A surgeon can shop around for a
suitable donor only in the case of kid-
ney transplants, for a kidney is the only
transplantable organ of which a per-
son has a disposable surplus of one.
Theoretically, at least, a compatible
donor can be approached when alive
and asked to yield a kidney. With other
organs, and usually in practice with
kidneys, too, a surgeon has to rely on
a suitable donor turning up among the
dying. And since the organ must not
be diseased, the most suitable donor is
normally a person fatally injured in an
accident.
This scientific age, which has enabled
medicine to advance so fast, also yields,
year by year, through the motor-car, a
toll of young people with hopelessly
broken bodies. The problem before doc-
tors is that they often do not know,
when they start to treat an injured per-
son, whether his brain has been irre-
parably damaged.
If it has, they find themselves with
a living husk. A suitable case to give a
kidney, liver, lung, or heart if only he
could be allowed to die? Are doctors
going to be tempted not to try to save
the apparently hopeless case if his
organs are needed for transplants?
When, after all, is a person considered
dead? The minute his heart stops beat-
ing so that an organ can be whipped
out and transplanted? Speed is all-
important in transplantations, and there
is something a little horrifying in the
thought of doctors waiting like crows
for a compatible donor to die.
Nor is the legal position at all clear.
Countries, like Britain, that have legis-
lation on the matter usually permit
the removal of an organ if the dead
person had authorised it or, in the
absence of his express consent, if his
relatives do not object. But, again, this
means that the relatives have to be
approached at a particularly distressing
time. In 1964 the World Medical
Association produced, in the Declara-
tion of Helsinki, a code of ethics for
experiments on humans. Is it not time
the association tried to formulate
another one to deal with transplanta-
tion? The ethical problems may turn
out to be more intractable than the
surgical.
The Mediterranean
A Russian stay-in
EUROPEANS ARE at last waking up
to the uncomfortable fact that the
Russian fleet in the Mediterranean is
there to stay. Last week the Western
European Union endorsed a series of
tough resolutions on the defence of the-
Mediterranean. Except for four
Frenchmen who abstained, the vote
was unanimous. The resolutions call
for tighter supervision of naval vessels
passing through the Dardanelles in
order to make it less easy for the
Russians to slip missile-carrying ships
through the straits. They also say there
should be an international organisation
to ensure that all ships can pass freely
through the Suez canal.
This is fine, as far as it goes. The
NATO allies are willing in broad poli-
tical terms to co-operate in meeting
the Russian challenge in the Mediter-
ranean. But the political intent has to
be translated into a naval response to
the permanent presence of a Russian
fleet. Since the Israeli-Arab war,
Russia’s Mediterranean naval command
has kept at least a dozen surface ships
and four or five submarines in the
Mediterranean. At one time the
number was as high as 46. Soon that


fleet may be reinforced in a significant
way. Russia’s first helicopter-carrier has
been on trial in the Black Sea. A
second is being built at Odessa.
The Russian fleet has its own supply
and support ships. But it needs shore
bases as well. Ports in the Adriatic
would seem to be an obvious answer.
But the Albanians have seen the
Russians out of Valona. Yugoslavia’s
friendship is an uncertain quantity. In
any case, the Adriatic’s outlet to the
Mediterranean is narrow. The North
African coast doubtless strikes the
Russians as a better bet. In the eastern
Mediterranean they have already
secured suitable facilities at Alexandria
and Port Said. In the western Mediter-
ranean they must have hopes of using
their increased supply of arms to
Algeria as a lever to secure similar
facilities at Mers el Kebir, which the
French have decided to hand over to
Algeria in February.
NATO has begun to react to Russia’s
emergence into the warm water. Its
Mediterranean command structure was
strengthened earlier this year. There
are plans to create a permanent NATO
fleet of destroyers and frigates that
could be reinforced by cruisers and
aircraft-carriers. In addition to the
modern Italian fleet, there is the mas-
sive and continuing presence of the
United States Sixth Fleet of 50 ships.
But there are weaknesses. The Greek
and Turkish fleets need modernising:
how far are other Western countries
prepared to help them particularly
the Greeks, while the colonels stay in
power? Britain’s fleet in the area, once
so dominant, is negligible: is Britain
prepared to send ships back? As the
Mers el Kebir decision shows, the
French attitude is equivocal: how
closely can France be tied down to a
common naval policy in the Mediter-
ranean? The answer to such questions
could make the Mediterranean into
NATO’s second front.
Common Market
Eating the veto
AFTER GOD’s Press conference, it
should have been all over bar the shout™
ing. Curiously, it was not. Last week in
London the British were heroically
maintaining that thev demanded full
membership of the European Com-
munity and nothing short of it, while
in Paris agitated Gaullists were leaking
thoughts for an “arrangement” that
would leave Britain something, if only
hope and a certain amount of trade,
to cover the nakedness while she waits.
There is precious little substance, but
a great deal of tactics, in all this. Both
sides are now manoeuvring before the
next skirmish, the Council of Ministers’
Britain’s EEC negotiator, Lord Chalfont
meeting on December 18th. For Britain
this means keeping its backbone ram-
rod-stiff, in the hope of stiffening the
backbone of its allies. Mr. Jean Rey,
president of the European Commission,
and Mr. Luns, the Dutch Foreign
Minister, got the full British treatment
in London at the start of the week.
To no one’s surprise, Mr. Luns said
he agreed with it.
Meanwhile, the Belgians, trying to
line up formal consultations to work
out a common policy against France,
ran straight into the objections of
Germany, determined that though de
Gaulle may offend the whole of
Europe no one must offend de Gaulle.
This policy is less craven that it
sounds, since the General, unlike the
others, is possibly prepared to use the
ultimate deterrent of breaking up the
Community. He made this point at
his Press conference and had it
repeated four days later by his
Information Minister, M. Gorse, in
case anyone had missed it.
On the French side the aim no,
be fair, the effect—has been to under-
mine allied morale by offering a vague
compromise that might appeal to all
those who know that they stand to
suffer if they create a crisis in the
Community on Britain’s behalf. The
first shot was fired by a Gaullist deputy
to the European parliament in Stras-
bourg a fortnight ago. He said that
while everyone was of course agreed
•that Britain should ultimately join the
Community (has not the French Presi-
dent said so?), in the meantime how
about a little mutual preference on in-
dustrial goods and some British pur-
chases of European agricultural pro-
ducts at Community prices?
An interesting idea, said M. Gorse
next day, not inspired, of course, but
one of the things the Six could talk
about a little mutual preference on in-
echoing President de Gaulle’s view that
Britain would have to undergo pro-
found mutations before it could enter
Europe, put his own more helpful twist
on it by suggesting that the Community
itself must adapt, notably in monetary
policy, and that the separate orbits of
the two could then bring them auto-
matically to “a rendezvous in space.”
Somewhat similar ideas for setting
out consecutive stages through which
Britain must pass before achieving
membership are in orbit around Brus-
sels. It is hoped they could be dressed
up, for consumption in Paris, as being
no more than stages of the radical
transformation that will enable Britain
to claim the warm welcome the French
President is reserving for it. Even M.
Gorse seemed to hint at this, when
he suggested that the Six could usefully
discuss, in dispassionate technical terms,
what the conditions of British entry
might be. From Britain it looked as if
Paris was trying to deliver its veto and
eat it, too.
U.S. Presidency, the Democrats
"You cannot wound a king"
TO THE LAY EAR, President John-
son’s recent disparaging references to
“some kids” and “some boys” as the
sources of all the rumors surrounding
Mr. Robert McNamara’s resignation as
Defence Secretary may have sounded
innocent enough. But no one in this
goldfish bowl of a capital is in any
doubt as to precisely whom the Presi-
dent had in mind. For the first time in
his four years in the White House, Mr.
Johnson had publicly taken off against
the Kennedys.
The wonder, perhaps, is that it has
not happened before, that it should
have required the attempted political
exploitation by the Kennedy brothers
of Mr. McNamara’s mysterious depart-
ure from the Government to bring the
personal antagonism between the two
rival dynasties within the Democratic
Party out into the open. Yet, now that
that has taken place, all forecasts and
prophecies for next year’s contest for
the American Presidency need to be re-
assessed.
There are moments when the foreign
correspondent working in this politi-
cally Byzantine city has to rely more on
personal hunch than on public state-
ments, and this is probably one of
them. Despite all his declarations to the
contrary and his denials of any immedi-
ate Presidential ambitions, Senator
Robert Kennedy now looks far more
likely next summer to be fighting Presi-
dent Johnson for the Democratic
Party’s nomination than to be sitting
quietly by on the sidelines allowing the
President to swamp all opposition to
the Vietnam war, whether expressed by
Senator Eugene McCarthy or anyone
else.
That, of course, is not to say that
Bobby Kennedy has planned it that


way, he almost certainly has not. But
even politicians as powerful and
charismatic as the Kennedys are not
always masters of their own fate or
captains of their own destiny. In the
past few weeks, events and forces have
started to move on a set course that
looks increasingly as if it can logically
lead to only one result an historic,
almost Shakespearian, confrontation be-
tween the reigning monarch and those
whom his own accession dispossessed.
What, in retrospect, may well be con-
Senator Robert Kennedy... on a collision course
sidered to have set the whole collision
course is something that at the time did
not look especially sinister. It is a well-
established principle of American public
life for politicians to write, or have
written for them, books giving their
views on the questions of the hour.
Last month Senator Robert Kennedy
did just that, and the Sunday supple-
ments are still carrying huge advertise-
ments for his latest collection of essays
and speeches, “To Seek a Newer
World.” What all those advertisements,
however, fail to draw attention to is
the stick of dynamite that the book
contains.
Right from the beginning of the open
U.S. military commitment in Vietnam,
in the summer of 1965, it has con-
sistently been the Administration’s con-
tention that there has never been a
single occasion on which there was a
serious chance of getting negotiations
going. It is this assertion that Senator
Kennedy coolly contradicts and not
just with a general statement, but with
a detailed chapter-and-verse account of
how last winter Mr. Johnson and Sec-
retary of State Mr. Dean Rusk be-
tween them effectively destroyed the
last best chance of a negotiated settle-
ment that the U.S. is ever likely to
have in Vietnam.
What the Senator’s charge adds
up to is not merely an indictment of
the Administration’s actions at the
time the Soviet Prime Minister, Mr.
Kosygin, was in London. It also neces-
sarily involves an implicit accusation
that the President and his Secretary
of State have misled the American
people ever since about what really
then happened.
From the White House’s point of
view, and there at least they lost no
time in getting the message, that was
bad enough. But worse was to come.
Only one week later, appearing on a
nationally networked television pro-
gramme, Bobby Kennedy tried to re-
move from the President the one
personal prop that LBJ has constantly
used in all his public defences of the
conduct of the Vietnam war. The
American commitment in Vietnam,
Bobby Kennedy declared, was now dif-
ferent in substance and kind from that
which his brother, former President
John Kennedy, had stood by and sup-
ported between 1961 and 1963. Charg-
ing that America’s moral position had
been “seriously undermined” by the
latest political justifications offered for
the war, Kennedy suddenly became un-
characteristically emotional.
“We’ve changed, we’ve switched,” he
blurted out. “We’re doing it, not be-
cause they want it, but because we
want it. So we’re in there killing
women, we’re killing innocent people
all because we don’t want a war
to be fought on American soil, or be-
cause the Communists are now 12,000
miles away and they might get 11,000
miles away.”
To the White House it was a far
more dangerous and damaging assault
than any of Senator Kennedy’s earlier
criticisms. What he was saying, in
essence, was that President Johnson had
betrayed the high moral principles that
he inherited from his predecessor, and
therefore was no longer entitled to
defend his policy in terms of John F.
Kennedy’s memory. It was immediately
apparent that it was not the type of
attack that could be brushed aside.
In any case, Senator Kennedy soon
left no doubt that he had not intended
it to be. Without actually endorsing
his colleague, Senator Eugene
McCarthy, in his coming peace bid
in the Democratic Party primaries
against the President, he has made it
absolutely clear where his sympathies
lie, even to the point of at least
temporarily withdrawing the pledge of
support that he had previously given
to the Johnson-Humphrey ticket.
And to put the family position be-
yond any possible speculation, the
Senator’s younger brother, Teddy
Kennedy, has just announced that, even
if he is requested by the White House
to stand against Senator McCarthy in
the Massachusetts primary next April,
he will refuse.
The only thing that remains in doubt
is whether Bobby Kennedy yet recog-
nises the cumulative logic of his own
actions.
To talk to Robert Kennedy cer-
tainly still gives the impression of a
man who is trying desperately, though
perhaps with an increasing convic-
tion of hopelessness, to avoid a kind of
high noon encounter with LBJ in the
Chicago stockyards next August. He
firmly and probably genuinely
argues that the real casualty of such
a duel beneath the arc-lights would
not be himself, or even the President,
but rather the whole Democratic Party
and its program.
If LBJ has really now decided on
war with the Kennedys, then it is hard
to see it being anything but a war
to death. Conceivably that is some-
thing that Bobby Kennedy has already
accepted. “You cannot,” he murmured
softly the other day, “wound a king.”
Somehow it could not help sounding
a strangely ominous remark.
U.S. Presidency, the Republicans
Will it be lucky Dick this time?
FOR MANY AMERICANS the an-
nouncement last week of the engage-
ment of Mr. Richard Nixon’s daughter
to ex-President Eisenhower’s grandson
has banished the last doubt. In the
current dynastic era of American poli-
tics it has begun to look almost pre-
ordained that next August it will be
the indestructible former Vice-President
Nixon who makes his way toward the
Republican convention podium humbly
to receive, for the second time in eight
years, his Party’s nomination for the
Presidency.
That, anyway, is the assumption
on which the White House is working.
In the next few months it is likely to
be reflected in' a much tougher line, if


HIGHLIGHTS FROM NATIONAL BANK
CHAIRMAN’S 1967 ADDRESS
BUSINESS RECOVERY ASSISTED BY BANK LENDING. The more flexible policy of the Re-
serve Bank and the Government, supported by leaving the trading banks in a somewhat
easier liquid position, has enabled the provision by the banking system of a consider-
able measure of financial assistance to the community over the last twelve months.
Loans outstanding rose by s63om. and the moderate recovery in business this year
would have been impossible without this assistance. Banks have been able to enter
lending fields which in recent years were virtually held as the prerogative of financiers
outside the banking system. We have every hope that the development of bank lending
on a broad and diversified front will continue in the future within the overall policy
set by the authorities as required by changing economic circumstances.
AFTER DEVALUATION OF STERLING. I believe that from the long-run point of view our
Government acted correctly in deciding not to reduce the value of our Dollar even if,
in the short-run, together with the drought, there could be adverse effects upon certain
of our primary export products. One must agree with the Prime Minister’s assessment
that maintaining the value of our currency should be anti-inflationary rather than the
reverse. In less sophisticated days of monetary management the present position and
outlook would doubtless have given rise to much concern. Nobody should feel this way
today, because the resources exist for the banking system to continue to play its full
part in providing appropriate support as necessary. Shareholders are advised that the
overall effect of devaluation on the bank should be very small.
HESITANCY IN WORLD BUSINESS. In the past twelve months or so hesitancy had developed
in business activity in a number of overseas countries and uncertainties appeared in
world trade. But one has seen much constructive effort directed to the reduction of
impediments to trade. Progress has been achieved in the realm of tariffs, and strenuous
efforts have been made to avoid the hamstringing effects of inadequate finance. On this
latter point, it is of much interest to us that the plan announced recently in Rio de
Janeiro to increase the financial resources available through the International Monetary
Fund should become operative as soon as possible. Another important development is
that business is steadily and surely becoming more international in character and,
despite all the difficulties, businessmen and industrialists are gradually breaking through
national barriers in the interests of improving productive efficiency.
SMOOTHING THE “STOP-GO”. The general objective of these co-operative moves among
the nations is broadly in line with the new emphasis in our country on the need to
achieve steady growth in business and industry, if possible devoid of “fits and starts”.
Here, in Australia, the monetary management policies evolved in recent years together
with the changed functioning of the banking system are important elements in smooth-
ing the “stop-go” process.
NEW COMPUTER CENTRE. The Bank has ordered an TBM System/360 Model 30 com-
puter for installation in Melbourne in late 1968. A six-storeyed Data Processing Centre
will be built on a site in Lansdowne Street, East Melbourne. Completion is scheduled
to meet computer delivery arrangements and total cost, including the computer and
ancillary equipment, will be over s3m. This entry into electronic processing, and its
extension to other capital cities in due course, will enable new and improved services
to customers, and will progressively assist branch staff in handling the growing volume
of business.
ACCOUNTS. Consolidated net profit increased by $1,308,000 (up 39.5%) to $4,617,000
despite a substantial upward movement in expenses of $3,597,000. An increase of
slo7m. brought consolidated balance sheet assets to over $'1,372m.

not on the war abroad, then at least
on civil disorders at home.
But if the White House is already
taking the necessary precautions to deal
with a traditional Nixon jugular attack
it is certainly not running scared. In a
troubled and difficult political period
the one thing, indeed, that is said to
be keeping President Johnson cheerful
is the prospect of waging an election
campaign against a man whom he has
publicly and privately despised ever
since they first sat in the Senate to-
gether 17 years ago.
Within the White House the reasons
for the President’s relief and delight
are rehearsed fluently and persuasively.
Nixon, one is told, has that most fatal
liability for any politician the reputa-
tion of being a born loser. On top of
that, his candidacy will unite the ranks
of the Democratic Party as nothing else
could.
The final reason and understand-
ably this is delivered slightly more sotto
Senator Nixon... hardliner
voce is that the mere presence of
Nixon’s name on the ballot will auto-
matically cancel out LBJ’s greatest
single electoral weakness the popular
impression of the President as “a
wheeler-dealer.” Was not, after all, the
most lethal thing ever said about Rich-
ard Nixon contained in that simple
question, “Would you buy a second-
hand car from this man?”?
Yet if the case against Nixon is so
strong, why are the Republicans as
the polls both of ordinary Republican
voters and of likely convention dele-
gates each show apparently so keen
to embrace him as their standard-bearer
even before he has formally announced
his candidacy?
The easy answer (and the one that
is still keeping the White House laugh-
ing) lies in the old gibe that the Grand
Old Party is stupid, that give a group
of Republican Party workers a choice
between the path to victory (Rocke-
feller) and the way to the tomb
(Nixon) and they will infallibly settle,
as they did in 1960, on the latter.
The fact, however, is that a lot of
shrewd observers as well as influential
Republicans are now looking at Mr.
Nixon with their eyes wide open, and
the more they study him as a potential
candidate the more his undoubted assets
seem to outweigh his alleged liabilities.
Some bright Republicans have even
tumbled to a fact that currently seems
to be escaping the Democrats: that
whatever the provocative power of the
“Tricky Dick” legend for people as old
as the President, it means little or
nothing to the great mass of new
American voters. These younger voters,
it is claimed, see in the former Vice-
President a capable, no-nonsense figure
who, on grounds of experience, ability,
and a flawless command of political
issues (especially foreign policy ones),
is uniquely qualified to take over the
Presidency at a difficult time in the
nation’s history.
Nor does the “loser” argument make
anything like a universal impact—in
fact it is now being openly canvassed,
if in a slightly specialist sense, as one
of Nixon’s strongest electoral advan-
tages.
A favorite anecdote among the Nixon
staff concerns a four-year-old girl who
in 1961 watched a presidential Press
conference on television. “Mummy,”
she is said to have inquired proudly,
“that’s Mr. Kennedy, isn’t it?” “Yes,
dear,” came the indulgent reply, only to
be met instantly with a second query.
“But, Mummy, why’s his friend Mr.
Nixon not with him?”
Nixon himself certainly believes to-
day that one of the strongest things he
has going for him is his identification
in the public mind with the Kennedy
campaign of 1960 and in particular the
widespread memory of his participation
in those four televised debates now en-
shrined as a kind of historical high-
point of American democracy in action.
The debates, he accepts, may have
ruined his chances of gaining the Presi-
dency in 1960. But, more than any
other factor, they have, he believes,
made it possible for him to do what
no American politician has done before
—bounce back not just after a Presi-
dential defeat but after being denied
the nomination in the intervening elec-
tion as well.
It is impossible, in fact, to discuss
Nixon without acknowledging what he
has already achieved even in terms of
being a Republican prospect for 1968.
His defeat in 1962 for the Californian
Governorship, a defeat in retrospect
made all the more humiliating by Ron-
ald Reagan’s easy victory against the
same incumbent Democratic governor
four years later, would have finished
any normal political career. And for a
time, not least in the famous Press
conference in which he responded to
the voters’ verdict, Nixon himself seems
to have accepted that he had indeed
reached the end of the road.
He left California for New York,
set himself up in an exclusive Wall
Street law firm and an expensive Fifth
Avenue apartment, and appeared all set
to foe the second Thomas E. Dewey
produced by the Republicans in a
single generation.
Yet, only four years later in the
mid-term elections of November, 1966,
it was he once again who was leading
the whole Republican Congressional
campaign. It was a 'highly successful
campaign by giving the Republicans
their biggest gains in 20 years and
since then things could hardly have
gone more promisingly for Nixon.
Not everything that has happened,
of course, has been the result of his
own planning. He could not, for ex-
ample, have foreseen that his immediate
and obvious rival for the nomination,
George Romney, of Michigan, would
collapse so ignominiously that today
Nixon aides are actually trying to prop
the Governor’s candidature up lest the
expected victories against him in the
primaries are regarded as too hollow
to have any meaning. Nor could Nixon
possibly have counted on the once-
serious threat to him from the Right
—from Governor Reagan, of Califor-
nia suddenly losing its momentum
under the cloud of a staff scandal and
a smoke-screen of misleading statements
about it from the Governor’s office.
Yet on the central issue and the
one that is certain to provide the main
theme of any Presidential campaign he
eventually mounts Richard Nixon
is entitled to claim that he gambled,
and that the gamble was for very high
stakes indeed. It was not, as he insists,
altogether easy last September for a
presidential aspirant to hold a hard-
line position on Vietnam at a time
when two of his potential rivals were
defecting to the “dove” side of the
argument.
But with his instinctive feel for basic
American public opinion, Nixon stood
firm even going to the length of
accusing President Johnson of being
“altogether too obsessed with the risks
involved in taking the requisite
military steps to shorten the war.” He
has even lately taken to reminding
visitors with a touch of vindicated pride
that he almost alone in the Eisenhower
administration proposed sending in
American paratroopers to relieve the
French garrison at Dien Bien Phu as
long ago as 1954.
If all this inevitably sounds eerily
reminiscent of the Goldwater campaign
of 1964, there remains one essential
and vital difference. Then LBJ was
lucky enough to be opposed by an
amateur. That is the last description
even his enemies would apply to Rich-
ard Nixon, already at 54 the oldest
trouper in the business.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Miscalculation on private
capital spending
FOR ALL THE CONTINUING
strength of most of the economic in-
dicators, the vital one that the Govern-
ment set out to encourage in its Aug-
ust budget private capital expendi-
ture is still showing no signs of pick-
ing up. Despite the recent Statistician’s
survey showing that private businesses
expected their spending on fixed capital
equipment in the first half of 1967-68
to increase by 5j percent on the same
six months of last year, so far the
figures have shown no confirmation of
that trend.
In fact, they have shown quite the
opposite, with September quarter pri-
vate capital spending being six percent
down on the same quarter of last year,
due to lower spending by both manu-
facturing industry (particularly chemi-
cals) and service industries (particularly
the wholesale and retail trades). Con-
firming this trend has been the lower
level of new share and debenture issues
made by Australian public companies in
the three months ended September. The
rate of new share issues in the current
quarter does not appear to have picked
up much above last quarter’s $14.8
million and debenture raising appears
steady, so there seems little prospect
that the earlier forecast of a rise in
private capital expenditure will be
achieved in the six months to December.
There have been special reasons why
Head office for the Wales
the Government’s August expectations
about rising private capital spending
have not been met; the drought in
southern Australia is a big factor. And
there could be some further upsets as
a result of Britain’s devaluation,
although this should not have any major
effect. The only growth areas reported
in the September quarter statistics were
of capital investment in mining, up more
than 40 percent to $67 million; trans-
port up 16 percent to $35 million; and
Vehicle manufacture up $3.4 million to
$13.1 million.
But this slow rate of growth may not
be as serious as it looks, as there is a
growing queue of companies planning
to approach the market in the new year
(led by BHP, which plans a share issue
to finance steel expansion and a deben-
ture issue to pay for its oil develop-
ments). But the Government will need
to keep a very close eye on the dis-
appointing performance of this key in-
dicator of our rate of economic ad-
vance, especially as the economy is
entering a period of tighter liquidity
and higher interest rates which could
reduce the flow of funds available to
businessmen thinking about expanding.
Advertising
Agency troubles
MAJOR FINANCIAL TROUBLES
have hit the American company of two
prominent Sydney advertising agencies,
Hansen Rubensohn-McCann Erickson
and Pritchard Wood and Partners, both
of which are subsidiaries of Interpublic
Inc. This, the world’s biggest adver-
tising agency group, is now undergoing
“emergency surgery” to save it from
a $l.B million loss on its $620 million
operations in 1967. Wielding the scalpel
is Robert Healy, 63-year-old financial
ace of Madison Avenue, the heart of
the American advertising business. He
was recalled from semi-retirement three
weeks ago to take over as president
from Marion Harper, 51, the man who
built Interpublic.
Last year the Interpublic agencies
handled advertising worth $560 million
throughout the world. Interpublic’s net
profit was reported to be less than
$BB,OOO. McCann-Erickson, which had
gross billings of $406 million, was said
to have netted only $7OOO.
Seventeen months ago, the Inter-
public group split itself into two divi-
sions: Interpublic Inc., covering advert-
ising agency operations, its Marplan re-
search service, a sales promotion arm
called SCI, and Infoplan public rela-
tions units; the other division, Market
Planning Corp., encompassed some ten
newer and more experimental projects.
These include a publications division
to produce books and newsletters on
marketing, a Products Development
Workshop, a media research evaluation
company, Fashion International, and a
company called International Business
Relations to provide help for interna-
tional financing and assist clients in
mergers and acquisitions.
The more promising of the Market
Planning sections from a profit point
of view will probably be merged with
the Interpublic advertising agencies;
the less promising may be abandoned.
Healy’s economy drive is also ex-
pected to include the merging of some
of the group’s advertising agencies.
Bank buildings
Prestige matters
THE BANK OF N.S.W.’s new head
office building, at the top of Sydney’s
Martin Place, will do more when com-
pleted in 1970 than be a striking land-
mark 33 storeys high. It will also end
the idea of relating the two buildings
facing each other on the Phillip Street-
Martin Place-Macquarie Street blocks.
In earlier schemes for the vacant site
on which the Wales is now to build, the
proposal had been to have something
that somehow matched the 20-storey
Reserve Bank building opposite. But in
the end, after years of dilly-dallying,
the City Council was glad enough to
find someone to get on with the job.
For the Reserve Bank, of course, there
is a question of prestige. Dr. Coombs’
marble palace has dominated Martin
Place in recent years; now the symbol
of bureaucratic power is to be heavily
■dominated by one of the “free enter-
prise” banks. But the Reserve Bank will
probably retain one advantage over its
neighbor across the road; it will pre-
sumably be 'by far the more lavishly
furnished of the two (although the
Wales is to have carpet in all offices)
and will have by far the better collec-
tion of modern Australian painting. Per-
haps that is what distinguishes private
from public enterprise these days.


BRIEFLY
For the economy: Australia’s trade deficit for the five
1967-68 months to November stood at $69.8 million, against
the corresponding 1966-67 figure of $36.6 million. Novem-
ber’s exports reached $284.1 million, while imports totalled
$269.6 million—to give a favorable balance of $14.5 million
(previous November, $9.9 million).
Seasonally adjusted, private capital expenditure for the
September quarter was $404.5 million, just $1.3 million
ahead of the June quarter; the respective 1966 totals were
$430.2 million and $429.3 million . . . Listed companies
raised $46.6 million in share capital and $lOl.B million in
debentures during the June and September quarters; the
respective 1966 raisings were $65.7 million and $124.4
million.
The trading banks approved new and increased overdrafts
at an average $31.2 million a week in the month ended
November 8; last year’s comparable average was $26.4
million.
For the markets: Both industrials and mining issues
on Australian share markets looked quite uncertain again
at the close, following' a considerable midweek lift; turn-
overs aren’t impressive.
London made do with some highly selective buying
following the new Chancellor’s warning speech . . . Light
selling pressure sent Wall Street drifting back.
For companies: Some of the giants were prominent,
especially BHP, which foreshadowed a March issue of short
and medium term debentures to finance the Bass Strait oil
and gas developments; existing share and debenture holders
will possess sole rights, without specific entitlements . . .
Higher sales did not give Australian Consolidated Industries
a profit for the first half of its 1967-68 year; the
group is also to suffer from the New Zealand devaluation
. . . Most of Bums Philp’s variegated activities appear to be
moving well, particularly the retail subsidiaries; shipping
operations may be continued, “even if only partly,” in spite
of the loss of a Commonwealth subsidy.
Two years of retreating profits were reversed by Common-
wealth Industrial Gases, which went to a record $3,111,954
(1966, $2,362,095; 1965, $2,809,502); on a 20 percent earn-
ing rate, 11 percent is paid . . . Iron, steel, and aluminium
merchant William Adams is still experiencing lower earn-
ings on rising sales—an 8 percent drop in 1967-68’s first half;
directors hope the full year will be “comparable” with
1966-67.
A firm bid from Stocks and Holdings for the Australia
Hotel is not expected to restrain bids from Lend Lease Cor-
poration and L. J. Hooker; a “mystery” buyer of shares on
the market seems to have ceased this form of operation.
Retailer Myer Emporium's debenture issue drew
$19,525,700, of which $7,525,700 is to be returned . . .
Sydney’s Buckinghams has sold its Oxford Street store site
for $1.2 million; it will be redeveloped by a life office,
building be done by Lend Lease Corporation.
Australia’s largest aluminium producer, Alcoa, may well
be doubling output from Port Henry (Vic.) during the next
few years; the only question is what rate of expansion . . .
Conzinc Riotinto of Australia is to join with Kaiser Steel
and Pickands Mather to examine the feasibility of develop-
ing the Associated Oil group’s coal deposits at Bluff (Queens-
land) . . . Still coping with bugs in the current expansion
program is Mount Isa, which must also look forward to a
world oversupply of copper; the mine’s latest exploratory
finds look very encouraging . . . Loloma does not propose
an issue to finance its Great Boulder entitlement.
W.A.’s Swan Brewery intends a one-for-ten bonus, after
which (he prevailing 13 percent dividend should be main-
tained . . . Sydney’s Tooheys is contemplating building a new
brewery in Canberra.
Soft ice-cream has almost melted away Mr. Whippy
Holdings’ shareholders’ funds; the company lost $3.4 million
in 17 months to June, $735,028 being the trading loss . . .
Marrickville Holdings is talking about “profitless prosperity”
in food manufacturing.
a MATTERS
ALTHOUGH SCOTCH HAS TAKEN
over from Wesley at the head of the
House of Were in the person of Mr.
J. Campbell Johnston, just underneath
him is one of the late Staniforth
Ricketson’s old Wesley proteges, Mr.
C. Rodney Eggleston, who has actually
been with Weres three years longer,
since 1932 that is, than the new senior
partner. Both got their partnerships
at the same time, 20 years ago, soon
after they left the services, where
Johnston was in both the Army and
the Navy and Eggleston in the Army
(the Naval and Military Club is the
most “natural” hunting ground for
them among several choices of Mel-
bourne clubs they belong to).
Like Mr. Ricketson, “Cam” Johnston
has been a stockbroker most of his life,
which began at’Kyneton fifty-five years
ago, and took him to Adelaide for a
while, then to Melbourne to school, and
later to qualify as a chartered account-
ant and graduate in commerce at Mel-
bourne University before joining Weres
in 1935 (after an exploratory lunch
with S.R.).
In recent years Johnston has become
a prominent member of the Stock Ex-
change Committee (something Ricket-
son fought shy of), to which he was first
elected thirteen years back. About a
year ago he was made vice-chairman of
the Stock Exchange, a post he took
over from the present chairman, Mr.
C. T. Looker. In the recent months
of Mr. Ricketson’s illness, Johnston has
been deputising for him in the chair
at the meetings of the various Capel
Court companies,
THE TRAFFIC in international oil
searchers in and out of Australia has
been pretty thick these past few years.
In one way or another most of it has
been to good purpose in advancing the

Shell Development’s general manager,
who has held that job since 1962, is to
leave for other overseas oil horizons
before Christmas and will be succeeded
by Mr. Hugh Wilson from London.
Spinks hasn’t had as much success
as some, but he’s activated the Shell
group to spend a lot more on oil search
than it’s ever done before. Of the s3sm.
it has spent to date, sl3m. was in 1967
Hugh Wilson
“Cam” Johnston
alone. Spinks will not leave Australia
empty-handed, however, because during
his stay he saw Shell with its two-
sevenths interest in Wapet share in
the discovery and development of
Barrow Island, now our biggest pro-
ducing oilfield. The hope must be that
this will encourage Mr. Wilson to leave
the giant Sedco rig in these waters yet
awhile, despite its unproductive labors
in three attejnpts thus far. But there’s
no knowing. Like Spinks, he has a
strong Celtic streak, being a master of
geology from Edinburgh University as
well as an honors graduate in natural
science from Trinity College, Dublin.


THE NEW MARKETING PLAN AND WOOL'S FUTURE
WOOL IS IN trouble. Sections of
the industry are demanding a sub-
sidy and further tax concessions; the
Government is considering what to
do to ease the problems that have
mounted with Australia’s decision
not to devalue; competition from
synthetics continues to mount; wool
prices show no long-term signs of
halting their steady decline; dry con-
ditions are again making it very dif-
ficult for many graziers; costs of
production continue to rise; many
producers are switching to wheat.
In the past ten years, wool’s share
of Australia’s export income has
fallen from one-half to one-quarter
(and is continuing to fall so far this
year), and the same goes for its
role in the gross value of farm pro-
duction —down from 43 percent to
22 percent in the last decade.
It is against this background that
■the Australian Wool Board has pre-
sented its latest proposals to change
the wool-marketing system; pro-
posals that represent a fundamental
alteration to the free-market system.
These come up before the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference in
February of next year and have
already aroused considerable public
debate —despite Sir William Gunn’s
plea to keep the discussion of the
new plan “rational and private” (out
of the newspapers!) in the hope of
avoiding the acrimony and argu-
ment over the unsuccessful 1965
proposals that split the industry.
The new proposals, the outcome
of a majority of only one out of
the five-man committee set up by
the AWB, were accompanied by a
minority report that described the
whole idea of having a statutory
authority to intervene in the wool
market as arrogant, even though the
latest scheme is certainly less am-
bitious and more flexible than the
1965 reserve-price scheme. The big
woolgrowers, the woolbrokers, and
the buyers of wool (particularly the
Japanese) are once again rising to
the attack, using as ammunition the
failure of New Zealand’s attempt to
control prices through its scheme.
The latest Gunn scheme has been
presented simply as a method of
evening out short-term fluctuations
in the price of wool, rather than
interfering with the basic free-
auction principle. But there is no
doubt that it involves a fundamental
change in wool marketing and that
it would take skill for a marketing
authority to know when a price fall
was a temporary fluctuation and
when it was a basic downtrend
according to critics it would cer-
tainly require more skill than the
New Zealand authorities showed.
The scheme would create a seven-
man marketing authority that would
have control over about 40 percent
of the clip. It would do this by
making four bales the minimum
marketable parcel of wool at auction.
All wool in smaller lots would go to
the marketing authority and be
either interlotted or reclassified and
put up for auction by the authority.
But if the price was unreasonably
low during short periods, the auth-
ority could withdraw this wool from
auction and put it on again when
.the price went up. Woolgrowers
whose wool was marketed by the
authority would get prices based on
a six-monthly pool of income. These
pools, which would serve the pur-
pose of giving growers an average
price, would also be available to
growers who did have marketable
lots of wool in their own right.
And because the pool system
would delay payment for six months,
the scheme proposes that growers
should receive an advance payment
for 60 percent of the estiniated value
of their wool within two weeks of
its being delivered. This would re-
quire loans ' totalling about sl3sm.
in September, October, and Novem-
ber each year.
Recently, the Committee for the
Economic Development of Australia
held a seminar in Melbourne to dis-
cuss wool’s future in the light of the
new marketing plan. On this and
following pages are extracts of what
was an important discussion of a
major topic.
RONALD ANDERSON
“Marketing is not the greatest prob-
lem facing the woolgrowing industry
today; I deplore its preoccupation with
marketing over the past ten years,” Mr.
Ronald Anderson, agricultural pub-
lisher, told the seminar. He continued:
I am not saying that marketing is
unimportant, or that it should not be
receiving considerable attention, but a
preoccupation with the subject, almost
to the exclusion of all else, has diverted
a large part of the industry’s energies
into a single, rather narrow, channel. As
a result, other perhaps more important
matters have been either ignored or
tackled piecemeal in a half-hearted
fashion.
Five years ago the wool industry
seemed to be gaining a definite forward
momentum. Then came the abortive
marketing campaign and reserve-price
referendum of 1965, and how much has
been accomplished since? I have been
shocked over the past few months to
hear people of influence saying, or in-
ferring, that the Australian wool indus-
try is finished, that woolgrowing is no
longer profitable, and that wool is
doomed to be overwhelmed by man-
made fibres.
It must be readily apparent to any
but the most dyed-in-the-wool optimist
that one day wool will be relegated to
the position of a fashionable anachron-
ism; it will become simply a luxury
fibre, possessing no great physical
advantages over its cheaper rivals and
sought after only by the rich because
of its snob appeal. But this situation
need not occur in the immediate future
and even when the blow does fall it
will do so gradually. A wool industry
will doubtless continue to exist some-
where in the world to cater for this
snob demand, and by that time much
of the world’s area now used for wool
production will be needed for other pur-
poses. The pastoral zone of Australia,
in particular, must therefore stand a


very good chance of remaining one of
the few areas in which woolgrowing has
a good chance of surviving well into
the 21st century.
The fact that the Australian wool
industry as we know it today may one
day be doomed is no argument for
throwing in the towel. If woolgrowers
can overcome their cost-price problems
(and I believe most of them can), wool-
growing should remain profitable for
several decades yet. Most people now
engaged in woolgrowing should, with
foresight and reasonable intelligence,
see out their days in the industry.
The futui'e of the Australian wool in-
dustry depends, perhaps more today
than ever before, on the woolgrower
himself. It is the effort the woolgrower
makes today and in the years immedi-
ately ahead that will determine the in-
dustry’s span of profitability.
Wool prices are obviously unlikely to
maintain levels very much above those
now ruling, at least in the long-term.
They could well go lower. To remain in
business, therefore, the woolgrower
must increase his productivity; he must
pare his costs to the bone and produce
more wool. Fortunately, a wide margin
exists for increased productivity.
Our national lambing and marking
rates are little short of woeful and
our sheep population grossly inadequate
to graze the ever-increasing area of im-
proved pastures available in normal
seasons.
A tremendous need now exists for a
national drive to improve productivity.
The Australian Wool Board has made a
few efforts in this direction and
achieved some success, but the board,
like the whole woolgrowing industry,
has had its energies sapped by the need
to deal with this question of marketing.
Much of the blame for the industry’s
failure to tackle productivity must rest,
however, on woolgrower organisations
and their leaders. With a few notable
exceptions (and they are a few) grower
organisations would much rather fight
and argue among themselves than get
on with the duller business of helping
their members produce more wool. Too
many grower leaders are wrapped up
in their own petty jealousies and dom-
estic pow'er struggles.
I am not talking about all wool-
growers, of course. I can think of a
number of men against whom these
charges could never be levelled, but
how effective have even these men been
in achieving either unity of purpose or
unity of action? Australia has at least
100,000 woolgrowers; these men, their
families, employees, and suppliers
should be a potent political and
economic force. But many grower
organisations only pay lip-service to
the ideal of unity. The result is that
much of the progress that has been
made in the wool industry in recent
years has been in spite of, rather than
because of, the woolgrower organisa-
tions.
This lack of grower unity suits many
people, of course. It suits the Common-
wealth Government and it suits
those sections of the Australian and
international wool industi'y whose
commercial interests tend to run
counter to those of the woolgrower.
There were those who hoped that the
formation of the Australian Wool In-
dustry Conference would create at least
an illusion of unity, but the conference
has done little, if anything, to bring
the opposing groups within the industry
to their senses.
Woolgrowers still have no single,
national voice, no single policy. The
Wool Industry Conference has, in its
five years, been little more than an echo
chamber for the querulous voices of
the major grower organisations. This
failure of the conference has been
one of the tragedies of recent years.
In theory the conference should have
been a vehicle for uniting the wool-
growing industry; it should have been
a form for exhaustive and objective
debate; it should have been away out
in front, leading the industry. But in
pi’actice the AWIC has been a
prisoner of its structure. Its members
go along not to represent woolgrowers
as a whole but as the appointees of
their organisations. After five years,
voting is still predominantly along or-
ganisational lines and many of the
major problems of woolgrowing have
gone undiscussed. An elected Wool
Industry Conference would provide at
least part of the answer, but this seems
as far away as the day every merino
carries a 151 b. fleece.
I do not believe that wool market-
ing is, in its present Australian con-
text, basically either an economic or
technical issue. In my view it is basi-
cally a human problem. It is a simple
fact that a large segment of our wool-
growing industry has been convinced
by its leaders, or has convinced itself,
that nothing short of a major change
in marketing practices will safeguard
its prosperity. I am not maintaining
that this conviction is logical, or based
on fact, merely that it exists and that
any attempted solution which does not
take it into account is doomed to
failure.
We have only to look back over the
past five years to see that nothing short
of fairly drastic change will satisfy
those who seek what they call “market
reform” and that these people must be
satisfied, in some way, if the industry
is to have accord. These men are not
to be fobbed off with toothless com-
promise proposals or with unsubstan-
tiated claims that this or that system
will or will not work. These men want
change and will not rest until they
obtain it; they are, if you like, market-
ing fanatics.
Personally, I am not convinced that
any marketing system would necessarily
be better than the present one, and
by “better” I mean better for the
Australian economy as well as for the
wool industry. But I am convinced that
the marketing issue must be resolved
and it seems that this can be done
only through some fairly major com-
promise.
In seeking such a compromise we
must remember that when a wool-
grower calls for marketing reform he
is seldom really demanding a change
PROFESSOR R. F. HENDERSON
THERE was a serious risk that, what-
ever method was chosen, manipula-
tions of the wool market would do
more harm than good, Professor R. F.
Henderson, of Melbourne University,
told the seminar. In order successfully
to manipulate supply and price, one
would need to know quite a bit about
demand 5 years ahead, as well as a
lot about demand 1-2 years ahead. In
looking ahead at the cost and volume
of production of competing fibres, we
are in an area of great uncertainty.
Research and innovation by their very
nature are unpredictable. There can
be great leaps forward. There is no
certainty that change will be slow or
regular. Moreover, the changes in costs
and qualities of rival fibre products
may be accelerated by changes in tastes
of consumers.
A “realistic assumption” that syn-
thetic production should rise by about
ten percent a year would provide a
degree of uncertainty around any esti-
mate of demand for wool five years
ahead perhaps as much as plus or minus
15 percent.
“1 submit, therefore,” Professor Hen-
derson said, “that it is not possible to
forecast demand for wool with any
accuracy. The wide margins of error
that should be attached to the best
forecasts make it extremely hazardous
to attempt to manipulate the supply
and price of Australia’s wool clip. The
sort of mistake made recently in New
Zealand can easily happen. It can do
great damage to the market for wool
and encourage the substitution of other
materials. As the New Zealand experi-
ment in wool, and many others in other
commodity-manipulation schemes have
shown, human beings are terribly re-
luctant to admit their mistakes and cut
their losses. This means that the effect
of mistakes of optimism as to demand
and price is compounded.”


in the marketing system, he is merely
making known his need for a wider
profit margin. He has 'been “sold”
marketing change as a way of obtaining
this extra: profit, but it could well be
that in this aspect, at least, he has
been sold a pup. I wonder how many
of those actively advocating marketing
change would be willing to go on oath
today and guarantee higher wool prices,
or a significantly higher return to the
grower, under any particular marketing
system.
In the present situation there is no
way of knowing that any decision
reached by the wool industry will be
as the result of a sober factual assess-
ment. Both sides in any debate are
likely to be motivated by facts not
apparent on the surface—with brokers,
buyers, and wool textile manufacturers
being just as suspect as growers. I
suggest, therefore, that once wool-
growers have reached a decision on
the current Wool Board proposals that
they should be submitted to an exam-
ination by either an independent tri-
bunal or by a Select Committee of
the Commonwealth Parliament.
G. S. LeCOUTEUR
ONCE AGAIN Mr. G. S. LeCouteur
has emerged as a strong opponent of
the Australian Wool Board’s plans to
introduce some sort of marketing
scheme. In his paper to the seminar,
he said:
The crux of the wool-marketing pro-
posal now before the woolgrowers of
Australia is a supply - management
scheme. Under it, the control of supply
will be vested in an authority, the
membership of which will be deter-
mined by woolgrowers. The objective
would appear to be to control the
supply of wool to the market in an
endeavor to achieve two things: first,
a reduction in the range of price fluc-
tuations, and, secondly, a generally
higher price level in the open market.
Historically, the endeavors of pro-
ducers or growers to influence price
through supply control have been un-
successful, and schemes established
under pressure to give, at least some
appearance of supply control have
either collapsed or been converted into
controls by authority with price sup-
port, either by direct subsidy or by the
establishment of high home-consump-
tion prices. The progression of events
in New Zealand has shown clearly that
a reserve-price scheme does not have
the characteristics claimed for it in
1965 and that the reserve levels set did
not provide a floor below which prices
would not fall.
The history of the New Zealand
scheme is that in July, 1966, the
average of the reserve was raised by Id
per pound, or, in the currency now
applicable, to 30 cents New Zealand
per pound. In the year 1966-67, on the
basis of the reserve of 30 cents, 645,765
bales,, or 36.9 percent of the clip, was
acquired by the Commission. On July 1,
completely unexpectedly, the reserve
price was reduced to 25 cents. Up to 50
percent of catalogues was still acquired
by the Commission. On October 13,
without notice, the reserve was further
reduced to 16.25 cents per pound, a
provision being added that growers’
returns would be guaranteed by the
Government to an average of 25 cents.
The New Zealand scheme has, there-
fore, been converted from a reserve-
price scheme to a form of Government-
controlled price-guarantee provision,
and a stockpile of over 700,000 bales of
wool hangs over the crossbred market.
Undoubtedly the New Zealand
Wool Commission, within its charter,
has administered the scheme efficiently.
No one would doubt that the returns to
growers have been somewhat greater
than would have been the case had
the wool been sold on a free market.
The comment has been made that the
New Zealand scheme failed only be-
cause the reserve was fixed at the
wrong point, and this is, of course,
one of the fundamental questions
which must be considered in relation
to any system of supply-price manipu-
lation.
The success or otherwise of any
manipulative marketing technique
rests on the capacity of human beings
to assess the evidence available and
to predict probable price - demand
trends. Even with significant statistics
available to them, the New Zealand
Wool Commission would seem to have
made an error in increasing the reserve
price.
Can fluctuations in price be
effectively controlled on a short-term
basis (“short term” being defined as
“day to day”)? Five inter-related
aspects, posed as questions, have been
the subject of considerable research
and observation:
(a) Is it possible to equate prices
received to costs of production? Costs
of production are widely variable, and
it is not possible to determine with
accuracy what wool-production costs
may be in areas of diverse agricultural
and pastoral activity. From time to
time, and particularly since 1947,
some use has been made in Australia
of unit costs of production in deter-
mining levels of guaranteed prices,
but Australian policy-makers retreated
rapidly from the use of costs of pro-
duction as a criterion in price deter-
mination.
(b) Is it possible to assess demand
trends accurately from day to day?
This is most significant in determining
whether “supply management” is a
realistic proposition. Many and diverse
factors combine to determine a
demand trend, some of the factors
themselves being artificially engen-
dered, such as variations in exchange
rates or in export tariff ratings, as
have recently obtained in the United
Kingdom, Argentina, and Uruguay.
Political, fiscal, economic, social, and
psychological variables all influence
demand. The history of wool-price
variations is closely related to factors
outside the industry itself and in no
manner predictable with an accept-
able degree of accuracy. It is not
possible to establish an effective sys-
tem to give early warning of a demand
or price trend.
(c) Can stabilisation of wool prices
be achieved by manipulation of supply?
Supply control to influence price is
not within the bounds of possibility in
international commodity trading. Pro-
fessor K. O. Campbell says Australian
experience of commodity-stabilisation
schemes raises doubts whether advan-
tages outweigh their disadvantages in
disrupting the resource-allocating func-
tion of market prices and their ten-
dencies to inhibit economic growth. In
such economies, problems of economic
stability can usually be taken care of
more efficaciously through other fiscal
devices which have less adverse side-
effects on the rural industries. It needs
also to be recognised that in the real
world such schemes are particularly
vulnerable to political interference and
administrative ineptitude, and this tends
to reduce substantially any potential
usefulness they may have as techniques
of economic policy.
(d) What would be the result of
errors in judgment? This is best
answered by reference to the New
Zealand wool experience and to the
United States cotton scheme. Both
failed to maintain their objectives. In
the United States, the result was a
loss of aproximately 40 percent of the
export market for cotton and a non-
economic readjustment of resource
allocation. In New Zealand, markets
for the coarser wools have been lost.
(e) What would be the effect of such
stabilisation policies on the woolgrow-
ing industry? While some short-term
advantage may be gained by the mar-
ginal producer, no lasting benefit to
the whole is achieved. The risk of
substitution, inherent in such policies,
is immediate, and such supply-control
methods in the wool industry would
appear as speculative devices leaving
the future to cope with the conse-
quences. The cost of attempting to
stabilise price could prove to be the
loss of wool’s traditional markets.
From the growers’ point of view,
supply management is unlikely to
achieve higher prices, and fluctuations
are unlikely to be effectively controlled
in the proposed scheme, which in no
way tackles the major problems of
costs of production.
Supply management may be de-
scribed as an initially manipulative
system inevitably becoming speculative
when under pressure, unlikely to
achieve a price advantage for the
grower, in no way influencing the major
problem of cost Australia’s customers
view with such anxiety. An endeavor
to manipulate supply on human fore-
casts is a perilous undertaking and
almost inevitably leads to speculation
and an extension of autocratic controls.

Highlights of Western Mining
Corporation Limited’s 34th
Annual Meeting
HELD IN MELBOURNE
NOVEMBER 28, 1967
The Chairman, Mr. G. Lindesay Clark, ir his
report to shareholders stated:—
FINANCIAL
The net profit for the year ended June 30,
1967, which was slightly higher than the
previous financial period before making
provision for future income tax, included
a full year’s income from the Geraldton
District Iron Ore-Project. Surpluses from
the iron ore operation should increase in
some degree with increases in production
until the end of the present supply con-
tract in 1974, and should more than offset
the reduction in income from gold mining
dividends. In common with other gold
mining companies, the gold mines of the
Group were experiencing difficulties in
maintaining grade and holding costs. The
accounts did not include income from
Kambalda nickel, the first shipment not
being made until early in the current
financial year.
As WMC’s mineral sales abroad were con-
tracted in US dollars, the fact that Aus-
tralia did not devalue in line with the
recent devaluation of the pound sterling
was unlikely to affect the corporation
adversely.
FUTURE FINANCE
Negotiations with the W.A. Government on
a number of matters concerned with the
expansion of the nickel industry were well
advanced. These would be the subject of
a formal agreement between the Govern-
ment and WMC which would be subject to
later ratification by Parliament. Once a
decision on the extent of the future ex-
pansion was made, additional finance
would be needed. When this happened, it
was intended to obtain funds from a rights
issue to shareholders, from loans, and from
retained profits, by which means it was
expected to retain the equity in the hands
of WMC.
KAMBALDA NICKEL
WMC owned reserves, mineral claims and
mineral leases covering nickel deposits in
the Kambalda-St. Ives area south of Kal-
goorlie. It also had prospecting rights for
nickel in areas north of Kalgoorlie and in
the Yilgarn district.
Treatment of ore at Kambalda started in
June, 1967, and shipments of concentrates
to Canada and Japan had begun.
The first stage of the development of the
Kambalda deposits comprising the estab-
lishment of mining and milling operations
to produce concentrates at a rate equiva-
lent to 5,000 tons of contained nickel metal
per annum, would be completed by
January, 1968, when a regrind mill will be
installed and at the same time improve-
ments to the magnetic separation section
of the Kambalda concentrator should be
completed. These additions will improve
nickel recovery and bring the plant to full
capacity.
Several ore shoots had been located in the
initial exploratory drilling at Kambalda-St.
Ives. In recent months drilling had been
concentrated on three of these shoots with
the objective of providing assured reserves
as a firm base for future developments.
This objective had been attained and
drilling was now being directed to longer
term targets. Concurrently with exploration
and mine development, advice had been
sought on the best course to follow to-
wards the production of metallic nickel.
Conclusions had been reached on the type
of plant best suited to WMC’s conditions.
In view of the current world shortage of
nickel which was expected to last at least
until early 1970, WMC considered that every
effort should be made to produce nickel
metal and enter the market while the
shortage still existed.
A comprehensive statement on the various
aspects of the expansion programme would
be made as soon as the agreement with
the W.A. Government had been concluded.
Pending agreement with the government,
preparations were being made for sinking
a new shaft on the Durkin Shoot in the
Kambalda North area, and providing further
services, housing, etc. Prospecting on the
nickel reserves north of Kalgoorlie and in
Yilgarn district was continuing.
GOLD SUBSIDY
An approach had been made by the Gold
Mining Industry to the Federal Government
for an increase in the maximum subsidy
rate beyond the present $8 per ounce, and
for other liberalising measures. The Govern-
ment decided not to consider an increase
for at least 12 months, but it did agree in
principle to consider accelerated deprecia-
tion of any new capital introduced into
gold mines for the purpose of improving
operating efficiencies and also to exclude
the income from, and costs of, by-products-
from gold mining operations for the pur-
poses of calculating gold subsidy.
CENTRAL NORSEMAN GOLD
CORPORATION N.L.
The rate of ore treatment at Central Norse-
man remained at approximately the pre-
vious year's level but the recovered grade
fell by 0.75 dwt per ton and the average
cost (including development redemption)
increased by $1.15 per ton. Ore reserves
decreased from 634,000 tons averaging 10.5
dwts per ton to 529,000 tons averaging 10.0
dwts per ton. The grade was tending to fall
and it was likely that the Company would
become eligible for gold subsidy in the
current year.
A fully owned subsidiary, Leonora Gold
Development Pty. Ltd., was continuing with
gold exploration in the Leonora-Laverton
area.
GOLD MINES OF KALGOORLIE
(AUST.) LIMITED
Ore treatment was approximately the same
as last year although a slightly higher pro-
portion of ore came from the Mt. Charlotte
lease. Operating costs at both Fimiston
and Mt. Charlotte were approximately the
same as last year, but the recovered grade
decreased by an average of 0.48 dwt per
ton mainly due to a fall in grade of Fim-
iston ore.
Ore reserves increased from 5,554,000 tons
averaging 3.8 dwts per ton to 6,038,500 tons
averaging 3.7 dwts per ton.
The company continued to qualify for gold
subsidy at the maximum rate of $8 per
ounce.
Drilling for a repetition in depth of the
Western Lode System was continuing.
IRON ORE
The production requirement-of the first full
year of the Geraldton District Project was
met in terms of tonnage and grade. WMC
had a 50% share in this project which was
mining and shipping iron ore to Japan, and
a share in the iron ore deposits of the
Yilgarn area in W.A.
ALCOA OF AUSTRALIA
Alcoa of Australia Proprietary Limited con-
tinued to make excellent progress and was
now operating profitably.
Two additional expansion programmes at
the Kwinana Alumina Refinery in W.A.
operated by its subsidiary, Western
Aluminium N.L., were announced and on
completion would add significantly to its
profitability. The capacity of the refinery
would be increased to 620,000 metric tons
by the third quarter of 1968 and to 830,000
metric tons in the second half of 1969. Re-
serves of bauxite in the Darling Ranges
were 500 million tons. The whole of the
alumina output for the expanded plant
over and above 80,000 tons required for the
Point Henry smelter was already sold under
long term commercial contracts to Alumi-
num Company of America, Mitsubishi
Chemical Industries Limited, Japan, and
American Metal Climax Inc., U.S.A.
OTHER MINERALS
WMC was investigating a number of mineral
occurrences of interest either on its own
behalf or in conjunction with other mining
companies in Western Australia and South
Australia. This included copper exploration
in the Warburton Ranges, W.A., at Moonta
in S.A. in a joint venture, and elsewhere.
General base metal prospecting work was
being carried out in Kalgoorlie, the Yilgarn
district of W.A. and as a partner in the
Fraser Range Project managed by New-
mont Proprietary Limited exploring east of
Norseman, W.A.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion the Chairman stressed the
importance of providing facilities in mining
areas to attract people to live in these
remote districts including better housing
facilities and provision of entertainment
in a way comparable to coastal towns.
The provision of these facilities fell on the
companies but there were others usually
accepted as the responsibility of the State
and Federal Governments such as schools,
hospitals, communications and transport
facilities, television, etc. The great increases
in Government revenues arising from
mineral production would amply pay for
high standard facilities in the mining areas.
When deciding these matters Governments
should, in addition to size of population,
take into account the harsher conditions
in the mining towns and the contribution
of an expanding mining industry to the
economy.

The high quality
of Staniforth
Ricketson
BY J. C. HORSFALL
AUSTRALIAN FINANCE FIRMS
have housed a host of wicked uncles
over the years but Staniforth Ricketson,
who died last week, wasn’t one of
them. A more upstanding and reputable
financier couldn’t be imagined. When
the news came through I was reading
the W. S. Robinson memoirs. Like
Robinson, SR was a giant of a man
in all the best Australian sense of the
word. He strode the pavements of
Collins Street as a colossus and if not
outwardly as genially as some giants,
behind the mask was a generous twinkle
in his eye.
His likeness with WS doesn’t match
at all points, of course. For one thing
Robinson’s financial acumen flourished
in international negotiation in the in-
terests of his country; his companies
and perhaps his fame sprang more from
that than from his great achievements
in Australian domestic industrial financ-
ing. With Ricketson the bias was
heavily toward the latter, though he
was no babe in the international woods,
either. His success as a foreign ex-
change broker in the “black” markets
for the Australian pound in the pre-
-1931 devaluation days, and in the arbi-
trage field over most of the 56 years
(25 as senior partner) he was with
J. B. Were and Son, bear full witness
to that.
As a Melbourne and national finan-
cial luminary it has to be admitted
that he was eclipsed in his latter years
by Sir lan Potter operating from the
other side of Collins Street, but there
was nobody who sang Potter’s praises
louder that he, as he did to me on
several occasions. Even so, he held the
spotlight for many years before Sir lan
arrived and later thrived on the opposi-
tion, throwing all his financial power,
along with his unlimited energies and
acumen, into their many takeover
clashes and the underwriting competi-
tion in which they were (until A.C.
Goode arrived on the scene fresh from
the Ricketson stable) the top rivals.
In lives in which financial achieve-
ments are written so large it is probably
only incidental that both Robinson and
Ricketson were journalists early, in their
careers. But apparently Robinson, a
finance editor of the “Age” as a young
man, got most of the writing urges out
of his system at the “Age,” whereas
Ricketson, whose only spell on a news-
paper was a brief one in Tasmania (he
was born in N.S.W.), didn’t. They
stayed with him all his life and indeed
the urge colored much of his
subsequent activity. He will go down as
having written more long (almost in-
variably, but usually all worthy of close
attention) chairman’s speeches and
letters of advice to clients than any
fellow Australian. He always had com-
petent, sometimes brilliant journalists
at his elbow to draft and advise on
his compositions (several have been
elevated to partnerships in J. B. Were
and Son), he had a receptive ear for
the writings of financial journalists, he
respected them (even inviting them to
the House of Were for lunch), and was
never averse to giving the same counter-
service when he thought it appropriate.
Probably no leader in our financial
history is so well documented. As I
have had occasion to peruse his writings
over a long period, I here attest to the
wealth of wisdom in them. I’ve recently
been going through the speeches he
made at the Capel Court companies
(he was chairman of them all) in 1960,
in which step by step he plots the
progress of the financial rakes of the
time as well as with remai'kable fore-
sight telling the financial authorities

what they should have been doing to
arrest them. Above all, the Press and
the public will remember Mr. Ricket-
son for the high quality of his advice.
Next to that, perhaps, it will be for
his unbounded faith in the economic
future of this country, where his fore-
bears settled a mere year or two after
Batman declared Melbourne a place for
a village, and Jonathan B. Were, his
great grandfather, was musing whether
to come out there and get into the
financial business.
Ricketson, like Robinson, was more
a grey eminence, guiding and often
dictating events from behind the scenes,
than a front man. He seldom appeared
on public platforms. This was not
simply because he suffered from deaf-
ness as a result of the fighting at Gal-
lipoli and other Word War I battle-
fields, where he got the DSM and
other decorations. Just how deaf he
was is a moot point, because he had
an uncanny knack of catching what he
wanted to hear and was an expert in
the art of switching off his aid. It
was more that he was actually shy,
especially of the public spotlight, even
if not of publicity for Were’s through
his Capel Court company speeches and,
earlier, disemination of clients’ circu-
lars to the Press (this got him into hot
water with the committee of the Stock
Exchange as long ago as 1923, when
the weekly effusions were first intro-
duced, and the advertising issues had
not yet been settled, at least not to
the general satisfaction of Melbourne
brokers).'
I seem to remember Mr. Ricketson
getting slightly involved in the Nation-
alist rallies of the 1930 depression days
and, of course, he was chairman of the
old “Argus” newspaper in Melbourne
for some time. This gave him another
platform for a while, but it was more
in the post-1946 period when his in-
fluence on affairs really came to be
felt and governments listened. The
classic case of this is, of course, his
success, after persistently bashing the
ear of Federal Ministers, in getting the
Reserve Bank hived off from the Com-
monwealth Bank. One of J.B. Were’s
partners told me once that without
Ricketson the necessary legislation
would never have got to the Bill stage.
He would take up a cause and hammer
it, not always to a successful conclusion.
For example, his campaign to get the
Government to legislate for more
equity ownership for Australians is still
hanging fire; so is his advocacy for the
return of the convertible note for tax
exemption.
If his general public image is rather
blurred because of his deep reticence
and aloofness (how deep we will never
know), not so his image in the financial
world. The financial complex developed
around the stockbroking firm is only
rivalled in Melbourne by those of Pot-
ter and A. C. Goode. With its more
numerous built-in outlets for sub-
underwriting, Weres’ has unique fea-
tures. If Weres’ is not as strong com-
paratively on the underwriting side at
the time of his death as in Ricketson’s
heyday, it is still near the top of the
underwriting league, as is seen by the
recent Myer debenture issue. It also
gets a good slice of the business going
to the short-term money market
through the offshoot he created.
Things will never be quite the same
along Collins Street without the power-
ful figure of Ricketson presiding at
Capel Court. He was a front runner
in the drive to thicken the financial
arena with sophisticated machinery,
There was no better competitor to
battle against the headwinds which
often blew up—from the direction of
the Reserve Bank more than anywhere
else. He lived to see the financial mar-
kets and their machinery take shapes
which he never could have dreamed
they could when he first joined Were
and Son in 1911, shapes that now
match the most streamlined of the big
financial centres on the other side of
the world.

The many merits,
and demerits,
of unit trusts
THE CONCEPT OF A unit trust
should be the answer to every amateur
investor’s dream. Here is a cheap way
by which he can relieve himself of the
daily stress and strain of keeping his
eye on his investments and have his
funds managed by a group of profes-
sional men with university degrees,
contacts, massive research libraries,
cunning, know-how, and experience.
Now if these people can’t help a fellow,
who can? But have these professionals
really made dreams come true for unit
trust holders? To be fair, they have
sometimes done very well. To be com-
plete they have sometimes also done
amazingly badly. Now how can this be?
It is hard to say, but there are some
possible explanations.
First is diversification. Trusts have a
seemingly obsessional desire for a wide
spread of investments. The idea is that,
with your eggs spread in a series of
baskets all over the place, if one goes
bad the rest need not necessarily fol-
low. This stops your portfolio from
rapidly decreasing in value. Unfortun-
ately it also stops it going up very fast.
Actually, judging from the success of
the few undiversified funds that have
been floated (the natural resources
funds for instance), it is a wonder that
there have not been more moves to-
ward specialisation.
Another possible reason for the trusts’
failures is the natural desire of the
managers to fill their portfolios with
well-known, widely discussed, and cur-
rently popular stocks. Unfortunately
because of these very reasons, the prices
of these stocks are generally well up
at the time of purchase. Perhaps if
some of the lesser-known stocks only
just starting on their way up the success
ladder were purchased, the perform-
ance of unit trusts might be a happier
one. Now the reasons for failure men-
tioned so far are both readily forgiv-
able and understandable (and in fact
the thinking involved is not without
validity or merit). However there are
other reasons which are not so readily
forgivable. One of these is the practice
by unit trust managers of loading up
portfolios with shares underwritten by
their own company. Another is that
nasty practice of trust managers selling
shares from one trust to another trust
within the group because no one else
outside really wants them.
So much for the unit trust port-
folios. Now for mine. This week I
bought only one stock: Yarra Falls.
This company is making a comeback
that is punchy but definitely not punch-
drunk. Since 1964 it has had a rough
time including a liquidity problem
and a loss. The situation is now much
brighter. It looks as though the com-
pany’s two years of reorganisation and
modernisation are now starting to pay
dividends. External liabilities which
were $7.8 million in 1965 are now $3.8
million and profits are also better. In
the year to June, 1967, earnings rose
from a dismal $31,000 to $282,000. The
dividend, which has been skipped for
three years, was reinstated at four per-
cent. The bullish point about the busi-
ness is that most of the profits were
earned in the second six months. This
augurs well for this year.
So does the latest chairman’s report.
This states that both sales and profits
for the first quarter of the year are well
up on last year’s. Then it goes on to
mention that the company has now
leased two-thirds of its main building
at Dandenong and has been earning
income from it since November 10.
This makes a nice change from the ex-
penses the building has been incurring
since 1964, when it ceased production
operations. Selling at $l.lO and yield-
ing 7.3 the shares look a good prospect,
especially when there is a strong chance
of a dividend increase later on in the
year. I bought 200.
A company that looks a bit neglec-
ted and a good buy for the term in-
vestor is Raynors Holdings. This com-
pany styles itself as “Jewellers to In-
dustry;” It specialises, amongst other
things, in metal stamping, die casting,
engraving, and electroplating for the
domestice appliance, automotive, and
engineering industries. Its latest profit
was a record $184,420. In addition its
dividend was raised from 11 percent
(which had been paid for the past three
years) to 12 percent. In spite of all this
its price is still nearer its low for the
year than its high and is well below the
price levels of previous years, when the
company was earning less and paying
less.

Shares for a Christmas stocking
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
SAY HAPPY CHRISTMAS with a
nice bundle of shares (well, contract
notes; it’s a bit too late to organise
the share certificates). That is the
message from the bourse this month.
Last year lan Potter and Co. put out
a cheerful-looking Christmas list that
ended up doing fairly well; this year
Corrie & Co. is encouraging clients
to see their stocks rise (with their
friends and relations, that is) by giv-
ing shares. But what to give?. The
mining market has that look of vulner-
ability about it right now; the indus-
trials market could well face a bit
of a slip in coming months as liquidity
tightens, drought in the south has its
impact, and companies prepare to drag
millions of dollars out of the market
in new share and debenture issues in
1968, many of which have already
been foreshadowed.
There is no way of insulating your-
self against risk in this kind of market,
except by making sure you buy the
right stocks, not only because they are
good but also because now is the right
time to buy them. But there are also
some stocks that you cannot afford not
to buy even though the timing may not
be perfect. So that is why the top four
of the stocks that I would buy
for Christmas presents would be BHP,
RTZ, WMC, and either AAO or Wood-
side.
These four basic material stocks are
going to wobble around a fair bit this
year. But let them. You just cannot
afford to be out of any of them (al-
though .BHP’s forecast new share and
debenture issues may provide a reason-
able opportunity to get into this stock
later on in 1968 if liquidity is a bit
tight when BHP does approach the
market). I’ve been plugging BHP for
the past two years in this page, and I
reckon there is plenty more in them
yet. And not just on oil; the market
has not really got the message about
BHP’s iron-ore-export potential. I
*ink the big-call-option operator who
h as ’ an 'd needs BHP to rise to $2O oi so,
will make his money within the next
six months.
WMC is the only nickel stock that
can be taken seriously; the rest simply
flutter around the candle the way all
those uranium stocks did to Mary Kath-
leen in the late ’fifties. RTZ is the
cheapest way of buying into the very
impressive CRA-Hamersley opera-
tion, but getting a lot of interesting
additional activities, like Canadian
uranium. Britain’s devaluation has not
really affected RTZ, although the higher
corporation tax will.
In oil, Woodside and AAO provide
a useful alternative, as they are both
gas-oriented at present but with oil as
an important feature as well. Wood-
side’s stake in Ashmore Reef and its
neighborly role with BHP in Gippsland
make it a very interesting stock, while
AAO’s attractions are on-shore oil and
gas and the chance of good profits from
coal. But in a list of only 12 stocks it
would be wrong to have both these;
on-shore men should stick to AAO;
mariners should go for Woodside,
although current interest in Ashmore
has put the price up.
I’ve put in some alternatives, not
because I cannot make up my mind
between them but because they pro-
vide similar opportunities in different
fields of activity so that those who dis-
like one may get into the other. For
example, the next stock on the Christ-
mas shopping list is either Containers
or Woolworths. All right, so Wool-
worths has been as dull as a stock can
be for the past year, and Containers has
already had a big rise, from which it
has reacted a little. The thing about
these two is that they are both sound
companies that have been expanding
into new areas.
The next set of alternatives is
Ampol Petroleum or Mt. Isa Mines.
Both have had their problems with new
developments (Ampol with teething
troubles at its new refinery; Mt. Isa
with ore at the foot of its new K 57
shaft), but both should do a lot better
in the future, and both have the added
advantages of being likely to come up
with something extra.
The choice of Wynyard Holdings or
Steamships Trading is not simply that
both yield well over 8 percent on divi-
dends, or even that they have a special
disadvantage in the market at present
(Steamships has had too many new
share issues for the market to absorb
recently; Wynyard has the threat of
share disposals from its major share-
holder hanging over the market). Both
have special problems: Wynyard has
the new W ent worth up against it and
Steamships has a run of poor com-
modity prices. But both seem to be
handling their problems pretty well;
both seem to be worth about 50 per-
cent more than their current price.
The market does not like William
Adams much at the moment, but I
The Chartist says:
NAUC is an interesting technical situation which could justify investors’
attention at present. The past history on the chart since 1962 shows some dramatic
price movements and an 80 percent uptrend continued until September, 1966,
when a sharp decline took prices to 26c following the Cleveland issue. Since
then, the stock has formed a consolidation pattern and established a 70 percent
uptrend. The recent rise to 58c on very high-volume took place at a time when
there was a general “bearish” tone in the market, indicating above-average technical
strength. Targets of close to 70c, 90c, and $1.40 are indicated, where the situation
would call for reassessment. Last sale price on 8/12/67 —56 c.


think the market is wrong. Last week’s
report of an 8.7 percent profit fall in
the half year to October is not as bad
as it looks. It looks as if the Cater-
pillar tractor agencies are still the slug
on profits they were last year, and they
will probably remain so while the
drought hits southern Australia. But
steel and aluminium seem to be do-
ing pretty well and directors say that
group results for the year will be com-
parable with last year’s 15.8 percent
earning rate and that the 12£ percent
dividend will be maintained (giving a
reasonable 6 percent yield at current
prices). William Adams’ future looks
very bright, particularly in its alum-
inium operations where it is an Alcoa
distributor.
Readers of this page are probably
sick. and tired of hearing about Elec-
tronic Industries and Universal Tex-
tiles, especially since both have been
falling in price recently. But both
■these should hit the dollar mark in
1968, because the market’s current
nervousness will most likely be proved
wrong in both cases. Universal Textiles
(the old STP-Tennyson companies)
suffered a 15 percent profit fall in their
first year, their managing director died,
and one of their big individual share-
holders in Britain has been selling his
shares on an already dull market for
financial reasons. But the run of bad
luck looks to have ended.
Electronic’s recent reaction back to
75 cents after moving as high as 95
from the 1965 low of 36 cents seems
to have been simply a technical one.
The company is understood to be do-
ing well, with defence and other gov-
ernment orders providing plenty of
work and with higher profits despite
the continuation of competitive con-
ditions in the appliance field.
Unless something unexpected hap-
pens, shares in the L. J. Hooker In-
vestment Corporation should rise by at
least 50 percent in 1968 as the pastoral
properties begin to pull their weight.
It should be in the stocking.

SON’S passing, markets were as “Ham-

he was a pillar of strength—providing

the highest standards of integrity and
scrupulousness would prevail or else he
would know the reason why. Not all
brokers adhered strictly to his rigid rule
that members shouldn’t play the double
role of principal and agent, but it would
greatly improve the exchange’s public
image if they did. For members of his
own firm he laid down the restrictive

shares on their own account.
Ricketson set equally high and rigid
rules for his clients. As he once wrote
outlining them: “We offer no criticism
of market operations as such, but we
wish to impress on our clients that, as
an investment house, we have elected
to give preference where it can be
justly given to those clients who are
investors of the type who will be
governed by the inherent investment
merits of a stock rather than by its
market possibilities of giving a quick
profit. The exercise of this preference
can never be applied in the execution
of orders accepted for operating in the
market, but it is applied in the alloca-
tion of shares in new issues and in the
placing of large parcels of shares below
the market.”
But that was not all. His rules pretty
well ruled out the speculator. The main
ones were that no client would be
financed for the purchase of shares;
orders for forward buying or for selling
in advance of buying (that is “over-
selling”) would not be accepted; orders
in mining stocks would not usually be
accepted from new clients unless sales
were being made for reinvestment in
industrial stocks —such orders never be-
ing originated by the firm for estab-
lished clients.
If Ricketson was more a specialist on
one side of stockbroking than another
it was in the bond market, appropri-
ately enough for a man who was so
solidly gilt-edged. For many years,
not so long back either, the bond mar-
ket was effectually a J. B. Were &
Son province.
As an underwriter, Ricketson was one
of the most exacting task-masters in
the land to companies seeking the pat-
ronage of Weres for their issues. If
this doesn’t necessarily explain why
Potters and Goodes have been grab-
bing much bigger slices of the business
in more recent times, Ricketson would
always admit he wasn’t infallible in
this field, though the one big black
mark on his record in it was wholly
(or anyway nearly) pardonable when
in 1951 the Government raised bond
rate in the course of a semi-government
issue his firm had underwritten and
left it holding most (actually 55.78 per-
cent) of the baby. To his dying day
he never forgave the monetary auth-
orities for it and for many years re-
fused to underwrite semi-government
loans at all.
Ricketson’s unique achievement in
the Melbourne financial world was not
so much that he fathered the bond
market for so many years nor that
he led the way in underwriting there
for so long. It was rather that he
created the first of our big financial
complexes and established a pattern
for the creation of others such as
Potter’s and Goode’s. Whether he fore-
saw that the formation of Australian
Foundation Investment, an investment
trust, in 1928 would lead on to all it
did to make Melbourne such a sophisti-
cated financial city is a moot point.
Probably not, but he was the true pro-
genitor of the advancement. Maybe
others have been able to improve on
his set-up and some have certainly de-
veloped differently, yet, if their struc-
tures are rather different, the one
Ricketson built up clicks like well-oiled
machinery the investment and
underwriting companies, the CFN
group of unit trusts and funds, which
cater for all investment tastes, and
the short-term money market opera-
tions (officially and otherwise) form-
ing perfect complements to the stock-
broking activities.
Wars and depressions came and went,
but, with singleness of purpose, Mr.
Ricketson for nearly four decades de-
voted himself to the business of keep-
ing Were’s head high in the Melbourne
market and wider afield, where in his
time it established offices in London
and many Australian capitals. His de-
votion was equalled by this great pride
and faith in the business which was one
of the first finance firms to be estab-
lished in Melbourne, actually by his
great-grandfather in 1839.
Behind the balance sheets
Allied Mills ripe to consolidate
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING has
doubled out at Allied Mills in the
last five years except the earning
rate and the share price. The sort
of growth that has brought the doub-
ling of profits, capital, equipment,
stocks, and a huge rise in debtors has
left the earning rate exactly where it
was in 1963. And the share price is
now at its lowest since the bad old days
of 1962, suggesting that shareholders
do not rate their chances highly of
getting any real benefits (in terms
of higher dividends or earning rates)
from the close to $l5 million capital
expenditure during the last five years.
But the dull look about Allied Mills
is partly the political consequence of
being the biggest in an industry sub-
ject to government price control, in
another under quota control, and
another where there has just been a
burst of takeover activity.-In its bread
operation Allied has to cry poor, par-
ticularly following the recent wheat
price rise (followed by a flour price
increase), in order to get a lift in the
controlled price of bread. This should
come sooner or later and will be of
some help to the bakery business, which
is not a real money spinner anyway
but does provide guaranteed outlets
for much of Allied’s flour.
In margarine, it has certainly not
been the front runner in any of the
drastic developments in the industry
in recent times; its possession of the
majority of the quotas has meant that
it had a vested interest in behaving with
decorum. Its stake in the broiler
business (about which its directors are
not prepared to stick their necks out
in public) is believed to be very large
indeed, but this is only to provide an
outlet for its stock foods.
So the major part of Allied’s ex-
pansion in recent times does appear
to have been aimed at providing new
vehicles for increasing the sales of
its basic products, even if these vehicles
themselves were not highly profitable.
This strategy certainly makes the com-
pany look safer and stronger, but it
also reduces its scope for spectacular
advances in its earning rate. It may
therefore be unwise to hope for great
things from this company while this
strategy is being maintained, just as
it would be unreal to fear a disaster.
An extraordinary appetite for equity
capital attracted many admirers to
Allied Mills Ltd. in the “growth” days
of the early ’sixties, but their enthusiasm
has waned in the last two years. The
latest result of $1,882,773 (before
writing off $30,000 from quoted shares)
represents 25.0 percent on capital,
around 1963 levels, but somewhat
lower than in the intervening years.
If the company get a bread price rise
fairly soon, it should be able to do
better than this in the current year.
In Victoria, where there is no govern-
ment control of bread prices, the
decision being made by the Bread
Manufacturers of Victoria, a bread
price rise is imminent. Under the
Prices Regulation Act of N.S.W., bread
has a gazetted maximum price. As
soon as the wholesale price of flour
rose at the beginning of this month,
the Bread Manufacturers’ Association
of N.S.W. announced its intention of
lodging an early application for an
increase.
The wholesale wheat price rise of
5.7 percent was the biggest increase for
several years. Under our wheat legis-
lation, a new price is fixed annually
in accordance with increases in wages,
rates, fertilisers, and so on. The price
for flour went up concurrently, 5 per-
cent higher in N.S.W., 4 percent in
Victoria. Although there was a 5 per-
cent bread rise in July, 1967, another
rise of nearly equal proportion seems
almost certain. The extent of the time
lag influences Allied Mills’ immediate
share market attractions.
The company has had a remarkable
performance in post-war years, chang-
ing its direction and broadening its
base to accommodate itself to radically
changed circumstances. From being
primarily a flour miller, with the largest
export business in N.S.W., the com-
pany, with the loss of export markets
as the former importers established


their own mills, has become a diver-
sified and vertically integrated group
with milling activities representing
probably less than one-quarter of group
business. In the early post-war years,
purchase of a two-thirds interest in
Vegetable Oils Pty. Ltd., margarine,
cooking fats, and edible oils, provided
a good flow of earnings, while invest-
ment in bakeries was undertaken. The
bakeries gave a* poor return on funds
employed, which is only now regarded
as satisfactory, but at least secured
markets foi* the flour. Meanwhile, the
early interest in stockfeeds, absorbing
the mills’ by-products, was strengthened
into a major link in the chain, with
the rapid growth of the broiler in-
dustry.
Judging by the minority interest in
net profits shown in Allied Mills’
accounts (which apart from dividends
on John Darling preference shares is
believed to represent Gillespie Bros.
Holdings’ interest in Vegetable Oils),
Allied Mills’ earnings from margarine
and edible oils are again today about
as large as in 1963, after some fall-off
in between. But in 1963 margarine and
oils earned about half of group profits,
while today it represents less than 30
percent. As the holder of the largest
production quotas for table margarine,
Allied Mills sat tight during this year’s
campaign by Marrickville Holdings to
have the quota system removed or its
quotas increased. It is now history that
Marrickville circumvented this legal
ruling by promoting so-called cooking
margarines suitable for the table. Allied
Mills may be deliberately soft-pedalling,
for it has not pushed its own spreadable
cooking margarines as much as have
Marrickville and the rest. It therefore
is just holding its own with margarine
earnings, whereas the others have pur-
sued the consumer interest in mar-
garine. In 1966-67 Australian table
margarine production fell 9 percent,
because of enforcement of quotas, while
“other margarine” rose 12 percent. In
the September quarter of 1968 table
margarine production fell 38 percent,
while “other margarine,” on which
there must be a nice profit margin, rose
18 percent.
One of the most active areas of
trading is in stockfeed. Demand in
Allied Mills’ last year to August con-
tinued to increase, and since balance
date new plant capacity was installed
at Rhodes, although competition is keen
and in some sections “very severe.” Cost
increases have been passed on in higher
selling prices.
An intriguing drama was enacted
during the year when British Tobacco
made an offer for the ailing Golden
Poultry broiler group. This was fol-
lowed by a joint bid by Allied Mills
and British Tobacco. In the event the
bird went to Inghams, the private
poultry producer and processor in
N.S.W. Inghams is a large customer for
Allied Mills feeds and, now enlarged
by the Golden Poultry takeover, is an
even more valued client. (As far as is
known though, the Golden Poultry feed
account is still with the Victorian op-
position, Robert Hutchinson.) It is
believed, but never officially acknow-
ledged, that Allied Mills is a large
financial supporter of Inghams. The
company declines to comment on the
very significant rise in the past two
years in shares and loans in non-listed
companies, lumped together as $4.3m.,
in its 1967 accounts. Remembering that
in 1965 there were non-listed shares
and notes of sl.Bm. (mainly the John
Darling interest in Austral Bakeries
Pty. Ltd), it looks as if Allied Mills
may have loaned as much as $2.5m. to
Inghams.
The terms of repayment and the
interest earned are not divulged. Share-
holders and the investing public may
feel entitled to some comment or ex-
planation of such a large asset. And
it is remarkable that directors felt
under no obligation to tell the owners
of their company what the s3m. (almost
40 percent) rise in debtors to sllm.
was all about in the latest year. This
probably has something to do with the
broiler business, too.
The company declines to give sales
figures, but it is most improbable that
turnover rose anything like 38 percent,
particularly as stocks fell by about eight
percent to $5.2m. Some of Allied Mills’
business is done on seven days terms,
some on 90 days.
The business of starch, gluten, and
glucose, in which Allied Mills had been
interested since 1950, when Andrew
Baker, of Sydney, was acquired, was
reinforced by the acquisition in Mel-
bourne of Maize Products in Septem-
ber, 1965. Severe competition has
existed in this area for some years and
the position is no better today. Maize
Products needed reorganising. Mean-
while, Allied Mills hopes for establish-
ment of the industry on a more satis-
factory basis to enable the company to
show a reasonable return on funds in-
vested.
The bakeries still find competition
stiff, but “under the circumstances”
results in 1966-67 were satisfactory. The
John Darling acquisition in 1962 ex-
tended operations into Victoria, through
the 49 percent interest in a subsidiary
of the listed Melbourne company,
Austral Bakeries Holdings, which
materially assists the company in main-
taining regular running time for its
Sunshine (Vic.) mill. Much of Allied
Mills’ enormous capital expenditure in
the 1960 s was on bakeries, for which
the return was very modest. In N.S.W.
its Buttercup bread is a market leader
in the Sydney metropolitan, Wollon-
gong, and Central Coast areas. Sydney
Flour Pty. Ltd. was acquired in 1964-
65, adding Sydney, Federation and
Betty Sydney brands of domestic
packaged flour, cake mixes, and con-
veniences to the product range. A new
plant was established at Smithfield,
which was extremely costly, both for
building and plant, but allowed de-
velopment of new products. There is
a growing demand for convenience
foods, which Allied Mills is well placed
to supply. Further diversification has
been made into macaroni production
and olive growing.
Capital expenditure in the last five
years absorbed sl4fm., but the 1967
expenditure of $2.3m. is a reduction
from the 1965 peak of $3.6m., and
the commitments unprovided for at
1967 balance date were $470,000 (1964
peak of $1.6m.), implying a distinct re-
duction in capital requirements. The
chairman (Sir John Cadwallader)
said a new bakery at North Ryde, to
be built this financial year replacing
three old-style bakeries, substantially
completes the program of plant re-
organisation begun some years ago.
Allied Mills has financed its growth
by frequent issues and large borrowings.
There were three one-for-four par issues
in 1959, one in September, 1960, and
the last in October, 1964, and a one-
for-five issue at 25c premium in July,
1966. A couple of placements, of
641,292 50c shares at $1.55 in July,
1965, and of 500,000 shares at $1.50 in
April, 1967, filled intermediate require-
ments. The company reduced share-
holders’ equity by borrowing s2m. in
a private debenture issue at seven per-
cent in 1964, s2m. in a public issue at
7f percent in 1966, and a s2m. private
placement at percent in October,
1967. Long-term liabilities now repre-
sent almost one-third of total funds em-
ployed. The interest bill in 1967 rose
from $643,136 to $768,711, debenture
loans then being $7.55m. and unsecured
notes sl.9m.
The pleasing feature of the 1967 re-
sult is that the 12 percent increase in
profits was effected in the second half.
The first half result showed no improve-
ment on the prior year, but the six
months to August showed 23 percent
improvement. Should this rate of
activity continue for this full year, earn-
ing rate could very well recover the
ground lost in 1966-67. This current
year, with lesser demands for funds for
capital expansion, should prove a
period of consolidation. A comment on
current trading from the chairman in
his annual address would have been
useful; shareholders will have to wait
until the end of April for the interim
report. But at least shareholders know
he does not expect devaluation to have
an adverse effect on the company
(although in the future it might make
some products more difficult to sell
abroad) and that wheat supplies are
adequate despite the poor seasonal con-
ditions and drought on some areas, par-
ticularly Victoria.

Security analysis
Boral has refinery problems
THERE HAS BEEN considerable
speculation about the prospects of
Esso/BHP, or rather BHP itself, be-
coming a marketer of petroleum pro-
ducts as well as a 50 percent owner of
crude. This speculation has centred
on the possibility of the acquisition
by BHP of Ampol, but this, judging by
a statement made by the Ampol board
a little while ago, has proved to be
unfounded. So far as I know, no specu-
lation has taken place regarding the
possibility of BHP acquiring Boral
Ltd. While I doubt whether BHP at
this particular stage has given much
consideration to the idea of entering
into the refining and marketing of its
crude oil, and therefore I do not con-
sider that there is even a remote pros-
pect of such a takeover, it is, perhaps,
an idea to have a look at Boral to see
whether at current prices the shares
could be a worthwhile investment in
their own right.
Boral was incorporated in Sydney in
March, 1946, to commence the refining
of synthetic crude oil to produce bitu-
men, and at that time Caltex took up
40 percent of the issued capital. This
holding has since been reduced quite
significantly, mainly as a result of fur-
ther issues of shares by Boral to acquire
the companies in which Caltex did not
participate. It is now only of historical
interest to trace the various acquisitions
that Boral has made since about 1960
and for the purpose of the present exer-
cise it will be sufficient to study the
group as it stands today.
Boral’s refinery is situated at Matra-
ville, in Sydney, and has the capacity
to process about 20,000 barrels per day.
During the past six months a significant
addition has been made to this refinery
by the installation of an Isomax hydro
cracker. Originally the cost was to have
been about $6.5 million, but it is likely
that this figure has been exceeded quite
substantially. When the Isomax unit is
in full operation it is considered that
it will save about 16 percent of crude
inputs and will produce 16 percent
more light petroleum products as a
result. The Isomax unit will replace
the present catalytic cracker and will
also produce a number of specialised
products, such as waxes, transformer
oils, and other specialised oils.
It seems fairly certain from the
chairman’s address that the installation
of this unit has resulted in a very
significant reduction in throughput of
the refinery and the unit only came on
stream about mid-October. This will
mean that in the first half of the 1967/8
year the group profit is likely to be
down on that of the corresponding
period of 1966/7. The ultimate effect
on the full profits for the 1967/8 year
is unknown at this stage, but with the
new unit working satisfactorily one can
expect a significant improvement in the
profits of the refinery operation in the
second half of the year.
Boral has already decided to enter
the retail marketing of petrol and
has acquired a small number of service
stations which it is currently in the
course of increasing. The bulk of Boral’s
production is sold to Caltex under an
agreement which will expire in 1975
and, although this is still nearly eight
years away, it seems likely that Boral
is considering the prospects of market-
ing all the products of its refinery in
due course.
Boral also has a controlling interest
(about 55.6 percent) in Petrochemical
Holdings, which operates a high tem-
perature cracking plant at Silverwater
to treat the residual oils drawn from
Boral’s refinery. This plant produces
gas, tars, pitch, solvents, and chemicals,
and the gas is supplied to the Austra-
lian Gas Light Company under a long-
term contract. Petrochemical Holdings,
through its subsidiary, Commercial
Solvents Pty. Ltd., operates a Udex
plant at Matraville for the extraction of
solvents and the separation of benzine,
toluene, and xylene. Petrochemical
Holdings’ profits increased very sub-
stantially in 1965/6, but declined again
in 1966/7. The main reason for the
reduced profit was given as the loss of
excise relief by Commercial Solvents
Pty. Ltd.
Another major group or sub-group
within the Boral organisation is the
Gas Supply Company, which utilises
Boral’s output of liquefied petroleum
gases. Recently Pacific Gas Pty. Ltd.
was formed as a jointly owned com-
pany by Boral and the North Shore
Gas Company Ltd. This company will
market liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
in the North Shore Gas Company’s
area of Sydney. The Gas Supply Com-
pany has franchises in eleven centres in
Queensland, eleven in N.S.W., and
twelve in Victoria, as well as operating
in Papua/New Guinea, where it is
associated with W. R. Carpenter Ltd.
The effect of natural gas on the Gas
Supply Company’s activities will, at
this stage, be confined to Victoria, and
the precise result is difficult to fore-
cast.
The other major group is the Vic-
torian quarrying group. This group was
based on the original Albion Quarries
and Reid Quarries groups and recently
the Bayview group has been added. The
supply of bitumenous surfacing for
roads ties in with the Boral refinery
operation since the refinery supplies
bitumen for this purpose. However, the
Victorian quarries are interesting in
their own right, because it would seem
that Boral now has about 70 percent
of the Victorian market for crushed
stone. Furthermore, its deposits are

polyvinyl chloride resins for industry
located within a reasonable distance of
Melbourne and it would also seem
that the reserves which it holds are
adequate for a long time ahead. Be-
cause of the high cost of transporting
a material which has a low basic cost,
the importance of being close to the
centre of Melbourne is evident. The
amalgamation of these three groups will
also produce worthwhile cost savings,
particularly in the integration of the
engineering and transport groups which
serve the quarries.
Boral also operates road contracting
companies in Queensland and N.S.W.,
and in addition it has a controlling
interest in a South Australian group
where the remaining 35 percent is held
by Ready Mixed Concrete, the jointly
owned company of Blue Metal Indus-
tries and CSR.
Boral’s investment portfolio has also
been of some consequence, particularly
over the past four years. An indica-
tion can be given from the following
percentages of Boral’s investment in-
come to the group net profit after tax
which have been as follows:
1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
investment Income %
Net profit after tax 14 1 22.3 30.1 34 6 24.8
The sale of 350,000 BHP shares
since June 30, 1967, will have the effect
of reducing this investment income by
about $65,000 per annum.

The interesting facts, however, will
be those which occur over the next two
to three years. In view of the problems
with the Isomax unit, it is unlikely that
there will be any improvement in pre-
tax profits during this year, although
the income tax provision may be held
down by investment allowances in
respect of this new installation. It is
fairly certain that improved profits can
be expected from almost all other areas
of the company’s activities, and in the
future, that is, from 1968/9 onwards,
we can expect superior profits from the
refinery. There should also be a steady
and significant improvement in the
other major activity, namely the Vic-
torian quarrying companies.
Currently, Boral’s shares are selling
at $1.93, at which price the dividend
yield is 5.2 percent and the price/
earnings multiple is 16.4 on the basis
of adjusted earnings, but only 12.8 on
the published earnings figure. For those
who are prepared to wait until after the
close of the 1967/8 year, the current
price looks to be fairly attractive, but
it is difficult at this stage to say what
could happen to the price when the
result for the first half of 1967/8 is
announced.

CRA'S copper at
Bougainville
CRA has been testing the low-grade
copper orebody on Bougainville Island
since 1964 and, according to a state-
ment made by the chairman of the
Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation, exports
of copper are expected to begin in
1971. This seven-year period of testing
and development matches the time
taken to bring to production the Pala-
bora copper mine in South Africa,
which could provide an increase in
profit of £stg.7-8 million for the Rio
Tinto Zinc Corporation Limited, which
earned £stgl2.3 million last year.
In other respects, too, the orebody at
Bougainville is similar to the Palabora
deposit. Both are low-grade copper de-
posits suitable for open-cut working and
both require a very high volume of ore
treatment in order to be profitable. The
orebody on Bougainville Island has
now been drilled to an extent sufficient
to indicate the presence of 200 million
tons of ore with an average grade of
0.63 percent copper and o.sdwt. per ton
of gold. Further drilling is continuing
and, according to overseas reports, CRA
has estimated that ore reserves will
considerably exceed this figure. Pala-
bora’s proved reserves at the present
time stand at 318 million tons of sul-
phide ore of a grade only slightly
higher (0.8 percent) than Bougainville
and which contain iron and phosphate
in addition to copper.
Here, however, the similarities come
to an end. While Palabora contains
sulphide ore, Bougainville ore consists
of porphyry (which should not be con-
sidered disadvantageous at all), while
the major difference from the point of
view of actual mining arises from the
topographical characteristics of the dif-
ferent locations. Palabora is in a fairly
dry area (north-east Transvaal in South
Africa) and is in country which does
not pose great problems of access and
transport. Bougainville, on the other
hand, has a rainfall of over 200 inches
annually and the local terrain is par-
ticularly difficult. Although CRA has
been working in the area for some
years, there has been no road access
until recently, and the company has
said that the project could not have
been continued without the use of heli-
copters. These difficulties, combined
with the low grade of the ore, would
probably require the proving of further
tonnages of ore before the economic
feasibility of a mining operation is
finally established, for the capital in-
vestment required to develop the mine
would need a fairly long mine life to
lessen the costs of annual amortisation.
The cost of establishing Palabora
amounted to almost SA9O million, but
the problems of access and terrain at
Bougainville would mean something

higher than this —perhaps up to SAIOO
million. In establishing Palabora, Rio
Tinto Zinc and its other equity part-
ners (Newmont Mining, American
Metal Climax, South African Indus-
trial Development Corporation,
Rhodesian Selection Trust, and the
Union Corporation) obtained loan
finance for about 60 percent of total
costs from South African and German
development banks; equity capital sub-
scribed by the various shareholders
came to SA33 million. Should Bougain-
ville be financed in a similar manner,
CRA and its one-third partner in the
venture, New Broken Hill Consolidated,
would have to jointly find SA4O mil-
lion, although this is quite likely to be
reduced following a condition laid
down by the Administration of Papua
and New Guinea that Bougainville
Copper Pty. Limited shall offer 20 per-
cent of its ordinary capital for subscrip-
tion by the Administration acting on
behalf of residents of Papua and New
Guinea. With the Administration pro-
viding SAB million of the equity capi-
tal, New Broken Hill’s contribution
would be $A10.6 million and CRA’s
share $A21.3 million.
What sort of profits is such an in-
vestment likely to produce? The large
scale of operations at Palabora, com-
bined with other advantages such as a
low proportion of overburden, has
allowed that venture to become one of
the world’s best low-cost copper pro-
ducers. For its first year (ended Decem-
ber, 1966), Palabora made a profit of
some SA3O million after operating for
about ten months and producing 68,276
tons of copper of which 58,762 tons
were Sold by the year end. Costs per
ton produced in that period were
SA27O, but for the full 12 months ended
December, 1967, production will exceed
80,000 tons and costs per ton should be
lower on the greater throughput.
Should Bougainville produce at the
same rate as Palabora achieved in its
first ten months, Bougainville’s profit
for the first three years, which are tax
free, would probably be less than the
SA3O million earned by the South
African mine, due to additional costs
imposed by difficulties of access, ter-
rain, and rainfall. Should these add
perhaps $lOO to costs per ton of copper
produced, profit still seems likely to be
in the region of SA2O-24 million.
Should the Administration take up its
20 percent interest in Bougainville
Copper Pty. Limited, CRA would be
left with a 53 1-3 percent interest,
which would add between $10.7 and
$12.8 million to net profits using the
figures above. This compares very well
with its 54 percent of Hamersley’s esti-
mated profits for 1971 of SA22 million,
of which CRA’s share is $l2 million.
Assuming that CRA is able to raise
long-term debt for up to 60 percent
of the likely cost of the project, the
financing of its equity interest of $21.3
million should pose no great difficulty
as this would be spread over two or
three years and the group’s cash flow
during that time will be particularly
strong, with good increases in profits
coming from both Comalco and
Hamersley. It may be a different matter
for New Broken Hill Consolidated,
which has only its Broken Hill lead-
zinc mine to provide it with cash and,
of course, restrictions on investments
outside of the United Kingdom could
perhaps be a factor with this company.
With total net assets of some $30.8
million and $ll million to find, New
Broken Hill may have to look to its
shareholders to contribute toward main-
taining its equity in Bougainville Cop-
per Pty. Limited.

Guessing at copper's potential
SIR GEORGE FISHER, chairman of
Mount Isa Mines, is not the only one
to be ruminating on copper’s fortunes
after the cessation of the U.S. strike.
In America itself, Anaconda’s chairman,
Mr. Charles M. Brinckerhoff, has men-
tioned that, generally speaking, expan-
sion programs are unaffected and will
naturally have the end-effect of building
up the world’s copper output potential.
Mr. Brinckerhoff adds hopefully that
not only will the production catch-up
be expedited, but the world will attain
a productive capacity which “will
eventually protect consumers against the
various troubles that always seem to be
hitting one or other of the major min-
ing fields.”
Mount Isa shareholders were told that
the price of copper “would remain ab-
normally high while the U.S. strike per-
sisted and for the next few months fol-
lowing, and would then be substantially
lower.” Oddly enough, the markets may
not be waiting so long: post-devaluation
levels on the London Metal Exchange
have already begun to give some
ground.
The principal explanation for this
behaviour probably lies in advices from
Chile, where output from El Salvador
is expected to resume as a result of the
Andes Copper Company agreeing to
their strikers’ demands on both wage
rises and 'marginal benefits. There is
also a feeling around that affairs have
reached a final stage in America.
Speculation, perhaps, has also pro-
voked an uneasy tone on the London
market; in terms of immediate circum-
stances, price levels could be somewhat
low. Yet buyers, and speculators, cannot
help but notice that expansiveness pro-
vides the key to the long term.
THE INTERNATIONAL WHEAT
Council’s most recent review takes a
tolerably cheerful attitude on the over-
all world position. In fact it goes so far
as to suggest no valid grounds exist
for considering that heavy surpluses
could be building up. A mild upward
move in stocks during 1966-67 and
1967-68 apparently need not cause any
worry.
The actual carryover stocks of the
leading exporters (Argentina, Aus-
tralia, Canada, France, Italy, Spain,
Sweden, and U.S.A.) are estimated to
rise by about three million tons to 39
million tons over 1967-68. The season’s
production, excluding Communist
China, should total around 273 million
tons, fairly evenly distributed. One re-
sult of this could be less international
trade in wheat; exports may well drop
back by four million tons to 32 million
tons. Significantly, exports to develop-
ing countries could go lower as a re-
sult of generally better harvests (India,
for one, has just reported a very good
spring crop).
The Council believes that the ex-
ceptional factors leading to so many
big surpluses since the end of World
War II are now ironing themselves out.
Yet it does not discount the influence
of technical improvements upon yields
and output.
While on wheat, it is interesting to
note that the Australian Wheat Board
is hoping to develop substitute names
for the familiar f.a.q. descriptions used
throughout this country. Its chairman,
Dr. A. R. Callaghan, thinks there are
“several intangible but significant
reasons for doing so at the present
time.” Confusion arises when the same
f.a.q. prefix is applied to the standards
of five different States. The Board

TANTALUM IS A “speciality” metal
for which demand is clearly increasing.
Curiously enough, the prospects of
working payable quantities in Australia
are quite favorable; not so curiously,
it’s a foreign company doing most of
the searching the Canadian Goldrim
Mining.
Goldrim’s exploration embraces two
areas: Wodgina, within Western Aus-
tralia’s iron ore country, and a 160
square mile tenement in the Northern
Territory. Exploration for and pre-
liminary testing of the tantalite ore
are moving to schedule (so much so
that raising finance for production is
being talked about), although some
metallurgical difficulties may -yet have
to be faced.
The metal’s high melting point has
lately attracted the attention of the
U.S. moon rocket researchers; a less
esoteric use is in the very small con-
densers needed for transistor radios.
American usage went from 600,0001 b.
to one million lb. between 1960 and
1966. Demand is predicted to expand
henceforward at an annual rate of
about 15 percent.
SPOT SILVER PRICES have once
more moved up on the London Metal
Exchange and, according to the well-
known bullion broker Samuel Mont-
agu, recent dealings, particularly in
November, have been dominated by
speculators. Montagu’s market circular
mentions that price oscillations have
“had little to do with the merits or
demerits of silver as a commodity but
buying was encouraged by the feeling
that if some temporary losses were seen
these might well be recouped in the
long run.”
Forward quotes in London, New
York, and on the Continent are ex-
hibiting sizable increases. The circular
estimates an “awesome” 300 million
ounces in speculative holdings over-
hanging the exchanges. Such holdings
can only be absorbed by industrial
users, Montagu remarks.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
After an enlivening midweek improvement (though this was
effected on relatively small volumes), many prices, particularly
among the miners, began to slip back again toward the week’s
close. Yet the first impetus left quite a number of net rises.
BHP advanced a good 65 cents to $15.40, Western Mining
$l.BO to $28.80, and Great Boulder 90 cents to $7.10. Mount
Isa kept its fall, losing 17 cents to close at $4.68, while Hamers-
ley dropped 15 cents to $8.30. Some industrials were better, in-
cluding CSR (up 30 cents), Thiess (40 cents), Swan Brewery
(25 cents), Myer (25 cents), and G. J. Coles (5 cents).

THE LAND
Buyers and the Wool Board’s plan
THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL of
Wool Buyers has come out with a
detailed, acute, and very forcefully
argued case against the Wool Board’s
latest set of proposals on marketing.
The argument is put in such a manner
as to demand an equally detailed reply;
it covers sufficient technically import-
ant ground as to make it impossible to
be fobbed off with a mere collection
of generalities. The Board would be
well advised to treat the Council’s
reasoning with extreme respect.
For the Council cannot be disposed
of just by remarking that “it is one of
the fallacies of our time that the in-
terest of buyer and seller should be
thought to be more coincident than they
usually are”—as a Board spokesman
did in a recent explanatory session
with the General Council of the
Graziers’ Association of N.S.W. Indeed
the Buyers’ chairman, Mr. R. S. Hen-
derson, made it thoroughly plain at his
Press conference that buyers as a whole
are not concentrating on forcing a low
level of prices: they want, above all, to
help secure a steady supply of the right
types of wool for their various prin-
cipals. Mr. Henderson’s formal state-
ment began by maintaining that, in the
plethora of plans and proposals now
culminating in the Board’s desire to
move from a free enterprise to a
statutorily controlled system, detach-
ment and non-intervention are impos-
sible.
A summary of the Board’s program
is once more set out in The Bulletin’s
outline of the CEDA symposium on
wool marketing on pages 54-56 of this
Issue. The Buyers rightly assert that the
program is of a radical nature which,
if implemented, carried significant risks
for all segments of the industry; could
not increase wool prices, maintain them
above growers’ costs of production, or
curb price fluctuations; could cause a
lessening in demand for wool fibre in
the manufacturing sector and increase
substitution of readily available syn-
thetic fibres for wool; would inhibit
investment of capital in expansion of
wool - manufacturing capacity, and
restrict technological development in
the wool textile industry.
Collectively, that’s a pretty com-
prehensive and damaging criticism.
Yet, before getting down to sustaining
it, the Council does take some pains
in listing what it thinks is valuable
in the Board’s report. It finds indi-
vidual merit in recommendations to
establish and enforce standards of clip
preparation; in the notion of increasing
lot size by eliminating one, two, and
three-bale lots and the consequent
reduction of the total number of lots
sold, and in the concept of a price-
averaging plan.
Listing a number of allies to the
strict attack, Mr. Henderson points out
that the Board’s desire for a statutory
authority and supply management has
ignored the warnings of the Inter-
national Wool Textile Organisation,
and wool users in Japan, the United
Kingdom, and Common Market
countries. All of these wish for “the
interplay of supply-demand factors in
a free-auction system.”
Then comes the crunch of detailed
argumentation. Even to implement the
three features of the report of which
the Council approves, it does not think
a statutory body would be needed; it
draws attention to the idea of a non-
statutory authority as originally pro-
posed by a Board Ad Hoc Committee.
In the end, too, improvement to the
auction system may be achieved by
co-operation between growers, brokers,
and buyers.
A statutory authority constitutes, of
course, the core of the Board’s scheme.
It is flatly opposed by the Council as
showing “inadequate understanding of
the realities of the international wool
market,” and as being “fraught with
dangers for the whole industry.”
So far as supply management is
concerned, some 40-50 percent of the
Australian clip might well pass
“rapidly” into the authority’s control —
to be withdrawn from sale if prices
went unreasonably low, to be released
when levels improved. The Council’s
main criticisms are:
(i) A statutory authority, working
with imperfect data, would be forced
to determine on a day-to-day basis the
significance of market trends and
whether, in relation to these, prices
were unreasonably low so that supplies
could be cut off, or whether prices
had improved enough so that wool
could be allowed to flow again. The
Council does not believe a statutory
authority can do this arbitrarily with-
out runnisg serious risks of stockpiling,
frustrating demand, and unbalancing
the market.
(ii) The Authority’s potential for
interference with the free flow of wool
on to the market would be great.
Buyers would never know whether
wool at any given time would be
available at world prices. There is a
real danger that political and economic
pressures would influence the flow of
wool on to the market. Consequently,
buyers’ present confidence in the
accessibility of wool supplies would be
replaced by confusion.
(iii) Because of various factors, such
as human error on the part of the
Authority, resistance by the trade, and
inevitable political and economic
pressures, it is likely that supply man-
agement would expand quickly through
stockpiling of the clip into total
acquisition.
As is now widely realised, the Board
appears to have what amounts to a
fearful obsession with price fluctuations
as such. The Council cannot share the
Wool Board’s fears as to the economic
importance of short-term price fluc-
tuations, or its faith that supply control
will solve this problem. The Board does
not indicate how the Authority can
identify short-term fluctuations in ad-
vance and differentiate them from long-
term fluctuations or trends.
It would appear that the Authority’s
reaction to what it may consider an
unsatisfactory short-term price move-
ment would be to withhold supplies.
This would be playing a dangerous
game when short-term trends could
easily be, in fact, long-term ones, and
the producers of the competitors of
wool—the man-made fibres—would be
only too anxious to fill the gaps thus
created.
On top of all this, the Council per-
haps concludes a little too rhetorically
by sharing “with wool processing
manufacturing and merchandising sec-
tors of the industry a deep optimism in
the future of wool provided that distor-
tions of trade in producing and consum-
ing countries are reduced, and where
possible, eliminated.” That’s what it’s
all about. And the ball has been placed
in the Australian Wool Board’s court.

Ways to police
foot and mouth
LET’S FACE IT: foot and mouth
diseases will break out here some day.
The important thing then is to be able
to recognise immediately that either
you or your animals have got the
disease. State Departments of Agri-
culture and the Commonwealth De-
partment of Health are remiss in not
having already provided stockowne's
with clear descriptions and colored
photographs of the symptoms mani-
fested by this and several other exotic
diseases that could enter the country


CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service
at less cost, contact Crothall & Co. (We’re in the Pink Pages)

despite existing quarantine .measures.
The Health Department has sent one
of its own veterinarians, Mr. H. R.
Peisley, and the Chief Quarantine
Officer of Victoria, Mr. D. M. Flynn,
to study the current serious outbreak
in England, where a quarter of a
million farm animals have been de-
stroyed over the past two months. (The
destruction to date amounts to 0.5 per-
cent of the total population of cattle,
pigs, and sheep in Britain.) Their
main mission is to watch eradication
procedures, but it’s hoped they will also
collect good pictures and send back
prompt, descriptive reports.
When foot and mouth first appeared
in Canada in 1952, nearly three months
passed before an accurate diagnosis was
made. Fortunately, it was midwinter
in the province of Saskatchewan at the
time of the outbreak. Snow and ice
had brought the movement of stock
between markets and farms to a virtual
standstill. As a result only 15 proper-
ties became infected, but eradication
and its associated costs nevertheless
amounted to s3m. The delay also pre-
vented the source of the infection being
definitely pinpointed. From that day
to this the Canadians have never felt
sure that they have managed to shut
the right door and the disease will not
enter the country in the same way
again. However, they are inclined to
blame an immigrant who came from
Europe by air and found work on a
dairy farm almost immediately. What
provisions have we made, it might
well be asked, the stop air travellers go-
ing straight from the tarmacs to the
farms?
Identification of foot and mouth
diseases in the Canadian outbreak was
delayed largely because the symptoms
were confused with those of bovine
papular stomatitis. This disease, which
is of scant economic consequence, is
fairly prevalent in young cattle in Tas-
mania and Victoria, so the same con-
fusion could arise here unless farmers
learn how to distinguish the somewhat
similar lesions of the two diseases.
Probably the simplest way for the lay-
man to tell the difference is by noticing
whether the lesions heal from the centre
outwards or the other way around.
Papular stomatitis begins like foot and
mouth, as small red spots on the tongue,
lips, gums, dental pad, and other sur-
faces in the mouth. In the case of
stomatitis, however, while each spot is
still enlarging, healing begins at the
centre and, therefore, the lesions as-
sume a ring-like appearance. If foot and
mouth is suspected and a vet is called
in, positive proof can be obtained
within a few days. Arrangements have
been made by the Director of Veterin-
ary Hygiene in Australia to have speci-
men material flown to the diagnostic
laboratory at Pfrbright in England,
where complement fixation tests can
be conducted. None of our laboratories
keep the virus for fear it might escape.
Foot and mouth virus exists in seven
strains. Three the ones responsible
for the occasional outbreaks in Eng-
land are endemic in Continental
Europe and South America. The other
four are widespread in Asia and Africa.
These ones are especially virulent, and
even the countries of Europe take con-
siderable pains to exclude them. The
disease, is rampant in Indonesia, but
whether it is caused by the European
or Asian strains is not readily ascertain-
able.
Now that some rapprochement ob-
tains between us and Indonesia, more
people will be travelling to and fro.
Indeed, mutual plans are well advanced
for the establishment of a tourist in-
dustry. Visitors will be directed, among
other places, to view the magnificent
scenery of the island of Bali, with its
bare-breasted women and cattle-loving
Hindu culture. (Unfortunately for the
budding tourist trade the mode of
dress is changing rapidly and mostly
only old women still go about topless.)
A new, Western-style hotel, the Bali
Beach, with accommodation for some
300 people, has recently finished a
building at Sanur. Bali, unlike many
other parts of Indonesia, has a lot of
cattle and a lot of disease. Moreover,
the cattle are not confined to farms
but, as in India, wander through the
towns and villages.
Australian immigration authorities in
England have ceased bringing rural
immigrants by air for the time being
from the F and M Controlled Area,
which at present comprises mainly
northern and western counties. Mean-
while, air passengers from Indonesia are
not carefully treated on arrival here.
Thus, within perhaps ten hours of
trudging through the dung-laden dust
of an Indonesian village, an Australian
farmer could be roving among his
sheep, cattle, or pigs to see how they
fared during his absence on holiday,
Unlike many disease organisms, the
foot and mouth virus can survive for
l° n g periods on inanimate material,
The British believe that most of their
outbreaks start from imported animal
products, notably Argentine beef,
British veterinary officers are posted at
South American abattoirs in an effort
t 0 reduce the risks. However, it is also
believed that several of the outbreaks
derive from food refuse from ships
an d planes. Rats, dogs, and cats eat-
iug such scraps can spread the virus,
Yet one may find these creatures, not
infrequently, roaming around Aus-
tralian dockyards while ships from the
Orient are drawn up alongside. Lack
of proper port facilities in Queensland
and Victoria for the destruction of
ships’ garbage has been criticised
several times over the past couple of
years. The Commonwealth has offered
to install suitable incinerators, but the
States are squabbling about the cost
°F running them. While the bickering
continues, trade with the East grows
and more ships from Asian ports call.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Lanceley in London
COLIN LANCELEY, with his wife,
Kay, and two young children, left
Sydney for London in April, 1965,
after he had won the Helena Rubin-
stein scholarship. On the way there
was Italy, “the most beautiful place
on the face of the earth,” as he
describes it. “Tuscany was incredible.
"We just walked and looked at it. And
ate and drank.”
London meant first a flat in Regent’s
Park. They settled in, and he began
to work. There was the crisis of con-
fidence that troubles so many artists
in a new environment, but there proved
to be no need to pound the streets
from gallery to gallery.
Lanceley had a letter of introduction
to John Russell, the English critic. Rus-
sell made him known to the Marl-
borough galleries. First he was to*have
a part in a group show at the Marl-
borough. That fell through, to his dis-
appointment. Better luck came soon.
The gallery, after seeing his work,
offered him a one-man show. That was
a success, and Marlborough now man-
ages him as his agents. His experience
shows how a painter’s future can hang
on a quick impression. As the artist
remembers it, the Marlborough boss
“came in for two minutes, ran around
and saw everything, said ‘l’m very im-
pressed’ and went away.” His No. 2
later came to see Lanceley and
arrangements were finalised.
The Museum of Modern Art in New
York has bought six Lanceley prints
and four drawings. He won a £5OO
prize at the Edinburgh Festival. His
“pieces,” as he calls them, are selling
in Britain, on the Continent, and in
the U.S.A., where he hopes to have a
New York show before long. He will
probably have an Australian show in
a year or so.
His current prices range from £BOO
upwards a piece. Gallery commissions
and other costs usually take about half,
but if he can keep producing at his
normal pace he can feel that he is
doing well.
Like most artists in Britain he
teaches on the side. He teaches paint-
ing and drawing at the Bath Academy
of Art on Lord Methuen’s old estate
in Wiltshire. His home now is in
Blenheim Crescent, Ladbroke Grove,
in north-west London, a four-storey
white terrace house.
He has a biggish studio upstairs, with
workbench where he can shape the
woods he uses so expressively. Two lots
of shelves are packed with a fantastic
collection of wooden shapes, originally
made for engineering workshops as pat-
terns for cogs and tool-parts. He got a
lot from the old Morts Dock in Sydney.
He listens to a great deal of music
— Bartok, Wagner, Ravel, Debussy,
Mahler, the Beethoven chamber works.
Prints commissioned by the Marlbor-
ough were inspired by a Bartok ballet
suite. “I’m a mighty Bartok man,” he
said. “I wanted to pay some sort of
homage. I think I did arrive at the
kind of imagery I could do it with.”
He is working well in London. He
works much longer hours, “because I
don’t go out.”' There is no temptation,
as there was in Sydney, to break off
and swim. He is still absorbed deeply
in problems of using both a flat or
curved picture plane and sculpted or
modelled forms related to this surface.
“I’m not interested in interpreting
images of the world,” he says. “I try
to create metaphors . . . visual
poetry ...”

Meadmore in New York
By APRIL HERSEY
ENJOYING THE EYE of the hurri-
cane in an art sense, sculptor Clem
Meadmore is thoroughly happy in his
life in New York.
Four years ago he went there to
help with designs for the World’s
Fair. He remembers clearly the
immediate impetus he felt in the
“no-holds-barred rat-race” of the
great city. Pitted against the finest
artists in the country, and in his
opinion some of the finest in the
world, his ideas surged forward.
He wanted to produce a lot more
work, to think on a bigger and more
productive scale.
“Art is not significant unless it
finds new directions,” he feels. “And
New York was a tremendous
stimulus to me.”
Unconcerned with what he calls
“the geographical thing,” he knows
that he would have gone on design-
ing and working in Australia, but
considers that in America he is
“doing better work because things seem
more possible.”
“I wouldn’t have done the same
things in Australia. I would have pro-
ceeded in more conventional terms,
forced to accept almost anyone’s critical
judgment. The person I most re-
spected then and still do is Daniel
Thomas.
“No one had heard of me when I
arrived here. And I feel that when I
was working at home I was cut off in
an unreal world. It is the tragedy of
the parochial artist wherever he is—
Japan, Paris, anywhere. To me New
York is very much the centre. London
is important, but all the major British
artists come to the States to exhibit.
In fact if you stay in one place long
enough you will meet the world in
New York.”
This does not mean that Meadmore
is not looking forward to coming back
to from time to time. He
misses the clean air, the people, and
many intangibles. He is hoping to be
invited to do some work in Canberra,
but remembering past isolation intends
to insist that his fare back to the
United States be part of the deal.
In his studio among the welded steel
and monolithic pieces, he works in
bursts, a few weeks at a time “after
a period of dormancy.” His work has
been shown recently at the Guggenheim
International Exhibition and the Rocke-
feller and Whitney Museum and he
has been invited to produce the Aus-
tralian sculpture for the Olympic
Games in Mexico, a subject he plans
to have towering twenty feet above the
piazza. He has also designed a chair
in leather and steel to be retailed in
galleries for about $250.
A serious, intent man in his late
thirties, he likes working in heavy
stolid materials which can be lifted to
delicacy and subtlety. But he also likes
definite form, simple shapes.
“When you get down to the essence
of what sculpture really is, it is very
hard to define. Design in itself can be
flippant. Sculpture is very serious. It
isn’t deadly serious, but it is involved.
The chair I have designed, for instance
— sculpture is not necessary for the
chair, nor is the chair sculpture. It is
a design solving specifics, whereas
sculpture solves visual problems.”

Theatre
Tasker Agonistes
By ROBERT WARD
THE STRANGE HISTORY of the
South Australian Theatre Company
might be titled “Tasker Agonistes.”
This would satisfy those who see John
Tasker as Eliot’s Sweeney and those
who see him as Milton’s Samson. But
I would like to indulge in allusion
further, using Swift: the Company
itself was conceived in Brobdingnag,
from whence it was transported to
Lilliput, where it fell into the hands of
a colony of Laputans.
It was formed in June, 1965, by the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust as part of
John Tasker... out on his own
the long-term plan to establish regional
theatre companies in all States. John
Tasker was appointed Director, with
the Trust South Australian Representa-
tive, Mr. Glen Mcßride, as Business
Manager. In 1965 things seemed
promising. Max Frisch’s “Andorra,”
Livermore and McKenzie’s musical
“West of the Black Stump,” Coward’s
“Private Lives,” Osborne’s “Inadmis-
sible Evidence,” and Rolf Hochhuth’s
“The Representative” were presented,
along with a country tour, in less than
six months, and though the Company’s
budget of ten thousand dollars includ-
ing salaries was exceeded, it was un-
doubtedly an excellent start.
In 1966 activities were more limited.
For the Fifth Adelaide Festival,
Shaffer’s “The Royal Hunt, of the Sun”
was produced with Festival backing.
Mr. Tasker was then lent to the New
Zealand Opera Company, and on his
return he produced Ralph Peterson’s
“The Night of the Ding Dong.” This
toured for ten weeks as part of the
Interstate Theatre Season, and was that
venture’s only commercial success. The
other noteworthy event of the year was
the appointment of a Company Board
of Management. The year’s budget of
$lO,OOO was spent on salaries and in
sending a large cast on tour.
In early 1967 Mr. Tasker produced
“The Royal Hunt of the Sun” for the
Perth Festival, and then plays for a
Young Elizabethan tour of the State.
This was followed by the recent excel-
lent season of Albee’s “A Delicate
Balance,” Hopgood’s “The Golden
Legion of Cleaning Women,” and
Pinter’s “The Homecoming.” The
year’s budget had been $14,000, and
the season ended with a healthy surplus
in the bank.
Thus, in view of the finances avail-
able and the variety of generally un-
satisfactory theatres in which the Com-
pany has performed, the record stands
as one of minor but definite achieve-
ment.
In the light of recent events, it’s
hard not to wonder if the company
has a future. Initially, the long-term
aim was the establishment of a local
repertory company with a permanent
body of actors, continuity of director-
ship, and a reasonably extensive sea-
son. As the company stands now, not-
withstanding the overall quality of its
past productions, only the most avid
theatregoer would know it to be more
than just another theatre group.
Three singular events took place this
year which have undoubtedly changed
the course of the company’s develop-
ment. The first was the co-option of
Professor Wal Cherry to the Board,
the next was the adoption by the Board
of a constitution which stressed the
Board’s autonomy and changed Mr.
Tasker’s title from Director to that of
Resident Producer, finally there was the
dismissal of Mr. Tasker himself. In
conversations with Wal Cherry and
John Tasker neither gentleman can
provide an adequate explanation for
the Board’s majority decision. Sifting
through the claims and counter claims,
it would seem simply that the Board
was prepared to have Mr. Tasker pro-
duce, but definitely not direct.
One is not surprised that trouble
arose, since on the one side of the
Board we have earnest Adelaide busi-
nessmen without practical knowledge
of theatre, and on the other, two who
have been actively involved in local
amateur theatre, and Wal Cherry, who
is in all senses a professional theatre
man. It is rare to find two producers
agreeing on method. With the Board,
Mr. Tasker was simply outnumbered.
Perhaps he is the only person to
emerge unscathed from the affair. His
reputation as an efficient young pro-
ducer has been increased over the past
three years, and he was immediately
offered on his own terms the Director-
ship of the Canberra Repertory Theatre,
which position he has declined in
favor of an unstated long-term pro-
ject of his own.
As for the company’s plans, 1968 is
much the same. Five plays will be
sprinkled lightly throughout the year,
produced by five different producers,
and secreted away in the Adelaide
Teachers’ College Theatre. They in-
include such dynamic fare as “A Tale
of Two Cities” and, would you believe
it, “Dial M For Murder.”

The writing game
By CHARLES HIGHAM
THIS PAST WEEK has seen visits
from two prominent Hollywood writers:
James R. Webb, author of the scripts
for “How the West Was Won,” William
Wyler’s “The Big Country,” John
Ford’s “Cheyenne Autumn,” and many
other famous films, and Leigh Brackett,
who wrote “The Big Sleep” from Ray-
mond Chandler’s novel, “Rio Bravo,”
and “El Dorado.”
Webb is here at the invitation of
the Australian chapter of the Inter-
national Writers’ Guild, of which he
was formerly president and is now
chairman. At a meeting of the Guild
in Hollywood in October, 1966, Aus-
tralian writer James Workman com-
plained that the situation for the TV
script writer here was uniquely bad.
Webb has followed this up by seeing
the Broadcasting Control Board and
the Prime Minister’s cultural adviser,
Mr. Keith Sinclair. “I believe that Gov-
ernment action is the solution; it de-
pends on what they do and when they
do it,” he said. Pie said that the Guild’s
members all over the world had
pledged themselves to change the Aus-
tralian situation. When asked whether
in fact there were sufficient good
writers here to fill the gap, should such
a quota come about, he replied that
with first-class story editors, and pro-
ducers who were really rewriters (in
Hollywood, that was their role) the
present problems could be solved.
In Hollywood, Mr. Webb said,
writers were in tremendous demand,
and men who had done no more than
write university plays were hired by
the studios; his secretary’s husband had
broken in there with little or no ex-
perience. The beginning is usually to
submit ideas, then synopses; once a
writer has some series to his credit, he
can earn S4OOO-SSOOO for a one-hour
script. As a member of a series writer’s
team (usually six strong) he will write
about eight or nine scripts a year, and
can, therefore, earn up to $30,000 even
at the medium stages of success.
Mr. Webb himself is in the much
higher paid bracket of scriptwriters
and. at our guess, is on the $200,000 a
script category. He began in the tough


schools of Republic in the ’forties and
Warners in the ’thirties, joined Hecht-
Hill-Lancaster (“which shortened my
life by several years”), writing
“Apache,” “Vera Cruz” with Burt
Lancaster and “Trapeze” with Gina
Lollobrigida, directed by Sir Carol
Reed. He is now working on “The
Patton Story,” based on the life of the
famous general, for William Wyler,
and a sequel to “Hawaii,” based on
Michener’s novel, for the Mirisch
Brothers. Recent scripts include “Sin-
ful Davey,” for John Huston, shot in
Ireland, and next year will see the
completion of his “Alfred the Great.”
Leigh Brackett began her career by
selling “No Gold for a Corpse” to
Warners, and then worked with William
Faulkner on the “The Big Sleep” script
(“no actor born of woman could speak
his dialogue. It was all in high-flown
Victorian sentences that went on for-
ever”). But she did enjoy working with
Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart,
the film’s stars. Bogart, she said, had
improvised several scenes.
She often had to write scenes 18
times for Howard Hawks, who had dir-
ected most of her screenplays: he would
take bits from each new script and use
them, out of order if necessary. She
was critical of the Western film’s many
myths: “Those duels in picturesque
streets at dawn are nonsense. A man in
those days would just hide behind a
building and shoot his enemy in the
back. And those saloon girls didn’t
exist. They were rather ugly prosti-
tutes in long, low, log buildings full of
smoke. Code of the West? Phooey.”

On the beach
By ELWYN LYNN
Charles Blackman, Rudy Komon Gal-
leries, Sydney.
Arch Cuthbertson, Stern’s Gallery, Syd-
ney.
Derek Smith and Bernard Sahm, Gal-
lery A, Sydney.
CHARLES BLACKMAN, in his third
one-man show in Sydney, has taken his
softly diffused, shadowed, or bleached
figures outside to latch on to the
rhythms of the ocean or to go inside
again glowingly incandescent with the
peachy, ruddy radiance of the sun.
This happens in the simplest and most
rapturous of his present 25 works, the
Nude-Sunbather, who hovers in a bril-
liant green that grows glad flowers;
full, as it is, of the oceanic sensation
of merging with the world, one is never-
theless kept alert by the smoothly in-
sistent curve of a leg and the crisp
arcs of the palpitating posterior. In
Nude-Yellow Flowers, the body, pre-
sented in Blackman’s semi-silhouette
manner and looking a little over-
broiled, begins to melt into the redness,
but the fusion is magically arrested by
the yellow flowers, which are just what
is left of the golden underpainting and
which hold, like capillaries of sunshine,
the warmth that has invaded Black-
man’s paintings since his return from
London.
If these nudes are flushingly turned-
on, it’s for themselves: they all look
like unsexy narcissists to me.
In taking his figures to Bondi, Black-
man is facing new problems: his paint-
ings of domestic bliss and shadowed
loneliness were so diffused that he often
gave structure and emphasis by adding
stripes or a red bar (as here in the
florid Departure), but now he tries to
involve his figures in the lilt of the
ocean, to sink them, as it were, once
more in the amnionic fluid. In the
frieze-like Blue Wanes the bodies are
composed of the gentle undulations of
the sea.
Blackman never indulges in mere
atmospherics or sweet tranquillisers;
he’s no Phillip Sutton taking the crisp
edge off Matisse, but alerts you with
a set of stripes on cap and costume in
Life-Savers, Bondi or cool, tense curves
of foliage in Nude-Transparent Room.
His rein on charm is even tighter in
the charcoal drawings, and the people
in his large, 60 inches square, Wave
Watchers (a really important drawing
in our brief art history) brood on the
ocean, and in others dark figures are
lost in the waves that grow funereally
black toward the horizon. It’s enlight-
ening to note that Blackman shares
with Seurat a fascination with both
the sun-drenched world and nocturnal
gloom; in Bather (1) a sombre melan-
choly envelops the soft-solid white
flesh that melts away. What the draw-
ings reveal is that despite the apparent
optimism of his sit-ins and sit-outs,
there is an air of dissatisfied alienation
and one has only to think of Matisse to
realise that Blackman is not just con-
cerned with calm, luxury, and
voluptuousness.
This collection (it’s not a balanced
or thematic show) has some splendid
works, but his beach collage-drawings
show how mechanical are the divisions
in Beach Album, which, having some of
the formal qualities of his suites of
around 1960, lacks their mesmeric im-
pact, and Redleaf Sunbathers is
troubled, coarse, and crowded. It is
when his rapport fails that Blackman
falters; in his best works one can feel
the restrained, exultant excitement and
involvement; while Molvig is involved
with symbolism, Nolan with a savor-
ing detachment, and Perceval a desper-
ate immersion, Blackman has some-
thing of the mysticism of Vaughan who
saw eternity in a grain of sand.
Blackman loves appearances, but
Arch Cuthbertson, in most of his 19
tondos medallions or circular shields
goes underground and beneath the
sea, to re-present, in textures of glues
and convoluted lead strips, fossils, strata,
traces of marine life, and eroded land-
forms. Just as on shields from primitive
times to the Renaissance were signi-
ficant scenes enacted so it is here:
some, like Ancient Garden, are like
tarnished medallions; the pale shifting
blue in Progeny of Adam is as serene
as a Della Robbia plaque and World
of Adam is composed of such tight,
shallowly embossed convolutions that it
resembles a razed maze.
Only in two opulent discs does he
fail to wed the movements to the cir-
cumference; it is no mean achieve-
ment that he does this in most of the
works and, as well, evokes an arche-
typal, mythical world. Despite some
decorative artificiality, he often attains
a tough monumentality.
The monumental pots by Derek
Smith and Bernard Sahm are made
to look like statues and household gods
by the presence of Sahm’s garden pots
and candle-stands, with rudimentary
features something in the manner of
Max Ernst. Potters like Smith, Sahm,
Gazzard, Moon, and Travis are eroding
the distinction between pottery and
sculpture and Sahm does this not only
with his semi-figures but also with
heavy, dark-rimmed dishes and sagging
bowls. Smith’s are less aggressive, more
poised, and are often concerned with
balancing single- and double-spouted
bulbous forms on slender cylinders;
he’s a fine, pure craftsman in his bowls
and especially in a set of grey-rimmed,
red-stained rice dishes. He has, however,
baroque tendencies when he fills rough,
gouged clay, stained with black oxide,
with glass to form ashtray paper-
weights.
Sahm and Smith attest to the healthy
state of ceramics in Australia, but per-
haps a little over-stated when compared
to the Japanese at Bonython’s; Aus-
tralia is fortunate to have them and
they are fortunate to be shown in
galleries and noticed by reviewers
it’s rarely done outside Australia.

Peanut brittle
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Generation. William Goodhart. St.
Martin’s, Melbourne.
Arkally. Don Evans. Monash Univer-
sity, Melbourne.
“THE SECRETS of the young?” says
the snap-brim, Ivy-league obstetrician.
“I’ll tell you one of them. They use
glad-wrap for a contraceptive.” This
extraordinary piece of scatological in-
formation provides the big laugh in
William Goodhart’s good-natured but
unremarkable comedy.
Concerned with that contempory
obsession, the generational gap, the play
is all but identical with William Inge’s
“Where Is Daddy?” presented by the
same company earlier this year. But


where the Inge play was marshmallow,
Goodhart’s is at least peanut brittle.
Jim Bolton, an advertising man of
erstwhile leftist leanings, has brought up
his daughter to be a free thinker. He’s
been so successful at it that when he
arrives in New York to meet her brand-
new husband, he finds that the birth of
her baby is only days away. Further-
more, she and her photographer hus-
band intend to deliver it unassisted in
their studio flat so as nothing will sully
the natural beauty of the experience.
For the rest of the evening daddy
fights with his idealist son-in-law and
plots to introduce an obstetrician at
the critical moment. Ultimately the
defiant young husband finds the do-
it-yourself delivery beyond him, and
acquiesces to social convention. But
we’re assured that something of the
young couple’s naive purity has rubbed
off bn the compromised adman. Amen.
This is one of those American plays
which translate perfectly into Aus-
tralian. It could be easily set in Syd-
ney or Melbourne, and perhaps even
Adelaide. Yet Irene Mitchell insists
on that tired old convention of
American accents. This produces some
extraordinary noises, for, despite the
fact that we’re constantly exposed to
variations of the original on TV and in
films, it’s rare to find a local actor
who can cope. Most of the cast spoke
a sort of strange international pidgin,
while Keith Davies contributed a
nervous mixture of Irish and Welsh.
Only Joseph James, as the doctor,
proved himself a competent mimic.
“Arkally” is based on a prize-
winning short story by film-maker
Peter Tammer concerning a renegade
from National Service. The original
parodied Greek legend in a fairly suc-
cessful attempt at ridiculing heroics.
But the parody is Don Evans’ dramati-
sation which leaves nothing but a
prolonged and undistinguished revue
sketch. The production had an insecure
cast moving at such a snail’s pace that
the play dragged despite no fewer than
23 short scenes. In retrospect, it makes
me object less to “Private Yuk.”

Good job
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
II Posto. Director, Ermanno Olmi.
Seconds. Director, John Franken-
heimer.
Kaleidoscope. Director, Jack Smight.
IT IS FRUSTRATING when the
limited run of a film forces a reviewer
to say, in effect: “Here’s a movie not
to be missed, but hard luck! you’ve
missed it.” It is to be hoped that Olmi’s
funny, touching, and understated
study of a boy undergoing the process
of growing up may have a wider circu-
lation here.
Nothing very dramatic happens. The
boy passes the entrance exam to a large,
anonymous company, starts off as office
boy and finally graduates to junior
clerkship; he suffers the pangs of first
love over a girl who is separated from
him by the fact that they work in dif-
ferent sections and eat their canteen
lunch at different sittings; he is per-
suaded by his thrifty mother to buy a
“serviceable” raincoat instead of the
sporty one he’s longing for. At the end
he has, without dramatics and almost
unconsciously, resigned himself to a
lifetime in his safe, dull job.
Yet Olmi doesn’t make the shades of
the prison-house too murky; the boy
is no more a victim than most of us;
the loss of his youthful freedom and
aspirations is unfortunate but inevit-
able. He sees himself as one of the
lucky ones, and even manages to get
a good deal of fun out of an appalling
staff dance, a beautifully observed and
sometimes agonisingly funny sequence.
This is essentially a director’s film.
Olmi’s technique is absolutely control-
led and assured, but without stylistic
excesses, and his handling of the non-
professional Sancho Panzeri in the cen-
tral role is masterly. The rest of the
cast is beautifully chosen, and though
none cf the other characters is devel-
oped—their importance is in their im-
pact on the boy—Olmi uses them to re-
veal the closed-in life of the company,
with its jealousies, jockeying for posi-
tion, and petty one-upmanship. The
movie might indeed be sub-titled “How
To Try In Business Without Really
Succeeding.”
Olmi’s almost offhand technical skill
is not echoed in either of the other
two films, in both of which the direc-
tor’s hand is often very heavy. A
second viewing of Frankenheimer’s
“Seconds,” seen at the Festival, con-
firms the opinion that it certainly isn’t
one of this director’s first rank. It has
impressive opening and closing
sequences, though even here there’s an
uneasy impression that Frankenheimer
is tugging at your sleeve and whis-
pering: “Now see what I can do with
a camera!”
But it is well worth seeing, despite
its affectations and dead patches, for
the good things in it an interesting
script about a man who fulfils every-
one’s dream of a new life and then
finds that inside the handsome, vigor-
ous new body there still exists the
dreary, dissatisfied old self; a surpris-
ingly adequate performance from Rock
Hudson. For this, I think, we can
thank the director.
Style runs riot in “Kaleidoscope,”
with Jack Smight apparently trying to
make Antonioni’s “Blow-up” look as
old-fashioned as whalebone stays. But
mod clothes, with-it dialogue, and odd
camera angles can’t disguise the fact
that the script is quite old-world, with
a rather gallant criminal he robs
the rich to give to himself being
forced to ply his card-sharping trade
for moral purposes.

Splendid Verdi
By JOHN CARGHER
Un Ballo in Maschera (Verdi).. Leon-
tyne Price, Carlo Bergonzi, Robert
Merrill, Shirley Verrett, Reri Grist;
conducted by Erich Leinsdorf. R.C.A.
LSC 8003 (3 discs $18.90).
“UN BALLO IN MASCHERA” be-
longs to Verdi’s middle period, which
contains some of his greatest music and
most uneven writing. The operas from
“I Vespri Siciliani” to “Don Carlos”
need great performances to make them
acceptable and none more so than Un
Ballo, which has more than its share of
trite pages. Fortunately the new RCA
recording ranks with the best perform-
ances of a complete opera ever re-
corded, which makes it possible to eval-
uate this strange work dispassionately.
Due to the exigencies of the political
censorship of Verdi’s day, “Un Ballo in
Maschera” has been presented in many
guises.
Originally based upon the true his-
tory of the assassination of Gustav 111
of Sweden at a masked ball, the censors
demanded and got a transplantation of
the plot to the then British colonial
city of Boston. This somewhat ruined
the dramatic effect; the blood and thun-
der of royal intrigues sit ill among
minor colonial officials. In recent
years the scene has been transferred
back to Sweden, but musically the most
logical step was probably that taken in
Paris which changed the locale to
Naples, where the Earl of Warwick be-
came the Duke de Olivares who dis-
guises himself as a Neapolitan fisher-
man, giving some credence to Ric-
cardo’s sunnier tunes.
The key figure is Carlo Bergonzi’s
Riccardo (Earl of Warwick!) who has
never been better. The part suits him
vocally and histrionically to perfection.
Leontyne Price, as his unhappy lady
love, is now a true prima donna of the
old tradition and she carries that status
with great authority. There is the be-
ginning of a Sutherland hoot in the
middle voice here and there, but this
is a small price to pay for singing on
this high level. With Shirley Verrett
and Reri Grist, Miss Price gives the set
an all-Negro female cast. Their com-
bined efforts are, I would say, better
than anything a white cast could do
today. Verrett is rapidly becoming the
world’s leading mezzo and Grist has
already recorded Gilda in “Rigoletto”
as her first step up the ladder of suc-
cess. Robert Merrill continues to aston-
ish with some superb singing. His
standards should surely be slipping by
now, 22 years after his Metropolitan
debut, but they do not. The conduct-
ing of Erich Leinsdorf is very good
indeed and the recorded sound cannot
be faulted. Strongly recommended.


BOOKS
Too much dust for the light
to show through
By JOHN BAXTER
No Laughing Matter. Angus Wilson.
Seeker and Warburg. $5.30.
EVERY ENGLISH PUNDIT sees
the era between Sarajevo and Suez as
one complex with change, but verdicts
on its importance vary widely from
guarded socialist approval to an
hysterically patriotic parochialism.
Angus Wilson in his latest novel chooses
to view it in terms of an inevitable
but disturbing decay of standards, a
period which saw destroyed a number
of lovable, if rather ridiculous, institu-
tions that, for all their redundancy,
could not be put behind one without
some regret.
Like Galsworthy and Williamson,
Wilson takes as the vehicle for his
Angus Wilson... intermittently cosy
comment those complex familial struc-
tures so central to British life, dissecting
one group in the hope that his readers
will draw parallels if not with society
at large then with their own condition.
The Matthews are far from typical of
British families, but their problems are
in microcosm those of Britain herself
during the period he discusses. One
might even care to consider “No Laugh-
ing Matter” a vast allegory of social
change were Wilson’s references not so
determinedly particular.
The heavy Victorian fantasy of the
book’s opening chapter initially suggests
the symbolic approach, encouraging us
to see William Matthews and his pre-
cocious brood as something more than
another family visiting the Wild West
Exhibition in West Kensington in the
summer of 1912. Wilson shows each of
the family’s members identifying with
some aspect of the ersatz American West
presented; father and mother are sturdy
pioneers en route by wagon to Cali-
fornia; their children helpers, hunters,
even one of them an eagle circling over
the group with neurotic detachment.
Though the fantasy fades as domestic
squabbles and the emerging ineptitude
of Matthews pere, failed writer and in-
cipient drunkard, become more strongly
featured, we can never erase from our
minds the sense of unreality which this
early section establishes. If this
Edwardian vision of frontier purity and
resolve is Wilson’s ideal, the sections
which follow must certainly be seen as
the beginning of its decay. The war-
time world of genteel high-life, pheasant
for lunch, and holidays at the seaside,
has a mood of subtle unease, added to
by the author’s careful rendering in im-
plication and nuance of the family
members and their predilections. The
mother and father, called with affec-
tionate contempt Billy Pop and The
Countess, become foils for the malicious
wit of Quentin, soon to be a second-
rate politician, the disdain of Marcus,
already devotedly homosexual, the
barbed devotion of Rupert, born both
to be an actor and, like Quentin, to
remain in the second rank of his chosen
profession.
The feeling that all are born to fail
is sustained through the entire novel,
the children carrying with them always
the tenacity of their kind, the ability
to survive everything society throws at
them, but as well the lack of vision
which means their inevitable downfall.
Confident in the worth of their lives,
they see all change as something to be
accepted but never espoused. Bending
with the blows of nature and history
they remain the same stout, fearless
pioneers they were in their fantasy of
the Wild West.
Wilson’s rendering of this process is
as meticulous as we may expect from
so careful an observer of English mores.
No detail is left unnoted of conversa-
tion, morals, or manners, and his tech-
nique of setting in play form a number
of the more subtle scenes adds to the
accuracy of his approach while forcing
us to take a more detached view of the
book as a whole. Few novels have been
written in which minutiae occupy quite
so central a place in the action, Wilson
barraging us with a flood of description
which, like stage directions, tells us
what is happening without, in any way,
giving us an insight into the process.
As the novel wears on, one becomes
increasingly out of sympathy with the
windy, dry discursiveness of Wilson’s
narrative. Aiming for the illusion of
topicality by a profusion of dropped
names, he develops relentlessly his vis-
ion of the Matthews as people whose
lives have become, for better or worse,
a series of less and less successful ges-
tures. The old Edwardian standards no
longer apply, but still they battle on;
only Margaret, the writer whose frus-
tration and bitterness spend themselves
in acid novels, suggesting anything of
the potential which all have in them to
succeed and adapt. This process, if
shown by Wilson to be the just result
of their shortsightedness, might have
been the basis of a salutary and disturb-
ing object lesson for the reader, but the
occasional note of affectionate melan-
choly which he introduces into the
book makes it impossible for us ever
sufficiently to separate ourselves from
the Matthews so as to learn from them.
Wilson would like to despise them, but
his heart just isn’t in it.
“No Laughing Matter” is aptly
named; the process of a society in decay
lacks most of the elementary attributes
of humor, nor does it seem to hold
much hope of success for any approach
other than cool detached observation.
By making this book at least intermit-
tently as cosy as an autobiography,
Wilson has failed in his basic intention;
that of reflecting with some accuracy
the changes he has seen in English life
during his time. What might have been
an illuminating catalogue of social
aberrations becomes instead a literary
potpourri filling the novel form with
dry rose petals, faded French postcards,
and, most noticeable of all, the irrele-
vant odor of dust.

The Hero as Geoffrey Dutton
By PETER COLEMAN
The Hero as Murderer. The Life of
Edward John Eyre. Geoffrey Dutton.
Collins/Cheshire. $4.95.
GEOFFREY DUTTON attempted
three things in this book to write a
life of Edward John Eyre, the great
explorer of Western and South Austra-
lia; write an essay on the nature of
heroism; and “explore the mystery
how this humane [Australian] hero be-
came the butcher of Negroes in Jam-
aica,” where he was Acting Governor
about the time of the American Civil
War. As a life of Eyre, it is superb
and his chapters on the great expedi-
tion around the Bight are a contribution
to the literature of exploration but
as an essay on heroism it fails, and con-
sequently it fails to explain how r his
Australian hero turned into a Jamaican
butcher who suppressed a Nego rebel-
Dutton... false mystery
lion by killing 439 rebels, flogging about
600 others, including women, and burn-
ing down 1000 houses.
Dutton’s trouble is that he creates the
mystery —in order to explain it. He
makes out that Eyre was 'both hero and
humanist who underwent some strange
change after he left Australia —whereas,
in fact, heroes, even second-level ones
like Eyre, are simply not democratic
humanists like Geoffrey Dutton, and
when they show this in action no
unusual explanation is really called for.
In other words, there is no mystery to
explore: Eyre, obsessed with Duty,
endowed with a capacity for self-
torture in the cause of Duty, and an
insatiable ambition to do remarkable
things, became a famous explorer. The
same Eyre, in a lazy slum of a colony
like mid-19th-century Jamaica, where
the people scorned his ideas of Duty
and self-torture, and faced with a
bloodthirsty “slave revolt,” let loose the
British Army to restore order. His
friend the Australian explorer Alex-
ander Hume saw no subtle mystery in
it: Eyre had, in Hume’s view, shown
the same steel-like “heroism” in
Jamaica that he had shown in South
and Western Australia, and there is no
doubt that Eyre himself thought like-
wise—his “long silence” on the matter
being part of the same pattern of
dutiful self-abnegation. The only
mystery is the folly of the British Gov-
ernment in sending him to Jamaica.
The point is that heroes are not very
pleasant people and are useless in poli-
tics. We can’t have it both ways: expect
a man to walk across 1000 miles of
desert, nearly die several times of thirst,
risk being killed by natives, suffer
agonising hardship for months (“incred-
ible” is the usual adjective applied to
Eyre’s ordeal and it is apt enough) —-to
go through all this and still be a reason-
able sort of bloke, with a premature
E. M. Forster view of race relations
who, faced with the possibility of a
black massacre of a white minority (as
had happened elsewhere in the West
Indies), should have “connected” with
the Negroes and settled the problem
amicably. Of course, he should have
done that; but in that case he would
have been the sort of reasonable man
who would never have contemplated
walking to probable death across 1000
miles of desert. Heroes, we have to
admit, are always a' bit potty, a bit
hard to get on with.
But after creating a mystery in order
to try to solve it, even Dutton admits ■
he can’t really solve it, except by specu-
lating about the iron entering Eyre’s
soul as Lieutenant-Governor in New
Zealand, where he was systematically
humiliated by Governor Grey. And, in
fact, the only apparent paradox in the
whole story is that Eyre, as Protector
of Aborigines in Moorundie, took a real
interest in the Aborigines, despised the
colonial thugs who shot them up, and
had progressive ideas about dealing
with them. But he was concerned there
with a minority of tribal “savages” not
a majority of lumper-proletariat and
peasantry; no doubt if the Aborigines
had been as “advanced,” powerful, and
as little in need of his “protection” as
the Jamaican Negroes he would have
been less condescending and “protec-
tive” to them.
To cap it off, Dutton does not really
want to classify Eyre as a butcher, al-
though his theme requires it. He does
call Eyre a butcher, but faced with the
extreme anti-Eyre faction from John
Stuart Mill up to Lord Olivier (the
Governor of Jamaica from 1907 to
1913), he jumps to Eyre’s defence:
Eyre, he tells us, was in a terrible pre-
dicament; the vicious British Army
was largely to blame; there was a
threat of a blood-bath; what did John
Stuart Mill know about the problems of
governing West Indian colonies? (Dut-
ton even uses the word “detestable” in
relation to Mill’s indignation); what
about the Indian Mutiny (just nine
years before the Jamaica Rebellion)
why were Mill and Co. so silent about
that?
And always in attempting to excuse
him, he refers back to the “humane”
Protector of Aborigines (which raises
the question of a mysterious change)
rather than the “heroic” explorer
(which does not). Yet the real theme
of Eyre’s life, as Dutton tells it, is not
some mysterious change in character,
but the predictable development of a
Duty-tortured explorer when put in
charge of a rebellious Negro colony.
Perhaps the final question is: was
Eyre a hero at all, even in his great
Australian days? Carlyle for one, Eyre’s
fervent defender, called him a prig.
But, as Dutton asks of Mill, we may
well ask of Carlyle: what did the book-
ish Hero-Worshipper know about strug-
gling across 1000 miles of desert around
the Australian Bight? It seems better
to accept Eyre for what he was: some-
thing of a hero who, like all heroes,
should never have been put in charge
of a problem colony. He takes away
from the real mystery of heroism to
create a false mystery in order to turn
Eyre into a sort of olden-days Geoffrey
Dutton who went wrong.
Two faces
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
A Century of Conflict. Essays for A. J.
P. Taylor. Edited by Martin Gilbert.
Hamish Hamilton. $6.15.
TAYLOR BELONGS to a small group
of British specialists in Central Euro-
pean affairs and he is what the- 1 late
Victor Adler would have called ein
ausgelernter Oesterreicher, a man who
has “gone native,” or almost, in what
was once the Hapsburg monarchy. And
yet, I find him “too clever by half,” for-
ever given to Potters “two club” ploy:
showing his knowledgeable “middle
European” face to the English public
and being very much the insular and
moralising English gentleman vis-a-vis
middle Europe. Unlike other Britons
who have made Central Europe their
field, one feels that Taylor couldn’t
care two hoots what happens to the
unfortunate inhabitants of the regions.
His jeers and sneers are excessive, fre-
quently pointless, and without charity.
The present book is a collection of
chapters in honor of his sixtieth birth-
day. The range is wide and the selection
is very good indeed. My favorites are
Isaiah Berlin’s chapter on Sir Lewis
Namier, and Joll’s piece on the relation
between Walter Rathenau and Maxi-
milian Harden. Both deal with an
almost extinct species of Jewish intel-
lectual: Right-wing, conservative, bril-
liant, fearless, and radical, with strong-
traces of Jewish self-hatred. This type
of Jew was prominent in pre-1914
Austria and Germany. Namier was a


sort of accidental carry-over of the type
to England. It would be interesting to
watch for parallels of the type among
American Jewish intellectuals and see
how he fares, since there may be some
truth in the old platitude that those
who do not learn from history are
condemned to repeat it.
Liddell Hart writes with his usual
competence on pre-1914 French mili-
tary doctrine of “attack to the utmost,”
and repeats his now 7 celebrated demon-
stration of its futility. One cannot help
feeling, however, that there is something
sound in the notion that “the offensive
spirit” is the right one. The basic
blunder of the French doctrinaires of
the offensive was to mistake a sound
strategic principle for a generalisation
concerning tactics. If you replace
“attack” with “initiative” the doctrine
cannot be faulted. Yet if you misinter-
pret “initiative” as “always attack” and
treat the latter as a generalisation con-
cerning tactics you are in for the French
debacle of 1914. It is almost a truism
to say that those who are determined
to shape events will always defeat those
who have made it their principle not
to cross bridges before they come to
them, since they usually find that the
bridge has been blown up. The book
is introduced by Lord Beaverbrook, a
fan of Taylor’s. It seems that Beaver-
brook had one virtue unique among
English Press lords: he could write.
National image?
By JOHN CARGHER
Singers of Australia. Barbara and
Findlay Mackenzie. Lansdowne Press.
$lO.OO.
THIS IS A MOST useful volume for
anyone interested in Australia, Aus-
tralians, and singers, in that order. The
authors are two Americans, the hus-
band being Australian-born, and their
book has all the faults of the usual
popular American “scientific” publica-
tion. It is crammed with an incredible
conglomeration of facts which are offset
to some extent by slipshod presentation,
omission of much basic information,
and a lack of ability to write clearly
and in chronological order. Oddly
enough, the authors have invited
Ronald Campbell to write an appendix
of almost book length in itself, which
is entitled “The Musical Background,”
and covers most of the authors’ own
story in greater detail, with greater
brevity and clarity, adding also much
valuable background and a wealth of
additional facts which at times clash
with those stated earlier in the book.
Mr. Campbell’s appendix is a model
the authors might well have followed
themselves.
The basic fallacy of the book is
revealed in the preface, which declares
that Australian singers have “a kind of
national character which is quite dis-
tinctive.” This implies that it is pos-
sible to identify an Australian singer
by his or her technique or voice pro-
duction. A quick glance through the
singers represented shows the immedi-
ate falseness of such an assumption.
Can there be any greater contrast than
between Melba, Austral, and Suther-
land, the three most famous voices and
all three sopranos? Let us not fool our-
selves, there is no such thing as an
Australian voice, an Australian style,
or even an Australian tradition. Aus-
tralia is a country of many races, as
the United States was a hundred years
ago. The so-called characteristic “jaw-
line,” which is quoted, can be found
in singers of all nationalities; it happens
to be a valuable part of the complicated
voice mechanism, which extends far
beyond the vocal cords. Most of the
singers in the book are first-to third-
generation Australians; it is not possible
to develop a characteristic jawline in
such a short period.
Negating the authors’ half-hearted
attempts to create a national image
for their singers, we are left with a
beautifully presented, bound, and illus-
trated collection of biographies with
a very strong leaning toward the parish
pump and the fan magazine. The pat-
tern is set from the start when the
authors declare the impossibility of
giving acknowledgement to all who
have contributed and then proceed to
list several hundred names and detailed
credits covering three pages. There are
endless quotations and cross references
which will be a joy to any researcher
of the subject. If a copy of this book
is sold to every living person men-
tioned, Lansdowne Press will make
a fortune. No doubt it will gain a
large circulation and become a stan-
dard work of reference.
How distressing then to find omitted
many elementary facts which can be
found in standard reference books.
The birth dates of Joan Sutherland
(1926), Marjorie Lawrence (1909),
Elsie Morison (1924), and many others
are missing. Singers like Browning
Mummery, who is certainly not unim-
portant, are dismissed with a few lines
plus a vague personal reminiscence,
while others are given undue promin-
ence, presumably on the basis of data
supplied by themselves. There are two
and a half pages devoted to one lady’s
attempt to gain credit by listing the
promises made to her by Melba, includ-
ing the delightful statement that Melba
wanted her to sing Lucia, but that
Toti dal Monte had priority. Instead
the lady was admitted to all the per-
formances free! This is hardly the
kind of stuff reference books are made
of. Quoting extensively from news-
paper reviews by unidentified critics
in unnamed papers and often anony-
mous cities and even countries, every
singer quickly becomes a world star
and all sense of proportion is lost.
Complete omissions are happily few,
but in the light of some other inclu-
sions space might have been found for
Molly de Gunst, Halinka de Tarczyn-
ska, Glenda Raymond, Donald Smith,
and quite a few others.
In view of the magnificent presenta-
tion and undoubted diligence employed
to assemble these 309 large pages of
facts, laced with blessedly few fancies,
it may be ungracious to carp. After
all, Harold Rosenthal, who is the most
prolific author in this field, wrote a
much worse book, “Great Singers of
Today,” though he had a much more
interesting choice, not being restricted
to one country. Appropriately, it is Mr.
Rosenthal who writes the foreword for
the Mackenzies and produces the
grossest exaggeration of the book:
“Most of the leading opera houses of
the world would, if not actually forced
to close their doors, be very hard put
to perform certain operas if it were
not for the existence of Australian
singers.” Poppycock, Mr. Rosenthal!
Let us not paint a very beautiful lily,
it really isn’t necessary. Australia has
produced possibly the highest propor-
tion of fine singers in relation to popu-
lation of any country. The Melbas
and Sutherlands of the future are all
around us and their careers can only
be harmed by statements such as
these.
Love-legend
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Froth on the Daydream. Boris Vian.
Rapp and Carroll. $3.85.
THIS FIRST English edition of a
book by Boris Vian is a major literary
event but it will probably pass by
almost unnoticed here. There seems to
be some strange reluctance by our read-
ing public to come to grips with the
most powerful group of novelists of
our times the contemporary French.
The censors have virtually put Genet
out of reach, the “new novelists” like
Nathalie Sarraute they find difficult to
read if they find her at all while
her satellites, Robbe-Grillet and Mar-
guerite Duras, are better known for
their film scripts (“Last Year at
Marienbad” and “Hiroshima mon
Amour”).
“Froth on the Daydream” is essen-
tially a story of youth, a view of life
snatched from a spinning, tilted, crazily
whirling top. It is a love-legend to take
its place among the great; not quite
Romeo and Juliet (because they, at
least, had the fulfilment of dying to-
gether), not quite Pelleas and Meli-
sande because Vian’s couple, Colin and
Chloe, are deliriously, happily married.
What puts an end to their idyll is the
sudden onslaught of illness, symbolised
by a water-lily growing in Chloe’s
lung, and at the end the desolate
agony of separation in death. Hurry,
hurry, live and make love, the author


seems to be urging, for the day before
tomorrow we die.
Everything about the actual writing
is deliberately distorted to strip away
ordinary exteriors; the conventional,
misleading commonplace trappings are
gone; words are used much as a modern
painter uses brush strokes to get
under the skin of reality. Some of it is
almost zany Carnaby Street (where, in-
cidentally, Stanley Chapman actually
completed his first-rate translation),
especially the joyous beginning. In this
way Vian’s philosophy comes clearly
across: only two things matter in life
love and music (for him, trad, jazz),
and everything else is ugly, worthless,
and senseless.
He attacks these last three ungraces
throughout the novel. Among them he
seems to place the cult of one Jean
Pulse Heartre and the Countess Thigh-
bone de Mauvoir (no doubt Sartre and
Simone de Beauvoir), cannibal factories
that eat workers; the pretentious abra-
cadabra of “ffroyddian” cookery
wizards (stilettoed eel with a sauce of
creamed mangoes and juniper berries
and a chord in G major), the precious-
ness of interior desecrators, tasteless
advertising, tortured flower arrange-
ments, and so on, right down to madly
way-out materials.
As the first unnoticed cloud of death
flits briefly over the lovers, the world
itself begins to change around them,
the house walls close in, the ceiling
comes down, the sunlight recedes from
the carpet. The style changes accord-
ingly, jokes and spoonerisms give way
to the sense of creeping decay until it
all culminates in a conversation between
Colin and the wooden figure of Jesus
hanging on the Cross that comes as
near to sacrilege as anything by
Gunter Grass.
“Froth on the Daydream” could be
an excellent introduction to anyone who
has not yet come to grips with the
modern French.
Seven years later
By THOMAS SHAPCOTT
Under standings. Evan Jones. Mel-
bourne University Press. Cloth $3.25,
paper $1.85.
IT IS GOOD to have a second col-
lection of poems from Evan Jones,
whose first volume, “Inside the Whale”
(1960), though overloaded with student
work, contained one or two poems
which have exerted a considerable in-
fluence on subsequent developments in
Australian poetry. “Understandings” is,
not surprisingly, a much more assured
volume, exploring themes of personal
disillusion and self-reproach with con-
siderable subtlety and tension
“walking the tightrope of passion and
detachment” with (to the alert reader)
quite striking effectiveness:
At night I hear the light switch off
next door,
The bed creak and the cough and
the nose blown,
Feet up and down the corridor, the
drone
Of distant voices: and I settle down.
That’s why we like it, that’s what
we’re here for:
Nobody feels at night that he’s alone.
The bitterness is implicit; the anguish
hangs, unsaid, like a personal shadow
over the mind.
Such an approach can run the danger
of becoming, in a total collection,
smudged and blurred into a general
drabness or lack of energy. Evan Jones
has worked to avoid this through an
interesting use of varied verse forms,
ranging from the short quatrain,
through lyric and sestina, to the long
narrative, and he has maintained a cer-
tain diversity of subject matter. His
actual utilisation of language, however
—his attitude to words and their poten-
tial as communicative instruments—re-
mains curiously limited.
There is little imaginative leaping-
out to discovery in this work, and the
collection, finally, cannot avoid the
charge of a certain repetitiveness. It is
this verbal conservatism which mars
the long narrative “A Dream of Barri-
cades” as much as an obvious long-
windedness. “A Dream of Barricades,”
nevertheless, cannot be dismissed out of
hand it is certain Evan Jones learned
much from attempting its composition,
and we can gain much from a study
of his exercise. The ending of the poem
is still enormously moving and effective.
The short poem “1956:1966,” also about
Hungary, makes the essential point
more stringently than the earlier long
poem.
If Jones lacks an exploring ear, he
does not lack the intelligence or pre-
cision to make strong and terse “under-
standings” of himself and his human
failings and preoccupations. In “A
Ruined Place” he generates a delicate
counterpoint of reproach and self-
reproach which achieves a final impact
of considerable honesty, even brutality,
behind the apparent dispassion of the
comment:
Old songs upon an old piano; here
We breakfasted and dined and took
our time.
And now I search the abandoned
rooms for where
Betrayal grew, the spawn of every
crime.
And in another stanza:
Going away, I guess that weathers
tame
What’s less than human, till their
will is done.
Should I return, I think you’d have
become
Bare desolation in the bright be-
wildered sun.
It is the implicit parallel between the
“I” and the “you” of the poem that
transforms it from a rather nasty self-
righteousness to a deep personal self-
examination.
When the poems about the author’s
personal dilemmas are successfully
balanced between the extremes of de-
tachment (one’s image in the mirror)
and involvement (eyes tight shut), they
have a genuine communicativeness that
is stringent but cleansing.
Children's world
By VIVIAN SMITH
Birds. Judith Wright. Angus & Robert-
son. $2.50.
Songs For All Seasons. Rosemary Dob-
son. Angus & Robertson. $2.75.
“BIRDS” RECEIVED very little atten-
tion when it appeared in 1962. This
new edition, beautifully illustrated by
Annette Macarthur-Onslow, should
win it the recognition it deserves.
“Birds” was originally written by Judith
Wright for her daughter, but, as so
often happens with a genuinely creative
writer, poems originally intended for
a specific audience take on the values
of the art as a whole, and while we
might agree that “Swamp Pheasant”
and the charming “Wagtail” are appro-
priately lightweight, others, such as
“Dotterel,” “Black Cockatoos,” and
“Satin Bower Birds,” belong with
Judith Wright’s very best work. Only a
fine craftsman can write with the
adroitness Judith Wright achieves in
some of these pieces, and the technical
assurance of work like “Night Herons”
and “Lyrebirds” is too easily over-
looked:
Face after face, the windows
flowered with eyes.
It was like a long fuse lighted,
the news travelling.
No one called out loudly;
everyone said, “Hush.”
The light deepened: the wet road
answered in daffodil colors,
And down its centre
Walked the two tall herons.
Judith Wright’s poetry has always
been suffused with the values of natural
piety, and “Birds” involves a search for
a finer understanding of what is in-
volved in “the reverence of the heart,”
which some of her dying, half-extinct
and fabulous creatures inhabit.
Rosemary Dobson has compiled her
collection of 100 poems for young
people in the belief that it is very im-
portant for them to read poetry, look
at pictures, or listen to music made by
people who are living in their own
time, “for these artists create in their
work a vision of the world that the
children know.” Her selection ranges
from Paterson’s fine “The Travelling
Post Office” to pieces by Kenneth
Slessor, Elizabeth Riddell, and about 60
other leading Australian writers. All
have a vitality that should make them
accessible to young readers.


MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Some food
for thoughts
at Christmas
THERE IS NO better substitute for
Christmas cards than cookbooks. You
might even do yourself some good by
improving the cuisine on offer next
time you’re invited out to dinner!
I have lately received “The Ameri-
can Celebrity Cookbook” (Ure Smith,
$2.50), which lists the favorite recipes
of people like Mrs. Lyndon Johnson,
Yehudi Menuhin, Jacqueline Kennedy
(waffles!), Gypsy Rose Lee, Dean
Martin, etc. It is an ideal gift for
people who want (or need) to know
Gene Kelly’s version of Coq au Vin,
Dean Martin’s Burgers (strictly on the
rocks) or three different recipes of
Beef Stroganoff, all as eaten by dif-
ferent “personalities.” It is amusingly
printed, reproducing copies of the
original letters addressed to Dinah
Shore (who ostensibly compiled this
book); sometimes even in almost illeg-
ible handwriting. There’s a mushroom
thing by Irma Huxley I want to try —
when I decipher it.
But the recipe I like best of all is
at the end of the book: “Thank you
for the offer to publish my favorite
recipe, but there is one problem. I
don’t cook! Boiling water for coffee
just doesn’t require a recipe.” (Sandy
Koufax, a top baseball pitcher, I’m
told.) You might do better, and cer-
tainly perform a better Christmas act,
by sending 50c to The Peter Pan Com-
mittee for a copy of their cookbook.
And you’ll know the hostess with the
mostest on the stove.
A cookbook by another American is
a completely different story. “The Gar-
rulous Gourmet,” by William Wallace
Irwin (Ure Smith, at the bargain price
of $1.25), is a book not to be missed by
man or woman. It is not only enter-
taining but good.
This is not a conventional book about
cooking. The writer is a spare-time
cook and a lifetime bon vivant. Like
Ted Maloney (who “translated” the
book at the author’s request), he is
married to a French girl. He has also
lived in Europe for many years. It is
here that he takes you in a most enter-
taining way. And if the reader is not
a cook upon opening the book, I’ll per-
sonally guarantee that he certainly will
be tempted at least to try some of the
suggestions Mr. Irwin makes so well.
To show you how easy some of his
culinary ideas are, I quote only one
recipe the rest you should read for
yourself.
Peche Borgia. Mash enough of the
flesh of ripe peaches to half fill a table
glass. Crack open two peach stones and
add the well crushed kernels before
filling the glass with sherry. After the
mixture has reposed for a day in the
refrigerator don’t forget to keep it
covered strain and pour the per-
fume over the bowl of sliced and
sugared peaches. He adds the rider that
you should blush modestly when the
family begin to state what they think
of the flavor.
Two Penguin cookbooks by Len
Deighton ($l.BO each, in a neat box)
would be my choice for enthusiastic but
amateur cooks.
Better known as the author of “The
Ipcress File” and “Funeral in Berlin,’
Deighton began his “cookstrips” in the
London “Observer” three years ago.
Although he barely assumes that his
reader knows where his mouth is at the
outset of a strip, he never appears to
be wasting time going over old ground.
“Action Cook Book” is one of them.
In three or four frames he puts the
recipe, so to speak, in the proverbial
nutshell. The simple drawings assemble
the ingredients and show the manner
in which they are combined. To make
the book even more informative, a text
has been added which provides endless
helpful suggestions in planning either
a simple meal or a dinner party par
excellence. On page 236 he gives the
recipe for Roman Coffee Cream, which
I tried myself on ten unexpected guests.
It took precisely five minutes to prepare
and the guests a little less time to de-
vour it. And all of us can thoroughly
recommend it.
You need 4 tablespoons of castor
sugar, 1 tablespoon of instant coffee, 4
tablespoons of whipping cream,
of ricotta cheese, and 1 tablespoon of
cognac. Beat the whole lot together in
a mixer and fill individual glasses. Chill
for at least one hour. (I was a bit more
generous with the grog and decor-
ated the tops of my glasses with whip-
ped cream and whole strawberries.)
“Ou Est le Garlic” is Mr. Deighton’s
French cookbook. And very good it
is, too. It begins with an introduction to
Fart culinaire, the dissection of the
beast you are planning to cut up, the
manner in which to chop the vege-
tables, the tools with which to do so
and ends by giving and showing a
whole host of good recipes in sound
basic terms.
If you are looking for a recipe book
for someone who already has a host
of them, it will have to fill a special
void. I would suggest “The Penguin
Book of Herbs and Spices,” by Rose-
mary Hemphill (80c). In this book
the author discusses her subject from
the start: from history and traditions
to how to grow and use them. And
makes all the information good reading,
with the addition of some unusual
recipes.

Reviewing a wine book
Your reviewer of “The Wines of Aus-
tralia,” (8., Nov. 11) in his diligent
search for errors, has himself slipped
into mistakes that I regard as more
culpable than any there may be in the
book. We can all make an honest mis-
take, But misrepresentation is some-
thing different.
For example, your reviewer empha-
sises that Kirkton Chablis today is not
a Hunter River wine. This, in a list
of so-called errors, can only be read
as a correction of something in the
book. There could be no point in it
otherwise. But, unfortunately, it’s a cor-
rection of something the book doesn’t
say! In fact, the book says, not once
but twice (in the text on page 28, and
repeated in the introduction on page
6) that “Lindemans elsewhere still pro-
duce today a very good Chablis that
they label Kirkton.” The word “else-
where” doesn’t mean the Hunter Valley,
and no amount of juggling can make it
so.
Again, your reviewer says: “I haven’t
seen any wooden vats used for making
wine in the new Mount Pleasant winery,
and neither has the McWilliams I
checked with.” Once more, it’s a denial
of something the book doesn’t say!
What the book says clearly, on page 41,
is that when the McWilliams built a
modern winery of stainless steel and
concrete vats, they also put into the
new building the old wooden vats that
Maurice O’Shea used to make his fam-
ous red wines. So far as I know, it has
never been suggested anywhere (and
least of all in this book) that the Mc-
Williams family put the old vats in to
compete in some curious way with the
much more efficient and expensive
equipment they installed in their new
winery. I don’t think the wooden vats
have ever been used for wine-making
and probably never will be. But they
are a nice reminder, a significant seg-
ment of history, perpetuating the name
of one of Australia’s greatest wine mak-
ers. Your reviewer must have known
this as well as I knew it when I wrote
the book.
Another strange statement by your
reviewer is that Hardy’s label, Cabinet
Claret, has nothing to do with Cabernet.
If he cares to check, I think he will
find that it has. It is a blend, of
course, but has enough of the Cabernet
grape in it to justify the label, with-
out claiming that it is a straight
Cabernet. In their current promotion,
Hardys confirm this by saying: “It
shows rather more Cabernet style than
many of the other well-known reds.”
Whether, your reviewer asserts,


Hardy’s St. Thomas Burgundy “is no
longer full-bodied,” this can, at best, be
only a subjective judgment, hardly
capable of objective proof. But it is
interesting, perhaps, that Hardys them-
selves, in their current publicity, des-
cribe it as “a full-bodied, smooth wine,”
though “not nearly as big a wine as
was the conventional style of Australian
burgundy a few years ago.”
If I could repeat your reviewer:
I could go on, and I won’t —except to
suggest that a book reviewer, before he
charges an author with inaccuracy,
should first make certain that his own
assertions are accurate.
A couple of final points: what is
one to think of a reviewer brash enough
to misrepresent “The Wines of Aus-
tralia” and in the same review to pro-
mote his own book on the same sub-
ject as superior? And, a little later,
brash enough to say of “The Wines of
Australia”: “Then what about literary
merit? I am not qualified to judge on
that score.” As he is not so qualified,
I submit he should not be reviewing
books.

Civil Liberties in Queensland
I note with interest a statement by
Mr. Brian Laver, spokesman for the
Civil Liberties Co-ordinating Commit-
tee, as quoted in “Queensland’s fight to
the finish” (8., Nov. 18), to the effect
that “the University Union has spon-
sored our entire campaign, which will
continue at the start of first term next
year.” In fact, the support of the Uni-
versity of Queensland Union has ex-
tended no further than mere endorse-
ment, as is evident from a recent
motion passed by the Union executive
which resolved that “the University of
Queensland Union Council endorse the
summer campaign for Civil Liberties
upon the condition that the Union’s
executive be given full and prior in-
formation on any developments, pub-
licity, and administration which are
entailed in the organisation of the
campaign.”
Sponsorship of the Summer Cam-
paign for Civil Liberties implies com-
plete legal, financial, and moral re-
sponsibility, three factors which the
Union in no way intends to bear. On
the other hand, the Union’s endorse-
ment remains as an acceptance in
principle of the aims of the Summer
Campaign.
Many members of the Union, includ-
ing myself, in no way condone arrogant
statements of the sort attributed to Mr.
Laver, which are predominantly con-
cerned with a call for militant action
-—“that if we don’t get what we want,
then there will have to be another
march.” It is statements such as these
that the more moderate persons con-
nected with the overall campaign for
Civil Liberties in the State of Queens-
land feel are detrimental to the cause
for reason of the resentment and
animosity which they produce in the
minds of both the Government and the
public.
It is my personal belief that very
rarely are iniquitous situations set right
by mob agitation of this type and it is
only constructive, rational negotiation,
accompanied by close scrutiny of sus-
pect legislation in high courts of law
which will effect any change in the cur-
rent dismal state of Civil Liberties in
Queensland.

Marching into the past
In the article referring to the Surf Life
Saving Association (8., Dec. 2) your
reporter has gone out of his way to
ridicule the Surf Life Saving move-
ment.
When asked some weeks ago to give
an interview to a Bulletin representa-
tive, I agreed. I assumed wrongly that
a responsible member of your staff
would see me. The interview was on a
friendly basis, as he stated that it
seemed to be an appropriate time to
write on the Association’s 6Cth year of
service to the community. Having fur-
nished him with statistics, such as
156,030 recorded rescues from the surf
(which, of course, was not mentioned
in the article), he has:
1. Put words in inverted commas
which were not used by me.
2. Quoted words completely div-
orced from their context.
3. Misstated facts.
I would like to think that no other
humanitarian or charitable institute
will ever in the future be trapped into
giving interviews to such irresponsible
reporters. I would also like to think
that at least 156,030 people will not
agree with your article.

The nurses
Following a meeting on November 24,
the members of the Council of The
Institute of Hospital Matrons of N.S.W.
and A.C.T. have asked me to write
and express their concern and disap-
pointment with your publication of the
article “What is the Nurses’ Future?”
(B., Nov. 18).
We feel it can do nothing but dis-
service to the nursing profession and
the community to which it seeks to give
good service.

President, the Institute of Hospital
Matrons of N.S.W. and A.CT.

Mr. Colwell's policies
I was interested to read Observer’s
Comments (8., Dec. 2) to the effect
that “When Holt first came into
office . . . Mr. Calwell was busy hack-
ing away at the Labor Party’s throat
by putting up antediluvian policies that
were an affront to the traditions deeply
held by the Australian people.”
Mr. Calwell’s main concern was that
Australians were helping to butcher
Vietnamese men, women, and children
in a war which is not only immoral
but has no pretence of legality. It is
now quite obvious that the so called
“Viet Cong” not only control the
bulk of the people of the southern half
of Vietnam but they actually represent
them.
Mr. Calwell also observed that we
were playing a leading role in the crea-
tion of World War 111 a prophecy
now practically fulfilled. Hence he
maintained that we should cease this
lawless and stupid foreign adventure,
and in view of its obvious importance
he made this, quite rightly, the major
plank in his platform.
If the advocacy of a return to sanity
and international law is indeed an
“affront to our traditions,” then we as
a nation have completed with extra-
ordinary speed our descent into a state
of barbarity, the nature of which makes
the darkest days of the Inquisition seem
sunny by comparison.

Shocking Britain
Your stern words about my country,
Britain, in Observer’s Comment (8.,
Nov. 25) contained salutary truth. I
realise we do need to be “shocked
back into our wits.” Fortunately, signs
are not lacking that many Britons feel
this and are doing something about
it.
It’s too bad that the “mini”-misers
(advocates of British retreat in will and
spirit from the world), the “me-
firsters,” inefficient managers, and class-
warmongers get publicity while honest
workers on both sides of industry sel-
dom do.
While, for instance, the headlines
proclaim news of U.K. dock strikes,
actually 75 percent of British port-
workers are happily working the new
decasualisation scheme. (This was an-
nounced by the chairman of the Port
Employers.)
Credit is due to the sane leadership
given by some rank-and-file dockers.
Thus grievances which could have led
to stoppages have been cured instead of
being exploited and ports have re-
mained operational.
If that spirit could get publicity, it
might spread, and Britain (in or out of
the Market) might rise from her pres-
ent economic and spiritual slough to
play the constructive part in the world
which the majority of Australians, I
believe, want to see her play.
