THE RED PAGE.
There are grounds for believing that Oliver
Twist was an Australian whom Mr. Bumble
caught while he was very young. At all
events the Australian, so far as The Bulle-
tin knows him, is in the habit of asking for
“ More ! ” and if he does not get it for ask-
ing he seems determined to get it by shout-
ing. So a recent printing of Joaquin
Miller’s “Columbus'’ has brought not only
corrections from Australians who knew it
in another guise as “The Port of Ships,” or
vice versa ; but also requests for more poetry
by Miller, and more information regarding
him.
* m * *
“ Joaquin ” Miller is really Gincinhatus
Hiner Miller, born in Indiana, U.S.A., in
1841. When Cincinnatus Hiner grew to an
age at which his Ego clamored for expression,
and decided to express it in verse, he found
Cin. Hi. Miller unpoetical, and dubbed him-
self romantic Joaquin. The incident is a
keynote to the man. Joaquin Miller—he
should be so called since he wishes to be so
called—either has more Ego to the square
inch of epidermis than the average poet, or
he has more courage to let his Ego out. His
book of poems is a book of postures ; and the
latest news of the poet himself says that tir-
ing of his residence on “The Hights ” over-
looking San Francisco, he has descended to the
variety stage, and is exhibited nightly to the
American commonalty as he was Exhibited
to the English gentry in 1870, when his long
hair and his poems and his horsemanship
contributed equally to make him the lion of
a London season or two. These remarks
are not necessarily depreciatory, since
when one has a clamorous Ego it is
much better to let it out to run
about and play than to keep it in
to pine. Suppressed Ego is as bad for the
constitution as suppressed Measles ; and just
as it is the custom, in a case of Measles, to
give the patient plenty of cooling drinks in
order to bring his spots out, so it should be
the custom, in a case of Ego, for the
sufferer’s friends to supply a liberal quantity
of liquid refreshment in order to overcome
any lingering internal shyness. These
drinks may be charged to Poetry, or Charity,
or any abstract virtue.
* * • *
Joaquin Miller’s Ego comes out naturally
in his “Complete Poetical Works,” and
apart from the poetry it is an interesting
identity. The author prints seven portraits
of himself at various stages of his career at
the beginning of the volume, and a picture
of “ The Hights ” where he lived before
going to the variety entertainment; and
another large portrait at an eighth stage
comes at the end of the book by way of
bonne-bouche. There is prose at the begin-
ning, prose at the end, and prose all„
through as notes to the poems. Whit-
man’s “Leaves of Grass” preface seems to
have suggested some of the prose, which is,
as a rule, very readable indeed, and often
eloquent. Miller’s parents brought him,
as a boy, across the continent. When
he reached Oregon, he received a good
schooling, and at twenty plunged into the
adventurous frontier life of the sixties. For
ten years he was mining, mail-carrying,
fighting Indians, breaking brumbies ; and in
1870 he turned up in London with his book
of verses and became at once notorious,'
almost famous. He was taken up by
Lord Houghton, became acquainted with
Browning and Rossetti, and rode and
wrote till his eyes failed and family
trouble recalled him to America. But he
came back to Europe thrice, his popularity
gradually waning (his verse had never de-
served the disproportionate gush of en-
thusiasm which greeted it), and finally
settled in the Californian home where he
has for years been revered as a seer and
ridiculed as an egotistic oddity. Latterly a
quaint band of students and loafers has
gathered round him, and he has expounded
the gospel of Miller to a small but attentive
audience. There seems to be much in his
personality to love and admire, and many
brave acts and kind ones are recorded to his
credit.
* * * *
“The Sea of Fire” is perhaps the best
example of Miller’s matured talent : it is cer-
tainly a characteristic example. Nothing
quite so gorgeous, so tropical, so aflame with
colour, can be found beyond the author’s
volume. It is a firework Vesuvius of
phrases.
The story is of “ a far white land ” in the
Spanish main. Indians rose and massacred
a Spanish ship’s crew, but spared the pirati-
cal Don’s daughter, who grew to be a pure
marvel of womanhood, innocent of men.
Only some fragments can be quoted.
How beautiful she was ! Why, she
Was inspiration ! She was born
To walk God’s sunlit hills at morn,
Nor waste her by this wood-dark sea ;
What wonder, then, her soul’s white wings
Beat at its bars, like living things !
How proud she was ! How darkly fair !
How full of faith, of love, of strength !
Her calm, proud eyes ! Her great hair’s length,—
Her long, strong, tumbled, careless hair,
Half curled and knotted anywhere,—
By bi’ow or breast, or cheek or chin,
For love to trip or tangle in !
And Eden having been decked, and Eve
prepared, it i.s time for Adam.
At last a tall strange sail was seen :
It came so slow, so wearily,
Came creeping cautious up the sea,
As if it crept from out between
The half-closed sea and sky that lay
Tight wedged together, far away.
Eve watches anxiously ; and the author
balances between the ship and the lady with
a fine technical device :
The ship crept silent, up the sea,
And came
You cannot understand
How fair she was, how sudden she
Had sprung, full-grown, to womanhood ;
How gracious, yet how proud and grand )
How glorified, yet fresh and free,
How human, yet how more than good.
The ship stole slowly, slowly on
Should you in Californian field
In ample flower-time behold
The soft south rose lift like a shield
Against the sudden sun at dawn,
A double handful of heaped gold,
Why you, perhaps, might understand
How splendid and how queenly she
Uprose beside that wood-set sea.
The storm-worn ship scarce seemed to creep
From wave to wave. It scarce could keep—
How still this fair girl stood, how fair !
How tall her presence as she stood
Between that vast sea and west wood !
How large and liberal her soul,
How confident, how purely chare,
How trusting; how untried the whole
Great heart, grand faith, that blossomed there !
Ay, she was as Madonna to
The tawny, lawless, faithful few
Who touched her hand and knew her soul :
She drew them, drew them as the pole
Points all things to itself.
She drew
Men'upward as a moon of spring
High wheeling, vast and bosom-full,
Half clad in clouds and white as wool,
Draws all the strong seas following.
Yet still she moved as sad, as lone
As that same moon that leans above,
And seems to search high heaven through
For some strong, all sufficient love,
For one brave love to be her own,
Be all her own and ever true.
Has not Eve a splendour of ushering
adjectives—a royal progress to the coming
Fate ! When the ship comes to shore,
Eve meets captain Adam—“a Hercules
among his men.”
Two strong streams of a land must run
Together surely as the sun
Succeeds the moon. Who shall gainsay
The gods that reign, that wisely reign ?
Love is, love was, shall be again.
Like death, inevitable it is,<;
Perchance, like death, the dawn of bliss.
Let us, then, love the perfect day,
The twelve o’clock of life, and stop
The two hands pointing to the top,
And hold them tightly while we may.
He spake of love, of boundless love,—
Of love that knew no other land,
Or face, or place, or anything;
Of love that like the wearied dove
Could light nowhere, but kept the wing
Till she alone put forth her hand
And so received it in the ark
From seas that shake against the dark !
Her proud breast heaved, her pure, bare breast
Rose like the waves in their unrest 1
When counter storms possess the seas.
Her mouth, her arch, uplifted mouth,
Her ardent mouth that thirsted so,—
No glowing love song of the South
Can say ; no man can say or know
Such truth as lies beneath such trees . . .
Her soul surged vast as space is. She
Was trembling as a courser when
His thin flank quivers, and his feet
Touch velvet on the turf, and he
Is all afoam, alert and fleet
As sunlight glancing on the sea,
And full of triumph before men. . . .
The winds breathed warm as Araby;
She leaned upon his breast, she lay
A wide-winged swan with folded wing.
He drowned his hot face in her hair,
He heard her great heart rise and sing;
He felt her bosom swell.
The air
Swooned sweet with perfume of her form.
Her breast was warm, her breath was warm,
And warm her warm and perfumed mouth
As summer journeys though the south.
Then al minis arid incursions ! Perhaps
it was time ; for the ecstasy of language be-
gins to cloy. The woods take fire, and flame
furiously. Miller suggests that a crazed hag
lit them, or tlie gray Indian priest fearing
the crew might discover his sacred hoard.
There is no suggestion that they were heated
beyond endurance by the warmth of his
lovers or of his language. But he pictures
the conflagration brilliantly.
The sun, outdone, lay down. He lay
In seas of blood. He sinking drew
The gates of sunset sudden to,
And they in shattered fragments lay.
Then night came, moving in mad flame;
Then full Night, lighted as he came,
As lighted by high summer sun
Descending through the burning blue.
It was a gold and amber hue,
Aye, all hues blended into one.
The moon came on, came leaning low.
The moon spilled splendour where she came,
And filled the world with yellow flame
Along the far sea-isles aglow ;
She fell along that amber flood,
A silver flame in seas of blood.
It was the strangest moon, ah me !
That ever settled on God’s sea.
There is the frenzied flight of animals—
how truly depicted anyone who has known
our own bush tires will know.
Slim snakes slid down from fern and grass,
From wood, from fen, from anywhere ;
You could not step, you would not pass,
And you would hesitate to stir,
Lest in some sudden, hurried tread
Your foot struck some unbruistd head.
It seemed like some infernal dream ;
They slid in streams into the stream ;
They curved, arid sinuous curved across,
Like living streams of living moss—
There is no art of man can make
A ripple like a living snake !
The lovers are caught between the fire and
the cliif.
Encompassed, lorn, the lovers stood,
Al dpried there, death in the air-!
Ti at >eetling steep, that blazing wood—
Rt u fl.une ! red flame, and everywhere 1 . . .
He clasped her close, he spoke of death,—
Of death and love in the same breath.
He clasped her close ; her bosom lay
Like ship safe anchored in some hay
Where never rage or rack of main
Might even shako her anchor chain.
And then Miller broaches a subtle point of
religion or chivalry which defies the puzzling
wit. There is a path of safety to the priest’s
white isle, and the priest stands waving a
golden cross. But Adam will not go—“he
would not give her up ! ” It is nowhere
indicated why he would have to give her up
if they claimed sanctuary ; but the author
regards the sacrifice of love as essential to
the salvation of life. Then there is a really
fine apostrophe, with the motive of our own
Daley’s “Passion Flower.”
O man, be glad ! be grandly glad
And king-like walk thy ways of death !
For more than years of bliss you had
That one brief time you breathed her breath;
Yea, more than years upon a throne
That one brief time you held her fast,
Soul surged to soul, vehement, vast, —
True breast to breast, and all your own.
Live me one day, one narrow night,
One second of supreme delight
Like that, and I will blow like chaff
The hollow years aside, and laugh
A loud triumphant laugh, and I,
King-like and crowned, will gladly die.
Oh, but to wrap my love with flame!
With flame within, with flame without!
Oh, hut to die like this, nor doubt —
To die and know her still the same !
To know that down the ghostly shore
Snow-white she walks for evermore !
The “loud triumphant laugh ” grates, and
there are minor faults of phrase ; but kweep
and climax are admirable. And the story
hastens to a close. The two stand on a
height above the sea—the flames leaping to
their ledge, leering at their side.
He leaned above the ledge. Below
He saw the black ship grope and cruise,—
A midge below, a mile below.
His limbs were knotted as the thews
Of Hercules in his death-throe.
The flame ! the flame ! the envious flame 1
She wound her arms, she wound her hair
About his tall form, grand and bare,
To stay the fierce flame where it came.
The black ship, like some moonlit wreok,
Below along the burning sea,
Gi’oped on and on all silently,
With silent pigmies on her deck.
He holds her up—holds her high as if to
touch the sky. Her high right hand is
upheld
As if to gather stars, aud heap
The stars like torches there.to light
Her hero’s ] >atli across the deep
To some far isle that fearful night.
The envious flame one moment leapt
Enraged to see such majesty,
Such scorn of death ; such kingly scorn . . .
Then like some lightning-riven tree
They sank down in that flame —and slept.
And all night one could fancy their spirits
flaming upward—
All night! there was no night. Nay, nay,
There was no night. The night that lay
Between that awful eye and day,—
That nameless night was burned away.
So the poem closes.
Miller has not here been taken altogether
seriously ; though some of his lapses have
been slurred that lie may be taken as
seriously as one can. For example, just
before the strong idea of the lost night
clinches the impression, there is a reference
to sea-cows—the lovers’ light
Lit up the sea-cows’ bed below:
The far sea-cows still calling so
It seemed as they must, call all night.
All night ! there was no night—etc.
Now, it can hardly he denied that the sea-
cow has no business in such a gorgeous
galley. It may be too much to say the sea-
cow cannot be—taken seriously in poetry ;
though hard domestic usage has given “ cow ”
a property of humour which it is difficult .to
dodge without the assistance of “ kino,” and
in the case of “sea-cow” there is a horrid
possibility of complication with “sea-cook.”
But introduced in Miller’s verse, and in
Miller’s way, “sea-cow” is a rock for the
poem to split on—and he insists that she
shall be vocal ! The same lack of sense of
incongruity is noticeable in “ With Walker-
in Nicaragua,” which has many fine lines
and passages, and commences—
Ho was a brick : let this be said
Above my brave dishonor’d dead.
Evidently, the poet/ has much to learn who
wants a strong statement to commence a
serious poem in a high key, and finds it in
“ He was a brick.” Yet Miller is not without
humor : his lines about “ William Brown of
Oregon ” and his sweetheart who—
watched the splendid sun go down
Like some great sailing ship on fire,
Then rose and checked hey trunks right on ;
And in the ears she lunched and lunched,
And had her ticket punched and punched
Until she came to Oregon—
are proof of that; and you catch their sar-
donic twinkle in other verses. It is not lack
of relish for humour, but lack of taste, which
steers some of Miller’s best periods peril-
ously close to bathos.
* * *
The quality which prevents one from
yielding with a whole mind to most of
Miller’s verses is bis theatricality, even arti-
ficiality. Here and there lie is pure gold ;
but in a breath he is gilding, and ever and
anon you see a poor backing through the
tinsel. Even bis best .verses have too much
the look of liaiidicraltjunan’s work ; an often
first-rate method of manufacture cannot dis-
guise the lack of genuine inspiration. Miller
does not say his fine tilings spontaneously,
or does not seem so to say them. And tlnmg.i
he comes in a sweeping flood of glorious
verbiage, and even convinces you that his
heart is borne along with the flood,
the glory has an air of shallowness.
JLhie divines a weak man frothing rather than
a strong one surging. And Miller wants in-
tellectual weight: his impetuous emotions
need a backing of ideas. To call him a
rococo Byron is to give the clearest idea of
his temperament and work, yet at times he
is better than that : he seems to have almost
everything of the poet but the power of
subtly edging his poetry : he has eye, ear,
arid sentiment—even passion (a weak pas-
sion), yet his work appears lax, often turgid,
wanting smelting and refining. For an-
other comparison, he might be called a more
vivid, more magnificent Jean Ingelow. And
you trace Swinburne, Tennyson, half-a-
dozen origins. In “ Isles of the Amazons”
one has an impression of “ The Lotos
Eaters’ ” music warming to the motive of
love. And, though the images be often old,
the lines are eloquent—
The palm-trees lorded the cc&pse like kings,
Their tall tops tossing the indolent clouds
That folded the Isle in the dawn, like shrouds . ..
A bird in scarlet and gold, made mad
With sweet delights, through the branches slid
And kiss’d the lake on a drowsy lid . . .
Then the great sun died, and a rose-red bloom
Grew over his grave in a border of gold,
And a cloud with a silver-white rim was roll’d
Like a cold gray stone at the door of his tomb.
Tliis may be called merely pictorial poetry :
we ask for something more nowadays ; but
it is surely very good of its kind. And the
writer’s energy keeps him afloat through
hundreds of excellent stanzas, with every
now and again a really memorable glimpse
or cadence. If one does not ask too much of
Miller, accepting the limits of his poetic
claim, he can be read time and again with
pleasure and satisfaction. And if it be
mainly a sensuous pleasure—well, there are
times when a sensuous pleasure seems best;
one is not always keyed up to the music of
the spheres.
* * * *
And still Miller has not been justly dealt
with, for there is still account to take of the
more lyric lines which gem his narrative
verse : lines like—
What is this rest of death, sweet friend?
What is the rising up, and where ? y
I say, death is a lengthened prayer,
A longer night, a larger end.
Hear you the lesson I once learned:
I died ; I sailed a million miles
Through dreamful, flowery, restful isles—
She was not there, and I returned.
I say the shores of death and sleep
Are one; that when we, wearied, come
To Lethe’s waters, and lie dumb,
’Tis death, not sleep, holds hs to keep.
Yea, we lie dead for need of rest,
And so the soul drifts out and o’er
The vast still waters to the shore
Beyond, in pleasant, tranquil quest. . .
O Charon, keep thy sombre ships !
I come, with neither myrrh nor balm,
Nor silver piece in open palm,—
Just lone, white silence on my lips.
Or like—
The broad magnolia’s blooms were white )
Her blooms were large, as if the moon
Quite lost her way that dreamful night,
And lodged to wait the afternoon.
Oh, vast white blossoms, breathing love !
White bosom of my lady dead,
In your white heaven overhead
I look, and learn to look above.
Or like—
All ! there he souls none understand ;
Like clouds, they eamiot touch the land ;
Hnanohored ships, they blow and blow,
Sail, to and fro, and then go down
In unknown seas that none shall know,
Without one ripple of renown.
Gall these hot fools ; the test of worth
Is not the hold you have of earth.
Ay, there he gentlest souls sea-blown
That'know not any harbour known.
Now it. may he the reason is
They touch on fairer shores than this.
* * • •
As Poe and Lanier, among American
verse-writers, may be pine cl side by side by
reason of their pre-emin mee in the know-
ledge of that beautiful mystery which is
Poetry, and by reason also of the in-many-
ways-similar minds and moods and methods
with which (hey received and transmitted
the poetical message ; so Whitman and Mil-
ler, on a lower plane, may be bracketed in
respect of many qualities of temperament
and art. In both a singular crudity is often
associated with a singular charm : the work
of both takes interest, if it loses value, from
the fact that it is the characteristic ex-
pression of the man, and is so regarded
by the man ; and we find in both the same
personal vanity and love of personal
display, though Miller’s vanity be shown
in a decorative pose, Whitman’s in
a pose of simplicity, subtler and no less de-
corative. Miller, the more vivacious and
the more elegantly veneered with culture, is
the weaker,man and weaker poet; he has
neither the ample Utterance of Whitman nor
his occasional heart-uplifting leap of lan-
guage and idea. Both Whitman and Miller
instinctively extol savage virtues, turn
away from civilised shams and nullities,
and cle.'fve to the larger life and
rarer which lies at the core of human
onset and effort. Poe and Lanier are uni-
versal poets ; the minor others mostly faint
reflections of European types, following more
or less skilfully in the footsteps of Long-
fellow. Whitman and Miller in their merits
and defects are as characteristically American
poets as they can be in an amorphous nation
whose hundred different characters have not
yet fused and may never fuse in a type ad-
mitted as repieseniHUVe by al. American
constituents.

Dr. Creed, M.L.C., has had printed in

Association) of his experience of hypnosis as a
therapeutic agent. Those who are still sceptical
about the practical value of hypnotic suggestion
would do well to read this unsensation al record of
facts.

Some comments of wide application con-
cerning the efforts of the British saints to keep
the tide back with a pitchfork :
In sentencing some women charged with keeping a
disorderly house under the disguise of a massage estab-
lishment this morning, Mr. de Rutzen spoke in plain
terms of the state of things which the efforts of the vigi-
lance societies has produced in London. The words in
which he condemned these bodies are none too strong, as
anybody who knows anything of the state of the West
End at night can vouch. In their attacks on immorality
the \ igilanee societies have produced social sores infinitely
more hideous than those which.they have repressed. They
may have cleared the Haymarket, but they have made
the loathsome “bully” almost universal. The old dis-
orderly houses have been replaced by the massage-shop,
the manicure-establishment, and the electric-bath house—
places into which anybody may stray under the impres-
sion that a genuine business is carried on there. They
may have destroyed the fair in the Haymarket, but they
have made it necessary for anybody living in the West
End who takes his wife or his daughter to the theatre to
drive home through the principal thoroughfares in a
closed carriage. The record of the vigilance societies in
London is, in fact, one of failure and mischief from begin-
ning to end.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

f*ARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED in the SELECTION
V AND USE OF A FOOD FOR INFANTS ; this is a
matter of common experience, but the “ why and wherefore,”
are subjects of knowledge to the few only. In spite of the
general recognition of the immense importance of this
matter, it is one upon which a wide-spread and lamentable
ignorance prevails. There is, it is true, a growing feeling
with mothers that
FARINACEOUS FOODS

but this fact is only being learnt slowly as the result of a
dearly bought experience, which is paid by the lives of
thousands of little ones.

About Australian Wine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Though it is not easy for men whose Celtic and Teuton
ancestors drank usquebaugh and ale for a score of cen-
turies to become wine-drinkers in the space of a genera-
tion, the day is coming when the national drink Of this
country will be the wine of this country. Some little
time ago an eminent wine-expert said of a certain Aus-
tralian vintage that if kept for a hundred years it would
be the finest wine that ever bled from grape. But where
shall we be by then ? In Elysium, drinking ambrosia.
One would like to be present at a convivial gathering
held in the glorious future when the hundred-year-old
Australian wine shall be opened.
The Cardinal gave a banquet
To guests of high dc g ee ;
There sat at his princely table
A goodly company:
Men from the North, and men from the South,
And men from over sea.
A merry-eyed Moderator —
Good Presbyterian—
Sat cheek-by-jowl with a Bishop
Of orders Anglican;
And parson and priest were at the feast,
And each a Trencherman.
Their brotherly love was ruptured
By no polemic row,
And never such boon companions
Were seen before, I vow ;
The banquet’s date was, I should state,
A hundred years from now.
They ate of the lordly schnapper
That swims in waters blue ;
They ate of the rare wild turkey,
But not of the wild emu,
And supped the soup of the tail of—whoop !
The last lone kangaroo.
With many a wine of Europe
They filled their cups amain—
The red Burgundian vintage,
The golden wine of Spain,
And Rhine-wine gay, and rich Tokay,
And glittering champagne.
Like festal lamps were shin'ng
The eyes of those divines;
The Cardinal to his butler
Made cabalistic signs,
And then, full proud, he said, aloud,
“ Produce the Wine of Wines.”
“ Behold ! ” he cried, “ behold, now,
Its purple royal flow !
The grape that was its mother
Did by the Hunter grow—
It did, by the Pope, on a Hunter slope,
A hundred years ago ! ”
And then he spake right softly,
With wave of jewelled hand :
“ This wine sublime was made in
The time, serene and bland,
When days were bright and hearts were light,
And Barton ruled the land. ”
He lifted high his goblet,
That Cardinal elate;
“ We’ll drink,” he cried, “ a toast, friends,
All in this vintage great—
‘ The men of old who made the mould
Of our Australian State 1 ’ ”
Up rose the Moderator —
Good Presbyterian—
Up rose the portly Bishop
Of orders Anglican ;
Parson and priest at that great feast
They rose up a* one man,
And joining hands together—
Right potent was the wine—
And gazing at each other
With loving looks benign,
They sang and sang till the rafters rang
“ The Days of Auld Lang Syne.”

HOLIDAYS FOR THE POLICE,
in view of a certain order that has just been,
posted up at the various police stations, in pur-
suance of instructions issued by Mr. Fosbery,
Inspector-General of Police, the fears of the
police on the subject of holidays, which were
referred to in Sati>*icy's Issue, seem to have beea
well founded. *lt was thought Jthat, chiefly
owing to the instrumentality of Mr. Dacey, M.P.,
the police we«b to be given 14 days' leave each
year, qui'e independent of the day a month which,
they have been In the habit of receiving for
.years past, but the whole thing seems to be a
are and a delusion, despite the Premier s asser-
tion that he would place the police of New South
Wales on a footing as good as that of any other
country, ?o far as holidays were concerned. The
.order referred to at once dispels any idea that
might have existed in the minds of the over-
sanguine representatives of law and order, for it
makes it quite' clear that no policeman will get
more than 14 days’ leave during the year. This
leave, it Is Intimated, may be had all at once,
or it may be divided, or (if preferred) one day in
month may be had, together with an extra
qouple of days to make up the fourteen. All
of which makes somebody or other wondrous
[kind. The gigantic concession that the police
are to have in the way of leave is two days per
annum.

SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1899.
The Progress of Dreary Dickson.
As the general election approaches, Premier
Dickson wanders a little more energetically
round Bananaland, dragging behind him,
like a small, sorrowing mongrel at the end
of a string, the shapeless thing he calls his
programme. Nothing of note has happened
to either of them since last week, when The
Bulletin had the pleasure of making some
disparaging remarks about the pair; but
further acquaintance with Dreary Dickson
in his new capacity as a political chief has
done a little to accentuate his uselessness.
Yet he is such a typical Australian politician,
as Australian politicians were a very few
years ago, and his programme is so typically
Australian, as programmes went even in the
late ’Bo’s, that, after all, this country
shouldn’t altogether curse the hairless
wanderer. Australia created, and carefully
cultivated, and greatly bragged about, the
Dickson species of politician. Fifteen years
ago it would have called him a vigorous and
progressive statesman, of the kind to which
this country owed its greatness. The fact that
he is now only a scoff and a mockery, and a
pious and rather greasy house-agent, and that
he would be an utterly impossible leader in
any of the Seven Provinces, Queensland alone
excepted, only shows how public ideas have
changed in recent times. This isn’t Dick-
son’s fault. That dull old man grew him-
self at a time when there was a demand for
exactly such dull old men to govern this
country, and he didn’t know that the demand
would drop off before he was ripe. He be-
longs to the same species as Gillies and
Downer, only they got their chance while
men of their stamp were still regarded with
respect. And Dickson is the lone pterodac-
tyl or megatherium who got left—the last
superfluous fossil (for even Forrest and
Braddon belong to a brighter species), and
his case is a hard one, in a sense. Aus-
tralia doesn’t owe him a Premiership, but it
certainly does owe him an apology.
* * * *
The old Australian politician—the one
that Australia looks back on with reverence
because he is dead, and whom most of it
wouldn’t stand at any price if he were
alive went round in one unvarying
circle. His ideas were ; (1) To bor-
row a great deal of money and build
all manner of things with it so as to
open up the country and make land saleable;
(2) to bring lots of people to the country,
paying their passages with borrowed money,
so that they might occupy the land ; (3) to
sell the land as fast as possible ; (4) to bor-
row more money and build more public
works, so as to find occupation for the
superfluous immigrants that had been
brought out with the borrowed money ; and
then to bring out more immigrants so as to
keep up the demand for land ; and then to
sell more land ; and then to build more
works, so as to make another lot of land
saleable, and so on ad infinitum,. And inci-
dentally the ‘ ‘ progressive policy ” included
borrowing the money to bring more people
out so that they might help to buy the
things the previous people grew on the land;
borrowing the money to build more
railways and other works so that these
people might earn wages to buy the things
with ; borrowing money to make a temporary
artificial abundance so that the banks might
have plenty of money to lend on the security
of the land, and doing the same thing over
again so that the boom thus created might
keep up land-values when the securities
began to look sick. And if they still in-
sisted on looking sick, then the invariable
panacea was to bring out more people at the
public expense in order to brighten up the
demand again.
* * * *
Dickson, with his scheme for floating big
loans and building a lot more railways all
over Queensland, and hustling out new
crowds of immigrants, is the Australian pro-
gressive politician as that animal was 15 or
20 years ago. He has learned nothing, nor
has he forgotten anything. The loan and
railway and immigration faith is so simple
that any fool can understand it, therefore
there grew up around it a variety of politician
who was fit for it and for nothing better.
In later years Australia has begun to gradu-
ally produce statesmen of a different stamp.
These new men have an idea that it might
perhaps be better, instead of paying popula-
tion to come here, to try their hands at
making Australia a country that population
might find it worth while coming to without
payment. Also, that it should be made a
country where the average man can find
work without always having a job at build-
ing a railway with borrowed money through
a howling desert. And they have visions of
a possible period when half the population
won’t live by selling land to the other half,
the values being maintained by artificial
booms supported by the perpetual scattering
around of big loans. Land and income
taxation, the State land bank system, the
resumption of large estates for closer settle-
ment, the minimum wage, the fixing of
reasonable hours of labor, the State life-
insurance system in Maoriland and the State
fire and accident insurance system which
will follow, the State leasehold idea, the
careful fostering of new industries, the old
age pensions—they are all signs of revolt
against the old, crude, shiftless policy. The
purpose of them is to urge a community,
demoralised by the old, easy, lotus-eating
life of the big loan and boom days, to settle
down and earn its own living—to reduce the
country’s outgoings and increase its sources
of income, and to break the news to it gently
that its salvation doesn’t lie in big I O U’s
and in everybody selling vacant allotments
to everybody else on time payment.
• * » *
Queensland, however, doesn’t take its
politics seriously. They take nothing very
seriously in the dried-up North—neither
their religion, nor their drink, nor their pie-
bald community, nor their alligator, nor
their Q.N. Bank, nor anything else. Queens-
land has already introduced more immigrants
at the public cost than any other province,
New South Wales only excepted—nearly half
its population was introduced with money
borrowed on the credit of the other half ;
and things being in a woefully low state after
all this the best remedy Dreary Dickson can
suggest is that the province should go back
to the old system which helped to make
things bad, and proceed to make them worse.
It has, in proportion to population, the
Biggest Debt on Earth, and because it is
tottering under the load Dickson reckons
the brightest available idea is to make the debt
a lot bigger. It has the most piebald popula-
tion in the Seven Provinces, and it is going to
mix the population a little more. It doesn’t
propose to take a hair of the dog that bit it,
but to swallow the entire dog over again.
All the things that Dickson proposes Queens-
land has been trying since it first started
business as a separate province, and as they
have all failed to make Queensland happy
and prosperous, Dickson proposes, by way
of a great and novel inspiration, to try them
all over again.
* * * *
In a limited sense The Bulletin feels
sorry for Dickson. The miserable old rent-
collector and auctioneer knows no other
gospel than the one lie preaches. He knows
nothing of the requirements of the working
population ; a life spent in the useless occu-
pation of knocking down nothing with a
little hammer doesn’t help to widen the
sympathies, nor does it furnish a man with
a wide knowledge of any class save the small
commercial class of his own tin-pot city. He
couldn’t start a scheme of social legislation
such as Ballance inaugurated ; after the
long, anxious, narrow, illiterate years of
rent - collecting he wouldn’t know how,
even supposing he was capable of knowing
how in any case. He grew up in the days
when the whole duty of a “great ” Austra-
lian politician was to float big loans, and sell
great hunks of land to big capitalists, and
be the boss bagman of his province, and the
times have so altered, through no merit of
his, that he is almost as obsolete as the
armed Scotch cattle-stealer of the Highlands
as the Highlands were two centuries ago. In
his retrograde corner of Australia he can still
get some kind of a hearing for the old
gospel, but the vim has gone out of it. In
MTlwraith’s early days it was possible to
tell the people that the old foolish riot was
the sure road to prosperity, but after 20 years
of it has resulted in nothing but dust and
ashes it is difficult to pound the ancient
drum with the same convincing note as afore-
time. But Dickson must needs pound the
old drum, so he batters it with what little
vigor his 66 years of comparative failure
have left him. He has no other drum to
pound.
The Natural Woman.
Editor Bulletin. —People find Thekla Dub-
berke astonishing, even odious. “People”—that
is, the men who talk in streets and write in news-
papers ; not women. Thekla —that is, not an
anaemic doll with a false bang and bunions, but a
buxom young woman full of vitality, to whom the
incident of jamming a corpse into a boot-box was
but a spur to healthy appetite, and who shared a
sentimental civilisation’s horror of death so little
that the corpse’s floating brought only regret that
she had not jabbed it to let the gas out, and so
finished her work like a good artisan. She is in
many ways a girl to admire ; and I am persuaded
that her own sex regards her with interested ad-
miration. For she has lived up to Wild Woman’s
primitive ideal—the ideal which her sex is desert-
ing at the beck of Tame Man, but deserting
slowly, lingeringly, with many regretful looks and
an occasional step backward. Thekla offers an
opportunity for letting the gas out of some false
notions, and I grab it with as much zest as
Thekla grabbed the corpse.
* * * *
Anybody who knows the meaning of “ mutatis
mutandis” can get a clear understanding of
Thekla by reading “Regina,” a story by Her-
mann Sudermann, the German novelist, trans-
lated in England last year. The hero of the story
is an ordinary kind of ass-man, stuffed with the
conventional prejudices which humanity has
acquired through biting off more “ morality ”
than it can chew. The heroine is an unspoilt
female animal worth 19 dozen of the hero ; and
when he flings her away she dies serving him.
Then the author charitably assumes that the ass-
man’s eyes were opened, and—
No, she had not been a brute or a devil, but simply a
grand and complete human being. One of those perfect,
fully-developed individuals such as Nature created before
a herding social system, with its paralysing ordinances,
bungled her handiwork, when every creature was allowed
to bloom unhindered into the fulness of its power, and to
remain, in good and in evil, part and parcel of the natural
life.
And as he pondered thus, it seemed to him that the
mists which obscure the source of human existence from
human knowledge had dispersed a little, and that he had
been granted a deeper glimpse than most men into the
fathomless gulf of the Unknown. What is generally
called good and bad drifted about anchorless on the
cloudy surface; but below lay dreaming in majestic
strength, the Natural.
“ And those whom Nature favors,” he said aloud to
himself, “she lets take root in her mysterious depths, so
that they spring boldly into the light, with vision un-
dimmed and conscience untrammelled by the befogging
illusions of morality and worldly wisdom.”
Such a highly-favored, completely-endowed human
creature was this abused and abandoned woman.
Deduct the rosy hues of fiction; read “Thekla”
instead of “Regina” ; and there you are.
* • * •
Recognition of the fact that woman as compared
with man is, as Diderot put it, “a savage
inside,” is the commonest thing in literature;
“in women men find beings who have not wan-
dered so far as they have from the typical life of
earth’s creatures. ” Physically, the average woman
is born with the stoop which shows how much
later than man she became “a being erect upon
two legs ” —in any assembly of women you can see
many whose spinal angle suggests with what
difficulty they have risen from all-fours. _ Mentally
she is born into the beliefs and disbeliefs of the
European Middle Ages—or still farther back.
Man and woman are practically creatures of two
civilisations. The fact is everywhere admitted;
yet when he meets a practical illustration of
the fact the ordinary male holds up shocked
hands in astonishment. A door must be either
open or shut ; and you can’t expect a 14th-century
savage to live up to the ideals of 19th-century
civilisation. But the ordinary male does.
m + m *
I declare before Australia that a woman has
the toughest time ! Here has Man been and gone
and accumulated will and conscience, the know-
ledge that twice two are four and the desire to act
up to that knowledge, ideals aesthetic and chival-
rous, moralities and codes and metaphysical re-
ligions and restraints, sufficient, if they were
gathered together, to blot the sun out of the
heavens. And to him comes Woman with her
batch of primitive lusts and instincts and emotions
and her baby’s brain —and dutifully endeavors to
live up to him (or down to him). She is a natural
liar—and be asks her to be truthful. She is a
born jumper to irrelevant conclusions —and he
asks her to be logical. She is destined to be
“immoral,” or her body has no use, no mean-
ing—and he decides that her destiny is to
depend upon his “morality” and his offer of
marriage. She likes the water as little as many
savages and Tysons—and he insists that she shall
wash herself all over at least once a week —even so
under the shower (ugh ! the brute), and pays rene-
gades of her own sex to abuse her in the Sunday
papers when she prefers her natural likes to his
acquired dislikes. She has a vague but steadfast
belief in a Joss and a Devil whom it is necessary
to propitiate—and he desires her to believe a com-
plicated theology and assist in a complicated cere-
monial which mean as little to her as a gilt-edged
plate when you haven’t got a mutton cutlet. She
has few ideas beyond her own diseases and the
other woman’s frock —and he insists that she shall
take an enlightened interest in Federation, archi-
tecture, Ibsen, amoebae, industrial problems, and a
host of other foolish and unnecessary things. And
so on: I protest that Woman has the toughest
time !
No wonder she frequently falters under the
strain. For some of her, the falter means a
“fall”; for some, it means marriage with a
Chinaman. The ordinary white, proud man,
dressed in a little brief garment, surveys himself
approvingly, and decides that angels weep over
the woman who prefers to marry a Chinaman.
He does not understand that his ideals and notions
make many a woman’s life miserable. And the com-
monest male, though he makes liberal exceptions
in the morality-code on his own account, is un-
righteously severe on any lapse from the conven-
tions marked out for Woman. Woman is an
imitative, good - natured creature, anxious to
please ; and she really tries hard—being a wild
animal —to live up to the ideals of “saint,” and
“lady,” and “goddess” which Man has pro-
vided for her. But it is a terrible struggle.
Fancy living in a dress-suit from year’s-end
to year’s-end, and never relaxing in the easy
bliss of pyjamas ! When Vegetable John
comes to the back-gate the average woman gets
into her moral pyjamas. She knows that John
regards her simply as a female—good-looking or
otherwise; he does not exact that she shall per-
petually walk on mental and moral stilts ; and she
is grateful. J ohn is an animal—on her own plane.
And yet her white skin and her veneer of civilisa-
tion make her John’s superior : she condescends to
tyrannise over him, and, a hereditary slave herself,
exults in lording it with a slave of her own. Her
sensations of natural ease and acquired mastery
are so delicious that every now and then a woman
drops out of the regimental line of march, and
exchanges a white back-gate for a yellow front-
gate. She has a white-and-yellow progeny; and
Bulletin contributors rise up and call her and her
progeny blessed—much to the gratification of
Vegetable John.
* * * *
That this is a true view of Woman is proved in
a dozen ways, and especially by the admissions of
women themselves. For when a woman gets a
pen in her hand she supplies a moral to the fable
of the bush-hid ostrich, and, thinking she is con-
cealed under a transparent disguise, publishes to
the world ideas and emotions which she would
shrink from uttering to any man. Thus one re-
cent woman novelist brings her heroine into a
risky situation, and inferentially upbraids the
hero for not taking advantage of it; another sug-
gests that, by the creation of a male class corres-
ponding with a well-known female class, clever
women who do not want husbands might never-
theless have the satisfaction of babies; a third
represents a woman yielding in absolute disgust
with herself, pushed by hereditary forces; and so
on. Yet —of course, I am always referring to
the mass, not the individual; to the rule, not
the exception—because to the eye Woman pur-
ports to be an adult creature on a level with him-
self, Man is continually forgetting proved theories
and admitted facts, and crediting her child-brain
with his own capabilities and potencies, her savage
nature with his own comparatively civilised dis-
tastes and tastes. And when a natural woman,
like Thekla Dubberke, occasionally arises, naked
in her primitive instincts and unashamed, the
man who lives in houses, and goes to offices, and
drags a chain of petty habits to his grave, professes
horror ; though the wife of his suburban bosom is
just such another animal—petted and caged, with
her wild instincts blunted and her claws sheathed.
I must say that when I contrast the high morality
of some of Woman’s instincts with the low morality
of some of Man’s codes, I feel particularly sorry
for Man.— Brigham Brown, M.D., F.R.C.S.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Law and the Push.
The curiously apathetic state of mind with
which Australia views its push was exemplified
a few days ago by a trial which took place in
Sydney. There was a murder done by the
push on New Year’s Eve. In some respects it
was a trifle more horrible than the famous
Gatton affair. The victim was not only kicked
to death, but kicked almost out of any sem-
blance to humanity that he ever possessed.
And it was done in the heart of a large and
allegedly-civilised city where life is supposed
to be reasonably safe. But the event hardly
created a ripple on the surface of affairs. When
the public heard that it was “ only a push out-
rage ” it was practically satisfied, for it is re-
cognised that the push has a license to commit
murder, assault, mutilation, and other trifles
and episodes. Two of the alleged butchers
were found, and the coroner’s jury mildly de-
fined the crime as manslaughter. The Court
released them on light bail—fancy releasing on
light bail anybody reasonably suspected of the
Gatton murder, and yet the most notable
difference between the two cases is that
the Sydney suspects were believed to be
members of a permanent criminal conspiracy,
whereas the other individual was probably the
perpetrator of one solitary outrage. The trial
was a farce, because out of the crowd of people
who saw the crime committed not one dared,
for fear of the push, to come up and say that he
saw anything unusual happen, so there was really
no evidence either for or against the accused.
And even this strange state of things didn’t
excite the placid population in the least. The
push is, in its own dull, clumsy way, a stand-
ing conspiracy against the law and against law-
abiding people in general. It has no recognised
head-quarters, or secretary, or ridiculous
written oath which is taken at midnight in a
cellar, but it is a permanent conspiracy all
the same. Also, it is a secret society of the
worst kind. It can’t compare with Fenianism
or Nihilism because it has no decent purpose or
decent intelligence behind it ; but it is as much
a conspiracy as either of them. In its slow,
dull, smileless career of stoush and smash it
does more damage to life and property than
the average society of dynamiters—the average
practical dynamiter seldom does any real
damage worth mentioning, for his fuse gener-
ally misses fire—only the damage is spread over
a wider area, and somehow it attracts little
notice. It attracts so little notice that the idea
of making it a crime to be even a known mem-
ber of a push has never yet occurred to the
law. If there existed in Australia a political
society, pursuing a possibly good end bv bad
means, and it occasionally “ laid for ” a citizen
who opposed its views, say on land-tax or one-
man-one-vote, and kicked him to death ; and if
it was often found impossible to sheet its crime
home to anybody because lhe witness who
gave evidence against it was almost certain to
become a victim of serious outrage in his turn,
the law would take vigorous measures. It
would assuredly begin by making it a heavily
punishable crime to belong to the society at


all. and would then proceed to lay its long
blue arm on every member it could find. But
when the society is called a push, and wears
bell-bottomed pants, and the law is re-assured
by hearing that it has no good motive as an
apology for its doings, and when it is further
redeemed by the fact that it uses highly
objectionable language when it is off duty, and
makes itself an unpicturesque nuisance at all
times—well, under these circumstances, the
law is quite satisfied.
The Afghan Slavery Affair.
Mr. Millen’s appeal in The Bulletin for
2800 shillings to enable the Afghans enslaved
by the Bourke (N.S.W.) Camel Carrying Co.
to appeal to the Supreme Court has not so far
had substantial results —this, perhaps, because
of the circumstance that the oppressed men
happen to be colored foreigners instead of
white Australians. But Mr. Millen’s appeal,
in which this paper heartily concurs, was one
into which no such personal considerations en-
tered, the sole question at issue being whether
it was lawful in Australia for any man, white
or brown, to be sold into absolute slavery. As
already explained-
The Bourke bench sent two Afghans to gaol for refusing'
to work when ordered by their slave-driver, the local
Carrying Co. These two Afghans and some 40 others had
signed an agreement written in a foreign language. It
set forth that they all-agreed to work for the Carrying
Co. for six years at £24 a year and their food. They
were to get £6 a year cash, and the other £lB a year—
£loB in all —was to be paid them at the end of their term,
provided they finished it. If they didn’t finish it —if the
agreement was broken when there was even one day of
the six years to run—the money was apparently forfeited
to the boss company, ever)? penny of it. The men
couldn’t leave their employment t.ili the six years were
finished without being gaoled for breach of contract, and
making themselves liable to lose the balance of their
wages, but the boss co. could sack them any time
at a month’s notice. Then the three-fourths of
their wages which were retained by the boss would seem-
ingly be forfeited to the boss because the men, through
being sacked by the boss, didn’t finish their term. They
were to be fed on such food as the boss considered suffi-
cient-just as much or little of it, and as good or bad as
the boss thought fit; and if they left work in consequence
it constituted a breakage of the agreement and involved
liability to the same old forfeiture of wages. Anctthey
were to work seven days a week and have no holidays
whatever. The boss of the co., an interested party,
swore that this atrocious agreement was faithfully inter-
preted to the men by the Government interpreter. The
Government interpreter, who ought to know, and who
isn t an interested party, and who is presumably a reli-
able man else he wouldn’t hold such a billet, alleged that
he didn’t faithfully translate the agreement to the miser-
able Afghans before they signed it. He said that he
attempted to do it, but owing to the various interruptions
of the boss, he wasn’t able to. One of the interrup-
tions was at the place where the co. was to hold
back three-quarters of the miserable wage for six vears,
with practically unlimited powers to forfeit it altogether.
The men, bv the way, allege that they were starved and
beaten, atid that even their miserable £6 a year wasn’t
paid. An original agreement under which they were en-
gaged in India wasn’t produced (the co. refused to pro-
duce, it and the Court said it should be handed in, but
didn t press for it), so the merits of the case were not
really inquired into at all. Apparently there were two
agreements, and the co. was allowed to produce the one
that suited it best. And the magistrate said that the
penniless Afghans could carry their case to a higher
court, and he threatened a heavier sentence next time.

Stinking Fisk.
The curious little provincialists of N.S.W.,
who used to demand the capital for their own
province with such a terrific shriek of wrath,
are frothing at the mouth just as much as ever
now that they have got it. As an example,
consider this wild cry of “ stinking fish ” by
Dacey, M.L.A., a politician from Botany :
For the first ten or twelve years the capital is to be in
Melbourne, during which time the self-sacrificing Vic-
torians will have succeeded in filling every available
“billet.’ Then the seat of Federal Government will be
shifted to Tinpot Creek, which is situated on the New
South Wales side of the Victorian border, distant only
200 miles from Melbourne, and 400 miles from Sydney,
further, N.S.W. is to be allowed, by way of concession,
of course, to make the Commonwealth a present of 100
square miles of land, which will be tantamount to fur-
nishing Victoria with additional territory. That the pro-
posed Federal capital will be, to all intents and purposes,
part and parcel of Victoria, goes without saying.
People who imagine that either Bathurst or Goulburn
have a chance of becoming the seat of the Government of
the Commonwealth, show a very poor knowledge of the
character of the Victorians, who are the last people in
Australasia to be caught napping when there is anything
to lie gained. Therefore, it may be taken for granted
that che Federal capital will not be located within reach
of Sydney influence. As the case stands, they are to have
the capital in Melbourne, and we are to have a prospec-
tive one in the bush. What a monument to our clever-
ness !
Beautiful Sydney, with her shattered hopes, is the fit
subject of a dirge. Under the Draft Bill, as it left the
Convention, Sydney was almost certain to be the seat of
Federal Government until the capital was built. This
would be an immense advantage, inasmuch as the pres-
sure of Parliamentary business would prevent anything
being done for some years, during which time we would
have ample opportunity to press the claims of some place
in the immediate neighborhood of Sydney, like the Cen-
tennial Park.
By looking at the map it will be seen that a railway
connecting Blayney with VVerris Creek will almost make a
straight run between Brisbane and Melbourne, and as the
colony of Queensland will before long overshadow Vic-
toria in population and wealth, it is surely entitled to
some consideration in connection with this matter of the
capital.
The general attitude of the Cornstalk provin-
cialise is mostly a wild cry of “ stinking fish.”
His federal aspect is about this : (1) The
N.S.W. people are so weak-minded a crowd
and the Victorians so strong and vigorous,
that, though N.S.W. will have much more
voting-power than Vic. in the Commonwealth
Parliament, the people of the latter province
will get all the billets. (2) The Federal capital
will become practically an addition to the Vic-
torian territory ; the energetic Victorians will
grab it while the feeble-minded Cornstalks are
fainting in the background. (3) The strong
and brainy Victorians are the last people in
Australasia to he caught napping when there is
anything to be gained. (This applies to the
Federal question only ; when the fiscal question
is on, the cry is that the Protectionist policy of
Victoria shows that it doesn’t know when to
come in out of the wet, while the Cornstalk is
the only individual in Australasia who does.)
(4) The capital will be fixed in the south of
N.S. W. because the people of Tasmania, S.A.
and Westralia will stand by Victoria in that
matter for their own convenience. The majority
ought to rule—except when the majority is
located in Victoria, Tasmania, S.A., and Wes-
tralia. Then it shouldn’t. (5) It will be an
incredibly wicked thing and a horrible example
of selfishness if the capital is fixed in N.S. W.,
400 miles from Sydney, and only 200 from
Melbourne. If the capital is fixed at Blayney,
172 miles from Sydney, and 407 from Mel-
bourne, and about 000 miles from Brisbane and
Hobart and Adelaide, it will only be another
proof of the general fitness of things. (6)
Queensland is “ entitled to consideration in the
matter ” on account of the population it is
going to have some day, though the population
that Westralia, S.A., Victoria, and Tasmania
are going to have some day doesn’t count, and
they shouldn’t be considered at all. The way
to consider Queensland is not to plant the
capital at Armidale, about half-way between
Brisbane and Sydney, but to put it at the back-
door of Sydney, a long 700 miles from Queens-
land’s capital. This anxiety to consider Queens-
land is very touching. And, meanwhile, the
situation of Sydney, bereft of the capital, is
very, very sad indeed. And the situation of
Brisbane and Melbourne and Adelaide, all
equally bereft, isn’t worth a curse. Truly, the
N.S. W. provincialist, having secured the capital
for bis province, and bellowing because he hasn’t
got it in his very backyard, and demanding
that the majority shall rule, and wanting to
know what right any majority has to rule
unless it will fix the Federal city where he
pleases, and crying out that the vigorous Vic.
minority will grab all the billets while the
poor, weak-minded Cornstalk, with far more
voting power than Victoria, won’t get one
single little job, is a pathetic essay on the sub-
ject of stinking fish.
Collapse of Small Parkes.
N.S.W. Postmaster-General Varney Parkes
has had to back down. Bluffed by the parsons’
deputation, the Cabinet refuses to let him
grant the public the additional Sunday postal
and telegraphic facilities which he contem-
plated. Confronted by the black-coated
brigade, the P.M.G. showed himself lament-
ably weak. Instead of answering the shep-
herds semi-rebelliously in language pep-
pered with their own nauseous cant
phrases, he should have satirically agreed with
all they had to say—told them that the rumor
about increased Sunday postal work was all a
lie—that Govt, would in future allow no Sun-
day telegraphic or telephonic message over the
wires even in cases of life-or-death ; that no
train or tram was to run on Sunday ; that to
drive a cab, ’bus or other vehicle to church or
elsewhere on Sunday was to be made a criminal
offence punishable by flogging; that anyone
found typesetting or doing other newspaper
work on Sunday was to be sent to gaol ; and
that three months’ hard would be awarded for
the offence of robbing a domestic of her day of
rest by making her cook Sunday dinner.
Varney might have added that cold meat
was very good, especially with salad, and that
anyone who meant to eat meat cold had
better not cut the joint while it was hot,
for that made it dry. As matters stand, the
parsons’ trade-union, by dint of electioneering
threats, has bounced the Govt, out of making
some sorely-needed postal reforms. Of course,
if the sky-pilots’ objections were bona-fide
humanitarian, and not mainly collection-plate,
no one could reasonably complain ; but it is im-
possible for anyone not a dogmatic bigot to
swallow the imprecation which naturally arises
to his lips on reading such an utterance as this
(delivered from a leading Congregational pulpit
on the Sunday after the deputation) :
There were other phases of the Sunday question, how-
ever. He had noticed families going out picnicking.
These children, surely, did not have the advantage of
Sunday religious teaching ; and it was fair to assume that
they did not get it during the week. Sunday was in-
tended as a universal day of rest.
Now, what is Rest ? Listening to common-
place dronings in a stuffy Bethel—or revelling
in the fresh air and the sight of the dancing
water? Also, if children don’t get religious
instruction during the week, that is mainly the
fault of the clergy, who are too lazy to attend
the State-schools after school-hours. The clergy
only want to trade at their own Shops.
The Flogging J.P. of G-roperland.
At Carnarvon (N.W. Australia), George Julius
Brockman, J.P. and squatter, was recently
convicted of ill-treating an aboriginal leased
out to him under Govt, regulations. Locked
up and flagellated the darkie because, as
alleged, he had made amatory advances to an
aboriginal woman of the Brockman mdnage.
George Julius Brockman was fined £5, and
then (which appears to the ordinary clean-shirt
thinker a trifle beastly, and hardly to be looked
for in a magistrate of the territory) he joined
the beaks who had judged his case, and helped
adjudicate on a sly-grog charge ! ! Obviously,
walloping your own nigger is an unconsidered
trifle in Groperland, but the smell of this case
has been too strong to let the Attorney-General
sleep comfortably, and there is some desultory
talk of cancelling the brutal-assault person’s
J.P.-ship. Also, the Government is consider-
ing the case of Thomas de Pledge, Esq., J.P.,
who was fined £5 for flogging a woman on her
naked back till the blood flowed, and £lO for
flogging two other natives in the same fashion.
According to the evidence of a constable, the
back of one native was still covered with scars,
and showed some partially-healed wounds a
month after the flogging. The W.A. Govern-
ment has been thinking in its own slow way for
nearly five months about shifting this second
brute from the Bench, but he was still there at
latest advices.
Federation from the Tailor’s Standpoint.
Sydney Sunday Times has gone round inter-
viewing a number of tailors and other people
(all of them in Sydney), and they are all quite
sure that Sydney should be the Federal capital.
They are a most unanimous crowd of tailors.
Every one of them alleges that while the
Federal Parliament is holding its preliminary
sittings in Melbourne till the new site is fixed
up, it will be a great gain to Melbourne and a
great loss to Sydney, and the fact that Mel-
bourne should have the loss and Sydney the
gain is too self-evident to be worth mentioning.
One person, who manages a hotel, proves con-
clusively that the Federal city should be
Sydney because two people who stopped
at his hotel lately spent as much as
£l5O on jewellery. A Dutch gentleman in
the clothing line says that he simply can’t
understand it—he is too flabbergasted. How
anyone could ever have dreamt for a moment of
putting the Federal capital anywhere except
at the Dutch gentleman’s shop door knocks him
all of a breathless heap. And a jewellery man
proceeds to gravely reason out the loss. The
members of the Federal Parliament are to spend
each £2OOO a year in Melbourne, during the
year or two the Legislature meets there—this
out of a salary of £4OO a year. He explains
the discrepancy by saying that they will all
be very rich men —“ only the wealthy men can
be members, for, with the province all one
constituency, the poor man will have no chance
to canvass the electorate. ” Curiously enough, the
Federal Bill doesn’t provide that the whole
province shall be one constituency—it merely
says that the first election for the Senate only
will be conducted that way—but the jewellery
gentleman probably never read the Bill. Vari-
ous other hotel-keepers rise up to point out
that the Federal Parliament holding its first
sittings in Melbourne will destroy the Sydney
tourist traffic ; people don’t come to see the
beautiful harbor and the magnificence of the
Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, but to
watch politicians struggling with the Dog Act
and things like that. And all the tailors and
hotel-keepers are dead sure that Sydney is
LOST and up a tree—just as New York was
when the Federal city was planted at Wash-
ington.
+.
The Police Identification Fraud.
ATMelb. General Sessions, the other day, a beau-
tiful specimen of the police identification-system
was exhibited. Charles Greene was arraigued
for passing a forged P.O. order on a firm of
Collins-street booksellers. The person who
palmed off this forged order, which had been
altered from ss. to £lO ss.—a very simple thing
to do with the present form of Vic. P.O.
orders—went to the book-shop, bought a £2
present for a young lady, and got the forged
document cashed. The salesman, a member of
the firm, positively identified accused as the
person who gave them the forged order. The
defence was a complete alibi, for a constable
from Ballarat swore that he had ridden out
from Ballarat to Daylesford in the same car-
riage with defendant, that he saw him at Dayles-
ford sports, and that it was impossible for him
to have got to Melbourne until several hours
after the order was uttered. Accused also pro-
duced a railway excess-fare ticket, showing
that he had gone round by Daylesford from
Ballarat, and could not have got down to Mel-
bourne to take out the order. It was further
shown that he had not been near Melbourne for
a fortnight previously, and the evidence once
more demonstrated the iniquitous looseness of
police-'* identification ” methods. The utterer
of the forgery was a young man, and
the suspect, also young, had his chance
of being pitched upon greatly increased by
being ranged up for inspection with eight
other men, none of whom were young.
The present system, in fact, conduces in almost
every possible way to mal-identification. In
the first place, the suspect, from nervousness
due to his predicament, is likely by some
peculiarity of deportment or of facial expres-
sion to single himself out for special observa-
tion. Then again, as the persons ranged up
with the suspect are all more or less aware that
he is the suspect, their interest in the fact
(though manifested in a manner too indefinable
even for themselves to be conscious of) may
nevertheless be enough to “determine” the ex-
pectant attention of persons who, after the man-
ner of the average identifier, are only too ready
to discover in the suspect an individual they
have probably seen only once and for a short
time. Little short of criminal, in fact, is the
alacrity with which some people —mostly
women—will positively identify a man they
have only had a glimpse of in the gloom of
night and under conditions of more or less per-
turbution. A ghastly record—could it be ob-
tained—would be that of the Cheerful Identi-
fier’s innocent victims. And, finally, it is very
possible for the policemen present —consciously
or unconsciously, without speech or actual
gesture —to direct the inspecting person’s ob-
servation to any individual in the row. That
some constables will try to carefully avoid so
doing is doubtless certain, but unfortunately it
is no less certain that many of them, in their
eagerness to secure a conviction, will con-
sciously or unconsciously contribute to the
selection by the identifier of the person already
under police suspicion. The existing system of
identification, in fact, is apparently made to fit
the policeman’s theory that his own raison
d'etre is not so much the subservice of the in-
terests of justice as—given an offence—the
getting somebody punished for that offence. If
guilty, so much the better for everybody. If
innocent, so much the worse for somebody.
The copman’s troubles !
Something' Municipal.
This is the time of the year when, in N.S.W.,
Sands, the grocer at the corner store, engages
in mild warfare with Chops, the butcher down
the road, for the twin honors of representing
Central ward in the local council and of being
referred to in the local Banner as “ the leading
tradesman of High-street.” Bilsmitji, the
horse-shoer, gets there sometimes, but not
often; Biljones, the mason, less often still.
The fact is, Bilsmith and Biljones have come
to believe that, although municipalities are
accomplishing more social reforms elsewhere
than the parliaments, and although they want
the same reforms themselves, the N.S.W.
municipal law is expressly designed to prevent
anybody doing anything but dodge rates and
fet a little roadway made near his own place.
tis a good deal of a mistake, no doubt; but
there is a solid grievance to start with. Apart
from the faot that Sands, at the corner
store, has four votes while the man in
the cottage has only one, and the man who pre-
fers to live comfortably at the pub none at all,
there is no sort of guarantee that anybody will
get a vote at all unless he actually owns the
place that he lives in. Either the owner or
occupier is entitled to have his name on the roll ;
but only the ratepayer is entitled to vote.
Nobody knows for certain who the ratepayer
is. The most ordinary fool has no hesitation in
deciding that the man who pays the rent
supplies the rates, and is, therefore, morally
the ratepayer ; also, if the rates are not paid it
is his furniture that the bailiff plants his person
on and spills beer over. Opinions have, how-
ever, been piled up that the ratepayer is the
man in whose name the rate receipt has been
made out, no matter who does the paying.
Bilsmith and the other person might hang
on to the landlord and see that the rate-
receipts are made out in their names ; but
as a rule they haven’t the time. Sometimes
they feel inclined to go along and vote ; but, as
a declaration has first to be signed and there is
always much talk beforehand about perjury
and false pretences and bigamy and other irre-
levancies, the ordinary Bilsmith prefers to go
home and lets Sands and Chops do all the elec-
tioneering themselves. So far as progress is
concerned it doesn’t matter a straw whether
Sands or Chops wins. All that depends upon
the verdict is whether Sands’ side of the road
or Chops’ side gets a new coat of gravel next
winter. Yet the Municipalities Act is not a
hopelessly bad Act if it were not for the
wrongness of the provisions for electing
those who have the w'orking of it. The
English county councils have hardly more
power than it confers ; but, then, members of
those Councils are elected on what is practically
manhood suffrage, with a small residential
qualification. And, what is found to be of much
importance in practice, all the members go out
in a batch, and the electors send in a complete
body at one swoop. Before that plan was tried
the English Sands and Chops fought it out
just as they still do in this belated country.

Favorable Opening' for a Medical Man.
Editor Bulletin.—l forward herewith certain
documents from which you will see that there
has been insidiously introduced in the West in
connection with hospitals on the remoter gold-
fields (Peak Hill, Bardoc, Goongarrie, Bulong
and others) a pernicious system which enables
the richer residents to obtain medical attend-
ance at home or in hospital, the run of a good
dispensary and all sorts of medical require-
ments, by payment of Is. a week to a “Hos-
pital Medical Fund,” Government finds an
equal amount on the supposition it is dealing
with the subscriptions of miners and wage-
earners and with charitable donations ; the re-
sult being that no independent doctor or drug-
gist can live in the townships where the practice
prevails. Further, the Govt., in the belief
that the hospital work is only a small part of
the local practitioner’s connection, allows only
a very small salary for the medical officer—who
usually has come from an eastern province at
an outlay of .£5O, with sacrifice of connection,
&c., on strength of statement “ private practice
allowed; ” whereas, except in time of rush,
there is no private practice ; it is all appro-
priated by the committee. And as the doctor
usually requires a horse and buggy and has to
-boafrd at an hotel kept (often) by a member of
the committee, he finds himself in a pretty hot
corner. The miners much resent the system,
and are organising a rival one ; but Govt, sub-
sidy gives their opponents too strong a pull.
The hospitals last year cost the Govt. £113,000 ;
the mines throughout the province hardly give
£5 a year, especially at Kalgoorlie, though the
Roses, Brookmans, and other millionaires but
two short years ago promised to show the world
what a model hospital should be. The local
depression is severe, but as the rainfall is more
reliable than elsewhere in Australia, and rich
gold zones—far apart —are gradually being
proved, there’s every reason to hope that when
we have politicians moderately equal to the
details of Govt., all will come right.—A Gold-

Though there is an indistinct moaning on the
bar, which may or may not develop into a
storm later on, the N.S. W. parochial crowd is
still lying very low. Isolated individuals are
doing an isolated curse here and there ; but no
leader has arisen. Lyne says that he will
oppose the new Bill if, “on reflection,” he is
satisfied “ that the Bill is unjust to the inte-
rests of N.S. W.,” which is about the same as
saying that, supposing he finds that he is being
blown away, he will endeavour to catch hold of
something. And, though Sydney Telegraph
publishes disparaging articles about the Bill,
they are mostly signed articles, which only
express the writers’ opinions without commit-
ting the paper itself. In its leader-columns,
it merely states that if, on mature considera-
tion, it finds that 2s. 6d. is really 30d., it will
have no hesitation in saying that it is half-a-
crovvn, let the consequences be what they may.
The D.T.’s position is peculiar. Last time it
had the assistance of the Star and most, of the
Ministry, yet its party was in a minority of
over 5000. This time the Ministry is on the
other side, and the futile little evening paper
has w-obbled over also—so what hope is there ?

H. EDWIN MOORE, Manaokb,
Oastlereagh St., Sydney.
A little South Sea Island trader called the
Emu arrived at Sydney last week with a tale of a
two-headed sea-serpent that made reporters open
their eyes and editors their columns. The fear-
some creature was alleged to have been washed up
by a tidal wave on a S.S. islet, and the remains
were estimated to weigh 70 tons and to have a
backbone 70ft. long. The story didn’t lose in
the telling, and when some bones were solemnly
hauled out of the hold, and a mysteriously-
worded circular invited press representatives to
assemble to view “ the relics,” excitement became
maddening. After a decent wait to enable them
to screw up their courage to sticking-point, the
pressmen—including the editor of an agricultural
journal revolving the possibilities of an article
titled “The Sea-Serpent as Manure”—were
solemnly inducted to the Awful Presence. Then
the latest sea-serpent myth exploded with the same
old lying report. The four bones were simply two
bits of skull, one bit of backbone, and one bit of
rib, of two whales which had been washed
up by the tidal wave on the small island
aforesaid ! And the disgusted agricultural editor
murmured as he proceeded to lose himself in the
cellar of the establishment: “‘Very like a
whale ! ’ Why, dash it all, it is a whale ! + +
+f! ****!?”

Charles Holloway revived the “Work
Girl ” at Sydney Royal on Saturday, and did
immense things and proceedings in the way of
scenery, stage management and the like. Yet he
couldn’t disguise the fact that the prevailing note
is one of Gloom. Perhaps he didn’t want to disguise
it, and the play is all the more true to nature by
reason of its gloom ; for this is a cheerless planet,
and if at any moment it happened to send in its
resignation the universe wouldn’t be any the
sadder for the event. The “Work Girl” starts
with a murder in a cellar and the dropping of the
body into the moaning Thames. Then there is a
scene which looks like a bare-faced steal from
“ Silver King ”: the Derby-day ; husband rather
drunk and just gambled away his last copper;
wife in search of him ; small sick child at home ;
and the man who proposed to the wife before she
married her present husband hooting in the back-
ground like an owl among the higher branches.
The husband is run in on a false charge laid by
Genesis, the Jew, and gets 12 years ; the wife
drops down dead ; and the moaning infant at
home is left moaning. All of which is cheerful.
And as the tale goes on it falls into deeper depths
of grief. The moaning baby grows up, and she is
betrayed and has an infant, and toils wearily for a
living in Jew Genesis’s sweating den. The bony
harridan in charge casts her infant up at her and
sacks her in the presence of all the work girls,
while she tries to sink through the floor in shame.
Her father gets out of gaol about this time, and
faints anonymously on Blaekfriars Bridge for
want of pig’s-feet or other sustenance. Her lover
commits forgery, and has to marry the daughter
of the man who did the murder in the cellar
already mentioned, to hush things up. And that
lady not only throws up the illicit baby to the
Work Girl —it is a kind of india-rubber baby and
bounces up at the shortest notice—but horse-whips
her as well. Whereupon, being crushed and
spanked and betrayed and penniless, and having
her gutta-percha baby bouncing in her face at every
turn, she tries to drown herself, and interfering
people haul her out.
* • • •
Thereafter other miseries keep dropping
in while passing. The lady who horse-whipped
the Work Girl finds that her first husband is
still alive so that she is a nicely-dressed bigamist.
First husband, a mangy conspirator in a crushed
hat, is arrested for something. The lady’s father
is arrested for murder, and his ill-gotten pile dis-
appears. And the tale ends somehow in a back
attic with all the good people still broken down
and penniless, and some of them just out of gaol,
and the rest of them just fished out of the river.
The only satisfaction is that the bad people are
left in gaol also—all except Genesis, the Jew.
Good old Genesis is cast down many stairs, and
his tall, white hat blows along troubled paths, but
he keeps afloat to the end.
• • • *
J. P. O’Neill’s fine, unctuous rendering of
Genesis, the Jew, and the comedy of his two brief,
thick legs and his balloon-like stomach, are thril-
ling features in Holloway’s drama. Miss Ada
Guilford also makes a pleasing impression till she
dies of heart-disease, and Alice Deorwyn, Amy
Gourlav and Ida Gresham do ditto. But the
main effect is that the co. is respectable all round
without anyone—save Genesis aforesaid —towering
high above the rest. As for the scenic effects,
they may be briefly described as gorgeous.
** * *
All the little brown girls of Japan are
reported well at Her Majesty’s, and the large blue
girls of England are ditto, or thereabouts. They
are a distressingly tight-laced and belted-in lot,
these tall blue girls of England, but apparently
the tight-lacing hasn’t injured them, and even if
it does it is their own funeral. Their thinness,
which seems to grow more apparent as time goes
on, is possibly meant as a delicate compliment to
the libretto. Borne up by the joyous energy of
Chinaman Wun, the “Geisha” still prospers
greatly, and the garish sun of Japan shines on a
full treasury. Up to now the “Geisha ” has been
as big a draw as two boot-trunk trials, and a
pickled head wouldn’t be a oircumstance by com-
parison.
#* * *
“After Dark,” another good old Boucicault
melodrama, has flickered up for a week or so at
Sydney Lyceum. It differs a little from the
average melodrama, because the hero is an ancient
Wreck beaten down by misfortune and gin—a
person who lives under a dry arch and whose pre-
carious existence is disguised in bagging. Also
there are other differences—in fact, it doesn’t flare
up on the regulation lines of melodrama except in
a few instances. There is no lost girl in it. There
is a baronet, just come into his title, who drives a
night-cab in London, and daren’t come out by day
because of the forged bill; and a vast estate which
is to come to him if he marries cousin Rose; and
he can’t marry Rose unless he gets rid of his wife
Eliza ; and if he doesn’t marry Rose he will never
have the money to buy up the forged bill and will
have to drive nis night-cab as long as the horse
can keep on its legs. Eliza refuses, at the same
old street comer, to take money as the price of hw
silence; there is a certain cloth at the Lyceum
with a faded street comer painted thereon, and at
that corner a long succession of heroines have
scorned sums which add up to £2,327,410 3s. Od.
as the price of various iniquities, though they have
sometimes gratefully accepted the humble, but
honest, tater off a barrow when proffered by a per-
son with a feelin’ ’art.
• * * *
Barring the fact that Eliza proves to be
the long-iost daughter of the Wreck, “ After
Dark ” doesn’t develope into anything in particu-
lar. Diver, as the Wreck, tackles a thankless and
drunk character after the manner of a very
capable artist. Miss Burdette, the faithful wife,
who rejects much ill-gotten wealth at the street-
corner and is afterwards found in the river, is a
wife that any disreputable baronet might be proud
of; and Bert Bailey is a good conventional Jew of
the conventional stage pattern. Nobody else,
except Harcourt and Miss Madge Hope, amounts
to much. The man who is tied on the railway-line
escapes his just doom, for the gradual paste-board
express doesn’t run over him after all. The man
with the one ear goes back to Van Diomen’s Land.
And as the baronet repents, and never comes
into the money, after all, he presumably goes back
to drive his cab. ‘The Wreck comes to no well-
defined end save that he promises to leave off
drink, and except in melodrama that isn’t a reli-
able income. The Lyceum scenes have taken to
going up sideways pretty frequently of late, and
the side scenes totter a good deal now and then,
and the big boot advt. on the curtain has become
a deep-rooted grief. Also, the ghost of author
Boucicault is waiting on the Golden Shore with a
club for one or two members of the co. by reason
of their treatment of his highly respectable old
romance. This remark applies especially to the
sketchy gentleman who ought to be run over by
the crumpled pasteboard train but isn’t.

Sydney Tivoli bill has begun to fill up
again with new names. Horace Wheatley, a
person with a considerable variety of attainments,
and Howard Chambers, the owner of a deep, roll-
ing, bass voice, are two of the new arrivals, and
Miss Lottie Moore’s clever sketch, “Her Other
Husband,” goes remarkably well. The show busi-
ness is at rather a low ebb in Sydney just now,
consisting as it does of one variety co., a Japanese
musical frivolity, a couple of old dramas revived,
and a scheme for doing something handsome in
recognition of the merits of a lady with a Burnt
Back, but there are hopes of a revival at Easter.
• * • *
The obscure allusion to the lady with the
Burnt Back has reference to Miss Julie Wood-
ville, a pretty and promising young actress whose
career at the Lyceum was cut short for the time
being by two lamentable accidents. In one produc-
tion where she had to be rescued from drowning and
hauled up a revolving mill-wheel, a wire somehow
got round her fair young neck, and she was hanged
without benefit of clergy, in addition to other
damage. She partially recovered from this mis-
hap, and, while rescuing two people out of a burn-
ing building at the same theatre, her dress caught
fire, and reduced part of her to something ap-
proaching a cinder. While recovering from this
conflagration she contracted inflammation of the
lungs. It is proposed to do something by way of
compliment to the artiste, who had the courage to
finish her part in the painful condition of a burnt
heretic, and The Bulletin trusts that it will be
done handsomely ; for the fried lady’s sufferings
have been much greater than the flippant tone of
these remarks might suggest. Any contributions
will be thankfully received by Mrs. Creed, at the
Bulletin office.

“ One Summer’s Day,” the latest Brough
production at Melb. Princess’s, is a serio-farcieal
comedy of a “ somewhat different ” flavor, with a
lot of sham emotion, and real hay in the fore-
ground. It is not very clever in any respect. Its
weak plot, the climax whereof can be foreseen in
the first act, is kept alive by an old theatrical
trick : eight of its twelve characters have no bear-
ing on the plot: and much of the dialogue relates to
a certain tiresome “ kiddie,” who never appears on
the stage, and whose death, through getting run
over by a baker’s cart behind the scenes, is a most
unshocking surprise. Yet, despite all its faults and
flabbiness, “One Summer’s Day ” is an enjoyable
show. The first two acts present an island on the
Thames, where seven people come in punts to
picnic among the cut grass, some of which
is piled in haycocks of such unnatural hardness
that a person sitting upon one of these pointed
mounds seems to be founded on a rock. Two or
three gaudy gipsies and an extraneous small boy
(no connection of Kiddie aforesaid) are also quar-
tered on the island. One female gipsy is the
mother of Kiddie, whom bachelor Brough
adopted long ago; the male gipsy being her
alleged husband by a second marriage. The small
boy is just a Cockney waif, sporting a pair of
capacious pants with a vast patch behind. He
haunts the picnic for the purpose of persecuting
the consumers—a preternaturally wise urchin he
is—a ragged, joyous imitation of Master Bailey in
“Martin Chuzzlewit.” A superfluous old artist
bribes the boy with five bottles of gingerbeer to go
away and make himself ill, but he turns up again
in the second act, full of ginger beer, but still
going strong.
* • • »
By this time it is clear that Miss Noble
prefers bachelor Brough, a man of forty odd, to
his young friend, W. T. Lovell, probably because
Lovell has no conversation, whereas Brough can
talk by the hour together about the invisible
Kiddie. Brough is the sort of stage character who
pretends to want to sacrifice his matrimonial
hopes upon the altar of friendship for the other
fellow. Also he is so impossibly dense that he
can’t see Miss Noble’s preference, and he allows
a stagey misunderstanding to force her into
saying “Yes” to Lovell, or rather she asks
Brough to deliver the melancholy message.
Then, in the middle of Brough’s distress, the
patched urchin fires off the almighty truth that a
man’s life is mostly a matter of wimmin and gals.
Here endeth the urchin episode. The third act
happens on the lawn of somebody’s house, and the
misunderstanding between Miss Noble and
Brough proceeds fitfully. W. T. Lovell makes
painful love to the girl who wishes she hadn’t pro-
mised to marry him, and the people of no import-
ance help to fill up space until Brough drops in to
mention that he was about to kiss the deceased
Kiddie. Then the misunderstanding clears it-
self away, and all is well, except with the other
fellow.
• • • •
The two scenes painted by George Gordon
are exceptionally beautiful, even for the Princess’s,
and, what with the hay that sticks naturally to
the picnickers’ garments, and the casual urchin,
and the eccentric irrelevance of things in general,
“ One Summer’s Day ” is an interesting
production. Miss Noble, a little warmer in
voice and manner than of yore, plays
the heroine charmingly. Brough is calm
and convincing (apart from his theatrical blindness
to the truth) as the middle-aged Major, and W. T.
Lovell can’t very well help being a failure as the
colorless young man. These two friends, by the
way, have a wearisome habit of slapping one an-
other on the back. Mrs. Brough is unfortunate in
her little character of the melodramatic gipsy
woman. Among the casual people who have much
to say, the principal successes are the Urchin
(Master Sydney Smith) and Leslie Victor as a
youth—almost as bright a youth as Dot Boucicault
ever gave us.

At Melbourne Royal the fight for the log
of “ The White Heather ” is giving much satisfac-
tion to crowded audiences, and Lady Godiva will
wear nothing in particular every evening until
further notice. The Bulletin has already lauded
“The White Heather” to the skies or thereabouts,
but seeing that Melb. is short of shows just now it
looks probable that Bland Holt’s prosperous pano-
rama will receive some more lauding next week.

The Bijou was a scene of fulness and joy,
last Saturday, on account of Peggy Pryde. Peggy
brought some songs that had “ never been there
before; ” also she repeated her immortal imper-
sonation of the small woman, with the baggy um-
brella, who declines to accept men as men, on
their own unsupported testimony. Peggy is in
terrible health and spirits, and her smile goes
further than ever. The Phillips-Lorenzi panto-
mime, Cora Caselli, the girl with the
naughty wink, Foreman and Fannan, Whit-
burn, and the man with the missing leg, are
helping the Bijou programme along. The Dazzler
is understood to be going away this week. Some
people took violent exception to the prevailing
tone of the Dazzler’s ditties, so it would not be
out of place for the management to publish the
sad tidings of her departure in large type.

“ T.D.” : Bulletin complains that musical pros., after
their “ farewell ” benefits, fail to quit our shores. There
are reasons. For instance : One well-known artist who
lately farewelled was besieged, ere half the proceeds were
raked in, by a swarm of creditors, some of whose faces
he (or she) had actually forgotten, so long had she (or he)
been without their visits. And they threatened arrest if
the beneficiare attempted to leave Australia before the
debts were paid. Many “complimentary ” concerts, no
doubt, are really the last supreme efforts of indigent
creditors to recover their due. And, suppose an artist
needs £l5O wherewith to travel second-class to Marchesi
or Santley and European glory, and only derives £3O or
£4O from his benefit—well, what d’you expect him to do?
Clement Scott, if he comes to Australia to talk
about Stageland, had better not lay any stress upon him
self in his old character of “great” theatrical critic for
London D.T. Australia has seen too many specimens of
London-press opinion that were not a little bit endorsed
on this side. As for Clement Scott in particular, the few
people hereabouts who know anything of his “criticisms”
know that he has been a pompous adulator of managers
and mummers, striving to make himself appear free and
independent the while that he sat at the Profession’s
feet. As an experienced playgoer and student of play-
writing, and a literary habitud of the inner theatrical
circle, Scott should be able to spin some interesting lec-
tures, but he mustn’t get on a pedestal to do it.
“Haresfoot” : Re Miss Musgrove. Her father is wise,
and has the support of her mother, who knows what the
stage is. George Vandenhoff, in his autobiography,
writes that he only acted with his distinguished father
once or twice, because the old man’s ai>ony at seeing his
son on the boards was so palpably distressing. Edmund
Yates’s parents, actor and actress, lived at the Adelphi
Theatre, yet kept him in ignorance of such a thing as
long as they could. Nevertheless, he died in a theatre
One of the most prominent and cleverest of Melb.
amateur vocalists (call him Jeremiah) was besieged by a
certain organiser of a concert to entertain the Mayor of
one of the suburbs. Said organiser was so persistent that
at length he succeeded in persuading the amateur ; also,
he insisted almost up to fighting point that Jerry should
be recouped to the extent of his exes. Jerry sang six
songs, and went well with the aldermen. He was leaving
?/' '° me ( 80, " e miles away) when the organiser of
the concert approached him, and again broached the exes,

E. B. Manning, who has resigned his billet as paid
secretary of E. Melb. O.C. in recognition of the club’s
linpe ainiosity, is to get a pretty handsome testimonial,
seemingly Manning is now a cricket identity of ten
years standing, and the young generation doesn’t reineni
her him as an actor. B. and It. brought him and his wife
Florence Ilarcourt) from England with their original
comedy and burlesque co., and his long, thin identity
figured as the wicked baronet in “ Little jack Sheppard,”
what time Brough was playing Jonathan Wild and Emma
lemple gave her neat little performance of Winifred.
About the most useful thing that Manning did was the
lank in “Vice Vers*.” He was the staj»-e
father of Dulcie, a fact that will always live in the memory
of those who saw Nina Boucicault (Dulcie) give the abso-
lutely sweetest imaginable performance of a short-
f rocked, coquettish little school miss, with the shapeliest
of legs in black stockings and a bunch of bonnie brown
hair a-hanging down her hack. Actresses are not made,
but born, for such convincing pictures as the Dulcie
whom Dot Boueicault’s pretty sister gave to Australia.
A Bulletin par. of recent date included Armes Beau-
mont s name in a list of dead musical celebrities Heaven
knows how the writer of that par. came to make such an
error Tiik Bulletin doesn’t. Armes Beaumont has
al ways been a live tenor since this journal first knew and
admired his voice, and on the same day when his name
was published in the little list aforesaid he gave tuneful
evidence of his vitality by warbling for Maggie Sterling’s
benefit at Melb. Town Hall. The only Beaumont is not
dead, but taking pupils as a rule.
Stanley Moses was fiddling at Brussels when last heard
from. The Journal de Bruxelles, criticising a concert
which he gave in conjunction with Philippe Mousset on
Dec. 9, speaks as reverently of Stanley as if he were the
great original Moses of them all.
Dear Bulletin. Re faculty of distinguishing musical
pitch. It is startling news from your correspondent
“B.” that “any musician with an ear of average accu-
racy can at once tell the pitch of a note.” This would
make the faculty almost universal, except among the
tone-deaf. I am alarmed at the statements that it “ can
be acquired,” and that it is “ taught in class.” I cannot
say these statements are convincing, and still claim that
it is the rarest musical gift. You may get. a clever musi-
cian to “ think of a note ” beforehand, and base his idea
of pitch by running up or down from the tonic note which
he has in his mind. But distinguishing musical pitch in-
stantly and intuitively is quite another matter. “ B.”
appears to doubt that Mozart was the first known instance
of this gift, and says “It is absurd to suppose that
Handel and Bach were not also masters of pitch.” Yes,
but it is quite as absurd to suppose that they were, when
the fact is not mentioned in the published biographies,
nor is it recorded of Beethoven, Schumann, or Chopin ;
while it is recorded of Mozart as a special circumstance
among his other marvellous musical gifts. It may be
that this gift is common among Australians of “B.’s”
acquaintance. That would be a matter for congratula-
tion. But that it can be acquired, or taught, is no more
probable than that red hair or blue eyes can be acquired
or taught, or Roman noses developed in class.— The
Writer of that Par.
Little Foley Westwood, the boy violinist who made
such a good impression at Newbury s concerts, took first,
prize in a Melbourne competition the other week. The
la,d was meeting a dozen players older than himself, and
his performance is a feather in the hat of his teacher,
Miss Gertrude Sunnnerhayes, herself a greatly-improved
artist of late. Young Westwood, poor fellow, is almost
blind.
The Firm’s No. 2 “ Sign of the Cross ” co. was, at latest
dates, diffusing Early Christianity around the western
wilds of Tasmania. Hobart people seem to have been
not too much impressed by the Great Moral Drama. Any-
way, they preferred Miss Emily Hughes as Josephine, in
“ A Royal Divorce,” to her impersonation of the hysteri-
cal young woman in white.
Somebody writes a furious letter to The Bulletin con-
cerning a “ Poverty Point” paragraph as follows : “Not
long ago, at- a St. Kilda (Vic.) Druids’ meeting, a Chow
half-caste defeated (15) all comers in a sentimental sing-
ing competition. By the way, are Indian hawkers eligible
for admission to the Ancient Order of Druids?” The
paragraphist erred, it seems, in applying the term “ half-
caste ” to a competitor, who is, in fact, “ a full-blooded
Chinese.” The fact that he is also “a matriculated
student of Melb. University” has nothing to do with the
paragraph’s point, but The Bulletin mentions the cir-
cumstance by way of soothing its angry correspondent.
Also, The Bulletin, having made a public enquiry on the
subject of Druid rules, is glad to publish its angry corres-
pondent’s explanation that “the nationality of a brother
has nothing to do with his being a Druid.” The question as
to whether a full-blooded Chinese is necessarily a superior
person to a half-caste, has an official answer in the poll-
tax imposed on his fellow countrymen who come to this
country. The Bulletin leaves its angry correspondent
to abuse the various Australian Governments which have
ranked the Chinese as an inferior race, and are not likely
to be convinced to the contrary by the high intelligence
and warbling abilities of one Chinese in particular. On
official showing, The Bulletin’s error was in the nature
of a compliment to the aggrieved party. As for the term
“ Chow ” it means Chinaman, even as “ cockney ” means
Londoner.

The possibility of there being numerous and
payable deep leads on W.A. goldfields is increasing. The
great drawback to their discovery is the immense areas of
flat country that may contain such without showing
surface indications. The latest find, Maggie Lead, Bu-
long, from 35 to over IUO feet sinking, runs from surface
appearances on the top of a ridge.
By the way, a correspondent tells The Bulletin
that Bulong deep lead is not yet defunct. It is good
enough to keep many men off the labor market, or from
making futile efforts to treat tailings with the shaker.

Westralian wire : “ The Boulder Milling Co.’s
works are again shut down, owing to the failure of the
plant, as at present constituted, to treat the slimes which
form about 60 per cent, of the bulk of the dump. When
the plant was re-started a quantity of sand containing
only a small percentage of slimes was treated which gave
a fairly satisfactory result, the residuals assaying
from 2d wt. to 3dwt. per ton.” A gloomy out-
look. The slimy nature of the Great Boulder
tailings-dump was known all along. That was the
trouble the Konemann process was going to laugh
at, and, if it fails, the world will laugh at the process, the
Great Boulder directors will surely be fired, manager
Dick Hamilton will begin to look sick, but the rich G?B.
mine will go on its way rejoicing, extracting its gold by
methods which have had to work their way without wet-
nursing.
The Ballarat Woollen Mills lately called for
competitive designs and tenders from builders of steam
engines, that of the Austral Otis Engineering Company,
South Melbourne, being accepted. These engines are of
the compound surface condensing type, with cylinders
17" and 38" by 60" stroke, and will indicate 700 h.p. on a
consumption of 151 b. steam per hour. The design is a
handsome and massive one, and they are probably the
finest example of engine-building yet produced in the
colony.*

The Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. (Sydney)
which showed a very marked improvement .in 1897, pub-
lishes a still more promising set of accounts for 1898. In
the ordinary department the premium income was
£88,308 ; the total income £98,262 ; and the amount
added to the accumulation was £68,877, making the total
funds of the ordinary life department 1214,095. During
recent years the progress of the Citizens’ Ordinary
branch has been as follows :
Interest Total Added
Premiums. Receipts. Revenue, to Funds.
1892 £15,157 £479 £15,641 £11,187
1893 19,233 1,255 20,488 14,636
1894 28,692 2,387 31,080 18,208
1895 40,816 3,270 44,089 26,427
1896 50,913 4,565 55,483 31,059
1897 64,669 5,334 70,012 44,708
1898 88,308 7,501 98,262 58,877
This is a very fine record of steady progress. In the
Citizens’ Ordinary Life Department expenses are limited
to 15 per cent, of the total revenue, therefore it comes
third (the A.M.P. Society and Maoriland Government Life
Office being first and second) in cheapness of management.
This is leaving the Victoria, the Adelaide Life and the
Australian Alliance out of the reckoning, but these offices
have practically abandoned the business. All expenses
over and above the 15 per cent, have to be borne bv the
Industrial Branch, and in former days, when this resulted
in an exorbitant expense rate for the latter branch, the
arrangement meant a had bleeding of the indus-
trial policy holders. Now, however, the expense-rate
in the Industrial Branch is reasonably low, as expenses
go in the thankless penny and tuppence a week business,
so the arrangement probably does some good to the
Ordinary Branch without doing any serious harm to any-
body else.
The Industrial Branch also looks a good deal
better, as the following figures show:
Income. Added to Funds.
1892 .. £109,686 £24,460
1893 .. 112,957 21,763
1894 .. 126,998 10,060
1895 133,404 10,503
1896 .. 146,647 11,655
1897 .. 156,144 167
. 1898 .. 156,494 26,033
The industrial branch expenses for 1898 totalled £78,903,
equal to rather over 50 per cent, of total income. This in
ordinary life assurance would be something unspeakable,
but in the thriftless, itinerant, penny and threepencea week
business which is conducted at the policy-holders back-
door it isn’t considered anj’thipg unusual. In industrial
assurance the client is always considered to he very fortu-
nate if he gets 6d. worth of assurance for Is., while the
other 6d. goes in paying the people who live on the game.
Anyhow, the Citizens’ Industrial Branch has a lower ex-
pense rate for 1898, and a larger income, and a larger
addition to its funds than in any previous year. The
funds of this branch now amount to £210,805.
The Citizens* Co. presents its accounts in a
much better form than it used to do. Foreclosed pro-
perty and overdue interest are shown separately, and
both items look very satisfactory. There is nothing ob-
jectionable about the appearance of the assets, save that
£128,000 out of a total of £404,000 is represented by
freehold property, which is a very large proportion to
have sunk in bricks and mortar. In the Ordinary Branch
*'ooo has been written off for depreciation of securities,
which looks a reasonably liberal provision, and provided
the valuation of the assets is correct (a matter which, in
the absence of any independent State audit and valuation,
“J 8 /?. . assunie d in the case of ever}’ co., more or less),
the Citizens’ Co. looks very well. The co. lately pulled
down its old building to make room for a new one on the
same site, and as this demolished an asset which, despite
its age, must have had some value, there is presumably a
loss under this heading, though how the loss is provided
for isn t very clear. Anyhow, the freehold-property item
in the balance-sheet has gone up in one year from £70,000
to £128,000. Part of this doubtless arises through the
purchase of the Planet Society’s offices in Melbourne, but
as the Planet only valued its offices at £30,000, it seems as
if the new Sydney building accounted for a good deal of
the increase. But a certain faint suspicion about the
value of the office property hangs over a good many insti-
tutions in these times.
• * * *
The Australian Widows’ Fund—a steady-going
life assurance concern which never does anything of a
wildly-sensational character—issues an inoffensive bal-
ance-sheet for the year ended 31st October, 1898. The
results compare with some previous years as follows :
Total Interest Added to
Premiums. interest. Funds
1892 .. .. £169,689 .. £55,992 .. £85,118
1893 .. .. 165,285 .. 55,798 .. 106,733
1894 .. „. 157,442 .. 57,729 .. 84,202
1895 .. .. 153,607 .. 53,194 .. 60,718
1896 .. .. 155,080 .. 56,536 .. 68,392
1897 .. .. 150,602 ~ 58,446 .. 49,005
1898 ... .. 155,539 .. 58,881 .. 63,716
Consideration for annuities is included in premiums. The
figures show that business has begun to look up a little
with the Widows’ Fund, though it is still smaller than
it was in ’92. And through the heavy writing-off of
losses a year ago the net increase in the funds during
seven years has been only £390,408, the total being now
£1,310,905. The Widows’ Fund is a respectable
safe-looking office of the unemotional variety. Its
assets look good all round; the item of interest in
arrear is very moderate, also that of “ property acquired
by foreclosure ” is not excessive, and these two go a good
way as a test of the safety of the mortgage investments.
The only bad feature is the heavy expense rate, but most
Australian life assurance societies are troubled that wav.
In 1890 the Widows’ Fund spent £l9 10s. 7d. out of every
£lOO of total income in expenses. Then the rate dimin-
ished, till in 1893 it got down to £l6 7s. 7d. per £lOO •
now it has risen again to £l9 9s. This isn’t an altosrether
unusual rate in this country ; there are four Australian
offices—the Mutual Life Association, City Mutual, Tem-
perance and General, and Colonial Mutual—which are
even worse in this respect ; still it is a very high fVure,
and knocks an awful hole in the policy-holders’ profits.
•*» * r
The Mercantile Mutual Insurance Co. (Sydney)
shows a profit of £11,714 for 1898, a year in which most
fire companies struck a very bad reef of disaster. Some
previous profits compare as follows :
1891 .. £13,885 1895 .. £8,265
1892 .. 13,691 1896 .. 12 136
1393 .. 13,097 1897 .. 10,989
1894 .. 11,571 1898 .. 11,714
The co. devotes £4384 to paying a bonus to policy-holders,
and a similar sum to paying a 17 per cent, dividend to
shareholders on the nominal paid-up capital of £26,250.
But, as ths amount actually paid-up was only £18,750,
the rest of the capital coming out of profits, the share-
holders really receive about 23 per cent, on their money.
After paying- its dividend and bonus, there remains a
balance of -2940, which increases the sum at credit of
profit and loss to £5859. In addition to this, the co. has a
reserve of £40,000, which, by the way, it would do well
to increase, even if the huge dividend has to be
toned down a little in the process. Though £40.000 is a
very large reserve according to Australian ideas, it isn’t
very massive as such things are understood in Britain.
Still, the Mercantile Mutual is a very solid and prosperous
affair, and its invariable large profits and immense divi-
dends are an interesting commentary on one feature of
the State fire insurance controversy. When State fire in-
surance is suggested the blatant alleged “ expert ” always
rises to point out that such a thing would necessarily be
confined to one province, and would, therefore, be
ruinous—that the only way to make fire insurance pay is
to spread it over many countries or provinces. He has to
tell that lie in the interests of his own bread and butter.
And yet while private fire offices which spread over a
wide area have been going down like houses of cards, the
Mercantile Mutual, run on the disastrous one-province
principle, consistently pans out as above.
* * * •
The Carlton Brewery Co. (Melb.) showed a
profit for 1898 of £5646 (equal to 21 per cent, per annum
on the much-written-down capital), as against £3550 profit
for 1897. But the awful tangle into which things got
during the boom has only improved very slightly. The
Carlton was an honest, sober, medium-sized affair, which
made good beer and minded its own business, until the
boom frenzy commenced. Then it was formed into a
company, with £125,000 capital; and a few years later it
was re-formed into a company' with £7sff,ood capital ; and
its properties were written* up to the gorgeous boom
value, and immense sums were raised on debentures,
and the “goodwill” of the old, simple, unpretending
beer was put in the balance-sheet at £150,000 ; and other
tremendous wild-catisms were done. And now that
these bogus values have all vanished again the Carlton
Co. finds its balance-sheet stand like this :
Liabilities. Assets.
Capital £26,820 Cash £1,787
Debentures .. .. 317,747 Sundry Debtors .. 80,695
Mortgage - Debent- Plant, Stock, etc. 38,847
ures 365,085 Real Estate . . .. 318,233
Mortgages .. .. 104,213 Shortage .. .. 402,105
Small Debts .. .. 27,802
£841,667 £841,667
The balance-sheet divides the last item into “goodwill
£150,000” and deficiency £252,105, but as the goodwill of
a concern in such a strait as this can be of no earthly
value just now, the above is really how things stand. The
capital is all lost and about £375,000 more, therefore the
losses can’t be written off out of present capital. During
the year the co. seems to have blasted about £2BO out of
shareholders, so the prospect of writing off losses out of
new capital is very limited also. And it is by no means
certain that the real estate is worth £318,000 now, so the
shortage may be even larger than appears. If the Carlton
Co. had unlimited time before it there is no reason why it
should not right itself about the year 2000, or even sooner if
property values go up; for even after it has paid interest
on its liabilities there is a steady profit. But the present
debentures mature in 1902, and the co.’s agonised shriek
for a renewal has met with no response, and if the
debenture-holders really demand their cash in 1902, the
co., apparently, must needs go under.
• • * •
M'Cracken’s City Brewery (Melbourne) shows a
loss for 1898 of £9158, so the little rift in the clouds which
appeared last year is off again. This is how the great
shattered beer-factory has been getting on during recent
years:
1893 Loss £4,636 I 1896 Loss £35 874
1894 „ 10,406 1897 Profit 1,002
1895 „ 22,923 | 1898 Loss 9,158
The endless trouble of this concern is the £22,500 a year
which goes out as interest on £500,000 of 4| per cent, de-
bentures (a wholly needless liability created when the co.
bloated itself out so ridiculously in the boom-time), and
the interest on £49,000 overdraft and £lOO,OOO of miscel-
laneous mortgages. Already £250,000 of capital has been
written off as lost; and now it is decided to call up the
£500,000 remaining capital, or as much or as little of it as
can be collected, in order to shift some of the liabilities,
and reduce the interest, and provide a little cash to go
on with. It is also proposed to raise £40,000 by the
issue of preference shares for the same purpose. If it is
possible to raise, say, £300,000 by these devices—which is
none too certain, for the average shareholder in so un-
profitable a concern has to be tracked down with blood-
hounds to extract calls from him—the saving of interest
should just about enable M’Cracken’s co. to pull through
—always provided there are no more years like ’95 and
’96. It is specially provided that not more than £12,500
ayear is to be distributed in dividends until the outstand-
ing debentures are reduced below £400,000, which clause
is probably put in to make things look cheerful. The
idea of the lamentable brewery tying itself down to prevent
it dissipating its profits too wildly in dividends is sug-
gestive of the small man who calls to the crowd to hold
him back lest he assaults the sixteen big men too furi-
ously.

Far-western N.S.W. meat-works are having ,a
bad time, partly because drought makes it impossible to
get stock on what to these works are reasonable terms,
and partly through stoppage of river traffic. The Bourke
co. has to shut dow n for some months, and a further-west
co. is in greater distress still. In three years it has not
done three months full work, and extensive squatting
property secured has been next door to useless. In this
latter enterprise Australia’s best-known ’Murkan mining
man has dropped a few thousands.

Cobar notes:—The Occidental publishes its half-
yearly report full of promise, and a balance-sheet showing
a bank overdraft for over £2OOO. Of this, £lOOO has been
expended on stores. Contracts had been made for regular
supplies, but water ran out, hence a shut-down. How'-
ever, to ensure permanent work in future, the manage-
ment have gone in for a large tank and a good pumping
plant, besides opening up the mine,at levels never hefore
explored. This means no divs. for several months, but when
things do start again shareholders mav have something
worth looking after. Meanwhile, through news of
the overdraft, scrip has had a substantial fall.
Cobar Gold Mines Ltd. has struck a plan to raise revenue.
The town is on the verge of water-famine, and the great
copper-mine was about to shut-down, which would mean
ruin to thousands. The Cobar G.M. Co. has turned
to water-selling, and is charging a swingeing Wes-
tralian price to the copper syndicate for supplies from its
big dam, “ Lake O’ Gorman.” The Young Australian
talks of itself as the greatest gold-producer on the field.
Its mill, though erected over two years, has run but a few
months, and then not. on its own stone, but as a public
crusher. A heap of rich tailings has thus accumulated,
and a lot of base bullion sent away, and they talk of
6DOOOZ. of “gold” for the year. Cyanide bullion worth
from £2 to £2 10s. per oz. is not gold. Like its neighbor,
the Mt. Pleasant, it never should have had a battery at
all. It’s a copper-mine or nothing.——The Chesney has
been talking for weeks about machinery in a foundry
somewhere, but no sign of it at Cobar. Little or nothing
doing at the mine. With its limited calling-power it
will have a struggle to make a start, despite its good
qualities and good manager. The Great Western thinks
it has a rich patch, and is about to start crushing again.
This time it will go near to crushing itself out of existence
as a co.

”* Tjie mantle of prophecy never gave the “Wild
Cat” man less trouble than when, beneath its protection,
he predicted the coming collapse of B.H. North Central,
a couple of years or so ago. The prophecy was later on
repeated, along with a demand to know why the death
was postponed. The directors have at last come to the
conclusion that they don’t know. “ There are now only
69,253 shares held by shareholders,” the report just issued
says, “the balance having been forfeited.” (There are
150,000 shares in the co., which, therefore, owns more
than half of itself.) And as it is becoming'more and more
difficult to extract calls, shareholders will be asked to
throw it up. The case is hopeless, anyhow. It was a
long-shot in the beginning, and it got longer and longer
as every foot of driving awl sinking proved that the lode
wasn't there. The co.’s best asset is a locked-up deposit
of over £2OOO.

Centrifugal Pump, which has given good results in
Victoria in treating wash so poor that even Chinamen
could not live by it. The cost of dealing with ordinary
dirt, under fair conditions, by the 12in. Jennings pump
(which, with 130 indicated horse-power, will lift 7 tons of
sand or gravel and 6700 gals, water per minute to a height

The Mt. Lyell Comstock Copper Co.’s pro-
spectus has aroused the wrath of London Financial News.
Capital, a modest half-million. The vendors are selling
their property for £400,000 in £1 shares, talk of taking
up 30,000 of the 50,000 issued, and ask the public to sub-
scribe for 20,000. Probably, at some later date, the re-
served 50,000 “ will be offered.” The concern seems to be
running in common with the N. Lyell. Same bank, same
secretary, and some of the same directors. “Ready,
economical, and efficient means of transit” by the N.
Lyell railway is anticipated. Also remarked that the N.L.
“ has intimated its willingness to smelt the company’s
ores, to the extent that its furnaces are available for the
purpose, at 10 per cent, over cost-price.” How nice to
have a wet-nurse like this! The reservation, “to the
extent that its furnaces are available,” may prove awk-
ward. At present the Comstock doesn’t seem to have
any great quantity of good ore to smelt. What it has got
was found by accident. The unusual bush-fires of last
year revealed the lode. That of N. Lyell was disclosed
by the cutting of a Govt, road through the property.

From Tasmania : The North Lyell Co. has built
a steamer specially for steeplechasing over the Macquarie
bar. She is 310 ft. long, carries 800 tons, and runs 14
knots. The description doesn’t say how high she can
jump or how far, but it is believed on the West Coast
there is some new plan for putting Dunlop tyres on her
keel, so when she bumps on the bar she’ll be lifted right
through Hell’s Gates into the harbor. Will write you
again when she’s wrecked next winter.

The Mt. Lyell Co. is sending forward a large
quantity of blister copper to catch the high values on the
London and New York markets. Exactly what is being
done by every copper-producing country all the world
over. There are places in N.S.W. where men could live
by wheeling picked copper ore from old abandoned
dumps, or from scratchings in high-grade copper veins.
Old mines will be worked under new methods. The
supply will be greatl.y increased unless it should hap-
pen that one of the great mines—of which there are but a
few—should give out ; in which event it would take
many little ones to make up the deficiency. Consump-
tion is going up by leaps and bounds —caused chiefly by
electrical development and the activity of ship-building
yards. Interested persons all talk of copper going ana
keeping still higher—nobody predicts its collapse, be-
cause it is nobody’s business. The chances seem to be
that it will long remain in the region of £7O.

Because The Bulletin admires the Critic
(London) it seriously counsels that paper to cease attempt-
ing to advise correspondents as to what they should do
with stock in mines thousands of miles away. Impossible
to always tip correctly, and there is more grief over one
false tip, however honestly given, than joy over 99 of the
other kind. One case in point, Dec. 31. The Critic : “I
do not recommend a purchase of either Anacondas or Mt.
Lyells at present prices. They will probably go lower.”
Since that tip was given, Mt. Lyells have advanced 30 per
cent. ; doubtless Anacondas have also gone well up with
the price of copper.

Castlemaine gold successes lately have softened
the heart of Lansell, who hitherto has had little to show
for his investments in that district outside the Francis

the first manifestation of the softening.
About six weeks ago Vic. Minister of Mines

object lesson in “new alluvial” mining enterprise, and
said he was as proud of it as though he had been a share-

William Orr, one of the Mt. Lyell founders and a
Brokenhillionaire, reports the finding of a copper deposit
60 miles south of Cloncurrv on which he has secured 500 a.
and already has some 30 men at work opening it up.
Published in Melb. that he is associated with Schlapp.
Chillagoe having eaten the heart out of the Bananaland
copper boom, Cloncurry, rich as it is known to be in
copper, must give the public breathing-time. Easier to
find copper deposits in the far north of that province than
money to work them and railways to reach them.

Efforts to galvanise the many wholly or par-
tially abandoned Australian tin-fields have mostly col-
lapsed. The higher the price has mounted (it has ad-
vanced 60 per cent, in nine months) the less inclined men
with money have felt to lay out large sums in machinery,
because the more certain it has been that the up-move-
ment has a big gamble for a main-spring. Producers with
going concerns reap the harvest; they can mine and sell.
ut there will be a burst boom and an overloaded market
before at present unequipped mines can get going. And
it is all the more unsatisfactory because the natural
tendency of the market was distinctly upward, and from
£7O to £BO seemed a likely normal figure.

“ Unemployed ” writes despairingly from the
Boulder under date 9 2/’99:— 1 “ Dear Bulletin.—l chal-
lenge anyone to show a worse state of affairs than this in
the East. Every day the big mines here are simplv be-
sieged by men looking for work ; the bosses have had so
many applications that they keep out of sight as much
as possible. The shifts go on at 8, 4 and midnight, and
men are sitting and standing around in dozens waiting
for hire; some even roll up at midnight to see if they
can get a start. One day, walking over the old alluvial
workings between Hannan’s and here, I saw something
new : an elderly woman with a shaker. She was in a hole
about Dit. deep, throwing the wash to the surface. She
got out as I came up and said her husband and two boys
were out of work, and after they had been the round of
the mines they would come back and spend the rest of
the day on the alluvial; last fortnight they bad got
4dwts. Talk about depression ! Everything seems to be
going to the devil fast —bailiffs everywhere. There is now
a benevolent society in Kalgoorlie for the deserving poor.
And this is one of the richest gold-producing countries
in the world ! God bless foreign capital.”
Another solution of the sulphide problem is
making- a way for itself in London under the name of the
Sulphides Reduction Co. Works were started at lilack-
friars, and extended as the process developed ; after-
wards new works were erected in South Wales, an 1 it, is
now claimed that the climax of a series of successes has
been reached—that, even the sulphate-of-zinc solution is
converted directly into merchantable oxide of zinc by a
cheap and simple method requiring no chemicals what-
ever. Claimed that by this process refractory sulphide
ores can be treated as they come from the mines in a
blast furnace, with about the same quantity and kinds of
fluxes and fuel used in smelting ordinary lead ores. This
obviates the hitherto expensive adjuncts contingent on
roasting, etc., prior to smelting, such as crushing and re-
crushing, after-roasting, leaching with chemical so'ution,
bricketing, or the use of alkaline fluxes,or the application
of electricity, all of which have generally proved too
expensive for the treatment of sulphide ores. Rights
have been sold to a French syndicate, and a contract has
been made by “ an influential group of Australian capital-
ists ”to form a co. with £50,000 working capital. A con-
signment of 100 tons sulphide ore has been forwarded to
the works by the Mt. Reid Co., Tas., to test the process.

Mephan Ferguson, engineer, &c., of Melbourne,
Adelaide, and Perth, the sole agent in Australia for J. and
E. Hall's patent carbonic anhydride refrigerating and
ice-making machinery, is at present showing a large stock
of these machines, which have been got ready for the

6cwt. of ice per day has been reduced to £lOO each.
Special prices are quoted for machines to make up to 50
tons of ice. The patent carbonic anhydride system has
been adopted by the Victorian and other Australian
Governments ; also by all the leading steamship com-
panies, meat companies, dairies, and butchers of the

Papuan miners complain that on the Gira and
Mambare fields their native carriers break their agree-
ments, run away, and the Govt, does not punish them.
It seems the police and the carriers are alike (Kiwai hoys),
and that the former induce the latter to bolt. Govt, then
arrests the run-aways, and makes them work (in a very
gentle manner) for the State. In one case a runaway
boy was made a policeman, and the Administrator then
tried (it is alleged) to make the miner who had engaged
the boy pay wages for the time the latter had spent in
Govt, employ.

China is the best market in the world for lead,
and up to the present it has taken certainly 25 per cent,
of the Barrier output. For the current year, savs a re-
liable Bulletin correspondent writing from Shanghai,
there will be a slump in Broken Hill lead, simply because
the Californian people are landing the metal at 4T 10s.
per ton cheaper. The Yankee article, however, is only 88
per cent, lead, but it does for tea-chests, and perhaps
Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Co., who ship the bulk of the
Barrier metal, can get a tip from this.

SOCIETY
N.S.W. Govt, was utterly unable to resist
the strong “society ” influences brought to bear in
favor of a big subsidy to the detachment of Lancers
about to visit England for the purpose of being
“ trained ” with Imperial cavalry. The “train-
ing ” pretext is, of course, a mere excuse ; what
the fine, lumpy young Cornstalks are after is a
gigantic picnic and a fair chance of showing them-
selves off before the English girls. All the train-
ing they really need can be supplied locally and
cheaply by the skilled instructors imported from
England ; but, of course, that would not suit the
shapely young man from Jamberoo, and the scions
of Naice families by whom he is to be officered.
They are all mere volunteers, and when they re-
turn to Australia, the State which has so heavily
subsidised the picnic will have no call whatever on
their services.

A military incident. While the Perma-
nent Artillery rank-and-file, which formed a guard
of honor at the opening of N.S.W. Parliament,
were standing at attention awaiting the Gover-
nor’s arrival, one of the men noticed a half-
smoked cigar lying a few feet away from him.
After a glance round to see if any of the officers
were looking, he took two steps to the front,
picked up the “ bumper,” and, after rolling it in
his handkerchief, tucked it up his sleeve.
A WRONGED HUSBAND.
HIS SPIRITUAL ADVISER: “ Johnson , this is a
disgraceful, shocking way to come home.”
JOHNSON: “ I know it's dishgraceful; hut what's
the good of tryin' to hammer a wife what's been
a strong woman in a circus? Ye couldn't —
hie —do it yersel f!”
The vice-regal display at the opening of
N.S.W. Parliament the other day contrasted
strongly with the opening of the first Responsible
Parliament in the same building. The then
Governor had only two coach horses of his own,
so he sent out and borrowed another two for the
State coach. Determined to have the pageant
perfect, he picked four well-made servant-men of
Govt. House and set them as footmen —two to
walk before the horses and two to stand up behind.
He next found that his coachman, who could
drive two horses, couldn’t drive four, so he took
the livery off him and put it on another driver,
borrowed for the occasion. Govt. House butler
was turned into a hall-porter. Thus on a Thursday
of June, 1856, Responsible Government was in-
augurated in N.S.W. “How we did laugh !”
wrote the Governor’s wife.
* * * *
The Secretary of State wasn't asked about
the propriety of Lady Hampden accepting souvenir
jewels from Sydney women. He lets these things
pass unless asked beforehand, and then he frankly
discountenances the game. It may be ordinarily
assumed that what is given to a Governor’s wife is
given to hubby ; and the Secretary of State has
put it in writing that the prospect of receiving
gifts would have an unhealthy effect on repre-
sentatives of the Crown. When Gov. Denison
was leaving Tasmania for N.S.W., a proposal was
made to present him and his wife with a table
centre-piece. Denison communicated the proposal
to the Secretary of State, with the result that that
official directed him to decline. But Denison re-
solved to get that centre-piece, and started a cor-
respondence which ended up with a reluctant
permit. Among other thrusts Denison put forward
the fact that other occupants of Govt. House had
accepted testimonials without any intervention,
for the reason that they didn’t tell the Secretary
of State beforehand. “ I,” he goes on, “ told you
beforehand. Had I, like the others, said nothing,
you wouldn’t have interfered.”

Governor and Lady Brassey, riding their
gee-gees through Albert Park on the wrong
side of the track, nearly came into collision
with a less exalted equestrian, the other
morning. The aggrieved party looked
around for eye-witnesses of his peril,
but as none were visible he merely
registered a mental resolve to turn
his steed and flee the next time
he spots the vice-regal couple
bearing down upon him. It seems
quite safe to bet that Gov. Brassey
will sooner or later be concerned
in another fall from a horse, his
own or somebody else’s.

The Bulletin last week re-
marked on the fact that the flag
at Govt. House, Sydney, was not
half-masted as a token of respect
to the late French President. It
now appears that His Ex. was not
aware of the decease of President
Faure. Sydney dailies certainly
recorded the fact in their cables,
and devoted leading articles to the subject of
his successor, but it was not until Monday
afternoon, when the French Consul formally com-
municated the news to Lord Hampden, that H.E.
ordered the flag to be lowered !

Chief Justice Madden’s death-sentence on
Radalyski and Tod will, no doubt, be commuted
by Vic. Executive. But a similar sentence, for a
similar offence, was a few years ago sustained by
N.S.W. Executive. Sheridan’s crime, like that
of Radalyski and Tod, was murder by misadven-
ture while performing or attempting to perform an
illegal operation. Justice G. B. Simpson, who
tried Sheridan, held, as C.-J. Madden did, that
the crime was legal murder. No doubt it is legal
murder both in Vic. and N.S.W. But it is not
moral murder anywhere. It is not murder by
intent. Sheridan was the first person executed in
N.S.W. for his particular crime. He will pro-
bably be the last. And it is likely he would not
have been hanged if the character of his previous
doings had been less atrocious —or if so much sen-
sationalism had not surrounded his attempt to
conceal the body of his unlucky patient.

The Dubberke girl, it is reported, is going
to return home to her father and “ reform,” but it
seems doubtful if there is enough reformation
available to suit that eminently hard case. And
what a joyful prospect for the old man to hear
that a girl like that is coming home ! One thing
at least must be said for “ Dr. Bill’s ” girl; she
knows when to come in out of the dust, and the
head under the large red hat is level to the end.
If she had reformed earlier she could hardly have
saved herself by giving her two mates, the deaf
old lady and the respectable house-agent, to the
gallows ; and if she reformed later she might get
involved in another boot-box row in the interim —
perhaps with a worse ending. So she proposes to
become good at exactly the psychological moment
and hang up her seven-league red hat in the parental
hall with a contrite heart. In the latter days of
the trouble there began to be signs that the Dub-
berke was breaking down. There was a tired
look in her saint-like eyes, and her bright, bare
head wobbled a little, and she hung the glaring
hat on the corner of the witness-box with an
unsteady hand while she did her swear. The
crowd took to hooting at the boot-box saint, too,
which probably shook her nerves, and her resi-
dence in a stuffy, airless gaol, where she was kept
for security, was rough on a girl who used to wave
her feathered head-gear in the evening air, and re-
fresh herself with a look at the passingchappie. The
advertisement kept her up for a while, but when
it wore out the fading of Dr. Bill’s pansy-blossom
was very marked.

“F.” in defence of damsel Dubberke:—
As common sense had surmised from the first, Thekla
Dubberke, the practical young person, was able to give a
not-at-all-inhuman explanation of her alleged regret that
she didn’t “ rip open ” the body of Mabel Ambrose to
prevent it from floating down the Yarra. Her friend,
Dr. Gaze, told Thekla that the body would be floated by
its gases, whereas an incision made in the body would
have made the Yarra burial a safe transaction. Conse-
quently, when the corpse had come to the surface, and
Thekla Dubberke saw that she had wasted a lot of trouble
and nerve-power in her attempt to avoid punishment for
somebody else’s crime, she knew in her big undisciplined
heart that, having done so much, she would have gone
so far as to cut into the corpse had she possessed at the
time the knowledge which Dr. Gaze afterwards imparted
CURSE ITEM.
SHE: “And what is the first thing to
do when you puncture?”
HE: “Swear!”
to her. And she spoke her thought like “ one woman in
a million.” If she said “ I would have ripped her open,
it was because she was not “ quite the lady.” Madame
Olga, who had hoped to find salvation in Dubberke’s
aid, is quite the lady, and it was she who first shuddered
at Dubberke’s unladylike courage, and told -her she was
one in a million. The compliment was well-deserved.
Thekla Dubberke, but for her excessive animalism, might
have been a devoted friend and valuable wife to any man.
* * * *
Some Boot-trunk trial items :
The Crown made a dead set at all jurymen of youthful
appearance called for the Boot-trunk trial, while prisoner
Tod, practically the only occupant of the dock who exer-
cised the right of challenge—for Dr. Gaze called but once
—scratched no less than 10 men, all of whom looked old
or sanctimonious. The result was a middle-aged lot, the
majority being in the neighbourhood of 40, though Tod
got home with two 25-year-olders and the Crown scored
with one greybeard of 50. Frank Best, well-known as a
footballer and racing cyclist a few years back, was fore-
man. In all lust-and-blood prosecutions the official
tendency is to fill the jury-box with old and sapless men.
Gaol life told terribly upon Dubberke, who entered the
box a middle-aged woman with a face of ashen grey—a
hideous caricature of the bright, rosy-cheeked school-girl
who so blithely confessed to so many awful things at the
inquest. Her iron nerve had also become rusty, and
while her demeanour at the inquest stands as a marvel of
female evidence, she was but a moderate success as a wit-
ness at the trial, and simply “ not in it ” with Dora
Bromley, the woman who submitted to bogus illegal
operations in order to trap the abortionists.
“So did Madam,” was Dubberke’s only retort when
Barrister Levy questioned her re an occasion when she
danced in “ the altogether ” for the delectation of a trio
of grave, middle-aged business men. This incident was
made public solely by the girl’s talking too much, for she
retailed it with gusto and additional unpublishable detail
to certain people who were lunching at the Morgue dur-
ing the inquest. In connection with the same story, the
absolute limit of Dubberke’s modesty was ascertained.
“And were they all married men?” asked one grinning
scribe. Thekla drew herself up insulted. “Of course,”
she responded with hauteur ; “you don’t think I’d have
done such a thing in the presence of single men.”
A special gallery had to be set apart for the women
visitors to the trial, and, judging by their appearance,
the fair damsels who attended—for, like everybody in the
case, they were mostly young —belonged rather to the
Naieesttlian to the ordinary class of girl. Hats which
cost three and four guineas were in evidence, and on the
adjournment, long, trailing skirts—the infallible test of
aristocracy in woman—were prominent. They all took
the evidence smiling, grinned at the references to
the nude revels of Thekla and Madam, gazed with
the bored look born of familiarity at the instru-
ments produced, and obviously kept a keen
look-out for points watching the manipulation
of Madam's “ darling little battery,” guaranteed
infallible, and taking as a chestnut Dr. Neild’s evi-
dence of the uselessness of a certain drug. The
alleged beauty of Thekla Dubberke caused a certain thrill
of jealousy, for no Melb. woman can now swear that she
has not shared her husband or her boy with the in-
formant ; and on all sides one heard the snort of disdain
—•“ Pooh, 1 don’t think she’s a bit pretty.”

Seeing that the Queensland authorities’
offer of £lOOO has not induced anyone to inform
upon the Gatton murderers, what if the money’s
worth of rum was offered instead ? Rum was the
great inducement to inform in Botany Bay’s early
days. Government orders were regularly posted
in public places stating, “ Whereas such and such
an outrage has happened, the Governor will be
pleased to reward anyone giving information
with ”200r50 or 100 gallons of rum. If the in-
former were a participator in the crime he was
given a free pardon, so that he could drink the
liquor at leisure. Pals in crime, able to withstand
the temptation of money, were said to succumb to
the promised largesse of rum, and ringleaders in
outrages feared the seduction of that liquor more
than all the other weapons of society.
• * • *
The Gatton mystery isn’t quite dead yet;
there is still a wriggle in it when it is trodden
on. The news now comes along that the
police have murky suspicions concerning
the swagman that Wilson spoke to on
the road, when he was wheeling his
crippled son into Brisbane. They reckon
that, if the swagman can only be found,
he may prove a very valuable link in
that chain of sand, one end of which
is nowhere in particular, while there never
was any other end at all. Of course, it
would be hard for any man to walk many
miles along any road without meeting a swag-
man ; but it certainly would be curious if it
turned out that the swagman hailed by sus-
pected-murderer Wilson was identical with sus-
pected-murderer Burgess. The Bulletin pre-
sumes that that is what the poor police are hinting
lit)*
Dear Bulletin. —l refrained from sending
you my little say concerning the Gatton tragedy
several weeks ago, when the crime was quite
fresh and the police were just beginning
to make up a case against Burgess. My
idea was, is, and always will be (until
it is clearly falsified) that the mur-
derers, two, or three, or more in num-
ber, were local residents well-known
1 to the victims, that there was suffi-
cient suspicion against some, if not
all, of these parties to have justified
their arrest, and that the police
have stubbornly refused to entertain
any but the Burgess theory. The
history of the Gatton scandal thus-
far suggests a conspiracy of silence.
Nothing has leaked out except _ the
vague promise of “ a great surprise,”
which promise, seemingly, was withdrawn
almost as soon as it was made. Anyway, we
have had no hint as to why the great surprise
didn’t come off.—Snorter.

It is but a month or so since the local
papers reproved Judge Hodges for holding
excessively lengthy sittings at Sale (Vic.) Crimi-
nal Court. At Ballarat, the other day, the same
Judge kept his court open during the whole of the
sessions from 9.30 a.m. till 7 p.m. The excuse
continually urged for such discreditable doings is
that press of business compels His Honor’s presence
somewhere else a day or two later. _ But this
excuse won’t stand, for it would be quite easy to
arrange business so that two or, if necessary, three
Judges should be always about the country, leaving
those gentlemen holding court in Melbourne to
grapple with their business a trifle more per-
sistently. One never hears of Hodges, J., holding
court in Melb. up to 7 p.m., nor is His Honor
usually so eager to get to work that he begins
business at 9.30. Ten a.m. to 4 p.m. usually
suffices the metropolitan Judge.

“H.F. ” discourses on “ the Blood Atone-
ment ” :
During- the few short months that have passed since
Lisson ran amok in that Sydney tobacconist-shop, an un-
exampled list of murders, with a revenge-motive, have
gladdened the heart of the average newspaper-reader ;
for, without doubt, next best to committing or seeing
murder is to read of it—the appeal is to the same senti-
ment. And hearing of murderous deeds begets emula-
tion, conditions favoring—and the passing summer has
been very favoring indeed, a real gory season, illus-
trating once again that heat and blood are inexorably
mixed. There seems little doubt that when the ther-
mometer wanders amongst the 90’s a certain type of
brain begins to see red, and to long for the swish of steel
in the innards of its adversary or the soothing scrunch of
his cerebellum under a club. Even the mild Briton,
whom centuries of fog and frost have reduced to the mere
booting and jumping-on. of his missus, warms into genial
ferocity under the Austral sun ; and, as he will probably
keep on warming, the prospect ahead for the daily press
is cheering. Perhaps there is no milder-mannered man
than your modern European Hebrew, yet in his old-time
Asiatic lair he Kitchenered the Hittite and Jebusite most
industriously, while, as for the Amalekite, did he not
lay him out in thousands before breakfast? This car-
nivorous blood-thirst seems innate and twisted into the
most secret fibres of us. No nation ever counts for much
till its baptism of war; all the talents are born in the
shambles of the battle-field—poetry, patriotism, heroism
—and the national heart warms for centuries at the
thought of its great day of gore. And, up to date, blood
has been found the one panacea for national differed.-,;*
tribal differences, or nigger differences, arbitration being
cat-lap and enervating. This is instinct, and, in a general
way, instinct knows what it’s about. Blood, and plenty
of it, seems to be the approved damp-course for the
national structure, and no cement of moral-suasion-and-
lemonade has so far kept out the wet. All which conclu-
sions point to some great moral truth, which, unfortu-
nately, the writer has mislaid. Just here his eye
catches another heading, “Wife murder and suicide!”
and he is uncertain whether it is the third this week or
the fifth, and he looks at the glass in the shade and sees
101° and vows he will read no further news reports till the
mercury is amongst the 70’s. Owing to unfortunate
heredity, the scribe has had the Malay bred out of him and
the sight of red paint makes him want a drink ; but he
foresees a time when a future Wragge, after serving out
the local .climate, will add: “ The cyclonic disturbance
Nosey-Bob is approaching from Westralia with electric
isobars and much rope. Homicides may be looked for on
the Victorian seaboard, with scattered suicides in the
interior. N.S.W.: Heavy brutal assaults eastward by the
Dividing Range ;in the Riverina, light hangings. Queens-
land : Violent blood-letting on coast, with tropical fall of
stiffs in Northern Territory.”
* * * *
The real reason of Victorian officialdom’s
anxiety to secure Royal pardon for Detective
Dungey and his alleged co-conspirator, Dora
Bromley, may not be so much consideration for
the feelings of those persons named as fear of a
terrible sequel to the prosecution. For if convictions
were recorded against Dungey and Bromley, it is
quite unlikely that the prosecution would let the
matter rest there —it would probably charge cer-
tain very high officials with complicity in the
conspiracy. The spectacle of an attorney-general
and possible Supreme Court judge sitting behind
the spikes in company with the handsome Chief-
Commissioner Chomley and getting two years
hard, or being let off under the First Offenders’
Act, has harrowed the feelings of the Vic. Cabinet
down to its spinal marrow.

“What is the dominant thought in the
mind of a prisoner under sentence of death ?” is a
question asked in print the day after Briggs, the
Petersham slayer, was sentenced by Judge Cohen.
The general opinion of those who have given
attention to such questions is that men keep
™ ,n king mostly that their trial was bungled.

At the A.N.A. Conference at Port Fairy
on 7th March, there will be a shindy over
that pretty little gamble, the Association’s art-
union. Some enthusiastic Natives are going in
vigorously for its abolition, on the ground that
planting the banner of “ .£lOOO for a shilling ” in
every pub. in Victoria isn’t the best way to raise
ifoung Australia to a higher national life. Of
course, it s all for charity. Why, the charities get
nearly a third of the cash put in ! —and the visiting
Premiers get champagne and turkey at the ban-
quet on i oundation Day, and a lot of deserving
.Natives get billets as travelling inspectors looking
after the sale of tickets in the country. But these
latter considerations have no weight with the
board of directors. They only want to elevate
Young Australia’s Ideals. They are only doing
things in a small way now, but give them time
and they’ll yet beat Tattersall Adams at his own
game.

In about 104 districts of N.S.W. where
there are Govt, vaccinators no vaccinations are re-
ported for the past year ! Of 36,212 infants born
in the province during 1898 only 1’97 per cent,
were vaccinated. But once let smallpox get a
* air start, and the whole population will be
tumbling over one another to get at the vaccinator.
There are bitter wails from doctors wbo
have gone to Westralian mining camps to prac-
tise. They complain that everybody subscribes to
a fund, membership of which costs Is. per week
and entitles to hospital treatment, indoor and out-
door, for the subscriber’s family as well as him-
self. The Govt, subsidises the payments, and, in
many cases, makes extra
allowances. One for-
merly very
well-known

down in
his old age to
the medical-
officership of a

demanded. And things were
made so sultry that the old-fashioned practitioner
and the new-fashioned practice soon parted com-

Vic. Rechabites’ meeting at Bendigo re-
cently sent up a soulful wail for a decent drunk.
“ What is a teetotaller t 5 drink ? ” was the sad
query of a dry convention in an arid land.
‘‘Water is full of microbes, ginger-ale nobody
likes, and other temperance drinks are far from
palatable ! ” cried one strong man in his agony.
“It is all very well to say ‘don’t drink alcoholic
beverages,’” moaned another, “but what can we
offer in their place ? ” Wliat the Rechabites want
is an alcohol that won’t alcoholise, a beer that
won’t booze, and they won’t be happy till they
get it, and probably they won’t be happy then,
because it is probably that nip of the Essence of
Future Punishment in a drink that touches the
spot and fills the want. This tearful outbreak
satisfies The Bulletin that the teetotaller as a
man is not different—he only differs.

A beautiful sidelight on N.S.W. bobby-
dom :
Dear Bulletin.— Anent your remarks on the apparent
gross miscarriage of justice in the case of one Holt at
Adelaide recently. Some time ago a tramp called at my
residence and asked to be given some old woollen under-
clothing—he had suffered much from, and was in terror
of, rheumatism. We gave him some things accordingly.
Next evening’s paper announced the arrest of this man
for having in his possession goods “ reasonably suspected
to have been stolen.” The magistrate sentenced him to
one month’s hard, notwithstanding that the poor tramp
gave the name of the street, and indicated the precise
locality of the house where he had received the garments.
The police neither troubled to verify his statement nor
gave him an opportunity to do so! lat once brought
the matter under the notice of the authorities, and the
man was reluctantly discharged after “doing” about
four days.—K.L.W.

Judge Docker, commenting on a local

on the question of unenviable notoriety.
Montaigne tells us that :— “lt is
unjust that one old father, battered
with age, and with one foot in the
grave, should enjoy alone in his chim-
ney corner the substance which would
suffice for the maintenance and ad-
vancement of many children.” This is
probably the view taken by the rela-
tives of Joseph Taafe, aged 70, who
was recently sent to gaol (Vic.) be-
cause “ the recent regulations for the
boarding-out by the State of indigent,'
infirm, and aged persons do not apply
to those who have relatives in a position
to support them.”

“B. ” : The tragedies in our back
lanes are becoming daily more frequent.
Yesterday morning writer heard three
children moaning pathetically inside a
windowless house with a broken door.
An early crowd surged near the case-
ment. “ What’s matter ? ” asked one.
“ Gord help ’em ! ” came from a fervid
carrier with a pipe. “ More Gat-
ton ! ” A red-haired enthusiast
flung open the window-frame.
“Children, children, what’s
wrong?” And the young voices
sobbed, “Oh!oh ! oh ! Our Bill
got up early and ate all the
breakfast! ”
J. F. Deegan, the Shake-
spearian-whisky vendor, in his recent
evidence before Vic. Habitual Drunk-
ards Board, pointed out that all high-
class crime is perpetrated by men of ab-
stemious habits. He instanced a num-
ber of well-known burglars and robbers,
but, strange to say, never touched on
the Melb. land-boom and bank-smash,
which so vividly showed up the true
characters of canting teetotal roguedom.

P.M.G. Duffy says that the employes of

office picnic. An awful waste of gratitude.
Half the people in Melbourne and a lot of them
in the country curse Duffy’s picnic with a black
and bitter curse every time it comes round. Their
individual objections placed end to end would
stretch from Melbourne to Sorrento, where the
festive employes are canoodling and otherwise
enjoying themselves on the back beach. But,
collectively, the sufferers bear the inconvenience
like a lamb. Don’t they even bear Duffy like a
lamb? Nothing short of an earthquake could
provoke a hearty unanimous protest from the
public of Victoria. They haven’t it in them to
meet together and kick up a row about the action
of any ruling power. Last Xmas they were cut
off from postal service for three solid days. Yet
Duffy still lives and draws his salary.

Age heading : “ Serious accident. Several

About time that that Superior Person,
man, left off his joke about the woman of 37 who
swears she is 28; he does it himself. A
whole crowd of the applicants for old-age
I nsions in Maoriland, not having their
nirth certificates available, bring up their
marriage record as collateral evidence.
And there are awful discrepancies about
these records as regards both sexes. One
male ancient claimed to be 65—just the
qualified age—and he certainly looked
every year of it; but his marriage cer-
tificate showed him to be only 55. Ex-
plained that he had wedded a young
wife who didn't like frisky old wrecks,
so he had understated his age. He had
no other evidence, so the court reluc-
tantly told him that, unless he could
find some fresh testimony, he would
have to wait ten years for his pension,
and the old one tottered out to repent on the
pavement.

The murder of one gunner by another
(Anglo-Indian) in Queenscliff (Vic.) appears to be
in all-fours with the thousand-and-one such cases
which occur in India, where the heat makes of the
plain, harmless, unnecessary Tommy Atkins a
helpess homicide: “Danny Deever,” hanged in
Kipling’s ballad, did exactly the same motiveless,
inexplicable sort of murder as Pollock, of Queens-
cliff. There is not an Indian barracks-dormitory
but has its story of the private who snatched up a
carbine one night and shot another soldier—some-
times his best friend—for no apparent reason.
Pollock seems to have killed the unfortunate
Briner solely because the latter doubted his sin-
cerity when he said He would “ shoot a man for less
than sixpence.”

N.S.W. civil servants have again been cir-

tween Devil and deep sea. Owing to the present
insolvent condition of the fund and the wording
of the circular, it seems sensible to withdraw;
but then, again, contributors of 20 years’ standing
find it advisable to continue. Many of the juniors
have withdrawn.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
, T _ Sydney, February 28,1899.
My Dear Myek—
Instead of going overland to Melbourne on
Wednesday for a few days with the Brasseys, the
Hampdens will wait till Sunday and leave then
by the Oruba. Several Sydney people, who were
looking forward joyously to journeying per same
boat, are manifesting their sympathy by fearing
the voyage will now be very gloomy.
Lady Hampden spent most of last week saying
good-bye to her pet charities. At Lewisham hos-
pital she gave each of the children a toy, and took
a personal farewell of every patient. Her interest
in our charities has always been genuine and grace-
ful, and her Ex. has never thrown moral lessons
at the sick and afflicted—with the exception of her
own sweet smile.
Lady Hampden appears at her sweetest when
amongst the University-women. Accompanied
by Miss Dorothy Brand, the president of the
University-women’s Society took tea for the last
tune at the University, on Friday, 24th Feb. A
simple present of Gordon’s, Lawson’s, and Pater-
son’s poems was given to Lady Hampden as a
souvenir, and the recipient expressed much delight
at the modern authors’ books, reading and dis-
cussing some of the poems straight-away. The
University-women don’t look forward pleasurably
to the advent of a bachelor Governor.
Sydney’s farewell to Lady Hampden was a
little solemn, a little slow. All the arrangements
were excellently carried out, and a musical pro-
gramme that swiftly ran along to its close with-
out pausing for one single encore ought to give
Lady Hampden one good impression to carry
away among many bad ones. Mrs. Boesen and
Miss Woolley took charge of the music. Little
Celia Dampier played with more capability than
at her recital; Hetty Holroyd sang “The Song
that Reached My Heart, ” and Miss Morven and
Mr. Burns Walker warbled at intervals; and if
nobody listened much they might have done so
without hurting themselves.
But the real, earnest business of the evening
was the address, flanked by the diamond pendant,
bestowed on Her Ex. by Mrs. W. R. Campbell
and Mrs. Mat Harris. For once, the soulfulness
of an address didn’t get lost in a maze of flowers
of speech, although the sentiment looked a little
shaky that spoke of “wishing you bon voyage,
which we do with much regret.” But the real
feeling was evidently there, as Lady Hampden
was seen wiping her eyes afterwards—l didn’t
notice her wipe her ears after listening to that
Town Hall English. Her Ex. made a nice little
speech in return, and wore her diamond pendant
with its three canary diamonds all the evening.
There were more than the usual number ot
heart-burnings over the costly baubles aforemen-
tioned. Mrs. Blank thought Mrs. Dash “took too
much upon herself in ordering a jeweller to send
her the presents to inspect privately,” while Mrs.
Asterisk opined that “ they were a pair of fools to
present anything at all to the Governor’s wife.”
Lady Hampden had previously been asked if she
would accept an offering from the citizens of
Sydney, and much surprise is professedly felt that
she answered in the affirmative. From Lady
Carington onwards vice-regal ladies have always
sternly resisted these blandishments. But let
these advocates of high principles console them-
selves with the thought that, as there has been
none before, so there will be none after to wring
the purses of hard-up Geebungs. The new
Governor brings no wife to be gushed over, and
after Earl Beauchamp’s reign Sydney is to fall
down and die—according to the Anti-Billites.
Two pretty pearl necklets were the mementos
for the Hons. Alice and Dorothy Brand. These
were presented by Mrs. J. T. Thompson and
Mrs. B. F. Marks. Then somebody tried to
squeeze a few last pearls from Lord Hampden,
pointing out that this would be his last chance of
casting them before Sydney Society ; but His Ex.
declined gently to add one other vice-regal expres-
sion to Lady Hampden’s well-turned little speech.
After the summer’s cottons, the gathering looked
bright and smart as far as frocks go. At the same
time, what a falling-off was there ! I shall not
tell you how many of these gowns threatened to
collapse, and were only persuaded to hold up by
thin strips of sleeves that didn’t look half strong
enough for such Atlas-like labors. Nearly every-
one wore her hair well on top, with a knot of color
beside it. Lady Hampden rather aided and
abetted her reputation as a philanthropist by ap-
pearing in a somewhat styleless blouse-and-skirt
costume—white and black jet blouse and long
black satin skirt. In her hair was a diamond
tiara, but on the whole her frocking for the fare-
well was, appropriately, not at all festive. Mrs.
Willie Mitchell bloomed beautifully with a wreath
of roses round her knees. The upper part of her
white satin frock was covered with silver tinsel
gauze, but when it came to this bank of pink roses
it burst out at the knees into a rebellion of innu-
merable little white frills with black edges,
that ran in ruffled rolls to the floor. Pink
roses on the slippery corsage, and diamonds
in the hair, completed a frantically - Frenchy
toilette. Mrs. Lovely was one of the most
Srsistently - focussed guests of the evening.
er marvellous diamond tiara and necklace shed
a green light over onlookers that quite supported
the divine Sarah’s idea that diamonds are not
becoming—to other people. Everyone in the hall
took a turn at private inspection of these jewels,
after which the pretty wearer’s brocade and
Maltese laces were mere details. Two very
original gowns in black and turquoise reproduced
each other down to the eyelet holes. These were
worn by two smart Society women who are both
original and particular in the matter of clothes.
The story goes that one wrote to a friend in Lon-
don some time ago and asked her to choose and
send her out a smart evening frock; while the
other recently brought out her very special gown
from a well-known London dressmaker. And the
great, high, awful gods arranged that the twin
frocks should both appear in public for the first
time at a gathering in Sydney Town Hall, there-
by slaying each other dead.
Other noticeable frocks and wearers were Mrs.
Mylius in a snappy turquoise necklet and white
silk frock, veiled with crepe-de-cliine embroidered
with violets; Mrs. Scot-Skirving in a white silk
princess robe ; Mrs. W. R. Campbell in grey-and-
white figured silk ; Miss Darlev in black and jet,
looking a little worn after the anxiety of her
sister’s illness.
A cable has come telling of the death of Lord
and Lady Hampden’s younger son, who had been
sent to England to school. The sad news takes
the color out of what I have just written ; but let
it pass.
Everyone remembers, with a kindly feeling,
little fair-haired Geoffrey Brand. He was
a bright little boy in an h]ton suit who always
seemed to be getting much fun out of his visit to
Sydney. Pneumonia following on a chill carried
him off quite suddenly, and Monday’s cable an-
nouncing his death was a dreadful shock to his
people. The citizens’ banquet to Lord Hampden
arranged for that night was abandoned, and the
S revisions distributed among different charities.
'Ut surely H.E. might, under the circum-
stances, have been spared the long and tedious
succession of busy-body, self-advertising, clerical
and aldermanic deputations carrying farewell
addresses in their hands, that poured in on him
all Monday afternoon.
Florence Schmidt wrote last week to a friend in
Sydney who had been waiting news of the
soprano’s doing for a long time. Imagine the
friend’s disgust to find the whole of the letter
written in Italian, which might have been Sanscrit
as far as she was concerned. After struggling
vainly with it, she copied out a few sentences that
seemed to be repeating something urgent, and
carried them to her music-master. “Oh, that,”
he said, “that means ‘it is very, very cold.’
And that —that means ‘ You are so hot in Austra-
lia, we are so cold here.”’ Interesting information
to come all the way from Italy concerning a singer
of whom Sydney is anxious to hear news.
There is no dressing to speak of in “ After
Dark,” at the Lyceum. As far as clothes go, the
hero falls further away from grace than ever;
which is a pity, because the cut of a hero’s clothes
means as much to the little girls in the gallery as
it does to the opera boxes or the d.c. A mere
woman can’t feel the real, genuine shudder when
the hero cried, “God ! what shall I do? ” out of a
turn-down collar. Nor can a perfect thrill shoot
through her soul when he cast a tight coat-sleeve
with a scanty rim of cuff round the heroine’s
waist. Of course, this is only a woman’s griev-
ance and isn’t likely to be remedied, but it does
seem hard to the gallery when the hero is a real
live lord. Two slim young actresses wear their
wardrobes very gracefully in this play—Miss
Madge Hope and Miss Burdett. The latter suffers
untold agonies in a brown dress with a leather
belt. It was an ordinary-enough dress to look at.
Yet she wore it when she jumped into the Thames
for suicide, was fished out in it dripping, lay in
its wet folds for a fortnight, and turned up in it,
in a later act, alive !
Pretty Miss Annie Kerr, whose auburn hair
contrasted so well with her pale-blue frock in the
private-rehearsal scene of “ The White Heather,”
nas left the stage for good. Her elder sister,
Adele Kefr, is still appearing with Bland Holt, in
Melbourne, but Annie found the life too trying.
Another young Sydney embryo actress, Miss Hope
Mayne, has apparently allowed that North-easter
feeling to overshadow her natural talent.
In the sale season, just dying, a new female
game has been played too heavily. Women go to
these sales, and get carried away by the sight of
so many things going at something-three-farthings
(always three farthings ! which means a penny if
you’re only taking one). The shoppers buy fairly
carefully at first, and pay for all their purchases.
That goes on till the purse is empty. Then, unable
to tear themselves away from the sight of all these
gaudy goods going for nothing, they begin to
order, even more recklessly, on the pay-on-delivery
system. While buying tliusly, and not paying,
there’s nothing that can’t, and won’t, be theirs.
But next day, when the fever abates and the fasci-
nations of the fair are away in the distance, the
cart arrives with the unpaid-for goods. Then
comes the jar. They have no money for the carter,
and, unable to meet the bills, they send out word
that the goods won’t “suit,’’and let them all go
back to the shop. The cost of carriage, time of
wrapping-up parcels, time taken up in choosing
goods, and cost of return freight must make up
something so like loss to the shops who indulge
customers with c.0.d., that I hear some big estab-
lishments are dropping the system altogether.
She may be a product of these sales; anyway,
you can’t go anywhere in Sydney without meeting
the following vision. A hat bowed down in front
and behind, covered with roses, and calling itself
“Trelawney of the Wells.” A piece of black
velvet round a lean, round, brown, white, or
yellow throat, as the case may be; a little
flowered muslin, or light silk blouse. A
black velvet waist-belt, with one or half-a-
dozen steel buckles laid on at intervals about
it. A white pique skirt, with the cords running
up-and-down. A cerise parasol; a pair of white
gloves. After the 99th repetition, these images
pall a little. There never was such a place as
Sydney for starting and keeping to one style.
I have received from W. T. Waters and Co. an
autumn fashion-book, illustrated with pictures of
the coming season’s drapery and millinery.
Waters’ hats are always desirable. They seem to
have some particularly smart imported ones for
winter-wear. Hordern Bros, in Pitt-street also
send their latest shopping-guide. Their dress-
Elates show some very fetching race, walking, and
all gowns, and I see that “ The Beauchamp ”
has already begun to be worked for all
it’s worth in fashions. By the way, there’s
a distinct philosophy in fashion - plates.
There’s “ The Elaine,” which is, of course, a
chiffon ball-gown in spotless white ; “the Sirdar,”
a decisive coat and skirt that wouldn’t hinder its
wearer from taking action; “ The Trixey,” a cun-
ning little braided promenade costume with an
enticing red vest and a row of gold buttons ; and
the very “Beauchamp” itself, wherein moire
antique and velvet and jet and fals of cream lace
and cascades of velvet, lined with cream satin,
are all brought in to glorify the pattern’s name-
sake.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Two smart Melb. girls are due for matrimony
next week. Miss Maud Keogh, a pretty member
of a gilded family living at Elsternwick, intends
to capture on Monday (March (i) cultured Cyril
Ullathorne —a beau of a stock boasting blue blood
and brains. And, on Wednesday, Miss Claudia
Stephen, a bright belle-daughter of the evergreen
Frank Stephen, is to be joined to W. F. Weigall, a
son of that old literary wiseacre, Theyre Weigall.
“The marriage of Miss Madden and Mr. Os-
borne is booked for Wednesday (March 1).
Dean Vance’s daughter is to wed young Dr.
Alsop almost immediately. A recent engage-
ment is that of the N.S. Wales Premier’s
nephew, Alwyn Reid, brother to Mrs. Wallace,
young wife of the elderly hero of the recent
Wallace law-suit.
“The worship of Lucina —goddess of mater-
nity— is fashionable in Melbourne just now.
Several events on which she awaits are among
the fixtures for the forthcoming month. In
Toorak, a versifying journalist is preparing
to trumpet the arrival of an olive branch
with a right royal poetical salute. That
feminine sport, Mrs. Everard Browne, pro-
mises the Chirnside clan her first young hope.
Like the rest of the family, Mrs. B. can’t have
too much knocker-padding, bell-muffling and saw-
dust spread to usher the marvel into the world.
The interesting matron has been brought down
from Colac by easy stages, and installed at a cosy
villa on St. Kilda road. It is recorded among the
chronicles of the times how the joy-bells rang out
over the safe arrival on terra jinna of the heir and
hope of Percy Chirnside. Andrew C. is the only
one of the brothers who has ne’er a bonnie bairn.
He has been married three or four years, his wife
being one of the rich Sumners of ‘ Stoney Park,’
Brunswick.
“ Touching the infant topic, Ernest Raleigh has
just been made a father, and the W. R. Wilson
grandparents of the new arrival are as happy as if
they had backed another winner. Baby Raleigh
is unhappily a girl, so she can’t very well be
christened Bobadil.
“That local gaol-surgeon who listened to the
confidences of one of his charges and did not seal
his lips subsequently, began life as a parson, it
seems. A son of his is engaged to a Melbourne
Judge’s daughter.
“Mrs. Brough, as Madame Sans-Gene, nightly
provoked a smile when she said to the officious
shoe-maker trying-on her court-pumps— ‘ Bless the
man ! does he want to see up to my knee ? ’ Acci-
dents will happen. At the Princess’ revival of
Sans-Gene the energetic tradesman, whisking his
customer’s skirt just a shade too high, treated the
audience to an unintentional glimpse of neat white
frill. The unconscious wearer probably wondered
why people laughed so much more heartily than
usual. The culprit mummer looked desperately
guilty. Pity his plight if any mischief-maker
broke the news of his blunder later on to Sans-
Gene ! Few actresses shrink from strutting the
stage in boy’s doublet and hose. Skirt-dancers
revel in filmy swirls of lacy nether flounces. But
it’s a different matter to accidental display of un-
glorified, utilitarian, dessous garments. Frightful
traditions survive from the crinoline period, when
nervous spinsters dismounting from vehicles were
continually catching their ‘ hoops,’ and hanging
suspended.
“ Did you ever hear tell of the Sunday-school
teacher who fell through the shaky organ-loft floor
during service but was wedged half-way down and
saved from instant destruction by a jam of steel
and whalebone ? The parson, casting one startled
fiance aloft at the sky-fallen apparition, red-
annelled to its ankles, spread his arms over his
cowed congregation as he thundered menacingly,
‘ Whosoever looketh up, may his eyes be withered

“Katharine Hardy, the pretty Maoriland girl
who was with the Broughs on their Indian tour
and before, has had enough of the theatrical stage,
and is booked for a leading part in the comedy of
matrimony. The juvenile lead in the co. is also a
Maorilander—a man of commerce. Katharine
Hardy is a girl of many and varied talents, and
should play the part gracefully. When she was
in India a report came along here that she was
dead. But she wasn’t. She has all her obituary
notices by her, as heirlooms.
“At the first glint of ‘One Summer’s Day’
(Feb. 25th), Miss Grace Noble, as a picnic-belle,
in up-to-date English versions of white linen
blouse, piqu4 skirt, and red-banded sailor-hat,
demonstrated by the siiiiilarity of said creations
to local garments that the Vic. girl, with all her
faults, cannot truthfully be described as ‘ Miss
Stick-in-the-mud ! ’ Just those familiar half-roll-
over cuffs and collar, silver-buckled scarlet belt,
skirt fitting closely to wearer’s hips. The only
item not in accordance with prevalent Melb.
methods was the necktie, its ends long enough to
tuck into waist-belt, as worn here aforetime.
“In the current Brough series, actor Lovell
goes into harness whenever a wistful, sensitive,
unsuccessful young lover is called for. Colleague
Carne leaves off eating the bread of idleness
every time the caste includes a masterful, conquer-
ing yvooer. First-named uptilts his chin through-
out in the quaintest way. Maybe, he caught the
trick through apologetically trying not to rumple
fair coadjutors’.curls when timidly proffering un-
welcome stage-caresses.
“ In the present play, Miss Noble’s pink dinner-
frock blushes through a misty cream over-skirt,
the latter hooped with groups of tiny all-round
tucks,_ and plain spaces between. A floating lisse
scarf is drawn through big black corsage-buckle,
and wearer’s wavy brown hair is simply arranged,
rather high on her head.
“Several bouquets spelt welcome to the re-
turned wanderer on Saturday night. Blighted-
lover Lovell was also horticulturally heartened-up.
Towards the last, when he makes great play with
his ’kerchief in the far distance, while his fiancee
transfers her allegiance to the other man in the
foreground, a massive dowager maintained against
all-comers that the mourner was ‘ whitening his
face, ’ so as to look appropriately pale for the im-
pending renunciation. ‘ I’ve tied up a bit o’ Ful-
ler’s earth in the corner of my handkerchief often
enough myself when I’ve been going to a damce
on a not night,’ she said, imperturbably.
“Pearl necklets still adorn decollete women
of all ages and weights. At evening entertain-
ments in hot weather beads sink in and are abso-
lutely lost to view in the creases of fat, moist,
elderly necks. And such cushiony backs as one
sees perspiring publicly these nights ! The naicest
tresses, at present, are very slightly waved, look
beautifully glossy, and coil round in the simplest
way at the back.
“At that ‘ Homes of Hope ’ matinee in the
Bijou (Feb. 25), special attraction was ‘the first
operatic appearance of Mr. Barker,’ the bass-
voiced idol of Metrop. Liedertafel patronesses.
‘ The sea hath its pearls ’ and a concert star gets
his own share of feminine worship. Deep-chested
hero in question, as an amorous operatic viceroy,
was not inconveniently magnetic. Still, had scribe
been 40 years younger, she might have been
thrilled to the point of ‘ cutting off her pig-tail in
sheer desperation and hanging herself up in cold
perspiration.’
“ Clever, pushing Rita, of the Herald, has
again been lecturing, this time in Maryborough
district, and she talks of following up her success
in places less remote from headquarters. Being of
the ‘fine ’ order of women, with an important
mannah, cultivated elocution, and plenty of ideas
at her command, Rita is likely to cut out a lucra-
tive lecture-line for herself —several lines, in fact.
Thus far she has only tackled the multitude as an
authority on up-to-date cookery—a subject that
will never attract the men until she disguises it
under the alias of ‘Dietetics, or Feeding as an
Art.’ Her country press-notices have been warm
and comforting. One critic—a girl, too ! —refers
to her‘charming appearance and musical voice,’
and says ‘ she spoke for an hour and a-half with-
out a break, and was as fresh at the end of that
time and her voice as clear as when she began.’
Which doesn’t sound encouraging for matrimonial
suitors, all the same.
“David Blair’s strong point was his memory,
which never failed him, even to the last. He
remembered what he read ; and he once boasted,
in the presence of the writer, that for over 30
years lie read through at least one book every day
of his life. Yet he seemed to remember all these
books, and to know more about the contents of
volumes he had only skimmed half-a-century ago
than most people would remember if they had read
them carefully only a month before. But he
wouldn’t endure compliments about his memory.
‘ Memory ! ’ he would roar, in that big way of his,
‘it isn’t memory; it’s knowledge ! ’ And it was.
“Two damsels doing Bourke-street on Sunday
night were the victims of a display of popular feel-
ing. One with a dark dress and a big straw hat
was picked out as Dubberlce by a cocksure youth,
and soon 2000 people were surging round, hooting
the girl for ‘ turning dog. ’ The girls at last broke
away into a cab and escaped.

Tired men, whether suffering from physical or
mental fatigue, delicate women, growing girls and
little children find Dr. Tibbies’ Vi -Cocoa a unique
beverage of inestimable benefit. The nauseous
drugs and disagreeable medicines associated with
ill-health are, in Dr. Tibbie’s Vi-Cocoa, replaced

distinctive flavoring of its own which will appeal
to the fastidious and over-nice palate of the
invalid, and its soothing effect renders it an ideal
“ Pick-me-up.”
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, by taking the place of
stimulants of an ardent nature, has made happy
many a home which otherwise to-day would have
been wretched, and the ultimate effects of which
it is impossible to forsee. For breakfast, dinner,
supper—indeed, at any hour of the twenty-four—
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa will be found light and
refreshing ; it leads the way among all beverages,
and nothing can equal it.

Dr. Tibbie’s Vi-Cocoa are being recognised to an
extent hitherto unknown in the history of any
preparation. Merit, and merit alone is what is
claimed for Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Coooa, and the pro-
prietors are prepared to send to any reader who
names The Bulletin (a post-card will do) a

From journalism to mechanics seems a
far call, yet Donald Murray, for years leader of
S.M. Herald reporting-staff, has forsaken news-
paperdom to (even in face of the linotype, which
he seeks to supersede) place a type-setting inven-
tion on the American and European markets. A
tough contract, but then the inventor’s name is
Donald, and he hails from Maoriland.

Ex-Governor Bowen, who died last week,
was not unlike Judge Redmond Barry in point of
pompous courtliness. Bowen, after the fatigues
of Queensland and Maoriland, heartily relished
the ease of Victoria, till he courageously put his
foot in it with Black Wednesday. His speeches
were magniloquent, but far below Hercules Robin-
son’s. Lady Bowen was a good proser, too. At
Auckland she said, “ Your city does so remind me
of my own beautiful Isles of Greece ! ”
“ T.D. ” : Some paragraphist says that at
each of her first two trials murderess Louisa Col-
lins contrived to bewitch a juror, and so bring
about a disagreement. Which opportunely recalls
Louisa’s case for comparison with that of school-
master Wilson, seemingly incriminated by his
crippled son in connection with the Oxley affair.
She was convicted upon the testimony of her
children—a fact about which there was much de-
mur. A youngster’s evidence is almost certain to
be influenced by the police ( against the prisoner,
<>f course), and it is abhorrent that a child should
grow up in the knowledge that he has unwittingly
placed the noose round his parent’s neck.
“Melb.”: The last steady work done by
our journalistic father, the just-deceased David
Blair, was leader-writing for Franklyn and
I lenty’s Federal Australian. This aftermath
bore no trace of his famous yore-time bludgeony
And slaughterous fist, as befitted an ex-cleric. I
worked once for a second-rate Melb. paper, and it
puzzled me why an affectionate and eminent old
comrade of Blair was so eager to write gra-
tuitously. After suitably paving the way, he
banded over a ferocious diatribe on an imaginary
literary personage named Livid Glare. Of course
i did not go in, being of no interest to anyone
but these venerable sports, brigands of the quill,
homebody brought a libel on poor Newman und r
< 'ardinal Manning’s notice. “Ah,” said Man-
ning, “most cruel—but photographic.” How-
ever, Blair, though he long ago wielded the pen
like Purves the tongue, was such another kindly
man.
Billy Jones, the evergreen ringmaster at
titzgeralds’ circus, was among the crowd that
gathered outside Geelong Gaol on the historical
occasion of a man not being hanged according to
contract. The Governor’s messenger, bearing a
tardy reprieve for the prisoner, had ridden post-
haste from Melbourne to Geelong, and when his
horse dropped dead in Moorabool-street, he
sprinted to the gaol on his own legs and burst
through the crowd waving the fateful document
aloft. Billy Jones, who was a small apprentice
boy at the time and had got away to the picnic
(through his bedroom window) without consulting
the circus boss, doesn’t quite remember whether
he was glad or sorry that the reprieve arrived
before it was too late. In the midst of the excite-
ment the young apprentice felt a hand fall
heavily across the side of his head, and he bolted
back home without demanding an explanation.
“ I knew the hand,” says Billy, “ for it had often
been there before.”
Lee. Young, supposed to be Australia’s
oldest Chinese resident, died at Ballarat East on
26th Feb., aged 72 years. He arrived on Ballarat
in ’52, and was present at the Eureka, which side
he took (if any) being an open question. He
became a Clistian, and was naturalised.
Capt. Randell, who is retiring from S.A.
Parliament, is now 73 years old. In July, 1853,
he anticipated Capt. Cadell by navigating the
Murray in the s.s. Mary Ann, which he built for
the purpose ; and in ’55, with the s.s. Gen i, he
explored the Darling and Murrumbidgee.
A sad event was the destruction by fire of
“The Grange,” Totteridge, Herefordshire, Eng-
land, the residence of the 90-year-old ex-Austra-
lian, Sir Charles Nicholson, with its life-gathered
collection of rare books and curios. The old doctor
was the founder of Sydney University, to which
he lately presented some valuable books.
Lord Tennyson says that if permitted to
contribute to the great work of Australian Feder-
ation “ the dream of his boyhood will be realised.”
His lordship will understand when he has been in
Australia a few weeks that Imperial Governors
are not permitted to do anything whatever that

uselessness.
The veteran Dr. Kevin Izod O’Doherty is
settling his affairs for another trip to the old land.
Last time he went Patriotism was his star. But
Parnell chilled him and the House of Commons
was uncongenial. This time the hope of Cash
guides his steps. He believes his process of de-
frosting meat will revolutionise that trade and
pour shekels into his pocket.
Old James Cock, who announces that he
will stand no more for S.A. Parliament, arrived
in the province with the first Governor, Capt.
Hindmarsh, in H.M.S. Buffalo, 28th Dec., 1836.
His father owned Adelaide acres now of priceless
value, but sold them nearly 60 years ago and put
the money in a country malt-house, where he lost
it. The son, perhaps from this cause, is a rigid
teetotaller.
With George Bowen has departed this life
one of the five last survivors of the old regime of
Australian professional Governors. Belmore does
not count: N.S. Wales was his first and last
Governorship, to which he came to earn money
enough to lift the mortgage off his family estate,
which he did within four years. The only ex-
Queenslander living is Norman, a recent retire-
ment. Fergusson, of S.A., retired in 1873, and is
now 67. Of the five S.A. Governors between him
and Buxton, four are dead. Loch, the last of the
Vic. “ professionals,” is 72 years old ; and poor
old Augustus Loftus, only once a Governor,
and shelved at that, is now 82.
HIS PROFESSIONAL AIR.
S AILOR: “ What is it — musical, literary , or
dramatic? ”
POKE : “None o the m—chiefly tonsorial !”
The two N.S.W. Equity Judges —A. H.
Simpson and Gregory Walker—were schoolfellows
in England. At one time the N.S.W. Supreme
Court Bench had three schoolmates in Windeyer,
Innes, and G. B. Simpson.
A candidate at a recent Tas. election based
his claim on the fact that he was once engaged on
railway works in Queensland under “that emin-
ent contractor, the father of the Governor of
Victoria.” And yet he was not elected.
In the opinion of his friends
the death last week of Mr. James
Elliott, sub-editor for the last de-
cade of S.M. Herald, was due to
his restless energy. Probably his
English training was responsible for
Mr. Elliott’s notion that it was
necessary for him to stick in (he
musty and barn like Herald office
long after his paper had gone to
press, and attend to all manner of
minor details —which marked him
out as an invaluable sub-editor, but
contributed in an appreciable de-
gree to his early death. His love
for athletics was also a tax upon a
constitution by no means robust.
Mr. Elliott was known to make an
almost regular practice, after reach-
ing bed at daylight, of arising a
couple of hours later and going for
a pull up-river from his North Shore
residence. He died of consumption,
aged only 43. It was Henniker
Heaton who “ discovered ” Mr.
Elliott on the staff of a Canterbury
(Eng.) paper, and sent him out to
Sydney Evening News. The late
Herald “sub.,” whose demise is
generally deplored by Sydney press-
men, was another victim to help
prove that a good singing voice
may have its source in disordered lungs.
The “father” of S.A. Assembly, A. H.
Landseer, retires from politics in a month or two
after continuously representing Mt. Barker for 23
years. Landseer was one of the pioneers of the.
Murray trade and was also one of the first and
luckiest men on the Vic. gold-fields in the early
days. The famous painter Landseer was his uncle.

At a big dinner or lunch connected with
the Y.R.C. in the days when Richmond was a
good horse, the owner, Eli
Jellett, and Col. Disney,
R.A., were the only
silent members, the for-
mer from “ unac-
customed as I
am,” the latter
from choice. All
the spee c h es
were butter, each
speaker made one
of a mutual admira-
tion oonversazione. But
at last the wine worked
up old Eli, and he got
on his legs. This is his
speech, translated from
his vernacular: “Colonel,
I'm a gemmem, you’re a
gem mem, them other blokes
is all gemmem. Blast them
all ! Gome on out of this.”
And the Commandant of the
Permanent Artillery went out

“ Scribe ” ; Judge Redmond
Barry ? Melb., though such a dab for
punctilio, was the best fellow of the
lot. Jack Rider, reporting, once
missed an important case in Chambers, before
Barry. He went in straight to the Judge, who
obliged him with all particulars, and asked him to
take a glass of wine.
Fred. West, whose brother was once a
S.A. Crown Minister, was a quaint character who
invariably larded his conversation with strange
oaths. Once he went to arrange an overdraft,
and the bank-manager courteously asked :
“ How much money do you think you will want,
Mr. West?” “Well,” replied West, “I don’t
know. How much dashed money have you
got ? ” At another time a man to whom he had
given a cheque indignantly remonstrated with
him after its return, marked “N.S.F.” Said West,
musingly “‘N.S.F.’, what do those
letters stand for ? ” “ Why, not sufficient funds,
of course,’’ was the reply. “ Well, I’m d d,”
calmly commented the drawer; “I’ll take my
account from that bank. That’s the
second time they haven’t had enough money to
pay my cheques.” Poor West has now
passed to a land where they make streets of gold.
Thomas Carlisle, N.S.W. railway pen-
sioner and successful speculator, recently dead,
once had a startling experience. When traffic-
manager he rode on a loco.-engine from Hawkes-
bur.y races, the train being crowded with pas-
sengers. Approaching Parramatta the driver
pointed out that the signal was against him, but
Carlisle ordered him on as the signal-man had
evidently forgotten to lower, and nothing could
be on the road at Parramatta. All the same,
there happened to be a train about starting for
Sydney. The present Out-door Superintendent
(H. Richardson) was on the platform, and seeing
the special coming full-bat, yelled to the occu-
pants of the standing train to get out. They did,
just in time, for the special crashed into the
empty carriages and made match-wood of them.
Richardson’s presence of mind saved many lives.
Carlisle was- then removed from the office of
Traffic-Manager and appointed Traffic-Auditor at
an equal salary.
It is not generally known that the late
David Blair has a brother in Victoria. Many
persons made his acquaintance for the first time
the other day at the funeral. The old man, who
is 81, is shire secretary at Lara.
INOONVENIENT.
MRS. SHERBET: “ Wake up, John, there's a man trying to
get into the house.”
MR. SHERBET (who has come home late): “ Well, he surely
don't eckshpect me to gerrup and — hie—opensh door
for him thish time o’ night!"— (Re-snores.)
J. H. Symon, Q.C., who has no rival as
leader of S.A. Bar, is credited with cherishing
ambitions regarding a big judicial post in the
coming Commonwealth. Symon owed his first
big lift to Mr. Way, now S.A. Chief Justice, who
discovered him when he was an obscure lawyer at
Mt. Gambier, and made him his partner. Symon
has refused judicial promotion in S.A.
Apropos of the approaching 17th March.
In early Celtic days the word “Patric,” as it was
then spelled, really meant the “Devil.” St.
Patrick’s name was, according to Dr. Parr,
“Succat,” but the Pagan priests, in detestation of
himself and doctrines, nicknamed him “Patric.”
To think that all Patricks are mere nicknames of
baleful significance is indeed depressing.
General Stephens, who died the other day,
at Elsternwick (Vic.) and left <£50,000 to his
grandchildren, was nephew of Lord Gough, one-
time commander-in-Chief in India. When Gen.
Stephens came down to Hobart about 1850, on
health furlough, he looked around for a wife with
money and met her in Isabella Lewis, daughter of
old Dick Lewis—a sturdy, swearing, alcoholic
Welshman, who had given his soul to piling up
coin. Stephens got <£20,000 with his handsome
bride, and that set him up. His second daughter
by their union married Lord Donoughmore, the
lean, hollow-eyed, no-account-looking head of the
Hely-Hutchinson clan. Old Dick died before this
tremendous event came off. But he used to talk
of “my son-in-law, Lord Gough’s nephew, cost
me £20,000. But we must pay for our luxuries,
my boy, we must pay for our luxuries.”
The recently-deceased Dr. M‘Crea, ex-
navy surgeon and erstwhile Vic. chief medical
officer, when visiting doctor at Melb. gaol carried
old-time methods into his practice upon vagrant
and criminal sick. His remedy for drunks was
to put the offending boozer “ under the pump.”
Some stood this drastic treatment well, and pro-
fited by it. Upon others, its effect was disastrous,
and some unfortunates drifted into the lunatic
asylum soon after being treated to “ M'Crea’s
Niagara.” One old German swore he would shoot
the doctor directly he issued from the gaol. But,
as he emerged feet-foremost, nailed up in a
coffin, the thing did not come off. Sentimentalists
who remonstrated with M‘Crea, would be met
with the answer : “ It’s kill or cure, mebbe—the
survival o’ the fittest. Weol, what ha’ ye to say
against yon ? ” And the doctor was a XXX.
religious man, too.
King O’Malley has broken out again. Hi«
election address: —
TO THE SOVEREIGN ERECTORS OP
ENCOUNTER BAY.
Ladies and Gentlemen —
I believe that the hired Canvassers of some of the
Candidates are endeavoring to advance the interests of
their masters by assuring the electors that I have no
weight in Parliament. I know too much of the motives
of hireling canvassers in ireneral to readily assume that
they use the word weight in.the sense in which I confess
I do lack it, namely, immoral or dead weight, acquired
where solid character is lacking by such contemptible
methods as drnnkery, shouring, and other venal sources
of sewer-rat popularity. Were it not for the fact that
these mercenary purveyors of paid-for perfections, of
which they always keep a stock in bond to let to the
highest bidder, can easily put on a plausible expression
that, as the poet says, “Sugars o’er the devil himself,” I
would not insult the intelligent electors of this district
by cautioning them against attempts to mislead their
judgment. Besides, as the sovereign electors of my district
know, weight depends upon achievements, and my Par-
liamentary record is an ample refutation of the slanders
of degenerate professional canvassers, whose consciences
are usually equal to the advocacy of any cause, whether
it be that of a Judas Iscariot or Pontius Pilate. But per-
haps those gentlemen of accommodating morals and
hypertrophied capacities of making the ebon of a black
conscience assume the lustre of Aretio snow may meet
the Nemesis that eventually overtakes such tactics, by
having the measure of their character taken sooner than
they expected. I have confidence enough in the good
sense of the moral, temperate, honest, and clean-lived
portion of this electorate, upon whose valued opinions I
again place my reliance, to feel that they will not allow
their reason to be clouded by calumnies coming from men
whose facial recommendation would scarcely secure them
the loan of a sixpenny scrubbing-brush. These irrespon-
sible, hungry, parasitic bloodhounds want my political
gore purely for their masters’ money.

A BUSH LETTER.
We’ve been riding since the morning through the scorch-
ing sun of day
And the sheep that couldn’t crawl along were left upon
the way,
And of grass there’s not a semblance (I suppose you’ll
think I’ve lied)
But the horses’ bones are striving just to get outside the
hide.
And they drop with very weakness; they are past all
sense of pain,
And we take them by the handle and we drag them up
again.
They’re worn, and weak, and haggard, and they haven’t
strength to rise.
And every horse is weighted down by half a ton of flies.
Now, the blessed sheep we feed them on the trees that
grow around
(I don’t mean that they climb them, forwefell them to the
ground),
And up the wretched river, if you travel for a day,
You may come across a mud-hole ; it’s just lovely out
this way.
The men outside are sleeping, but they’re swearing all
the same,
They are dreaming they are droving on the wretched
track again.
All the night we lie a-dozing with our heads beneath the
clothes
For we dare not let those insects—the mosquitoes—see
our nose.
I know you like to hear some pleasant news from time to
time,
So I send this letter to you from the land of dust and
grime;
I will drop a line from Berry, if I reach there safe and
well,
Here is luck to you in Sydney from a country friend in
Hell!

A Bulletin correspondent apropos of Pro-
fessor Hobday’s hobby for repairing damaged
animals :
Up North lately, met a German swaggie ratty on same
point, and ’several others. Rational enough on first
acquaintance, but the corks round his hat, the fancy-
packet on his billy, and the nine straps round a tremend-
ous swag (consisting mainly of books on metaphysics,
pi ritualism, telepathy and the like) convinced me that
REV. HOWLER'S SHOCK.
MAMA ( wishing to show off before new minister): " You got this medal for good conduct, didn't
you, Percy? Tell Mr. Howler why teacher gave it to you.”
PERCY: “ Teacher didn’t give it to me. She gave it to the boy Brown ; but I knocked him down
and nicked it."
1 here was a screw loose somewhere. No human help was
near the deserted hut, so I carefully avoided all topics
outside tea, flour, sugar and tobacco lest I’d strike his

“ K.” : A paying game in the old days of
carrying from Maitland to Mungindi, on N.S.W.
border, was securing young wives for old cookies
or squatters. Big commissions were paid, and for
many years Maitland lost more than a dozen girl 3
per annum—barmaids and “generals,” persuaded
by old-women-carriers to try their luck way-back.
Generally made good wives, and all was square
dealing. One old gent paid JB2OO commission for
a 16-stone daughter of Erin—from whom I’m des-
cended myself.

“Centralian” : Re chasing kangaroo and
railway engine. During construction of railway
fence through Gordon Downs on Clermont (Q.)
branch line, a ’roo got on to the track, and, on
approach of train, started ahead, keeping the
track beside the rails. After a couple of hundred
yds., finding train very close, he got flurried, and
tried to jump across rails. Engine caught him on
the rise, and flung him against the fence with a
bump that snapped the No. 8 top wire. Hardly
need to say the ’roo was killed. On same station
saw an “ old man ” clear a wire-netting fence sfb.
with a round wire strained a foot above. ’Roo
hopped quietly up, and over. Had often bailed
’roos in same corner, but this fellow was the only
one to get over.

neck to get into every waterhole he meets. Wes-

“ Yarrum ” : Nowadays, the dairymen kill
most of their bull calves, and all the weedy
heifers. They mostly don’t waste a charge of
powder and a bit of lead each time. The “ boarded-
out ” boy (nearly all have one or two) just stands
off and hurls stones at their heads. Have seen as
many as 20 rocks thrown before an animal was
defunct, and have heard of a vigorous calf being
“settled ”in ten goes ; but that was a record. It’s
great fun—for the boys. The carcase is left at the
back-door, or handy to the milking-shed, and
crows, cats, pigs, and dogs squabble over it for
weeks. The farmer can't smell anything, and the
milk don’t mind.

good name, and so is adopted. Nimity-

The M‘Cooey about reptilian life-tenacity:
An Australian snake when fatally wounded near the
head dies as quickly as any other animal, but certain
Aust. snakes take much longer to drown or otherwise
suffocate than any other air-breathing animal, the platy-
pus alone, perhaps, excepted. Length of time a fatally-
wounded snake will live depends upon distance of wound
from head. The nearer the head, the shorter the survival.
“ Surveyor ” (B. Mar. ’9B) isquite correct about transected
snakes attacking and biting viciously. I have personally
observed that an Australian snake with but three inches
of body attached to the head can inflict a fatal bite,
while with only two remaining inches the result is doubt-
ful; the bite of the head alone, however (and the head
alone will bite savagely) even when applied instantly after
severance, has been found quite innocuous. Reasons :
When the snake is quiescent the complicated poison-con-
veying apparatus is out of gear. A cup-like tube
connected with the poison - gland must become
firmly attached around base of fang before poison
can pass through the hollow of the fang into the
wound and 3 inches at least of body-attachment
is required to supply enough muscular force to put
the apparatus into biting “ gear” (or functional activity).
Two inches might do, though not probably. Snakes can
eject venom without actually biting anything. The
tiger snake, for instance, if held by the throat and
pricked on the nose with a pin, will, in attempting to
bite, squirt the poison several feet away through the
fangs, and may thus, without injury to fangs or poison
glands, be forced to render its bite pro tem. harmless ;
but in 24 hours the creature may have secreted sufficient
poison to kill a bullock. If kept in a cool place for
several days and then thrown upon hot coals, a snake’s
decapitated body will wriggle as if alive ; but immediately
after being killed by certain poisons which destroy mus-
cular action, the snake will lie motionless upon the fire.
When a snake bites itself or one of its own species no
harm results.

How a smart Yankee fell in at the
Hawkesbury:—
In the early sixties Richmond was a very lively place—
the Cornwells, Forresters, Freemans, and other “ Ox-
berry ” natives made things hum. A flash colored barber
set up in the village, and used to give his customers one
stereotyped yarn whilst dabbing on the lather—“ Aus-
tralians are a mighty clever people, but they want travel
to put them fly a bit. Why, a smart Yankee could buy
and sell the whole colony.” Albert Cornwell, dropping
in one day to have his hair cut, suggested that the bar-
ber ought to buy a horse. “ Can’t stand it yet,” said the
darkie, “ but I’ll have a go at one a bit later on.” “ Well,
old man,” replied Cornwell, “ I’ve got a pony that we
seldom use, and you might take him for a few' weeks.”
“How much a week?" asked the darkie. “We won’t
quarrel about that,” said Cornwell. “Here, I’ll
tell you what 111. do: I’ll give you horse, sad-
dle, and bridle as a present, if, in return, you’ll
shave for nothing any friends of mine whom
I send round.” “ I guess that it suits me down to my
boots,” said darkie, and the bargain was struck. Next
morning Cornwell sent round a hat-rack of a creamy
pony saddle, and bridle, the whole turn-out worth about
30s. ’ That afternoon half-a-dozen young six - footers
dropped in and had a shave and shampoo, each paying
with Albert Cornwell’s name ; and the free shaves went
on until the Yank found his business was being ruined.
His room was always crowded, and on the third day he
rigged up a special razor with a saw-edge for Cornwell’s

friends ; but the trouble was to distinguish between the
dead-heads and the paying customers in advance. “ Are
you a friend of Mr. Cornwell’s?” he asked a man
who was not in the joke, and, as everyone knew Corn-
well, the man answered “Yes.” The saw-edge was
duly produced, with the result that the man swore never
to try a shave in that shop again. “Do you know Mr.
Cornwell,” the coon asked another likely customer.
“No,” replied the man, “who’s he?” And he got a
shave, hair-cut and shampoo, settling up with the in-
formation that “Albert” told him it would he all right.
“ Didn’t I ask you if you knew Mr. Cornwell?” asked the
infuriated Yank. “ Well, I didn’t know him by that
name,” said the gentleman, as he fixed his tie in front of
the glass, “ he’s plain Albert to me.” That night, to the
relief of the barber, the pony was stolen. But Cornwell
said not to mind—he’d give him another, and next morn-
ing a boy arrived leading a rich brown pony—the old
cream artistically dyed. A couple of days later the
barber visited Cornwell and said he’d have to return the
pony or take down his pole, as bis business w’as simply
“ bung.” A deputation then waited on the barber telling
him the strength of the joke, and when the boys got up a
subscription to pay for the free shaves and shampoos, the
darkie said he was satisfied. Australians, he remarked,
didn’t want to travel, or they would get so sharp they’d
be able to shave themselves without a razor.

Some time back a heavy-weight squatter
was taken ill, and, on being brought to Sydney
for treatment, was told that his case was hopeless
—he couldn’t possibly live more than a month or
two. To make the best of matters, he arose and
went out on a final burst; and, swearing that he
would only be planted in an up-to-date coffin, he
looked up a ghoul, and was measured for a
gorgeous polished-oak “ casket, ” with silk lining,
silver mountings, &c., and all the rest of the con-
ventional horrors. The meat-box was duly built,
and delivered to his hotel, and, after much
trouble with the manager, smuggled upstairs,
where Mr. Jumbuck packed it with his wife s
purchases. He left for the homestead, where he
at last arrived, after giving many persons
the shudders, and having to open the coffin often
to convince station-masters that it didn’t contain
a corpse. At home, the dying sheep-man put his
future resting-place under the bed, and used it to
keep his clothes in, but when several months had
passed, and he showed no signs of an early shuffle-
off, he decided that better use could be made of so
expensive an article, and suggested to his wife
that it would make a good cot for the baby. As
madam e disapproved of the suggestion, he stood
it up on end, put in a few shelves, fitted hinges on
the lid, and made it into a grog-cupboard. It is
a gorgeous and original piece of furniture, but is
rough on the drink, as when the flippant pas-
toralist takes his visitor along to give him a nip,
said visitor mostly wants a very stiff one to revive
him after the shock.

“ Basalt ” on a way back problem :
Why do men who have been in the bush for years make
no provision for carrying water in drought ? On 25th
Dec., ’9B, two men started, walking, for some water about
12 miles from Opalton, intending on reaching the spot to
settle there until rain came. After a time, one man re-
turned in a bad way, and a party which went out with him
found the other lying nearly dead with a revolver in his
hand, his intention being to shoot himself unless help
came. Again, on Bladensberg, a man went out from a
well and got bushed. Day very hot; no water. Horse
knocked-up; let him go.
Showerduringnight; chewed
his shirt. Went from Thurs-
day to Saturday, when he
hit rabbit-fence and help, in

ported lost at Ada Tank.

bridle tied to stirrup-leather.
Again, the man reported

up safely at a carriers’
camp. Police-constable and

on one occasion rode 60 miles
without a drink. Again,

“Jim,” a more or less civilmed aboriginal
employed on a river station, had a running account
with the local pub. Sometimes when wanting
grog he sent a messenger, whom he furnished with
a stick, which he cut a notch for each bottle

would produce the sticks, and Jim would plank
down Bs. for each notch indented thereon. On
one occasion he sent a blackfellow, “ Tommy
Dodd,” for two bottles. Tommy surreptitiously
nicked another notch on the stick, got three
bottles, and had a reprehensible drunk on the odd
one. Next time Jim called at the pub, he ran
over the notches, and disputed his account; “No

“S.S.” : Old Jack, a Gippslander, boasts
about his luck. He had foolishly camped within
the sweep of a gaunt white gum, under the lean
of it, its heaviest bough reaching straight for his
tent. The prospecting-party to his right warned
him, and predicted a shocking death after the
first big blow. The big blow came and, sure
enough, the debilitated gum came with it. Old
Jack heard the report and the tearing sound in
the night, but had not time to strike a position
for prayer before the crash came. Presently he
was conscious that all was over and he was well
and strong. The falling gum had spanned his
tent, lighting just beyond on its big limb, and
then somersaulted right into the camp of the pro-
specting-party, breaking two legs and scattering
tents and ware all down the hill side. Old Jack
says luck is better that judgment.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“Melbourne”: It is now pretty hard to work
a successful original “ have ” in pony racing, but a smart
man with two ponies lately burnt both books ” and
punters very severely. He put his nags into work, and
with one, which somehow became generally known as
(say) Toby, proceeded to break all track records ; the
other moke was a very commonplace animal called (say)
Mickey. For a couple of weeks Toby consistently smashed
all watches, and when both ponies appeared in the race-
book a few days later, “X. Smith’s blk. g. Toby ” was
immediately rushed by the punters and backed down to
“ money on.” In entering, however, the wily owner had
“swopped” the ponies’ names, and while the g.p. was
violently scrambling to have its bit on Toby, he was
quietly taking all the Mickey money going at 10’s and
12’s to 1. As both animals were black, the fake wasn’t
spotted until they came out with their numbers on the
saddle-cloths. Then, of course, there was a general rush
for Mickey, but the “ books ” had dropped too, and had
“laid him.” Mickey, or the nag known to the touts as
Toby, won in a canter, and his 'cute owner collected
about £5OO from the moaning Hebrews. But the talent
made things too willing for him after, and he soon packed
up and made tracks.
* * * *
He was a pony-owner, and wanted a win badly
—but he also wanted his price. Before the pony went
out, owner said to boy : “ Now, if things are all right,
I’ll get on the shed up in the corner and wave my stick.
Then you go like blazes all the way.” Then he went to
back the pony, but as the best price he could get was
threes, he decided to run a bye. Of course he told all his
friends he couldn’t lose ; also, it was of course understood
that if no one got on the shed, the boy was to take a pull.
Unfoitunately, the course-officials found that some sports
were in the habit of climbing on to the shed and thence
to the course without troubling the man at the ticket-
office, so, at this particular meeting, a man with a big
stick was stationed on the shed to keep intruders out.
Kesult —boy on pony saw man on shed waving a stick,
thought it was all right, and won. Went up to owner
smiling to get paid, and was greeted with many kicks.

Lord Durham, in advocating the Australian
system of starting horses, said he “ could not conceive
why the British racing public should, year after year, wit-
ness such wretched starting, especially where Mr. Arthur
Coventry did not officiate.” Well, the Australian public
begins to understand that the best system of government
in racehorse starts is that which is best administered, and
a lot of people hereabouts will see the weakness of Lord
Durham's moan. If Coventry is conspicuously keener
than the other starters, there is no reason why new men
as good as he, or better, shouldn’t be provided. The one
thing wanting to ensure satisfactory starts is an intelli-
gent, authoritative person with his eyes wide open. The
“ gate ”is not a person. Merely a thing which neither
hears, sees, nor says anything.
* ♦ * *
In Melb. now the bookmaker and the cyclist
have made the game as putrid as any sport could desire
to be. At a cycling meeting you hold your fingers to
your nose. It's all “rig,” “rig,” “rig.” Supposing
several men are left in a final, they will often agree to
share the stakes ; also, that about the worst of their
number shall win, and then they go and put their money
on him. For all this, of course, the d d foolish public
pays.

Trotting has taken firm hold in Maoriland. At
Lancaster Park Amateur Trotting Club’s meeting in
April the American style of separating pacers and
trotters will be followed. A big M.L. difficulty proves to
be the “ ringing in ” of well-performed horses from else-
where. At one recent Hawke’s Bay meet two well-known
Sydney mares were “ rung-in ” and secured prizes—Fair
Girl, under the name of Tarawera, and the pacer Edith,
about the best pony of her inches writer has yet seen.
Edith was so well-known that it seems extraordinary she
could be imposed upon a crowd of trotting men any-
where this side of the line. In M.L. they gave her the
credit of being by Childe Harold, but as a matter of fact
she is the daughter of Startle. Edith has had a peculiar
career ; she was originally bought, with a foal at foot, for
a few pounds in a Sydney bazaar, but her value went up
to hundreds. She had another foal some years since, but
paternity did not seem to affect her speed, as she won
many races afterwards on Sydney courses. Both her
foals died.
* * * *
In Yarra Bend (Vie.) is a once well-known
boom-time horse-owner and big bookie. He is the Joe
Thompson there. He takes his stand with the old original
bag that some years back held thousands ; now it holds
a lot of dummy tickets and different-sized pebbles.
Wagers are booked in millions, then “ off” is the cry and
every ratty punter roars and jumps as if on the course.
The warder is the judge.

At Hobart Cup meeting, the other week, a
sporting squatter sent his son of 14 to buy two tote-
tickets on No. 7. The kiddy mistook the order and got
tickets on No. 11. The old man cursed the boy’s stupidity
and ordered him off home. In dire disgrace hopeful left
the paddock, but climbed on a gatepost to watch the race
through his tears. No. 11, a rank outsider, won and paid
a div. of £25. The boy thought it would be now safe
to venture back to the family oircle, but despite his sire’s
£5O win and the banter of acquaintances, the lad was
ignominiously ordered off again. “ Should obey orders,”
severely explained the old man.
* * * *
“The only square game is cricket.” Well, may
be so; but then “gloriously-uncertain” cricket is the
game in which crooked work is least easily detected.
“ Safety in numbers.” Missing a catch (by pure accident
or otherwise) often determines the issue of a match.
Then a captain may let an ineffective bowler stay
on at his sweet will; a batsman may do all sorts
of things ; and so can an umpire. “ How do we know ?”
Anyhow we hear representative cricketers, during and
after a big or little match, say with many' oaths that the
other side’s umpire is an infernal scoundrel and thief—in
fact, the best man in the opposition team —and that if
they could only get him into a quiet place, they would
kick the stuffing out of him. Yes, cricket is the only
honest game.
* * * *
Falconer’s silhouettes of prominent
cricketers rivet the attention of spectators on the extra-
ordinary nasal development of nearly every player of
note. Why do cricketers run to nose and cyclists to chin ?
* * * *
How do the rules of cricket apply here? During
the progress of an Albert Park match a swift ball broke a
lump from the bat, and this sliver sent the wicket in
three directions. There was a dispute, and bowler and
batsman endeavored to fight it out. Result: a draw.
* * * *
“ Jack ” Marsh, a while back reckoned the
fastest sprinter in Australia, is now, bar “ Jonah,” about
the fastest bowler, and, with coaching, should make a
brilliant trundler. Marsh, an aboriginal, was first taken
on as a practice bowler at S.C.G. when the last English
team was out, and at first was able to bowl the best men
of either side at practice, but the Sydney players have
now got used to him. He rocks ’em in little, if any,
slower than Jones, but, like Jonah, his delivery is
reckoned not above suspicion.
* • * •
Clem. Hill has (been in S.A. loco, shops, and,
although he started in ’93, he hasn’t done two years’
“ time ” yet. When Clem, has completed his apprentice-
ship, he will probably be a toothless old man. Geo.
Giffen, who is still in Adelaide G.P.0., has seen nearly all
the juniors in the department promoted over his head
during his cricket career.
* * * *
At Warrnambool (Vic.) the girls are getting
tired of cricket, now that matches between the “ Sea-
Foam ” and “ Forget-me-not ” teams have lost their early
bloom of notoriety. The utter lonesomeness of a position
on the field when'the other side is “ in ” makes cricket
somewhat tiring for spinsters, so the Warrnambooliennes
are starting to spread themselves out at the more restful
game of bowls. The local bowling club is enrolling a
number of carefully-selected ladies as members, free of
charge ; also, a tuition committee is engaged in teaching
the angels the rudiments of the game, and if there should
be one plump, elderly man of marriageable income—
nearly all bowlers, somehow, are of marriageable income
—left on the green by this time next year Tub Bulletin
will want to know the reason why.
« * * *
“Dabton” writes this irreverent note:—Has
gilowell ever done anything commensurate with his con-
sistent booming by public and press? Is he one whit
superior to C. M'Leod, whom he much resembles, as a
bowler, giving in that good-’un thatcomes back so quickly
from the off? I cannot recall any instance where he has
bowled a side out by himself, as Jones, M'Kibbin, and
Trumble have repeatedly done by sheer effort of trundling
genius. For brilliancy he is not in the hunt with any one
of these. The assertion by a correspondent in a back
number that he is the best bowler in Aus. is plain moon-
shine, and if they book the burly ex-apiarist’s passage
home they will carry with them four comparatively weak
batsmen in the fourteen. I have heard it argued that he
is sure to return an accomplished bat. His partisans cite
G. Palmer as an instance. Batsmen are not made in a
day, or a season, and Palmer shone not as a batsman till
he had been to the old country four times, and by then
he had lost most of his bowling. To my idea, the team
should consist of Trumble, Jones, M’Leod, Noble, and
M'Kibbin (a truly unique and varied array of bowling
talent); Darling, Hill, Gregory, Worrall, Graham, Iredale,
Kelly, and Johns. If they take a fourteenth man, then
let it be Giller or Giffen ; Oilier for choice—a rising, re-
liable, and absolutely first-class man, whose bowling also
differs markedly from that of those chosen. This, I
venture to opine, will be the strongest team that ever left
these shores to do battle for “the honor of Australia”
—and for the boodle. Don’t forget the boodle.

“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : In the palmy days of the
cedar-trade on a northern river, when regattas were
the rage, it wasn’t necessary to be first past the post, if
you belonged to the same push as the “ Kum-i-tea.” At
one regatta, a first prize of £l5 was given for a light skiff
race ; and the committee entered one of their own set.
A few scullers from the next river competed ; but the com-
mittee’s cedar-chopper, who hadn’t trained at all, who
smoked half the day and played cards half the night, came
in an easy first. He dashed off with the lead, rounded
the point, scooted up a little opening in the man-
groves, and was completely hidden when the other pullers
rounded the point. He had a good smoke while his op-
ponents rowed to the turn round a buoy, a mile from
starting-point, and, when the perspiring and wondering
scullers on their return journey got wirSm 50yds. or so of
the rested refugee, out he popped, waited till his rivals
were close up, then raced for home, and duly received the
fivers-three, in spite of about 19 protests. “ Ah !” as old
“ Twowharves Tommy ” used to say, “ them was the times
for really true sport! ” Like so many others, he thought
that sport and trickery are identical—which they ?
* » * *
Be “take-downs” at cards. A professional
man who used to visit a certain northern town periodically
told the local publican that at the club where he stayed in
Melb. there were plenty of packs of almo_st-new cards
which he could send him up gratis for use in the hotel.
Bung gladly accepted, and thereafter the solemn old
practitioner took down him and the local crowd neatly
every month for all they were worth. The cards were
“ readers.”

“ B.” : “ Sporting Notions ” asks how is strong-
man Sampson’s coin-breaking done. I don’t pretend
to say how Sampson does it, for he may break coins with
a bona fide grip of finger and thumb ; but you can per-
form the trick thus: Coat the coin with wax, and then
with a superfine needle trace a line across it. Then steep
it in acid (hydrofluoric acid, I think, would do). Experi-
ence soon shows how strong the acid must be, and how
'oner the coin will have to stay in to render it breakable.
When cleaned of wax only very close examination will
detect the doctoring.

The Federal Capital.
[BY ALEX. WILSON.]
The looation of the Federal capital having been
fixed within a certain restricted portion of New
South Wales, the question now is “ What is the
best site available within the prescribed limits ?
• * • •
As to Climate : All the existing capitals, with
the exception of Hobart, are situated in more or
less hot climates, and the Parliaments are in every
case at their work between April and November.
In order, therefore, to enable the business of
Federal government and Parliament to proceed
without unduly interfering with colonial affairs,
a climate must be chosen suitable for residence
during the months from December to April. I
think this will be admitted on all hands.
As to what advantages this site offers for the
foundation of a city, it will be evident at a glance
at a map of the locality that it has every oppor-
tunity for providing a water-supply sufficient for
a city of the first magnitude ; a district
That it is surrounded by a more or less fertile
country, that its climate is recognised as one of
the finest in Australia. It has an altitude of from
2200 ft. to 3500 ft., and, by slightly extending the
area, the Canoblas could be included, and an alti-
tude of more than 4600 ft. attained.
• * * •
Accessibility : it should, as far as possible, be
easily reached direct from each colonial capital.
While not of first importance, if this requirement
can be met, it will undoubtedly largely influence
the decision as to where the site should be. I,
therefore, propose to indicate a place which can be
approached from Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, and Perth direct by rail without travel-
ling through any other capital city. Tasmania, of
course, it would be impossible to make any such
provision for.
The spot is about seven miles further from Mel-
bourne than is Goulburn, and railway communica-
tion is now established.
Adelaide, so long as it is dependent on travel-
ling via Melbourne, is in relatively the same posi-
tion. With a connection from Broken Hill to
Cobar, the distance would be reduced and direct
approach secured.
Brisbane, by the construction of the short link
from Werris Creek to the western line, would be
as near to the capital as to Sydney.
Perth, if ever connected with the eastern rail-
way systems, must-join at Port Augusta, and so
come direct to the capital.
Sydney is, of course, already in direct com-
munication by rail, and almost on a par with any
likely site on the southern line, so far as distance
is concerned.
• * * *
As TO THE INTERESTS OP NEW SOUTH WALES
generally : It is easy to show the enormous advan-
tages over any southern site. While about one-
tenth would be less favorably situated, about two-
tenths would remain at par, so to speak, while
seven-tenths would be enormously advantaged.
And the sight is most centrally situated to com-
mand all that great expanse of rapidly developing
territory, the Central Division.
It is absolutely without question that the
locality offers the only opportunity for New South
Wales to duly recognise the reasonable expecta-
tions of the other colonies, by providing a suitable
site, with a sufficient area of Crown lands, in the
shape of the church and school estate, of 55,000
acres, free from any vested interests of moment.
It only remains to get rid of the Great Zig-zag,
and construct the line to Werris Creek to complete
the arrangements, so far as this colony is con-
cerned. And for ourselves does not this mean a
system of fast trains to Orange and a vastly im-
proved service on all lines to Blayney, and all
branches ?
* * * *
Centre op Gravity op Population : As to
its suitability for commanding the bulk of the
population, this, to my mind, is one of the
most important features of the whole question.
Federation means the joint action of people, not
the mere fixing of a central spot in a large terri-
tory which has no prospect of ever sustaining
anything but the most meagre population. The
business of government is practically dealing with
the people; therefore, the site indicated is as
nearly as possible in what might be called the
oentre of gravity of the population of Australia
and Tasmania. As the capital will almost in-
evitably become in time the seat of many impor-
tant schools and colleges, and of many minor
institutions bearing on the social welfare and
domestic government of the people, this should be
made a cardinal point.
* * * *
Mail Routes: lb is self-evident that the site
should be on the line of the most direct mail route
AUSTRALIA
COMPARATIVE POPULATION
to Great Britain and the other great populations
of the world.
I suggest that a railway be constructed from
Bourke in New South Wales to Port Darwin in
the Northern Territory of South Australia, pass-
ing through Queensland. The distance to be con-
structed would be about 1350 miles; the total
distance from Sydney would be about 2000 miles.
Now, this proposal provides the main trunk line
across the continent, and I shall now proceed to
indicate why it will be the most advantageous
route, in order to supply all the colonies, except
West Australia, with their mails in the shortest
possible time.
Glancing again at the map, it will be seen that
only a few miles would be necessary to bring the
Queensland line from Townsville into direct com-
munication with the overland line. The same
also applies to Queensland Central and Southern
lines. And I see no reason why a third rail
may not be laid from, say, Cloncurry to the
junction with the Brisbane line, thereby con-
necting the principal Queensland systems on
their own gauge. Then we reach Nyngan in
N.S.W., and the suggested Federal connec-
tion from Cobar to Broken Hill brings South
Australia into direct communication with the
trunk line. Bearing on this connection, however,
you will see a line indicated to Farina, thereby
bringing Adelaide almost as near to Port Darwin
as by the overland telegraph route. On this
head, Queensland has under consideration an ex-
tension from Longreach to Jundah, and South
Australia very nearly decided to construct a line
from Farina to Innamincka, leaving a very short
gap to connect. It will be apparent that the
trans-continental railway line makes a direct
approach to the main centre of population, and,
with as little delay as possible, delivers its freight
of mails and passengers to the different centres on
the way ; and in that respect has overwhelming
advantages over the line proposed to be con-
structed through South Australia, which ap-
proaches the population at one end and entails
travelling in a more or less circular fashion in
order to reach the populations of the southern and
eastern coasts.
Of course the main trunk line should be con-
structed on the 4ft. B|in. gauge, and would there-
by avoid all the disadvantages of the proposed
line in South Australia, by having no break of
gauge to deal with, as undoubtedly the short
length from Pine Creek into Port Darwin would
require to be relaid for the purpose of an overland
mail line. On the question of gauge, so far as
Queensland and South Australia are concerned, I
do not attach much importance to a break at the
trunk line. Their connecting lines are of con-
siderable length, and would really deal with most
of the trade of the territory pass through, so that
transfers would be almost confined to mails and
passengers.
Now, having built up this structure, so to speak,
it may be asked why should the mails go via Port
Darwin at all. And, in order to carry you with me
in my arguments on this point, I must refer you
to a map of the world, for which space cannot be
found here. You will see that the sea-passage
from Port Darwin to Colombo is at least four
days shorter than from Adelaide to Colombo.
Moreover, it follows, practically, the great high-
way between the East and the West, and offers
opportunity for shortening the time for convey-
ance of mails between England, the Continent,
and the principal cities of Australia by from two
to seven days.
Touching upon another development of these
modern times in connection with this question—
that is, the trans-Continental railway from St.
Petersburg to Yladivostock the prospect has
been held out to us that, in a few years, this will
be one of the most important highways of the
world, and the shortest route between the immense
populations of Western Europe and those of the
Eastern Empires. Again, looking at the map of
the world, it requires no argument to show that
Port Darwin must be the port of departure should
this route turn out to be of value to Australia.
You will also see that some time in the future
there will inevitably be land lines connecting from
Madras through Asia and Europe, right to the
English Channel, and Port Darwin is the natural
continuation of such route to Australia and the
Southern Pacific, and this line would also pro-
bably afford a quicker means of communication to
New Zealand than any other available route.
By this scheme Adelaide, Melbourne, and Syd-
ney are brought within comparatively easy reach
of Rockhampton, Townsville, and Normanton.
And if there is anything in the recommendations
of defence experts, that feature also should ensure
it careful consideration.
Recent developments in the East point in bold
relief to the importance of a naval base in Eastern
waters, with facilities for a continuous supply of
coal and provisions for fleets and armies. Port
Darwin would provide such a base, and I am
assured that even with the appliances existing in
New South Wales to-day, thousands of tons of
coal could be delivered overland daily at an inter-
val of 48 hours from the pit, and with no danger
of interruption by an enemy at sea. The rapidity
with which supplies of all kinds could be poured
into Port Darwin, and the direct connection by
rail between the southern (Sydney) and northern
(Port Darwin) naval bases of Australasia, might,
in the near future, be of incalculable value to the
well-being of the nation, and should entitle the
project to serious consideration from an Imperial
as well as an Australian point of view.
* * * *
Feeling confident that further information and
discussion will result favorably to my scheme, I
now propose to refer shortly to sites suggested in
various places—
Bathurst: Being in the same line of country,
and possessing in a restricted degree some of the
advantages claimed for my site, I deal with it
first. By comparison it suffers much more from
drought and fierce winds. The difference in rain-
fall is about 10 inches. There are practically no
Crown lands in or about Bathurst, and resumption
would have to be adopted in almost every case.
With the exception of a limited area, Bathurst is
cut off from productive territory by barren, rugged,
mountainous country. Its water-supply appears
to be decidedly inferior. In my humble opinion
it is within the proscribed limit.
• • * •
Goulburn (and thereabouts): The want of
Crown Reserves of any extent applies here as at
Bathurst, and, in fact, to every feasible site yet
brought forward, except the Church and School
Estate adopted by me. Goulburn has a lesser
rainfall by eight inches, and also suffers from
severe cutting, wintry winds as well as an occa-
sional touch of hot nor’-westers. Water-supply
again of an inferior character.
• * * »
Lake George has been championed as an ideal
site. A veritable dead sea, with frequently miles
of dry and drying foreshore, water almost entirely
out of reach even on horseback, and has been dry.
A watershed of the most restricted nature, and
without an outlet. Water-supply by pumping or
at great expense from Upper Murrumbidgee.
Rainfall same as Goulburn.
* » * »
Bombala: Climate good, but suffers from
sou’-westers off Snowy Mountains—very severe at
times. Water supply probably first-class, at
moderate cost. Rainfall exactly as at Goulburn.
In the first place, it will cost two and a-half
millions to make the necessary road connections.
From the terminus of the Victorian railway at
Bairnsdale to Bombala is by surveys already
made 206 miles. Some 75 miles being in N. S. W. . and
likely to cost £6OOO per mile.
Oh the Victorian side ; Bairns-
dale to Orbost, 58 miles, esti-
mated to cost £B6OO per mile ;
Orbost to border, near Dele-
gate, 73 miles, estimated to cost
£17,700 per mile, or a total of
£2,241,900 estimated, with-
out contingencies, &c.— ‘ ‘ These
lines would have steep-grades
for considerable lengths.”
These surveys dispose of the
oft-repeated statement that
this connection would afford
the shortest route Sydney to
Melbourne, as the through
lino would be 66 miles
longer than the present con-
nection. and with another
Blue Mountain experience.
How many years to con-
struct such a line, and what
value to such a stretch of
ountry? There is another
survey, Orbost to Bondi, on
the N.S.W. border, through
country with fewer engineer-
ing difficulties, but consider-
ably longer, and had in view a
connection with N.S.W. rails
at Eden. By this alternative
route the total distance Syd-
ney to Melbourne is 714 miles,
or 138 miles longer than by
existing line. Then, to com-
plete the scheme, it requires
some 50 miles to Twofold Bay
down a mountain side. What
price ? Coal would have to bo
brought by sea and hauled up
there after various handlings.
And the site is absolutely re-
moved from all the popula-
tion of Australia. Residence
there would be a gentle form
of banishment. But Twofold
Bay, “ with some outlay," can
afford anchorage for all the
fleets of Britain. This may
be true, but I think the British
Government will be hard to
persuade that they can im-
prove on the base for the
South Pacific squadron as
existing at Sydney.
* * *
Albury (and overland line
to Murrumburrah): This dis-
trict has a rainfall even less
than the places previously
mentioned, but Albury is about
the same. The summer
climate is, of course, much
inferior to any of the others,
and the only strong argument
in favor of any site here-
about is that it would
equalise the commercial ad-
vantage Melbourne v. Sydney.
I am not sure that even
Victoria .will attach much importance to that
argument, and we must not forget that while it
may be a case of pull Sydney pull Melbourne
there will be the preponderance of voters looking
on who will probably decide to squat down at a
convenient place and get to business on general
principles.
* • * *
Generally, so far as I am able to gather, not any
one of these places offers advantages for building
purposes at all comparable to the Canoblas site.
It furnishes on the spot granite, basalt, limestone
and marble, is 80 miles from coal and iron mines,
also potteries and earthenware works. lam not)
sure that it does not also include good building
sandstone within the area. It affords opportunity
for water-supply by gravitation within no greater
distance than 12 miles at furthest, and, I firmly
believe, sufficient water-power to supply electrio
light and traction. It affords opportunities for
drainage out of all comparison with any other
site, and it can be brought into connection with
all the railway-systems by the expenditure of
under .£50,000. And while it is virgin forest
there need be no difficulty about housing regi-
ments of workmen and officials during the progress
of construction, as, within a short hour’s drive or
less, there are the substantial towns of Orange,
Milthorpe, Blayney, and Carcoar. As to the
command of population and the formation .of
public opinion outside the existing capitals, it is,
after the above, within one or two hours by rail
of Bathurst, Lithgow, Wellington, Dubbo, Mo-
long, Parkes, Forbes, Cowra, Grenfell, and
Young.
m * * *
Space being available, it may be worth while to
invite further study of the railway system. The
gauges of Queensland and South Australia being
the same the completion of the lines indicated
means an unbroken transcontinental line from
near Adelaide to Rockhampton, Townsville, and
Normanton available for the same rolling stock.
With a sufficient water supply it is open to
the imagination to conceive an Australian Chicago
growing up at the connection of all those
lines situated as it is in the heart of the
great stock-raising prairies of Australia. And
I would-suggest to our Queensland friends that
they need be under no apprehension as to any
prejudicial effect arising from the overland line
coming on to Sydney. This would be essentially
a matter for the Inter-State Commission to see
even-handed justice done to all colonies, and,
as the matter could be dealt with in ad-
vance, and a fair understanding come to
before vested claims or conflicting interests had
arisen there need be no feeling in the matter. I
should be strongly opposed to cut rates to Sydney
to the detriment of Queensland’s developmental
lines, and the connection of the principal systems
on their own gauge would have a natural tendency
to prevent any desire in that direction.

A Judge’s Sudden Death.
HE WAS STRICKEN IN CHURCH—A
STRIKING LESSON TO THOSE WHO
NEGLECT TIMELY WARNINGS.
A learned judge was taken suddenly sick in
church, December 5, 1897, in the city of Brooklyn.
Four days later, in spite of the best medical aid,
he died. The doctors said the judge had kidney
disease and had lived a surprisingly long time,
everything considered.
A man or woman may live along for years with
incompetent kidneys, only to collapse as suddenly
as a house of cards when ithe baby’s hand knocks
it over. The early indications of Bright s Disease
are sometimes very slight—headaches, dull pains,
depressed feelings, lack of energy—ali these indi-
cate the first stages of Bright’s Disease, and yet
few people think they mean anything serious
until, often, it is too late.
There has never been but one discovery known
to the world and the medical profession for check-
ing Bright’s Disease in its beginning, or curing it
after it has progressed. That discovery, which is
so popular in Europe, America, and throughout
the world, is Warner’s Safe Cure.
If the learned judge, who was stricken m
church, had realised years before the secret power
that was undermining his life, he might have
counteracted it and lived to a green old age.
But he did not know !
And alas ! There are thousands of people to-
day who are upon the same dangerous road, and
who do not realise it. #

POLITICAL
POINTS
Federation once more preserves the Reid
Administration. Federation is the faithful "ser-
vant of—its enemies.
Since the publication of Drake’s paper,
Progress, a perceptible coolness has arisen be-
tween the leader of the Remnant and the Worker
gods.
E. B. Forrest, of Q. Leg. Council, lias de-
cided to leave the tranquil Upper House and run
for pne of the N. Brisbane seats in the Assembly.
There is no pay in the Council, and the field where
the perks grow has been eaten very bare.
The reduction of members of N.S.W. As-
sembly on the initiation of Federation will, it is
understood, be proposed to be by one-half, one-
third, or one-fourth of the present House. N.S.W.
began responsible life with an Assembly of 54.
Quite a lot of N.S.W. politicians are wait-
ing anxiously to see which way the cat will jump
before committing themselves on Federal matters.
But, unfortunately, the cat looks exactly the same
at each end, and it is difficult to guess which way
it intends jumping.
More or less authoritatively rumored that
when N.S.W. Upper House gets hold of the
Federal Bill it intends to move that the Referen-
dum be postponed for six months, and will refuse
to have anything else in the hope of, meanwhile,
working up strong opposition.
Exactly how N.S.W. Labor-party intends
to vote this time is still uncertain. The only two
“Solids ” to air their views up to date have been
Dick, M.P., for Newcastle, who urges everyone
to support the Bill; and the irreconcilable Hughes,
who is more against it than ever. All the rest
are on the fence.
The perturbed Sydney D.T. twists thus.:
The final verdict must rest with the electors, who have
to pay the penalty of their own decision. It may be that
that decision wili be in favor of risking this dangerous
Federal experiment. If that is the result, the community
must accept it, and make the best of it. N.S. Wales will
certainly suffer, hut Australia will certainly gain. If the
electors of N.S. Wales are larce-hearted enough to
penalise themselves for the benefit of the rest of the con-
tinent, their loss will be others’ gain. But at least we
shall have the satisfaction of knowing that, as far as this
journal is concerned, they will not enter into the Federal
compact uninformed upon the certain risks and the
possible loss they are incurring.
Curiosities of railway extension
in the Gulf country (N. Queensland):
Nomoanton wants the Cloncurry line,
and in less degree, Croydon-George
town extension. Doesn’t object
to land-grab syndicate railway,
but does not yearn for the deep-
water line. Croydon goes bald-
headed for the deep-water exten-
sion ; does not care a rap about
Cloncurry, is against any pri-
vate syndicate line, and favors
the Croydon - Georgetown
extension. Georgetown will
raise Cain if it does not
get connection with Chil-
lagoe; or, failing that,
Croydon thinks there
is such a place as
Cloncurry som e-
vhere ; takes no in-
terest in the deep-
water line, or, at
least, wants the
- " “ #
Croydon-Georgetown extension
first. Cloncurry must have its
own line, right through to deep-
«ater, and if it gets that—pri-
vate enterprise preferred—
doesn’t care what happens after.
And the result of the Gulf’s dis-
cordant cry for all these railways
is that it gets no railway at all.
What strange things hap-
pen in the Piebald Land ! Charles
Powers, ex-leaderof the Opposi-
tion, comes but as Go'vt. candi-*
date for Bundaberg. He de-
clares that he is an advocate
of one-man-one-vote, the re-
ferendum, old age pensions,
and “progressive legislation”
generally—and he proposes
to buy his way back to Par-
liament by hanging on to the
tail of the doddering Tory
auctioneer who runs the old crowd of boodlers
who have sat on the chest of every progressive
idea for the last nine years.
Charles Powers is the true political Q.
weathercock —twisting round with the varying
breeze to every point of the compass. Started —a
staunch M'llwraithian; then turned Oppositionist;
next, posed as a semi-Laborite ; retired into private
life in high dudgeon; now comes to the front as a
valiant Dicksonite.
W. T. Dick, one of the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
members, took an early and sudden opportunity
to declare for the amended Federation Bill. His
mining constituents must have awakened to the
fact that the neighboring provinces are their best
customers (Victoria alone took over 600,000 tons
of Newcastle coal last year) and they Avant to make
sure by Federation that Victoria can’t shut out
the N.S.W. product by a duty. Also, they want
to get the Queensland and Tasmanian duties taken
olf.
A motion to exclude Cabinet
Ministers from the directorates of
{mblio companies was rejected
ately in the Commons by 247 to
143 votes. Probably a similar
motion in any Australian Parlia-
ment would meet a similar fate.
All the same, however, it should
be forthcoming as part of a neces-
sary reform platform. In all the
Parliaments are found men on the
directorates of banks and other
companies and corporations, who
not only vote on measures affect-
ing the interests in their private
charge, but boldly harangue their
fellow-legislators and canvass for
votes in the direction that will
serve their pockets. It is to the
influence of such men that many
communities owe the want of State
banks, municipally-owned electrio-
lighting, and numerous other poli-
tical and social advantages.
The little town of Robert-
son, between Moss Vale and Jam-
beroo, though it is hopelessly inside
the 100-mile limit, is clamoring
for the Federal capital as loudly as
the rest. The writer was weather-
bound once all through a long, wet
day at Robertson in company with
about a dozen road - menders,
mostly recovering from the horrors,
and ail dea,d-broke, and offering,
with much blanky, to jump each
other for .£3 ; and in the morning
he paid 4s. 6d. for an old green
umbrella under which to pursue his
way to Jamberoo. And he begs to
say that unless all these road-
menders are dead, Robertson is
utterly unfit to be the capital of any
commonwealth.
Will the Cabbage-tree Mob
take Federation “ lying - down,”
or are Sydney Daily Tele-
graph, M’Laurin, Knox, Heydon, Neild, and co.
forging thunderbolts in secret? The Bulletin
bets that they are.
So far, S.A. Assembly elections next May
promise to be fought out on the questions of
Federation (always opposed by the Laborites),
capitation grant, and Leg. Council reform. An
already prominent feature is the way in which the
Tory crowd is spending money to undermine the
Democrats in their city and suburban strongholds.
S.A. Opposition - leader Downer, who
dramatically announced his approaching retire-
ment from polities six months ago, has already
decided to again contest an Assembly seat in May.
The S.A. Tories begin to dream of a Downer-
Playford combine, and allege that Kingston’s old
colleague, “ Honest Tom,” will be a strong oppo-
nent if elected.
STOICISM.
1ST JOHNNY : “By Jove, Percy, I was mistaken
for you last night."
2ND JOHNNY: “Indeed! and what did you do,
dear boy? ”
1ST J. : “Me! Oh, I bore it like a brick."
“Alia”: As Reidbane has been entered
for the Great Federal Capital Stakes, allow me to
nominate Bartonsburg—by Toby out of Patriot-
ism ; Turnerton, by Premier from Victoria ; Con-
stellation, from Southern Cross by Heavens ; and
Eucalypte, by Extract from Gum Leaf. Also
Forrestville, Tobiasburg and Kingston (most
euphonious of the lot).
“If the other Australian Premiers were
Sydney property-owners or shopkeepers, they
might have all voted for Sydney as the Federal
capital,” snapped Premier Reid when badgered by
certain Geebungs in N.S.W. Assembly. Where-
upon Sydney D.T. “ Sneering allusions to shop-
keepers are unsafe talk in a constituency like the
King. The shopkeepers’ vote is a factor there
more powerful than even the publicans’! ” Joss
is getting bashed.
PRO BONO PUBLICO.
DRUMMER (at outside pub): “ You aren't up to date here.
Why don’t you keep some toothpicks on your table?”
HOST: “Sure, an’ I bought some wanst; but they’re sich
thaves here they walked off wid ’em after they’d used
'em —till one by one they all wint.”
“ Jep.” : Contrary to most, I hold that G.
Reid’s No-Yes attitude did a lot for Federation.
A man walking straight along a street attracts no
attention, but, if he dodges and ducks behind
posts and dirtboxes, he begets interest. When
the “ same old George ” wriggled and circus-ated,
people said, “ What’s he up to? We’ll watch his
little game.” And they straightway studied
Federation.
Central Queensland Separationists are in a
queer pickle. If the Dickson party be returned,
autonomy for the Centre is hopeless. If the
Labor democrats gain power, autonomy is just as
far away, for the democratic legislators in the
South know that their constituents won’t hear of
Separation, while the North doesn’t care a rap
for the question so long as it gets as generous a
share of public plunder as Philp has thrown it
from time to time.
One very Cabbage-tree member of N.S.W.
Assembly, who talks much and says nothing, was
the other night advised to boil down thus his
meditated anti-Federal oration : —“ Mr. Speaker :
lam disgusted. Who is the author of this villain-
ous betrayal of our beloved New South Wales?
Why, him (pointing to Premier Reid) —him!
Toby Reid !” “ Toby Reid ”is a good nick-name.
It accurately indicates the N.S.W. Premier’s real
place in Federal history.
E. M. Lilley is a modest man, and thus
talks to the electors of Oxley :
I have a firm will and a firm determination. I have in-
herited a thing very much wanted in the House at pre-
sent—a spine I have been running up and down
the banks of the political river too long. lam in the
stream now, and will strike out for the other shore.
That’s the worst of Q. politicians—they’re always
making “ for the other shore ” —the opposite side
(where portfolios grow') to the one from which
they started. Most people knew the late Charles
Lilley had a spine, but no one ever heard him
talk about it.
There is something pathetic in the efforts
of poor Yes-No Reid, now that he has ac-
cepted the “Blot” and most of the other things
that he raved against in the old Federation Bill,
to prove that he hasn’t changed—that the only
reason why he and Barton are now on the same
side is that Barton lias slewed round. And his
cry that Barton, who led the majority at the
referendum of 3rd June, has “swung into line
with public sentiment,” is a mournful effort to
retreat with dignity and save his tail from being
trampled on in the rout.
The new N.S.W. Federation Enabling
Bill provides that a bare majority, is to decide,
and also permits the electors to record their votes
wheresoever they please, not restricting them to
their own electorates. The Premier can truly say
that the former provision was insisted upon by the
Premiers’ Conference, but the cool insertion of the
second one without a word of explanation convicts
the N.S.W. Ministers of the rankest treachery in
the matter of the first Referendum. Then they
sought to defeat the Bill; now they are interested
not only in its safe passage, but also in securing h
record vote for future ufee against Barton.
The Governor-General of the Australian
Commonwealth will, no one doubts, be
an imported official, but what about the Lieu-
tenant-Governors of the respective States ? Will
Britain surrender its patronage in respect of the
States without a diplomatic struggle ? At present,
Lieutenant-Governorships go mainly to the Chief-
Justices, but Lord Stanley, when controlling the
Home Office, pressed hard for the right of sending
out not only Governors but Lieutenant-Governors
to Australia. The British reason which moved
Stanley for direct representation in the sub-
Governorships will be stronger in the circum-
stances created by Federation.
Brisbane Telegraph, although widely cir-
culated locally, seems to have no influence what-
ever in guiding the political destinies of Q. It
strongly warned Premier Dickson, under pain of
all sorts of things, to ignore Federation in his
manifesto—and Dickson jauntily came out as a
warm Federalist! Shortly before Byrnes became
Premier the erratic organ described him as “ im-
possible,” and, after his death, shrieked loudly for
the return of Tozer as the only man capable of
leading the Govt. But nobody took any notice,
and Tozer was not sent for. It now screams at
the top of its weak voice for a reconstructed
Cabinet—and Ministers smile.
One of the ever-present incentives of
Sydney D.T. to destroy the Federation Bill as now
drafted is that under it newspaper-postage will be
a necessity-in N.S.W. The S.M. Herald can
afford to pay postage better than the Telegraph.
The Herald is budded on a rock—it still has a
practical monopoly, founded on long-established
custom, of the domestic and certain other classes
of advts., whereas the D.T.’s circulation is
based on the paper’s attractiveness alone. The
Herald’s grip is such that in N.S.W. you can’t
be born legitimately, or be married respectably, or
die and go to Heaven, unless the event is adver-
tised in its columns. So that any handicap im-
posed on the daily press could be best carried by
the elder paper.
Premier Reid at the opening of the Federal
session of N.S.W. Parliament:
I assured Premier Turner that I could not undertake
with a reasonable prospect of success the campaign of
Federation in this province (N.S.W.) unless I had the
assurance of the capital being in this province. . . . The
capital, too, will be as near the 100 miles limit (from
Sydney) as possible, because it must be on one of the
great trunk lines of the province, and must be as near as
possible to one of the great cities.
If Premier Reid actually said these things, as the
S.M. Herald reports, then he knowingly busted
up the truth twice. N.S.W. gave a majority of
over 5000 for Federation without any assurance
that the capital would be in N.S.W., so there
were plenty of prospects of success. And the
Federal capital may be close up to the 100-miles
limit from Sydney, or again it may not, just as
the Federal Parliament decides. Further, there
is nothing in the contract about it being on one
of the great trunk l nes, and even if it is, that
doesn’t prove that it will be close to Sydney—it
may be on the great trunk line at Armidale.
Apparently the Federal Referendum is
going to be loaded in the provincialist interest
this time also. The Bill now before N.S.W.
Parliament provides that, if the people accept the
Federal constitution by a majority, Parliament
may send the measure to the British Government
for approval—or again it may not; it may simply
drop it and let the will of the people go hang. So
Federation has one show—that of winning at the
polls ; while provincialism has two—it may win at
the polls, or, if it loses there, it may contrive at
the last moment to get Parliament to upset the
popular decision. Is the Labor-Party—The only
one which supports the absolute Referendum—
HE KNEW ELEVEN CERTAINTIES.
THE ORTHODGX ONE: “ My positive young friend,
in this vale of change and unrest there’s no such
thing as a certainty.”
THE UNORTHODOX ONE: “ Rot! Why don't yer
read the papers? There’s eleven certainties ,
now they’ve picked Ircdale and Howell."
going to kick this time and demand that the will
of the people shall be absolutely decisive? And
how would the country like it if the proposed
system was applied to general elections? Let
the old Parliament remain in existence till after
the new one is elected, and when the returns come
in let it decide whether Dacey, who got 568 votes
at Botany, shall have the seat, or whether it shall
be given to the other fellow who got 521.

“ Yes, we have had this trip a decidedly interesting:
voyage,” said Mr. A. G. Bell, supercargo of the Pacifio
Islands Company’s steamer Emu, yesterday, upon arrival
of that vessel in Sydney. . . . We secured the first
sea-serpent ever brought to Australia—perhaps to any
other place. . . . The representative of the Pacific
Islands Company remarked that he intended to present
the skeleton to Sydney Museum. "It was a pity,” he
said, “that only the two heads, the two backbones, and
part of the ribs had been secured,” but as the supercargo
observed, “to stay longer collecting the remains would
have nauseated the collectors, perhaps beyond recovery.”
. . . In their descriptions both the supercargo and the
captain agree. They say that its hide or skin was a
brownish color, and covered with hair ; that the heads
somewhat resemble horses’ heads. The approximate
weight of the great sea-serpent, whence the remains
aboard the Emu were taken, is given at not less than 70
tons, its length fully 60ft.—S.M. Herald.

Dear Bulletin.— Charles Williams (Lon-
don Chronicle) did not, as you say in a recent
issue, “give away” the shooting of the wounded
dervishes in the Soudan, because the portions of
his messages dealing with the matter were sup-
pressed. The actual “giving away” was per-
formed by E. N. Bennett, dilettante “special ” of
Westminster Gazette, but his statements may
have been exaggerated—though there has been no
effective reply so far to his damning article in Jan.
Contemporary Review. There is no doubt there
was an excessive slaughter of the dervishes by the
Soudanese troops—not by white troops, and cer-
tainly not, as far as can appear, with the cogni-
sance of British officers. Omdurman, from begin-
ning to end, was a butchery, a battue —“ the black
chaps on the other side never had a chance.”—X.X.
Moy Sing, a Chinaman 40 years in Aus-
tralia and 22 in Glen Innes, announces his inten-
tion of taking a trip to the Flowery Land, thereby
exciting discord among the whites of the North.
Some like Moy so well that they propose to ban-
quet and present him with a purse; others de-
nounce the move as unworthy of Britishers and
Australians. The local Examiner says such a
farewell will bring “ a time-honored custom into
derision.” Meanwhile, Moy Sing, who appears
to have displayed some good white virtues, stands
by, childlike and bland. The Bulletin hopes
that, if Moy Sing has white friends who esteem
him asaman, they will manfully testimonialise him.
That won’t be saying that Australia has a welcome
in store for the rank-and-file of Chinamen.
A. O. Sachse, who must be about the
youngest fatman in Melb. Leg. Council, lately
returned to Melb. from a trip to Europe, and this
joyful event was celebrated by a “friendly gather-
ing ” of ehampagners at Scott’s Hotel. Two or
three daily pressmen having been lured to the
liquor, Sachse naturally made a speech, and a
report of his valuable “impressions of Europe”
appeared in next morning’s papers. How simple
is the manufacture of Fame ! Sachse goes ’Ome.
Sachse comes back and acquaints two or three
paragraphists with his “feeling of satisfaction
that his lot has been cast in so fair a land,” and
informs them that he doesn’t find Melbourne
looking any smaller than when he left it, and the
paragraphists convey Sachse’s thrilling announce-
ments to the newspaper readers, and to all intents
and purposes Sachse is famous.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to tneir advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
From this distance, most British criminal
trials look very fair, but it is notable that John-
son, tried the other day for stealing the Duchess of
Sutherland’s jewels, was arraigned under an Act
of George IV. as a person indicted for a felony
after a previous conviction. This procedure not
only gives the Judge power to order penal servi-
tude for life, but puts the jury in possession of the
fact of a previous conviction.

A Debilitated Nervous
System.
RESTORED TO ITS NATURAL VIGOR.
THE CASE OF
Mrs. William Hanchett.
{From, the Windsor, N.S.W., “Australian”)
(by our special reporter.*)
“No one knows bow I’ve suffered,”
said Mrs. Hanchett, of Macquarie Street,
Windsor, New South Wales, to a reporter
from the Windsor and Richmond Gazette,
v ho waited upon her with a view to obtain-
ing an account of her ailment and her
recovery.
“From what did you suffer, Mrs. Han-
chett ? ”
“ From
Bloodlessness and Nervous-
ness;
also from awful nervous headaches. First,
my appetite began to go, till I didn’t care
if I never saw food. Then the headaches
came on, generally twice a day, and lasting
an hour or more at a time. Whilst they
lasted the pain can only be described as
agonising. My head was fairly racked with
it. The pain was of a piercing, shooting
character, and flew backwards and forwards
all round my head like sharp
Knives in My Brain.
As the days went on I wasted away. I did
not seem to have sufficient blood to keep
me going, and, although I tried all sorts of
nourishing foods, they did me no good. My
face became pale and waxy, and my lips
were as white as my face. The whole of
the day
I Felt Languid and Tired.
My household duties, which I formerly did
in the course of an hour or so, now proved
too much for me. Why, if I only tried to
wash up the tea tilings I should have to
give it up and sit down. My nights were
always restless, and it’s nothing but the
plain truth when I tell you I didn’t get ten
ninutes’ sleep from the time I went to bed
till I got up in the morning. It wasn’t long
before my
Nervous System Broke Down
jnder the strain that was put on it through
the want of sleep. I was so nervous that I
positively daren’t go to bed at all without a
light burning. If I dropped a knife I
screamed out loud. Little things like this
gave such a shock to my nerves. I was
frightened to go out at nights, even with
someone with me. This may not seem re-
markable to you, but when I tell you that
before I was ill I could go anywhere across
the bush in the blackest night without the
least hesitation you w'ill understand what
a change my
illness Wrought in Me.”
“ Your nervous system must have been
very weak.”
“It was, indeed. My nerves were all un-
strung. If anyone spoke to me unex-
pectedly I trembled like a leaf. I wouldn’t
answer the door unless I was absolutely
obliged. I didn’t care to see strangers at
all, but felt I should like to be away from
everyone.”
“ Did you keep up your spirits under all
these afflictions ?”
“No ; I don’t believe anyone could. I
became very low spirited. Things which
formerly gave me pleasure did not now
interest me. When neighbours or friends
lame in to have a chat to try and liven me
up a bit, I should merely say yes and no ;
and, to tell you the truth, although I appre-
ciated their goodwill and kindness, I was
always
Pleased to See Them Go.”
“ Did you take any medicine for your
complaint?”
“ Oh, yes ! I took many different things
till I really got tired of taking physic.
Some of the medicines and pills I took were
advertised to cure complaints such as mine
in two or three weeks.”
“Did these so-called remedies do what
they pretended ?”
“They did nothing at all, except the
pills, and these gave much pain to swallow,
and I could feel them
Sticking at the Bottom
of my throat for hours afterwards. I be-
lieve I should have been just as well off if I
had saved the money I spent on these
things and swallowed bread pills and
water.”
“ Did a doctor see you ? ”
“ Yes ; and prescribed for me, but unfor-
tunately his medicine proved of no value in
my case. I was really in a very precarious
state, and, what was worst of all, the future
held out to me no hope of getting better.
One must get better or worse. One doesn’t
remain stationary in sickness, and I recog-
nised that cLy by day I was growing a little
worse.”
“ But you look alright now. How do you
account for the change ? ”
“ My husband brought me home a bottle
of Clements Tonic. He said, ‘ you must try
this,’ and, as he insisted, I took a few doses,
but I must confess with very little hope of
any good.”
“ Did it have any good effect?”
“ Yes ; my nerves felt slightly calmer in
tone, so I continued taking Clements Tonic,
and I was very pleased to find that it
enabled me to sleep better at night. I now'
felt
Sure of My Ground,
and I never missed a dose. The condition
of my nerves improved every day, and along
with this I lost that despondent, hopeless
view of life, and began to look forward to
health and strength again. Nor was I dis-
appointed. I steadily improved, my head-
aches went, and once more I could take a
Cheerful interest in my daily work and
surroundings. Clements Tonic
Plucked Up My Spirit!
wonderfully. It braced me up all over, and
I soon began to eat well and put on flesh.
That strange waxy appearance of the skin
changed to a healthy hue, and by a steady
use of Clements Tonic I gradually attained
my present
State of Health and Strength.
I am not a bit nervous, and I can go any-
where and do anything without the least
feeling of fear. If you like to see my hus-
band he can endorse what I’ve said, and
he can also tell you what good Clements
Tonic did for him.”
“ What ailed him ? ”
“ He got ill through exposure, and he got
so thin that a four suit fitted him when he
once wore a six, and that was too small; so
you can guess how
He Fell Away.
His liver was affected, for he got as yellow
as a guinea. Clements Tonic put him right,
and lie’s working to-day.”
“ May I publish all this in our paper? ”
“ Certainly.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Alice Hanciiktt, of Macquarie Street, Windsor, in
the Colony of New South Wales, do solemnly and sin-
cerely declare that I have carefully read the annexed
document, consisting of nine folios, and consecutively
numbered from one to nine, and that it contains and
is a true and faithful account of my illness and cure
by Clements Tonic, and also contains my full
permission to publish the same in any way ; and I
make this solemn declaration, conscientiously be-
lieving the same to be true and by virtue of the
provisions of an Act. made and passed in the
ninth vear of the reign of her present Majesty,
intituled “ An Act for the more effectual abolition of
Oaths and Allirmalions taken and made in the various
Departments of ihe Government of New South Wales,
and to substitute Declarations in lieu thereof, and
for the suppression of voluntary and extra-judicia.
Oaths and Affidavits.”
Declared at Windsor this
before me,
28th day of July, 1898,
W. F. LINSLEY, J.r.


“Safety”: I accepted the invitation in last
week’s Bulletin of the manager of the Sydney Safe
Deposit to visit its vaults in Ash-street, and certainly
the place may he classed as one of the sights of Sydney.
Iu knocks Darlinghurst hollow for strength, and should
be as effective in keeping burglars out as the great gaol
is the other way. The place is a mass of steel and con-
crete, and documents of any kind or other valuables
stored there must he absolutely secure against tire or
burglars. The time-locks on the doors are most interest-
ing.*
A selection of Roderic Quinn’s verses
will be published, in dainty booklet form, by The
Bulletin, on 15th March, under the title “ The
Hidden Tide.” The price will be Is. 6d. post-
free, and the collection will include, among other
gems, “The Camp Within the West.”
When Mr. Borchgrevink arrives at the
South Pole, he will find there the proverbial
Scotchman smoking his “cutty ” and reading the
latest telegram by the light of an “Albatross
Lamp Wick,” which “ douses the glim ” of any
other illuminant, and, better still, saves his
“pouch ” half the expense in oil.*
“ Nature is exceedingly careful to preserve
the type, but she is often very reckless about the
compositor.”— James Payn.
Concerning the end of the boot-box case :
In passing sentence at the boot-trunk trial, Chief Jus-
tice Madden accused Radalyski (whose deafness stood her
in good stead for the first time) of “ carrying on a trade
of detestable frequency ” —yet not one word of evidence
was adduced during the whole proceedings to show that
she had ever been a professional abortionist. In fact, the
worst that could be alleged against her was that she was
an ignorant novice, experimenting upon the unhappy girl
whose death she caused. His Honor then “ rounded ”on
Tod, and told him that, though he was recommended to
mercy, the Governor “ might see fit to make an example
of you for the education of this country”; then went
on'to remind Tod that he had few days remaining to
him on earth, and that he should prepare to seek mercy
from that Judge whom, &c., &c.—a most inhuman
method of applying mental torture to the prisoner, whom
he perfectly well knew no Executive would ever dare to
hang for the so-called murder. Such judicial rant and
limelight business will, however, have one good effect —
it will hasten the day when a jury’s recommendation will
be absolute. That day should have arrived long ago, for
it is an affront to humanity, to say nothing of Democracy,
that any posturing official should have the power to
throw off cruel and empty threats at convicted persons
who have been practically promised mercy by their
fellow-citizens empanelled to try them. People have
long noticed, by the way, that the conduct of His Honor
in a one-day case and another where there is an adjourn-
ment overnight are in remarkable contrast, especially if
a question of “moral” obliquity is concerned. In the
case dealt with straightaway, Judge Madden is the non-
chalant, good-natured man-of-tbe-world, with an appre-
ciation of and reasonable allowance for all human frail-
ties, while, if the hearing should last till morning,
he will turn up a cold-eyed ascetic with a curly mous-
tache, prepared to “deal it out” to anybody who winks
a roving eye. It was the case of a Yarra Bend warder
charged with kissing a warderess that first drew pointed
attention to this judicial peculiarity. The accused
seemed to be merely a careless young fellow of lively dis-
position in the afternoon. Next morning he was a base
and brutal libertine, and went up for two years’ hard.
Tod is really convicted and sentenced to death—not for
murder, or abortion, or anything of that sort, but for dis-
posing of the body. “Just think of the way they dis-
posed of the body,” sang the sweet bard, Purtell, and
Judge Madden has been thinking of it. The charge
against Tod for murder is the first that has ever been laid
in Victoria against the man who “got the girl into
trouble.” Had Tod simply continued to sit in his
office when Dubberke announced the girl’s death, and
taken no part in the boot-box, the law would have done
no more than ask his evidence at the most.
Dootor and Inquisitor.
Tiib evidence of Dr. Shields, Vic. Govt,
medical officer, at the Boot trunk trial comes
as a startling surprise to the average citizen ;
The Bulletin ventures to presume, also to the
medical profession. Dr. Shields was not called
at the inquest, but when the trial started,
Crown Prosecutor Smith announced him as
chief witness for the Crown, and even Dub-
berke herself had to concede the star position
to the pawky Caledonian. Dr. Shields calmly
admitted that Madame Olga had told him how
she was treating the girl Ambrose when the
latter died, and though pressed to say who
had brought up the subject, he would neither
assert that the woman did so, nor deny that
it was he himself. “ I suppose you would
not be contemptible enough to go and
pump the woman and then expose her ? ”
asked solicitor Levy for the defence, ad-
ding, “It is not part of your duty as Covt.
Medical Officer.” The braw Shields took a
long breath—“ Ay, yes, sometimes.” “What?”
demanded Levy —“ to get evidence out of
prisoners ? ” Shields responded, “ Yes, a’
that a’ can.” He went on to qualify his admis-
sion by narrowing it down to suspected-lunacy
cases, but, with all his qualifications, the fact
remains that Madame Olga asserted and Dr.
Shields did not deny (1) that in his capacity
of gaol doctor he interviewed her officially and
professionally while she was on remand upon a
charge of murder. (2) He and she spoke of
the crime with which the woman was charged,
and she expressed a desire to know what had
really caused the girl’s death. (3) He offered
to tell her the cause if she told him the circum-
stances leading up to the death. (4) Madame
Olga did so. Shields assured her she would
not be hanged—and he promptly communicated
with the detectives. The absolute indecency
of a gaol-doctor making any reference to the
crime for which his patient is detained seems
to have never struck Shields or any of the
others engaged in the case ; therefore, in Melb.
official circles, it seems to be regarded as quite
the proper thing for the doctor of a gaol to
reveal confidences which would be regarded as
absolutely sacred by doctors in ordinary prac-
tice. The ideal doctor—ay, even the average
doctor—whether practising in or out of prison,
is a man to whom a patient can talk as freely
and as safely as to a clergyman ; and a gaol-
doctor’s relations with prisoners are of such a
character that any information which he may
obtain from them against themselves should, in
the interests of humanity and the noblest of all
professions, be inadmissible in any court of
law. What have the medical societies to say
upon this matter?
M'Donald-Paterson, the bellicose and beefy
Q. politician who sat on Byrnes in ’96, has deserted
his late colleague, Fraser, and will seek re-election
on his merits. It is alleged against M‘D.-P. that
he attended a hole-and-corner meeting of unco
guid Presbyterians and was “ persuaded ” to drop
I'raser—wha disna gang tae the kirk, ye ken—and
pick up a God-fearing mate. Considering that
Fraser’s popularity more than Paterson’s pom-
posity lifted both into the Assembly in ’96, it is
not unlikely that the abandoned one and a Demo-
crat will carry the double electorate.

Stean>ing-hot weather kept a good many people
away from Caulfield last Saturday, and perhaps accounted
for several 'osses not coming to the front. The valuable
Oakleigh Plate, which has often been a trustworthy public
trial for a number of Newmarket Handicap fancies, was
a very unsatisfactory event, except for the hackers of
Stand Off. The field got away in a closely-packed mob,
with half-a-dozen or more of them in apparently hopeless
positions, and ran two furlongs at a pace which gave any-
thing in the front rank a chance to slip suddenly ahead.
Then Stand Off rushed six lengths in front of the crowd, and
held his lead to the end in what was practically a 3)£
furlongs sprint. Carrying 7st. lib., Stand Off took tsec.
longer for the journey than Resolute's time last year.
Hymettus and Whakawatea, the two top-weights, were
the only horses that seemed to be seriously chasing the
winner when he passed the post, and, although Stand Off
won very easily, the present writer doesn’t expect Earn-
shaw’s gelding to repeat his success (with a penalty up)
in the straight six-furlongs race at Flemington.
Hymettus, who will be rid of some superfluous
flesh by next Saturday, is likely to beat all the Oakleigh
Plate crowd in the Newmarket Handicap, yet “ on
paper” he has the worst of it with North British, whilst
on last year’s form the carefulty preserved Reaper might
beat them both in a fairly run race. To make a wild guess
at the Newmarket result, the writer takes the seasoned
Gozo geldings, North British and Reaper, to beat Hymet-
tus, Hopscotch, Symmetry (or Bobadil), Beachcomber
and Alix.
North British again is worth considering for
the Australian Cup, although he has not been specially
prepared for a long journey. Wait-a-Bit, but for the
doubt as to his being quite himself just now, would look
to have a great chance, for the horse that could nearly
wear down The Grafter at the finish of Melb. Cup must
be a genuine stayer when well. Reka, Alemene, Le Var,
and even George Frederick (in spite of a dickey foreleg
and a bad performance on Saturday), are suspected of in-
tentions to win the Australian Cup. Something or other
will, in the present writer’s opinion, beat Bobadil, who
figures at time of writing as a 6-to-2 chance. The run-
ning on the first day at Flemington is pretty certain to
throw light on the Australian Cup question. If Reka
runs well in the Essendon Stakes, the writer will prefer
him to North British, Alemene, and Wait-a-Bit next
Tuesday.
George Gray, who has backed his horses heavily
many times when he might as well have given the money to
a hospital, enjoyed his first win last Saturday, when, in
the natural course of good things, the owner wasn't on it
for more than a “ tender” or so. Two-year-old Chesney,
full brother to Malvrtlio and Maluma—and a noble-looking
youngster at that —broke the run of Mr. Gray’s bad luck
by winning all the way at its first attempt in public.
Upon the colt coming back to scale there was a “demon-
stration ” of the kind which daily newspapers attribute
to public regard for a plucky sportsman and so forth.
About 30 people in the grand stand enclosure clapped
their hands violently together in honor of G.G.’s gee-gee.
And those 30 enthusiasts were mostly Ikey Mo jubilating
over the victory of Gray’s unbacked horse, and devoutly
hoping that he would be thereby encouraged to plunge
on his next loser. Cynical, but true.
• • • •
As evidencing how betting on Oakleigh Plate
differed in Victoria and N.S. Wales last Saturday, it is
worth mention that while the winner, Stand Off, started
at eights as little as threes and fours was taken about him
at Moorefield—in fact the’books could lay Stand Off where
they had no chance of doing business about Vigorous,
who was favorite at the fall of the flag. Also, though
the Vic. candidate, Veneda, started second favorite (a 5
to 1 chance) it was marketable to very little in Sydney,
and then only at fairly long odds.
• • * •
In suburban races, not many horses carry as
much money as did the comparatively unknown nag
Royal "Purple in Kogarah Stakes at Moorefield last Satur-
day. Front “ your own price ” he was backed right down
to evens, but didn’t show any particular dash, and
finished a poor second. Whereupon there was joy in the
ranks of Israel.

Sydney suburban horse-racing is getting “stiffer”
than any pony-racing that ever was, yet stewards look on
and make no move. Most barefaced cases of “roping"
have been passed unnoticed during the past few weeks.
A horse can put up two exactly opposite performances
on the same day, and his connections will not even be
called upon for an explanation. Awhile back Sydney
D.T. threatened to do some good, and effectually drew
attention to several evil-smelling cases, but the scribe
with the good intentions has evidently either died or
been mislaid. The’Erald’s sporting scribe has apparently
been for some years as dead as some of the horses that
pretend to be running locally. Wanted, a well-paid and
remorseless stipendiary steward.

Touching Worrall’s pretensions to the captaincy
of the Australian Eleven, somebody—evidently a very
naice, genteel person—suggests that “ the point as to
whether Worrall can lead the team off the field is very
delicate ; Jack's position in life is a lowly one and he might
well shrink from the social tasks that fall to the lot of a
cricket captain.” Wherefore this journal plumps for
Worrall with all its might. The Eleven wants a captain
who will be as lowly as possible when he isn't whopping
the leather, or otherwise assisting to win the game, and
who will make cricket his only task throughout the tour.
Australia will gladly erect a monument to the first
captain who goes ’Ome strictly on business and keeps his
mouth closed at “social functions,” except for moderate
eating and drinking purposes.

“ Yes, Giff has sulked his last chance away,”
says “ J.S.” in a letter to Tub Bulletin. “ We all
admit the immense value of George’s services in the past
to Australian cricket, hut it looks to me that his action
last season in standing out of first-class cricket has had
such an injurious effect upon his play that to recover his
previous brilliancy at his age is impossible."
• * • •
“ Giffen states that he will play if he can get
leave. The picking of the team so late has made it
awkward for him, as he is a civil servant. He cannot
apply for leave until Monday, and the application will
have to go before the Cabinet. There will be no meeting
of the latter till noon on Tuesday, so that under any cir-
cumstances he does not expect to be able to get away till
Tuesday.” The idea of Premier Kingston and colleagues
sitting in solemn conclave on the application of a third-
class Post-office official for a week orso’s leave of absence 1

Cricket, even more than horse-racing, is respon-
sible for some shocking “ tripe ” in daily journalism. A
recent leader in Melb. Argus, re the squabble between
Majah Wardill and the Sydney Association, started with
this solemn declaration “The prevailing- feeling in re-
gard to the cricket difference is one of great regret that
it has occurred. ” And ended with the pathetic, sugges-
tion— “ Surely peace with honor is not an impossible
termination of the present difference.” How weakening
for the young Australian intellect 1
* * * •
“Noss” Iredale says that “Windsor, next to
Tom M'Kibbin, is the best slow bowler in Australia.” As
there is some fear of the latter being no-balled in Eng-
land, it is within the bounds of possibility that Windsor
may be picked for the trip.
* * * *
Newell’s failure and Duff’s success in the Ban-
nerman benefit emphasise the suggestion that Duff
should have had the place given to the oft-tried Waver-
leyite.

Victor Trum per put up another big score on
Saturday, when he made 253 against Maoriland. The
innings was very dashing, and without a chance until 249
had been scored. Trumper has now played three inninirs
of over 200 runs this season.

Sydney’s leading oriokot expert tips the follow-
ing as the All-England team :—Jackson, J. T. Brown,
M'Laren, Storer, Hearne, Abel, Richardson, Ranji,
Grace, Townsend, Rhodes, Hayward, and Albert Trott—
thirteen in ail. But he has fancies about Qiiaife, R. J.
Mason. Stoddart, and Wynyard, the Hampshire nugget.
The blank spaces in Australia's team he fills up with
Johns, Iredale (certainties), M'Kibbin, Howell (or Pye),
and Graham (or Trumpet'). He admits that he has one
player too many, but simply regrets the fact. Inclines to
the exclusion of Howell (or Pye).

In Vic. Pennant-cricket, three clubs are leading
for first place. Carlton is slightly in the van on
averages. Warne got 131 for Carlton v. St. Kilda on
Saturday, which makes his aggregate in pennant-games
822 for five completed innings—average 164’2. Five
times in the last six years his average has been consider-
ably over 60, and, as he is an excellent leg-break bowler
and fine field, he is just about the most under-rated
cricketer in Victoria.

Is plunging a lost art with Sydney swimmers?
Fifty-four feet won the year’s supremacy of N.S.W. the
other day. All the competitors except the winner, Kelly
from Kiama, lacked the essential qualification —avoir-
dupois. Previous champions and good performers were
Tom Moloney, Harry Mub ahy, Pierre Stapleton and W. H.
Pratt—all very little under ifist.

Champion swimmers Lane and Bishop met over
a 100yds. course for the third time at West Sydney
Swimming Club’s annual carnival last Saturday afternoon,
and on this occasion Lane got home first. The start was
wretched. Starter standing on the left front of the men,
warned them he would only say “go!” Lane watched
the official’s lips and, as they parted to utter the word,
bounded into the air and reached the water ere Bishop
realised that the contest had begun. His task was then
hopeless. Lane led throughout and finished four or five
yds. to the good in lmin. 2J/gsee. — a new Australian
record if the Swimming Association passes it, but in the
circumstances such a proceeding is unlikely. Efforts are
beitig made by Bishop’s friends to bring the pair together
again at once.
• • • *
Lane, the brilliant N.S.W. champion swimmer
and holder of several Australasian premierships, having
easily beaten other amateur aquatic athletes over every
distance excepting 100yds., yearns for a tilt at the
old-country champions, and has determined to leave
for England so as to reach there in time for the
opening of this year’s swimming season. With “Jack”
Hellings, Percy Cavil] and Fred Lane in evidence Austra-
lia’s end should be well sustained. Cavill will, no doubt,
leave his mark among the professionals, while the other
two may be relied upon to, between them, make things
sultry for the amateur section.

Miss Irene Pritchard is the first young lady to
heat the boys at their own game. On Saturday last she
sailed the Zephyr to victory in the contest for the Bft.
championship, at Johnston’s Bay, Sydney. A lady sailed
the Maid of Kent when she beat the Irex in England, but
sailing the decked-in 24ft. Maid and Miss Pritchard’s open
Bft. cockleshell are vastly different matters.
• • • •
Prof, rowing is so dead in N.S.W. that it is
quite an event to hear of a-race. Tressider and Worboys
met at Raymond Terrace last Saturday in the presence
of a big crowd, but the betting was paralysed, as the
thing was looked upon as a foregone conclusion for Tres-
sider. Worboys led for a mile, but tired later on, and
Tressider, passing him as he liked, rowed home alone.
• • • •
Some fine tennis was shown in the match for
the captaincy of Sydney Club, at the S.C.G. on Saturday,
when Curtis, the previous holder, was beaten by Goddard.
Although defeated Curtis played a great game, and
showed what a really wonderful player he is. Two years
ago, when a boy of 19, he ran away with the champion-
ship, but was medically ordered to give tennis a spell,
and has since played onlv occasionally in doubles. Last
Saturday, without practice, he was able to go out and
win two sets straight against an improving player in the
pink of form, and was only just beaten in the" third by
his condition giving out. Curtis is a wonderfully active
player, and wins most of his games by smart work at the
net—in which position he is unequalled.

Megson, after his first-class handicap win, was
a strong favorite for the Orient Plate, at Sydney’s electric-
light bike races, with Forbes and “Newhaven” Jackson
next at 3 to 1, and Walne, Beauchamp, and Lewis at 4’s.
“Your own price ” was going about Denning, and, even
when he was half-a-lap to the good, the general opinion
was that he would “come hack,” and only odd offers of
10 to 1 were taken. Denning showed the “ cracks ” who
can’t race without pacing that a man can ride in the lead
and still win a race. Most of said cracks appear to be of
opinion that the only way to win is to lie as nearly last as
possible until the last lap, and then, if not blocked, put
in a gallery-finish on the outside.

A familiar face will be seen no more at Sydney
Caf6 Francais. To the portly, taciturn Mr. Joseph
Roberts the Fates have said “ Domino ! ” “ Joe ”
Roberts, the Napoleon of dominoes, who was drowned ab
Coogee the other day, was widely-known in sporting
circles a decade or more ago. He negotiated some of the
biggest commissions on the turf in the days when the
Thompsons, Barnard, and men of their kidney made it
possible to work-off something big. As a domino-player,
he had no Australian peer ; also, he was a fine billiard-
player in his day, and he had held his own with very
famous European whist-players.

Footballer Jack Conlon, of the Pirates, rose
another rung on the pug. ladder, last Saturday night,
when, at Golden Gate Athletic Club (Sydney), he put
Johnny Melaney to sleep inside two rounds by a stiff
punch on the right spot, and much disgusted 500 on-
lookers with the brevity of the contest. Conlon has im-
proved much since he beat Mansfield some time since, and
as he is full of grit and can deal out weighty thumps,
should win many battles if judiciously matched.

Strong man Sampson shook the dust of Aus-
tralia from his feet last week, and departed whence he
came by the German liner Barbarossa. His exit was
sudden, whatever the cause ; as, a couple of days before,
he talked of a Maoriland tour, and also spoke about con-
ducting a school of physical culture in Sydney on the
same lines as that of Sandow in London. ’ Sampson had
none too rosy a time of it in Australia, as everywhere he
went the cry of “ fake ” was heard.
* * * *
Re the proposed tug-of-war— Foley and Oxenham
v. Sampson—Foley waited on the strong man one day
last week ready to post £5O, but Sampson explained that
he had made up his mind to quit Australia next day, and
unless the match could be consummated within 24 hours
it would not pay him to stay. Larry suggested that there
was a possibility of raising the stakes to £5OO a-side if the
man of muscle could see his way clear to defer his depar-
ture for three or four weeks, but it was no go. Sampson
had made up his mind to leave, and leave he did.

There is in Sydney at present a powerfully-
built German wrestler, Rennert by name, who cannot
speak a word of English. He was a fireman aboard the
Prince Regent Lni pold up to the time of her last trip
here, but some of his countrymen kept him back to make
a match with Harry Dunru* Rennert, who is reported
very fit. now, has challenged the crack Cumberland man
to a bout at Grasco-Roman for a big stake, but Dunn
insists on three styles, asserting that he does not claim
to he a first-class Grieco-Roman wrestler. This has
brought negotiations to a standstill. The Gemian knows
absolutely nothing about any other style, though he
might learn a great deal very quickly. Rennert is young,
exeipfionally strong, active, nicely put together, and, as
far as appearances go, seems capable of anything in the
“ rastling” line.

It is good to bo a gentleman and a house-

what did Mr. Tod say to you ? ” queried His
Honor in his usual suave tones.
List week was buried in Waverley (Syd-
ney) Cemetery a young Italian, Pietro Munari,
not 34 years of age, but whose life was crowded
with incident. In Italy, Munari took a pro-
minent part in local politics, and made himself so
obnoxious to the authorities that any impending
election saw him under arrest as a precautionary
measure on the part of the powers, who feared
the influence of his socialistic eloquence. Subse-
quently, in Sydney, Munari engaged in various
directions as an earnest social reformer, and was
prominently connected with the Italian Workers’
Association, of which society he was secretary.
As the outcome of his experiences beneath the
Southern Cross, he published a book, “An
Italian in Australia,” which had an Italian cir-
culation of some 20,000 copies, and was thoroughly
reviewed and noticed by the journalistic and
magazine press of Italy, besides attracting con-
siderable notice from the French and German
socialistic organs. The funeral of this gifted
socialistic enthusiast was largely attended by
political sympathisers and co-workers, as well as
by many of his compatriots, and addresses and
original poems were delivered over his grave by
Messrs. Francis Seeusa (president of the Italian
Workers’ Union) and Datillo Rubbo, the well-
known artist.
THE BEAUTY OF THE
MASSEY-HARRIS
BICYCLE
Has always been famous. This year
we have surpassed all previous
efforts ana produced a bicycle as
near perfection as our skill
and the practically unlimited re-
sources of our great factories can
make it. The design is elegant
and graceful, and every detail
of workmanship and finish has been
brought to tempting ideality.
ONE GRADE ONLY
THAT THE HIGHEST.
We confine our efforts and the efforts
of every one of the 500 skilled
mechanics in our factories to the
perfecting of one model, one
only; and no maker who scatters his
energies ever half a dozen models
can hope to compete with us. For
years we have tested, improved and
perfected this one model of
Massey-Harris Bicycle
until, we believe, it is superior in
every way to any other bicycle that
has yet been buht.

supplies of good or bad blood to your brain.
Which is it ?
If bad, impure blood, then your brain aches.
You are troubled with drowsiness yet cannot

night; you have no nerve power; your food
does not seem to do you much good.
Stimulants, tonics, headache powders, can-
not cure you: but
AYER’S

will. It makes the liver, kidneys, skin and
bowels perform their proper work. It re-
moves all impurities from the blood. And it

“There is much incidental interest in
Theodore Watts-Dunton’s ‘ Aylwin,’” writes The
Bookfellow, “ but as a story it is formal and
tedious. Yet by dint of persistent puffing an
English sale of twelve thousand has been managed
in a few weeks ! As friend of Rossetti, Athenaeum
critic, poetical essayist and poet, Watts-Dunton
has attained enormous literary viana and it is
the mana, not the merit, which is selling
‘ Aylwin.’ ” One English reviewer, a friend of
Watts, is credited with having written five
enthusiastic rhapsodies for as many London
papers. It recalls the way in which _ Rossetti
(quite unnecessarily) tried to log-roll his poems.
By the way, one would like to know if that boom-
ing S. M. Herald notice—which sold out the
small local stock of “ Aylwin,” was sent out from
London.
“ Alba ” on a matter matrimonial: —
My friend Captain Ginx, late of Her Majesty’s
Dragoons, has married an Australian heiress. Previous
to the wedding, I mentioned casually to Ginx that the
heiress was the daughter of —ahem—an old lag. I dis-
tinctly remember that Ginx appeared greatly staggered.
“ Heaven alive, man 1 ” he said, “ why was this important
information withheld from me ? What crime was the
rascally old man convicted for?” I explained that the
bride’s pater had, in company with another man, “ laid ”
for an aggressive plumber known as “ The Bodger,” and
settled his hash in a wood near Stratford-on-Avon. After
which they boiled the dead “ Bodger” in a large iron pot
and left for London. Ginx received the news like a
soldier who has been bilked of £BOO-a-year. We did not
meet again for months, until one day, in the Gardens, I
saw him strutting arm-in-arm with the heiress. He
accosted me with great severity, and took me aside.
“ Sir,” he began, darkly, “ you once made a false and in-
famous statement regarding my wife’s father. Now
what do you think of yourself ?” I replied that “Bod-
ger ” had been cruelly wronged in an iron pot, and that
it was useless mincing matters. “ It’s an infamous lie ! ”
thundered the capting. “My father-in-law DID_ quarrel
with a plumber, I admit—a low, damned, insolent
plumber, sir. But my father-in-law, thank God, had the
sand of an Englishman—armed with a reaping-hook, he
pinked his plumber. Damme, sir, I’d do the same thing
myself 1 ” And . . . when I looked at the shape of his
wife’s forehead and jaw, I was convinced that she would
lend him her aid.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—l had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.” .
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-

undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by

W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
bear Sir,—For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis," and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O'REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which 1 suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

You will do well to warn people, especially engine-
drivers, from cominir here. All the railway construction
is in the air, and the 376 miles now open in the country
is not likely to be added to for at least a year. Every day

WE recommend these Bitters to be taken two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children. For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism, and (yutaneous
Affections. The action of Dandelion, more especially upon the liver and kidneys, is more reliable
for removing all impure secretions than any other medicinal plant known. Persons suffering
from Skin Diseases will find these Bitters invaluable. Directions for Use : One wineglass-
ful three times a day after meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For young people, about
half the quantity twice a day.

A- T- Wilson, 19 Bourke-streat, Melb.
Dan Young, the Chinaman whose murdered
body was found the other day, was one of the
identities of Stawell, Vic., and was notable for
the huge sign painted on the fence of his garden :
“ Europeans and others stealing things from this
garden will be prosecuted and shot.”
“ Old Jack ” returns to the charge :
“ J.A.W.” is disingenuous. I never called Mark Twain
a pigmy—save as compared with a giant. There are
degrees of proportion, and Twain looks small in the
shadow of the greater man. That is all 1 meant. I have
no objection, however, to “ J.A.W.” sticking his favorite
upon a pedestal of superiority if his judgment makes him
feel that way. And, if he please, he may level up the
conceit which most certainly sustains Mark Twain, to the
quality of self-appreciation which distinguished “ Glad-
stone, Disraeli, Bradlaugh, and all the great men of the
day ” —including, shall we say, George Reid and Oom
Paul ! I don’t think the less of Mark Twain because he
cannot read Thackeray. We do not blame a man because
he is deaf, or color-blind. But just as those who can hear,
and whose sight is perfect, cannot wholly understand the
disabilities of the less fortunate, so may we marvel
at Mark Twain’s imperfect capacity. But that is nothing.
Let each man cherish that which is best to him. But
when Mark Twain poses as an authority, a teacher, a
critic, and tells us that a work which has delighted thou-
sands of men and women, quite the equal of Mr. Clemens,
and quite as disembarrassed from vulgar convention, is
rubbish, we may well ask ourselves whether his judgment
is equal to his humor. He tells us that the “ Vicar of
Wakefield ” is—“ That strange menagerie of complaisant
hypocrites and idiots, of typical cheap-John heroes and
heroines who are always showing off, of bad people who
are not interesting, and good people who are fatiguing”—
and adds : “ There is not a sincere line in it, not a char-
acter that invites respect.” Goethe, however, writes
with a kind of ecstacy of his first acquaintance with
these “ complaisant hypocrites and cheap-John heroes
and heroines.” In his autobiography we find these
opinions : “ The delineation of this character (the
Vicar) in his course of life through joys and
sorrows, the ever-increasing interest of the story,
by the combination of the entirely natural with the
strange and the singular, make this novel one of the best
that have ever been written —the book is as wise as it is
amiable—and all this without a trace of pedantry or
cant.” Here we have the Pigmy and the Giant again
illustrated. It is for “J. A. W.” to make choice. As for
Mark Twain, we owe him gratitude. He has made us
laugh, and that is a great thing. But of genius, he has
no more—far less, indeed—than Steele Rudd ; less than
Max Adeler ; infinitely less than Artemus Ward. He had
the luck to strike an epoch, and he made the most of it.
But he has forgotten that which in youth he remembered,
to stick to his last, which is the funny business; not
necessarily humor, but good laughter-making chaff. Let
“ J.A.W.” project his imagination a century ahead, and
look on the book shelves for his favorite. He will find
Goldsmith there, and Sterne, and George Eliot, and
Thackeray, and Scott, and Froissart, and Cervantes, and
many other dull fellows that Mr. Samuel Clemens probably
despises. Nay, I shall chuckle, if lam around those
times, to find Fielding cherished then, despite the “dirty
and dull ” fiat of Stevenson, who will not be there. For
the rest—where is the point of “ J.A.W’s” quote from
Voltaire ? I might cap it from a better man : “ There is
often as much cant in a protest as in the cant against
which it is directed.”

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heelCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS'S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

IF YOU HAVE SUFFERED for 20 YEARS,
VITADATIO WILL CURE YOU,
VITADATIO WILL CURE YOU,
and don’t forget it (without operation), even when the eminent doctors of London, Meibom ne, or any other part

VITADATIO
Mr. F. W. HOHNE, who has been a clerk in the employ of Perry and Co., timber merchants, 150 Lonsdale-street,
for eight years, sends his photographs to show what “VITADATIO” has done for him. He says:—“For the last
five years I have been a great sufferer, and I did not know what it was to be at work for a month without having
to have two or three days’ leave of absence. I became so despondent at times that I began to think of ‘ suicide,’ as
life was only a burden tome. I consulted my lodge doctor (I am a prominent member in the Druids’Order), who
said that I had very bad bilious attacks. When I had the last attack of my trouble, a particular friend of mine (who
is a great believsr in VITADATIO) came to see me, and would not go away until I promised him to go in for a course
of VITADATIO. I did so. I purchased six bottles, and before I had finished the first bottle I got so bad that I con-
sulted a doctor. From what I told the doctor on that occasion, he said, ‘ Why, man, you are suffering from

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It’s beastly cold,” said Thorwaldsen, with a
general contraction of his immense limbs.
Jack Hamilton grunted. “You’ll have some
warm work presently if my ears are not mis-
taken, ” he said.
“I hear nothing,” said Thring, pressing his
cold cheek to his horse’s warm neck.
Jack let himself tenderly down on his stomach,
and put his ear to the ground. “ There’s a con-
siderable body of hoofs moving somewhere,” he
said, rising after some moments of dead silence.
“Shall we move too?” asked Thring.
“No. Our place is right here on the brow of
the hill; they’ll go either to left or right of us.
Possess your soul in patience, Danny. ”
Daniel Thring shrugged his shoulders and
leaned heavily against his horse.
“It’s ' a beastly night,” said Thorwaldsen,
earnestly.
The night certainly deserved the epithet—a
sour, cold night, shifting moonlight, and a rack of
grey clouds over the sky. The three men stood
by their horses in the scanty underbrush on the
upper slant of a rocky hill. The sloping gullies
on either hand were filled with weak and wavering
shadows. An occasional opossum showed itself
on the dead limb of a ring-barked gum, and the
monotonous chant of the morepork was the only
sound heard in conjunction with the wailing
sough of the wind as it sighed through the
hanging hair of the sheoaks.
* * * *
Jack Hamilton was partner with his father
in the run on which the three now stood, and
which the younger Hamilton managed. The
other two men were friends of his from adjoining
stations. Before them the ground ran rapidly
down into the land of a free selector —Bob Brown,
a man specially created to worry squatters.
Around Brown’s slab and bark humpy was a
ramshackle fence, and almost every week Jack
Hamilton received a message that some of the
station cattle had trespassed, and would he like to
pay damages at once instead of having the bother
of going to the pound? The game seemed a
profitable one for Bob Brown—“ too d —d profit-
able altogether,” Jack Hamilton meditated. And
the fruit of his meditations came in the presence
of himself and friends at 4 o’clock on a raw
morning at the top of the ridge overlooking
Browu’s. It was their third watch-night, and
Hamilton was savage.
• * * *
“Listen!” said Jack. A dull thud-thud
boomed in their rear, which presently grew
fainter, and died away in the distance.
“Good enough!” remarked Jack. “Some of
’em broken away. They daren’t use the whips. ”
“If anyone intends coming our way wish
they’d hurry up,” murmured Thorwaldsen into
the collar of his great coat.
“Here they come, by Jupiter!” exclaimed
Thring, straightening himself and gathering up
the reins.
“Don’t move till they’re well into the trap, or
we may fall in ourselves,” was Jack’s advice.
There came a sound of breaking underbrush and
rolling stones, and a small body of cattle streamed
down into the gully on their right—driven by two
men or boys.
The three men got into their saddles and
watched. One of the drovers waited on his horse
in the rear of the mob—a small one, chiefly com-
posed of station milkers, broken in by shepherds,
which accounted for their unusual docility—while
the other dismounted and took down some panels,
giving the animals free ingress to the selection,
which they took advantage of with a rush. The
last through, drover proceeded to doctor the
panels. Tne bottom one was left in its place, the
second sustained a fracture at his hands, and the
top one was thrown down at one end. Then he
gave a sigh of satisfaction,- followed by a scream
of nervous terror at finding his coat collar in the
grip of Jack Hamilton.
“ If you want to get warm, ” said Jack to Thring,
“catch the other little devil,” pointing to liis
victim’s companion, who had fled with a howl of
fright.
With a man’s instinctive love of hunting, Thring
was on the track, and going like a sleuth hound.
Thorwaldsen gave one glance at the vanishirig
forms, shrugged his shoulders, and turned to
Jack. "
Hamilton had whirled the lad round to face the
watery moon, and was eyeing him with grim and
savage satisfaction. “ The pitcher’s got broken at
last,” he said. “What have you to say for your-
self?”
The boy made no reply. He was very slight,
with delicate features, effeminate even, and the
terror in his soul made him white as a sheet. His
large blue eyes were turned in pitiable pleading
on Jack. Hamilton looked at him curiously.
“Don’t seem to know your face,” he remarked.
“Are you one of Brown’s brats?”
“He’s my—my uncle,” stammered the lad.
“ We —we only come here lately from the Flat
country to live.”
“ My word ! you’ve lost no time in getting into
the ways of the place. Well, I am going to teach
you that the sooner you get out of them the
better. ”
“ What are you going to do ?” the boy got out
through his chattering teeth, as Jack carefully
looped up his stockwhip.
“ Give you the biggest wolloping you ever had
in your life. But first —strip !
“You aint goin’to thrash me?” breathlessly.
An impatient repetition of the command was the
only answer.
The boy raised a passionate outcry. “It wasn’t
my fault—we was forced to do it —he made us,
Uncle Bob. I didn’t wanter. I tell you he made
us.”
“I daresay. I’ll deal with Mr. Robert Brown
later. Now I am going to give you a lesson. Off
with your coat and shirt. ”
The young manager’s tones were inexorable.
The wretched lad looked with fearful fascination
at the ugly stockwhip, then wildly round him for
help. His eye fell on Thorwaldsen, leaning
against a tree and watching him with something
of pity in his expression. “ Oh, don’t let him,
don’t let him ! Save me ! I couldn’t help it!” He
tore himself from Jack’s grasp and fell at the
other’s feet.
Thorwaldsen was easily moved, and he opened
his mouth to expostulate, but Jack interfered.
“ Dry up, Thor. You cowardly little hound ! I’d
thrash you now if it were only for your cowardice.”
He caught hold of the shabby jacket and
endeavored to remove it from the boy’s thin
shoulders.
“ Don’t! don’t! ” in the breathless way he had
displayed before. “Don’t! I’ll never do it no
more! ” His voice rose into a painful cry. as
Jack’s impatience increased. One more wild
glance round. “You can’t thrash me—you can’t
—you shan’t! ” Then, in the acme of his despera-
tion —“ I'm — l'm a girl! ”
Jack dropped him as if he stung. “What ? ”
Thring was coming back, whistling and trium-
phant, leading his quarry with his hands tied
together with the lash of his whip. “His old crock
fell so my capture didn’t take much trouble,” he
said.
His captive was a taller boy than the other,
with a bold, handsome face —eyes soft and
dark as a kangaroo’s—wild and fierce now as he
turned at bay. The pale-faced lad ran to him as
to a haven of refuge.
“ I’m a girl—a girl! Ain’t it true, Syd ? Ain’t
I a girl ? He said he’d thrash me, but he can’t
beat a girl like me. Said he’d make me strip and
lannn me with that there stockwhip of his ! You
tell him I’m a girl, Syd. Ain’t I your sister? ”
“True as gospel—straight wire,” answered Syd,
slowly. “It wasn’t his —her fault. Uncle Bob
ma le—her. I reckon you wouldn’t be such a
coward as to beat a girl! ” He looked at Hamilton
defiantly, with no sign of pleading apparent in
either look or voice. “She ain’t strong —coughs
awful sometimes —thin as a rake. You won’t beat
her.”
“ If he’s a girl what is she doing in this rig-
out ? ”
“ Uncle Bob made her. He said it was better
to ride in, and she wouldn’t get caught so easily
he reckoned. You won’t beat her.”
“No,” said Jack. “I won’t beat a girl. Get
home —look sharp !’ ’ His command was no sooner
spoken than complied with —the lad vanished like
frost before the sun.
A pair of dark, soft eyes strained after the
flying form, and a small heart began to beat
agonisingly.
“ Take off your coat! ” The order was unhesi-
tatingly obeyed, and the boy stood shivering in
his thin shirt sleeves.
“ And shirt! ” The boy folded his arms across
his chest and shook his head.
“Goon!”
“You’re cruel hard!” Syd gave an involun-
tary whimper. “It can’t make no difference in
the hurting, and—and—-I’m cold. ”
“You’ll be warm enough presently,” retorted
Hamilton. “Better do what I say,” he added,
approaching the boy, who stood near Thring.
For a second the lad did not move, then
suddenly, with a burst of passionate sobs, he
flung himself upon Jack, and thumped him with
all his might.
Never was anyone more surprised than Mr.
John Hamilton ; and he had meekly taken more
than one blow before he recovered sufficient
presence of mind to grasp his assailant and hold
him off at arm’s length.
Waiting for no more preliminaries, he brought
his doubled whip down again and again across
the boy’s shoulders. Throughout the ugly thrash-
ing that ensued Syd never stopped struggling and
fighting, but he kept his sobs down, and took it
with a heroism which excited Jack’s unwilling
admiration, and considerably shortened his
punishment.
“He is a plucky little beggar after all, sai I 1 ick,
as the three rode homeward. But he did n>t see
the bitter storm of tears that shook his vic'.iui as
he was out of sight.
* * * *
As he had promised, Jack proceeded later to
deal with Mr. Robert Brown, by liaving recourse
to the law. And though the free selector
demeaned himself so far as to solicit an interview
in order to try and effect a private reconciliati< n,
he was unsuccessful. The next day Jack whistled
when lie received a summons to answer to a
charge of having “assaulted and battered,” to
use Mr. Brown’s own phrase, that gentleman’s
niece, Sydney Brown.
“Niece!” Jack Hamilton went hot-foot to
discover the meaning of this expression. Standing
outside the selector’s door, he indignantly denied
having touched the selector’s niece. “As for
your nephew,” said he, “ I reckon he won’t forget
the hammering I gave him for many a long day. ”
“ You won’t,” retorted Robert Brown, and
stepping back over the threshold he called
“Sydney!” The rest of the family was already
standing open-mouthed around. At her uncle’s
call there came out from the kitchen a girl with
short black hair, and eyes soft and dark as those
of a kangaroo—bright now with a malignant light
as they fell on Jack. Considerably in her rear
dodged a slight, palefaced youth, whom the
manager rather thought he had seen before.
“It isn’t possible,” breathed Jack, a horrid
doubt distracting his mind.
“You fell in,” was Sydney’s triumphant
observation.
“Let the boy go and whacked the girl,”
chuckled their uncle. “ A nice story to come out
in court, Mr. Hamilton ! Jim, you see, is weakish
and molly-faced, and haint got as much grit as a
chicken —Syd’s got it all.”
“Oh Lord!” gasped Jack, as he realised the
scandalous possibilities of the situation.
* * * •
After a deal of bargaining Hamilton got the
amount down to £25. Bob Brown’s chivalrous
indignation on behalf of “ that poor gal ” wouldn’t
permit him to take a penny less.

SIX CUR€S FROM SIX COLONIES!
Hundreds of People in every Colony in Australia tell us they have been Cured by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
But we cannot print all these cures—so we have chosen six—one cure from each of the six colonies, and have had them printed below. Nearly all ailments, in the first instance, arise
from vitiated blood, which induces anaemia, general debility and their symptoms, lassitude, loss of appetite, indigestion, sleeplessness, backache, and a general depression of spirits—
as well as more serious diseases. If there is no case here similar to yours, write describing your ailment, and w r e will tell you, without charge, if we have heard of a case like yours
cured by our Pills. If we have not, we will say so. Address, Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place, Sydney, N.S.W. Mention The Bulletin when writing.
Acute Neuralgia Banished—Queensland.
Capt. Agnes H. Amos is chief of the Salvation Army in South-
port, a township 50 miles from Brisbane. Her good works are
many, and there is little doubt her over-exertions in the cause she
has at heart induced general ill health, which resulted in acute
neuralgia. She tried many remedies without avail, including hot-
water cloths wrapped round her face. Once, for eight long weeks
—56 days—she was rendered almost entirely sleepless by the acute-
ness of the shooting, burning pains in her face. A galvanic battery
did not cure her, but Hr. Williams’ Pink Pills did. Two boxes
quite relieved her—the relief commencing before she had finished
the first box. Ultimately the pains entirely ceased, she could sleep
well, exhausted nature was recuperated, and her general health
mended. She is now working actively for the salvation of souls,
and is enthusiastic in praise of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.

Locomotor Ataxia Cured—N,S.W.
Mr Charles Barrett, aged 30, living at 39 Hornsey-street,
Rozelle, Balmain, N.S.W., was a jockey. Whilst riding over the
hurdles at Hawkesbury River one morning, his horse failed to rise
and, crashing into the obstruction, fell upon Mr. Barrett, who was
extricated in an injured condition, and helped to the hotel.
Locomotor Ataxia set in two months afterwards, and when trying
to walk Mr. Barrett would stagger like a drunken man. He had
to give up his occupation, and was three months in the Balmain
Cottage Hospital. He came out a little better, but fell away again
and got thinner and thinner ; jagged pains shot through his calves,
and he would moan in agony. He tried nearly every medicine
advertised without success; but Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured
him. “I am quite well now. My cure was gradual, and I used
several boxes. My friends are simply astounded at my recovery.
They did not think I would live six months.”
4.
A Bad Leg Cured—Victoria.
(From the Stkiglitz Miner).
“I am 63,” said Mrs. Margaret Mulrooney, of Long Gully,
Steiglitz, Victoria, to a reporter from the Miner, “and have lived
hereabouts for 43 years. For 20 years I could not wear a boot
owing to a bad leg—a distressing ailment common to our sex. I
was in terrible agony, and my whole system was more or loss
affected. Death would indeed have been a happy release. At
times I could not even sit up, and I had to crawl about on my hands
and knees. Doctors and medicines did not cure me ; but Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills did. My daughter in Geelong sent me a box,
which T used with benefit. I took several boxes, and my leg
rapidly healed up. All pain disappeared, and I can wear my boots
with 1 asc. I can walk any distance now. All the neighbors are
astonished ! Moreover, my rheumatism has gone since using Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills.”

Fearful Debility Cured—South Australia
Mr. W. Gunn, Lairg Station, S.A., writes: —“For 25 years I
have lived in a dying state —miserable and debilitated through
dyspepsia, the result of a sluggish and disordered liver. Sciatica
also troubled me, and I have suffered from rheumatism for the last
12 years. Every summer made me worse, and last summer I was
in a fearful state of nervous prostration. The excessive heat,
dyspepsia and sleeplessness seemed to be making an end of me. At
last I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. The first box proved slightly
beneficial, and I continued till I had used nine boxes. lam now
in sound health, my digestion is perfect, food is appetising to me,
and I sleep well. I am 63. No medicine equals Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills.”
A Weak Heart Made Strong—West
Australia-
(From the Perth West Australian.)
Mr. Henry Ogborne, of the Mines Department, Perth, W.A.,
is 74 years of age. When the reporter of the West Australian
saw him, he fairly skipped up an almost perpendicular flight of
stairs, as he led the way to his apartments. “Only a few months
ago I could scarcely crawl up them ; now I don’t feel the exertion a
bit. Three years ago I began to suffer with a weak heart. Doctors
and medicines could not cure me. I became hopeless and broken
down in health. The doctors told me I could have no beer for
lunch, and must give up smoking. But Ido both, and am as well
now as I was 20 years ago, thanks to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I
used four boxes before being cured, but now I am in perfect health.
I did not feel any benefit at first, and I thought Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills were no good. But I persevered and followed the in-
structions, with the result that my heart is quite sound now. Pub-
lish this as much as you like—my case seemed so hopeless that I am
only too glad to try and induce others to use this.marvellous
medicine.”

Headaches and Anaemia Cured—Tasmania.
“ I am nineteen years of age,” says Miss M. A. Linger, “ and
have for some time resided at Chudleigh, Tasmania. When about
nine years of age I became anaemic. Nervous headaches and a pain
in the left side completely undermined my health. I was treated
by several doctors, who said I was going into a decline; but no
benefit ensued from their treatment. I also took a great amount of
other medicines, but with no beneficial results. In September,
1897, I read in one of the daily papers of a case which closely re-
sembled mine, and which had been cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills; so I procured some from Mr. Briscoe, storekeeper, Chud-
leigh. After I had been taking them for two weeks I felt greatly
improved; and when I had finished four boxes I was perfectly
cured, and have enjoyed the best of health ever since. I know of
several others who have benefited by the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and am quite confident that my recovery was effected solely
by their use. I cannot speak too highly of their wonderful merits.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wide sun stares without a cloud;
Whipped by his glances truculent
Ihe earth lies quivering and cowed!
My heart is hot with discontent—
I hate this haggard continent.
But over the loping leagues of sea
A lone land calls to her children free ;
My own land holding her arms to me
Over the loping leagues of sea.
The old grey city is dumb with heat;
No breeze come 3 leaping, naked, ride,
Adown the na row, h gh- walled street;
Upon the night thick pert ones brood ;
The evening oozes lass tude.
But o’er the edges of my town,
Swept in a tide that ne’er abates,
The riotous breezes tumble down ;
My heart looks home, looks home, where
vi aits
The Windy City of the Straits !
The land lies desolate and stripped ;
Across its waste has thinly strayed
A tattered host of eucalypt,
From whose gaunt uniform is made
A ragged penury of shade.
But o’er my isles the forests drew
A mantle thick -save where a peak
Shows his grim teeth a-snarl—and through
The filtered coolness creek to creek,
Tangled in ferns, in whispers speak.
A nd there the placid great lakes are v
And brimming rivers proudly force
Their ice-cold tides. Here, like a scar,
Dry-lipped, a withered watercourse
Crawls from a long-forgotten source.
My glance, home gazing, scarce discerns
This listless girl, in whose dark hair
A starry-red hibiscus burns ;
Her pallid cheeks a e like a pair
Of nun’s —they are so fragile fair
And like a sin her warm lips flame
In her wan face ; swift passions brim
In her brown eyes, and ebb with shame ;
Her foiin is sinuous and slim —
That lyric line of breast and limb !
But one there waits whose brown face glows,
Whose cheeks with winter’s kisses smart —
The flushing peals of a rose !
Of earth and sun she is a part;
Her brow is Greek and Greek her heart.
At love she laughs a faint disdain :
Her heart no weakly one to charm ;
Robust and fragrant as the rain.
The dark bush soothed her with hi 3 balm,
The mountains gave her of their calm.
Her fresh young figure, lithe and tall,
Her twilight eyes, her brow benign,
She is the pcerles-i queen of all
The maid, the country, that I shrine
In this far banished heart of mine !
Over the loping h agues of sea
A lone land calls to her children free —
My own land holding her arms to me
Over the loping leagues of sea.

ARHUR H. ADAMS.
A Dead Finish Courtship.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You’d better go now, Andy,” said the Woman,
Jack will be up from the claim soon.”
“ Well, what of that ? ” asked Andy Gaylin.
“He might be jealous,” she replied. “He’s
found you here so often lately.”
This was a piece of feminine vanity on the
Woman’s part. But Andy saw a point in it and
made use thereof.
“Jealous! Not he,” he said. “He takes no
notice of you lately. He’s tired of you. So why
shouldn’t you leave him and come with me.
Promise me, Sal.”
But the Woman still hesitated.
“Come up to-morrow,” she said, “and go
now.”
And he went. But the Man, coming through
the scrub at the other side of the little clearing,
saw him go.
The Man went into the camp, and the Woman
greeted him—indifferently.
“I think,” he said, “ we’ll be all right now.
We’ve got a pile claim at last, by the look of
things.” But she was still indifferent.
He went out again, walked about a little, and
hesitated. Then he followed the track through
the scrub to Andy’s camp. For the Man had
seen more than either of those other two thought.
“ How are things?” he asked.
“ Well, I’m thinking of shifting,” said Andy.
“ My claim’s about duffered.”
The Man looked at him.
“Is Sal going with you?” he asked. Then—
not being used to putting his feelings into speech
—he blurted out: “ Andy, old mate, you and me
have been friends a long time, and I don’t blame
you—or her. But I think she likes you best. Go
and ask her ; and if she wants to go take her with
you. Tell her I said so. But be quick about it,
and don’t let me see you going. I might change
my mind.”
* * • *
“Will you come, Sal?” Andy had told the
Woman what the Man had said.
“ Did Jack say you were to tell me I could go ? ”
she asked. And wondered why he wished to get
rid of her.
“ Yes. Take him at his word and come.”
Th- Woman thought a moment.
“ No, ’ she said, “ I think I’ll stay. It wouldn’t
be fair to go and leave him.”
Andy Gaylin went away the second time. He
met the Man in the scrub.
“ She won’t come,” he said. “We both made a
mistake. She doesn’t want to leave you.” He
held out his hand. “ I’ll be leaving the Dead
Finish for the new rush to-night.”
“ Well, good-bye, old chap, and good luck,” said
the Man, as he shook his hand heartily.
Then the Man went back to his own camp and
sat down to supper. He and the Woman talked
about the claim, and other things, but said nothing
about Andy.
But afterwards she came to him with a caress.
“ Jack,” she said, “did you think you could give
me away like that ? I wouldn’t leave you for any-
one else.”
And the Man believed her.
PROSPECT GOOD.
The Street Accident.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was crossing the street at the time, and saw it
all distinctly.
There are two trams travelling in opposite
directions. The poor devil passes one, whistling
cheerfully, and is caught by the other.
A simultaneous cry from a score of throats, and
an instantaneous rush, and there is a surging
crowd about the tram before it has been quite
brought to a standstill. A confusion like Babel
ensues—-a confusion of voices and of minds. Does
any man quite preserve his intellectual identity in
a crowd like this ?
“Who is he? Who is he?” People bandy the
question stupidly, and the injured man is lying on
his back half under the tram, looking composedly
up at the stars.
They lift the tram, and he is dragged forth.
Who can he be ? I have a vague idea that I know
him. But his name, his name —whatever is it
they used to call him ?
The police have come, and a man in a belltopper
says it is serious. They bundle him into a cab,
and he gazes incuriously at the policeman as he is
driven away, rocking foolishly in the. cramped
vehicle.
“ What is your name ? ”
He does not know. This is most peculiar.
What is his name ? I have it on the tipj of my
tongue. Tom —is it Tom ? No. Curse it! this
is irritating, but after all what does it matter!
Still, he might have been a friend of mine.
At the hospital the bare-armed doctor comes
fingering broken bones unconcernedly, and drop-
ping technical phrases.
“ Do you know him ? ” he asks, screwing at an
instrument.
Of course, of course—it comes in a flash. “ Good
God ! ” I said —“it is / / ”
E.D.
At Broken Hill temperance-sermons were
announced for Sunday, Feb. 12. And the ther-
mometer promptly registered 116. No conversions
recorded.
“ A.E.G.” : Once was at a wayback wake.
Corpse (old man’s) laid out on sideboard in dining-
room. Table loaded with sucking-pigs, turkeys,
tarts, rum, and plug-tobacco. All soon put out of
sight by over a score of as uncouth men and
women as I’ve ever got amongst. Corpse’s eyes
were wide-open (somebody had sneaked the half-
crowns), and every time I looked at it I fancied it
was winking at me. A wreath of pumpkin-vine,
interspersed with wadding, adorned his breast,
and whilst the feed was progressing, the wreath
and a plate of salt fell upon the floor, whereupon
a rabbi ter, with tart in one hand and turkey in
the other, jumped up and exclaimed, “ Hogan’s
ghost ! is it going to be a resurrection ? ” Then a
relative got on to him for “ insulting the corpse,”
and the rest was chaos and skin and hair. I got
a chair over my head and made for the door. The
corpse got lost in the confusion, and wasn’t buried
for three days afterwards.
A Big Scrub Acrobat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Pewter Smallglass, publican, of Lodgetown, on
the Richmond River, wired to his agent in Sydney
to send him a boy as boots, etc. The agent adver-
tised, but no boys turned up (all the boys in Sydney
are men). A long, gaunt six-footer man asked for
the billet; said he knew he wasn’t a boy ; but he
was hard-up, and—anything for a living. So the
agent sent him up. When Smallglass saw this
“ generally useful,” he was a bit staggered; but
the man explained his reasons for accepting a boy’s
place.
“ What’ll I have to do, bozz ? ” he asked.
“ Well,” replied the boss, “ y’ve gotta fetch th’
cows ev’ry mornin’; nine of ’em. Yu’ll mostly
find ’em on th’ flat, which iz only two miles off.
Feed ’em; milk ’em, an’ turn ’em mout. Mind
ye have all th’ boarders’ boots done at sevun sharp.
Acourse yu’ve gotta keep th’ kitchen well s’plied
with small - cut wood. Opun th’ hotel in th’
mornin’; sweep pit tout; clean any ov th’ kim-
mercials’ buggies; help cook a bit with th’
scullery work, look kafter th’ vegerble gardin —
tain’t very large, about 21, acres ; feed th’ pigs, an’
help in th’ bar.”
“ Is that all ? ” asked the applicant.
“ Lemme see. Oh !by Jove, can ya mark kat
billyuds ? ”
“ Cert’nly ; I’m a bit ov a player.”
“ That’s good diron. Yu’ll mark in th’ saloon
till closin’ time; brush th’ billyud-table caref’lly,
trim th’ lamps ev’ry mornin’.”
“Is there anything else ? ”
“ Wait till I think. Oh !ya must talways be
about ta hold horses, &c., for any ov th’ gents,
an’ ta run littul messages for them.”
“ Anything more?”
“ Hum —oh ! by the way ; yu’ll lav ta go fa th’
mail ev’ry day; take tellagrams an’ that sorta
thing, an dif enny ov th’ kimmercial gents wants
rousin’ nup at 4or 5 a’clock in th’ mornin ’s, ya be
on ’and ta help’em with their luggige.”
“Is that all ? ” asked the man from Sydney,
quite stoically.
“No ; there’s often parcels ta take down ta th’
wharf ; an’ packiges an’ cases.ta wheel lup ta th’
storeroom when the Tomki or any ov th’ ocean
boats cum min.”
“What else?”
“ Well, that’s al I c’n think hof at present; but,
in a few days, I’ll put ya up ta littal things I
want ya to do.”
The gaunt sixfooter straightened himself.
“ Look here, bozz,” he said, “ you don’t want no
boy.”
“ No ! what do I want then ? ”
“ You want a bloomin’ acrobat —that’s what you
want ! ”

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
'm.
!
“My son, -whose picture I send you, -was taken very sick, became languid,
losing his appetite and seeming to lose all energy. Apparently he did not have
hardly any life left in him. He was so weak he would become unconscious
at times. He also had large swellings in his neck. I was greatly worried
over him. I took him to the doctors with no satisfactory results.
“ I then resorted to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, remembering that my sister derived
a wonderful amount of good from this same medicine.
“ After a few days my boy’s health began to improve, his appetite returned,
and he gradually lost his extreme languidness. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla acted as a
grand tonic upon his whole system, and he soon began to scamper about like
other boys. I attribute his wonderful recovery solely to the fact that he took
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and took it in time.”
This is the experience of Mrs. Arabella Graham (whose son’s portrait is given
above), of 73 Station St., Petersham, New South Wales. It is also the happy
experience of thousands of mothers all over the land. And it is the reason
-why Ayer’s Sarsaparilla has been named
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
It brings color to white lips and plumpness to pale cheeks.

Dear Sirs,—Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phtlusis and bronchitis, T de-
sire to add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating
cough, with much expectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything
I have tried. It loosens the mucus, which, therefore, comes more readily away and
the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
I remain, Yours respectfully,
