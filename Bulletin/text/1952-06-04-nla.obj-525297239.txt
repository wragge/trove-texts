BECOMES LACEWORK IN
HENRY VII’S CHAPEL
/"VNE of the chief glories of Westminster
Abbey is the Chapel of Henry VII.
It was built in 1502-1512 and is the finest
example in Britain of the late-Perpendicu-
lar style of architecture. The superb fan-
vaulting of its stone roof has been
described as a miracle of craftsmanship,
for although it weighs many tons it
appears to hang like a delicate lace
canopy. Divided into bays filled with
round fans, hanging lanterns and many
thousands of traceried compartments the
roof is a triumph of stone-cutting un-
rivalled for the perfection of its
sculptured detail.
No less magnificent are the walls, en-
crusted with tracery and decorated with
a gallery of elaborate statues of martyrs,
saints, philosophers and kings. Along
each side of the nave are the carved stalls
of the Knights of the Bath, each of which
has its crest and red and gold sword on
the front. Hanging above them and
bringing to the Chapel a blaze of colour
in red, blue and gold are the forty-six
silk banners of the Knights of the Bath
whose ancient order was reconstituted in
1725 by George I.
In the centre of this magnificent Chapel
is the elaborate tomb of the founder,
Henry VIT. who died in 1509. The
beautiful craftsmanship of this tomb was
the work of Pietro Torrigiano, and is
itself regarded as one of the wonders of
the Abbey ; it took six years to complete.
Among the many royalties buried in the
Chapel are Queen Elizabeth (d. 1603) and
her victim, Mary Queen of Scots, who
was beheaded in 1587. There, also, are the
tombs of Charles 11, of Queen Anne and
her seventeen children. The last king to
be buried in the Chapel was George II
in 1760.
Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) was
buried with all the pomp and ceremony
of a king in the Chapel of Henry VII,
but after the Restoration his body was
removed and hung from the gallows at
Tyburn. His head, which is still in exist-
ence, was stuck on a pike on Westminster
Hall for twenty-five years.

The Red Page
A FRENCH MASTERPIECE.
Alan Hodge says in his introduction
to Daudet’s Sappho, lately added to
Hamish Hamilton’s admirable Novel
Library, that he hopes this new printing
will restore Dauoet’s reputation as a
novelist “to the heights on which Charles
Dickens, Henry James and George
Meredith used to set it” ; and so indeed
it should, for though much of Daudet
is too thin to be worth rediscovering
today, Sappho is one of those rare
novels, like Stendhal’s Le Rouge et
Le Noir or Turgenev’s Smoke, that
crystallise in the mind as you read them
with the clarity, the firmness and the
radiance of an unquestionable master-
piece.
Curiously, when one can give it this
high praise, and when it deals with a
cocotte who from the multiplicity of her
love-affairs should be one of the most
memorable women in all literature,
Sappho is not really strong as a novel
of character. It has that commonest of
all faults in fiction: a weakness, a blurring
of the central characters.
There is one glorious minor character,
the old rip Uncle Cesaire who has been
a merry fellow in Paris in his youth and,
through all the years when he is laying
waste the family fortunes in the vine-
yards, can never forget his days of
beautiful wickedness. There are also
many brilliant sketches of bohemian
people in Paris: writers, painters and
sculptors, all with their mistresses. There
are the aged courtesans, neglected or
with their grotesque old lovers. But the
focus, the emphasis, the real interest of
the novel is not directed to the minor
characters, as it is, for instance, in most
of Scott’s romances, but always to Sappho
and her lover ; and so the central blur-
ring is here of some consequence.
The trouble seems to be that Daudet
began this impassioned drama (of a
middle-aged courtesan’s desperate search
for security) with slightly moral inten-
tions It is dedicated “For my sons when
they are twenty” ; and the original moral
purpose was to warn these young men
of the appalling possibility of their being
trapped by a cocotte as lovely as Sappho.
Long ago she had been the model as
well as the mistress of a sculptor (remark-
ably like Rodin) who portrayed her in
bronze as Sappho of Greece; now,
approaching her forties, she seizes upon
the innocent and handsome young
Gaussin when he comes up from the vine-
yard to study for the consular service
in Paris; and Daudet’s sons are warned
by implication that such a woman never
lets go. They will become as ridiculous,
as tragic, as utterly corrupt and destroyed
as De Potter, still enslaved in his old
age by the horrifying charms of his
ancient mistress Rosario, who does
nothing but curse and humiliate him. Or
they may suffer the fate of Dechelette,
who, when his mistress dramatically
jumps out a window to her death because
he proposes to send her back to her
career in the cheap cafes and on the
streets, somewhat improbably jumps out
the same window to his own death.
To fulfil this moral purpose, Daudet
rather overdoes Gaussin’s innocence.
From the very first moment when he is
carrying Sappho upstairs to his attic and
stumbles under her weight, the enchantress
is a burden to him; always he is the
reluctant lover, the victim. It is not quite
convincing; for Sappho is famous and
still beautiful. She can introduce him to
the most glittering society in Paris, great
artists and poets whom he has wor-
shipped from afar; and she is supposed
to be singularly expert in all the arts of
love. A youth from the provinces like
Gaussin would probably go mad about
her. His reluctance throws the whole
novel a little out of focus; for one can
never see quite why Sappho should fall
so passionately in love with so dull and
unresponsive a young man, nor why she
should cling so desperately to him for
security when he is not even wealthy;
and so Sappho herself becomes not quite
real. Dooming the young man to “a fate
worse than death,” Daudet is trying to
work up a tragedy out of a situation
essentially comic.
This faint impression of unreality is
probably the reason why the novel,
beautiful though it is, will always seem
slighter than Smoke and Le Rouge et Le
Noir. both of which, in all respects
except complete firmness of characterisa-
tion, it very much resembles. It is very
likely the reason why Sappho, though
it is very much the finer book, altogether
more subtle and lyrical, has never won
the fame of the comparatively squalid
and second-rate Madame Bovary, in which
the doom of Emma, though mechanically
and moral istically contrived, is at least
genuinely tragic.
But the weakness does not ultimately
matter very much. There remains a
basic human truth in the negative if not
the positive aspects of Gaussin’s char-
acter: in his disillusion when he comes
to Paris; in the torments of jealousy he
undergoes ; in the disgust and boredom
he feels when the love-affair grows cold ;
in the delight with which he escapes to
the freshness of morning in the vineyards
from the magnificent squalor of life with
Sappho; in the angry surrender to his
passion with which he renews their
relationship when, in the marvellous
suspense of the closing chapters, his
mistress catches him alone in the country
after they have parted “for ever.” The
further the book progresses, escaping
from the moralistic cloud of the opening,
the more human Gaussin becomes.
And it is only because Gaussin, as
he is originally presented, is not wholly
convincing that Sappho seems slightly
out of focus, out of her element, a fish
out of water. In herself she is a very
fine fish indeed, superbly exhibited.
Moralist though he may be, Daudet never
rages at Sappho as Thackeray rages at
Becky Sharp; but he has, on the con-
trary, that final love of femininity, free
from all prudery and reflected in a grace
of style and portraiture, which always
makes one think that only Continentals
—only Frenchmen one might say, were it
not for Turgenev—should be allowed to
write about women.
The moral purpose never obscures or
distorts the absolute detachment with
which he displays the manoeuvres of
Sappho against her victim: her coarse
and furious rejection of the lover whom
Gaussin is to replace ; the alternate wiles
of passion or quiet domesticity by which
she seeks to hold the young clerk; the
duplicity with which she submits when
he tries to escape from her and go home
to the vineyards, while all the time she
plots to get him back ; the ease and relief
she feels when she herself can slip away
to people of her own kind, the courtesans
who have been her friends; the despera-
tion and abandon with which she fights
towards the end when Gaussin is really
leaving her at last to pursue his career
in the colonies; the cynical realism of
her final surrender, when she lets him
go and comforts herself in the arms of a
former lover who has just come out of
jail; the total impression of passionate
charm mixed with fierce earthiness which
in different circumstances, displayed
against a more vital opponent such as the
scapegrace monarch of Illyria in another
fine Daudet novel. Kings in Exile, could
make her as memorable a character as
Shakspeare’s Cleopatra.
In the frame of this central story,
real and unreal as it is, the ultimate
strength of the novel lies in three great
scenes which nobody could ever forget.
Nothing quite like them has ever been
done; for the very good reason that
seldom if ever in literature do you meet
a woman, seriously if ironically
portrayed, who has had so many lovers
as Sappho. The “triangle” which gives
us so many situations of drama and
jealousy in literature is here multilateral;
everything is magnified to the grand
scale, yet still kept remorselessly
veracious.
The first of these scenes is tragic:
when Gaussin, who has known that
Sappho has had a “past” but had never
allowed himself to discover how multi-
farious it was, opens a box of Sappho’s
letters and, while his mistress watches
him, cannot resist reading them; reading
on and on in shame and rage and misery
as lover after lover, skeleton after
skeleton out of the courtesan’s career,
comes up out of the letters and makes
a mockery and a degradation of his whole
existence.
The next scene is macabre; when
Gaussin and Sappho stay a weekend in
the country with the old hag Rosario and
her decrepit lover, in the company of
other famous courtesans now aged and
corrupt and hideous, all the worse for
the paint and powder and the false gaiety
with which they still try to defy the
onslaught of time and decay. They go
boating on a lake, drunk after lunch in
the rose-garden, in what seems like a
resplendent and ferocious parody of some
of the amorous picnics of Maupassant:
In this setting, like a picture by Lancret,
where the dainty whiteness of the villas
sparkled oat among the fresh greenery, and
terraces and lawns framed the little lake
ail flaked with sunlight, what an embarka-
tion it was —what an aged and limping
Cythera it was, the blind Sombreuse, and
the old clown, and Desfous the paralytic,
leaving in their wake, as they floated over
the water, the musk-like perfume of their
powder and their rouge Suddenly Rosa
could no longer endure the marriage of
these two voices and interrupted the canti-
lena with an infuriated outburst: “Hi, you
with your concert! Haven’t you had
enough of warbling away at each other?
Anyway it’s late, it’s time for Fanny to
go back to the dump.” And with an
enraged wave of her arm towards the
nearest landing-stage, she said to her lover:
“Put ashore there. It’ll be neaser the
station for them.”
The third of these great scenes, not
as vehement as the first, not as bizarre
as the second in its extraordinary blend-
ing of beauty and corruption, pathos
and savagery, is not less striking in its
quiet irony. It is when Gaussin meets
some half-dozen of Sappho’s previous
lovers at a party and finds that he really
doesn’t feel jealous of them at all; after
all they are famous men —the poets and
the artists —-and they are very pleasant
fellows. They haven’t quite forgotten
that once, long ago, they had known
Gaussin’s mistress fairly well; and it is
pleasing to have an interest in common.
Daudet sub-titled Sappho “A Picture
of Life in Paris” and so it is, brilliant,
hard and graceful. But it is a picture of
city life painted with an underlying rustic
warmth in a way that is peculiar to the
French.
City and country are not separated,
utterly cut off from one another as they
tend to be in Dickens ; they meet and
mingle, as they do in Maupassant’s short
stories. Every time that delightful old
rake Uncle Cesaire comes to town he
brings a breath of the vineyards with
him; when Gaussin runs away from
Sappho to his old home he goes into the
loveliest of rural tranquillity; he and
Sappho even live for a while in the
country, along with their estimable fat
friend Hettema who is living in perfect
domestic bliss with his equally large wife
whom he happened to meet in a brothel;
and if it is a macabre picnic which old
Rosario and the others enjoy on the
lake, it is still a picnic: the warmth, the
fragrance, and the loveliness of the
countryside pervade the whole novel, so
that the total effect is neither sordid as
another writer might have made it, nor
moralistic as Daudet (repenting of a
similar affair in his own youth) half-
meant it to be, but lyrical. The trans-
lation by Eithne Wilkins admirably
reflects the grace of the French.
D. S.
PAINTINGS.
Climate of stillness: though 1 hear
No sound that falls on mortal ear
Yet in the intricate, devised
Hearing of sight these waves that
break
In thunder on a barren shore
Will foam and crash for evermore.
This grey and silver Hogarth made
To paint the children as they played
Is silver sound of bells and cries.
I hear them call; they stretch their
hands
To reach the cherries overhead—
The children who are long since dead.
And you, grave Florentine, who turn
And look at me with eyes that burn,
I hear you asking—" What is Time
Since Art has conquered it? I speak
Five hundred years ago. You hear.
My words beat still upon your ear.”

ROSEMARY DOBSON.
Beverley Nichols Again.
The annoying thing about Beverley
Nichols’s deliberately-provocative man-
nerisms is that underneath the tutti-frutti
conversation he has generally got some-
thing ; in Merry Hall (Cape), where he
describes his wooing of the garden of
his Georgian house, he adds a real know-
ledge of flowers to his exceedingly flowery
feelings.
His enthusiasm is supplemented by his
old gift of brilliant reportage, in accounts
of his battles with the mansion’s
immemorial gardener, and especially of
his feud with a professional floral-
decorator, “Our Rose” —in these encoun-
ters of old-maidish strategy and the
tactics of the tart retort and the scathing
innuendo, he is in his element.
As with his earlier works, one is left
wondering how he manages to get away
with such portraits; “Our Rose” may be
merely a creation, the circumstantial
account of their bitter disagreement oyer
decorating the church for the harvest
festival may well have been imagined;
yet an important part of this account is
that the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret
Rose were to sit in pews uncomfortably
and badly decorated, according to Mr.
Nichols, by his hated enemy:—•
Our Rose had transformed the front pew
into something which looked like a cross
between Cinderella’s coach and a prize-
winning stall at the Horticultural Exhibi-
tion ....
However, now one looks at the pas-
sage again, one finds that Mr. Nichols
has got his effect very simply—the Prin-
cesses were staying the weekend three
miles away ; then, the decorations having
been completed: “The Princesses,
through no fault of their own, were
unable to come,” and in the upshot Miss
Rose had to sit in the pew she had
decorated herself; and her friend Miss
Emily had to take the pew she had deco-
rated with vegetables for the ladies-in-
waiting, sat on a tomato and, rising from
prayer, “gave a superb exhibition of lady-
like composure.”
There may be more truth in his few
pages on Melba singing in an Australian
garden, and perhaps a little in the story
of his decision to revive in real flowers
a painting of flowers by an early-nine-
teenth-century Austrian, Joseph Nigg. To
complete the total of flowers in the
painting he needed a dark-purple iris, a
root of which he found in Nazareth; a
white tulip with pink stripes, which he
found in the Swat valley on the North-
west Frontier of India in 1943 when, an
ill war-correspondent, “flies buzzing
round a wound in my foot,” he was being
carried by stretcher to military hospital
at Peshawar; and a convolvulus with a
white centre and a blue edge which he
found in Maxine Elliot’s old Mediter-
ranean villa, then in the hands of Prince
Ali and Rita Hayworth—from them he
stole the convolvulus-seed, as some time
before he had pocketed the stone of a
rare fruit at a public dinner. So, after
three years, he was able to compose his
flower-picture entire., There is something
typical about the whole transaction; a
flower of the moment is Mr. Nichols, but
a very bright one.

DESTROYER
OPERATION
by MACNELL
THE surgeon - lieutenant
swayed on his bunk, eyes
closed, thinking. He was
thinking as hard as he’d
ever thought in his life. Every-
thing he had learned of
psychology, auto - suggestion,
mental control —which, as he
had left university a short two
years before, was not overmuch
—was put into his effort. And
still the tightness around his
forehead, the dreadful vertigo
creeping from his stomach to his
head, breaking out in cold sweat
round the edges of his hair, per-
sisted. Then came the uncon-
trollable yawns —an infallible
sign.
The destroyer lifted —hung
her slender stem a moment over
a green, white-flecked chasm,
then dropped in a slicing bite
that buried her flares, flung a
geyser of spray back over her
fo’c’sle and shook the surgeon-
lieutenant, sprawling, on to his
pillow. He lay a moment, his
weight on his stomach. As the
ship lifted again, leaving his
stomach a thousand shivering
miles below him, he forgot
everything he knew of mind-
control, scrambled to the scuttle,
found it tightly clamped with
the dead-light, and half-fell from
the bunk to the tiny wash-
basin.
He felt better. He must have.
Whereas a minute before he
would scarcely have noticed his
curtain parting, now he glared
up at the sub-lieutenant with
murderous hate. The sub.,
twenty-two years old, five years
at sea, was grinning delightedly
athwart his face—and, with an
inconceivable immunity which
made the surgbon shudder, he
was smoking.
“Never mind. Doc. —dinner in
ten minutes. Fill her up again—
lovely greasy pork.”
The surgeon breathed deeply,
looking up from the basin.
Funnily enough, now that his
secret shame was out, he felt
much easier You talked about
your ulcer, or gall-trouble, or
thick head from a run ashore,
with uninhibited frankness. Sea-
sickness you hid as though you
were scourged with the most
unmentionable disease. That,
probably, was why you
succumbed —repression focused
attention on your stomach.
He grinned, albeit weakly, and
stood up, instantly grabbing at
his bolted-down desk, staggering
on the lifting deck like a drunk.
“You filthy young hound. I’ve
no doubt you’ll guzzle my share.
You’re welcome to it —gangway.
I’m off up-top.”
The sub. swayed easily back,
and leaned forward again in time
with the curtain.
“You won’t stay long, Doc.
Bit damp up there. Though
she’s not too bad abaft ‘X’ gun.”
“Don’t blow that blasted
smoke in my face. Look out —
or you’ll be damp!”
r H RINNING, the sub. took
one look at the surgeon’s
contorted face and hastily
cleared the line of fire. Reeling
along the white-painted alley-
way, the surgeon made for the
upper-deck ladder —anything to
get clear of the stuffy, enclosing
bulkheads of ’tween-decks. He
passed a steward, but his mind
was too filled with one urgent
idea to worry now about appear-
ances. He slithered across the
shiny steel deck, leaned over the
lee guard-rails—more by luck
than experience—and communed
with the green seas whipping
past in quick retreat beneath him.
In the lee of the after-
superstructure, “X” gun’s ugly
snout projecting above his head,
he felt better. The salt-keen
wind whipped across his face,
tingling. He gazed astern, back
over the tumbling seas, where
for half-a-mile the destroyer’s
wake laid a comparatively
smooth carpet, till the wind won
again, and the cold green-white
sea effaced all signs of the ship’s
passing in a restless wilderness
of waves reaching far astern to
the fanged horizon.
The surgeon, an honest young
man, smiled ruefully to himself.
He remembered the first thrill
of his blue-and-gold uniform,
and the regret he had felt at not
being able to wear it ashore in
these days of “peace.” He didn’t
rate much of a figure now,
surgeon-lieutenant of a Fleet
destroyer, north - bound (to
what?), with chattering teeth and
a quaking stomach. Thank God,
he felt paradoxically, they still
had two weeks at sea ahead of
them —a fine figure he’d cut now
in the tiny sickbay filled with
action casualties.
The thought shivered him.
Too young for War 11, he had
never seen a battle casualty. But
he had heard enough of what
blasting explosives could do to
human flesh—particularly, in a
ship, searing steel splinters. At
that moment he heard something
else ajjove the whine of the wind
—the voice of his sickbay
attendant on “X” gun above him.
“Blast this bloody ship—stand
still, you mule! Here, you
blokes —seen the quack?”
A muffled voice answered,
sarcastic even through a woollen
muffler.
“Bung up and bilge free, most
likely. Last time I saw him he
was green—and I mean green.
Both ways. Oughter be back at
school. Fat lot of use he’ll be
where we’re headin’. Couldn’t
cut a toenail”
A voice sharp with authority
cut across the speaker’s.
“Pipe down, McConnell.
There’s a couple of quacks on
this gun—and you’re one of ’em.
Robson —I hear you call the
doctor quack again and you see
the bloke. On your way!”
A feeling of the most intense
gratitude for the captain of the
gun filled the listening surgeon
—intensified by the flush of
shame McConnell’s sneer had
sent surging to his face. The
A.B. was right; he couldn’t cut
a toenail —now. And if he had
a spark of moral guts he’d
exercise the authority of his two
new rings, run up the ladder and
himself order McConnell on to
the bridge. And charge him
with his own charge—that the
ship’s surgeon was green with
seasickness, incapable of carrying
out his job, had no place in a
fully - commissioned warship
heading for possible action?
The surgeon slipped round the
far side of the superstructure and
handled himself down the ladder
to the wardroom.
BY the time Robson got back
to the wardroom, after
trying everywhere else a
ship’s surgeon might be, the
object of his search was raging
mostly against himself. •

"TAKEN FOR A RIDE"?
r
Opposition like Mr. Haylen and Mr.
Ward. Yet there is no action calcu-
lated to satisfy public opinion. The
Government is “inquiring.”
The Administration’s measures are no
more definite in the case of Mr. Ward,
who has been shouting it about the
country that he has had access to the
contents of a confidential departmental
letter. The most concrete step taken
against Mr. Ward was to gag him in
debate.
What can be the effect of these
proceedings among the countries with
which we must negotiate our defence
and the economic arrangements on
which our continued existence depends?
How does the United States feel
about negotiating with a country
which cannot keep secret treaties, in
process of being drafted, out of the hands
of the Communist party? How does it
feel about a country in which the Opposi-
tion —the possible Government of 1953
or 1954 if public morale cracks under a
bit of overdue economic and industrial
discipline condones this sneaking
betrayal by a civil servant? How do the
Dutch, betrayed and spat upon by the
Communists in Australia in 1945 during
the Indonesian troubles, feel when they
find employed in the Australian Legation
at The Hague a man who as lately as 1944
moved at a N. S. Wales A.L.P. annual
conference that the Communist party be
allowed to affiliate with the A.L.P., a
motion which was seconded by one of
the present “Labor” members in the
N. S. Wales Legislative Council?
How, indeed, can anybody entrust us
with defence secrets or have confidential
negotiations with us with any feeling of
security when it knows that during the
Chifley-Evatt regime departments, par-
ticularly those controlled by Dr. Evatt
and Messrs. Ward and Dedman, became
the resort of political spies, and, even
worse, of what Mr. Casey calls “small
nests of traitors”?
The Government’s reaction to this con-
dition of affairs is altogether feeble and
ineffective. A minute and thoroughgoing
examination of the whole extent of the
penetration of the civil service by enemy
agents and political doctrinaires, with
searching inquiry as to who is
responsible for it, is called for.
The matter is vital to the country’s
honor and safety, and it should
be instituted under such control as to
inspire full confidence, and be conducted
under such legislation as would make it
possible for nobody, however tall a
poppy, to avoid giving evidence or from
being dealt with if he is actually involved
in any crime or impropriety.
If some of the evidence which has been
available is properly examined by a com-
mission, or Parliamentary committee
armed with adequate powers, it seems that
even the N. S. Wales liquor inquiry might
come to be regarded as a dull affair by
comparison.
It would also earn more respect for the
Government than its present policy of
“do nothing,” based on fear that it
may be charged with acting “politically,”
“endangering personal liberty,” “witch-
hunting,” “Red-baiting” and all the other
awful crimes which figure so largely in
the vocabularies of those who are afraid
of having their associations and friend-
ships examined in the broad light of day.
The Danger Spot.
Mr. Speaker Cameron, answering a
question addressed to him in the Rep-
resentatives last week, said he proposed
to disallow any reference in Parliament
to “the activities, history or character”
of representatives of foreign Governments
in Australia, and added that we should
soon have here again diplomatic emis-
saries from the countries of our late
enemies. Diplomatic envoys are accredited
to the Queen and her Governments in
any part of the British Commonwealth,
and their persons are privileged from
criticism. So far as they may at any
time get themselves into trouble, that is
a matter for Governments only.
Aside from the point of the question,
and the strictly correct answer, the
Speaker’s remarks drew attention to the
event of the week in Europe, on which
Mr. Casey later dilated at some length
in a statement on foreign affairs —the
signing at Bonn of the Western Allies’
peace contracts virtually restoring formal
peace and independence to the greater
portion of Germany and the German
people. That it will take more than these
proceedings to bring about peace in
Europe is shown by the Soviet’s proclama-
tion of them as a threat of renewed war
and by the fact that the event emphasises
the division of Germany by Moscow’s
Iron Curtain. A majority of the States
in the West German Republic and a
majority of the now sovereign—“almost
sovereign”—Bonn Parliament are opposed
to the Western peace contracts on that
very ground, that no peace terms, or
undertakings under them, should be
made by a German Government while
the country is divided. This is the view
of the German Social Democrats, who
ignore the fact that Moscow has dictated
its own “peace contracts” to and rearmed
East Germany, which is today to all
intents and purposes a Communist satel-
lite State.
The Russian protest addressed to the
Western Powers objected to their treaty
with West Germany on the grounds that
it is a breach of the Potsdam Agreement,
crystallises the division of Germany and
aims at the armament of West Germany,
which it declares to be a provocation to
another war. Every one of these grounds
of objection describes exactly what has
already been done in East Germany by
the Russians themselves. The refusal of
Moscow to countenance the holding of
all-German elections under U.N. auspices
still rings in everybody’s ears. The plain
facts are that East Germans are armed,
and that zone is heavily occupied by
Russian armies, as part of the Soviet’s
power-politics for overaweing Western
Europe. The rearmament of West Ger-
many within the European Defence Com-
munity has become a plain necessity in
counter to the Soviet’s threat of aggres-
sion. If peace is to wait till Germany
is permitted by Russia to unite, it will,
in the circumstances which have domi-
nated the scene for the past seven years,
be condemned to indefinite banishment.
West Germany’s population is little
short of that of the United Kingdom.
It is seat of that formidable industrial
equipment which in our time made Ger-
many the chief military Power on the
European continent, and also a sea-
Power, naval and maritime, which has
proved it can stretch Britain’s own to the
limit in war. There is located the main-
spring of that aggressive force which has
twice within 30 years made war on
Eastern and Western Europe and Britain
and America together, and twice come
perilously near to victory. The Russian
satellite States still fear this ruthless
neighbor; so does France ; and even to
the immense and confident Red armies
of today the alignment of West Germany
with Britain and America is something
of formidable military significance.
For all Europe the re-emergence of a
sovereign, though truncated, Germany is
a momentous event. The Germans’ good-
faith is plainly on trial. While their
restoration to sovereign power remains
suspect they will be something of an alien
in the European Defence Community and
in the N.A.T.O. organisation; and till
they evince by their behavior within that
community that they have ceased to be
alien they must inevitably arouse fear
among their neighbors.
The Soviet has leapt upon the oppor-
tunity to exploit such fears, and the im-
plementation of the “peace contracts”
will not be easy. The risk is plain, with-
out Moscow’s propaganda to embroider
it. Yet that risk had to be taken, as the
Western Powers agreed, in order to meet
the greater and more pressing risk of
inviting Soviet attack upon the Western
States whose defences without Germany
are obviously inadequate. Russian seizure
of the Ruhr alone would demoralise
Western resistance and undo all the work
of the European Recovery Plan under
American financial aid. The countries
threatened have not so far forgotten
Hitler that they can fail to misread the
politics of the gang in the Kremlin who
have appointed themselves Hitler’s heirs
and imitators. There is this hopeful light
in the critical days looming—that the
Germans have always regarded themselves
as superior in every sense to the Russians,
and are apparently undaunted by the
Russians now. Nothing in all their history
suggests that they would go to war under
Russian leadership.
Manifestly the desire of the West to
strengthen the anti-Communist armed
front by the inclusion in their ranks of
the largest and most coherent part of
Germany greatly enhances German
prestige and, with it, German interest in
solving the European problem. That the
Germans must both start from scratch
to rehabilitate themselves in European
society and stand in the front line against
any Russian assault are penalties due
from them for the wreck they have made
of Europe twice during the past half-
century. The test of any change of heart
in their rulers will be judged by their
submission to a reasoned Allied policy
for preventing the threatened war from
breaking out. That policy consists in
mobilising strength sufficient to deter the
Soviet bid for world-domination and
exercising restraint in order to allow
political pressure for a general negotiated
peace to assert itself. Of the Germans’
pride and self-confidence against com-
petition in war or peace we have had
ample demonstration; for the rest they
are unpredictable. With the Bonn Gov-
ernment’s Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, the
Western leaders are dealing on terms of
trust and friendship; but so, 25 years
ago, were they in dealing with Strese-
mann.
The chain of events begun last week
has drawn all eyes to the scene where
chiefly is poised that threat of renewed
war against which the democratic na-
tions of the world, including Australia,
are preparing. The appearance again of
a German army—and one as powerful
as that of any other European con-
tingent in the free nations’ defence
scheme —undoubtedly raises the tempera-
ture of the “cold war.” It was a step
forward which the Western democracies
could not avoid, and from which, once
planned, they could not have retreated
under Soviet opposition without acknow-
ledging Moscow as masters of Europe.
But it also highlights as the crux of the
quarrel with Russia the dispute over
German unity. The Germans, restored to
sovereignty, and with an army of their
own again, are not going to rest satisfied
with a border west of the Elbe and with
Berlin submerged in a satellite Russian
State. The Western Powers have been
impotent to prevent Moscow from claim-
ing, against the Potsdam agreement, a
permanent Polish boundary on the Oder.
When in due course the Germans refuse
to recognise that claim the West must
support them.
These are potentialities of the future
which need to be calculated. Restored
German unity was part of the
peace settlement agreed upon at
Potsdam in the long-ago days of 1945.
There will be no peace till this is
resolved to the satisfaction of the people
over whose destiny Russia and the
Western Allies have been quarrelling.
In these circumstances no Parliament,
in Australia or any other democracy,
dare any longer discuss the threat of war
as merely a staff-officers’ theory or the
mistaken obsession of one party in its
own domestic politics.
Juvenile Delinquency.
(By a Sydney Psychiatrist .)
11.
[ln a previous article the writer described the
commonest variety of juvenile delinquent as the
“hunter” type, whom urban civilisation chafed
severely.]
A characteristic of boys of the hunter
type is their apparent inability to con-
centrate. A wise teacher who has a class
of them will change the lessons more
frequently than the syllabus requires.
Forty years ago a boy could leave
school at the age of 12. Some celebrated
Australians never went to school at all.
But today a boy is obliged to go to school
until the age of 15, and is restricted in
his out-of-school hours. He may live
in a flat, and his parents may be terrified
of any noise likely to disturb the neigh-
bors. He must not play on the streets
because this is too dangerous. He must
not collect birds’-eggs, because his parents
hold strong views on the preservation of
bird-life—at a time when birds are being
destroyed in thousands by poison-bait
laid for rabbits—and he must not fight
because fighting is uncivilised; and, any-
way, clothes are too expensive. So much
for the background of many a city boy
from a better-class home. The case of
a boy from a rougher environment has
been pretty well documented.
But all city boys suffer certain restric-
tions, in varying degrees. There is a
shortage of fruit-trees to be robbed, and
no great number of caves to be explored.
The marvellous, pent-up energy of the
child is denied all sorts of healthy out-
lets, and, not unnaturally, it sometimes
explodes unconventionally.
When a boy could leave school at the
age of 12 there was that relief, at least,
to which he could look forward. I am,
of course, discussing a certain type of
boy. But when a boy of 12 who does
not like school and who has been forced
to conform to a code of behaviour devised
by unimaginative adults—a code of which
he does not approve, and about which his
opinion has not been asked —sits down
seriously to think that he has another
three years of forced education to endure,
he revolts. He is quite logical about it.
He can see no good sense in what he
is learning, for his private purposes: he
may wish to be a soldier, a sailor, a
lion-tamer or a secret-service agent.
What, then, is the sense of learning arith-
metic and history when he might be pick-
ing up useful tips about his future trade?
Being a man of action, he does something
about it. If some educationalists have their
way the school leaving-age will be raised
to sixteen; in which case I predict a
sharp rise in juvenile delinquency.
These views have been presented to the
proper authorities before. They were not
received with any marked gratitude. The


official opinion is, briefly, tßat if children
are free to leave school at the age ol 1 ,
the example of those leaving will have
a disturbing effect on the others. It is
also believed that a boy of ot
school, will roam the streets and be ex-
posed to moral corruption. There is
something in that; but it should not be
forgotten that the average schoolchild,
particularly in crowded areas, is exposed
to a deal of corruption anyway. This
view also seems to seriously underestimate
the influence of Hollywood.
Over and above all that, any suggestion
to lower the compulsory school-leaving
age is a criticism of the system; and
systems are sensitive to criticism. There
is, too, the not-inconsiderable factor that
an increase in the school leaving-age to
sixteen means more schools, teachers,
inspectors, typists, accountants, filing
clerks, cleaners —a “bigger and better
system.”
At present the boy who has formed
an earnest desire to leave his school
knows well that there is a practical course
open to him. He can behave so out-
rageously that he will be expelled, and
continue in his chosen course of conduct
until no headmaster will accept him. I
sometimes think that we gravely misjudge
the subtlety and worldly-wisdom of
children.
The first signs of rebellion are that the
boy “wags” school, and continues to do
so from time to time, with increasing
frequency and boldness, until the Educa-
tion Department catches up with him.
On investigation it is often discovered
that the boy has been aided and abetted
by an over-sympathetic but intelligent
mother. This first sharp warning is often
sufficient to convince boys that they
should put up with things as they are.
But others cannot knuckle under, and
they are charged with being uncontroll-
able children.
They are put in a “children’s shelter,
and there an exhaustive history is taken
by psychologists and psychiatrists. I can
never convince myself that what the boys
say at these interviews is reliable. They
embellish, distort and suppress informa-
tion with rare skill —they tell the
examiner, in short, just as much of the
truth as they consider expedient. The
crimes for which boys are committed
are various ; apart from truancy, petty
thieving and the like, a boy may be
accused of sexual offences against girls.
These offences may be only a form of
curiosity, and of no great significance.
But once a boy has been before a
court, for whatever reason, he feels
“branded.” His position is worse if his
parents are separated, or if he comes
from a slum area and has never had
anything he can call his own. No matter
how trivial the offence, a boy feels very
lonely and vulnerable against the impres-
sive paraphernalia of the law. With the
emotionalism of youth he sees himself a
deserted, misunderstood figure, fighting a
cold and hostile world. Court officials,
Child Welfare Department officers —and
psychiatrists—represent authority, and are
viewed with suspicion. It is not surpris-
ing that these children reach a stage
where they feel they can trust no man
and no woman.
They not only feel that they are pitted
against the formidable machinery of
society ; they feel there is a basic unfair-
ness in the competition when they are
punished for offences of which their
elders boast. Parents congratulate them-
selves on “scaling” fares, dodging income-
tax, “souveniring” crockery and cutlery
from restaurants and hotels, and a host
of mean offences. Governments and
business firms are losing thousands
because of dishonest employees. Girls
charged with vagrancy and immorality
enviously contemplate their more favored
sisters who boast of their sex exploits.
Lack of courtesy is a general accusation
flung at the young. Discourtesy! If there
is anything less polite than the behavior
of the average crowd of Sydney adults
I have yet to behold it.
One cannot entirely escape the thought
that we make strenuous efforts to reform
the young because we would like them
to reform —naturally—but also because
they are too young and helpless to defend
themselves. The reform of older and
more powerful people presents formidable
difficulties. In the first flush of indigna-
tion I would have liked to reform the man
who rudely beat me to a parking space ;
and many others. There are a host of
candidates for reform in Sydney, and any
Australian city. It seems a pity that we
should pick on the juvenile delinquent.
If we are going to indulge in excesses of
righteous indignation we should at least
start by picking on someone our own
size.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Up for Sale.
Evidence is accumulating that in the
past few years Australians are fast
growing into a haunted people who
cannot face adversity. Like spoilt children
they kick against pricks, and anybody
who dares to tell them an unpleasant
truth honestly, instead of wrapping it
up in deceit and honeyed palaver, can
expect no quarter.
Last week Mr. McEwen, Minister for
Commerce, had the temerity to tell the
country that its people could expect to
be subject to high taxation for the rest
of their lives. Perhaps Mr. McEwen was
not diplomatic in doing this ; but can any
politician, “Labor” or Liberal, see any
real easing of burdens, with the debts of
two world wars to pay, with threats of
new war, with high “social-security’
handouts and steadily-declining produc-
tion per head as the result of the propa-
gation of a doctrine of loaf, strike and
subversion?
The Liverpool (N.S.W.) State by-elec-
tion and the Brisbane municipal elections,
in both of which “Labor” has had a
strong swing in its favor, picture the state
of public opinion. There is still existent
a large and solid core of Australians in
the population who believe in real work
and are ready to take the burden of hard
times, pull their weight and trust sober
leaders. But it becomes more evident
every day that there is also a body of
debauched and corrupted voters who are
prepared to sell themselves to any un-
scrupulous politician willing to promise
them ease and opulence, no matter
whether it be at the expense of the
country’s security or at that of some
other section.
This body unfortunately seems now to
be large enough to determine the result
of any election.
Anti-Inflation Is Working.
Not so much is being heard from
“Labor” about “putting value back in
the pound,” and silence has fallen upon all
those who were urging the Menzies
Government to take over price-control.
The reason isn’t far to seek. A walk
round Sydney shopping centres shows that
the pound will now buy more, and that
many prices are falling.
Last week the Commonwealth Statis-
tician announced that national spending
on retail goods for the March quarter
of 1952 was £54.7 million below that of
the same quarter of 1951. Which
supports what is evident to most house-
wives. Many clothing lines are a lot
cheaper than they were six months ago,
many others have not increased in price,
some lines of food are down, and a
considerable number of storekeepers are
offering special inducements to buy.
Reports of higher output of coal and
steel are now coming to hand, and more
men are ready to work in essential
industry.
Which all means, if it means any-
thing, that the Canberra Government’s
budgetary and other methods to stop the
inflationary spiral are succeeding as far as
food and clothing are concerned. Food-
stuffs on fixed prices and under board
control, such as eggs, milk, fish and
butter, are no cheaper, but pretty well all
board-free foods are. Housewives in par-
ticular are finding that the pound will cer-
tainly buy a little more than it would
before the Government took action.
Time Running Against Us.
Victorian Chamber of Manufactures
heard chairman Harkness last week in
an exhortation all too rare in public state-
ments by Australian businessmen. He said
that the tremendous task being tackled
by the Commonwealth Government —in
defence, development and maintenance of
the standard of living—is “one we must
all tackle. The real solution lies in what
other industrial countries have done
successfully—namely, more work by
everybody for the survival and progress
of the nation.”
Mr. Harkness called for a united effort
by employer and employee alike to reduce
costs of production.
Australian industry must rise to the
occasion by not only meeting domestic re-
quirements but also in seeking to compete
i in overseas markets so as to earn badly-
needed foreign credits....
We have to a great extent wasted the
post-war years, and as a nation have been
inclined to sit back, and in spite of many
warnings lived in the illusion that the
good times would last for ever. We now
awake to find other countries have been
making better use of their time We
must face the added threat of a revived
Germany and Japan ready and eager to
sacrifice many domestic comforts to
capture once again the markets of the
world.
Here are some of the signs of negligence
and slackness which have aggravated our
economic difficulties:
Every general holiday, apart from trade
holidays, has been estimated to cost Aus-
tralia £5,000,000 in wages paid tor no work
done and £10,000,000-worth ol production
lost.
Social services will cost £138,000,000 this
year, or 40 per cent, more than the whole
of the Commonwealth expenditure in the
last pre-war year.
The Minister for Social Services recently
stated that 3,000,000 Australians are now
receiving social “benefits,” which, in a
total of 8,500,000, is a large proportion.
East year the numbers on the Federal
payroll were said to have been reduced by
12,499, but salaries paid in that year were
£24,250,000 more than in the year before.
Manufacturers were warned that
under the inroads of Government controls
a considerable part of the business of the
country is now conducted by those who
have little to gain by success or to lose
by failure. “With an excessive proportion
of the national income in the coffers of
the State want becomes more
important than worth, and the fact that
people are said to want something is
accepted as proof of their right to have
it.”
These are symptoms of a malaise which
is not to be dismissed by a political vote
or cured by denunciations of financial
restrictions imposed by the Government
in defence of the nation’s reduced reserves
against a worse calamity. The time per-
mitted us for counter-action is, as the
Manufacturers’ chairman said, running
short.
A Ghost Train.
A letter (colloquially known as a
“stinking letter”) from the Hon. William
Francis Sheahan, LL.B., Minister of the
Crown in the N. S. Wales Cahill
Government:
In your issue of May 21, under
the heading of “Another Peking Picnic,”
you refer to the visit to Peking by a dele-
gation of Australian Communist-dominated
trade-unionists. In line 21 you make the
statement that the Committee for Peace in
the Pacific had enough money and assist-
ance to organise large deputations to
Canberra, carried in “Peace Trains.”
The statement that these deputations were
carried in “Peace Trains” is a deliberate
lie. I personally gave directions on Feb-
ruary 21 that no special trains, trams or
buses were to be made available to this
committee, on an application made to me,
and I made it quite clear to the depart-
ments concerned that they were to watch
and see that no application was made by
persons assuming to act for them but under
cover.
Your paper frequently delivers journalistic
homilies to the public about standards of
decency of others. Will you have the
decency to conform with your own standards
for the article that this committee had
deputations to Canberra carried in “Peace
Trains” to be denied in the same prominent
position as you published such unjust state-
ments regarding the Railway Department
of this State?
Mr. Sheahan seems very annoyed and
most unparliamentary. And no doubt he
feels that way, in view of all the talk
there has been lately about the action of
his Government in dealing out rough
injustice to dispossessed landholders in
country areas whose properties have been
seized at 1942 values (‘‘plus 15 per cent, if
you go quietly”) in the name of soldier-
settlement. The Federal Government, a
partner in the soldier-settlement scheme,
has disclaimed responsibility for the N. S.
Wales Government’s acquisition methods,
and has taken legislative action to see that
dispossessed landholders (sometimes
returned soldiers themselves) get a just
price for what has been taken from them
by legal force. Mr. Sheahan was Minister
for Lands during the formative period of
his Government’s land - confiscation
policy, and he is the member for
Burrinjuck, a pastoral area.
Now Mr. Sheahan is Minister for
Transport, and no doubt it is a worrying
job. Still, he should control himself and
not make charges which cannot be sub-
stantiated, such as “deliberate lying.”
The reference to “peace-trains” in B.
21/5/’52 was purely an incidental one,
to illustrate the extent of the resources
of the “peace” committee, and was
not in any way an attack on the
railways themselves. And the mention
was by no means a fabrication. There
were several prior references to it by other
newspapers. If Mr. Sheahan will refer
to the “Tribune,” official organ of the
Communist party, February 20, page 1,
he will find the statement of the
“secretary-treasurer of the Society for
Non-ratification of the Japanese Peace
Treaty, Revd. G. R. Van Eerde,” to«£he
effect that “seats on next Wednesday’s
Peace Train to Canberra to protest against
the Japanese treaty have been booked
out.” And on February 28 he will find in
the “Sydney Morning Herald,” page 4, a
statement that a mass-deputation against
the ratification of the peace-treaty with
Japan had come to Canberra by “plane,
coach and special train from Brisbane,
Newcastle, Sydney, Wollongong and
Melbourne.”
What happened about this train ulti-
mately The Bulletin is not prepared to
swear; without first-hand information it
would not be prepared to swear as to the
whereabouts or nature of any N. S.
Wales train at any given time. If Mr.
Sheahan really can’t trace it his best bet
would be to have a look in Wynyard
tunnel. Sydney “Herald,” however, seems
to think it reached Canberra ; it refers
to it as a “special” train, though it may
have been just an ordinary old N. S.
Wales train. If Mr. Sheahan is in any
further doubt on the matter he might
consult with his Ministerial colleague,
Mr. Clive Evatt, Q.C., who was billed as
president of the body which said
repeatedly that it was booking a special
“Peace Train” for the purpose of taking
this Communist- and fellow-traveller-
promoted delegation to the Federal
capital.
- -o-
Ward to the Rescue.
The disclosure by Mr. Casey that the
claim of the Communist party’s official
organ —to which The Bulletin had
already called attention in its issue of
21/5/’52 —that a high civil servant had
given it the text of a treaty, in process of
negotiation with the United States early
in 1951, was apparently true did the
useful service of making clear the position
of some members of the “Labor” Opposi-
tion.
Mr. Casey, replying to a question by
Mr. W. C. Wentworth, said that the
treaty’s text must have been given out
by a reasonably senior public servant;
and (also in reply to Mr. Wentworth),
that Dr. Burton, formerly secretary to the
Department of External Affairs, had left
the service of the department about the
middle of 1951. The date of the appear-
ance of this leak was November, 1951.
Mr. Casey said that the Government was
trying to unearth a nest of traitors in the
public service which had “an extremely
dangerous Communist core.”
The remarkable feature of the Opposi-
tion’s attitude was that neither its leader
nor deputy-leader associated himself with
the Government’s concern at the posi-
tion. But Messrs. Ward and Haylen
rushed heatedly not only to defend
Dr. Burton, but to suggest that Mr.
Casey’s statement was, in Mr. Hayien’s
words, the “product of an excited mind”;
in fact, “a broad unsubstantiated state-
ment” calculated to “do injury to the
security of the nation and the prestige
of the Commonwealth.”
Mr. Ward declared that “my informa-
tion is that the statement which appeared
in the ‘Tribune’ was not the result of
a leakage, but of an ordinary handout,”
There was no question of the
“Tribune’s” information about the treaty
being a handout. If Mr. Ward read its
article he certainly must have known it
when he made his speech. The “Tribune ’
writer declared that “the treaty had never
been tabled in Parliament,” that “the
Canberra Guilty Men have kept it hidden
away and public opinion must be roused
to a point where they are forced to dis-
close its infamous terms” ; finally, that
“a highly-placed Government official
revealed the existence of the Treaty to
me because he was disgusted to think
that any Government would sign away
the independence of the country in which
they were born and which they profess to
10ve.... Briefly I was told application of
the Treaty and other allied ties spells
doom to the Australian Constitution, to
Australia’s independent membership of
the British Commonwealth of Nations.
The treaty must be brought to light.”
Whatever an inquiry about Communism
in high places might establish, one thing
would be easily provable by public
reports: that the Communist party can
depend on a diversionary sortie, led by
Mr. Ward, coming from elements of the
“Labor” side whenever Communist
interests are affected. This has been true
for more than a decade.
A Lot's in a Name.
With Evatt minor back among the
foundation-stones it was a moral that it
wouldn’t be long before the fun-and-
games started. They’re on all right.
According to report, Clive has decided to
name a Housing Commission block of
flats in North Sydney Geraghty Court,
thus honoring the name of the M.L.A.
for the district.
Under “Labor” rules this is quite
correct procedure, the sitting “Labor”
member being considered the most im-
portant person, past, present or future,
in his electorate. It is, however, a little
unfortunate for the cause of amity and
concord within the A.L.P. that the sitting
member for North Sydney, although his
vote has kept “Labor” in office for the
past two years, is not a member of the
A.L.P., having been expelled from the
party for opposing its endorsed candidate,

Maher, at the 1950 election. More unfor-
tunate still, that he intends to oppose him
again at the next election.
Maher’s reaction to the report, as con-
fided to the “Daily Telegraph,” was that
it “seemed a deliberate attempt to preju-
dice Labor’s chances in North Sydney” —
a remark which seems to underrate both
his. own electioneering ability and the
intelligence of the people whose votes he
seeks. He went on to say:
There seems to be no end to the em-
barrassment and indignity that Mr. Evatt
heaps upon the Labor party. Every A.L.P.
branch in the North Sydney electorate has
condemned Mr. Evatt’s action.
Mr. Geraghty’s response to that, with
a rush of alliteration to the tongue, was
that it was a pity Mr. Maher could not
rise above petty party politics. Mr.
Evatt’s response was that he had no
comment —a condition almost without
precedent in his case-history.
No one has suggested any alternative
title for the flats, but Clive seems to have
missed a great opportunity of doing some-
thing in the cause of amity and concord
aforementioned. He could have paid a
graceful tribute to Gus Kelly, his sup-
planter a couple of years ago as Minister
for Housing and, more recently, as Chief
Secretary, and named the building Kelly
Court. Then everyone in the A.L.P.
garden would have been happy, if not
lovely. True, Mr. Geraghty would have
missed his chance of a monument, but
that would teach him not to offend the
A.L.P. executive. There’s really only one
objection, except on grounds of euphony,
to tacking the name Kelly to the flats —
people might get their Kellys mixed.
This thought possibly caused Evatt
minor to pass over his Cabinet colleague,
as he would doubtless recall some jesting
at the naming ceremony of another block
of North Sydney flats just two years ago.
The flats were named after Macquarie’s
architect, Francis Greenway, and at the
ceremony another Mr. Kelly, Deputy-
Director of Housing, suggested humor-
ously that he might live to see a building
dedicated to another illustrious person in
Australian history—one with the same
name as himself. Whereat Geraghty
loudly declared that he knew just the
building for the purpose—it was up in
Goulburn-street. Nobody asked for
further details ; the best-known building
in Goulburn-street is the Trades Hall.
The foundation-stone of Geraghty
Court, or Kelly Court, is due to be
unveiled on Saturday; the veil obscuring
caucus discussions on the name is better
left undisturbed.
POLITICAL POINTS
State Premiers are getting ready to ask
for more —there’s to be a special meeting
of the Loan Council early next month.
The position at present is this: The
Premiers at the Council meeting early in
May tabled a programme totalling £345
million, but the Commonwealth repre-
sentatives (the Prime Minister and the
Treasurer) held that £175 million would
be the maximum they could agree to ;
they were prepared to commit the Com-
monwealth to support loan-works to the
extent of £125 million and they estimated
that the loan-market would not yield more
than £5O million. Later, the Premiers
reduced their “demand” to £247 million
and the P.M. offered to find another £lO
million from this year’s carryover. The
Federal limit, he insisted, was £lB5
million. The Premiers stuck to their
figure, and, the Commonwealth dissenting,
recorded a 6-to-2 vote in favor of £247
million.
After the meeting it was obvious that,
although the six Premiers had voted for
the larger figure, none of them really
expected the loan-market to enable them
to achieve it, and that as the Common-
wealth was firm in its refusal to guarantee
any help beyond £lB5 million, the vote
was more in the nature of a protest than
a practical programme. Just what is ex-
pected from a further meeting is hard to
say. Menzies has warned that to agree
to the States’ full schedule would mean
real inflation —“and when I talk of real
inflation I mean just that; not fractional
inflation” —so unless the Premiers can
disprove him on this point there seems
little likelihood of any more guarantees
from the Commonwealth.
As was to be expected, Dr. Burton is
following the Communist party-line on
the germ-warfare allegations. Well, not
exactly the party-line, but one closely
parallel to it. He’s “not concerned with
asserting whether the Chinese charges are
true or untrue,” but thinks there should
be an inquiry and a “public affirmation”
that Australia will abide by the Geneva
Convention. He wants “an Australian
civilian to make an on-the-spot in-
vestigation.” Burton must be well aware
that both the U.S. Government and U.N.
field commanders have denied the germ-
slanders and that Peking has refused an
inquiry by the International Red Cross
Wnat “trustworthy Australian civilian”
would China permit to check the charges
—other than Ernie Thornton?
Is Doc. Evatt about to drop Doc.
Burton? On Sunday he said that his
former protege’s views were “entirely his
own responsibility.” All candidates for
“Labor” nomination sign a pledge to
adhere to the party platform. Burton is
the endorsed “Labor” candidate for
Lowe. How then can his views on a
matter which Evatt claims to have
described in Parliament as “obviously
detrimental to the defence security of
the Australian troops in the combat zone”
be entirely his own responsibility? It
looks as if the young Doc. will be dropped
because he is too hot for the old Doc.
to carry any longer.
Evatt now thinks the Government is
“open to the gravest criticism” for per-
mitting the outpouring of germ-warfare
propaganda. A lot of people heartily
agree with him, but coming from Evatt
it is a staggering novelty. Any day now
he may be expected to move a motion of
want-of-confidence in the Government
for having failed to use its defence powers
to ban the Communist party.
The puzzling problem of who is the
real Premier of Victoria is becoming more
perplexing than ever. McDonald carries
the title and draws the pay, but as his
Farmers’ Dozen can’t do anything with-
out the permission of “Labor,” general
opinion has never accorded him more
than a half-Premiership. Now Opposi-
tion-leader Norman has accused the other
half, Cain, of being a mere figurehead
in his own party, with Barry, M.L.A. for
Carlton, as the man who issues the orders.
That should make Barry at least a better-
half Premier
Cain and his party are so impressed
with the “eight per cent, swing” in the
Liverpool by-election in N.S.W. that they
are talking of making McDonald force
through Parliament the Greater Mel-
bourne Council Bill and a bill for redis-
tribution of electorates, and then deserting
him in order to bring about an election
“in August or September.” And it’s on
the cards that the McDonald “Govern-
ment” may fall for it.
Liberal-leader Norman is talking elec-
tions, too. At Bendigo, opening the
Opposition’s campaign in the Legislative
Council elections on the new adult
franchise, he got an enthusiastic recep-
tion for a trenchant attack on the
“corrupt” pact under which the Mc-
Donald C.P. minority has held office.
He said a win for his party in the Upper
House contest would bring about a
general election “reasonably quickly,” and
save the State from “the worst type of
political racketeering” in the Greater
Melbourne Bill.
It was suggested in these columns (B.
27/2/’52) that the reason for swamping
the new Sydney - Cricket - and - Sports-
Ground Trust with “Labor” political
appointees (including Dr. Evatt) was the
commercialisation of Sunday for League
football and the bookies. Last Sunday
the thing happened. The Sydney-Country
League match, originally set down for the
Sabbath on the “Labor” - governed
Wollongong Showground, was transferred
to the Sydney ground. “There was a free
gate and so no breach of the law,” but
“patrons at the ground said they were
charged “voluntary contributions” of 4s.
for the grandstand area and 2s. 6d. for
the outer ground. The churches which
Dr. Evatt has been wooing for Parlia-
mentary support are already protesting
and are apparently surprised.
Queensland Parliament is flying a kite
for increased salaries for members. In
the last session Premier Gair blocked a
private members’ move for more pay,
but it’s on again, and this time the boys
are talking of another £375 a year, which
would bring their screw to £1750. It is
perhaps only a coincidence that Gair
blocked the earlier move about the time
the Ithaca by-election was due.
N.S.W. Minister for Transport Sheahan
recently announced that some road trans-
port would be stopped by taxation and
other means because the railways were
now able to handle freight. His opposite-
numbers in South Australia and Vic-
toria promptly echoed him. All three
apparently failed to notice what Com-
monwealth Minister for Transport Mc-
Leay had to say about their railways in
the same week:
Working-time on railways is reduced by
annual long-service leave and sick-leave and
strikes to about 30 hours a week. The
reduction of nominal working-hours from
44 to 40 hours a week had cost Australian
railways £8.6 million in 1950-51 and the
“prosperity loading” another £2.1 million.
Perhaps the real offence of the road-trans-
port men is that they work much more
than 30 hours a week and thus set a bad
example.
Next time the landlord’s recurrent plea
for a fair rental is debated, N.S.W.
Assembly might consider the record of
its Government Housing Commission,
which, according to its latest report (for
a period now two years old), received
£1,160,000 in rents and paid out £390,000
for repairs, maintenance and depreciation
of buildings, or 6s. Bd. in the £, and
then wonders why this sort of thing is
not encouraging the reduction of “the
lag in home-building.”
Incidentally, this same Housing Com-
mission in the four years up to June,
1949, lost £340,000 of public money, and
in the following year another £210,000-
odd, making £550,000-odd in all. This
works out, on houses completed in the
five years, at £4O a house.
Elections for the executive of the
Federated Clerks’ Union, whose general-
secretary, J. R. Hughes, is a member of the
Communist-party politbureau, gives a
pointer to the directions in which the
Communists are aiming their infiltrations
of membership. Though the Reds are
likely to be defeated in the aggregate, the
industrial-groups lost in the newspaper,
airways and retail sections of the union.
The strikes at Qantas, an organisation
vital both to Australian and British Com-
monwealth defence, shows how deep the
cancer has eatfn into the air-transit
industry. Yet the Government seems to
be powerless to do anything, thanks to
Dr. Evatt’s efforts and its own lassitude
during the referendum campaign.
“Sunday Herald,” discussing the
Federal Government’s loss of popularity,
remarked that “Liberal- and Country-
party officials believe that, unless the drift
is arrested, the Government will lose
control of the Senate next year and the
House of Representatives in 1954.” If
the party officials believe the first part of
that there is something wrong with their
information. Next year half the Senators
will face the electors. Of these, 17 will
be “Labor” men and 13 Government, and
the Senate “rump” will then comprise 11
“Labor” and 19 Government members.
If “Labor” scores a three-two win in
every State next year the Government will
still have a Senate majority of two, the
actual membership being 31-29.
It may be only a coincidence that
“Labor’s” candidate for the Ashfield
vacancy in the N. S. Wales Assembly,
caused through the elevation of Athol
Richardson to the judiciary, is also a
Richardson and also a man of law, but
it is bound to cause some confusion on
polling-day. Liberal candidate is Ray
Watson, a 29-year-old barrister who, in
four previous attempts to enter State and
Federal politics, has put up good fights
in “Labor” strongholds. Liberal majority
in Ashfield two years ago was 3737, and
despite “Labor’s” optimism since the
Liverpool by-election Watson should be
all set for Macquarie-street this time.
Sydney Water Board’s £1,750,000 loan,
issued at the high rate of 4| per cent.,
closed a fortnight late with only
£1,096,000 subscribed late last month.
Now Mr. Cahill should be given a chance
to raise the £100,000,000 or so that he
says he needs for his modest plans, and
which the wicked Commonwealth won’t
raise for him.
Death on May 3 of Mrs. Bridget Red-
mond broke a Parliamentary link that had
lasted 61 years. John Redmond was
elected to the House of Commons as
member for Waterford in 1891 and
represented it until his death in 1918 ;
he was for many years leader of the
Irish members. He was succeeded by his
son, Captain Willie Redmond, D. 5.0.,
who represented Waterford first at West-
minster and, after the establishment of
the Irish Free State, in the Dail. On his
death, in 1933, his widow, Bridget, was
nominated. She won the seat and re-
tained it at all subsequent elections.
The Communists caused the wharfies’
union a loss of £5OO of its funds when
the Arbitration Court imposed on
Monday a fine of £5OO for contempt of
court.
The clear explanation of the local
dove: —
Visitors to the Australian Peace Council, 175
Hay-street, Sydney, will find the council
camouflaged behind the Chinese-written signs
indicating the offices of the Australian-Chinese
Association, devoted to the interests of Mao
and Co., and not to be confused with the
Australia-China Association, 155 King-street,
devoted to the interests of Chiang. The Peace
Council —secretary Paul Mortier, formerly sec-
retary to the Darwin branch of the Communist
party—gives its telephone-number as M 3501,
but this is entered in the telephone-directory
as the number of the Australasian-Indonesian
Association. The Peace Council also announces
that the declarations of the Committee for
Peace in the Pacific (against the rearmament
of Japan) can be signed at its office, and this
body asks its inquirers to call it on business
at MX1912, which is listed as Rev. Van Eerde’s
“Mission Office, Botany,” and MA3859, which
belongs to the Amalgamated Postal Workers’
Union. Peace, even if indivisible, seems very
complicated.

Half-way to Nowhere
Although there has been a
great deal of post-war economic
activity and speculation, Aus-
tralian productivity and actual
profit-earning have been re-
stricted. This applies more par-
ticularly to major industries of
the manufacturing and distribut-
ing variety. Thus we find con-
cerns like Broken Hill Pro-
prietary still paying no more than
oi per cent, in dividend, and
Australian Paper Manufacturers,
in which the investing public
have an equity interest through
Australasian Paper, still paying
under 9 p.c. and its public pro-
prietors getting 7 p.c. The
A.P.M. concern has a vast enter-
prise operating now and an in-
vested capital of about £ll
million, with still more coming
in. It has also had a very keen
demand for its products over the
past 12 years.
Much the same story is true
of Colonial Sugar and British
Tobacco. Shareholders have got
little or nothing out of the ex-
pansion of the past decade.
True, they may be receiving a
steady dividend, at the old rate,
on any new capital put up; but
in many cases they have been
compelled to pay a premium for
the new scrip. The Chifley Gov-
ernment generally insisted on a
premium wherever shares were
above par value on the market.
One reason for the compara-
tively poor showing of industry,
from the investor’s point of view,
in the post-war period has been
price-control. Another has been
heavy—usually double-taxa-
tion. A third —and most im-
portant one —-has been the low
rate of productivity per man-
hour. This third factor has been
a major contributor to the first
two problems.
The proprietary side of indus-
try has had to bear the brunt of
the attempt to control inflation.
Whilst wage-earners have been
given a 40-hour week and various
“prosperity” loadings, with the
result that the basic wage has
almost trebled since war began,
industry itself has been kept
down to a less-than-20 p.c. in-
crease in its earning-rates, and
this on capital invested largely
in pre-war pounds. The investor
has fared very badly indeed in
the gross inflation that has
occurred as a result of war-time
finance and the “full-employ-
ment” jag that has followed it.
Australia is a backward coun-
try industrially, notwithstanding
the bright spots that shine out
in its economy, such as B.H.P.
and the woolgrowing industry.
And it will go further backward
under present politico-economic
conditions. What has to be
realised is that development must
be encouraged, and the highest
premium placed on efficiency,
otherwise we shall continue to
flap along like a shot bird.
We are at present in that un-
enviable position of being half-
way along the road to Socialism,
which means that we are half-
way from nowhere. Private
enterprise is loaded with para-
sites who, in terms ol ie^ t pro-
duction, have little to show for
themselves.
There has to be real produc-
tion, real profit, real saving and
real investment on a much larger
scale than we have seen in recent
years. True, there is a big pro-
duction-lag dating back to the
time of the country’s wide
munitions effort during World
War 11. But little real attempt
has been made to overcome this
lag by the people—the wage-
earners—who are ever pressing
for a higher standard of living.
In effect, the trade-union move-
ment has become something of
a Siamese Twin, one twin ever
demanding more pay for less
work, and the other demanding
more production at lower
prices. It is an irreconcilable
position.
Without a great deal more
real investment Australia’s
"Any previous occupations ?”
deteriorating working assets will
depreciate further. Already it is
difficult to raise public loan
money and foi companies to find
new capital resources. And it
will remain difficult so long as
our productivity and transport
facilities remain at their present
inadequate level. Even over-
seas borrowing is made the
more difficult by the fact that
our surplus of production for
export is so low that payment
of interest and repayment of
principal threaten to be a burden
because of our declining over-
seas income.
Before there is any real turn
for the better in the Australian
economy we will need to see
more coal production, an im-
proved and freer transport ser-
vice, greater steel output, an
increased yield of food from the
rural areas, and the prospect of
considerably greater profit com-
ing to industry as a whole. It
is industry which organises pro-
duction, and it is the proprietary
side of industry which provides
the savings for investment.
Wage-earners as a rule are the
consumers; investors are the
savers. And it is from savings
that the whole of the resources
of industry are financed.
There are many immediate
problems confronting the
Federal Government which
demand short-term treatment
especially in view of the obstruc-
tive attitude of State “Labor”
Governments. But there will be
no real solution of our troubles
until we realise fully that for
development we need large
capital resources, and that
capital, whether from internal or
overseas sources, will not be
readily available until our rate
of production and real saving in-
creases very considerably.
Sharemarket Slackens
After a spell of slightly-rising
prices, Australian sharemarkets
slackened again last week on
light turnover. Income-tax
assessments are now going out
to the larger income-earners in
considerable numbers, and even
where taxpayers have made pro-
vision for their liability, the
presence of these assessments has
anything but a cheering effect.
Overseas news, too, has not
been reassuring, especially where
it concerns the clash of the
Western Powers with Communist
forces in Asia or in Europe. And
at the same time reports have
been coming through about a
considerable laying-off of staff in
the heavy and electrical indus-
tries. In N. S. Wales the under-
subscription of the Water Board
loan seemed to indicate a slow-
ing-down of public-body expen-
diture of a capital nature, as
the Loan Council meeting results
had already suggested.
Any reversal of a major eco-
nomic trend must have discon-
certing results. This is especi-
ally so where there is a political
division among the people, and
a great deal of political dis-
honesty and Communist
treachery involved. But there
are signs that the output per head
of people employed is at last
increasing slightly, and if that
trend continues it promises well
for the whole industrial future
of Australia.
More than from anything else,
Australian industry is suffering
from a production slump. We
are by no means near the point
where there is overproduction of
essential materials and manu-
factures, let alone food ; in fact,
we are worse off in most of these
respects than we were 12 years
ago. And, though our produc-
tivity is so low, we are at present
faced with a large defence pro-
gramme, one which will cost us
£l5O million during the financial
year now closing. No wonder
that we are feeling the pinch
financially. If our financial posi-
tion suggested anything else it
would be economic fakery of the
worst order.
At the same time it should be
noted by investors that there has
already been a big slump in share
prices, especially those which are
regarded as second-line stocks.
There are undoubtedly many
bargains available among these.
And there is, quite obviously,
any amount of work awaiting
essential industry, and this must
be attended to as soon as the
present major economic re-
adjustment being carried out by
the Federal Government starts
to clarify itself.
Commonwealth loans are
getting a very bad advertisement
at the moment in the eyes of
people who established a fund
to meet income-tax commitments
and invested the proceeds in
bonds. In many cases their
securities are at a heavy dis-
count, and the taxpayer who has
to face a stiff assessment and a
substantial realisation loss on his
Consols is in no mood to sup-
port further loans. The irony of
the thing is that the Treasury
will not accept its own paper at
par in payment of taxation dues!

Tax relief would
lift production
SIR CLIVE McPHERSON, chairman of Young-
husband Ltd., said at the annual meeting held in
Melbourne on May 27, that relief from the
present heavy taxation could do much to help
expand Australia’s primary production.
He reported to shareholders
satisfactory results for the past
year, although neither turnover
nor profit was up to that of the
previous year.
In the course of his address,
Sir Clive McPherson said:
“Recent autumn rains ha,ve
given some cause for optimism
concerning the coming year in
southern Australia, and we look
forward with good hope to an-
other satisfactory season.
STOCK:
“Our sheep numbers in Aus-
tralia continue to show a satis-
factory increase—at the last
census in March, 1951 (the latest
available), sheep totalled I 15.5
million, and, with the increase
since, should now be in the
vicinity of 118 million.
"Cattle figures taken at the
same period totalled 1 5.2 million,
but in Queensland and the
Northern Territory severe
drought conditions have prevailed
during this past year. The
drought still continues in the
Territory with such severity that
heavy losses are still being
suffered.
WHEAT:
“Returns for the 1949-50
season totalled 203 million
bushels as against 1 70 million for
1950- and 145 million for
1951-
WOOL:
“The average realised for Aus-
tralian wool last year was 144.94 d.
per lb. Up to the present this
year the average is 75.08 d. per
lb., but it should be noted that it
was the higher value in the early
part of this year that made
75.08 d. average possible; the
price at present is below this
latter figure.
CAPITAL ISSUES:
“During the year application
was made to the Capital Issues
Board for permission to increase
the capital of the company, but
without success. Falling wool
prices and stock values have re-
duced for the time being the
necessity for further capital.
“At our stock sales during this
period last year the average per
head for sheep was about
£5/10/-, as against about
£2/1 5/- this year.
“Your directors still have the
matter under consideration.
GENERAL CONDITIONS;
“We are now seeing reflected
in industry generally the result
of the swing back in prices from
the peak point of last year, when
our national income totalled
£3,101 million, as against £779
million in 1939. Wool being, of
course, the major factor con-
tributing to this rise, realising
£636 million in 1950-51, against
about £3OO million in the current
year.
“Good seasons and good prices
combined have been the basis of
great prosperity in Australia,
culminating in an all-time record
national income for 1950-51.
Hand in hand with such pros-
perity have gone continued rising
costs, and now comes the difficult
period of readjustment.
“It is not an over-statement to
say that generally costs in in-
dustry have increased 50% during
the last two years. This would
have presented much difficulty
even had revenue remained the
same, but, unfortunately, returns
in many industries have receded
considerably.
“And here ia the problem
which faces Australia. It must be
resolutely faced by all sections
in their willingness to contribute
to a stable economy, and the
sooner the better, for it must be
squarely faced eventually.
“Fixed charges must have re-
gard to prevailing conditions, but
today these are based on the peak
revenue period and cannot be
sustained.
METHOD OF TAXATION.
‘‘l think it is generally agreed
that more export production is
the main factor in the solution of
our present major problem in
Australia.
“There has been much discus-
sion around this matter. Relief
from present heavy taxation as
soon as possible must be recog-
nised as a major factor in this
connection.
"Provisional tax is a pernicious
tax on people of widely fluctuat-
ing incomes. At present it is
causing embarrassment to many
in that while their production has
been high, they find difficulty in
arranging carry-on finance be-
cause of the pay-in-advance
method that this tax demands.
Referring to primary industries,
it has been the custom to my
knowledge for 50 years for pro-
ducers to obtain finance against
the coming year’s production.
This custom has been in exist-
ence, I believe, since Australia
was founded.
"Provisional tax also makes
claims against this production,
whether it be wool, meat, wheat,
or other primary products, and
here is the justifiable cause of
the protests we hear so much of
from producers. It was ill-con-
ceived in 1944, and it is hoped
that Government will gradually
eliminate this method of taxation.
“May I say that our Common-
wealth Government is to be com-
mended for its courageous effort
to stem the inflationary trend, as
otherwise it appeared we were
heading for chaos.
“That there are and will be
many difficulties in the path there
is no doubt, but success will de-
pend to a considerable degree
upon the willingness of all sec-
tions of the community to face
the inevitable readjustment that
must take effect.
“There is no doubt that in the
long-term view for Australia
there are sound grounds for
optimism, but the short-term
aspect demands that the situation
concerning costs in industry must
be met and dealt with.
“That there are commendable
avenues for expenditure in Aus-
tralia of large sums of money for
hydro-electric power —also for
transport and for irrigation—
there is no doubt, but considera-
tion must be given to the amount
of money required and to its
availability.
“In recent years the expression
‘Money doesn’t count has not
been an uncommon one in Aus-
tralia, but I think most of us have
found in our experience that
money always does count in the
long run.
RESERVES:
"The necessity for reserves in
industry has never been more
clearly demonstrated than at
present. Your directors have en-
deavored to make all possible
provision for contingencies from
year to year to ensure the stabil-
ity of your company, and I am
sure they have your approval in
this effort.
BRANCHES:
“Our branches now number
45, additions since our last re-
port being Wangaratta, Morn-
ington and Rushworth. These
should fit in well with our spread
of branches through Riverina and
Victoria, and we look forward to
seeing them valuable adjuncts to
the company’s business.
STAFF:
“I should like, on behalf of the
board of directors, to express
thanks to all members of the staff
for the conscientious and efficient
manner in which the company i
business has been handled during
the past year.”
MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
The Exchange Crisis
Since Maorilanders began to
wake-up to the realities of their
exchange plight, it has dawned
on them slowly that there’s a
long lean time ahead. Things
have turned out very differently
from what they were encouraged
to believe when they heard the
first soothing words from Prime
Minister Sid Holland back at
the end of February, when Aus-
tralia was running head-on into
a first-class crisis. Said the P.M.
then: “We may have to intro-
duce one or two restrictions, but
they won’t hurt anybody sub-
stantially. Anything we have to
do in that direction will be of a
very temporary nature.”
Less than a fortnight later, on
March 11, came the first hint that
trouble was blowing up. Motor-
cars were brought under import-
control immediately. But the
sky was still fairly clear.
Three weeks later the storm
broke. The Reserve Bank, v/ith
its exchange reserves draining
away —it had then only £stg22
million half-stunned traders
with a cut to 80 p.c. of 1950
purchases, and there was a howl
of protest. Importers have been
moaning or growling more or
less ever since, and have been
demanding to know how long
they’ll have to put up with this.
No one can answer that one, but
the wise-heads are forecasting a
couple of years, at least.
This looks like eternity to the
prophets of gloom, and no doubt
it will be a long hard row. Still,
it shouldn’t be as bad as many
Maorilanders have tried to make
out. What with stores and ware-
houses stuffed with goods, and
more in the pipeline still to
arrive, N.Z. has a pretty fair
start. From now on it’s a case
of living within a smaller income,
but one that’s still high by all
but wool-boom standards.
There’s still a long way to go
before the country feels anything
like the pinch of hard times of
the early ’thirties, or even the
austerity of the first post-war
years. It has had its spending
spree and will have to come
down to earth, that’s all. There’s
a big backlog of orders to be
worked off.
Some sections of trade and
industry have taken a lot of
knocks, some of them a bit
below the belt, due to dumping,
and there’s a feeling that busi-
ness has got involved in foul
play, but that’s only one side of
the picture. Costs have been
pushing through the roof after
a long spell of inflation and
controls, which haven’t all been
relaxed yet, and this doesn’t help
in shaping up to competition
again. The day of reckoning
will not be easy, but there should
be enough prosperity left when
it’s all over.
Maoriland, like Australia, has
grown soft and will have to
toughen up. A spur here and
there should do more good than
harm. The stock position and
the outlook aren’t black. At
worst, they’re grey, in patches.
It might take well over a year
to digest what’s on the plate, not
to mention what’s coming up.
Supplies and orders have run that
far ahead of funds and needs.
It’s possible, though, that
when everything is straightened
out, N.Z. will find it hasn’t had
the best value for its money, and
stocks have got out of balance,
with a surplus of non-essentials
and shortage of necessaries,
which wouldn’t be surprising
under a patchwork of controlled
and uncontrolled prices. Trade
has gravitated into channels
that yield best profits. Strange
if it didn’t. Price-control can
be thanked for that. Traders
have been kicking hard against
price-fixing since competition
got into the saddle again ; there’s
no room for both, they say.
New Zealand is determined,
from the Reserve Bank down-
wards, to honor all contracts
entered into abroad up to the
bank’s deadline date, April 1,
and thus preserve its good name.
To do this it will have to declare
an extended holiday on new
orders. However, in the long
run, everything should work out
much the same as if Maoriland
placed orders steadily as it went
along. Having got into a jam
this is how it will have to get
out of it.
Maoriland Newsprint
While Maoriland is going
through long birth-pangs in its
efforts to launch a newsprint
venture to turn its softwood
forests into wealth, the big
hurdle seems to be dollars. On
May 26 Prime Minister Holland
announced formal registration of
the Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.,
and said “1 am in no doubt
whatever that we shall be able
to raise the money we re-
quire.” If N.Z. must have
dollars there’s no agreement on
how it should get them —from
the World Bank, or through
other channels, if it could. Of
course, it would have to join the
bank first if it looked for funds
there, and the 1.M.F., too, which
would be the main bugbear for
most Maorilanders. If the news-
print scheme doesn’t help N.Z.
to make up its mind nothing
will, for there’s no need so
urgent and no project equally
alluring there today.
Said Edward Anderson, ex-
chairman of N.Z. Newspapers,
Ltd., in mid-May: “The best
hope of freeing ourselves per-
manently from shortage of news-
print appears to be in the estab-
lishment of a local newsprint
mill, but it is discouraging to
realise that seven years after the
end of the war there should be
no sign of immediate improve-
ment. Much news and many
advertisements must be excluded
until some solution is found to
this shortage which has been
with us for so long It is too
early to make a definite fore-
cast, but it is hoped that means
will be found whereby we can
play our part in establishing a
mill in which we will have such
a vital interest. The advantages
of certainty in the supply of
newsprint, provided it is of good
quality and economic in price,
will be great indeed. Nor will
the benefits be confined to the
newspapers, for this industry
should add considerably to the
prosperity of the Dominion.”
Exchange Loopholes
Not content to live strictly
within current export income,
although that is what they’re
aiming at officially, Maorilanders
have begun cashing in on private
overseas assets again, and are
using the proceeds to buy luxury
and semi-luxury goods, jewel-
lery, and anything that shows a
handsome profit. ?
They call it “no-remittance
buying, because the banks aren t
brought into the business. The
funds are outside the exchange
pool. To get their hands on this
brand of sterling, New Zealand
traders buy convertible securities
at a premium on their local stock
exchanges and dispose of them
at a discount in London. They
might lose anywhere from 10
per cent, upwards in the transfer,
but they hope to recoup them-
selves, and earn a good profit
to boot, on the things they buy.
A couple of years ago they
served an apprenticeship in this
form of dealing when the Gov-
ernment gave them the all-clear
to buy motor-cars, refrigerators,
washing-machines and a few
other selected lines if they could
pay for them without dipping
into exchange funds. In the last
half of 1950 millions were spent
this way. It was a sizeable dip
into the country’s precious ex-
ternal reserves, and there is that
much less to draw on now.
Current income could be
diverted to help make up, and
experience last time showed that
earnings abroad could be held
out of reach of the banks. Most
sinister, the banks could be bled
for funds by various dubious
practices. For instance, some
operators got the bright idea of
charging a bit more than cost
for imports, or were persuaded
to do this by agents or represen-
tatives in New Zealand, and the
upshot of it was that there was a
leakage of funds to be applied
for uses for which they were not
granted.


Society
AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS
“Northerner”: When the wharfies
came along for the first day’s unloading of
timber from a Chinese LST at Darwin
they brought with them a refrigerator,
tables and chairs, and a quantity of
“plonk.” At the wharf they discovered
that part of the ramp had to be replaced,
having been washed out by the spring
tides. This not being wharfies’ work, they
sat about and guzzled till the work was
done; which took more than half a
day. Then the combination of plonk
and tobacco and leisure led to a demand
for sanitary accommodation. The
wharfies were offered the use of the
sanitary accommodation aboard the LST,
but declined that; it having been used
by Chinese, they considered it was
not suitable for true-blue Aussies. They
were offered the use of sanitary accom-
modation at a private residence, about
100yds. from the ship, but declined that
also; it was much too far for a wharfie
to walk. Things were at an impasse, and
the wharfies announced their intention to
go on strike; but finally a portable toilet
was brought down and placed in a satis-
factory position. Then it was discovered
that knock-off time had come, so the
gang filed off homewards.
* * * *
“Melb’n”: Melbourne’s most unusual
racket is a gang of roof-repairers. Head
of the gang approaches the householder,
invariably an elderly lady, and tells her
the lid of her dwelling badly needs repair-
ing. His two assistants then climb on the
roof, inspect it, descend, and the boss
gives an estimate, collecting the money
in advance. That is the last the old lady
sees of them, but when she gets someone
to re-examine the roof they usually find
one of the tiles decorated with noughts
and crosses. The latest victim was
mulcted of £lO2.
* * * *
“Cauboy”; A feminine newspaper cor-
respondent in Melbourne came back very
neatly on the men when she asked the
authorities concerned to see that no men
were admitted to this year’s levee in
honor of the Queen’s birthday on the
perfectly logical grounds that no women
were allowed at King’s birthday levees
because of the ancient custom of holding
levees in the royal bedroom. This recalls
the time when Victoria’s first woman
Parliamentarian demanded admission to a
levee on the ground that as an M.P. she
was officially a gentleman. There was a
frantic rush of officialdom to look up the
records, but nothing could be found in
the Constitution to contradict her, so she
was admitted, carrying a substantial
brolly.
“Ahreno”: Ex-p.-0.-w. of the Nips
were embarking at Manila in the aircraft-
carrier Inimitable. At the top of the
gangway that led up from the pontoon to
the ship some of the ship’s officers were
watching proceedings, among them the
paymaster-commander responsible for the
food and cooking in the ship. As they
watched, a man, clad in shorts and
sandals, carrying a large kitbag, began to
come up the gangway. His stick-like arms
and legs, his skin drawn tight across pro-
truding ribs, drew bitter comment from
“Pay” about the Nips and their treat-
ment of our men. The man staggered
to the top of the gangway, almost fell
on to the deck, dropped the kitbag from
his shoulder and stood panting for breath.
Feeling sorry for the man, “Pay” went
over to him, patted him gently on the
shoulder and said, “There, there, don’t
worry. We’ll soon fatten you up.” A
puzzled look came upon the man’s face
as he struggled for words. Then his
reply came, “Abart time, Sir, I bin aboard
this ship two years.”
“What about some new stockings. Pop?"
“E. & 0.E.”: Best Australian example
of a Chinese joss-house (B. 7/5/’52) is
probably to be found at the Victoria
Museum, Launceston (Tas.); it was either
built or imported for the use of the once-
numerous Chinese miners at Weldborough
(n.-e. coast). When these men drifted
away the joss-house was abandoned, and
to save it from complete ruin the leader
of the Chinese community in Launceston
agreed that the museum should house it—
if Joss would consent to the move. He
went himself to consult the oracle, and
returned beaming, to announce that Joss
“We really MUST get a tea-strainer.”
was willing to go. So there he lives,
surrounded by everything a Joss could
wish for ; candlesticks (rather superseded
by electric-bulbs inside lovely old
lanterns), joss-sticks, peacock-feathers,
embroidered hangings and canopies ;
utensils for eating, drinking and smoking.
His rocking-horse waits patiently at one
side till the time arrives for their midnight
rides together. A group of figurines about
2ft. high (apparently courtiers) stand
on one side, and outside the house
are 14 more figurines showing the tradi-
tional types of theatrical players. Alto-
gether a fine show, which has been much
added to by the local Chinese, and is kept
in first-class order.

“Irving”: In marked contrast to the
pleasure with which “Pawang” (B.
14/5/’52) found that he could read after
doffing his customary glasses was the
emotion with which 50-odd Torres Straits
Binghis found that they could not read
after they had donned their unaccustomed
spectacles. The glasses, which were a
job lot with lenses of varying powers,
were rushed when they were opened up at
the trading-station, but the traditional
fury of the woman scorned was mild
compared to the frenzy of the colored
customers who found that, even with the
aid of the spectacles, they were no more
able to decipher the letterpress of a news-
paper than they had been in their com-
pletely illiterate state of a few seconds
earher. Much goodwill was lost before
it could be explained to them that the
spectacles which the white misshnary
donned every Sabbath before he read the
lesson were props to failing eyesight and
not magical aids to literacy.

Uramao ; When a big fire in

of business premises and sen half a

would oblige by settlmgtheir accounts in
the absence of any claim, as all the

The Press announced that this appeal

afforded the sufferers of the fire much
gratification at the honesty displayed.
Even so, there was cause for a voiced
complaint on the mercilessness of the
fire. It had destroyed all the splendid

Taxation Department with its merciless

“Becks”: Archbishop Mowll’s sugges-
tion that “Black Australians” might be
a better name than aborigines for our
colored people is no doubt well-meant,
but it is not likely that its adoption would
have the effect his Lordship hopes for —
of helping Brown Brother to lose his sense
of inferiority towards the whites. If
anything the effect would rather be in
the opposite direction. One aboriginal
Australian who has proved himself
capable of holding his own in any com-
pany has already turned down the sug-
gestion. He is the Rev. Doug. Nicholls,
of Melbourne, whose attitude is “We
prefer ‘aborigine’ or ‘native.’ ” There’s
nothing insulting in the term aborigine,
which, after all, is merely a Latin phrase
ah origine, meaning “from the beginning.”
Binghi has to all intents and purposes
been here “from the beginning.” If any
distinction is to be made among brands
of Aussie he might fairly ask that he be
labelled Australian and the Johnny-come-
latelies of 1788 onwards distinguished
from him by the appellation “White Aus-
tralians,”

“B. A. Ker”: Pakistan’s decision to
adopt the swastika as a national emblem,
it being an ancient Eastern symbol, may
not be good news to a suburban house-
holder out my way. Hitler was still
papering parlors when his house was
built, so the swastika worked in the front
gable could have meant nothing more
subversive than its original good-luck
message. But when the crooked cross
was at its highest—and lowest—point,
that swastika stuck out like a thumb in
plaster, and was darn near as irritating.
If the occupant didn’t feel guilty every
time he entered his own gate he must
have been singularly insular. And now,
if Pakistan ever gets into strife, he’s for
it again. The moral seems to be: If you
must have plasterer’s handiwork in your
gable, imitate another houseowner in my
suburb: call your home “The Anchor-
age,” and have an anchor for the motif,
The worst you can be called then is a
“stick-in-the-mud.”

THE BLUE-TAILED FLY.
A Folksong of Sydney Town.
“The visit of the American folksong singer,
Burl Ives, has coincided with happenings in the
Swilliam household which seemed worthy of cele-
bration in this medium. ‘A folksong,’ says Swilliam,
‘is more properly a song sung by one’s forefathers,
but, as Napoleon said when lineage was being can-
vassed: “Me —I am an ancestor!”’”
The day we dyed our carpet blue
And it was sodden through and through
A black fly settled down to pry
And flew away a blue-tailed fly.
Jimmy-crack-corn, and did we swear!
Jimmy-crack-corn, and did we swear I
Jimmy-crack-corn, and did we swear:
“The ’s got away I”
And soon a blue, uneven line
Appeared upon the kalsomine
Of wall and ceiling, ’way up high—
A message from the blue-tailed fly.
Then Inky Smith, our old black cat,
Jumped nimbly off the wet blue mat
On our new armchair, to get nigh
That wicked, wicked blue-tailed fly.
His paws made new designs between
Flowers of red and leaves of green;
He roo-ined our new tap-es-try
A-glaring at that blue-tailed fly.
The kids chased after Inky Smith
To give him somep’n-to-go-on-w/f/z.
But Inky Smith was just as spry,
Or nearly, as that blue-tailed fly.
Old Inky jumped, as stamp to pad.
From furnishings to mat like mad
Till Mrs. Swill, began to cry,
“He’s worser than the blue-tailed fly!”
With this, she fetched the kids a smack
That left them rather blue than black,
And Poppa Swilliam shouted, “I
’ll exterminate that blue-tailed fly!”
He took, without another word.
The pot where all the dye was stirred
And sloshed it up like liquid sky
To drown the dreadful blue-tailed fly.
And then a sort of dismal gloom
Descended on our living-room
Till Mrs. Swill, said, “Buy more dye—
We’ll emulate the blue-tailed fly!”
So now our room’s completely blue,
And we are Blue Australians, too,
And if a stranger wonders why,
We say, “You ask the blue-tailed fly:
“ Jimmy-crack-corn, and did we swear!
Jimmy-crack-corn, and did we swear !
Jimmy-crack-corn, and did we swear:
The got away!”

“Percy Pawnticket”; As Solomon sings,
“How beautiful upon the mountains is
the feel of the morning”—and when that
morning is frosty how beautiful is the
smell of hot coffee and of bacon frying.
Almost as beautiful is the sizzle of fat
that suggests the cooking of sausages. I
wonder that the boardinghouse that pro-
vides me with these waking pleasures
does not charge extra for them on the
bill; the Taxation Department, if it knew
of them, would certainly charge amuse-
ment tax. After pulling the warm
blankets around me for a time to enjoy
contemplation of the culinary delights
awaiting me, I arise with a burst of song,
thrown, as it were, into the face of the
bleak weather as a defiance, warmed to
the heart by the suggestive odors. And
then I descend to the dining-room and
order steak and eggs to follow my cereal
and tea to come at the end. That is the
strange thing; although the aroma of
coffee delights me, I much prefer tea for
drinking; and, delightful as is the scent
of bacon and sausages to my nostrils, I
seldom eat them from choice.

“Glen”: When Mrs. Miller, the first
woman to be elected to the Hobart City
Council, was being issued her tram-pass
she was asked if she required an alder-
man’s pass or a wife’s pass. She naturally
said she was entitled to an alderman’s
pass. The question then arose as to what
sort of pass a husband was entitled to.
The pass designed for the other half of
an alderman is an attractive gold brooch.

“Macnell”: It is a long time since a
British warship ran away from enemy
guns. Australian destroyer Warramunga
did, the other day off north-east Korea —
but deliberately, under peculiar circum-
stances, and with satisfying results. Hay-
ing lathered a railway-bridge, torn up its
lines and bombarded targets at the south
end of Chongjin Bay, the chunky
destroyer stopped engines to turn in close
waters before retiring. As she lay stopped,
five unsuspected Communist shore-guns
opened up, straddling her. At once Com-
mander Ramsay ordered full-speed astern,
at the same time ordering open fire.
Warramunga’s twin 4.7-inchers let go over
the bows. In normal action, a ship’s own
and enemy speeds are set on her fire-
control table, so that her shells will lob at
the spot where the target will be after
perhaps 10 seconds’ time-of-flight. Warra-
muuga’s gunners solved the unusual
problem —of having a stationary
target apparently moving away from them
—well enough ; she silenced three of the
five guns. Later, joined by a U.S.
destroyer, the Australian returned,
steaming the right way, and laced the
whole area.

“Dentonio”; If an item in a cartoon
strip, on the lines of Ripley’s “Believe It
or Not,” but devoted to events in Aus-
tralian history, was based on authentic
matter, those Currency Lads mentioned
by “Ek Dum” as fighting at Waterloo
were not the first Australian-born to be
traced into major battle (B. 30/4/’52).
The strip depicted an Australian abo-
riginal in the dress of a British Naval
captain of the Nelson era. The story
credited him with fighting on the Victory
at Trafalgar, and acquitting himself so
well that after the battle he was pro-
moted captain of the maintop—the artist
obviously thought this entitled him to
post-captain’s uniform. According to
Carola Oman’s Nelson, about 200
members of Victory’s crew were non-
British ; they included Americans, French-
men, Spaniards, Germans, Italians and
negroes. No mention is made of
any abos, but it would not be
impossible for a genuine Australian
native to have fought at Trafalgar. He
could have shipped on board a whaler
and so reached England, or been pressed
into a King’s ship on the high seas.

“Sam”: South Africa, after the Boer
War, wasn’t the only country where
Australians got a bad name through
being too strongly represented by criminal
and tough elements (B, 30/5/’52). It
was the same in California during the
gold boom of the 1850’s. Many Sydney-
siders went there, including a number
of ex-convicts. The “wild colonial boys”
found California an easier field for profit-
able rascality than their homeland —
until the vigilantes got busy. The
“Sydney Ducks” earned an unsavory
reputation that proved embarrassing to
their decent compatriots.

“Minto”: When A. W. Coles took on
his Olympic Games job he was asked
about the effect of the task on his health.
“I don’t get ulcers —I give them!” he
replied. It reminds me of Higgins, the
aggressive American manufacturer. After
a party of visitors had looked over his
industrial empire one of them asked how
he’d like it if the Communists took con-
trol of affairs. “I’d love it,” replied
Higgins. “I’d be a Commissar! ”
* * * *
“Clooter”: A controversy that looks
like being with us for a long time flared
up again in Victoria when a Dutch
woman schoolteacher on a visit said Aus-
tralian mothers shouldn’t tolerate their
offspring being caned at school. As one
who, up to his ’teens, attended several
different State and denominational
schools, and who doesn’t believe that
boys’ natures are different now from what
they were, or teachers’ natures cither, I
hold that some boys just don’t understand
any other form of discipline than that
derived either from “the cuts” or from
the knowledge that “the cuts” will be
applied if considered necessary. Not so
long ago I was listening to a second-year
high-school youth retailing to his father
with a mixture of mirth and contempt the
way his class treated a man teacher who
believed in moral suasion or whatever
they call it. The father listened, then
remarked “By cripes, some of you kids
would wonder what hit you if I was run-
ning your class.” The boy replied, quite
seriously, “Ah, but with you, Dad, we’d
know better than to play up.” And that
just about sums up one aspect of the
matter.

“Wiremu”: During my 70 years of
field-surveying I often saw the Brocken
Spectre (B. 7/5/’52). Usually seen on
the top of some bare mountain it seemed
to be caused by the sun’s rays filtering
through rarefied fog and delineating the
observer’s image. Usually one saw only
“Now do you see why Mother doesn't like you playing with matches?
his own image and not his companion’s,
and there was undoubtedly a halo around
mine. This phenomenon was no doubt
responsible for the Maori belief in the
mountain fairies, the Patupaiarehe, who
were only seen in misty weather on the
hilltops. These, according to the Maori,
were the disembodied spirits of the earlier
inhabitants whom they supplanted. At
times their songs were heard; strangely
only one line at a time could be
memorised, but diligent attention eventu-
ally enabled the whole to be collected,
“I'd rather have a painting of you than a model, John.”
One translated and sung to me was a
lament for their lost homes.

“Mark O’Polo”: Between every second
and third tree along Melbourne’s
St. Kilda-road there is a street-light, an
ordinary electric-lamp, of no exceptional
brilliance, and now, with autumn’s bleak
fingers stripping the trees, here is the
question that asks to be answered at this
time every year: What causes them to be
the last by many days to fall, those leaves
clustered nearest the lights? Whatever
causes this lingering seems to have an
effective radius of up to Bft. from the
municipal bulb, which seems to rule out
warmth as the stimulant to leaf longevity.
Is it some other quality of the radiation?
♦ * * *
“Minto”: At an R.A.A.F. depot in
Queensland losers of issue-blankets
were being docked £1 55.; so a
couple of airmen drove to Brisbane and
bought a lorryful of blankets for ss.
each, doing a roaring trade with them
back at the depot at 10s. each. Thus
R.A.A.F. got its blankets back, the
disposals store got its profit, the airmen
entrepreneurs made ss. a time, and the
departing, blanket-losing airaien were
saved 15s. each. I’m still trying to work
out who lost on the deal.
£ * * *
“Vingter”: A queer mental twist made
the Japs easy meat for Allied Intelli-
gence. The U.S. Navy broke their code
before Pearl Harbor. At Milne Bay the
Japs chose to exterminate their marines by
fighting them down the only 12 miles
which was defended, whereas they could
have landed almost unopposed near
their objective, the airdrome ; then
reconnaissance and strafing planes
had been over the bay almost
daily for three weeks before the
invasion. A bespectacled little captain
picked up on a raft three days after the
Bismarck Sea massacre had to be forcibly
detached from a satchel which held the
entire Order of Battle of the Japanese
Army and the posting of every officet
in the Imperial Army—it had not occurred
to the captain to destroy the satchel during
his three-day drift. An Australian
lieutenant was killed on a mission to hang
lights in the Jap-held Nassau Bay area
that would direct an American landing-
force. Another patrol hung the lights.
But the dead lieutenant had been carry-
ing maps showing the disposition of
Australian forces. Nevertheless, the
Nassau Bay operation went according to
plan, Allied Command finding its missing
maps afterwards in the pack of a dead
Japanese private. He had obviously
regarded them as souvenirs; it had never
occurred to him to hand them over to his
Intelligence officers.
* * * *
“Pontius Penwiper”: What used to be
“comic” strips have found new worlds
to conquer ; they have long been done
into books with fabulous sales; “swap-
ping comics” is now a most enthusiastic
pursuit of lads who can’t afford one each
of the 130 a publisher tells me are put
out at a time. Now the action-picture
novelette has arrived; well-dressed and
almost-intelligent-looking women are to
be seen looking through them with the
evident thought that they are “reading.”
Youngsters claimed that they had “read”
Treasure Island, A Christmas Carol and
Gulliver’s Travels after looking through
these picture-versions ; in their adulthood
they will have an inclination to continue
their reading in this style. Naturally, pub-
lishers have jumped in to supply the new
market. There will be more and more
people who, though not illiterate, will not
know what real reading is.
* * * *
“P.0.M.C.”: They entered the tram
together, colliding heavily. The elderly
big man casually apologised in a deep,
accented voice. The boyish small man,
plainly disgruntled, snarled: “Another
damn’ clumsy New Australian” as he
slumped into a seat. “You don’t mean
that, do you, sonny?” the big man asked
genially. “Too right I do,” snapped the
little man. “Well, listen,” drawled the
big man, a dinkum Australian lately
returned from a long spell abroad. “I
fought for Australia ten years before you
were born, and if you’ll step out on the
road I’ll show you how it was done.”
* * * ♦
“Ex-C.G.”: Among lost and forgotten
goods up for sale at a Melbourne auction
of unclaimed property accumulated in
railway-stations were four swags. I
don’t know who bought them or what
they paid, but I hope nobody fell in like
an acquaintance of mine some years ago.
At a similar sale he saw one of the largest
swags he’d ever seen. So did several other
people. All concluded it must be worth
buying. My man had to bid to £3 9s. to
get it. Despite its size it felt a bit light.
No wonder. It consisted of a single grey
blanket rolled round an empty oil-drum.
How that came about is anybody’s guess,
though a back-country theory would be
that the owner carried it to persuade
likely employers that he wasn’t a loafer—
for in the country in those times a man
was judged by the size of his swag.
PLEASANT SOLUTION.
“An expert has warned that a mother C£n warp
a child’s personality by propping its milk-bottle
up and letting it drink by itself.
He has no teeth or hair,
He can’t say what he thinks,
But what does baby care?
He gets no mental kinks _ .
Because, all on his own, his toe he nibbles.
He’ll stare for nigh an hour
At something near his cot,
But does that make him sour /
He rather likes a spot
Of meditative,, solitary dribbles.
He’ll never go on strike,
Or vent his infant wrath
To show his strong dislike
Of taking solo bath;
That ritual’s the least of all his troubles.
For why, he well may ask.
Would there be any need
For company for the task
If task it be, indeed—
Of slapping so ecstatically at bubbles/
But babes are of an ilk,
They all react as one.
When left to soak up milk
Alone. They get no fun
From individual, isolated guzzling.
Their personalities
Might get a nasty twist.
Mum’s nose they’ll cruelly seize
While being fondly kissed.
The reason for all this is rather puzzling.
Don’t let your babe imbibe
All on his pat, or soon
He’ll hunt you with a gibe,
Or dong you with his spoon.
The practice, too, could drive him on to arson.
So cross-grained he’ll become,
So wicked the effect
Upon his cranium
That later you’ll expect
To hear he’s slung a hunger at the parson.
So, Dad, let us be frank.
Your solo-drinking mite
May grow up quite a crank,
Like those you sometimes sight
In pubs, drinking with flies. Ah! It’s too risky
To chance! Just take a tip:
When baby’s bottle’s full
Give him companionship
And keep him affable
By getting yours out too —that is, the whisky.

You may say you’ve taken every precaution
against ordinary fire hazards. That you can
depend upon ‘fireproof’ construction.
Aren’t you over-confident? Human negli-
gence in one way or another continues to
be the greatest cause of fire. So-called ‘fire-
proof’ buildings continue to become furnaces
for inflammable contents.
What most people ignore is that, regard-
less of the cause of fire, regardless of the
building construction, it is the proper control
of fi re from the first spark that, constitutes
full and adequate protection against fire.
Grinnell is on guard 24 hours a day. It
kills fire, automatically, at its source.
You’re paying for Grinnell Protection —•
even if you haven’t got it. Insurance com-
panies allow a rebate of up to 50% on Fire

For
Woods' Great Peppermint Cure.
Robson noticed at once the
other’s face; the ingratiating
smile he always used (don’t
worry, sir—l know me onions,
and anything you don’t know,
just rely on me) slipped from his
own dial. The surgeon faced
him, his voice a rasp.
“Yes?”
“ ’Scuse me, sir. Been lookin’
all over for you.” The grin came
back. “With the ship rollin’,
thought you might have”
“What do you want?”
What’s wrong with the silly
young newt? Couldn’t have
heard me up there. Ah, yes—
knows I know he’s seasick.
That’s it.
“It’s Collins, sir. Looks pretty
bad. Says the pain’s worse —
much worse. He’s sweatin’ with
it. Will you have a look at him?”
A sharp, instant certainty
replaced the surgeon’s rancor,
More than this training, it was
the subconscious realisation that
here, now, he was the one man
in the ship to handle the crisis,
He waved Robson out.
The seaboat’s crew of the
watch on deck looked with
interest on the sickbay-attendant
and doctor hurrying forward
between bursts. As they bunched
back from the fo’c’sle ladder to
the sickbay, one whispered:
“What’s doin’, Robby?”
“Collins. Not too good.”
Then the two were up the
ladder, clinging as she pitched.
The boat’s crew’s eyes
followed, on each face a respect
that would have done the
surgeon’s heart good to see.
Sailors respect a science they
don’t understand, whether it is
navigation or ship-handling. The
young surgeon now was not
merely an officer, green or other-
wise. He was the only man in
the ship who could help their
shipmate. Land was somewhere
hundreds of miles astern; the
nearest warship was in Japan.
And sailors, of all fighting men,
are a sentimental lot.
On the fo’c’sle the ship’s
movement was even more
violent. She lifted with a breath-
taking leap which left your
stomach at your hoots, and
slammed down so that it seemed
to fly up through your throat,
leaving a void filled only with
nervous tension. Then came
the shuddering roll as she met
the next watery wall, only to rise
on it in a repeat of the same
endless, hellish motion.
If only he could quell this
sickening dizziness! Robson
led him through the white-
enamelled passage-way easily.
swaying with practised facility to
her movement. The surgeon
clawed his way behind him, his
legs airy and useless as she fell,
leaden and stiff with his body-
weight when she lifted.
Robson was fumbling at the
sickbay door, waiting for her to
bury her snout before he slid it
forward. Then the surgeon
realised, with a cold douche of
shock, what the sight of his pea-
green, useless face would tell the
stricken figure rolling in the sick-
bay bunk. The surgeon creased
his salt-caked cheeks in a pre-
liminary grin—he would not
soon forget the effort it cost
him; nor the almost instant feel-
ing of relief it afforded his sick
head and stomach. Unknow-
ingly, he had applied to himself
the one sure remedy for seasick-
ness —occupation of the mind in
a strenuous effort.
j T was obvious Collins was
! seriously ill. The last vestiges
of seasickness left the surgeon
as he took in the symptoms. He
bent over Collins. A runnel ran
over his chin. His tongue was
dirty, coated white, and his
breath was heavy. The surgeon
shifted to the abdomen —nere
was the miracle. The ship was a
complicated fighting machine,
every piece of steel designed to
further its purpose of fighting.
Yet, unless actuated by its crew,
inanimate, useless, a mere heap
of iron. But on the patient’s
stomach the marvel of nature,
involuntarily, had drawn a
resistant, protective dome of
rigid muscles over the affected
appendix. To the surgeon’s
questing fingers they shouted
their warning.
Coming upright from Collins’s
stomach, the surgeon met the
other’s eyes —wrinkled in pain,
and, though he was not sure,
fright. The surgeon spoke
decisively. “Like,” Robson
thought, “the bloody captain.”
“I won’t put anything over
you, Collins. You’re in pretty
bad shape. What I can’t under-
stand is why you haven’t noticed
pain much earlier—before we
left Sydney.”
The sick man answered at
once and frankly—his own
torture, even without the doctor’s
confirmation, told him of his
danger.
“I did, sir,” he whispered, so
that the surgeon bent to hear
him over the rush of water out-
side. “Week before we left—
bad then, and it’s been naggin’
me for weeks. Thought I just
had a sort of gutsache—been
ashore a fair bit, on it most of
the time, Y’ see, I didn’t want
to miss the trip away.”
The surgeon turned to
Robson,
“Keep him warm. Set up a
glucose-saline intravenous drip
—and inject a little pentothal
through the tubing. I’ll be on
the bridge. Soon as you’ve pre-
pared the drip—get the sickbay
ready for operation.”
It was out. Effortlessly, no
shadow of a doubt the
decision part of his dizzy brain
had been avoiding all the way
along the heaving deck from the
wardroom. But the surgeon
thought nothing of this, nor even
of the jerking and screwing that
forced him to pull himself up
the bridge-ladder by his hands.
There was no place in his mind
now for anything but his coming
job anaesthetic, sterilisation,
assistants (he’d need at least
three, and Robson was his only
trained theatre-assistant), and,
above all, the urgent need for
speed. A muscular contraction,
a roll of the ship, a cough, could
rupture that rotten sac of
bacilli,
THE cold, vociferous dark
was lightened by the
occasional whip of a white wave-
top racing astern. The surgeon
took a lather of spray full in his
face as he scrambled on to the
bridge. Leaning against a voice-
pipe, wiping his eyes, he made
out the tall, spare figure of the
captain leaning and swaying
beside the officer-of-the-watch
near the binnacle. Both men
were staring silently into the
night ahead, and both turned as
they felt his feet on the raised
wooden grating.
“Hullo, Doc.” The captain
grinned. “Up for a spot of
freshers? You’ll need a coat.”
As his mouth opened to reply,
the surgeon relished the full
drama content of the bomb-
shell he was about to drop.
“I won’t be long, sir. It’s
about Collins. He’s bad —
peritonitis—or all but. I’ll have
to operate.”
The officer-of-the-watch ejacu-
lated: “Hell!” The captain
peered keenly into the surgeon’s
face. He spoke at once.
“All right, Doc. Tell the first-
lieutenant what men you want.
I’ll make her as easy as possible.
Good luck.”
The surgeon stepped back.
He was to remember, after-
wards, warmly, that instant
acceptance by this seasoned sea-
man of his decision.
The captain, for his part, was
long used to making decisions.
And long ago he had decided
about the new young surgeon-
lieutenant sent to him a month
before the ship sailed, during her
refit from the preceding period
up north. A destroyer captain
knows his men like his own
nose, and his quiet study of the
surgeon, at Sunday divisions, on
captain’s Saturday rounds, when
every part of the ship is scoured
to sterile cleanliness, and, above
all, in the wardroom, had con-
vinced him that there, as in the
rest of his command, he had
little to worry about.
He spoke to the officer-of-the-
watch.
“Send for the first-lieutenant.”
A few minutes later Number
One, a short, barrelled, casual
and highly-efficient young man,
limbered his breadth on to the
bridge.
“Sir?”
The captain rolled to the
shelter of the chart-table.
“Doc.’s going to operate on
Collins.”
“Yes, sir.” There was no
surprise in Number One’s
answer ; at once the information
had started a train of thought—
seamanship thought in his mind.
He was a destroyer first-
lieutenant.
The captain hung on to the
port wind-break with one hand.
“Fuel-oil from the heads. Tell
Chief. I’ll reduce speed and
keep her nose into it —easier than
the roll, stern-to. I want you to
help the doc. Pick a couple of
taut hands from the watch
below. Gunner’s mate, I think.”
“Yes, sir. A few oil-soaked
bags from the fo’c’sle might
help. Too rough to trail 'em
from the boom—it’d go.”
“Yes, of course.” Should have
thought of that, the captain
thought to himself. The heads
being abaft the sickbay we’ll
have to have additional oil from
well up forrard. “All right.
Number One —go to it.”
The first-lieutenant paused at
the of the bridge-ladder.
“Bosun’s mate.”
“Sir?”
“Tell the cox’n to relieve the
helmsman on the wheel —and
tell him why.”
“Aye, aye, sir.”
LIKE a breath of wind the
news passed from the bridge
through the ship. No warship
under a battleship was meant for
carrying out surgical operations,
short of extreme emergency.
But no one thought much about
this. There were jobs to do.
Already the chief-engineer had
his stokers pouring the thick,
viscous fuel-oil into lavatory-
pans, flushing the smoothing stuff
outside on to the wild seas. A
shadowy, drenched group on the
fo’c’sle under the chief bosun’s
mate were slinging bags, heavy
with oil, on ropes over the side.
The ship was easier now, lifting
to each swell instead of leaping,
a long, steady motion under the
oil’s smothering influence.
The cox’n stared at his dimly-
lighted compass-card in single-
minded concentration, using
every wrinkle he knew to keep
her steady on-course with a
minimum of side-swing. The
attention of the whole ship’s
company, and, it seemed, the
ship herself, was concentrated
on a quiet, experienced helping
of their shipmate and their
surgeon.
He, too, was working quietly
and efficiently. It had taken
almost an hour to prepare
patient and sickbay. But Robson
knew his job, and felt keenly,
under the eyes of the first-
lieutenant and gunner’s mate, the
importance of it. Collins, under
the pentothal’s influence, was
easier, his arm stretched out side-
ways, the saline dripping evenly
into an opened vein. In the
enclosed sickbay his breath was
marked. Wisps of steam rose
from the steriliser bolted to the
bulkhead ; round Collins on the
collapsible table stood the
surgeon and three white-robed

men, the sailors quiet; deter-
mined, above all, not to betray
their nervousness. Robson
stood by the patient’s head, the
portable little anaesthetic machine
on its traymobile beside him —
there were no anteroom
ments here. The surgeon, his
feet braced wide apart, one hand
on the table steadying him to the
ship’s motion, looked at Robson
and nodded.
The first - lieutenant, as
ordered, had both his hands on
Collins’s right forearm. Collins
was almost under when he
groaned, twisted his face from
the mask, tensed himself, and
in one muscular contraction
almost lifted the first-lieutenant
off the deck. Number One
pressed down, hard. Robson
hastily replaced the mask. The
figure on the table, tensed like
a steel spring, relaxed. The
surgeon waited a moment more.
The only sound in the white
room was the soft swish outside,
and the stertorous whistle of the
expiratory valve of the breathing-
bellows —an unnatural sound as
though Collins was fighting for
breath; actually it was the
music of life.
Over their masks three pairs
of eyes, wide, watched the
surgeon place his left hand on
Collins’s abdomen, stretching the
skin, brown under the iodine.
The knife opened a white
furrow, vivid against the brown.
The red seeped in. Robson
passed a wad of gauze.
On the bridge the captain and
officer -of - the - watch swayed
slowly and in unison beside the
binnacle, its light gleaming on
their faces, running little swords
of light along the wet sou’-
westers. The ship rode on over
the ridged sea, silent except for
the rhythmic creaking of a ship
in a seaway and the sibilant rush
of invisible water down her
sides. Below the bridge, abreast
the whaler, the sea-boat’s crew
talked softly.
The brief space of brown
enclosed by white sterile towels
was almost hidden now by
retractors and artery forceps,
gleaming silver under the big
light. Speaking quietly the
surgeon told Number One of his
needs—forceps, suture, swab ;
forceps again, clipping the
severed arteries, knotting the
oozing ends, with, Number One
noted professionally, a swift
facility the chief bosun’s mate
could hardly equal.
“Muscle retractor. Number
One —the big hooked one there.
Hold it, will you—just a steady
strain to keep it clear.”
SO that was a muscle.
Number One forgot the
vertigo which had threatened to
spin him round by the top of the
head when the knife first cut,
holding the red band of muscle
to one side as the surgeon probed
deeper under the fat-layer.
External oblique muscle, its
internal counterpart, then the
peritoneum. And always the
artery-clipping, the swift knot-
ting, the wound deepening, the
stertorous breathing, accompani-
ment to the rise and fall of the
spring-loaded bellows of the
ether machine, the steady rise
and fall of the ship, and the soft
whoosh of sea sliding wetly
down her sides.
The surgeon was looking at
Number One, unseeingly, his
eyes narrowed, his mouth pursed
in concentration his * index-
finger was out of sight. He said
“Ah,” and carefully brought
something up. They craned
forward—and Robson spoke.
“Doctor, sir—patient’s ears.”
The surgeon darted his eyes to
the ears under the mask. They
were a dark, dusky blue. At that
moment Collins coughed, rest-
lessly. The surgeon spoke
incisively.
“Lighten the anaesthetic.”
Robson leaned over the
machine and slowly pushed a
lever sideways. The surgeon
waited, watching and listening,
one hand steady on the
abdomen. Gradually the regular
whistling resumed, the ears turn-
ing from blue to natural pink.
The surgeon turned again to his
task. He took a little whistling
breath as he looked. The
appendix was a swollen, red
cylinder covered with green
lymph. As he nicked and cut the
mesentery from the purulent
organ, freeing it from its fleshy
anchorage and leaving a slight
ridge along its back like a fish’s
fin, his watchers sensed drama in
the speed with which he worked.
But the drama was over. He
had a purse-string round the
appendix-base, had his forceps
above the catgut, ready to cut.
The organ could burst now —
though inconvenient, it would
not be dangerous. The surgeon
leaned sideways to the kidney-

up his knife, cut cleanly, and

He leaned back from the

smiling with his eyes at the first-

“Just sailmaking from how

piFTEEN MINUTES later
1 surgeon and first-lieutenant
came through the sickbay door.
Both were sweating, the surgeon
with the ’tween-decks heat. A
small group of the watch below
levered themselves up from the
passage bulkheads, on every face
mute inquiry.
“He’ll be all right,” the
surgeon said.
They watched the two figures
disappear into the spray and
dark outside. A weathered three-
badgeman rolled a cigarette.
“For mine,” he grunted as he
deftly licked the paper, “the
doc.’s earned his seasickness.”
The others nodded. Sailors
are a sentimental lot.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: The word had passed
round that Danny Bolt and Hopbush
Kerrigan were looking for each other.
As far as rumor could be sifted down it
seemed that the pair, mates for years in
rabbiting, scrub-cutting, well-sinking,
fencing and similar contracts, had got
into holts over something or other out at
Prungle, that the camp had been wrecked
and each had departed separately for
Euston breathing dire threats. So when
Euston learned that Danny was down at
Shailer’s pub drinking alone, and that
Hopbush was believed to be on the river
behind Medley’s pub, his only company
a bottle of schnapps, ructions were antici-
pated. In the middle of the afternoon an
excited youth dived into Medley’s bar
and announced, “Gripes, ’ere comes
Danny.” The mob rushed on to the
veranda. Up the street from Shailer’s,
alone, silent and grim, Danny walked
steadily, a pick-handle in his fist. And
coming towards him, walking in the
middle of the road, from the courthouse,
came Hopbush, with nothing but his great
hams of fists. Voices died down as the
two closed the gap between them. Over
the road the post-office staff came out
and watched. Even the inevitable dogs
were quiet. Step by step the antagonists
drew nearer, and it was obvious that the
clash must come right in front of the pub.
Breaths were held as eyes watched the
two faces. Then, quite suddenly it
seemed, they stood face to face. Hop-
bush looked at the pick-handle, then at
Danny. “Could y’ do a beer?” he asked.
“My oath,” said Danny fervently. Such
is the mystery of mateship.

“North 5 West”; Having followed a
scientific career, with its ingrained regard
for veracity, I cannot claim, like “Emjai”
(B. 7/5/’52), to have seen ants “nearly
2in. long.” I have a close acquaintance,
however, with the black bullants, which
infest my Melbourne suburban garden.
Recently attempted to dislodge a nest by
flooding with the garden-hose and was
painfully aware that they had attacked
by climbing up the hose onto my hand.
The next day I held the hose-nozzle a
foot or so from the mouth of the nest
and was dumbfounded to find ’em coming
to the attack by climbing up the stream
of water. Wouldn’t have believed it pos-
sible if I’d not seen it with my own eyes!

“Dogai”: Native-style blood-letting as
a remedy (B. 30/4/’52) was practised by
th* “purri-purri” men in the Torres
Straits in the purely superstitious belief
that the evil spirit inhabiting the body
of the patient would be washed out in the
outflow of blood. I once went with a
relief expedition to a T.S. island whence
had come an authentic report that the
population was suffering heavy mortality
through a virulent malarial epidemic. We
found every one of the population scarred
from head to toe according to the blood-
letting prescription of the sorcerer. Our
party’s medicine-man, having only a
Sydney Uni. degree, assigned the high
mortality-rate to sheer loss of blood by
malaria-weakened clients of the Binghi
practitioner. With the “purri-purri” man
clapped in clink the death-rate fell away
overnight, before quinine and atebrin
“Splendid stuff, sir. Kills Woolly-aphis, thrip, cabbage-moth and all
other pests."
could have exerted their curative effects.
On the same island a vigorous young
buck who had been efficiently treated by
a white official for snakebite decided to
make doubly sure by consulting the local
practitioner, who, alarmed that he’d been
called in so belatedly, prescribed an extra
dose of blood-letting. There was no com-
plaint from the patient, whose burial I
attended next day.

K. R. von Stieglitz: Thanks for review-
ing my Tasmanian Bushrangers (R.P.
14/5/’52). By the way, Tasmania invented
the word, and it was first used by our
convivial parson the Rev. Robert Knop-
wood in 1806 ; he wrote it “bush-ranger.”

“J. 8.”: Well, “Burra” seems to have
solved the problem of the tides in Lake
George (B. 14/5/’52), but can he explain
the lake’s erratic behavior? It never
seems able to settle down to being a
lake, its waters appearing and disappear-
ing without any apparent relation to the
seasons. When full, it is 15 miles long by
five across and 24ft. deep, yet its bed has
frequently been used for grazing (fences
still run out into it and vanish under the
water). An international sculling-race
once took place on it, and, for contrast,
its bed wasi used for motor-racing trials.
At one time its eastern edge was con-
sidered among possible sites for
Canberra.

“B. A. Ker”: The laborer on our job
has been boiling the billy with —well, not
exactly the stuff that dreams are made on,
but something like that. It is fuel split off
an old stump which stood near the street
boundary of the building-site. A frag-
rant-smelling, resinous pine, the tree was
once one of many that marked the
perimeter of a fine old home and grounds.
The story goes that in the gold-rush days
a Scottish migrant camped his first night
out from Sydney on a green rise about
200 yards south from the present site of
Merrylands (N.S.W.) railway-station. To
his companion he declared: “If I make
my fortune I’ll build a grand house on
this spot,” He did both. For many years
the commanding building stood in its
spreading acres, but just after World War
I the estate was cut up for cottage allot-
ments ; and in ’37 the historic building
was demolished. However, an old-
fashioned little brick cottage still stands
on what used to be the northern
boundary, and bears a name that tells of
its origin: “The Lodge.” And now I’m
helping to fill up one of the few remain-
ing building-blocks. Queer the way a
little thing like fragrance from a burning
stump can set memory wreathing away
like the blue smoke that spirals up from
under the blackened billy!
* * * *
“Gulliver”: Being a native of the
Riverina I hardly like to decry the mirage
seen by “Emjai’s” stock-buyers out Urana
way (B. 14/5/’52), but it was a pretty
poor effort compared with those we saw
almost every day in the Flinders River
country (N.Q.) in the 1923 drought. What
those miles of open downs gave us was
really worth seeing—and, more’s the pity,
there was no Victorian beer to help the
illusions along. A few miles south of
Marathon siding one morning I could see
the Cloncurry mail standing at the
station ; on the opposite horizon, there
was the same sight, station, engine,
smoke-plume, and all—but everything
was upside-down. Then, when the Iron
Horse took off, it was accompanied by
its own image, also upside-down, with the
rows of wheels touching each other as she
dawdled along. The traditional tree-
fringed lagoon, to break the heart of the
thirsty traveller, was so frequent (and
so realistic) that it was hardly ever com-
mented upon—and, by the way, although
we had 5000 ewes on the track, nearly a
week without water, they never fell for
that illusion. From the Artesian Downs
homestead nearly every morning we had
an excellent view of an unidentifiable
station homestead, just above the
horizon; it was complete with stock-
yards, outbuildings and a grove of trees,
and usually lasted half an hour or so.
Mirages were most frequent in the early
morning, fading as soon as the sun got
well up, although they sometimes
appeared in the late afternoon.

“Yacko”: Allow me to enlighten
“Rooster” (B. 30/4/’52) as to the site of
the pelicans’ haunts mentioned in Capt.
Matthew Flinders’s journal Terra
Australis. Flinders named the spot
Pelican Lagoon in 1802 ; the following
year Baudin, of the French expedition,
labelled it Port Dache. Today it is known
as American River, in commemoration
of the early shipbuilding activities of an
American sealer. Furthermore, to pin-
point the locality, it is an arm of the
sea situated on the north coast of Kan-
garoo Island, S.A. A mere half-mile neck
of sand-dunes separates the head of
American River from the seas of the
south. American River has lately been
declared a bird sanctuary. Yesterday I
watched two groups, making a total of
23 pelicans, flap their way in the direction
they desired, but in countless minute
circles. Why? Were they spying out
schools of fish or seeking direction?

“Long Bob”: Birds certainly have an
intelligent recognition of colors (B.
23/4/’52), as a visit to a spotted bower-
bird’s playground will show. This fowl
collects many different objects—glass,
bones, nails, berries, fruit, etc., and I
have never seen them scattered
haphazardly through the bower. The
purple glass is always in its heap, the
green likewise, and on one occasion 56
spring-head nails were in a neat pile at
one end of the wire-grass structure. The
bones, usually knuckles and vertebras:
from sheep, are always carefully put to-
gether, and in one bower a few dozen
green plums (nearest tree two miles
distant) graced the collection,
* * * ♦
“Nor’-west”: Maybe they did things
better in the cockroach-extermination
line around Broome (B. 23/4/’52), for a
lugger there that had been submerged
only a week was pretty clean when
refloated. Certainly the ’roach can fly,
though observation shows that it doesn't
favor such a means of locomotion if it
can be avoided. And it certainly can’t
swim. So when a lugger, with bilge-
cocks open, began to go under in Roe-
buck Bay the ’roaches, like the ship-
wrecked mariner of old, started to climb
the mast. And there would always be a
couple of the crew handy, armed with
sugar bags with which to belt the insects
down into the sea. What was amazing
then was the congregation of fish, inviting
themselves to the free buffet. In prepara-
tion for this others of the crew would
have lines ready: and as fishing notes
might say—“ Good bags were had by
all.”

“Bud”: “Lesuch” (B. 30/4/’52) couldn’t
have been drinking too much water from

hook when the cable ran out at the wind-
lass. “Then the cable was made fast and
I was retrieved” —surely a new cable 30ft.

“Villefair”: A crib-addict plays the
good old game under some strange con-
ditions, at times. The scoreboard may be
an elaborate inlaid affair or a series of
nailholes punched in a rough piece of
packing-case—that’s if it’s not a long bar
of soap. We once improvised by making
two columns of pencil-marks on a scrap
of paper and ticking them off instead of
pegging. Another bloke conceived the
brilliant idea of counting out 31 matches
each ; when you scored a point you threw
a match back into a mug. But the
queerest game I was ever in earned its
memory because of the casds, not the
board. Our aged host turned his shack
inside-out to muster a “pack.” Some
had green backs, the rest two dif-
ferent patterns in red. The joker was
reduced to the ranks and made an eight
of hearts—-which didn’t make it easier to
read your hand at a glance—and a king
of clubs was branded “Jack of diamonds.”
Still, we were enjoying the game when my
partner led a five ; the next player paired
it. 1 whooped as I made it 15 for eight.
The opposition played the other five —for
12. And that was when my partner
slapped down another five! The argu-
ment was never properly finalised--not
as to how the five fives got into the
pack ; we knew that—but “what would
the pegging be if the fifth five had been
legitimate?” Then, to cap it, the old chap
wanted to know what the score would
have been if one of us had held the four
fives and the other one turned up!

THE DEATH OF DOORUK.
Painting his spear-blade in a red
and white cross-hatching, Ongi said:
Now that the plum-tree’s flowers unfold,
the coming rain-time is foretold
when Dooruk kicks the trees and shakes
the plums in showers down and makes
Jus “duk-duk” drumming. Then the blacks
find, round one tree, the emu’s tracks.
One goes with club and spear by night
and climbs into the boughs. When light
first pales the eastern stars, Dooruk,
listening, comes with low “duk-duk,”
circles the tree and, eager, comes
under the boughs and finds the plums.
Then, hidden in the leaves, the black
stretches and draws the long spear back
and takes his aim. The sharp spear-point
finds out, and cuts in his thigh joint
Dooruk’s sinew. The emu falls
with beating wings and guttural calls.
And now the black leaps from the boughs
and, as the striking head allows,
runs in and clubs behind his eyes
Dooruk, who, before he dies,
rears shuddering; his small wings beat;
convulsed, he falls and shakes his feet.
Here Ongi, down the long spear blade,
his delicate last brush-stroke made.

“The Missus”: Have been watching
our six cats and any others I’ve en-
countered over the past few months and
have come to the conclusion that there is
no such thing as a left-handed cat. Occa-
sionally they may take both paws to
catch or torment a mouse, lizard or frog,
but the right paw is used more than the
left when batting the victim about, and
I’ve never yet seen a cat wash its face
with its left paw —the right is invariably
used.

“Mat’s Mate”: Mat got in a train at
Pakenham (Vic.) and waited for it to take
him further into Gippsland. It went back-
wards towards Melbourne and Mat put
his head out and roared “Whatinell you
think you’re doin’? I don’t mind goin’t’
Melbourne, but I’m blanked if I’m goin’
backwards.” He rushed along the
corridor and dropped to the line, where
a shunter gathered him in and called him
a ruddy fool. “She’s only backin’ out t’
get on the loop t’ let the express
through,” he said, “But the S.M. spotted
y’ an’ if he turns nasty you’ll be up for
a fine.” “Gorblime,” Mat said, “can’t a|
man get off a flamin’ train if he wants t’?*”
“Not when it’s movin’,” the shunter said.
“Here, get up in y’r carriage and I’ll show
y’.” He helped Mat into the carriage and
walked him along the corridor and
showed him a notice which read:
“Persons are warned against joining or
quitting trains while in motion. Penalty
£2.” “Strike me fat,” Mat marvelled, “I
always thought that meant couplin’ or
uncouplin’ trucks an’ was t’ keep shunters
in one piece,” The shunter was still work-
ing this out when the train started, this
time forward, and he ran along the
corridor and dropped off. Mat leaned out
and yelled back at him “Can’t y’ read, y’
dope!”

“Columba”: P’raps I’ve been privileged
to hear him, for the Lamington Plateau
(Q.) is his last retreat, but I’ll back the
rufous scrub-bird against allcomers for
the most far-reaching bird-call. The
natural notes, an earsplitting crescendo
“Chip, chip, chip,” of this tiny chocolate-
brown creature, which can hardly fly but
scuttles about on the leafy rain-forest
floor, could once be heard three miles
away, as any O’Reilly up there will
testify. But Atricornis rufescus is wily,
too, and where paths have been made
through his haunts he no longer calls as
he should be doing this very month, but
in bold and perfect mimicry borrows
from half a dozen other birds of the
scrub.

“Loulalo”: Another medical practice
attributed to Binghi (B. 7/5/’52) was the
use of steam medication. For colds and
chills a pit was employed in which a fire
was built and allowed burn to a bed of
coals. Branches of gum-leaves, liberally
sprinkled with water, were strewn on the
coals and the patient sat or was held
over the resultant steam in a kind of
tent of animal skins or, more modern,
blankets. Cupping was sometimes tried,
too. Shells of suitable shape, or some-
times hollow bones, were heated to make
the air inside expand, and then applied
to the back or chest, or wherever needed.
The cooling air sucked up the flesh, and
the cupping was generally followed by a
puncture to “let out the bad blood,”
“The Missus”: Kino (B. 7/5/’52)
has its place in pharmacy as much for its
powerful astfingency as for its antiseptic
value. Binghi used it for stanching
wounds, and one old hatter bushman of
my acquaintance swore there was nothing
like it for toothache. He had a couple
of huge old hollow stumps, and his pet
remedy when they ached was to go to a
big old redgum near his hut, gather some
of the congealed gum from the trunk
and pack it into the offending member.
No doubt it made his mouth so puckered
and numb that the effect was similar to
that of a local anaesthetic.
“Mark O’Polo”: Why did “Sari” (B.
14/5/’52) soft-pedal the extraordinary
shooting skill of Jim’s old man?
I would remind him of two other
noteworthy shooting efforts, Bahram,
the great hunter, trying to impress
a girl-friend, saw a deer and
gave chase. He shot at the deer, causing
the arrow to graze its ear ; the deer, feel-
ing the graze, lifted its hoof to scratch,
whereupon Bahram released a second
arrow, pinning hoof to ear. Munchausen,
after game at night, and out of ball, found
himself surrounded by 50 flying ducks.
Making a quick analysis of the birds’
movements he realised that the birds
would be instantaneously aligned against
the full moon. Accordingly he placed
himself in the correct position, waited the
moment, and, using a valuable pearl as
a ball, not only got the lot, but recovered
the pearl from the body of the last duck.
Thus, to feats of marksmanship if
not equal to, at least comparable with,
that of Jim, sen., B. and M.
brought an added finesse, a delicacy
of touch, an artistry which pro-
claimed each a supreme master of his own
weapon. Bahram judged the strength
of his draw to the fraction of
an ounce, Munc. judged his powder-
charge to the fraction of a grain. It is
known by some shooters that the harder
one pulls the trigger of a Lee-Enfield the
further the bullet will go, and Jim’s
Dad’s feat betrayed the unmistakable
touch of a master’s hand, not so much in
his sighting the ’roo while holding the
rifle at an angle of 45 degrees, as in the
way he held the weapon steady while he
gave the necessary added impetus without
actually straightening out the trigger,
sending bolt and firing-pin after the
bullet and sucking the remaining
cartridges halfway up the barrel.
* * * *
“Wayward”: One of the largest stacks
of old Bulletins I’ve seen was on the
shelves of a tin-scratcher’s hut on Bullocky
Creek, Mount Lewis. My old friend
Darby MacNamara had been keeping
them for years. During the late war, when
flat galvanised-iron for fluming was un-
procurable, many alluvial tinminers were
less active in the industry. Not so my
friend Darby. To repair the galvanised-
iron fluming, which had rusted along the
centre, he decided to rivet there a con-
tinuous patch of flatiron. With all
materials scarce, the matter of a long,
continuous watertight joint was the
problem. Darby overcame it by using
copies of The Bulletin. Walking along
this flume with him when the job was
finished, I had memories of earlier
years brought back by the sight of
parts of the work of old Bulletin artists
—Hop, Vincent, Souter and Lindsay. I’ve
often wondered since what it must have
cost Darby to use those old copies, for he
looked upon the pink-covered weekly as
his bible.
AUSTRALIAN WALKABOUT
MEMORY.
An owl called from a pine-tree,
Towering, solitary, black
In the moonlight lamping
Its topmost tip;
The owl called; a Maori answered,
Standing dark and solitary
In the doorway of his cabin
Fronting the sea,
Lipping an ocharina.
Twenty years gone; the owl, the flute,
The sea’s liplapping,
The black pine’s candle lit
By the blossoming moon;
Ashes, twenty years cold.
Comes memory, like a wind,
Whispering nostalgically
Of an owl, a Maori and an ocharina,
Under a rising moon.

THE ENCHANTRESS.
The sea, like a dark-haired woman,
green-eyed and white of skin,
settles her silks and laces,
and calls her lovers in
with caress and a lilt of laughter
to hide within the stone
that is her heart; and, encharmed,
each seeks her for his own.
But the uninveigled, ashore,
see where the driftwood lies,
stark and bereft of dignity,
(and only the seagulls’ cries
mock with discordant elegy),
fingered and tossed beyond reach
in anonymous heaps or astray,
sucked dry and spat out on the beach.
And of all forgotten dead —
grey bones or old bleached tree,
brick shambles or tom page—
most lifeless are the rejects of the sea.
Yet in the curve of coral,
pale shell or white lace foam,
her lips form “Come!” with laughter,
and willingly they come.

and meteors of men
on land, barren as the moon?
potential as the sun?
These hot, cool lights shall see

the explosive activation of the dwarf

Live happily without his fear.

Bring on the cake with its twenty-one candles
To show that I’m old enough to be indepen-
dent—
Or to prove that a hundred would be too many.
Shall I blow out the candles and be like Moses?
Shall I go like Noah into a dark ark?
“Tell me,” says the man with the A.B.C. accent,
“How’s the world changed since you were
frisky?”
The blood runs slower. The heart beats harder.
The sun is warmer. The days are long.
At night I hear the cricket’s racket —
Things were different when I was young.
“Tell me,” says the man who comes from the
“Mirror,”
“What do you think of the Modern Woman/
Her legs are long, but girls have had longer.
She scolds her elders. She wheels my chair.
And what do I think of the Modern Woman,
Looking at Grandma and her grey hair?
When I was young and lies enormous,
Life was a girl with her hair in the moonlight.
Now, it is grey, and bald in patches . . .
I think the Modern Woman is nice to see.
But looking at this human woman,
What use is the Modern Girl to me?
“Your views on politics?” says the man from
the “Herald,”
Opening his notebook unimaginatively.
My views on politics are through the window.
I can’t see the sun, but that square of blue sky

That some day the sun will shine in my eye.
“Liberal Conservative! ” My opinion on politics?
Magpies sing longer than they ever used to.

People argue, and argue with you:
Won’t accept the living fact.
Fill up the glasses for a happy returning.
I can have some today but 1 must be careful.
Beer is forbidden. These doctors are devils
That charge you to cut the living from life.
My days are ended. Now I am dying
I’ll just drink another to the trouble-and-stnfe.
There’s my sister, watching me drinking.
Younger than I am. But to me she looks old.
At least enough to be my mother,
For her false teeth slip when she opens her
mouth.
Her hands fade trembling to the table . . .
And her eyes are always red, and moist.
I should feel for once as ancient.
Somehow I should understand her;
Not as my sister, but as a being.
Should fit her in to complete the jig-saw . . .
Reason flatters there’s a pattern
One could find, if time, before . . .
See me a hundred, as coffin stuffing.
Skull and bones the pirates plundered:
Eyes for sapphires, lips for rubies,
Silent skull and percussion bone,
With nothing to say on the world’s great
question:
Day and the light have left me alone.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
EISENHOWER INTERVIEW.
In 1950 General Eisenhower
gave an “off-the-record” inter-
view to David Lawrence, editor
of “U.S. News and World
Report,” and has now given per-
mission for its publication.
Eisenhower is strongly leading
in the Presidential race, accord-
ing to responsible U.S. assess-
ments. Hence, his “off-the-
record” views now become ex-
ceptionally important. The
answers to questions in the inter-
view which most significantly
signpost the kind of President
that Eisenhower would be, and
his probable lines of policy, are
here given:
Q. —General, how do you feel
we are getting along in America
in a social sense?
A.—l feel that the great in-
dustrial progress of our country
is something that has no parallel
in the world. We are a strong
nation in most fields of human
endeavor because we are in-
dustrially strong. We’ve got to
preserve that strength. We must
not do anything to weaken it.
Too Far Left
Q. —Do you think we have
deviated from our historical
course?
A. —In some things, particu-
larly in our emphasis on legisla-
tion as a panacea, I think we
have drifted too far to the so-
called “Left” so that many
Americans have a genuine fear
about the future. In particular,
we must not allow ourselves to
travel the road that Great Britain
apparently has been travelling.
America is not the kind of
country that needs Socialism.
We can achieve whatever reforms
we need without such a radical
change in our own economic
set-up. There are people in this
country, of course, who want to
go clear over to the “Left.” I
just don’t agree that America’s
future lies in that direction.
Morally Lacking
Q. —Do you think there is a
“middle way” that is not too
far over to the Right and is not
certainly in the direction of the
Left?
A.—l believe our problem
fundamentally involves human
relations —the job of bringing
people together to work together.
I have found in my experience
that it is possible for men of
many backgrounds and many
views to work together—given
sincerity of purpose and mutual
good faith. I think that we’ve
got to begin to work together in
America and to diminish our
frictions and our dissension. I
think there is a way for all of us
—labor and management and
farmers—to do that within the
framework of American
traditions and principles.
Q. —Do you think that this ne-
cessitates a change in our moral
background?
A. —Not a change, a renewed
recognition and appreciation of
it. Unless we recognise the
moral background to the busi-
ness of human living, unless we
are spiritually on the right track,
we cannot solve our problems
and work together. I have a
distinct feeling at times that we
have been lacking on the moral
side, that we have not made the
most of our opportunities to
understand one another.
Both Sides’ “Good Faith”
Q. —General, do you think we
have gone too far in imposing
restrictions on labor unions and
on employers?
A. —With most men, in both
management and labor, I think
this whole question is again one
of human relations. It is diffi-
cult to set up by law a formula
that will make people work to-
gether. Laws are necessary to
correct abuses and to establish
practical approaches. But if we
are going to have satisfactory
relations between labor and
management, there must be sin-
cerity on both sides and a
willingness to make laws effec-
tive. It’s just like the writing
of any private contract. If
there’s good faith on both sides,
you can make any contract work.
If there’s bad faith, you will
find people looking for loop-
holes and quibbling about what
the contract means.
I don’t think, there’s any law
that can be written which can
assure good faith in its interpre-
tation when there is deliberate
design to act in bad faith. I
believe of much more import-
ance in labor-management re-
lations is the spirit that both sides
show toward each other; par-
ticularly, each side must be
guided by its concern for the
over-all good of the country.
Lots of times it’s more im-
portant to get on with the job
than to quibble and haggle
about an unimportant point,
and lots of times something
fundamental comes up which
just can’t be bargained away.
I believe if we acted more on
principle and on fundamentals,
we wouldn’t be involved in
strikes and work stoppages of
a serious nature.
There are elements in America,
of course, that want to provoke
labor and management into more
and more conflicts. We must be
on our guard against subversive

elements that abuse the laws
and customs of our country.
No amount of mediation
or arbitration can do the job
when there’s enmity and an-
tagonism on the part of one or
both of the parties in the dis-
pute. Again, I say, the human
approach is the best one.
Government Interference
Q. —What do you think about
the basic principle of interven-
tion on the part of the Govern-
ment in the economic life of the
country? Should the Govern-
ment ever intervene?
A. —As a first observation, I
emphatically agree with the
generalisation that we should
have as little of Government in
business and private affairs as is
feasible in our modern, complex
life. But I believe that Gov-
ernment cannot be a totally
passive bystander in the country’s
economic life.
To what extent Government
should intervene depends on the
facts of the specific and con-
crete situation. Surely nobody
is going to advocate that people
shall be allowed to starve or that
unemployment should reach
such a point of desperation that
people, through no fault of their
own, are actually in want and
suffering privation.
There are times when Govern-
ment, acting for all the people,
must intervene in the economic
life of the country and use Gov-
ernment aid to tide the people
over in an emergency. But this
is a far different thing from
making it a permanent proposi-
tion or using wrongfully the idea
of “emergency” to install some
kind of Socialistic system or
governmental paternalism.
I do believe that there are
occasions when the resources of
the Government can be used to
assist the people.
The principle of economic
intervention when related to an
emergency is a sound one ; other-
wise as little intervention as
feasible.
Q. —What do you think about
Governmental regulation in a
broad sense?
A.—Again, I think that regula-
tion of certain economic activity
that affects us is a well-under-
stood practice. This again,
however, is a far cry from gov-
ernmental regulation of every-
thing. It extends merely to those
abuses in economic society
which must necessarily be regu-
lated by Government in order
that there may be fair play. It
all comes back to fair play.
Views on Russia
Q. —General, how do you feel
about the Russians as a people?
A. —We can’t discuss the Rus-
sians qnless we distinguish
sharply between those who rule
and those who are ruled. The
men in the Kremlin permit us
no doubt about their intentions
to infiltrate, to subvert, and to
destroy free institutions wherever
possible. They control absolutely,
as of now, and so far as we can
see, the Russian people. Aside
from that control, I think that
most of the Russians—outside
the Kremlin —are very much like
other peoples. My experience
with their commanders during
the war made me feel that they
are proud of their country, and
are good fighters. As a military
man, I don’t want to see any
more war. There must be a way
some day for us to see that we
can’t live happily in a world
governed by fear, and that the
price of peace is not really high
if we sincerely want it.
Taft was "Agen 'Em."
Eisenhower’s main opponent
for the Republican Presidential
nomination, Senator Taft, as
revealed through the rather em-
phatic testimony of his actual
votes on vital issues (listed by
“New York Times”); Taft
voted:
(1) Against arming of
American vessels prior to Pearl
Harbor,
(2) Against selective service
[i.e., the American form of com-
pulsory military training in
peace-time].
(3) Against the extension of
selective service on the eve of
Pearl Harbor.
(4) Against lend-lease.
(5) Against revising the Neu-
trality Act in 1941 [the revision
of which enabled America to
give aid absolutely vital to the
survival of Britain and othec
countries as well].
(6) Against continuing the
Hull reciprocal trade programme
[this continuation also of extreme
survival-importance to Britain
and other countries].
(7) Against the British loan.
(8) Against the North Atlantic
Security Pact.
(9) Against Point Four [the
clause in the Truman post-war
policy programme providing for
America’s aiding sorely needy
countries].
The Textiles Flop.
“Even in Japan, some of the
leading men in the cotton in-
dustry are now saying that,
although their spinning capacity
is not yet back to pre-war, it is
too large for the world market,
and that Japan should divert
some of her resources to export-
ing engineering goods and
chemicals.”
And, comments London
“Observer,” does not that apply
even more so in Britain?
“Have Lancashire and York-
shire,” it asks, “any sort of
divine right to export their
‘traditional’ products to ‘tradi-
tional’ markets? A once-thriv-
ing woollen industry in the West
Country all but died as economic
conditions changed. Could not
the same happen eventually
further north?
“All this does not, of course,
mean that our whole cotton in-
dustry must be junked immedi-
ately, like some out-of-date tram.
As a few enterprising cotton
firms, and many more woollen
and worsted manufacturers,
have proved, there are still
excellent prospects for exports
of British textile manufactures
of high quality and imaginative
design. It is a question of trying
to find out how big a textile
industry would best serve the
interests of its own perplexed
workers and of the country as a
whole.”
Dragnet Digest.
Respect for J. Bull. —Noting
that Britain’s guarantee of the
European Defence Community
had been received in Germany
“with an enthusiasm bordering
on jubilation,” a New York
“Herald Tribune” correspon-
dent at Bonn added: “One
might ask why such a fuss is
being made about the British
guarantee. The answer lies in the
unique respect for Britain that
exists in Germany as in the
other European countries.”
“Buy American” Law. —
Pointing out that the “Buy
American” law requires the
U.S. Government to buy
domestically-produced goods un-
less equivalent foreign products
are 25 per cent, or more
cheaper, “New York Times”
suggests a change: “If we really
believe in the unity of the free
world we must show that atti-
tude by actions as well as words.
And one of the key actions
needed is a policy of ‘Buy Free
World’ to replace the short-
sighted, depression-born policy
of ‘Buy American.’ ”
Unalterable U.S. Policy. —
Holding that even Senator Taft
would find it hard to change
U.S. foreign policy if he became
President, London “Daily Mail”
concludes: “America is com-
mitted to the world-wide ‘con-
tainment’ of Communism, and,
if only for her own safety, she
must see it through. Mr.
Truman has blazed a trail which
must be followed by whoever
succeeds him.”
Voice of Eisenhower. —What
the Voice of America hasn’t
quite managed to do could be
done by the voice of Eisenhower,
in the view of Paul G. Hoffman.
Speaking as President of the U.S.
(said Hoffman), Eisenhower’s
voice could “make a sieve of the
Iron Curtain.” He could carry
the conviction that America
wants peace, and that it had the
will and the strength to rnsist
upon peace, because, Hoffman
said: “The Russian leaders fear
and respect Gen. Eisenhower.”
“Germ-warfare’' Explanation.
—Lately back after representing
his paper for 18 months in
Moscow, a London “Sunday
Times” staff correspondent has
reported: “The only acceptable
explanation I have come across
for the unusually intensive
propaganda campaign being
waged within the Soviet Union
about the Americans’ alleged use
of germ warfare in Korea is
that the ordinary Russian citizen
is bored with and by now indif-
ferent to the endless references
to ‘Capitalist cannibals’ and
‘Wall Street warmongers’:
authority has decided that it is
time to stir up some indignation
over specific charges,”
Gibraltar Deal. —Lord Stra-
bolgi, representing Britain, was
well received on his visit to
Spain, the “Manchester Guar-
dian” Madrid correspondent re-
porting : “It is believed that
Great Britain may be permitted
the use of Spanish Atlantic ports,
especially in Galicia, and that
some compromise on the Gib-
raltar question may be reached.
One of the main topics discussed
in Lord Strabolgi’s interview
with General Franco is under-
stood to have been Gibraltar,
and it is felt that the problem
may best be solved by some
form of ‘lease-lend’ of port and
dockyard facilities.”
Saar Swing to Germany. —
Reporting on Franco-German
differences over the Saar, a
“Manchester Guardian” cor-
respondent notes that neither
side talks much about the
Saarlanders themselves, and
adds: “A year ago the Saar-
landers had little to say about
their future beyond asking to be
‘left in peace’ and to be allowed
to work and earn a living. To-
day their demeanor is different.
The first post-war swing back
towards the idea of reunion with
Germany has begun and is
gathering momentum.”
Indo - China Intervention. —
The country to which “Dr.
Evatt’s protege” went on a
“peace mission” is, “U.S. News
and World Report” notes, tak-
ing a more and more open part
in Indo-China: “U.S., French
and British diplomats are closing
their eyes to the growing use of
Communist Chinese troops and
weapons in the war against the
French in Indo-China. The
diplomats prefer not to recog-
nise that Chinese Communists
are expanding their aggression in
Asia.”
A Wine Glut. —They’ve been
inquiring into thirst-appeasing
in France, too, not on account
of “short supply” but its very
opposite. As a result, there’s the
inevitable “plan.” For the cur-
rent year excess of wine supply
over demand is 330 million
gallons. Under the “plan” there’s
to be a division of France into
traditionally wine-producing and
general agriculture districts.
Wine-producers in the latter will
be encouraged to turn to other
crops, and their wines will be
taxed more heavily than those
of the former.

SUNDRY SHOWS
WATERCOLOR SHOW.
The outstanding painting at
this year’s Watercolor Institute
exhibition at Sydney Education
Department Galleries is Rah
Fizelle’s “Piave de Cadore,” a
picture dating back some years
to when Fizelle was painting
cold Alpine light in Italy.
It is of a village dominated
by a white church set high on a
plateau amongst green fields
vivid in sunlight and rich in
shadow, and the church in turn
is dominated by jagged and
gigantic crags of ice in the back-
ground, A touch of cubist tech-
nique has been used to give
movement and to heighten the
geometrical drama of folds of
green and towering verticals of
white, but the device is used so
moderately and intelligently that
the picture never becomes a
mere pattern, never loses touch
with reality but becomes a fine
and lofty transfiguration of
reality; like a landscape seen in
a dream.
In space, time and perhaps
emotional intensity it is a long
way from the quite extraordinary
beauty of this picture to Fizelle’s
other contributions to the show,
the warm brown landscapes of
summer at Oberon, N. S. Wales ;
but “Orchard, Oberon,” is, at
any rate, the best bit of Aus-
tralian heat and atmosphere in
the exhibition —in which, as a
whole, there are too many muddy
little sketches, both traditional
and “modern,” that really should
be excluded as failures.
Three sumptuous and spark-
ling Norman Lindsay water-
colors are also of exceptional
interest: none a display of his
full powers, but each an excel-
lent example of his varied styles :
“Oh, Mr. Brisk” of his gay little
comedies of flirtation in the sun-
light, “The Magic Mantle” (with
a lovely light on the central
nude) of his massed composi-
tions of figures, and “Gypsies’
Dance” of the rich interplay of
shadow and firelight.
G. K. Townshend has done
his wet days around French’s
Forest and Dee Why often be-
fore, but so expertly and sensi-
tively does he work in this one
grey mood that his pictures
always have the force of a
fresh exploration instead of the
repetition one might expect: “A
Northern Seaside Road” is one
of the best vistas of rainy atmos-
phere he has done for years.
John Eldershaw’s enormous
“Little Pink Cottage, Berrima,”
lacks crispness and point, but
remains a powerful demonstra-
tion of control of the medium
over a large area. Ronald
Steuart has some very delicate
watercolors showing a trace of
Chinese influence.
Other paintings of quality in-
clude Mary Edwards’s curious
fantasy of “Gum Leaves in the
Morning,” Margaret Coen’s
“Spring Bunch” and “Sand-
stone,” Yvonne du Moulin’s
landscapes in her familiar
browns and greens, Jean Derrin’s
“Private Road,” H. W. Grace’s
“Road to Braidwood,” W. H.
Kibble’s “Quiet Lane” and two
landscapes by a painter new to
this reviewer—May Neill’s
“Winter Sunshine” and “Off the
Beaten Track, Mona Vale.”
Hung in menacing nearness
along the narrow entrance to
David Jones’s Gallery, Sydney,
the entries for M.G.M.’s £250
prize look like the Contemporary
Society in full blast, and Jean
Bellette’s “Girl with Still Life”
fully deserves its prize not only
for being a pleasant painting
(sculptural without being mon-
strous, with a nice patch of
yellow in it and an attractive
personality in the girl to offset
the dull still-life and the cement
napkin or newspaper) but also
just for standing still and look-
ing quiet in that rowdy company.
Wallace Thornton’s second-
prize, “Girl with Flowers,” is
fusty, and there is higher—if
nowhere remarkable —quality in
Sidney Nolan’s “Steel Harbor,”
Santry’s “Berry’s Bay,” Scott
Pendlebury’s “Outer Suburb,”
Paul Haefliger’s “Nude” from
Picasso, Judy Cassab’s “Portrait
of a Peasant,” W. Boissevain’s
“Landscape” and Mary Mc-
Leish’s thinly-charming study of
children.
* * * *
In a “farewell exhibition” at
David Jones’s before going
abroad Francis Lymbumer
shows his familiar cats, circuses,
showboats and park-benches, in
an atmosphere of frivolity on the
brink of nightmare that belongs
to Paris rather than Sydney, and
with a lackadaisical technique
that sometimes perfectly suits his
light wit and often falls into a
muddy vacuity. Some moments
of distinct pleasure, in the midst
of regret or exasperation, are
provided by the haunted eye of
the cat with the fish, the two
teenage girls clinging together
in what might be a thunderstorm
or a murky night at a dance-
hall, the comic lovers embracing
in the desperate paradise of the
city’s lunch-hour, the diaphanous
“Circus Tent,” and the wittily-
observed old lady knitting under
the tree in the park.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
At the Sedon Galleries, Mel-
bourne, is a memorial exhibition
of the work of Herbert Rose,
the Melbourne artist who got
his art training at the National
Gallery, went overseas, exhibited
in London, Paris and U.S., re-
turned to Australia and was in
full flight to a niche in Aus-
tralian art when he went to India
and, at 46, died of diphtheria in
Delhi. His pictures range from
the banks of the Murrumbidgee
to the banks of the Seine and
the Guadalquivir, and there are
relics of his brief Indian sojourn
in some sketches and drawings.
They might be called the apothe-
osis of the Streeton tradition,
and received in their day glow-
ing tributes —“His sunlight is
warm and glows with that inner
glow that is the despair of so
many painters.” He had some
skill and could render certain
effects of nature very nicely.
Tosca.
N.S.W. National Opera’s
Sydney season touched the high-
water mark of artistry with this
production by Stefan Haag.
Clever use of lighting, especially
in the church scene, fine decor —
the brilliantly-lighted dinner-
table set on the edge of sombre
shadows in the second act was a
masterpiece of devising—and
costumes of some splendor (the
work of Tim Walton) lent much
to its success.
It was the acting and singing
of the three principals that
clinched the issue. Betty Fret-
well was a beautiful Tosca, and
she hit every note dead-centre up
on the heights of the great
“Recondita” aria. She also
responded with greater
emotional warmth than as Elsa
in “Lohengrin” to the passionate
pleadings of Ronald Dowd,
whose stature in both depart-
ments has grown remarkably
with the season. Robert Sim-
mons made of Scarpia a sort of
aristocratic Himmler, always
sinister and minatory, yet always
with the courtly graces to give
the steel its covering of velvet.
Also, his baritone worked with
power and was finely phrased.
The Sardou story was never
allowed to degenerate into low
bellowdrama, as it can easily do
under loose guidance. There was
one serious fault, however.
Joseph Post’s orchestra was too
heavy-handed in the first two
acts, and singing of less virility
would have been swamped.
Frank Lisle turned in a neat
characterisation as the Sacristan,
and Neil Easton was the fugitive
Angelotti.

in appointing the Union Trustee as your executor
may be more than offset by the careful, economi-
cal management of your Estate.

The end of the wool-price boom in
April, 1951, was soon followed by adverse
seasons in most States. In Victoria the
drought was not quite so bad. But Aus-
tralian sales and prices for the 10 months
to April show how the industry generally
has been alfected: —
10 Mths. Bales Average
to April, Sold. Value. per Bale.
1951 .. 3,041,731 £568,429,949 £186 17 7
1952 ., 2,904,148 263,510,256 90 14 9
Declining prices over the last selling
season have caused the nation’s income
from wool for the 10 months to fall to
£263 million, the drop being more than
50 p.c. on the figure for the correspond-
ing period in 1951. The number of bales
sold was 137,583 (4.5 p.c.) less than in
1951, notwithstanding the turning-over of
some wheat and dairying country to
sheep.
A cost-reckoning now seems likely to
follow the high-priced feast. In their
upward spiral, costs always prove the
most stubborn to control, and continue
to make things awkward long after prices
have settled down.
Established for over 63 years in the
woolbroking, pastoral-finance, merchan-
dising and agency business, figures for
the efficient Younghusband concern illus-
trate the trend: —

For the five years to 1951 the rate of
expenses to gross profits declined, but
when income took its disproportionate
dive last term the expense-ratio rose
noticeably. The company put 15,625
more bales under the hammer than in
1951, with a gross-profit return of
£104,031 less.
After reducing allowances all round —
depreciation by £15,481 to £18,254, tax
provision by £77,000 to £73,000, stalf
fund £2000 to £8000—the net profit of
£88,857 was £69,386 lower. The return
on capital was 10.2 p.c., which compares
with 18.1, 14.8, 10.2, 7.5 and 6 p.c. back
to 1947.
By dropping the 2\ p.c. addition made
to the dividend in 1951, the 10 p.c. dis-
tribution left £357 for visible reserves,
which now stand at £485,419.
Untouched by the drought in Queens-
land, which is likely to affect meat (beef)
output more than wool, some properties
in the co.’s area did experience dry spells
during the year. However, timely autumn
rains have fallen throughout Victoria and
southern N. S. Wales, and appear to
promise good winter pastures and a
satisfactory season.
The carryover of unsold wool at the
close of accounts was 12,525 bales (down
10,378), and, reflecting the fall in prices,
creditors declined by £2,149,365, advances
by £368,563 and cash by £2,006,619:

Lifting total representation to 45
branches, three new properties were
acquired during the year, explaining the
£64,486 rise in the premises item. Over
the year the liquid surplus (£814,142)
declined by £64,129.
At a referendum, growers rejected the
post-J.O. wool scheme, which planned
price-stability through concerted Govern-
ment action in Australia, the U.K., South
Africa and New Zealand, by a majority
of four to one. Prices in recent sales
have remained fairly stable, despite some
fluctuations, with Yorkshire, Continental
and Japanese buyers operating mostly,
with some support from the U.S. and
Australia.
The coming year is thus difficult to
predict, but the market casts a suspicious
eye toward costs, and has reduced the
price paid for this co.’s scrip from 41s.
6d. a year ago to 335. last week. At this
price, with a book-asset backing of 31s.
Id., the 20s. shares yield 6 p.c. on the

Largest concern of its kind in the Com-
monwealth, this co. manufactures stoves,
baths, gas-heaters, builders’ hardware,
enamel goods, radiators and other elec-
trical appliances. There are two operat-
ing subsidiaries (Metiers and Metiers
K.F.8.), with factories at Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Perth.
Deriving its prosperity from the build-
ing boom, profits in the above table have
increased almost proportionally to the
number of houses erected in the Com-
monwealth. In 1946 these totalled
15,376, and grew to 55,485 in 1950 and
67,444 last year. Investors have shared
in the company’s related prosperity, and,
of its £860,409 growth in issued capital
since 1946, more than half has been by
way of gift issues.
In 1950 £262,514 of bonus scrip
was distributed, followed by a further
£211,011 (3s. 4d. per 16s. Bd. share)
last term, when the shares were
consolidated into £1 units. Thus has been
returned the £319,077 written off capital
in 1934, plus £154,448 besides. The dis-
tributions have been financed from
reserves and undistributed profits.
Fixed assets of the subsidiaries were
revalued last term, and the proceeds, less
a provision of £30,000 no longer required,
were transferred to a special reserve
which, the board states, now equals the
difference between par and acquired value
of subsidiaries’ shares shown in the
parent’s books.
The latest cash issue was in December
last, when 124,636 ordinary shares (re-
duced from 311,587 by Capital Issues) —
1 for every 25 ord. or pref. held —lifted
paid capital to the present £1,682,580,
which includes 297,874 7 p.c. cum. prefs.
Profits improved by £66,002 last term
to a record £274,352, which was struck
after allowing undisclosed amounts for
depreciation and taxation, and after
adding £24,146 dropped into a reserve.
Deducting preference commitments
(£20,851), the return on average ordinary
capital was 19.7 p.c., which compares
with 17.8, 18.8 and 16.4 p.c. back to
1949. Payment of the ordinary dividend
completed a decade of 10 p.c. distribu-
tions, and the amount carried to reserves
was 46 p.c. of the year’s earnings. The
new paid capital, at existing rates of
dividend, will require £159,321 next term,
or £115,031 less than was earned last
term.
Finances are sound, and the liquid sur-
plus (£849,996) improved by £74,648
during the year:

Revaluation of assets mentioned shows
up in the consolidated figures, while the
expansion of creditors (£81,322), debtors
(£54,323) and stocks (£422,630) reflects the
expanded trade.
Sales increased again during last term,
and although a lull has developed in
house-construction due to high costs and
credit-restrictions, the overall demand for
building construction is likely to remain
unsatisfied for many years to come ; also
replacement demand is very high, so that
if future trade is restricted it is likely
to be, as in the past, on the supply side,
where shortages of raw materials and
skilled labor and power failures have
reduced output. Thus the programme for
buiiding-and-plant expansion goes for-
ward, and anew unit producing baths
and sanitary-ware in South Australia is
expected to start operations shortly, while
the labor problem has been tackled
through the introduction of an incentive-
payments scheme.
General Industries’ ordinary shares, at
395. 9d., yield 5 p.c. on alO p.c. div. basis,
and the prefs., at 31s. 3d. (buyer), 4.5

respectively (book-value) back each class
of share.
Bearing Service (Holdings), Ltd.
The 10s. shares in this Melbourne-
headquartered concern have settled at
13s. 6d. in the market following the first
uncertainty caused by the import restric-
tions. Almost all the supplies which the
co.’s group of subsidiaries deal in are
imported, the principal sources being
Hoffman Mfg. Cos., Ltd., British Timken,
Ltd., and Fischer Bearings Cos., Ltd, —all
of England. Additional supplies come
from other manufacturers in England,
U.S.A. and Switzerland.
The investing public is not yet fully
acquainted with the enterprise. Bearing
Service (Holdings), Ltd., was formed in
Melbourne in April, 1950, to acquire all
the shares in Bearing Service Cos. of Aus-
tralia, Ltd. (Melbourne), and Bearing
Service Cos. of Australia (Pty.), Ltd.,
Brisbane.
In doing so it also became the owner
of a 100 p.c. interest in Bearing Service
Cos. of Aust. Pty., Ltd. (Sydney), Ball
Bearings Pty., Ltd. (Sydney), William
Easy Pty,, Ltd. (Sydney), and a52 p.c.
interest in Bearing Service Cos. of Aust.
Pty., Ltd. (Adelaide), as well as 37.6 p.c,
of the shares in Duncan and Cos., Ltd.,
Adelaide.
Later the co.’s interests were extended
into the Western State when it took over
Bearing Service Cos. of Aust. (W.A.) Pty.,
Ltd. (Perth) Purchase price was a cash
payment of £20,184 with an allotment of
123,500 fully-paid 10s. shares to share-
holders in the Perth company.
Present paid-up capital is £891,652 in
1,783,304 shares of 10s. each.
Though, at the public float, the new
valuation placed on the undertaking was
nearly six times the paid-up value of the
old shares, and excess of paid-up capital
over net assets on consolidation was
£392,637, making net tangible assets
ss. Id. per 10s. share, past earning-power
of the cos. showed up well in relation to
the enlarged capital. Allowing for public-
co. taxes, combined net earnings for the
year to June 30, 1947, were 8.1 p.c. on
present capital, 18.7 p.c. 1948, 19.9 p.c.
1949, 19.8 p.c. 1950.
In respect of the year to June 30, 1951,
consolidated profits increased to 23.5 p.c.
on paid capital. The total earnings were
£209,945, after allowing almost as much
(£209,650) for taxation. A dividend of
9 p.c. was paid out of tax-free reserves,
leaving a net £129,696 available for
general reserves and the writing-off of
intangibles. At June 30 last the net
tangible backing per 10s. share had
increased to 7s. 3d,
Only £34,967 of tax-paid profits
remained in the business after payment of
the div., though there is the possibility
of their being added to by £15,000 this
year. If so, they will be enough to pay
another 5y p.c., tax-free.
The year which will close on June 30
next should be favorable for trading
results, though subject to a heavier taxa-
tion levy. The 1952-53 financial year may
be harder, but on the imports side the co.
should have a high priority, and the
demand for industrial bearings should
remain keen. Demand for ball-races for
domestic electrical appliances is likely
to be lower.
Finances of the group at last balance-
day were comfortable:

The increase in stocks was due to a policy
of increasing reserves of anti-friction
bearings, and in October last year the
management was still adding to stocks and
following a programme of “long-range
ordering” because of a world-wide short-
age of bearings. This has proved a wise
policy in view of the present import
restrictions.
The co. does not pay interim divs.;
total distribution is due in October. If
the 9 p.c. rate is continued the yield to
the investor at 13s. 6d. would be 6.6 p.c.
Fairymead Sugar
At the annual meeting of Fairymead
Sugar (Q.), the chairman said that the
directors vainly tried to maintain the
usual dividend (now down from 12 p.c.
to 8 p.c.), but drought over the three
months after the close of the year
removed any chance of this, more par-
ticularly when Government consent to a
much-needed increase in the price of raw
sugar was delayed.
Since then a committee of inquiry has
been set up to go into every phase of the
industry and report to the Federal Cabinet
as to what the price of sugar should be.
The result of this report is anxiously
awaited by Fairymead and others in the
industry.
Proceeds of the new issue of
250,000 £1 shares in February at
a premium of 10s. each were used to
provide (1) machinery, equipment,
quarters for mill and field staff ; (2) capital
in place of loans to cover fixed assets and
work in progress and stocks; and (3)
more land and more production to match
rising overhead costs. The co.’s mill is
now probably the largest crushing plant
in Queensland. An adequate rise in raw

the horizon, Fairymead made a
bid to get a share of it. This
meant increasing and accelerating
capital expenditure. Synchronis-
ing with this was the increasing
upward rush of inflationary
costs, which meant very heavy
recourse to bank loans. The
drought setbacks alone would
not necessarily have meant a
lowered dividend-rate, but heavy
bank-borrowing simultaneously
with credit-restrictions, and
initial refusal to the capital issue,
plus postponement by Federal
Cabinet of the requested price-
rise, all conspired to cause acute
embarrassment to the co.
In 1946, when similar drought
and frosts took place, although
the crop was 65,000 tons then,
compared with 142,000 tons in
1951, the results from the sugar-
growing and -milling sections
were twice as good in 1946. The
sugar industry generally, the co.
says, along with Fairymead, did
not realise the calamity caused
by the low effective sugar price
(although it had recently been
raised Id. per pound) until well
after the Fairymead new-share
issue had been started, and was
nearing completion.
Bruntons (Holdings), Ltd.
An open-and-shut issue marked
the entry of this concern to the
public-company ranks. It takes
over, as operating subsidiaries,
the two concerns of T. Brunton
and Cos. Pty., Ltd., and Brunton
and Cos. Pty., Ltd., flourmillers,
operating in Victoria and N. S.
Wales respectively. For their
combined capital of £199,651
the new company paid £288,550
in ss. shares, or £88,899 for
goodwill, etc., on the face-value
of the scrip. The public issue
of 245,802 shares at par, which
will provide working capital,
lifts the paid-up figure to
£350,000, all in ss. units.
The prospectus stated that the
four mills, situated at Mel-
bourne, Rupanyup, Clyde and
Gunnedah, would require over
£1 million to replace, yet are
shown in the books at £260,601.
On the latter figure net tangible
asset backing is 6s. 3d. per ordi-
nary unit, but if the above valua-
tion figure is assumed, the back-
ing rises to 16s. lOd. per share.
Combined profits of the two
proprietaries are shown without
any allowance being made for
taxation. But a reasonable
dividend is indicated.
Callide Coal
“P. Mobile”: The news that
a trial shipment of Callide coal
has reached India, in good con-
dition and without showing signs
of spontaneous combustion, is
heartening. Callide coal, like
most others of sub-bituminous
rank, does not usually travel or
store well, as Victorian and other
users know to their cost. In
this case it is probable that the
cargo consisted of lower-layer
material, freshly mined, which
gave it a considerable advantage
over the top coal left to rot be-
fore shipment in the Gladstone
stockpiles.
Whether, on test, it will still
prove suitable remains to be
seen. As with nearly all low-
rank fuels, Callide coal requires
individual technique in treatment
and in firing to enable it to pro-
duce good results. Collie (W.A.),
Leigh Creek (S.A.) and Yallourn
(Vic.) coals have all been the
subject of intensive research and
practical experiment over many
years, but there is still much to
leam as to the most efficient
methods to use in handling and
burning them, and, in view of
Callide’s possible importance in
the export economy of Australia,
any trial cargo of this fuel to a
new market should be accom-
panied by an expert with
specialist experience of its
idiosyncrasies and with a prac-
tical knowledge of the best
methods for its successful
utilisation.

Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Lady Dixon has been president of the
Women’s Group of the Royal Empire
Society for six years, in which time 11,000
food parcels and 12,000 articles of clothing
have been sent to needy people in
London, and several thousand pounds
raised for the Food for Britain Appeal.
Also, the Women’s Group during that
time gave £4OOO to the Royal Empire
Society in support of its work. With the
appointment of Sir Owen Dixon as Chief
Justice of Australia, Lady Dixon has
resigned, and Lady Michaelis now
becomes president. More than 100
members of the group met at a reception
in the Town Hall to farewell Lady
Dixon, whose tailored black suit carried a
presentation corsage of gardenias. Mrs.
Peter Danby and Anne Dixon accom-
panied their mother, and in the official
party were Lady Herring, the Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. John Inkster, the presi-
dent of the Australian Council of Women,
Mrs. Herbert Brookes, the president of
the Rational Council of Women, Mrs.
J. G. Norris, Mrs. Gerald Bacon, of the
English-Speaking Union, the wife of the
Royal Empire Society’s president, Mrs.
J. Kingsley Norris, and Mrs. C. Couch-
man, vice-president of the Royal Empire
Society. During the afternoon an
illuminated card, prepared by artist
Douglas Moule, was presented to Lady
Dixon.
Sir Robert Knox, president of the
National Theatre, whose encouragement
has done much for the young performers
in the current Arts Festival, had in his
opening-night party for the premiere
of Walter Gore’s ballet “Crucifix,”
Lady Angliss, whose ankle-length dinner-
frock was of silver-grey brocade. English
stage- and film-star Jessie Matthews
received a warm welcome from the audi-
ence when she entered a box with Mr.
and Mrs. Garnet Carroll. She was
accompanied by her daughter Catherine.
Mrs. Carroll’s long-sleeved black velvet
gown was worn with a silver-fox cape.
Miss Matthews chose a vivid-red silk
jersey gown, the strapless bodice having
a jet-embroidered cuff. With this gown
Miss Matthews wears interchangeable
cuffs to the bodice which match
the gloves. Her daughter topped a
bouffant black moire taffeta gown with
a hip i -length jacket of brown fox fur.
Mrs. F. A. Campbell’s gown was of
Parma-violet crepe. Mrs. T. Grantham
wore with her short black frock a grey
Russian squirrel coat. A black lace
ballerina frock and Persian-lamb coat
were the choice of the Lady Mayoress,
Mrs. John Inkster. A frock of pearl-grey
brocade and a short silver-blue mink
jacket were worn by Mrs. Gladys Myer.
Of bronze-brown faille was Mrs. L.
Dooley’s frock. Mrs. Eric Lampe wore
black crepe, Mrs. F. Dennett an emerald
crepe gown. Mrs. A. T. Smithers’s
brocades were gunmetal-grey. Myra
Roper’s raspberry-red velvet coat was
trimmed with ocelot fur.
On the night of July 4 the American
Women’s Auxiliary to the Children’s
Hospital will hold their annual ball in
St. Kilda Town Hall. The function is
to be known as the Manhattan Penthouse
Party, and the decorative motif will give
guests the illusion that they are having a
“night out” in New York. The foyer of
the hall will be transformed by a colorful
marquee, presumably set on top of a
skyscraper. Each nightclub in New York
will be represented by a poster, which will
alternate with a replica of a large
champagne-glass and will hang from the
balconies. On each table in the ballroom
there will be a miniature top-hat and
white cane. There will also be a signpost
in miniature bearing the name of a New
York street and the table-number. During
the evening 10 American girls will circu-
late among the tables selling book-
matches, specially designed for the even-
ing. Tickets are £4 10s. double, and
all proceeds are for the Children’s
Hospital. Mrs. David Cheadle and Mrs.
H. Klestadt are the hon. organisers.
Mrs. T. R. Blarney and Mrs. Glen Smith
are in charge of decorations and Mrs.
G. Uhrich (8J1956) is ticket-secretary.
Women can no' longer afford to turn
up their noses at the thought of wearing a
coat or jacket of rabbit fur. The restric-
tion on imports of skins has put the fur-
trades on their mettle, and they have very
successfully treated Australian furs so that
they compare favorably with the more
expensive pelts. This was seen at the
parade at the Delphic organised by the
Fur Traders’ Association of Victoria.
Ingenuity was displayed in the fashion-
ing of lamb, wallaby and rabbit fur into
coats, strollers and capes. The loveliest
and most outstanding of the Australian
fur was the full-backed hip-length jacket
of phantom wallaby skin. It took 12
months to produce this jacket, which
shades from light to dark grey, can be
worn with or without the belt, and has
deep armholes. Another fine example of
the furrier’s art was a hip-length jacket of
Krimmer-dyed lamb. Rabbit fur was
treated in the same way as the wallaby
to produce a stroller coat called phantom-
coney. This had sloping shoulders, full
back, a heart-shaped Elizabethan collar
and batwing sleeves. A beaverine stroller
in rosewood tones had been plasticised to
make it rain-resisting. In another model
the rabbit fur had been satinised to make
it smooth and glossy. The most amusing
fur-piece in the parade was a pair of
rabbit-fur matador pants, dyed a deep-
plum. These, for home entertaining,
were worn with a black jersey. There
was, of course, a showing of the more
luxurious pelts. Most expensive model
in the parade was a mink coat priced at
£2500.
From the managing-director down to
the smallest pageboy, the staff of Scott’s
Hotel were at Earl’s Court for the annual
staff dance, which is always held for the
funds of the aged and infirm blind. Mrs.
J. Stanley Smith, wife of the managing-
director of Scott’s Hotel, is an ardent
worker for this fund and, with her hus-
band, received the official guests. They
were Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Horsfall, John
Watts, of Nauru, Mollie Franklin (Gee-
long) and Mr. and Mrs. Richard Rigg.
Mrs. Smith’s lovely ice-blue satin gown
had sequins set on the bodice. Mrs.
Horsfall wore a floral printed satin gown,
and Mrs, Rigg a slim graceful gown of
burgundy lace. Among the dancers were
the ticket-secretaries, Pat Evans and Joan
Gilbert; also the president of the ball
committee, Eric Hale. Mrs. Derek
Goodall’s black tulle frock had copper-
bead trimming. Black sequins trimmed
the black crepes worn by Mrs. Ross
Hayes. Turquoise-blue faille was Mrs.
Hunter Smith’s choice. A ruby-red velvet
gown with the strapless bodice outlined
with white guipure lace was worn by
Mrs. David Allan, Mrs. G. Bunnell
topped her royal-blue skirt with a pale-
blue beaded bodice, Beth Brown’s ice-
blue satin had multicolored velvet flowers
scattered over the skirt. Hazel Mclvor’s
black velvet frock had blue and silver
beads massed on the top of the bodice.
Here is Mrs. David Raeburn-Brown, of
Broadley Park, Rosewood (N.S.W.), a
frequent visitor to this city, for she is the
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. K.
Burnside, of Toorak. Educated at
Merton Hall, she went on to the Uni-
versity to do a course in Social Service.
Mrs. Raeburn-Brown has two daughters,
Robin, who is five, and Lea, three.
A very small committee is organising
the Air Force Association Ball, to be
held at St. Kilda Town Hall on June 20.
All proceeds will be devoted to the Air
Force Memorial Centre. Mrs. Ned
Holland (XM1347) and Nancy Wood-
row (Win. 6674) are ticket-secretaries, and
president of the ball committee is Bruce
White. Bowen Harley, secretary of the Air
Force Association, is also on the com-
mittee. Mrs. Holland invites all ex-Air
Force personnel and present members of
that service to call at Air Force House,
in Flinders-lane, to book tables for the
ball. If that is not possible, the number
of Air Force House is Central 1916.
From Sydney
This week marks the end of Court
mourning, so we can hope to see the
vice-regal party at social functions once
more. The Governor is to be present at
the premiere of “Kangaroo” tonight
(which is in aid of Red Cross), and will
himself give a reception tomorrow night
at Government House. The dance at
Victoria Barracks on Friday should be
as vivid and spectacular as ever, with the
officers in all the glory of full-dress
uniform, and the girls no doubt dolled-up
to ma tch. It is hoped that the Governor
w ni be ab i e to at t en( j the Grand Gala
Opera night on June 14, when a selection
of the best bits of all the operas is to be
given. There are to be speeches,
streamers, cheers, and, though no one has
mentioned champagne, the atmosphere at
] eas t should be on the sparkling side.
In S ydney at preS ent is young, piquant
Patricia Walters, one of the stars of
“The River,” the technicolor picture
showing at the Esquire. Patricia (who is
16) comes from Adelaide, but has lived
for two years in Calcutta, where her
father, Mr. Cyril Walters, has an assign-
ment - When only 14 and a student at the
Loreto Convent, Calcutta, she answered
an advertisement for girls willing to act
in tbe and won tbe i ob on ber
appearance and personality, although ahe
M'SS'SSTS
make ’ and , wa3 directed by the famous
Jean Renoir. Patricia has come to
S y dne y to make P ersonal at
the Esquire for the next fortnight. She
was a very excited teenager when this
Letter met her, for she had just seen the
film for the first time, although it is two
years since it was made. Her ambition
now is to take up acting as a career.

Also in town this week is charming
“Miss Wagga,” whose real name is Jean
Burness. Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A.
D. Burness, of Tumbarumba, Jean is a
bookkeeper at Wagga, and is half-way
through her accountancy course. She
was chosen to represent Wagga on points
awarded for intelligence, deportment and
poise, as well as good looks. Her prize
is a nine-day holiday in Sydney, which
includes a meeting with the Premier,
morning-tea with the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress, a broadcast, a harbor
cruise and (of prime importance) a shop-
ping spree.
The opening night of “Tosca” brought
a masterpiece to light in a beautifully rich
setting, like an Old Master, and the most
ravishing clothes. Betty Fretwell added to
her lovely performance as Elsa in
“Lohengrin,” and became, with Marie
Collier and Barbara Wilson, one of the
special stars of the season. At the open-
ing of “Un Ballo in Maschera,” the
teenaged (in years and heart) were
entranced by Allen Ferris’s singing of
T Shall Behold Her Form Again,” but
began to think that they might prefer a
caveman after seeing Alan Light in the
third act. There is so much to praise in
the operas that it doesn’t seem churlish
to deplore the ballet in the third act of
this opera. Maybe 18th-century ladies
did wiggle their hips in the dance, but
the effect to our eyes is rather odd.
Talking of opera, there is to be a season
of six performances of “Boris Godounov”
(Moussorgsky) at the Con. starting June
10. Eugene Goossens is the conductor,
and there is to be a full orchestra and
chorus. Plans are now at Nicholsons and
Palings. The prices are nice and
moderate.
The opening by Mrs. Gregory Blaxland
of Francis Lymburner’s one-man show at
David Jones’s Gallery drew quite the
best-dressed crowd seen for some time at
an art exhibition. Francis is going to
Europe for further study, but where he
goes and how long he stays depends on
the success of the show—how many
pictures are sold, that is. The prices
marked weren’t very high, and if the
quality of the hats worn is any criterion,
the quality of the cheque-books present
should be more than equal to the
occasion. Among the artists present were
some very decorative in themselves,
slender red-headed Phillips Keane,
piquant Virginia Smith, gracious Leah
Ward, Elaine Haxton, Alice Danciger
and Anita Aarons. The Heslings, from
Castlecrag, were there, also the E. A.
Hardys. Hatless and easy on the eyes
were Annette Dunlop and Joyce Bianci.
Lady Anderson sandwiched the show in
between several committee meetings.
Mrs. Rex Money’s gorgeous emerald-
green coat was eyed enviously by several,
including this Letter. Other attention-
getters were Mrs. Bill Kendall in black
suit and small green hat, and Mrs.
Kendall, Snr,, in black velvet swing coat
with her unusual hat of oyster-colored
Italian angora.
Another redhead wearing pink was
seen at the Mercury’s production of
“Arms and the Man” this week, when
enchanting Diana Davidson tied a near-
cyclamen ribbon to her locks, and got
away with it very well. The Mercury
(which plays at St. James Hall) is now
running six plays currently, so that
theatre-lovers and visitors to the city can
see several plays in quick succession if
they want to. It’s an effort that
deserves applause and, better still, co-
operation. They’re calling for share-
holders, so it’s probably a good thing to
put a few of the spare sovereigns into.
The actors in the Mercury are paid, but
many of them sacrifice quite a lot of
filthy lucre to play in these worth-while
dramas and comedies, believing that
Sydney can do with a Community
Theatre.
There were about 450 guests for Mac
Falkiner to welcome at the Sheepbreeders’
cocktail-party at the Showground during
the week, including American Ambas-
sador Pete Jarman (who opened the
Sheep Show) and Mrs. Jarman, Mrs.
George Falkiner, Sir Norman Kater, the
Ivor Mantons (who couldn’t help look-
ing pleased, and who could blame them?),
the Fred Griffiths, of Albury, the R. B.
Robbs, of Deniliquin, Mrs. T. A. Field,
of Redhill, Gundagai, and Bellevue Hill,
who looked very smart and was accom-
panied by daughter Diana equally well-
dressed in a black-and-white turnout.
Noticed the H. H. Ingalls from Quirindi
with Miss Maud Bramley. Also Mrs.
Neilson Mills, of Burrabogie, Hay, with
Queensland visitors Mrs. D. M. Archer,
of Strathdarr, Longreach, her daughter
Claire, Mrs. R. R. Wedgwood and Miss
Robin Wedgwood, of Brisbane. The
buffet was designed in the generous
country style, with turkeys and sucking-
pigs ranged down the table in handsome
array. There wasn’t any lamb (that one
noticed, at any rate), but then there
wouldn’t be, would there, in that
assembly?
Burl Ives, inevitably being called
“Burly Ives,” is one of the personalities
of the day. He wears kilts (for preference,
mind you, and not because he’s a Scots-
man), sings folksongs, weighs a couple of
hundredweight and makes the bobby-
pearly wrote booby-) soxers swoon.
There is controversy about whether “The
Wild Colonial Boy” is one of our folk-
songs ; if not Burl will sing “Waltzing
Matilda” instead of it. But then there’s
controversy whether “Waltzing M.” is a
folksong either. Banjo Paterson made it
up. It didn’t “just grow.” Still, when
you come to think of it, every song must
have been made up sometime by some-
one, no matter how much it altered with
the years.
An additional feature of the Dragon
Festival Ball (scheduled for June 10) will
be the Chinese cakes, which are being
specially made. These cakes have not
been available to the public before, and
should be of interest to those who like
Chinese food. They include “Hop Too
Sue” (walnut shortbread), “Do Yeong
Sue” (flaky pastry with egg-paste filling),
“Yin Yeong Gock” (fancy spiced short-
bread) and “Yook Sun Sue” (spiced meat-
patties).

PERSONAL ITEMS
Joining the distinguished group of
British Army officers who have been
entitled to write C.I.G.S. after their
decorations—Slim, Montgomery, Alan-
brooke, Dill—General Sir John Harding
goes to that eminent post from command
of the British Army of the Rhine. At
the start of War I a ranker in the
Somerset Light Infantry, at its end (hav-
ing served on Gallipoli) he had command
of the regiment’s Ist Battalion. Tobruk
rodents will recall him as the famed
7th Armored Division leader who
considered that the best way to fight a
battle was in the leading tank. He led
his armor from Alamein westward, was
wounded outside Tripoli in the epic
pursuit, and got on his legs again in time
to be Alexander’s Chief-of-Staff in the
final stages of the Italian campaign. M.C.-
winner of War I, D.S.O. and two Bars
in War 11, Harding is the sort of officer
who relies more on his personality than
on what he has on his shoulders.
Father of the founder of the “Border
Morning Mail,” Albury, which celebrates
its 50th anniversary next year, was the
George Mott who, as proprietor of
Hamilton (Vic.) “Spectator,” paid J. F.
Archibald the first money he ever earned
as a freelance. Archibald, who was then
on Warrnambool (Vic.) “Standard,”
IN FROM ALBURY.
went from Warrnambool to found
The Bulletin ; Mott went from Hamilton
to help found Gordon and Gotch, world-
wide publishers and distributors. John
S. Gotch was running a newspaper busi-
ness in Melbourne, George Mott, who
had previously founded the “Border
Post” in Albury in 1856 and had seen his
plant go under floodwaters that year,
had sold out there and gone to
Hamilton. When he went to join Gotch
two of his sons, Hamilton (the ninth and
born in Hamilton) and Decimus, the
tenth, went to West Australia and started
the “Western Argus” at what was then
Hannan’s, but is now Kalgoorlie. Both,
however, had cherished a notion of show-
ing Albury what the Motts could do with
a newspaper, and in 1903 they founded
the “Border Morning Mail.” Unlike
most country papers, which usually begin
as weeklies or bi-weeklies and become
dailies as the district grows, the “Mail”
was a daily from the start. Population
of Albury was then about 6000 ; today the
city boasts 15,000 and the “Mail” carries
the news to a district of around 80,000
people on both sides of the Murray.
Hamilton C, Mott (depicted herewith),
still active and alert at 81, beat the paper
by a year with his golden jubilee. He
was married in Melbourne on May 27,
1902, and spent his honeymoon in Sydney,
The other day he and Mrs. Mott were in
Sydney for their jubilee. The “Mail’ is
now run by his sons, and it is no
exaggeration to describe it as one of the
brightest dailies in the country.
“Macnell”: First carrier Theseus, then
Triumph, then Glory, then Sydney, estab-
lished records for daily sorties over
Korea. Now carrier Ocean has beaten all
four —with a remarkable effort of 123
sorties in one day, beating Glory’s record
of 105 sorties. Ocean’s pilots destroyed
three railway-bridges, an oil-fuel dump,
many gun-emplacements, 15 vehicles
crammed with ammunition, and clewed
up rocketing troop-encampments. And
Ocean had been only four days in the
operating area. Captain Charles Evans,
Ocean’s driver, served as a fighter-pilot
in carriers for the Norwegian and
Dunkirk campaigns, as well as in the
Mediterranean and Pacific, collecting
D.S.C., D.S.O. and three “mentions.” As
added qualification, he went to Ocean
from the Directorship of the Air Warfare
Division at the Admiralty. Forty-seven,
he is the son of a major, grandson of a
general, and he married a general’s
daughter
The Toowoomba (Q.) Literary Society
proposes to honor A. G. Stephens with a
plaque or panel set in the wall of the
Town Hall. Stephens was born in the
Downs city in 1865, and died in Sydney
in 1933. Schooled at Toowoomba
Grammar, he started earning in the print-
ing department of the city’s “Chronicle,”
edited several Queensland papers, had a
look at Britain and the Continent, and
returned to Australia, to join The
Bulletin and develop its Red Page. Sub-
scriptions to the memorial fund may be
sent to Mrs. Margaret Curran, of the
Toowoomba Literary Society.
“1.M.”: John Bails, who passed on in
Adelaide the other day, probably did
more than any other man to preserve the
Village Settlements from folding up
earlier than they did. Bails was super-
cargo on Oliver’s trading-steamer Pyap
in the late ’nineties, and called at all the
settlements, which were semi-social-
istic attempts by the S.A. Government to
settle the unemployed of Adelaide along
the banks of the Murray. The settlers
had no money, and although the Govern-
ment gave them orders with which to
purchase groceries, they were allowed
none for drapery. Bails began a system
under which the settlers ordered more
groceries than they needed, and traded
them to the Pyap for drapery and other
goods. The first transaction was with a
woman, who exchanged six bottles of
pink pills for several pairs of cashmere
stockings. After that a visit of the Pyap
to any settlements would see men coming
from all directions, with boxes of soap
and such on their shoulders. The game
lasted until the Inspector of Village
Settlements realised settlers were order-
ing enough soap to wash everyone on the
Murray, and nosed out the reason for it.
Preferences gave North Province seat in
the Westralian Legislative Council to an
ex-Naval Labor man, C. W. D. Barker,
five votes ahead of the retiring L.C.L.
member, R. M. Forrest. A first-timer in
Parliament, Barker is a thickset 47, with
experience by land and sea. Since 1920
he has covered most of his far-flung
constituency, shearer, stockman and a
host of other things. In War II he was
afloat in many parts of the world in the
R.A.N. Paid-off in 1946, he became
Government Stock Inspector at Derby
(W.A.); and, till recently, was doing
research work into the Kimberley horse-
disease at the Fitzroy Crossing Labora-
tory. Other jobs were membership of
the Kimberley Road Board and secretary-
treasurership of the Derby R.S.L.
“Cauboy”: This month orchestras
throughout the world will be celebrating
the 70th birthday of Igor Stravinsky, the
one-time enfant terrible of music, the
first performance of whose “Rite of
Spring” caused anguished balletomanes to
nearly wreck the theatre. Born at
Oranienbaum, near Leningrad, the son of
a Russian singer, he burst into the
limelight with his “Firebird” and
“Petroushka” ballets. They still hold the
boards; his opera “Rossignol” doesn’t.
Though more or less the founder of the
modern movement with its atonality and
discords, he could write traditional music.
Australian radio-stations are girding their
mikes to give us a burst of Stravinsky
next month ; Melbourne has in its new
conductor, Juan Castro, one of the lead-
ing exponents of Stravinsky’s music. 'Hie
composer lives in Hollywood.
The most indefatigable prizewinner in
the Australian art world must be 30-year-
old Melbourne artist Charles Bush. He
won his first event with the Grace Joel
half-a-nude prize while a student at the
National Gallery in 1939, and for the
next four years used his brush and pencil
on artillery survey and camouflage.
Demobbed, he resumed his prizewinning
career in 1945 with the Crouch oil-prize,
was an official war-artist for a year and
then won the Minnie Crouch prize, as
well as Albury, Bendigo and Perth com-
petitions, A year hasn’t passed since
without his work attracting the favoring
eyes of judges. The other day he ran
third (£100) in the Dunlop art-contest in
Melbourne and first (another 100 guineas)
in the Melrose prize in Adelaide,

affair), several destroyers and cruiser
Australia. When, in 1934, the R.A.N.,
perpetuating a famous name, bought a
six-inch cruiser and named it Sydney,
Wishart stood-by its building and was
appointed engineer-officer on completion.
Engineering boss of Garden Island when
the Allied anchors dropped in Tokyo
Bay, Wishart had the big post-war job of
repair and conversion of Westralia,
Manoora and other merchantmen which
had temporarily worn the White Ensign.
He entered the Navy, with an engineer-
ing diploma from the S. Australian
School of Mines, close on 40 years ago.
He collected a C.B.E. in 1950.
Closing his account with the National
Bank, Leslie James McConnan opened
it as a clerk back in 1904, at the age of
17. It took him just 10 years to climb
to a branch-managership. Well on the
lee side of 50 when he became chief-
manager, he raked in his banking
experience through State-managerships,
in S. Australia and N.S.W., with a period
in charge in London. In his 17 years as
chief-manager he raked in, as well,
considerable business —the bank’s assets
having grown from £47 million in 1935
OUT TO GRASS.
to £2BB million in 1951. Born at Benalla
(Vic.), 65 years ago, he is much more
genial than he looks in this drawing.
He worked particularly hard in
the fight against the Chifley Govern-
ment’s attempted bank-grab, has been
three times chairman of the Associated
Banks of Victoria, and received a K.B.
last year.
Herewith (by Prior), Keith Donald,
who will manage the track-and-field-
runners of the athletic section leaving
shortly for the Helsinki Olympics. On
the professional side 8.A., LL.B. and a
solicitor in Sydney’s Martin-place, in the
line of his present job Donald has
lifted his six-feet-odd to some purpose
over athletic hurdles Australian
hurdles champion in 1935, and between
OFF TO HELSINKI.
1935 and 1938 Sydney University
champion in the same field. Donald had
hardly been admitted as a solicitor, in
1939, when he was admitted to the sterner
advocacy of the coast-artillery, in which
he served in Darwin. Earlier,
stationed at the proving-ground at
Port Wakefield, north of Adelaide,
he tested ordnance from two- to
25-pounders, as well as the pene-
trative powers of 2501 b. bombs, fired from
an old German howitzer. Before he
reaches Helsinki Donald will take his
team through Scotland, North Ireland
and France, running en route. An
athletic-looking 37, he’s had 25 years
with the Boy Scouts, but gave that away,
perforce, to look after a cub-pack of his
own —three boys and a girl.
On the eve of the Australian team’s
leaving for Helsinki, Percy Nette gets the
organising - secretaryship of the 1956
Olympics in Melbourne. Taking his first
kick at Myrtleford (Vic.) just on 60 years
ago, Nette joined the Treasury in 1911,
and has been mixed up with money ever
since—official receiver in N.S.W., chief-
accountant to the National Insurance
Commission, the Treasury’s chief investi-
gating officer, and, in 1949, its first
assistant-secretary. It all started with a
Diploma of Commerce from Melbourne
University.
Into the Silence:
At 72, in Melbourne, Robert Baker, vice-
chairman of the Moonee Valley Racing Club.
A product of Eton and Cambridge, he had been
on the club-committee for more than 20 years,
held interests in a grazing property at Berwick
(Vic.), and raced Altimeter, which won the
1928 Adelaide Cup. His father was Sir Richard
Baker, first president of the Senate and one-
time president of the S.A. Legislative Council.
At Whatawhata, Waikato (N.Z.), at 84, Waata
Erueti, chief of the Ngati Mahanga and Maori
historian and orator. He was one of the few
natives to be awarded an 0.8. E.
At Broken Hill, at 73, William Heywood,
a solid stanchion of the city’s social and com-
mercial life. Bom in Manchester (Eng.), he
landed in Australia from a windjammer, found
his way to the West Darling district and
anchored there. With a firm of warehousemen
at the beginning, he then used to travel
hundreds of miles in a sulky over bush-tracks
after orders. For years he managed the Broken
Hill firm of G. Wood and Son.
In Melbourne, at 71, Boer War veteran
George Sutherland Williamson, a few days
before the 50th anniversary of the signing ot
the Boer War peace-treaty. He had 45 years
in the Victorian police-force. His son is a
commissioner of the Presbyterian Church in S.
Australia.
At Beaconsfield (Tas.), at 84, F. L. Wood-
ward, world-famed Buddhist scholar. Prin-
cipal of a Buddhist school in Ceylon years
ago, he left it to follow the founder ol his
faith by retiring to the banks of the Tamar,
near Launceston, where he lived the life of a
recluse in a neglected orchard, fetching his
bread and milk from a post-office four miles
distant. He had a library of thousands of
original Buddhist scriptures written on palm-
leaf, and the Oxford Press has printed 25 of
his translations. He was a Cambridge man.

Million Dollar Story
One of the greatest sea-
dramas in Mercantile Marine
history was the sinking of the
Flying Enterprise in December
last year. Day by day, press,
radio and newsreel told the
story to the world. Millions
were thrilled as they literally
watched Captain Carlsen’s
heroic fight to save his ship.
June Reader’s Digest brings
you the other story behind this
epic drama —the battle between
500 newspapermen and news-
reel cameramen to be first with
the news how reporters
braved storms, seasickness,
took incredible risks to cover
the story.
This is just one of 32 stimu-
lating articles in June Reader’s

GUARANTEED NEVER TO FADE OR SHRINK
THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Wool and Synthetics.
“C.S.”: The prediction that
synthetics will supplant a major
part of wool-consumption in the
near future is viewed with ex-
treme scepticism by the U.S.A.
magazines “Fortune” and “Busi-
ness Week.”
A claim that synthetics will
replace one billion pounds of
wool within the next 10-20 years
is “not supported by facts,”
according to “Fortune.” “Busi-
ness Week” points out that “the
best all-round fibres are the ones
that have been around longest—
wool and cotton.”
Assessing claims for synthetics,
“Fortune” says: “The public,
which for centuries sat upon,
trod upon and kept itself warm
and happy with wool, is being
told that it can be happy, even
ecstatic, walking on an extrusion
of wood-pulp or clothing itself
in a mixture of adipic acid and
hexamethethylenediamine (which
one copywriter referred to as
TOO p.c. virgin nylon.’ Nylon
is about as virginal as, say, a
dish of spaghetti.)
“The chemical industries
loudly disclaim any intention of
driving the sheep out. That is
only logical. In their internecine
war the synthetic-makers need
wool to exploit their own pro-
ducts. They are, in effect, riding
into new textile fields on the
backs of sheep. Their friendly
feeling toward sheep will con-
tinue just as long as there is not
available in vast quantities any
man-made equivalent of wool.”
“Business Week” said: “A
textile engineer puts it this way,
‘lf the only fibres we knew up
to now were the synthetics and
somebody suddenly discovered
cotton and wool, cotton and
wool would be hailed as miracle
fibres.’ ”
Root-crops for Storage.
“Pat Ater”: Winter carrots
pay good dividends. In the mild
districts sow the seed now and
with warmth and water growth
will be rapid and the roots
tender. Deep digging is essential
—and a finely-broken, lump-free
soil.
Unless you can give the
carrots plenty of plant-food, in
balanced ration to build both
top-growth and rootstock, they
will disappoint with woody
centres and small girth.
Ground which has been
loaded with animal or other
organic manure is ideal for
carrots and parsnips. Add a
super ration at a heaped handful
to the yard and work it well
down. Don’t waste fertiliser by
broadcasting it. Every grain
should be within root-reach.
That means in a 3in. or 4in.
band. If dry wood-ashes are
available add them for their
potash content.
Parsnips like identical con-
ditions, but prefer more lime —
a generous dressing dug in with
the fertilisers. For parsnips dig-
ging and breaking must be down
to 12in. or 15in. at least —more
in cooler climates with deep
soils.
Seed of parsnip needs an inch
of soft, free soil-cover with a
sifted manure or sand topping to
avoid caking. Sow generously
in drills (an inch deep), and after
covering firm well with hand-
pressure. That contacts soil and
seeds, and a thorough watering
consummates the union. Until
shoots appear, in maybe two to
three weeks, the surface must be
kept moist.
Carrot-seeds are less tardy and
slightly less fussy, but wogs and
snail pounce on them in infancy.
Keep your eyes skinned for
little green shoots and dust them
early. Surface-moisture must be
maintained.
Both these crops need 18in.
between rows—running north
and south—and thinning out to
4in. or Sin. apart can be done
as growth proceeds. Home-beds
can be culled for sweet small
roots for soups as they grow.
Storage of carrots and
parsnips in dry sand-pits, or
straw and sand in sheds or boxes,
assures a regular supply over
winter. They are a welcome
change from the übiquitous
pumpkin-and-spud diet.
Sub.-clover Pastures.
“Mr.”: Experiments at
Rutherglen experiment - farm
(Vic.) showed that by concentra-
ting stock on a pasture at cer-
tain times of the yeat the pro-
portion of grass to sub.-clover
could be greatly altered within
a season or two. Heavy graz-
ing in the autumn reduced the
clover, allowing grasses to pre-
dominate. On the other hand
lenient treatment of the pastures
in autumn increased the amount
of clover available for grazing
in late winter and spring.
This indicates that, for suc-
cessful maintenance of a sub.-
clover pasture in districts similar
to Rutherglen (rainfall 23in.), it
is advisable not to overgraze in
autumn and if stocking is heavy
it is better to hand-feed for a
time at this season.
Topdress with |cwt. super, to
the acre in the early years, later
reducing to fcwt. applied in
alternate years. Heavier dressings
applied more frequently have
resulted in increased pasture-
growth but are not considered
economic.
A Cattle Shew.
“P. Angus”: Second annua
fat-cattle show of Sydney R.A.S
attracted about 250 steers of
various breeds. Generally, the
were somewhat better finishes;
than those of last year and uni
formity of most of the pens wa
marked, Hereford, Shorthorn and
Aberdeen-Angus blood, boi
straight and in the crosses, pre
dominated.
The R.A.S. runs the show it
an effort mainly to put before
breeders better standards a
which to aim and to show smal
farmers —that is, men who can
run a dozen or so of beef —tha
there’s money in it if done
properly. This is but the second
showing; so far there is keen
and growing interest, but it will
probably be another three years
before real results appear.
Good Shorthorns.
“Frank H.”: From Ursino,
in “the comer,” a mob of 600
Shorthorn mixed sexes, ranging
from 20-months-old heifers to
four-year-old bullocks, set out
by road, came down the Paroo,
crossed the Darling at Wilcannia
and travelled via Ivanhoe and
Hay to Deniliquin store-stock
"Put a coupler chocks under me feet , Charlie; I'm slippin '."
market, more than 500 miles.
Under the hammer at Denili-
quin, four-year-old bullocks sold
to £35 11s.; three-year-olds to
£36 165.; 22-24-month steers to
£33 165.; 20-month-old steers
£2B 65.; heifers
£25 11s.; 20-month heifers £2O
65.; and 15-month-old heifers
£l6 Is.
The bullocks and steers were
bought for finishing in Riverina
and Victoria, while the females
were sought for breeding. Such
a trip is possible only in a good
season.
Galvanised Burr.
“Burro”: Flooding of plain
country in N.S.W. and large
movement of stock during sub-
sequent drought have together
spread galvanised-burr over
thousands of acres of , new
area.
Attempts to keep it under
control by laborious and costly
burr-cutting have failed.
Experiments at Hermidale by
E. G. Cuthbertson, agronomist
of N.S.W. Department of Agri-
culture, have indicated that
control is likely with the amine
and ester forms of 2,4-D, which
gave better results than the
sodium salt.
Unfortunately for landholders
with meagre water-supplies, low-
volume water application of the
amine salt was not so effective,
but kerosene was found suitable
as a formulation.
Foulbrood and Drugs.
“Stinger”; It is known that
bacteria of foulbrood of bees
pass through a spore stage
which has proved resistant to
some of the common therapeutic
chemicals. These spores germin-
ate in the bodies of the bee
larvae and grow and multiply
until they kill this brood. By
then the bacteria have changed
again into resistant spores which
infect other larvae and so con-
tinue the cycle.
The action of the sulpha drug
when introduced into the food
of the larvae is stated to have
the effect of preventing these

Wheeled Tractor
Sounds unbelievable a 45 h.p.
wheeled tractor pulling 362 tons
from a standing start but this
actual test was carried out at the
Shell Refinery in Sydney —on 7th
May when the famous Hanomag
R-45 tractor pulled this enormous
load of five full oil tankers.
Here is the New Way to save money
on materials handling a way to
fight rising production costs —to
move goods faster more economi-
cally. It doesn’t matter what business
you are in, Hanomag tractors can
help you by adding man-hours with-
out increasing manpower.
It can convey goods by trailer safely
and quickly, for Hanomag’s road
speed is 15 m.p.h. in sth gear its
maximum drawbar pull in Ist gear
is 6,722 lbs.—and fuel consumption
is 1 gallons of Diesel Oil an hour
—hourly fuel cost of only 3/-.

resistant spores from germinat-
ing, thus breaking the cycle.
Therapeutic antibiotics failed to
do this.
If sulpha drugs had failed to
control American foulbrood in
bees (B. 23 /4/’52), it seems
hardly likely that they would
continue to be recommended.
Fodder-tree Scheme.
“Hav.”: N.S.W. Forestry
Advisory Council wants the
Government to assist farmers
willing to undertake mass
production of fodder trees. A
similar scheme is going well in
Britain, where tree-planters get
a subsidy from the Government.
If such trees had dotted the
land in the recent drought, thou-
sands of stock would have been
saved and erosion held at bay.
Outside irrigation areas, stock
without fodder trees are doomed
from the start of a drought.
Cash value of the stock lost
through drought since the be-
ginning of the century would
have made many water-conserva-
tion works possible.
Government aid would stimu-
late interest in fodder-tree plant-
ing. Assistance with fencing
costs alone would ensure thou-
sands of trees going in. In
districts to which they are in-
digenous all our fodder trees are
hardy. Deep taproot of the
kurrajong enables it to flourish
well in areas of lOin. rainfalls.
Boree, mulga, whitewood and
other valuable trees could be
mass-grown in suitable districts.
Rot of Tomatoes.
“Myrrhee”: A rot of
tomatoes which appears as large,
sunken, putty-colored or dark-
brown patches at the blossom-
end of the fruit is common in
northern Victoria. The patch ex-
tends deeply into the fruit, caus-
ing the affected tissue to shrink,
and makes the fruit unfit for
market.
This rot is caused by extreme
variations in soil-moisture, and
can be prevented by keeping the
water up to the plants at all
stages of growth. Mulching and
cultivation to keep the soil-
moisture content fairly even
help to control it.
Worm-drenching.
“Liss”: The nicotine-blue-
stone drench is effective against
worms in sheep if the strength is
right and technique correct.
Mix lib. of bluestone and 16fl.
ozs. of nicotine to sgal. of water
(adult sheep dose 20z.). The main
point is to get the dose into the
abomasum or fourth stomach,
and not let it get lost and diluted
in the rumen, or paunch.
Food eaten by sheep and
other ruminants goes direct to
the rumen and remains there
until regurgitated and chewed
the second time. A sort of valve
in the throat then closes and the
rechewed food, as swallowed,
passes to the fourth stomach.
This valve is the oesophageal
groove, and it has been found
that within a few seconds of
bluestone coming into contact
with the tongue or palate this
groove closes by reflex action.
If two drenching-guns are
available, the best method is for
one man to give the sheep a
small shot of concentrated blue-
stone solution (say lib. to Igal.)
keeping three or four sheep
ahead of the principal operator,
who is administering the drench,
The first shot closes the
oesophageal valve and the second
—the real drench—goes straight
to the fourth stomach. This
method will give at least 80 p.c.
results. The remainder will be
chronic worm cases, and for
them the remedy is the more
expensive phenothiazine.
Hints for the Farm.
“Composto”: Correspondents
of Adelaide papers say that
onions planted under peaches
and nectarines will give the trees
additional protection against
aphis and curl-leaf. Gardeners
who claim to have tried it say
there’s enough truth in the story
to make it worth a trial.
“Springvale”: It’s essential to
begin handfeeding of sheep
early, to do it thoroughly, and
not to terminate it for some time
a fter the grass has had a B ood
start. It should never be
delayed until the sheep begin to
lose condition.
“Billjim”: To help winter egg-
production, keep a tin of pure
meatmeal in front of the fowls
at all times. Colds are a limiting
factor, so pens should not be
allowed to become stuffy,
draughty or damp. Dry litter
will help considerably. If ade-
quate greenfeed is not available
use a fish oil in the mash.
“W. Court”: Hard-boiled
eggs chopped fine and mixed
with breadcrumbs make a good
emergency food for unexpected
chicks. Minced meat, pollard-
mash and greenstuff are all
good ; so is a bit of well-cracked
corn or wheat. It’s seldom long
before bush-bred chicks, run-
ning about the farm, manage for
themselves.
“Bill C.”: Leaving dug
potatoes on the ground for any
length of time is risky. If potato-
moth is about it will soon find
them and lay its eggs. Sacks that
have previously contained
potatoes should be boiled before
being used again.
“Hortus”: Put about a tea-
spoonful of salt into two quarts
of wet mash. If fowls have a
fair amount of salt they will not
pick each other.
“A-Jay”: Make nests of
sufficient depth to provide pro-
tection and a certain amount
of seclusion while hens are lay-
ing. Shallow nests cause restless-
ness and fighting and encourage
vices such as vent-picking, can-
nibalism and feather-picking.
Shallow nests cannot hold suf-
ficient nesting material, and
sometimes the birds scratch out
the little that is there, causing
egg-breakages.
“Billjim”: Trials have demon-
strated that pasture-seed may
more effectively be introduced
into unprepared tussock-grass-
land by use of a grain-drill,
coulters of which are fitted with
special penetrating points. Ad-
vantages of the tips over stan-
dard drill-points are that they
ensure better and more even
penetration, provide a good
cover for the seed, and are self-
clearing.
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
A new southern sunspot appeared on May 25, but it is
not as yet a very disturbing type, and will not reach its
normally active position for some days. By then changes are
possible. It was these changes in the earlier spot that made
it give important rains by creating a disturbed condition
when the cyclical rains were drawing near. They are due
in June. Now the cycles show a colder spell with frosts,
extending into June, after which more showers are likely.

Some Incentive.
“If mothers were paid the basic

overtime they would earn more than
£3O a week.” — Sydney preacher Rev.
Gordon Powell.
When mother washes endless
lines of nappies
Or irons a heavy basketful of
clothes.
Mends shirts and trousers for
tree-climbing chappies
And calmly handles jobs that
mere man loathes,
She takes upon herself the thank-
less onus
Of dull routine responsibilities,
Her sole emolument the baby-
bonus
To help her win to affluence
and ease.
No doubt she’d think a union-
mogul funny
Who strove to make her wages
thirty quid
With overtime, and dirt- or
danger-money,
But one day she’ll rebel and
lift the lid.
And mother, then, an indepen-
dent being,
Will flaunt the flag of liberty
unfurled

“Be fussy rather than lavish with
roses. A few well-kept standard types
are more productive and decorative
than a labyrinth of neglected
varieties.” — Gardening note.
I planted roses, dear, to mark
your charms. Pink Radiance,
the blush upon your cheeks to
imitate; sweet Gaiety I chose
from all the rest to symbolise
your smile. And lovely Cale-
donia bespeaks the whiteness of
your throat and shoulders, while
shy Rapture bears her blossoms
to express the thrill and shade
and softness of your lips. And
what more deep or fragrant
token blows than Talisman my
love to signify?
Shot Silk and Lady Sylvia are
psalms to your ethereal grace;
whilst Madame Butterfly, in
apricot and gold, proclaims your
air of elegance. And finally, a
rose of flawless form and gor-
geous saffron hue, Fantasia, in
reverence I grew to match the
golden glory of your hair. These
beauties bloom where stood a
wilderness, though none, I swear,
your beauty may eclipse.
I planted rose-trees, dear, with
“I know that I'm not entitled to wear 'em, but they lend a
touch of color, don't you think?"
loving care and nice perception,
meaning to attune them as in-
struments of my regard for you.
And now, confound my frenzy,
I must prune them!

I.Q. Test for a Fireman.
1. —You are awakened out of
a deep sleep to hear the alarm-
bell ringing for your first fire.
You are naturally rather con-
fused, and in the excitement of
the occasion you leap out of
bed and rush into your dinner-
suit instead of your uniform.
You are almost dressed before
you realise your mistake, and by
then it is too late to change, as
the engine is about to leave the
station. Would you consider it
compatible with the dignity of
the service to strap your toma-
hawk around your soup-and-fish,
or would you deem it more fit-
ting to slip it in your hip pocket?
2. —You have been planing
some wood in your quarters at
the station, and, deeply absorbed
in your hobby, you must have
thoughtlessly flicked a lighted
cigarette-butt among the shav-
ings. You go out to get some
more wood, and when you get
back you find that the curtains
and bedding are well alight. It
would, you realise, be far too
disturbing to your fellows to rush
downstairs shouting “Fire! ”
Detail the steps you would take,
therefore, to slip out and ring
the station from the nearest
street-alarm.
3. —You are playing poker
with three other firemen. The
dealer sits pat; another nas
called for two cards; the third
fellow has drawn only one card,
upon seeing which he sinks back
in his chair trying to dissemble
his pleasure. You cautiously
open your hand to find that you
have clicked for the middle pin
of a routine flush.
You open with a modest bet.
The cove who sat on threes
promptly doubles your bid ; the
next one kicks it, and the dealer
unhesitatingly doubles. You up
it again, and it is kicked up
again right around the board.
The third time round you double
again, the second man peeks, the
fellow who sat on threes ups it
again, thus confirming your con-
viction that he has clicked for
his fourth card, for a royalty,
and the dealer gives it another
boost. Your mouth’s beginning
to water at sight of the kitty,
and you just kick it up again
when the alarm-bell rings madly
and everyone leaps up. Write a
treatise, using asbestos paper,
and the theme “The Call of
Duty.”
4. —You are attending a big
conflagration, and are on the
nozzle when somebody behind
you calls out your name. In
swinging around the hose natur-
ally comes with you, the stream
catching the fire-chief, who is
directing operations 10 yards
away, in the chest, bowling him
over. Would you use foam to
put the language out?
5. —A new recruit has come
to the station, in anticipation of
which you have suitably treated
the pole, down which he has to
practise sliding to the ground
floor, with glue. Before he
can make his first slide, how-
ever, the station-chief comes up
with a politician he is showing
around. The visitor announces
he would like to try the slide out,
and he leaps for the pole. Undei
the circumstances, would you
feel that, while someone was
endeavoring to prise his fingers
off it, it would be an appropriate
time to go and change a library-
book?
6. —You are on the ladder,
and you find that on the second
floor of the building, which is
well alight, but not yet danger-
ously so, two people are trapped.
One is a middle-aged woman of
about 13 stone ; the other is a
nifty, shapely eight-stone blonde.
You call for the canvas, and in-
struct the middle-aged woman to
jump first. After an hysterical
scene you get her to the window,
and she successfully negotiates
the descent. State whether you
would consider that the canvas
might be so weakened by this
jump that you would find it
more prudent to make the de-
scent down the ladder with the
blonde, first instructing her that
she must conform with the safety
rules laid down by the Board
of Commissioners by putting her
arms around your neck until you
get to the ground. Explain, also,
why, under such circumstances;
your descent should be very slow
and cautious.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
job than his own pay-envelope.—HIST
(N.S.W.).
Worker and Boss
Surely the prejudice against “Aus-
tralian-made” is no longer strong enough
t 0 worry about. There will always
be a few snobs who claim that
nothing but the imported article is good
enough, but, generally, the Australian is
rather proud that most of what he needs'
is now made in this country. Certain
imported articles will always excel our
own; but that is no reflection on the
Australian worker —the superiority is
generally due to such causes as access to
better raw materials, wider markets per-
mitting the use of more costly machinery
or the simple fact that one country has
always specialised in certain lines.
When it comes to relations between
worker and boss it is worth remembering
that two revolutions have been taking
place in our time, and that our social
and economic structures have not yet
settled down under the new conditions.
The state where the boss was supreme
has been replaced by one where the
power is divided 50-50, if indeed it has
not swung across centre to the worker’s
end.
Out of the residue of resentment from
the days when the boss was dictator
springs much of the industrial unreason-
ableness shown by the worker today, and
it is on this resentment that Reds and
political Labor leaders play. When
workers become accustomed to their new
power —as they are already doing—and
exercise it with the commonsense with
which the majority of them are endowed,
we should see a notable stabilisation in
industrial relations. It should be noted,
too, that not a few bosses have failed to
accept the new conditions with grace.
The other change concerns the dis-
appearance of the individual employer,
his place being taken by a corporation.
In most of our important industries the
personal relationship of master and
servant no longer exists ; the boss is now
a limited-liability company and the
worker a number on the pay-roll. That
is where you find industrial trouble; not
in the small individual concerns.
Vare, in one of his books, has
written “The tradition of affection
between master and servant... .is
disappearing”; and again “Today in
most countries the individual servant
merges into a mass proletariat paid
by the hour.” Not only has the
worker for a corporation no contact with
an individual master; he is also largely
deprived of the pride of individual work-
manship. No one man now makes an
article; it is the product of a chain of
nameless workers. In fact, the only thing
about his employment which is entirely
his is his pay-envelope. No wonder his
interest is centred on that.
There is no possibility of ever return-
ing to the old master-servant personal
relationship. What may take its place is
the development of the team-spirit among
the employees of corporations. It is to
this end that there is increasing emphasis
on the provision of “amenities” —sports,
social and cultural clubs which should
give the worker a wider interest in his
From the U.S.A.
When I lived in Australia I often
heard people say that cotton and tobacco
should be grown in Queensland. Why
pass the buck to Queensland? Here in
the U.S.A. snow falls on threequarters
of the land on which cotton is grown,
and on nine-tenths of the tobacco land.
The cotton is far better than that
grown in any tropical or sub-tropical
country except Egypt. Nearly everyone
prefers cigarettes made of American
tobacco to those made of anything grown
in the tropics. Cuba may produce better
cigars, but the same kind of tobacco is
poor for cigarettes. Cotton and tobacco
should grow anywhere in Australia where
anything else is grown, and the qualities
of both would be best if grown in the
southern parts.
The Americans once had the problem
of several railway gauges, but they solved
it around 1880. One railway outfit in the
southern States did the job in one day 1
It selected a Sunday and offered
to hire any and all men living along the
“Whaffor you pinchie my hat?"
route who wanted to make an extra day’s
wages. The day was late in the autumn,
after harvest-time, so that farmers could
work, too. Everyone in the vicinity knew
that the standardisation of the gauge
would help him, so the day’s wages were
not the only incentive. — Hugh Morrison
(New Jersey, U.S.A.).
Insurance
“Ceg” (B. 14/5/’52) falls into a
common error when he makes his calcu-
lations on total premium income figures
for fire, accident and marine insurance
companies as they appear in State or
Federal “Statistical Bulletins.”
Premium income shown there repre-
sents the total premiums paid or receiv r
able in a particular calendar year, but
the only portion of this amount insurance
companies can take into their books is
the amount of premium actually earned.
In other words there is an outstanding
liability for the unexpired portion of
each policy in existence at any given
tiri To arrive at a reasonably accurate
assessment of total premium earned in
any calendar year, it is accepted practice
to take 40 per cent, of the previous year’s
income and add it to 60 per cent, of the
current year’s income.
Applying that to the figures “Ceg”
quotes, the actual underwriting surplus
for 1949-50 is reduced by £3,200,000 to
£6,800,000 over 150 companies. No one
will deny that this is still a good result,
but insurance business, fire business par-
ticularly, is subject to extremely bad
cycles, and it is from such “good years”
that reserves are built up to meet the
inevitable catastrophes.
During 1950-51 insurance companies
in Australia issued cover exceeding
£600,000,000 on the record wool clip. Up
to £10,000,000-worth of wool was housed
in single stores. The complete loss of
one such store would have absorbed
almost the whole fire-premium income of
all companies for the year.
That single example shows the risks
faced and the wisdom, in the policy-
holders’ interests, of maintaining fire-
insurance premiums at a reasonable but
adequate level. Insurance Expert
(Vic.).
Butter
The facts about the “butter-strike”
charge which M. F. Dixon levels against
farmers (B. 7/5/’52) are as follows:
The tribunal set up by the Chifley Gov-
eminent, and continued by Menzies, to fix
prices on cost of production had recom-
mended a substantial rise. The Federal
Government said it would continue the
existing subsidy, but would not increase
it. That meant a rise in the retail price
to 3s. l|d. But in the meantime price-
control had reverted to the States, and
two of them refused to grant the full rise.
For three months they refused to listen
to any argument or to look at the
evidence freely offered by the tribunal.
In those circumstances the farmers,
who had all along been prepared to sell
at cost of production on the home market
and to Britain, even though higher prices
were offered elsewhere, decided that,
rather than sell at a loss, they would
export all their butter. The Queensland
Government countered by rushing
through a smash-and-grab law confiscat-
ing all butter as soon as it was made, and
threatening to destroy the whole organisa-
tion of the dairying industry. Then,
perhaps feeling that it had gone too far,
it suddenly reversed its stand and
announced that it would investigate cost
of production as an urgent matter. As
all the evidence was available, that only
took a few days, and as a result the price
sought was granted. If an illegal strike
be defined as defiance of a legally con-
stituted tribunal, it was the Queensland
and N.S.W. Governments, not the dairy-
men, who were on strike.
At no time did the dairymen stop work,
as “M.F.D.” suggests. What did happen
was that they, battling with drought,
found they could not afford to feed their
cows for production at the price they
were receiving. So they dried most of
them off to give them a better chance of
survival on what they could pick up. As
any stockman knows, cattle in low con-
dition do not breed freely, so many of
those cows have not yet calved again,
and, though the drought is over, produc-
tion remains low.
The gibe about world-parity prices
when these are low is equally unjustified.
Ask any wheatgrower what he got during
the depression. It was only when prices
rose that Governments showed any real
interest in controlling them, and their
enthusiasm will doubtless wane as quickly
when a recession comes.
The root of the trouble seems to be the
Socialist theory that farmers should be
servants of the Government, doing what
they are told and accepting a living-wage
in return. Give us unrestricted owner-
ship of our own property and production
will increase, despite all the obstacles of
a deranged post-war economy. .Make
civil servants of us and we will demand
the same conditions as civil servants
everywhere —40-hour week, paid holidays,
the right to strike and the rest. And
you can’t run a farm efficiently on those
lines. Look at Peak Downs. — Heresone
(N.S.W,).
Commonwealth Employment Service
The C.E.S. (B. 21/5/’52) was begun by
a Labor Government, but that was purely
accidental, because the agency would
have been started by any Government
believing that its bond was as good as
its word. Both bond and word were
given at a 1945 1.L.0. convention, at
which member-nations agreed that they
would each establish or maintain an
employment service.
Two of Australia’s co-signatories were
Britain and the U.S., whose respective
Governments were at the time headed by
those Socialist lions Churchill and
Truman. Britain, since the fall of the
Attlees, has not abolished its Govern-
ment labor-exchanges —established by a
Conservative Government before the
U.K. returned its first Labor Cabinet—
nor has the U.S.
The R.S.L. acts as unofficial agent
of the C.E.S., does a good job and
receives in return a well-spent Govern-
ment subsidy. In most country towns
the local district employment-officers, ex-
servicemen almost to a man, act as unpaid
secretaries to local repat. committees, one
of whose many good services is finding
jobs for ex-members of the forces.
It’s a long time since “the appearance
of an unemployed man [in a N. S. Wales
country town] would cause a wild rush
of farmers to secure his services.” In
cold fact, the increasingly manifest
reluctance of farmers to absorb selected
rural migrants shows that the man-on-the-
land thinks he has sufficient labor.
The placing in employment of about
392,000 working migrants, who arrived
during 1944-51, has been done pretty
efficiently by the C.E.S. It has also found
jobs for an infinitely greater number of
our native-born who did choose to use
that agency.
As for costs —which must include those
of National Service call-ups, in which the
C.E.S. efficiency has been commended by
the service chiefs—they are just over one
million.— Vingter (Vic.).
