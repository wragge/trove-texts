the most thick skinned cars in the world
A BMC car, and BMC alone, gives you the investment and safety protection of
Rotodip 7 skin deep rust protection. Rotodip is unique because car bodies actually
rotate through special cleaning and rustproofing solutions. Result: no air pockets
can form; every inch of the body, inside and out is treated. Rust (it starts on the
inside) can't form, can’t weaken the inherent body strength of your car. Rotodip
rust protection is one reason why your BMC car is safer. Others: BMC's better
front wheel handling, better braking, unique stay-on-line Hydrolastic* fluid
suspension. You buy a safe car, an advanced car when you buy BMC. There’s one
to suit your needs exactly!

Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
"63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the '63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this reasonable price and in
the light of possible future
shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying '64
this year, you save some 20 to
30 cents a bottle.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The straightest
furrow
in the west
IT WAS John Lardner who first coined
the line that watching 12-metre yachts
racing was as about as exciting as
watching the grass grow. Well, an inter-
national ploughing contest is about half
as exciting as that. Indeed, a ploughing
contest is like Test cricket; nothing
happens for an eternity. It almost has
the same restful, beautiful, soporific
quality that is good for the ulcers.
One says “almost” because there is a
feature about ploughing contests that is
rarely mentioned in the publicity. In
order to cover costs, the organisers rent
space to every dealer in agricultural
machinery who will come their way.
And you must realise the competition
for the public purse in chain-saws is
as savage as it is for refrigerators and
TV sets. At Wangaratta we had five
different firms trying to compete with
each other.
Frankly, even the most delightful
rural scene is not enhanced by the music
of five demonstration chain-saws. The
noise was as great as around lawn-
mowing Moorabbin on a Sunday
morning.
The World Ploughing Championships
have just taken place at Lincoln, near
Christchurch, and we gathered the con-
testants for an international match on
the way home. There were representa-
tives of 17 countries, and it was fasci-
nating to see the big men in Wangaratta
wearing their Olympic-type blazers. The
fellow whom you were convinced was
the local shot-put champion of
Hungary merely turned out to be the
local wizard of the mould-board plough.
The contest was organised with con-
siderable courage and skill by the local
Council of Young Farmers and the Vic-
torian Ploughing Association.. It wasn’t
easy. There was agony over the
thought, how would the champion
ploughmen from the soft pastures of
Ireland, Sweden, and Germany react
to the pavement-hard paddocks of
Wangaratta? The Young Farmers had
working bees, they laid one and a half
miles of tobacco-irrigation piping and
poured water all over 15 acres, creating
the equivalent of a two-inch rainfall.
Just as they had done that we had the
best Victorian rain for months. Some-
body up there doesn’t like Young
Farmers.
Enthusiasts were able to see what
the well-dressed ploughman wore for
competition. Osmo Hillebrandt, of Fin-
land, for example, yvore a very smooth
blue tracksuit and a burgundy skivvy.
Gunnar Johnansson, of Sweden, was in
pure white overalls and he had a blue
852 skipper-type peaked cap. Klaas
Eelman, of Holland, was in green over-
alls and an utterly delightful black
Tyrolean hat. The Welshman looked
rugged and down to earth, the West
Germans very alpine in long green
socks, with knee breeches.
First there was a firing of a green
Very warning light. Everybody was
poised ready at their tractors. Five
minutes later there was the red “start
ploughing” Very light, and away they
went. But this time they merely carved
“the opening split,” one straight gash
in the earth. The judges inspected it,
there were more warning lights, and
they all sjet about completely plough-
ing their third of an acre.
And this was the interminable part.
A cricket expert can savor the pure
excitement of a non-scoring battle be-
tween an off-spinner and an opening
batsman. A great expert, no doubt, can
savor the pure beauty of an exquisitely
turned stretch of earth. It was the
job of the judges to look for such
things as straightness of furrow, its
shape, its height, the manner in which
the weeds had been tucked back under,
the marvellous symmetry of the ends,
and all that sort of thing.
But there was tension. Every few
minutes the ploughmen would jump
off their tractors, twiddle tappets, alter
the cut, and real enthusiasts even got
down on their hands and knees and
measured their furrows with a ruler.
Some of the local wheat farmers
loved this: “Geez, mate, how’d you go
employing some of these roosters on
a 400-acre paddock? They’d still be
ploughin’ at Christmas.”
Sil Guroni, the Australian team man-
ager, said the ploughing was a deadly
“Lei's dig that crazy groove!"
serious matter with the Continentals
They worked themselves up to such
a peak you couldn’t talk to them for
a week before a world contest. And
to actually speak to a man while he
was ploughing would be unforgivable.
This would break his concentration.
The great ploughmen, he said, were
the Irish, the Scandinavians, and the
English. “They have to be,” he said,
“they haven’t got the land. So always'
they have concentrated on a meticulous
ploughing. Time doesn’t matter to
them. It’s using up the last quarter
acre that counts.” Last year the world
championship was in Norway, this year
it was in New Zealand, and next year
it would be in Rhodesia. It was an
intriguing thought that there was a
group of ploughing experts who toured
the world just like amateur tennis
players. Although one gathered that
ploughmen were infinitely more
amateur than racquet men.
The winner at Wangaratta eventually
turned out to be Paavo Tuominen, of
Finland, the reigning joint world cham-
pion. Peter Anderson, of Camden,
N.S.W., was second, and Fritz Kriegl-
rneyer, of West Germany, was third.
Prize for the winner was an Albert
Namatjira print, second prize was a
writing case, and third prize two small
Albert Namatjira prints.
Paavo Tuominen was an incredibly
young winner, a crew-cropped, blond,
well-built man of 21. One could only
speculate on how much his Albert
Namatjira print would be appreciated
on the wall of his farmhouse in Tar-
vasjoki, in Finland.
There was also' a contest for the
horse-drawn plough, and one contestant,
Kevin Tyrrell, of Jindivik, Victoria,
was so eloquent on the ease and quality
of the horse-drawn furrow he invited
your correspondent to have a try. Away
we went. First there was a terrible
wrench to starboard. One gave a great
heave to get back on track. “No, no,
the other way,” shouted Mr. Tyrrell.
The correction was equally disastrous,
and the plough sliced back into the nice
ploughing Mr. Tyrrell had already com-
pleted. The furrow, seen later from the
distance, looked like the lower reaches
of the Ganges. Yet, one felt, it had
personality. There were 2560 other
furrows on the property that were
drearily straight.
The ploughing took place just near
“Bontharambo” homestead. This was
the first property settled in the district
back in 1838. The Rev. Joseph Docker
made a fortune selling meat to the
diggers on the goldfields, and he built
this majestic homestead in 1858, using
180 workmen. What with its tower, its
facing granite, and noble verandas, it
is almost a rival to Government House.
It is still occupied by the fourth and
fifth generations of Dockers, and, now
their paddocks have been churned up
with some fancy ploughing, Mr. Stan
Docker will plant there shortly; so if
you don’t have your wheat in yet,
here’s an idea run an international
ploughing contest.

AOAISI-F.P.B.
It's "Sidewinder”, the revolutionary new
ducting for Vulcan heaters.* And cleverly
processed Alcoa aluminium makes the
heating system just about the quietest
thing in your home.
As warm air is circulated at speeds
higher than normal through the insulated
aluminium ducting, noise (a major problem
until now) is absorbed through thousands
of tiny perforations in the aluminium.
The faster flow of heated air and
the elimination of noise add considerably
to your comfort.
There are several good reasons why
Vulcan chose Alcoa aluminium. The
metal’s ductility, for one. The aluminium
ducting is so flexible it curves around
obstructions under floor level without
having to be specially bent or hand-fitted.
This speeds installation and cuts costs.
Aluminium is heat reflective, too; so
there’s a minimum of heat loss on the
way to your furthest room.
And since aluminium resists corrosion,
the ducting system can be fitted and
forgotten. It’s maintenance free.
Vulcan has a good idea; versatile Alcoa
aluminium makes it practical.
* Vulcan heaters as yet available only in Victoria.

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world's choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
There's nothing
pleasant about
breeding pheasant
PHEASANTS ARE now selling in Vic-
toria, but at $1.60 a lb. and no less
than $3.75 for an average cockbird the
prices are hardly supermarket level.
And for the small group of enthusiasts
behind the new industry the rewards
are a lot less than their exclusive trade
might suggest.
The Victorian Government last Sep-
tember chalked up a “first,” and an
international one at that, when it passed
a Bill legalising the breeding of pheas-
ant for the table. It seems almost in-
credible that this fine game bird has
eluded the poulterers’ clutches for so
long. Certainly millions of pheasants
are bred in captivity all over the world,
but they are reared for the sportsman’s
gun and not dispatched cleanly and
quietly in the confines of rearing pens.
I w'ent to Melbourne to get the story
behind this little-publicised food revo-
lution. Over a superb braised pheasant
at Eliza’s Restaurant at the John Bat-
man Motor Inn, I talked with the en-
thusiastic people behind the hatchery,
the breeder, Paul Courtenay, and the
backer, Ross Shelmadine.
By far the largest problem in pheas-
ant breeding is a question of tempera-
ment. The elegant pheasants are as
temperamentally complicated as a prima
ballerina. The royalty of game birds,
they are w'ild, wily, and unpredictable.
Secure in captivity, fed a luscious diet,
coddled and protected from their natu-
ral enemies, from virus and other dis-
eases which can kill, they still rebel.
They are ruthless, destructive, and, even
worse, cannibalistic.
Their behaviour shows up in the
mortality percentages. The broiler
chicken reaches prime weight in about
16 weeks, during which time the mor-
tality is about four percent. The
pheasant is also ready in 16 w'eeks, but
here the loss rate is 20 percent.
This in itself would not be too great
a burden if it weren’t for the additional
high cost of the day-old pheasant chick
—7O cents, as against eight cents for a
day-old broiler chicken. Paul Cour-
tenay’s lacerated hands pointed to a
further hazard of breeding such com-
pletely savage birds. Yet another han-
dicap is the poor food conversion rate

__jt takes 61b. of highly sophisticated
feed to put on lib. of flesh.
Why, then, do these men bother?
Plow, when they have so far lost more
than $3OOO in their first year of opera-
tion, can they remain enthusiastic?
It appears they believe in the future.
This year 2000 birds, next year 12,000.
But can their faith be justified? Are
there enough potential buyers prepared
to pay $3.20 a lb. ex farm, or eager
to dine on restaurant-cooked pheasant
at $6.40, at least, a lb.
McCormick’s, the world’s largest herb
and spice company, have a motto: “If
you make the best, someone will buy
it.” The question then is whether
this is the best poultry meat. Does it
beat chicken, turkey, duck, quail,
grouse, black swan, and so on?
My experience to date is that it does
not. Pheasant’s reputation is based
mostly on hunting rather than eating-
quality. It is delicious and tender, but
borders on being dry-breasted.
Nevertheless, I feel that, as the
pioneers in this new industry feel their
way, costs can be reduced, and that
when this happens success will be theirs
—but no bonanza.
Here is my recipe for Pheasant Vic-
toria (2 servings):
One to 2%1b. pheasant, 4 bacon
rashers, 4 thin slices of apple, 2oz.
onion, loz. celery, 2oz. leg ham, loz.
plain flour, 2 fl. oz. cream, 2 egg-yolks,
10 fl. oz. champagne, 5 fl. oz. milk.
Bouquet garni: (1 sprig thyme, bay-
leaf, 4 parsley stalks, 1 small piece of
celery, 6 black peppercorns), salt, black
pepper, 4oz. clarified butter, 1 small
whole onion, 1 \in.-thick slice each of
red and green capsicums (peeled), 2
teaspoons red currant jelly.
Preparation: Chop celery, ham, and
onion into very fine dice. Measuie
cream and mix with egg-yolks. Measure
flour, and sift. Measure champagne.
Place the small whole onion in the
pheasant and season with salt and
pepper tie up place thin apple
slices on the breast and wrap bird in
bacon rashers. Place with a small
amount of clarified butter into a 475 deg.
F oven for 25 minutes. Remove —detach
thighs and breasts and chop all the
other meat firmly. Dice the capsicum
finely.
Method: Place the breasts and thighs
in the champagne with the herbs to
marinate. Marinate for at least 6 hours.
Remove meat—strain liquid and reserve.
Heat remaining clarified butter in a
pan, add the onion, celery, and ham —
saute gently. Add the flour combine
and pour over the champagne and milk.
Stir to form the sauce. Season with salt
and pepper and add the minced
pheasant meat.
Place the marinated meat into the
sauce—cover and simmer 35 minutes.
Remove from heat. Remove the
pheasant breasts and thighs. Sieve the
rest of the sauce and combine in a
saucepan with the creamed egg-yolk
mixture and thicken. Add the finely-
diced capsicum and red currant jelly
and spoon over pheasant meat.

Randell, the driver,
wasn't there to
start this ENGINE
NO ONE COULD possibly say that
the opening of ENGINE at Farmer’s
Blaxland Gallery was dull. To begin
with, the official guest of honor, actor
Ron Randell, did not arrive. Fifteen
minutes before he was due J. C. Wil-
liamson’s telephoned to say he couldn’t
make it. Someone at the Gallery had it
on good authority that up till noon he
and Mrs. Randell were still in bed,
someone else said his publicity people
had got it all muddled.
Anyway, the fact remained that
ENGINE had to be started. So Farmer’s
merchandising director, Mr. Boyd
Shepphard, rose and said he didn’t look
like the actor (adding later that Ron
wasn’t ill—unfortunately) and that this
was a most provocative exhibition; and
Mrs. Marie de Teliga, the Gallery’s
manager, said: “I don’t look like Mr.
Randell, either, and I certainly don’t
look anything like his wife. However, it
is the exhibition which I am sure you
have all come to see, not the Randells
. . .” Hear, hear, from sympathetic
patrons.
So with the Randells stirred fight
into the soup, we examined this exnibi-
tion of New Objects by artists Sydney
Ball, Col Jordan, and Ken Reinhard.
In the middle of it all stood Mrs. Rein-
hard wearing an eye-jerking red-and-
white Op outfit. “This is not Op,” she
said, “this is Engine.” Of course. This
is what the exhibition’s all about.
“ 'Engine' developed from ‘engineered’
or more simply ‘planned’,” explained
Kym Bonython in his program notes.
Mr. Reinhard, in fact, had engineered
this little red-and-white number himself,
dress designing being another of his
many talents. He calls himself every-
thing under the sun, from carpenter to
art teacher, and three times running
called himself a nit for working so hard
for so little money.
Col Jordan had also run up an
Engine for Mrs. Jordan. It was rasp-
berry velvet slashed with blue. Certainly
not, he had no intention of going into
the rag-trade, but it would be marvellous
if he had a commission for making
playground furniture. His polychrome
sculptures were just the right shape for
children’s slides. He had to tick one off
only the other day for trying to whi zz
down on her bottom.
Sydney Ball is not married, but
girlfriend, artist Margaret Worth, More
his green-and-blue herringbone Engine
To give it steam she added vibrant
green stockings and purple shoes. Mi-
Ball has designed one other dress, and
it now w-alks the streets of New York
A rag-trade fellow there copied it f rom
one of his paintings.
The next bit of excitement was the
news that Kym Bonython had a Nolan
stolen that morning from his Hungry
Horse Gallery in Paddington. If anyone
sees $9OO w r orth of Ned Kelly i n a
four-inch silver frame about 10 x 12
would they please get on to Mr'
Bonython quick. Coppers' narks in-
cluded. Actually, what disturbed Mr.
Bonython was not so much the theft of
his Nolan as the increase in his in-
surance from now on. He is moving
shortly from the Hungry Horse. The
sooner the better, he says, the way
things are going.

wrote Syd, Col, and Ken in the cata-

Well, Sydney Ball is going through
a Persian phase (from $2OOO to $45).
He is a flat chap, with no third dimen-
sions at all. Col Jordan is not going
through any phases except, perhaps.
Slice the first two letters of which
he uses as a prefix for his sculptures.
As in Slinsi ($400) and Slollm ($800).
His Slices are rather large, but Daniel
Thomas, curator of the N.S.W. Gallery,
would certainly have one in his little
10 x 10 room if he could afford it.
In fact, he thought Mr. Jordan’s the
best work there. (He rang later to ask
if he’d said anything frightful.)
Ken Reinhard’s constructions had
progressed from turning people into
little machines to turning people into
big machines, detached as far as pos-
sible from the wall. A man asked if
he'd thought of putting liquid into the
tubes. God! it was bad enough building
the rest without complicating things
still further, thank you very much.
Mr. Reinhard does not anticipate
selling any constructions, but he would
like to get the $6OO back spent on
materials. To this end, and because of
mumps and having teeth out, he has
only five days to do 15 salable pictures
for an exhibition in Newcastle. They
should bring in some cash.
Anyway, time for lunch.
“You’ve ’ad a lovely lot of people,
Mr. Reinhard,” said the liftman, who’d
been up and down with babies and
prams for years at Farmers, so he knew.
Mr. Reinhard got out at Bedspreads.
They’d got some sort of mush for him
there.

Alcan puts ideas to work and
millions of Australians benefit before the sun comes up
The lawn's usually in tears when Alcan arrives. Things are pretty quiet except for
the muffled pad-pad of sandshoes as Alcan arrives for millions of Australians —every
day. Without fail. Every morning your milkman delivers the goods. Thanks in part
to Alcan. Milk. Fresh. Protected by Alcan aluminium foil bottle tops. Hygienically
sealed with the pouring lip sterilised for total protection. Next time you take off the top
remember this: more than 8 million clean, fresh, sterilised bottles of milk are sealed
tight, sealed right, every day with Alcan aluminium foil. Just one of the many
ways every Australian benefits by the ideas Alcan puts into aluminium.
.Automatic machines fill and place Alcan foil caps on milk bottles 400 times a minute. At this tempo there s
no time for delays. A process as complex as this must go on uninterrupted. Foil must be precision machined

The experience of the new man-
agement team is already being
reflected throughout the entire hotel.
The newly decorated rooms and
suites offer the most spacious—and
most gracious—comfort in the city
(yet the rates are comparable with
standard hotels). There are new
catering facilities, new menus
and an enlarged Vintage Cellar.
There is a new look in service:
most friendly, most efficient, yet
most unobtrusive. There are many
extra services now available
such as free parking for house
guests. All these changes have been
subtly blended into the traditional
atmosphere which has long iden-
tified The Australia as Sydney’s dis-
tinguished hotel.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
A soundly based
Goliath
in cement
THE OLD QUESTION has been
brought up again. This time the inquirer
is no less a person than the chairman
of the Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation Ltd.
The query is who’s right and who’s
wrong in their valuation of Conzinc Rio-
tinto of Australia’s shares. Is the Euro-
pean market right and are we making
an awful blunder, or is it vice-versa?
Here’s what the chairman of the
parent Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation said
just two weeks ago at the annual meet-
ing in London: “Taking the market
value of its shares in overseas companies,
the total break-up value of the Rio
Tinto-Zinc Corporation is $BB5 million,
which is about double the present
market value of Rio Tinto-Zinc’s
ordinary shares.” Since the statement
was made, CRA’s share prices have
gone even higher. The whole situation
is most odd and unbalanced. What to
do is the problem and only time can
provide the answer. My only thought is
that the European market has been
operating for a whole lot longer than
we have been, and by rights should be
a bit more experienced in the valuation
game. It should be interesting to see!
A company I feel a lot surer about
is Goliath Holdings. Although the
cement industry as a whole is not too
exciting, at this stage I nevertheless feel
that this company has much to recom-
mend it. First, as the only cement
manufacturer in Tasmania, it must
benefit from the rebuilding program
made necessary by the cruel fire which
laid waste to much of Hobart earlier
in the year. Secondly, this is the first
year of the company’s long-term con-
tract with Ready Mixed Concrete to
supply its needs in Sydney and Mel-
bourne. This deal is considered so im-
portant that the company is spending
$5 million on new equipment, which in-
cludes a kiln and additional storage
buildings. Finally, considering that
Ready Mixed Concrete is the largest
user of cement in Australia, Goliath as
its supplier could now attract the eyes
of a jealous rival as a takeover proposi-
tion. All these pointers add up to one
thing to me: Buv. I did —200 at $2.16.
Talking of takeovers, I see that Mac-
Robertson has finally got the call. This
follows only a few r weeks after mv
long dissertation, with Macßobertsons
as the example, on the folly of buying
stocks purely on the chance of a take-
over. The fact that one of these
rumors has finally proved to be right
does not change my philosophy one
bit. I still stand pat on my previous
comments. I will concede, however
that it is interesting to hold shares in
a company that does have takeover
appeal, but only (and I emphasise the
only) when it has other attractions as
well. These attractions should include
such fundamental attributes as good
prospects and a soundly based business.
Goliath Holdings, which I bought this
week, is a good example of this type
of company. I’m sure the premium
I paid for its takeover prospects was
very minimal, if in fact it existed at
all.
Did you see the tough deal share-
holders in Automatic Totalisators
(U.S.A.) are being bullied into. They
are being pushed into a takeover where
they will receive a cash and share
settlement worth around 90 cents for
each of their $1.77-asset-backed shares.
To make matters worse, the deed is
being perpetrated by a member of its
own family, Automatic Totalisators Ltd.
A company with happier share-
holders is Bell Brothers Holdings. This
is a rather small, family-type company
which operates in the haulage, con-
struction, plant hiring, and manganese
export fields in Western Australia.
Earlier in the year the company’s
shares suffered a minor price reaction
when the interim report showed only
a marginal increase in profits. The
price, which had been $1.60 earlier in
the year, did a backslide to $1.34. It
is now again on the way upward and
has already reached $1.40. The less-
than-expected interim result was caused
by increased transport costs; these, I
should imagine, will only be of a very
temporary nature. Last year, despite
extremely conservative accounting
which caused the company’s tax pro-
vision almost to equal its net profit,
an earning rate of 33.6 percent was
achieved on ordinary capital. With a
current dividend rate of ten percent,
there is plenty of room for expansion.
I also feel there is a lot of room for
investors to make profits. I bought.
My transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
200 Goliath Holdings $2.16 $441
200 Bell Bros. $1.40 $286
This puts the account back in the
red to the tune of $705.

THE ELIZABETHAN Theatre Trust,
which lost the battle for the Major
Hall of the Sydney Opera House, has
now discovered that the facilities
offered by the Melbourne Cultural
Centre are superior to those of the
Minor Hall in Sydney and is “think-
ing” of transferring the opera company
already the home of the
Australian Ballet.
The Sydney Opera House may have
its defects, but the Sydney Opera House
lottery is a great and glorious thing.
We don’t fancy the Elizabethan’s
chances of getting enough money out
of Mr. Bolte to run an opera company.
Derivative
SYDNEY’S Circular Quay with 121
years of lively history behind it now
has an Island Trader restaurant, with
“Polynesian” decor based, the owners
proudly proclaim, on Trader Vic’s in
San Francisco, although Sydney is a
great deal closer to the South Seas
than San Francisco will ever be.
Nearby there is an Old San Francisco
bar. It seems only fair to point out there
wouldn’t have been much Old San
Francisco at all if Old Sydney hadn’t
exported some of her more picturesque
characters there in gold-rush days.
Broad smiles
RESULTS of a highly successful public-
relations coup appeared in full-page
advertisements in newspapers through-
out Australia this week. Colgate-
Palmolive reproduced cuttings from
nine newspapers “endorsing” the effec-
tiveness of its fluoride toothpaste. The
endorsement, such as it was, came
from the work of an Adelaide research
team, led by Dr. Elizabeth Fanning,
Reader in Preventive Dentistry at
Adelaide University.
The team experimented with a
standard toothpaste, one containing 0.4
percent stannous fluoride, and a third
containing 0.76 percent sodium mono-
fluorophosphate. Working for two years
with children aged between 11 and 13
horn 10 Adelaide schools, the team
found the fluoride toothpaste resulted
m “25 to 30 percent fewer new decayed
to oth surfaces on the average.” The
team reported in its summary: “These
results add to the body of knowledge
already available from other countries
demonstrating the efficiency of fluoride
dentifrices as a method of controlling
dental decay.
“Notwithstanding the findings of this
study, it seems important to stress the
value of the cumulative benefits of all
the known methods of caries preven-
tion, such as dietary control, water
fluoridation, and regular dental care.”
The team’s preliminary report was
published in the “Medical Journal of
Australia” on February 25; an Adelaide
public-relations firm released sum-
marised versions to the Press the day
before. These versions ignored the “not-
withstanding” and the “knowledge
already available,” but summaries
of them appeared more or less intact
in most Australian newspapers under
such headings as “Fluoride Works.”
The Adelaide “Advertiser” sent its
science writer to see Dr. Fanning and
led its story with the fact that fluoride
toothpaste was “about half as efficient”
as water fluoridation, but otherwise the
PR men triumphed.
How did Colgate get into the act in
the first place? The company supported
the research work with a grant and
supplied the toothpaste mixtures.
Mini-Schweitzer
A SORT of mini-Dr. Schweitzer is in
Australia from the Philippines trying
to win young Australians for his under-
developed world. He is Dr. Juan
Flavier, who has spent seven years in
rural areas doing medical work just so
that country people begin to trust him
enough to let the light of the Philip-
pine Rural Reconstruction Movement
in. Dr. Flavier is a deputy field director
of this organisation.
“The farming people are like chil-
Juan Flavier
dren,” he said. “None of them wants
charity. But after they begin to know
and trust me I can give a family a
female pig, a baby pig, and tell them
how to look after it. But they must
give me back four female pigs in
exchange. In this way they retain their
dignity, and I can start four more
piggeries.”
Dr. Flavier spoke highly of help
given over the past three years by the
Australian Freedom from Hunger
Campaign. This, he says, has never been
to alleviate immediate distress but to
provide an incentive: a five-year plan
to help the establishment of 51 fresh-
water fish nurseries, a school for train-
ing young men to raise poultry success-
fully, and two fishing craft and equip-
ment to start a co-operative.
“Obviously these donations are small
compared with others we have received,
but they have been straightforward,” he
said. “We don’t have to give something
back, like fighting men.”
So far Dr. Flavier has found no
volunteers in Australia. “And we need
so many people,” he said. “I don't
mean the finest technical brains, but
doctors before they begin to practise,
perhaps, young carpenters, a few fisher-
men would be perfect. There is no
language barrier; English is spoken
everywhere.
“And they would find it good for
their hearts. No matter how much they
are told they live in a paradise in Aus-
tralia, until they have looked at some-
one else’s hell they cannot know their
own paradise.”
Bird-watching (old-style)
FEEDING THE PIGEONS is a
world-wide hobby, but lately science
has intruded on it with devices to keep
these birds away from the escarpments
of city buildings. The effects are notice-
able in Sydney among other places.
An observer who walks daily through
the city’s central Hyde Park noted a
few months ago that the disgruntled
pigeons were gathering there in larger
numbers; and later that their numbers
were reduced. At that point the scien-
tists were visibly on top of the “pigeon
problem.”
But nature, as they say, abhors a
vacuum, and now the same observer
reports that Hyde Park has become
crowded with seagulls who coexist
equably with the remaining pigeons.
As seagulls like scraps of bread as well
as anyone, it is now possible to feed
both seagulls and pigeons in the heart
of Sydney, but our observer feels that,
in time, the seagulls will take over.
A Little More Learning
THE SENATE was quietly discussing
a Bill on Commonwealth education
scholarships when Senator Reg Wright,
the Tasmanian Liberal, introduced a
scholarly note. “Facilis descensus
averno (the road to Hell is easy),” he
said.
The Opposition Leader, Senator
Lionel Murphy, interjected: “Tros
anchisiadae.” (A reference to the Trojan
story of the man who carried his
father out of the fires on his back.)
Not to be outdone, Senator Wright
retorted: “Sed revocare gradum super-
asque evadere ad audas, hoc opus, hie
labor est (but to recall thy step and
issue to the upper air there is the
toil and there the task).”
The Government Leader, Senator
Henty, then joined the debate: “Come
off it. I thought we were discussing
an Education Bill.”


AS I SEE IT
Holt flying
from problem
to problem
BY ALAN REID
WHEN PRIME MINISTER Harold
Holt left Australia last Sunday for
Washington, Expo ’67, and London, he
was flying from still unresolved local
problems in the direction of even
heavier international ones.
His local problems look tough enough.
His Government has lost control of the
Senate, which rejected his postal rises
too early in the life of the existing
Parliament for him to exploit a double
dissolution threat, and the Voyager
inquiry is being reopened on a basis
that could produce criticism of the
Government.
But overseas, events are starting to
get tough for Australia, and if
national welfare and not merely poli-
tical considerations are taken as the
yardstick—things may get very tough
indeed for Mr. Holt.
Holt has two immediate problems
over which to brood on his long plane
journeys: There is the very real possi-
bility of a complete British withdrawal
from South-East Asia within a rela-
tively short period and the prospect
of Britain’s entry into the European
Economic Community.
Of the two, the prospect of British
withdrawal from South-East Asia
undoubtedly looms largest in Holt’s
mind. Britain’s entry into the Common
Market could hit Australia (or per-
haps more accurately some vulnerable
Australian foodstuff industries) very
hard. But British withdrawal from
South-East Asia could hit where it
would really hurt—in Australia’s
capacity to survive.
Reducing it to its simplest terms,
Australia has five defence commit-
ments:
• Defence of the Australian mainland.
• Defence of Papua-New Guinea.
• Commitment in Vietnam.
• Potential commitment under
SEATO.
• Commitments in the Singapore-
Malaysian area.
Leaving out the defence of the Aus-
tralian mainland and Papua-New
Guinea, to which Australia would be
committed whatever the circumstances
(and which, anyway, is covered by
United States guarantee), the other
commitments were entered into in the
assumption that Australia would be
operating in association with at least
one of the Great Powers.
No country the size of Australia and
with Australia’s limited resources
could enter into such commitments
without the assurance that it was
operating with one of the Great
Powers.
It has that assurance in Vietnam
through association with the United
States, which is far more deeply com-
mitted than Australia.
It has that assurance in SEATO. It
originally had a strong double-barrelled
assurance there, in that both the
United States and Britain were guaran-
tors of everything that Australia
guaranteed, including the defence of
Thailand. It still has a double-barrelled
assurance, even if one barrel is begin-
ning to wilt somewhat, because as
recently as April last Britain, at a
Washington meeting of the SEATO
powers reaffirmed its SEATO commit-
ment.
It had that assurance in Malaysia
and Singapore. But if Britain pulls out
it is no longer going to have it. With
New Zealand, Australia is going to be
isolated in the area.
According to the Chief of the
Malaysian Armed Forces, General
Tunku Osman, Australia has indicated
that it will keep troops in Malaysia
if Britain withdraws, and Malyasia has
indicated that it would like Australian
troops to remain.
But whatever Australia may have
told Malaysia at this stage, it is inevit-
able there will have to be a lot of re-
thinking about our position if Britain
pulls out completely. Small, relatively
limited in resources, we could fill only
a very small part of the vacuum created
by British withdrawal.
Meaningless without Britain
Even with 10,000 troops being with-
drawn by next April, and a withdrawal
target of between 8000 and 13,000 later,
there will still be 20,000 British troops
in the area at the end of next year.
Australia might continue to keep
troops there on an assurance from
Britain of reinforcement by mobile
forces under a new strategic concept of
handling Britain’s treaty commitments
in the area. But the plain fact is that
minus the British troops the Common-
wealth Strategic Reserve, of which the
Australians in the area are part, would
become meaningless.
That would be bad enough from
Holt’s and Australia’s viewpoint, but
there is another factor which is worry-
ing both President Johnson and Holt
as recent communications between them
clearly disclose.
The Vietnam war is at a crucial
stage. The area is sensitive. Newly
emerged countries even those with
a predilection toward the United States-
Australia line are uneasily and under-
standably wondering about who in the
long-term will come out top dogs in
the area.
No Wilson follow-through
If Britain pulls out, it will
undoubtedly change the power balance
in the area. In Johnson’s and Holt’s
view it will not only erode the South
Vietnamese - United States - Australian
position in Vietnam, it must have, from
the Australian-American viewpoint, an
adverse effect upon the attitudes of
both committed and uncommitted
countries in the area.
Holt does not expect to get any
response from the British on the basis
of sentiment.
He thinks that that is now old hat
and would not produce other than wry
amusement in a British bosom.
He believes that he can sell Wilson
intellectually on the proposition that
despite the economic pressures building
up in Britain, it is in Britain’s long-
term interests to maintain a significant
presence in South-East Asia. But he
recognises realistically that while he
might be able to sell Wilson on this,
political pressures in Britain might make
it beyond Wilson’s capacity to follow
through his intellectual conviction.
Johnson and Holt undoubtedly see
their interests as identical. With forces
engaged in Vietnam, they want an
improving, not a worsening position.
That is why Holt is seeing Johnson in
Washington the day before Wilson sees
Johnson, and why the Common Market
issue, important and all as it is, is
taking second place.
On EEC, Holt will mainly be striv-
ing for breathing space to persuade
Britain not to rush into Europe without
some assurance that its traditional
suppliers, such as Australia and New
Zealand, get some protection.
I get the impression here that Holt
recognises he is fighting a fight that
he cannot win that Wilson is deter-
mined to get Britain into the EEC
whatever the conditions and however
adversely they affect Australia, New
Zealand, and other Commonwealth
countries.
Holt’s ally in this fight may be not his
persuasiveness but General de Gaulle.
He is still making British entry into
the EEC as prohibitive as he did when
Sir Robert Menzies was Prime Minister
and Australia was fighting what then
seemed like a hopeless rear-guard
action.
These are the complex problems
with which Holt has to wrestle during
his present trip abroad. I am travelling
with him and will be reporting back
to The Bulletin on how he fares.


AUSTRALIA
Yes-No: Problems, problems
for Mr. Holt
THE FEAR that Australians were
so styjpid that they would not know
the difference between the nexus re-
ferendum and the aborigines referen-
dum was exploded last weekend with
figures that surprised even the confi-
dent. The contrast of a three-to-two
majority for “No” on the nexus with
a 10-to-one majority for “Yes” on the
aborigines seemed evidence that Aus-
tralians were capable of sorting out one
issue from another.
This should hearten those who be-
lieve that there are also other ways in
which the Constitution could be made
more sensible. Someone should now
take out a copy of the Report of the
Joint Committee on Constitutional
Reform from its filing cabinet and have
a look for recommendations in it that
would be likely to be acceptable to
the voters. The huge “Yes” on the
aborigines question suggests that a few
other non-controversial amendments
might be worth trying.
Of these, an obvious example is the
recommendation that Senators be re-
tired after the second dissolution of
the House of Representatives, rather
than after a fixed term. For a nation
that appears to wish to express its
contempt for politicians, this should be
a thoroughly popular change. It would
mean that Senate and House of Repre-
sentative elections could be held to-
gether, and halve the number of times
voters would have to get out their cars
and drive to the polls.
But after Saturday’s defeat no one
in Canberra is going to suggest any
new referendums. In some ways even
the “Yes” vote on the aborigines ques-
tion could give Mr. Holt as many
anxieties as the “No” vote on the nexus.
The alteration to census arrangements
is a purely mechanical matter, al-
though important in that Australians
have now affirmed their formal belief
that aborigines are people. But now
that the Commonwealth also has a
national power in connection with
aborigines, how will it use it? It is no
secret that for the moment the Govern-
ment has not got the faintest idea what
it should do with this new power.
To a consensus man like Mr. Holt,
looking for trendy issues, the aborigines
could give him a domestic issue on
which to shine forth, as he has been
learning to reflect some of the light
of Australia’s faintly glowing interest
in Asia. It also gives him another
chance to dish Mr. Whitlam and make
an appeal of contemporaneity to youn-
ger voters. And this time he should
have no problem about his rhetoric.
He could merely re-quote the words of
his own External Affairs Minister, who
once said, years ago: “When we enter
into international discussion and raise
our voice, as we should raise it, in de-
fence of human rights and the pro-
tection of human welfare, our very
words are mocked by thousands of de-
graded and depressed people who
crouch on rubbish heaps throughout the
whole of this continent.”
National drive
But while there could be enormous
support for a national drive for the
betterment of the aborigines, this sup-
port would grow less the closer Mr.
Holt got tp home. Some of his sup-
porters would consider that the money
required might be better used in tip-
ping a bit more into the trough for
their own favored pressure groups.
Others simply do not believe that
aborigines matter. At the same time—
if it can ever overcome the perils of
its own disunity—the Labor Party now
has a popular issue on which it could
belabor the Government.
As he flew off from Australia on
Sunday Mr. Holt may have reflected
on the accidental nature of his power,
built on the collapse of the Labor
Party, and how much harder he would
have to fight if the Opposition began
seriously to offer an alternative govern-
ment. His campaign for a “Yes” vote
for the nexus was peremptory and
unimaginative, although there was
consolation for him in the thought
that the Labor Party’s part of the
campaign was equally bad.
Mr. Holt seemed to go into the re-
ferendum campaign with the confidence
of a man who believes in his own luck.
His half-hearted campaign started too
late and most of it was badly thought
out. There seemed to be about it some
of the arrogance of the 1961 election
that Sir Robert Menzies almost lost.
The argument that a “Yes” vote on the
nexus was O.K. because almost all
parliamentarians had supported it
seemed like one of those art “hap-
pennings” which are contrived mainly
Roy Fletcher Cape York to “Yes”
so that they blow themselves up. If
the parliamentary Labor Party ultim-
ately finds itself following, more or less,
the line put up on Vietnam by its De-
puty Leader last week, Mr. Holt will
have to begin working very much harder
for his success.
It is no good, as Mr. Whitlam did,
just to blame the newspapers. Austra-
lia’s daily papers split fairly evenly on
the nexus referendum, with a leaning
towards “No.” In three of the four
smaller States—South Australia, West
Australia and Tasmania —the morning
newspapers gave an emphatic “No.” In
Queensland the “Courier Mail” gave a
reluctant “Yes.” Only the “Age” was
for “Yes” in Victoria. In New South
Wales only the “Daily Telegraph” was
for “No.” The “Australian” came in
nationally with a “Yes.”
In the meantime, when Mr. Holt
returns he has to clean up the mess.
The nexus referendum was necessary
because of the reluctant deal Sir Robert
Menzies made with the Country Party
that the long overdue redistribution of
constituency boundaries would not
damage the Country Party’s interests.
The way out for the Liberal Party was
to increase the number of seats in the
House of Representatives so that it
would not lose constituencies. On the
face of it, the “No” vote could now
mean that the redistribution of boun-
daries will, in the world’s most urban-
ised nation, give a greater bias to rural
representation than ever before, and
that the Liberals could lose six seats
in New South Wales. With so many
Australians voting, as they believed,
against more politicians, jt would seem
unlikely that Mr. Holt adopt the only
workable method the unamended Con-
stitution provides for increasing seats
to put up the number of members
of Parliament from 183 to 252.


Tariffs
Backwoods
approach
HALF A MILE EAST of Parliament
House in Canberra huge rubber-
wheeled earthmoving machines have
started preparing the ground for a
second 10,000 square foot wing of the
handsome Tariff Board building. An-
other half mile away across playing
fields used by public servants in their
lunch hour, storeys 3 and 4 are going
on to “Industry House,” the Chamber
of Manufacturers’ office block, an ugly
1940 s cream bricky. Right next door
the Chambers of Commerce have just
moved into a spacious new glasshouse.
The office of Secondary Industry in
the Department of Trade, meanwhile,
having vacated its post-war. huts nearby,
is now spreading itself in a huge grey
stone monolith known appropriately as
the “Admin Block.”
Tariff arguing, tariff lobbying, and
tariff making are together one of Can-
berra’s growth industries.
With the triumphantly successful
Kennedy Round of tariff cuts, Australia,
literally alone among the industrial
countries of the free world, continues
to take tariffs seriously. North Ameri-
can and British tariffs are down from
20 percent to 10 percent on average;
the Common Market’s from 13 to 8 per-
cent, and unattached European coun-
tries like Switzerland and Sweden are
dropping theirs below 5 percent. The
“Economist” declared last week that
tariffs are now so low that they are
no longer an issue. The main obstacles
to the attainment of free trade are “non-
tariff” obstacles, such as quota systems,
and differences in measures and stan-
dards.
We in Australia, of course, get the
benefit of these dramatic tariff cuts
plus the more liberal arrangements for
food trade agreed at Geneva, but are
not obliged to make full reciprocal cuts
in our tariffs. Having got ourselves
classified as a “semi-developed, primary
producing country” (despite the fact
that the proportion of our workforce
in manufacturing is as high as any
country) we were lumped with South
Africa and New Zealand and ex-
pected only to offer “equivalent” con-
cessions.
Our negotiations really only started
after the Kennedy Round proper
finished and the results will not be
known for some time. But Department
of Trade officials in Canberra last week
made it clear that our concessions will
be very limited and that our tariffs
will mostly remain at their present
levels—averaging 40 percent and rang-
ing up to 200 and 300 percent. What
Trade Minister John McEwen
our negotiators in Geneva are offering
as concessions are not general tariff cuts
but large reductions in British prefer-
ences in the Australian market. They
are offering the Europeans, the North
Americans, and the Japanese the oppor-
tunity to sell more in Australia, not at
the expense of local industry but at
the expense of the British.
The rest of the world does not mind
whose share of the Australian market
it gets, as long as it gets it. So
although our action is rather contrary
to the spirit of the Kennedy Round,
everybody will be happy except the
British who will scream. But our
officials argue that it was the British
who started the whole business of
abolishing British preferences, first by
their acceptance of across-the-board
Kennedy tariff cuts (which reduce the
value of our existing preference in
Britain) and second by applying to join
the Common Market, which must in-
volve the abandonment of British pre-
ference and the erection of reverse
preferences against us. So let them
scream.
The Britain-Australia Trade Agree-
ment expired in 1962 and only con-
tinues by mutual assent.
Meamvhile, back at the lakeside
ranch, the old domestic wrangle over
tariffs is due to hot up again. Trade
Minister McEwen has just got back
from Geneva and one of the first duties
will be a confrontation with the Tariff
Board. Its members have been angered
by Mr. McEwen’s public accusations
of its inefficiency and also by his De-
partment’s attempts to curtail its in-
dependence and demanded a meet-
ing with him on his return.
Last week saw the first shots in the
new battle fired. Tariff Board chair-
man Rattigan broke a long silence
during which he was accused by some
of being a Trade Department puppet.
In a speech in Perth he stated forth-
rightly the need for an independent
Tariff Board and the way he thought it
should develop. “The Board’s tradi-
tional approach is inadequate in present
conditions,” he declared without quali-
fication at one point. There had been
no attempt to look at the structure of
protection as a whole and it was at
present impossible in many cases to
determine just how much effective pro-
tection an industry was getting.
Most radical (in the Australian con-
text) of his suggestions was that when
particular commodities have very high
protective needs they should be re-
viewed frequently by the Tariff Board
and if these excessive needs are found
to persist, manufacturers should be
encouraged to phase out their produc-
tion.
One of his most significant passages
came inappropriately in the middle:
“Today it is not good enough to have
a parochial backwoods approach to de-
velopments in tariff making overseas.”
MacRobertsons
Takeover bids
AS THE WEEK ENDED it was on the
cards that the man from Mars Inc. of
Chicago would gobble up for a cool
$7.8 million the sweets business started
by Macpherson Macßobertson in a
Fitzroy bathroom back in 1880. And
so leave little more than the hardy
local firm, Lifesavers, to carry the Aus-
tralian flag against foreign invaders in
the local confectionery business. If
Mars was not going to be successful
it seemed that at least some internat-
ional giant would make the swallow.
As The Bulletin stated in February,
Macßobertson’s is ripe for a takeover It
has been struggling against the tide of
ruthless competition, mostly from over-
seas rivals to hold its share (now 15
percent) of the Australian sweet market
with only limited success in the last
few years. The toll has been taken in
squeezed margins and lower profits
which in the latest year have obliged
it to halve its dividend to 4 percent
with even this reduced rate barely
covered by earnings. Adding to the
company’s difficulties have been losses
on operations at its cocoa plantation
in New Guinea and a costly move front
the long-established Fitzroy factory to a
new site at Ringwood.
The market promptly put the price
of Macßobertson shares up to $1.87,
some 12 cents above the bid price, on
the expectation of some other company,
local or otherwise, outbidding Mars, but
subsequently had second thoughts and
the price retreated nearer to the Mars
figure. Rather optimistically the com-
pany was claiming its assets were worth
$2.50 a share, but the Mars represent-
ative treated this lightly.
It remains for anyone else interested
to outbid Mars and get a nod from the
Macßobertson family, which holds 35
percent of the shares. The company con-
sidered mostly likely to do so ' vas


Nabisco, another U.S. group, which has
taken a close look at Macßobertsons in
recent months. It failed to get Swallow
and Ariel in its takeover battle with
Australian Biscuit Co. a couple of years
a go and has since built a factory in
Melbourne. Other foreign interests may
come forward, but the only Australian
confectionery group with sufficient re-
sources to rescue Macßobertsons from
foreign control would be Lifesavers.
One way or another it looks as if Mac-
Robertsons will go overseas despite all
the gallant talk of preserving local
equity participation in Australian enter-
prises and not selling off bits of the
farm.
Airports
"Jumbo" jets
THE INTERSTATE TUB thumping
between New South Wales and Victoria
over airports reached a new pitch last
week with the announcement that the
Commonwealth would spend another
$3.4 million on site preparation works
at Sydney’s Mascot Airport.
But although this brought Common-
wealth expenditure on Mascot to more
than $5O million, it left some of the
Mascot supporters far from happy. They
claimed that New South Wales had
been “fobbed off” and that, although
money would be spent on site prepara-
tion works, the Government had made
no decision to build the proposed $3O
million domestic terminal adjacent to
the new international terminal.
But if Mascot lost because of Govern-
ment shilly shallying in one respect,
it gained in another. Announcing the
new works, the Minister for Civil Avia-
tion, Mr. Reg Swartz, revealed that the
design of the $22 million international
terminal at Sydney would have to be
drastically overhauled to cater for the
Boeing 747 “jumbo” or super jets, as
suggested in these columns some weeks
ago.
On several occasions Swartz plainly
Civil Aviation Minister Swartz
misstated the airport situation. He
told the Federal Parliament recently
that “in the designing of the inter-
national terminal building at Sydney,
as also at Melbourne, consideration had
been given to the requirements of
‘jumbo type’ aircraft.”
In his announcement last week the
Minister changed his tune. Outlining
the alterations to be made, he said:
“The ‘jumbo’ jet was not even projected
by the manufacturers when the Sydney
plans were put before the Parliamentary
Works Committee.”
The facilities for these jets could not
be provided at Melbourne’s new Tulla-
marine Airport, as that project was too
far advanced to make alterations. But
delays in even getting a go on at
Mascot meant that design changes could
be easily incorporated, making Mascot
Australia’s only airport with the neces-
sary facilities for the huge jets, to carry
nearly 500 passengers each and due in
service in 1969.
Swartz was forced to do another
somersault on the question of delays
in the Mascot project, now several
months behind schedule. At first he
disclaimed any knowledge of delays and
tried to throw the blame on to the
Works Minister, Bert Kelly, whose de-
partment is the constructing authority.
Kelly, a South Australian -swith no
axe to grind in the Tullamariin -Mascot
affair, simply pointed out that his de-
partment was waiting for specifications
on “jumbo” jets from the DCA to in-
corporate any necessary design changes.
So Swartz was forced to admit last week
that the DCA had been reviewing the
plans for Sydney.
Arbitration
A first
FOR THE FIRST time in the history
of Australian Arbitration, a professional
philosopher has been called as a witness.
The Building Workers’ Industrial
Union invited Dr. Len Grant, lecturer
in Philosophy at Monash University, to
address the Victorian Wages Board.
The union is seeking a rise in mar-
gins and improvements in conditions
for tilelayers. An afternoon tea-break is
part of its log of claims.
Mr. Geoff McDonald, an organiser
for the BWIU, is conducting the case
before Chairman Saker and is support-
ing the log of claims on the grounds
of work value.
As a professional philosopher, Dr.
Grant delivered a paper to the Tribunal
on the just wage. He said that his main
aim was “to show that the evaluation
of work requires first that the expendi-
ture of labor, of time and effort, should
be rewarded as it contributes to our
social life and meets social needs,
second that the diligence and skill with
which that labor is performed merit
proportionate recompense.”
Dr. Grant has been one of many
experts called by Mr. McDonald. Others
have included Mr. Bob Hawke, of the
ACTU, Mr. Ray O’Dea, of the Aus-
tralian National University, and a
number of professional psychologists
and economists.
Experienced officials claim that Mr.
McDonald’s case is one of the most
comprehensive and well-constructed ever
put before an Australian Wage Tri-
bunal. The union, the employers, and
the Tribunal regard the tilelayers’
claim as a test case on work value for
the building industry at large.
If it succeeds it will probably, in
time, affect all Australian industry and
the number of work value cases will
multiply rapidly.
It is a matter of minor interest that
the union organiser who is brilliantly
conducting a case of such importance
and drawing on such a range of aca-
demic witnesses is studying for
Matriculation Certificate, part-time.
N.S.W. ALP
Bad steer
THREE LABOR Senators retire in
N.S.W. this year, but only two are
likely to be returned in the next Senate
election. In that sentence you have the
crux of the Labor Party’s latest crisis,
and the motive for some comic
manoeuvring.
In N.S.W., Senator Murphy has been
fighting hard to retain No. 1 QJ? No. 2
position on the next senate ballot paper.
Murphy himself has only restricted
influence but his cause has been cham-
pioned, with or without his consent,
by the secretly organised “steering com-
mittee.” A Left-wing group composed
of union and Party members, the “steer-
ing committee” operates very effectively
from the rooms of the Building Workers’
Industrial Union. In guarded private
conversation, members boast that it
can turn on letters to newspapers and
resolutions from certain ALP branches
and unions at 48 hours’, notice. Its
mouthpiece is a professionally produced
and privately circulated newspaper
called “Socialist & Industrial Labor.”
Disciplined and single-minded, the
“steering committee” has scored some
notable propaganda successes. How-
ever, things have not been going
so well lately. An attempt to label
some N.S.W. officials as “Groupers”
by resurrecting the defunct “Labor For-
ward Committee” flopped when a maga-
zine publishing the allegations collected
a writ. Then “steering committee”
members attending their “secret” meet-
ing were alarmed to learn that the
Right Wing knew all about them
including the fact that they met in a
Communist union secretary’s rooms.
Latest setback came when the com-


mittee tried to persuade the ALP
Federal Executive to take over N.S.W.
on the pretext that Senator Murphy’s
difficulties were unconstitutionally con-
trived. At a Caucus of members of the
Federal Executive, two men refused to
push for intervention. This sign of good
sense was significant in itself, but the
Left Wing was thrown into complete
confusion by the identity of the dele-
gates taking an independent line. Rumor
has it that the focus of resistance was
“Joe” Chamberlain.
Personality
Paul Ritter
THE OLD AUSTRALIAN custom of
lopping the tall poppies down to size
can be seen in action in Perth with
the case of Czech-born British-trained
town planner Mr. Paul Ritter. This
non-conformist - who has the addi-
tional un-Australian traits of being
brilliant and a congenital knocker is
being forced back into line, or out.
In the past few weeks he has been
stripped of his position as city architect
following a closed meeting of the coun-
cil. And two weeks ago he was among
the irritants that produced four pages
of Perth City Council staff regulations
which, among other things, muzzled
employees and stopped them speaking
without written authority to reporters,
or on TV. Since Mr. Ritter arrived in
Australia two years ago, he has become
Perth’s most gifted controversialist,
speaking endlessly but usually authori-
tatively on many subjects, and in
doing so getting himself mashed in with
some politically hot potatoes.
The pro-Ritter camp sees his dis-
missal from the architect post and the
subsequent gagging as personal attacks
on him, instigated by three influential
councillors and aimed at forcing him
to resign, something he makes it clear
he will not do. A middle-of-the-road
attitude is expressed by Cr. Cliff Harris,
finance committee chairman, who says
of the planner: “I think he’s a genius,
but sometimes the line between genius
and lunacy is rather hard to define.”
This fuzzy line has been used against
him, for even slight caricatures of some
of the points in his books can become
instant ammunition for his opponents.
In his “Planning for Man and Motor,”
he advocates a split-level city, one level
for cars and the other for pedestrians.
In “The Free Family,” he and Mrs.
Ritter put up some views on self-
determination within family groups
(they have six children) that have out-
raged Perth.
The official reason for his clipped
wings is that he was being kept from
his task of actually drawing up a master
plan for the city of Perth; primarily a
Paul Ritter ... enthusiast
teacher, he is teaching his staff of 17
at the expense of his main job.
But to this can be added another
standard Australian prejudice a
suspicion that can sour into antagonism
of laymen toward academics, particu-
larly when they are outstanding and
voluble academics and the laymen are
like Perth City councillors, without a
degree among them. The resultant
communications gap is pointed up by
the type of banality included in the
recent regulations; Mr. Ritter, along
with other council employees, is
reminded that “on the job and off, let
us be boosters. Let us show we are
proud to be members of the local
authority of the capital of this State.”
The town clerk, Mr. G. O. Edwards,
insists the regulations are not aimed at
Mr. Ritter: “Paul has been troublesome,
but there is no personal animosity
involved. He is a brilliant man, but in
an organisation as big as this we must
all conform.” But last week the con-
formers went too far and, in refusing
Ritter permission to use three days of
his annual leave to address a national
architects’ convention in Brisbane, they
cast, nationally, some shadow over the
“City of Light.”
New Zealand
Natural gas
THE STATEMENT “natural gas
will have a tremendous influence
on our internal economy and particu-
larly on the manufacturing industry”
sounded like an echo from recent pro-
nouncements by Sir Henry Bolte and
other Australian Premiers; but in this
instance it came from the general
manager of the Auckland Gas Company
in New Zealand. He was cheering the
news that the Government had at last
made a deal with the Shell-BP-Todd Oil
consortium which found gas and oil at
Kapuni (near New Plymouth, North
Island) six years ago, after £NZIO
million’s worth of exploration, and hard-
bargaining ever since.
Probably driven by New Zealand's
awakening, if not into the Industrial
Age at least into awareness that one
must come, the Government was in a
mood to make concessions; and the con-
sortium, equally aware that each year
without another oil or gas strike in
N.Z. made its position stronger, was
firm in pressing its advantages.
The upshot is that the consortium
will separate the gas and condensate
(light crude oil) at Kapuni. The Gov-
ernment will set up a corporation to
take it from there, building a carbon
dioxide removal plant at Kapuni and
pipelines from New Plymouth to nine
northern towns and cities, including
Auckland and Wellington, for £NZ9
million. The consortium will gain a
£NZ2.4I million bonus on its conden-
sate, and the Government will save a
million a year in foreign exchange on
that part of the deal.
Meanwhile, a firm of American con-
sultants had advised the Government
to use the natural gas as premium fuel,
linking up intervening cities between
Kapuni and Wellington for home and
industrial use; offering a three-to-one
benefit as compared with an electricity-
generation idea.
Following that advice to last month’s
agreement brought union protests that
the Minister of Mines and Electricity,
Mr. Shand, had deceived the nation,
and dire predictions that natural gas
would prove the whitest elephant of
all. The deputy-leader of the Labor
Party, former Minister of Electricity,
Hugh Watt, said New Zealanders were
electricity-minded and a huge promo-
tion effort would- be needed to convince
the housewives they should change to
gas.
“Natural gas in two years (1969),”
is now the Government’s promise and
Mr. Shand expects the Corporation,
when set up, to pay for the pipeline and
still sell gas at an attractive price.
He says the consortium will receive
2ld. per million BTU for gas at the
field for five years and 22d. there-
after, and the Corporation will sell at
N.Z. 54d. a million British Thermal
Units to gas companies. That should
allow them to retail at 15 percent less
than current rates, fully competitive
with electricity.
Mr. Shand sees only one catch. A
very fast build-up of gas use in homes
and industry is essential to the scheme s
success. This in turn may be beneficial,
forcing the Government to promote in-
dustrial expansion. What a pity it
didn’t all happen six years ago when
the Kapuni field was discovered. How-
ever, it has an estimated life of 25
years, producing 35 million cubic, feet
of gas daily, and 3000 barrels of con-
densate. It’s a good start for a nation
thinking of industrialising.

COMMENT
How to pay less for sandshoes
and help Asia more
AT LEAST THE chairman of the
Tariff Board thinks that there should
be some end to ready-made protection,
even if Mr. McEwen does not. It is now
time for the Government to give some
constructive answer to Mr. Rattigan’s
suggestion in Perth last week that the
Board should now deal with areas of
over-protection.
Generally, protection works well for
Australia, but why with a successful
policy of full employment do we
have to go on paying the heavy costs of
subsidising every inefficiency? Most
inefficiencies, perhaps but surely not
all of them. If we were still trying to
create jobs there would be sense in
doing so at almost any cost, but for-
tunately our problems are now more
those of making our society a better one
to live in than seeing that we get people
off the relief. This means a continuing
shift of employment into occupations
that, one way or the other, belong to
the service industries.
There are very sound national reasons
why we should protect our national
technology. As a visiting British in-
dustrialist, Mr. Sebastian de Ferranti,
says, it is by this means that a nation
remains independent and powerful. But
somebody should have pointed out to
Mr. Ferranti that in many industries we
have long since given up any pretence
at having any technology of our own.
The phrase he used to describe depen-
dent countries, that they are “tech-
nological colonies,” is exactly the phrase
to use to describe much of Australian
manufacturing. Of the highly developed
economies, ours is one of the tech-
nologically most derivative. If the Gov-
ernment were using protection to foster
a local technology there would be very
sound reasons for its doing so, but one
of the principal roles of our protection
is to encourage overseas companies to
set up colonies here.
Is it necessary for the maintenance
of full employment in Australia or for
the development of our national tech-
nology that we should levy 100 percent
duty on sandshoes from India? Or 275
percent duty on thong sandals from
Japan? How much longer do we think
we can go on importing so much less
from Japan than we export, just because
we want to preserve in toto a policy
that was first developed to meet quite
different problems from our present ones
and that sometimes now creates more
problems than it solves?
It is time some of our politicians
started explaining to consumers that one
of the reasons things cost so much
in the shops is that national policy
makes it so. And to taxpayers that one
of the best of all forms of financial aid
to poverty-stricken nations is to buy
from them more of the goods that they
make. If we could ever work it out, we
could make excellent deals with some of
our Asian neighbors in which, by buying
more from them, we could suit every-
body except the technologists of indus-
tries such as the sandshoe business.


Whitlam—the first 100 days
FOR MOST politicians one of the
prices they pay for their power is the
endurance of a great deal of boredom.
Question Time in Parliament is the best
illustration. Though regarded as one
of the more lively occasions, a time
when every government minister must
attend the House, and wLen off-the-
cuff responses are expected, it is for
most a tedious duty.
The subjects skip from one minutia
to another: from the timing of pay-
ments on the 1965 dried fruits crop
to reasons for delays in deciding on the
site for the terminus of the standard
gauge line from Kalgoorlie. The bored
react in their own w'ays. The Prime
Minister is the yoga man’s picture of
relaxation, completely slumped in his
chair, net a muscle functioning; the
Treasurer wull put his hand across his
eyes to cover his sleepiness. On the
other side, at the desk opposite Mr.
Holt, the Labor Party leader, Mr. Cal-
well, regularly used to make construc-
tive use of his time by signing letters.
Once—his secretary must have been off
-—he was seen folding copies of a circu-
lar letter, and one by one inserting
them in envelopes and giving each a
hearty lick. He must have got through a
good eight dozen in the three-quarter-
hour session.
One of the few men w'ho never seems
bored is his successor, Mr. Gough Whit-
lam. He stands out among fellow par-
liamentarians at Question Time; all
the time he is nervously alert. He listens
attentively, his head snaps around every
few seconds, beckoning a colleague from
the bench behind, waving for an atten-
dant to deliver a message, scribbling a
note, or leaning across to the handsome
volumes of Hansard, which lie in the
centre of the main table, to check a
reference.
His staff laughed at me when I
asked about his filing system. I suppose
the idea of a system in any filing of
papers is inherently ridiculous, and
especially so when you have to cater
to a man obsessed with detail. Fie has
great banks of filing cabinets in his
suite of offices. He reads his Hansards
meticulously, making numerous annota-
tions in the margins and developing day
by Parliamentary day a most elaborate
indexing system. To fit this in with
the official Parliamentary Hansard
index, he regularly sends a staffer dowm
to the Hansard office to badger them
into making their index reference con-
form to that of Mr. G. Whitlam. He
is, as a consequence, a wizard at the
parliamentary debating art of saying,
with a triumphant gleam in the eye:
“But the Minister said in answer to a
question by the Honorable member for
Goroke on the 27th of August, 1952,
recorded in Hansard, page 7314 . .
or one-upping the Government by being
able to reel off the exact number and
dates of occasions in the past when
the ALP had urged a now-accepted
reform.
In the whole Parliament of 180 men
he stands out clearly as the person
with by far the greatest fascination
for and ability to concentrate on
minutiae. He makes even the devotedly
clerkish Mr. Hasluck look like an
administrative slouch.
It seems to be this zestful appetite
for the meat of government which has
got Mr. Whitlam where he is, and
which is his greatest political asset.
It enables him to project an image
(accurate, too) of earnest pragmatism,
and it gives him authority in whatever
he is talking about. It means that the
Parliamentary Labor Party Caucus and
Executive have such a thing as an
agenda at meetings for the first time,
and, as a consequence, work with some-
what more efficiency than before. It
means that he is a powerful force to
be reckoned with in debate. And that
he is constantly questioning (especially
with long and searching “Questions on
the Notice Paper”); he is always stirring
the bureaucracy to action or evasion. He
By PETER SAMUEL
is a prodigious telegram sender, trans-
mitting congratulations, condolences,
making suggestions, or sending thanks.
He drives his staff of able assistants
very hard, and forces stenographers to
resign in quick succession with his
impatient demands.
But Whitlam has always been re-
garded as enigmatic, a man who
puzzles his observers with contradic-
tions. Despite his obsession with facts,
his desire to document and base an
argument on the Government’s answers
to his questions, he is often sloppy. He
has made only five speeches in Parlia-
ment this year, fewer than most politi-
cal leaders. And they have contained a
surprising number of mistakes, most of
which have been picked up by assidu-
ous Whitlam critics on the Liberal
backbench, like Tom Hughes and Kevin
Cairns. David Fairbairn, Minister for
National Development, devoted a speech
to cataloguing mistakes made by Mr.
Whitlam and it turned out to be one
of the most effective he has made for
a long time. 'lnterestingly, in the
middle of that speech, when Fairbairn
was saying “I could go on indefinitely,”
the Prime Minister interjected “Keep
going,” recognition that Whitlam’s facts
and figures are his greatest strength
but often a weakness also. He had got
his figures wrong on the Government’s
economic aid, its spending in Queens-
land, whether the Chifley Government
placed orders for today’s military air-
craft, voting on New Guinea in the
UN, and so on: important items in his
heavily “facted” attacks on Government
performance.
Compared with Calwell, Whitlam is
most of the time cautious in his tactics.
Where the former leader believed in
maximum public exposure, Whitlam
appreciates the point that people get
sick of politicians’ pronouncements and
he is very wary of “over-exposure.” He
has, since becoming leader, been knock-
ing back lots of requests for appear-
ances on TV, despite the fact that he
uses that medium very well. In fact,
in his four months as leader he has
been interviewed on television only
once. The reason for this restraint,
according to staffers, is his desire to
establish new Labor policy and a new
Labor image without making people too
aware of the break by having to answer
questions which contrast his regime
with Calwell’s. He has also renounced
the doctrine of instant response, where-
by the leader of the Opposition always
makes an immediate comment on a
Government decision or statement or on
a newsworthy happening. He stands
back in Parliament, speaking less than
Calwell did.
On the other hand, he has a history
of impetuousness his “12 witless
men” description of his Federal Execu-
tive followed by an abject undignified
apology and his chucking a glass of
water over the Minister for External
Affairs are the most colorful events.
And though he has restrained himself
more since assuming leadership, there
has been in some of his Parliamentary
performances a certain extravagance
which savors more of smart debating
than serious criticism. His speech on
Mr. Holt’s return from his Asian tour
was notable for this. He spoke of the
Prime Minister’s “war against U
Thant,” and cited his criticism of the
Secretary-General’s views on the domino
theory and his silence over one of his
calls for negotiations. He said Mr.
Holt’s “hawkishness” was evident in an
expression of scepticism about the value
of a bombing pause. Because the Prime
Ministerial plane flew along the coast
of China rather than across it “M r -
Holt saw China but did not recognise
it.” His journey through Asia should
have been concerned with “reviewing
the moral issues” involved in the Viet-
nam war, a war which is now concerned
with “scorched earth, scorched children,
and scorched civilians.”
Whitlam has great wit, though it
is studied rather than spontaneous. It


wins admirers, but its one-uppish,
smartalecky qualities lose him respect.
Relations with the Press? The way
he is written up in some newspapers,
readers would think Whitlam is a
favorite of journalists. In fact this is
not so. Mr. Holt’s Press briefings are
far from impressive because of his in-
decisive manner of speaking, but sur-
prisingly are much better than Mr.
Whitlam’s. Most important, the PM will
say things, using the “off-the-record”
device well, where Mr. Whitlam will
ramble around the subject, or refuse
to comment, sometimes saying that
his “no comment” is off-the-record!
Surprisingly, too, Holt is actually more
precise and quickly to the point, Whit-
lam getting lost in irrelevant or trivial
details, like the flight numbers on his
aerial tour of Queensland. He will
ponderously dwell on his beloved page
references in Hansard, as if everyone
present thinks he is a liar in claiming
the Minister promised him an answer
to a question three years ago and he
still has not yet got it.
In private he tends to give the im-
pression of performing one act after
another often acts to impress,
occasionally an act to shock (like a
change of trousers in the middle of a
conversation in his office).
Still there is sufficient of the knocker
ln many people for them to like him
lor his irreverence and his deflation of
much that is pompous about men with
power.
But overall the assessment around
Parliament House is that so far Whit-
lam, the Labor leader, has been an
anti-climax. He has done fairly well
in improving the operations of the
Labor members in Parliament.
Questioning of Government ministers
has been slightly sharper as a result of
an attempt at co-ordination. Morale
within the Parliamentary Party is said
to be improved with the fixing of
agendas giving Caucus and Executive
debates more structure. And all regard
Whitlam as more presentable and de-
fensible a leader than Calwell. A system
of committees has been set up as usual,
but the difference will be that Whitlam
will work hard to make sure they meet
fairly regularly and produce reports.
In terms of Parliamentary tactics,
Mr. Whitlam has been unimpressive in
his first session. Backbench Liberals and
the DLP senators have often provided
more powerful opposition to the
Government than the Labor Party, and
this has not changed with Whitlam’s
accession to power.
The DLP led every stage of the
opposition to the postal charges; it has
very cleverly exploited the nexus
referendum and made the ALP look
like yes-men. In the Voyager affair the
demand for an inquiry was made by
the Jess-St. John-Turner combination
with the ALP rather meekly adding
their voice at a late stage. The most
obvious opportunities for embarrassing
the Government have been missed.
Thus, Mr. Sinclair, as acting Minister
for Trade, two weeks ago made a quite
blatant breach in Cabinet solidarity by
highlighting the shortcomings of the
Government’s Bankers Refinance Cor-
poration and canvassing the rival
Department of Trade scheme (knocked
back by Cabinet). And yet, as far as
the Labor Party was concerned, Mr.
Sinclair might not have made that
speech.
Of course, in the past, expectations
of Whitlam have been pitched very
high. Liberal Party officials used to
caution their people against attacking
Mr. Calwell and Dr. Cairns too vigor-
ously lest they be discredited, enabling
“that dangerous Whitlam” to get the
leadership. And consider two of the
predictions about Whitlam made just
17 months ago by Mr. Brian Johns, a
“Sydney Morning Herald” political
commentator: “He will return the
centre of gravity to the Parliamentary
Caucus by giving it unfettered leader-
ship.”
In bis first 100 days he hasn’t even
looked like breaking any of those fetters
with which the “faceless” and “witless”
machine-men constrain the Parlia-
mentary Party. On every occasion he
has confronted them he has been
beaten, put back in the straitjacket
of remaining in association with a Com-
munist peace front, and having to suffer
a Left-wing, union-dominated boss
organisation.
Mr. Whitlam and, for that matter,
none of the Right Wing of the Labor
Party appear to have the patient
deviousness required to wrest control
from the Left. Barring utter incompe-
tence or acts of political suicide on their
part, the centre of gravity of the Labor
Party will stay well away from its Par-
liamentary leader.
The other prediction was: “As a
leader, he (Whitlam) could well gener-
ate in the party, in the country, the
excitement of a Kennedy.” There is
just no sign of this. Whitlam’s in-
terests are likely to prove appealing to
people’s down-to-earth needs in the
1970s —better planning of cities so that
traffic congestion is alleviated and
housing better organised, an imagina-
tive adaptation to automation, a greater
concern for ethereal matters like the
“quality of life.”
His policies are likely to prove good
as humdrum policies, and he may be
able to persuade a number of people
that his administrative abilities are
superior to those of the Liberal leaders.
But excitement? As an orator Whitlam
is best in a sarcastic, destructive pos-
ture; he has no flare for new phrases,
for appealing to the imagination by
putting any exciting, positive content
into his speeches.
The Kennedys exude idealism and
sincerity, whatever else you think of
them, whereas Whitlam has always been
plagued by a variety of credibility gaps.
And I’m told he hasn’t their sex appeal.


Where East meets East
The communist Bank of China in Singapore... large in size and importance
From ALEX JOSEY in Singapore
WHEN THE Soviet Union signed a
trade agreement with Singapore on
April 2, 1966, the polite formalities of
the occasion were enacted by slim,
boyish Sim Kee Boon, a high-ranking
Singapore civil servant, and burly, ex-
perienced V. B. Spandarian, of the
Russian Ministry of Foreign Trade.
Smiles and signatures were exchanged,
champagne glasses raised in toasts to
sincerity and success, and Asia’s newest
and tiniest republic had made its first
trade pact with a communist country. It
contained clauses which permitted the
Russians to use cipher and to be exempt
from taxation. Singapore is, of course,
entitled to reciprocal privileges in
Moscow.
Nine days later Prime Minister Lee
Kuan-Yew left Singapore for a rapid
and extensive tour of Eastern Europe
and Austria. In Warsaw, Budapest,
Bucharest, Sofia, and Prague he in-
spected military guards-of-honor, was
toasted at banquets, slept in old palaces,
went round factories and art galleries,
all the while explaining very carefully
that he was a Socialist, not a Commun-
ist, and was very interested in develop-
ing trade with anyone.
Lee was back in Singapore on June 1,
but the Bulgarians w'ere there before
him. Mr. Peter Stefanov said he had
come to establish contact with local
capitalists. The Poles were breathing
dowm the Bulgarians’ necks, and they
busily worked out a trade agreement
under w'hich 75 percent of the proceeds
of the Polish goods Singapore bought
would be used by Poland to buy Singa-
pore-made goods. By August 19, Mr.
Primerov, the Russian Trade Commis-
sioner, speaking fluent Malay (Singa-
pore’s national language), had arrived
to open his office. He has two assistants.
Later in the year came the Hungarians
(followed by the North Koreans and
the Austrians), and, in December, Dr.
Stefan Voinov began to negotiate a
trade agreement on behalf of Rumania.
The position today is that Singapore
has trade agreements with the Soviet
Union, Bulgaria, Poland, Rumania, and
Hungary. Each nation has an office,
and each Trade Commissioner has two
assistants, as well as some local employ-
ees. Sergei Svirin of Tass works alone
(his wife looks after their daughter).
The Czechs operate from their Zlin
Company, but they have no formal
trade agreement. The Yugoslavs have
been here for years, looking after their
shipping line. So, altogether, there are
rather less than 20 East Europeans in
Singapore. Somehow, they seem a lot
when you see them at a diplomatic
party.
A common feature of all the bilateral
agreements is that the East European
countries will sell Singapore their manu-
factures and also buy Singapore-made
goods. Rubber is not considered to be
a Singapore-made commodity. Which
is just as well, for in the first four
months of this year the Soviet Union
bought rubber worth 121 million Singa-
pore dollars from the Singapore market.
But they’ve bought hardly any Singa-
pore-made goods. Singapore industrial-
ists are hoping this state of affairs will
improve: they say that now that Malay-
sia has unexpectedly welcomed the Rus-
sians to Kuala Lumpur, to set up an
Embassy, the Soviet Union soon will be
in a good position to play the three
rubber markets, in London, Singapore,
and Kuala Lumpur, to the advantage
of the Soviet Union. The Singapore
merchants say they would be mugs if
they don’t. This development has caused
Singapore business circles again to speak
of the urgent need for Singapore and
Malaysia to get together, to co-operate,
to avoid this sort of thing.
Singapore traders have already a very
healthy regard for the tough Bulgarian
trade representative, Mr. Stanchev.
He is reputed to drive a hard bargain,
and is said to know all the modern
methods and techniques of ruthless
trading. “He’d be a millionaire in the
capitalists’ world in next to no time,”
a Government official told me. This was
another reason why Singapore and
Malaysia should act in concert. The
Communists are proving they are not
duffers at trading, and they could not
be blamed if they took advantage of
conflicting economic policies. It was up
to Malaysia and Singapore to get
together to stop this.
Bulgaria aims to sell $3 million worth
of Bulgarian goods to Singapore and
to buy about the same amount of
Singapore-made goods. So far they’ve
bought about a quarter of a million
dollars’ worth, mainly as the result of
Singapore’s participation in the Plovid
Fair. And they’ve sold Singapore about
$217,000 worth of Bulgarian-made
goods. Poland, like the Soviet Union,
has not yet started buying Singapore-
made goods, but has succeeded in selling
Singapore about a quarter of a million
dollars’ worth of Polish manufactures.
When I asked the Minister of
Finance, Mr. Lim Kim San, how things
were going generally, he said that trade
with Bulgaria was going well, and he
expected trade with the other East
European countries to catch up once-
Singapore has a wider range of goods
to offer. He said there were no joint
ventures in sight. Mr. Lim explained
that the Government normally preferred
joint ventures between businessmen
rather than between nations. He said
that Singapore’s Socialism did not rule
out direct Government participation in
industry—in fact, the Economic
Development Board, a Government
agency, is involved in the Jurong Ship-
yard and in other concerns, but the
policy was to sell-out once these con-
cerns were safely established. The
Government’s role then would be a
watchdog for the workers.
Sergei Svirin of Tass, meanwhile, has
joined the exclusive Tanglin Club
(where Russian caviar and vodka have
long been on sale), as well as the
masses’ swimming club, and on guest
night drinks his whisky and soda with
the rest of us at the officers’ mess in
the heavily guarded Phoenix Park,
longtime headquarters of Britain’s mili-
tary might east of Suez. Sergei is now
vice-president of the Foreign Corres-
pendents’ Association.
Singapore’s relations with East Europe
can, therefore, be said to be pleasant
and correct in all spheres, and trade is
hopeful.
As for neutral Singapore’s relations
and trade with China, the facts are:
(a) there is no official contact (the
Peking regime has never directly
attacked Lee Kuan-Yew and his
Government, though Peking Radio does
broadcast attacks by others), (b) th e
Bank of China is among
biggest buildings, and (c) Singapore s
capitalists sell millions of dollars’ worth
of China-made goods at cut-price in
three large emporiums. Trade with
China is heavily in China’s favor.

New Pilgrim’s Progress
By DICK HOOKER
I WAS about 12 when I decided to be
a priest. I didn’t know what I was
doing, of course, but then one rarely
does at that age. Looking back, I can’t
say that I remember why I made such
a decision; certainly it was an unusual
one for a boy at the expensive Church
school I attended.
Having reached such a conclusion, I
went to see the Chaplain and asked him
what subjects I ought to take, if such
was to be my fate. I knew that his
reaction would be memorable he
was a man given somewhat to memor-
able reactions—and it was. “I wouldn’t
worry, son,” he said. “You’d never
make it.”
Letting me gnash my teeth on this
for a while, he grasped me by the hair
as I came out of school a few days
later, and hissed into my ear, “Latin.
Lots of Latin and history.” I felt
satisfied.
As time went on, I found no reason
to change my mind. Lots of Latin books
and lots of history books filled my
locker, although a minimum of their
contents was absorbed in my brain.
When I was 15 I went into the top
Latin form, the Master of which being
a man who apparently thought the best
way to teach irregular verbs was to
belt them in through the backside with
an ancient shillelagh he carried about
for the purpose. He was a bastard, so
I dropped Latin in favor of economics,
and concentrated on history. For the
latter subject we had a brilliant but
emotional scholar, a graduate of three
universities, as our Master. All his class
got honors. When the Leaving results
were published I got honors in
economics but only a B in history,
and believe I was the only student
whom that Master didn’t write to to
congratulate on passing.
It didn’t matter, though. I had
matriculated; that was the main thing.
The Bishop was delighted when I told
him. Later I learned that I was the
only one of his aspiring candidates who
had matriculated. “You must go to the
University, my boy,” he cried, and pro-
ceeded to tell me of all the high jinks
he had got up to at Cambridge, or
Oxford, or somewhere. But that had
been a long time before, and a month
after my interview he died. I was very-
sorry, for he was a nice old boy, and
I dropped a little bead for his soul.
After his funeral I heard somebody say
that if he had been as interested in
finances as he was in philosophy the
diocese wouldn’t be so close to bank-
ruptcy.
The next Bishop was very interested
in finances. He summoned me to an
interview, asked me how much I had
in the bank, was not impressed by the
This is an account of life in an
Anglican theological college in Aus-
tralia. All the incidents described took
place within the past 15 years.
reply, and told me to go out to work
for a year, preferably at something-
dirty, and earn some more. “Don’t for-
get to say your prayers,” he added.
“Come back to see me next Christmas.”
So for a year I worked at jobs, the
dirtiness of which I hoped would
receive due episcopal approval, and said
my prayers. By Christmas I was more
solvent, and went again to see his Lord-
ship. My entry to the University was
approved, and off I went.
Being an undergraduate was a very
pleasant way of filling in time. I read
a lot of books, wrote a lot of rubbish,
went to a lot of parties, and drank a
lot of beer. Here and there I passed
the odd exam until finally, semi-
educated and penniless, I was ready to
enter the Theological College. •
The preliminary to entering the col-
lege was a round of interviews with
ancient Canons and Archdeacons
Emeritus, one half of whom required
reassurance that I was a Christian, and
the other half of whom demanded re-
assurance that I had no intention of
marrying, at least until the diocese had
had a few years’ w'ork out of me. Appar-
ently I managed to satisfy them, for a
few weeks later I had a letter from the
college telling me to report at 2 p.m.
the following Monday, equipped with
cassock, surplice, gown, hymnbook, and
Evidence of Baptism.
An earnest young man wearing a
green badge with a yellow lamp greeted
me at the door and showed me round.
He asked if I belonged to the Scripture
Union, and on being told no asked me
if I was a Christian. Dutifully I pro-
duced the Evidence of Baptism from my
pocket. Further examination was post-
poned, as we had arrived at a door
with my name on it. Turning the knob,
he ushered me in and went off on his
search for a Christian.
The room wasn’t bad; it measured
about 15 by 15 and had a large window
opening out over the street. One wall
had a fireplace, and another was decor-
ated by a cracked glass frame encasing
a gaily lettered poster which read, “The
Wages of Sin is Death. Romans 6; 23.”
The unpacking process was fairly
drawn-out, as the bookshelf held only
50 of the 300 books I had brought;
however, order was achieved to the
extent that the ghastly indictment on
the wall had been replaced by a beauti-
ful hand-carved crucifix, a gift from mv
vicar, when I received my first visitor
I had first heard him through the
open door, talking to the man across
the corridor. One voice was saying that
there were eight men in our section of
the college, and the other voice had
wanted to know if they were all
Christians. The first voice replied
that theological colleges were a great
missionary field, which was met by the
other voice saying that he’d heard that
Satan was very active here.
A moment later there was a sniff in
the doorway. It proved to be a young
man even more earnest in countenance
than the first. “Greetings in the Name
of the Saviour,” he said, and sniffed
again.
“Hullo,” I said, and as biblical words
seemed to be the order of the day
added “Amen!” (I couldn’t think of
anything else.) “Like a cup of coffee?”
“No, thanks, brother* I don’t drink
stimulants. I’ve been a Christian for
nine years.”
He seemed to expect some reply. I
didn’t realise then that there was a
recognised antiphonal response (“Praise
the Lord! I’ve been saved for only
eight”).
Receiving no reply, he plunged
straight into his cross-examination.
“Are you a Christian?” he asked.
For a second or two I cast about for
a suitable answer; obviously the
Evidence of Baptism would be irrelevant
to this man also. But no answer
became necessary, for his eyes, darting
around the room, had alighted on the
crucifix.
“Oh, no!” he cried, and in manifest
horror rushed from the room. From
that moment I w'as neatly pigeonholed
“unsaved.”
Within a w'eek or so life had settled
down to some sort of routine, and. I
had met one or two friends from former
days at the university, including one
whom I shall call D.
After breakfast we had Morning
Prayer more or less (mostly less) as set
out in the Book of Common Prayer. On
occasional saints’ days this was replaced
by Holy Communion, if anybody re-
membered. Every morning there was a
sermon, usually by one of the staff, but
once a week the whole college was sub-
jected to a Prac. Sermon by a final-year
man.
Most of the final-year men seemed
to fancy themselves as potential Billy
Grahams, exhibiting much pulpit-
thumping, cries of “The Bible says . . •
and random rhetoric. After each of
these efforts we had to sit around in
the lecture-room under the chairman-
ship of the vice-principal, or some
other discreet and learned minister, for
a period of “constructive criticism.” The
sermon was usually shot to pieces by
swift darts of pseudo-scholarship,
although some of the more convincing
evangelists received praise.
Monday to Friday mornings were
filled with lectures—Old Testament,
New Testament, Doctrine, Prayer-
Book, Greek, Church History, and so
on. I was a little surprised to find that
the textbooks set for Doctrine had been
written by a 16th-century Presbyterian,
but the general opinion seemed to be
that it was more important for writers
on Doctrine to be Christian than Angli-
can —with which view I certainly
agreed, for my own thought seemed
more in line with that of a 12th-century
Dominican. For the sake of academic
discussion D. and I once introduced
Tillich and Mascall into a lecture-room
debate. Shortly afterward 11 students
had a prayer meeting for our conver-
sion.
From time to time w'e had visiting-
lecturers for special subjects. One was
a fiery archdeacon whose delight w'as
the discomfort, if not the downfall, of
Rome. He regaled us w'ith lurid stories
of what "Popish” priests did if a mouse
broke into a tabernacle and ate the
Sacred Host, and what was required
of a confessor on hearing a penitent
confess to having put arsenic in the
Chalice. He boasted long and loud
about the number of “papists” he had
converted from their ways although
he never told us the arguments he
used.
We had a lecturer in Voice Produc-
tion, too: well qualified in that he
was of “sound” churchmanship and
owned a brand-new r tape-recorder. The
latter was a very fine machine w'hich
recorded with superb fidelity the click
of its owmer’s false teeth as he demon-
strated its w'onders to us.
In the afternoons there were no
formal lectures, as most of the men
were assigned to work in parishes. The
kind of w'ork and the remuneration
varied from parish to parish, depending
partly on the nature of the area, but
more on the temper of the rector. I
lasted ten days at my first church,
where my cousin Kath sang a fine
soprano in the choir. I took Kath to
a ball at the university one Saturday,
and the following day w'as accused by
the rector of inciting young choir-girls
to sin. He said that dancing could
lead to terrible sin; that he knew' of
girls who had started by going to
“innocent” dances, then had started
painting themselves” with lipstick, and
had then finished up by having babies.
A few sentences of biological instruc-
tion rose to my lips, but before I could
otter them he went further.
’I can tell you,” said the rector,
“that when I was courting my wife
we never went dancing for that
reason.”
I replied that I was very sorry but
I thought I had rather more control
over my sex life than that.
The rector looked shocked, then said
it w'as obvious that I hadn’t yet found
Christ, adding, “Before you go, we’ll
just have a friendly word of prayer,
shall we?” So w'e fell to prayer, and the
rector prayed long and hard that I
would Find Christ and Know Joy.
A few days later I met another rector
and told him of his colleague’s opinion
that I hadn’t found Christ. There was
a pause. “Oh?” he said softly. “I didn’t
know He was lost.”
Here was a man after my own heart.
Having solved the problem of the
Lord’s whereabouts, I began working in
this man’s parish and remained there
for nearly two years, during which time
I didn’t hear the rector criticised once.
He loved his people and they loved
him, not caring that it was so long
since he’d had time to read a book
that his theology wouldn’t have saved
a rabbit. I am glad that w'e are saved
by grace, not by theology.
I was far happier in my parish than
H. was in his. “I can’t understand it,”
H. once confided in me. “When the
rector’s preaching, the church is always
full, but when I’m preaching, the
people stay away. I just can’t under-
stand it, because I preach the Gospel
and the rector doesn’t.”
Each evening a bell called us to
attend Chapel for Evening Prayer.
Then we had dinner. Dinner during the
week was a formal affair, attended by
all the staff, with the whole college
suitably dressed and gowmed, and most
of us trying desperately to keep our
long sleeves out of the soup.
As nobody seemed to know' much
about anything else, table conversation
was perforce confined to subjects con-
cerning religion and sex. Not that they
knew much about the latter, except that
it was evil, and they wanted to know-
all about it so that they w'ould know-
how to avoid it. I suppose there is a
time and place for everything, but per-
sonally I found discussion of erogenous
zones rather distasteful over a plate of
greasy stew'.
The menu was similarly monotonous.
We could always count on fish on
Thursday night and prime roast beef
on Fridays. The cook was a Protestant.
On Saturday nights, however, the
evening meal was simple and informal.
The staff stayed away to sample their
w'ives’ gastronomical attempts, and as
the bell rang the rest of the herd simply
rushed into the dining-room, clad how-
ever one was, grabbed a plate of salad
and a mug of tea, said grace, and shoved
it in. After that the night w ? as one’s
owm.
One Saturday I was going to a 21st
birthday party and had to pick up my
sister on the other side of the city. So
I dressed before tea and joined the
shirt-and-shorts mob in my dinner suit.
There was a stony silence, followed by
low w'hispers—and the following day
I was reprimanded by a senior man for
being “improperly dressed at dinner.”
When I laughed, he said simply, “Chris-
tians don’t go to places where it’s neces-
sary to dress like that”—and the subject
was closed.
The evenings after dinner were set
aside for study until 9.30 p.m., when
we could brew' coffee, yarn wdth our
mates, or—if the Spirit moved us —have
prayer meetings. I must confess that it
was my own habit to brew coffee and
yarn with my mates first, then study
afterwards.
The Brews were quite pleasant times;
one brought a mug or cup to somebody’s
room and the host poured into it a con-
stant stream of hot black coffee. We
sat around the room, in chairs or on the
floor, played cards or scrabble and
talked about the football competition,
the state of the world, the day’s lec-
tures, new books, and, occasionally,
religion. At least, that’s what D’s Brew
Group did.
Apparently, others had different
ideas. We were asked once to a Brew
by A., a slim, pink senior who
began the Brew with a word of prayer
asking for God’s blessing on the gather-
ing, which done he spread a lace-edged
lilac tablecloth on the desk and pro-
ceeded to bring out his mother’s finest
silver candlesticks and bone china tea-
cups (complete with rose petals). Fairy-
cakes, Twining’s tea (twenty-six bob a
pound), and A’s Testimony followed.
The latter was a sorrowfful lament on
the influence of the naughty Anglo-
Catholics, and how we must all strive
to put away childish things like pretty
vestments and altar lights.
It sounded a bit hollow' in that
atmosphere, so when A. suggested w r e
Fall to Prayer a second time, D. pro-
posed a decade of the Rosary, which
the rest of us joined in immediately.
It was the only time D. has ever said
the Rosary, and it was most effective:
A. never asked us back.
We were fortunate in being reason-
ably close to the University, where a
group of my friends used to gather in
the evenings to drink lots of port and
argue about the existence of God. D.
and I went over there regularly, and
in the course of a year managed to
revise about half the Summa Theologica

all—of the world’s problems.
About the middle of the year we had
exams, which were rather trifling after
the university standard to which D. and
I w 7 ere accustomed. I was a little con-
cerned about the outcome of the Doc-
trine paper, for in all conscience I felt
bound to exhibit my knowledge of
Anglican rather than Presbyterian
authors. The lecturer was very fair,
however. For one essay on the Sacra-
ments he gave me 19 out of 20, and
pencilled neatly below the mark: This
view is quite mistaken.
When the results were pinned up D.'s
name and mine both appeared near the
top, so for a time we felt a little more
at home.
Our relative success in the Doctrine
exam did not stem the steady stream
of uplifting tracts (“The Way of Salva-
tion,” “The Bible or the Pope?" etc.)
which the Christians were wont to slip
under our doors. Not that they had
any effect; we simply put them in the
Principal’s letterbox. It was difficult not
to notice, though, a certain caution in
the attitude of some students toward
us. It transpired that our names were
being mentioned more and more fre-
quently at prayer meetings around the
college, to none of which were we
invited. Nor did we despise our fellows
for this; on the contrary, we were glad
to have their prayers. Indeed, when we
heard that one particular group had
prayed for our “conversion” we felt
quite flattered, for we knew that they
prayed frequently for the “conversion”
of the Archbishop of Canterbury. With
such company we had no quarrel.
These prayer meetings were a fas-
cinating feature of college life, pro-
viding, as they did, a wealth of material
for speculation to anyone with a work-
ing knowledge of Freudian psychology.
I will never forget my first experience
of “chain prayer” at one of these meet-
ings. For those whose godly and vir-
tuous upbringing has not included a
session of “chain prayer” I should
explain that the method is for all par-
ticipants to stand around in a circle;
the leader offers a single petition to the
Almighty, which is followed by a second
petition from the person on his left, and
a third from the next person, and so on
around the circle. After each petition
the circle murmurs “Amen” or hisses
“Yes, Lord!" (as the Spirit moves them,
no doubt). Sometimes tw'o or three cir-
cuits of the circle are completed, in
which case, if the gathering is large, it
is a good idea to wear soft shoes —it is
very difficult to withdraw' from such
fetish rituals gracefully. Withdrawal, in
any case, is more apt to be ascribed to
“lack of the Spirit” than tired feet.
It was a brilliant autumn afternoon
•when I was first initiated into this rite,
and my previous liturgical experience
(a la BCP) left me totally unprepared
for it. I remember little of the petitions,
except those of a newly made deacon,
who stood diametrically opposite. When
his first turn came, he said, “Lord, bless
the Bishop of North Queensland, and
set him on fire.” “Amen, yes, Lord!”
chorused the circle. After a circuit his
turn came again, and he prayed, “Lord,
bless the Bishop of New Guinea and set
him on fire.” “Amen. Yes, Lord!” they
chorused. The third time it was “Lord,
bless the Bishop of Rockhampton and
set him on fire.” “Yes, Lord! Amen! Yes,
Lord!”
And so it went on, each reputedly
Anglo-Catholic bishop receiving a peti-
tion according to his scale on the local
churchmanship chart. Before long I was
having visions of an enormous episcopal
conflagration in the north.
This preoccupation with and scaling
of other people’s churchmanship was
new r to me, and try as I might I could
develop no enthusiasm for it. Not even
the Evangelicals seemed to stick
together; groups of Strict Evangelicals,
Conservative Evangelicals, and Liberal
Evangelicals eyed each other sus-
piciously. D. and I determined to be
merely Anglicans and slipped merrily
up and down the scale, espousing any
position from Anglo-Catholic through
Liberal High Churchman to Central
Churchman to Moderate Evangelical,
depending on whichever w'e thought
would be most annoying. Of course, we
came to be regarded generally as having
no convictions whatever, and some of
the men even learned to spell Lati-
tudinarianism for our benefit.
It was some time before I learned
that the churchmanship issue was a very
real one to these people, and that it
went far deeper than an academic dis-
pute about the exact dates of the second
year of the reign of King Edward the
Sixth. It was not until I overheard two
deacons talking that it became apparent
that to Evangelicals the basic problem
was neither legal nor doctrinal but
psychological. “I don’t think I could
preach the Gospel,” said one, “if I was
wearing a stole.”
After this there seemed to be no point
in worrying about it. D. and I went on
studying, kept on saying our prayers,
remained—to the others “unsaved.”
When I heard that not so long before
one of the Christians had broken into
the room of another friend of mine to
take his crucifix and nail it to the lava-
tory door, I could feel the very warmth
of the bonfire around Servetus.
Just at this time I met another Bishop
and discussed the matter with him fully.
He said flatly that he regarded the
Doctrine taught in my college as heresy.
That wms enough: I resolved to return
to “the world.”
D. thought he’d stick it out for
another year. But a member of the staff
told him that he had too much spiritual
pride to have a genuine vocation. I
know' that D. wept over that —he had
never doubted his priestly calling —but
today, like me, he is not a priest but
a layman.

London— Australia's Far West
THE COMMONWEALTH ... a never-ending series of obligations
HERE IN THE London Prime Minis-
ter Harold Holt will visit on June 12,
in the place Australians should, after
all, regard as their “Far West,” it is
no longer a question of if but when
the British military presence will pull
out of the Far East.
Looked at from the Far East end of
affairs it might be natural to wonder
if Britain will either persevere with
purpose or retreat with honor. But
here it soon becomes obvious that honor
is an old-fashioned concept, and pur-
pose conspicuous by its national and
political absence. The drift to indif-
ference is set, the direction, toward
withdrawal, unmistakable.
The need to reinforce the East Com-
mand during Indonesian confrontation
and General de Gaulle’s first emphatic
“Non” seem, in retrospect, to have
gone against the historical grain, with-
out altering the underlying trends. As
a result they may have given many,
not least Canberra, false expectations.
It seems more relevant to remember
that one of the assumptions of the
1957 manpower plan was that there
would be no British soldier east of
Suez by 1960.
What are the pressures which make
this drift and direction more inevitable
than regrettable? First and last are the
economic ones, real and imagined.
There is real economic pressure —
and there isn’t. The Government has
chosen to meet Britain’s economic crisis
with policies of deflation and constric-
tion. Inevitably, deflating the size of
the armed services east and west of
Suez and constricting Britain’s com-
mitments (“overstretch” is the prevail-
ing jargon) follow as a result. Those
who argue that policies of growth would
be a better answer could then also
argue that the east of Suez economic
burden is neither here nor there—but
in my experience don’t, usually for
political reasons.
The point is that such policies have
not been chosen. The arbitrary choice
of a 1970 defence budget ceiling of
£2OOO million (SASOOO million) —-
at 1966 price levels has become a
self-generating pressure of its own, to be
met at all costs, even those of defence.
Cutting commitments should have been,
in logic, the precursor of such a target.
In politics, it has happened the other
way round, and so niggling away at all
costs has become the order of the day.
But, ultimately, the choice will be
either abandoning the target or re-
defining Britain’s defence interests in
much narrower terms.
In this respect, the political pressures
are crucial. Given this choice, it requires
no feat of political imagination to be
certain that the present government
would prefer to end Britain’s “world-
wide role.” Faced with a restive elec-
torate, increasingly concerned with the
many things wrong at home, there are
few votes for any government to gain
by displaying concern for what is going
w’rong far away. Even if this were not
so, there is little proven capacity in the
leaderships of either Party, with the
honorable exception of Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, to articulate how Far
Eastern needs are British compulsions.
Further, and more compellingly, there
is the need of the present government
to grapple with Left-wing dissidence.
Mr. Wilson has put down one revolt on
east of Suez policy. With other revolts
threatening would he do it again?
Admittedly, those sixty-odd Laborites
who abstained in this year’s Defence
Debate did not take their convictions
that far the year previously when Wilson
had only a wafer-thin majority. But the
“rebels” succeeded in getting a motion
passed at last year’s Labor Party Con-
ference in favor of fairly speedy with-
drawal.
This year the Government will need
party approval of the approach to
Europe and consequently may be more
inclined to throw the “dogs” an east
of Suez bone rather than (as Wilson
threatened) revoke their “dog licences.”
On top of this, Labor’s larger than
usual reverses in local elections this
spring have been attributed to many
Labor voters staying at home. On
economics and Europe Mr. Wilson is
distinguishable from the Conservatives
only in his (more effective) style and
personality. Cutting defence expendi-
ture and eliminating a major imperial
hang-over (which is how the east or
Suez presence is widely regarded)
would seem one safe way of reviving'

socialist enthusiasm or, at least, prov-
ing his socialist bona fides.
Disillusion with the Commonwealth
is now widespread. The Rhodesia ques-
tion has not done any good, either. It
has only helped—as has the Aden crisis
___ to underline the conviction that the
Commonwealth represents a never-end-
ing series of obligations, an eternal drain
on scarce resources, a tie to the past
rather than a lifeline to the future.
It might be that Mr. Heath will
reverse roles with Mr. Wilson. But for
the present he is still the ardent
champion of Europe, and looks likely
to remain so. If hopes are entertained
(in Canberra? Washington?) that the
Tories would be pro-east of Suez, then
it is as well to remember the comment
of one close observer of the Westmin-
ster scene “if the Tories were in,
we might hang on longer, but if the
presence has to be removed by the time
the next election comes round, and they
win, then the presence will not be
restored.”
This last is no longer such a big
“if.” The numerous leaks to responsible
newspapers in London and Washington
over the past few weeks leave little
room for doubting that the British
Government is considering and has
contingency plans for withdrawal
from Malaysia and Singapore by 1970-
71, or, to put it less categorically, at a
speed which is as unexpected as it is
FROM HARVEY STOCKWIN IN LONDON
unacceptable to Washington and Can-
berra. Hence the leaks in the U.S.
capital at the time Mr. Brown attended
the recent SEATO meeting and the
emergency Australian Cabinet meeting
which followed it. The leaks in Lon-
don, presuming (as is customary) that
they were intentional, are less easy to
explain. Conceivably they were a sop
to Labor rebels. Maybe they were in-
tended to indicate British leanings to
European neutralism. More likely they
were a means to gauge U.S. and
ANZAC reactions. Sufficient, perhaps,
to note that when the ex-British High
Commissioner in Australia, Lord Car-
rington, pressed the Government
spokesman, Lord Chalfont, in the Lords
Defence debate, to “confirm that he is
denying categorically that any idea of
British abandonment in the early 1970 s
of the base in Singapore has been
floated either in Washington or in Aus-
tralia,” no such denial was given.
Can substantial external pressure,
mainly Australamerican, induce Britain
to stay east of Suez? Certainly it might
serve to delay the inevitable, but “stay-
ing,” except in such a greatly reduced
form as to be ineffective, power-wise, is
unlikely. After all, the question really
is:— “Can external pressures reverse
domestic ones?” As a general rule, even
a ßies can only push each other on a
path they would in any case take.
Britain’s direction is toward Europe.


OVERSEAS
Hong Kong’s long hot summer
WHETHER OR NOT Peking ordered
or approved the injection of Maoist
tactics into the Hong Kong rioting,
the consequent showdown was quickly
the worst situation for the • Colony-
Government since the Japanese moved
across the border in 1941.
Never one to overlook the chance
of having a good go at the foreign
devil as a useful avenue for working-
off some cultural revolutionary steam,
Chairman Mao was prompt in turning
the rioting into an international inci-
dent. Peking’s demands for settlement
of the dispute were analogous with what
happened when the Portuguese were
humiliated in Macao at the end of
last year. Would Britain now “do a
Macao” in Hong Kong? The mere fact
that the question was being asked was
disturbing in itself.
It was serious enough for the most
complacent of British thinking along
“it can’t happen here” lines to be
jolted into anxious reappraisals, as
mobs chanting Mao - thought ram-
paged around the Colony.
Hong Kong’s traditional self-assur-
ance that China would not move into
the Colony was all along based on the
belief that Peking had too much money
to lose. China earns about half its
foreign exchange over $5OO million
a year in Hong Kong. A lot of this
comes from the sale of Chinese goods
and from remittances of Chinese living-
in the Colony. If China marched the
People’s Liberation Army over the
border, it could expect to lose all this
foreign currency. Against these losses
it could set the profits of the industries
it would confiscate.
But it would not be able to count on
Arrest of a Red Guard in Hong Kong
keeping Hong Kong’s present export
markets, for a third of them are in the
United States and would immediately
disappear.
So runs the economic case for hoping
that the Chinese will keep their hands
off the Colony. It would be more con-
vincing if the Chinese hadn’t cut their
economic throat for political purposes
before. But they have. If the Chinese
were intent on a major political victory
by taking over Hong Kong neither the
Queen’s 8500 men nor all Hong Kong’s
exchange-earning capacity would deter
them.
But China’s purposes might be equally
well served by something less than a
takeover —by a pressure campaign that
stops just short of endangering its Hong
Kong dollars and yet secures a political
triumph by humiliating one of the great
powers. In short, another Macao, onlv
bigger.
Lights were on well into the night in
Government House last week as Sir
David Trench summoned Colonial
Office men, foreign diplomats, Chinese
and British businessmen and editors to a
succession of briefings. When Sir David,
only recently out of hospital after nasal
surgery, made a single foray out of
Government House to play golf, Left-
wing newspapers were quick to record
the event, along with the “evacuation”
of Lady Trench’s poodle, Peter, report-
edly upset by the clamor outside.
With the political winds blowing
threatening storm clouds over the China
border, Hong Kong realised that what-
ever turn events took it was un-
doubtedly in for a long, hot summer.
Britain and the EEC
Too many aces
IF MAY BE a long, long time before
Britain gets into the Common Market
—if at all. This week’s Rome meeting
.of the six EEC members and the
chilly de Gaulle speech of two weeks
ago have meant that one of the key
requirements of Mr. Flarold Wilson’s
getting-into-Europe technique main-
taining a “momentum”—has now been
quite thoroughly brushed aside.
And without “momentum” the
chances of success seem very poor
indeed. The delays that Britain now
faces mean that a lot of changes will
Londoners against the Common Market
have taken place in the structure and
working of the EEC by the time Britain
has any real chance of getting in; it
seems most unlikely that Britain can
now hope to be in a position to help
decide on the EEC’s permanent struc-
ture, which must be settled by 1970.
It is too easy to dismiss the French
objections as the “Economist” does,
as a personal veto “motivated above
all by an old man's conservative
objections to any disturbance of things
as they are,” and to conclude that if
Britain cannot get into Europe over
76-year-old de Gaulle’s live body, it
will have to await the probability of
getting in over his dead one.
The French have good reason to be
suspicious of Britain’s application.
There is more involved than the fear
that Britain may take a more powerful
role than France in a new Europe;
there is the genuine and well-founded
fear that Britain wants to join only
in order to make use of Europe.
In the four years since Britain’s last
rebuff, the British have not done much
to remove the basic objections raised
by France at that time, except that
the Commonwealth problem has gone
a fair way toward solving itself.
There can be no doubt that Wilson
is still looking over his shoulder
to see where else he can play his cards
if he gets non-suited in talking with
the Europeans.
The French point out that Britain
conducted herself at the hard bargain-
ing in the Kennedy Round very much
as if she were an independent country,
not one that saw herself as a potential
part of the EEC. Mr. Wilson has
come to the EEC negotiating-table like
a card player with one ace in his
hand and five up his sleeve —and none
of them in trumps. No matter how
impressive these aces —sterling, the U.S.
Alliance, domestic agriculture, EFTA,
and.the Commonwealth (in that order)
—may be in other negotiations, they
can all be trumped in this company.
It is remarkable that the U.K.’s
strongest pro-marketeers recognise that
Britain must hold the first two aces
no matter what; yet the French are

adamant that sterling simply cannot
continue as a reserve currency, as they
will not have a “weak” currency
(artificially supported because of its
world role) admitted to the EEC.
For example, the “Economist,”
which is very strongly in favor of
British entry, agrees that even if
Britain should move toward the Euro-
pean system in matters fiscal, agricul-
tural, and industrial, she should not do
so in matters monetary.
It says: “There is nothing un-
European in saying that the right place
for Britain to look for monetary co-
operation is now not the EEC but the
United States.”
There is always the sneaking suspicion
that Wilson did not really expect to get
in; that his object was to accentuate
any disagreements that may have existed
between the six.
In any event, there is some evidence
that the British have not fully worked
out why they want to get into Europe,
anyway; there are even suggestions that
de Gaulle’s strong stand against the
British has made him Britain’s saviour
and that it would have been disastrous
for Britain to have gone into the EEC.
Nevertheless, the latest moves on the
EEC front have brought a fair deal of
gloom to Britain: President de Gaulle’s
statement has “struck a new blow at
both industrial confidence and sterling’s
shaky convalescence” at a time when
prices in Britain are rising, when the
trade figures are adverse, and when
there are indications that unemploy-
ment is likely to rise by more than
Mr. Callaghan bargained for in last
month’s budget (so much so that the
Government must now be seriously con-
sidering giving some further boost to
internal activity).
The Common Market was to have
been Mr. Wilson’s circus; now he will
have to supply bread.
United States
Anti-war cries
AS THE BOMBING of North Viet-
nam has been stepped up, detestation
of the war has crystallised in the
United States, with more and more
responsible churchmen and academic
people protesting openly and bitterly.
Whatever happens, the Administration’s
war will be an albatross around Demo-
cratic necks when it comes to the
presidential election.
There is a growing feeling that oppor-
tunities for peace are being missed for
political reasons, that President John-
son is imprisoned in his own policy
and that a fresh look and a fresh face
are needed. No one feels enthusiastic
about him now and his popularity,
already down, would probably plummet
sharply if a clear alternative were
offered.

is not clear, least of all to the Repub-
licans, who will have to offer it next
year and who have a great opportunity
if only they can take it. “There’s a
better way than LBJ,” says the Repub-
lican Governor Romney of Michigan,
hoping to be chosen to show it. But so
far he adheres pretty closely to his
party’s official line; this is to go along
with the Administration since it is un-
patriotic to differ in time of war, while
pointing out that the decisions are the
President’s and criticising both the
details of what is being done and the
past policy that brought about the
present situation.
An effort to show that it was not the
Republican President Eisenhower but
the Democratic President Kennedy who
involved the United States in war in
Vietnam was behind the recent staff
study for the Republican Policy Com-
mittee in the Senate which ended up
by asking what interest the United
States had in South-East Asia. The
question was seized upon by the liberal
Republicans as the starting point for
an independent party line on Vietnam.
But the report was hastily suppressed
by the embarrassed leaders, who think
that the time has not yet come if
indeed it ever will come to oppose
the war openly. “We will not make the
war an issue,” says Senator Dirksen,
“the people wijl make it an issue.”
AN "ECONOMIST" REPORT
Indonesia
Corruption charges
IN CONTRAST WITH the goodwill it
first attracted from many parts of the
world, Indonesia’s New Order has been
suffering some moral setbacks. First
there was the growing foreign criticism
of the country’s handling of its “Chinese
problem.” And last week the Adminis-
tration was encountering some moral
checks entirely on home ground, mainly
over charges of malpractice and corrup-
tion in the armed forces.
But in a country which has always
had a keen national sensitivity it is
perhaps encouraging that there are
emerging signs of self-criticism
probably the best means of meeting
criticism from outside Indonesia.
The most vocal criticism was in
Bandung last week at a rally Acting
President Suharto attended to mark
the 21st anniversary of the crack Sili-
wangi army corps. Anti-communist
Kami Front university students, carry-
ing banners denouncing army corrup-
tion, broke up the rally, and General
Suharto left under escort.

A Djakarta newspaper satirises one of
Indonesia’s social problems: rich young
men with nothing better to do than race
their expensive cars through the streets.
One of Sukarno’s sons, Guruh Sukarno-
putra, is to stand trial soon for involve-
ment in a road crash in which an Army
officer’s son was killed
was unusual outspokenness about army
shortcomings seen as obstacles to res-
toration of civilian prosperity.
“Let us not hesitate to speak frankly
if our intention is good and our aim
honest,” said the Djakarta daily “Ope-
rasi ’ recently. At the same time “Mer-
deka” stated: “One of the most impor-
tant things to do at present is to make
an honest and frank assessment of the
most important component of the New
Order, the Army Forces.”
Two newspapers even endorsed a
U.S. “Wall Street Journal” exposure of
malpractice in the army trading co-
operatives, the big set-up through which
the military engages in commercial
undertakings in competition with pri-
vate enterprise in various regions, and
earns the necessary finance for its
local development projects.
The accusation is that the Army is
taking the lion’s share of the profits
not through business acumen but by
stand-over tactics.
The students’ daily, “Kami,” has
spoken out on the sensitive issue of the
co-operatives, and accused the central
government of paying insufficient at-
tention to the Central Sumatra region,
where much of the trouble centres.
Now' one of the country’s most res-
pected army officers, Brig.-Gen. Sarwo,
idol of the students, and said to have
cleared up one of the most notorious
smuggling centres, is being transferred
to command in North Sumatra.
Acting President Suharto has warned
that the Government will not hesitate
to take firm and drastic measures
against irregularities. So it is wrong
to assume that nothing is being done,
even if critics like the moderate “Sinar
Harapan” are still less than satisfied,
judging by its recent outburst: “Take
harsh steps against the economic sabo-
teurs, who damage national unity and
solidarity. Harsh and decisive! At once!”


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
“A tenor is allowed nothing”
By J. C. KAYE
GIUSEPPE DI STEFANO, the Italian
tenor who gave concerts in Melbourne
on May 23 and 30, and will sing in
Sydney on June 4 and 8, has his own
line of thought on opera, Australian
or otherwise.
“Opera!” he echoes; and shrugs.
“Opera is an anachronism. The old
opera houses of the world are falling to
pieces. La Scala—terrible! There is no
more in Italy an opera director worth
the name. Today it is all business.
Money has pushed out artistry. Here I
see you are building opera houses. That
is a fine spirit. But you are wasting
your money.”
The idea of Australian opera houses
causes him to smile. Where, he asks, is
our tradition?
Di Stefano is 45, with thick Curly
black hair, brown eyes as bright as
crystal, a slightly heavy face and figure,
and a child-like way of looking around
and taking in the passing show as he
sits at a hotel table. He is very relaxed,
very amused.
“It has been easy for me. The voice
is a gift of God. I have made a fortune.
I spend it faster than I make it. I
am a big gambler. I am a bigger
gambler than I am a singer. The casinos
welcome me with smiles. Roulette. No
system. I always lose. I am for speed.
I drive fast. I have a beautiful car, a
Maserati five-litre. It is not dangerous.
I have had only three accidents in my
life. Each time I was going slow.
“I meet fine Australian singers. I
have sung with Collier in ‘Tosca.’
Joan Sutherland I have not sung with,
but I know her. She is a fine woman.
Her voice is a miracle.”
I ventured to ask about Callas. He
replied obliquely. “Once it was good
taste and good singing that made a
singer famous. But now .it is scandal,
notoriety, bad taste.” He pulled a
comic face.
Di Stefano was born in Catania,
Sicily. His father was a violinist. His
mother also was musical. When he
was five the family moved to Milan.
He intended to become a priest, and it
was at a seminary that his singing first
attracted attention. He was an ignorant
lad, as he sees it now. Then he found
out, to use his own expression, that
“you did not buy babies.” The secular
world, he decided, was more for him.
Now he is “not religious,” yet sing-
ing, all the same, has something
mystical in it for him. The “happi-
ness” he gives his listeners he sees as
perhaps a religious thing.
A group of “opera lovers” who had
been impressed by his voice took him
up and sponsored him. He studied with
Montesanto. Then war broke out, with
Italy in the Axis. “I was in the infantry.
I was on my way to Russia. But I got
only halfway there. My captain was
a Neapolitan. He said to me, ‘Your
voice is too valuable. You are more
important alive as a singer than dead
as a soldier.’ So he had me sent back
to Milan. I did not ask for it.”
He has an especially soft spot for
Neapolitans.
He made his debut in 1946 in a tour
of provincial opera houses. Eleven
months later he was in “Manon” at
La Scala. Only two years later he was
invited to the Metropolitan, New York,
for “Rigoletto.”
He makes no claims as an actor. “In
acting, as in everything else, I do
nothing. In opera, to be successful, there
is no need to act. All you need is a
big note. A big note and you are made.
It is simple to be famous.
“I like concerts much better. I deal
directly with the public. For the con-
cert hall a big note is not enough. There
must be diction, musicality, personality,
intimacy. It is much, much more
difficult.”
These days he takes everything in
his stride. Within a single year he has
sung folk music, operettas, concerts, and
grand opera. He moves about almost
continually, and from Australia will go
to Japan, and then on to Expo 67 in
Montreal.
He married an American girl in New
York. They live in Milan and have
three children, a son of 15, who already
has formed an orchestra, and two
younger daughters.
He does not drink or smoke (“A
tenor is allowed to do nothing”). Golf
is his sport, and he belongs to an
exclusive club in Milan. “I can never
play there. I am away. I can only send
what do you say? my cheque,
my dues.”
His ambition is eventually to form
his own company opera company,
that is. It will be small, he says, and
very good.
French with tears
Marie Collier
By JOHN CARGHER
FOR SOMEONE of her international
standing, Australian singer Marie
Collier is very belatedly ad justing to
star status. The three magnificent
dresses designed for her by Australian
Kenneth Rowell for her present visit
to Melbourne prior to her appearance
at Montreal are the first she has had
made to her own order.
There remains some question whether
the dresses and Miss Collier are
not wasted on her present Australian
visit. She admits quite frankly that
Ravel’s “Scheherazade” was not chosen
by her for the tour. She was, in fact,
offered Berlioz’s “Nuits d’Ete” as the
only other choice, and chose, she says,
the lesser of two evils.
French is an unfamiliar language to
her, one of the reasons why she as yet
refuses to tackle Carmen, a role she
has always coveted, and she has sung
“Scheherazade” only once before. She,
and any reasoning entrepreneur would
see this, is apprehensive at having to
sing music made famous to Jennie
Tourel in Tourel’s own hometown,
Montreal.
Her four Melbourne concerts are
handy, therefore, as extended dress
rehearsals, since both the Melbourne
orchestra and the conductor,. Willem
van Otterloo, will accompany her to
Montreal. The incongruity of using Mel-
bourne audiences and critics as guinea-
pigs at Miss Collier’s expense is topped
only by the programming of a French
composer in French Canada for Expo
67’s Australia Day. If we can com-
mission an Australian composition for
an anniversary of the ABC Youth Con-
certs, surely the same could have been
done for a noted interpreter of modern


music representing us on an important
international occasion.
It is an indication of Miss Collier’s
jack of prima donna temperament that
she quietly accepted “Scheherazade”
while feeling strongly that she could
have shone in the music she is rapidly
making her own, not the inevitable
“Tosca,” but operas like “Katerina
Ismailova,” which are becoming
associated with her name. I suspect
that she would have got her way had
she dug her heels in.
The essentially unassuming Marie
Collier probably will never disappear,
but a little of the great diva style she
has so obviously mastered on stage
would not come amiss in furthering
her career. This applies all the more
if, as now, she is asked to help build
her country’s artistic image. I abso-
lutely refuse to believe that she is
undertaking this tour for the money
it may bring.
Miss Collier has just recorded
Chrysothemis to Birgit Nilssen’s Elektra
for Decca and she is haggling (thank
God!) with RCA about the program
of a forthcoming recital disc.
I strongly suspect that her appear-
ances here in years to come will be
limited. However, she will return to
Australia next year to sing in opera
for the Elizabethan Theatre Trust in
company with at least one international
star whose name is bigger than any
the Trust has ever engaged.
Art
Melbourne climate
By ELWYN LYNN
Eric Smith. Rudy Komon, Sydney.
George Johnson. Barry Stern, Sydney.
The Australian Nude (Photographs).
Gallery A, Sydney.
Geoff de Groen and Michael Shaw.
Watters, Sydn.ey.
MOST OF THE ARTISTS this week
play games of ironic commentaries;
George Johnson, a Melburnian whose
forms have been associated with those
of Len French and Len Crawford, fuses
crisp geometry and a science-fiction
surrealism with dead-pan coolness.
Tough cogwheel shapes contrast with
teased hessian where the strands re-
semble legs and antennae; the squared
tooth-forms bite like those in Capo-
grossi, weave to create trenches or en-
circle medallions and geometrical
plans like those of medieval cities.
There is, indeed, a wry and successful
blend of medieval forms, abstract
mosaics, large biological shapes sharp
against wan and dun backgrounds and
science-fictional protuberances that eject
teeth.
In the large mural from Ballarat
Teachers’ College the clouds, stars, and
hard-edged plants are studded with
cogged teeth. Like illustrators of
science-fiction, Johnson obtains a
weirdly chilling atmosphere from his
mechanical precision. The color is pale,
bleached, and lunar, even in the more
engaging works that resemble enamelled
medallions. Johnson’s remote coolness
has chilled me in the past, but in
strength he is more compelling and
one understands the attraction that
the precise forms and sour color of
Johnson, Crawford, and Col Jordan
have for Melburnians. Sydneysiders,
addicted to lush vitalism and plain
statements, may find the coolness and
the irony hard to take, but should
surely appreciate the way Johnson’s
continuous rhythms give a controlled
elan to his coolly disposed forms.
Eric Smith, with engaging verve, is
commenting on his own search for a
style, on other artists and on the art
of this century, in a series of portraits
of Picasso, Rouault, Miro, Pollock,
Chagall, and Bonnard, and less success-
fully of locals like Milgate, Olsen,
James, French, Drysdale, Boyd, Gilli-
land, and Nolan. The locals are prob-
ably not so successful as portraits be-
cause they do not embody as artists
the anxieties of twentieth-century art;
Dr. Coombs, however, in the squared-
up format characteristic of most of
these portraits, looks convincing enough
to be posing for the $lOO blue note.
When the painter’s style joins Smith’s
in the portraits, they are most con-
vincing: a grey, reticent, shadowed
Bonnard; a Fauve Matisse with green
spectacles and scarlet highlights; a
Chagall appearing like a sprite; a Pol-
lock ravaged by action painting;
Rouault an accumulation of brush-
strokes, and Picasso a grey thunder
against red. Nolan, enclosed by Kelly’s
helmets, looks cautious, as though
Smith is timid of satire, but a whimsy
does inform a double portrait of Rudy
Komon, one the flushed bonviveur,
the other a Grey Eminence; suddenly
a hand, outlined with an aura of
creme-de-menthe green, presents a
glass of wine. Where did it come from?
In rediscovering his own art through
portraits of eminent artists and writers
like Joyce and Tielhard de Chardin,
Smith reveals a preoccupation with the
morality of integrity and refined sen-
sibility which can demand an ironic
detachment. He is now less impassioned
than he was, with his early still lifes and
Christs and less forced than he was
with his abstractions and the turbid
action paintings on Voss. Having
worked through Larry Rivers’ rococo
Pop, he has discovered a new ease and
makes a beguiling and dashing style
from the stylisations of others there
are some remarkably daring syntheses.
The three photographers controvert
the notion - espoused in the earlier
works of Whiteley, Paramor, Redding-
ton, and Hughes that boulders,
breasts, and buttocks, sloping hills and
sliding thighs are equivalents by pos-
ing nudes in tough grass and on pitted
rocks. It is clear which is which. They
are polemicists as much as photog-
raphers: Wesley Stacey (“I found it
hard to contemplate the nude without
associating it with sin”) tosses a nude
above suburban houses and more
effectively above some stark gums, like
Nolan’s Leda, levitated and far from
home; David Stiven (“I wanted to
photograph the nude in its natural
landscape which should be its comple-
ment”) has a nude crouched in the
corny mists of Dawn’s Early Light,
and Garry Shead (“Is this country still
too afraid to look at a woman’s
body?”) has a photo montage of soft
curves and mirage-like horsemen, a
nostalgic dream opposed to Playboy
meat (he says) and Victorian revulsion
of the flesh.
Of course, Victorians liked pulpy
flesh and some of the nudes here are
right from the academic salons; and
if photography is about the immobi-
lising of thin slices of time and the
decisive moment, one could wonder
where the monumental nude fits in.
However, having seen the Great Ameri-
can Nude by Wesselmann so often ac-
companied by plastic flowers and
fridges, it’s pleasant to see the Austra-
lian equivalent go bush.
Michael Taylor at Watters offers
some compressed, Pop vignettes most
telling balanced; and his co-exhibitor,
Geoff de Groen, in Soaking and Des-
cending, a black, crisply fragile apple-
shape on white, presented with an im-
peccable severity that is sleek and lively,
makes an ironical comment on the
minimal mystique: that the reduction
to basic form doesn’t imply a trophy
of the emotions.
Films
Bleak view
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Hombre. Director, Martin Ritt.
MARTIN RITT’S bleak view of human
nature, so clearly stated in “The Spy
Who Came In From The Cold,” is
again in evidence in “Hombre,” a sub-
dued Western, whose careful avoidance
of melodrama sometimes takes it to
the point of lacking genuine drama.
But it is always an interesting film,
though it falls short of the high dramatic
peak; its slow, almost dreamy develop-
ment has a certain hypnotic charm,
and if it is rather more talkative than
Westerns are expected to be, the talk
is articulate yet plausible in character,
sometimes lightened by an astringent
humor (as in the discussion of men
and marriage by the three women).
Paul Newman plays a white man,
part of whose childhood has been spent
among Apache Indians who, at the
time (the end of last century), are
in the process of being painlessly
exterminated, either by being charitably
herded into reservations, which deprive
them of dignity and identity, or being
forced to eke out an existence in


inhospitable wilderness. Forced by
circumstances into assuming his “white”
identity for a time, the man finds his
sympathies drawing him closer to the
Indians. This is q situation that can
only end badly, and though Ritt’s film
lacks true tragic inevitability, it has a
sort of rueful, elegiac sadness that is
oddly appealing.
In the early sequences, Paul Newman
is stoic and monosyllabic to the point
of hardly registering. It seems that the
director will allow him to do nothing
to establish the character beyond
allowing his impressive profile to etch
itself against the parched landscape
(beautifully photographed in sun-
bleached color). Later, he is allowed
to indulge in some pretty sharp back-
chat as well as violent action, but he
never quite reaches the tragic stature
no doubt intended.
An uncommonly attractive perform-
ance by Diane Cilento, earthy and
humorous, makes a stronger impression.
In fact, the whole cast is very satis-
factory; and it is a relief to see in
Richard Boone a villain whose actions
have no neo-Freudian explanations
involving neglectful mothers or brutal
fathers: he . behaves that way for the
simple, sound reason that he’s a
thoroughly bad egg.
Theatre
French treat
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
“ Antigone.” Jean Anouilh. “Les Femmes
Savantes.” Moliere. Le Treteau de
Paris. Conservatorium, Sydney.
WHAT IS it about these two French
productions that raises them to a level
of excellence which our local theatre
rarely, if ever, attains? First, there is
the skill of the acting, nurtured by a
great tradition, firmly disciplined yet
infinitely flexible. Then there is the
fact that .time and money have been
spent on perfecting the artistry of these
productions. They have not been whip-
ped up in a few weeks to run for a few
weeks and then give way to some
equally hastily improvised piece. We
cannot expect to begin to attain such
excellence until we have a National
Theatre, or, perhaps better still, State
Theatres, with permanent companies
which are subsidised so that they may
devote themselves to the presentation
of the best in drama by means of the
combined arts of the theatre.
The best word to describe the pro-
ductions of this company is style. It
is something that is instantly recog-
nised when seen, but hard to describe.
Some of the things it certainly includes
Marie Ange Roux, Gerard Paquis, and
Catherine Broe in Moliere’s “Les
Femmes Savantes.” Le Treteau de
Paris, appearing in Sydney and Mel-
bourne
are good taste, meticulous attention to
detail, and a complete subordination of
every gesture, sound, and movement to
the shape and theme of the play.
Both plays are presented in modern
dress. This is not very important in the
case of Anouilh’s “Antigone.” Anti-
gone’s pale faced, black-gowned inten-
sity, as played by Catherine de Seynes,
would dominate any fashion. Likewise
Jean Davy’s powerful Creon, an
immense bulk of a man, could no
doubt suggest solid bourgeois attitudes,
no matter what he was wearing. How-
ever, the belted plastic raincoats of the
three guards, who fill in time playing
cards or discussing “le cadavre” in a
businesslike manner, do give the pro-
duction an unmistakably contemporary
feeling.
In Guy Parigot’s brilliant production
of “Les Femmes Savantes,” every de-
tail of the play has been transposed into
modern idiom. Claude Bresson’s set-
ting is at once pleasant to look at and
a source of constant hilarity as the
eye moves from the uncompromising
abstract sculpture at the entrance to
the living-room, carefully placed to
assault the arriving guest, to the “op”
eye staring down from a shelf and the
upturned bicycle which forms a grace-
ful junk sculpture floating high above
the bookshelves loaded with heavy
tomes.
Blonde, plump, trousered, cigarette
between her lips, Jeanette Granval’s
Philaminte appreciates literature, sacks
the maid for bad grammar, or cows her
husband with the same implacably
businesslike air. Meanwhile her arty
sister-in-law, imagining all the young
men to be in love with her, flutters
about with little cries, dressed in a
series of violently colored ensembles,
each more ludicrous than the one be-
fore. Chrysale, the hen-pecked husband,
is no match for the calculating Tris-
sotin, Philaminte’s seemingly tame poet,
who is played with a true clown’s in-
finite variety of comic expression by
Michel Garland. His sometime friend
Vadius, aggressively unwashed and un-
shaven and attired in the regulation
crushed corduroy and dirty sweater, is
a wonderful foil to the nervous,
scrubbed, social-climbing Trissotin.
Even without following the dialogue it
is impossible not to be convulsed
throughout the performance.
Close to home
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Life is for Living. Brian Faull.
Emerald Hill, Melbourne.
IF A LOCAL critic gets indignant
about Fellini, I can’t see Frederico
gnashing his teeth in Naples. The TV
critic is doomed to comment retro-
spectively on the ephemeral, and art
criticism the lucid Mr. Lynn’s
excepted is invariably unintelligible.
But the theatre critic enjoys no com-
forting degree of detachment. He works
close to home, and what he says might,
just might, affect the employment of
actors whose only sin was to fall into
the hands of a bad playwright or worse
producer. This week responsibility
weighs heavier than usual, because the
future of Emerald Hill itself probably
depends on the success or otherwise of
this production. Since Wal Cherry was
elevated to professorhood, it has been
touch and go at Dorcas Street. Now a
new company, the Melbourne Inde-
pendent Theatre, is making an eleventh-
hour bid to save it, and if “Life is for
Living” fails to attract an audience
they’ll find it hard to attract the neces-
sary financial backing.
But like the other gentleman who
chopped down a Cherry, I cannot tell
a lie. The play is nonsense, and unlike
the nonsenses of Becket, Lewis Carroll,
and Spike Milligan, from which,
among others, it borrows, it is not
inspired.
The plot, such as it is, concerns a
head-clutching young poet whose sui-
cide plans are jeopardised when he has
a lapse of memory as to his motives.
An obliging girl undertakes to help him
remember, and takes him home to meet
her parents. Her father keeps crawling
around the stage in search of his emu,
while Mother repeatedly cuts off phone
calls with a pair of garden shears. While
the poet indulges in repeated bursts
of breast-beating, the family throw a
lacklustre party, two policemen waltz
together, and the rest of the cast
wander off on a treasure-hunt from
which, mercifully, they fail to return.
Ultimately and predictably, the poet
finds that life can be beautiful and opts
for continued existence.

“That’s too bad it’s

undergrad artiness pervades the dia-
logue. Burt Cooper makes matters
worse by handling the proceedings as

evidence he is no playwright.
Music
Faded beauty
By JOHN CARGHER
Giuseppe di Stefano. Town Hall, Mel-
bourne.
THERE ARE MANY kinds of tenors:
dramatic, lyric, buffo, spinto, and so
on. We can now add a new category:
the pianoforte tenor. Giuseppe di
Stefano today is just that; he sings
piano and forte, nothing else. At
the moment there remains a great
deal of beauty in his singing which
can and does give genuine pleasure to
the listener. But the absence of any
grading between loud and soft is
musically distressing, particularly since
his piano is almost inaudible. In some
respects this is a blessing in disguise,
for, while the voice still rings bril-
liantly, it cracks faintly but distinctly
and regularly during t h e quieter
passages.
Not so very long ago di Stefano
was unequivocally accepted as the best
tenor in the world, and rightly so.
At his best he had few equals among
singers of any period. Today he is
45 years old, the very prime for a
good tenor. His appearance here
should have been one of the year’s
great musical events. Unhappily, it
is only a minor occasion.
Di Stefano is a likable person with
a pleasant and modest platform manner
and ne chooses his repertoire well to
suit the present state of his voice.
The early part of the program, rang-
ing from Bellini songs to “O Souverain"
from Massenet’s “El Cid,” was music-
ally the best and consequently failed
to arouse any enthusiasm among the
audience. This left the unfortunate
soloist with a moment he will long
remember: A final number without a
single call for the prepared encores.
One must admire the aplomb with
which di Stefano returned to the
stage and blandly announced that the
program said “Interval” but that he
would instead sing some Tosti songs.
These proved to be what the audience
was waiting for and the belatedly pro-
grammed encores were encored.
It must be apparent to di Stefano that
his valiant attempts to retain artistic
status by sensible programming is a
waste of time. It is not perhaps too
late to retire for a year or two in
the hope that his still beautiful voice
will recover some of its past glories.
If he persists in this kind of con-
certising, he might just as well forget
Bellini and Berlioz in favor of Tosti
and Denza.
Change places
By DAVID SALTER
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Conduc-
tor, Dean Dixon; soloist, Helen
Watts.
IT IS INTERESTING to see Dean
Dixon experimenting with a new seat-
ing arrangement for the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra. The current sub-
scription series program - Brahms’ “St.
Anthony Variations,” a Bach solo can-
tata, and the Tchaikovsky E minor
Fifth Symphony calls on no per-
cussion players except the tympanist;
this allowed him to move the horns
further toward and above the violins.
This left us with a simple, triangular
organisation: tympani as the apex,
woodwind grouped directly below', and
the remaining players in their normal
positions.
For those whose ears have become
practised in adjusting to the Towm
Hall’s acoustics, these alterations made
the horns sound as if they w'ere coming
front an area well to their right
almost from the A.B.C.’s recording
booth beneath the southern gallery.
Woodwind texture was a little thinner
than usual, coming from a cleared,
less muffling origin. These fresh tonal
shadings proved so intriguing in the
splendid orchestration of the Brahms
Variations that at times I succeeded
in distracting myself from the per-
formance.
There was not a single distractiye
element in the performance w'hich
followed. Welsh contralto Helen Watts
sang her way through Bach’s “Wieder-
stehe doch der Sunde” Cantata (No.
54) w'ith that stiff disregard for
dramatic sense guaranteed to reduce a
work of sublime beauty to a flat and
plodding level.
Although not quite at tempo di van
Otterloo, Dixon’s account of the Tchai-
kovsky Fifth is recognisably speedier
than most. The Allegro vivace of the
finale, alternately violent and grandiose,
is real Dixon fare and the orchestra
responded with some thoroughly im-
pressive playing. An unfortunate
exposed fluff in the second movement
horn solo was the only notable blemish
on this consistently stirring perfor-
mance.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A parlous and poor dairy industry
THE PRESENT piteous state of the dairying industry is
fully revealed in a survey published by the Bureau of Agri-
cultural Economics in Canberra last week. Despite huge sub-
sidies, the industry is in a state of terrible poverty, or sections
of it at least are. Average net farm income is low enough,
at $2400 a year. This is to be compared with average
weekly earnings of wage and salary earners of $3OOO. The
dairyfarmer has to work 365 days a year for his money and
makes full use of captive wifely and child labor.
The general poverty of the industry is not so disturbing
as the poverty of particular parts. The Queensland dairy
industry has average incomes of $1154, well below the basic
wage, and N.S.W. North Coast farmers are worse still with
$1026. But averages do not tell the whole story. Through-
out Australia, 14 percent of dairy farms have no net income
at all and appear to be surviving simply by letting their
equipment and properties run down or going deeper into
debt. Negative farm incomes are the rule for an estimated
31 percent of N.S.W. North Coast farmers, 16 percent of
Queensland’s dairymen, and 30 percent of Western Austra-
lians. Everything is wrong with the North Coast and Queens-
land industries—acreages are too small, herd numbers too
small, fertiliser application too little, climate unsuitable.
It is worth recalling the scheme put forward in the last
session of Parliament by Dr. Rex Paterson for the rehabili-
tation of the industry. On the basis of 80001 b. butterfat pro-
duction being the minimum needed for financial viability,
he estimates 8500 dairy farmers need help. Five thousand
of these could be helped to raise their production to paying
levels, under a scheme which would cost slBm. (sBm. would
be spent in Queensland, ssm. in N.S.W., s3m. in W.A.).
Three thousand farms are simply not helpable and will have
to be converted to other uses. A scheme of assistance to
displaced farmers would require sl7m.
Dr. Paterson’s estimates may be too low; there may indeed
be a case for more generous compensation than his scheme
allows. But it would be better for the nation to be able to
look forward to an end to the s27m. subsidy required
annually at the cost of $35m., or even s4sm. or sssm.
It would also be better for the farmers involved.
MEN AND MATTERS
FOR PERSISTENT oil search
endeavor, as well as for dedication to
the cause of local ownership of our
natural resources, few men of the
moment on the glittering Australian
minerals scene can hold a candle to
60-year-old Eric Nugent Avery, head
of Australian Associated Oilfields.
AAO’s recent success in Queensland,
after so many tries, in topping a 1000
bls/day oil flow, the best mainland
result since Moonie, attests Avery’s
long-staying search hormones as surely
as his prevention of a big foreign intru-
sion into his group’s equity does his
preference for having Australian share-
holders.
His obsession for keeping AAO pure
might seem strange considering Avery
was born in England, went to Cam-
bridge (law), and on a scholarship
(economics) to Princeton (U.S.) before
coming into the oil game with Shell.
The fact is he caught the Australian
bug at Shell and it has been on him
ever since. After nine years with Shell
in China, he was sent here to rule its
Australian roost. Fie did this from the
age of 39 for ten years, and in the
process established the first one-brand
service station here as well as our first
modern oil refinery.
When Avery’s Australian tour was
up he returned to England, then
promptly asked to be sent back. Shell
refused, so he left the company and
Sir lan Potter invited him to take a
stall in his rapidly expanding stable
in Melbourne. He’s been there ever
since, not so busy
perhaps as a direc-
tor of Australian
United Develop-
ment, one of
ADC’s private
companies, but
more roaming at
large along hi s
own chosen oil
and other (Ring
Grip, for instance)
company lines.
Mr. Avery is
really too strong
an Englishman to be anything else,
but he is more Australianised than
most, as one might expect —if only
because his wife and three children
are all true-blue natives of his adopted
country and because he likes the local
golf courses so much.
TWICE A WEEK, Mr. A. G. East-
wood, the managing director of Pres-
tige Ltd. (the lingerie and. hosiery group
in which the Holeproof tail now wags
the dog), takes a group of his top
men and has a work-out in the smart
gymnasium for an hour or so. That
may explain why Prestige last week
reported a healthy upturn in profits.
Mr. Eastwood, a 55-year-old former
Holeproof man, has always been a
sportsman, even insisting on being a
rower with Mercantile Club in Mel-
bourne.
A Melbourne Grammar man who
joined the State Savings Bank, did

accountancy and then a commerce de
gree (which he completed after six
years of army service), he got into the
textile business by accident; Henry B.
Smith, the wool people, wanted a com-
pany secretary and he joined them for
a few months before moving across to
Holeproof later in 1946 as assistant
secretary. He had worked his way
up to joint managing director and then
sole chief executive in Holeproof dur-
ing its dismal period as a subsidiary of
Mr. Stanley Korman’s Factors group
(before Prestige acquired it from the
Factors receiver).
After that spell, nothing seems able
to ruffle Mr. Eastwood; not even hav-
ing the founder of one of the com-
panies he runs (Mr. A. G. Staley, of
Holeproof) watching his every move as
its chairman still, and the Foletta family
keeping a watch over his handling of
their father’s creation from the Pres-
tige board room.


Not so Golden Mile
WHILE A RISE in the price of gold is the only real cure
for problems on the Golden Mile, the optimism bred at
Kambalda and the proposed rationalisation of activities
by some of the big operators have combined to eliminate
talk of the inevitable death of the Western Australian gold-
mining industry. Lake View and Star Ltd. and Great
Boulder Gold Mines Ltd. are discussing a merger; Great
Boulder and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aust.) Ltd. have
joined forces to operate the western deep leases adjoining
the Golden Mile.
Although Great Boulder, oldest mine on the Golden
Mile, received the maximum Federal subsidy of $8 per
ounce, it still made a loss last year.
In fact, of the six major Western Australian mines,
only Central Norseman Gold Corporation manages, with
its high-grade ore, to get by without the subsidy; repre-
sentatives of the industry met the Treasurer, Mr. McMahon,
in Sydney last week to seek a higher level for this subsidy.
This, as necessary as it might be to keep the industry
going, can, at best, only push the real problems into the
background. And the real problem (apart from the below-
production-cost value placed on gold) is labor, according
to Mr. Brian J. Boylson, an economics tutor at the University
of W.A., who is completing a master’s thesis on the industry.
Writing in the latest issue of “Economic Activity,” he
points out that Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie is one of the few
companies that has not had to reduce output substantially
because of labor shortages. Last year, he says, Lake View
and Star whose management has been “unceasing in its
attempts to increase its workforce in pursuit of the target
tonnage of 920,000 tons” had a labor turnover of 140
percent. Newcomers’ average stay was only seven shifts. The
company brought out 225 British families and only 92
stayed in Kalgoorlie, despite lures of such perks as 20-year
guarantees on interest-free housing loans.
A year of sobriety
PERHAPS THE MOST potent reason why the economy
is moving up to the end of the financial year more soberly
than seems warranted by resources availability is the con-
tinued decline in fixed capital investment, which in the
March quarter was lower than any quarter since March two
years ago. For all industries the total for the last quarter
was $358m., which compares with $388.7m. and s3oBm.
in the two previous March quarters. Most of the fall over
the year was, as might be expected, in manufacturing, which
is still loaded with a good deal of unused capacity and
waiting for the better trend in overseas sales to be translated
into more orders for industry. This sector in fact accounted
for the whole of the fall between the two latest March
quarters, the most notable weakness being in the lagging
motor industry, chemicals (still poised for a boost from the
new tariff arrangements), and textiles. In fact, the overall
total for the March quarter has only been saved from a
sharper drop by the good performance of the non-manufac-
turing sector, where fixed investment has been very steady
but perhaps not as buoyant as one might expect in mining
and surprisingly good in transport.
Even though March is a dull quarter (for seasonal reasons)
for investment in new buildings, the latest showed a small
improvement in this respect but, as might be expected by
the big drop overall in industrial fixed investment, it was
not nearly enough to offset the decline in investment in
new plant and equipment. Going on last week’s promising
figures for private building approvals for the first four
months this year, which will now be increasingly reflected
in building operations, income generation from this side
should help the economy generally from now on. If
that isn’t what we were mainly hoping for, an about-turn
in investment in plant and equipment; at least it may por-
tend a stiffening of investment in the latter direction. How-
ever, things would be more encouraging in that direction
if the increase in approvals was concentrated more on fac-
tories (up 29 percent) than on shops (up 105.7 percent)
and other business premises (up 42.1 percent).
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Heavy industry once again
asserts its soundness in the latest (quarter ended April'
production statistics; motor vehicles also continue to
improve. The drab spots are mostly among consumer
durables and building materials.
Private building approvals ran about 15 percent
higher than last year’s corresponding levels over the four
months to April; for Government buildings the gain is
better than 30 percent. Flats are significantly ahead
of house approvals.
The Federal Government is offering a SU.S.2Sm.
loan in Europe, its term 15 years.
For the markets: The vivid debut of Hamersley
and the renewed nickel impetus for some other miners
could only show up the drooping industrials on Aus-
tralian share markets.
London managed a fairly well diffused advance on
the Friday . . . Wall Street seemed more nervous about
the Middle East, and the economy.
FOr companies : The miners are still bent upon
remoulding the economy . . . Apparently not content
to let Hamersley float in sole glory, the Anaconda Aus-
tralia-Conzinc Riotinto-New Broken Hill partnership
just had to announce more nickel on the south-western
side of Lake Lefroy (W.A.); on the strength of one drill
hole the share markets went temporarily mad, although
Anaconda observes that much more work has to "be
done ... A day or two before this revelation, that
old nickel veteran Western Mining reported another
discovery 12 miles from Kambalda, also, of course, in
the Lake Lefroy territory.
Wapet’s Pasco No. 1 well gave a second oil flow
(more than 1000 barrels a day) at a lower level; Pasco
No. 2 is soon to spud in.
Along more orthodox paths, beach miner Western
Titanium anticipates bigger profits for 1967-68; the
half-yearly dividend is moved from 5 to 7 cents a share
(14 percent) . . . Sulphide Corporation’s 1966 profit
eased from $1,872,980 to $1,822,105 on lower lead-zinc
sales forced by smelter overhaul.
Takeovers tried hard not to take second place . . .
Struggling confectioner Macßobertson (Australia) is ap-
proached by Mars Inc., second largest in America, with
a cash bid valued at some $7.9m. —for ordinaries, $1.75
for each $1 share which Mars does not intend to in-
crease . . . Associated British Maltsters will buy (at a
premium) a 26 percent holding in Melbourne’s Smith
Mitchell and may eventually, under option, obtain a
controlling interest.
Cigarettes took a glow from Philip Morris (Australia),
which proposes a one-for-two bonus after a share split
and predicts 11 percent dividends (equivalent to 16|
percent against the current 12 percent) . . . Godfrey
Phillips is paying a 17£ percent (previously 12 percent)
to its English parent on earnings up by 12 percent.
Motors don’t have it so good . . . Chrysler Australia
struck difficulties integrating Rootes, so 1966 profits
dropped 15.4 percent to $3,488,419; earnings are, as
usual, ploughed back . . . On the “juice” side, Ampol
Petroleum earned 18 percent more, at $2,657,292, in its
first half and is able to keep the 10 percent rate on
higher capital; the current half-year is moving better.
From a $355,468 loss to a $256,838 profit was also
Fairymead Sugar’s experience, the dividend staying at
6 percent.
Lingerie and hosiery maker Prestige’s profit added 12
percent to reach $1,057,984 (earning rate 24.3 percent),
not hindering the well-covered 12£ percent dividend.
Steamships Trading is cutting the dividend rate from
13.4 to 10 percent, expecting a profit decline, and will
also make a 2-for-5 issue . . . Concrete Industries will
resume dividends with one cent a 50-cent share.

No picnics in Canberra
Productivity down to earth
By CROESUS
SORRY, YOU productivity group
people, national picnics for you in Can-
berra are out. You will just have to
continue sweating it out “on the
beaches, in the factories . . as you-
know-who once said. The fact is that
Mr. Bury thinks you are doing so well
in your rolled-up shirtsleeves on your
present hard yakka regimen, that a
“high-falutin’ ” national council might
put ideas into your heads.
Of course, taking a worms-eye-view.
Mr. Bury is right. Even if they help to
keep the airlines and the Carlton-Rex
in business, there are probably too many
picnics by high-falutin’ national bodies
to Canberra. But his recent statement
in the House on the subject,, in answer
to a question by Mr. A. Gibson, is also
puzzling. My subsequent pursuit of the
truth about; productivity urgers, and
their organisation in Australia, has led
Sir Walter Scott do-gooder
me far afield without convincing me
that the Minister didn’t simply get up
from the wrong side of the bed the
morning he made it.
It should be said at once, though,
that Bury put his emphasis about efforts
to increase productivity where it rightly
belongs and where the people involved
in those efforts would prefer it to be.
As he stressed, although the productivity
program is sponsored by his depart-
ment, it has succeeded largely because
“it operates at the ground level, a lot
of people are enthusiastic, and the firms
concerned pay for it themselves.” But
maybe I’m going too fast because, in
the absence of any wide publicity, apart
from an occasional public plug like
Lord Casey gave them when opening
Parliament in February, the productivity
people and their national recognition
aspirations may not be all that well
known to readers.
Having sat through a session or two
of the recent Congress on Human Rela-
tions in Melbourne and also delivered
a paper to it, Mr. Bury can be excused
for being a bit aggravated by any
proposal to put the essentially earthy
productivity groups on to a pedestal
where the sociological aspects of auto-
mation and technological change tend
to get priority over the more prosiac
industrial ones.
On the other hand, in rejecting Mr.
Gibson’s suggestion to have a national
productivity council, Mr. Bury seems
to have been equivocating, because there
is already in existence an Australian
Productivity Council and also a Pro-
ductivity Groups National Committee.
What is more, the association of these
two is so close that since last November
they’ve shared the same chairman, the
managing-director of Personnel Admin-
istration, Mr. J. S. Smith. I strongly sus-
pect that, in asking his question of Mr.
Bury, Mr. Gibson was strongly in Mr.
Smith’s shadow, because up to this the
Australian Productivity Council has been
a sort of voluntary association of do-
gooders in the productivity field
mainly Mr. Smith, Sir Walter Scott,
and Messrs B. W. Ruffles, and Arch
White and has failed to get official
recognition.
If there’s no doubt that Mr. Smith is
the leading private sector light both on
and off the field (a sort of Ron
Barassi) in the national drive for in-
creased productivity, it is equally clear
that Mr. Bury doesn’t want him to
steal the limelight of the productivity
groups, who are really the Ministry of
Labor’s own darlings. They had their
origin in 1957, when Mr. Holt had
the Labor portfolio, in the department’s
Labor Advisory Council, where employ-
ers and trade unions sat beside its
officers. Although they use some
adopted overseas techniques, they’re
really a unique Australian phenomenon
based on the sharing and adaptation
of practical ideas within an autonomous
group context. Ministry of Labor
officials give guidance, and all sorts of
national firms and bodies, such as
industrial consultants and cost account-
ants, weigh in with advice when
required, in a sense, as Mr. McMahon
put it when he was Minister, the groups
are marshalling the managerial know-
how of the community.
At present there are 172 individual
groups and, to show how the idea is
continuing to catch on in industry, last
year more than 700 new firms came
into the groups and 50 new groups were
started. At the beginning of May this
year there were nearly 2800 participa-
ting firms. This represents a drive for
productivity in great depth in Aus-
tralian industry. If some of the savings

Australia’s competing banks provide a range of banking

ment in Australia, but provide a stimulus wherever people
with initiative demonstrate that they have a contribution
to make to Australia’s progress.
Australia’s prosperity is the result of the enterprise of
people and their banks.

in cost thrown up look pretty small
cheese, there have been some big ones
also, and when added up really amount
to something, as Mr. Bury proudly told
Parliament. What is more, manufactur-
ing hasn’t been the only beneficiary.
Tertiary industry and also public sector
services are in the productivity group
swim, too, and women as well as men
are participating.
The following are some fairly typical
cost savings resulting from productivity-
group activities. By co-ordinating the
work of its engineering and purchasing
departments, a Melbourne company is
saving $20,000 per annum in purchasing-
costs. A national insurance group has
cut its stationary costs by $30,000 a
year, with more in sight. By modifying
sawing techniques, Tasmanian saw-
millers have increased the number of
wide boards cut from a log by six
percent. For the expenditure of $l6OO
on improved layout of its baling,
storage, and dispatch sections, a Bris-
bane tannery is saving $3OOO a year,
and changes in plant layout and
improved materials handling have cut
another Brisbane tannery’s costs by an
annual $40,000. The Royal North Shore
Hospital, in Sydney, has reduced its
linen handling costs by $5OOO a year by-
installing a powered prime-mover with
detachable wagons in place of panel
vans.
The national themesong of the pro-
ductivity groups this year is “Go for
material gains in 1967.” The emphasis
is being placed on cutting out waste in
materials usage in all its phases, this
being recognised as a clear-cut route
toward increased industrial efficiency
and lower costs because materials costs
are rarely less than a third of selling
prices whatever the item of manufac-
ture. For many products they reach 60
percent, and in some instances they’re
up to 75 percent of selling prices.
Last year, with assistance from the
Department of Labor, the national
committee organised a methods
improvement project which, it is esti-
mated, resulted in more than an initial
slm. in cost savings to the firms taking-
part. The ultimate savings are expected
to be many more times that figure.
About a thousand “groupers,” mostly
from a diverse range of industries, but
also 119 from public sector activities
(power, water, transport, hospitals, etc.),
from all five States, attended three-day
appreciation courses (85 all told) and
there was also a solid participation by
management.
Indeed, the number of relatively
senior executives representing individual
undertakings in group activity is one of
the most encouraging features. Such
people are on their way up to top
management positions, where eventually
they will have a big influence on
efficiency at the operational level in
their firms and, after all, national pro-
ductivity gains are no more and no
less than the sum of those in individual
establishments.

You need more than a driver's licence
to be a Remington technician
No joke. It needs three years training and regular re-
fresher courses. Only then is a Remington technician
allowed even near a customer's machines.
Pretty solid, you might say. But it pays off. The Reming-
ton trainee school turns out the most highly trained team
of office equipment experts in the country.
One particular thing Remington men learn is that a
client hates to be kept waiting in an emergency. That's
why they've built a reputation for being the fastest
qualified experts of this type, on the scene anywhere.
And we mean anywhere ! Remington's service team
has offices in 94 cities and towns throughout Australia.
When you've got more machines throughout the country
than anyone, you need the largest team to service them!
A Remington technician certainly goes through a lot
before he's sent out on the road. But it means that
Remington's clients can forget about service worries.-

MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By PELIAS in Melbourne
MINING ISSUES aside, the most
interesting stock in the market at
present is Macßobertson. Earlier this
year these columns predicted a bid
(The Bulletin, Feb. 18, p. 48) and
there are several potential suitors apart
from Mars. According to David Brown,
the man from Mars, there are probably
four other groups who would be inter-
ested in taking Macßobertson over.
He is obviously worried that a takeover
battle could develop for the company;
hence the emphasis he laid on the fact
that Mars would not increase its bid
under any circumstances. As long as
the market continues to price the shares
above the Mars bid, they must remain
worthy of a gamble for those who have
the courage.
Nabisco still seems the most likely
group to make a counter offer. It has
the capital resources and, as the
February article pointed out, Mac-
Robertson would fit rather neatly into
Nabisco’s Australian set-up. It is also
interesting to note that such a move
would not be foreign to Nabisco just
recently, it acquired a chocolate group
in West Germany. In this industry, a
non-Australian group stands much more
chance of succeeding with a bid than
in biscuits, and this is an additional
attraction.
There are few Australian food or
confectionery groups who either want
or could afford Macßobertson in its
present difficult financial state. Also,
part of the reason for the Australian
Biscuit Company’s opposition to Nabisco
over Swallow was to protect its own
market; in the current case this would
not be such a vital issue, as one of the
main reasons for Nabisco stepping in
would be to merge chocolate produc-
tion with its biscuit activities, not to
cut a swathe through the chocolate and
confectionery market. Mars’ objectives
are, of course, quite different, and the
threat of someone so dynamic on the
local scene may well entice overseas-
controlled groups like Cadbury or
Nestle into the picture,
Mr. Brown’s attempts to emphasise
that Mars would not get involved in
a battle also indicate that he thinks
Nabisco or someone else could come
on to the scene. One of Nabisco’s more
cunning tactics when it feels it cannot
succeed with a bid is to keep making
counter offers so that the price its
opposition is eventually forced to pay
is both crippling and exorbitant,
These tactics were a definite element
in the latter stages of the Swallow’s
battle. They could be applied in Mac-
Robertson’s case, too. Because the
family controls something like 35 per-
cent of the capital, any successful suitor
will probably need its approval, and
the affiliation Mars already has with
Macßobertson (Mars Bars, etc.) puts
the odds well on its side.
Yet, if the family intends to sell out,
it presumably would do so at the top
price, so the field is wide open at the
moment. The fact that directors did
not immediately recommend or reject
the offer indicates they may be waiting
for a counter bid. Mars directors have
dealt with the Macßobertson board
before, so there is little doubt that
Macßobertson’s attitude has already
been determined. (One of this column’s
spies has filed information to the effect
that Mars executives have toured the
Macßobertson factory dressed up in
white coats, as chemists or something.)
Although this may suggest that Mars
is already home, those willing to gamble
on a counter bid should not be dis-
heartened. Macßobertson shares were
fetching $2.50 a couple of years ago,
and there should be plenty of share-
holders looking for a higher bid to
get their money back. Mars is prepared
to take only 65 percent of the capital
and leave the family as an outside
shareholder, so any counter-bidding
group should be prepared to do the
same. So the chances of a higher bid
are strong; at $l.BO the shares should
be bought because, at worst, it would
appear that one will get $1.75 from
Mars. At best, there are endless pos-
sibilities.
THE CHANCES of another takeover
bid, this time for Fleetways (examined
in this column on April 22, page 51),
have been strengthened by the latest
circular from lan Potter & Co. The
broking house appears to have gone as
far as it dares in suggesting that the
company may be taken over, without
actually committing itself to saying so
directly. The item commences by point-
ing out that takeovers to further ration-
alise the transport industry are once
again the feature of the stock market,
giving Fleetways’ bid for Luya, Julius
as the current example. It says the com-
pany will be no stranger to containerisa-
tion when the full impact of overseas
plans hits Australia. This dovetails
rather nicely with this column’s April
suggestion that a bid could come from
an overseas shipping company which is
strong on containerisation.
The Potter circular takes the merger
with Luya, Julius as an indication of
the group’s future role as a strong con-
tender for the big volume of con-
tainerised business likely to be avail-
able from the feeder services operating
from the main overseas container
terminals. It points out that shipping
agents with strong overseas connections
are major shareholders. (A similar
statement can be made of the com-
pany’s founder.) To make the inference
clearer, the circular says the group’s
shipping construction and repair ser-
vices give it an added slant toward
The Chartist says:
THE CHART ON AAO (fully paid) shares indicates the same enormous poten-
tial rewards for investors in the Associated Group. Charts on Associated Freney
(ctg.) and Papuan Apinaipi were published earlier this year and some targets
have already been achieved. An upward trend was followed until 1963 by AAO,
and a downtrend eventually took prices to a low of 45c last year. The sharp
rise from 55c to $1.05 last week, on greatly increased volume, penetrated the
long-term downtrend. A normal reaction to 70c has since followed and the
base consolidation suggests a rise to $1.70 eventually. Last sale price on

NEW ZEALAND
DIRECTOR
& COMPANY, AUCKLAND
PROFESSIONAL THEATRE
The Auckland Theatre Trust Board,
sponsored by the Queen Elizabeth II Arts
Counoil wishes to appoint a full-time
director for a professional company to
be formed in Auckland, New Zealand’s
largest city.
Auckland, with a population of over
half a million, has at present no pro-
fessional drama and the Board has been
formed to initiate and manage such a
venture. A fully equipped theatre will
be provided.
The post offers unrivalled creative op-
portunities. The director will be respon-
sible for the theatre and company in
artistic aspects, including choice of plays
and casts and like matters, and for the
general policy of a full-time training
school to be attached to the theatre.
Fares to New Zealand will be paid and
applications are invited from experienced
persons having the drive and ability to
earn a salary in the vicinity of £N.Z.
2000 p.a., terms of service generally will
be negotiated and the director will be
required to take up his position later in
1967 for a proposed opening in March,
1968.
Applications, together with full parti-
culars of previous experience and other
relevant information, should be for-
warded by air-mail to arrive within three
weeks of this advertisement.
Applications are also invited from
actors, actresses, designers, and techni-
cians in joining the company. These
will be considered by the director upon
his appointment.

marine transport, in which it is likely
to become more deeply involved.
To cap everything, its last paragraph
suggests that while the shares are at
75 cents and yielding six percent, they
give an attractive opportunity to invest
in the transport industry “at this inter-
esting period of its development.” One
finds this argument rather weak unless
it includes an inference of takeover.
There are transport companies yielding
better than Fleetways and several who
have better growth prospects. Some
were listed in Potter’s earlier circular
on containerisation in general and its
likely effect on the Australian transport
industry. One can’t help feel that
Potter’s are expecting a bid for Fleet-
ways some time this year.
Behind the balance sheets
Kathleen Investments climbing
IT IS NO wonder the gloss has gone
off Kathleen Investments (Australia)
Ltd. Just when another uranium boom
looked like hitting the stock and the
shares got up over the $3 mark, the
Government made an ass of itself over
uranium exports, CRA poured cold
water over the idea of getting a new
uranium contract for Mary Kathleen
(in which KI has a 35 percent in-
terest), and other metals like nickel
and iron ore took the centre of the
stage at the mining post. On top of
that, Kathleen Investments itself has
put out a most unimpressive, uninfor-
mative and confusing set of accounts.
So the shares are now down at little
better than $2.50. At that price they
are one of the most interesting pros-
pects on the board; despite everything,
Kathleen Investments 50-cent shares
appear to be worth every bit of $3
—and probably a good bit more.
And by next year the company wall
probably be doing well enough for it
to put out accounts that say exactly
what they mean. (Directors might
even decide to mention in their next
annual report the acquisitions they may
make during the year; last year’s take-
over, for an unstated amount, of Ilmen-
ite Minerals Pty. Ltd., increasing Kl’s
ilmenite capacity in W.A. by 40 per-
cent, was not mentioned in the latest
report, which simply revealed in the
notes to the accounts that the acquisi-
tion of a subsidiary during the year
had brought an increase of $417,993 in
intangibles.)
Even though this stock is one in
which investors must (repeatedly) put
their hands in their pockets and their
trust in the board of directors, the
potential rewards are very large indeed.
These rewards will not be in uranium
alone; the company’s other activities
are only now beginning to return some-
thing approaching their true income
potential—and there is a lot more scope
for improvement from them—so that it
is no longer realistic to think of Kath-
leen simply in terms of uranium, with
a few other things thrown in. These
other things will end up earning as
much as uranium ever did.
Kathleen Investments is now getting
no income at all from the MKU mine,
which has not been worked for five
years since the old contracts ran out,
MKU’s assets (worth $27 million on
book values) are being maintained
ready to begin work on the next
uranium contract that is confidently ex-
pected to come along within the next
four years or so. One advantage of the
CRA group’s alleged lack of enthusiasm
about seeking a contract for Mary
Kathleen is that many knowledgable
experts consider prices for uranium ore
are likely to rise sharply in the 1970 s
and could even exceed those obtain-
able in the halcyon days of the late
19505. So the longer CRA takes to
negotiate a uranium contract for Mary
Kathleen, the more profitable it is
likely to be.
The implications of a contract of
reasonable size are simply that Kath-
leen Investments would earn at least
$H million a year from it, and prob-
ably a good deal more, meaning, at a
most conservative estimate, that Kath-
leen would achieve at least a 50 per-
cent earning rate from uranium alone.
Before that happens, there seems every
chance that 1969 profits could be over
the slm. mark from its other ventures
(to cover a dividend cost of about
$807,000 by then, in the absence of
further new issues). There seems no
risk of Mary Kathleen missing out on
uranium contracts.
But by the time this happens, in the
early 19705, Kathleen Investments will
probably be earning as much from its
other mining interests, which have been
solidly built up in recent times (it has
even been taking a stake in uranium
outside the MKU interest) and has at
least two most interesting prospects,
one of which it is pi'esently developing.
And while investors wait for the pot of
uranium at the end of the rainbow,
there is a five percent yield from the
steady 25 percent dividend which direc-
tors are determined to maintain despite
the failure of profits to cover it in the
past two years.
Last year Kathleen failed by $68,000
to meet its dividend charge of $625,500;
this, for the current year, will rise
to $733,000 and to $807,000 in 1968.
So the current year’s profit must rise
by $175,000 and the year after’s by a

further $75,000, to meet the 25 percent
dividend (or a 44 percent profit rise
in the next two years). The company
seems well able to do so.
Last year, Kathleen Investments’
share of the dividends from Rutile and
Zircon Mines totalled about $386,340
after deducting outside shareholders’ in-
terests. This should be held fairly steady
in the next two years, as the changed
contract arrangements with du Pont
that allows for a greater amount of
rutile to be sold on the higher world
market will not be effective until 1968.
And that advantage will be offset by
the disruptions that are to follow when
two of the mining units are relocated.
It looks as if higher ilmenite profits
from the Cable subsidiary in W.A. will
alone produce a big enough profit rise
to meet next year’s dividend charge,
even if all the other ventures did no
better. And the prospects are that at
least one of these, Pilbara Tin, will do
a whole lot better than last year’s
nominal loss of $2722. Pilbara’s loss
followed a difficult year in which the
plant played up, labor costs were high
metallurgical problems emerged, and
only 309 tons of tin concentrate were
produced. But things are a lot better
on all fronts this year and by the end
of 1967 the company should have
pushed its production rate up to the 600
tons a year mark.
This year should see the first returns
from Kl’s iron ore interests, as a prefer-
ence dividend could be paid totalling
about $65,000 if things go as planned.
And the same goes for 1968. By 1970
Kl’s 8 l-3rd interest in North West
Iron (a half-owner with the Japanese
of the Savage River project to sell 2 1
million tons of pellets a year to Japan
over 20 years) should be bringing in
about $lOO,OOO a year to KI and at
the same time Kathleen will be get-
ting back in instalments its $1 million
preference capital in the venture to re-
turn it a capital profit of $165,000.
(Half of this preference capital is re-
deemable in 1970 and then the rest in
four equal instalments).
So the 1969 dividend of about
$llO,OOO will be largely contributed by
preference income, which will diminish
when the preference shares begin to be
repaid in 1970 (but which could well be
made up completely by ordinary share
income from the venture). KI will end
up owning 240,000 ordinary shares in
the venture, costing it about $330,000
and earning a minimum of 25 cents a
share (or $60,000 altogether). But more
realistic estimates set the likely profit
per share at about 55 cents, or about
$130,000 a year on Kathleen’s invest-
ment. There is also the prospect that
development of the remaining two-
thirds of the Savage River iron ore de-
posits not included in the present
scheme may begin in a few years’ time,
and possibly the preference capital
repayments from NW Iron may find
their way into another iron ore oper-
ation.
In the past two years, Kathleen In-
vestments has been carrying a lot of
projects that have long-term significance
but which have been unproductive at
the time. The company has had to

This week the vastly expanded bauxite
project, and the new township of Weipa
built with the financial assistance of
the Queensland Government, are being
officially opened. Weipa is one of the
major world sources of bauxite, the raw
material of aluminium.
Bulk ore ships carry the bauxite to Aus-
tralia’s largest smelter, Comalco’s Bell
Bay plant in Tasmania.
This year Weipa will supply 2.5 million
tons of bauxite to alumina refineries at
Bell Bay, Gladstone, and overseas. By
1969,it will provide the mineral base for
two out of three aluminium smelters in
Australia, and the raw material also for
the planned Comalco international
smelter in New Zealand.
Weipa bauxite, and Comalco aluminium,
mean national development in aluminium.

raise a lot of cash from new issues to
finance these, the size of the issues
being in part a result of directors’ deter-
mination to keep paying out so much
in dividends (a reasonable policy in
the circumstances, for it keeps a high
premium on the shares).
After the latest issue (which was
finalised after the end of the company’s
financial year in December 31), the
company’s share premium reserve
totalled almost $3 million against capital
of $3.4 million. When the good times
come there is plenty of scope for
bonus issues, but it also means that
by using these premiums, the company
has effectively raised about $3 million
at no cost to itself in recent years.
(Last year, the company raised more
than $1 million in capital, lifting it
by 43 percent, and got in another $1.3
million in share premiums).
But the accounts do not look very
appealing at all. Because of the high
level of intangible assets (the excess of
cost over the book value of assets
acquired) of $1.3 million, shareholders’
funds, in the business as represented by
tangible assets now fall about $380,000
short of the $5.9 million that has been
raised from shareholders in capital and
premiums. But not all of the capital is
to require servicing immediately; the
issue last November was to provide
some of the cash for Kathleen’s $1.35
million investment in the Savage River
iron ore deal. This deferred capital
will begin to rank for dividend at the
same time ordinary dividends from NW
Iron are due to be paid in 1969.
The accounts show some considerable
movements during the year, due largely
to the Ilmenite Minerals acquisition;
mineral leases at cost have jumped by
more than 50 percent to $968,000, for
example. But the huge rise in stock
from $178,000 to $965,000 was not sig-
nificant at all; stock levels depend
mainly on shipping dates, and have a
consequent effect on short-term borrow-
ings. The company borrowed million
to finance its NW Iron investment, and
the development at Pilbara Tin is
also a factor in the $l.l million in bank
term loans (up $400,000) and accounts
for most of the rise in depreciation
from $112,000 to $276,000.
The company is also maintaining an
energetic investigation program, and
there is always the chance that some-
thing could come up (it has done so
fairly impressively so far). Current
prices look unrealistically low.

Better than it looks
Ampol faces the second half
By JASON in Sydney
AMPOL JUST got there in the first
half. A couple of weeks ago we said
here that, even though earning rate
would be low, it looked as if the 10
percent dividend would be held after
all. Last week’s news that it will be
paid out of profits that barely cover
it, despite a tax holiday, is probably
a bit better than it looks. A lot of
things should be working for Ampol
in the second half of the financial year
to September 30 that were not helping
in the first half.
Petrol consumption will go up faster
than the 3.2 percent gallonage rise in
the first half (it is intriguing to see
that sales value rose by only 0.8 per-
cent in the period), and the petrol
price rise will also help by adding
about $BOO,OOO to profits that totalled
$2.66 million in the first half (our
previous calculations were made on a
wrong report from Melbourne that a
1 cent rise brings a $1 million profit
rise; it only takes a J cent rise to do
that).
Improving results from Lytton re-
finery and a better crude price (only
one-quarter of the impact of which
benefited the first half’s profits) will
also help to keep Ampol’s head just
above the 10 percent ocean.
LAST YEAR there wasn’t one nickel
stock in Australia; now there are more
than you can poke a stick at. And
there will be plenty more mining
managements who will suddenly find
they had nickel deposits under their
belts all the time and their shares
will soar. One or two of them might
even turn out to be worth while. There
is no prize for guessing which mining
company will be the first to father a
separately listed nickel company. The
absence of a mining stock with “nickel”
in its name cannot last; the minino-
post is certain to get fuller.
Nickel fever has had a remarkable
impact on these companies that have
announced discoveries, and our mining
correspondent discusses these on this
page. One stock affected by last week’s
announcement of Anaconda’s nickel
find in Western Australia was New
Broken Hill, for which the Chartist
had forecast a fall in The Bulletin. But
the Chartist now says:
“New Broken Hill, which had pre-
viously shown bearish tendencies, can
now be reappraised, as it has broken
above the resistance level at $5.50. The
1965-67 consolidation pattern suggests
that the rise could continue to over $B,
with the possibility of a further move
to $lO, where the situation would again
call for reassessment.”
DETAILS of the previously reported
improvement in Myer’s profit for the
half-year are even more heartening than
the broad outlines. For, to confirm what
The Bulletin has been suggesting in its
frequent comments on the investment
appeal of retailing stocks in the past
few months, Myer’s managing-director,
Mr. Kenneth Myer, said: “The profit
increase was largely the result of more
buoyant public retail spending.”
This stock is still good buying at
current prices of around $3.18 for
those who failed to take advantage of
prices below $3 late last year.

Anaconda and its nickel partners
MORE NICKEL, an iron-ore float,
more oil, then again more nickel. It
was really CRA’s week, with a nickel
strike to gild the Hamersley lily. The
nickel ore was found in an area being
worked by a consortium consisting of
Anaconda (Australia) Inc., Zinc Cor-
poration (100 percent owned by CRA),
and New Broken Hill Consolidated
Limited (32 percent owned by CRA).
It is notable, too, in being the first
important mineral strike found by
Anaconda in Australia. The lease on
which the strike was made is held by
Anaconda, and the CRA group has a
40 percent working interest in it, with
Zinc Corporation having 26 2-3rd per-
cent and New Broken Hill 13 l-3rd
percent. The actual strike was south of
Widgiemooltha, which is itself some
twenty miles distance from Kambalda
i n a southerly direction. The drill hole

same measure of success as that enjoyed
by Western Mining Corporation. CRA
shares leapt from $7.30 to $9.00 when
the announcement was made and New
Broken Hill climbed from $5.10 to
$6.30.

Mining Corporation and adjoins it in
the area just south of Widgiemooltha.
The road and rail line to Norseman
passes through the middle of the area
and this will no doubt be of assistance
to the economics of any development
project. Following the recent nickel
strikes by Western Mining in the Paris-
St. Ives district, some 20-odd miles
south of Kambalda and about 20 miles
east of Widgiemooltha, the latest strike
must considerably upgrade the pros-
pects of other leaseholders in the area.
This applies particularly to Western
Mining itself, as its lease covers most
of the area contained in the triangle
formed by the three nickel deposits
indicated to date. Nevertheless, this
is hardly a firm basis for optimism—
Kalgoorlie itself did not cover much
more ground than the actual “Golden
Mile.”
Other companies with leases in the
area include Australian Selection Pty.
Ltd., the local subsidiary of Selection
Trust Ltd., of England, which has a
lease close to the western boundary of
Western Mining’s area; Newmont Pty.
Ltd., the local subsidiary of Newmont
Mining Corporation, of the U.S.A.,
which has a lease to the north of Kam-
balda; and International Nickel, which
has one lease just south of Kalgoorlie
and two others which adjoin Western
Mining’s area to the north and the
west.
BHP has a lease next door to Western
Mining’s on the north-east side, while
about 35 miles away to the west of Kam-
balda it is interesting to see that a lease
is held by Metals Exploration NL. Both
these companies are also testing nickel
areas elsewhere—BHP at Rockhampton
in conjunction with International
Nickel, and Metals Exploration at
Greenvale, west of Townsville, in con-
junction with Freeport Sulphur, of the
U.S.A. Since Metals Exploration was
mentioned in these columns six weeks
ago, its shares have moved from 35
cents to over a dollar entirely on the
company’s interest in nickel prospects.
The latest strike showed the oppor-
tunities available from tagging along
with CRA in its exploration activities
by holding shares in New Broken Hill
Consolidated Ltd. It was well known
that New BH had a one-third share
in CRA’s Bougainville prospect, but
as the agreement between CRA and
Anaconda regarding the latter’s areas
in Western Australia was not widely
known, New BEI was not, until last
week, esteemed as having bonanza pos-
sibilities. Sharing the results of CRA’s
exploration through New BH must
now be considered quite attractive,
especially as New BH has only 14.6
million shares issued, against CRA’s
79-4 million shares. This large difference
in capital “gears up” the per-share

Security analysis
Tooth’s pricing could be
more realistic
IT IS FORTUNATE that Tooth and
Co. Limited has given details of its
profit for the year to March 31, 1967,
before this article was written, because
it would have been difficult to suggest
whether the profit would have been up
or down. The interim report suggested
that prefit would be down because sales
and profits were down in the first half,
and as at the date of the report “the
tenor of trade” had been “steady.” As
reported, net profit after tax was up
by just under $24,000, but the tax pro-
vision was down by $320,000; so the
figure for net profit before tax was down
by about $296,000, or about three per-
cent. Not a very substantial decline,
yet it was the first decline since 1962-3.
The statistics during the past five
years are:

Until this latest result, it could have
been calculated that earnings per share
were increasing at an average rate of
just under seven percent per annum
compound, but the decline in 1966-7
means that this rate of growth must be
suspect. One thing is, however, very-
clear and that is the company’s ability
to increase the dividend rate each year.
The annual increases in the rate (in-
cluding the approximate increase re-
sulting from bonus issues and the “bonus
content” or rights issues) have been as
follows:
1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959
V 2% V 2% 1V4% V 2% V 4% V 4% V 4%
1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
V 2% V 4% iv 2% V 4% %% %% v 2%
Now, there has been another increase
of \ percent in 1967 which has taken
the rate over the “magical” 16 percent
rate. Late in 1964, it was predicted
that the company would make another
bonus issue shortly after the rate
reached 16 percent. At that time this
rate should have been achieved in 1966,
so the latest date for the bonus issue
would have been October, 1966. All
this is rather like astrology and so far
the bonus issue has not occurred. It
wall certainly be interesting to see
whether the whole market wall be sur-
prised in the future, for after the recent
announcement the price tended to
weaken slightly. During the time of
“bonus fever,” one technical analyst
was predicting that the price would
reach 124/- or 127/- ($6.20 or $6.35
in today’s shares and money).
There could be other factors which
caused the price weakness; disappoint-
ment is likely to be one of them. The
chairman’s address of last June cer-
tainly did not give any cause for
optimism and the tone of the interim
report seemed to confirm this. It had
been made quite clear that higher costs
were likely to take their toll this year.
Malt is the main ingredient of beer
brewing and there was a substantial
increase in its price. Labor is also of
some considerable consequence and the
price of labor was also increased last
August.
Most businesses, when faced with
substantial cost increases, usually take
the immediate step of increasing the
price of their product. There would
seem considerable scope to increase the
New South Wales price of beer because
the wholesale price (less excise duty)
is considerably lower than it is in other
States. The following table shows what
the brewer gets for his kilderkin in
each State:
State 5
Queensland 6 58
New South Wales 4 90
Vctoria 6.14
South Australia 6.38
Western Australia 7.92
The theoretical economist might well
claim that the low New South Wales
price results from competition, as there
were three brewers active in New South
Wales. This would not be confirmed by
the situation in other States. Victoria
has the next lowest price—only 25 per-
cent greater than New South Wales—
and there is a monopoly in that State.
Such an increase in the wholesale
price is most unlikely; so far as can
be estimated, the last increase received
by the brew ers probably averaged about
20 cents a kilderkin. From the record
of the two New South Wales brewers,
one would say that the w'hole of that
increase has more than been absorbed
by higher costs and there are more in-
creases in costs still to be absorbed. It
is probable that the increase in the malt
price will only be temporary, so there
could well be a reduction in this cost
during 1967-8. Labor costs, on the
other hand, are permanent under to-
day’s conditions.
Another factor which cannot be ig-
nored is the recent acquisition by
Tooheys of the Miller’s brewery at
Taverner’s Hill. The full effect of this
move cannot be apparent to an out-
sider at this stage. Tooheys will prob-
ably gain additional brew'ing capacity
in the Sydney area, which it badly
needed, and will find additional out-
lets for its beer through the Miller’s
hotels. Presumably Miller’s beer will be
sold through Tooheys hotels; just what
will happen to the substantial club
trade, which both Tooheys and Millers
have built up, is difficult to tell. On the
face of it, one cannot see that the move
will increase the share of the market
held by Tooheys and Millers combined
but there will be some cost savings in
brewing and distribution.
There does not seem to be any dan-
ger that another competitor will try to
enter the New South Wales beer market.
Apart from the fact that the brewers
operate on the lowest selling price of
all the States, there is the other factor
that they have achieved the greatest
proportion of “tied houses.” In Vic-
toria, the number of tied houses seems
to be in the minority. The position is
completely reversed, it would seem, in
New South Wales.
It is therefore safe to assume that
competition will continue between
Tooth and Tooheys, but that the prob-
ability that either will achieve a vastly
different share of the market is rather
remote. If Tooheys was able to gain
another one percent share over the next
five years, it would be a very good per-
formance.
Tooth’s future prospects, then, are
related to the growth that will occur
in the New South Wales market and to
the probability of future increases in the
price which the brewer receives. These
factors not only determine the profit
that will be made from brewing, but
they also have quite a strong influence
on the rental revenue from the hotels,
since the rentals are often geared to the
value of beer sold.
Beer consumption will probably con-
tinue to increase for a few years at
about 3 percent compound per annum,
assuming that the retail price does not
reach a level which makes sales decline.
It is noticeable that, after each increase
in excise duty, sales have declined,
although they have tended to recover in
six to twelve months. The matter of
increases in prices to the brewer is prob-
ably a very delicate one and the
brewers might well feel rather cautious
about raising the price, even though
New’ South Wales would seem to have
a very strong case.
With Tooth’s shares selling at $4.94
to show an immediate dividend yield
of 3.3 percent covered apparently 1.55
times, the shares look attractive on a
historical pricing basis. It does seem
that the price envisages a future
growth rate in both dividends and
earnings of about 9 percent per annum
compound, and the prospects of achiev-
ing this rate of growth do not seem
very bright at the present time. A
price closer to $4.50 would seem more
realistic. Even then, the shares would
be selling at 18 times earnings, while
Carlton & United are selling at 14
times. The future prospects of the two
companies might just warrant such a
differential.

Modern industry must have water to survive . . .
millions of gallons of it. An endless flow of pure fresh
water every hour, every day. Marley Cooling Towers
throughout Australia save fresh water so industry can
use it over and over again. In fact Marley Towers
save a staggering 2.5 million gallons every minute.
In a year this is more water than can be stored in
Lake Eucumbene —that's a lot of water. And that s
one more reason you should look to Email for your

PART OF LIQUID AIR'S REMARKABLE SERVICE IS LETTING YOU GET
HIGH ON IT.
Read how LIQUID AIR know-how solved a client’s unusual problem . . . and how
this know-how could apply to you.
One of Liquid Air’s clients, G. W. Bradman, of Maroubra, was up in the air when he secured a contract
for the destruction of the Ultimo Power House. Really up in the air. A Scrap Cutter; he had to begin by
cutting up boilers 80 feet above ground. His problem? Getting oxygen—large supplies of oxygen—up
to that level.
His need was urgent: he wanted service fast, so he called in LIQUID AIR. Our technicians immediately
improvised a system by which cylinders in crates were lifted by crane to the top of the Power House.
And Bradman the Scrap Cutter began work on time.
To make things flow even more smoothly, LIQUID AIR then began supplying oxygen by trailers. From
these trailers hoses were slung up to the working site, and the job was completed, trouble-free, gas
supply assured.
Solving problems for clients like G. W. Bradman is one reason why LIQUID AIR has achieved such a
remarkable reputation for service. There are others. A complete range of gases and accesssories.
Prompt, on-time deliveries. And assistance, any-time, day or night. (Call us if necessary at 3 a.m. We'll
come running.)
If you want this sort of service, or have a problem that’s above your head, call in the experts—

Madame Georges Mora with one of her own paintings, “Boy With Butterfly"
By SHEELAH WOOD
MIRKA MORA wife of Georges
Mora the Melbourne restaurateur, is
Ml « seldom
available to the public; she doesn’t like
to part with them
u , , , ' i r T} lice : ari
Madame Mora was born of Russ
ew,sh parents who escaped toi France
dealer'and her*mother, she
says, living.” In 1943,
when the Germans invaded Paris, the
family was arrested by the Gestapo.
The mother sent the father into hiding
so that he could try to arrange their
escape, and with her three little girls
she was taken in an °P en cart t 0 a
camp outside Paris. They were interned
25,000 people for three weeks.
* of age
The miracle happened. Eighteen
people were suddenly and inexplicably
released. Mirka’s family was among the
lucky ones and the children left the
camp with their clothing bulging wi
e.ters from mmates for relatives out-
side the camps.
They returned to their flat and the
Resistance arranged for them to leave
separately for the country. The family
w Js final i y united in a sma u village.
Madame Mora met her husband while
they were both working with orphaned
and destitute children. Mirka was work-


ing in an orphanage for Jewish chil-
dren while Georges was trying to con-
tact their families. The tragedy of some
of these, in many cases, reluctant re-
unions and the terror and sadness of
the children has had a profound effect
on her life.
In 1951, the Moras migrated to
Australia with their eldest child, Phil-
lip; their other children, William and
Tiriel, were born here.
Georges’ first job in Australia was
managing a noodle factory. He was
miserable, but the noodles were mar-
vellous for the huge dinner parties
given by the Moras for their impover-
ished artist friends. These they gave
endlessly, some lasting for days. They
combined them with art exhibitions.
Madame Mora recalls giving one
party costing £25 for Charles Black-
man and selling one picture for £ls.
Most of Georges’ money went on
food and wine and the rest on buying
pictures. Finally, they thought it more
practical to open a combined restau-
rant and gallery. It did not pay, per-
haps because they never charged the
artists.
Mr. Mora became one of the found-
ers of the Museum of Modern Art and
opened a restaurant without any ex-
hibitions. It paid! But he has now
completed the circle and owns the
Tolarno Restaurant in St. Kilda with a
gallery housed in the same building.
The Moras live in the residential,
part of the Tolarno, but have a tiny
beach house at Aspendale. Madame is
a woman of great personal charm; she
is not interested in possessions as such
and her house is not “decorated.” It
is filled with paintings, books, and
friends constantly calling for solace and
encouragement, of which she seems to
have an endless supply. 1
Clothes are not important to her
She considers that, for her, the tim
achieving the right ones is better spent
on other pursuits. But she thinks
well-dressed woman is a work of art
and to be admired. She says that all
women should read as much as p os .
sible, books that are a challenge.
Madame Mora has a wonderful col.
lection of dolls. She believes that dolls
have a personality and resemble people
There have been many writers, cok
lectors, and artists who have shared
this belief, she says.
The Moras continually entertain
and their Sunday breakfasts are
famous in Melbourne. Clocks play no
part in her life. Her ideal dinner
party begins when everyone gets there
and when she herself is finally ready,

If you’re wondering how we manage to cover that
many miles an hour, the answer is really
very simple. We do it by going so many places. All
at once. Just as we’re about to take off in San
Francisco, we’re landing in Hong Kong, circling over
Manila, approaching Zamboanga, serving
cocktails above Honolulu, fastening seat belts in
Australia and taxiing in to Taipei. You
can see how a thing like that adds up. So there’s
really nothing new about flying
6,000 m.p.h. We do it every day.

THE LAND
Wool feast for the Argentine
By the RURAL EDITOR
THE TROUBLES afflicting the New
Zealand wool industry are well known,
yew Zealand, which operates a re-
serve price selling system, moved the
price up believing that growers deserved
a little more and that the trade would
stand it. Immediately buyers resisted.
To date, this season, the New Zealand
Wool Commission has had to spend
nearly SA.4O million buying in 321,000
bales of wool. The commission hopes to
be able to put this wool back on the
market when prices recover.
The International Wool Secretariat
has promised a massive promotion cam-
paign to lift the demand for crossbred
wool (the type which predominates in
N.Z.). The IWS has accepted an enor-
mous challenge. Not only must it im-
Woolmark. —why the global circles?
prove demand, but it also must improve
prices. There is evidence which suggests
jhat if the price had not been raised, or
if it were dropped even now, the N.Z.
wool would be cleared.
The IWS is blaming a world-wide
lack of interest in crossbred wools for
Ae N.Z. debacle, not the setting of too
high a price. This is what woolgrowers
have become conditioned to hearing. A
minority of vocal opponents of the IWS
and its theories maintains a fairly con-
sent attack, but the feeling of the
majority is indicated by their willing-
ness to contribute to IWS funds, now
U P to sl4 million a year. Half of this
c °mes from the Australian Government,
which is likewise under the spell.
Inquiring minds have already won-
dered why the IWS, which is supposed
to be so well informed in these matters,
was unable to predict in advance what
was likely to happen in N.Z. The IWS,
given to all kinds of predictions, might
have got in early and started some kind
of promotion before the N.Z. slump.
But this would assume that there is,
in fact, a world-wide lack of interest
in crossbred wool. There is in N.Z.,
and there is in Australia, also. We know
that. But there are reports, not coming
forward from IWS sources, of quite
remarkable increases in purchases in
Argentina. Buyers, principally British,
have never been so active in the Argen-
tine. What has been a famine for N.Z.
growers has been a feast for their
counterparts in the Argentine.
Argentine wool is not strictly com-
parable with N.Z. wool; no two wools
ever are, but it is essentially Corrie-
dale type and finds much the same
end-use. Argentina, along with all the
other South American countries, is not
a member of the IWS, and at this stage
it seems safe to say it has no intention
of joining. Efforts have been made to
bring the South Americans in for years.
Sir William Gunn, Australian Wool
Board and IWS chairman, and Mr. W.
J. Vines, IWS director, have been
there on at least three separate occa-
sions. Each time they have come away
expressing hope. But still the South
American countries stay out of the
IWS, which is neither here nor there,
and continue to be missing from the
list of contributors to IWS funds, which
is what counts.
The remarkable thing about Argen-
tine, and South American, wool expan-
sion is that it is well known to many
Australians yet is rarely publicised.
There is nothing to be hidden. What is
going on is an open book. It is being
aided by the contribution of Australian
wool men who are working in the
Argentine in many capacities —■ as
managers and demonstrators of all kinds
of equipment used in the wool industry.
The South American wool industry
is profitable. There is no need to send
delegations of fact-finding missions there
to know that. The peso was devalued
again in March this year. The sudden
lift - in wool sales to Britain, and the
slump in N.Z. sales, was fairly ob-
viously given an impetus by devalua-
tion. That profitability is of a high order
in Argentina is indicated by an Inter-
American Development Bank loan of
$32 million in April this year. This

loan has a different aim from the Aus-
tralian Government farm loan, which is
used, largely, by existing farmers for
restocking and improvement. The Ar-
gentine loan will put 8000 new families
on the land.
The same amount of money would
not do the same thing here. These
people will probably be living in con-
ditions similar to those in the Australian
bush 50 years ago. We could not return
to those days even if we wanted to.
Nevertheless, there is no excuse for
the stop-gap, after-the-ball methods of
the IWS."
The bold remedy, made long ago
but pushed into oblivion by those im-
bued with an ambition to encompass
the world, was that Australian wool-
growers should promote Australian
wool, Australian textiles, and Australian
fashions. The Woolmark, instead of
being global circles, should have been
the Australian flag or some derivative.
It was not such a bad suggestion, par-
ticularly as New Zealand may be unable
to find its share of the IWS contribu-
tion, leaving Australia and South
Africa (strange partners, really) carry-
ing the message of wool to a world
which includes countries willing and
able to knock us off the top of the
heap.

The new look in
wool bales
SOON WE WILL see plainly that the
great Australian grazing industry has
changed. That old traditional symbol,
the bulging bale of wool, will look dif-
ferent. It will be smaller and narrower
than the squat variety so familiar
to generations of Australians. Plastic
wraps will also tend to take the place
of the jute pack. Plans and experiments
are afoot, too, for changing the dimen-
sions of the dumped bale for shipping
overseas.
Lreight to bring a bale of wool from
the shearing shed to the seaboard selling
centre averages a startling $4 at present.
This could be reduced if the bales were
made smaller while containing the same
amount of wool about 3151 b. The
CSIRO Division of Textile Physics,
Ryde, N.S.W., seems to have come up
with a practical means of doing this
by a modification that can be made to
most existing woolshed presses. Re-
searcher J. G. Downes suggests fitting
a wooden lining inside the press box to
reduce its cross-sectional dimensions by
four inches each way. Since the height
of this box is unaltered, more pressure
A polyethylene woulpaek
can be applied to the wool as the
monkey is brought down.
Downes found that in pressing the
average traditional bale the monkey
applies a thrust of around three tons.
But the common types of presses are
constructed to be able to exert up to
seven tons. In making his new narrow
bales, this capacity is utilised. After
being modified, hand presses demand
considerable exertion to operate and
the presser is slowed down. However,
the throughput from power-operated
presses should not be greatly altered.
The main difficulty with all these
souped-up presses is to get the skewers
out because of the extra force put on
them by the wool. Methods of over-
coming this problem are still being
investigated.
When the standard-size woolpack is
put into one of these converted presses,
the bale comes out with less bulbous
ends and the sides unfilled and flabby.
On account of this appearance, they are
being described as “slack packs.”
Although weighing as much as the old
bales, 58 slack packs can be loaded on
a motor-truck which can take only 42
old bales. Rail trucks can carry 20 per-
cent more wool in slack packs. On the
buying floor the new bales open up to
present the valuers with equally attrac-
tive wool.
Mr. Downes has found that if a
dumping press is constructed to exert
pressure on the sides of the bale as
well as the ends, a dumped bale of
ten cubic feet can be produced. More-
over, their shape permits more of them
to be stacked into the shipping con-
tainers that are becoming the vogue.
These containers are meant to carry
18 tons. With the new dump-pressed
bales, 14 tons of wool can be packed
into a container, whereas only six tons
in the old dumps will fit in. Carding,
combing, spinning, and weaving tests
show that the wool is unharmed by
being packed so tightly. However,
many other aspects have yet to be

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT - significant growth from an idea
How many people know as they use thousands of tons of
Australian-made paper in stationery, books, magazines
and printed brochures that behind this highly organised
regular supply lies an unusual story of progress.
Thirty years ago, all our fine paper was imported because
pulp for this paper came from long-fibred wood, of which
Australia had little. Despite those who said it could not
be done, pulp for fine paper was made here from our own
short-fibred eucalypt trees and a great new industry,
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited, was born.
From idea to idea, process to process, quality to quality,
right through to catering for most of Australia’s needs
in fine paper, the company’s large mill at Burnie, Tasmania,
has never stopped developing its resources and its
products. This saves us millions of pounds in overseas
exchange every year.
And the long and short of Australia’s growth, too, is the
ability to stand on our own feet and develop our own ideas.

BOOKS
Journey to an unknown fate
By JOHN BAXTER
The Fixer. Bernard Malamud. Eyre and
Spottiswoode. $3.85.
ONE LOOKS in despair at the list of
novels which have won the Pulitzer
Prize in recent years—“To Kill A
Mockingbird,” “The Keepers of the
House,” the sprawling and ill-written
“Advise and Consent” and wonders
what criteria its judges can be using to
choose the successful candidates.
Devalued though the prize has become,
however, it remains one of the few
objective standards by which we may
gauge the impact of a novel on the
American mind, and its award this year
to “The Fixer” provides us with an
interesting indication of two significant
features of modern American fiction.
The first, the complete pre-eminence of
Jewish writers in the novel, is no sur-
prise to those who have followed the
careers of Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, and
their compatriots. The second, indicated
by “The Fixer’s” fairly conventional
structure and style, is the accelerating
dissipation of the energy of American
writing, once the embodiment of vitality
and excitement, now lacklustre and
dull. If this is indeed the greatest novel
to have been produced in the United
States during the past year, there is
a great deal wrong with American
letters.
The simple drama of this novel’s basic
premise is initially arresting. Set in
Kiev in the early part of this century,
it is the story of an enterprising and
ambitious Jew named Yakov Bok, who
is caught up in the turmoil of political
unrest which culminated in the Russian
Revolution. Led by his skill as a handy-
man or “fixer” to move out of the
Jewish ghetto of Kiev and take a job
under an assumed name in a quarter
forbidden to people of his race, he is
arrested for doing so, and then jailed
without trial. His offence, however, is
not that of having moved above his
station. The authorities, anxious for a
scapegoat to whom may be diverted the
energies of a restless country, trump up
a charge of ritual murder, accusing Bok
of having murdered a boy and drained
his blood to make passover matzohs.
Mistreated, jailed for two years without
trial under hideous conditions, he never-
theless refuses to admit to the obscene
libels of the police, and the final scene
shows him borne off unshaken through
jeering crow T ds to his trial and an
unknown fate.
Malamud’s skill as a technician cannot
be contested. The bleak and inevitable
story of Yakov’s ambition and fall
unrolls with smooth assurance against a
background drawn in with broad,
sombre strokes. His Russia is a cold,
dark land of poverty and despair, where
a simple meal of bread, cucumber, and
sour cream and the leisure in which to
sit beside the road and eat it are luxuries
the poor need not expect to find often.
Authority looms above Bok and his
kind in the form of a benign but
impossibly distant Tsar, and, more
immediate in its menace, a suspicious
and vigilant local government devoted
more to peculation than justice. So
heavily are the dice weighed against
Bok that we are not especially surprised
when he is arrested. His fall has an
inevitability fitting the story’s inexorable
attention to the details of poverty and
oppression.
It is the inevitability of “The Fixer”
that in the end diminishes its impact,
making it less the good novel that it
might have been. Having mapped out
the story with a craftsman’s attention
to detail, Malamud will not leave it
alone. Where the fragile nature of the
book’s premise seems likely to dictate
a slackening of pace, the author
instantly props up the narrative with a
dream sequence, a monologue, or a
trivial incident, expanded out of all
proportion to its real importance, in
order to fill the gap which yawns in the
exposition. Though Bok is confined
alone in an almost empty cell for two
years, and the book, with few diver-
gencies, consists mostly of his mental
mutterings and the incidental routine
of his imprisonment, the reader is never
bored. Laudable in most novels, this
approaches the status of a fatal flaw in
a book where the writer must evoke the
feeling of imprisonment and isolation or
fail in his objective.
There is, it must be admitted, a
certain confusion on the part of the
reader as to what Malamud’s objective
is. Though he draws, on the one hand,
a detailed picture of an individual
fighting back, more through stubborn-
ness than intelligence, against the pres-
sures of a malevolent authority, there
is a tendency throughout “The Fixer”
for generalisations about free will and
individual responsibility to occupy the
writer’s attention more than they should
for the purposes of balance. There are
hints that Malamud may be suggesting
that man is at the mercy of history,
that if Bok had not been seized and
imprisoned, then somebody else would
have, but the idea has hardly been
Bernard Malamud
planted before it is engulfed by the
relentless detailing of some piece of
prison discipline or an unproductive
visit by the warder.
With a little more care on Malamud’s
part to explore the larger implications
of Bok's imprisonment, “The Fixer”
might have become the statement on
“injustice, today or at any time” which
the jacket note claims it to be. Remarks
like Bok’s bemused “What choice has
a man who doesn’t know what his
choices are?” are more intriguing than
the writer seems to feel, and the general
question of a philosophical basis for
Jewish persecution, if one can, and
does, exist, is surely more worthy of
exploration than the state of one man’s
mind, especially when that mind lacks
both depth and perception. “Being born
a Jew,” Bok remarks, “meant being
vulnerable to history, including its worst
errors.” One does not deny the potential
of this statement to be true, but why is
it true? Malanmd produces no evidence
or argument, and we return to the
somewhat less stimulating problem of
whether Bok vsdll hold out until the
trial.
There have been hundreds of novels
on the theme of political imprisonment,
but it is no criticism of “The Fixer
to say that it deals with a familiar sub-
ject. The criticism is that it does so
without new insight and without a
genuinely serious consideration of the
matter’s implications. Rash as it is for
anybody to attempt an improvement
on Koestler’s “Darkness At Noon” as
the definite study in this area, one com-
mends them for trying if they do so
with compassion and understanding
Malamud has neither. “The Fixer” is
an impeccably constructed but sterile
shell, as empty of meaning as the mind
of the novel’s central character.


Ruskin's marriage
By MARGARET IRVIN
Millais and the Ruskins. Mary Lutyens.
‘ John Murray, $6.40.
-j-jIIS BIOGRAPHY derives its
intefest from two sources the non-
consummation of the Ruskin marriage
and the part Millais played in the Rus-
es’ lives. Mary Lutyens has been so
scrupulously fair to the two main
antagonists, John and Effie Ruskin, and
to Millais that one may be excused for
taking sometimes an ambivalent, some-
times a cold attitude toward the three
characters. In the background is the
terrible strength and weakness of the
elder Ruskins’ parental anxiety and
possessiveness, the cause of their son’s
failure to become a fully mature per-
sonality. The author also deals with the
aims and methods of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood, and with R u s-k i n’s
“Modern Painters” and "The Seven
Lamps of Architecture.” No comment is
made of “Sesame and Lilies,” “Unto
This Last,” and “A Crown of Wild
Olive,” for these were not yet written.
The book opens wdth John and
Effie’s return to England after many
months in Venice, where Effie enjoyed
the society of Field-Marshal Radetzky,
various counts and countesses, grand
dukes and their duchesses. Her husband
had not mixed as freely, and w'as con-
sidered an eccentric and recluse. After
Venice, the house at Herne Hill was a
dull background for Effie, though in
Venice and in England she always
behaved with propriety. This is signifi-
cant, for Ruskin has been accused, per-
haps wrongly, of allowing his wife so
much liberty in the hope that she would
compromise herself and give him the
opportunity of ending the marriage.
It is extraordinary to read of the
apparent contentment of these two
badly matched people. Each wore the
persona of a successful marriage so
well that, for four years, no one sus-
pected they were completely mal-
adjusted and at variance. If it had not
been for the proximity and influence
of John’s parents and the meeting with
Millais, the couple might have con-
tinued their hypocrisy indefinitely. But
when Millais and Effie found they were
attracted, her unhappiness exploded,
and she was no longer careful to con-
ceal the incompatibility. From that
time, Ruskin treated her with increasing-
mental and emotional cruelty.
Mary Lutyens makes extensive use of
letters to construct the picture of her
characters’ day-to-day lives. This is a
very successful method, for every letter
illustrates uncannily the writer’s tem-
perament and attitudes. No description
or intuitive interpretation by the author
could have presented them so roundly
old Mr. Ruskin’s possessiveness and
e mphasis on his generosity; his wife’s
obsession wdth her son and her insin-
cerity; John’s callous criticism of his
wife, and his preservation of his self-
centred detachment; Effie’s gaiety,
passion for trivial detail, her courage,
and, at times, near hysteria; Millais’
self-indulgent melancholy and indigna-
tion; and Lady Eastlake’s flair for inter-
ference and scandalous gossip.
The latter played an important role
in the Ruskin drama. She loathed
Ruskin and did him incalculable harm
by recounting every .sordid detail she
could discover about the marriage. His
reaction to the scandal was to remain
silent and go about in public as if
nothing had happened to make him a
figure of opprobrium. This would have
been admirable if it had not been just
another expression of his appalling
passivity.
He certainly wished to get rid of his
wife, but on his own terms and without
having to bear, as he should have done
and was forced to do, the responsibility
for the failure of the marriage.
Although he knew of Millais’ and
Effie’s love, he continued to act as if
his friendship with Millais were unim-
paired, sitting for his portrait for Mil-
lais and forcing the latter into an intol-
erable position. The smooth surfaces
the Victorians could preserve were
nothing less than miraculous, but Mil-
lais dismissed him in a letter to Effie’s
mother in these words: “Surely such
a quiet scoundrel as this man never
existed, he comes here sitting as blandly
as ever, talking the whole time in
apparently a most interested way.’
Ruskin treated Millais impartially all
his life, praising his work and revering
him as a genius. He cared nothing for
human beings, only for their gifts.
An interesting part of the book is
concerned with Effie and Millais after
they were married, their behaviour
alternating between the neurotic and
the positive. In Effie’s case, this was
the result of the unhappy years with
Ruskin, on w'hich she brooded with
intense hatred that bound her to Rus-
kin more strongly than her life with
him had been able to do.
The core of the book is, of course,
Ruskin’s reaction to his marriage. He
was a deeply disturbed man to whom
the normality of married life was
repugnant. When Effie at last disclosed
her predicament to her mother, she
wrote: “He alleged various reasons.
Hatred to children, religious motives, a
desire to preserve my beauty, and,
finally last year told me his true reason
(and this to me is as villainous as all
the rest) . . .”
From this point until the whole
wretched business ends in the annul-
ment, one is aw'are of a recurring
thought: surely the non-consummation
of the marriage was the concern of
two people, their lawyers, and Millais,
and of no one else. That it became the
subject of scandalous gossip, public
dissension, and the cause of Effie s
frequent social ostracism was deplor-
able, though perfectly in keeping with
the pharisaic temper of the period.
Dandy of
literature
By H. I. HESELTINE
Letters of Wallace Stevens. Edited by
Holly Stevens. Faber. sl2.
THIS BOOK is handsomely made,
splendidly edited, and crammed with
material to fascinate both the student
and the casual reader. Its 992 letters
and (in the early years of Stevens’
career) journal entries open up new
perspectives on a major American poet
who has been, I suspect, too little
known and appreciated in this country.
For those of his American readers
who take literature and culture seri-
ously, the career of Wallace Stevens
must constitute a problem of some com-
plexity, since it affronts in so many
basic ways the prevailing transpacific
notions about what a poet is or ought
to be. American poetry has for so long
proclaimed its Americanness through its
revolt against the dominant social order
that the spectacle of a man at once
writing major verse and rising to
become director of an insurance com-
pany must have registered as a dis-
tinctly uncomfortable challenge. Stevens
himself was aware of the dichotomy
between his two vocations, but, as his
correspondence repeatedly shows, was
never troubled by it; indeed, scarcely
found the matter worthy of discussion.
The letters, too, reveal a markedly
conservative political alignment which
makes Stevens something of a maverick
among his contemporaries and peers. In
the ’thirties he could admire Mussolini;
in 1952, vote for Eisenhower; during
the Cold War, subscribe to the official
view of the Communist menace. His
own life was singularly untouched by
external violence or drama of any kind,
and he steadily refused to let his verse
take on the color of apocalyptic protest
which could have been so easily urged
upon him. He declined to attend a
memorial meeting for Dylan Thomas, a
gesture which adequately symbolises his
alienation from the Dionysiac tradition
of modern poetry.
Yet these letters of a long lifetime
(1879-1955) by no means reveal Stevens
as the poet of an American Establish-
ment. If he conformed to any native
tradition, it was to the Emersonian
one of self-reliance. “For my own part,”
he wrote to a young Cuban friend in
1947, “I like to live in a classic atmos-
phere, full of my own gods, and be
true to them until I have some better
authority than a merely contrary
opinion for not being true to them.
We have all to learn to hold fast.”
Wallace Stevens was from the begin-
ning and unalterably his own man.
Hording aloof from fashionable cul-
tural movements and all the bitchy
politics of literature, he chose his
friends where he wished. To be sure,
the index to the “Letters” reads like an
American Who’s Who; but few of the


r ,
famous names are among the long-
term correspondents. They number an
expatriate millionaire (and later h.s
widow), a Korean student, a Geylonese
_ ' ’ T • i 1 „
poet, an Irish museum curator, a
Southern judge. Some of his ™st
relaxed and illuminating friendships
were made before (or Without ever)
meeting his correspondent,
From this unshakable centre of
personal self-reliance emanated views
about poetry quite as revolutionary as
those of more flamboyantly avant
garde writers. “The Letters” confirm
what the poems themselves should have
already told us: that the theory and
practice of Wallace Stevens’ verse repre-
sent one of the formidable attempts to
adapt the doctrine of the creative
imagination to the climate and condi-
tions of the modern world.
The starting point of his poetic
thought seems to have been a rupture
with traditional ways of dealing with
two of the great subjects of the
imagination: God and Nature. Of
Pennsylvania Dutch extraction, his
religious upbringing was orthodox, but
he had lost his faith by early manhood.
Suffering no nostalgia for the forms
and doctrines of Protestant Christianity,
he did feel the need for something to
fill the place in his own life (and. that
of other men) that faith had occupied.
Similarly, he had a lifelong passion for
the natural world, but it was utterly
divorced from any sentimentalised
Romamic trad ition. One of Stevens'
nial delights we leam from the
was walking through the
. ’ - * cm ™-i
country sometimes up to 30 miles
r, . L,
m . a , d f' A" ,he r?‘ ks , ;.. n °
undertaken with any spiritual or ethical
J ust f ° r the sake of Particular
sensations, the perception of pattern,
co ° r ’ or ”J’
Ml of Stevens thought and expen-
ence show him to be one of the most
thorough-going relativists of his genera-
don of American writers; yet he knew
the poet’s need to enhance the human
spirit. His solution to his dilemma is
traced through his correspondence,
which is, in part, the record of his
attempt to reinterpret the role of the
imagination, to provide a new theory
of the function of poetry. The theory
started in an acceptance of the “benign
escapism” of verse, went on to a
thorough scrutiny of the relation of
the imagination to the actual, arrived
at the sense of poetry as the “supreme
fiction.” While Stevens denied the
extreme view that the imagination
creates its own reality, he did hold to
the idea that we only live in that ver-
sion of our world that the imagination
has made available to us; to the idea,
as he wrote in 1945, that “we live in
a description of a place and not th
place itself.” Poetry, for Stevens,
vided the sanction for our living
Every competent poem, he believed
introduces order into our lives, and
order means peace. He demanded
therefore, control in both the compo’
sition of verse and its reception. The
impetus, the passion to create must
be there, but by both theory and
temperament Stevens felt it should be
thoroughly refined before any work was
submitted for public approval. “Writing
poetry is a conscious activity,” he main-
tained. “While poems may very well
occur, they had very much better be
caused.”
The correspondence does not argue
a fully developed aesthetic theory any
more than the poems illustrate one. For
one thing, Stevens believed that systems
were inimical to poetry (it was through
their figuration of ideas and abstrac-
tions that they lived). For another, his
letters were only rarely self-conscious
exercises in critical discourse. When
asked, he was prepared to explicate his
poems in considerable detail, but not
to explain them (that was to destroy
them). This big book derives its
cohesion more from the sense of a
single sensibility infused through its
pages than any continuity of philo-
sophic argument. Stevens once wrote of
“the essential gaudiness of poetry”
(p. 263), and a similar quality can be
felt in the best of his letters. The
writer who could describe Albert
Schweitzer as “the man with the ant-
proof organ on the equator where he
plays Bach” clearly has an irrepressibly
idiosyncratic temperament.
It is a temperament at once vividly
pictorial and curiously aloof. Its blend
of dandyism, exoticism, intellectual
sophistication, and earthiness is aptly
figured in Stevens’ delight in receiving
picture postcards from places he had
never seen. It is equally to be felt in
his connoisseur’s pleasure in collecting
paintings and finely made books, his
interest in things and languages Euro-
pean without ever once crossing the
Atlantic. While in his mid-twenties, he
asked the pages of his journal, "May
it be that I am only a New Jersey
Epicure?” The ironic question was self-
deflating, but it suggests a good deal
about the extraordinarily civilised,
erudite, modern consciousness that was
the possession of the mature man.
The value of that consciousness for
Stevens’ personal career can be felt
especially in his handling of his old
age. The young man who attended the
funeral of Stephen Crane lived on into
the atomic era. But the man who re-
jected the Christian God, who felt that
humanism was not enough, who mis-
trusted both science and philosophy,
never once lost his poise and balance.
He w'as lively, alert, interested, to the
very end. The wider significance o
Stevens’ imaginative adjustments is,
course, to be most fully tested in hr
poetry. Nevertheless, this volume ol
“Letters” provides intriguing insight
into the processes of literature.
Chinese official under the Manchus
When we had passed our examinations
We all got drunk
And ran out in the rain bare footed.
Tireless past flooded paddy fields
Our feet carried us
And seemed to run along by themselves.
We laughed and talked about the girls
That we would marry
And the appointments we would take up.
Now the light eats through my cane blind
As I sit writing
In my own damp fragrance, in sun striped darkness.
I am servile to captains of Western steamships
As part of my job,
Read no books and am surly with my wife.
Why did I study and gum up my eyes
And burn my oil lamp
Until dawn-birds stirred in the rice fields?
My bespectacled head sinks on the table
As eight young men
Splashing mud skip through my room like shadows.

Heather McKay
I was astonished to learn (8., May 6)
that the most our squash player
Heather McKay had ever won was four
dollars. This is in such marked con-
trast to the usual sporting story that
I am impelled to ask just what did
Heather get out of it? Surely six years
as world champion must have been
worth rather more than four dollars, or
can it possibly be that Heather plays
for sheer love of the game? The con-
siderable “lolly,” whether in cash or
kind usually associated with other
sporting activities, would appear non-
existent on the squash court. In which
case Lleather is to be commended.

Country galleries
The article under the heading of “Bat-
man’s Melbourne” (8., May 6) on the
art galleries of rural Victoria was most
informative. It would be interesting to
have a comparison with similar devel-
opments in other States. Tamworth in
its Library-Art Gallery has a fine col-
lection of the work of my father, Sir
Will Ashton, which was presented by
Norman Burdekin, of Barraba, and is
splendidly displayed in this modern
building.
Visitors to Toowoomba are also
able to see a unique record of the
skill of Sir Lionel Lindsay in the wide
range of media in which he worked.
Newcastle’s splendid Memorial Gallery,
of course, comes within the category of
a major city.

Dairy farm
In the Bulletin of April 29 you say:
“It has been Government policy in the
past that there should be tiny dairy
farms. This policy has been proved
wrong.” May I ask who has proved it
wrong? Is the implication that because
a subsidy has to be paid the policy is
wrong? What do you call a large dairy
farm or, for that matter, what do you
call a “tiny” dairy farm? What dairy
farmer exists on his income from his
dairy products?
You never mention that dairy farm-
ing is subsidised in other milk-produc-
ing countries. Instead you imply that
our dairy farmers have a bad name
because they receive a subsidy.
The reasons for subsidising farming
of all sorts are very complex and are
world - wide. As one farmer put it,
“What other business sells wholesale
and buys retail?” It would be worth
while having an inquiry into these rea-
sons.

Canada —up there
I particularly want to compliment you
on “Canada: Down Under Up There”
(8., April 22). It shows the many ways
in which our two countries compare,
and it distinguishes very clearly where
the life is not comparable. It set out
well that the problems which confront
Australia are not, in the main, those
that confront Canada. Your article is
fair in its judgment and entirely with-
out bias, which is more than can be
said of most articles in other periodicals
on this continent. Yet it is astonish-
ing but true that Canada has not yet
arrived at a point of harmonising its
cultures, while the voices of conflict,
now muted lest they embarrass Expo
67, will break out anew later on.
Thank you for your excellent article
and for a fine periodical.

Bottom-pinching
Ross Campbell refers to the practice
of “bottom-pinching” (8., April 15) as
unrealistic and says it does not make a
good impression on a young lady. I
cannot let this statement pass without
comment!
Any lady of even moderate attrac-
tiveness who has walked about Rome
will testify to the reality of this practice
and to the fact that it certainly makes
an impression. (Although not always a
comfortable one!)
It has, in fact, always been so com-
monplace in Italy that only recently a
law had to be passed forbidding it.
Although enjoyed and accepted as a
token of admiration by the local lasses,
it tended to have an opposite effect on
foreigners! And at all costs tourists
must be encouraged, even at the cost
of an old Italian tradition.
In Australia I have found a modifi-
cation of this custom is widely practised
in the form of bottom-smacking or
bottom-patting. This seems to be re-
sented rarely —it could have been
accidental, anyway!
MARGARET MURRAY

Last-ditchers
Your urbane, objective summary of the
efforts being made to reinstate Mr
Utzon (8., May 13) will no doubt
convince many of your readers that
this is a lost cause.
I was Registrar to the Board of Archi-
tects of New South Wales at the time
of Utzon’s resignation, and in the centre
of the ensuing controversy, as the
office of the Board was in the N.S.W.
Chapter House of the Institute of Archi-
tects. Ethically, however, as executive
officer to the Board, I refrained from
any involvement until my resignation
last year.
Subsequently, I was enabled to make
inquiries which convinced me that
Utzon’s resignation/dismissal was the
most skilfully contrived coup in this
country’s history. I have been fortunate
enough to meet and become acquainted
with most of the individuals working
so desperately hard to have Mr. Utzon
reinstated and would like to pay tribute
to them.
As far as I am aware there is no
organised group, merely many in-
dividuals concerned not only with the
future of the Sydney Opera House but
with basic concepts of truth and justice.

End of the Affair
As an apathetic university student, I
am not in the habit of writing letters to
editors, but the comments some of your
letter-writers have made on the article
“Britain —End of the Affair” have stung
me.
I wonder whether anybody, white or
Aboriginal, knows how to solve the
problem of integration. While the
Aboriginal people are right in expecting
the rest to respect them as such, and
not as “imitation white men,” how can
they still be both Aboriginal and in-
tegrated. Mrs. Kath Walker is right
when she asks what happens to wine
poured into a stream, but how can
this fate be avoided?
Now, the letter from Catherine Mac-
kerras. A very beguiling thesis, along
the nineteenth-century lines of “philo-
sophy teaching by examples” history.
However, the end result of the Romans
exodus, as against the short-range re-
sult of military insecurity, was a
vigorous Saxon Monarchy. Perhaps this
indicates that the Chinese will invade
us when the British desert South-East
Asia. But then the Ancient Britons
didn’t have “powerful friends.”
