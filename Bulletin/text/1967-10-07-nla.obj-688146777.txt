BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Home bottling
goes down
the drain
NORMALLY Cellarmaster gives you
all the important information on wine-
drinking, but you will appreciate that
this gentleman’s palate was ruined long
since by drinking only superb wines,
beautifully matured Hunters, only the
choicest gifts of the Barossa, and the
best that can be snared away from the
French.
It is high time that an earthy char-
acter like Batman gave you the poor
man’s story. The dreadful truth is that
there is a crisis ahead in home bottling.
Cellarmaster has warned all the year
of the shortage in good wines and now
it has reached us. The bad news is
mentioned in Melbourne’s “Vintage
Club News.” I quote: “It is the low-
priced ‘binning’ wines that worry me.
All the winemakers, who were very glad
to dispose of their wine in bulk to
merchants who bottled it, now in time
of shortage, are beginning to bottle and
market this wine under their own labels
or sell it in bulk to the large national
marketers at extremely low prices.”
This means, fellow winos, that sources
of supply are drying up. Let me
explain. There is little home bottling
in Sydney because the Hunter River
men won’t supply in bulk, but in
Adelaide and Melbourne, where the
local vineyards had plenty, it has been
rife for years.
Indeed, up at the universities, around
Camberwell-Balwyn, the sweet sherry
belt, among the Jimmy Watson frater-
nity, and particularly among doctors,
for some reason, it has been terribly
in. It has been the custom Oh,
let us keep up the tone - to compare
the quality of home binnings on Sun-
day mornings.
High-class home binners own their
barrels, send them off to the vineyard,
and they are returned by rail to the
local railway station, freight un-
believably cheap; the primary producer
is assisted by the Government. After
picking up one’s barrel at the railway
station, one places it on the garage
bench, knocks out the bung, then puts
in a length of 3-Bth-in. plastic tubing,
then sucks furiously to start the siphon-
ing arrangement. This is the lovely
part. Often frequent suckings are re-
quired to get a smooth flow. Then one
puts the tube into bottle after bottle.
Corks are purchased from any cork
merchant cost $3 a gross and a
simple corker costs about $2.50. A
decent French corker made of brass,
which will give a high-speed operation,
costs $lO to $l5.
Now barrels range from little five-
gallon jobs up to splendid hogsheads.
A hogshead should hold 52£ Imperial
gallons and thus provides over 300
bottles. One Melburnian bottling group
which has a hogshead has a beautifully
organised home binning. The hogs-
head is delivered by carrier and placed
on a cradle immediately above the
cellar. A fat nylon tube runs from the
hogshead down into the cellar and then
into a fine old lavatory cistern equipped
with the traditional ball valve. This
turns off the wine as soon as the
lavatory cistern is full of your cabernet
shiraz. From the lavatory cistern there
are two 3-Bth-in. plastic tubes with taps.
So the team bottles two at a time and
winos can get through a hogshead in
just over an hour.
The eternal problem of home binners
is bottles. Some hang around the best
THE ARTS AND ENTERTAIN-
MENT section will, from now on,
be found toward the back of The
Bulletin, next to the book reviews.
A number of readers have suggested
this change as being more con-
venient for those with a particular
interest in these sections.
This week’s section contains a
review-article by Professor Bernard
Smith on Elwyn Lynn’s “Sidney
Nolan Myth and Imagery,” just
published by Macmillan. Mr. Lynn
is art critic of The Bulletin.
restaurants, become very snooty and do
their binning in only the nicest of
French bottles. One home binner who
lives in Holtsville, St. Georges Road,
Toorak, takes her dog for walks in
the early hours on Tuesday mornings
and makes a shrewd check around the
very best St. Georges Road rubbish tins.
Rarely does she come home without an
empty Chateau Lafite or a Chateauneuf
Du Pape ’5B. Alas, not everybody
cares. There is one university profes-
sor who binns in beer bottles with
crown seals. Then there is a gentleman
who has an in with a turpentine fac-
tory and gets his triangular bottles in
marvellous quantities, beautifully steri-
lised and all. But they look odd with
the. sterling silver.
And you must appreciate that home
bottlers feel deeply about their binnings.
Once the wine is in the bottle they feel
as passionately as gentlemen who have
returned from a trip with a crate of
colored slides.
I remember one home bottler who
believed that his product was better
than anything on the wine list at the
Florentino. So he took products of his
home binning to the Florrie for the
evening meal. The regrettable part was
he bottled in beer bottles. “What’s
wrong with a beer bottle? Slam in a
good cork and it does a mighty job.”
However, the wine waiter, as he took
this beer bottle, handled it as if it had
been a mouse found under the table.
Home bottlers, of course, believe
deeply in at least .5 dinners for every-
one. A .5 dinner is half a bottle of
wine with every meal. This varies. Some
go as low as .3 and some as high as
1.5. But this means storage space and
not many of us have the luxury of a
cellar. For this reason it is now almost
impossible to buy old wardrobes in
Melbourne. Open any
old wardrobe and it is solid with bottles.
Many couples have bottles stored under
every bed, others use the woodshed,
some fill their garage with bottles and
keep the car outside. One character
here lives in a house flat on the ground,
but all the floorboards are loose. He-
stacks bottles on the ground under
each floorboard. His'whole house is
floating beautifully on wine.
Others put it in the ceiling. One
home binner, a scientist, was asked:
“But shouldn’t wine be stored so that
there is a variation of no more than
five degrees?” His reply: “You can’t
hurt it as long as you don’t boil the
bloody stuff.”
Let us go into the economics of this
thing. Until now it has been possible
to buy bulk wine of fair quality at
$1.50 a gallon. Corks have cost, say,
two cents each, transport there and
back from the vineyard no more than
10 cents a gallon. You pinch your
bottles for nothing in St. Georges
Road, so that makes roughly 30 cents
a bottle, which is cheaper than beer.
The wine is untaxed, so that many feel
guilty when drinking their home bin-
ning that they are not helping the de-
fence vote and the boys in Vietnam,
but they are helping primary pro-
ducers.
Good heavens, why is this being
written in the present tense? There’s
no good bulk wine around at $1.50.
Even if you know someone it is $l.BO
and in many places, if you can get it,
it may cost $2.80 a gallon.
One well-known wine buyer here
was heard to say at the Royal Show:
“Wine’s getting so scarce at some vine-
yards where I go to buy I’m not even
game to ask if I can have a taste.” As
for wine prices generally, two restau-
rants here are charging $55 for the
1954 Coonawarra, and the cellar in
South Yarra has listed ’3B, ’39, ’4l, ’46,
and ’47 Reynella wines at $lOO a
bottle. (Please don’t buy more than
six at a time!)
Perhaps the good times are on the
way out, perhaps they will still come
back, but just in case they don’t, this
little monograph is dedicated to the
home bottler, in memor) .>f a beautiful
era.

Australia House:
mausoleum
in the Strand
By APRIL HERSEY
Pictures by ROBERT WALKER
BEFORE they built Australia House
in 1912 on a site prudently leased by
the Government of Victoria in 1907
from the London County Council, the
site had been vacant for so long that
wildflowers bloomed in profusion and
were gathered by the children of Lon-
don.
The only flowers in Australia House
now are purchased at Covent Garden
at 5 o’clock every Monday morning by
Australia’s official hostess, Miss Strella
Wilson. She brings them back, spreads
out the tarpaulin on the marble floor,
and gets to work on her arrangements.
She had gladioli and carnations when
I visited her recently. Behind her
most impressive arrangement, close to
her official greeting area, was a paint-
ing, Afterglow (1912), by Frederick
McCubbin, of what looked to be a
group of naked Australian ladies cavort-
ing in the bush.
There are signs that the Common-
wealth Government regards Miss Wil-
son as potentially dangerous. A balus-
trade, which looks a little like a stage,
surrounds her part of Australia House,
perhaps in deference to her past. There
is a gate with a marker, which reads
Strella Wilson, as though she is some
kind of native species. Her glass office
is surrounded by wooden bars and her
door is also carefully marked with her
name. 'She can enclose herself com-
pletely by letting down Venetian blinds.
However, Miss Wilson does not
appear to be at all savage. Though
she does feel strongly enough to say
that if they pull Australia House down
it will be over her dead body. She
took time out from preparing for a
soiree for 900 people who were over-
flowing from South Africa House that
evening to tell me about her fears of
demolition.
“The very thought of their demolish-
ing this for Canberra House is hor-
rible,” she said. (Canberra House is a
new and even larger building closer to
the Embankment.)
“This was built for us and by us.
It is our heritage. Each State has its
own house in the Strand. But we
represent an embassy for our country.
Besides,” she added for some obscure
reason, “it was built originally on silt
from the River Thames.”
She pointed out that three different
kinds of marble had been used in Aus-
tralia House. The grey is from Victoria,
the pink from New South Wales, and
the white from South Australia. Even
the coat of arms is gilded marble.
In actual fact more than 20,000 tons
of marble was brought from Australia
to adorn our house in the Strand. It is
everywhere even on the floors, which
become more radiantly luminous as one

chairs ghsten m the great depths of the
noble hall, and the rather shrunken-
looking Australians sitting in them
reading four-day-old newspapers shiver
in the chill that blows off all that
marble even in the sunniest summer
or years.
People approach the Qantas travel
desk and whisper their requirements or
study the official noticeboard of Aus-
F^., 1 . 3 ouse, wondering about the pos-
sibility of enjoying a trip with the War
Graves’ Commission to a photographic
exhibition at the Imperial War Museum
or the chance of going to see an exhi-
bition of Ceremonial Robes and
Mantles at Arundel Castle. They can
ascend the marble stairs and fill out
forms for the Royal Garden Party,
which is very often oversubscribed,
and write their names in the official
visitors’ book - these simple Austra-
bans from Largs Bay, Launceston,
Pagewood, Perth, and Bronte, to name
a few. Beside the visitors’ book is the
level used by King George V when
laying the foundation stone
preserved for ever by Hardy Bros.,
Sydney.
I have never been in a building which
contains so much air as Australia
House. The distance between the domed
arch above the entry and the ground is
at least as far as the distance from
t^ie Sydney Station and the
platform. A man who had been
sneaking bits of sandwich out of the
well-oiled drawer of his Georgian desk
and sliding’ it shut again thought that
it would be at least 40 feet from the
top of the stairs. He didn’t know if
anyone had ever suicided on to the
marble, but thought it very unlikely
because there was no plaque.
Officially these stairs, which do
actuall run through the whole height of

that artlst Tom Thompson (now,
according to the people at Australia
House, teaching at the National Art
School, Sydney, where his own school-
ing i n art began) had included all sorts
of things, from the Port Kembla steel-
W'orks to men boiling the billy, a chap
playing a gumleaf to Australian
magpies (more correctly Piping
Shrikes if you did not know this). The
boy with the watermelon represents the
holiday spirit. And in the arts mural

“are depicted relics of Australia’s un-
artistic past, consisting of brief views
of old jail buildings which have been
converted to technical colleges and art
schools. In this manner, the artist has
shown how, from an unpromising be-
ginning, Australia has achieved a posi-
tion of eminence in the artistic world.”
All this was done in 1957.
Australia House houses Sir Alec
Downer, who now has another stately
home as well. Then there is the
Deputy High Commissioner and
officials representing many Common-
wealth departments including Air,
Atomic Energy Commission, Army,
Audit, Civil Aviation, CSIRO, Customs
and Excise, Defence, Education, Exter-
nal Affairs, Health, Immigration, Nat-
ional Library, Navy, News and Infor-
mation Bureau (Dept, of Interior),
Postmaster General, Primary Industry,
Public Service Board, Snowy Moun-
tains Hydro Electric Authority, Supply,
Taxation, Trade and Trade Publicity,
and the Treasury.
The majority of clerical workers in
the building are not Australian. As
Miss Wilson pointed out, it is difficult
to keep Australians in England for any
length of time (though she is pretty
permanent) and, of course, the door-
men and porters have to be English to
tell people where to go.
She thinks it is absurd that Australia
House is criticised for not having a
full staff of Australians. There are
so many facilities in the House that no
one should grumble, Miss Wilson feels.
There is a library, Angus and Robert-
son’s have a bookshop, there is an
inquiry desk, reasonably new news-
papers, and the mail can be delivered
at Australia House as a permanent
address. The cafeteria is now public,
which saddens Miss Wilson a bit, be-
cause it used to be like a private dining-
room.
But there is the Boomerang Club,
where the High Commissioner’s wife
and the wives of the Agents-General
receive any Australian woman at 3
p.m. in the Cinema Hall on the last
Wednesday in each month. There is
also the Australian Artists’ Association,
the Australian Musical Association, and
the Society of Australian Writers, and
additionally Australia House seems to
be a jumping-off place for joining the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Vic-
toria League, The Royal Overseas
League, and the English Speaking
Union of the Commonwealth. What
more could anyone ask? Nothing. What
isn’t solid bronze is solid marble.
As I left I noticed that exterior
repairs were being carried out by means
of lowering a small basket by a rope
from the top of the building. Then a
cold thought struck me. Were they
not actually demolishing the building
surreptitiously, basket by basket, marble
chip by marble chip, Australian black
bean splinter by black bean splinter
until nothing is left but the original
river silt, and, if she meant what she
said, the dead body of Miss Wilson?
Perhaps the wildflowers are stirring
again under this mausoleum.

OUT AND
ABOUT
Is it awfully
pretty or
pretty awful?
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THEY ARE KIDDING, of course,
the fashion and beauty writers, about
this Pretty Look for spring. What
women want is something that makes
the most of what they have. What we
are getting is something that makes too
much of what we wish we hadn’t.
The trouble is fashion journalists
cannot see the wood for the trees.
Viewed from their side of the fence,
bloomers and double-decker eyelashes
are not unremarkable. If they don’t
actually wear them in the flesh they
live with them from 9 to 5 in the office
and become immune to their effect.
“Look,” said “Vogue” editor Sheila
Sootter quite seriously pne day last
winter pointing to a hideous pants-dress
on a hanger, “isn’t it super?” A reply
seemed unnecessary.
What “Vogue” does and thinks is
their own business, except that Beauti-
ful People in Beautiful Clothes is
sometimes a bit of a fib, and anyone
who has ever been in fashion knows the
retouching of a model’s misshapen knee
for a photograph is allowed. Not that
this helps the reader much. “Oh, God,”
it used to be in London during a per-
sonal stint in the game, “get her
stomach sliced off quick, and tell Arthur
to lift her chest a bit, too,” and the
picture would return and reproduce as
pleasing to the editor’s eye as any fav-
orite cheesecake.
Sometimes we would turn the whole
thing into a joke. “Would you be seen
dead wearing this?” was a caption for
a revolting number at that moment be-
ing safely worn in America, followed
by a lot of lying copy about the ele-
gance of British twinsets, nowadays re-
ferred to as knits.
Or there might be a bad day when
the fashion column ran alongside a
farming feature by the editor of “The
Muck Shifter and Bulk Handler” and
the cry would go up for something
glam, you know, sexy, old girl. So a
tea-gown would go in, or a bird with
the new no-eyebrow look (there was
such a phase), or a fantastically ex-
pensive negligee followed by the throw-
away suggestion that it would keep
readers’ husbands on the straight and
narrow.

is too far-fetched, but it takes a spell
on the receiving end to see what a
joke it has turned into. Would any girl
in her right mind walk up, say, George
Street, with her knickers round her
knees? That is, vis-a-vis Norma Tullo’s
navy mini-tent with the show-off
bloomers, selling at $2B. Because, if so,
someone should point out that in cer-
tain circles it is still considered a fate
worse than death for this to happen.
Even when bloomers were functional
i.e., during one’s schooldays and
worn to bridge the stocking-gap and
ward off pneumonia, the first thing
every self-respecting girl did when
Mother wasn’t looking was roll them up
out of sight. But whoever ventures up
George Street now in lolly-leg pants
under her fun-cut mini-dress has abso-
lutely had it if she gets, as it were, cold
feet. Lolly-legs are not provided with
elastic. They are designed to dangle.
Admittedly, the mini-skirt has the ad-
vantage over floor-length culottes in
that it does not trail in the dog’s
dinner, but neither are without prob-
lems even for girls with beams that are
not broad or knees that are not hideous.
How can you walk with dignity in a
mini that has ballooned at the seat,
which they all do after five minutes in
a chair the slack must go somewhere
and has turned a 7in. skirt into a
3fin. belt? Equally, why wear culottes
if no one can see they are culottes? To
this end women will no doubt be seen
jumping, leaping, and bounding every-
where this spring, once they have read
and inwardly digested their fashion
captions. Already they are lolling like
men, with knees and legs apart and
causing the normally most unobservant
gentlemen to inquire why females are
sitting in this curious way.
What seems to be the weak point
in fashion journalism today, and the
more extreme make-up and clothes be-
come the more vital it will be, is the
lack of practical advice accompanying
it all. Some guidance alongside the out-
rageous statement that “a black lace
pants-dress is seductive for after-six”
like: How To Stand In The Damn’d
Thing Without Feeling Foolish might
help. (The memory of the one and only
entrance last winter in black velvet
pants-suit still rankles. Like clothed
visitors to a nudist camp, no one knew
where to put his eyes.)
If paisley tights are vital for the new
Total Paisley Look, someone should say
buy shoes a size bigger or your feet
will hurt like hell, and boy! will you
get hot in all this gear. And false eye-
lashes are femme fatale, but don’t cook
in them because the heat makes them
torture and you’ll cry and the mascara
will run and then you’ll be a mess.
Even better, however, would be re-
assurance for all those women who
thought they had good dress sense and
who don’t want to go around like
hung-over escapees from the nursery
that the whole thing was a printer’s
error. What they really mean is this
Spring’s Look is Pretty Awful.

Value for money
THE PASSION for the amateur
hangs on in Australia. There has been
a fair amount of protest because, under
New South Wales’ new National Parks
Bill, control of 1 some historic sites,
Vaucluse House among them, will pass
from Trustees to the Lands Department.
It would be hard to find many
champions for the present control of La
Perouse and Captain Cook’s Landing
Place, Kurnell. We were out there
recently. The Bare Island Fort
Museum, admission 20 cents, includes
in its exhibits a series of color pic-
tures of historical houses, supplied free
by a petrol company. At Kurnell they
have recently built a quite elaborate
museum, admission 20 cents, with at
least 90 percent of the exhibits on loan
from the Mitchell and Dixson Gal-
leries and the Australian Museum,
where, of course, you can see everything
for nothing.
Fit of pique
THE VICTORIAN Railways has
started a drive to encourage the citizens
to travel by train in off-peak hours. For
some reason the Commissioners are dis-
satisfied with the name “off peak” and
they have offered $lOO for another
name. Could we suggest “off pique”?
The first cricket of spring
ALONG WITH THE FIRST cuckoo,
cricket books pour on to the market
again. The most indefatigable of all
cricket writers is R. S. Whitington. He
has written eleven. His latest “Simp-
son’s Safari” is up to standard. We like
it particularly because he has quoted
a marvellous piece of verse by Alan
Ross:
What do I care if sciatica comes,
Elephantiasis calls?
I bowled three bloody curates once
With three consecutive balls.
Mr. Whitington hastens to add that
one of the curates was not the Reverend
David Sheppard.
Odd survival
LARGE ADVERTISEMENTS have
been appearing in newspapers recently
summoning support for British,
Japanese, and other Asian shipping
lines in the Far East shipping con-
ference against the intrusion of some
British lines into their territory. How-
ever, a reader recently came up against
that odd survival whereby preference is
given in coastal water first to Aus-
tralian ships, then to British.
It is still necessary to get a permit
from the Department of Transport and
Shipping to travel by “foreign” ships,
and this will not be given if an Aus-
tralian or a British ship can take the
passenger to his destination within three
days of planned departure date. This
applies equally to cargo. The permit
costs $2. Fees go into Consolidated
Revenue. Most are borne by the ship-
ping company, not the passenger, and
when a large number of passengers is
involved the $2. doesn’t amount to
much.
If European shipping companies
coming here are alert, a condition of
Britain’s entry into the Common
Market could be that this second pref-
erence is dropped; then Australians
might have a better chance of travel-
ling interstate when and how they
choose.

home in the kitchen. One could see
why. On the walls were photographs,
paintings and a beautiful Egyptian

the stove were lilac, because lilac is her
favorite color at the moment and be-
cause she cannot bear to cook on a
stove that looks like a stove.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OK
THE
ECONOMY
How conferences
cope with
shipping wars
FROM THE LOOK of the full-page
advertisements, the big shipping war
is a pretty serious thing; a matter of
principle, with the whole conference
system imperilled by the three British
shipping companies who have com-
bined to “crash” the trade between
Australia and the East. If this were
so, the shipping war would not simply
be a matter for shippers, but one for
Australia as a whole. For the bulk
of Australia’s exports are shipped out
in conference line ships. No matter
what its imperfections (and there are
plenty) the conference system guaran-
tees a regular and adequate service,
and Australia’s exports depend on that.
Most of the conference publicity con-
centrates on the bad results that would
follow from unbridled competition,
which would result in the service dis-
appearing, as each line would be fight-
ing to secure the most profitable cargo
at the expense of equally important but
less profitable items. Without the or-
ganisation and system of the confer-
ence, low profit and off-peak services
would suffer. And there is no doubt
that the newcomers are only picking
the cream of the business; their lists
of ports to be serviced in their forward
schedules (which go through to 1968)
are only the “volume” ones. They say
that others are available “on induce-
ment.”
But are these the real issues? Is the
shipping war really what the nine-
member Australia Northbound Confer-
ence claims it to be? Like the marga-
rine that the same advertising agency
made famous with Mrs. Jones, the ar-
gument in these advertisements is
spread a little thin at times. The Atlas
Line (formed by the three outsiders)
has so far not replied to it; their ad-
vertising is on the more mundane
level of letting shippers know what its
service is and when it goes. It looks
as if, at this stage of the campaign,
Atlas intends to do its fighting on the
water.
For the war does not seem to be a
matter of principle at all, but one of
simple self-interest. If there is a
threat to the conference system, it is
one that this conference can very
simply avoid. The Atlas men are not
trying to break it up—they are just
trying to break in.
The reality is that the Atlas people
are so attracted to the idea of con-
ferences (they are in a few themselves,
such as England-Australia) that they
are doing their damnedest to get into
this one. The reason for their decision
to compete with the Northbound Nine
is simply to try to force an entry into
the conference; once into this club
they will no doubt behave with the
same propriety as they do in the other
clubs they belong to. The Atlas people
say that there is nothing unusual in
what they are doing; two members of
the present conference joined it within
the last two years, and had traded in
competition before they were admitted.
The reason the Atlas people are now
trying to get into the rapidly increasing
Japan trade is that the British-Austra-
lian trade is clearly in a downtrend
that could accelerate if Britain goes
into the Common Market. So the
three lines in the Atlas group applied to
join the Australian Northbound Ship-
ping Conference. They were knocked
back. For now that Northbound’s nine
members have got the trade sewn up,
they want to keep it that way and to
get all the benefits of its future growth.
It is true that the conference is
on firm ground in saying that within
itself the conference is highly competi-
tive and has developed the Eastern trade
to make it stable and efficient. The con-
ference has done a pretty good job.
There is also no doubt that the con-
ference has been providing a pretty
good service with 120 sailings a year.
But there is also no doubt that the
trade is expanding very fast indeed;
they have introduced 14 new vessels in
the last two years, yet there is only
about 15 percent vacant space at
present. They plan to put on more
ships.
But the conference people are using
this 15 percent “over-tonnaged” figure
to prove that there is no room for a
newcomer group in the conference.
This applies in particular to refriger-
ated cargo capacity, for the Atlas lines
are adding about 800,000 cubic feet
of refrigerated space, which just about
doubles existing capacity, while another
116,000 cubic feet is soon to be added
by the conference. And the conference
claim that the present annual use of
refrigerated space on the Japanese
northbound trade amounts to only
450,000 cubic feet and is expanding
at an annual rate of only five percent.
But there is every indication that
the trade is growing at a far faster rate
than the conference will admit, particu-
larly to Japan. It should not be long
before the 15 percent slack is taken up.
And with average luck it will not be
long before the five ships of the Atlas
group will be needed to cope with the
demand, if things go on the way they
have. So a gradual admission of the
three Atlas line members to cope with
the increasing demand over coming
years may be a realistic thing to do.
Anyway, the conference rejected the
three outright. This, then, is the reason
for this confrontation of the giants.
And they are giants, despite the modest
sounding names of many of the part-
ners, which are in fact subsidiaries of
some of the world’s biggest shipping
companies.
This is big business. The value of the
conference line fleet is about $lOO mil-
lion. But even if this whole matter is
more one of self-interest than principle,
there are serious general implications
for the shipping business arising out of
the war itself.
One of them is for the coming intro-
duction of container ships to our over-
seas trade. For two big British con-
tainer ship groups that had intended to
share facilities in Australia in an im-
portant cost-saving arrangement have
now fallen out because of the Atlas line
dispute. For the three members of one
of the container groups, Associated
Containers Transportation, are the
three shipping companies that are now
bucking the Northbound conference—
which includes members of the other
container group, Overseas Containers
Ltd.
Probably more important is the way
the Japanese have responded to the
Atlas incursion. For the Japanese are
strong supporters of conferences and
had accepted the rejection of a fourth
Japanese line recently without protest.
They now threaten to reply to Atlas
by competing with (and undercutting)
its three members on other routes, even
if this means competing with other con-
ferences. This could well threaten the
conference system. But it seems an ex-
treme thing to do.
In any event, the rights and wrongs
of this don’t matter to us; what .does
matter is how well we come out of it.
So far, the war has brought cheaper
freights and looks like bringing even
further freight reductions. While these
are welcome, what we clearly want is a
regular and reliable shipping service in
which some of the less profitable routes
are, in effect, subsidised a little by the
more rewarding ones and that sug-
gests that we need a conference.
But we also need plenty of competi-
tion, which has a remarkable ability to
keep freight rates down. Too often
there is the impression that conferences
become too clubby; that there is little
incentive to become more efficient if
all that is needed is for the club to pre-
sent their united front to a shipper and
demand a freight rate rise. So let them
fight this one out. Provided the confer-
ence system survives, the longer they
fight, the better it will be for us.

AS I SEE IT
Holt bravely
grasps the
Senate nettle
By ALAN REID
CONTRADICTORY characteristics
exist in the persGuiality of Prime
Minister Mr. Harold Holt. On the
one hand, he has an incorrigibly cheer-
ful Micawber - like optimism about
some event turning up to help him out
of difficulties. On the other hand, he
has the courage to grasp a nettle with-
out too much shilly-shallying.
Last week he grasped a nettle. He
could have dithered about for some
months yet before he made his decision
on when to hold Senate elections and
waited until after something had turned
up to help him before making his de-
cision.
Instead he grasped the nettle. He
announced that Senate elections would
be held on Saturday, November 25.
The late Dr. Evatt once said of unity
tickets and association with Communists
and Communism by ALP members that
this produced “a running sore that
might one day destroy the Labor
Party.” In my view the Senate is a
similar type of running sore that may
one day destroy the Holt Liberal-
Country Party coalition.
As the experience of the Scullin
Labor Government between 1929 and
1931 shows clearly, a hostile Senate that
is prepared to use its numbers against
the authority of the House of Repre-
sentatives can erode quite effectively the
public image of a Government.
It is always a dangerous position for
a Government when the impression
starts to percolate through the elector-
ate that it has lost control of the
Parliament.
At the moment the Senate is going
very quietly. The recent gymnastics
of the Labor Party over the increased
postal charges and the Budget have
temporarily discredited the Upper
Chamber. As the two DLP Senators—
Gair (Qld.) and McManus (Vic.) -—-
have pointed out with considerable
bitterness, there has been a strong
element of phoniness to Labor’s opposi-
tion both to the postal increases and
to the Budget. Twice Labor combined
with the DLP Senators and Senator
Turnbull (Ind., Tas.) to reject the in-
creased postal charges.
Labor later at considerable public
expense forced the re-convening of the
Senate during a parliamentary recess
to disallow with a great fanfare
of publicity trumpets the regula-
tions that would have allowed the Gov-
ernment to impose some of the in-
creased post office charges pending the
introduction of the Budget.
But when the “crunch” came and
Labor had to put up and face the pros-
pect of an election and possibly a double
dissolution, or shut up and fold their
tents like Arabs, they fled as fast ' as
they could pack their camels.
But the Senate’s period of quietness
is likely to be of short duration. Not
only is a section of the Labor Party
determined to use the Senate to thwart
the House of Representatives but there
is a Liberal Senate element with a most
inflated view of the role of the Senate.
These Liberals, electorally safe owing to
their position on Senate tickets, appear
more determined to preserve the status
of the Senate vis-a-vis the House of
Representatives than the Government
they were elected to support.
For Holt it is terribly important that
he regain a majority in the Senate.
But to achieve that he has the job in
front of him, and it is a very tough
job.
Without the assistance given by a
general campaign as happens when the
House of Representatives and the
Senate elections are held simul-
taneously, he has to carry five of the
six States to get a Senate majority.
The present position is that there are
in the Senate 28 Government support-
ers, 28 ALP supporters, the two DLP
Senators, and two Independents. One of
the Independents, Senator Clive Hanna-
ford (S.A.), a former Liberal who broke
with his Party over Vietnam, is not
Senator V. C. Gair
standing for re-election. The other Inde-
pendent, Turnbull, who has the unpre-
dictability that seems to be the hallmark
of so many Tasmanian Senators, is
standing.
Retiring at this election in addition
to the two Independents are 14 Gov-
ernment supporters and 14 ALP Sena-
tors.
If the Senate comes back with the
Government still in a minority a not
unlikely happening Holt is in for
a torrid time. Not only will those
Labor Members who want to use the
Senate increasingly to thwart his
Government be emboldened but so also
will be the Liberal element that wants
to build up the authority of the Sen-
ate at the expense of the House of
Representatives.
If the elections have gone against
the Government, the Senate will be less
sensitive to threats of a double disso-
lution, as its components will be aware
that no Government likes forcing an
election (or can persuade its followers
into accepting an election earlier than
the absolutely essential date) until it
is demonstrably clear that it is at the
crest of a political wave and not in a
trough.
These are not the least of Holt’s
troubles. When he originally formed
his Ministry he boldly announced they
were all on trial including himself and
indicated that there could be substan-
tial Ministerial changes after the Senate
election.
There will have to be some changes.
For example, the present Leader of the
Senate, Senator Denham Henty, who
as Supply Minister is in the inner Cabi-
net, is pulling out. Holt will need a
replacement Senate Leader (Education
Minister John Gorton appears a cer-
tainty) as well as another Cabinet
Minister. But Holt has to face up to
which Ministers, if any, he is going
to fire and from where he is going to
get his replacements. •
Holt also has State problems. When
Henty goes, Tasmania does not have a
representative in the Ministry. Person-
ally I do not see that this matters
much. As it is, the Government only
holds two of the five Tasmanian House
of Representatives seats. It is not going
to win any just because it puts a Tas-
manian into the Ministry. It is difficult
to see it losing either of the two seats
it now holds if it does not put a Tas-
manian into the Ministry.
But the Government does not view
things with quite that harsh political
realism. It wants to adhere to the tradi-
tion that all States get representation
in the Ministry irrespective of the
quality, good or bad, that the State
can provide.
Holt has now grasped the nettle of
the Senate elections. It is going to be
interesting to see whether he can pull
off the political coup of securing a Gov-
ernment majority in that Chamber, or
is left with its festering stings even more
deeply and hurtfully embedded into the
quivering flesh of his Coalition Admini-
stration.

Capricornia: Does the Right
know what its Left will do?
By ALAN REID
DOUGLAS EVERINGHAM, 44, the
doctor from Rockhampton who won
the Capricornia by-election at the
weekend, is the first unmistakable
Labor Left-winger to enter the House
of Representatives since immediately
after the great Labor split of 1955.
Arthur Calwell, who was whole-
heartedly in the Left-wing Labor
camp during his last couple of years
as Labor’s Federal Parliamentary
leader, could not get a Left-winger
into the Parliament. In fact, during his
regime not only did he fail to get
Left-wingers into the House of Repre-
sentatives but a number of Left-
wingers already there lost their seats
and the Left Wing virtually gave away
the attempt to get their more out-
spoken sympathisers into the Lower
Flouse. They concentrated upon secur-
ing places for themselves and their
allies on Labor Senate tickets, where
they were voted for as part of a ticket
and not as individuals.
The irony is that Everingham got
into the House of Representatives
under Right-wing auspices. Opposition
Leader Gough Whitlam (who won the
right of succession to Arthur Calwell
on Right-wing support) and Dr. Rex
Patterson (another Right-winger, who
won Dawson - from the Country Party
on the platform of northern develop-
ment) were Everingham’s main elec-
toral supporters. They campaigned for
him unceasingly even though he holds
views which they"not only reject per-
sonally but believe are unacceptable to
the general Australian voting public. If
Everingham ... the Right Wing helped
they had publicly indicated in any way
that Everingham’s views were not their
views, Everingham’s path to the House
of Representatives would have been
tougher.
Whitlam had quietly tried to get an-
other candidate. Patterson, who acted as
the liaison officer between the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party and Capri-
cornia, was known to be unenthusiastic.
But publicly they presented the appear-
ance of men who were dedicated to
the cause of ensuring that Everingham
took over the seat of Capricornia in
succession to the late George Gray, a
Labor Right-winger.
The Left Wing now could very well
use the respectable gloss that Whitlam
is currently giving to ALP policies to
get a greater number of Left-wing sym-
pathisers into the Parliament. Previously,
fearing that Labor Right-wingers might
not campaign for their candidates, they
have been careful to select seeming
moderates. In Victoria, for example, they
selected Scholes for Corio, Noel Beaton
for Bendigo, and Captain Sam Benson
for Batman. Scholes and Beaton were
the selection of a Left-wing Executive,
but they do not themselves qualify for
the label. Benson was selected because
the Victorian ALP Executive worked
out that unless Right-wingers cam-
paigned for the Labor candidate Labor
could not win the Batman seat- —a judg-
ment that was confirmed when Benson,
disgusted with the Left-wing attitudes
of the Victorian ALP Executive, left the
Labor Party and successfully held the
Batman seat as an Independent.
Whitlam may be counting upon the
gratitude of those he helps into the
Parliament. But gratitude is notoriously
short-lived in politics. It may help in a
personal clash but not when disagree-
ments are ideological. Yet, basically,
Whitlam could still be right in his
assessment that, unless Labor secures
candidates whose views are closer to his
own than to the Left Wing’s, Labor
cannot hope to secure Government even
though it may win by-elections. Ever-
ingham’s vote was only a bit up on the
vote secured by the late George Gray
at the 1966 elections. Given the pattern
of voting over by-elections for many
years, that the Government loses —'and
Labor gains—about five percent of the
vote, the Capricornia vote was not a
good one for Labor.
The VIP parade
Mr. Sato next
Sato ... next very important visitor
WITH FOREIGN Heads of State and
Prime Ministers arriving every few
weeks, the ceremonial and hospitality
branch of the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment is working overtime these days.
It has been Saragat-Fanfani and
Holyoake in quick succession. Next
week the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr.
Eisaku Sato, is arriving. At the end
of the month Laotian Prime Minister
Prince Souvanna Phouma will come.
Sato is no doubt the most important
visitor, even if his' visit itself is of no
great immediate significance. He will
arrive here after having visited Burma,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Laos,
and Indonesia. After us he goes on to
New Zealand, the Philippines, and
South Vietnam. This grand tour of
Asia is a manifestation of Japan’s in-
creasingly active foreign policy, a shift
away from what they used to describe
as their “low posture” into a more
assertive stance.
In format the visit is of the standard
ceremonial-goodwill variety: a day in
Canberra, discussions with Ministers, a
parliamentary luncheon, a tour around
the lake, a Press conference, drinks
with the G.-G., plus a day each in Mel-
bourne and Sydney with mayoral
receptions ana visits to the small, local
Japanese communities.
Altogether there is only -75 minutes
set aside for serious discussions—ls
minutes with the Prime Minister pri-
vately, and the rest with the Cabinet.
Mr. Sato’s English is not particularly
good, so a good deal of this time will
be taken up with translations. It can
be assumed that the Australian Govern-
ment will be most interested in hearing
Mr. Sato’s impressions from his Asian
tour and in getting some of the nuances
of the new Japanese foreign policy.


Airlines
Qantas: the end of an era
FOR QANTAS the halcyon years are
over. It is now in a new and tougher
era from the times when Qantas was
able to swim against the tide of world
aviation, reporting big profits while
other international operators were los-
ing heavily. This new era at Qantas has
nothing to do with the fact that Bert
Ritchie has taken over from Cedric
Turner, or that Roland Wilson sits in
the chairman’s seat instead of Hudson
Fysh. Nor has it anything to do with
last year’s disastrous 28 day pilots’
strike, which cost the company about
$7 million in cash and a fair amount
in goodwill. It is just that Qantas is
now beginning to feel the full weight
of world competition from which it had
previously been partially protected by
circumstances that are changing.
Not that this special position was the
only reason Qantas has done so well;
its management had made some right
decisions when many other airlines
made wrong ones. It avoided the 1961
world-wide pitfall of over-expanding;
it became “efficient” in terms of getting
into jet aircraft earlier than most of
its rivals. And not that all the Qantas
“mystique” of being an efficient airline
has gone; for instance, its good accident
record means that it gets the best in-
surance rates available and it is re-
garded as a good borrower. But its
scope for being just that much ahead
of its rivals has been whittled away.
It no longer has any equipment advan-
tages, as its rivals have all caught up.
But, more important, it faces increasing
competition in its home base of flights
into and out of Australia and it has
come to the end of the downward move-
ment in operating costs that emerged
from the introduction of the big Boeing
jets.
It is true that last year’s Qantas
result, a loss of sl|- million, and its
worst ever, was due to the strike. But
prospects of a “satisfactory” profit this
year are “not encouraging,” according
to the new Qantas chairman, Sir
Roland Wilson, in last week’s annual
report, and this gloomy forecast has
nothing to do with the pilots’ strike.
(Qantas says that although traffic was
slow to recover from the strike and
remained sluggish early in the current
year to March 1968, there are well-
founded expectations of improved
growth in the later months).
In its earlier years, Qantas got access
to other countries by granting recipro-
cal rights to land in Australia. For-
tunately many of them did not want
to at the time and did not exercise
that right, in effect giving Qantas
something for nothing. But more and
more of them are doing so—and there
are more that could soon decide to.
So airline competition out of Australia
Sir Roland Wilson...
really hotted up last year. Air-India
added a second weekly service; BOAC
became the sixth airline linking Aus-
tralia with North America with three
services a week, and added a second
weekly service to Hong Kong;
Malaysia-Singapore Airways inaugu-
rated a thrice-weekly service to Aus-
tralia; Pan American increased its Los
Angeles service from four to seven a
week and added Noumea as a stopping
place; South African Airways extended
its service to Sydney and put on a jet.
And other airlines are keen to come
here or increase their frequencies.
But while the competition grew
tougher the business it was competing
for slowed down; passenger traffic car-
ried on scheduled international air
services into and out of Australia last
year rose at the slowest rate for many
years, increasing by only 10 percent
or less than half the 22 percent rise of
1965.
This increasing competition is most
evident on the Pacific route to North
America (and it will become more
significant next year when the U.S.
Civil Aeronautics Board licenses
another American operator to compete
with Pan American in this area). For
in the five years since 1962, while
Qantas has increased its flights from
seven to nine a week, rival airlines have
almost trebled their flights from five to
14. And there are now five rivals
flying the Pacific instead of three. So
while Pacific flights have jumped from
12 to 23 a week, Qantas’ proportion
of them has fallen from almost 60
percent to below 40 percent. And this
almost doubling of flights (using con-
siderably larger aircraft) has taken
place while the traffic has barely
doubled, so the business is not only
more competitive but there are more
empty seats per flight. (For example,
it has only taken a 52 percent rise in
the number of transtasman flights to
accommodate a 100 percent rise in
passenger traffic in the last five years.)
Rising competition is not quite so
striking on the Kangaroo route to
London, where Qantas has increased its
flights from six to 10 while rivals have
gone from 10 to 14. And across the
Tasman Qantas’ flights have risen
from 12 to 20 while others have gone
up from 19 to 27.
So Qantas’ revenue load factor (the
proportion of capacity that is occupied
R. J. Ritchie... not their fault
by paying customers or freight) has
fallen for the last two years and now,
at 50.7 percent, compares none too
favorably with most of the other big
international airlines (Qantas is in the
“big 10”). Only three years ago its load
factor was 54.8 percent. To some
extent this is because air freight is not
keeping pac6 with the increased
capacity to carry it in the big new
Boeings Qantas is buying; Qantas has
a much better revenue seat factor at
55.8 percent than it has a total load
factor. But this too has fallen in the
last two years.
On top of this, there have been some
significant reductions in excursion
fares. Its chairman says that lower fare
levels will require “a substantial in-
crease in seat factors” if Qantas is to
achieve “reasonable profitability.” And
there seems little doubt that the fare
structure over the Pacific, already re-
duced for excursion travel, will be
further reduced sooner or later follow-
ing last week’s rumblings by the Ameri-
cans, who allege that Qantas are keep-
ing fares higher than is reasonable,
particularly on the Fiji-Honolulu hop.
(The Qantas reply is that right across
the Pacific fares are no greater than
fares on other routes.) Unless the for-
eign competition calms down a bit,
and there are no signs of its doing so,
there are few indications that Qantas
will get the “substantial increase in
seat factors” it needs.
All this is happening at a time when
operating costs, which had been falling


for ten years, are at last showing signs
of rising again. The cost economy of
Qantas’ switch to big jets has now
passed its peak; until the next equip-
ment change (jumbo jets, probably)
there is more likely to be a steady rise
in airline operating costs than a fall.
This was not properly reflected in
last week’s Qantas accounts, for the rise
in costs per capacity ton mile flown to
24.2 cents in 1966-67 was due to the
effects of the pilots’ strike. Otherwise,
the airline says, operating costs would
have been fractionally lower, at 22.4
cents, than the previous year’s 22.6
cents. But this year there seems every
chance that costs will rise naturally.
This will mean the end (strike years
excluded) of a ten-year run of falling
service costs per capacity ton mile
flown (down by one-third from 33.3
cents in 1957).
Of course Qantas will get some fur-
ther economies when its 13 bigger
Boeing 707-338 cs that are still on order
join the eight at present in the fleet and
replace the 12 smaller Boeings that are
to be sold. But these savings will prob-
ably not offset the other costs that are
certainly on the way up; labor, legal
liability, and landing charges are all
getting dearer, as are fuel costs (the
Suez closure is adding about million
a year to Qantas’ fuel bill).
“Another factor contributing to our
current cost levels is low air-crew pro-
ductivity, which is restricting fleet
utilisation,” says chairman Sir Roland
Wilson. Air crews are producing fewer
flying hours than in earlier years, but
the new contract that pilots recently
agreed with Qantas does have some
financial encouragements for them to
fly more. “Higher utilisation of our
aircraft will be one of the main objec-
tives in a drive for improved effici-
ency,” the annual report says.
As the Government points out in its
latest Civil Aviation report, Qantas has
had only a small favorable margin
between net gain and loss on its total
operations each year; even its record
profit of $4.1 million in 1964-65 repre-
sented only 3f percent on revenue. In
coming years it is going to be increas-
ingly difficult to hold that margin.
The bomb and us
Not ticking over
THE GOVERNMENT doesn’t seem
to be very interested in the question
of nuclear proliferation. Last week
when External Affairs Minister Has-
luck was asked in the House of Rep-
resentatives whether he could make
available to members copies of a pre-
liminary draft of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty he said that there
was no definitive draft available. Yet
there is.
A draft was in fact agreed on by
Hasluck.... no moves
the American and Russian delega-
tions on August 24, and it formed
the basis for a possible breakthrough
in the three-year-old discussions at the
Geneva disarmament talks. Mr. Has-
luck’s department had copies, of course,
and these were being made available
to inquirers. The department con-
sidered it important enough to include
in the forthcoming issue of its monthly
publication “Current Notes.”
But the Government has evidently
made no moves to formulate any
policy. The head of the Department
of External Affairs, Sir James Plimsoll,
speaking at the United Nations last
year, did express enthusiasm for the
general idea, but there has obviously
been little consideration of the five-
week-old Russo-American proposal.
Defence specialists at the Australian
National University point out that in
its present form the treaty is extremely
weak. It provides for no safeguards
whatever and there is little likelihood
of any being agreed to. And there is
nothing in the draft to prevent a sig-
natory from advancing most of the
way to acquire bombs, by openly
constructing the raw materials, plant,
and manufacturing components. Within
the terms of the treaty a signatory
could place itself in a position to as-
semble and test bombs within months
of applying the escape clause in the
treaty which allows members to
actually go nuclear, when their “su-
preme interests” are jeopardised.
Mr. Hasluck will probably be en-
couraged to find that his neglect of
the draft will not matter very much.
For it seems that other potential
nuclear powers—lndia, Brazil; Sweden,
and Japan—are likely to lodge many
objections. The final treaty may still
not be hammered out this time next
year, so the Government has time to
apply itself to the issue.
Aborigines
A late leao forward
THE VICTORIAN GOVERN-
MENT’S new plans for the reorgan-
isation of Aboriginal administration
read like a combination of South Aus-
tralian practice, the recommendations
of the New South Wales Joint Commit-
tee on Aboriginal Affairs, and the Bill
which the Victorian Labor Party has
been trying to introduce into the Lower
House for some time.
There has been general surprise—on
the part of the Opposition astonish-
ment—that an administration which has
always shown itself most interested in
developing its natural resources and
balancing its accounts should have come
up with a comprehensive and imagina-
tive program. As the director of the
Aboriginal Advancement League put it:
“We put three propositions before the
Government last May, the firsit two
dealt with the reform of the Aboriginal
Welfare Board and the third referred
to the possibility of a Ministry and
Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but
. . j f, r- . . ,
we concentrated on the first two be-
j., , , . ,
cause we did not expect the third to
have much chance of being accepted.
The Victorian Government’s plan, as
announced by the Minister for Housing,
Mr. Meagher, is to abolish the present
Aboriginal Welfare Board (behind
which the Government has been able
to hide for years) and establish a De-
partment of Aboriginal Affairs under a
Minister. In place of the present Board
there will be an Advisory Council, con-
sisting largely of Aborigines from the
various regions of Victoria. It is likely
that the number of permanent specialist
staff, such as social workers and welfare
officers, will be increased substantially,
Al } decisions on policy will finally rest
with the Minister.
. The only likely source of dissatisfac-
tion in the near future is the problem
Aboriginal reserves. Like the New
South Wales Joint Committee, Mr.
Meagher and some of his Cabinet col-
leagues regard these reserves as a bar-
to assimilation. The Labor Oppo-
sition > some members of the Aboriginal
Welfare Board, a number of specialist
so . cial workers, and a lot of Aborigines
®till want the reserves. As the Deputy
Labor Leader, Mr. Wilkes, said last
week: Aborigines in Victoria have
.° . ,
very strong emotional attachments to
the ' reserve “ at Frawlingham and Lake
Tyers . Housing in urban l ocat i ons wi U
meet the needs of some Aborigines, but
others need the security and training-
that can be found on a reserve.”


Canberra
Parliament's double doing-over
THE GOVERNMENT and the Oppo-
sition last week both yielded ground
on contentious political issues in the
heat of action in the House of Repre-
sentatives. But the Opposition, which
walked into a trap baited by its own
leader, Gough Whitlam, is likely to
pay the dearer price.
The Government let itself in for
some trouble when quietly spoken, be-
spectacled Bill Arthur, the Liberal
Member for Dr. Evatt’s old seat of
Barton, asked Prime Minister Holt, “In
view of the quite distorted picture being
publicly presented of the operation of
the VIP Flight,” would he consider
making a statement to the House to
open the way for a debate on the
issue?
When he said, “Yes,” Holt’s reply
took everyone by surprise, but in retro-
spect it could have been expected. It
was made in the knowledge that Labor
Senate Leader Lionel Murphy had
already broadcast his intention to move
in the Senate that very day a motion
that all accounts and papers relating to
the use of VIP aircraft during the
period from January 1 to September 27
be tabled.
The DLP, which holds the balance of
power in the Senate, is not recognised
when it comes to using VIP aircraft,
and therefore on this question was not
likely to support the Government. Holt
realised that it was better to carry the
debate into the Plouse of Representa-
tives, where he has overwhelming num-
bers. He is still likely to suffer a defeat
in the Senate, but by then the steam
could have gone off the pot.
Plolt believes there is general sup-
port for his view that VIP aircraft
are essential for modern-day operations
and that the biggest business in the
nation should have this facility. And
he knows that the Opposition are go-
ing to find the debate hard going, as
their new “with it” leader, Gough Whit-
lam, believes in using VIP aircraft for
every purpose.
On the second issue, Labor finds it-
self confronted with a situation in which
many members believe their leader
Gough Whitlam has rashly given the
Government its major election issue—
Labor’s involvement with Communism.
It all began when the Opposition re-
fused Liberal W. C. Wentworth per-
mission to table photostats of petitions
to the Hong Kong Government signed
by ALP executive members. In Ques-
tion Time last Wednesday, Whitlam
promoted the argument that Labor did
not grant permission because it was
not sought by a Minister. Then, goaded
by the Leader of the House, Mr. Sned-
den, Whitlam walked into the trap.
“How soon will he (Snedden) arrange
for a Minister to take the responsibility
to seek leave to table documents and
to make a statement upon them so that
a debate can take place on that state-
ment and on the documents by respon-
sible persons on either side of the
House?” Whitlam angrily demanded.
Snedden was quick to seize his oppor-
tunity “When? The answer is, next
week,” he told an obviously flushed
and angry Whitlam. Within an hour
Government officers were circulating in-
formation that - the debate would take
place on Thursday, October 5. The
stage has been set for what the Govern-
ment will try to turn into the most
vital issue of the looming Senate elec-
tions.
Horse racing
The VRC isn't
on a winner
QUITE DEFINITE answers can be
given to some of the proposals submit-
ted last week to the Bolte Government
by the State’s chief racing authority,
the Victoria Racing Club.
Proposal 1: That midweek racing
be reintroduced on metropolitan
courses.
Answer: No. Or in the words of
the Premier: “Twelve years ago the
Government decided to develop coun-
try racing instead of midweek metro-
politan meetings. We believe that this
policy has been highly successful and
that no change is warranted. For the
good of racing it is bad to have mid-
week metropolitan meetings because a
poorer type of horse would be racing
in them.” As another thought he added:
“In the old days midweek city meet-
ings were supposed to have caused
absenteeism from work.”
Proposal 2: A solid reduction in the
taxation load on the racing industry.
Answer: No hope. The State Cabinet
likes racing, but it is short of money;
and it likes money better.
Proposal 3: That the Victoria Racing
Club and the Moonee Valley Racing
Club unite.
Answer: Not at present. The Moonee
Valley Racing Club owns a great deal
of property, including its own race-
course, and has capital reserves of a
million dollars or more. The VRC
receives more from the TAB disburse-
ments. Last year the ratio was $492,000
to $387,000, but the costs of the VRC
are higher in terms of course upkeep,
administration, and stakes. The VRC
has smaller capital reserves and the
MVRC is not likely to agree to a
merger quickly or until the terms are
in its favor. So far the VRC has not
VRC chairman, Sir Ross Grey Smith
been able to construct an appealing
offer.
Over the past few years there has
been some rationalising of the country
courses, but it is unlikely that another
VRG proposal for the abolition of some
country courses close to the city will
receive a much better hearing than
the first three proposals. A number
of country clubs within two hours’ driv-
ing time of the city have begun or
completed expensive improvements to
their tracks, stands, and facilities. The
construction of such monuments is a
firm barrier to economic administration
of country racing.
But the president of the Victorian
Trainers’ Association, and one of the
most successful Australian trainers of
the past 50 years, Des Judd, who
doesn’t care very much about a VRC-
MVRC merger and realises the taxa-
tion claim is a lost cause, was speaking
for the industry generally when he com-
mented last week that “there are too-
many country courses in and around
Melbourne and too many in Victoria.
Too much money has been spent on
them, especially those close to the
city.”
For trainers, owners, jockeys, book-
makers, horses, and punters, the country
set-up seems absurd. Two or three or
four days in the week they set out
from Melbourne, steer through the
suburbs, and hit the highways for
Ballarat, or Bendigo, or Seymour, or
Cranbourne, or Geelong, or Moe, or
somewhere else. They rarely stop at
towns on the way; they rarely spend
any money or time in the town staging
the races. Yet somehow their presence
is supposed to be beneficial to country
life. It is not even of much benefit
to country racing since only a small
proportion of the horses and their
stables come from around the district
conducting the race meeting.
The only people to benefit from the
present set-up are the few locals who
attend country races, the city-based
horse-float firms, and city-bred picnic-
makers who like horses as a background
to the midweek vacuum flask and ham
sandwiches.

Tariff protection
Set an example
Dr. Coombs... for discrimination
IN HIS TALK to the Australian In-
dustries Development Association in
Melbourne last week Dr. H. C. Coombs,
Governor of the Reserve Bank, not
only called for a more discriminatory
tariff system but also came close to
saying that the general level of pro-
tection should be lowered. The simple
point in the latter respect was that it
would be in our best interests to set a
good example to the great markets of
the world, say in the U.S. and Europe,
which should open their doors to the
products of the newly emerging Asian
countries.
Dr. Coombs linked all this with his
general theme that we were presently
close to the optimum in offsetting the
costs of spreading capital formation
thinly over the economic structure by
the benefits of a reasonably rapid popu-
lation growth. He warned against push-
ing the reliance too far, against over-
strain. The implication for protective
policies was that the generality of our
protection, which had served us well up
to this, should now be put on a more
discriminatory basis. Further we should
always remember that when the
economy is fully employed, a subsidy
or a tariff in one area of industry re-
duced spending power or raised costs
in others.
He seemed to be envisaging future
industrial development here on the
lines of a limited “Common Market”
covering a selected number of products
and couldn’t see why this should be
thought sinful in the eyes of the com-
mercial councils of the world which
saw every virtue in Common Markets
that covered everything. Such a limited
“Common Market” might be a device
but he wondered whether it was not
worth fighting for.
Behind this wondering were the stark
probabilities that our entrepreneurial
work skills, as well as our numbers,
would continue to be inadequate to pro-
cess development on the fullest scale.
It was the same with capital. This
meant that Australian industries would
have to reorient their objectives less to
serving local-consumption markets and
more to the production of capital goods
and exports. It will pay us to concen-
trate on the latter, Dr. Coombs said,
with an eye to achieving economies of
scale and not to try to do a little of
everything. It was not a question of
there being a case for no protection,
but rather one for more discrimination
in the use of protection.
Papuans
W. Irian slaughter
“AS A WHOLE this Territory is not a
fertile country and its potentialities are
handicapped by an unhealthy climate,
its impossible terrain, and lack of
labor.” So writes the “Pacific Islands
Yearbook,” accurately describing West
Irian and posing the problem facing
Indonesia in this, the newest and least
promising, part of her island empire.
Her most important natural re-
source, exploited by Dutch and
Indonesians alike, has been the Papuans
themselves, but they have resisted dom-
ination ever since their first contacts
with Malay civilisation back in the
14th century.
Since 1962, when the Dutch moved
out and 15,000 Indonesian soldiers
moved in, this resistance appears to
have built up steadily. The trouble has
been on the coast, and the particular
storm centre the Vogelkop Peninsula, in
the far north-west, which has a long
history of Dutch settlement. As far
back as 1965 there were reports of a
rebellion at Ransiki, in which several
hundred Papuans were killed. Earlier
this year 2000 were claimed to have
been killed at nearby Manokwari. Last
week new reports claimed 3600 killed.
Indonesian spokesmen do not deny
that there has been trouble. A number
of “refugees,” motivated by both politics
and economics, have crossed to our
side of the border in recent years. In
April, Colonel Marwoto, Director-
General for West Irian, accused us of
harboring members of a subversive
political group, the Free Papua Organ-
isation, in Port Moresby.
Given the comparative affluence of
the eastern half of New Guinea and the
comparatively generous resources avail-
able for allocation by Australia, some
resentment is inevitable. Predictably, it
has been strongest among the coastal
elite, whom the Dutch led to accept the
idea of succeeding to self-government.
But the real questions posed for Aus-
tralia by the latest reports lie in the
future, if a substantial number of West
Irianese take the 1969 plebiscite at its
face value, or the achievement of in-
dependence by Papua-New Guinea leads
nationalists on both sides of the border
to join forces against Indonesian hege-
mony in West Irian.


HONG KONG
DOOMED?
By PATRICIA MORGAN
Daubs on Queen Victoria’s statue, Hong Kong ... “Down with imperialists"
THIS IS THE TIME in Hong Kong
when the crisp north-east monsoon sets
in after the oppressive humidity of
summer; the sea hawks dip, soar, and
glide about The Peak; fleets of giant
fishing junks sweep slowly back and
forth toward Macao or the China Sea.
And at night in the bays and inlets
the lights of crowding small craft, life-
long homes to many of the fisherfolk,
come on and stay on until dawn.
Chinese children run their kites; bird-
watchers take to the steep, green slopes
of Victoria and the woods of the New
Territories; cricketers limber up at the
Cricket Club’s nets in the shadow of
the communist Bank of China across
the street, and hopefuls for the
approaching racing season are put
through their paces at Happy Valley
racecourse.
That’s the normal, serene October
picture in the little Colony with its
foot on the doorstep of China. And
despite the greatest upsurge of terrorism
in its stormy history, the picture is
broadly unchanged today. As an old
Far East hand said recently, “There’s
tension, of course, plenty of it. But
the Des Voeux Road regulars aren’t
spilling their coffee.”
That comment says a good deal more,
and carries much more weight, than
it seems to. Indeed, it’s an opinion that
it won’t be too long before the terror
in Hong Kong subsides; that normalcy
or something approaching it will re-
turn; that Hong Kong and China, now
clutching its own pain-racked belly,
will again take up their marriage of
economic convenience. And it’s a
shrewd opinion.
For Des Voeux Road is in the
Colony’s Wall Street district where
bearded, armed Sikhs stand guard at
every turn against hit-and-snatch
thieves. It is a place of banks of all
nations; of princely merchant houses;
of gold and jade shops so numerous
they seem to jostle each other for
business. And the regulars in its smart
coffee lounges and bars are wealthy
captains of big, long-established com-
merce and industry. By custom, they
meet here twice daily, mid-morning
and mid-afternoon, to talk shop, negoti-
ate deals over coffee and cigars. All of
them are taipans of great substance
and substance is more substantial and
plentiful in Hong Kong than in most
places. A tip from them is a sure thing.
Europeans, Asians, Eurasians, they rep-
resent what makes the Hong Kong
dynamo hum money.
Some frightened money has taken
flight, as it has before in time of un-
certainty—jittery Hong Kong million-
aires were involved in a group which
once tried to take over Broken Hill
South. Considerable Chinese wealth has
taken shelter in Australia and in Swiss
and American banks. And huge finan-
cial empires, like the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank Group, are already
diversified throughout the woxld; the
Group’s proud claim is that its day
never ends—from Tangier to Tokyo,
New York to Nagoya, San Francisco
to Sydney, there is always a branch


Gurkha soldiers on duty at the border Britain knows it could never defend
that is open for business. But for those
with all their eggs in the Flong Kong
basket, in the thriving factories, and in
land and building that have yielded
them enormous fortunes—a few years
ago the owners of vast, mushrooming
skyscrapers could reckon on getting
their capital back in four years—there
is only Chinese fatalism to comfort
them. They have always known that
Hong Kong lives on borrowed time;
that it exists because Peking needs the
benefits it gamers from the quite
classical example ©f laissez-faire capi-
talism and Communism in its extrernest
form facing each other across the Shum-
chun River.
There are solid grounds for Hong
Kong’s view that her end is not yet,
or near at hand. China is beset by
internal strife. There has been civil
violence in almost every province. And
externally she has few' friends.
To China Hong Kong has always
been like an angry boil in its rump,
but rather than excise it it has chosen
to abide the pain. And for weighty
reasons. Last year Hong Kong was
China’s best customer. China received
around £l7O million more thdn she
spent in the Colony and as w ? ell derived
another £BO million from banking and
retailing interests in Hong Kong. Also
to be taken into account is the heavy
aggregate of remittances which Hong
Kong Chinese customarily make to their
families across the border.
In all, China benefits by some £250
million from its transactions in Hong
Kong about half its total receipts
from foreign business. Without that
money China w'ould be hard-pressed to
pay for its huge, vitally necessary im-
ports of grain from Australia and
Canada.
There are other reasons why Flong
Kong suits China’s book. The Bank of
China is a good deal more than a
financial institution. As Peking’s direct
agent it disseminates propaganda in
such diverse areas as communications
media, commerce, and trade unions.
And the great, 16-storey building which
tops by two storeys the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Bank, doyen of Far East-
ern finance houses, is the centre of a
vast complex of communist activities,
among them emporiums, including
“The Chairman’s Stores,” communist
bookshops, and the China Travel
Agency, which handles all travel to
the mainland.
China, of course, is paying a price
for what it gets from Hong Kong. The
People’s Republic has to accept the
humiliating situation of foreign tenancy
of Chinese soil. Under the Treaty of
Nanking of 1842 and the Convention
of Peking of 1860, Britain holds Vic-
toria Island and the city of Kowloon
in perpetuity, and the New Territories,
where much of the Colony’s expanding
industry is located, on a 99-year lease
which expires in 1997. China has often
said that the status quo will be
observed but only until China is
ready to abrogate the treaties.
Though the lease of the New Terri-
tories runs out in 30 years, many in
Hong Kong do not doubt that China
will terminate it before then. They con-
sider that the Chinese economy will
prosper to such an extent, and quickly
enough, for China to support loss of
the huge trade surplus it presently
enjoys.
4 here are others in Hong Kong who
disagree with the rationalists’ view that
Hong Kong will return to normalcy
within a reasonable time. They point
out that China in the past has not
always acted logically; that the Maoists,
for example, have put militancy in their
cultural revolution above economic con-
siderations; that it is pointless to apply
rational thinking to the cultural mad-
ness that has riven China.
A number of theories are held on
the real source of the terror in Hong
Kong which first flamed in mid-May.
A Hong Kong official of high standing
said, ‘"I don’t consider, as some others
do, that Peking was the instigator of
the troubles. It’s possible that one of
the groups jockeying for power was
involved. Possibly it all began with
some young Leftists in Hong Kong
who want to ingratiate themselves with
a particular group. There is no clear
pattern of evolution. On the con-
trary, it’s been highly confusing.”
Whatever the true story behind the
Hong Kong terror, this is certain: it
has underscored the fact that a sizable
number of resident Chinese are dis-
contented under the British Adminis-
tration, even though they prefer it to
the austerity of Maoism. It is a fact
that many lowly paid Hong Kong
Chinese regard Britain as a rapacious
landlord bent on fleecing his tenant.
The facts don’t accord strictly with
that picture. Hong Kong is virtually
self-supporting. The exception is
external defence, based on an 8500-
strong garrison to which the British
taxpayers contribute £l6 million
annually. (In reality the garrison is
only a sort of border “police force” for
Britain knows it could never defend
Hong Kong against China, and that
the Americans won’t.) For its own
police force of 10,000 Chinese, British-
officered and trained on Army lines,
Hong Kong foots the bill entirely.
Britain has a trade deficit with the
Colony. Last year it bought more than
£BO million worth of goods from Hong
Kong, and sold back £65 million
worth. It is true, nevertheless, that
although Hong Kong represents a drain
on the British Government’s balance of


payments, the value of the Colony’s
trade to private British interests is
great. And there is the greater lure
of immense trade possibilities with a
country of 700 million people, when
China is able and ready to open the
doors wide. Australia, France, and
Canada have their eyes on this plum,
too —already China is Australia’s fifth-
best customer.
One of the most constant talking-
points of Hong Kong Leftists who com-
plain that the Colony is geared eco-
nomically to suit the European is the
£125 million reserves held in London,
money which they argue should be used
in Hong Kong for housing, welfare, and
education. The official viewpoint is
that it is proper and prudent practice
to keep the reserves abroad, that Lon-
don is a natural repository for a ster-
ling bloc country, and that when
Hong Kong eventually reverts to main-
land authority the money will pass to
it. i
There are plenty of other areas on
which local Chinese look with jaun-
diced eyes, notably the high salary scale
of expatriate civil servants and the
generous leave provisions they enjoy.
In contrast, Chinese factory workers
have a seven-day week Sunday rest
is at their own expense and most
of them are lucky. if they can afford
five days off work a year. There is a
big gap between the mass of Hong
Kong’s 4,000,000 citizens, 98 percent
of them Chinese, and the autocratic
Government, paternal toward Euro-
peans, administered by Europeans, and
answerable to no elective body.
In the past, Hong Kong Chinese
have seldom protested very vigorously
against “preference for Europeans,” re-
garding life in British Hong Kong as
preferable to that across the river. But
today Hong Kong, particularly its over-
whelmingly young population about
half the population is under 15 has
been infected by the militancy spilling
over it from Kwangtung Province. The
older Chinese felt they had escaped
when they took the capitalist road to
the sanctuary of Hong Kong. The pre-
sent generation of locally born Chinese
have no such sense of gratitude. On the
contrary, they are rebelling against their
lowly position in a community where
wealth and poverty are both tremend-
ous, and a middle class does not exist.
Not all the kicks are against Euro-
pean exploitation. The worst exploiters
are affluent Chinese factory-owners.
Some factory employees have to sup-
port a family, never small, on around
SAII a week.
Dissatisfaction with the administra-
tion there is, but it is equally true, in
the Hong Kong paradox, that a good
proportion of the Chinese residents are
content with their lot. They know that
the end of the road for Hong Kong is
not independence, as it has been with
other British colonies, but domination
by China. These realists are not envious
of highly paid British expatriates and
wealthy Chinese. They are more con-
cerned with immediate, practical con-
siderations a flat with a toilet and
shower, rather than a sleep cubicle
rented on a time basis and with crude,
shared toilet facilities.
European-biased though the Adminis-
tration may be, it can point to big
items on the credit side of the ledger.
What has been achieved in an area of
less than 400 square miles, with no raw
materials and a bursting population, is
astounding. Hong Kong is bristling with
housing and resettlement estates. In
April this year 1,100,000 were living in
Government housing - not far short of
a third of the population. In an uphill
fight to remove slums, officials have
wiped out some of the worst black
spots, though the ones remaining are
still appalling by the standards of most
countries. In the wretched tenements of
Wanchai the density of residents has
been cut from around 1000 an acre in
1961 to some 600.
Elsewhere, too, vast housing projects
are easing slum congestion. One of
them, the Wah Fu Estate at Aberdeen,
over The Peak from harborside Vic-
toria, has encouraged many of the
Tanka water people to live ashore after
a history of thousands of years of birth,
life, and death aboard their durable
junks.
Since the resettlement program began
in 1954, the Government has resettled
more than 900,000 people, most of them
squatters on land required for develop-
ment. Before the problem was tackled
in earnest, tens of thousands of refugees
were herded wherever they could find
space. They lived in humpies made of
flattened-out tins, oddments of timber,
fabrics. As many as 80 persons shared
a kitchen, a water tap, and a lavatory.
The picture today is not all brightness,
but it is much more cheerful.
Spectacular results have been achieved
also in other fields. In ten years the
number of beds in hospitals and clinics
has increased from 5270 to 13,370. In
that period new outpatient clinics,
some mobile, some floating, were
opened each year. But attendances,
which in 1965 numbered no fewer than
7,000,000, continue to overtax facilities.
The Government is still campaigning
vigorously against tuberculosis, though
it is still the worst killer among dis-
eases.
Hong Kong is the world’s biggest
exporter of cotton textiles and gar-
ments produced in some 1100 factories
occupying 40 percent of the labor force.
Output continues to rise. The shipyards,
the electronics and plastics factories are
always busy. Fisheries co-operatives
flourish. In junks equipped with diesel
engines fishermen are able to range as
far as Borneo for catches of fish which,
along with rice, are Hong Kong’s staple
diet. And most importantly, from a
revenue point of view, tourism is boom-
ing. At least, it was until the terror
burst.
The (tourist industry is the Colony’s
second-biggest money-earner. In a
decade the number of visitors has
jumped from 50,000 annually to nearly
500,000. The appeal of Hong Kong
has been especially strong for Ameri-
cans, and lately, too, for Australian
holiday-makers. In recent years the
number of Australian visitors has in-
creased by 20 percent annually. Last
year the total was 28,000, and in the
first half of this year 17,500. To some
rich Australians Hong Kong is the only
acceptable holiday place in the “East.”
Many of those who visit Hong Kong-
take in a trip to its main “suburb,”
Macao, 40 miles away on the mouth
of the Pearl River, outlet by water for
Canton. So, too, do many Hong Kong
residents with time and money
to spare. In the early months of this
year the average number of trippers by
11 hydrofoils and four steamers to the
impoverished little Portuguese enclave
was about 9000. But lately, in conse-
quence of Macao’s and Hong Kong’s
troubles with communist China, there
has been little activity at the casinos*
fan-tan tables and bee-eeg and see-malt
dice games, and around the hungree
tigers, or one-armed bandits. The sellers
of vice, too, are having a lean time.
But a new line has been added to
the gold, dope, and refugees which in
normal times have been the stock-in-
trade of those who run Macao’s most
lucrative industry smuggling. In
pre-terror days huge quantities of
freshly killed pork, which all Chinese
find irresistible, reached Hong Kong-
regularly, mainly by rail from Kwang-
tung. But when the unrest halted this
flow of porkers, as well as fresh vege-
tables and fish, Hong Kong food mer-
chants turned to Macao for supplies.
There one Chinese firm had a virtual
monopoly of the trade, and it objected
strongly when others muscled in. And
so Macao water police, who formerly
screened Hong Kong-bound junks for
more intrinsically valuable cargo, were
alerted to look and listen for pork on
the hoof.
Bullfights and Grand Prix racing
notwithstanding, the show Macao puts
on for visitors is no match for the
bigger spectacular across the water.
Hong Kong is a place of the exotic and
the average, where every whim may be
satisfied; of vice in high places and in
low; of private mansions and humpies;
of glittering nightclubs and sleazy bars;
of palatial hotels and flop-joints; sleek
yachts, power cruisers, and humble
walla wallas; of Mercedes-Benz taxis,
and rickshaws pulled by emaciated
heroin addicts; of liar dice in exclusive
clubs and mah-jong in slums where the
massed clashes of thousands of moving
pieces resound the night long; of
typhoons and tranquil days; of superb
foods and annual newspaper warnings
to Europeans to lock up their dogs be-
cause the Chinese dog-eating festival is
at hand.
It is the last of the Somerset
Maugham colonies, a way of life
doomed to vanish.

SARAGAT
IN
AUSTRALIA
THE TWO-DAY VISIT of President
Saragat of Italy to Canberra was not
all public oratory and ceremony. Until
two hours before the Parliamentary
luncheon there was still doubt about
whether the Immigration and Settle-
ment Agreement would be signed.
The junior Italian Minister, Senator
Olira, who arrived some days before
the Presidential party, was unable to
reach a satisfactory compromise with
Immigration Minister Snedden and his
officers and it was left to Foreign
Minister Fanfani, accompanying the
President, to clear things up. But the
agreement, as signed, leaves a number
of rrjatters open and Fanfani, speaking
to journalists, made it clear that Italy
wants more concessions before it will
be satisfied.
The visit otherwise showed once
more that Canberra’s capacity for cere-
monial dignity is not large.
The National Capital Development
Commission had managed to rush
through the completion of a new road
diversion project a few days beforehand,
so that, unlike President Johnson, the
Saragat motorcade did not have to
meander around the end of the air-
port to find a narrow nineteenth-cen-
tury wooden bridge across a trickle of
water called Woolshed Creek before
setting off for the city.
It was a; beautiful, sunny, still Can-
berra day, but the mid-afternoon arrival
had none of the drama of the Johnson
plane landing in the rich colors of a
summer sunset. Officialdom, however,
compensated by staging its own little
drama as the President stepped from his
plane. Newspaper photographers, both
Australian and Italian, as if armed
with hand-grenades to kill the Presi-
dent, were dragged and carried
away by airbase security guards, egged
on by a red-faced official.
In protest they downed cameras
when the President was leaving and
stood with their hands behind their
backs.
The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, wel-
coming the President at the official
Parliamentary luncheon, made one of
his immemorable speeches, and was
followed by the Leader of the Oppo-
sition, Mr. Whitlam, who sparkled by
comparison with thoughtful, witty
references to the role of Italians in
Australian history, and reflections on
his Party’s close connections with
Italians, putting some life into what
was otherwise a dull occasion. He
brought broad smiles of satisfaction to
President Saragat’s face when he got
to the heart or the Italian President’s
message to the Australian people:
Italy is now a “powerful, prosperous,
progressive nation” and Australia can-
not take Italian migration for granted.
President Saragat didn’t sparkle in
his speech to Australian Parliamen-
tarians, but he really opened out later
in the afternoon. Talking to local
Italians building workers, timber-
cutters, and businessmen and their
families who packed a Taglietti-
designed hall and spilled out into the
parking area alongside, he gave a
masterly demonstration of Latin
oratory. His hands and fingers worked
hard in gesticulation as he developed
a series of climactical passages which
drew roars from the crowd.
He talked of the new Italy, proud,
vital, such that no longer was there a
need for any of its countrymen to feel
any compulsion to emigrate. He praised
Italians in Australia as people who had
won a reputation for industry and
vitality and thanked them for the way
they had represented their country.
Sometimes they might think their old
country had forgotten them. It had
not. It was determined that they should
get a fair deal. He wanted settlers
in Australia to be as free to return
to their homeland as Italians who had
gone to North America. He would like
to see the cost of return fares lower.
With the Australian Cabinet, Foreign
Minister Fanfani talked Vietnam and
by all accounts he put the familiar
European line which includes the view
that the Communists in that country
have popular support. Members of the
Australian Cabinet just listened. None
of them was in the teach-in mood.
IF THERE was a discordant note in
the visit of President Saragat to Mel-
bourne it was provided by the Italian
President himself. He sounded it when
few old Australians were there to hear,
in an address to more than 20,00(>
people of Italian birth or descent at
the St. Kilda cricket ground.
“Italy,” he said, “has sympathy for
the allied cause in Vietnam, but firmly
believes that political moves should be
made to solve the conflict. Limits must
be put on the escalation of the war so
that a more relaxed atmosphere may
be created. The solution to the Vietnam
situation must be reached through
negotiations along the principles out-
lined in the Geneva Treaty.”
President Saragat added that his-
Government had urged both the United
States and Australia to limit their mili-
tary involvement.
Speaking out
on Vietnam
The remarks were delivered with the
utmost courtesy, but some officials pre-
sent were surprised that the President
had entered into a debate central to
the direction of Australian foreign and
military policy during a manifestly
successful goodwill tour. Some saw the
hand of the grey eminence of Italian
politics, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Professor Fanfani, as the in-
fluence behind the President’s words.
For the rest President Saragat showed
every sign of warmth and enjoy-
ment. He shook the hands of all the
right people and kissed numerous others
in the best international style. He told
the Italian community that he was here
to testify to the affection and care that.
Italy felt for them, and brought tears
to the eyes of his listeners. “Yours,” he
said, “is a beneficial patriotism. The
spirit of a civilisation which integrates
with another, making both more human
and complete.
President Saragat with Prime Minister Holt


“For Italians, Australia will continue
to hold the fascinating attraction which
this land of pioneers has always had
for courageous men.”
Victorian Premier Sir Henry Bolte
was rqoved in turn to present the
President with 50 toy koalas, and
Australia’s largest Italian community
responded with flags, bouquets, and fre-
quent cries of “Viva l’ltalia.”
After the celebrations it is perhaps a
bit churlish to mention that at least
two Government officials referred to
the “Eye-talian community” in their
speeches of welcome and another more
senior gentleman had a lot of trouble
with the President’s name. Perhaps a
bit more could have been expected
from a city which according to the
editor of the Italian daily “II Resto
del Carlino” had given the Italian
leader “the best and most memorable
welcome, including the President’s
tours of Canada and the United
States.”
Welcome: Italian
style
OPPOSITE Woolworths, decked out
with bristling outsize waratahs, the Syd-
ney Town Hall boasted a parabola of
red, yellow, and green (“The tallest of
its kind in the world,” according to the
organisers of President Saragat’s visit).
Inside the gloomy vestibule, hung with
its vast central chandelier, flanked with
commemoration plaques to coronations
and dead aldermen, the atmosphere was
pure business luncheon: only three
women visible, and nearly everyone
dressed in sombre suits, cheerlessly drink-
ing off trestle tables, while nervous
Italian TV crews, and cameramen from
Italian magazines with their film packed
round their waists in cartridge belts,
jumpily awaited the President’s arrival.
He entered the vestibule 15 minutes
late, looking uncomfortable and smiling
rather embarrassedly at the solid grey
cohorts on either side. The tight deter-
mined line of the mouth is offset by
President Saragat
soft eyes behind spectacles: a scholar’s
face, reminding one that Saragat has
published books on Marxism. On the
dais flanked with flowers, Lord Mayor
John Armstrong read a welcome speech
from what appeared to be a blotting
pad, and Saragat perceptibly bright-
ened. But he read the speech of reply
with a surprising lack of expression off
what appeared to be parchment, the
handwritten copy inscribed in an elab-
orate and perfect copperplate. The
speech had one neat idea, a reference to
the fact that Marconi had once sent a
message to Europe from the Town Hall,
but in other respects was like all such
speeches everywhere.
Later, after a triumphal progress
through Leichhardt and the unveiling of
a plaque at the new Fiat factory, Sara-
gat looked at the Opera House from the
deck of the Achille Lauro. Holt, Whit-
lam, and Renshaw, Italian and Aus-
tralian business chiefs made a sea of
dark grey against the blue harbor. Down
in the galley, the chef, Antonio Bonaldo,
spoke of the food ordered for the State
luncheon: 40 kilos of salmon, eight
kilos 'of caviar, 14 kilos of liver, 70 kilos
of jewfish, 70 kilos of capons, and 150
litres of alcohol.
In the ship’s dining-room, with its
black pillars, pale green carpet, and
banks of carnations in the Italian colors,
everyone ate solidly until well after 4
p.m.: After the caviar and the fish and
the chicken and the Vesuvius cake
flambe, fruit and coffee were still
arriving at 4.50 p.m.
Only one moment of Australian scep-
ticism intruded into the formal gas-
tronomic proceedings: as Holt announ-
ced, before making a brief one, “I
don’t wish to make a substantial speech,”
applause was heard from a part of the
dining-room where journalists were
gathered.
Next day, after a harbor tour, the
President arrived at the Town Hall for
his official meeting with the Italian
community. Boys in Apia football gear,
banners, and posters, and outside huge
screens flickering greyly as the Presi-
dent’s face was conveyed to the crowd.
Inside the cavernous auditorium, under
gigantic signs bearing the legend of
greeting, the crowd sweated in fierce
heat, under a battery of arcs and flanked
on either side by heraldic signs repre-
senting the Italian States. A flutter of
programs used as fans, blaze of mar-
tial music from the gallery, and a massed
choir singing the two countries’ anthems;
this time Saragat seemed far more re-
laxed and assured, raising and letting
fall his hands in almost pontifical
fashion, his animated speech interrupted
by bursts of applause. This occasion was
wholly Italian: no translation read out,
everyone in the audience talking his
native language, and outside the harsh
faces of the poor old women in black
dresses, and a charged intense flavor
entirely different from that of an Aus-
tralian crowd.

AUSTRALIA NIBBLES AT TURKEY
AS A POSTSCRIPT to her book on
modern Turkey, “Welcome the Way-
farer ” Sydney ’ writer Nancy Phelan
tells ’ of approaching the Sydney office
of the Immigration Department on her
return to arrange for the migration to
Australia of three or four of the in-
telligent, friendly people she had met
on hei trave s. _
“Turks are not accepted as migrants
in Australia,” the young man behind
the counter told her.
Mrs. Phelan outlined some of the
qualities of Turks she had met which,
she knew, would make them splendid
migrants.
“I’m sure you’re right,” said the Im-
migration clerk, “but they’re Asiatics.”
By now Mrs. Phelan was somewhat
indignant. “ ‘Asiatics?’ I said. ‘Are you
joking? The people of Anatolia live
in Asia, but they’re no more Asiatics
than I am. And what about the people
who live in Thrace ... the people of
Istanbul? They’re not even geographi-
tally Asiatics, they’re Europeans, like
Yugoslavs and Hungarians and Czechs.’
“The clerk shrugged.
“‘Well, that’s how it is,’ he said.
‘The White Australia Policy, you know.’
“I was so stunned that I could not
believe my ears.
“ ‘The White Australia Policy,’ I said
at last, S is aimed at people whose skins
are not the same color as ours, isn’t
it? Brown people, yellow people, black
people? Where do you think the Turks
come into those categories?’
“He looked a little sheepish,
“ ‘Oh, well . . . they re pretty dark,
Y°u (^ now - tip
and even t h e darkest are no darker than
u >
“He i au ghed, slightly embarrassed,
“‘Well,’ he said, ‘l’m a Greek my-
self’.”
About the same time that this little
comedy was being played out in Syd-
ney, Immigration officials in Canberra
were making the first exploratory in-
quiries on the possibilities of Turkish
migration to Australia on an extensive
scale.
The Turkish response, apparently,
has been quite overwhelming. The
Turkish Ambassador, Mr. B. V. Kara-
tay, has said that Turkey could become
an “unlimited source of migrants or
Austral,a; 500,000 a year has been sug-
g«ted as a possibility a figure which
must have stunned he managers of
Commonwealth Hostels.
The Immigration Department would,
no doubt, find 500,000 a year an em-
barrassment of riches. The Depart-
ment’s initially acceptable figure tor
Turks would be about the same intake
The jumble of ferries at Galata, Istanbul. From the water, Istanbul can look
like Sydney; only the mosques mark the difference
as Australia has had of Greeks in
recent years. For the year 1965-66 this
was 16,029.
The Minister for Immigration, Mr.
Snedden, visited Turkey in July during
his shopping trip for migrants through
Europe. Interest in Turkey roughly fol-
lowed a decline in the Greek Govern-
ment’s attitude to migration of Greeks
to Australia. The Greek Government is
much less enthusiastic about migration
than it was, but then some Greeks are
not very enthusiastic about their present
Government. Migration figures from
Greece may remain relatively high, be-
cause the Greek Government, although
it may restrict Australia’s efforts at
canvassing for migrants in Greece, is
unlikely to restrict migration altogether,
particularly now when many Greeks are
returning from a no longer so prosper-
ous Germany.
Immigration Department officials
have been having talks during the
past week in Canberra with Turkish
officials, including the Ambassador and
some of his staff, and Mr. N. Tezel,
director-general of the Turkish Govern-
ment Employment Service, and Mr. Z.
Bensan, a senior official of the Turkish
Ministry for Foreign Affairs, both of
whom came from Ankara for the talks.
Indications are that an agreement
will be signed quite soon, possibly this
year, and that assisted Turkish migrants
are likely to begin arriving next year.
Turkey opened an embassy in Can-
berra this year and Australia is about
to open, an embassy in Ankara, after,
it seems, other members of Cabinet had
persuaded the Minister for External
Affairs, Mr. Hasluck, to give this some
priority.
Turkey, with a population of 33 mil-
lion and a population increase of
750,000 a year, is obviously an excellent
source of immigrants. So far only a
trickle has come, between 50 and 200
a year, and most of these have been
Turkish Cypriots with British passports.
Under the special assisted passages pro-
gram introduced last year, Turks work-
ing in Common Market countries have
been able to apply for assisted passages
to Australia.
About 250,000 Turks are now in
Germany as “guest workers” (migrants
who can stay only two years), but
otherwise Turks have never migrated
on a large scale.
Despite a high rate of economic
growth, seven percent last year, Turkey
still has a good deal of unemployment.
More important is underemployment in
the large farming sector. This is one
reason why the Turkish Government is
happy about emigration. Another is
that it can be an excellent source of
foreign exchange. One hundred million
dollars a year has been remitted to
Turkey by its “guest workers” in Ger-
many, a very handy sum for a country


with export earnings of hardly $5OO
million.
Turkey, after the ascendancy of
Kemal Ataturk in 1923, was a pioneer
of modernisation, but later fell very
much behind. Perhaps the window on
the world provided by large-scale migra-
tion will become a factor in accelerat-
ing development, as membership of
NATO and massive American aid have
been.
Mr. Karatay has said he expects
about 40 percent of the Turkish work-
ers who may come to Australia to be
qualified tradesmen, with the rest un-
skilled workers. He has also said he
will not press for Australia to accept
Turkish trade and professional quali-
fications.
Apart from the disadvantage of com-
ing to a country which rigorously ex-
cludes Asians but doesn’t really know
what is an Asian, what special diffi-
culties will there be for Turks in Aus-
tralia?
A spokesman for the embassy in Can-
berra said that the scarcity of mosques
was not likely to trouble the average
Turk. “We’re not all that strict in
religious observance,” she said. “We
don’t take it as seriously as the Arabs,
you know.”
Australia has mosques in Canberra,
Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and
Perth, but in Sydney only an Islamic
Centre where people can pray, although
it is not formally a mosque.
Since the time of Kemal Ataturk,
Turkey has used the Latin alphabet,
which might give them an edge over
Greeks in learning English, and the
metric system. Beyond the basic lan-
guage, Turkish has incorporated a large
number of English and French words,
simply giving them phonetic spelling.
Otomobil is car; vapur, steamer; and
istasyon, station.
Their food and wine, notably dol-
mas, kebab, and retsina, are very much
like the Greeks’, so if they are prepared
to break bread with their traditional
enemies here on the other side of the
world there should be no great diffi-
culty.
Turks coming here may find some
superficial political similarities. At pre-
sent Turkey is ruled by the Right-wing
Justice Party with the Left-wing (al-
though it is not very Left) Republican
Party split and in disarray. Since the
military coup of 1960, after which the
Prime Minister, Adnan Menderes, was
executed, the country has been politi-
cally fairly stable with, since the elec-
tion of 1965, the Justice Party, led by
Mr. Suleyman Demeril, in an unassail-
able position.
Rebels within the Republican Party
are now trying to win support for a
left-of-centre position. However, the
London “Economist” recently was de-
ploring the true Toryism of the Turkish
peasants, who refuse to trust the party
whose policies seem to be most actively
concerned with their welfare.
One matter which is unlikely to
worry young Turks coming to Australia
is national service. A Turkish journalist,
Neomi Onur, recently here, said: “We
are not afraid to fight. You know that.”
But Australians, mostly with their
sole idea of Turkey (apart from the
jokey Turkish Delight, and ladies’ night
in a Turkish bath) being the gallant
Johnny Turk, will have to get used to
the vastly different view that the Turks
have of Gallipoli. After all, they won.
Not only that, that military adventure
was merely one of a vast number which
go back in history to the Hittites.
At random, they share with Aus-
tralia the awful reality of a planned
capital, they drive as badly and dan-
gerously as Australians, their buses are
as uncomfortable, and the ferry-boats
crossing the Bosphorus from Istanbul
to Scutari, on the Asian side, are iden-
tical with Sydney ferries. Looking at the
city across the water, only the domes
and minarets of the mosques mark the
difference.
Turkish women, regrettably, are un-
likely to measure up to the romantic
notions of the seraglio. They tend to
be shortish and plump and undeniably
pear-shaped.
West German authorities have re-
garded Turks as the most successful
of their labor importations for Mediter-
ranean countries, finding them particu-
larly hard-working and honest. How-
ever, there is no reason to suppose they
will not eventually fit themselves to our
ways.
What race are the Turks? Turkey,
the Asia Minor of the ancients and as
much a Bible land as modern Israel,
has an extremely mixed population,
some segments feeling the same enmity
toward each other that they feel for
the neighboring Greeks. The Turks
proper are of the Turanian race and
are related to the Finns, whom the Aus-
tralian Government snaps up eagerly
when it can get hold of any.
They are also related to the Manchus
and Mongols of North China and to
the Turks of Central Asia, which cer-
tainly gives the Immigration Depart-
ment a wide field to range. If migration
from countries which Australia, with
classic tactlessness and stupidity, has
decided are preferable to others con-
tinues to slow down, we may have to
keep nibbling at Asia,
If we take Turks, as well as Syrians,
Lebanese, and Israelis, what is wrong
with Iranians and Iraqi? Australia may
find herself right through to the hairy
Ainu of Japan before she is finished,
Then our racial policies, instead of be-
ing subject for indignation, will be
cause for laughter, which is still better
than we deserve.
Back-portering has been illegal in Turkey for many years, but it is sometimes
carried on surreptitiously. It is hard work but the pay is good


FORUM
We can't just "take over from the British"
By a Military Correspondent
THE IDEA IS STILL floating around
Australia that because the British are
pulling put of Malaysia and Singapore
therefore there is some requirement for
more Australian troops to move into
those areas. This idea is correct in its
assessment of the problem—that Aus-
tralia must now pull its weight more in
regional affairs, in its own independent
right, not merely as an appendage of
a bigger “Western” power. But it may
be merely an example of hidebound
thinking to imagine that all this means
is that we should put Australians exactly
into the spaces on the map that will be
left blank by the British.
We should certainly discuss with the
Malaysians and Singaporians—and also,
let us hope, with the Indonesians, Fili-
pinos, and the Thais —what we are all
going to do together about our mutual
problems of security. But do not let us
imagine in advance that the answer will
be as simple as “taking over from the
British.” For one thing, through no-
body’s fault but our own, we have not
yet got enough troops to take over from
the British. But even if we did, what
role would we be taking over?
The mystique that surrounded the
British presence in South-East Asia was
that it was the backbone of a “Com-
monwealth Strategic Force.” There was
always some doubt about what this
Force was there for. Britain was care-
ful not to offend its host countries by
being specific about its commitment. It
gave the Americans some vague idea of
British support, without being of any
use to the Americans. As it turned out,
the “Commonwealth Strategic Force”
was a washout when calls for its use
went out and Australia sent forces to
South Vietnam and an air-force unit to
Thailand off its own bat, with no help
from the British.
The two real roles of the British in
Singapore and Malaysia were first of all
to counter the communist insurgency
and then to counter Sukarno’s Con-
frontation. We provided assistance in
both these tasks and the British carried
both of them out with a success that
has not marked any other independent
British military operation since the
Western Desert campaign in World War
11. But neither insurgency nor threats
from a neighboring State at present im-
peril Singapore and Malaysia. Both of
them are future possibilities, of course,
but future possibilities can be met by
specific commitments or even treaties:
they do not require immediate garrisons.
It seems strange to suggest, as your
“CMF Officer” correspondent sug-
gested, that Australia should pull out
of Vietnam and concentrate on the
Malaysia-Singapore area. This would
mean that we would welsh on our
alliance with America which is, for
the present, the only worthwhile
alliance we have. It would also mean
that we would move troops from an
area where they had an immediate
military role to an area where they had
no military role. From the technical
point of army training and morale it
would mean that we would throw away
our present advantage of getting con-
tinued practice in counter-insurgency
operations. If counter-insurgency and
counter-confrontation are the kinds of
roles we see as the usual task for our
military forces, they are at present to
be found, par excellence, in South Viet-
nam.
But to say this is not to suggest that
we should concern ourselves only with
South Vietnam. There are problems of
insurgency or possible insurgency in
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thai-
land as well as in Malaysia and Sing-
apore. It should be one of the ideals
t)f Australian policy that these five
nations should begin to show some
common concern about this problem,
and that, if they do, we should be ready
to try to meet any assistance they might
ask us for.
In fact, we could get cracking now.
While Singapore and West Malaysia
tan for the moment handle their own
internal security problems, in North-
east Thailand and in Sarawak there are
insurgency threats that represent a
present danger and against which our
forces could be of some use right now.
Instead of offering to send more troops
to Singapore-West Malaysia, we should
be considering offering special task
forces for use on the border of Thai-
land and Malaysia and against the
Communists in Sarawak. This work is
not very dangerous; it gives good over-
seas experience for our troops, provid-
ing “acclimatisation,” opportunities for
language training, and so forth; and it
provides better training than can be
arranged in Australia.
Of course, there are good diplomatic
reasons why we should be ready to dis-
cuss questions of security with Malaysia
and Singapore and if for some diplo-
matic reason the stationing of an Aus-
tralian force there made sense this
would have to be considered. But even
if we see ourselves entering into a special
defence relationship with these two
nations, at least until such time as a
broader regional arrangement can be
made, it need not necessarily be in the
form of a kind of garrison.
Apart from the fact that our forces
could be of more use in Thailand or
Sarawak and would be receiving better
training there, a danger in the garrison
approach is that to station forces in
West Malaysia or Singapore, since we
haven’t all that many forces, limits our
political initiatives: there might be some
better place where it might later be
more expedient to send them. And we
should consider to what extent we want
to tie ourselves exclusively to the poli-
cies of these two countries, as against
other countries in the region, in a way
that might later inhibit flexibility in
some future situation we cannot now
imagine. There is also the danger that
a garrison force might make Malaysia
look a bit stoogeish.
On the other hand we could now
enter into specific commitments,
especially in relation to insurgency, in
which we would bind ourselves to these
special friends. The use of an air-mobile
Ready Reaction Force from Australia
could be almost as quick as keeping
permanent troops in West Malaysia.
There are other commitments into
which we could enter. The provision of
training cadres, for example; or an
increase in the number of Australian
troops in Chinese and Malayan lan-
guage schools; or swopping postings
between our armed forces and those of
Malaysia and Singapore.
Your “CMF Officer” correspondent
of several weeks ago was right when he
attacked the provincialism of Australian
defence thinking. But his suggestion that
a “stabilising force” was needed in
Malaysia and Singapore may itself have
been an example of the very provincial
thinking he was attacking. He suggested,
in effect, that we should compensate for
the British withdrawal by simply doing
what they did. Of course, what will
finally be decided will come from diplo-
matic relations and it may not be the
perfect solution. The continued weak-
ness of Australian military strength
(even if it is now improving) con-
stantly inhibits our diplomacy. If we
had more Ready Action army units and
a larger effective air force, our diplo-
matic initiatives would mean more than
they do now and we would be in a
position in which we could make more
of them. People who want a more
“independent” Australian diplomatic
policy should also be pressing for the
increase in armed strength that would
make it possible.
To be an ally of the Americans in
the future it is not going to be enough
to send them a small expedition if they
ask for help somewhere. If we continue
to see our main strength to lie in the
American alliance, this is itself a strong
reason for also being “independent” in
the sense that we should try to foster
regional security arrangements in our
own region of a kind that would seem
to make sense to the Americans, so that
they did not see our part of the world
as a lost bet.

OVERSEAS
Britain and America take
a rest from each other
PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S speech
delivered at San Antonio, Texas, on
Saturday, has effectively put an end to
all talk and speculation about bombing
pauses and peace bids. In was
plainly designed as a reply to the
crescendo of dove-ish criticism of the
war, the President served notice on the
nation and the world that he was not
going to allow America’s will in Viet-
nam to fail or falter.
He went out of his way to declare:
“The true peacekeepers in the world
tonight are not those who urge us to
retire from the field in Vietnam . . .
they are rather those men who stand
on the demilitarised zone at this hour
taking the worst that the enemy can
give-”
For Britain’s Prime Minister Harold
Wilson and his colleagues assembled
at Scarborough and nervously facing
this week’s Labor Party Conference
debate on Vietnam, both the timing and
the tone of the President’s speech could
scarcely have been more unfortunate.
It demonstrated conclusively that the
plea which Mr. George Brown is under-
stood to have made to the President
on Wednesday for the U.S. to risk
trying a bombing pause purely on its
own initiative has achieved absolutely
no results.
For reasons like this the pundits of
Britain are engaged in proclaiming the
end of the “special relationship” be-
tween Britain and the United States.
There are, of course, no official obse-
quies and the death is not formally
recognised. Yet it is being greeted with
a sort of melancholy, almost masochis-
tic satisfaction.
The Americans now take major
defence decisions without even inform-
ing, let alone consulting, the British
Government. The U.S. Congress for-
bids the American purchase of military
equipment from the British. American
policy in the Far East proceeds on its
war course unaffected by the tut-tutting
of the British.
This “special relationship” has been
a cardinal act of faith since World
War 11. In Britain it justified a cer-
tain subservience to American policy.
Now, this in the future may be harder
to justify. And, anyway, the relation-
ship was always being shot through
with disagreements, especially over the
Far East. Nor, in fact, did the Ameri-
cans often support the various shifts
in British colonial policy. Indeed
there are old men in England con-
vinced that the United States eased
Britain out of her colonies so that she
might dominate them herself.
The relationship existed and in part
still exists at many different levels.
There was the slightly' rickety super-
structure of inter-governmental rela-
tions. It was based on mutual respect
born of the war, on the apparently
incorrigible ingratitude of the rest of
the world, on the friendship between
Presidents and Prime Ministers and the
Establishments of the two countries.
Now the memories have dimmed and
President Johnson does not much care
for foreigners.
And yet it is not as simple as that.
Recently, before a visit by Prime Minis-
ter Harold Wilson to Washington, an
American journalist talking to the
President asked why he saw Mr. Wilson
so often and went to such lengths to
satisfy him. The President answered:
“It’s like this. A young man may have
a girlfriend in Paris, and another in
Rome and another in Vienna and an-
other in Madrid. But in. London, hell!
that’s different. That’s where Mom is.”
In fact this relationship, as old as
the United States itself, has almost
always been at once a close and an
irritable one.
It largely consisted of a British and
unplanned and quite unconscious influ-
ence upon what might be described as
the Anglo-Saxon underground in the
United States the white, Protestant,
and largely eastern seaboard class who,
recruiting occasionally from other
strains, manage to keep the reins of
power.
At least until World War 11, they
were the rich and grateful recipients of
the various manifestations of British
culture and they swallowed them
whole, like oysters. There were Gains-
boroughs and Lawrences for the great
museums and Chippendale chairs for
the dining-rooms of the arrived. There
was Scotch whisky and the Prince of
Wales on tour, and Rhodes scholar-
ships; the design of rose gardens and
knighted English actors and« country
house architecture; the elegance of
English historical writing and English
servants and a conception of English
luxury (omitting the food and the cli-
mate) and clothes for men; things
made of silver or leather or china; and
the accent which, unlike the Austra-
lians, the educated American tends to
find charming if occasionally incom-
prehensible.
What America sent over to Britain
in this interchange is more important
and less funny. Even if American his-
tory demands a special relationship,
above all with France, the convenience
of the common English language
and the frequent coincidence of national
interests have made the British-Ameri-
can connection inevitable, durable, and
real. But the relationship between
nations is not based on friendship or
gratitude or owed loyalty. It is the
coldest thing in the world, based upon
calculations of self-interest that can
change within a week. Any nation
worth its diplomatic service can find
splendid reasons for spitting in the eye
of a recent ally.
Britain and America are not on a
crash course but on different courses.
America is preoccupied with problems
that differ from those of Britain,
America’s South-East Asian and Negro
agony do not intimately concern the
British. Nor does Britain’s flirtation with
Europe, nor her striving for economic
respectability, intimately affect many
Americans. But the benevolence if not
the mutual respect still remains. No
great damage has been done. If it were
necessary to both, the relationship could
be restored overnight. As it is, each is
preparing to take a rest from the more
demanding aspects of each other’s
company.

Middle East
Nasser ready for peace with Israel?
THERE IS GROWING evidence from
well-informed Arab and non-aligned
sources that President Nasser is now
ready for serious negotiations to settle
the Arab-Israel conflict. In this he has
the backing of the Soviet Union and all
the Arab Governments except Syria and
Algeria.
The negotiations envisaged would not
be direct with Israel but through a third
party. Their main basis would be
international recognition and guarantee
of the pre-war armistice lines as the
definitive frontiers of Israel. They would
not include formal diplomatic recog-
nition of Israel by the Arabs, but could
culminate in a formal ending of the
state of belligerence.
The Egyptian plan is still flexible
because Cairo is anxious to avoid offer-
ing concessions before it has some assur-
ance of the bargaining limits on the
other side.
President Nasser’s ideas of a settle-
ment were outlined in secret at the Arab
summit conference in Khartoum and
have since been developed by his two
chief foreign affairs advisers, Mr. Mah-
moud Fawzy and Mr. Mahmoud Riad,
the Egyptain Foreign Minister, in a
series of diplomatic visits to foreign
capitals, including Moscow, Paris, and
Delhi, in preparation for the current
United Nations General Assembly.
They are believed to include the
following points:
Borders: Basically, they should be as
they were before the war began on June
5. But whereas these then had an in-
ternational status of only armistice lines,
the UN, including the Great Powers,
should now declare them to be the
political frontiers of Israel and the
neighboring Arab States.
Security: There could be minor fron-
tier changes—such as an exchange of
one or two villages—to improve secur-
ity. The Sinai Peninsula and other key
border areas would be demilitarised
under UN supervision.
Transit rights: Free passage for
Israeli shipping through the Straits of
Tiran. Transit for Israeli cargoes
through the Suez Canal would be accep-
ted, but passage of Israeli ships is con-
sidered a more difficult case, on both
political and security grounds, because
the canal runs through the middle of
Egyptian territory. President Nasser is
believed to be ready to accept the
passage of Israeli ships if this were
matched by Israel’s acceptance of the
right of Arab refugees to return, or
if the World Court ruled that Israeli
ships should pass.
Jerusalem: The Arabs appear to be
ready to consider almost any arrange-
ment guaranteeing access for the
Israelis and others to the Holy Places
short of outright annexation of the Old
City by Israel.
Israel has also been keeping her
final negotiating position in reserve.
But despite internal differences within
her Government, she has shown in
talks with Western Governments that
she is still not opposed to a settlement
roughly on the basis of the pre-war
borders plus the creation of demili-
tarised zones, subject to five provisos.
1. There must be a final peace treaty
signed by the Arab States.
2. The refugee problem must be
ended, basically by resettlement in the
Arab States. This would involve moving
most of the refugees from the Gaza
Strip elsewhere.
3. Israeli ships must have full right
Nasser ... working to end belligerence
of passage through the Suez Canal as
through the Straits of Tiran.
4. Jerusalem should remain under
Israel control with special arrangements
with Jordan guaranteeing access to the
Muslim Holy Places.
5. Border changes at the approaches
to Jerusalem and on the Syrian heights.
The British Government believes that
the Arab position has now evolved
sufficiently to give some hopes of move-
ment toward a settlement if America
and Russia, can get together to bring
pressure on both sides.
As a result of Mr. George Brown’s
talks in New York last week, there are
hopes in London that an agreed back-
ing can be put to the Security Council
before the end of this month and later
to the General Assembly.
It was also reported on Saturday that,
following Mr. Brown’s talks with the
Egyptian Foreign Minister at the UN
last week, a former British Ambassador
to Egypt, Sir Harold Beeley, was
expected to visit Cairo for talks with
Egyptian Government officials within
the next two weeks.

China’s anniversary
A grand failure
COMMUNIST CHINA celebrated the
eighteenth anniversary of the People’s
Republic this week in a creeping mist
of suspicion that Mao Tse Tung’s ex-
periment in “big democracy” for the
millions has failed, and that the great
cultural revolution has been betrayed.
Unity was the main theme of the
massive parade before Chairman Mao.
But this show of solidarity is likely to
have no more substance than the paper-
thin alliances between rival revolutionary
factions now being hastily concluded
throughout the provinces in response to
the demand for a grand reconciliation
among the Maoist masses.
The demand springs from the urgent
need to re-establish order out of the
chaos that followed Mao’s decision to
open a Pandora’s box and unleash the
millions against established communist
authority. Analysts in Hong Kong be-
lieve that in 40 principal cities of China
the havoc and confusion have been com-
parable to the disorders in Canton.
The latest, ukase that all Chinese
revolutionaries must down arms and
merge their proliferating warring groups
(there have sometimes been 40 in one
factory) into “little alliances” and,
finally, “grand alliances,” in order to
unite everyone, appears constructive, but
in fact sets the cultural revolution on
its head. For the ideological object of
this unification of millions with but a
single thought should be that mass
organisations rule at all levels through
representatives of their choice.
The new “alliances,” therefore, imply
that the masses are being asked to unite
as the belated “democratic” foundation
of an authority already imposed from
above, and there are even “preparatory
committees” in which key men, lauded
as loyal Maoists today, were castigated
as “Fascist beasts, ghosts, and demons”
only yesterday. The formation of these
bodies is often swiftly followed by re-
ports of violent fighting, and obser-
vers are convinced that this reflects the
bitterness of idealistic revolutionaries
who feel cheated. Their ranks are
swollen by unfashionable fanatics (and
moderates overanxious to prove how
extremist they are) who are still fighting
the cultural revolution of last spring
this northern autumn, and want to go
on overthrowing the local administra-
tion.
Now a good Maoist no longer carries
a gun. Even Mao’s wife, who in July
provoked bloody incidents by urging
revolutionaries to defend their positions
“by force,” has this month echoed
injunctions of the cultural revolutionary
committee in Peking, inspired by
moderates like Premier Chou En Lai.
These tell the peasants to return to
their farms for the autumn harvest,
the students to go back to school, the
revolutionaries to give up their arms,
and everybody to stop travelling about
for the sole purpose of “struggling.”
Much-publicised reports that “the
revolutionary situation is excellent”
cover up the fact that Mao’s recent
and unusual tour of five provinces
and Shanghai was directly dictated by
China’s intricate pattern of political
discord. He was evidently using his
personal prestige to restore unity,
giving local administrations the cachet
of his authority, and so encouraging
the formation of “alliances” around
them by October 1, and at the same
time rallying exasperated military
leaders, many more of whom he
received after his return to Peking.
From the outset the People’s Libera-
tion Army was divided over the cul-
tural revolution, but a long summer of
frustration and humiliation has mul-
tiplied the groaning in the ranks.
Earlier in the year the Army was
given the task of preserving order,
stopping all fighting, and simultane-
Hong Kong’s Bank of China... dressed
up from China’s national day, Oct. 1
ously “supporting the Left.” When the
Army then acted as neutral peace-
keeper, separating Red Guard from
Red Guard impartially, it was again
blamed by the Maoists for not backing
them actively with bayonets.
Meanwhile, unarmed regular soldiers
were often pushed around by students
or village militia who had acquired
rifles. Now the Army carries weapons
again, and in extreme cases a soldier
may shoot to kill if revolutionaries defy
orders to surrender their guns.
However, the curbing of the bewilder-
ingly fragmented Chinese masses is a
ti'iumph for Chou En Lai and a set-
back for enthusiasts like Madame Mao
and Marshal Lin Piao, Mao’s own heir
and successor, who have paid out too
much line to the proletariat and must
now openly subscribe to a policy of
restraint.
Every effort is being exerted to make
Canton safe for the International Trade
Fair due there next month, and the
“Liberation” of Hong Kong is not even
among the slogans for the day
announced for this week’s National
Anniversary in Peking.

Singapore
Underground Reds
WATCHING THE EAGERNESS of
the 25,000 young people who took part
in celebrations of the second anniver-
sary of separation from Malaysia, one
was caught by the enthusiasm and
esprit de corps evident everywhere.
Despite its weaknesses, Singapore’s
multi-racial society works today largely
because it has a driving, hard-working
Government. Of course, not everyone
agrees with the Government’s policy
and of these, the pro-communist
Barisan Sosialis Party and other com-
munist front groups have been the
loudest opponents.
The Barisan Sosialis, however, can
no longer claim to be an effective
Opposition since their withdrawal from
Parliament. Following Singapore’s
separation from Malaysia, the Barisan
decided on a boycott and in 1966
withdrew its nine Members of Parlia-
ment. The Party Chairman called it a
protest against “the phony independ-
ence of Singapore.”
The actual communist organisation
is believed to be underground with its
headquarters in the Rhios, the off-shore
islands of Indonesia. Its members are
said to be former Malayan National
Liberation League (MNLL) people
who during Confrontation went to
Indonesia or later to Hanoi and Peking.
Though no direct links can be estab-
lished between the MNLL and Barisan
Sosialis, most of the directives on
communist activities undoubtedly come
from this underground.
Cadres in Chinese middle schools
still exist from earlier days, and
through them indoctrination and Mao-
study are carried on extra-curricularly.
These students join demonstrations and
rallies together with Barisan members
and those from Left-leaning unions.
Recently, differences of opinion be-
tween the various communist fronts
and within the Barisan Party itself have
come to light. The dilemma has been
whether to go all out a la Red Guards,
creating havoc and chaos and risking
arrests, or to bide their time while
building a climate of tension which can
easily be stepped up into a campaign
to disrupt Singapore’s economy.
Dr. Lee S'iew Choh, the Party’s
Chairman for a number of years, is now
believed to be in full control of the
Barisan, since he purged it of his oppon-
ents early this year. Though the under-
ground has at times found him unsatis-
factory, he is necessary to it. A Govern-
ment official explained that whenever
the underground wanted to take a
tougher line with which Dr. Lee did
not agree, there was a compromise.
Perhaps the compromises that the
underground Communists have had to
tolerate have resulted in the failure of a
general strike called in April and a
march on the City Hall in June to start
a “revolution.” It could also be one of
the reasons why demonstrations have
been “hit and run” in the words of the
Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.
Since April, communist activities
have been largely small demonstrations
carried out in different parts of the city
simultaneously. Various groups march
down a street carrying sharpened staves
with little triangular red flags fastened
to the end. A group of 50 or 70 people
is the rule. As soon as the police arrive
on the scene, they quickly disperse.
On these occasions the police are re-
luctant to arrest the demonstrators (who
are largely teenagers), not wishing to
make martyrs of them or give cause
for the Communists to do so. None of
the boys and girls have been keen to
be arrested, either laws have recently
been passed disallowing bail, and those
found to be non-Singapore citizens are
liable for deportation.
These deterrents, the alleged split in
the communist fronts, and the Govern-
ment’s determination to stamp out the
communist “malaise,” have momen-
tarily caused a slackening of anti-
government activities. However, the
Government takes the political opposi-
tion seriously, especially when school-
children are involved. Recently, for
instance, 200 students were expelled
from Chinese middle schools for “taking
part in pro-communist activities at the
instigation of the Barisan Sosialis and
pro-communist agents.”
Perhaps, too, the slight lull in their
activities is giving both the Barisan and
its supporters time to think out new
lines of attack. Unlike Malaysia, Singa-
Barisan Sosialis Party leaders the Singapore Government detained in 1963 under
public security laws included S. Woodhull (left), Linda Chen, and J. Puthucheary

Philippines
"R & R" elections
FILIPINO VOTERS go to the polls on
November 14 to elect eight senators for
the national legislature and new pro-
vincial governors and other provincial
and municipal officials. This is not a
presidential election, but the campaign-
ing for the senatorial seats will be as
lively as that in a general election year.
President Ferdinand Marcos, titular
head of the ruling Nationalist Party,
is campaigning as if he were running
for re-election.
He is especially anxious to win the
vote for the senatorial candidates since
he himself has selected and pitted them
against the opposition (Liberal) party.
Vowing that all his candidates will be
elected, President Marcos is taking to
the field himself to assure their success.
Election issues in the Philippines have
not changed. The number-one charge
against the administration has remained
the same in all the elections so far
graft and corruption. The opposition
party invariably rides to victory on the
wings of that issue, and, once in power,
gets toppled by the same issue. The
second most important issue is the high
cost of living. Although the last admin-
istration that of President Macapagal
—was able to stabilise the price of rice
through heavy imports, the increasing
pinch of tight money added to the
other discomforts brought about by
decontrol of exchange, and fed fuel to
the growing clamor for change.
The other economic issues, such as
unemployment, slow economic growth,
unrealistic policies, lack of a national
purpose, or an ideological program for
effecting reforms, are not as well under-
stood. Many Filipinos in the rural areas,
long used to unemployment or being
idle, are not much bothered by the lack
of job opportunities. But every time
the price of rice goes up and the
scarcity forces them to line up to buy
rationed cereal, their anxiety grows.
Hence, President Marcos has been
concentrating on R & R (rice and
President Marcos ... going all out
roads) as the best means of maintain-
ing economic stability during confused
and uncertain times and ensuring the
survival of his administration. During
the campaign, the President’s candidates,
will be able to point to the several
thousand kilometres of feeder roads in
the barrios and national highways
throughout the country, and to the
prefabricated schoolhouse construction
and the low-cost housing projects that
are underway.
The people are being promised that
by 1970 there will be no rice shortage
—this year’s harvest may yet determine
whether President Marcos’ party will
win a decisive majority or not.

ern Economic Review," Hong Kong.)

New IMF drawing rights
will stimulate trade
IT HAS BEEN called paper gold,
or a sort of permanent overdraft. But
whatever the name, the new Special
Drawing Rights on the International
Monetary Fund, that were agreed to
at the end of last week in Rio de
Janeiro, are good news for Australia.
This is not so' much because they
will come in handy for us to use, but
more because they wall be even handier
for many of our customers and poten-
tial customers. For the new drawing
rights will go part of the way toward
allowing the world’s trading nations to
trade more, to run down their reserves
of foreign currency more without
reaching for the panic button whenever
their reserves of gold and foreign
exchange become too low for comfort.
As the chart on this page shows,
world exports have been rising at a
far faster rate than have the inter-
national reserves of countries that buy
them; recent history is loaded with
examples of countries having to restrict
their imports or their internal economic
development because their reserves were
not enough to allow them to
go through what may have been tem-
porary difficulties, or the normal
swings of the cycle. For an exporter
like Australia, these restrictive moves
in customer countries because of
liquidity shortages have been a major
factor holding back our own economic
development.
The new automatic drawing rights,
to be added to the existing drawing
rights the 107 members of IMF already
have, will probably be extended only
moderately at first—the “Economist”
talks about $1 or $2 billion being issued
in the first five years. But now that
the principle of “creating” money for
use in international trade has been
established, there seems no reason why
its use should not proceed apace.
Because of some hard bargaining by
France, the scope of the drawing rights
is not as great as the U.S. and Britain
had hoped—they have suffered more
than any others from the international
liquidity shortage.
These new drawing rights will work
this way: nations will pay their own
money into a special account at the
International Monetary Fund, in
amounts proportionate to their existing
quotes in the fund, giving them the
right in times of need to draw other
currencies to settle any international
debts. The right to make this drawing
will count as part of a country’s inter-
national reserves; it will be just as real
in international terms as gold. But
only governments will use these draw-
ing rights; the public and companies
that deal internationally will have
nothing to do with them, for the rights
simply provide the international cur-
rency with which people, companies,
and governments make international
purchases.
Uranium
Time of shortage
IT SEEMS a little absurd that while
Australia’s two uranium mines are stand-
ing idle and while new reserves are
being discovered (last week Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia came up with what
looks like a commercial deposit near
Rum Jungle in the Northern Territory)
the Australian Atomic Energy Commis-
sion should be warning us that we don’t
have enough of it.
Last week in its annual report, the
AEC said that Australia’s known econo-
mically recoverable reserves of 10,600
tons of uranium were inadequate to
support even a modest nuclear power
program. And to ram home the point
that this was not a far-off, pie-in-the-sky
problem, it said that construction of
several nuclear stations could be econo-
mically justified in the 1975-80 period
only eight years away. The AEC
report, strongly supporting the Govern-
ment’s decision earlier this year to ban
uranium exports unless the exporting
company finds additional reserves to re-
place the exports, talks of a “severe
world shortage of uranium” that is
developing. And it points out that apart
from the AEC’s own exploration pro-
gram, there had been little effort put
into exploration for uranium in recent
years despite the many well-based pre-
dictions of a world shortage and sub-
stantial increases in price.
Interest rates
"Through the roof?"
THERE IS REAL cause for concern
in Australia that international interest
rates are in danger of “going through
the roof” again as they did a year ago.
This is not just because the Australian
Government would have to pay even
more than the 7 percent offered on
this month’s $35 million sterling loan
(or than the 6| percent on last week’s
$22 J million Deutsche mark loan). For
there can be no doubt that overseas in-
terest rate pressures do have some im-
pact on the local scene; and not simply
in influencing the Reserve Bank to main-
tain a high interest rate policy as a
disincentive to foreign owned com-
panies to do their borrowing here. At
a time when we are raising large sums
of money abroad to finance our de-
velopments, high interest rates add
heavily to their cost and to the amount
of money we will be paying to foreign
investors to service these loans.
The “Economist” says that the key
to it all is in the U.S., where the mone-
tary authorities have been left with
the full responsibility of trying to main-
tain. economic stability following Con-
gress’ continued opposition to Presi-
dent Johnson’s request for a tax in-
crease.
Aftep last year’s experience, when a
tightening of credit in the United States
quickly produced a frightening escala-
tion of interest rates round the world,
the Federal Reserve has sat quite liter-
ally paralysed with apprehension. That
is one reason why interest rates in
to allow unrestricted export of our
meagre supplies, it argues. But there are
few experts in the commercial end of
this business who fear any real local
shortage; they take the view that people
will be out finding it when it is wanted,
but that it is a bit much to expect
people to spend a lot of money on pro-
jects that would not. pay off for at least
eight years, which is roughly what the
AEC is saying.


America have not yet risen quite as
fearfully as they might have; and the
economic slack in Germany and France
explains why Euro-dollar rates have
remained relatively stable so far, with-
out really matching what rise there
has been in American rates.
But how long can this go on? Mr.
William McChesney Martin, the chair-
man of the board of governors of. the
Federal Reserve System, gave yet an-
other warning last week, that if Con-
gress does not approve the tax increase
American interest rates could jump “to
unprecedented levels.”
The fact is that the Fed feels un-
happily trapped in a policy of easy
money in order not to put too many
difficulties in the way of the American
Government’s heavy borrowing over
the remainder of this year, and also
through fear of what would happen to
American and world interest rates if
credit to American banks was made a
little less readily available, let alone
actually tightened. The New York
market is now so nervous that the first
sign of credit tightening could pre-
cipitate a panic-stricken escalation in
interest rates. This may not actually
happen but just the fear that it
might weighs heavily with the Ameri-
can authorities and is thought, to be
one of the factors staying Mr. Martin’s
hand.
Even with a continuing easy money
policy in the United States, rates there
have already moved up sharply since
June, partly on the Government’s bor-
rowing program and partly in antici-
pation of credit restraint to come.
Investors in America are now keeping
their money market funds extremely
liquid, because they feel that .interest
rates are bound to go up further and
they are not going to tie up their
money at this stage. American money
market banks have thus had to call
heavily on their European branches for
additional funds.
The really big danger to world inter-
est rates will come if: (a) the Ameri-
can Congress shallies too long over the
tax bill and (b) the German economy
meantime picks up steam, as Mr.
Callaghan is now urging for the greater
glory of Britain’s balance of payments.
Should that happen, Britain’s exports
to Germany might go up. But one
shudders to think how high British
Bank rate would need to go in an
international interest war.
McEwen’s “bank”
Far from finished
MOST CANBERRA journalists seem
to think that Mr. McEwen’s “bank” is
finished. He did, after all, say last
Wednesday, “What I had in mind has
been misrepresented to so many people
that the best thing I can do, I think,
is to abandon altogether what I had
in mind.” Next day, in Parliament, he
apparently backtracked a little, saying
that the day before he had only been
expressing a personal reaction to what
had been happening. The decision on
what was to be done rested not with
him but with Cabinet.
But anyone who knows the ways of
Mr. McEwen’s tough intra-coalition
politicking can see that the McEwen
bank scheme is far from finished. He
has served notice on Mr. McMahon
and his Liberal colleagues that he is
fed up with what he regards as their
dishonest misrepresentation of his
scheme and that he may come out
openly and tell the electorate what
they have done.
They do seem to have been pretty
tricky in their handling of the affair,
for things have happened in this
sequence. Mr. McEwen put his “bank”
to Cabinet, whereupon Mr. McMahon
said Treasury had its own. This he
hurriedly produced in rather half-
baked form. It was accepted at the
time as a means of mobilising large
blocks of local capital and only mar-
ginally as a scheme to raise money
overseas. Mr. McEwen backed the
scheme, seeing it as complementary to
his own. Then, so the McEwen camp
asserts, the McMahon bank was gradu-
ally transformed into an institution
which, it was claimed, could operate to
raise funds overseas. Moreover, the
Treasury scheme would serve to keep
Australian resources out of foreign
hands. Then the name was changed to
really tidy things up.
At that time Mr. McEwen said
tersely that the bank had been “im-
portantly renamed” and that its
“functions have been redesigned.” This
was his first hint of dissatisfaction
with what the Treasurer had been up
to. Anyone looking at the formal dis-
tribution of responsibilities of Minis-
ters in the Cabinet would think that
financial matters such as these would
come clearly under the jurisdiction of
the Treasurer. But Mr. McEwen is
obviously not going to be beaten by
formalities.
Housing loans
Closing a gap
GOING ALONG in its unobtrusive
but none the less effective way, the
Housing Loans Insurance Corporation
is succeeding in stiffening the security
behind the housing loan business. By
the end of June it was insuring mort-
gages at the rate of $1 million a week,
an increase of $600,000 a week since
the beginning of the year. It attributes
the rise both to increasing number of
approved lenders, which is up from 47
to 129 on the year, and to a record
volume of lending by savings banks
and building societies. The latter have
found its insurance facility an attrac-
tive bait for funds. There’s an increas-
ing awareness among lenders also of
the flexibility loan insurance affords, in
that they don’t have to be so cautious
on the score of resale values. This has
helped to spread the HLIC business
to cover all sorts of houses from
terrace-type cottages in industrial
suburbs, home units, and indeed houses
everywhere.
The biggest takers of housing loan
mortgages are still the building
societies, which accounted for 62 per-
cent of those granted last year. The
corporation claims that it is now mak-
ing a telling contribution toward re-
ducing the so-called “deposit gap,” but
thinks that considerably more low-
deposit lending will be required before
credit-worthy homeseekers can be
reasonably sure that one of its
approved lenders will be able to make
loans of this type available.
In other words, what the corpora-
tion would like most to speed its
objectives now is a more active market
in insured mortgages and by this
route to get a bigger revolving fund
of house-lending money being applied
to the business. One of the snags in
getting this is undoubtedly the mania
in the States for increasing stamp
duties. Sir Henry Bolte would cer-
tainly help things along if he exempted
the corporation’s insured mortgages,
from his new stamp duty.
Altona
The first dividend
WHEN THE ALTONA (Victoria)
petrochemicals complex was being
planned at the end of the 1950 s a lot
of people, including experts in the oil
game, believed it was rather ahead of
its time. But the various companies
went ahead, even, in some cases, import-
ing raw material ahead of the necessary
supply from the adjacent refinery of
Petroleum Refineries (Aust.). The
plants were duly opened in the early
’sixties by ebullient Premier Bolte, but
all and sundry among them took ages
to get into stride. They were at least a
bit ahead of their time, because only
last week came the first dividend paid
by a company strictly confined to the
complex (that is, excluding Union Car-
bide, which has various plants else-
where). It was $300,000 from CSR-
Dow, which is half owned by CSR
Chemicals (50 percent CSR and 40
percent Distillers Co.) and half by Dow
Chemicals of the United States.
CSR-Dow produces a wide range of
petrochemicals (which we used to im-
port), including styrene monomer,
polystyrene resins, and ethylene di-
chloride, as well as supplementing our
chlorine capacity. And if it hadn’t been
for the Tariff Board’s controversial
chemicals rotation the dividend
drought from Altona may not have
been broken yet.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Government’s second
domestic Loan for 1967-68 keeps to the same short- and
long-term interest rates that have prevailed for about a
year; once more, no target is announced . . . The Govern-
ment is also arranging to borrow 100 m. Deutsche marks
($22m.) on the German market, its first issue in Germany.
August’s retail sales, seasonably adjusted, totalled $592.6m.,
$3.4m. below July’s and $5.4m. below June’s.
In Parliament, Mr. McEwen announced that he had
“abandoned” his idea of establishing an industry develop-
ment corporation mainly to seek overseas capital.
For the markets: Mining stocks were slipping to-
ward the close on Australian share markets, yet they mostly
set the tone during the week; industrials appear uneven.
Early Friday dealings in London forced another peak;
later profit-taking did not much disturb the firmness . . .
Wall Street looked somewhat featureless in fairly active
trading.
For Companies: An extra morsel comes from BHP,
whose interim payment (9.5 cents a share) is the same as
1966-67’s final but above the previous interim (9.16 cents
a share); the group’s pig iron and ingot steel production
moved well ahead in the first quarter of the current year.
Following legal clarification demanded by Mount Morgan,
Power Mining will issue another “notice of intention” to
make its bid, at the same time as Peko-Wallsend’s notice
goes to shareholders.
The Barrier companies don’t look completely happy . . .
Both Zinc Corporation and New Broken Hill had to report
reduced outputs for the 12 weeks to September 9 . . .
Broken Hill South’s profit to June turned out better than
forecast, yet, despite Cobar, it dropped back $610,307 to
$2,612,000; the dividend goes from 22 to 16 percent . . .
Right on forecast was North Broken Hill, where earnings
shed 15 percent to reach $6,409,000 but dividend stayed
at 25 percent . . . Tasmania’s EZ Industries also suffered
a sharp fall, from $7,653,298 to $6,786,000, and pulled
dividend down from 18 to 14 percent.
The first post-merger result from Johns and Waygood
Perry Engineering produced a profit at $2,387,513, to give
a 17.7 percent earning rate and the predicted 10 percent
dividend . . . Transporter and contractor Brambles Indus-
tries look forward to better profits from 1968 on as depreci-
ation on new plant lessens . . . Can maker J. Gadsden held
fairly steady at $2,171,037 (previously $2,178,737), as did
the dividend precisely at eight percent.
On the motor front, parts maker Repco is achieving
“useful gains,” while Dunlop hopes “to lift earning rate
still further” during the current year.
Not up to hopes was the merged STP Holdings and
Tennyson Textiles, Universal Textiles: profits of $579,342
were well under the previous (combined) $689,059, although
they covered 13 percent very adequately.'
The earning rate edged up for John Fairfax when profit
moved from $3,001,044 to $3,026,926, comfortably protecting
a 17 percent payment . . . Melbourne printer Wilke is to
raise $1,511,151 by a one-for-four premium issue and a
private preference issue; 1966-67 earnings fell from $555,913
to $454,437 after allowing for a debt loss.
Anderson Meat Industries lost $861,295 and wants to sell
another major asset in front of a reconstruction plan . . .
Maryborough Sugar changed a $209,914 loss into a $94,205
profit and will now pay three percent.
MEN AND MATTERS
A “BENCHMARK” man or a “broad
band” man? The new man at the Tariff
Board, Mr. C. H. Grace, says he is “not
an anything man.” He’s joining the
board with an open mind.
Colin Grace, a lawyer who turned
to industry after spending a very busy
war (he ended up as a colonel) in many
campaigns, will be no stranger to argu-
ment. At Sydney University, where he
went from The King’s School, he was a
member of the debating team and an
editor of “Honi Soit” (the first under-
graduate editor of “Honi Soit”). He
had intended going to the Bar, when the
war (and two children) intervened. In-
dustry seemed a better way of making
a living in those days.
He has not had anything specific to
do with the workings of the Tariff
Board in his job as chief executive
Management Services at Common-
wealth Industrial Gases, a job from
which he retired at the age of 58 three
weeks ago. But while his company’s
main product is not subject to import
competition, it, nevertheless, does im-
port quite a deal of equipment.
THERE WAS SOMETHING inevi-
table about one of last week’s two
appointments to the Marrickville
Holdings board. After all, Mrs. Jones
is a big name out there where the
margarine is made. So now Mr. Jones
has become a director. It just shows
how influential women can be. The Mr.
Jones is Mr. Norman Ellis Jones, Syd-
ney stockbroker, racehorse owner, and
former deputy-chairman of British
Tobacco.
A good tennis and squash player in
his younger days, Norman Jones, now
57, is an AJC committeeman, a post
he won in 1961 after a controversial
ballot that resulted in Mr. Justice
Dovey being voted off the committee.
He did his Commerce and Law degrees
at Melbourne University, where he went
from Melbourne Grammar, but came to
Sydney in 1936 with W. D. and H. O.
Wills as another lawyer who decided to
go into business.
TO BE A SORT of roving ambassador
around the globe at 52 for the firm
you joined as a lad in 1929 as “some-
thing like the fourth assistant to the
assistant office boy” puts Louis S.
Stengel, chairman of the Manhattan
Shirt Co., whose revenue was $3B mil-
lion last year, in a class by himself. But
we’ve heard of Stengel a long, long
time before his present visit here to
plug his shirts. He was the chap who
gave us the idea of starting Father’s
Day here, one of the two patron saints
of the retailing business (the other be-
ing the one who thought up Mother’s
Day). In the States he has been chair-
man of the Father’s Day council as
N. E. Jones
L. C. Stengel
well as a lot of other things. Now he’s
a grandfather.
He explains his humble entry into the
rag game by saying it was a vacation
job. When the 1930 depression came
and Manhattan kept him on because
“no one was paid less, so I escaped
the firing line,” he was glad of the job,
liked it so much, and got such good
hard experience that it became his life.
Last year, after being president of the
company for seven years, he asked to
step down. The board thought he was
going to a rival firm, so they made
him chairman. Now, with 34 countries
as his oyster, Stengel travels slowly.
He came here in a German freighter
that took seven weeks for the trip. When
he returns it will be to a house in
New Jersey, not to an apartment in
'New York, because he wouldn’t live
in one if you paid him.


Commonwealth-State relations
a new era out of strife?
By W. J. CAMPBELL... Former N.S.W. Auditor-General
THE STATES are not only un-
happy, they are doing something
about the “inequitable” way the
Commonwealth allocates its tax
revenues. Western Australia and Vic-
toria have introduced a new turn-
over-wages tax, Queensland last week
called for an “independent study”
of Commonwealth-State financial
arrangements, and N.S.W. has
pleaded with the other States to
“strive together” for greater access
to Government revenues.
The Queensland proposal, made
in last week’s Budget speech by
Treasurer Gordon Chalk, was that
the Financial Assistance Grants
Scheme should be completely re-
viewed and that the States should
have a definite growth in revenue
as a right through a fixed percent-
age of income tax and other
revenues, not only on the basis of
population, and that financial assis-
tance grants should be paid only to
States with particular disabilities.
The former N.S.W. Auditor-
\ General, Mr. W. J. Campbell, also
\ wants an independent inquiry —■
I but he doubts that there will be one.
| In this article he explains why and
\ outlines what are the consequences
| of the present relationships.
A NEW ERA of Commonwealth-State
relationships could be beginning. If the
business-wages tax lately introduced
into Western Australia and now pro-
posed by Victoria sets a pattern which
becomes the vogue throughout all the
States, then the whole question of these
relationships would go into the melting
pot. This latest trend in State fiscal
policies stems from their hunger for
more money that is within th£ir own
budgetary disposition rather than
money that is tied to special projects.
Reports of recent Premiers’ Conferences
underline the Federal Treasurer’s in-
sistence on the rigid formula ad' » ed
for the general assistance grant
grant which provides the States with
cash they can use any way they like).
However, there is a stronger trend
toward additional aid by way of new
or special purpose grants. While the
States never refuse these grants, they
do not relish their side-effects. Usually
the grants call for matching sums; they
consolidate or enlarge the area of
Federal encroachment; their spending is
policed by the Commonwealth, which
shares in the kudos for providing the
cash. To pursue their preference for
“free” money, the States must concen-
trate on the general purposes grant.
Unless they can loosen its tie-up with
population and wage-level increases,
the problem of how to cope with pres-
sures for new and expanding expendi-
ture services will remain.
Naturally enough the States attract
the greater public sympathy in their
battle with the Commonwealth. This
perhaps is more because of their role
as the underdog than from any real
understanding and objective appraisal of
the issues. The case for the States is
argued in closed Canberra proceedings,
and the citizen is apt to be confused
by what little detail he reads of the con-
ference debate. He is left, however,
with a definite impression that, even
in its most expansive mood, the Com-
monwealth cuts the fiscal cake in a
spirit of one for you and two for me,
and that the States (particularly the
ones yielding the greater Federal
revenues) are getting a raw deal.
But are they? How much of Federal
Budget conservatism over the years has
been directed simply to national econo-
mic betterment? How much has resulted
in financial build-up, and how much
has gone into what would be regarded
in accountancy parlance as financial
reserves?
In total, Federal expenditures from
Consolidated Revenue on what are
termed capital works and services
amount to quite some billions of dollars.
There would be no point in stressing the
highly pleasing fact that the Common-
wealth has managed to finance capital
projects without recourse to borrowing,
except by way of contrast with practice
among the States. To a large extent
the States operate in financial reverse.
In 1965-66, for example, New South
Wales was obliged to call on more than
85 million borrowed dollars to provide
for construction works hospitals,
schools, social institutions, etc. — ; of a
kind which the Commonwealth takes in
its annual stride. And that 85 million
dollars is only the figure for one year.
This pointed contrast in revenue and
capital financing practice between the
Commonwealth and the States high-
lights a hard fact in the division of
the nation’s revenue resources at the
two levels of government. With the
total Government bond-raising capa-
city virtually reserved to the works
programs of the States and their
instrumentalities, the Commonwealth
looks, perforce, to its revenues, for the
financing of capital works. It seems
then that the Commonwealth is
destined to continue building up for
its future, while the States are
destined to continue pledging theirs.
None of this means, of course, that
the Commonwealth is setting up its
own Fort Knox, or that it has some-
thing like a Treasury chest of olden
times buried away in Canberra. All
the same, it has managed to accumu-
late some nice nest-eggs. An amount
of more than 400 million dollars shows
in the National Welfare Fund. It is
true that the Welfare Fund has been
applied in internal financing • that
is to say, absorbed in the Treasury
complex of revenue and loan raisings
and spendings, floating debt contrac-
tion and expansion, and so on. All
the same, the fund is to be regarded as
a substantial revenue stand-by, to be
drawn upon if need be.
The return from the Snowy Moun-
tains Scheme of something like 800
million dollars (predominantly revenue
financed) will provide a regular Budget
windfall in the years ahead, as it
comes in, with interest added, from
charges on State electricity-generating'
authorities. There is also the big invest-
ment from revenue in the war-service
homes organisation, and in various
income-earning business undertakings.
If it could be claimed that these items
do not mean so much in the present-
day six-billion-dollar Budget, there is
one other which cannot be dismissed
so lightly. It is the so-called Loan
Consolidation and Investment Reserve
which, after receiving 227 million dol-
lars from the 1966-67 Budget and
paying out 150 million dollars in
liquidating Federal debt in the same
Budget year, had a remaining credit
balance of 915 million dollars.
Euphonic, but imprecise, the word-
ing of this reserve affords little guide
to its role in Federal-State financial
relationships, namely the so-called
underwriting of State loan programs.
The reserve is built up by regular
annual appropriations from Federal
revenue, and together with other
Treasury cash resources it has been
used to a large extent toward making
good the short-fall in receipts from
public loans against the Loan Council’s
yearly borrowing approval. Operating"
through the reserve, the Commonwealth
itself becomes a subscriber to the
loans. In the outcome of many years,
the Commonwealth has. grown into
quite a large-scale bondholder in the
ever-growing debt structures of the
States.
If allowance be made for the present


investment by the Commonwealth in
State loans and other set-off to the exist-
ing fixed-term debt of the Common-
wealth, there would seem to be not so
much of this debt left to be paid off
from future Federal revenues. Celebrat-
ing this happy state, the Parliament re-
cently enacted a large-scale reduction
in the annual sinking-fund charge on
the Budget. In 1966-67, the first year
under the changed legislation, the pay-
in to the fund was less by some 76
million dollars as against 1965-66.
Twbnty-odd years is not a lengthy
period in the lifetime of national debt.
The success of the Commonwealth’s re-
payment efforts in that period since the
end of the war must surely rank
among the most remarkable achieve-
ments in public debt management any-
where.
Treated as an isolated feature, away
from the whole body of financial re-
lationship, the disparate debt positions
of the Commonwealth and the States
provide a valuable debating point for
the latter. It will certainly become more
so as the disparity widens. For its part,
the Commonwealth would probably
contend that this, with all else in the
relationship context, is equilibrated in
the overall cash settlement through the
general assistance grant. Whether such
is or is not so, is the nub of the matter.
Certainly it is fair to say that if the
many elements of financial relationship
be brought together, the Commonwealth
attitude to the States, power conscious
and overriding as it may be, is marked
by pragmatism and political realism.
Government leaders in the States are no
different to leaders in government any-
where, in that they measure achieve-
ments in terms of expenditure figures.
It would be hard to visualise any limits
to State spending proclivities if given
full rein under a free grants system,
without the sobering influence of
revenue - raising responsibility to the
electorate. Certainly the amounts which
the State could, and would like to,
spend would prove far beyond Federal
Budget resources. And even if they
were free of the Federal tie, the prob-
lem of raising these amounts them-
selves would still be with them, creat-
ing much the same dilemmas as now.
So it gets down to the Commonwealth
drawing the line somewhere, leaving the
States the obligation of devising their
own means of raising over-the-line
amounts.
Whilst the big and little brother
analogy remains valid in many avenues
of Commonwealth and State Govern-
ment association, it has for long been
a myth of financial relationship. The
role of the Commonwealth partly
assumed and partly thrust upon it is
now that of the pater familias. The
Commonwealth attitude is plainly that
of a family head, satisfied that if the
old man has a good pile stacked away
there is less need to worry about the
financial future of the family. And, like
the discriminating parent, prone to
favor the weaker members of the
family, the Commonwealth leans to the
less fortunate members of the Federa-
tion, conditioning the grants system, in
some measure, to particular disabilities
and special needs amongst them.
This is well enough. It is part of a
design for the levelling up of national
standards, which is of the essence of
the Federation device. But immediate
financial difficulties of the States loom
largest in their domestic outlooks, and
the redistribution of financial resources
through the grants system intensifies
the problems of some, as much as it
may reduce those of others. It becomes
a matter of new iniquities replacing
the old ones. For one thing, the differ-
ences in wealth and population between
the more-developed and the less-devel-
oped States are relatively wide. For
another thing, Australian federation
comprises only a few State units, and
thus there is less scope for the equalis-
ing effect of large numbers on the inci-
dence of the redistribution process.
In the most part, the burden falls
upon two States; it makes their sacri-
fice on the Federation altar a heavy one
indeed. Per capita, for instance, they
received something like 63 dollars
under the general assistance grant in
1966-67 compared with sums ranging
up to 100 dollars received by the
remaining States. By contrast, contribu-
tions per head of population over all
the States to Federal revenues in the
same year could well have been very
considerably the other way about. As
much then as the redistribution plan
fits into the national concept of federa-r
tion, it remains, nevertheless, a thorny
issue in financial relationships. It
kindles interstate jealousies and may
The Loan Council in session: cajoling, sometimes thumping
detract from State unanimity at
annual Canberra conferences. And the
greater the disunity in the presentation
by the States of their case against the
Commonwealth, the easier it becomes
for the Commonwealth to deal with
the case.
But there is a bright side to the pres-
ent Commonwealth-State arrangements,
especially in those matters where Fed-
eral paternalism has served the national
interest, and, although chafed at by the
States, has been for their own good.
The co-ordination of their borrowings,
through the Loan Council, put an end
to the disorderly and costly loan-rais-
ing practices previously followed by
the States, competing amongst them-
selves; it gave a national tone to the
then waning security status of Austra-
lian Government borrowings. The fed-
erally inspired and federally controlled
National Debt Sinking Funds for the
States made a planned system of debt
repayment, for the first time, a reality
among them. The success of the funds
is today one of the bright features of
Australian Government finance.
Then there is the uniform income
taxation, conforming to the concept of
national fiscal unity, and favored by
most of the States, as well, perhaps, as
being more to the liking of the others
than they might admit. Most certainly
the citizen, concerned above all for his
pocket, and in large numbers more
interested in Federal handouts to him-
self than to the States, could be the
one most apprehensive of any return
to dual-income taxation.
The citizen who is less indifferent to
the warped course of Federal-States
financial relationships might sometimes
ponder why he should be so much at
variance with himself in his Federal
and State spheres of national life. But
he could well feel that differences be-
tween the Commonwealth and the
States are of the very nature of our
kind of federalism. They need only
emphasise its basic problems. Firstly,
how can State sovereignty without
money power be made to work side by
side with Federal money power with-
out sovereignty? Secondly, how can
unity be achieved without unification
in the national finances?
Much that would help toward an
understanding, if not a solution, of the
problem could be accomplished if the
whole matter of financial relationships
was subjected to independent inquiry.
It is too much to expect, however, that
such an inquiry may come about. One
can hardly expect the Federal holders
of the money power to give up their
unfettered exercise of it to the delib-
erations of a judicially minded fact-
finding authority.
Nor might the State leaders, in a
more settled and placid relationship,
relish any lesser scope to pursue their
nationally and historically glamorous
role of defending the rights of the
States arguing, cajoling, and some-
times thumping the Canberra confer-
ence table. Above all, their cherished
political catch-cry blame the Com-
monwealth—could be lost to them.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Where will share
buying lead
the institutions?
BY J. C. HORSFALL
PERSONAL SHARE buying has
perked up this year. In the mining
market, and in a few other places,
speculators have woken from the long
slumber that followed their abortive
spree at the start of the ’sixties. Whether
it’s merely for one of the few ■ sole
traders left in the stockbroking game,
or a firm mainly preoccupied in the
big commissions hunt among the in-
stitutions and investment funds, this is
a welcome change from recent years.
Of even more interest to the brokers,
though, is the better appetite of institu-
tional funds for ordinary shares. With
so few new issues about, and companies
doing more of their financing from cash
flows, brokers have come to rely in-
creasingly on institutional orders for
their bread and butter, and at consider-
able cost have tailored their own in-
vestment departments largely to cater
for it. For them the battle of persuasion
with the institutions is on all the time
these days, in back as well as board
rooms.
The growing extent of this depend-
ence on institutional buying is thrown
up by some figures recently published
by the Institute of Public Affairs.
Whereas in 1954-55, life companies and
pension funds between them bought only
$7 million worth of ordinary shares, in
1964-65, ten years later, they bought
$l7B million worth, or about 25 times
more. In addition, between these two
years, institutions, other than life com-
panies and pension funds, stepped up
their ordinary share buying from $27
million to $7B million a year making
an overall institutional total share
buying of $256 million in 1964-65. By
way of contrast, over the same period,
personal buying of ordinary shares by
individuals dropped from $132 million
in 1954-55 to $7B million in 1964-65.
There is no gainsaying the discipli-
nary effect the swing aw'ay from per-
sonal to institutional share buying has
had on the stockbroking business. It
has depersonalised it almost beyond
recognition from the leisurely old days.
It has enthroned the investment analyst
as king and the less statistically minded
of members have become his slavish
followers. It has meant a revolution in
the old relationship between broker
and client. The man the broker has
to persuade these days is more likely
to be the investment manager of a
life or superannuation fund, a trustee
company or a unit trust than a rich
old fogy worrying about switching his
shares around. Solicitors winding up
estates are about the only permanent
standbys from bygone days.
Stockbroking has been sharpened up
and the waistlines of members are pro-
bably the better for it. As the IPA sees
the swing to institutional share buying,
that is not so very interesting, perhaps.
It is more intrigued by the fact that it
reflects a broadening of share owner-
ship, in that when the institutions buy
shares in industry they do so on behalf
of the mass of savers in the community.
By this route, it claims, we get, as it
were, social ownership by the back
door. This is something it claims is
far more practical than the Socialists’
former fetish of nationalisation. For
one thing, it leaves private enterprise
untrammelled by State control; for
another, it is part of what the IPA
sees as a democratisation of profits.
I don’t know whether Socialists would
agree on either of these counts or that
institutionalised investment is an effect-
ive substitute for what they are aiming
at. But at any rate it gives the “people”
more of a finger in the capitalist’s pie,
albeit rather obliquely.
For those who put their savings into
the institutions, it gives them a stake
in the profits of industry. But they
would also get a stake in these if they
put their money into Commonwealth
bonds, the interest on which is paid
out of Consolidated Revenue, to which
industry contributes by way of taxa-
tion. Further, the return on ordinary
shares, though distinguished by being
flexible, is not fundamentally different
from the return on any investment and
it seems to me to be stretching a point
to develop a case for the arrival of
social ownership of industry simply on
the strength of the institutions buying
increasing wads of ordinary shares.
Anyway, there is no question of the
latter giving the saving masses the re-
motest control over industry. Whether
it gives the institutions a bigger fist in
the control and direction of industry,
as the IPA claims, is also seriously
open to question, at least so far in the
Australian experience.
Nor, for that matter, is it all that
obvious why institutional control of an
industrial concern should be an advan-
tage. The institutions are notoriously
conservative in approach (as the big
mining groups have discovered). Their
expertise is essentially financial, not
industrial. On the other hand, as guar-
dians of mass savings and in business
to produce contractual benefits for
policyholders and so forth, they have
acquired a wealth of experience as
watchdogs over industrial investments.
If one is to talk, as the IPA does, of
them moving in a subconscious manner
(not implying a grab for power) into
a position where they become a new
power in the industrial control business,
more supporting evidence is needed than
the IPA gives. I seriously doubt whether
it exists.
The presumption is that, as they be-
come big holders of ordinary shares in
a company, even say to the point of
having a controlling interest, the insti-
tutions will elect to take more than
the usual passing interest, even to be-
come involved at the board level. This
would give them more say in the affairs
of a company than is now open to
the small shareholder. Our experience
here is rather the opposite. True, there
have been cases, say H. G. Palmer,
where, having taken over the whole
equity, a life office has gone in boots
and all, only to regret having done so.
This is a rare exception here, though
in the United States there have been
numerous interventions by institutions
in the affairs of companies in which
they have large equity interests. Of
course, even if there are few cases as
yet of institutional involvement in this
country, there is no reason why the
same shouldn’t happen here, but the
institutions remain reluctant to put their
oar in. The classic case of this was
their refusal to follow the good Shep-
herd in remonstrations about the un-
worldliness of the board of BPIP a
couple of years ago.
The institutions have built up big
portfolios of industrial shares, increas-
ing the percentage of total industrial
equity share capital held by them in
Australian enterprises, but their hold-
ings are still relatively modest and
widely spread. (At present the life
companies have about $5OO million in
ordinary share investments.) Even if
it is expanding in depth and range,
the process will be limited not only by
the prior claims of government securi-
ties on institutional funds, but also
by the exigencies of contractual obli-
gations to policyholders. The institu-
tions have claimed that the pre-
ponderance of overseas equity owner-
ship in large segments of industry is a
block to their equity aspirations, and if
I had to name a group who look most
like, and are, getting more strongly en-
trenched in the box seat on the in-
dustrial power front, I would certainly
not pick the institutions. My choice
would be the faceless foreigners.

Builder of essential equipment for essential work,
International Harvester is proud of the vital role it
is playing in Australia’s progress.
In three short decades Australia has become an
important industrial power. Today the world looks
to Australia for aluminium to fashion pots and
pans, and wheat for its bread; our iron ore goes to
overseas smelters, our wool into international fash-
ions; Australian steel builds bridges for far-off
peoples, Australian butter butters their bread.
Wherever you go you will find IH products in trans-
portation, agriculture and industry winning the neces-
sities of everyday life from the rich resources of this
vast land. Truly we can say that Australia’s progress
is an International concern.

Rhochrematics.
It's a big word that means big things
to businessmen.
Rhochrematics (Roe-kre-mat-ics) is
the science of the even distribution of
commodities.
The word is not as important as its
meaning.
To BOAC it means offering mar-
keters more than a means of transport
from A to B. It's a complete service to
industry.
BOAC serves more than 70 cities
worldwide. Our airport facilities and
data processing equipment make our
cargo-handling service the most modern
and efficient in the world.
We keep track of your consignment
every step of the way. And handle it with

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
No gambling and
plunging: just
observe and act
I CAME ACROSS a rather interesting-
article on speculators the other day.
It being a subject close to my heart,
and relevant to the standard of my
eating habits, I was interested to read
what was said about the ancient art (if
that’s the right word). Bernie Baruch,
one of America’s all-time great (and
successful) speculators, started off with
“Modern usage has made the term
‘speculator’ a synonym for gambler and
plunger. Actually the word comes from
the Latin ‘speculari,’ which means to
spy out and observe. I define a specu-
lator as a man who observes the future
and acts before it occurs.” Mark Twain,
another well-known Yank, put it .this
way: “October is one of the peculiarly
dangerous months for speculating in
stocks. The others are July, January,
September, April, November, May,
March, June, December, August, and
February.”
Some other rather good comments
came from brokers. One said he didn’t
like doing business with female specu-
lators because they “cry about it.”
Another pointed out the perils of being
too greedy with the quote that “Bulls
make money, bears make money, but
pigs never do.” My own interpretation
is that a speculator is ideally one who
can spot a situation before it happens
and before too many others do, and
then take advantage of it. To do this
he needs to know the facts and how
to use them. Also, he must be always
willing to sell quickly (without crying)
if he is proved wrong.
So much for the theory, on with the
practical. This week the practical
action consisted of buying Federal
Hotels and selling EZ Industries and
Amalgamated Petroleum.
Federal Hotels, whose origins date
back to the day of the old Federal
Coffee Palace in Melbourne, officially
kicked off in business in its present
form in 1924. Its chain of ten hotels,
which stretches from Hobart to Surfers
Paradise, includes such fondly remem-
bered names as Lennons, Menzies,
Federal, and Savoy Plaza. The com-
pany first came to my notice as a
speculator’s possibility about three
weeks ago. It was then I noticed its
turnover turning over at a furious rate
while its price remained cool, calm,
and collected at its year’s low., I took
this as meaning that the stock’s price
has been squashed to as low as it would
go and that even the pressure of high
volume sales couldn’t make it go any
further.
Since then turnover has eased back
to normal and the price has gone up
2 cents to 19 cents. Nevertheless, even
at that price I still feel there is the
possibility of making a cent or two
on the deal. My main reason is asset
backing. Any share whose main asset
is land and whose backing is three times
its market price is always popular with
me (and I don’t think I’m Robinson
Crusoe in this respect). Another reason
for liking the stock is that I think
its profits, like its price, have gone as
low as they’re going and are now headed
upwards. The directors agree and have
predicted better times for the current
year. Also in the current year will be
the regular beachheads of American
Servicemen down from Vietnam for
their battle breaks. When these boys hit
Sydney, Melbourne, and Surfers Para-
dise, Federal Hotels will get a shot in
the arm that should help it make dol-
lars, not cents.
Incidentally, another stock that is
poised for better times, if you are
willing to wait a year or two, is Mount
Isa. This company, which works the
greatest single concentration of mineral
wealth in Australia, is currently in the
profit doldrums and the short-term out-
look is gloomy. However, now is the
hour for term investors (and this is a
term stock) to be buying up big for
the sun that is going to shine some
time around 1969/70.
Sales for the week were EZ Indus-
tries and Amalgamated Petroleum. EZI,.
whose profit just dropped 11.3 per-
cent, lost me $25, while Amalgamated
saved the day by coming good with a
profit of $9l.

1000 Federal Hotels $0.19 $194
SOLD
150 EZ Industries $2.85 $419
2500 Amal. Pet. .41 pd $0.12 $295

WILD CAT PAGES
Better times in the markets
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
JUST BEFORE THE Budget two
months ago there was no real stock-
market boom; the only reason the mar-
ket looked high was that the leaders
had pushed up all the indices, as there
were more shares near their lowest
points for the year than near their
highest. Well, thanks to the Budget and
to an excellent batch of company re-
sults, things have changed since then.
Now there is a general feeling of better
times in the market that has spread
through the share list. Not that all
stocks have risen this year, but most
have. Of the 177 stocks in The Bulle-
tin share list, almost two out of three are
at higher levels than a year ago. And,
of course, some mining stocks have had
remarkable rises, as have those “miners”
that are in the “industrial” list, like
BHP, Thiess, and Peko-Wallsend.
So what about those that have been
left behind? Is this the place to look
for the best sort of rises in the next 12
months?
Probably not. Just because a stock has
risen is no reason for avoiding it.
Success breeds success- in the stock-
market. Those that have already done
•well in only moderately good times give
the greatest prospect of doing best when
things get really good, particularly now
there is some evidence that, despite the
slow rate of capital-raising to finance
expansion that has so far taken place this
year, last month’s ACMA-Bank of
N.S.W. survey indicated that capital
expenditure on plant and machinery
during the next 12 months would be
greater than the amount spent last
year.
So it seems that the “heavies,” the
capital goods producers, should do well,
•although the survey was not nearly so
cheerful about building (which may be
a sector to steer clear of for a while
despite the bargains that appear to be
available in such stocks as J. Mcllwraith
and PGH Industries, both of which are
well down on a year ago and both of
which should eventually do a lot better
than last year). There are some fairly
cheap shares around in companies that
stand to do well in this field. I’ve been
plugging the steel distributors like
William Adams and J. Blackwood for
a few weeks now. But others like
McPhersons, with their big machine-
tool operations, look most interesting.
Even though McPhersons’ price has
risen considerably this year, at around
$3 it is still 60 cents below its price of
a year ago.
Nevertheless, there seems some chance
that many of the depressed stocks may
be preparing for a bit of a rise. Inter-
national Resistance seems too good a
company to stay in the doldrums for
ever; the Peters companies were recom-
mended here for counter-cyclical in-
vestors a few weeks ago; Schweppes and
Tarax should do very much better in-
deed this year than last (summer has
started off nicely for them, and that is
what counts in the soft-drink trade),
and Mt. Isa should soon be over its
ore-grade problems at the foot of its
new K 57 shaft.
YOU DID NOT HAVE to be a genius
to do well in the stockmarket this
year; most of the investment services
are able to point to a pretty successful
record with their recommendations
(and so, of course, can we). But what
are they recommending now? One of
them, Cowan Investment Survey, has
a list of recommended growth stocks
which include nine companies for
medium-term investors and 12 for long-
term investors. What is intriguing
about these lists is that six of the nine
recommended medium-term stocks are
mining companies as are nine of the
12 long-term recommendations.
Its medium-term stocks are Associ-
ated Minerals, BHP, Hamersley Hold-
ings, King Island Scheelite, Mary
Kathleen Uranium, and Peko-Wallsend
from the mining lists, and only ACI,
Braemar, and Myer from the indus-
trials. For long term, Cowans add EZ
Industries, North Broken Hill, and
New Broken Hill to the miners, and
nothing to the industrials. True, they
suggest that both sets of investors
should retain any holdings of Ampol
Exploration, CSR, ICIANZ, Kathleen
Investments, Norseman Gold, WMC,
and Westralian Oil, and that longer-
term men should also hold on to their
BH South, Cockburn Cement, Con-
solidated Goldfields, and Western
Titanium.
But this group is heavily mining-
orientated (even CSR owes its present
glory more to iron ore than to sugar).
The only non-miner is ICIANZ (and
it gets into the act in a way because
it provides the mining industry with
explosives), which stands to benefit
considerably (as does CSR) from last
year’s chemical tariff.
LAST WEEK’S DULL result from
Motels of Australia (now to change its
name to Travelodge Australia Ltd.) of
a 3 percent profit rise to $901,142
(nevertheless a record) is very much
in line with the $900,000 profit fore-
cast here on July 15. And, as was
pointed out at the time, there is no
The Chartist says:
AMALGAMATED HOLDINGS now appears to be technically sound for a
renewed growth phase in view of the market action over recent weeks. The long-
term trend rate of 10 percent appreciation per annum was held until the latter
end of 1966 when prices fell to a low of $l.lO, which proved to be a strong support
level. During the past few months an uptrend has taken prices above the resistance
level of $1.50 created by the 1964 “top.” The short-term target of about $1.60
has now been achieved but a move to $2.50 and a more optimistic objective of
close to $3.00 is a possibility for the longer term. Investors should take advantage
to buy on any reaction from current levels. Although the overall basic rate of
appreciation has not been spectacular, past history on the chart shows that the
stock is capable of steep intermediate trend rates. Last sale price on 26/9/67 —
.51.59.

reason for investors losing heart in this
stock because of the apparent lack of
spectacular profit growth.
The main reason for the present
modest results from its motel opera-
tions (profits per guest appear to have
continued their recent falls with a fur-
ther drop from 93 cents to 90 cents
in the latest year) is that the chain has
been expanding its room numbers so
rapidly that a proportion of them have
only been in service for a part of the
year. In addition, four of the group’s
motels were sold to its partnership with
Trust Houses of the U.K. during the
year, so that only half their results
would be available.
Current prices, up around the 90
cents peak for the year, give a dividend
yield of 5.6 percent on the steady 10
percent dividend (which is due to
return to its old 124- percent before too
many years go by). This year should
see Motels of Australia attain the
status of a dollar stock.
FOLLOWERS OF companies of which
Mr. Raymont Moore is chairman may
have noted their predeliction for
healthy portfolios and strong liquid
positions. Some of them have done
better at investing in recent times than
at their real job. For example, Newbold
General Refractories (which has had
to put up with some solid competition)
has a share portfolio worth $l.B mil-
lion at June 30, or about 34 times the
cost of $526,215.
That sort of capital appreciation
and the 12.7 percent income yield on
the cost of the portfolio gives the
stock greater appeal than its refrac-
tories do at present, particularly as the
portfolio consists chiefly of a swag of
BHP and Brickworks shares. So many
companies hold shares in BHP that
there has been a universal rise in the
market values of company portfolios.
With all these resources behind them,
it may help explain why so few com-
panies are bothering to come to the
market for fresh funds this year.
THE STOCK EXCHANGE’S new
rules of interim reports could cause a
few ruffled feathers among some of
the older companies on their lists; it
will be interesting to see whether these
“oldies” try to get away with thumbing
their noses at the Stock Exchanges
when the interim report season begins
in earnest next February.
The changes are decided improve-
ments on the old arrangeemnts and
investors should welcome them. The
main features are that interim reports
must be made within three months
instead of “as soon as possible”; varia-
tions of tax provisions by more than
15 percent from normal taxation rates
should be explained by the major items
responsible for the variations, and their
amount, being disclosed; final reports
must include the names of subsidiaries
that suffered losses during the year
(and how much they lost); and the
preliminary result should state any
unusual events that influence trading.

The Melbourne market
The galaxy of Philip Morris
ONE MAN’S SMOKE can be another
one’s poison, as shareholders in British
Tobacco and Rothmans observe when
they contemplate the experience of.
those in Philip Morris (Australia).
These lucky people have been virtually
“taking a trip” this last year or so
and have seen their shares get the
heavenly status symbol of a 2.4 per-
cent dividend yield and, so far, a
capital gain of some 45 percent. This
is something to boast about for this
Melbourne-based company. Its big
Sydney-based rivals haven’t had it
nearly so good. Rothmans, whose
experience has been very up and down,
are now on a 7.7 percent yield basis/
and British Tobacco, whose fingers are
in so many pies other than cigarettes
these days, on five percent.
In this annus mirabilis, the American-
controlled (by Philip Morris Inc. with
a two-thirds stake) concern has
showered on shareholders most of the
benefits in the equity book notably
a one-for-two bonus, a split from $2 to
$1 in the par value of the shares, a
rise (the sixth in succession) in divi-
dend from 12 to 13 percent, and a 29-2-
percent increase in net profits to a
record in its thirteen-year history (it
was incorporated in Victoria in March,
1954, and has its main operation at
Moorabbin). Looking back to the 1960
year of boom for the economy, Philip
Morris has increased its earnings rate
just abut eightfold since then to 78
percent, in what must be about the
most successful of any U.S. operation
in the industrial field here over the
period.
Nor does it look as if the trip is
nearing its end for shareholders, be-
cause the board is now talking confi-
dently of paying 11 percent on the
capital, soon to be increased to $5.1
million by the one-for-two bonus issue.
This would equal a rate of percent
on the pre-bonus capital and give a
theoretical yield of 3.4 percent on last
week’s price of 526 cents for the shares;
towering above the payment would be,
on last year’s performance, an earnings
umbrella standing four times as high.
On this prediction and not taking into
account the prospect, which would seem
a most likely one, of earnings going to
greater heights this year, the market
was taking a favorable view of the
shares last week.
The key point is whether Philip
Morris can keep on increasing- its share
of the market. Last year’s excellent
result was solidly based on its increase
in sales volume but, like all the others,
Philip Morris had to counter cost
increases in several directions, such as
higher prices for leaf tobacco and other
raw materials, labor and marketing,
with advertising, in the highly com-
petitive cigarette setting, a major item.
As well as its top-selling Marlboro,
Alpine, and Philip Morris brands, it
has now national distribution for
Galaxy, which is assuming importance
in the cheaper range market in res-
ponse to what must have been a costly
promotion effort. This is probably a
crucial period for Galaxy, but the
board is very confident about its pene-
trative potential.
One notices, also, that the company
is stepping up its efforts in the
export field, particularly in the Pacific
area, and that it is seeking new busi-
ness in supplying ships’ stores. Alto-
gether, the prospect still looks very
good, especially now the group is
firmly established in its new buildings
at Moorabbin, to which its operations
were transferred last year.
WHEN F. & H. EVANS, which is Aus-
tralia’s biggest maker of tow-bars and
has a variety of other engineering lines
in its product range out at Reservoir,
was floated in August last year the
market wasn’t in a very receptive mood
for new second-rank share issues. All
in all, these did pretty well in giving
the stags a bit more than a bob when
they were issued at 60 for 50 cent par.
But those people who put them away
haven’t done so well. Last week there
were sales at 43. Holders had to nurse
the hard truth that thus, far the com-
pany hasn’t come up to its prospectus
expectations. For while it has duly paid
an eight percent dividend for its first
year as a public company, earnings of
11.6 covered it but meagrely.
So anybody wanting, a share yielding
more than 10 percent (actually 10£)
and prepared to take the view that this
well-managed concern will pull up its
trading socks in the rosier economic
setting this year might have a look at
these. Looking back on last year, the
company appears to have had its profit
margins squeezed in the scissors of
higher costs and blunter than expected
trading blade. One suspects also that
with so many products, front play-
ground equipment to garbage collection
vehicles, economies of scale were con-
spicuous by their absence, except per-
haps on the tow-bars side. Now we hear
that still more products are being de-
veloped and that the process has al-
ready been a considerable charge on
profits. One would feel a bit more
confident about the prospects if the
product range was narrowed.
GETTING UP rather earlier than most
of us, Mr. A. C. Goode was one of
the earliest Melbourne financial birds
to catch the succulent worms of de-
velopment in W.A. and can now sit

COMMERCIAL & GENERAL ACCEPTANCE LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
delivered at the Tenth Annual General Meeting
of Members of the Company, September 26, 1967.
As copies of the Directors’ Report
and Accounts for the financial year
ended June 30, 1967, are already in
your hands, I assume that you will
agree to take them as read.
RESULTS
You will have observed from the
Accounts that the net profit of the
Parent and Subsidiary Companies,
for the year ended June 30, 1967,
after providing $1,341,100 for In-
come Tax was $2,115,594 compared
with $1,974,898 for the previous
year. The Australian Equity Cor-
poration Ltd. (AEC) Group contri-
buted a net profit of $233,995 after
tax to the overall CAGA earnings.
Gross Receivables which, at June
30, 1966, were $130,045,492, totalled
$134,684,225 at the end of the fiscal
year 1966/1967.
SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES
At the end of the year under
review Shareholders’ Funds were
$19,741,712 as against $19,026,118 at
June 30, 1966. An amount of
$700,000 has been transferred to
General Reserve.
INCOME
Of importance in Finance Com-
pany accounting is the manner in
which income is brought to account.
CAGA brings its gross income to
account in the following way.
CONTRACTS WITH FORWARD
CHARGES
On the small proportion of con-
tracts over five years, which we re-
gard as long term contracts, the in-
come brought to account is calcu-
lated actuarily. On shorter terms
contracts for reasons of mechanics,
the Rule of 78 is used and adjusted
each month to give an actuarial re-
sult.
LEASE RECEIVABLES
Lease rent is brought to account
as it is earned and income is calcu-
lated after providing for depreci-
ation of the leased assets. The
amount of depreciation adequately
provides for future contingencies.
OTHER CONTRACTS
Income is brought to account as
it is earned.
BORROWING
CAGA’s borrowing program by
way of issues of Debenture Stock
and Unsecured Notes continues to
achieve excellent results. A position
of high liquidity has been main-
tained. The borrowing program co-
ordinates the intake of funds with
the forward commitments by way of
maturing Debenture Stock and Un-
secured Notes and the general funds
as requirements of the Group’s fin-
ancing activities.
AUSTRALIAN EQUITY
CORPORATION LTD.
It will be noted from the Direc-
tors’ Report that in January, 1967,
CAGA acquired for cash from AEC
all of the issued shares of Motor
Credits (Hire Finance) Limited
which then became a guaranteeing
subsidiary in terms of CAGA’s
Debenture Stock Trust Deed. The
purpose of this acquisition was to
simplify the administrative control
by CAGA of Motor Credits (Hire
Finance) which is a Sydney based
company.
AEC is active in the General
Finance and Mortgage fields in Vic-
toria and its contribution to the
Group’s results during the year is
considered satisfactory.
COMMERCIAL & GENERAL
INSURANCE LIMITED
In August last, CAGA’s holding of
30 pei'cent in Commercial & Gen-
eral Insurance Limited was sold to
South Australian Insurance Holdings
Limited at a capital profit.
GENERAL
Since the company commenced
operating in 1958 a very high rate
of progress had been achieved in
every year and it was inevitable that
a period of consolidation should
occur. In my last address I forecast
that during the 1966/67 financial
year it seemed likely that the rate
of growth would be slower than in
the past. Sound progress was still
made during this period and an in-
creased net profit resulted. CAGA
has increased its profit each year
since formation.
Competition within the industry
is at a high level but CAGA is
equipped to meet it. A continuing
flow of good quality business is ob-
tained from a large number of
valued dealer, distributor, and other
client connections. The company’s
spread of Branch offices, the range
of services available, and the high
standard of the staff will ensure that
our position as one of the leaders
in the industry is fully maintained.
The current financial year has
opened on a most encouraging note.
The volume of business written in
July, and again in August, showed
an increase compared with the same
period last year.
A Branch was opened in May,
1967, in Parramatta, N.S.W., and
is already trading satisfactorily. This
brings the total number of fully
operating Branches throughout Aus-
tralia to 13. The Branches previously
opened in key country centres in
Victoria and N.S.W. have without
exception shown excellent progress.
It is clearly established that clients
and customers appreciate the height-
ened standard of service which it is
possible to give from local offices.
The program of establishing new
Branches will be continued.

CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.
and Subsidiaries
Extract from Sir Colin Syme’s Address
at the Annual General Meeting held at
South Melbourne Town Hall on Friday,
15th September, 1967.
After the downturn in results experi-
enced in 1965/66, higher output and
the revival of internal demand for some
important products, together with
recovery of prior cost increases through
price rises, lifted net profits of the
Group from $36.6 million to $42.8
million. This result is after providing
an additional $5.4 million for taxation
and increasing depreciation provisions
by $9.3 million.
Last year I commented upon the fact
that the Commissioner’s interpretation
of the sections of the Income Tax
Assessment Act which provide for de-
ductions in respect of mining expendi-
ture differed from our own and that
we were.taking steps to test the Com-
missioner’s interpretation. This impor-
tant matter is now before the High
Court of Australia.
During the year the dividend rate
was increased by the payment in May
last of a half-yearly dividend at the
rate of 9£ percent per annum, making
the average for the year 9 l-3rd per-
cent. The actual amount paid last year
was $24.1 million, compared with $21.5
million in the preceding year.
The liquid position of the Group is
reasonably satisfactory at the present
time, but during 1968 it may be neces-
sary to raise more money to finance the
expansion of iron and steel production
and allied activities. So far as oil and
gas is concerned, it has already been
reported that satisfactory arrangements
have been made to finance the Com-
pany’s interest in the Barracouta and
Marlin fields and associated works, but
in addition it could well be that sub-
stantial finance will need to be arranged
during the next two or three years in
relation to other oil and gas develop-
ments and possibly other mineral
developments. It will all depend on
how promising these developments turn
out to be.
STEEL PRODUCTION
The Group’s output of crude steel
rose by 498,000 tons over the previous
year’s production to 6,047,000 tons, an
increase of nine percent. Over the past
decade, increases have averaged 8.1
percent per annum compound, and
output has doubled over the past nine
years. Considering the complexity, and
the cost, of integrated steelmaking
facilities, this is a record which I be-
lieve justifies a sense of achievement.
DOMESTIC AND OVERSEAS
MARKETS
Australian demand for steel has been
steadily recovering from the low levels
experienced in the first half of 1966.
Improved orders were recorded for all
principal product categories with
deliveries of semi-finished products to
our associated companies rising during
the year. Present indications point to
a continuance of reasonable demand in
the current year, although there are
some reservations in the case of certain
wire and tubular products.
As I indicated to you last year, the
short-fall in Australian demand caused
us to step up our export activities sub-
stantially. Many of the orders then
obtained were delivered in the 1966-67
financial year, and as a result of this
and the substantial tonnage negotiated
subsequently we shipped abroad over a
million tons of iron and steel products,
compared with 366,000 tons in the pre-
vious year. In addition, we exported
substantial tonnages of manganese ore
as well as quantities of iron ore, ferro
alloys, and other products, all of which
contributed materially to our overall
results and to the nation’s foreign ex-
change earnings. Large tonnages of
these exports were carried in vessels of
our own fleet and of the Australian
National Line. Five Company vessels
have continued to trade overseas with
export cargoes to Japan, Taiwan,
Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singa-
pore carrying a total of 132,000 tons in
16 voyages. Two vessels of the Aus-
tralian National Line were continuously
employed by us in this trade complet-
ing eight voyages and lifting 72,000
tons.
Although there has been some
improvement in steel prices in export
markets, the substantial excess of world
capacity over demand continues to
exercise a strongly depressing influence.
Despite this fact many of the traditional
major producers are expanding their
facilities while developing nations are
giving high priority to the creation of
indigenous iron and steel industries.
However, these new industries cannot
always cater for a full range of products
and some room for imports remains. In
addition, there is often scope for the
provision of semi-finished products to
feed the newly established finishing
plants.
As our production rises further in
the current year, it is expected that
exports will continue at a substantial
rate, although the unusually high level
achieved last year is not likely to be
maintained. In particular, sales to New
Zealand may decline somewhat owing
to the further development of local
production and to current economic
difficulties.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION
Petroleum exploration has been con-
tinued throughout the year by Esso
Exploration and Production Inc. under
farm-out agreements with our subsidiary
company, Hematite Petroleum Pty.
Ltd. Following the initial discoveries
in the Barracouta and Marlin fields in
the Gippsland Basin, the results of
drilling up to the present time have,
generally speaking, given grounds for
optimism.
Shareholders have no doubt been
very conscious of the effect which our
various announcements relating to
petroleum discoveries have had on the
market price of the Company’s shares.
While the drilling results to date are
very encouraging I feel it necessary to
emphasise that we do not know yet the
size of the oil reserves discovered or to
what extent such reserves will justify
commercial production.
The field known as Barracouta is
being developed for the production of
natural gas. Reserves are considered to
be of sufficient magnitude to yield at
least 1.5 trillion cubic feet of dry gas
and substantial quantities of natural
gas liquids. However, this figure is
tentative, being based on seismic data
and two wells only. Firmer figures will
not be available until other wells have
been drilled from the fixed platform
now under construction, and until these
wells have been production tested.
Up to now, Marlin has proved to be
a baffling proposition. The first hole on
this field gave an encouraging flow test
of up to 1182 barrels of oil per day
through a 58/64in. choke for a test
period of three hours. The first step-out
hole was dry and the second step-out
hole was inconsistent with both the
first and second holes. It is impossible
to make any reasonable assessment of
the recoverable reserves of oil in this
field with the knowledge presently
available, but it would appear that the
oil column is not large and on results
to date the field would not appear to
justify commercial development solely
as an oil producer. The field does,
however, contain quantities of natural
gas estimated to be twice the reserves
of Barracouta field, which, of course,
justifies commercial production, and,
when the fixed platform is established
on this field in approximately four
months’ time, it will be possible to com-
mence further investigations of the oil
potential. We are hopeful of limited oil
production, at least during the early
years, as a result of developing the Mar-
lin field for gas, but we cannot be cer-
tain of this until information is obtained
from further wells which will be drilled
from the permanent platform.
The one well drilled so far on King-
fish has given promising results with
an oil flow of about 1500 barrels per
day through a fin. choke for a test
period of four hours. Additional seismic
work is being done to determine the
extent of the reservoir found in this
field. If any additional exploration
drilling is required on this structure
this will follow the next exploration well
which Esso are planning to drill on
the Dolphin prospect which is approxi-
mately 20 miles south-west of Barra-
couta.
Yesterday we obtained pleasing re-
sults from the test of the interval in
the Halibut well between 7800-7804
feet. During a three hour production
test, 44 degree A.P.I. gravity oil
flowed at a rate initially estimated at
approximately 2700 barrels per day
through a fin. choke. Subsequent work
on the test has established that the
flow rate was about 3200 barrels per
day. The very low gas/oil ratio is an
attractive feature of this test result.
It follows a test undertaken earlier this
week at a lower depth to establish the
approximate oil/water contact level and
during which some oil was recovered
in the short period the well was open.
The significance of this test with re-
gards to producibility of the structure
cannot be estimated until further tech-
nical studies have been carried out.
It is not proposed to undertake any
further tests of the well at this stage.
As far as the Bass Basin is concerned,
a complete technical review is being
made of the seismic survey data in the
light of the results of the three dry
wells drilled to date with the view to
considering further exploration activi-
ties in this area. Although drilling has
so far been restricted to the Gippsland
and Bass Basins it is expected that the
first well to be drilled in our Otway
Basin will be commenced within the
next few weeks. Approval has been
received from the South Australian
Government for the drilling of the
Crayfish A-l well offshore from Robe,
using the semi-submersible rig “Ocean
Digger” constructed at the Company’s
shipyard at Whyalla.
I think it may be appropriate to
make a general comment concerning
the release of information regarding
the Company’s oil activities. The Direc-
(Continued on opposite page)


tors recognise the great interest of
shareholders in having some assessment
of what these developments are likely
to mean to the Company.
The Board has followed a policy
of releasing promptly the factual data
concerning each well which is likely
to be of any significance. In its present
state of knowledge, it is not able to
go any further. Assessments based on
inadequate data would necessarily be
speculative and could turn out to be
most misleading. A good deal of mat-
erial has been published by others in
which estimates are made of the total
quantity and value of the oil likely to
be recovered and the Board wishes
shareholders to know that sufficient
factual knowledge is not yet available
to enable it to confirm or deny these
estimates. Along with our partner we
do have the optimism to feel that a
continuation of expenditure and effort
at a high level are more than justified
by the rewards that would accompany
the establishment of substntial com-
mercial oil fields.
Some aspects of our arrangements
with Esso in regard to the financing
of oil and gas exploration and develop-
ment still remain to be worked out in
detail but the broad principles have
been sufficiently agreed on to enable
me to describe them generally. In the
case of dry exploration holes, the cost
is payable by Esso and is not recover-
able from Hematite.
In the case of discovery and related
step-out holes in any field, the cost is
payable by Esso and is not recoverable
from Hefnatite if Hematite elects to
take a royalty; if, instead of a royalty,
Hematite elects for a 50 percent in-
terest, the total cost of discovery and
related step-out holes is in the first
place payable by Esso, but 50 percent
of the total cost is recoverable from
Hematite out of so much of the latter’s
50 percent share of production as is
attributable to the discovery and step-
out holes. In the case of Barracouta and
Marlin fields, the well costs recoverable
by Esso from Hematite are of the order
of $5 million. In the case of any
development expenditure which follows
a discovery, Esso is solely responsible
where Hematite elects to take a royalty,
but, where Hematite elects to take a
50 percent interest, Hematite is re-
sponsible for half of the development
expenditure as it is incurred. An ex-
ception exists by special arrangement
in regard to Marlin field and will also
apply to the first commercial field
discovered in the Otway Basin, if one
is discovered there and we elect to take
a 50 percent interest. Hermatite will, in
the long run, still be responsible to meet
out of its share of production one-half
of the development expenditure, but,
under the special arrangement, Esso
will, in the first place, have to find the
whole of the development expenditure
up to a stipulated maximum figure, but
when production commences it will
have a right of recovery against Hema-
tite by appropriating for this purpose
one half of the production which would
otherwise go to Hematite until the full
50 percent of the total cost of develop-
ment is recouped to Esso.
The successful operations in Gipps-
land have resulted in about 60 percent
of the area of the Company’s permits
in that area being excluded from sub-
sidy under the Petroleum Search Sub-
sidy Act.
GAS DEVELOPMENTS
Negotiations for the sale of natural
gas for distribution within Victoria over
a 20-year period were concluded earlier
this year. Under the agreement, gas
will be sold to the distribution com-
panies at the outlet of our gas process-
ing plant near Sale, where the gas will
be delivered into the transmission pipe-
line to be constructed and operated by
the Victorian Pipelines Commission.
The price will be determined according
to a formula which provides for re-
ductions with increases in volume. The
range between the upper and lower
price limits should encourage the dis-
tribution companies to reduce their
tariffs to consumers quite considerably
with the object of achieving a rapid
build-up of markets. As the anticipated
reserves of gas in the Barracouta and
Marlin fields exceed our commitments
to the Victorian distribution companies,
other potential outlets are being closely
investigated.
As previously announced, the Com-
pany, through Hematite Petroleum
Pty. Ltd., elected a 50 percent working
interest in the Marlin field and imme-
diately commenced the simultaneous
development of the Barracouta and
Marlin fields in association with Esso.
This development involves the con-
struction of a marine terminal at Barry
Beach near Welshpool for the fabrica-
tion of the offshore production plat-
forms which is at present being under-
taken by Australian Iron & Steel Pty.
Ltd. At this point the platforms will
be placed on special barges for trans-
port to the well sites. At a later date
this terminal will be required for the
servicing of the offshore facilities. Up
to date expenditure at Barry Beach
approaches $3 million and further ex-
penditure is contemplated. It is antici-
pated that platforms will be positioned
offshore on the Barracouta and Marlin
fields in December and January respec-
tively and production wells will be
drilled from them early in 1968.
Separate pipelines will join each
platform to a gas processing plant for
which land has been purchased near
Sale. This plant is designed to treat the
raw gas from the offshore fields to
recover the valuable liquid products
and to feed specification gas, essentially
methane, to the pipeline of the Vic-
torian Pipelines Commission. A further
pipeline will carry the recovered liquids
to a fractionation plant, where the
heavier liquids will be stabilised and
the lighter liquids separated into
marketable components such as the
liquid petroleum gases, propane and
butane. This plant will be built at
Long Island Point on Westernport Bay,
where storage facilities for LPG and a
liquids loading jetty will be constructed.
These developments alone constitute an
industrial complex of quite major pro-
portions.
The design and construction of all
facilities is progressing satisfactorily
and the target date for delivery of
natural gas is March, 1969. We have
given very close consideration to
whether it is desirable to have a separate
organisation to conduct these activities
but with the continuing rapid develop-
ments that are taking place it is not
yet opportune to determine what action
we should take. However, with the
information at present before us, for
the time being there is no reason to
change the present arrangement of
handling all oil and gas interests
through our wholly owned subsidiary
company, Hematite Petroleum Pty. Ltd.
MT. NEWMAN VENTURE
After initial difficulties occasioned by
the size and complexity of the project,
satisfactory arrangements were con-
cluded to develop the Mt. Newman
iron ore project. Through our sub-
sidiary, Dampier Mining Co. Ltd., we
will hold a 30 percent interest. We will
manage the undertaking during the
construction and initial operation phases
and for this purpose have formed a
wholly owned subsidiary company, Mt.
Newman Mining Co. Pty. Limited. The
main contracts have been let and con-
struction is now proceeding on schedule.
Deliveries of ore to Japan are
scheduled to commence in 1969, and
additional sales to this and other mar-
kets are being actively prospected.
SHIPBUILDING
The Whyalla Shipbuilding and
Engineering Works has been particu-
larlv active and I am pleased to record
an improvement in construction times.
Both the 54,000-ton bulk carrier
Bogong and the semi-submersible oil
rig Ocean Digger were completed
within a year of their keels being laid.
This is a tribute both to our own staff
and to the Japanese shipbuilders
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
Co. Ltd., with whom we have a techni-
cal agreement. The forward order posi-
tion at the shipyard is at present satis-
factory.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
As compared with the preceding year
our subsidiary companies in general
experienced improved trading con-
ditions. The Australian Wire Industries
Group increased their sales substantially,
although, towards the end of the period,
some weak spots developed. The Titan
Manufacturing Co. Pty. Ltd. had a
particularly good year with increases in
turnover over its full range of products.
Southern Portland Cement Ltd.
achieved record sales but at reduced
profitability and new facilities are being
installed to widen the product range
and reduce costs.
Commonwealth Steel Co. Ltd. has
had mixed results. Following the grant-
ing last year of temporary protective
duties, the stainless steel flat products
plant at Unanderra achieved record
production and sales. There is, however,
keen competition from imports for the
special steel products of the Waratah
plant. A Tariff Board hearing on these
products has concluded and we are now
awaiting the outcome.
RESEARCH
Our various research activities have
continued vigorously throughout the
year. Work commenced last month on
our new Melbourne research labora-
tories on a site near Monash Univer-
sity. The buildings will feature the use
of exposed universal beams and fabri-
cated sections of low alloy high strength
steel. This will be the first time these
products have been featured in a major
structure in this country.
The new laboratories will concentrate
on the development and testing of new
types of steel products and will con-
stitute a major extension of our research
programme.
MINERAL EXPLORATION
Our mineral exploration programme
has continued at a high level. Substan-
tial expenditure on exploration has been
a constant feature of our activities for
a great many years, but, as with
research, it is inevitable that long
periods will elapse without the occur-
rence of any substantial rewards.
Assessment of our nickel prospects at
Rockhampton is continuing in associa-
tion with The International Nickel Co.
of Canada Ltd., but it is not yet known
whether these lateritic deposits, which
are considerable in size, can be econo-
mically developed. Work is also pro-

back with his fill of excellent results
from a number of companies he’s
brought to our local stock exchange
lists. For instance, last week the W.A.
transport group Bell Bros., which he
floated here in 1965, rewarded him and
his clients by lifting the dividend from
10 to 12 percent as a result of a great
leap in profit from $609,660 to
$ 1,022,676, which made the earnings
cover a huge 46.5 percent or nearly
four times the higher dividend, com-
pared with 27.7 percent in the previous
year.
As we all know, an enormous quan-
tity of earth is being moved about in
W.A. these days and Bell Bros, seems
to find its share of the burden most re-
warding. In view of this it was also
rather intriguing to learn that one of
the subsidiary interests, a manganese
mine north of Meekatharra, was closed
down by the company last week because
of the W.A. Government’s recent big in-
creases in freight rates. The company is
meeting its Japanese manganese con-
tracts from another mine near Nulla-
gine.
ANOTHER OF Goode’s W.A. floats
also starting to move more money as
well as heavy material is Swan Quar-
ries. This has taken a good deal longer
than Bell Bros, to justify the broker’s
faith in it (it was floated in 1962, when
its quarry was still on the drawing
board, and a strong team of directors
came all the way from Melbourne to
Perth to tell the Press what a great
metal spreading lay ahead for it on
the W.A. railways). Anyway, its results
were very disappointing until this year,
when it made a profit of $104,141
compared with only $19,144 the year
before. Although there’s very little
interest in these shares, which are only
a cent or two above the 50 cent par
(at which they were floated), and no
dividends have yet been forthcoming,
we can probably take some heart (even
if the market doesn’t appear to be)
from the chairman’s expectation that
better ' results will be forthcoming
“when market stability has been
reached,” whatever that may portend.
At least he takes an optimistic view
in a prospectus recently issued for a
debenture issue to refund a note issue
maturing last weekend.
With its 17.8 percent profit rise this
year, Chamberlain Holdings, another
Perth firm floated by a Melbourne
broker, in this case Potter & Co. (AUC
took a quarter of the original issue),
early in 1963, has been commanding
rather more attention and has moved
up from a year’s low of 140 to around
the 200 cents marks to give the rather
parsimonious yield of 3.1 percent.
Dealing mainly with the farmers, this
maker of agricultural machinery,
including industrial tractors, has come
up well following the drought and last
year its sales of agricultural tractors
recovered by $1.3 million with two new
tractor types and a new seeder now
pathfinding for the company. On the
industrial side things aren’t moving as
smartly, the chairman intimated last
week, but last year’s record sales of
$15.7 million all told could well be
exceeded this year. There are black
spots about, apparently, in N.S.W. and
Southern Queensland, where tractor
sales have eased because of tightened
liquidity. Perhaps the market will now
call enough for a while, what with the
low yield and all.
THESE TWO BROKERS haven’t had
a monopoly of W.A. floats in Mel-
bourne. Also in the field in recent years.
John H. Robertson, Thompson & Co.,
got Bowra Holdings Ltd., which is in
a similar line of country to Chamber-
lain, off the ground in 1962. It hasn’t
blossomed to quite the same extent as
the latter in market favor. Even so, it
is a well-established, expanding (its
sales have climbed nearly threefold
since the float), and fairly profitable
show, whose shares have been fairly
steady on either side of 100 cents,
their latest price, this year. These shares
could well attract more attention.
Profit lifted nicely last year, from
$68,578 to $89,820, and when all the
new capital expenditure last year
(about $150,000) bears more fruit they
could go considerably higher. The
shares now yield around 6 percent and
with Chamberlain on 3.1 percent there
would appear to be some disparity to
attract discerning buyers.
ceeding at Mt. Monger in Western
Australia, but no mineralisation of
commercial significance has yet been
discovered. The Company is in the
course of finalising an arrangement
with a subsidiary of International
Nickel under which the latter has the
right to acquire a 50 percent interest
in the Mt. Monger area and similarly
our Company has the right to obtain
a 50 percent interest in several other
prospective areas now held by the Inco
subsidiary in the same general region.
We are encouraged by the extent and
quality of metallurgical coal reserves
indicated in the area of the Company’s
prospecting rights at Blackwater in
Queensland. These deposits could be a
useful source of coal for the steel
industry and for export. We have dis-
covered areas of bauxite in north-west
Western Australia near Kalumburu
Mission, but we do not know at this
stage whether this discovery is commer-
cially important.
INDUSTRIAL
During the year operations at the
Newcastle and Port Kembla Steelworks
were again disrupted for short periods
on several occasions by industrial dis-
putes. The report of the National
Stevedoring Industry Conference was
published last April, and the Govern-
ment has indicated its acceptance of the
main provisions relating to permanent
employment, pensions, redundancy and
other related matters. As we are the

Behind the balance sheets
Sweet reason at James Stedman
THERE IS PLENTY of life in the con-
fectionery business at present, what with
takeovers and price-cutting. But there
doesn’t seem much prospect of old-
established James Stedman Ltd. getting
very lively; it is just not that sort of
company.
There has certainly been nothing
lively about its profit performance for
the past four or five years; the latest
result of $628,000 was a bare $30,000
more than the 1962-63 profit. And in
the meantime its investment income
from its mounting portfolio has risen
by $43,000. So Stedman’s are now do-
ing $13,000 a year worse as a con-
fectionery company than four years ago.
Despite their interesting (and award-
winning) advertising campaign, there
seems little prospect that they will do
much better.
It is true that this year there could
be some rewards from the fact that the
past two years have borne what could
have been substantial costs of promot-
ing new packaging for the proprietary
Sweetacres lines, and new 20c packs
which are more suitable for impulse
buying from display racks which the
company is launching, tentatively, in
Victoria for a start. The old boxes
“traditionally” went behind the counter,
out of the customers’ reach. But the
best its chairman, Sydney accountant
Mr. Raymont Moore, hopes for is,
according to last week’s chairman’s
address, to “maintain its share of the
market,” which indicates only a very
modest improvement on last year’s per-
formance, when sales were only
■“slightly in excess” of the previous year.
For confectionery is not a very
dynamic business to be in; last year’s
three percent increase in total Austra-
lian production was about in a line with
the recent average. This slow rise in
sales has been despite some downward
pressure on prices from chain retailers.
But at the same time costs have been
increasing at a fast rate and the recent
15 percent sugar price rise is serious
enough for the company to be talking
about a possible price review this year,
although Stedman’s has been trying to
absorb rising costs by installing modern
equipment. Last year it spent $364,000
on new plant, equal to the previous
four years’ expenditure combined, and
provided some taxation relief that pre-
vented the net profit from falling by
any more than $2OOO. Tax was down by
$19,000.
But if James Stedman has an unspec-
tacular record as a confectionery maker,
it is not very different as an investor.
A portfolio of shares and debentures
built up largely since 1957, and of
Government bonds, had a mai’ket value
at 1967 balance date only $6576 more
than the $2,458,797 cost, although last
week the portfolio was worth $201,554
(8 percent) more than cost. Besides
this huge investment portfolio, the com-
pany had $1,137,478 in cash on hand,
in the bank, or on deposit, $276,000
more than the previous year because
the 1966 Australian tax had not been
paid at 1967 balance date. The return
from this $3,596,000 in investments and
cash was $131,654, admittedly tax-free,
but returning the company a negligible
yield of 3.7 percent.
Why should a confectionery manu-
facturer have such huge liquid funds
and portfolio investments? The oft-
repeated explanation is to “enable the
company to expand and diversify the
business should an opportunity arise.”
So far nothing has landed in Sted-
man’s lap, and the only excursion made
to expand and diversify was a hesitant
bid for Small’s Chocolate in 1961-62
after Life Savers made Small’s an
offer. Small’s directors recommended
Life Savers, and Stedman bowed out
of the contest.
Meantime, Stedman sits on cash and
readily liquidated assets of almost
$3.6m. (compared with s4.Bm. invested
in fixed assets, stocks, and debtors for
the chocolate business), earning far less
income compared with manufacturing,
showing only modest capital apprecia-
tion, and providing a target for any
marauding invader of the intensely com-
petitive sweets industry.
Besides Allen Holdings in Melbourne
with a similar product range (why
don’t they get together?), there is only
Life Savers left among the public
manufacturing confectioners now that
Mac. Robertson has succumbed to
Cadbury-Fry-Pascall after a hard-fought
battle against Mars Inc., of U.S.A.
(Life Savers, in contrast to Stedman,
has been wide awake to the oppor-
tunities around, and besides taking a
financial interest in Cook Confection-
ery in 1959, taking over the Master-
craft Chocolate group in 1960, and
then Small’s, is currently trying to
gobble up Hoadley’s very successful
chocolate business by a cash and share
offer.) Hoadley’s market value is over
the ssm. mark, which Stedman could
have raised with its cash and share
resources, plus, say, a share placement,
if it cared to overcome its inhibitions
about competing in chocolate with
Nestles, its distributor. But Stedman
has so far given no hint that it would
participate in another' confrontation
with Life Savers, and it has studiously
kept out of chocolates, even though this
has been a faster growing business than
other confectionery, so that would
appear to rule out any link with Darrel
Lea.
But who else is there for Stedman’s
to buy? The only prospect seems to be
the privately owned Scanlens group,
which has been talking of floating for
some years but which has once again
deferred doing so.
There seems little chance of Stedman
itself being taken over, although it is
a wonder that Nestles, Stedman’s ex-
clusive ' selling agents in Australia and
New Zealand until December, J 972, at
least, have not made an offer for Sted-
man; the opportunity seems too good
to miss. But the many Stedman des-
cendants between them are believed
to hold perhaps 20 percent of the issued
ordinary capital of just over $2.5m.
(preference capital is an additional
$200,000) and could call the tune.
Yet there is no doubt that all these
takeovers are giving added strength to-
Stedman’s rivals. In addition, Beatrice
Food Co., of Chicago, earlier this year
bought a controlling interest in Henry
Berry’s Red Tulip chocolate business,,
and has announced entry of the market
with some selected Beatrice Food con-
fectionery lines. So all around the
market is hotting up.
Stedman has concentrated on non-
chocolate lines primarily for children,
such as Minties, Marella Jubes,
Freckles, Milk Shakes, toffee, jellies,
T'hroaties, barley sugar, licorice, but
has some lines incorporating chocolate
such as Jaffas, Chocolateens, Fantales,
chocolate creams, and chocolate-coated
peanuts. Competition has never been
so intense, and is not likely to be any
easier this year, directors warned. The
company’s headquarters are at Rose-
bery (N.S.W.), where the Sweetacres

the Christmas shutdown. Since 1965
some goods have been packed at Car-

but trade debtors of $699,000, mostly
Nestles, represent about six weeks’ sales,
the chairman (Mr. Raymont Mopre)
explained at the annual meeting, which
places turnover at about s6.Bm. The
company set aside in 1964 $200,000 as
a specific reserve for development, but
this has since been transferred to
general reserve.
In New Zealand the company has a
factory which is currently hampered by
import restrictions in its supplies of
raw materials. The 1967 turnover was
not quite up to 1966 level, but N.Z.
still made a substantial profit. N.Z.
expects record turnover and profit-
ability in 1967-68.
The company has grown over the
years without calling on shareholders
for funds. The formation of the pre-
sent holding company was effected by
giving shareholders of James Stedman
Henderson’s Sweets Ltd. a one-for-one
bonus in October, 1959 (the first capi-
tal change in 44 years), and share-
holders received a one-for-five bonus in
September, 1966. Under Mr. Raymont
Moore’s chairmanship directors have
established a policy of paying a “reason-
able dividend” of 15 percent (always
amply covered by earnings) and invest-
ing the surplus in stock exchange
securities. There are no intangibles in
the balance sheet, no liabilities except
current liabilities and provisions, giving
a proprietorship ratio of 84 percent.
Freeholds and plant are conservatively
valued.
At $1.70 an investor is buying in-
come yield of 4.4 percent, earnings
yield of 7.0 percent. The shares have
been 30c higher and 50c lower this
year. The balance sheet is a model of
solidity and liquidity, thanks to the
board’s obsession with security and con-
servatism. But for dynamic growth an
investor would have to look elsewhere;
the company’s capital structure has been
moving faster than profits for some
time, and this sort of thing has its
limits.

Alcan adds ideas to
aluminium to make
building sheet that's
thicker, wider,stronger,
cooler...and warmer.
Under a roof of Alcan's aluminium building sheet this summer, you'll find
yourself up to fifteen degrees cooler. (Come winter, you'll find it about
fifteen degrees more snug.) Yet at Alcan, we think of this insulation simply
as a side benefit. It's something you get, knowing you've got a roof that'll
last a lifetime without maintenance. Patent weatherproof sidelap design ;
distinctively embossed pattern ; wider sheets for faster work. This is Alcan
building sheet; good for homes because it lasts a lifetime. Good for weekend
handyman jobs because it's easier to work with.
THE ALCAN ACE-SPEEDLINE RAINWATER SYSTEM. More efficient pipes
and guttering that don't need maintenance. Easier to install (you could do it
yourself). Compatible with any kind of roof. Ask about them.

Security analyst’s latest “mixed” group
Most of these shares now
rather over-priced
THE LATEST industry grouping, com-
prising chemicals, paper, glass, and
rubber, would probably have been better
named “miscellaneous.” There is very
little that is homogeneous about the
various companies included in the group
and only two of the seven companies
would appear to have anything at all
in common. They are Australian News-
print and APM, which both make
paper albeit for quite different pur-
poses. A lot can happen in seven weeks
—especially at this time of the year
when companies are reporting—so in
the first instance we will look at the
price changes which have occurred
since the end of June.

(a) 1-1-1967 to 30-6-1967.
From these figures, it could be said
that the market is reaffirming its faith
in Commonwealth Industrial Gases,
Australian Newsprint, and Dunlop
Rubber, but seems to have become dis-
enchanted with the prospects for Aus-
tralian Consolidated Industries, Drug
Houses of Australia, Imperial Chemical
Industries of Australia and New Zea-
land, and Australian Paper Manufac-
turers. I propose to look at each com-
pany again and see whether the situa-
tion has been changed in the medium-
to long-term by any recent announce-
ment.
AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED
INDUSTRIES: The chairman’s
address, in discussing the prospects for
the coming year, referred to the need
for more capital (but did not suggest
how it might be raised), the fact that
consolidated results for the first five
months of 1967/8 were down on the
same period of 1966/7, and that the
profit for the full year was expected to
be the same as for 1966/7 approx-
imately. In themselves these facts do
not have any medium-term implications
that could be regarded as adverse.
Some concern must be felt, however,
that costs are rising and margins are
narrowing in several areas; the main
concern is that this is also occurring
in flat glass as a result of overseas com-
petition.
If earnings are about the same next
year, the trend in per share earnings
will take on a cyclical pattern rather
than a growth pattern and it will be
necessary to decide whether a price-
earnings ratio of more than, say, 15.5
is reasonable. This would mean that a
price of more than $3.10 could over-
value the shares.
COMMONW EALTH INDUS-
TRIAL GASES: The share price for
CIG seems to have edged upwards on
the improved prospects for manufac-
turing industry generally. If the fore-
cast of about 18 cents per share for
1966/7 earnings is correct, the shares
are now selling at 15.6 times expected
earnings. As the company doesn’t bal-
ance until September 30, it will be some
little while yet before we know the
answer. This in itself may be a bull
point so far as the share price is con-
cerned in the very short term. After
the end of November, the price will be
affected by the preliminary figures for
1966/7. At this stage, I think that a
modest degree of over-pricing exists and
$2.60 seems an appropriate value for
DRUG HOUSES OF AUSTRALIA:
Pre-tax profit slipped slightly in 1966/7,
but as ordinary capital was in-
creased during the year by an issue
of 110,200 $1 shares at $1.60, per share
earnings declined rather more.
Again it appeal’s that rising costs
“eroded to a large degree” the benefits
which were obtained from an increase
in sales. Reference is made in the
general manager’s report to “consistent
price reduction” and it must be assumed
that this will continue to be a feature
of the distribution of pharmaceuticals.
ICIANZ: After continuing a slow
rise, the price of the shares seem to have
slipped recently. There is no apparent
reason for this, so far as I am aware,
and it could be merely the realisation
of the high price which was being paid
in terms of current dividends and earn-
ings.
AUSTRALIAN NEWSPRINT
MILLS: The fact that the prelim-
inary profit announcement for
1966/7 indicated a fall in
profit does not seem to have affected
the rise in the price of Australian
Newsprint’s shares. The last sale at
the moment is still $4.15 and the buyer
is offering this price with no seller.
AUSTRALIAN PAPER MANU-
FACTURERS: The price of the shares
has fallen about 5 percent over the
last fortnight and again there is no
particular reason that I can see. It
could be an awareness of the problem
of narrowing margins, as in the case
of ACI, which has caused investors to
mark down the price that they feel
worthwhile for APM’s shares.
DUNLOP RUBBER: The continuing
rise in the price of this company’s
shares was to be expected in view of
the preliminary profit announcement.
Dunlop was fairly heavily tipped as a
recovery stock and it has certainly
recovered in terms of the share price,
now 58 percent above the low price
for the year.
While comparisons of these leaders
may not be very meaningful, indices
of earnings and dividends per share
are always of some interest when look-
ing at the current share price. Because
the 1967 annual reports are not avail-
able for all the companies in the group,
the indices cover the five-year period
from 1962 to 1966 inclusive:
Earnings per share
Year 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
AC I 100 106 109 122 123
CIG 100 106 113 103 77
DHA 100 85 52 62 66-
ICIANZ 100 99 98 81 68
Aust. Newsprint 100 102 100 92 77
APM 100 98 ■ 103 100 94
Dunlop Rubber 100 117 118 105 69
Dividends per share
A C I 100 108 11-7 130 130
CIG 100 100 100 100 124
DHA 100 100 100 89 89
ICIANZ 100 108 113 115 116
Aust. Newsprint 100 104 110 110 110
APM 100 106 106 111 114
Dunlop Rubber 100 100 142 129 136
The most surprising factor which
emerges from these indices is that the
earnings per share of every company
with the exception of AC I is lower in
1966 than in the “recession” year of
1961-62. In five cases the fall is quite
substantial, but in two cases (CIG and
Dunlop Rubber) it would seem that
1965/6 was a special year.
We must now look again at the share
price of each company in relation to
earnings and dividends and because of
the difficulty in most cases of esti-
mating future earnings, we must settle
for the current earnings figure:
Comp. Last sale Earnings Dividends Div. P/E

ACI 349 20 0 10 0 2 9 17.4
CIG 280 18 0 (a) 11 0 3.9 15 6

Dunlop
Rubber 182 11.0 (b) 85 47 16.6
(a) estimate based on 1966/7 half-yearly report.
(b) estimate based on preliminary profit report.
From these figures, Drug Houses
would seem to be the only company
which is not expected to show any
growth in per share earnings over the
next five years. All the others are ex-
pected to show growth of a varying
degree from 18 percent per annum
average compound in the case of
ICIANZ to six percent in the case of
Commonwealth Industrial Gases. The
record of the past five years would in
no way encourage such optimism.
So far as ACI is concerned, the
chairman has already predicted little
or no growth in the current year, so
growth will need to be of the order of
12 percent per annum in the next four
years to catch up. CIG, APM, and
Dunlop Rubber are very roughly in the
same category, with rather more growth
expected from Dunlop than from CIG.
ICIANZ and Australian Newsprint are
expected to show growth in earnings of
quite a high order.
Of this mixed group, I would say
that ICIANZ and Australian Newsprint
are probably over-priced at current
levels. Despite the fact that DHA does
not seem to have very good growth
prospects in the future, these prospects
are probably rather better than the price
suggests. In other words, DHA may be
a little under-priced. The remaining
companies are perhaps priced a little on
the high side, which is not unlikely
when the level of share prices generally
is on the high side.


Uninspiring, says the Chartist
ACI can give growth, and
Dunlop recovery
THE STOCKS UNDER technical review are uninspiring
except for ACI, which represents growth, and Dunlop,
recovery. Certainly investors would be wise to avoid APM,
CIG, and DHA until there is more evidence to support a
reversal of trend. ICI has recovery potential of a cyclical
nature, but should only be purchased on a reaction. Any
new uptrend will be considerably slowed by persistent re-
sistance selling. The performance of the individual stocks
can be directly compared with All Ordinary Index No. 15
since 1960; it should be pointed out that BHP is responsible
for most of the rise since May of this year.
ACI was recommended as a technical buy in June when
prices were about $3.18. The first target of about $3.60 was
achieved and the high point of $3.70 was recorded recently.
At this level it encountered resistance selling from the 1962
“top” and the normal reaction is now under way, possibly
back to about $3.20 to a further buy position. The overall
picture strongly suggests a renewal of the growth phase for
this stock and targets of $4.80 and $7.60 for the longer-term
are indicated by the base consolidation. Last sale price on
26/9/67—53.48.
AUSTRALIAN NEWSPRINT was first reviewed with the
paper stocks in March, 1966, when it was still in a down-
trend but appeared to be near penetration. Prices have since
moved in a 'slow 10 percent uptrend to $4.20 during the
current week. It is now approaching the $4.50 level, where
fairly strong resistance selling would be expected from the
range of trading in that area both from 1960 and 1963.
The situation would call for reassessment should prices move
above the resistance level in the short term. Last sale price on
26/9/67—54.20.
APM appears “bearish” than “bullish” at the present
time, when compared with the overall general “bullish” tone
of the market. After the 33 percent uptrend and top forma-
tion in 1964, a general sideways movement has been followed
in a rectangle-type formation. However, the price movements
during 1967 have broken downside from the base of the
rectangle and the stock appears to be settling into a down-
trend; the probability of a decline to approximately $1.15
must be considered. Last sale price on 26/9/67 —$1.47.
CIG is in an extremely interesting, technical situation at
present. It is “testing” the major downtrendline at $2.80
and should not be bought until this is broken on sufficient
volume. In the event of a break topside, the recovery would
be to about $4.00. Prices have been as low as $2.05 this
year and it could well remain in the downtrend for some
time. Until market action justifies purchase on technical
grounds, the stock should be avoided by investors. Last sale
price on 26/9/67 —$2.71.
DHA is certainly a stock to be avoided by investors at
present. The stock had very little to recommend it on tech-
nical grounds as early as 1962, when prices were around
the $3.90 level, as a “topping” situation became evident. A
decline of major proportions continued and a low of $1.50
was achieved about the middle of 1956. A rectangle-type
base with a resistance level at $1.92 was forming until the
sharp drop to $1.45 during the current month. A pullback
rally has occurred and the fall could continue to about $1.15.
This is a stock lacking support levels back to 1960, which
makes it extremely vulnerable. Last sale price on 26/9/67
—51.58.
DUNLOP RUBBER was recommended as a recovery
situation at the $1.66 level. It has recently risen in price to
$1.90 and is now well away from a technical buying position.
The base consolidation suggests an eventual recovery to
about $2.40, which would be a strong resistance level created
by the 1964 “top” formation. The overall picture suggests
rather a cyclical situation at present. Last sale price on
26/9/67—51.81.
ICl—The growth appears to have gone of this market
leader and it could now be regarded as a cyclical issue.
The downtrend which commended early 1965 was pene-
trated at the beginning of 1967 and the base consolidation
suggests an eventual recovery to about the $2.90 level, where
it would encounter strong resistance selling both .from the
1960 and 1964 range of trading in that area. Some short-term
reaction possibly to about $1.85 could be expected from the

ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN
Thirteenth Annual General Meeting, 1967
The first half of the year proved to be dis-
appointing. Sales did not reach the budgeted
level, and this, together with heavy develop-
ment expense on new brands, caused a sub-
stantial fall in profit for this period.
However, in the second six months, bene-
fits started to show from what had been
done. Sales were noticeably more stable,
with growth showing in several sectors,
including new brands. As a result, the sales
budget for this period was exceeded and the
profit was more in keeping with previous
years—a considerable improvement on the
first half of the year.
It will thus be apparent that the year’s
results were heavily affected by the first six
months’ results, and the Board felt it had
no other option than to follow the prudent
course of reducing the dividend for this year.
Nevertheless I hope you will give the
Board credit for its courage and resolution
in attacking the marketing situation.
I have pointed out in previous years that
the cost of establishing new brands is con-
siderable in this highly-competitive market.
A sustained effort is required because it may
take three years or more before a brand
attains the desired volume, though it is often
profitable from an early stage. The signifi-
cant fact is that there can be no guarantee
of success, and that is why we write off
immediately the costs of establishment and
development. If this cost were spread over
a period of years, it could become a drain
on future profits should the expected results
not emerge, and it could also create a reluct-
ance to incur expenditure of this kind at a
future time when necessary. In essence,
then, the money we have deliberately spent
this year is an investment for the Company’s
future security and profitability.
FK259.107.97L


The Directors’ Report sets out fully what
has been done to spread our range of pro-
ducts, and to meet the demands of the mar-
ket place.
It is, of course, too early to assess posi-
tively what results will flow from these
activities, but the six months to June, 1967,
gave encouraging signs and I am pleased
to be able to say that July and August of
this year show up better than last year in
both sales and profits. I believe we are on
the right track, though I do not want to
make firm assertions at this stage.
Despite the setback in the first half of the
1967 year, it is timely to remind ourselves
of the strengths we have.
We enjoy a high volume of sales. We
have the two biggest selling brands, which
have stood successfully against violent com-
petition. We dominate the quality and pre-
mium price sectors, which are now the areas
of greatest growth. We are penetrating the
medium price field and expect to eat further
into this in the coming year.
We have taken the initiative in new pro-
duct concepts, such as the luxury length
cigarette and the gold band filter, as well as
in forms of packaging such as are pictured
in the Report. We produce top quality pro-
£■
ducts with competitive advantages; and not
least of all, we have a powerful, skilful
organisation which really works hard. Lead-
ership in marketing ideas is a basic require-
ment for marketing success —we will gain
if we do things better than our competitors.
The Company’s financial position is
sound. Its liquid resources are satisfactory,
and its reserves and undivided profits exceed
its paid-up capital. We expect this situation
to become even stronger in this year.
The investments we have made are prov-
ing very satisfactory, and though they have
not made any material contribution to the
Company’s profits as yet, they are each
showing satisfactory operating results.
In regard to dividends, it should be noted
that, even at the reduced rate, we are still
paying the highest rate of any listed tobacco
stocks in Australia, but I would not like
existing or potential investors to assume
that the more encouraging outlook will
necessarily lead to an increase in the divi-
dend rate for the oncoming year. The
Board’s first duty is to ensure the Company
has the resources it needs for the successful
conduct of its business, and the dividend
rate will be decided according to the profits
earned and the outlook for sales and profits
at the time. However, we have shown in the
past that we are not unmindful of giving as
much benefit as practicable to the current
shareholder, compatible with prudent opera-
tion of the business.
What I have said amounts to this. On a
realistic view, the measure of success which
seems to be emerging makes us disposed to
have at least cautious confidence as to the
future. The way in which we are now org-
anised and operating is giving us much
stronger fighter power. The vigorous efforts
we are making deserve success. Given your
support, we will do so much better.

Mining
Planet seeks wealth off-shore
THE AUSTRALIAN coastlines are not
nearly so well endowed with sunken
treasure ships as are the coasts of the
British Isles or the Caribbean Islands.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable
amount of money being spent by both
local and overseas companies on the
search for mineral wealth sunk in the
off-shore waters surrounding the coast-
line of Australia. BHP’s eminently suc-
cessful oil and gas finds off the coast
of Victoria are but one example of
this search, which is directed to many
other minerals besides petroleum. The
geological support for off-shore mineral
exploration in Australia is backed by
the success of similar ventures overseas.
In Malaysia and Thailand, off-shore tin
dredges have been operating for many
years; dredging the continental shelf
for diamonds off the west coast of South
Africa has also been a payable proposi-
tion, as it has been for gold off the
coast of Alaska.
The geological and topographical
features of Australia are particularly
attractive to the prospect that deposits
of minerals may be found on the seabed
off-shore. The erosion evidenced by the
lack of high mountains and the arid
climate indicate that there has been in
the past, i.e., several thousand years
ago, a significant amount of sediment
deposited in the locality of former
coastlines. Just as beach-sand minerals
such as rutile and ilmenite are found
in deposits along the present coastline,
so it is thought likely that similar
deposits will be found along the coast-
lines of former times, which are now
many fathoms deep. In the case of
alluvial minerals like tin and gold it is
thought possible that the old riverbeds,
themselves sunk at the same level as
the former coastlines, will contain de-
posits of commercial significance.
The existence of mineralised areas
in mountainous regions adjacent to the
present-day coastline has attracted to
Australia more than 15 groups of
companies to engage in mineral explora-
tion in off-shore areas. In several ex-
ploration programs these companies
have been joined by local enterprises.
In February, 1966, EZ Industries
entered into a joint venture to prospect
for tin and phosphates in off-shore areas
around the coast of Tasmania. The
other members of this venture are Anglo
American Corporation of South Africa
Ltd., the Consolidated Mines Selection
Company Ltd., the Bethlehem Steel
Corporation, Ocean Science &
Engineering Inc., and Ocean Mining
AG. The progam is being conducted
by Ocean Mining AG, an affiliate of
the Ocean Science Group, which played
a major part in mining off-shore de-
posits of diamonds in Africa and gold
in Alaska. EZ Industries on its own
account is also drilling for phosphates
at the mouth of the Murchison River,
near Geraldton, W.A.
Among the other off-shore prospec-
tors are included Placer Development
(off New South Wales), Ampol Mining,
Wyong Minerals (now a subsidiary of
Associated Minerals), Global Marine,
(the large off-shore oil-drilling contrac-
tor), Phosphate Exploration Pty. Ltd.,
BP Minerals Pty. Ltd., and the Planet
group. Planet Gold Ltd., in addition
to its leases in Victoria, has off-shore
leases off the coast of New South Wales
stretching from Batemans Bay to the
Victorian border. As long ago as 1880-
deposits were discovered on the coast,
consisting of gold which had been
washed back on shore by the sea. In
June this year Planet Gold had com-
pleted preliminary exploration by skin-
divers and photography, and a trawler
left Sydney equipped to take bulk
samples of up to 30 feet of the sea-
bed. This trawler is capable of drilling
40 holes a week, and after testing this
area was used for similar work along
the north coast of Tasmania, where a
sister company, Planet Metals Ltd.,
hopes to find deposits of tin, gold, or
platinum.
Planet Metals Ltd., which was formed
at the same time as Planet Gold Ltd.
in October last year, has off-shore leases
along the coast of Queensland and
northern New South Wales in addition
to its Tasmanian lease. In all of these
areas an interest is also held by Ocean
Mineral Surveys Pty. Ltd., who have
an interest in the leases held by Planet
Gold off-shore in New South Wales.
The Planet group has also obtained
rights over the seabed off the west coast
of New Zealand’s South Island. In
experimental drilling early this year,
Planet Metals intersected heavy min-
erals averaging 1 percent over a length
of 15ft. in two out of three holes drilled
off-shore just north of the Tweed River
in southern Queensland. These holes
were drilled two to three miles offshore

in 60ft. of water and were cored
through 30ft. of sand. Likely minerals
in this area would be rutile, zircon,
and ilmenite, and possibly tin and gold.
A drilling program was commenced in
June to test these leases, following the
earlier sample corings.
Should any of the leases held by the
Planet group or the other participants
in off-shore exploration contain com-
mercial quantities of minerals, the
actual mining would be done by the
use of sea-going dredges. For relatively
shallow depths ladder bucket dredges
of the type used to extract alluvial tin
and gold would be practical, with modi-
fications, and the cutter suction dredges
used by beach-sand miners would also
be used. For deeper deposits “clam-
shell” wire-line dredges would be re-
quired. As with any dredging operation,
the throughput would have to be quite
substantial, but unit costs per yard
could well be quite reasonable. The
mobility provided by off-shore opera-
tions also allows the economic extrac-
tion of a group of small deposits which
could not be mined as cheaply on land
due to the cost of moving plant.
Planet Oil Company N.L., which
sponsored the formation of Planet Gold
and Planet Metals, retains a 50 per-
cent share interest in both companies
through its wholly owned subsidiary
Planet Mining Company Pty. Limited.
Planet Oil itjelf has two off-shore ex-
ploration leases off the coast on the
south-west corner of Western Australia.
One of these, stretching from Perth to
Bunbury, is likely to contain deposits of
ilmenite, while the other, which is
along the southern portion of the coast
around Albany, is considered as a likely
prospect for phosphate. In both of these
leases Ocean Mineral Surveys Pty. Ltd.
retains a 12|- percent interest. The
Planet group has three vessels currently
engaged in off-shore prospecting work,
one on the central coast of N.S.W. near
Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbor and
two in the area of Tweed Heads.
Although the group’s interests are still
quite speculative, it has been able to
line up some eminently conservative
associates. The Colonial Sugar Refining
Company Limited has an option to
acquire 30 percent of the capital of
Planet Oil and this option also extends
into Planet Metals and Planet Gold.
CSR already owns 400,000 shares in
Planet Oil. Last month the Australian
Gas Light Company agreed to support
the group in a search for oil gas arid
minerals in north western N.S.W. It
will provide about $500,000 to meet the
cost of two wells, to earn a 50 percent
working interest in the area. Although
the wells to be drilled are for oil or
gas, they will also provide information
concerning suspected evaporite minerals
including sulphur, potash, and phos-
phate. Planet Metal and Planet Gold
both hold an interest in a mineral
lease covering the same general area.

Commodities
Copper responds to
demand pressure
AUSTRALIAN COPPER producers
have responded to the overseas pricing
situations. So the domestic selling price
has gone up $5O to $lOOO a ton —its
first rise in 1967. At one stage last year
the local price reached $1250 a ton.
To prevent any unseemly rush
toward more attractive exports, the
Copper Producers’ Association of Aus-
tralia usually plans to hold its price
$3O or so higher than London Metal
Exchange prices. There spot levels are
now standing around £stg.394 for wire
bars.
Within Australia, Mount Isa, Mount
Lyall, and Broken Hill South’s Cobar
subsidiary will take most of the benefit,
since most of their production is sold
domestically at the Australian producer
price.
There is no doubt at all where the
overseas pressures are coming from.
The U.S. copper strike has now lasted
nearly three months and has resulted
in the loss of more than 250,000 tons.
An estimated world surplus of 140,000
tons has been completely overpassed.
Demand also has tended to pick up
since the strike started and has had to
struggle against reduced stocks.
Some market observers would not
be surprised if LME prices hit £stg4oo
a ton. Indeed, if the strike is pro-
longed, they talk of a “price explosion,”
especially in the light of the lately
increased demand, and the parties to
the strike don’t appear to be getting
any closer to mutual grounds of settle*
ment.
Perhaps the position should be seen
as almost entirely short-term. To be
held in mind, for example, are the
predictions of Sir Ronald Prain, chair-
man of the Roan Selection Trust. He
expects sizeable rises in production
every year to 1972.
AUSTRALIAN SUGAR growers must
be viewing the approach of formal
meetings between Britain and the Euro-
pean Economic Community with some
dubiousness, to say the least. There
seems plenty of ground for differences
of opinion on what could happen to the
relevant sugar agreements, both Com-
monwealth and International.
In London last week, Mr. A. S.
Wingate-Saul, a director of the world’s
largest refiner, maintained that con-
tinuation of the Commonwealth agree-
ment should be negotiated after Britain
enters the Common Market. That
would assuredly be in accord with
Prime Minister Wilson’s hope that Bri-
tain’s existing preferential imports
could be almost entirely preserved.

and Technology” has just come out
with an article arguing that the only
possibility of special treatment for the
Australian sugar industry lies in revival
of the International Sugar Agreement.
That, of course, lapsed in 1961 when
Cuba objected to limitation of exports;
a conference to attempt renewal will
take place in April next year.
“The Times” article, written by Mr.
D. J. Morgan of London University,
compares the situations of Australia
and developing countries like Fiji and
Mauritius. Mr. Morgan suggests that
the EEC might not consider Queens-
land as being on a par with the ac-
cepted developing economies.
Once Britain was in the Market, it
could well happen that any assistance
given to Australian sugar would apply
for a transitional period only. Queens-
land’s eventual salvation may rest in its
low costs of production.
FORWARD ZINC PRICES on the
London Metal Exchange, at around
£stg.94 a ton, are uncomfortably below
spot prices of about £96. This position
lends credence to talk of a further re-
duction in the producer price, which
was brought down from £lO2 to £9B
in June.
Zinc has not been in particularly
good demand in recent months and
there is likelihood of the producers
bringing their price down to £94. Con-
tinuance of the Ford motor strike in
America must be of considerable con-
cern to U.S. producers. Any reduction
in American prices would almost cer-
tainly lead to a cut in the U.K.
Hanging over the situation in
America is a fear that other car makers
may also be facing strikes. Car manu-
facturers normally require large quanti-
ties of zinc for die castings, yet speedily
reduce their supplies in these kind of
emergencies.
World stocks of slab zinc (unsold)
have been increasing. At the end of
July they were estimated at 300,000
tons 34,000 tons more than at the
start of 1967.
It is generally believed that mine
capacity will continue to move ahead
of consumption until 1968. Then,
according to producer forecasts, the ex-
tra capacity should be needed. In the
meantime there are not lacking many
voices who tell producers that more
attention to marketing and product
development could be of great benefit.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Although the Sydney all ordinaries index closed at another
peak, most of the final improvement could be put down to a
few prominent mining stocks; the body of industrials still looks
a little uneasy. BHP’s drop of 15 cents to $13.20 didn’t provide
its usual stimulation. Among leaders, however, CSR put on
25 cents to finish at $4.33. The Bank of N.S.W., after earlier
advances, shed 18 cents and ended at $5.92. Thiess added a
further five cents and J. Fielding 20 cents. The chief mining
rises were: Mount Isa /up 15 cents), New BH (up 18 cents),
Hamersley (up 34 cents), and CRA (up 65 cents).

THE LAND
Co-operate on fertilisers
THE KIND of co-operation between
CSIRO and ACF and Shirleys Fer-
tilizers Ltd., announced last week, is
becoming more and more necessary if
grave mistakes in the greatly expanded
use of nitrogenous fertilisers are to be
avoided. Here is an area where rela-
tively little research, either academic-
ally or commercially inspired, has been
performed in Australia. Bounty-assisted
and clearly a candidate for the “hard
sell,” nitrogen is set to become a glamor
fertilising agent. Its exact properties as
affecting sundry types of pasture im-
provement must be thoroughly explored.
Apart from some laudable assis-
tance embracing supply and labor, ACF
and Shirleys is to work closely with
the Division of Tropical Pasture in
Queensland. Three important field ex-
periments will be initiated on research
stations at Beerwah and Narayen.
Beerwah’s investigations concern especi-
ally beef production from the high-
rainfall Wallum grasses; Narayen is to
build upon earlier findings on sown
pastures in spear grass and brigalow
regions.
Strange as it may seem, it is a
matter of urgency to provide a range
of quite elementary answers to a host
of questions, and for varying climates,
on fertiliser response of both animals
and pastures. It is greatly to be hoped
that considerable attention will also be
given to the economic, as well as the
scientific, implications of possible fer-
tiliser programs and usages.
A potential division of opinion on
cost benefits, or the reverse, became
quite apparent at the recent symposium
on new concepts in the use of fertilisers
held at Sydney University. That gather-
ing heard a CSIRO pasture research
official, Mr. W. M. Willoughby, assure
woolgrowers that the use of nitrogen
fertilisers could double the difficulties
besetting their industry. Then he added
a blanket statement that “in the com-
mon Australian experience of legume-
based pastures, the use of nitrogenous
fertiliser appeared a most uneconomic
proposition for the livestock industries.”
Came Mr. J. G. Schroder, general
manager of Australian Fertilizers, to
tell the self-same symposium that “Aus-
tralia’s agricultural future in the south
depended on the increasing use of
nitrogen and potash as well as phos-
phorous,” arguing, too, that “the world
wants food not fibre.”
Whatever conclusions scientific re-
search or economics may draw, Austra-
lia is well on the way to being provided
with a hugely enhanced volume of
nitrogenous fertilisers, indeed of all
chemically based fertilisers. Nitrogen
plants are to be sited at Kwinana
(W.A.), Walsh Island (N.S.W.), and
at Brisbane. By 1970 a sevenfold in-
crease in the usage of nitrogenous fer-
tiliser is planned by its makers. It
is high time for its exact and economic
application to be established.
IT HAS BECOME almost impossible
these days for’ a young man to start
himself off as a farmer, of any variety,
because of the increasing amount of
original capital required. It may soon
get just as difficult, at least in New
South Wales, for a youth to obtain the
kind of grass-roots rural education
which makes him immediately valuable
to a farmer-employer. At least that’s
one conclusion to be drawn from the
projected raising of the entry standards
into Hawkesbury and Wagga Agri-
cultural Colleges.
From 1970 the minimum entry re-
quirement will be a Higher School Cer-
tificate with passes in English and
science, and a School Certificate level
pass in mathematics. At present the
entry demand is for a School Certi-
ficate pass in five subjects.
In extenuation of the new arrange-
ment, the N.S.W. Minister for Agri-
culture, Mr. W. A. Chaffey, explains
that the proportion of students begin-
ning at the two colleges and later tak-
ing up farming has consistently dropped
over the past ten years. Most of the
diplomates find themselves adopting ex-
tension or advisory careers, or moving
into rurally oriented companies.
Of course intending “practical”
farmers may still take these courses.
And they are reminded that a one-year
Farm Certificate course is available at
Yanco Agricultural College.
While the merits of the regulation
look very commendable in terms of the
widening demand for advisory and ex-
tension services, they should not be
allowed to obscure the claims of basic
and elementary agricultural education.
Agrisearch
Phalaris: the celebrated grass
IMPROVED PASTURES have enabled
the sheep population to rise at the rate
of a million a year for the past 50
years. Plans to add another 50 million
or more before the end of the century
can only be realised by establishing
even more highly productive pastures
on more country. Up till now we have
depended on just one strain of perennial
phalaris grass to fuel a large propor-
tion of the increased numbers of sheep
and cattle. Several new strains of this
stout species are now undergoing final
tests on a number of field stations across
the southern half of the continent. Some
of the new selections will let pasture
improvement advance miles beyond the
existing frontiers and others will lift
yields within the present zones.
First to be released for commercial
sowing will be “Sirocco” phalaris. The
name is compounded from phonemes in
the words “Csiro” and “Morocco.” The
original strain was found in 20in. rain-
fall country on the north coast of
Morocco by a plant exploration party
sent overseas by CSIRO in 1951. This
party consisted of Professor C. M.
Donald, now at the University of Ade-
laide, and Mr. J. Franklin Miles. They
prospected all round the Mediter-
ranean and brought back 1700 different
grasses and legumes, which included 30
types of phalaris. A second expedition
by Mr. C. Neal-Smith added another
97 to the collection and in 1956 Mr.
D. E. Symon, of the Waite Agricultural
Research Institute, found some more in
Crete and around about that end of the
sea. These people were genuine ex-
plorers because, at the time, none of
the many Mediterranean countries
appreciated the potential value of
phalaris as a cultivated pasture species.
They do now after seeing what Aus-
tralia has done with it.
The big thing about Sirocco is that
it will flourish in country beyond the
17in. rainfall isohyet, which marks the
extreme range of the current Australian
commercial variety. Its drought re-
sistance is based on its capacity to re-
main dormant over the long, dry
summer. Instead, it makes good growth
in winter and early spring. The north
coast of Morocco gets only half an
inch of rain for the whole summer
period of four months. Seed for com-
mercial sowings will be released through
the Departments of Agriculture in New
South Wales, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia. No date has been promised, but

judging from the progress of the tests
some could be available after next year’s
harvest.
Closely similar to Sirocco are two
other promising strains. (We should be
referring to these different lines as
“cultivars,” which is the modern jar-
gon for “strains” and “varieties.”) They
came from the 8-10 in. country in
southern Morocco and are expected to
provide better grazing in the more ex-
treme environments of Western Aus-
tralia and inland New South Wales.
Three cultivars from Algeria and one
from southern Spain are not so dormant
in summer and respond to summer
rains. They have been tested in north-
western New South Wales and in the
more favored parts of the wheat-belt
in Western Australia, where they have
performed well.
In addition, among the new selec-
tions are others that suit the high rain-
fall country better than our old phalaris.
A late-flowering, broad-leaved type
from Portugal is said to be doing well
at several places in Victoria. Another
that came from high country in north-
western Greece, where the rainfall is
around 40in., has averaged 67 per-
cent more winter feed over the past
three years than Australian phalaris at
Rutherglen. South Australia is backing
an Italian line for its better-watered
country.
Apart from this lot, further back in
the development program . are many
more which have been bred by cross-
ing distinct types among the original
collection. From these, no doubt, other
cultivars will be selected and in due
course, perhaps within the next ten
years, there should be a wide range
of phalaris grasses from which farmers
can pick to suit their particular re-
quirements.
We can rest assured that phalaris
will be in the news often in future.
Why the present progress has not stirred
up greater enthusiasm is somewhat
surprising. Sirocco alone will bring im-
proved pasture to 10,000 square miles
at very least. And the greatly increased
winter yields of the cultivars from
Portugal and Greece in the cool moist
districts are of considerable significance,
too. Perhaps enthusiasm is being
damped by the fact that none of the
new grasses appears to have been tested
under grazing. So far only the results
of mowing trials have been published.
It is also rumored that the cultivar
Seedmaster, which was released with
some fanfare a couple of years ago, is
not living up to expectations.
Be all that as it may, phalaris is
destined to become the celebrated grass
of Australia. Only 30 years ago there
would not have been more than a few
hundred acres of it. Now there are mil-
lions. It is fascinating to recall that the
first importation before the turn of the
century was thrown out and had to
be rescued from the refuse dump in
the Toowoomba Botanic Gardens.


ART AND ENTERTAINMENT
After the golden age
By APRIL HERSEY
IN A QUAINT house three storeys
high in a charming street in the East
Sixties of New York, Sumner Locke
Elliott, for ten years an American citi-
zen, which gives him the right “not to
vote for Johnson next time,” is at work
on his third novel.
With “Careful He Might Hear You”
a world success and “Some Doves and
Pythons” lifting him over the lateau
of the second book, he works meticu-
lously at a beautiful desk beside
windows which look out at the homes
of other writers, actors, and television
people. Barbara Bel Geddes lives across
the road and the Aly Khan has his
city address nearby.
Elliott himself has almost given up
television writing since most of the
shows are produced in Hollywood and
he is devoted to New York, but his
recollections of the early days of tele-
vision writing in the United States
sound a little like the struggles in Aus-
tralia today.
Arriving in New York in 1949 after
a considerable amount of radio writing
in Australia, he found he was in the
fortunate position of being on the door-
step right at the beginning of tele-
vision. Though “Rusty Bugles,” which
he now regards as “only a museum
piece,” was his only successful play
(and he had tried many others), he
had worked for years with Doris Fitton
at the Independent Theatre, both as a
writer and an actor and could under-
stand what was expected in the new
audio-visual medium.
“I was aware of the ramifications of
getting past radio, which I had always
regarded as a bastard art, anyway, and
of getting into a new dimension,
whereas most of the top radio writers
in New York failed in television be-
cause they could not adapt.
“I wrote half-hour plays to begin
with, then we began doing adaptations.
These were for ‘CBS Studio I’ a
great show, now gone like all the other
good drama shows. I learnt as I went
along, but was paid for doing it. We
weren’t paid much in those days, but it
enabled me to get along and to move
into Manhattan.
“We entered a period of original
writing which is generally remembered
as the golden age of television. I think
because there were so many interesting
people connected with it. Money began
to improve, but it really became good
when we came into what we called the
spectaculars, which were actually I^-
hour color shows. I did my first and
only musical in 1955 for Cyril Ritchard
and Joan Greenwood called ‘The King
and Mrs. Candle.’
“But after the spectaculars the shows
started to drift toward Hollywood and
it was an unfortunate drift. We could
see it coming. From a production stand-
point everything improved and from
the artistic viewpoint everything
started to go downhill. By 1964 it was
the end of the whole thing. There is
a certain desperation to drag writers
back into the medium now for what is
laughingly termed Drama, as opposed
! o ‘The Beverly Hillbillies’, I suppose,
Locke Elliott ... far from his “beloved country ”
Picture by Robert Walker
but they don’t really want original
work. I have, like many other writers,
been offered up to $25,000 to write an
hour-and-a-half script, but money isn’t
everything.”
Despite this, Elliott does not think
that the ABC is underpaying in Aus-
tralia with $4OO for an hour play. In
fact, when I mentioned the sum his
jaw dropped and he recalled the ex-
citement of receiving $4O in the past.
“I would like to go back to the
theatre. The New York theatre is a
nightmare now, but I hope it won’t
be for ever. Even the cycle of night-
mare might come back to some cohe-
rence again. It has been appalling in
New York for the past few years.”
Discussing the situation with Truman
Capote recently the two men decided
that anyone who spends a year writing
a play and then has its fate dependent
on the three remaining drama critics
in New York is mad. “This reduces
the theatre to being either a smash hit
or closing immediately. If I write a
play again I will have to go into it
with the feeling that this is pure
luxury.” He feels he is much more likely
to continue writing books.
“Fortunately, just as television, as I
wanted to write it, was dying in New
York I wrote ‘Careful,’ and it was a
great success.”
“Careful He Might Hear You” was
sold three million strong through the
“Reader’s Digest” organisation. It hov-
ered for 40 weeks on the best-seller list
and has been widely translated. “The
Germans took to it like mad, but it
didn’t sell well in Australia,” Elliott
recalls.
During the years he has twice re-
turned to Australia for brief periods,
but does not think he will come again
unless he is asked to act as technical
adviser when “Careful” is made into
a him by Joshua Logan. “But John
Truscott, the young Melbourne artist
who did the sets for ‘Camelot,’ will be
working on ‘Careful,’ and they really
won’t need me.”
Elliott remembers with some amuse-
ment travelling in a lift with Peter
Finch just before they both took their
separate ways from Australia. “We
were both vowing with great conceit
that we would return to give our be-
loved country the benefit of our enor-
mous talents! I don’t think either of
us have given our beloved country too
much. You can hardly count ‘Robbery
Under Arms’.”


Art in industry
By SANDRA HALL
AUSTRALIAN artist-craftsmen are
making a determined effort to replace
the more homespun overtones of the
“arts and crafts” label with a liberal
dash of professionalism. Weavers, pot-
ters, silversmiths, glassware designers,
and embroiderers have formed them-
selves into the Craft Association of Aus-
tralia, and are holding their first ex-
hibition at the Australian Design Centre
in Sydney.
With this association, they are hop-
ing for the beginnings of a lot of things,
the most ambitious of which is a place
for the artist in industry. “In Finland,
this started happening 30 or 40 years
ago with Arabia, the kitchenware firm,”
said Marea Gazzard, the potter, who is
helping to arrange the exhibition. “They
put established artists on a salary to
advise them about design. And it really
helped put Finnish design on the map.
“I’m not saying all artists could or
would want to work this way. But I do
think industry could profit by perhaps
retaining artists to come up with ideas.
A couple of glassware designers in Syd-
ney—Douglas Annand is one of them—
have done something life this, but I
can’t think of one ceramicist.”
Craftsmen’s reputations are made by
word-of-mouth, which is fine if you’re
moving in artistic circles, but not much
help to the visiting architect commis-
sioned to design a building here. “When
the building’s finished, they often im-
port things to put inside it, simply be-
cause they don’t know who does the
right kind of work in Australia,” Mrs.
Gazzard said. “We want to set up a
library of color slides to show people
exactly the kind of thing that’s avail-
able.”
“The kind of thing that’s available”
includes Mona Hessing’s gigantic, vivid
floor rugs, the round, full shapes of
Marea Gazzard’s pots, Col Levy’s grace-
fully angular ones, and weaving, pot-
tery, and woodwork from the Sturt
Workshops at Mittagong.
Sturt was established 25 years ago by
the founders of Frensham girls’ school.
It has since attracted some professional
weavers from other countries who have
come to settle in Australia, and some
of their work is in the exhibition, along
with block - printed wall hangings by
Elizabeth Vercoe, a stained-glass panel
by Welshman Roy Lewis, and some
silver jewellery by Helge Larsen and
his wife, Darani Lewers.
The association, a member of the
World Craft Council in New York,
has done one thing since it first began—
encouraged craftsmen to talk to one
another about their work. “The weavers
have been going along to the lectures
on silverwork and some of the
artists, too.”

Nolan's "gems"
By ELWYN LYNN
Nolan, Shakespeare Sonnets. Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney.
Nolan, Drawings. Hungry Horse
Gallery, Sydney.
Nolan, Ballet and Theatre Designs.
Qantas Gallery, Sydney.
Nolan, Recent Watercolors. David
Jones’ Gallery, Sydney.
FIVE ADDITIONAL exhibitions sup-
plement the large Nolan retrospective
at the Gallery of New South Wales,
four in Sydney and one in Canberra
with the Asian and Promethean water-
colors that also appear with landscapes
and explorers at David Jones’. These
smallish works, with the largest 20in. x
30in., must remove any pejorative taint
from the term “little gems.” The water-
colors, which are mainly dyes and
crayons, have an opalescent sheen and
a ruby-emerald luminosity that are gem-
like, though the gems burn not hard
and bright but from the shadows.
If images in the African paintings
spring fleetingly to view, here they are
veiled, and, as is appropriate for the
Shakespeare sonnets, reveal their levels
of meaning gradually and look worn
and eroded by time, whose passage is
often recorded in those sonnets: Nolan
paints a smooth skull covered with rich,
coppery leather to accompany Shake-
speare’s “Beated and chopped with
tanned antiquity.” When the skull
appears itself with “So shalt thou feed
on death, that feeds on men,” the bone,
suffering a sea change into something
rich and strange, is frail and tender.
Rarely are these delicate and transient
images macabre and, though he has a
set of grimacing fangs in “Fairing the
foul with art’s false borrowed face,”
there’s little of Wedster and Donne’s
compression and grand irony, and the
humaneness is clearly evident in several
that glance at Daumier and Rem-
brandt and in the blue portrait of Will
himself, who looks something like a
wrinkled Oberon, and in the head of
the Jester, which looks like Nolan’s
comment on the ludicrous view that he
is an illustrator excited by literature and
scenery—
“ Alas, ’tis true I have gone here and
there,
And made myself a motley to the view.”
How far he is removed from illus-
tration is clear from the 38 awkward,
spare, casual drawings at the Hungry
Horse commenting on Kelly’s Jerilderie
Letter, Milton, Dante, and Juvenal; a
glance at the contemporaneous draw-
ings in Prior, Wannan, and Nunn’s
Plundering Sons must reveal how re-
laxed and almost haphazard these
crayon reflections are.
They have some of the cool camp of
David Hockney’s recent drawings flirt-
ing with homosexual themes and the
mild eroticism of The Jerilderie Letter
2 (“and Lonigan, who caught me by
the privates and would have sent me to
kingdom come only I was not ready”)
leads naturally to Juvenal’s satire. Some
of the Juvenal drawings are very free
indeed, but one needs to restrain one’s
amateur psychoanalysis, for a drawing
of a man with a red fish protruding
from his rear and holding a legless
woman with bottom and breasts in the
same cursive “w” shape is quite literal,
as male adulterers were punished by
having a mackerel so inserted.
Sometimes the whimsy slips into
slightness and one wonders at the dis-
parity between the inconsequential
sketch and the question that accom-
panies it: “Throw Hannibal on the
scales, how many pounds does the
great captain come to?” Not all are
so relaxed, and one comment on Mil-
ton, with a red, mushroom-shaped tree,
cloud or phallic symbol, leads directly
to the one that rose on the backdrop
to Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,”
sketches for which may be seen at the
Qantas Gallery along with those for
“The Display” and “The Guide.” There
is no catalogue, no PR notes available,
but these are most important pieces in
their relation to the Gallipoli draw-
ings, the stigmata signs, the convict
stripes on figures capering before ant-
hills, in the way “The Display” recalls
the later Mrs. Frazer works and how
“The Guide” adumbrates the wan, re-
mote tenderness of the splendid water-
color Asian and outback scenes, the
legend of Kelly and the myth of
Prometheus at David Jones’.
Here the woman and child, seem-
ingly in hell, relate to the grand Inferno
at the N.S.W. Gallery, and the series of
heads that grow more skull-like are
akin to the sonnet series. The Asian
works look like stained, faded parch-
ment; a rider on a camel disappears
into green water like a Gallipoli
swimmer and the landscapes have the
luminous liquesence of his oils of the
early ’sixties, but all is a shadowed,
remote, romantic world where a Dela-
croix orange blazes forth and the play
of textures gives an oceanic depth. It’s
a long way from the simple silhouette
and flat lands of the early Kelly, and
if an interest in technique fights for
dominance Nolan is creating new,
mysterious images and allowing uncon-
scious impulses to play a greater part
in his narratives.
Films
Waiting for Godard
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Pudding Thieves. Directed by
Brian Davies.
WHEN Georgie Mangiamele shot his
ill-fated “Clay” in Melbourne, he
selected locales which would de-


emphasise the film’s Australianness.
The mock-medieval Eltham Art
Colony, surely Australia’s most over-
exposed film location, provided most of
the settings, and lacy-ironed Carlton
terraces were used, incongruously, for
country towns. Like painters a century
before him, Mangiamele’s nostalgia for
the European landscape distorted his
view of his new environment.
Brian Davies, too, has filmed a Euro-
pean Melbourne with his view in-
fluenced by the work of Jean Luc
Godard. Except for a couple of trams
that sneak into frame, “The Pudding
Thieves” might have been filmed in
the Paris of “Breathless.” Davies’ first
notes for his script were so reminiscent
of Jean Luc that the film seemed
doomed to parody or plagiarise. But
Davies was in deadly earnest, so much
so that he started filming his do-it-
yourself feature, despite lack of money,
equipment, or any real hope of dis-
tribution. On a money-box budget the
film took Davies four years. Actors’
interest was hard to sustain, and crucial
cast-members opted out as the months
dragged on.
The plot? Two street photographers
run a profitable sideline taking and
peddling pornography. One of the
photographers, however, falls under the
influence of a pretty door-to-door
evangelist. Increasingly ashamed of
himself, he finally writes an anonymous
letter to the police, telling them where
he and his colleague can be arrested.
However, when the police move in,
self-preservation overcomes self-sacrifice,
and he runs away. The film closes with
the young man examining what’s left
of his conscience in a coffee shop.
When I saw the film in rough form
it seemed that Davies had spent his
four years waiting for Godard. Yet
seeing it complete with music, sound
•effects, some new footage, and improved
post-synching I was impressed.
In a very interesting way Aus-
tralianness has triumphed over in-
fluence. This is partly a product of the
performances and partly a result of
Davies’ own attitude to the project.
Obviously this changed as filming pro-
gressed and difficulties were com-
pounded. An increasingly ironic quality
was introduced.
The titles set the tone. “This film,”
says a credit, “is dedicated to the
Carlton cinema, which has shown more
good films than any other bug-house
in Australia.” And throughout the
action fragments overheard on radios
or glimpsed in newspapers keep eroding
at any original pretentiousness. Its
worst failing is a tendency to uni-
versity-style “in jokes.” Its best quality
is an easy-going indigenous informality,
emphasised by Sacha Trikojus’ fluid
hand-held camerawork. At just 60
minutes in length the action tends to
become oblique and sketchy. There is
time only to hint at motivation. Had the
film been longer, it would work far
better. As it is “The Pudding Thieves”
is more a mood piece than a fully
developed feature. The mood, however,
is rich in interesting ambiguities.
REALLY swinging
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Jokers. Director, Michael Winner.
Two For The Road. Director, Stanley
Donen.
Hotel. Director, Richard Quine.
TIRED AS I AM of the cult of “swing-
ing London,” I surrendered without a
struggle to the charm and gaiety of
Michael Winner’s volatile comedy,
which has the pace and zany invention
of Richard Lester at his best without
Lester’s almost inevitable lapses into
modish but meaningless rattiness. At
its giddiest, “The Jokers” always keeps
a thread of sense (tenuous, certainly)
connecting it with the v eal world.
The jokers of the title are a pair of
prankish brothers who, in spite of being
wealthy, popular, and sought-after, feel
they haven't quite made their mark.
Daring criminal acts, they decide, are
the In thing, and since the train rob-
bery, art thefts, and the Stone of Scone
have already been done, what’s left but
the Crown Jewels? Not that they really
intend to steal them their plan in-
cludes their return after the gesture has
been made.
The script (based on an original
story by Winner himself) is ingenious,
droll, engagingly disrespectful not only
of established authority but of accepted
fashion and the swingers themselves;
but its laughter never descends to sneer-
ing. The color cameras, whirling
through London at its most picturesque,
provide some of the most original
photography, in the comic vein, since
“Nothing But The Best”; the perform-
ances are admirable, Michael Crawford
and Oliver Reed are an engaging pair
of arch-criminals, and I was particu-
larly entertained by James Donald’s
admirably straight performance as a
dunderheaded colonel. Above all, the
film is genuinely funny. Don’t miss it—
there aren’t too many of them about
nowadays.
“Two For The Road” is a comedy,
too, but not an uncomplicated one; in
fact it’s so overloaded with “deeper
implications” that the purely funny
scenes seem rather intrusive and tact-
less. A disgruntled husband and wife,
on the verge of splitting up, set off
irritably on a European holiday which
inevitably brings memories of earlier,
happier journeys. This finally mellows
them to the point of deciding to stay
together, the movie’s message evidently
being that any marriage, however
unhappy, is better than none.
Since the plot is not exactly com-
plex and since Stanley Donen is a
pedestrian even if competent director,
the’ film’s appeal depends chiefly on
the two chief characters, who are pres-
ented as a not-very-engaging pair, being
shallow, selfish, and quarrelsome. The
curious lack of warmth in their rela-
tionship must be blamed chiefly on
script and presentation Audrey Hep-
burn and Albert Finney are capable
players, but never really bring the
characters to life. They both get to
wear a great variety of fashionable
gear, but aren’t helped by the death-
mask photography poor color prints,
it seems, are now the rule rather than
the exception.
There’s a strangely old-world air
about “Hotel,” a busily plotted film set
in a hotel (naturally) which has to cope
with its own financial problems as well
as its oddly behaved guests. It’s slick
and brightly colored, and there’s plenty
going on even if none of it is very
important; performances by Melvyn
Douglas and Karl Malden are a lot
better than necessary. It’s just the sort
of movie I used to adore a thousand
years ago, but not now. Is it just be-
cause I got older? Somehow I can’t
help feeling that the magic formula
got lost, too, and is now somewhere
undiscoverable with the philosopher’s
stone.
Theatre
Pop shop-window
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Just Before the Honeymoon and (X
Jack Hibberd. La Mama, Mel-
bourne.
WE DROVE PAST the Love Inn,
resplendently frescoed in hippy horti-
culture, and parked in La Mama’s
courtyard beneath a tree heavy with
psychedelic blossom. Inside, a score of
Greenwich Villagers sat in enlightened
gloom, waiting for the actors to appear.
Most were squinting at copies of
“The Village Voice,” a newspaper
crammed with the glad tiding of LSD
and the bad news of LBJ. On the cover
of our copy was a photograph of the
legendary heroine of Pop and Pot, Baby
Jane Holzer, “who is appearing in La
Mama’s next production.”
To someone accustomed to the be-
furred, bejewelled first nights of J. C.
Williamson’s, this promised to be a
heady experience. It seemed we were
not merely an audience but members of
a cultural conspiracy. We were at Mel-
bourne’s La Mama, which has been con-
jured out of Carlton by Betty Burstall,
who became enamoured of the New
York original. With the help of actors
from local companies, she hopes to
make it a showplace for new dramatic
writing, and has to “date presented four
short seasons of Australian one-acters.
The actors work without payment in
what amounts to slightly produced
readings.
Hibberd’s pieces exploit repetitions
and Beckett-style word-play. “O” looked
on dispassionately as a love affair veered
from affection to violence. “Honey-
moon” was a surreal discussion between


an abstracted couple who wandered
among the three tenses. Both were long
enough to demonstrate Hibberd’s com-
petence in the modes, but too short for
the evaluation of his significance, if
any.
Workmanlike Lear
By ROBERT WARD
King Lear. Shakespeare. Theatre 62,
Adelaide.
THEATRE 62’s current production of
“King Lear” is its third Shakespearian
production this year. It was preceded
by “The Merchant of Venice” and
“Julius Caesar.” This is quite an
achievement for a small company, for
though school audiences have always
been assured the productions have not
been done on the cheap but rather
have all been serious and principled
attempts to master the problems of
Shakespearian production.
“Lear” is directed in the round by
Richard Davey. His cast is strong over-
all, with John Gaden as an intense and
energetic Lear, Jonathan Leigh as a
gentle Gloucester, and Robert Antill
as a somewhat blunt or direct Fool.
With the exception of Scene Three in
Act Five, it is uncut, and plays over
three hours. It doesn’t drag at all, it
is well rehearsed, the actors have a
firm grasp of their characters, and in
such general terms it is a competent,
conventional production, of the kind
we were often served by John Alden.
However, it falls short of being com-
pletely successful because it is so con-
ventional. Lear is once again seen in
a tattered white nightie weaving plastic
flowers. Then, much more importantly,
in this production the actors and act-
resses can’t speak the Shakespearian
Rag. This is an art, but not a difficult
one. Shakespeare’s prose needs very-
clear articulation and a good ear for
internal rhythms, while his verse needs
both of the former as well as some
awareness of the counterpoint which
occurs between the poetic metre and
the sense stress. The idea of speaking
Shakespearian lines as if they were
modern prose dialogue ended every-
where, except in Australia, just after
the war.
Jonathan Leigh’s Gloucester is an
exception in these matters. He plays
the mild and anxious old man with
£reat sensitivity and understanding.
Marion Heatherfield’s and Tina
Hurley’s Goneril and Regan should be
mentioned, because they are nicely very
nasty. The costumes by Peter Morgan
are Henry Irving-Valhalla, which is un-
fortunate.
One-man brand
By ROBERT HALL
Who in the Hell are you? Living Room,
Brisbane.
THEY SAID it couldn’t be done.
They’re always saying that about some-
thing in Brisbane. But local actor-
director turned businessman Russell
Jarrett went right ahead and did it.
What he did was to sink all his cash
and much of his boundless energy into
something which simply did not exist
a sophisticated Brisbane nightlife.
Last week, a new intimate revue
called “Who in the Hell are you?”
opened in the Living Room, one of the
two Brisbane theatre-restaurants which
provide the city’s only employment for
professional theatricals. Both have re-
ceived overwhelming support from a
nocturnal public which, just 18 months
ago, did not exist.
The revue the second production
in the Living Room, the newer and
more lavish sister venture of the Mark
Twain has consolidated the Jarrett
success.
The new revue is a very good one
indeed. It moves at tremendous speed
and the moving parts are more than
functional. The cast is headed (and
shouldered) by Ken Lord, surely the
most capable product ~of all Russell’s
researching into local talent. The
scripts are biting enough to ensure the
continuance of the local support of the
courageous ventures of Russell Jarrett.
Notable among the regulars are all
those local theatrical lights who said it
just couldn’t be done.
Faithfully nasty
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Macßird. Barbara Garson, New, Syd-
ney.
“MACBIRD” SEEMS to be becoming
an intellectual ' and political pause
celebre, note the editors of “Partisan
Review,” the New York quarterly
magazine.
In this knockabout political parody
of “Macbeth,” John Ken O’Dunc, the
newly crowned king, is murdered by
order of his ambitious Vice-President
Macßird, urged on by Lady Macßird,
while he is visiting their Texas ranch.
Macßird, succeeding to the Presidency,
then has to contend with his pre-
decessor’s surviving brothers, the
scheming Robert and the idiot Ted,
who plot this overthrow. With cunning
persuasiveness Robert enlists the sup-
port of both Right and Left, both hawks
and doves, including the Wayne of
Morse, an absurd Don Quixote figure.
Only the silver-tongued Lord Steven-
son, the Egg of Head, shilly-shallies and
will not be persuaded.
The Three Witches who tempt Mac-
Bird appear as a Beatnik girl student,
a Black Muslim, and a Worker Witch,
who is an old Leftist, and whose hack-
neyed slogans are sneered at by the two
young Witches.
American critical reaction has been
extreme: glowing praise on the one
hand, disdain and outrage on the other.
J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, ex-
presses outrage in the forthright manner
of a non-professional critic: “. . . un-
bridled vulgarity, obscenity, blas-
phemy, perversion, and public desecra-
tion of every sacred and just symbol.”
I sympathise with him because “Mac-
Bird” arouses a feeling of outrage in
me, too. But this criticism will not do,
for if we apply the critical principle:
decide what the author is trying to do
and judge how well it is done, we have
to decide that “public desecration of
every sacred and just symbol” is Bar-
bara Garson’s aim. How well is it
done?
There has been a lot of disagree-
ment on this, too. Robert Lowell wrote:
“I have nothing to say about the poli-
tical truth of this play, but I am sure
a kind of genius has gone into the
writing.” At the other extreme is Lionel
Abel’s view, expressed in “Partisan
Review”: “ ‘Macßird’ is mildly amusing
in a collegiate way, uninventive, prosy,
without much dramatic or literary in-
terest. The only reason I can see for
pushing this opus is a political one.”
The critics who liked “Macßird”
seemed to have all been very anxious
to disclaim the political implications
and to insist that Barbara Garson did
not really think the Johnsons were re-
sponsible for the death of Kennedy. I.
think Mrs. Garson makes it quite plain
that she thinks that these corrupt and
ambitious politicians would stop at
nothing they thought they could get
away with to achieve their ambitions.
Whether she thinks Johnson actually
killed Kennedy does not seem particu-
larly important. Since she thinks that
they are all bent on achieving a kind
.of society she hates the Smooth
Society she finds them all equally
odious.
In my view, “Macßird” is nothing if
hot political: a virulent expression of
the “hate America” attitude which is
common among Left-wing intellectuals
and students both inside and outside
Amei'ica. In spite of their specifically
disowning its political implications, it
seems to me that the critics who like
“Macßird” are the ones who sympa-
thise with this attitude.
John Bernard’s production faithfully
reproduces the nastiness of the play.
The characters are as unpleasant as
they should be with the exception of
Dick May as John Ken O’Dunc, who
ought to be tougher. Roger Milliss as
Robert, with flopping forelock and
sharp nose, is instantly recognisable
and takes the nastiness prize. Fay
Hughes runs him close as Lady Mac-
Bird. Tom Baker is good as a slit-eyed
Macßird in cowboy costume, and David
Shepherd, long, lean and sinuous, is
excellent as the Black Muslim witch.


Nolan as mythmaker
By BERNARD SMITH
ELWYN LYNN’S “Sidney Nolan Myth
and Imagery”* is a welcome contribu-
tion to the growing literature on Nolan.
It is probably the best general intro-
duction to Nolan’s work which has yet
appeared, certainly the most compre-
hensive. Although it does not live up
to the promise suggested by the title, it
does shift the discussion of Nolan’s art
from the boring polarities of nationalism
versus internationalism to the formative
processes of his art. Much of the
strength and most of the weaknesses
of the book lie in the fact that it is
written in the tradition of descriptive,
impressionistic, and evocative criticism,
in which the author seeks to convey in
words something of the effects produced
by the painter. There are, on the other
hand, many perceptive and illuminating
discussions of the relation between
Nolan’s technical innovations and his
art as a whole. The book, in short, is
a good introduction to Nolan’s art for
the general reader.
But as a serious consideration of the
role of myth and imagery in Nolan’s
work it leaves much to be desired. Dis-
cussion remains at a discursive, descrip-
tive level, comment is disparate, the
treatment episodic; there is no attempt
at a systematic analysis of the way in
which Nolan employs image and myth,
or of their role in the formal develop-
ment of his art. In short, a case is not
argued through; no coherent theory of
the role of myth and image in Nolan’s
art emerges.
The failure results, it seems to me,
from several factors. The first is a
problem of evidence. Elwyn Lynn has
been in no position obviously to examine
all the evidence, both pictorial and
verbal, in existence but not available to
him. For one thing we need a definitive
catalogue of the artist’s work, especially
his early work; one based upon a study
both of the artist’s own presentation of
its chronology and such external
evidence as is available. Until this is
completed, any attempt to provide an
account of image and myth in Nolan
must remain highly speculative and be
based upon shifting sand. Even with
such a catalogue the problem will
remain extraordinarily complex. The
second problem is one of interpretation.
Lynn fails, it seems to me, to present
Nolan as an artist possessing a singu-
larly unified temperament and person-
ality. He does not ask himself what
Nolan wanted of art, what art means to
him, the role he has made it play in
his life. These, admittedly, are exceed-
ingly difficult questions, but they are
contingent upon any real attempt to
explain his use of image and myth.
Lynn accepts without much examina-
tion, for example, the current but, I
believe, misleading view that Nolan
began as an abstract painter and gradu-
ally turned more representational. At a
broad, descriptive level, this appears
to be true enough; for Nolan’s early
work is more formalised, employs a
more elemental, more rudimentary
symbology than his later. But that is
not to say that it was abstract in any
strict or sustained sense. The real truth
of the matter will not be revealed until
a greater body of Nolan’s early work
becomes, if indeed it ever does, avail-
able to the public. Certainly it seems
clear that in the climactic months of
1937, when Nolan was discovering the
modern movement for himself in a. con-
dition of intense involvement, passion,
and speed, he experimented widely. But
I am not convinced after reading Lynn
that Nolan ever occupied a position in
which he regarded the work of art as
pure object.
Nolan... no naive colonial boy
The point at issue revolves around the
fact that Nolan intended first to be a
poet, and the imaginative energy of his
early, highly formalised works are to
be found in Rimbaud, Verlaine, and
Blake; in Klee, Miro, and the Surrealist
assertion that the real source of in-
spiration lies in the subconscious mind,
true locale of personal and primordial
myth.
To stress an early abstract phase in
Nolan’s development may lead to con-
fusion, unless that phase is carefully
defined. This, surely, is what has hap-
pened in Lynn’s analysis of the first
plate in his book, a free drawing of
1937, which is compared to drawings
by New York abstract expressionists of
the 19405. The implication is that Nolan
was here a man before his time: in-
formally abstract prior to the masters
of informal abstraction. But to read
Glenrowan siege, from the Ned Kelly
series
the drawing as anticipatory of abstract
expression is, I would suggest, mislead-
ing. Its natural ambience is to be found
rather in the art of Gaudier-Brzeska,
whose supple and flexible line drawings
delighted and excited the 1937 evening
classes which Nolan attended at the
National Gallery of Victoria.
Even a monotype like Lovers (1940),
the second plate in Lynn’s book, is not
to be read, surely, as pure abstraction
but as an intensely personal document,
a private world of elemental symbols:
the crosses are not marks only but kiss
symbols; the tearful eyes owe something
to Picasso’s drawings for Guernica. It
belongs to a sequence of drawings re-
lated to a line in William Blake’s first
book of Urizen: “the eternals closed the
tent,” at the point where the poem
deals with the passion of Los for Eni-
tharmon and the birth of Ore. It is
related to Tent (1940), exhibited as
No. 2 in the current Nolan retrospec-
tive, at the Art Gallery of New South
Wales; to a large painting in Mr. Peter
Bellew’s possession, to designs for the
ballet “Icare,” and other paintings of
this time. Here, in short, is an mono-
graphic cluster of drawings and paint-
ings at the outset of Nolan’s career, the
analysis of which is of the first im-
portance for any rigorous examination
of Nolan’s iconography. The fact that
he developed a highly personal manner
of painting en serie, which has become
a cardinal feature of his work, renders
a close study of these early image-
linked clusters highly relevant to an
understanding of his later development.
The stress upon Nolan’s early abstrac-
tion leads Lynn also to a misinterpre-

tation of the Wimmera landscapes.
Certainly, in his experiments with col-
lage, Nolan moved toward a more
abstract position. But even here the
real interest lies in spatial ambiguities
between two and three dimensions; it
is, that is to say, Cezannist and Cubist
rather than purely abstract. The crisp,
stereoscopic image confronting two
tonally distinct and spatially varied
edges—what might be called the Ned
Kelly-gum-tree motif has remained
with him all his life. But such devices
are not to be equated with the notion
of painting as pure object. For Nolan
made such devices work as symbol.
Lynn’s. inclination to see Nolan’s
landscapes as pure objects leads him to
assert that they are “not a repository
of a variety of human feelings.” Yet
in Dimboola, plate six, the only Wim-
mera landscape illustrated in color, an
irresistible lad is offering some great
smacking kisses to a coy maiden in the
middle distance. The kiss symbols we
have already seen in Lovers: doubtless
they are to be found in his wartime
letters. And are not the silo and moon
in the background a Freudian analogue
of the love idyll of the foreground?
The attempt to interpret Nolan’s land-
scape as devoid of human feeling, as
“landscape as object,” has little to
commend it; the author himself aban-
dons his case in his discussion of Nolan’s
Antarctic landscapes.
Elwyn Lynn throws little if any light
on the way image is transformed into
myth in Nolan. One path toward a
solution may lie in Nolan’s link with
Rimbaud, often commented upon but
never closely examined.
This could be important, for many of
the early works, especially the St.
Kilda paintings, are close in mood,
atmosphere, and setting to passages in
Les Illuminations, to which Nolan was
introduced by a close friend, Howard
Matthews, at the National Gallery
School. Lynn underestimates the impor-
tance of that school, and the friends
Nolan found there, upon his art and
life.
But Nolan owes more to Rimbaud,
surely, than a primitive, hallucinatory
clarity of image; for Rimbaud, the
absolute non-conformist, living outside
and beyond conventions became for
Nolan something of a persona; and
the poet who abandoned his poetry for
a life of violence and gun-running in
the Red Sea pre-figures that second
persona, Kelly, whose life of criminal
action, sanctified in myth, has woven
its dialectic, in the realm beyond good
and evil, around the artist’s develop-
ment.
Nolan’s identification with these two
amoral men of action deserves a closer
analysis than Lynn provides. A clue
may be found in Nolan’s interest in
Kierkegaard, to whom Max Nicholson
introduced him during the war and
whom he read extensively. In Kierke-
gaard, Nolan may have found his
answer to Freud and Andre Breton. For
there is indeed a change during the
war years, from a stream-of-conscious-
ness outpouring of personal symbol with
its ideological roots in Breton’s un-
conscious modes of integration, to an
art in which choice, decision, and will
play a larger part.
In this movement from an art owing
much to psychic automatism to an art
which is, among other things, an act of
conscious choice, Kierkegaard may have
been the catalyst. Ahd this shift, to
be distinguished clearly from a shift
from abstraction to representation, finds
its mythical correlatives in Rimbaud
and Kelly. If my analysis is sound, it
might provide us with one explanation
how personal myth gave Nolan the
courage to develop his art against the
grain of the century.
What I have called elsewhere Nolan’s
iconomorphic use of myth and image
has made it possible for him, I would
suggest, to create a private world within
Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Nolan discuss a practical problem at a London art studio
which he can operate and develop as
an original artist without his art be-
come a reflex of dominant trends; the
fate which awaits most artists born
like Australians into culturally insecure,
provincial societies. Because from his
Moon-Boy, of 1940, to the astounding
Michaelesque imagery of Gallipoli, of
1963, is an eccentric path indeed for
a creative artist of the twentieth cen-
tury.
Not that Nolan’s work is to be dis-
cussed wholly in terms of choice; far
from it. The constant exposure to
new sensations in world travel, the
stimulus of new materials and tech-
niques, the role of accident must also
occupy an important place in any full
discussion of his art. But choice is
there, Nolan chose Kelly, even if he
only stumbled upon him at a propitious
moment for his art, as he has later
chosen Mrs. Fraser, Bracefell, Leda,
and the Diggers of Gallipoli, interweav-
ing, transforming, and conflating them
into a personal mythos. It has not been
fully appreciated how this personal
mythology has made it possible for
Nolan to develop a far greater range
of style and technique than artists whose
development reveals itself primarily in
stylistic and technical terms. Myth has
given him ambience and span as well
as a personal focus. In drawing so con-
tinuously upon a personal iconography
he may be compared with his own
enigmatic little figure of Narcissus who
succeeds in looking at himself while
looking at the world.
The presentation and lay-out of the
book leave much to be desired. A
great many of the paintings discussed
in detail by the author and crucial for
his argument are not illustrated, and
references from text to plates are dif-
ficult in the extreme. More often than
not even quotations lack quotation
marks, so that is it difficult to know,
except by the change in voice, who one
is reading.
There is no bibliography and,
although many other critics are quoted,
Mr. Lynn makes no serious attempt to
assess what earlier writers have writ-
ten. This is an endemic weakness in
Australian art criticism. The critic pre-
sents his views in isolation without any
serious attempt to relate what he has
to say to what has been said before.
Mr. Lynn seems to view criticism,
except presumably his own, as “reac-
tions” to works of art rather than as
a corporate and unending attempt at
clarification. It is not enough, surely,
to quote Robert Melville on Nolan’s
Kelly image; one should be prepared
to consider to what extent Melville
has succeeded in interpreting the
imagery of the Kelly paintings. “Nolan,”
Melville writes, “had to invent a
figurative system which would go be-
yond appearances without altogether
dispensing with them. He found the
prototype for such a figuration, as his
own reference to Henri Rousseau indi-
cates, in the art of those simple, un-


trained painters who, in 19th-century
New England and 20th-century France, ,
produced stiff, solemn incorrect versions
of the human figure oddly and in-
tensely imbued with human presence.
The unreal realism of the naive painter
is the visual counterpart of Kelly’s
illiterate eloquence.”
Melville’s analogy is attractive but
inadequate; a too-mechanical and over-
simplified version of what, I believe,
actually occurred. Nolan, for one thing,
did not invent a figurative system to
accord with Kelly as folk-hero. His
faux-naif, figurative manner had already
developed considerably in the Wimmera
landscapes and St. Kilda paintings
before he began to paint Kelly; and
that manner was primitivistic and
highly sophisticated, not primitive; faux-
naif, not naive.
It is necessary to stress, as indeed
Elwyn Lynn does, that Nolan’s primi-
tivism was not the product of an
“innocent” eye, a naive colonial boy of
From the Gallipoli series of 1963
painting in a country which lacked an
artistic tradition. That, perhaps, was
the artist’s stance, but not the reality.
And it was the fashion in which London
critics firs, approached Nolan's art; but
the innocence was, in this case, in the
eye of the beholders. Robert Melville
certainly avoids that early, extreme
position, but he is still, I would suggest,
too i eady to accept Nolan s explana-
tion of his sources “Kelly’s words,
Rousseau, and sunlight at their face
value. There is much more to it than
that. In these matters the heart feels
more than the mind knows, and hand
and eye retain more than memory
recalls.
Nolan’s style has tangled roots.
Elwyn Lynn indicates how Nolan’s
primitivistic manner originated at a
time when primitivism in a variety of
forms was making a powerful impact
upon the Australian art scene, and
Nolan was, from the beginning, the
most uncompromising and thorough-
going of Australian primitivists. And
the sources of Nolan’s primitivisms are
various: initially there was the psychic
primitivism of surrealism which pro-
vided the theoretical justification, the
raison d’etre, of all the rest: children’s
drawings, French naive painters like le
Douanier Rousseau, Australian colonial
primitives, and the art of primitive
peoples.
The complex heritage of Nolan’s
apparently naive style may be appreci-
ated by a study of some of the possible
stylistic sources of the painting entitled
The Defence of Aaron Sherritt. It is
likely that the wallpaper and bright
patchwork rug derive from personal
memories, but the style adopted suggests
the influence not of Rousseau so much
as Matisse around 1910-11, the presence
of Matisse-like patterns and Matisse’s
play with perspective is also present in
other paintings of the Kelly series. The
way in which the patchwork of the
rug is made to pass across the reclining
policeman is certainly a Matisse-like
device, plus a witty emphasis, doubtless,
upon camouflage, so much a part of
many an Australian artist s life during
the war years.
The enchanting trio who emerge
from beneath the bed have their pic-
torial origin, I would suggest, in quite
a different source. There is nothing, to
my knowledge, m the verbal sources
which Nolan used to account precisely
for this engaging and memorable
image, but there are two likely visual
sources. Nolan, at this time, was inter-
ested in early Colonial painting. The
idea of a figure emerging, rather ludi-
crously, in a condition of fright from
beneath a bed was probably inspired
in part by the well-known colonial
broadsheet which depicts The Arrest of
Governor Bligh. Nolan might have seen
this either as illustrated in Dr. H. V.
Evatt’s “Rum Rebellion” (1938), or my
own “Place, Taste, and Tradition”
(1945). But the painting appears to
have other roots also. Nolan has also
called upon, it would appear, the art of
archaic Greece. Does it not incorporate
his recollections of a photograph of the
charming triple-headed monster from
the limestone pediment of the Old
Hekatompedon on the Acropolis at
Athens, which Frank Medworth used as
the head-piece to his article on Greek
Art of the Sixth Century, published in
“Art in Australia” of March, 1942? It
is no b °f course, a deliberate borrowing
but the vestige of a visual experience
embodied and re-created in a new situ-
ation. Yet the moustaches of the
monster, the bright, whimsical archaic
smile (why should they be smiling, one
might well ask, with murderers at the
door of the hut?), the elbow-resting
position, and the convergent bodies
melting into a kind of tail, all find a
source in the ancient Greek monster.
When Nolan, years later, came to
envisage the Gallipoli campaign as a
kind of re-enactment of the Trojan
Ship in the ice, from the Antarctica series
wars, his imagination, it seems, had
already been prepared by an earlier
marriage of Greek and Australian myth.
Tt ic into such Questions that a book
Hke Elwyn Tynn's “Sidney Nolan
Myth and Imagery” must inevitably
lead us. They will be considered irrel-
evant questions only by those who pre-
tend to no interest in the processes of
the creative mind or try to identify
myth with nationalism. The book,
therefore, whatever its weaknesses—and
it has been more to the point here
to stress its weaknesses rather than its
strengths—is more than a personal re-
action to Nolan’s art. It is an attempt to
understand it and clarify our notions
about it; a contribution to a continuing
discussion. It brings a sophisticated
breadth of reference and technical
knowledge of the subject to do the artist
some justice. An attempt is made to
see Nolan’s art in its multiformity in-
stead of impaling it upon the polarities
of nationalism and internationalism.


BOOKS
The torment of our own
man for all seasons
By PETER GOUGH
Bring Larks and Heroes. Thomas
Keneally. Cassell. $3.75.
LIFE IN a seminary for the training
of Roman Catholic priests is the stuff
of the novel. The dichotomy between
good and evil is an involvement of
shared interest both to the seminarian
and novelist. It was with a seminary
novel, “The Place at Whitton,” that
Thomas Keneally made his great leap
in 1964 on to the Australian literary
stage.
In terms of equipment for the job
of novelist, Mr. Keneally carries all
the tools of the trade. First, he is a born
story-teller; secondly, a huge capacity
for the written word sparkles among
his gear; and to complete the picture,
Keneally possesses sharp eyes, keen
ears, and a mind in constant focus with
the life-riddle of man.
Between first and second novels there
was only a 12 months’ gap for Ken-
eally. In his second novel, “The Fear,”
he leaned heavily upon his boyhood ex-
perience of wartime Australia in the
19405.
“The Fear” carried ready evidence
that Keneally was working more con-
fidently within his chosen medium, and
a discipline in craft emerged that “The
Place at Whitton” did not attain;
hence in “The Fear” the author came
to better terms with the norms of the
novel that a writer, in fairness to his
readers, must set himself in order to
achieve recognition with a discerning
public.
By way of enthusiastic reaction,
the critics were quick to hail Keneally
as a novelist of vast potential. Already
Thomas Keneally was said by some to
be a little below White but above
Porter. Two years had seen two novels
from the 30-year-old Sydney school-
teacher. But now surely there would
be a considerable lull in the Keneally
output.
The story is, however, otherwise. Late
last year, Keneally was again swift at
work with “Halloran’s Little Boat” for
the Jane Street Theatre season of new
Australian plays. For Keneally theatre
was a new form, but his penchant for
dialogue is so considerable that the play
won much acclaim. At the time of the
Jane Street production, word was
around that the play was an adaptation
of a forthcoming third novel by Kene-
ally. “Bring Larks and Heroes” is that
novel. It outstrips anything previously
achieved by the author.
The novel is set in a penal colony
in the South Pacific during the 17905.
It is not a historical novel, but “a
world of its own.” The story weaves
itself around the life of a young man,
Corporal Phelim Halloran, and the de-
mands cast upon him by his girl,
his superior officers, his fellow-Irish,
and that nagging irritant his own con-
science.
Phelim Halloran is a man for all
seasons. The cloak of innocence falls
snugly about his shoulders, but vice
rather than virtue straddles this colony
that grips Halloran’s existential being.
For Halloran, the colony spells out one
reality: that hell is other people.
Partial redemption from this nether
world comes to Halloran in his secret
bride, Ann Rush, a servant girl. The
lack of a Romish priest on the colony's
strength bars Phelim and Ann from a
church wedding. Halloran knows, how-
ever, a craftier theology:
“The spouses are the true ministers
of the marriage sacrament . . . Does
not the Church demonstrate this by
one of her laws regulating the sacra-
ment? This is the law which states that
two people, moved by mutual affection
to contemplate the holy state, yet so
placed that they will not, with reason-
able certainty, find within a month a
priest before whom to exchange their
vows, that such people are permitted
to administer the sacrament to each
other by giving the normal marriage
pledges. They are then as truly married
as if they had spoken their promises
before the Holy Father himself in the
Basilica of St. Peter.”
While Halloran outlines the theo-
logical nuances of their union, Miss
Rush clarifies the practicalities of their
state: “It doesn’t matter, Halloran,
darling. I think the priests make too
much cry altogether about this vir-
ginity. I mean that it doesn’t last too
long, does it, once you settle down to
getting rid of it.”
Love was their delight, but only for
fleeting moments. The colony made no
provision for the luxury of two people
very much in love. Love cut across
hatred and death, and that was to break
with the colony’s status quo. Halloran
and his secret bride, his bride in Christ,
were already in the throes of death, the
colony had no other price to ask of
them.
For the living, death strikes other
men, but that is only a precursor for
the death of the living. Halloran saw
the death of other men, and in a
fashion that was merely to witness his
own fate.
Thomas Ewers, eunuch and convict-
artist, fell foul of a randy lady of the
Establishment. Ewers must die. The
Establishment was a stickler for tradi-
tion: “On the morning of the second
day, Ewers was ceremonially hanged
... it was the worst of hangings, a
long stifling, when, in the muscular
agony, the ravaged animal spills dirt
and water down its legs.”
Halloran got a full lesson in bumble-
Thomas Keneally... his Irish up
dom through the case of Peter Quinn r
an Irish felon. Quinn had been trans-
ported to the colony on the “Catania”
with less than 12 months of his sentence
to run after already having served five
years in Cavan County jail. Keneally,
with his Irish up, captures the bastardry
of it all in an incisive vignette:
“Halloran believed it (Quinn’s
story). For Quinn was the type whose
brows are honed to a fine edge by
decades of cap-doffing to the agent and
the priest . . . But despite the long
habits of serfdom, on being indentured
for transportation, he told his story to
every available official, both from the
harbor and from the ‘Catania’: to
the harbor-master and officers, marine
and mercantile, to the commissary
officials, the surgeon, and Navy agent.
So many of them listened. So many of
them curled their mouths at the folly
of sending a man into the farthest exile
for a matter of mere months. So many
of them promised to have words about


him with so many knights’ commodores,
magistrals, members, shipyard secre-
taries,, ihilitia generals, benevolent
ladies, arid bishdpsv ■'' ; ,
“Despite 1 this hierarchy of concern,
‘Catania’ shiled. The "next day; l allowed
out ,of ’ the hold, he "lookeid to the
quarterdeck, that the 1 gentlemen there
might see him and temember what a
blunder had been made in him. Yet
they seemed to 'be-immune to that or
any blunder . '."./As final word to the
impregnable decisioris of the great,
there was an armed Marine at the bot-
tom of the companionway.”
Now the time is at hand for the en-
meshing of Halloran and his secret
bride in this Golgotha charade. Political
prisorier and traitor Robert Hearn
manipulates the young couple in order
to assist his escape from the colony.
Halloran and his bride are hanged in
order to maintain "darkness over light
in the hearts of fnen.
By any staridards “Bring Larks and
Heroes” js a great novel. The confron-
tation between virtue and vice arouses
in the author a creative response to the
eternal human dilemma. But in the
matter of artistic merit, “Bring Larks
and Heroes” lies firmly upon Mr.
Keneally’s extraordinary writing skills.
Distinctions
By VIVIAN SMITH
Nineteenth Century Minor Poets.
Edited with an Introduction by W.
H. Auden. Faber. $3.60.
“TO QUALIFY as major, a poet must
satisfy about three and a half of the
following five conditions:
I. He must write a lot.
2. His poems must show a wide range
in subject matter arid treatment.
3. He must exhibit an unmistakable
originality of vision and style.
4. He must be a master of verse tech-
nique.
5. In the case of all poets, we dis-
tinguish between their juvenilia and
their mature work, but, in the case of
the major poet, the process of maturing
continues until he dies, so that, if con-
fronted by two poems of his of equal
merit but written at different times,
the reader can immediately say which
was written first. In the case of a minor
poet, on the other hand, however excel-
lent the two poems may be, the reader
cannot settle their chronology on the
basis of the poems themselves.”
Thus Auden by way of explaining his
. choice of minor poets. His selection
moves, through eighty poets from Scott
'to A.E., taking in such inevitables as
Thomas Moore, Hood, Barnes, Beddoes,
and Meredith, and such unexpecteds
and unknowns as Henry Lyte, Jeremiah
Callanan, James Mangan, Thomas
Wade, William Rands, and William
Larminie. Swinburne ;and Kipling are
excluded as major poets.
I suppose just about the worst poems
W. H. Auden... not earnest
included are those by Robert Bridges.
Francis Thompson is completely out.
Auden has always, both in his critical
prose and in much of his own poetry,
attacked the idea that “real” poetry is
“earnest” statement. He is, after all,
the editor of “The Oxford Book of
Light Verse,” and in the present volume
he has chosen poems for their individu-
ality of utterance. Thus Thomas Hood
is well represented by his light verse,
not his poor Keatsian imitations. There
are good pieces from Lewis Carroll and
Lear. Auden knows that what a poem
is is not necessarily what it says, and
that poems frequently survive and are
valued for reasons other than those the
author intended. The selection is
extremely wide ranging and includes
some deeply felt pieces by John Clare
and Christina Rossetti, to mention only
two other names.
In his brilliant introduction, Auden
has a number of valuable things to say
about, the relations between the poets
and the historical and intellectual
events that formed the common back-
ground of their lives as well as on the
relationship between prosody and dic-
tion. The selection is preceded by a
valuable ten-page chronology.
Lindsays from life
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Comedy of Life. Lionel Lindsay. Angus
and Robertson. $4.75.
THE FAMILY of Dr. Robert Lind-
say, of Creswick, Victoria, numbered
ten, and of these five escaped from the
land of Redheap and Saturdee to be-
come artists and writers. Like another
famous clutch of virtuosi, the Powys
clan in England, the Lindsays differed
markedly as individuals, but they all
shared a seemingly inexhaustible zest
for life. This gusto bubbles and crackles
through every page of Sir Lionel Lind-
say’s autobiographical “Comedy Of
Life,” an idiosyncratic, opinionated,
immensely readable chronicle of his
career up to the exhibition of drawings
and etchings in London in the I9?Qs
that really established his international
repute as an artist.
Froih Creswick young Lionel wept to .
Melbourne to become an apprentice
astronomer, but soon drifted into , the
city’s literary and artistic bohemia,
where he and his brother, Norman,
eked out a happy, half-starved exis-
tence for some years in the 1890 s.
Later he was wandering and painting
in Spain, a country which inspired his
passionate admiration all his life. After
a spell in London, enlivened by the
companionship of Phil May, and Ran-
dolph Bedford, he returned to Australia
to work as an artist for Archibald’s
“Bulletin’ and for the old “Evening
News” under Banjo Paterson’s editor-
ship. In the 1920 s he was in Spain
again, painting with Alfred Munnings,
and the book ends with a characteristic
piece of Lionel Lindsay invective against
modern art, artists, critics, and dealers.
Lindsay and Munnings must have been
congenial fellow-travellers.
The most entertaining sections of the
Lionel Lindsay ... Dargie’s portrait
autobiography are those dealing with
the early Australian years. There’s a
fine book waiting to be written about
the primitive, naive, self-conscious,
gutsy literary and journalistic world of
Sydney and Melbourne pre-World War
I. All we have (apart from rubbish
like Norman Lindsay’s “A Curate In
Bohemia”) are scattered and random
impressions, of which certainly none is
more vivid or evocative than Lionel
Lindsay’s.
Later on he has some good things to
say about, and some fresh and curious
little sidelights on, the characters of
such notabilities as Banjo Paterson,
Henry Lawson, Archibald, Will Dyson,
Christopher Brennan, and Hugh D.

was a challenge to his curiosity.” He
painted in oils and watercolors and
drew in pen, pencil, and wash; he
worked at etching, aquatint, drypoint,
and wood-engraving; he was a lithog-
rapher, typesetter, printer, and photog-
rapher. When he married Will Dyson’s
sister he made all his own household
furniture, including a splendid double
bed. He was generally regarded as the
finest conversationalist of the Lindsay
family, which was saying something.
Lionel Lindsay had an enviable life.
His autobiography leaves the impression
of a busy and happy man. He wrote
with the same unaffected ease as he
spoke, and the result is a thoroughly
delightful book.
Low comedy
By JOHN BAXTER
The Saddest Summer of Samuel S.
J. P. Donleavy. Eyre and Spottis-
woode. $2.30.
THE BLURB WRITER quotes the first
two paragraphs of this novelette on the
wrapper and leaves it at that, confident
that nobody will come along for some
time to provide a summary of this
eccentric work. The odds are in his
favor. Like most of Donleavy’s low-
life comedies, “The Saddest Summer
of Samuel S” defies categorisation.
Originally a play, it is listed in the
publishing history as a novel although
J. P. Donleavy... defies categorisation
belonging by virtue of its structure to
the genre of short stories. Perhaps we
are safest in counting it as an elaborate
but misfired practical joke by one of
our funniest contemporary humorists.
We know the country and the char-
acter, even though Donleavy changes
names. Samuel S lives in Vienna, but
he might as well have been any other
disintegrating dead-beat in a dozen
European capitals. A Bloom-like char-
acter forever conscious of his own
internal workings, mental and physical,
Samuel staggers around the city in a
perpetual search for fulfilment, en-
lightenment, and sex. The mysterious
Countess would marry him and make
him rich, but he won’t see his individu-
ality threatened. His psychiatrist holds
out some hope of an intellectual revela-
tion, but Samuel is so obtuse in his
reasoned arguments against this that
eventually he must terminate their
association he is driving the Doctor
crazy.
Finally, there is Abigail, a sexy travel-
ling American who, impressed by
Samuel’s ability to break wind in B
flat, offers to go to bed with him.
Regretfully, he turns her down, pre-
ferring freedom and frustration.
Abigail goes back to America, the
Countess runs away with the Doctor,
and Samuel achieves an end consistent
with the frustration and inconclusive-
ness of his life. There are no belly
laughs here, and the style is clumsy, but
something shines intermittently through;
perhaps a rueful delight in the com-
plexity of being human that sets us
apart from the apes.
Body and Soul
by CHARLES HIGHAM
A Meeting by the River. Christopher
Isherwood. Methuen. $2.65.
IN HIS NEW novel, Isherwood gives
us rather as Patrick White did in a
more complex form in “The Solid Man-
dala”—a portrait of the spiritual and
the carnal in the form of two brothers,
one mystical, aloof, drawn to the credo
of Vedanta, the other sensual, hedon-
istic, drawing pleasure from the per-
missive sunlit ambience of California.
The book is told in the epistolary
form, broken up by snatches of rem-
iniscence detached from the main body
of the narrative. The letters are written
by Oliver, who has gone to India to
become a Hindu monk, influenced by a
figure remarkably similar to Isherwood’s
own friend and mentor Swami Prahvan-
ananda, and his brother, Patrick,
worldly, cruel, self-indulgent publisher
in Hollywood for a film project,
bisexual—with a wife and a boyfriend,
and, like Oliver, obsessed with Mother:
a formidable gorgon presence who lurks
behind the smooth glassy surface of the
book like a boa-constrictor. The styles
of both brothers have altogether the
Isherwood flavor, and it is perhaps a
pity that they are not sufficiently differ-
entiated, the demarcation lines between
the two personalities more clearly
drawn.
In so intensely personal a book as
Isherwood has written, the degree of
one’s approval depends rather more
heavily than usual on one’s liking or
not liking the characters. Indirectly,
through the letters they write to each
other, Patrick and Oliver are collaring
the reader, forcing him into contact with
their most intimate thoughts. Oliver’s
admiration for the Swami is hard to
share, and the portrait is devoid of
irony, but the Swami himself doesn’t
matter in the narrative; it is Oliver’s
attitude to him that matters. Through
the open affection of Oliver for this
rather trying figure, we are made to see
the kind of personality—simple, urgent,
purely dedicated of a successful
pursuer of the monastic vocation. And
Patrick, too, is appealing so com-
pletely selfish and heartless that he be-
comes acceptable on his own terms.
Having presented his basic situation—
two brothers writing from an Indian
monastery and Los Angeles, opposing
symbols of the spirit and the decadent
flesh Isherwood arranges an en-
counter between them in Calcutta. This
is preceded by a fascinating monologue
by Oliver, who is all too aware of
Patrick’s determination to talk him back
into the world of the senses. Letters
from Patrick to Mother to Tom, his
Californian male lover, and to his-
wife accelerate the emotional temper-
ature, so that Isherwood with masterly
skill has us on the edge of our seats
for the brothers’ meeting, for the devil’s
final threat to the potential saint.
The whole of the central section of
the book Patrick trying to woo
Oliver back to the flesh and the devil,
Oliver himself thoroughly ambivalent
in his attitude to the monks’ simple
and dedicated existence, the reactions
of the monks cleverly suggested is
extraordinarily complex, like all Isher-
wood disclosing labyrinth of meanings
behind the simply hewn prose. When
the two men finally part they have
affected each other drastically: Patrick
abnegates his homosexual liaison, Oliver
is deepened and strengthened by his

shocking brief contact with Patrick,
the world, and its evils.
The book fascinates, it is funny, full
of graceful observation, and in the
last analysis humanist. Yet, like “A
Single Man” before it, it leaves a final
impression of thinness, of self-conscious-
ness and a wry, disturbing unease.
“Down There on a Visit,” Isherwood’s
best novel, had a structure large enough,
a prose style sufficiently strong, to
convey the full force of the author’s
contradictory, monastic-versus-hedonist
outlook. In this new work, the impact
is too light, the prose too brittle, and
the colors too monochrome; but even
a minor work from Isherwood is
entirely welcome.
Un-merry tunes
By NANCY KEESING
The Lame Dog Man. George Turner.
Cassell Australia. $3.75.
THIS BOOK IS the fourth and last
of a sequence of novels all set in the
Victorian town of Treelake and having,
for central character, Jimmy Carlyon,
employment officer. “The Lame Dog
Man” is, however, complete in itself,
being in no true sense a sequel. Neither
is the series of Galsworthian-type saga,
for, throughout, Turner has not been
constrained by accurate chronology.
(For instance the first book, “A
Stranger and Afraid” was set during
the early ’sos when Carlyon was 37.
This one cannot be earlier than 1966,
but Carlyon is only 40.)
Obviously there will be difficulties
for Turner when he decides to publish
the four uniformly. Difficulties, too,
for the leisurely critic who will, I hope,
soon consider the series as a whole.
It merits serious critical consideration.
I believe Turner was sometimes over-
praised several years ago. His achieve-
ment now is thoroughly important.
Of the three books in the series
which I have read, “The Lame Dog
Man” is quite the best. Turner’s always
cryptic style is here fully developed.
It has become an instrument on which
he can play his un-merry tunes with
absolute assurance. One character, Ted
Johnson, petty crook, hysteric, hypo- •
chondriac, is a tour de force which only
a mature author, confident of his
powers, could attempt.
Turner’s device of presenting the
horrible, pathetic, pestiferous Johnson
as Carlyon’s alter ego serves well to
round off his portrait of Carlyon. Some
artistic contrivances of this sort seem
merely clever. Here the result is both
clever and satisfying in terms of the
novel itself. But these are not the only
characters Turner always offers a
large cast of people whose behaviour
is sometimes capricious, but always,
through his interpretation, believable.
After Treelake and Carlyon, where
and whom? It will be interesting to
see.

NATURES FINEST
SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
The distinct
flavor of diet
foods is commercial
YOU CAN’T SUCCEED in business
by eating, but you can succeed quicker
by good that is controlled eat-
ing. Just how food and fortune can be
related I shall discuss in a series of
articles beginning here.
I talked to 12 top executives about
their food habits, about whether, if they
had the chance over again, they would
apply different principles to their daily
bread or whether they felt it was too
late to change. From their replies I am
still uncertain whether they were suc-
cessful that is good eaters, but I
am certain that each of them recognised
how his potential could be lifted by
controlled eating.
Another thing they had in common
was a real interest in the fine points of
food and wine, for they felt that part
of their striving in business was for
ever-higher standards of living, and food
was an essential part of that target.
While there is no text-book pattern for
the successful man, is there, perhaps,
one consistent factor? I believe there
is, and that it is health.
I am absolutely convinced that a very
large part of our health is dependent
upon the food we eat every day. At
one time I was chief catering adviser
to a Commonwealth Air Force. We
undertook an experiment with a group
of combat-ready aircrew. They were of
the same age, height, and weight, they
were all fighting fit. By creating special
diets that left out certain elements we
were able within three days to produce
symptoms of fatigue, depression, irri-
tation, and nervousness. After a week
these symptoms became so advanced
that efficiency was in doubt. Yet it took
only one day of suitably balanced food
to return the men to their maximum
performance.
The human body will function with-
out proper attention, but it will not
meet the requirements of the success-
ful man. How many times have you
heard it said, “I get irritable when I’m
on a diet.” An irritable executive lacks
judgment. The battle against obesity is
waged by every health-minded writer
about diet these days but all the
same I’d back the judgment of an
overweight person against that of a con-
tinual dieter. Tell me one unhappy,
nervous, and irascible gourmet and I’ll
change my mind.
The diet vogue has recently taken
on a distinctly commercial flavor. Syn-
thetic foods are praised at the expense
of natural foods. But, in general, the
synthetics owe their existence to their
greater profitability. So, in turn, more
cents per pound can be spent on adver-
tising and promoting the synthetics.
Obviously the pressure is on for a
breakaway from straightforward natu-
ral foods toward their attractively
priced synthetic competitors.
But synthesised foods do not flatter
and excite the senses like natural foods.
A good aroma and taste start the mouth
watering. In turn this excitement pro-
motes excellent digestion. Good diges-
tion means that the nutritive elements
are more thoroughly absorbed.
The human body is like a car. A
car needs petrol, water, oil, and it needs
pampering if you want it to do its best.
Executives need a tune-up of heart,
lungs, and muscles, and the right, fuel
for the effort they have to make.
Want to feel much more vital, sleep
well, and not be overweight? Well read
on. For good dietary habits we have
to mix five food groups in correct
proportion.
Carbohydrates (petrol) are the go-
foods, like sugar, biscuits, cakes, bread,
pasta, rice, and cereals. Take in too
much for the speed you have to go
and your body turns the over-rich mix
into fat. Cut it too lean and you starve
the engine it misses and runs rough.
Protein (panel beating) does a repair
job. Foods containing it are meat, fish,
poultry, offal, milk, cheese, and nuts.
If you are not working your body hard,
then eat relatively small portions. It’s
useless to eat more of this expensive
food than you require.
Fats (ignition) give the necessary
energy to release the power given by
carbohydrates.
Vitamins (lights) give clear eyes,
fresh complexion, good temper and so
on. Eat an orange and you throw a
switch something lights up.
Minerals (the distributor) act quite
simply as body regulators. Calcium,
iodine, sodium, potassium, magnesium,
sulphur, chlorine these are the con-
tact points on the distributor cap. Apart
from calcium and iodine there are
plenty of minerals in even the most
moderate diet.
The human body can therefore be a
highly tuned instrument kept in first-
class working order by carefully selected
fuel.
I have purposely disposed of diet
first because day to day eating, based
upon a reasonably wide range of natural
foods and taken in moderation, will
be enough for the most successful oi
men.
Of greater importance is the how,
when, and where of eating, which will
be taken up in the next article.

Chinese in Australia
While Sandra Jobson’s article on
“Fair - Dinkum Chinatown” (8.,
Sept. 16) aims to be revealing, in-
teresting, and witty (the last aspect
something like Arthur Calwell’s famous
“Two Wongs don’t make a White”),
it was a pity that it conveyed a few
erroneous distorted impressions of
Chinese (Australian born or not) in
general and of Sydney Chinese in par-
ticular.
Firstly, there is the reference to the
Chinese of the goldrush days (among
whom included my grandparents) who
“stayed on to grow vegetables and duti-
fully prepared Chinese meals.” Of the
thousands who came out to Australia
to try to make their fortunes only a
minority stayed and they not only be-
came market gardeners and cooks but
found opportunities as hawkers, traders,
and general merchants or shopkeepers,
as well as in some trades like carpenters
and builders. But, of course, their
opportunities were limited, for without
adequate mastery of the English
language and customs in a British
colonial society, and amidst the grow-
ing prejudice and antagonism against
them initiated by the European gold-
miners, politicians, and “vested in-
terest” groups of that period, the
Chinese who stayed found things very
difficult.
Thus while on the one hand Chinese
culture acted against assimilation,
Chinese who did settle also found
antagonism and barriers to their pos-
sible assimilation. This has been one
of the tragedies of the overseas Chinese
outside China. The developments of
the Chinese minorities in South-East
Asia have reflected this peculiar posi-
tion, although naturally with the re-
strictions on Chinese migration and
inter-marrying with the indigenous
population, the Chinese problem in
Australia became a diminishing one
both in numbers and influence.
Secondly, the comment by one
Chinese businessman about the younger
generation “All they want is to be
Australian” is expected in view of
the fact that they possibly went to
Australian schools, follow Australian
customs, prefer pies and pasties or fish
and chips to spring rolls and dim sims,
etc. So for all intents and purposes,
like the young Italians, Greeks, Ger-
mans, or Dutch born of migrant
parents, they are “Australians.” There
are various types, classes, or groups of
Australians, and the situation is that
“some Australians are more Australian
than others.” The Australian Chinese,
like the Australian Italian, Greek, or
Jew, probably encounter some residual
though diminishing prejudice and
sometimes latent resentment against
“foreigners” by the old or British Aus-
tralians. This is usually accepted philo-
sophically.
For the younger generation in min-
ority groups there is the tendency to
overcome any inferiority complex and
a reaction could result in greater
determination to achieve better results
than “the average.” Thus I doubt
whether Chinese are really more “fan-
atical about learning” than, say, Greeks
or Jews. When I was a university
student in Sydney in the early ’fifties
the general attitude was more apathy
than the reverse among many, although
traditional respect was shown to the
humble scholar. No doubt the influence
of Chinese students studying in Aus-
tralia, coming from Hong Kong and
various parts of South-East Asia, has
strengthened the impetus for higher
education among the younger genera-
tion of Australian Chinese. The oppor-
tunities for education and entry to pro-
fessions are wider than those for their
parents or grandparents.
Finally, the statement attributed to
the Chinese merchant that “most
Chinese have only one religion—dollars
and cents” may as well be applied to
all who live in a modern acquisitive,
materialistic society, whether they be
Chinese, Jews, Americans, Englishmen,
Germans, Japanese, or Australians.
Among the Chinese in Australia there
are also many devout Buddhists, Con-
fucians, and Christians, as well as
agnostics, and to imply that they, too,
have only one religion is similar to say-
ing that most Australians have only
one religion, dollars and cents, or all
businessmen aim only for profits for
themselves. The facts do not bear out
the fiction of this sweeping accusation.
The Chinese have contributed and will
continue to contribute much to the pro-
gress of Australian society and Aus-
tralia.

The educated woman
I read with interest the article “What
Shall We Do With The Educated
Woman?” (8., Sept. 23.) What indeed!
How weary one becomes of the poor
little educated housewife who is bored
with day-to-day life and so unfulfilled.
But is she educated? “Graduate” today
is a compulsive word without which
few conversations are complete. It
means, simply, that at the conclusion
of three or four years’ study at a uni-
versity and, armed with a degree to
prove it, she is qualified to work in a
specialised field.
When a woman graduate marries, it
is not always possible for her to con-
tinue her career. Serious academicians
tell us that the purpose of tertiary
studies is to teach the student to think,
to .reason and to control her mental
processes; to liberate her from the

boredom that often settles on the un-

woman has, later, to have recourse to
drugs for stimulation or to the futile
pursuit of arts and crafts that do not,
basically, interest her, in order to feel
fulfilled; if her trained mind cannot
delight in books and music and the
visual arts that surround us today or in
the world around her as it touches her
husband and children and the stirring
times in which we live, surely her edu-

Reid's McMahon
Alan Reid is surely missing the point
in his defence (8., Sept. 25) of Mr.
William McMahon, whose attack on
the religious views of Dr. Everingham
provoked such a critical reaction. What
is objectionable was his description of
Dr. Everingham as having “way-out
political, economic, and religious
views.” As a politician, Mr. McMahon
is entitled to describe the political or
economic views of any of - his oppon-
ents as “way out.” But to describe a
man’s religious views as “way out” is
merely to appeal to religious bigotry.
This was a crude attempt to stir up
religious intolerance for political advan-
tage, and as such was very properly
resented by many religious people, as
well as by those who hold the same
religious views as Dr. Everingham.
Dr. I. S. Edwards,
Chairman, N.S.W. Humanist Society
Cronulla, N.S.W.
It is refreshing to take note today of
the comment offered this week by Alan
Reid on the McMahon-Everingham
situation. I attended the meeting ad-
dressed by Mr. McMahon and I have
read and reread Alan Reid’s comment.
Having read The Bulletin for over sixty
years regularly, sometimes in disagree-
ment, sometimes in admiration, always
with respect, I am compelled to offer
the opinion that Alan Reid’s article is
by any measure as good as the best of
The Bulletin over this period.

Shooting kangaroos
With due respect to the submissions of
Mr. L. Skipper (8., Sept. 16), deprecat-
ing the efforts of fauna conservationists
on behalf of the survival of kangaroos,
irrefutable facts justify our concern.
Expert figures which I obtained from
the Minister for Primary Industries
reveal that 11,289,7921 b. of kangaroo
meat was exported in 1964-66, while
in 1966 the figure was 10,011,4041 b.
One can hardly accept Mr. Skipper’s
thesis that the fire power of Aborigines
in the Governor Phillip era using spears
and boomerangs could compare with
modern telescopic-sighted rifles and
spotlights to create such fauna carnage.
I certainly appreciate landowners’
rights, but I do contend that the ele-
ments who have made large profits from
’roo meat sales should be forced to
make a direct contribution to preserve
the fauna heritage they are continu-
ously ravishing.
Just as the Chifley Government im-
posed a levy on coal production to pay
for the miners’ long-service-leave costs,
so should a 5 cent per lb. levy be placed
on the sale of kangaroo meat. Such
income derived could be used to acquire
additional acreages for adequate fauna
reservations.

Solution for Chowilla
May I suggest an alternative which
gives a complete solution to the prob-
lems of the Chowilla Dam namely
to dredge the upper reaches of the
Murray to give the necessary storage.
This would obviate all evaporation
problems, as the surface exposed to the
air would not be increased and might
even be decreased by filling on the
banks. Problems of salinity and of
foundations for the ill-fated dam would
be solved, while cost would be a
gradual matter, spread over years of
dredging.

Aid to North Vietnam
In his reply (September 23) to my
letter, Mr. Ray Evans states that the
International Red Cross is sending
medical supplies to Hanoi “to be used
presumably as the Government sees
fit.” When 50 percent of the money
raised by the Students’ Representative
Council of Melbourne University was
sent to Red Cross (the other 50 percent
having been sent to World University
Service to be used in South Vietnam),
it was stated that the money should be
used for civil aid in North Vietnam.
In his acknowledgment of receipt of
the donation, Mr. S. G. Goddard, the
general secretary of the Victorian
Division of the Australian Red Cross,
wrote, “This amount will be forwarded
through our National Headquarters to
the International Red Cross in Geneva,
which will arrange for the purchase of
medical supplies to be sent to the North
Vietnam Red Cross Society for the
relief of civilians.”
I am amazed that Mr. Evans could
consider assistance given to Red Cross
in carrying out their humanitarian work
“a shabby take.”
