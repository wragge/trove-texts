SOME NEW BOOKS.
Apparitions and Thought-Transfer-
ence; ry Frank Podmore. Cloth, 4s.
This is a record of observations in tele-
pathy collected and collated by I lie Psychical
Research Society. The facts and alleged
facts are interesting, but the writer’s com-
ment on the evidence is comparatively weak
and unimpressive. Ho concludes that there
are undoubtedly channels of communication
outside the ordinary senses, and quotes
numerous well-authenticated cases of hallu-
cinatory apparitions, though agreeing that it
is quite unnecessary to postulate their super-
natural origin. The last half of the book is
the more readable, and it is pleasant to think
that one can at the same time become a
student of mental science and enjoy a splen-
did collection of “ghost stories.” Mr.
Podmore’s attitude is fair and moderate ; and
while he thinks “ that in general the so-
called physical phenomena of Spiritualism
are due to self-deception and exaggeration
on the one hand, and to fraud on the other,”
he believes also that there are other records
which cannot bo so summarily dismissed.
Esther Waters, a Novel ; by George
Moore. Cloth, 6s. Gd.
This is a leaf from the Book of Life. It
is not a pleasant, but a very powerful work ;
without color or humor ; its hues those of a
lowering sky, its theme the sordid realities
of lower-class London. It is as definite as a
photograph, and in tone as monotonous;
yet it grips you throughout with its force
and insight. There are many interspersed
twigs and chips of Truth, e,g. ; “ That sense
of unity in life which is marriage.” “ A bet
on a race brings hope into lives which would
otherwise bo hopeless.” “ You don’t know
what love is ; a woman who hasn’t loved a
man who don’t love her, don’t.”
The central idea of the book is the evil
wrought by the mania for gambling on horse-
races, and the story is at once an exposure
and a warning. Because, however, it partly
binges on the conjunction of a man and
a woman in the simple and ordinary
fashion of untutored human nature in
England and elsewhere, “Esther Waters’
was refused admission to the railway book-
stalls leased by the respectable firm of W.
H. Smith and Son, and the success of the
work was thei'eupon assured. As the
cleverest and most dating example of the
modern realistic novel in English, “ Esther
Waters ” well deserves to succeed. The
spectacle of the squalid sties which mis-
sionaries leave behind them in order to go
and convert the happy heathen at the other
side of the world is both edifying and con-
vincing. The descriptions are brutally
literal. The Great Australian Adjective,
which is also the great London adjective,
appears without the disguise of either dashes
or stars. It must be unspeakably shocking
to Mrs, Grundy to reflect that such remarks
as “ Now let’s ’ear the bloody omen that put
ye on to Sultan ” can be printed in an Eng-
lish book, and that this book can be hailed
by an accomplished English critic as S‘ the
most artistic, the most complete, and; the
most inevitable work of fiction that has been
written for at least.two years.”
Lourdes, by Emile Zola. Translated by
E. A. Yizctelly. Cloth, 4s.
“Lourdes” is not selling well in Aus-
tralia. It is too clean. A few years ago,
when you had to purchase “Nana” like
Sunday drinks, with the greatest precaution,
the Sydney booksellers couldn’t keep Zola
on their shelves. There was one shop in
particular which made a small fortune out of
“ L’Assomvnoir.” But if a stranger went
and asked for it, the manager scanned him
closely and said he didn’t know—they might
have it—they would see—would he leave the
price and his address ? Then the man would
go home, and at midnight a packet with five
seals,, seven wrappings, and much string
and tape tied round it in curious knots
would be left mysteriously in a flower-pot hr
the garden ; and in the morning the man
would got it and disentangle the book and
open it at the description of the fight in the
laundry, and be happy all the day.
But “Lourdes” is absolutely unexception-
able from flic moral point of view, and it is
merely religious excitement which has sent
the French sale up to 100,000 in loss than six
months. Zola describes the miracle-work-
ing business admirably, but the book loses
Something in translation ; and though it is
strong and clover work it has,-more than a
suspicion of dulness for the reader who
wishes only to be amused. The author’s
standpoint may bo judged from a pregnant
passage in the preface :
” Lourdes, the Grotto, the cures, the miracles,
arc, indeed, the creation of that need of the Lie,
that, ucccsshy for credulity, which is a character-
istic of human nature. At first, when little
Bernadette came with her strange story of what
she had witnessed, ovoiybody was against her.
Tlvo Prefect of the Department, the Bishop, the
clergy, objected to her story. But Lourdes grow
up in tpUe of all opposition, just, as the 'Christian
religion did, because suffering humanity in i's
despair must cling to something, must have some
hope ; and, on the other hand, because humanity
thirsts after illusions. In a word, it is the ytory
of the foundation of all religions.”

CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous A fl ections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any otlier medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co,
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Grave], Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in ils e\ acuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action 1 of
Buehu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing, a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the publi - to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the: stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the.same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more'ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M;D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions cf Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness. ■—
D. ECKBTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening ; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. Bi WOOD.. M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeits a peculiar'influence over the liver. •>
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
AH who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row's Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to ,be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANET WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Younq Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti febrile is unsur-
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

Jerome K. Jerome curses socialism ; “ The
majority must remember that its power is only
held on suffrage, and on the tacit understanding
that wisdom and sense are to regulate its conduct.”
And all the wisdom and sense are on the side of
the capitalistic minority, of course. The assump-
tion that the masses owe the liberties and privileges
they possess to the generosity and good grace of
the fatted class, and may be deprived of them at
any moment, should they displease their bene-
factors, is indeed magnificent, seeing that
every step in advance has had to be fought for
tooth-and-nail, and the people have gained, not
concessions, but victories.

of the United States which sez in effect that everybody
may think Just as he darn pleases, and them is my senti-
ments to a bare. You dowtlis beleeve this sperret doctrine
while I think it is a little mixt. Just as soon as a man
becums a reg’lar out-and-out sperret-rapper he leaves off

Sun-gin' his livin’ out of other peple. He eats all the

wonts, s -areiu’ the wimmin folks and little children and
destroyin’ the f-ace of mind of every famerlee he enters.
He don’t do nobody no good and is a cuss to society, and

The Discobolos.
The City of Montreal is a rising and agreeable place, but
its inhabitants are as yet too busy with commerce to care
greatly about the masterpieces of old Greek art. A oast
of one of these masterpieces—the finest of the several
statues of Discoboli, or Quoit-throwers— was some years
ago found by Samuel Butler, author of “ Erewhon," in
the Montreal Museum of Natural History ; it was, how-
ever, banished from public view in a room where were all
manner of skins, plants, snakes, insects, &c., and in the
middle of these an old man stuffing an owl. The dialogue
perhaps true, perhaps imaginary, perhaps a little Of one
and a little of the other—between Butler and the old man
gave rise to the lines that follow
Attorney Freehill, of Sydney, has been
authorised by Governor Tillman to administer
oaths for use in South Carolina. As the South
Carolina oath is understood to be 2oz. of rye-
whisky, lawyer Freehill has taken a tough con-
tract.
The “ Seven Colonies of Australasia,”
issued by Mr. T. A. Coghlan, N.S.W. Govern-
ment Statistician, is a decided improvement on
previous issues. The volume for 1894 contains
statistics dealing with almost every imaginable
subject, and the facts are arranged and tabulated
in a fashion which makes every separate item
readily accessible. The “ Seven Colonies is now
by far the best statistical work yet issued on Aus-
tralasian subjects, and it contains facts and figures
which will come in handy to support every possible
shade of political opinion and every economic
theory, idea or fad to be found this side of the
Equator. Figures can’t lie* but they are very
useful to liars, and, being a superior work of its
class, the “Seven Colonies” is even more useful
to liars than the average.

Amateur-soldier yarn. A few days ago an
infuriated customer ramped into the ironmongery
warehouse of Major Blank Cartridge, J.P., of
(say) Cooktown. The customer had bought some
pumping machinery, warranted to pump so many
feet, or yards, or miles of water in a given number
of minutes, or hours, or years; and it had, so he
averred, failed to do the amount guaranteed. So,
in rushed the customer and confronted the shop-
man. “Where’s the manager of the pump de-
partment ?” said he. Just then the gorgeous figure
of an amateur swashbuckler, in the full panoply
of war, appeared and approached. “What do
you want?” said the shopman. “Never mind.
Where’s the manager of the pump department ?”
“Look heah,” said the war-accoutred ironmonger,
“what’s the mattah !” “ I want the manager of
the pump department. The pump he sold me
can’t pump for sour apples. It never does half
what he said it would.” “Nonsense, sir !” said
the ironmongery field-marshal, in a voice which
indicated that his pumps always kept their
engagements. “ I say it isn’t nonsense,” said the
boiling customer. “ But I can’t stand fooling
with you. Where’s the manager of the pump
department?” The gilded warrior drew himself
up and, fixing a withering glance on the purchaser
of the pump, said, “Well, if you want to know,
I’m the manager of the pump department. What
about it?” The other man simply danced with
rage. “ What, so you're the manager of the pump
department. Well, if you are, take off your
blanky hat, gQ behind the countermand talk to me
properly.”
A PSALM OF MONTREAL.
Stowed away in a Montreal lumber-room,
The Discobolos standeth, and turneth his face to
the wall;
Dusty, cobweb-covered, maimed, and set at
naught,
Beauty crieth in an attic, and no man regardeth.
O God ! O Montreal!
Beautiful by night and day, beautiful in summer
and winter,
Whole or maimed, always and alike beautiful —
He preacheth gospel of grace to the skins of owls,
And to one who seasoneth the skins of Canadian
owls.
O God ! O Montreal!
When I saw him, I was wroth, and I said, “O
Discobolos,
Beautiful Discobolos, a Prince both among gods
and men.
What dqest thou here, how earnest thou here, Dis-
cobolos, t
Preaching gospel in vain to the skins of owls ?”
O God ! O Montreal!
And I turned to the man of skins,"and said unto
him,, “Oh ! thou man of skins,
Wherefore hast thou done thus, to shame the
beauty of the.Discobolos ?”
But the Lord had hardened the heart of the man
of skins,
And he answered, “My brother-in-law is haber-
dasher to Mr. Spurgeon.”
O God ! O Montreal!
“ The Discobolos is put here because he is vulgar—
He hath neither vest nor pants with which to
cover his limbs;
I, sir, am a person of most respectable connec-
tions —
My brother-in-law is (haberdasher to Mr. Spur-
geon.” ...
O God ! O Montreal I
Then I said, “ O brother-in-law to Mr. Spurgeon’s
haberdasher!
Who seasonest also the skins of Canadian owls,
Thou callest trousers ‘ pants,’ whereas I call them
‘trousers,’
Therefore thou art in hell-fire, and may the Lord
pity thee !”
O God ! O Montreal I
“ Preferrest thou the gospel of Montreal to the
gospel of Hellas,
The gospel of thy connection with Mr. Spurgeon’s
haberdashery to the gospel of the Discobolos ?”
Yet none the less blasphemed the beauty, saying,
“The Discobolos hath no gospel—
But my brother-in-law is haberdasher to Mr.
Spurgeon.”
O God ! 0 Montreal!

More Aspects of Party Government.
The vast difference which exists between
Parliamentary rule—under the system of
Government by Contradiction—as it is and
as it is supposed to be, was strikingly exem-
plified last week in Queensland during the
discussion upon the Land Bill. The theory
concerning Parliamentary Government is
that it is government by the people. It is a
beautiful and liberal theory, but in practice
the system has so many limitations, and the
authority which was originally derived from
the people is delegated from one person to
another through so many gradations, that
there is neither beauty nor liberalism in the
reality. Consequently, Party Government is
an anomalous system, which generally con-
sists of a strong man bouncing a feeble
Legislature, and making the people’s alleged
representatives do whatever seems good in
his eyes. In the case above alluded to, the
Assembly—which is alleged to represent the
will of the people—carried by a good
majority an amendment declaring that
all minerals in State lands should remain
the property of the State, and should
not pass to the purchaser of the freehold.
This amendment, which would be a serious
blow to many vested land-boom interests,
represented, for the time at least, the will of
the nation so far as the nation was able to
express it. Then the Government —which
nominally exists to carry out the will of the
nation—announced that the entire measure
would be withdrawn unless the obnoxious
amendment was cancelled, and the Hwuse,
having to choose between losing the amend-
ment and all the rest of the measure, or
losing the amendment only, meekly knocked
under. “The discussion went on with an
understanding that the Bill would be re-
committed for the purpose of expunging the
objectionable clause.” It was a very small
trouble over a comparatively small incident,
but it sufficiently demonstrates that “govern*
ment of the people by the people ” is only a
figure of speech, and not even very much of
that.
• • *
Assuming that the object of the parlia-
mentary system is popular self government
and not an accidental and fragmentary
despotism, the whole State edifice is rotten
from the ground upwards. In Queensland,
as in most of the other provinces, the
Assembly is the only part of the machine
which professes to represent the people,
and even it carries out its profession very
badly. It represents the male half of the
community only, to begin with. It repre-
sents this half with so many limitations of
the franchise that even the nominal consti-
tuency is reduced to probably not much
more than three-fourths of the adult male
population. Of these a large proportion does
not vote, and the remnant is divided into
two or more parties, the largest of which
runs the Government and suppresses the
minority. Therefore, the Ministerial party
often directly represents not very much over
one-tenth of the entire community. And its
representation, even of this fraction, is more
nominal than real. The party candidates
are not, in one instance out of ten, chosen
by the people—they either chose them-
selves or are nominated by the more
or less self-appointed bosses of the fac-
tion, and the rank - and - file acquiesce,
because otherwise the party vote is
liable to be split up, and the other crowd
may come out on top in the confusion. Also,
for want of the Referendum, or some similar
device, which will admit of important matters
being decided directly by the nation, the
candidate himself and a hundred political
problems which have no earthly connection
with him are so inextricably mixed up that
the fragment of the community which is
nominally represented can give no well-
defined expression of its opinions.
* * *
The miserable fraction of the nation which
thus nominates the upper dog in the fight
fondly imagines that, in some way °or
another, it creates the Government, but the
idea is mostly erroneous. It has, indirectly,
a voice in selecting the Premier only, and
the Premier selects his colleagues according
to his own interests or his own necessities?
Then he and his colleagues together are
understood to have something to do with
selecting the Upper House, so far as the
number of chance vacancies allows. Very
often, however, if the Premier is a man of
commanding influence, the colleagues have
no real voice in the matter, and the head of
the Cabinet fills the seats of the Upper
House at his own discretion, or at the
discretion of his wife, or someone else’s
wife, or of his creditors, or of some equally
extraneous influence of which the public
knows nothing. As for the Governor, who
forms the third element in the political
system, he arrives like the rain which falls
alike on the just and on the unjust, and the
reasons for his existence as a Governor are
not known, in most cases, even to himself.
Theiefore, the boasted constitutional system,
as it is in Queensland and New South Wales’
resolves itself into the fact that 10 or 15 per
cent, of the people are instrumental in
appointing the dominant half of one among
the three separate elements which make up
the machinery of Government. And this
uncertain hold upon one-third of the State
machine is alluded to with pride as “ the
free institutions of the country,” and other
phrases to that effect. It is not a very large
matter to cause so much self-congratulation,
and is mainly interesting as showing how
man is governed by high-sounding expres-
sions, and in demonstrating the influence of
corpulent polysyllables on the public in-
telligence,
* * #
Even the allegedly-dominant party in the
Assembly does not, however, control the
Ministry in any real sense. The incident in
the Queensland Legislature, already alluded
to, is a sufficient evidence of this, as are many
thousands of similar incidents which strew
the history of what is called constitutional
government. The party cannot of itself
force the Cabinet to do a single thing which
the Cabinet doesn’t choose to do. Its power
is limited to the fact that it can destroy the
Cabinet if it does not conform to the wishes
of the party, and get in its stead another
equally unmanageable. It is vaguely sup-
to hold the reins of power, but it
doesn’t; it is merely authorised to shoot the
horse—its own horse—if the animal doesn’t
go to its liking. In the case of the Queens-
land Land Bill, a very considerable portion
of the ordinary Government following voted
for the obnoxious amendment, and to them
Premier Nelson, if he had chosen to define
his position in words, might have addressed
himself as follows “ We, the Ministry,
are the real rulers of this country.
If you persist in this amendment, we
will withdraw the entire Bill. If you
can prevent us withdrawing the Bill we will
procure its defeat in the Upper House,
which, through our careful management, is
entirely in our interests. If you continue to
make yourselves obnoxious, we will either
resign, in which case we will be succeeded
by the Opposition party, over whom you will
have even less influence than you have over
us, or we will obtain a dissolution and send
you to your constituents. Then we, who
work the party machine, will nominate other
men on behalf of the party, and many of
you will be partially ruined by election
expenses, and will ultimately lose your par-
liamentary salaries and the other advantages
of your position. In any case your clause
will not be passed by the present Assembly ;
it will not be passed by a new one if we
return to power ; it will probably not be
passed if we don’t return to power, for we
will stonewall it to the uttermost ; and if it
does pass it will most certainly be thrown
out by the Council which we dominate.” It
was not necessary to say these things, for the
position was sufficiently well understood,
but if they had been said they would have
very fairly represented the political situation
as it is under the system of Government by
Contradiction.
* * •
The worst feature of the party system is
the Legislature’s absolute want of control
over the affairs of the State. The Ministry,
in the main, appoints itself. It formulates
its own policy, and one party opposes it,
whether it be good or bad, because it is sent
to the House to do so ; while the other
party, as a rule, supports it, whether it be
good or bad, for the same reason. The
House can’t seriously amend the policy, nor
reject one or more Ministers and retain the
rest, nor, even if it is in a big majority, can
it reject the Ministry and appoint a new
one ; it can only accept tilings as they come,
or else kill off the Cabinet and commit
suicide at the same time and let the other
crowd assume office. Then it goes through
the same experience all over again, until after a
while it gets rid of the new lot, and goes back
to the old one. But even when it has abolished
the Ministry for the thousandth time the
position is not improved in the least, and
the alleged representatives of the people
have just as much power to amend the policy
of the last Cabinet as they had in the case of
the first one. Therefore, the life of a reason-
ably good Govern ment is divided into three
stages : one of prosperity while it is em-
ployed in carrying out, or professing to carry
out, the policy by which it obtained office ;
one of disintegration when it begins to get
out of touch with its party ; and one of col-
lapse. And the life of a bad Government is
also divided into three stages ; one in which
it lives partly by corruption and partly on
the sins of its predecessors ; one when the
sins of its predecessors are mostly forgotten
and it lives by corruption and terrorism ; and
one of general wreck and downfall. Party
Government,, in short, is a despotism with
complications, and about the best thing that
can be said for it is that sometimes a states-
man arises and does good in spite of it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Fighting the Land-Tax
A COMBINATION of desperate Tories and disap-
pointed office-seekers has thus early disturbed
the new Vic. Parliament with a crisis. At the
instance of one M'Kenzie, M.L.A., on whose
motion, by the way, the late Parliament de-
clared itself unfit to live, the question of a tax
upon unimproved land-values resolved itself
last week into a question of “confidence” or
otherwise in the Turner Government. It
seems to The Bulletin that M'Kenzie’s
ambition to play the part of king-maker will
prove an unfortunate circumstance for his capi-
talistic friends. Premier Turner’s land-taxa-
tion scheme is the work of a politician desiring
to make the best of what seems to him an un-
pleasant necessity. A less democratic scheme
could hardly have been devised by its half-
hearted Liberal father, considering that Vic-
toria is at last aroused to a sense of the soil’s
obligations to the State. The people having
asked for a land-tax, Turner responded with a
proposal which was expected to obtain the
surly assent of Fat Man, after he had ex-
hausted his old stock of arguments against
the inevitable. Inasmuch as the Radical
members offered no serious objection to
an unprogressive tax, and were content
to express themselves thankful, for small
mercies, common-sense assumed that the
friends of Capital would merely rave at random
in the House whilst thanking their stars in
private. Not so, however. To such hopeless
monopolists as M'Kenzie it is not yet apparent
that Victoria means to follow the example of
Maoriland and South Australia. They read
their Argus regularly, or have it read to them,
and gather from the ghastly misrepresentations
of that obsolete organ encouragement to hang
on to their wilful ignorance. There is no
deception about M'Kenzie. He says : “ Our
great objection is, of course, to the proposed
land-tax, which we regard as an iniquity. I
object to a land-tax in any form, but would
vote for one on property or wealth.” In short,
the M'Kenzie clique will do anything, or
rather they will say anything, rather than
admit the justice of the land-tax principle.
The thing is “ iniquitous ” —nothing less.
Wherefore M‘Kenzie moved a vote of want of
confidence in the political scoundrels who have
dared to offer such an outrage to the
community. But whilst this champion of
the Stupid Party travels on his expired
ticket—the “ iniquity ” ticket —his right-
hand man, Mr. Graham, professes to have
a deep respect for the land-tax principle.
Graham’s excuses for joining in this scandalous
arrest of political business are mixed. He
avows himself ready to overthrow the Turner
Ministry because he is satisfied that the present
financial difficulty— i.e., a large and growing
deficit—could be tided over by retrenchment
and economy. Also Graham, who hoped to
Jiave been a member of the Government which
is introducing the land-tax, is now convinced
that his constituents object to it. Finally,
Graham himself objects to Turner’s tax
because it doesn’t go nearly far enough. A
graduated scheme is what Graham would revel
in, and so he conspires with M'Kenzib in an
attempt to get rid of the only Government from
which any land taxation is to be expected. The
insincerity of Graham and his little clique is
obvious. If a progressive tax on land values is
a very desirable thing, Turner’s bill is good
enough to make a start with, and a capital
subject for amendment in committee. No
honest Radical would think of voting against a
first experiment in advanced legislation. The
people of Victoria will see in this M'Kenzie-
Graham alliance a reason for making the pro-
posed land-tax progressive enough to silence
bogus objections.
Concerning - Over Legislation.
During the session just ended the Maoriland
Government introduced 193 bills- and carried
101. “ What will other communities think of
us ?” wails the Wellington correspondent of the
“Only fancy that, in a colony contain-
ing 700,000 people altogether, no fewer than
193 public bills were brought down. . . . after
an eight months’ recess, for a mere handful of
people who would scarcely be missed out of
London, Paris, New York, or even Liverpool
or Manchester.” This gent le ass—who evidently
doesn’t know that neither Liverpool nor Man-
chester ever contained 700,000 people all told
is only one of a large class which sneers at
“ colonial ” legislation on the ground that there
is far too much of it for the population. The
same high-class jibe turns up periodically in
the English press, the idea apparently being that
the number of statutes required for the govern-
ment of a country is a mere matter of popula-
tion, and that if there are 1000 laws in force in
a community of 100,000,000 souls, therefore one
law should be enough for a population of
100,000. This view may be right from an
arithmetical standpoint, but otherwise it is
idiotic. If there were only 200 people in all
Britain, and they lived together in one village,
it would require almost as many statutes’
written or unwritten, to keep them straight as
it does just now in the case of 35 millions.
And if Australasia were made one State, with one
Parliament, it would require hardly any more
legislation than Tasmania does at present. Just
now there are probably 2000 statutes—local and
English—in force in Victoria, and they w - ere all
as applicable to Elijah Cockroft as if they
had been made for him and for no one else, yet
the law hanged him a few days ago as a person
who was beyond control or reclamation. There-
fore, if Cockroft and his victim, Fanny Mott,
had constituted the whole population amenable
to the law, it would seem that it required more
than 2000 statutes to keep that one miserable
little jockey in the path he should go. Legis
lation isn’t a matter of arithmetic.
The Banks and the Land-tax.
The Vic. Assembly— or, rather, the Conserva-
tive end of that august body—badly wants to re-
lix the Land-tax in a fashion which will temper
the wind to the shorn bank. Both the Vic-
torian and New South Wales Land-tax schemes
profess to be modelled to some extent on tl e
Maoriland law, that being practically the only
working model in the seven provinces. In
Maoriland, land and mortgages held by private
individuals aie taxed on the same basis, but
mortgages held by banks and building societies
are exempted, as a mere matter of convenience
and to save the trouble of auditing such an im-
mense mass of securities, and these institutions
pay instead an income-tax upon their net
profits. The scheme works well enough
in Maoriland, where things are in a
normal condition ; but in Victoria the profits
of bank and building societies are about as
scarce as feathers on an elephant, and the
same plan applied there would practically
exempt these institutions from taxation for
years to come. Therefore, the Tory section
of the Assembly, which utterly loathes all the
other aspects of the Maoriland Land-tax policy,
approves of this particular aspect most
cordially, and calls on the Government to
follow the noble example of Ballance as closely
as possible. If it does the result will be a
woeful gap in the revenue; if it doesn’t the
land-tax will probably, in one or two cases, be
the last straw on the back of the financial
camel, and that animal will go down suddenly
in the centre, leaving the two ends of him
stacking up among the ruins. Then there will
be a liquidation, and the properties which are
now being held as security for hopeless over-
drafts w'ill be sold to separate owners, and tfie
long agony of trying to “restore confidence ”
will be ended. Also, the country’s aggregate
debt to England will be somewhat reduced
owing to the fact that a good deal of the Eng-
lish deposit-money will be lost in the general
wreck. There are many arguments to be
advanced on both sides of the question, but bn
the whole the right course seems to be to levy
the tax all round without respect of persons or
corporations, and let events take their course.
After all, no one really knows for certain what
that course will be. The effect of a land-tax,
or any other tax, applied to such an unhealthy
concern as the average Victorian bank is at
present, is most uncertain. The consequence of
it, on a reasonably healthy body, is known by
experience, but it has never within recent times
been tried on a cripple quite so far gone as the
one now in question. Therefore it is, to some
extent, an experiment. If it proves to have a
healing influence, well and good; if it doesn’t,
the country will have the satisfaction of know-
ing that it used up the cripple in a good cause.
Australian “Private Wealth.”
One of the things of which Australians are
inordinately proud is that the private wealth of
Australia, per head of population, is greater
than that of any other country upon earth.
The Bulletin has heard so much about this
glorious pre-eminence that it seems about time
that somebody put his foot through the bubble.
More than three-fourths of the alleged wealth
of Australia consist of lands and improve-
ments. These lands and improvements have
always been estimated on a boom valuation ;
this country has never yet, even at its worst
times, got down to the bedrock of solid reality.
It is one of the ascertained facts of economic
science that the more money—gold, silver and
undepreciated paper—there is in actual circula-
tion, the higher values and wages go, while as
money grows scarce, or is hoarded up in
banks, dr otherwise goes out df active c'ir'cu-


lation, values and wages go down. It matters
nothing whether the money is borrowed,
stolen, or legitimately acquired; the result is
the same. Australasia has borrowed more
money, publicly and privately, than any other
community of its size upon earth, and has lived
in a constant state of boom as a consequence.
When it can’t borrow any more, prices will
presently find their level, and Australasia will
suddenly discover that instead of owning £309
of private wealth per head and being the
richest community on earth, its assets have
dropped to about £l5O, and it is a poor, hard-
up, tenth-rate concern of no special account.
Just now the introduction and circulation
throughout Australasia of £10,000,000 in gold
would probably make a boom that would add
£100,000,000 to the nominal wealth of the
country; and the withdrawal from circulation
of the same amount would cause a “slump”
that would knock £150,000,000 or so off the
national alleged assets. The Bulletin’s
opinion is that the so-called private wealth of
Australasia is at least 40 per cent, boom and
bunkum.
Insolvent Politicians.
According to New South Wales law no in-
solvent can retain his seat in the Assembly,
therefore J. F. Cullen, M.L.A. for Willoughby,
last week resigned his parliamentary office and
filed his schedule simultaneously. Now a new
election is in progress, and the same Cullen,
who is just as insolvent as he w'as a week ago,
is a candidate. Seeing that the law authorises
Cullen —or Dibbs, or Parkes, or anyone else
to go into the House again, if he can get there,
before he has even got his certificate, the
advantages of throwing out Cullen —or anyone
else —in the first place are not very apparent.
The only possible reason why a bankrupt should
resign is that his financial collapse may be
caused —in fact, is very frequently caused—by
more or less disgraceful conduct on his own
part, and therefore his constituents should have
an opportunity of expressing their opinion as
to whether he is a fit person to represent them.
On the other hand, however, a man sometimes
goes bankrupt because he wouldn’t save himself
by dishonorable means when he had an oppor-
tunity of doing so, in which case insolvency
is a virtue rather than otherwise. But Cullen,
like other New South Wales legislators in
the same position, goes to his constituents
before any attempt has been made to investi-
gate his affairs, and asks them to pronounce
judgment in a case concerning which they know
absolutely nothing; consequently, they may
return him enthusiastically as an honorable
man in distress, and afterwards find that they
have been deceived ; or they may reject him
off-hand as a dishonorable bankrupt, only to
learn later on that he has been a victim of mis-
fortune or of other men’s dishonesty. In short,
they are invited to express an opinion upon
Cullen’s doings, without any authentic infor-
mation as to what Cullen’s doings are. The
law which compels a man to vacate his seat on
becoming insolvent, and then allows him to go
back to Parliament without first getting his
certificate, does not enable his constituents to
maintain the purity of Parliament in any sense;
it merely enables them to decide whether
they want a poor man to represent them
or not. Unless it is intended to lay down
the axiom that it is a disgraceful thing not to
have any money, and that, consequently, when
a member has lost his money his constituents
should have an opportunity of saying whether
they will or will not overlook the loathsome
circumstance, an M.L.A. might just as logically
be required to go up for re-election when he
gets married, or gets engaged to a red-headed
girl, or is fined for drunkenness, or becomes the
father of twins, or when he gets his leg cut off.
The statute which gives to an electorate a
special opportunity of rejecting its member
simply because he has lost his money —for that
is all the electorate is allowed to pronounce
upon—should certainly give it an equal chance
to reject him when he has lost his leg. A man
may lose his leg under so many disgraceful cir-
cumstances that the logic of one course is quite
as apparent as that of the other.
Unearned Increment and Undeserved
Decrement.
Young barrister Moule, M.L.A. (Vic.), ousted
Bent, and for this deed he is become a tin god
on wheels. He opposed the land-tax, and 10, a
Daniel come to judgment ! This is considered
his crowning triumph of logic :
If Government was going to tax the unearned incre-
ment, then the logical deduction would be that it was
bound to repay the undeserved decrement.
This speech must be edited thus :
If the Government was going to tax the unearned in-
crement, then the logical deduction would be that it was
bound to pay a tax on the undeserved decrement.
Or:
If the Government was going to appropriate the un-
earned increment, then the logical deduction would be
that it was bound to compensate for the undeserved
decrement.
Special pleader Moule was careful not to par-
ticularise the decrement referred to. As the
increment relates to the price originally paid
for alienation from the State, the decrement
must relate to the same thing, and it would be
pretty safe to say that there is not a hundred
square miles of freehold in Australia now worth
less than what the State got for them. If the
voice of the State declares for the appro-
priation of all unearned increment (as
a part from land-nationalisation) then it will
be a small matter, and possibly just, for
the State to resume, at the price it actually
Sot, the land that has suffered decrement. The
State has, of course, nothing to do with the
incidental losses in land-trafficking. Even the
land used in the confidence-tricks of the boom
is at this moment worth times over what
Government got for it. In the interval between
land monopoly and land nationalisation, which
must come, The Bulletin is perfectly willing
to adopt the doctrine that unearned increment
and undeserved decrement should beconsidere !
together.
Care should be taken, while adopting English
Acts in Australia, that obnoxious English in-
stitutions are not unwittingly adopted with
them. The Sale of Goods Bill before Vic. Par-
liament contains a section concerning contracts
by infants for necessaries which are stated to
be “goods suitable to the condition in life of
such infant,” &c., &c. As a matter of fact,
this is in our law already from other sources,
but only on occasions like this do such provi-
sions see the light of day, and then is the time
to expunge them. No democracy should toler-
ate caste expressions in its statute-book. All
persons are supposed, by one of those bold
fictions so dear to English jurisprudence, to be
equal before the law—but their children are to
be treated differently, according to their con-
dition in life. This “ condition in life ” theory,
it will be remembered, formed the basis of the
recent monstrously-tyrannical decision of
N.S.W. Supreme Court in the M‘Whannell
case, where it was effectually held, despite the
award of .£3OOO damages by a jury, that .£l5OO
was quite enough for the support of a little girl
who had lost her leg through the default of de-
fendants, the N.S. W. Railway Commissioners.
The provision in the Yic. Bill is well-meant,
and is in the interests of tradesmen, but it
rasps on the democratic ear.
One important feature of New South Wales
newspaper libel - law was overlooked by
O’Sullivan and his party in the Assembly,
the other night. Why should a news-
paper proprietor, found guilty of libel, cast
in damages, and auctioned out, be further
sent to gaol for 12 months if the sum realised
by the sale of his assets fall short by a cent of
the amount demanded ? A rich proprietor or
company may pay judgment of £lOOO, a poor
one cannot, and that the rich defendant by
paying escapes gaol whereas the other is
gaoled for 12 months is opposed to the
whole spirit of modern law. Of course,
the assumption is that a libel may be
maliciously written, and by someone who, for an
atrocious purpose, may be willing to sacrifice
his ten-pound plant to a bailiff; but why not
test the assumption by trying him criminally
before a jurj 7 for the specific malice or atrocity
and so determining his actual guilt ? As it is,
and as it has frequently been, the country pro-
prietor, or city propi ietor of a small paper, is
sold out to pay for what is properly a debt, and
is then sent to prison if the amount realised is
not up to the mark. Reform should take the
direction of enabling the libeller, whose libel
has not been shown to have originated in
malice or culpable carelessness, to relieve him-
self by insolvency of the debts incurred in the
action and left unpaid after the sale of his
assets.
The Argus often attempts to be funny
without success ; and it is only really
comical in its most serious moments. Here
is a recent Argus effort to squelch the
Turner Land-tax proposals: “Every step
taken that is likely to increase values in town
and country is a step towards prosperity, and
every step taken that lowers values is towards
disaster.” So we learn, too late, that every step
of the wild-boom gallop was towards pros-
perity ! In any case, the proposition, which is
introduced as “ staring every honest man in the
face,” is blatant humbug—most of the steps
taken that inflate land-values are simply
schemes for plundering the people. The humor
of this outburst follows in the statement that
this contention is adopted from Mr. Reid,
M.P. for Toorak, “ who speaks with the weight
of long experience of the management of sound
and successful land-dealing institutions.”
“Land-dealing institutions!” not land -using
institutions, but buyers and sellers, sharks,
monopolists, and mortgagees ! And these are
thy prophets, O Israel !
Dear Bulletin, —In newspaper columns and in
conversation our fishermen are constantly re-
proached for confining themselves to harbors
and rivers. They are urged to copy the hardy
fishers of the North Sea, to steer into open
water and return with a harvest of deep-sea
fish. But as long as Australia is Australia this
will never happen. Eastwards from Britain
there extends a submarine plain so shallow
that until a late geological period it was dry
land, and from its surface the trawls have often
swept the bones of the extinct elephants whose
herds once pastured there. These are the
finest fishing-grounds in Europe, perhaps in
the world. But let a mariner sail east-
wards from Sydney Heads twice as far
as the lighthouse shines, and he will
float over an abyss so profound that were the
tallest peak of the Alps there hove into the sea
its summit would disappear beneath the waves.
From those dark depths no food-fish could be
procured, even if, as is improbable, they there
exist in any quantity. Nor is the narrow belt
between the New South Wales coast-line and
the 2000-fathom abyss available, for every
trawl launched there experimentally has been
wrecked on uncharted reefs and crags. A
more promising source for recruiting the fish-
supply of Sydney is Lord Howe Island, where
comparativeiy shallow seas teem with excellent
fish, which good management, including fast
steamers, might place upon the New South
Wales markets fresh, or, if need were, alive.—
C. Hedley. Sydney, Nov. 24, 1894.
Speight, as a preliminary to taking further
action against David Syme, w'ants to get a
copy of the Judge’s notes on the last trial at
less than regulation price. The Judge’s notes
are at the disposal of his associate (his son, as
usual), who kindly supplies copies at the rate
of a shilling per folio of 72 words—six words a
penny. Speight provides matter for 7150
folios, yet he expects to get a full copy for less
than £357 10s. The Victorian Judges get
something under £3oooa year each, and yet have
the gall to allow their son-associates to charge
more, by over 1000 per cent., than the market
price of copying notes, which notes are public
property. The shilling-a-folio-judge’s-note
system which prevails throughout Australia is
sheer shameless robbery and extortion. When
t he Judge’s son-associate does supply copies of
ids pa’s notes he takes most excellent care not
to copy them himself. As a rule he sweats
some poor devil of a typewriter, and makes 900
per cent, or so on the transaction. Why
should not some of the industrious and intelli-
gent women and men now wearing out their
fingers in trying to get a crust at type-writing
be appointed to copy Judges’ notes at a fair
price—say, one-fifth of the rate now grabbed
by the gilded and haughty children of judicial
nepotism—without the intervention of any well-
connected sweater ?
Mr. G. H. Greene, the unseated member for
Grenfell (N.S. W.), justly complains that, under
the existing Electoral Law, an unseated mem-
ber has no opportunity afforded him of lodging
a subsequent petition against the right of his
substitute to sit in Parliament, even though
that substitute may be disqualified under
statute. Which is quite possible. It is
notorious that, some four years ago, a man who
was legally incompetent to sit in New South
Wales Parliament was returned to Parliament,
and received his Parliamentary salary for
several months, though, as a matter of fact, he
never once entered the Legislative Chamber
while the House was sitting. (Memo. —The
right to draw Parliamentary salary should be
made dependent on the right to sit). To this
day his late constituents nurse a grievance
against him on this account, and the great
majority of them are ignorant of the cause that
kept him absent from his seat in the House.
Though his election had not been chal-
lenged, he was liable to a fine of ,£5O
every time he sat. Again, it is notorious
that an electioneering candidate at last New
South Wales election was triply disqualified
either to stand for, or sit in, Parliament, and
yet he opposed a Minister of the Crown. The
Willard esdandre is very small potatoes com-
pared with what might have followed the elec-
tion of this personage.
Pitt Town (N.S. Wales) Labor Settlement
Board of Control, which has threatened to
resign about once a month ever since the settle-
ment was started, has actually carried out its
threat, and the Minister is left with its bantling
on his hands. A member of the Board now
writes to the papers making excuses for the
mismanagement which has been one important
cause of the settlement’s failure, and complains
that the plan was ruined through the Govern-
ment subsidy being given in driblets. As Par-
liament voted two sums of about .£2300 each,
w hich were put in the Board’s hands to do as
it pleased with, it is plain that the Board is
itself to blame for the dribbling. Had it
chosen, the saw-mill and other large works
could just as easily have been undertaken out
of the first subsidy as out of the second. It has
been made abundantly clear that the Board’s
noble notions cannot efficiently take the place
of business capacity ; and now, after having
spent nearly ,£5500 of public money, and wasted
100 men’s labor for 15 months, the settlement
under its charge is no nearer being self-support-
ing than when it started. The Board does well
to resign.
Parkes’s speech denouncing the Reid Ministry
might have been made by the historical fox
which is impotently licking its chops beneath
the sour grapes. The old man has once too
often taken his pitcher to the well—he has once
too often presumed on the weakness of Reid
and the kick-enduring capacity of the hind-
quarters of “ the great New South Wales
Pr.eetrade party.” Parkes signed his own
death-warrant in his abusive letter scorning the
offer of a seat at the banquet to the man who
had taken a leadership which the old man while
huffed rejected with scorn. The veteran’s
proper caper, as most people clearly saw at the
time, would have been to attend the banquet
and act the skeleton thereat. The Reid party
would all have sung small in his presence and
felt very uncomfortable, and when the weak-
lings had done cackling about their miserable
little provincial victory the grisly old Parkes
could have stood up and delivered a strong and
well-considered oration on the wide question of
Federation. This would have kept him in
touch with what used to be literally his party ;
and as the Reid party began to crumble away,
H. Parkes could have swept up the fragments
into his basket. Now, that is impossible. It

The bleeding of Surgeon Beaney’s estate by the
Melb. legal fraternity should be a warning to
all vain-glorious individuals wdio devote their
wealth to purposes of post-mortem advt.
Surgeon Beaney, as Bulletin readers are
aware, died about three years ago, after having
carefully willed the great bulk of his money to
charities at home and abroad, each request
being saddled with one or more harmless con-
ditions intended to preserve the name of
Beaney from that oblivion which is the lot of
dead surgeons in general. The chief item in
this testament was a sum of ,£lO,OOO, for found-
ing a Beaney Institute at Canterbury (Eng.).
Beaney, no doubt, was satisfied by his legal
adviser as to the validity of the Canterbury
bequest, and he expected his orders from the
tomb to be executed without demur. But one
of the Beaney wdll-executors was a lawyer.
The first duty of the lawyer aforesaid was to
assure himself that the instructions of his
deceased friend were sound in law, where-
fore he carried the Canterbury bequest
matter before Judge A’Beckett, in a friendly
spirit, and asked whether a certain musty
statute of mortmain didn’t invalidate this
particular clause. Judge A’Beckett ruled
that the aged statute had nothing to do with
the case, thus confirming the opinion of the
lawyers who had drafted the will. By this
time the Melbourne charities interested in poor
Beaney’s residuary estate were up in arms.
They were advised to appeal to the Full Court
against Judge A’Beckett’s ruling, and a
majority of the Full Court thought the statute
of mortmain did apply to the Canterbury
bequest, which must accordingly be struck out,
leaving the ,£lO,OOO to swell the blessed residue.
Justice A’Beckett represented a scornful
minority. He reiterated his former conception
of the almighty law. Then the Canterbury
trustees appealed to the Privy Council against
the finding of the Melb. Full Court, and the
Privy Court has just decided that A’Beckett
was right, and the statute of mortmain does not
apply, and the Full Court is an ass, and the
conscientious legal executor discovered a mare’s
nest, and all the costs of all the abortive pro-
ceedings are to come out of the long-suffering
estate. Wanted to know the total amount
expended in fooling about with Beaney’s will ?
Melbourne’s Presbyterian conscience is just
now inflamed by an accusation of “immorality”
against an unknown elder. Miss Sutherland,
an active and practical church-worker who has
said sundry unpleasant things concerning
Scottish saints, actually stated, under pn v na-
tion, that she knew of one particular saint
who “leads an immoral life.” The lady wished
to withdraw her charge as soon as she had
uttered it, but the Presbyterian conscience
declines to be appeased in this way, and a
section of the Kirk can’t sleep for wanting to
have the matter sifted to the very bottom.
Immorality in an elder is abominable in the
sight of other elders and the Lord, provided
there be ladies in the case. Hard-faced pietists
of the Presbyterian, or any other religious per-
suasion for that matter, acknowledge only
one bad brand of immorality, viz., the
brand which is patronised by their
brighter, brainier, and larger-hearted fellow-
creatures. The pet failing of the lively un-
believer is, by all devout hypocrites, recog-
nised as the sin of sins. Whosoever prayeth
regularly and runneth not after strange women
—or is not seen running after them, which
amounts to the same thing—cannot be held
guilty of immorality. The meaner and the
much more unkindly vices count for nothing in
a churchman, as long as he isn’t sexually im-
moral. Fraud revels in this damnable doctrine.
Hatred, malice, and uncharitableness pin the
creed upon their black-coated chests. And the
more that a Melbourne elder deserves to be in
gaol for his financial crimes the louder he howls
at “ immorality,” and insists upon knowing the
truth concerning any less inhuman bigot who
has gone astray.
Apropos to Matthew Davies’ certificate and
the Melbourne Full Court’s statement that the
Daviesian “ tentacle ” companies were legiti-
mate speculations which failed through sheer
misfortune—here are some interesting extracts
from ancient history. After the failure of the
Mercantile Bank, in 1892, the Australian
Mail published a report of an interview with
Manager Millidge in London. Millidge
said :
When I saw the press was writing down the concerns
with which Sir Matthew Davies was connected, I con-
sidered that it was wiser to reduce our commitment nn
these concerns. . . . I protested over and over again
about these advances. Hut when anything was said
against them Sir Matthew repudiated the thing, and
upon one occasion I well remember that when an advance
to one of his companies was queried, he told us in the
board-room that he would pay off all the advances made
to his companies in a fortnight. You can have no idea < f
the absolute confidence the man inspired us with. . . .
The old series of Davies concerns came down one on top
of the other in wild confusion.
The real story of Matthew’s “ misfortunes ”
is somewhat different to the Full Court’s
version. Those 30 rotten companies, from
which he, in one way or other, derived tens of
thousands of pounds for spending purposes,
were built solely upon his connection with the
Mercantile. The Mercantile was beguiled and
bluffed into supporting them, despite protests
from the manager, and “ some of the directors,”
and when this means of support was exhausted
the accursed things toppled over in wild con-
fusion. Yet the Full Court gravely referred to
Matthew’s private balance-sheets, wherein the"
assets were represented by shares in the afore-
said companies, as proof that the gentleman
was a bona-fide millionaire until the companies
all failed at one fell swoop owing to circum-
stances over which he had no control.
If the Wesleyan Church had no Foreign Mis-
sions the general public would die, like heathen,
without having heard of S. Dyer, J. Hunt,
or Cox. Certain utterances of these famous
men are quoted in the Wesleyan Foreign Mis-
sions circular—that useful circular which is
illustrated with a plan showing how much of
the world is spiritually black, and how the rest
of it is shaded off until it attains the delicate
grey of Protestantism. Quotations from Dyer,
Hunt, and Cox are final arguments in favor of
loading up the pore heathen with a full know-
ledge of salvation. They seem to blaze out of
the paper like words of fire. “ Let thousands
of us die, but let Africa be saved,” says Cox.
“ If I thought anything could prevent me dying
for China, the thought would crush me,” states
S. Dyer. “Oh,” cries the clerical person
described as J. Hunt, “ Oh, let me pray once
more for Fiji!” Yet these three gigantic intel-
lects have to depend upon a mere tract for
fame, and we perish in ignorance of their
names, unless some humble laborer in the vine-
yard happens to drop the intimation aforesaid
over one’s garden fence.
When Westralia was a Crown colony jobbing
was rampant, and led to valuable concessions
being obtained for next to nothing by those “ in
the swim.” It’s bad enough that millions of
acres of land should have been given away to
men who held for a rise only, but the most
monstrous calamity that could arise from private
concessions has, The Bulletin hears, only just
arisen. A very old-established timber co.,
which had been of service to the authorities,
obtained, in the Crown settlement days, a per-
petual exemption from duties upon any goods
it might import into Westralia; but, strange
to say, it is only within the last few weeks
the co. has found that, although the ex-'
emption was intended to be confined only to
machinery and other requirements of its
timber-trade, the wording of the exempt ion deed
is such that the co. can import anything it
pleases without paying a penny duty. The co.
is alive to the flaw now, has indeed already
claimed and got exemption on a test indent, and
is now proceeding to go in for the biggest
general merchandise business in the province.
Of course, no merchant paying duty can possibly
compete with the co.’s duty-free goods ; and this
possibly means that the co. will either have
to be paid an enormous indemnity to forego its
privilege or that the merchants of Westralia
will have to shut up shop and clear out.

A certain feeble and meagre washiness is
the most notable feature of “The Foundling,’’
now in possession at Sydney Lyceum. This
alleged > farce arrived, accompanied by many
eulogistic press notices, from London, and its
weakness and general desolation only prove once
more that the British press takes its humor in a
chastened spirit and laughs on small provocation.
There is nothing in it to justify its existence. It
is as hopelessly confused as a disturbance on an
ant-heap, and there is no more visible cause why
it should have been brought all the way from
England to Australia than there is why a brick
should be carried from China to Peru. The plot,
which has no special connection with itself or any-
thing else, consists mainly in a rather stout young
man coming-in at intervals and saying that he
must find his mother, in pursuance of which
resolve he accuses himself of being the illegitimate
offspring of his intended mother-in-law and
various other ladies, and bids them settle it
among them. The rest of the story is made
up of a major, who receives letters from
a ballet-girl; a loud cad, who appears
at intervals and makes sundry rude remarks
to the ladies; and a girl, who claims, for no
possible reason, to be the wife of the foundling
hereinbefore mentioned. The ballet-girl and the
loud cad, after coming in many times and going
out again, at last go out altogether, leaving no
traces and no coherent explanation behind them.
The alleged marriage drops out of sight. The
alleged mothers come in occasionally and talk
about their characters, and faint up against each
other, and then leave. And, finally, a large, fat
man enters, instead of a climax, and things come
to a large, fat conclusion generally.
• * •
The gallery laughed vociferously three
times at the opening performance—once when the
foundling stated that he had stayed out all night,
once when he said he didn’t want to stay out
another night, and once when his alleged wife said
that he would have to stay out all night again.
The reason of his staying out was his desire not to
compromise the lady’s reputation, and the gallery
laughed as a consequence. / If he had stayed in
all night it would probably have laughed still more
cordially. The company is only a trifle less dis-
jointed than the comedy. Clifton Alderson
plays his solemnly fatuous part in a
nondescript fashion, and doesn’t rise to the
occasion even once. His very reasonable excuse
is probably that there isn’t One single occa-
sion to rise to ; even the highest occasion of the
lot could only be reached by going down a lift.
Misses Watt-Tanner and Housley, and one or two
other persons, held up their respective characters
capably, but there is so little apparent connection
between the characters that some of them might
have been held up in Sydney and the others in
Dubbo without any injury to the sequence of
things. Mr. Roberts, in particular, though his
cad is a good feature in his way, is> so absolutely
superfluous that he might have been quite as well
represented if his language had arrived by tele-
gram, or had come to hand on a post-card,
** * *
Even Mr. Rignold’s splendid rendering of
Jacques, the hunky elder brother, doesn’t seem
able to keep the “ Two Orphans ” going longer at
Sydney Majesty’s than the usual fortnight, and
“ Ransomed ” is announced for next Saturday.
The two special points about this drama are that
it is a local production based on local incidents,
and that Miss Dora Mostyn—concerning whom
The Bulletin felt called upon to use much com-
mendatory language during a recent Melb. season
—will play the leading character.

A new departure has been made in Irish
drama, at Sydney Royal, by leaving out the
praste. In all other respects “The Wearin’ o’
the Green ” is a legitimate production, but the
absence of the praste lifts it into an entirely new
region of literature. The space which is usually
occupied by his reverence is filled, in the present
instance, by the insertion in Act 11. of an Irish
variety-show, free fight, or other diversion of no
very well-defined character. It is bright and
musical, however, and the soggarth is neither;
therefore, the change is for the better. There is
no especial fault to be found with Fennymore’s
drama, save that it has all the beauties and
improbabilities—-and they are many—of Irish
drama in general, and as the most improbable
thing on earth becomes probable if it only happens
often enough, even this objection is steadily
diminishing. The present production is notable as
containing about the most finished and thoroughly
artistic informer going, and J. P. West puts some
extra fine touches on the character by the realistic
manner in which he flaps his ear with his
shrivelled hand in moments of reflection. Like
most informers, he is hump-backed and gone in
one leg, which peculiarities of the race suggest
that the informer is generally struck by lightning
when very young. Miss Virginia Vivienne is a
pretty colleen who has comparatively little to do
save look beautiful and be faithful to Alfred
Woods, the bright young hero, and Miss
Austen Eliot is another colleen of the
same pattern. As for the wicked landlord
oons * :a bul ar y, and the peasantry, and the
M Ginnis and the O’Leary, and the Rooney and
the O’Hooligan, they are well and apparently
happy, and the same may be said of the Murphy and
the O’Connor. The scenery is all that any Irish
drama can expect, and an explosion in a cave,
where the wicked landlord .attempts to blow up
the colleen and others, is a realistic effect. “The
Streets of London,” last played in Sydney by
Charles Warner, seven years ago, is announced
for Saturday.
** * *
“Meg,” which was revived at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday, is a Maggie Moore melodrama
of some merit. The rugged grandeur of its natural
absurdity shows touches of human nature, and the
various characters do impossible things upon a
well-defined plan, with an air of conviction that
goes a long way in matters of this kind. Given
Maggie Moore as the chief character, and the suc-
cess of “ Meg ” explains itself, for at one time or
other that idol of the masses has drawn dividends
from much less promising investments. “Meg”
reveals Maggie Moore in about 15 bursts of
humor and pathos; also, the action of the piece
stands still on occasion whilst she sings a song.
Generally speaking, Maggie is a wandering
daughter of adversity, in faded garments, hunting
for somebody’s eheeild. Her search for this lost
treasure—who, as it happens, was stolen by a dog-
fancier in revenge for an outrage committed upon
his bull-pup—ends in her elevation to polite
society. _ A wealthy young uncle of the abstracted
infant disguises himself as a coffee-stall keeper,
and pushes his light refreshments around London
in the best interests of the drama. Maggie having
found the little boy, the wealthy uncle discovers
the nobility of Maggie’s character with the aid of
blue spectacles, and a mutual affection springs up
between them in a garret. So, finally, the boy’s
loving uncle converts the apotheosised Maggie into
a loving aunt, _ and the grieving parents are
restored to their progeny in a most affecting
manner, and the rascally proprietor of the bull-
pup gets badly left. Oily Deering’s little sketch
of the pessimistic dawg-fancier aforesaid is the
next best thing to Maggie Moore’s warm-hearted
conception of the street waif. J. H. Roberts, as
the preposterous uncle, is also as satisfactory as
the part allows him to be; and the rest of the
company, including the lost child, compare more
than favorably with the bull-pup, who fails to
appear at all, A word of praise is also due to the
supernumeraries, who pelt a costermonger with real
cabbages from his own barrow, and send him fly-
ing from the stage with a bunch of spinach in his
eye. “Meg” may have to make way for some-
thing else on Saturday.

“ Morocco Bound,” at the Bijou, has been
strengthened by the introduction of three scraggy
fakirs from India who perform the old basket-
trick before the Vizier. Elsewhere the show ex-
hibits symptoms of decay on close inspection.
Two or three new people are rather less satis-
factory than those they replaced, and the Harem
seems to be smaller than at first, or else the bar-
baric attendants have diminished in numbers.
However, “Morocco Bound” remains a sub-
stantial entertainment at the price, and it ought
to run for another week certain.
** * *
Last nights of “ Nitouche ” and the Tab-
leaux are announced, although the management
has not yet fixed the sad day when Psyche, and
the Nymph of the Cascade, and the other agree-
able girls, must pass out of the programme. They
will be much missed when they go. Sometimes a
prudent matron may be seen rushing her husband
away in the very middle of the Tableaux, on the
ground that she wants to catch a train, but there
is no authenticated instance of a husband calling
his wife s attention to the time. A man gazing
at a tableau forgets the petty details of modern
life, and thinks of himself as a bachelor god thou-
sands of years 8.0.
** * *
The Earl of Yarmouth (where the bloater*
come from) appeared as the leading figure in a
variety show at Hobart Royal the other night,
and aroused a lot of interest. Yarmouth (where
the bloaters come from) is a lady-like young
person, with a feeble underjaw, and he performed
principally in skirts. A large audience rolled up
to consider the ways of the British aristocracy,
and went away considerably flabbergasted. Yar-
mouth’s first striking appearance was “in a loose
white wrapper, with blue ribbons, and with a
flowing wig of soft brown hair, falling below his
shoulders, in the capacity of a fair young wife,
whose husband was out on the burst. When the
curtain went up he was discovered rooking the
cradle ; and when he remarked that he was a poor
ill-used woman, some just person threw a vege-
table at him. He made a decidedly pretty
woman, as many girly young men would under
like circumstances. But, then, it was impossible
to forget that he was Yarmouth (where the
bloaters come from), and the proceedings left a
sickly feeling behind them, vaguely suggestive of
a cargo of bone-dust in the distance. Later on,
Yarmouth transpired in a short frock, two stoutish
legs clad in black stockings, and a sun-bonnet, and
did some high-kicking, the way he threw his brief
costume up into the air arousing much enthusiasm.
Next, the British nobleman did a skirt-dance, and
finally the limelight man threw a magic-lantern
portrait of Queen Victoria on to his frock, which
he held up with both his hands to form a back-
ground, and then the show either finished with
the Unnatural Anthem, or ought to have done so.
The private opinion of a good many people con-
cerning the noble earl’s display is that a young
man in woman’s clothes is a coarse, disgusting
spectacle, and that an old man in woman’s clothes
is ditto, or nearly ditto. The fact that Yarmouth
was throwing his brief skirt around to raise funds
for the local Girls’lndustrial School and Dorcas
Society is interesting, in a sense, as showing that
Dorcas societies get money in all sorts of ways,
even by the exhibition of partially-undressed
peers in petticoats. How much undressed the
peer has to be before the Dorcas Society feels
called upon to swear off is an unknown quantity.
Possibly it would draw the line at a duke appear-
ing publicly under a shower-bath.
At Poverty Point.
, Actors in the first flight don’t publicly smoke pipes in
Frisco. Harry Jewett’s manager requested him to ctase
public pipe-smoking—“ You may smoke a cigar, sir, it
you choose, but not a pipe. Remember, sir, the status of
my company; what will the public think? If you will
persist in smoking a pipe, I shall be under the"painful
necessity of immediately cancelling your engagement.”
The Urso campaign (so says husband Lufere) has been
thoroughly enjoyable, but not a financial success. As the
famous entrepreneur has three or four flourishing con-
cerns in America at present, his failure to rake in the
Australian shekels doesn’t cause him much uneasiness.
Sydney D.T. last week had an advt.: “ Wanted, Lady
or ,Gent., few pounds, to join first-class dramatic co.”
Just so. Frst-class dramatic companies in Australia have
fallen on evil times. And first-class dramatic companies
have no choice in sex, so long as the “few pounds” are
all right. Female pounds will do as well as male pounds.
Perhaps the first-class dramatic co. wouldn’t object to a
lady and gent, each with a few pounds?
Melba (writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent)
has given great offence to the English musicians by
engaging John Lemmone, her Australian flautist, to
accompany her on tour. Men like John Radcliffe and
William Barrett, who are, or consider themselves to be,
much superior to the “ invader,” are very sore at being
cut out. They argue that they, as old English per-
formers, have a first claim to engagement, but Melba and
Mr. Dan Meyer think differently. After all, if Melba
prefers a countryman, why should she not have him?
Rose Musgrove, pretty daughter of George, of “ the
firm,” is showing great prbmise as a mummer in sundry
amateur performances round Melb. Rose has to take the
name of Howard because, pa has put his veto on her stage
aspirations. As yet she is early in her teens and frocks,
so there is time to wear down the parental objections.
Dear Bulletin,— Re your Railway-Commissioner yarn.
I was a two-shilling moujik in a former production of Rig.
nold’s “Siberia,” and, one night, when we were thirsting
for the blood of the Israelite, another Moujik admonished
me, lotto voce, to “ Get further up the stage, and be
“ “* ’ “Be d d, yourself !” I answered with a
promptitude that forthwith “severed my connection”—
for the other fellow was the stage-manager.—M.
Critic William Archer on the London tableaux vivantg,
from which those now on show at the Melb. Princess’ are
copies:—“ If there is one thing more offensive than the
cant of purity, it is the cant of art. Let us have no mis-
take about it —as art, these tableaux are contemptible.
They are tawdry copies of third-rate shop-nudities, in
which the jumbled conventions—the solid figure, the
painted background, the sheeny unreality of texture and
light—are merely distressing to the artistic sense.” By
“ sheeny unreality of texture ” Arche'r means the skin-
tights the poseuses wear. But surely absolute “reality ”
would be too much to—well, shall we say “expect,” or
“hope for?”
Composer Gov. Robinson declined to come before the
curtain in answer to the call for “composer,” but tardily
bowed his acknowledgments from the box.
Cyril Tyler and his mother are still located in Mel-
bourne, the career of Cyril, as a boy soprano, havih«-
seemingly come to an end—for the present, anyhow
Messrs. Howefls and Poole ran no risk with the youth’s
precarious voice. The terms of their agreement allowed
them to close Cyril’s engagement when his top notes
should begin to go, and seeing that the final concerts in
Melbourne turned out a failure they were doubtless glad
to detect a distinct crack in the organ. It has produced
about £2OOO a year for several years past.
Melbournian: “Abell and Klaer file their schedule.
The show dropped down in this city like a lump of lead
from the first night. Melbourne is a luckless shop for
worthy old Abell, beginning the world again on the verge
of his 70th year. He was stone-broke here a quarter of a
century ago, and narrate* how he lived a whole week on
biscuits.”
Jack Hesford, the best O’Callaghan now in Australia
is at present playing in a little dramatic co. which “silver
coins ” Melbourne suburbs. G. V. Brooke was the only
man who ever beat him in the part.
George Darrell calls himself an aetor-author-manager;
Dan Barry styles himself actor-manager; J. 0. William-
son is only a manager.
Melb. Velodrome show, which consisted chiefly of girls
in “ rational dress ” riding bicycles, was a howling frost
because the girls were dressed in frock coats, loose
knickers and gaiters, all of sober-colored tweeds. But, if
half the girls had been in tights, and the other half had
been trained to tumble off and exhibit even half as much
lingerie as the girls who turn heels-over-head and arrive
squatting on their hunkers in the “Morocco Bound”
pas de cinq, at Melb. Bijou, admission would have been
at a premium and seats booked weeks in advance. The
present version of the dance knocks the Sydney and
Princess version silly. What Melb. applauds now is legs
lace, and linen. ° ’
Tom Browning, once Melb.’s finest basso, now runs the
Stork Hotel, in that city. His hair and beard are now
white, and he weighs over 20 stone.
Madame Siraonsen’s insolvency is the end of a long and
plucky struggle. Italian opera bled Williamson and Mus-
grove, but drained dry poor Madame, who ransacked
Italy for the best talent. Assets, 10s. 1 Three years she
has been toiling under the load of debt to our worthy
friends, the Cutticas and Co., but now has to cave. There
will surely be no difficulty in arranging for her a splendid
benefit.
Viola: “ Mine. Siraonsen’s mistake, with her opera-
troupe, was the same made in regard to all the other un-
successful companies—not having an eminent leading
lady. This is the one thing needful, and it is no use
averaging a high expenditure over a quartette, or octette.
Melba comes either with nobody or a bundle of sticks.”
There is great excitement in New York over the new
Gaiety Co., which will shortly be in Australia. “As a
group on the stage, nothing lovelier has been seen in New
York for many a day. They do not wear tights. Heaven
forbid ! They wear skirts of the regulation length. Dr.
Parkhurst would probably find material for a sermon in
the wiggles which Miss Cissy Fitzgerald introduces into
her dance ; to a more liberal mind, these are a theme for
a song or a sonnet. When Miss Cissy sings, she is nice,
but when she dances the chappies say that she is very
very naughty. The leading lady of the Gaiety troupe is
Maud Hobson, a magnificent creature who can smile with
rosy lip, or on occasion play Juno to Blanche Massey’s 10,
and flash an eye like Ma’s to threaten and command.
Blanche is so sleek and placid that you quite understand
her metamorphosis into a white cow, and you cannot
blame Juno tor feeling savage over Jupiter’s attentions.
As you watch her, you think of another languishing
beauty of whom it was said ;
‘ A kind of sleepy Venus seemed Dudu,
Yet very lit to murder sleep in those
Who gazed upon her cheeks’ transcendent hue,
Her Attic forehead and her Phidian nose;
Few angles were there in her form, ’lis true.
Thinner she might have been and yet scarce lose,
Yet, after all, ’twould puzzle to say where
It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.’
The girls regard their visit to the United States in the
light of a lark. None of them have husbands, none of
them mothers; they appear to have been born in
Bohemia, and to lead, when they are at home, the
Bohemian life which Trilby led with les trois Angliches.
But, like her, they seem to have been born with an in-
stinctive taste which many women of fortune strive vainly
to acquire. Ladies crowd the theatre at matinees and
report that they always get a point in millinery from the
Gaiety girls. Sometimes it is a system of fluffy bows
which fall over garden-party gowns; sometimes a lovely
Watteau Empire toilet which is like a picture ; sometimes
a bonnet so captivating that it is positively artistic ;
sometimes a combination of white and black which over-
powers all combinations of color ; sometimes a pair of
lace gauntlets which are au ii spiration. Every matinde
is a lesson in the art of dressing. ’
Cully: "That amusing Malapropism of the Thespian
boniface reminds me of Ophelia’s funeral. It was hard
for me to keep my countenance absolutely rigid, as the
poor girl lay there in the house, with the mourners
gathered. Her father was not Polonius, but the splendid
burlesque actor, Turko the Terrible, now bent in one
bow of woe, and crying, the poor fellow, as he shook
hands with Danny Mann, Mrs. Candour, and the legs-and-
wings Girard dancer. A preternaturally solemn gentle-
man, familiar as the Clown, had a finger to his eye as he
directed the undertaker’s men to be gentle. It seemed
an awful bal-masque, out of dress.’*
The renovated and rebuilt St. George’s Hall, Melb., has
been snapped up by Cogill Bros., who intend running
both the Oxford and St. George’s. The idea of running
two companies is to collar all the best talent, and so spoil
Biokards’s Melbourne chances.
Dampier has trot Mrs. Anna Ruppert, of “ complexion-

Our old hairy friend, “ Professor Richard, M.E.,” hag

costs. The “ Professor ” blubbered in court, pleaded
ignorance of the law, and flourished his Australian testi-
monials, among them being one alleged to come from
Private-sec. Wallington.

Ex-amateur actor P. J. Duggan, now a professional

Poor Parkes is eating mice in his old age.
He now speaks “at Parramatta” before an
audience of 200, “mostly ladies.” Summary :
Can’t be suspected of wanting office. Resigned
lots of times when he needn’t have done so. If
he could choose for himself he would never go to
the beastly Assembly again ; but patriotism must
ever be paramount. A time had come when the
stomach (the hated Reid, of course) was governing
the brains (Parkes) of the body politic. The
country s destinies were now in feeble hands.
Reid was a reckless babbler ; Reid was no
leader, for he had been elected. Now,
Mister Gladstone had never been elected.
You couldn t elect a leader. Reid was
quick in answering interruptions—he barked like
ill-bred dog. The Reid Local Government
Bill was a fraud and a delusion. The Reid
Government was prolific in slop opinions and
shoddy bills. He (Parkes) would never support
any Local Government .Bill under which the
general Treasury was not to aid the municipalities
(The Bulletin quite believes this : Parkes
has lived on the game for 30 years). Then fol-
lowed some piteous gabble about the “inquisi-
torial character of an Income-tax.” In conclu-
sion, the “great Freetrader” turned himself in-
side out by sayi.r nr he “didn t believe in tamper-
ing with the tariff.” It is an awful thing to bo
hungry.

Mr. Reginald J. Black’s latest financial aphor-
ism—that the banker is not the trustee, but the proprie-
tor, of the money in his possession—may be sound on
•‘’Change,” but it should not he forgotten that it was

N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley ;—“lt was some-
times said : ‘ How is it that solicitors get off much more
lightly than other members of the community who are
punished for embezzling money?’ The answer was that
the court had not the power to prosecute solicitors
criminally, and it was not the fault of the court if all it
could do was to remove any solicitor from the roll if it
considered that he was not a fit person to be trusted by
the public.” A very weak argument, this. If Chief
Justice Darley finds a witness committing obvious perjury
he draws the Attorney-General’s attention to the case,
and gets the witness arraigned. Why shouldn’t he draw
the Attorney-General’s attention to the case of a thieving
lawyer ?

The inquiry into the bad smell of the Federal
Bank has been adjourned for three weeks. By that time
the public will have practically forgotten the last batch of
revelations. Then Christmas will come and will necessi-
tate another long adjournment, which will give the public
time to forget all about the next batch. And, thereafter,
the investigation will drag its exhausted length along in
successive adjournments, till the country gets too tired
to want to hear any more about the Federal Bank, or till
the directors die, or the Judge dies, or something happens
to effectually distract attention. So far, every attempt
to find out anything definite about any of the Melb.
financial scandals has died of excessive slowness. Justice
travels by gravel-train with many stoppages.

The lawyers have gathered round the Federal
Bank in liquidation, so far as S.A. is concerned. A cor-
respondent to S.A. Register, who secured access to the
Supreme Court files, avers that a legal firm (one of whose
members is related to a fallen contractor of Federal Bank
fame) received, after taxation, £7007 odd. for one year’s
work as solicitors to the S.A. liquidator up to February
last. It may, therefore, be assumed that up to date this
legal firm has received, say, £lO,OOO, not reckoning large
amounts as costs out of estates wound up for the bank.

Among other features of the Vic. Companies
Bill, now before Parliament, are clauses providing for a
more strict system of audit, and prohibiting directors
lending money on the company’s own shares, making
advances to themselves without announcing the fact to
the shareholders, or paying divs. except out of profits
actually realised. Further, the Bill declares that when
directive make certain statements in a prospectus or
othe»4Scument,they shall be personallyresponsible for the
truthfulness thereof. All which provisions are mild and
reasonable enough in all conscience—the last especially.
The director is the servant of the shareholders, paid by
them to look after their interests, and to know all about
the business of the company, and to hold him responsible
for the accuracy of his own signed statements is a very
modest proceeding.
Yet Harper, the typical Fatman of Vic. Legis-
lature, opposes the measure violently on the ground that
it “will prevent men of standing, men of the right
stamp, from becoming directors at all.” Considering
that almost every utterly heartless and soulless swindle
in fraudulent Melbourne hag, for years past, been done
by “ men of standing ’’—many of them of high standing
—a great many people will be rather glad than otherwise
if they are driven out of the business. The wildly comic
feature in the business is Harper’s tacit acknowledgment
that a “man of standing”—which seems to be synony-
mous with a “man of the right stamp”—is another name
for a person whose statements to a body of shareholders
are so wide of the truth that he can’t afford to be legally
responsible for them, and who won’t take the billet ot
director unless he is allowed to borrow the shareholders’
money without the fact being made known to the lawful
owners of the said money. Experience has, of course,
shown that “ the man of standing” is usually just that
sort of person, but Harper’s reckless admission of the
fact is an unmitigated staggerer, none the less.

Why does not the Law Institute extend its pro-

fleeced by unprincipled **Gent One’s?” There is an Aus-
tralian attorney who is said to have taken jewellery from
a female prisoner in lieu of fees and not put in an appear-
ance, and another who obtained the title-deeds of some
property from an accused woman as security for costs
and yet never entered an appearance, and these instances
oould be easily multiplied. Attorneys at the police court
have been known to take fees from both parties and appear
tor neither, and when Gent One sees trouble looming he
employs a couple of bottle-nosed sharks at a few shillings
each to appear and plead illness for him and pocket the
profit.

Brisbane Municipal Council is issuing .£150,000

payable half-yearly, and debentures redeemable in 1919 —
and investors wishing to put their money into this first-
slass security should make application to the nearest
branch of the Union Bank. The Brisbane Council has
done wisely in trying the local market instead of going to
London. Recent experiences have shown that the London
market presents no advantages which can’t be found in
Sydney or Melbourne—except it be when a gorgeous pro-
moter wants to float some arid chunk of rock in
Westralia as a gold-mine.

A well-known member of a recent Eastern
Parliament, notorious for the persistency with which he

tsked the other day—in view of his large experience—
what it should cost to have a certain little Bill made law.
’‘Well,” said he, “the necessary expense will be about
£5OO, whether you succeed or not; but if you are success-
ful, it will cost you just about four times that amount.”
Herein lies a tale.

Since the Redfern accident the sale of railway
.nsuranoe tickets in Sydney has been phenomenal. And
yet, although N.S.W. Railway Dept, sells these tickets,
It does not guarantee them in any way ; so that should
the holder of such a ticket, bought at a railway booking-
office, be injured or killed, the purchaser or his represen-
tatives would have no claim against the Railway Dept, in
the event of default of the insurance-office. Were there a
Govt. Insurance Department the State would both give
the guarantee and take the profit.

As some of those killed in the Redfern railway
accident were heavily insured (the death of the late Mr.
E. L. Jones, for instance, will cost the insurance offices
£40,000) the State will, to that extent, save damages,
inasmuch as the law is clear on the point that substantial
compensation is only recoverable where actual pecuniary
loss has been sustained by dependent survivors through
the death of an assured person.

Cabled (privately) that the London directors of
one of the biggest Australian limited liability trading con-
cerns decided last week to give six months’ notice of dis-
missal to the whole of their employes in Australia, and to
replace them by men from ’Ome.
Sub-saetion IV. of section 64 of Vic. Insolvency
Act runs: “ If the estate of a trustee be sequestrated he
shall cease to be trustee, and the chief clerk shall, if
there be no other trustee, call a meeting of creditors for
the election of another trustee in his place.” Now this
is thoroughly ignored, and people who filed their
schedules, to escape the consequences of their misconduct
in certain estates, retain their trusteeship in others.
There are many notorious and disgraceful instances of
this.

A mercantile broker had two financially-
“ rocky ” importers in his clientele, and cleverly prolonged
their existence, doubled his commission, and finally
increased the bank’s loss. Merchant A would give broker
a line to place at a certain price ; he would find a buyer
and report the matter to merchant B, who would, through
him, submit an offer for the same goods at the same price
or a shade less. The broker would get this accepted,
and the matter would pan out: A would have B’s bill at
four months for the amount; B would have the outsider’s
bill at the same term; and the clever one would earn
double com., and keep the leaky vessels longer afloat to
his own pecuniary advantage.

F. ; “No one ever sees a sovereign in Australia
that isn’t brand-new.” 1 wish this were literal fact,
because there is going to be trouble some day in rehabili-
tating the gold currencies of these provinces. In Sydney
and Melbourne, in 1890, sovereigns and half-sovereigns of
George 111., George IV., and William IV. were withdrawn
to the value of £46,000. These would cover a period of
20 years. It is certain that the coinage of the next 20
years would be more heavily represented in Australia,
and ’57-’76 coinages still more heavily. As the “ life ” of
a sovereign is only 19 years, the presumption is that all
sovereigns dated before 1876 are now under legal circu-
lating weight. A low estimate of the suspicious gold
coin in Australia would be £250,000. Of course, the de-
basement is small. The old George and William sovereigns
only averaged fivepence to the bad, and this was partly
due to the minting deficiencies of those days. The banks
are very particular about getting new coins into their
reserves. The Commercial Bank had its gold stock
entirely renovated just before the crash, and since that it
has had to work at the renovation all over again. [To
which The Bulletin replies that it spoke of wow—not of
1890 —and that no amount of correspondence alters the
fact that you can change notes into gold all day long in
Sydney or Melbourne, and not get one sovereign that isn’t
brand-new.]

The last designs of British silver coin are not
known in Melbourne. The new silver coins bear the same
effigy on the obverse as the sovereigns now issuing—the
design of T. Brock, R.A. The reverse designs vary with
the denomination of the coin, hut the shilling, florin and
half-crown have a pattern containing three shields. One
of the new florins was offered to the cerberus at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground and indignantly refused as
counterfeit. The owner of the coin, not being a press-
man, had more coins in his pocket, and it didn’t matter.
Yet it is rather ridiculous to have officials at the turnstiles
who do not know the legal tender of the country.
Legally speaking, the M.C.C. could be mulct for refusiug
such a coin.

Broken Hill Block 14 reports that the new plant
has earned £3OOO profit since July, and when the second
part of the mill at the mine is finished the directors hope
to fairly turn the corner of success. Last half year
£lB,OOO was spent on plant—now valued in all at £23,000 —
the Adelaide smelter accounting for £15,000 and the ore-
dresser at the mine for £BOOO. Liquid assets exceed
liabilities by £5225.
Block 14, if the calculations are to be credited,
has gone far towards solving its own particular sulphide
problem. But, unfortunately, the reserves of ore in the
mine are very limited. Therein lies the next “ problem.”
The heavy fall in Broken Hill Proprietaries,
due to fear of an impending reduction of div., which in
turn arises from belief in an approaching shortage of
carbonates, recalls The Bulletin’s prediction, of over a
year ago, that two years would see the practical exhaus-
tion of the then known carbonate bodies. That estimate
was probably accurate enough. The yield from the
open cuts and the discovery of minor new bodies has
added appreciably to the prospective life of the mine, but
the inevitable now looms near.
The big concentrating plant lately completed at
the mine is said to be doing good work. Half the plant
at present running is treating 1200 tons of low-grade car-
bonates per week ; the remainder, not yet at work, will
treat sulphide, and it is expected will put through 1400
tons weekly.

A piteous letter, which, if bona fide, should go
straight to the heart of Minister Sydney Smith: “Dear
Bulletin,—! began mining in ’53. 1 have been mining
ever since. Not long ago, after spending three years on
a stringer, I left it with only a few shillings. Since then
I have travelled 700 or 800 miles on foot, and am stranded
now on Peak Hill, very much dilapidated. Wages I can’t
get, because I am too grey, and a stranger here. On this
place there is no fossicking, and how to go to the next
goldfield I don’t know. In Sydney, all sorts of poor men
can get a free-pass, tools, rations, and a miner’s right, for
nothing, from Govt. 1 have never cost the country a
shilling, and have done my full share in producing
gold as far as working for it goes. I have no
‘ miner’s right.’ Should I go to work without one I
am liable to a fine of £lO, or if I strike gold the man
that received his miner’s right for nothing can jump my
claim and has a right to get it. There are hundreds of
old diggers situated like myself. Why can’t we on the
diggings get a free pass to go to a given goldfield, and a
miner’s right for nothing? The present Premier seems
kindly disposed to the worker. Should this, perchance,

for it but to seize the animal by the horns and force it
back foot by foot. The cow, fortunately, seemed to com-
prehend the position, and, after a very weary time, both
biped and quadruped were clear of the drive.”

Zeb Lane, who was sent to London by a Melb,

not an absolutely howling success in England, where
people didn’t accept him as a little tin god. He managed
to get one of his properties underwritten, but when it
was placed on the market the shares were not over-applied

paid Zeb’s expenses during his nine months’ trip, and say
there was no meeting called to authorise him to go on
behalf of the syndicate, the authority coming from the
directors alone. Considering all things, the balance of
holders fail to see why they should stand Sam for his Lon-

“You can’t imagine the tragedy of life around
Coolgardie,” said a well-known American mining man in
Sydney the other day. “ Out there I met two men, both

were 25 miles from water, and every third day one of the
poor fellow's used to set out to walk that 25 miles and

A Cue correspondent: “We are getting used

gold-yields. People declare that those in Perth interested
in Coolgardie are largely responsible for the misrepresen-
tation, and certainly it looks like it. We can, however,
afford to take things philosophically, as this field does not
require booming, and Coolgardie can never rival the
Murchison as a reeflng-field. Here we have put through
thousands of tons for an average of over 20z., besides the
thousands of oz. dollied. There they have some rich

One of the most comfortably-situated minjng-
men in Australia is Duncan, sole-proprietor of “ Duncan’s
Lone Hand ” mine, Wandiligong, Vic. For the last four
or five years his profits have averaged over £lOOO monthly,
and in October he smelted over 700 oz. The expenses of
working are microscopic; the trucks run from the
mine to the battery, which is mainly worked by water
from the hill springs. The modest Duncan lives with his
. family in a pretty cottage on the hill-slope close by.
For over 20 years previous to his striking it rich at Wandi-
ligong, the now opulent mineowner prospected on every
goldfield in Australia with very poor luck, and when he
look out the Lone Hand lease he hadn’t enough money of
his own- to cover the small expenses. He has refused

doing a greater work in the history of Wales
than it is doing to-day”(!); the Corporation
of the city of London is so firm that it prac-
tically defies abolition (late cables tell a very differ-
ent tale); the London “ feeling is growing in
favor of a multiplication of municipalities rather
than of concentration or unification ” (!); the
London guilds are deserving of idolatrous adula-
tion ; and the House of Lords is rooted in the
heart-affections of the British people. Yet Wil-
liam Farmer is classed as a sane and almost in-

The aged ex-Judge Manning has been
absent from his place in N.S.W. Legislative Coun-
cil recently, where his services would no doubt
have materially aided the Coal Mines Regulation
Bill. To be a fairly good Democrat at 84, after
years of high official life, is not a usual occurrence,
and The Bulletin, remembering his speeches t n
the Mining on Private Property Bill, hopes soon
to hear that the ex-Judge has gained strength.
Legal Democrats are scarce, especially in the
Legislative Councils.
Journalist: “ Apropos Dean Macartney
and the Fitzroy Garden statues, I remember
having to ‘ interview ’ Baron Von Mueller, at
Melb. Botanic Gardens, The best part I couldn’t

leaf tea, to the accompaniment of smoking a blue-
gum-leaf cigar. Confidentially he said, “I haf
no statoots in de gardenz. You know, I don’t
dink doze in de Vidzroy Gardenz are brobber.
Ye are men of de vorld, but look at de nurz girls,

Madame Charbonnet-Kellermann, recently
created by the French Government Offioier
de I’Academie, and who was honored at a f6te at
the Hotel Australia, Sydney, the other evening,
claims to be “ the first Australian woman having
received this high distinction.” Who but a
Frenchwoman could have expressed the flattery
in this fashion : “I hope you will pardon me for
calling myself an Australian. I arrived amongst
you from Paris 16 years ago, then a mere girl, and
ever since I have devoted most of my time to the
teaching of the gifted children of Australia. I
have founded an Australian Conservatoire . . .
and, if a French artist, I am a Sydney resident
teacher. Besides this, there is a nearer and
dearer title which I have acquired by my marriage
with one of you—that of Australian mo her. Let
me thank you, therefore, for your ahnahiNM to
the French artist and for the honor you do to the
Australian lady.”


THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA.
A chapter has been left out in this valuable book,
which is full of good advice and precious hints.
In these times of depression the Government has
Riven the example of economy, retrenchment in
every direction, salaries cut down, hands reduced,
a nd so on. In private life, people have followed
suit, and as smoking fine cigars is a costly luxury,
little advice on the choice of a weed would have
been welcome. Let us impress upon you that if
you smoke Frossard’s Cavour Cigars you will make
no mistake, but save money, as they are sold
everywhere in packets of eight for one shilling.
POLITICAL
POINTS
On June 30 last the S.A. public debt for
railways was .£11,514,079 —about half the bonded
debt of the province.
M ‘ll wraith still draws his salary as a Q.

Certain M.’sP. of the N.S.W. Solidarity
party are getting a strong attachment to Liqui-
darity. Well, it’s thirsty work talking !
Victoria has 2215 pensioners, receiving
annually £255,487, of which £15,584 goes to
England for distribution amongst absentees.
One thing can be said anyhow for the
present N.S.W. Premier Reid. There may be
flies on him, but so far there are no blow-flies.
Some reformer wants to cut down Vic.
Parliamentary wages to £3. That is all they are
now. It costs half the three years’ stipend to get
in.
Judging trom the condition of the pants
of several of the candidates who are out for the
Tweed, N.S.W., they want the seat very badly
indeed.
How timely come the sudden serious in-
dispositions of prominent Australian politicians !
Influenza, and other fashionable plagues, seem to
fln party actors.
Adrian Knox availed himself of O’Sul-
livan’s N.S. W. Libel Bill to fire off the impudent
lawyer sentiment that in all actions security for
law-costs gbyuld b§ given.
“ I know from some of the wealthiest and
most influential firms iq Sydney that there is no
name so hateful to them as that of the Reid
Ministry.”— Henry Parkes.
While N.S.W. ex-Minister Lyne is ex-
plaining, he had better tell all he knows about the
sums paid for compensation in connection with the
Culcairn-Corowa railway and the costs therein.
An anomaly of N.S.W. Elections and quali-
fications Committee law is that that body may
unseat a member at the instigation of a defeated
candidate and give the seat -to such candidate,
and is not at liberty to accept from the unseated
member charges against the newly seated one,
although the charges are similar to those in the
first case considered.
A plebiscite of
S.A. Labor-party
has resulted in a
majority of 300
voting that no one
shall be recognised
asaParliamentary
Labor candidate
who is not “eligi-
ble to be a mem-
ber of a trade or
labor society.
The opinions of
the Sydney rou-
tine press on this
are d iverting.
Thi D.T. calls it
“flaunting asin-
inity,” and a
“mean, narrow,
class bias.” The
E. News declares
that t he resolution
has “ more solid
sense” in it than
many motions pre-
viously adopted
“in the supposed
interestsof labor.”
The D.T. holds
th it it will exclude
the best brand of
law - makers ; the
News, that it will
merely abolish
masquerading
loafe s who dis-
guise themselves
as representatives
of labor. The pro-
bability is that it
won’t make any
difference at all in
the incidence of
candidature, for
the position of
that man is unique
who cannot prove
himself to be
“eligible to be a
member ” of some
“trade or labor
society.” The
certainty is that,
even did it ma-
terially alter the
incidence of can-
didature, it would
make no differ-
ence at all in
legislative results,
so long as the pro-
vinces groan under the curse of Government by
Contradiction,
Said a N.S.W. M.P. the other night :
Mr. Speaker, what they ought to dew, and
what they dew dew, is tew different things, Mr.
Speaker.” Now, who can guess that orator’s
name ?
Official authority states that Queen Vic-
toria, when the Costa Rica packet petition was
put before her, was pleased to receive it “ very
graciously.” Significant are the nuances of diplo-
matic correspondence.
The South Australian Co.—the wealthiest
absentee of the province—is selling its land on
easy terms. Five per cent, cash, 5 per cent, for
each of the next 10 years, and then the balance,
are the conditions of sale.
Wirrah station, in the unpronounceable
back country, has shorn with Chinamen. The
manager’s report runs: “ I have found them
obedient, patient and easily ruled; and they
worked till 6p.m. on Saturdays.”
The opposition vote to O’Sullivan’s Libel
Law Amendment Bill, in N.S.W. Assembly,
brought together in the same voting two such ir-
reconcilables and incompatibles as Henry Parkes
and Schey. Each lives in a glass house.
“ When a Government resumes land it
gets the worst of the transaction,” remarks
an ex • Minister. Let The Bulletin revise
the aphorism : “When the Government resumes
'and the State gets the worst of the transaction.”
The Queensland Labor-members who re-
present gold-fields voted with Fatman when the
proposal that the State should share in the mineral
wealth came on. “Socialism in our time” is all
very well, but a politician isn’t going to risk his
seat over it.
Kerr, M.L.A. for the Barcoo, stated the
other day in Queensland Assembly that he had to
pay a working-blacksmith £3 ss. a week to take
Ids place while Parliament sat. Kerr’s salary as
legislator is exactly £2 17s. Bd. per week. Profit-
able game, politics !
On dit that those truly vigorous and rous-
ing dispatches to the British Government on the
Costa Rica packet racket were drafted by a certain
N.S.W. political medico with military tendencies
and signed by a large politician on the “them’s
my sentiments ” principle.
There are 89 pensioners on N.S.W.
Superannuation Fund who are under 60 years,
the age which the Fund had in view as the mini-
mum. One oldster is under 35. He retired
because he was incapacitated, and is now doing
quite a lively financial business.
The N.S.W. Civil Service Commission
will, and must, be a mere farce. It has to examine
all the Government departments and report on
them “within three months.” To get even an
indifferent grip of the Government departments
and their personnel would take three years.
Sydney Truth warmly denounces the
“ few unprincipled persons ” who talk about the
Woolloomooloo resumption pleasantries and the
anti-ant joke in press and Parliament. Truth
thinks the correspondence between Stephen Sul-
livan and Co. and “Dear Mr. Lyne” is only
another illustration of the eternal struggle between
“ Merit and Corruption,” with Lyne, Taylor,
Willis and Sullivan on the side of Merit, and the
rest of the world, as usual, howling for Corruption.
Truth used to live at the bottom of a well. Now
Truth apparently lives at the bottom of a smell.

ZEVENBOOM: “ Ach! he vas a fine poy. You must make a musician
of heem.”
MRS. SQUATTER: “ Why? He has no musical talent .”
ZEVENBOOM: "But he haf de hair—de pyootiful hair!"
N.S.W. ex-Works-Minister Lyne should
accept the challenge to vindicate his settlement of
the Woolloomooloo Bay frontage land-resump-
tions before a commission of inquiry if he can get
the said commission. Otherwise, the story will
follow him all his life and be written on hia tomb-
stone.
When the subject with which he is tem-
porarily identified is part of the regulation Tory
programme, Sydney D.T. reverentially refers to
“the father of Victorian Freetrade ” as “Mr.
Murray Smith ” ; when the subject is “ off ” the
enthusing line, it cloaks his identity as “Mr.
R. M. Smith.”
Australasia and Land tax ; Tasmania, S.A.,
and Maoriland have written it in their statutes,
and Victoria and N.S. Wales are fondling the
measure. Queensland has already adopted the
principle in her Divisional Boards Act, and is
quite ready for onward movement as soon as she
developes a constructive politician.
Medway Day, and other staunch Free-
traders, in the manifesto of “ the Australian

country in the roughest possible state.
It would have been disgraceful had Dan.

beaten by Black in a real fair-and-square

able case for the abolition of the N.S.W.
Elections and Qualifications Committee as at pre-
sent constituted.

The 8.1.5. N. Co.’s subsidy from the Q.

Westralian Parliament is waking up to
find itself only a cipher with a Govt, figurehead
before it. It turns out that Forrest and Co. have
decided on their own account how the £70,000 of
loan-money available for this year is to be ex-
pended ; and Parliament will simply be asked to
give an ex post facto ratification when the cash is
all gone. In other words, the Forrest dynasty in
Westralia is an absolute monarchy, and parlia-
mentary institutions are merely a matter of bad
form.
London MornlN> Post (a virulent Tory
organ) on Q. Coercion Act: —
It will be recollected that the people of Queensland re-
jected the Governorship of Sir H. Blake because of his con-
neotion with what is called “ coercion ” in Ireland. It is
not a little curious that they should now exemplify in
their own case the necessity for an occasional recourse to

A coalition Government always means that
two rival politicians have united their offensive-
ness in order to serve two different ends of poli-
tical ambition. This is generally called “saving
the country.” In order to £ ‘save the country ” a
coalition must scatter broadcast two opposing
series of bribes, and volunteer to grind the axe of
every political soldier of fortune. The presence
in onv Parliament of a solid and indenendent
in any Parliament ot a solid ana independent
Labor-party should prevent any coalition from
“saving the country.”
Hugh Macdonald, M.P. for Coonamble
(N.S.W.), struck a manly middle note in the
Budget debate. “I neither believe in the Free-
trade party nor the Protectionist party,” said he, in
effect; “ each has its own axe to grind, but the
Freetrade Government now promises taxation
reforms of which the Labor-party approves.”
That is the ticket. The Labor-party should be
the Ishmael of present party politics, volunteering
a temporary sword only in return for demo-
cratic reforms paid down on the nail.
Rumored that “ Dismal Jimmy ” Garvan
is in the field for the Tweed (N.S.W.) with a
“saored and solemn duty ” to perform— i.e., to get
himself elected. Kelly, who ought to have got
latter of whom is going as the nominee of the
Solidarity Labor-party. The latter would have
had a good show if the navvies, who were respon-
sible for Willard’s return, had not finished their
work and gone over the Q. border to their homes.
Dear Bulletin, —You ask “is O’Rell right
in his charge of drunkenness when the liquor con-
sumption of France is to ours as 3.5 to 1.2?” But
what about distribution? The bushman crowds
the bulk of his liquor into a few clays in the year,
which, of course, means intoxication ; the French-
man, encompassed by the highest happiness any
people has yet attained, would be a fool to seek
oblivion, and stops at that modicum of drink
which means super-perception. Ihe man who
takes a gallon of beer in one day is more of a
drunkard than he who takes a pint a day, divided
between his two meals, for a year.—J.O. [True.
Ed. B.]

Joseph Cook,
N.S. Wales Post-
master-General,
says : “It is not
luck that gets a
man into an exalted
position, but sheer
pluck and ability.”
Mr. Gook evidently
means this for an
essay on his own
political career. Yet
he got bis exalted
billet because
M‘Millan, Btuoe
Smith, Wise
and Want had
either abandoned
politics or would
not serve under
Reid; and Reid
acquired the power
of appointing Cook
because M‘Millan,
Bruce Smith, and
others, declined the
leadership, and be-
cause Parkes’s liver
was unusually bad.
Cook has risen sud-
denly to be the ex-
treme tail-end of a
feeble Cabinet, and
his inflation makes
him look so ridicu-
lous that he is never
likely to be the tail
of another Cabinet.
A Maorilander is to rhe front with a
theory that the whole principle on which liquor-
licensing is now based is erroneous. It is not, he
says, the vendor who should be licensed, but the
consumer. Every drinker should go once a year
before a Govt, medical authority and, after exam-
ination of health, should be granted a license
entitling him to imbibe two, three four or five
J'nces per diem The license is to be ruled with
a column for every day in the year, and the vendor

only of these taxes but opposed to the other. The
wish is father to the thought, and the argument
is mother to the command to the Council to pitch
aside the financial proposals. The chief objection
to the inclusion in one Bill of two separate schemes
of direct taxation is that it gives the S.M.H. and
Murray Smith (Vic. M.P.) and other Tory op-
ponents a plausible chance to talk thus.
One of N.S.W. Premier Reid’s most
bitter grievances against the late Dibbs Govern*
ment was that it cut down the expenditure on
roads and bridges below £600,000, “every penny
of which amount was wanted.” Then Reid laid
his own estimates on the table, and according to
them the expenditure on roads and bridges is
reduced to £500,000 per annum. He also an-
nouneed that it was a sinful and immoral thing to
]ace afc the Treasurer’s disposal £200,000 for
unforeseen expenditure during the ye’ar, and
announced his fixed resolve to get through on
50 000- Then he “ blewed ” £37,000 upon
unforeseen expenditure in a single month, or at
the rate of £444,000 per annum.

Tne recent death, “from a broken heart,”
of an Australian ex-police official, may have been
attributable—as most people suppose—to a love-

to), which he had not dared to show or realise on
since he got it, seven years ago, was paste, and
very poor paste at that.

Could shine as an actress was not to
be expected. WhenLeumaneventured
to .Westralia with an opera co., Miss
Elster went as the bright particular
star of that ill-fated expedition, and
her achievements in heavy operatic
r6les thrilled the soul of Perth
as it never was thrilled before
or since. The excellence of her
Marguerite, as far as the garden-
scene in “Faust” goes, had been
proved before then in a scratch per-
formance for Snazelle’s benefit. A
receftt engagement of Miss Marie
Elster,’ to sing in operetta and musical
comedy at Melb. Bijou, is bringing
her into notice once again, but many
people have yet to learn that this
charming soprano vocalist has the
musical training and physique in-
dispensable to a prima donna in
grand opera. The music of Lucia,
Lucretia Borgia, Marguerite, and
other heroines, is at Miss Elster’s
command. She is, in fact, a qualified
prima donna, wisely acquiring stage
experience at the present moment in
“Skipped by the Light of the
Moon.”

rich enough to erect such a memorial to him, but

The Melbourne Madame whose success as
fortune-teller “ necessitates appointments at
>£l Is. a time being made a month in advance”
spends a big sum annually amongst the local
enquiry-offices. Full name and address must be
given her (also the guinea) at the time the appoint-
ment is made. All the enquiry men are
“on” the names of dupes next day. No
wonder that people are flabbergasted at
what she knows about their past, and, of
course, they have to wait some time before they
can corroborate her predictions for the future.
Hence her success. However, she was badly hit,
the other day, by a clergyman whose name was
identical with a bookie living in the same street,
and whose appointment was for the same morn-
ing. The gospel shark, not wishing to be noticed
entering her house, wore, for the nonce, lay attire.
Madame thought he was the bookie and filled him
up with such a ghastly catalogue of his early
spieling days, his four mistresses, his bigamy,
fraudulent insolvency,-and 18 months’ residence in
Pentridga, that he fled the house too| overcome to
utter a word. The best of it is he can’t expose
her! What would his congregation think of a
pastor who believed in fortune-tellers? History
doesn’t say what sort of a yarn the bookie got as
to his blameless life, piety, temperance, chastity,
&c. No doubt she prophesied he would die a
Bishop.

Mrs. Besanfc derives ghastly consolation
from the case of Professor Crookes, who solemnly
affirms that he witnessed a materialisation.
“And so,” says Mrs. 8., “sceptics are reduced
to the necessity of believing that the eminent pro-
fessor failed to observe correctly what transpired
beneath his own eyes, unless they think he gave
himself up to a disgraceful fraud.” Of these two
alternatives sceptics choose the former. They
believe that professors in general are elderly sages
whose powers of vision have deteriorated through
much study. If a sceptic had to practise the
three-card or purse trick upon one particular
member of the community, he would select the
most learned man available for the purpose, and
“do ” him uncommonly brown. The horse-
reporter, whom Mrs. Besant despises, is a man of
much more worldly acumen than the average pro-
fessor.

Miss EDITH KILMINSTER (pupil of Henri Kowalski), a rising
Sydney pianiste.
A divorce-case with complications in it
came up the other day before Judge Madden in
Melbourne. Plaintiff deserted her husband many
years ago, taking her infant son along with her.
She re-assumed her maiden name, and the son was
brought up under the impression that his ma was
his sister, and that his grandma was his mother.
The husband, meanwhile, believing his wife dead,
married again and had another son. The badly-
rnixed-up secret was long kept, but at last the
mother, while joyous or hysterical, told the whole
story, and the eldest son found his lost father and
explained things to him. All of which, barring
the fact that the mother took to hysteria, or
whatever it was, is practically Murray's story
of “Joseph’s Coat,” told all over in real life.
Nothing in this world is really original.

The murmur of

evidence of the growing
desire of the governed
to collectively control

evils can of course be
prophesied if the
teachers’ claim suc-

has already succeeded
and is law in several of
the United States, and
no disaster has, so far,
followed. And how
often'have inspectors in
Australia been appoint-
ed on a worse principle?
“ I arrived in Mel-
bourne with .£1500,”
said a school-inspector
who some years ago
distinguished himself
by sensational divorce
proceedings I put up
at Club, spent the
money in drink and
cards, and so made

During the sit-

Military Commission
not long ago, a swash-
buckler, who turned up

a beastly state of liquor,

made a number of state-
ments touching warlike
matters which fairly
staggered the Commis-

when sober, he again
gave evidence, and con-
tradicted every state-
ment he had made, on
oath, the day before !
It is gratifying to notice that the snobbish
custom of distinguishing between the arnateuis
and pros, of the English cricket-team has dis-
appeared, let us hope for ever, from the Austra-
lian press. Last time, when Sheffield’s Eleven
were here, the papers compromised by giving the
amateurs initials, the professionals being dubbed
as “Briggs,” and so on; while on previous
occasions the “Mr.” prefixed all the “gentlemen.”
Frank Grey Smith, M.C.C. president, should have
displayed better taste than he did the other night,
when he gave a dinner to the amateurs alone of
Stoddart’s team.

Typhoid is fairly raging at Coolgardie.
One might imagine that where condensed water
was used typhoid should be well-nigh impos-
sible, but the disease is doubtless generated by
the clouds of foul dust which find their way every-
where, and by the general filth begotten of the
want of a generous water-supply. For instance,
they don’t wash blankets much at Coolgardie.
Smith dies in a hotel blanket this morning, and
Jones sleeps in that blanket to night. Living at
Coolgardie is much easier than it used to be, and

The Adelaide mayoral banquet in honor of
the increased age of the Prince of Wales was
chiefly remarkable for the utter dullness of the
speech of Chief-magistrate Willcox, and for the
three-cornered verbal duel between Opposition-
leader Downer, Premier Kingston and Council-
president Baker. The wine was turned sour by
the acridity of their remarks. Downer began the
polemics, Kingston was only too glad of the chance
to wade in, and Baker, who came last, had a tilt
at both. Whispered that when he gets the
knighthood, for which his soul yearns, Baker will
fling aside the President’s gown and take the floor
again as chief Conservative “ barraoker.” He
keeps the intention as dark as possible, however,
as he does not wish to prejudice his chance of the
bauble.

By a strange coincidence there were adver-

prayer, a little sewing, and then talk on hygiene.”
Too much hilarity! The notions of jollification
entertained by the thin, high-nosed female with

affections of the liver, and buns—and they do not

“Melb. Sun, The Society Courier”
(probably a misprint for Currier) made a new
bid for popularity during Cup week. It turned
out between 40 and 50 pen-and-ink drawings of
the dresses worn by fashionables who graced the
races, and under each dress was the name of the
wearer. In these pictures the dress and the name
were everything, the face nothing. Mrs. Smith
was the exact image of Mrs. Brown, and so on.
But the idea has “caught on.” The Sun has
secured the services of Miss Alice Currie, a lady
who went to London some time ago to study art
in the Slade School. She came back to her friends
in Melbourne not long since with an armful of
charming paintings of street scenes and interiors.
She still keeps them. They were exhibited at the
New Melbourne Art Club ; but no one sent to her
to ask to buy a picture. Now that she has taken to
drawing society dresses, she is besieged by re-
quests from people, who wouldn’t for the world be
thought out of Fashion’s throng, to put theirs in,
too.

Victorian Chief-Justice Madden possibly
rails at cheap divorce not so much because
the cheap-divorce system doesn’t suit the
lawyers, as because His Honor’s early reli-
gious training taught him not to tolerate
divorce at all. In Victoria, at present, by the way,
an undefended divorce-suit cannot be consum-
mated for less than li4o. This in itself suffices to
keep out of Court many deserving cases ; while,
on the other hand, to defend an action costs
at the lowest from .£lOO to £2OO enough
to cause a majority of the cases that do
come into Court to pass undefended. All which
means that if there is not £4O available the un-
fortunate marriage often remains undissolved
until it is burst up by the commission of some
hideous crime. Brother Madden seems much an-
noyed that most of the parties to divorce-suits are
“weU-dressed, ” Yet surely there is nothing won-
derful in that, for people who can afford the
luxury of even an undefended divorce would not
find it hard to indulge in the comfort of good
clothes.

A droving yarn tells how, along with 1000
head of cattle from Carella station (Q.), came
South one solitary wether, which followed the
herd 900 miles, swimming the Thomson, the
Barcoo (twice), the Neave, the Barwon and the
Gwydir (N.S. W.) rivers, all being in flood. It
chummed in specially with some of the older
bullocks, and was a rare pet with the drovers.
Which reminds of the Riverina station yarns
about training wethers to help yard sheep. _ The
flock would be brought to within half-a-inile of
the yards, and then the pet wethers would be
“coop-cooped ” out and given their orders. Their
reward was tobacco —which they used to “ chew
like anything.”

A young woman of the “vagrant” class,
who had formerly been (or said she had been) an

other day. The Herald, reporting the case,
headed it “ Debased by Art.” Which is about as
sensible as it would be to say that a pressman who
got drunk —supposing such a case could possibly
occur—was “debased by literature.” Art is incap-
able of debasing anybody—even the art involved in
sitting as a model in the “ nude.” One recalls the
princess who sat to the sculptor, and who, on
being asked whether it was not very uncomfort-
able, replied, “Oh no, there was a fire in the
room ! ” To the pure, &c.—though it is far more
true that to the impure all things are impure.

herself and other equines owned by him, together
with his household goods, and planked evety

man’s profession, the safest question to ask is
“What church are you pastor of?” If this pans
out unsatisfactorily, it is a certainty he runs a
portable totalisator.

At Adelaide Oval, during the match against
Stoddart’s team, there was seated in the pavilion
a particularly loving couple, whose billing and
cooing delighted the crowd. They were from the
country, and were apparently in the first stage of
an ardent honeymoon. Just when the cricket
lulled and the crowd had nothing to do, the pro-
vincial Adonis would suddenly clasp his little
Venus around the waist, and then they would
gaze rapturously into each other’s eyes, and he
would remark: “ Maria, dear, little Briggs has
bowled another maiden over!” Then followed
another hug, and more rapturous eye-drinking,
and a fresh burst of delight from the onlookers.

Sydney Wool Sales.
M'Burnby, Wallis & Co. report.—At our last sale, held
on the 21st inst., we have to report brisk competition for
all lines of sound, bright, free, greasy merino fleece wool,
though no actual advance on late rates. Crossbred of all
descriptions is still on the decline. Greasy pieces and
bellies are still from IJd. to 2d. per lb. lower than last
season. Heavy, earthy, seedy and burry clips are very
difficult to dispose of at any price. Scoured wool attracts
very little notice, and bidding is consequently very slow
and labored. The wool-growers of New England should
be the most satisfied producers in our colony, for, bad as
prices are, their good clips are suffering least, and, judg-
ing by prices realised at our sale, and the eager bidding
for lines from the north, New England will come out of
this dull season nest of all the districts of our colony. The
clips of the Yass district, some of which are beautifully
got up, are also holding their usual high position, and
we obtained some very satisfactory prices at our
sale for wool from this direction. A few of the prices we
obtained are as follows Rosebank crossbred from Urana,
a wool in very light condition but slightly troubled with
trefoil, we obtained 7id. per lb. ; same brand, merino
light, well grown and nicely got up, 6}d ; triangle/WR,
from Young, light in condition but seedy, 6d.; AD/Mur-
ruinville, from Yass, lieht, bright, and as usual very care-
fully got up, 7Jd. ; EN/Adelong Crossing, a bright, free
wool, 6Jd. ; WD/2, a nicely-got-up line from Yass, 6}d.;
HCS/Pern Glen, a useful, sound wool from Gundagai, at
bid.; F&GM/B/New England, a wool of the pure merino
tvpe, nicely got up, but rather short, at fi$d.; SN/B, from
Borrows, a well-got-up clip, 6}d. ; DN/New England,
lieht, bright, and well-grown, at 6Jd.; Glen/*, from
Wagga, sound and free, at did.

The other day, H. M’Calmont, owner of
the racehorse Isinglass, finally came into posses-

Uncle. London Times, recording the event,

paratively young and a widower.
The reverential sentiment of the profes-
sional saint: W. T. Stead announces that he will
print his books by union labor, “for if Christ
wanted a book printed He wouldn’t go to sweaters.”
It is a terrible thing to found a religion destined
to carry about men like Stead.
Mr. Edward Murnin, who died at Mitta-
gong, N.S.W., the other day, was for 35 years a
prominent Sydney merchant and ship-owner. He
promoted the formation of Sydney Chamber of
Commerce and the A.J.S. Bank, and was a
founder and long a director of the A.M.P. He
had long buried himself in the Blue Mountains,
and died in his 81st year.
The Australasian, which is fast turning
into a comic paper, publishes a cartoon in
which the devil is represented shoving Premier
Turner on to levy a Land-tax. The idea wants
completeness. It should be finished off with a
sketch of Patterson, as the Deity, looking down
regretfully on the spectacle. Patterson is the
Australasian’s god just now.
The Fatman party in Yic. Assembly re-
ceived a nasty pill from Labor-member Cook.
23,123 “ poor farmers ” of South Australia, as
Mr. Cook showed by the statistics, paid only
<£26,950 of land-tax, whereas 675 rich squatters
are touched to the tune of .£183,361. Previous to
this unpleasant revelation the poor farmer had
been Patman’s trump-card in debate.
A. Sydney suburban storekeeper left home
to view the procession on Eight-hour day, leaving
his wife to look after the business. He did not
return that evening, but by next morning’s post
the wife received a note stating that, in conse-
quence of incompatibility of temper, he had
decided to leave her the store, the debts, and the
children, and take himself off to ’Frisco by the
boat sailing on show-day. Which he did.
Mr. G. W. Waddell, the popular chief
Inspector of the A.J.S. Bank, retires shortly.
Mr. Waddell once got much notoriety
through a lapsus Ungucß. While presiding at a
meeting of shareholders in the Milburn Creek Co.
he mentioned that in the prosecution of the co.’s
claim for compensation members of Parliament
were expensive “to interview.” Then followed
the historical Milburn Creek enquiry, the expul-
sion of Ezekiel Baker from N.S.W, Assembly,
and the Milburn Creek trial.
The Chinaman is the only person who
doesn’t seem to feel the pressure of bad times.
He is always cheerful. And he has ideas, too.
Several of him at Macleay, N.S.W., have been
coining money recently by the simple process of
raising tomatoes and cucumbers earlier than any-
body else in the province, and sending down
hundreds of cases, which command unheard-of
prices in the bare Sydney market. Meantime, the
noble white man scratches his head and wonders
how it’s done, and without any Govt, subsidy,
too. Apropos— an English grape-grower, who raises
many tons of splendid grapes every year under
glass, told the writer last year that he’d been to
Australia and found not a grape in the market
for three-parts of the year. “If I were a younger
man,” he said, “I would go out to Sydney and
put up half-an-acre of glass, and I guarantee I’d
make a respectable fortune inside of a few years
by selling first-class grapes to the rich people at
half- a-crown a pound in the off-season.”
The bottle department at Roberts’ Hotel
(George-street, Sydney) is probably the best-fur-
nished retail liquor-store in the province. Every
drink that any sane whiteman is likely to call for
can be found there at prices much lower than the
average, while the quality (unlike the price) is of
the highest. In these days, when the thermome-
ter registers 97* in the shade, it is the natural
ambition of every man to get as much first-class
liquor as he can for as little money as possible, or
even less; and Roberts’ bottle department just
fills the bill.
Carlyle, the eminent Scotch philosopher,
who was as good a judge of a cigar as of a book,
used to say that, amongst habits which grow on
men, none imposes itself more than smoking; but,
strange to say, in order to derive the maximum
enjoyment out of the weed, an occasional change
in the style of your smoke is indispensable. To
continue for any length of time the same brand of
cigar or tobacco causes the smoker to grow so ac-
customed to it that his palate gets indifferent to
its special blend. With a view to meet the general
desire for a mild and aromatic smoke, Messrs. J.
Frossard and Co. have lately brought out their
Cavour Cigars, They are beautifully packed, in
neat cases of eight, to be retailed at Is. This
article fills a long-felt want for a light smoke, pos-
sessing flavor and delicate aroma, and is certainly
the best-value cigar in the market. Once tried,
always liked.

The Argujs never loses an opportunity,
whenever a unionist is in trouble and is the
alleged aggressor, to announce the matter with
prominent headlines. As a counter-move the Age
delights in decorating with big capitals any incid-
ent when the non-unionist is the culprit. A few
days ago one of the latter, when before the beaks
for assaulting a unionist, stated that his em-
ployers had offered to compensate him for doing
so. The Age shrieked with joy over this, but
never a word said the Aegus.
Mr. Colonna Close writes a Sydney paper
giving details of an operation performed by Dr.
Maurice O’Connor on a Darlinghurst Gaol
prisoner who had been suffering from a depressed
fracture of the right parietal bone, received 15
years before the operation. Left hemiplegia had
supervened, with paralysis of the left side of face,
difficulty of articulation, affection of the nasal
nerves, paralysis of the left arm, complete con-
traction of the left knee-joint. The patient in
question, who has perfectly recovered and out of
whose skull a substantial lump was sawn, is iden-
tical with Sweetman, the cabman sentenced to 15
years imprisonment for his alleged part in the
Mt. Rennie affair. Reading over the evidence in
Sweetman’s case, every impartial person will main-
tain that the man’s offence would, as the world
goes, have been adequately met with less than a
year’s gaol. Sweetman should have been released
long ago.
Alderman John Hughes is being opposed
for Fitzroy ward, Sydney, by Mr. Frederick
Penny. Mr. Hughes is a cultivated man of
democratic instincts and a good man of business,
who will one of these days make a Mayor of whose
grammar and manners, at least, Sydney will have
no cause to be ashamed. Mr. Penny is a successful
butcher, utterly incapable of talking in decent
English or any other language for two consecutive
minutes. He has no claim whatever on public
attention, but is being run by a prosperous Wil-
liam-street publican, who by some occult means has
become possessed of so much political and civic
power that he is actually fussed over and consulted
by Prime Ministers and mayors. The citizens,
if they wish to remedy the squalor of Town Hall
matters, should elect as aldermen as many
educated people as they can catch. In the past,
matters connected with the beautification and
sanitation of the city have been left too much in
the hands of whisky-sellers and people intimately
associated with the blood and pig-shrieks of the
abattoirs.
The Q. Railway Commissioners’ squabble
results in Commr. Johnston retiring at once, with
salary for the rest of his term of engagement,
while Mathieson remains to boss the show—Gray
being a cipher. The trouble arose through MTI-
- crediting Johnston with a big saving on
maintenance, which made Mathieson jealous.
Further complications came when Johnston and
Chief Engineer Stanley quarrelled, and Johnston
thinks the MTlwraithian influence was then
used against him —Gray and Stanley being
both connected with Mac. by marriage. In
the Commissioners’ last report Mathieson was at
pains to show that the saving wasn’t anything
like as big as was thought; Johnston wouldn’t
sign the report; and the two haven’t spoken since.
Mathieson is mentally a smaller edition of
Eddy, with all Eddy’s commercial instinct, but
without his breadth of grasp. Johnson is a
clever, self-satisfied “young man in a hurry,”
whose most notable exploit (next to the mainten-
ance saving) was hauling a couple of Northern
engineers over the departmental coals for allowing
a fascinating Victorian lady-artist to ride on an
engine-cowcatcher past the Barron Falls. His
engineering talent is considerable, and he will
probably drop on his feet in England.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
George Giffen is considered by critical English
admirers (and by Geo. Giffen) as the world's best all-round
cricketer. With the ’B6 Australian team to England he
came out with a top batting average of 26 - 5, and a top
bowling average of 17. His record, up to date, for S.A.
against Victoria is a batting average of 63, and a bowling
analysis of 14 - 3 ! No wonder he fancies himself. And in
’93 he scored 180 against Gloucester, and bagged 7 wickets
for 111
* • • *
W. G. Grace, as a batsman, undeniably stands
alone. He heads the list of English batsmen who, from
the ’7B to the ’93 season, inclusive, played in first-class
matches against Australian teams. His grand total is
4081 runs for 122 innings, and his average is 36. Singularly
enough, his average for the whole of his first Australian
tour was 35. Grace’s figures overshadow those of Aus-
tralian batsmen. Murdoch has played in all 251 innings
against English elevens, scoring 6033 runs, and averaging
26. A. Bannerman, with a total of 6091 runs, has scored
more runs off English bowling than any other Australian
batsmen, but he has had 317 innings, and his average is
only 20. H. Moses, lucky and consistent, has put up 984
runs in 34 innings against Eng. teams, and averages 32-2.
But Grace, the nonpareil, when last in Australia, came
out with an average of 44-8, against the pick of Australian
bowling, in eleven-a-side matches.
While Grace is the champion batsman, C. T. B.
Turner is more emphatically the prince of bowlers. In
first-class matches, he has bagged 853 English wickets, for
10,494 runs and an average of 12 2! Spoflorth comes next
with 718 wickets for 9618 runs and an average of 13 2.
Ferris is third on the list of bowlers with a record of 506
wickets, 7300 tuns, and an average of 14. Lohmann comes
a bad fourth. He has taken in Anglo-Austral matches
316 wickets for 4816 runs, and averages 15 - 2. Geo. Giffen
has taken 471 English batsmen for 9088 runs ; average, 19.
The superiority of Australian over English
bowling has always been apparent enough, and Grace is
all the more champion batsman on that account.
* * ♦ *
The first Anglo-Melbourne match resulted in
the defeat of the Victorians by an innings and 96 runs.
The homily of a critic of the time:—“The Victorians
must study the game, learn to break the ball; they want
practice under competent masters. . , The cricketer
must never get drunk before, after, or during a match ;
the Victorians must imitate the steadiness of the English-
men.” In Sydney, too_, cricket and the accursed drink
seem at first to have divided the honors. When the first
Anglo-Sydney match was about to be played the grog-
booths on Sydney Domain were auctioned. No. 1 brought
£62; No. 2, £4B; No. 3, £46 ; No. 4, £43; No. 5, £44;
No. 6, £49 ; No. 7, £64; No. 8, £59 ; and the grand-stand
booth, £Bo—in all, £555 ! When the Association Ground
booths were sold at the last England v. N.B.W. match, the
total realised £lBOl
* * • •
As Moses and A. Bannerman did not play in the
big Sydney match, the spectators missed the treat that
Melbourne had some three years ago, when the patient
pair hit up one run in one hour, and Bannerman scored in
all 19 runs in six hours.
♦ * • *
Three umpires, Briscoe, Tooher, and O. Banner-
man were chosen this season by N.S.W. Cricket Council.
Briscoe, the most popular and most practised of the
three, will have no time for umpiring now, and intends to
resign altogether. As umpire, his one dispute was with
W. G. Grace, when the surly champion batsman grunted
about “my reasons,” “my reasons,,’' and Briscoe re-
torted, “ You have 8000 reasons, Mr. Grace, at £1 per
reason.” Tooher, too, will probably not umpire any
more, so the once dashing batsman, C. Bannerman, is left
alone for the not too pleasant task. Bannerman, being a
professional, is paid £1 per day for his services. For
some time past he has been billiard-marker at the Cricket
Association’s tables.
• • • *
Garrett, of N.S.W., has, in matches against
English teams in Australia, played 49 innings. His
highest score was 26 ; 9 out of his 49 innings totalled 0 ;
and he played 18 innings for over 0 and less than 10 runs
each.
* * • *
Moses will no longer appear in representative
matches. His interprovincial scoring was often consis-
tency itself; in all he played 32 innings for N.S.W. against
Victoria, averaging 42 runs for the first 16 of that total,
and exactly 42 again for the last 16.
• » * *
Grace thinks Spofforth the bowler of bowlers.
But Grace has never forgotten the shock of meeting Spoil,
in the Marylebone match of ’7B, when Spoil.'s first ball
bowled Grace but not the wicket, and the second just shook
oil the bails. Moreover, no cricket enthusiast forgets that
match, and the wonderful victory is nearly always attri-
buted to Spofforth, although Boyle got 9 for 17, while the
Demon took 10 for 20. A hair’s-breadth of difference 1
* • * *
The cricket-match, England v. N.S.W., ended
with a win for the visitors by eight wickets and two runs.
The Englishmen, who, in their first innings, scored 393
against N.S.W.’s 294, went in a second time with only
80 runs to make (N.S.W. only compiled 180), and Ward
(12), Ford (39), M’Laren (12), and Gay (12) knocked up the
required total in a very short time. The defeat was a
hollow one, and the interest fizzled out considerably to-
wards the end. N.S.W.’s score of 180 in the second
innings was a woeful disappointment, the brightest
feature of the business being that there seenis no reason
to believe that refreshments had anything to do with the
result.
* • • *
“Joe ” Darling, who made 117 and 38 (not out)
for S.A. against England, is 24 years old. Reedman, who
made 83 in great style in S.A.’s second innings, is just 27.
* * ♦ »
Iredale, in compiling: his fine score of 133 against
the English, was at the wickets four hours and a quarter.
He found Lockwood’s bowling by far the hardest to play,
the toughest ball of all being the fast one pitched just
outside the line of the off-stump, and curling in upon the
wicket. He liked Lockwood’s slow ball, on which the
bowler places such value, and sent it every time to the
fence. He did not tire from actual batting, but became a
trifle fagged from running on the extremely hard wicket,
which, made of Bulli soil, jars the leg-muscles like
concrete.
• * * *
Donnan, diddled out by Peel and his own
cautiousness, after making third top score for N.S.W.,
should play against the Englishmen with the club freedom
which has given him this season an average of 53. Able
to play as forcing a game as any batsman, Donnan, when
he meets the Englishmen, seems to lose many runs
through over-carefulness.

Dear Bulletin, —My team against Stoddart’s
eleven : —6. Giffen, H. Graham, J. J. Lyons, J. Reedman,

* * • *
J. J. Lyons, the S.A. crack srniter, is quite out
of form just now.
* * • •
Lockwood, the English fast bowler, takes a run
of 16 yards before delivering the ball. Putting all he can
into his medium-paced ball, on a good wicket, he cannot
break back quite four inches.
By the way, Lockwood was very nearly drowned
in Sydney harbor last Sunday; he fairly collapsed in the
water, and would now be as dead as Julius Csesar but for
the pluck and readiness of a couple of local boating-men.
* * * *
Giffen is the admirable Crichton of the budding
young S.A. cricketer; Bruce and M’Donnell are the
models for the Victorians, and patient Bannerman, alas 1
is the father of the N.S.W. careful school. Bannerman’s
greatest feat of 1 run in 1 hour caused a spectator to
exclaim, as the Englishmen crowded round the wicket,
“Look out, Alick, they’ll pick your pocketl ’’
* * * *
Ere going on their Harbor trip, last Sunday,
the English professionals gave their watches and rings
into the care of the Empire barmaid. Wherein they were
wiser than the six members of the '7B Australian Eleven

watches to the custody of a Y.M.C.A young man, did so,
and never saw’ watches nor good young man again.

Re the cheerful little jokes of Johnny Briggs
—there was no “ pantomimic ” about his throwing-out
of H. Trott in the Vic. v. England match. “Let her go!"
shouted Briggs, as he heaved the ball straight at the
stumps. The ball beat Trott by about six inches, and the
dangerous batsman, who was apparently “set” for a long
score, walked back to the pavilion bemoaning a well-
meant attempt to steal a run.

Melb. University 0.0., playing against North

In the sports of our country the Chinese are not
quite “out of it.” Wollongong, N.S.W., possesses one
Charley Ah Way who is an expert swimmer, and would
be nearly a champion but for his ineradicable weakness
in looking back to see if his opponents are catching him.
Mr. Kong Sing, of Sydney, besides having proved him-
self a capable footballer and amateur runner, is perhaps
a still better boxer. A few weeks ago he put on the
mittens, at George Seale’s gym., 'with Mr. Arthur Sul-
livan, one of the smartest amateurs in the country.
Kong Sing proved the owner of a rapid left, and Mr.
Sullivan’s extra vyeisfht and superior foot-work alone kept
the Oriental at bay.

Beckwith, senr., has claimed the invention of
the over-arm side stroke. But it is now being argued
whether the Australian aborigines'did not know it all
along. One “ Cantab ” says he saw it practised by the
blacks in a lagoon at Bondi, and, on his return to Eng-
land, showed it in Beckwith’s swimming-bath long before
it astonished the English world.

Dear Bulletin, —Heaven forbid that cycling
should ever impose its deformities on Australian charac-
teristics. A hunch-back, diseased kidneys, and general
strain are among the least evils. The cyclist is a one-
idea’d man who won’t be satisfied till the earth runs on
ball-bearings. Curse him, dear Bulletin, with your
latest edition.—Respectfully, Y.Z.

The starting-price “jobs,” so often worked in
England, will never assume great proportions here, as
stay-at-home s.p. bookies won’t lay too much money. An
industrious owner might, however, net a thousand or two
by letting his gee start unbacked, or giving him out as
“stiff” on the course, and through agents backing him
at s.p. irhmediately before the race, all over the country.
He would net 10 to 1 in a fair field, if the horse were un-
backed on the course. One cute gentleman who tried it
on last week was up too early, however. At noon he put
£‘so on his pony in town s.p. Did not even go to the
course, but the s.p. merchant did. The latter backed the
pony and skinned tfie market at prices down from 10's to
6t04 on ; indeed, he stood £250 to the backer’s £5O. It
came off. Starting price, 6to 4 on, leaving a net profit to
the s.p. bookie of over £2OO. In future that pony man
will back his on the course only.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width

round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities— a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a

Writes “Victor” :—There is not much to cavil
at re the weights in the big Xmas handicaps, though
Honda (since scratched) was certainly harshly treated by
Mr. Scarr, considering his performances since he. ran
second to Glenloth in Melb. Cup. The Carrington Stakes
invariably provides plenty of ante-post speculation, and
already several candidates have been backed by the
public. Why six-furlong sprints, in which almost every-
thing depends on a good start, should be selected as media
for extensive wagering, is a mystery. Yet ’tis so, and
next to Melb. and Caulfield Cups I verily believe horses
could be backed to win more money in the Newmarket
Handicap and Carrington Stakes than in any other race
in Australia.
By winning this year Moorefield will probably
atone for his last year’s unlucky defeat in same race, and
this horse I look on as the pick of the handicap, for he is
an undoubted flyer, and, moreover, will have the assist-
ance of that clever horseman, James Gough.
The Warwick Farm stable holds a strong hand,
and its representative will run well. Milkmaid is at pre-
sent bruited about as the pea, but if fit and well I would
prefer to stand by All There, who will win a good race for
Mr. Forrester whenever in commission.
Marvel is given a great chance, and will make a
big bid for victory, but for the absolute winner commend
me to Moorefield.
Oxide, Tridentate, The Captain, iEolus, Dona-
tion and Belgiorno have all been leniently treated in the
Summer Cup, and of the crowd The Captain or Triden-
tace should eventually win.
In Tatt.’s Cup, Oxide, Tridentate, Lady
Trenton, Loyalty, Donation and Warminster look most
dangerous ; but definite selection is at present difficult, as
five of the above are engaged in the Summer Cup. How-
ever, should Tridentate escape a penalty, I shall look no
farther for the winner.
When at Randwick last Saturday I was struck
with the improved appearance of M.L.A., who will be
winning ere long; maybe, like his ex-Queensland confrere
Triton, he will keep on winning 1
My old friend-Moorite has been “added to the
list,” and if rendered more tractable by the operation he
will prove his superiority to the other three-year-old form
at the V.R.C. A*utumn meeting. Cobbily Will be all right
by that time, and he has so far recovered from his acci-
dent that he will, in all probability, be given a gallop at
the V.R.C. Xmas meeting.

The Caligraph Writing Machine,
si:
gapf
- m
THE CALIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“ I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that ths platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

F.A.K. : Your “Wairarapa” poem is so un-
speakably awful that the public gets one verse to groan
at:—
Bodies floating, bodies battered.
Bodies with their features shattered.
Bodies with their limbs extended.
With the wreckage strangely blended.

G.L.W.: Hardly up W.B.Q. (Murchison): This paper
gets more contradictory accounts from Cue than from
any other place in Australia. Perhaps you will be
interested to learn that the biggest and most experienced
mining authority who has yet visited the field doesn’t
like it at all. Taking the luck all round, you seem to
have little to complain 0f.... Bluegrass: Reads lonesome,

Reads like a cutting from Sporting Times. Cseaar’s para-

sketches are obviously copies A.0.E.: Statements that
there are “ 10 to 12 millions of Spiritualists in America ”
(what authority?); that Crookes, Wallace, and a score
more well-known men are “ Spiritualists ” (what autho-
rity?); that you have proved the existence of “Spiri-
tualistic” phenomena (what phenomena?), and so on,
prove nothing at all. The Bulletin is quite aware that
in conn ction with hypnotism, telepathy, and hallucina-
tions exist natural forces with whose conditions we are
yet imperfectly acquainted. Does that prove that when
you put a body in a coffin a “ spirit ” will come out to eat
chocolate-creams? What do you mean by “Spiritualism,’’
anyhow ? Send a compact account of what it is, and why
you believe (giving facts, names, references, dates), and
we’ll print. Yourletter merely reiterates old assumptions.
. ...E.C.O. : “ Nobody will venture to say that the Judge’s-
relation business has corrupted the N.S.W. Supreme
Court Justices’’—but it has certainly corrupted the
JS.S.W. attorney's to the extent that Judges’ near relatives
get briefs which, but for the fact that they are Judges’
relatives, would never be theirs—as evidenced by the fact
that they all almost entirely practise in the Courts pre-
sided over by their relatives, and that their practices
usually don’t improve when the relatives leave the Bench.
.... J.J. B. (Strath bogie): It was long held over... A. J.;
The reason why that trustee filed accounts showing a

hell here, and have no proof of any other after death
Bingo: Try again, more than once. Always plunge in
mediae res, as with your election stanzas—
“ The first of all was Lying Jack,
The worst of all that hellish pack.”

Hermes: It is like looking through Tit Bits .. Barro:
The judicial bowels yearn only for the divorce hors 1 ech
and not for the divorce litigants. It is b cause
of the difficulty of procuring divorce that domes-
ticity is devastated with all the scourges that help
to ke-p such exalted moralisers of pappycock s Judge
Madden well-fed and well salaried. That is pos-ibly the
unconscious genesis of his Honor's cosmetiqned and
moustachioed scorn of cheap divorce D.G. (Albany):
Hazell’s Annual classifies English representativ's ciilv,

195: Conservatives, 233; anti-Parnellite, 1. ~ Ex-Ben-
digonian: Looks as if Bendigo had reason for congratu'a-
tion ... Cob: And does the State want to share in new
mineral discoveries? How can it do so before tin y are
proven successful ? If it does, and they are, taxation is
easy—as Queensland div.-tax, which draws upwards of
£30,000 a year out of mines J.W. (Woolloomoolno);
The jockey’s hair turned grey, and he wept when the
subject was mentioned even years afterwards, because he
saw his brother Bill fall off a horse. And yet brother Bill
wasn’t even injured An Imported Idiot: If you will
read “ Plain English ” upon “ Undesirable Immigants ” in
a recent issue, you will see that The Bulletin advocates
just the thing which you curse it for not advocating.
Also it advocated it before you started on the subject
J.M.W. (Horsham): We distinctly refuse to publish 25
verses about any tiger. It is too much Karabos : You
can’t fix up a horrid revenge. You lack the necessary
ingenuity and ghoulfulness Nora G. (Brisbane): Idea
slender, and metre woefully irregular. Moreover, such
things as the “mountain torrent’s fall” spoil a bush
story. You may walk over the Western stations in search
of that mountain torrent till the Day of Judgment and not
find it. Take out the torrent and put in a tank...
C.: Policeman-cow yarn ancient K.W. (Aramac):
“Waiting for the Train” has no special merit, save a
jingle like a locomotive in the distance Gohanna: Will
use ... P. Kevin: This paper’s only objection to you is
that you are a gentle and placid bore Original: Please
don’t send along things that everybody knew months
ago K. (Tumut): A fight between two bankers isn’t
necessarily humorous. Yours is a dreary, raw-meat and
chewed-ear item Philosophic Anarchist: You say we
“ought to be aware that no amount of inspection or tax-
ation or State monopoly can make it easier to get good
liquor.” Which is just as reliable evidence as if we said
that you ought to be aware that no amount of wealth can
make a man any more affluent. And your statement that
if we nationalise the liquor-traffic w’e must nationalise
everything, is just as idiotic as anybody else’s statement
that if you boil eggs you must boil everything- including
your father. Think for yourself, if you can, instead
of sending along undigested, second-hand economics
Harold Watson: The Bulletin knows quite well that
when a bank takes over a badly depreciated security it
has to credit it with the interest or rent obtained until it
haa made up the margin between the advance and the
present value of the asset, thus diminishing apparent
profits. But when a bank’s visible profits drop in 12
months from (say) 10 per cent, to nothing, the only pos-
sible assumption is that in the 10 per cent, days it made
no provision for depreciated securities—in other words,
that its accounts were a glaring frard. Always a Reader:
There isn’t a single cribbage-authority in this office
Paddy Doyle: Metre good. Lie very weak... Credo:
Thanks, hut your glutton has been already heard from..’..
Fannie : How much did you bet with your best young
man that you would take us in with that yarn ? Wheat-
field (Coolamon) : The story rests wholly on the assump-
tion that laborers are habitually fed on buns in the
country. Are they? Journeyman Undertaker: You
seem a cheerful ghoul Dan ton :If the Single-tax be-
comes law “ those old allies against the masses, the
landowners and commercial classes, will become sworn
foes.” No fear. The landowners won’t be taxed by
the commercial classes but by the masses, and they won’t
turn against their feeble friends to league themselves with
their enemies....l.R.D. (Grafton): Too late for Xmas
Bulletin. Will use for some other issue if good enough.
Mugwump: The “conversion" of Princess Alice of
Hesse doesn’t “ strike us ”at all. One creed is about as
good as another.
Quote :
Ninety-nine per cent, of the Methodist ministers in
Ireland are teetotallers, and not a man among them is a
smoker.
The Land Boom in Vancouver has been
drowned. The choicest and most expensive allot-
ments now lie at the bottom of a river, the course
of which was diverted by the recent floods in that
cracked-up territory.
A good while ago N.S.W. Govt, patronised
a big school-map of the province. Included in it
was a small chart of the Continent, wherein was
marked an impossible railway running down the
centre of Cape York Peninsula. The Bulletin
drew attention to this, and in the maps issued
thereafter this railway was carefully erased and
glazed over. A Boston publishing firm has lately
issued a well got-up wall map of Australia, copied
from an uncorrected map, and containing the
railway in all its glory. Presently we shall hear of
the Murkan tourist insisting upon landing at Cape
York and being shown into the railway “ dee-po.”
According to ex-editor Hogue, M.P.
(N.S.W.), during 18 months, one Sydney news-
paper had been exposed to sixteen libel claims,
totalling ,£16,500. Only one claim went into
court, and the paper won the case; the other
cases were “squared” at a cost of £543. Tie
obtaining of a verdict in the solitary case adjudi-
cated cost that paper £322. One notoriously bad
character who threatened the paper, without a
ghost of a show of success, had to be bought off at
a cost of nearly £2OO. Likely enough. Not
one man in forty who issues a libel-writ can pay
the costs if he loses the case; whereas, when a
newspaper loses a case and doesn’t pay up to the
last farthing the proprietor goes to gaol for a year,
and even then is not (nor can he ever be, except
by payment) released from his liability.
A FEW FACTS WORTH NOTING.
During the past five years The City Mutual
Life Assurance Society has made greater pro-
portionate strides than any other Life office
doing business in Australia. It alone has
shewn a continuous increase in the volume of
new business transacted--always the test of
the popularity of an institution. At the
beginning of 1889 its funds bai'ely totalled
£40,000, now the annual income and invested
funds exceed £160,000 stg. This increasing
popularity has been earned solely on its own
claims to public favor—neveron the demerits,
manufactured or otherwise--of any other
institution. Now and again the City Mutual
has had to complain of unfair rivalry and
has lately been reluctantly compelled to
drop a hint that this sort of non;. 3nse had
better stop once and for ever.
But at the same time it invites criticism--
the fullest inquiry and the freest criticism--
of its figures. The Sydney Bulletin--
nothing if not plainspoken--recently com-
mented om the somewhat heavy expense sheet
last year. Every assistance was thereupon
accorded the Bulletin to compare the expenses
of other first-class offices at a similar
age and to note the volume of new business
transacted by the City Mutual as compared
with that of every other Australian Life
Office. The Bulletin, searching for truth
and finding it, puts the case of the City
Mutual fairly before the assuring public in
its issue of the 29th ult.
The Balance Sheets and Actuarial Reports
of this Society--the people's office--are
always open for the perusal and study of
everybody--intending assurer or otherwise--
and it may be of interest to learn in con-
nection therewith that the City Mutual is
the only office in Australia which periodi-
cally submits its figures to the examination
of a professional actuary in no way con-
nected with the Society.

THE BILLY TEA
Has no equal, and never has had at the price.
Ask those who have used it what they think
of it.
The “ Output ” is a ton per day, which is by
far the largest sale of packet tea in Australasia.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
November 27, 1894.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
Saturday was the second day of the cricket-
match—Roast Beef versus Billy Tea—at Sydney
Association Ground, and a tame enough affair it
was—from a sporting point of view. lam no
cricket authority, but it struck me that the Corn-
stalks played-their little game with a great deal
of the spirit Tn which a “bat’s” admiring small
brother scouts his legs off to minister to the glory
of the man at the crease.
The visitors cut a neat figure in every way. At
the wicket, Stoddart stands at the stumps with
quite a Piccadilly manner, and an aroma of heels-
together and tocs-out broods over the whole team.
As for the Cornstalks —they seemed all clothes.
One fielder’s continuations looked like a divided
skirt, whereas the visitors “filled their flannels,”
as was emphatically remarked on the Members’
Stand. But some of the objects who flaunted the
English colors on the lawn were scarcely a credit
to their townies. All the bandy-legged remittance-
men in the province, with paper dickies and
frayed hems, seemed to have found enough money
in their clothes to purchase a blazing party hat-
band and necktie in which to totter up and down
the grass-plot looking superciliously at the dein’d
Australians, don’tcherknow, through raw-edged
eyeglasses. One elderly derelict on our social
shores even displayed a tri-color cotton handker-
chief -.but as he was the most broken-kneed of the
lot his violent patriotism was scarcely a kindness
to the dear mother country.
Admiral and Mrs. Bowden Smith occupied the
V.R. box on the grand stand, and later on Gov.
Duff appeared clasping a grey alpaca brolly lined
with pea-green, and followed by Lady Duff in
poultry-spice brown, and a daughter or so. The
v ice-regal party were flushed with the victory of
Mr. R. W. Duff in the Corinthian Plate at Rand-
wick races, by the way. The indefatigable manner
in which this Japanese-looking youth sports silk
-nd faces the starter will probably lead to his
becoming the only really popular character at
i iovmentouse.
About the Frenchiest thing on view at Moore
Park was a society matron in salmon-pink slip
o ivered with fine white muslin. Bands of inser-
tion emphasised the suggestive hue, and when you
come to think how crudely ignorant men are
where drapery’s concerned, you wonder how any
woman has the audacity to set them speculating
so ! A feature of the lawn was a recent divorcee
who has since married her co-respondent, and
who trotted up and down in subduedly-checked
silk, while Divorce-Judge Windeyer smiled on his
work from the grand-stand. It must be pleasing
to a Judge of fatherly feeling when a fair defen-
dant marries the naughty “ co.” It looks as if he
had not labored in vain in the interests of love’s
young re-hash dream. As I said somewhere else,
there was a tremenjous attendance, and it was
instructive to see how the girls turned the occa-
sion to profit by invading the official stand and
lining up round the gangway to the cricketers’
room. There was heaps of space for chairs on the
members' gravel—but then Woman always hasher
eye on the smoking-compartment, so to speak,
awaiting a golden opportunity.
I thought that quite a fin-de-si&cle line in “ The
Foundling,” at Sydney Lyceum, when Mr. Alder-
son accuses Miss Gladys Leigh of having “be-
trayed him ” (in the melodramatic sense). But if
women go on turning things t’other side out in
their advancement, such accusations will pro-
bably become quite common, and the “ Faust ” of
the future will show a wrinkled, bleary - eyed
Marguerite selling her withered soul to Beelzebub
for the chance to mash some pious and unsuspect-
ing youth. Talking of advanced women—what a
growing horror they seem to have to the ceremony
of marriage! That Melbourne case proved
only the other day that uncertifloated connubiality
has its attractions from a woman’s point of view,
and, if this sort of thing obtains, how on earth is
man to preserve his sorely-tried innocence? He
will love not wisely but too well, and when he
begs his betrayer to make an honest man of him
she will laugh him to scorn. But I wander from
the “Foundling’’—which is what most people do.
Edith Housley, in mauve and green skirts with
a back-kick that was the perfection of delicate
sauciness, was well-placed as the tricky one.
Gladys Leigh, in a sea-gull suit, looked fully
equipped for a Sunday drive to Rock Lily.
Madge Corcoran, in pink with peppermint-striped
sleeves, and the ever-popular Watt-Tanner, who
dresses bombastic matrons to perfection—all did
sartorial justice to the situation —but, dear me,
what guys the men looked ! Clifton Alderson’s
clothing made me remember how an actor once
told me he had his stage-suits tacked together
with raw edges to save exes. ; and no dress-circle
girl will even commence to dream of Mayeur
unless he satisfactorily explains where he got that
hat.
I heard “Predatoros” in Melbourne and was
much taken with its pretty lyrics. It is simply
salted with songs that are the very things a youth
or damsel going to a soiree musicale yearns to
bring along in a coat-pocket. A tenor song,
“Because! love her.” A soprano song, “Oh,
love of mine.” A baritone ballad, “What the
sun is to the rosebud ’’—which even Sid. Deane’s
crude vocalism couldn’t cheat of an encore.
Another baritone wail, “ I do not love thee less.”
All these are fated to be popular, if I am any
judge of the market. They are all effective songs
and most respectfully sentimental. I must
applaud the fact that nobody is hugged close to
anybody’s wildly beating heart anywhere in
“Predatoros,”
It was at an eleventh-hour rehearsal of “ Preda-
toros,” by the way, that a certain Governor’s wife
(head of a vice-regal entourage which is becoming
quite famous for putting its foot in it with clock-
work regularity) goaded even a loyal manager to
rise in mutiny against the cold-drawn incivility of
the_ Truly Great. “Don’t these actors assume
ridiculous airs?” said she out loud to some Jook or
other who sat by her side in the front row of
stalls. And then Brutus Snap, who was walking
up and down before the orchestra, paused in his
stride. _ “Pardon me, madame,”he said, “not so
many airs as you put on at Government House.”
It is now intensely probable that the rebuked
V.R. lady aforesaid will keep away even more
studiously than usual from that particular man-
ager’s little show.
But the snub was balm to the feelings of the
mummers. Even Guvmentouse isn’t welcome at
a rehearsal, and actors feel as raw at being com-
pelled to exhibit the works, so to speak, before an
idle crowd of V.R. curiosity-seekers, as the V.R.
folks themselves would feel if Brutus Snap and
Co. dropped in on an invitation-card to watch His
Ex. fagging up his private secretary’s eloquence
on the opening of the Way Back Agricultural
Show with wet cloths round his skull. If Guv-
mentouse insists on seeing the wheels go round, it
ought at least to behave itself during the in-
trusion.
By the foregoing spurt of honest opinion I
don’t mean, mind you, that Governors are not
perennially welcome behind the scenes. Sir Pre-
datoros Robinson took a lengthy dive behind on
the second night of the “ Tableaux Pictures ” (as
I heard somebody call them), and rose to the sur-
face with a firm and expressed belief in the
“respectability and modesty” of the poseuses.
What kind of tests the vice-regal musician
brought to bear on the case to make him come to
that opinion did not transpire, but I sincerely
hope the statement of His Excellency’s golden
opinions will not prejudice the circulation of the
rose-pink and chalky charmers in wicked Aus-
tralia.
At a recent vice-regal gravel-party, whenever
the guests got into a mob on the pathway, one of
the aides elbowed his way through the festive
throng and bade them “ move on ” —just as if they
were so many grown-up editions of Jo ! Now, the
policeman is still too recent an Australian auto-
crat for our best people to be told to “ move on ”
without scenting an insult,in the air, and conse-
quently some indignant guests not only moved on,
but moved off.
The least popular Governor in Australia makes
himself in no wise more sought-after by his
sldvoos, which are haunted by a palpable air of
officialdom. Nobody thinks for a moment that a
Governor is always delighted with his company,
but there is always a great difference between
feeling and looking bored to death.
Times change, with a vengeance! The high-
toned Melbourne Argus, that once sneered at The
Bulletin as a “ society paper ” —which it never
was, thank Heaven ! —now openly advertises its
own puce-colored weekly as “The Best Society
Paper in Australia.” Which it probably is, the
meaning of “ society paper ” being a print with
long dead columns, wherein every woman appears
as a Venus i xed up by Worth, and every little
row of tin-pot Chinese lanterns figures as a vision
of Oriental splendor. “The best society paper in
Australia,” by the way, not long ago trotted out
its most genteelly ecstatic Government-House
style over the wedding of the heir to an old do’
shop. Imagine the squatters’ organ, the con
servative Australasian, immortalising a bride-
groom who was probably attired in a suit of papa’s
“ reach-me-downs ! ”
People—l mean, more particularly, tall well-
dressed men, with cast-iron cheek, and white
hands made hideous with big diamond rings—who
are looking about for a paying enterprise might do
worse than acclimatise the latest trans-Pacific
notion—the “Society Blue Book.” This up-to-
date volume contains the names, addresses, and
“At Home” days of the
within a reasonable radius of the printing-office,
and I see no just cause why we shouldn’t have
the Botany Bay—beg pardon—Sydney Blue Book,
the Melbourne Blue Book, &c,, run on similar
lines.
I am quite convinced that the success of such a
venture rests with the outward elegance of its
promoters. A man named Smith, who canvassed
Darling Point or Toorak in elastic-side boots with
a pencil behind his ear, wouldn’t elicit a line of
authentic data, while a tall army-officerish man,
named De la Tour, with spats on, and a bouton-
niere like a cheese-plate, would get enough
sassiety details in one afternoon to fairly swamp
the first issue. I seriously advise picturesque
speculators on their frayed ends to try the
“ Society Blue Book,” which sounds just the sort
of gilt-edged blatant volume to suit Australian
sassiety (as prone to advertise itself as a played-
out burlesque actress) to the very finger-tips.
I wonder whether Mr. Henniker Heaton’s social-
code cables are-in operation yet ? The idea was,
you remember, to allow Australian globe-trotters
to send reassuring messages at the much-reduced
rate of a shilling a word to their sorrowing
relatives down-under. But it seems to me that
the notion is a very mischievous one, considering
the parlous state of Australasian “society”
journalism.
As things are now, when Lady Hyphen waves
us farewell over the taffrail of a P. and O.
boat, we can safely congratulate ourselves on
having got nd of her for a good six months or so
—barring occasional “extracts” from “private
letters” obviously written for publication. But
social-code cheap messages will most certainly
change all that. “The many friends of Mrs.
Asterisk will be thrilled to hear that she bowed to
the fourth cousin of a German Prince, the day
before yesterday.” Or; “It is cabled that Miss
Blank goes to try on a new parasol to-morrow.”
As things are at present the news-cableman is
sufficiently frivolous and restricted in his views as
to what the nation is really interested in, but with
cheap social-code messages on the one side, and
the “Social” columns of “leading” newspapers
on the other, Heaven only knows what we’ll
drivel down to! If H. H.’s shilling-code eventu-
ates, imprisonment for life ought to be the punish-
ment for letting a message leak out in print.
Harping, more or less, on social distinction : in
the visitors’ list of the Grosvenor (Sydney) when
a man is outwardly a bachelor he is given the bob-
tail-looking title of “ Esq.”—but plain “ Mister ’
is good enough for poor Benedict—the married
man. “After all, it’s only when a Johnny is
single that he feels really ‘Esq.,’” says a man
I know who has been through the whole circus.
I have received from the composer—Margaret
Huntley—afeebly-pretty waltz, “The Aetinotus.”
It is just the sort of waltz one can imagine a
young lady with her hair nicely “ done ” sitting
down to compose in a drawing-room full of plush
furniture ; and it may be highly recommended to
boarding-schools, wildly speaking, “Coolgardie,”
a song with inoffensive music, by Signor Lardelli,
is the sort of uncalled-for musical effort you meet
a few moons hence wrapped round a pound of
butter. By the way, that exuberantly-talented
lady, Maud Fitz-Stubbs, issues her Musical Album
shortly with a portrait of herself on the cover.
It is rumoured that one of the beauteous im-
ported W. and M. models has been married to a
well-to-do Sydneyite who used to drive her to
Rock Lily on Sunday, and now guardian and
trustees and all that sort of thing are rushing to
and fro in great disorder. For my part, I believe
it’s a true bill. When the models left for Mel-
bourne, the particular charmer implicated was the
only poseuse who had apparently nobody to see
her off!
“A girl can do what she likes so long as her hair’s
down,” says one of the characters in “The New
Boy.” Was ever truism truer ? Every Saturday
morning the Block (George or Oollins-street—you
take your choice) is mobbed by flocks of young
females with capes of frizzy hair, who behave like
chorus-girls on the qui vive —with apparently
no glimmering of a notion as to what may happen
to a frisky young thing in Australia who lays
down a somewhat broad line of conduct for herself
from 12 to 15, and regards her mop of tortured
hair as an ample excuse for a multitude of very
respectable sins. Though fully competent from a
very early age to instruct their grandmothers in
the art of sucking eggs, these hn-de-sihde disciples
of the curling-tongs travel on their flowing manes
and revealed ankles, with an evident determination
to cram all their crimes into their legally-irre-
sponsible stage, returning to a more marketable
stand-offishness of demeanour when the hair-pin
season arrives. Certainly Australian experience
goes to proves that a girl really does do as she
likes while her hair’s down, and I cordially shake
hands with Miss Edith Housley over that senti-
ment.
Her many Australian friends will be pleased to
learn that Miss Myra Kemble is convalescent
after her recent serious illness, and was billed to
leave for Australia at the end of November. I
hear that her reduced avoirdupois is a subject of
much rejoicing to Miss Kemble, who must now
look more like Sarah Bernhardt than ever.
I have just been looking at a Sydney paper
which has recently contracted a bad habit of
rushing into print with a “ portrait of the ac-
cused,” and which added another horror to the
Wairarapa wreck by printing an alleged likeness
of the heroine of the disaster ; likewise her bosom
friend. But how those two portraits knock the
romance out of it! “Who has not heard the
history of this young girl’s devotion?” wails the
letterpress, and then you are given the portrait of
an up-to-snuff-looking “ stale virgin with a winter
face,” and every vestige of mermaidish glamor
perishes on the spot. Further on you light upon
the portrait of the heroine’s crony—a bald-browed
boarding-housekeeper, with a mouth like a splin-
ter. One of the most awful risks a woman runs
in getting shipwrecked is that “live” dailies will
print her stolid portrait, if they get a chance, in-
stead of leaving the public imagination to picture
her with her snowy hands folded on her marble
bosom, and her long golden tresses|floating on the
billows.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, November 27.
The R.O. Cathedral “Old English Pair” still
holds possession of our Exhibition Building, and
rakes in the coin of the faithful with vigor un-
abated. The booth interior and fittings resemble
art-muslin drawing-rooms or suburban fancy-
shops, and the roadway is cumbered with phaetons,
frilly French beds, and so on. The Fair is a sort
of holy Flemington, where one “ has a bit ” on
the race-game, or any other gamble that you can
think of. Cries of “ I’ll pay Patron 1 ” may
generally be heard rending the air.
Opening-day at the Fair was good fun to
such as didn’t get in with holy orders. The
clean-shaven “fathers,” fat and flurried to a man,
must have had a worse time than St, Anthony
himself. One saw them looming dimly through
circumambient clouds of damsels, who thrust
pencils and brandished note-books in a manner
suggesting no alternative but business or brute-
force.
But, after all, perhaps I am wrong in supposing
that the fathers didn't enjoy themselves. One
advantage of a celibate clergy is, that sixpence
cajoled from the parish sky-pilot in a good cause
does not necessarily imply a reduced supper of
bread-and-scrape for the gaping mouths of his
young ravens. Moreover, one may walk on the
same side of the road as his reverence without
letting loose the dogs of war in the fold—a privi-
lege denied the Protestant spinster whose soul is
pastured by a disengaged curate.
At the inaugural ceremony. Lady Hopetoun
wore the same fawn crepon, with pink chiffon
vest, which graced Parliament opening, and which
was then described by a special reporter as
“ a pale green dress with a pink scarf.” The vice-
regal party was met at the entrance and paired off
with ecclesiastics, so as to counterbalance each
temporal potentate by a spiritual dignitary. This
two-by-two arrangement apparently rather amused
the Countess, but her wily chieftain seemed to
float on billows of reverential admiration and
respect. When two or three steps leading from
the platform to the hall were encountered, he
turned and dutifully assisted “his grace” down
the giddy incline. The jovial archbishop, leaning
indulgently on the slender support of Lord H’s
arm, Winked the other eye hard, as much as to
say, ** Pm not such old china that I couldn’t come
down by myself, but this sort of thing looks well.”
Indeed, it was a great chance for an enterprising
snap-shot photographer.
Most of the stall-keepers’ fancy-costumes are
hackneyed enough, though one girl, whose trail-
ing robes display splashes of fused metal glitter-
ing here and there, is decidedly unusual.
Mrs. Ivo Bligh was much observed at the recent
cricket-match in company with Mrs. Geo. Chirn-
side, to whom she formed a striking contrast in
complexion and coloring generally. Both ladies,
however, were completely outrivalled in public
notice by Captain Forbes, the bridegroom-elect of
next Thursday (29th). The gallant captain, per-
vaded even more than usual by a vast smile, com-
placently basked in the sunshine of short-lived
fame. Be the approaching ceremony, authorities
are at loggerheads on a matter of vital impor-
tance. One maintains that the Governor is to be
best-man. This is scouted as a sheer impossi-
bility in the case of a benedict by the opposite
faction, the members of which stake all they hold
dear on the probability of His Ex, standing in
loco parentis to his aide-de-camp, and giving him
away with his blessing and a handsome present.
Dr. Gray’s daughters sustained the family
reputation for looks, on the second day of the
match. One wore heliotrope muslin; another a
white linen suit made with a neat little double-
breasted jacket—an agreeable variation on the in-
evitable fly-open coat of the last few seasons. A
Judge’s wife aired the tartan-trimmed gown that
won so much newspaper notice at Cup-time.
People still dwell fondly on their memories of
the final Hopetoun festivities, signalised by the
unprecedented affability of the hostess. The
joyous abandon of Melb. vice-regalities was often
in marked contrast to the frigid endurance of less
fortunate compeers who sighed at every pause in
the conversation as if in fancy they heard the
clank of their chains. Of course this melancholy
is not always due to the “crudity of colonial
society,” but may sometimes be traced to domestic
sources. One Australian pro-consul, at all
events, has Household Tyrant inscribed on
his brow (so to speak), and at the garden-
party no one was a scrap surprised when
he was caught worriting his womankind.
As his eye rested upon a little daughter engaged in
mild flirtation with a harmless attache, one
almost heard him growl that he’d soon put a stop
to that sort of thing. Anyway, he did it by
calling the damsel to heel quite in the manner of
the heavy father. Miss Innocence, hoping against
hope, turned a deaf ear until pa repeated the
summons in an awful voice, adding, as an after-
thought, that she’d better come and sit beside her
mother or she’d be too tired. Never before had I
heard “sitting by your mother” prescribed as a
cure for fatigue.
The peace of a Victorian irrigation colony has
been rudely disturbed by the conduct of one of its
settlers, who, after proposing unsuccessfully to
every unappropriated female in the settlement,
wrote to the local parson and requested him, to
appoint him a wife. The good man, not wishing,
perhaps, to cut the supply of Sunday-school
teachers too fine, ignored the communication and
let things drift. Just the other day, when the
bishop of the diocese arrived on his pastoral visit,
he received a written indictment of. the incumbent.
The dignitary immediately summoned a vestry
meeting, and, solemnly breaking the seal in the
presence of the assemblage, read aloud, in porten-
tous tones, a lengthy complaint that the shepherd
had neglected the duties of his sacred office in not
providing his congregation with wives. The
bishop, I hear, tried to reason with the malcon-
tent, but to no purpose. Romeo wants Juliet,
and is strong in the conviction that a parson
ought to be able to fix him up. When you come
to think of it, a reverend matrimonial agent, who
took out his com. in the form of ordinary mar-
riage-fees, would do a splendid business.
A certain Melbourne damsel, whose toney en-
gagement has been announced, will surely find
married life an eternal honeymoon, judging from
what one hears about the Benedict-to-be. The
day when he will start devoting himself to a wife
of his own has yet to be fixed, I believe; but,
meanwhile, he trains for the event by giving other
husbands a splendid example of polite attention
to their good ladies. I have known oases in
which a bachelor’s gallantry to a married woman
set idle tongues wagging idle calumnies, but this
is quite different. Here we have an ornament to
his sex practising the arts that please in an inno-
cent way with his eye fixed on the happy future.
A conscientious fellow who thinks of getting
married naturally cultivates the art of making
himself agreeable to a wife. It follows that he
must find another fellow’s wife to play leading
lady at the rehearsals.
An Oriental boat-song, arranged by Bucalossi
from a Turkish melody, is about the catchiest
thing in half-a-dozen new publications received
from Ricordi and Co., of London. A soprano
who “sings with expression” might score with
‘ In Those Soft Silken Curtains,” from Puccini’s
recent opera of “ Manon Lescaut,” which hasn’t
been heard out of Italy, as far as I know. Two
other operatic extracts are from Verdi’s “Fal-
staff ” —“ When I was Page,” a rather difficult
number for mezzo-soprano or baritone, and a
pianoforte setting of the minuet in act 3. Verdi’s
minuet is built on a couple of light airs, which
variate extensively ; and it is reirhirkable forimot
being churchy in sentiment.
In the prospectus issued by a well-advertised
Melb. pen-lady, touting for subscriptions for her
forthcoming novel, the Hopetouns, Clarkes, and
other notables are embodied in a list headed
“ Patrons d’ Honneur.” Paid patrons would cer-
tainly be a novelty.
In view of the prospective rational-dress de-
velopments, some of the Melb. drapers are, I see,
getting supplies of stockings “ well padded at the
calves ” to meet the deficiencies of the bony.
At a recent amateur theatrical show in a Melb.
suburban town-hall the stage was high, the seats
were low, and a certain lady scribbler, who was
doing a leading part, would persist in crossing her
legs in full view of the audience. And for the
rest of the piece the male onlookers were engaged
in speculation as to whether they were real or
padded.
Mr. and Mrs. Brunel-Norman (the latter Miss
Adey Brunei) have commenced a series of “ Men’s
Evenings ”at their rooms in Collins-street. The
first was held on Monday week’, when H. H.
Champion discoursed eloquently and effectively
on Socialism and the Labor Question to an
audience of artists and literary people. The pro-
gramme is a chat on some leading subject, fol-
lowed by musical and vocal items, &c., and the
initial gathering was a distinct success.

writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

A good deal of sympathy is wasted, re-
marks a Bulletin correspondent, on the N.S.W.
squatters who have gone under during the last
year or two. Wool and stock have no doubt fallen
tremendously in price, though not nearly so much
ai wheat. But, on the average, station improve-
ments (especially fencing) can be put up for half
what they cost 10 years back. River freights
have fallen more than, the price of wool, to say
nothing of ocean freights. Insurance is much
lower. Scores of station-hands are working for
10s. a week and rations (which are also much
reduced in cost). The fact is, many pastoralists
owe their troubles less to “bad times” than to
freehold hunger.

One Melb. matrimonial-agency has its
minister installed in one of the most prominent
buildings in a leading thoroughfare. The hand-
somely-furnished rooms face the street, and as the
lace curtains of the sanctuary are not closed, much
entertainment is at times afforded to people
outside. The other tenants of the building
object to this matrimonial forge, since about half-
a-dozen couples are tied together daily at the
establishment, and the newly-wedded couples
emerging from the building mix with others who
are also coining out. This at times leads to con-
fusion, and tenants complain that they are often
mistaken for the victims by passers-by.

He might have escaped any day.
There was once a man, who, on account of his
reli gious convictions, was arrested by a despotic
government and thrown into prison. Looking at
trie strong stone walls that shut him in, he natur-
ally conoluded that he must spend the rest of his
clays in this lonely and dismal place. Yet wretched
as trie prospect was, there was some comfort in the
t.iouglit that he was a victim of oppression, and
not undergoing punishment as a violator of any
good and righteous law. All the same, he would
have been glad to get out, as he had a right to do
if he could.
. Nevertheless, there he stayed and languished for
sixteen years. At nearly tho end of that period
it occurred to him one day to climb up on a
projecting stone in the wall and take a peep
through the window above his head. He did so,
and found the iron bars removable and the sash
not fastened. An idea struck him, of course.
Vv ny not escape ? He opened the window, jumped
six feet to the ground, and left that district
immediately. He might have done so at any time
during his protracted occupancy of the place, if he
bad only been blessed with a more inquiring mind
and not taken so much for granted.
Now here comes an incident both like and unlike
that of the martyr; like it because there was loss
of free action, unlike it because the sufferer was
not imprisoned as he was.
The story is in the form of a letter, one of those
letters we all prefer to get—short and made up of
short words. The writer, a lady, says : “For the
last sixteen years I have been greatly afflicted
with bilious complaints and weakness. I was
always tired, weak, and low-spirited. I had no
appetite, and when food was placed before me
I could not toucli it. For days I could scarcely
eat anything. At times I was troubled with
sickness and heaving at the stomach, spitting up a
thick phlegm. I had a troublesome cough, with
pain at my chest and difficulty of breathing. I
got very weak and could scarcely drag myself in
and out of the shop. In December, 1891, I began
to take a medicine I had heard well spoken of by
many of my customers, called Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. After I had taken only a few
doses I felt relief, and I had not used the medicine
for a fortnight when I felt better than I had done
for years. Thus encouraged, I kept on with it
until I was restored to good health. My son,
Arthur, had suffered off and on for a year from
p.iin and heaviness after meals, with a sinking
feeling at the pit of the stomach. He was induced
to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and the
result was the same as in my own case. I know
-several persons in this district who have been
cured by the Syrup after all other means had
failed. You are at liberty to publish my letter if
you think it might be of benefit to others afflicted
as I was.—Yours truly, (signed) (Mrs.) M. Ward,
174, Ilkeston-road, Radford, Nottingham, April
Ist, 1892. *
We congratulate Mrs. Ward upon her deliver-
ance from a distressing and dangerous disease.
What a pity she did not sooner learn how easily
and certainly she could be cured. Sixteen years
is too large a slice out of one’s life to be spent in
bodily and mental misery. Very few of us can
have wealth in any case, but health should be a
blessing common and universal as sunshine. And
it might be if everybody knew how to preserve it
when they possess it, or to regain it when lost.
This lady’s disease was of the digestive organs—
indigestion and dyspepsia—the most afflictive and
perilous of all, because it involves every function of
the body, scattering its poison at every point
through the medium of the blood. Nearly all
ailments are but the differently-named results and
symptoms of this prolific parent of evil. That the
remedy she mentions should have cured her will
not surprise those who know its well-founded
reputation. Many worse cases constantly yield
to it.
. Our friend the martyr abode in his cell a weary
time because he was ignorant of the simple way
out. If the reader of these lines is a captive to
disease he has no excuse for remaining so. In her
short and honest letter our correspondent points
to the open door.
There are three books, all apparently out
of print, whioh badly need republishing ; “ Old
New Zealand,” by Pakeha-Maori ; “Remini-
scences of New South Wales and Victoria,” by
Judge Therry ; and “ South Sea Bubbles,” by the
(of Pembroke) and the Doctor (Kingsley).
lheß6' volumes are now hard to get, and are a
treat in store for anyone who has not read them.
Andrew Carnegie, in an article in tha
Contemporary Review, demonstrates that living
in the United States is less costly than in Eng-
land, most of the necessaries of life being 10 per
cent, cheaper in the protected Land of the Wooden
Ham. Considering that Britain imports annually
about *100,000,000 worth of goods from the U.S.
solely on account of their superior cheapness, Car-
negie’s statements seem to rest on good evidence.
It was in Adelaide. The talk was of the
varying laws in the different American States,
and Oellier (the dead composer of “Dorothy”)
took part in it. “I had a friend whose career
proves what you say,” he remarked. “He lived
in Philadelphia, and his wife brought an action
for divorce against him on the ground of impo-
tence. While the case was proceeding be crossed
over into a neighboring State, and, while there,
a former servant sued him on an affiliation sum-
mons. He lost both cases.”
“It takes one’s breath away,” say* S.F.
Argonaut. “ There are many men who do not
believe in the so-called seduction of women, and
who absolutely decline to listen to anything
concerning the * seduction ’ of married women.
But even these men are chary of proclaiming their
views, and never before their womankind. Now
comes a woman, and goes further than any man
has dared to do. According to her, a woman is an
equal party in a ‘seduction,’ and if that is denied,
her mental competency is denied. Altogether,
Miss Ford has presented a hard nut for her sisters
to crack.”
A Wanganui (M.L.) settler, the other day,
instructing a new hand as to his duties, told him,
among other things^that the “missus” was short
of good fuel, and pointed out a manuka tree to be
cut down and sawn into firewood first opportunity.
A few days later business took the master away
for a couple Of days. On the morning after his
return he asked the man if he had carried out his
parting instructions. “ No,” was the answer, “ I
cut down that manuka instead.” Though not
entirely satisfactory, this reply set the settler’s
mind at ease regarding the “ missus ” and the
next batch of bread. What was his surprise,
therefore, when, at breakfast, she began the same
old song—“no wood worth the name.” After
breakfast he walked round, and found the tree
neatly stacked behind his man’s whare. Cursing
the fellow’s stupidity, he went for a wheelbarrow
and proceeded to load up. On his way to the
house he met the new employe, who hotly accused
him of “stealing his wood!” The upshot was
that the man gave a week’s notice. He could
stand a good deal, he said, but he could not stand
“ a thief ” as a master.
Dear Bulletin, —Ogden, Labor M.P. for
Townsville (Q.), is being roasted by the local Tory
press for having, ataeonvivial meeting of members,
deliberately remained seated and refused to join
in honoring the toast of “The Queen.” Ogden
was stupid to refuse to drink any toast, if the
liquor was good. Small attention need be paid to
a man, anyhow, who, without any special call for
uneonvi viality, unnecessarily advertises his alleged
Republicanism when it bears no sort of significance
to the occasion of the gathering. Such gassy pro-
tests are bad form. Republicans need never
propose an unnecessary toast, but it is mere
vanity that urges them to act singularly when an
unnecessary toast helps to pass the liquor round.
Anthony Ogden might just as well snort and re-
fuse to drink to the memory of Mother Shipton,
on the ground that his principles did not permit
him to believe in fortune-telling and prophecy.
It is better for the Democrats to let the Tories
exhibit all the “bad taste,” and just keep on un-
swervingly in tbeir Democratic orbits. The man
who is fond of advertising his personal prejudices
merely for the sake of notoriety, Us generally tha
most easily nobbled by opponents, and the most
amenable to “ influence.”—W.W.

The ARGUS prows daily more fatuous about the
tax on unimproved values of land. It now instances the
shocking case of John Smith thus:—“John Smith, a poor
man, puts up a cottage, which is all he can afford, on a
suburban allotment. He pays the tax on the value of the
land say, £4 per foot. Brown and Robinson, who are
rich men, come'along and build fine houses, cosling each
many thousands of pounds, and the improvements they
effect send the value of land up to £8 per foot. John
Smith’s tax is therefore doubled. And, rich as Brown and
Robinson are, and grand as are their houses, and larger, of
course, as are all the benefits they receive from the State,
they pay no more than does Smith.” John Smith has the
value of his land doubled by other people’s expenditure,
and he is an ungrateful rascal if he objects to pay a trivial
tax on that tremendous unearned increment. There is
not a man in the land who would not readily give the
4-lOths per cent, per annum on increased capital values
that the Id. in the £ represents. As for Brown’s and
Robinson’s riches, the income-tax fits them like a glove.
Not many weeks ago (writes an Anglo-Austra-
lian from London to The Bulletin) a man I know was so
hard up that he borrowed half-a-sov. from me. A few
days since I met him, when he paid me back and told me
that he had spent the money to much advantage in
standing lunch to a man from whom he bought a Westra-
lian mine “ next but two or three to Bayley’s." He got it
for £lOO down (which he managed to get from a specula-
tive bank), £5OO when a company was floated, and 5000
shares. The capital of this precious company is over
i 60,000, and all the working capital provided for is
i 12'000—the balance having gone into the pockets of my
friend the promoter and his pals. I have very grave
doubts whether any such mine exists, though possibly
the vendor will be able to deliver documents for some
rubbishy claim. It all reminds me of the boom
of 1886-7, when a man I wot of, who had been a black-
smith in the Far North, used to get from £5OO to £l5OO
for reports on mines he had never seen, even if he ever
heard of them. I hear that this gentleman is now in
London, and though I have not seen his name mentioned
in connection with Westralia, I have no doubt he would
be ready at a moment’s n> tice to write a report and affix
his name to it as M.E.

Stock-broker Meudell writes that the W.A.
boom is one of the most disastrous things which have ever
happened in Australia in gold-mining. Well, perhaps so.
Then he proceeds:—“ Everything is going out of Victoria,
nothing is coming back. Goolgardie has killed Behdigo
and Ballarat. Investors have thrown up their interests —
sound and hona-Jide interests—in Vie. mines, and all the
money is going away to pay calls in prospecting ventures
—wild cat schemes—in West Australia. So far, there has
been absolutely no return except the Bayley divs.” But
there is a big set-off. The carrying trade 1 , and shipping
trade, and hanking trade qf Westralia are in the hands, of
Victorians. Seven-eighths of the gold produced reaches
Victoria, and the profits of handling this t 700,000 an-
nually go into Vic. pockets; The return trade is enor-
mous. Westralia : wants mining-machinery, and Mel-
bourne is the market. As for gbld-productionJn Victoria,
tint is increasing rapidly :

A M.L. cable states that the appeal case of Skey
v. Mutual Life Assn, has been dismissed. This action,
originally heard at Wellington, presented some curious
feitures. The plaintiff, Dr. Skey, is Government Analyst.
His son was assured in the Mutual Life for £lOOO, and
w. one of his premiums became due lie gave a local
agent in the country a cheque, asking him to hold it over
for a certain time. This was done, but as the cheque
Wasn’t met, he was asked to hold it over for another
specific period, which was agreed to. The agent lived in
an adjoining township, and his bafik would not send it to
Skey’s hank until the day after that agreed on, according
to the usual course of business. On the day the money
became due the assured was killed by an engine, and next
morning a friend, acquainted with the facts, went to the
bank as soon as it was opened and paid in a sum of money
specially “ear-marked” to meet the cheque. The cheque
was, of course, paid, and the money forwarded back to
the agent’s hank. The association, however, subse-
quently repudiated liability when applied to for the
insurance-money, on the ground that had the cheque
been sent in within banking hours on the specified day it
would not have been met, and the policy had conse-
quently lapsed. Deceased’s father took the case to Court,
lost it, and has now lost the appeal.

J. J. Kingsbury, M.L.A. (Queensland), in a
lecture delivered recently at Brisbane, estimated that out
of twelve reconstructed banks only four have a fair chance
of “ riding out the gale successfully ’’—the said gale being
that awful period from 1898 to 1901, when the bulk of the
deposits fall due. The others, according to Mr. Kings-
bury’s calculation, can only be saved by making new
terms with their depositors in some shape or other. His
remedy is probably the most unspeakably cheeky sugges-
tion that has yet been heard of. He proposes that the
various Australian Governments should issue interminable
3 per cent, debentures in lieu of one-half the deposits,
getting no consideration whatever—except that glow
inside the waistcoat which comes of a good conscience—
in return for the stupendous risk thus .involved. The
State is to have “adequate representation” on the direc-
torates, but, apparently, no absolutely, controlling voice ;
and there is to be no time-limit to the contract, which,
seemingly, is to go on for ever. For the other half of the
deposits the banks are to issue their own interminable
debentures at 4 per cent., so that none of the deposits are
ever to be paid in cash—they are simply to be fixed to all
eternity at the average rate of 3j per shent.
The Bulletin also proposed, some time ago,
that the StAte should issue 3 per cent, consols to the
banks’ creditors in lieu of their deposits, and takeover
the deposits in exchange. But its proposition was that
all the deposits— not half of them—should be thus dealt
with ; that the banks should pay 3J per cent, interest to
the Government, and that the difference of 10s. per cent,
should go to the Treasury to form a sinking fund as a
provision against losses, and also as some kind of pay-
ment for the risks involved in this gigantic insurance
operation ; and that until the deposits were repaid to the
State, whether in five years or five centuries, the
Government should, through its nominees, the auditors
and the chairman of directors, have an absolute veto upon
everything. Mr. Kingsbury’s proposal, which seems to
be borrowed from The Bulletin, has been so badly
spoiled in the borrowing that it would cost the banks
just as much, it would leave the State to take its risk
gratis and pay losses out of the public revenue, it would
establish the curious anomaly of guaranteeing 10s. in the
£ upon deposits and leaving the other 10s. to take their
chance with no security except the bank’s own assurance
that'the money would never be repaid, and it would take
£lOO,OOO a year more out of the country as interest to
British investors. Kingsbury, by the way, is some kind
of a financial genius, and the cumbrous intricacy of his
scheme is apparently owing to this fact. Unless a scheme
is so intricate that no ordinary person can see the mean-
ing of it, the author never gets credit for being a financial
genius.
Kingsbury’s proposal, by the way, is to apply
only to absolutely solvent banks. The creditor of an
absolutely solvent bank is almost sure to get his money
anyhow, so why he should give up his 4£ per cent, deposit
receipt payable in (say) five years, and ti.ke for half the
money a 4 per cent, receipt With just the same security
and not payable at all, passes comprehension. The Bul-
letin’s scheme was not meant to apply only to absolutely
solvent banks, but to insolvent pnes as well. Even the
worst of the legitimate banks could almost certainly be
nursed hack into solvency if it was honestly and economi-
cally, managed under. State supervision, if its deposit
interest was reduced to 3# per cent, with unlimited time,
for repayment, dividends wholly suspended if need be,
and its credit made absolutely,solid by a State guarantee;
and yet the public revenue might actually make a profit
out of the transaction. The idea of only guaranteeing
the bank which doesn’t require assistance is probably
Kingsbury’s idea of humor.

From Commerce, published for the London
Stock Exchange;—“ It has often been matter of comment
that India sterling 3 per cents, should stand at such a
high figure compared with Colonial Government securi-
ties, blit it appears to be forgotten that whereas England
connot afford to discard India’s financial obligations, our
colonies will in case of collapse be left to shift for them-
selves."

The N.S.W. Minister of Justice would do well
to nose out some of the shocking alleged scandals con-
nected with the money-borrowing and other vicious pro-
pensities of certain stipendiary magistrates. One con-
stantly hears this sort of thing : “ Oh, he dismissed the
case, did he? Wouldn’t give you a non-suit? Ah, why
didn’t you come to me ? Only last week I lent him 30
notes.” This sort of thing is becoming monotonous. A
country where it is even rumoured that there are stipen-
diary justices as cronk as the crooked amateur J.P.,
must be in a bad way.

Down South it is beginning to be an open scan-
dal that unless a solicitor is on terms of friendship with
the sitting honorary magistrates he often standsapoorshow
as to success and costs if the other member of the Devil’s
Brigade who opposes him be on hobnobbing terms with
the beaks. In one glaring case a well-known solicitor
makes it a rule to cultivate the J.sP. of every suburb,
and it is questionable if 95 per cent, of them have not
spread their legs beneath his mahogany. Furthermore, it
is alleged that this particular lawyer gets thumping big
costs, while his less fortunate brethren are lucky to get
bare fees.

Editor Bulletin, —This is how some of us pub
in our time on the Murchison. A party of four left Cue
for Lake Carey, prospecting, and on arriving at the heia
camped at water, where three other parties w r ere spelling
their horses. Next day one party pack up to have a look
round for a few days. Third day no appearance of their re-
turn, and the idea left is that they must have struck some-
thing, and away start No. 2 party on their tracks. Party
No. 3, after waiting two days in anticipation, reckon it a
moral that Nos. 1 and 2 are “ on it,” and they depart fol-
lowing No. 2’s tracks. Next morning, No. 4 party ape
“ dead sure " that a patch has been struck, and follow in
hot haste on the now well-marked track. Evening of
same day No. 1 party return without a color to old camp
to find it deserted; guess they must have got word and all
cleared out. “We had better follow them ’’—and next
morning they didi But No. 2 party got “full” and
decided to return to Cue, which they did ; and in due
course one by one the others arrived, each expecting to
hear of some big rush. But they didn’t. —A. 8., The

Melb. Mining Exhibition judges issued Ist order
of merit medals as follows:—Bloomfield Bros.’ “Miner’s
Friend;” Carlson and Poole’s “Tucker Billy” gold-
saver; Grinrod and Carter’s hand and steam quartz-
crushers; Guthridge and Co.’s “Duplex” stamper
battery; Drysdale and Fraser’s “The Miner’s Valuer;”
A. B. Pierce’s “ Simplex ” collection ; Bennie, Teace and
Co.’s general mining appliances.
In addition to these they showered out 2nd,
3rd, and 4th class certificates. It is to be hoped that the
judges will give reasons for the faith that is in them.
They possibly mean “Ist class” as a'relative expression.
To take the first on the list as an instance :
The “ Miner’s Friend,” as a dry-process gold-saver, has
the beginnings of a good idea. It is also portable and
cheaply constructed. But, as shown on at least one day
at the Exhibition, it is clumsy and awkward to work in
its present form. The idea is right enough, but its exe-
cution is something different. When The Bulletin saw
Tucker Billy he did not have his electrical section in any-
thing like good order, and the attention of his energetic
owners is called to this fact. Carlson and Poole certainly
have failh in their invention, and gave more public trials
than any other exhibitor.
Carlson and Poole’s Tucker Billy seems excel-
lent as far as its mechanical side goes—but the scientific
side is crude. The idea is to treat chemically the gold
that may escape its ripples and canvas frames. A tiny
stream of potassium cyanide is allowed to flow into the
tailings, which presently pass over amalgamation plates
charged with a current of electricity. The cyanide will,
have brightened the fine gold, and perhaps dissolved a
little of it. The brightness of the gold will assist the
mercury on the plates, and the electricity will not only
quicken the mercury but precipitate the dissolved gold
from the cyanide.

Ye golden sands, embracing
An unresisting sea;
Ye little waves, effacing
Each other’s pedigree;
Ye fleecy clouds of summer,
Enwrapt in frolic task;
Is Nature but a mummer
Who sobs behind her mask ?
A broken-hearted mummer
Who sobs behind her mask ?
The wattle-birds are calling
Their mates beneath the trees ;
The healing dews are falling
’Mid vesper-melodies;
Each tender bloom is closing ;
The sun slants to his rest;
See, Life again reposing
Upon a mother’s breast—
Exhausted Life reposing
Upon her mother’s breast.
O watchman, cold and scornful,
With lantern slung on high,
Patrolling, pale and mournful,
Athwart the studded sky ;
Be wisdom in thy keeping,
Make answer to my prayer—
Is wanton Nature weeping?
Is foul as good as fair ?
Speak, say is Nature weeping,
Is foul as good as fair !
Is Life a useless battle ;
Is all ambition mean ;
Is Love a sordid chattel;
Is Hope deceptive sheen?
Dwells nought supreme, eternal;
Gan man alone perceive ?
Say, sentinel nocturnal,
Doth kindly Nature grieve?
Speak, sentinel nocturnal,

From firmament to ocean
All Impulse is of God.

Dear Bulletin,—Your hypercritical cor-

commits him to the consequence that we shouldn’t

thing, and one of the things we can’t help is being
proud of _what we can’t help ! Which brings us to
the inevitable dead-lock between the emotional
and the logical; for, the more the latter predomin-
ates, the more evident it becomes that nothing
in rerum naturd is a subject for praise or blame,
pride or shame—because it simply couldn’t have
been otherwise. And as man’s emotions, there-
fore, couldn’t have been otherwise, we end exactly
where we began.—A.
S.M. Herald maintains that irrigation in
N.S. Wales “ will have to be carried out on the
basis of private enterprise,” and unblushingly
cites the Vie. example—presumably of Mildura ! !!
—as an illustration of the soundness of its con-
tention. The Herald’s ideal of so-called “pri-
vate enterprise ” is that the State shall subsidise
with valuable concessions and monopolies a few
fatted individuals in order that these may do,
chiefly with the money of unsubsidised fools,
what the State can very easily and very profitably
do for itself. The Herald hangs its monstrous
arguments upon the solitary fact that the im-
pecunious and hampered Wentworth (N.S.W.)
Municipal Council failed to establish on a sound
basis an Irrigation Trust needing some funds and
some credit as a starting capital.

was five days before he chanced out again, and
all the time he hadn’t been as many miles from
camp ! If he’d had any chopping to do be could
have back-tracked easily enough, but it was
“ naked ” forest—no undergrowth, sun-proof over-
head, nearly dark below—and ground too hard
for any white man to “ pick up ” from. “ I
heard your rifles plain enough,” he said, “but
every report was like file-firing all round the com-
pass I And all the time Z never saw enough sun

In the Bamboos: a Tale of the
Northern Territory .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sand and shingle. Stretches of deep-blue water
and high banks crowmed with a line of bamboos.
Such is the Daly river at the place I am talking
about. The bamboos have not the swaying
slender stems of the ornamental clumps grown in
temperate climes, but are sturdy trees, crossing
and recrossing each other, and weaving an intri-
cate network of branches absolutely impenetrable,
for the irOn-like trunks would turn the edge of a
Japanese sword.
Two men riding along the outer edge of the
bamboo thicket noticed a dark object apparently
suspended in the interlaced boughs. Dismounting
and getting as near as they could, they made it
out to be a dry, shrivelled human body, probably
white, for some rags of clothing still hung on to
it. Parallel with the river along a great portion
of its course runs a chain of lagoons, about
half-a-mile back. It was early in the day, so the
men went to the nearest lagoon and camped, then
returned on foot to try and find out what the
thing in the bamboos really was. It was sundown
ere they had managed to hack and break and bend
a path through the few yards that separated them
from the mummy-like corpse. It had been a
white man once, but as to how he came there or
by his death there was no clue whatever. Further
search around revealed the iron of a saddle, bear-
ing the marks of fire, and a hobble chain. It was
over a hundred miles to the nearest station, so
they buried it as best they could, and presently
reported the matter to the authorities.
The blacks told the story afterwards. Some two
years before the murders at the copper-mine a
German was prospecting alone on the Daly. He
camped for the night at the lagoon afterwards
visited by the two men, and in the middle of the
night the blacks, who were thick about there,
rushed his camp. He got away to the scrub, and,
urged on by love of life, strove to get through
the thicket. Apparently he worked his way
with desperate energy amongst the boughs until
he actually penetrated a few yards, then, accord-
ing to the position in which the body was found,
he must have got nipped by the leg between two
stems. There was a strong wind blowing, and
the bamboos would work like the rigging of a
rolling ship. This same wind, or the blacks,
started his camp-fire amongst the long grass, and
it travelled straight for the scrub. Amongst the
bamboos there was, of course, no grass, but plenty
of dry litter; yet the grass grew rank to the edge
and close enough, with the high wind, to roast
and scorch and half 7 sraother the poor wretch
without killing him outright.
The gins said that he whimpered and moaned
for two days.

Mrs. Besant is lamentably weak on the
spook question. Interviewed in Melbourne re the
collapse of poor little “Cissie,”she still clung to
her faith in Mrs. Mellon, and told the reporter—
“ You know, it very often happens that mediums
cannot control the results of genuine stances, and
then they give way to frauds, so that the public
may see something for their money.” The good
woman cannot recognise the plain fact that a
genuine seance is simply a fraud which escapes
exposure. For proof of a spook’s bona-fides the
world has to depend upon fatuous M’Carthys,
who cheerfully accept a black mask as a black face
until somebody proves their gullibility. Mrs.
Besant’s explanation is terribly rough on mediums,
anyway. On her high authority, they are pro-
fessional swindlers, who go straight occasionally.
Wanted, a medium who will return money at the
doors when the genuine ghost declines to walk.
A tip for Purves, Q.C. A (struggling
with his friends to renew the onslaught against
B): “Well, he called me a liar; he called me a
liar. Let me go !” B (little Scotchman, much
worsted in previous onslaught, and racking his
brains for some means of avoiding further punish-
ment) ; “ Weel, and what if I did call you a leer !
Isn’t a leer a technical term in everyday use?"
Result - verdict for B.

Says kind Mrs. Besant—
If Cissie’s not present
And Geordie can’t come when he’s bid,
You give each glad noodle
The price of his boodle
By raising up visions with “ kid.”
Quite easy the task—
Some wigs and a mask,
A broom-handle ready when wanted,
A robe snowy white—
You turn out the light
And tell ’em the chamber is haunted.
Quite calm and serene,
Sitting close to the screen,
You put your professional jam on,
Till the seancers say,
“ She is melting away ! ”
Then they worship the spirit of Gammon.
But sometimes a stranger
Your game will endanger,
In spite of its genuine merits,
By quitting his chair
(Which is highly unfair)
And taking a pull at the sperrita.
His soul, mean and sordid,
Is not to be Geordied
Or Cissied—he’s only a boor
Whom Cultchaw despises.
He spots your disguises
And leaves you in tears on the floor.
But you make out a case
For the mark on your face
Which allays all suspicion of bluffing ;
And with true woman wit
You discreetly admit
That you bought a spook’s whiskers for stuffing.
