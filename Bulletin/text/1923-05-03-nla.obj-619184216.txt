The Red Page
The Mental Wardrobe
Recently a Red Page contributor ob-
served that s is a disreputable letter
because it is snake-shaped and because it pre-
fixes many unlovely words. Longfellow has
charitably said of Satan: “He, too, is God’s
minister, and labors for some good by us
not understood!” The letter s is the satan
of the alphabet; but its mission is not mys-
tifying. Destined to disreputability as it
undoubtedly is through its serpent shape and
sound, its atonement is service: no other
letter begins so many words. And it should
be noted that numerous of its prefixions are
decidedly praiseworthy. Like the de-Para-
disecl Lucifer’s, its soul is not entirely
damned.
The defamatory observation struck the
chimes of memory; it set me searching. I
have ‘ now found what I was after, an ex-
ample of metaphor-decay in a well-loved
grammar-book of my unreturnable, misjudged
schooldays: “The young man about London
or Paris was branded as a fanged, but hand-
less, spider, that sucks indeed and stings,
but cannot spin—this with an intensified
sibilation, which made the whole sentence
a hiss.” Evidently Mrs. Grundy in good
form and full of venom! The criticism is
brilliant, in that it carries in the sound of
it the medium of comparison. It is quite
by the way, of course, that “fangbd” and
“handless” are open to improvement.
Such skilful choice of words is a glimpse
of the science of the game. It gives insight
into the writing mind, the mind of no rest,
as its kink compels it to ceaselessly range
the immeasurable distances of the imagina-
tion to satisfy an idea. An idea has purely
feminine qualities. Once launched upon in-
quisitiveness it never lets up until satiated.
As a woman often does, it graciously be-
stows little rewards for having been thus
gratified. These rewards are peculiar ; they
are flashes of word-life straining to reach
the pen. _ They are, as it were, the near-to-
birth children of the mind begotten of the
passion to write. Diligence and patient care
are the labor-pains, and “choice of words”
is the midwife. How exquisite is the joy
of creation!
Every idea is more or less a tramp, a
scarecrow until tailored from the mental
wardrobe. Attiring tastefully is what gives
the big thrills. A scribe’s mind is a dic-
tionary alive. Still, it is not a mind sur-
charged with words or overburdened with
long words. Instinct, the master valet,
selects the right apparel, which is correct
words. Synonyms, the shade-values of the
language, represent the correct words. Every
noun, adjective, verb and adverb has its
own inviolable image embodied in it; con-
sequently, every so-called equivalent of an-
other word has an especial duty of finer
meaning. It is a simple matter to ruin an
ambitious line by the misuse of a word, the
synonyms of which have been disregarded.
The importance of synonyms is that they
vary in syllabication as well as in nice
meaning. The swing of a phrase needs to be
watched just as much as the sense of it. You
have succeeded in your art only when your
best lines haunt your reader. ' Rhythm in-
vites retention—and it “disarms the critics.”
Several moons ago a wise Red Page voice
uttered sound reasons why a good dictionary
was the sole book that would not bore one
who was gaoled in a lonely hut by a long-
lasting blizzard. Coinciding with the Aus-
tralian appraisement is this notable Yankee
one:—
When I feel inclined to read poetry I take down
my dictionary. The poetry of words is quite as
beautiful as that of sentences. The author may
arrange the gems effectively, but their shape and
lustre have been given by the attrition of ages.
Bring me the finest simile from the whole range of
imaginative writing, and I will show you a single
word which conveys a more profound, a more accurate
and a more eloquent analogy.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, the boy, wrote that.
Twenty-five years later, Holmes, the man,
introdoocin’ “The Autocrat of the Breakfast
Table,” made it plain that he desired immor-
tality for the pronouncement. To poets—
if not to their often envious contemporaries,
the prose-writers—the dictum does not re-
quire the seal of maturity upon it to cause
it to appear unbumptious. One illuminat-
ing illustration of bottled beauty. “Serein”
has this enchanting meaning: “A mist, or
fine rain, which falls from a cloudless sky
a few moments after sunset.” Who, once
having been silenced by the glory of this
picture-containing word, could ever cease to
love it, or fail to cherish its alphabeticated
dwelling-place, where it dreams for all time
with so many equally beautiful sisters of the
language? Words are like opals:—entran-
cingly a-swim with colors. Like all other
precious things they deserve our most devoted
handling.
In the dictionary words are asleep; in the
mind they are awake and active. They are
things of life and of yearning. Holmes again:
“A poem comes to the poet a thought tangled
in the meshes of a few sweet words—words
that have loved each other from the cradle
of the language, but have never wedded until
now.” Hyperbole? Far from it. Hyper-
bole is rouge applied to hide literary pallor,
to heighten the effect. Like all other arti-
ficialities it loses attention when natural
beauty comes alongside it. On the dressing-
table by the Autocrat’s wardrobe were a
simple brush and comb —nothing more; the
wardrobe itself contained no garments of
a too-loud, foolish pattern. The utterance
is homage, such as is paid by one who re-
verences his hobby-tools so greatly that he
imputes to them aspirations and a soul.
In proof of how fine words are, compare
your framed print of the historical slayer
with this pen-picture :
... .In the van inscrutable Napoleon went,
Dreaming of empire—and alone.
(I trust that someone in the States is squar-
ing the compliment by admiringly exploring
Australian wardrobes; for this, too, is an
Uncle Samism.) That’s Napoleon—the vast
labors of the historians compressed without
loss into 11 splendid words! The peerless
word-picture hypnotises more than the mural
one, because in it one recognises instantly
the carnage-dyed maniac for power. Fault-
less pictures like this one to hang in the
galleries of Time are the ambition of every
writer. The best chance of conceiving them
is when the mind is gaoled by mood-blizzards,
for it is then that the antidotal living die-
tionary is absorbedly searched. Some words
quicken the interest. From interest springs
achievement and—the blizzards exhaust
themselves unheeded.
R. L. CLAY.
"The High Mind"
When Jack Lindsay (R.P. 19/4/’23) de-
clares that I “introduced taunts with regard
to the alleged meanness and grasping char-
acter of Shakspeare,” I think I have a rea-
sonable right to deny the statement. In
reviews of two books and a discussion arising
out of those books I made it clear that the
authors dwelt upon the mean character of
a person in Stratford who probably did not
write the plays and who certainly was never
called Shakspeare. That is a very different
matter; and if every reviewer is to be held
responsible for all that is said by the authors
he reviews I am afraid the “high mind” is
going to be rather a confused mind.
It is this “high mind” that I want to know
about. What is it? Who owns it, and how
is its height measured? I understand from
Mr. Lindsay that Beethoven had the “high
mind” and Macaulay did not. Beethoven, I
learn, was also “the most terrific figure of
nobility that has ever been on earth.” From
this I should gather that the “high mind”
must be terrific; though I confess that terror-
inspiring nobility is a little too mixed in
idea to understand. Who was terrified? The
housekeeper at whom he threw the eggs or
only the people who heard his music? But
Macaulay had not the “high mind.” He
was merely a very good writer who helped
a lot of people to learn to read, and who
served his country faithfully in many im-
portant offices. Privately he was a good
fellow and a bit eccentric in small ways. He
has left it on record that he once accidentally-
committed highway robbery in Rome. But
I suppose he was not “terrific,” though he
did prove a fair Minister for War and sang
of Iloratius in a hoarse bass; but to say
that he could “never understand” eccentri-
city is hardly fair in the light of his strong
defence of the semi-madness of at least one
prominent statesman. Yet Mr. Lindsay is
merciless to this man, evidently because he
fails to be “terrific”; for he declares that
it is “obvious to anyone” that “Macaulay
is to Beethoven what a Hottentot would be
to Macaulay.” Has Mr. Lindsay asked
“anyone” or does he merely make the wild
statement on the general principles of his
“high mind”? It is certainly not obvious
to a vast number of English writers, and a
vaster number of English readers. I do
not like Macaulay in his general attitude
nor in the mass of his work; but my ordi-
nary mind endeavors to be fair. Once in
verse and perhaps half-a-dozen times in
prose he showed a subtlety of emotion and
an intense feeling for beauty in its most
“terrific” aspects which can largely and
honestly account for the worship shown to
him.
But the “high mind” worries me still more
when I find that the posing Byron possessed
it and the retiring Tennyson did not. What
does Mr. Lindsay see wrong with Tennyson
in this respect? True, he was "not exactly
“terrific,” but then Byron was still less so.
Tennyson was full of minor eccentricities;
his attitude was quite incorrect from a con-
ventional point of view. Byron continu-
ally posed as being correct and even
superior; though his love affairs were fre-
quent and some of them shabby, he wrote
letters about morality and religion which
were as abstract and conventional in idea
as any written by the Archbishop of Canter-
bury. Byron strutted on a stage of his
own creation; Tennyson hid himself in the
Isle of Wight and skipped over to his other
house in Surrey when crowds came to the
island to look at him. Scarcely a fact about
his private life found its way into print
until after his death; yet about the time
he wrote “(Enone*’ he was so unusual that
his friends feared Lor his sanity. He was
quite capable of throwing eggs at his house-
keeper or Greek hexameters at the cat. If
these things are admirable in Mr. Lind-
say’s estimation, why deny him the “high
mind”? On his achievement he surely de-
serves it. I fancy Mr. Lindsay will grant
the distinction of the “high mind” to Poe
and Swinburne. The former declared that
Tennyson was the “noblest poet that ever
lived” ; the latter said he was the greatest
poet of the Victorian era. I don’t like com-
parisons and cattle-show awards of greater
and less in literature; but the man who
places Byron above Tennyson has not yet
discovered the meaning of emotion. Byron
may take a place above Macaulay; but the
literary methods and manners of the" two
•are almost identical. There is the same
noise, the same cocksureness, the same in-
accuracy, the same picturesque contempt for
reality, the same open or yeiled boasting.
But Mr. Lindsay thinks Byron had the
“high mind” ; and the other man—well, no,
Mr. Lindsay didn’t actually say he was a
Hottentot.
Considering all the quaint assertions and
contradictions of Mr. Lindsay’s exposition
of the “high mind,” I am convinced that it
must be closely related to that mirth-pro-
voking American abstraction the “higher
life.” There is only one possible rule by
which the height of a mind can be judged in
literature. What did it produce?' The pri-
vate life of the writer, whether he is given
to throwing bacon at the cook or holds office
as a churchwarden —he may easily do both
—has no concern for any except his personal
friends or personal enemies. Rectitude of
life, as counted by the ordinary and perfectly
decent standards of the grocer, is no bar to
great achievement. Milton, Spenser, Gib-
bon, Scott, Wordsworth and Tennyson, with
respectability stamped all over them, have
wrought greatly and worthily for the Eng-
lish reader. Why should we bother about the
things they said when they lost a collar-
stud? The “high mind” and the dirty face
matter as little as the dress-suit and the '
chanting of psalms. What men did in their
chosen sphere of creative work is the thing
that counts. It has become a sort of fashion
among the very young to read biographies
of great men and neglect their work, just
as it has become the fashion among those

ANNOUNCEMENT.
J/ot/iGint
Electric Heating and
Cooking Appliances.
The manufacturers of the well-known fiot/ioinj devices, which for many years
have held the dominating position throughout the world in the electric heating and cooking
appliances market, joined forces some three years ago with other interests in the same
line, viz., General Electric Company (Edison) and Hushes, under the name of the Edison
Electric Appliance Company.
W. G. Watson & Co., Ltd., in recognition of their long association with
goods as sole distributors in New South Wales and Queensland of the
original Hotpoint Company, were then appointed for a period of years sole distributors in
that territory of the jfjot/ioini division of the Edison Electric Appliance Company,
and similarly the Australian General Electric Company were appointed sole distributors
of the "EDISON" line.
Recognising the universal popularity of yi&tJiovnL devices, the Edison Electric
Appliance Company have now decided to manufacture , Vot/ioinl devices only,
and by mutual agreement W. G. Watson & Co., Ltd. (as previous sole distributors of
devices), and Australian General Electric Co., Ltd. (as general agents for
Edison Electric Appliance Co.), now become joint exclusive distributors in New South
Wales and Queensland of these devices.
The Australian General Electric Co., Ltd., retain the sole right of distribution in all
other States of the Commonwealth through its branches or accredited agents.
Issued by authority of the joint distributors for New South Wales and Queensland.

BELTING
“The Belt is running for the full 2lf hours, and is giving full satisfaction.”
{Extract from letter received from the Trufood Co. of Australia, Ltd.,
Melbourne, Vic.)
The above illustration, drawn from an actual photograph, shows
a big 20in. x 8-ply Dick’s Balata Belt operating in the large and
modern works of the Trufood Company of Australia, I<td.,
Melbourne. The size of the driving pulley is 12ft., and the size
of the driven pulley 43in. The speed of the driven pulley is
300 R.P.M. The horse-power being actually transmitted is 200,
although the arc of contact with the small pulley is approx. 110°
instead of 180° as recommended.
This big DICK’S BALATA BELT is standing up to reputation—delivering
maximum power 24 hours per day, at minimum cost. There are no belt
troubles, no costly breakdowns, and no losses through labor thrown idle.
The Engineer’s labors are lightened, the efficiency of the power plant
increased and steady output is ensured. Why not standardise on DICK’S

not so young to read gossip literature and
neglect history. An arbitrary selection of
“high minds” is the most futile business in
the world. The selector must necessarily
presume before he starts that his own mind
is high enough to measure the thing that is
greatest and best in mental altitude and
effort. Literary history holds too many ex-
amples of deposed gods to make any lasting
judgment possible. The disparagement of
all that does not fit in with individual tastes
and preconceived ideas must always be
vicious. A man of genius does not lose the
high mind which enabled him to give the
world so much because that mind fails to
conform to the shape of our own. Even if
we have a “terrific nobility” we can still
make mistakes.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
Samuel Butler, Satirist
The critical arrow-shafts directed by
Hilary Lofting through the Red Page are
in general shot with a shrewd archer’s wis-
dom. And they are not lacking in point.
But the judgment offered (22/3/'23) to the
effect that the “end” of Samuel Butler, of
“Erewhon,” “is justly the pen-y-box, despite
his technique and the little vogues that
come and go,” is clean off the target, much
less beside the mark. Butler’s was The real
regenerative voice, in dismal post-Victorian
London, of the far Antipodes. Only one man
of as great a mental calibre —Charles Dar-
win—has visited Australasia during the past
130 years.
Once in Maoriland, far up the Wanganui
River, I caught sight of the carved head
of a Maori tribal god, projecting on a tall
pillar, above the cemetery of a native pah.
On a river boat, filled with conventional
tourists, it chanced that I had Festing
Jones’s “Life of Samuel Butler” open upon
my knee. I gave one glance at the Maori
god, and then I turned to the frontispiece
portrait of Butler with joy. For the god
was Butler, and Butler was the god.
“What a hideous, abominable-looking thing,”
a lady tourist said as she looked at the
earven image. “Yes, madam,” I said, “that
is the portrait of Macaulay’s New Zealander.
His real name is Samuel Butler.” Nobody
has noticed the fact, but he has stared at
the intellectual ruins of London for the past
40 or 50 years.
Around' all such silent smashers, when
they are dead, it is the fashion for critics
to pose themselves with a would-be non-
chalance. It is so easy to explain in naif
a paragraph that they are of no account.
But presently, I predict, Samuel Butler,
like all other big guns, will make plain to
his real audience — i.e., the arriving British
generation—the fact that there are large
and earnest missiles inside his books. Especi-
ally in the “Note-Books” and in “Erewhon.”
Bernard Shaw himself is merely a sort of
first aid to the study of Butler. He (Shaw)
would be the first with all his so-called
egoism (in reality a sound and sane insist-
ence upon the value of himself, such as
George Humbert cultivates) to admit that.
Surely, then, when satirists of the ballistic
force of G.B.S. have been at pains to ex-
press their personal obligation to Butler, as
a source and an inspiration, so sanely useful
a writer as Mr. Lofting will be glad to have
due opportunity to revise a hasty judgment.
The statement, to begin with, that “Butler
hated everyone” is amazingly incorrect. No
true student of life and literature could will-
ingly let it stand. For it was Butler who,
on returning to. London from Maoriland,
carried a worthless but somewhat talented
ingrate—his name does not matter —to Eng-
land along with him, and there supported him
for years. Furthermore, a man who lived
upon such Pickwickian terms with Alfred,
Butler’s curious private secretary and gen-
eral factotum, cannot be dismissed offhand
as “a sour and an unpleasant person who
hated everyone.” In plain point of fact, the
relationship which existed for years between
Butler and Alfred was as comical as any-
thing that Dickens ever imagined. For in-
stance, all letters of invitation, asking Butler
to spend the week-end anywhere, were care-
fully smelt —not read —by the private sec-
retary. If the letters smelled of good
tobacco, Alfred would write upon them: “Sir,
I think you may safely go,” If not, Alfred
invariably forbade the visitative banns.
What, then, is the truth about this re-
doubtable philosopher, who confronted Lon-
don with the firm, barbaric insistence of a
Maori god? Simply this. Samuel Butler
saw with tremendous clearness that the
British Empire, as it stood during the 40
years 1860-1900 (he died in 1902), was but
so much crude scaffolding around the idea of
a possible complete modern civilisation, and
was not the Thing in Itself at all. He spat,
with violence, upon the family notion that
he should become anything so elaborately
futile as an Anglican archdeacon or arch-
bishop. And if he “hated his father and, the
ideas and emotions his father stood for,” as
Mr. Lofting says, it was simply because his
father, like his grandfather before him,
belonged to the pneumatic-buffer class. In
other words, they stood between the Vic-
torian swells and the iron facts of life. They
grew rich, as schoolmasters, by packing the
intellect of young landlord-dom with moss.
And Butler hated moss. Above all, he
hated that fraudulent kind of intellect —we
have seen some imported samples of it here
-—which believes that it has a divine right
to run the universe, because its mind-spaces
have been packed for centuries with Oxford’s
and Eton’s perfumed moss. Butler had
seen the real dimensions of the British
world, and the dominant smugs of his epoch
had not. Therefore he regarded them as
a lot of solemn fools and mandai’ins, stiffly
parading in a useless show.. And he did
not merely hate the contemptible futility, as
it seemed to him, of mid-Victorian religion;
he hated mid-Victorian science and most of
its assumptions as well. As he put it
tersely, the things that Athanasius asked the
world to swallow, centuries ago, are as no-
thing compared to the things that science
commands us to swallow every day. It is
curious to observe that popular English
novelists —Horace Annesley Vachell, to men-
tion one —are dropping their earlier line of
romantic tosh, and, in such studies as
“Whitewash,” are dissecting the dominant
smugs of rural England in a new Butlerian
vein.
Every nation has its strong points. Aus-
tralia’s strong point should be, and I trust
is a sincere moral and intellectual desire
to obtain a perfect understanding of the
outlook of such aggressive and sardonic re-
constructors as Shaw and Butler. For the
Australian himself is both sardonic and
aggressive, with no ballads of blue china
or other such filigree ware in his mental
composition. A bric-a-brac Cavendish-Chats-
worth Empire, run by the dominant smugs
of both hemispheres, in the sole interest of
dominant smugdom, ’does not appeal to him.
At the core, his tastes are Spartan. And the
straightforward intellectual cannibalism of
Butler, who ate other men’s opinions alive,
assimilated them if good, spat them out if
bad, exactly as the best Australian does,
seems to me to strike, quite as much as any
Gallipoli Landing, a world-reverberating
note. ’
That is the great point I insist, about
Butler. As savagely direct as Te Rau-
paraha of the Taranaki country, he main-
tains, in almost every word, and certainly
in everv paragraph a similingly earnest
U§Slp P *3T& (acts of life. So do
all the great writers. To a moss-grown
moss-stuffed British epoch, of course, which
made Martin Tapper the fashion, such a
man was anathema. All the loyal lick-
spittles of Fleet-street and its pseudo-
scientific equivalent had him “set.” No
good thing could come- out of ’ Butler;
“There is a good deal of the Queen [Vic-
torial lurkine- in everv Mrs Smith,” he
said, “anti, conversely,” if good deal of Mrs.
Smith lurking in every queen.” Remarks
of that kind, of however pungent a truth,
and repeated everywhere, did not make for
favorable notices of “Erewhon” ill the lit-
ernrv snnnlement of the London TIMES.
GRANT HERVERY.
What Should We Write About?
All or nearly all our novels have been
written about country life, one result of
which has been to strengthen the English
conviction that the people in these islands of
Australia and Maoriland spend their days
riding after sheep and cattle. Viewing the
matter as a Maorilahder, it seems to me
that it is time writers turned their atten-
tion to town life. The growth of the
small town from the one-store stage awaits
him who can handle its narrowness and
pride, its struggles for roads, railways and
bridges, its commercial faith and capacity,
the rise of its “society,” the strength and
weakness of its leading people, its frailties
and its heroisms. There is still more
material in the cities. Satire is overdone
in present-day fiction, but I fear there is
room for little but satire in delineations of
what passes for society in the women’s
columns of the papers. The “best circles”
have little or no culture and no traditions.
Money is the only thing that counts. These
circles contain plenty of material for com-
edies of manners, but Maoriland novelists
have been very weak in humor. Then there
are politics, with all their aspirations and
intrigues, their mixture of classes, their true
and sham democracy, where real life is so
often stranger than fiction —when are we
going to get these things dealt with
adequately in novels?
In attracting attention a novelist like Sin-
clair Lewis has a great advantage over Aus-
tralasian writers. It is not only that he
has a vastly greater public to cater for at
his door, but the-, conditions he writes about
are more arresting to the eye of the English
public. Life in American towns such as
he chooses presents a greater contrast with
English life than do our Australasian ways.
Patriotism is more blatant, worship of “pep”
and “zip” more naked and unashamed, than
with us. We do not wear our dollar hearts
on our sleeves so much as the Americans.
It will therefore be hard work to popularise
the Australasian novel of town life in the
big English market. However, you never
know; luck has a curious way of turning
up unexpectedly. The thing is to make the
attempt. For the rest, Australians have
much better prospects than we have in
Maoriland, in that Australia’s population is
four times ours. The local demand for a
Maoriland novel of the kind I have been con-
sidering wouldn’t keep the author in tobacco.
ALAN E. MULGAN.
“Is Formlessness Art?”
A note from Louis Esson: —
Mr. Eardley Turner has a refreshing innocence, a
rare quality in these days of critical complexities.
It appears (R.P. 12/4/’23) that he has no suspicion
that the common expression, the “well-made” play,
is a technical term that has been used by dramatic
critics for 40 years! He thinks the “well-made”
play is actually a well-made play, instead of a
definite piece of theatrical mechanism, like a typical
work of Scribe or Sardou. What is known to
everybody, except Mr. Turner, as the “well-made”
play is entirely a thing of the theatre, constructed
according to narrow arbitrary rules, obsolete some
generations ago, and with no relationship to life.
“Camille” and “Fedora,” for example, are types of
the “well-made” play. The modern dramatist de-
mands a much subtler and sterner form than served
the purpose of the older literary stage-carpenters,
who worked on a lifeless formula.
The greatest modern dramatists, like Strindberg,
Tchekhov, Synge or Francois de Curel, never wrote
“well-made” plays; but they were certainly not
lacking in the sense of form. And there is nothing
formless about the plays of young men like Sascha
Guitry or Eugene O’Neill, though there technique is
not that of Sutro or Pinero. The English play-
wrights of the bygone Victorian age were greatly
over-rated during their own time. Perhaps Pinero
was the best of a bad lot; but he means nothing to-
day. His influence on modern drama is negligible,
for his plays were not so very well-made, after all.
It is amusing, if rather baffling, that a mis-
understanding of a simple technical term, for which
1 am in no way responsible, should have produced
such a bewildering result as Mr. Turner’s remarks
about “form” and “technique” and “art that con-
ceals art” and “empty benches,” and, above all, the
“box-office:” All' the same, I believe I may justly
claim a small share of the deserved applause.
Art and Nationality
I think that Frank Morton (R.P.
5/4/’23) misses the most important
point, which is that anyone who sets out
deliberately to be national in his Art would
at once automatically set himself on the level
of the spruiker, or at best the missionary,
with neither of whose functions Art has any-
thing to do.
So far as literature is concerned, anything
worthy of the name produced in Australia
must bear upon it a strong imprint of the
society in which its creator has been reared,
of its speech, its habits, its gaiety, or its
dourness, its humanity or its indifference.
The artist, sensitive interpreter as he must
be of the life about him, must write of the
people and things that he knows, otherwise
he will probably play the sedulous ape to
some big name in Britain or America, when
his work will at once cease to have any
connection with literature. One can hardly
imagine a young Australian brought up in
Melbourne or in Sydney, and gifted with sin-
cerity and a strong desire to set forth his
own doctrine of life or love, or anything
else he may want to write about, setting the
scene of his projected novel in the East End
of London or in New York. Therefore I
take it that the important thing is to get the
literature. Its Australianism will look after
itself, once it has arrived; but no really fine
writer wijl ever be concerned with the expres-
sion of an Australian sentiment; nor, in
fact, with the expression of anything but
himself and his conception of life as he sees
it and lives it. If he self-consciously set out
to be the founder of an Australian school
of literature, Ms work would probably have
the spontaneity of a Poet Laureate’s ode on
a royal wedding-day, and would have about
an equal chance of living. He will be con-
cerned, not with boosting Australia, or run-
ning down other countries, but with giving the
world the truth as he sees it; and his coun-
try will probably be boosted or the reverse
according to its deserts, and according to
whether the perfectly sincere views of the
writer are colored rose or some darker shade.
For the rest, every thinking person must
agree with Mr. Mdrton. Art cannot flourish
alongside any narrow' sentiment of nation-
ality, nor any narrow sentiment of anything.
It can, and should, give to the world some
picture of the people and the country which
flourish or decay about the artist. Art can-
not be forced to run into any one channel,
as witness the sterility of that period of
French art when Napoleon I. gave himself a
watching brief over his artists and writers.
Its very essence must be that it is individual,
free, and never partial, and these things
do not go with strong national sentiment.
Let us not worry about our writers being
distinctively Australian. They will be suffi-
ciently so when they arrive; but for boosting
purposes it is better rto stick to the guide-
book writers.
R. F. GRAHAM.
A Satchel of Books
The Case for Spirit Photography . by Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle (Hutchinson). Herewith 110 pages
of “irrefutable” evidence regarding Doyle’s favorite
pastime. The whole effort makes one thank Heaven
that Sherlock Holmes wasn’t built in the likeness of
his creator.
The Mutineers, by Charles Boardman Hawes
(Heinemann). Pleasant U.S. sea-story of the Napo-
leonic period. There are pirates as well as mutineers,
and savages with a weakness for head-hunting; also
junks and chunks of gold. Remotely reminiscent of
Hawkins the cabin-boy, and of Kingston and Ballan-
tyne the brave.
The Cynic’s' Cyclopatdia,” by “Celt” (Hutchinson).
This earnest lexicographer of other people’s sayings
besides his own {vide his calm appropriation of the
old London Punch gag: “What is matter? Never
Mind”) cannot claim to be a descendant of La
Rochefoucauld. For one definition of the quality
of “Echo —the only thing that can cheat a woman
out of the last word,” you get 20 of such squibs
as “Dynamite—a mite that makes a mighty din,”
and “Crow —the only creature who always has caws
to talk.” As the author says somewhat pertinently
on page 100, “Mother Wit” is “the brand of sense
that mothers seem mostly to have kept to them-
selves.”
The Briary Bush, by Floyd Dell (Heinemann).
Further adventures, amatory and journalistic, of the
IJ.S. poet whose career was begun in “Moon-Calf.”
If the thing isn’t a best-seller it ought to be, for it
contains all the ingredients. On page 134, after
the wedding-night:—-
“Felix awoke with a sense of loneliness. The
vague consciousness which had remained with him
even in sleep of a beautiful and beloved body was
gone; and the hand that he reached out found no
warm and reassuring presence.”
On page 219 there is a musical comedy and
“Four dozen female legs; a kaleidoscope of calf
and ankle; two hundred pounds of arm and leg, bust
and buttock ; two hundred pounds of female meat.”
And, finally:—
“She undressed in the darkness. He saw her
emerge, white and slender and dripping with silver
moonlight, from the waves. She dried her body
miraculously on the tiny tea-towel.”
“She” is Mrs. Felix once more. What a thing it is
to be a U.S. pote!
The Outsider, by Maurice Samuel (Constable).
Mortimer Long, a youngster out of some U.S. middle
west Main-Street, got back into “civvies” in Paris,
and decided that , he; had adopted a new philosophy
of life. “There’s not a soul in Paris for whose
good opinion I’d spent ten cents, and there’s not a
soul here would spend the same sunt to save me
from damnation. That’s why I love the place.”
But the youngster made the fatal mistake of starting
to live his new creed without money, and his poverty
led him into associations which soon cured him. And
that’s the story, with poor little Carmen passing
in and out of it and paying in the end. A well-
constructed story written with a vivid pen and an
observant eye.
Pauline, by Baroness de Knoop (Allen and Unwin).
Pauline is a queer fish. With her hair still hanging
down her back she runs away from England to a
German aunt, and presently marries another queer
fish. Heaven and the Baroness only know what this
wealthy aristocrat hoped to make of her or what he
married her for: and, though she was “wife in name
only,” she apparently didn’t know that there was
anything unusual in their relations. However, the
queer male fish died, and then she had her chance ;
but she messed that too. And she was glad. “If
wife or husband forsake thee,” she is saying in the
last chapter, “they are but the swaddling clothes
thy soul has outgrown.” So “she stretched out her
arms, the palms of her hands, her fingers one by
one. She blessed Reginald.” (Reginald was the
last of the swaddling clothes.) Queer fish. Queer
book.
Number 87, by Harrington Hext (Thornton Butter-
worth). A yarn which should be immensely gratify-
ing to sub-editors of post-meridian papers. It begins
with the murder of an eminent author, and plunges
into luscious descriptions Of the removal of an
Italian poet-filibuster, a Japanese Elder statesman,
a British Prime Minister, a candidate for the U.S.
Presidency, and numerous assorted inventors, poli-
tical agents, Bolshevists and Labor leaders. Their
assassin assumes the shape of a gigantic bat, and,
when not making cold meat of celebrities, he destroys
the Albert Memorial and His Majesty’s Theatre, the
former because it is an offence to the soul, the latter
because it is the home of “Chu-Chin-Chow.” The
avenger has no use for “Chu-Chin-Chow.” There is
a mystery about the authorship as well as the story.
Wells might have written it in hjs third-best man-
ner, or Doyle in his second-best. And then there’s
Barrie. The first thing he wrote when he shifted
to London was “Better Dead,” being the proceedings
of the Society for Doing Without Some People. It
needed bringing up to date.

the other, to select one with the
trade mark Westclox on its dial
and tag.
That mark stands for an ideal
in clock making, of making
clocks that give satisfactory
service.
The trade mark Westclox is
put on the dial that you may
identify them easily. It is a
name we are proud of, as we are
proud of the clocks that wear it.
Westclox are made in a

SINGLE-SIX
TH E advent of the Packard Single-Six
into Australian Automotive History is
of such importance as to be epochal. The
Packard Single-Six has made a singular
revelation in the meaning of those phrases
■—"ease of control/ 5 "motor car comfort/ 5
"economic performance.”
The result of twenty-three years experience
and untiring experiment in motor-car con-
struction, the new Single-Six embodies
perfectly the ideal of
a quality car that is
light in weight, eco-
nomical to operate
and maintain, power-
ful, easy-riding and
moderately priced.
ħ
Endowed with a wealth of power from the
new Single-Six engine, it threads its way
swiftly and silently through the press of
traffic with never a need of changing gears
until a full halt is eminent.
It accelerates with quick sensitiveness. In
mounting speed it is capable of outreach-
ing any demands of modern driving, and
mile after mile, hour after hour, holds its
effortless pace.
Whether the trip be long
or short, whether the way
lead through open country
or through crowded street,
to ride in a Packard Single-
Six is to ride enjoyably, at
the peak of comfort, ease
and safety in a motor car.

The War Dead.
Draw down the misty curtains on the past,
Cover the graves with the rich autumn leaves,
Take up the censored story mem’ry weaves,
And what is half-forgot forget at last.
Not beautiful the voice of Murder’s blast,
Not beautiful the with’ring fire of Lust,
Nor fair the way that these returned to dust.
Out, out these ugly recollections cast,
And vision them in one great crystal tomb,
Between the blues of foreign sea and sky,
Where Silence reigns and there is no device
Man-made to shew they sprang from mortal
womb.
The gods may envy those who thus may lie,
Pillowed upon the breast of Sacrifice.

The Barred Way.
I want to go back again.
It seems an easy thing to do—
To walk the green mile of the glen,
And climb a little hill I knew.
A bird could fly there in an hour,
A child could stroll there in a day—
And I may never know the power
That holds my will and bars my way.
There’s just a little hill to climb,
And then —three poplars in a row
Hearts do not break a second time—
I wonder why I cannot go.

From a Little Window.
My little window, four by three,
Opes on to worlds of witchery.
I watch the clouds go riding by—
White sails athwart the windy sky;
And limned against the sunset fires,
Plump sparrows huddled on the wires.
Away where curves the sky’s blue cup,
Tliin-etchbd masts go dreaming up,
And drawn within the dusk’s dark nets
Frail cupolas, and minarets —
Sweet, fairy-fashioned shapes that soar,
Far from the window three by four!
And outward-winging whirl my dreams
Unto those walls, until it seems
Only the empty husk of me
Waits at the window four by three!

Perhaps We’ll Meet.
The journey over now ? The white way
ended?
And it so fair!
A path we thought for ever onward wended —
And are we there?
And shall good-bye, a last good-bye, be taken.
The milestone passed?
But, ah! Your voice can only just now
waken
My heart at last!
I had so much to tell you ! But our laughter,
Our careless song,
Saw it put off until the moment after —
The way seemed long.
My house is there, I think, with lanterns
burning;
But you turn in
To this dark gate, and there is no returning—
No more to win.
The day is laid to sleep among the lilies
Where late moths slept,
And the soft mists are creeping down the
valleys
And night has swept
Insensibly upon us through our dreaming—
So long before
Us lay our path at dawn, and now ’tis
seeming
The day is o’er.
We were to search among the pleasant
meadows
For a rare flower;
I had a dream to tell you—-but the shadows
Engulf the hour,
And ’tis too late ! For Time skims like a
swallow
Down the pale sky.
And you are going where I may not follow.
Dearest, good-bye!
Oh. love, good-bye. I see the last light glimmer
On eyes and hair.
The last swift smile —and then the roads
grown dimmer.
The green ways bare.
You said, “Perhaps we’ll meet —a happier
meeting;
One never knows.”
The banal words upon my heart are beating
That weary grows.
I stoop to gather poppies that, half-fading,
Round the gate twine,
And rise to find within the night’s deep
shading
No light of mine.
I cannot find my house. The flower is
falling,
The dream untold.
And other voices down strange skies are
calling,
And memory’s cold.
But. ah. mv heart still in the silence crying
By this dark gate!
The long-dumb dream still warmly by it
lying—*
Ah, dearest, wait!
Perhaps we’ll meet! I will return and falter
With the last breath
To this same place and find—for who can
alter? —
The Gate of Death !

capacity, the Plant automatically
switches on to take the extra load.
The Battery is therefore fully pro-
tected, and lasts for many years.
Whenever power is required, such
as Electric Iron, Motor Pump, etc.,
the Plant switches itself on, and
gives current direct—not through

The Plant requires attention only

An Owner’s Appreciation.
The following extract from a letter of a
“Matthews” owner is typical of many we
have received:—
“Majorca, Vic.
“I have had no trouble whatever with the
‘Matthews’ Plant. I would not be without it
if it cost twice the money. Anyone could use
it, as it runs itself, and there is always plenty
of current available. The Plant costs less to
run than ordinary kerosene lamps.”

REPARATIONS AND THE RUHR.
“France insists that the bird which the Allies
brought down is her bird, and that she and she alone
is entitled to pluck it. As long as this spirit lasts
the hope of any settlement in Europe is remote, and
the longer it remains unsettled the greater the danger
to the world’s peace.” —Sydney Telegraph.
It is such half-truths that have earned us
the reputation of being a nation of hum-
bugs. France has never claimed that she
alone is entitled to pluck Germany. She
acquiesced cordially when Australia seized
the valuable handful of feathers represented
by the German colonies in the Pacific. The
French complaints are that Britain and
the United States agreed to a reparations
bill of £6,500,000,000, payments to be spread
over a couple of decades, that Germany has
defaulted, and that Britain and the U.S.
have refused either to put the screw on the
debtor or to agree to a defensive alliance
against German aggression in the interests
of French security. Germany has had two
far-sighted statesmen since the end of the
war. They realised, apparently, that if dis-
membered France could hnd £200,000,000
in a couple of years half a century ago,
modern Germany, with its 60,000,000 inhabi-
tants, its wonderful wealth of coal and iron
and its great industrial plants, could well
pay its war-indemnity in 42 years. They
realised further, we may be sure, that the
paying of the indemnity in the only way
most of it could be paid— i.e., in goods—•
would give Germany back at the end of a
generation that world-supremacy in com-
merce which it was fast achieving when it
allowed itself to be betrayed by its militar-
ists into attacking France. Forty, or, for
that matter, 20, years of intensive produc-
tion on the part of a nation of 60,000,000
skilled whites working at low wage-rates
would be likely to put the nations that won
the war out of the running as industrial
Powers. Rathenau saw this, advocated the
payment of reparations as required under
the London Agreement, was met by oppo-
sition similar to that which Thiers so
quickly overcame in 1871, and was eventu-
ally assassinated in the name of German
patriotism. Chancellor Wirtii also con-
sidered that Germany should honor its bond;
he survived till the end of last year, when
Herr Stinnes, finding that the Government
hostility to the selfish policy of himself and
his fellow magnates was getting too pro-
nounced, split the Wirtii Cabinet and put
the Government out of office.
* * * *
There is no reason to doubt or to deny
that the French Government is well satisfied
privately with the turn events have taken —•
as satisfied as Bismarck would have been
if the French had failed to meet an instal-
ment of their indemnity 50_years ago. The
prompt payment of France’s 200 millions
sterling affected Germany as disastrously as
the acquisition of most of the world’s gold
threatens now to affect the U.S.A. Nothing
would have horrified French economists
more, probably, than the spectacle of the
Germans settling down to work, to tax them-
selves, to borrow (which would have been
an easy matter had they addressed them-
selves seriously to the other two duties)
and to pay. However, oversmart, as always,
the Germans decided on a bilking policy, and
whatever moral force there is in the wild-
beast business of international politics has
swung to the side of the French. French
Governments are rarely stable, even during
war-time, but the present Government has
practically the whole nation behind it. The
French were obviously wearying of militar-
ism before the war; the idiotic German
policy of evasion and equivocation on the
reparations question has given it a new lease
of life. While Lord Haig, in Britain, is a
disregarded voice complaining feebly about
starving ex-soldiers, Foch, in France, is a
national hero and a centre of the keenest
political interest. And for this revival of
the French war-spirit the fool-Germans are
to blame, though part of the guilt must, of
course, be distributed amongst those organs
of public opinion in the United Kingdom and
America—and in Australia—which have en-
couraged them in their refractoriness. The
first aim of every nation is security. It has
been an obsession with the French ever since
the Germans emerged from the tribal stage.
Napoleon was aiming at it when he made
Jerome king of Westphalia, and Louis
Napoleon when he maintained the army
which was supposed to be equipped “to
the last button.” France is safe while she
remains in the Ruhr, and Germany having
given her an excellent excuse to go there, it
is highly unlikely that she will get out in a
hurry. And Britishers, like ourselves, should
be the last to ask her to retire on moral
grounds. Britain remained in Ireland for
seven centuries, for the same reason alleg-
edly that the French are in the Ruhr —to
S'.ve herself security. The British held
gypt for 40 years on strategic grounds, and
there is no likelihood that they will ever
relinquish control of the Canal zone. When
the war ended the Arabs of Mesopotamia
were promised self-determination. Six
months later there was a garrison of 70,000
troops on the Mosul frontier, “for the pro-
tection of India” —of India whose landward
borders consist of mountains which, except
in the case of a few passes in the north-
west, have defeated every invader in history.
We are in Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore and
a hundred other places because it is essential
to the security of the Empire that we should
be there. There is no sum of money that
could buy the Empire out of them while sea-
power exists as a factor in the safety of
nations. The Germans had their chance to
save the left bank of the Rhine, and to
gather themselves for a fresh spring at
France in half a century’s time or less.
They tried to have it both ways—to pretend
poverty as a means of evading the payment
of their reparations bill, and to appeal to
the world’s conscience as a means of avert-
ing a French occupation—and they failed.
What cause has the British Empire to side
with them?
* * * •
It may be lamentable, but it is true, that
there is no morality in international affairs.
One of the most frightful calamities that can
befall a nation is to find itself, in its hour
of trouble, in the hands of a man of delicate
scruples. Gladstone bequeathed Britain the
second South African War because he was
that kind of man. The device known as the
Balance of Power was one of the world’s
many recognitions of the fact. The notion
here was to align the Powers in such a way
that they would be afraid to go to war—
not afraid of the wrath of Heaven, but of
being beaten and ruined. The Balance
played the part of an efficient policeman
until some Power became strong enough to
believe that with luck it might defy the
law and fill its pockets. So that, at best,
the old arrangement was no more than a
race which had to end some day in war, if
not world-war. The Balance has gone,
and the apparent fate of Western Europe
is to be dominated by either French or Ger-
man interests. It is futile as well as hypo-
critical to indulge in fine moral gestures on
the matter, for we know that the nations
concerned are not going to let ethics enter
into it, and neither would the British if they
were in a similar position. If Germany can
get the mastery in the next half-century—
and if the French leave the Ruhr Germany
doubtless will get the mastery—then France
will be destroyed. And it is because the
French know this that they are likely to
stay on the Rhine until convinced that it is
completely safe to abandon it. It may be
in the immediate interests of the British
Empire that France should leave the Ruhr,
just as it is in the immediate interests of
men like Stinnes that Germany should
leave them untaxed and dodge its repara-
tion payments. But if the long view is taken
it must be clear that, whereas the domination
of Europe by France could not affect the
Empire prejudicially in many directions, a
German dictatorship would mean , its speedy
ruin. The Germans are the English of the
Continent. They are traders, shipowners
and colonists. It will be gratifying -to Ger-
many to run over France to occupy the.
Channel ports and reduce the hereditary
enemy to the status of Holland. But the
object at the back of it all—as during the
World War —will be the acquisition of the
British Empire’s places in the sun; and more
particularly Australia, and the former Ger-
man colonies which Australia holds. Let
our papers and their anonymous correspon-
dents be as self-righteous as they please,
but there are other ways surely of assuming
the pose than that of calling on France to
lay her heart bare to the sword-thrust of
an unrepentant foe. Journals like the Tele-
graph might, for example, request the
U.S.A. to guarantee the French against Ger-
man reprisals; to provide America’s late
allies with that “full security” which Pre-
sident Wilson promised would accompany
an adequate indemnity before the fallen Hun
was allowed by a scandalised world to get
up again.
MY LORD HAS A PLAN.
Sydney is more concerned about the housing
of its workers than other Australian cities,
for various reasons. It is the biggest of the
group. Much of its environs are water, and
water can’t be conveniently built upon, so
many of its suburbs are necessarily far away.
.And with neither tube railways for the city
and suburbs, ground-level lines through the
city, harbor bridges nor wide, straight
streets, the problem of getting to and from
these suburbs is difficult. In a population
sense Sydney is pushing on. The city, which,
of course, is quite a small municipality
(3327 acres), had 31 inhabitants to the acre
two years ago. Glasgow, which is rightly
viewed in Britain as a horrible example, has
54 to the acre. The County of London, with
60 to the acre, is worse. But old and dis-
respected English municipalities like Leeds,
Sheffield and Hull are actually less densely
populated than the N. S. Wales capital city.
It all the wide-stretching suburbs are counted
in as far away as Ryde, Eastwood, Home-
bush, Strathfield, Manly and Ilurstville, the
average is good enough humans per
acre), but these places don’t solve the work-
ing-man’s housing problem. That problem
is located closer in, where some remarkable
records are to be found. Here are eight of
them: —
Population per Acre.
Darlington .. 83 Erskineville .. 45
Paddington .. 65 Glebe .. • . 44
Newtown .. ... 64 Annandale . . .. 35
Redfern .. .. 55 Balmain .. .. 34
Four cases are worse than that of Glasgow,
Scotland’s ancient bad example. Three are
worse than London, taken as a whole.
Scotland had 160 people to the sq. mile
on census-day two years ago, while Eng-
land (apart from Wales) had 701,
beating the “teeming millions” of Japan
by well oyer two to one. In such
countries dreadful cases of congestion are
inevitable here and there. But N. S. Wales,
with seven persons to the mile instead of
701, has no overcrowding except what it
deliberately makes and cultivates and is
proud of. * There is every reason to believe
that the block represented by the eight muni-
cipalities mentioned, along with the city
proper, has got into a worse state since
census day, and that every individual mem-
ber of it is worse, save possibly the city
itself, for it is calculated that the metropoli-
tan area holds 100,000 more inhabitants than
it did two years back. The case being obvi-
ously serious, it was pleasing to read the
other day that his Lordship the Mayor has
an idea for dealing with it. That is what
his Lordship is for-r-to have ideas.
Man not being a bird, the housing problem
is simnlv that of arranging that the worker
may live close to his employment. If he
spends an hour per day going to and fro
it is a drag on the family finances, and adds
about 12i per cent, to the working day.
When a city area is so broken up by Nature
as Sydney’s, the position is several times
more difficult than in one like Melbourne.
When it is the wonderful State policy to
drive or cajole every industry, save such as
forestry or mining, to the city, and to penal-
ise them through the railway system if they
don’t come, the problem intensifies every
year. In 1896 Sydpey and its near-by
suburbs had to provide accommodation for
8330 more workers and their families than
all the rest of the State had to provide for.
In 1921 the city and its more or less whole-
some adjuncts, such as Darlington, Padding-
ton and Newtown, had to find house-room,
also factory- and warehouse- and shop-
room, for 64,093 more than were accommo-
dated in all the rest of the State. Australia
must become more and more of an industrial
country, because the gold era has faded, and
the land-sale time has apparently seen its
best days and the loan business must
slacken off, and the beef industry is under
a cloud, and wheat-growing becomes less
satisfactory as it is carried further inland.
And when over five-sevenths of the industrial
workers of an important State, and over one-
fourth of those of a whole continent and
some islands (386,639), are put into Darling-
ton and its environs, a certain stuffiness must
be allowed for. As the process is being accel-
erated much more must be allowed for.
Whole counties have been partly depopu-
lated to feed the pride of Darlington and to
swell the pomp of Paddington, and curious
results ensue. The other day a grazier at
Walgett sent a lot of cattle to Sydney be-
cause there was no industrial town nearer
that was in need of his beef. He realised
9d. per bullock, because Sydney was so far
away that expenses ate up everything else.
Taking one thing with another, his Lord-
ship was none too soon with his inspiration.
In the worst corners of some Old World
cities people long ago began to deal with
the problem of keeping millions of workers
and their work adjacent. They built ten-
ement houses four or more storeys high.
There is a common stair. Sometimes the
only illumination is the common skylight at
the extreme top. On each common landing
doors open even to the number of six. Each
gives access to a happy home of one apart-
ment or two. The number of persons that
can fit into one home is indefinite. In very
bad cases sanitary arrangements are repre-
sented by a legend that something exists in
the basement —further details are left to the
imagination. Washing is done indoors. The
most ennobling influence in the place is that
of the policeman, who insists that each
housewife shall take her turn at washing
the common stair. These great works repre-
sent the climax of an effort to put a bound-
less supply of factories in one place, and
let every toiler live an ideal existence Tight
alongside his factory. No Australian city
has formally adopted the tenement-house
institution yet, but Sydney, by weird and
wonderful adaptations of the baser sort ot
terrace property, is fast learning the ten*
ement-house habit. Therefore, as already
mentioned, his Lordship’s proposal is timely.
It would be unseemly if, through careless-
ness or haste, these comments ended with=
out mentioning what his Lordship is really
up to. According to the daily paper report,
he proposes that the corporation should re-
sume” property at Pyrmont, and replace
whatever is there now by 20 or 30 two-
storeyed dwelling places. He even goes So
far as to suggest that something similar
might be done in Woolloomooloo. The popu-
lation of Glasgow, the Scotch bad example,
increased by 25,582 between 1911 and 1921,
apart from what it gained by annexing adja-
cent municipalities. Greater Sydney added
258,360 to its quota in the same time. So
perhaps it wouldn’t be amiss if his Lordship
built a couple of extra houses. Only some
bold policy like that will meet what vague
people call the evils of congestion, and satisfy
them to leave all the other possible centres
of population in the State crowded with
tneir average of seven to the square mile.
QUEENSLAND AND ITS PREMIER.
Randolph Bedford in defence of his friends:
For reasons of long-lived and still robust senti-
ment 1 am sorry to hear Tub Bulletin joining: a
chorus of such wretched voices as the S. M. Herald,
the Argus and their smaller political imitators.
These roar of the depreciation of State station values
as if the beef-raising business was not in a bad
condition everywhere; of the proxy vote, necessary
because the chivalrous Opposition refused pairs to
Government men who were critically ill; of work-
men’s compensation as a State monopoly that cut
premiums and doubled benefits. They compare Queens-
land railway finance with that of pocket-hand-
kerchief Victoria, careless that Queensland is paying
the establishment expenses of decentralisation with
trunk railways, tying 10 ports to the back country
and maintaining a railroad track-mileage many times
greater in proportion to the population than any
other country. They object to the legislation to
make foreign pastoral companies pay the same rental
as the small Australian grazier who thinks Queens-
land good enough to live in, calling it the Repudia-
tion Act when it merely repudiates the Repudiation
Act passed by a squatter Government in 1905. They
roar generally of Bolshevism and the Red objective,
of disloyalty, and of the Pope that George V. is
about to visit. The Bulletin used to be above
these miserable attempts at vote-frightening.
In The Bulletin of 29/3/’23 there is a par. stat-
ing that “it is moodily suspected in Queensland that
the real reason why the Labor Government is speed-
ing to the country six weeks before its time” is
because loan moneys are exhausted. “De Gauis’b
heart-breaking experience with American financiers ’
is cited; but in New York it is common talk that
He Garis had only the name of McLellan and Co.
to use, and that the alleged American bonds were
to be sold in Australia. Even the greenest jealousy
might recognise the difference between the State of
Queensland and Kendenup. In New York Queens-
land bonds are among the gilt-edged stocks of Ameri-
can finance, and offers of more American
money are being made to the State every week
—and turned down. Anci in Victoria, where the
Argus is alleged to have a circulation, there is such
a demand for Queensland Treasury bonds that in
the last two months a million and a quarter’s wort!
have been sold over the counter.
In The Bulletin of 19/4/’23 Queensland is stylec
“The Land of Bottomless Pit Finance,” and one of
Theodore’s reasons for rushing to the country
styled the “Loafer/ Paradise Act” ; and the fact
that workmen are to pay threepence a week for un-
employment insurance is alleged to be filling them
with bitterness. This is merely stupid.
In the same Bulletin “the cattle industry is on
its last legs,” and one reason for Queensland’s parti-
cipation in the slump is that “Theodore’s Govern-
ment, thinking the pastoral tenant an unfailing source
of wealth, pursued him with increased rents, fines,
confiscations, etc.” The facts are that, before that
which the crazy chorus calls the Repudiation Act,
foreign pastoral companies were paying a halfpenny
an acre for land of the same class that good Aus-
tralians were paying threepence an acre for, and the
Repudiation Act gave pastoral rentals a common
level. Also, the statement that “Australian beef
has degenerated until it is no class” is sought to
be chargeable to anything but the real reason, sup-
posing the statement to be true. If it is true, it
is merely a matter of introducing new strains of
enthusiastic bulls. Yet The Bulletin says: “A. W.
Pearse says that too much of the livestock has to
travel to its doom on Theodore’s trains. They are
slow, bumpy, degenerate and ill-managed, like so
many other things in the North, and are calculated
to bruise even pig-iron.” Further, mutton export
shows an increase mostly “because sheep are not a
Queensland specialty like cattle; hence Theodore's
trains haven’t a chance to do them so much damage.”
This is all so silly as to appear the work of an ill-
tempered child. The railway transport of cattle is
everywhere a criminal waste and a costly and damn-
able cruelty; but the idea of the paragraphist is
that because mutton and lamb export increases sheep
don’t travel by Theodore’s bumpy trains —they
either fly or wireless themselves to the shambles.
Another Bulletin makes misleading comparisons
of two non-comparable States —Queensland and South
Australia, where “Black Australia” Barwell reigns.
The alleged comparisons can be made more dis-
advantageous for Queensland if Barwell stays in
power long enough to realise his ideal of cheap
colored labor.
There is no secrecy as to the reason for the
Queensland Government going to the country before
its time. With a majority of one, and an epidemic
of influenza laying aside Government men, the proxy
vote was necessary. With the programme ahead of
it and which it will perform in the next Parliament,
a new mandate is necessary, and that will be forth-
coming. Queensland anti-Labor men say to me:
“We haven’t a chance this election, and we don’t
deserve to have one.” They see the impossible
Vowles —a village solicitor and farmer-of-costs —
leading an alleged Country party; another section
that humorously styles itself the United party, and
smaller factions —all without any policy but abuse
of the Government. In that they follow the lead
of their newspaper barrackers; and the chorus men-
tions anything as provocative reasons for the elec-
tion but one—the Bribery Case. So little do they
think of bribery that some Queensland newspapers
permit Sleeman, the insurance company canvasser
who served three months (a fine of £5OO being also
paid by or for him), to “justify” the bribery by
charging the Government with being “rapacious.y
capitalistic,” and by challenging a Labor member
to “debate the bribery charge,” although it has
already been debated by a jury whose verdict was f.


tine of £5OO and three months in St. Helena, it
is all too ridiculous.
The present Queensland Government will return to
power. Then,’ probably, the chorus will charge the
majority of Queensland electors with Bolshevism,
disloyalty anil insanity. i hope The Bulletin
won’t even think it.
• * * *
To which the author of the term “Bottom-
less Pit Finance” appends a footnote: —
There is not very much of a definite sort to reply
to in Mr. Bedford's mass of incoherencies. What
he merely asserts is mostly wrong. Beef-raising- isn’t
in such “a bad condition everywhere” that Argentine
meat can’t command fair prices—far higher than
the Queensland article. And it is “merely stupid”
to say that Queensland “is maintaining a railroad
track mileage many times greater in proportion to
population than any other country.” Westralia, not
counting the Federal line within its borders, licks
Theodore’s State badly. Also, the reason why the
Queensland system is the most rottenly money-
losing State system in the Commonwealth, and one
of the worst out of it, is not that the State “is paying
the establishment expenses of decentralisation,” or
any other complicated and irrelevant agglomeration
of polysyllables. Despite all the long words in the
bright lexicon of youth, Queensland’s was the best-
paying system the Commonwealth could show in
1915, but then the fools or knaves for whom Mr. Bed-
ford holds a brief got command of it and promptly
made it what it is. Even Mr. Bedford doesn’t say
that the Repudiation Act wasn’t a Repudiation Act.
He only describes the people robbed as “foreign.”
They weren’t nearly all foreign, and it is a mean
trick to rob even a foreigner. As to the snarl about
Vowi.es being “a village solicitor,” 1 suppose that
isn’t much worse than being the keeper Of a
two-up school or a company promoter.
But it is in regard to what he leaves out that
Mr. Bedford is really interesting. If he could haviri
pointed to one single detail in which The Bulletin’s;
•‘misleading comparisons” between Queensland; the
richest of the States by nature, and South Australia,
the poorest, were misleading I presume he would
have done so for the sake of his own credit. To
make sweeping statements and not adduce one scin-
tilla of evidence is like the work of a very bad-
tempered infant.
Some of the points that any apologist for Theo-
dore, the man who does so much for the worker,
should tackle are these:—
Under his Government the best-paying railway
system in the Commonwealth became the worst.
The average pay of the Queensland factory worker
was less, by the figures in the latest Commonwealth
Year Book, than that in S.A., Victoria or N.S.W.;
also the Q. worker’s share out of each £lOO of
“value added in process of manufacture” was the
smallest in, the six States, likewise his share of the
gross value of factory output.
Riverless, much less populous, and, by comparison,
diminutive South Aus. beats Queensland badly for
savings bank deposits per inhabitant (and Q. is
also behind N.S.W. and t ic. and behind the Com-
monwealth average). South Aus. has less debt, also
less debt per head, and more than three times as
much sinking, fund, and its railways yield over four
times as much return as Queensland’s now do on capi-
tal. Further, the 503,000 people in S. Australia pay
to the Federal, Government more than 770,000 in
Theodore’s State do in the shape of (1) probate-tax,
(2) income-tax, (.3) war-profits ,ax, (4) land-tax,
and (5) post-office profits. As these are uniform
taxes the inference is that 500,000 people without
Theodore are richer than 770,000 with that incubus.
But Q. beat S.A. in these things:—
It had a bigger debt both gross and per head; a
bigger deficit; a bigger (by 233 per cent.) loan
expenditure (figures for 1921) ; bigger State taxes
(the biggest per head in the Commonwealth) ; and
five times as much land revenue. Theodore and Co.
ran up their land rentals from £686,086 in the
year before they took office to £1,217,303 in 1921
(that was the “repudiation”), and still it didn’t
prevent deficits. And despite all laments about con-
spiracies to stop loans they managed to add more per
head to the debt in the same period than S.A., Vic-
toria or N.S.W. That didn’t prevent deficits either.
Finally, TiiEonOßE’s State had, for the last quarter
of 1922, the biggest percentage of unemployed union-
ists, based on the union reports, in the Common-
wealth, while S.A. had the fewest.
As to all these matters there are official figures.
Mr. Bedford doesn’t touch any of them. He is wise.
THE AUSTRALIAN ABROAD.
Frankly, South Africans, among whom I
have lived for nearly 20 years, do not
like Australians in the mass. Perhaps that
would not matter very much if it did not
.suggest that there is a certain element of
dislike or distrust over a far wider field —
that, in short, certain people express their
dislike openly in South Africa, whereas else-
where they suppress or more or less dis-
guise it. For in South Africa there is
a special encouragement to express dislike
of Australia. Australia’s “intrusion” in the
Boer War started the trouble. That irrita-
tion, however, did not last: it died long ago.
A far worse crime, the memory of which has
never died, was the refusal of Australians
to salute Imperial officers. Not the Boer,
but the British officer first classified the
Australian as scum. He started the libel,
and the libel has not been laid to this day.
To clinch the matter the Standard Bar
affair occurred, and various other little in-
cidents of a similar nature helped to confirm
the verdict given by the British officer.
-According to. popular report, the bar was
smashed up simply because Australians were
scum, and it is just what they would natu-
rally do. In truth, reflection had been cast
upon us. Now, Australians are aggressively
patriotic. Nobody must say anything wrong
of us. So there was trouble. There always
is trouble in such circumstances. When the
patriotic Australian is expected to listen to
his country being insulted he finds it much
easier to hit than talk. And the bruised
individual goes off and helps to spread the
bad word.
If you look at German comic pictures you
will see the Englishman caricatured as a
big-toothed individual in a bizarre check
Knickerbocker suit and wearing a tweed cap.
I rom things I have heard about the Aus-
tralian I have fashioned a companion pic-
ture of him. He is a big, sinewy fellow
with rough hair, unshaven chin, a grim
mouth and bloodshot eyes. He does not
wear a collar or tie, but leaves his shirt open
oown to the belt, and doesn’t lace his boots.
He walks along pavements and shoulders
people out. of the way, and if they look at
him lie is liable to knock them down. He
isn’t afraid of policemen; in fact, he often
tics a policeman in a knot, and leaves him
lying about simply because he represents law
and order. When the Australian gets into a
tram he naturally refuses to pay his fare.
He has been known to cross the street to
knock an unoffending stranger down because
he was looking at a pair of socks in a
window. He has also been known to strip
a pretty girl naked in the street. If he is
invited to afternoon tea he gets drunk on
whisky and smashes the crockery. Respec-
table ladies invite him to their houses, and
he sets fire to their window-curtains.
That is what the Australian looks like to
a lot of people in South Africa. And, to
make the thing more irritating, the people
who live in South Africa are, in the main,
themselves beautiful characters. There cer-
tainly isn’t a person in the length and
breadth of the land who doesn’t wear a
halo when you mention the bad Australian.
The South African press must bear its
share of blame. Every chance it gets to put
Australians in an unfavorable light it takes.
Every time an Australian gets into trouble
the fact is chronicled in headlines. Nothing
that ever occurs in Australia is put in a
good light. Without exactly stating the
matter in print, it leaves the impression that
the popular impression is correct. Nor are
those from whom the Australian reports
come quite blameless. Many a month passes
before we Australians who live abroad see
a press cable-message from Australia that
really makes us glad. Of the other sort
there are too many.
But you must not think that the Austra-
lian abroad, and in South Africa in parti-
cular, is continually being insulted. Indi-
vidually the Australian is known to be a
good and efficient worker, a decent fellow
and a good citizen. And, in apy case, the
and the sneers don’t come from all
quarters. In Africa I have never met an
Irishman, a Scotchman, a Jew —yes, even a
Dutchman —who has flung my country in my
face. It is not pleasant to have to say that
they have always been the English and Welsh,
or the descendants of the English and Welsh,
who have so belittled and begrimed us. And,
again, only the English and Welsh middle-
classes.
I do not like to fasten this offence on one
section of the British, but J must. Recently
I stayed at the Grand Hotel in Ladybrand,
Orange Free State. With me there was a
well-to-do Englishman on a tour through
South Africa. He was not only a conqueror;
he was an educator. At our first dinner
the only thing he praised was the cheese.
He was surprised to see such good
cheese in South Africa. “Yes,” I
said; “it is an Australian cheese.” “I
didn’t know Australia could make cheese
like that,” he said. I was proud enough of
my Australia to talk about other things it
w r as doing. “You surprise me,” he said. “I
did not know a people like the Australians
could do anything well.” Then he started
to prove to me that Australians were as bad
as be represented them to be. He even knew
about the “Six Hatters.”
A little later I met another Englishman,
an Oxford man. He first made an advance
of friendship to me simply because I am an
Australian. He had lived some years in
Sydney, and he liked Australians so much
that he w r ent out of his way to meet them.
“I’ve never met an Australian yet that I
did not like,” he told me.
What is the matter with the other Eng-
lishmen? Is it that they resent our common
attitude of self-reliance? There certainly is
a type which only wants “dependencies”;
and that we have ceased to be dependencies
constitutes a grievance. Unfortunately, even
our attitude is wholly misjudged. >Ve are
thought to be truculent towards England.
You may have noted that my Ladybrand
man remembered the Six Hatters. Did we
not then hold up and deny admittance to
half-a-dozen honest English artisans? The
old lie still serves, .long after its originator
has gone to his rest.
But these Englishmen can be cured. An
English hotelkeeper came up to me on a
platform recently. “I owe you an apology,
Mr. Brothers,” he said. “You owe me an
apology?” I exclaimed. “Oh, you don’t re-
member,” he laughed; and reminded me of
some remarks he had once made about Aus-
tralia. “But I know better now,” he said;
“I’ve been there since then.”
The Commonwealth Government should
interest itself more than it does in this
matter. Our reputation means something
even commercially and financially. That
there is no propaganda in Australia’s favor
is due, I apprehend, to our foolish refusal
to recognise that there is this uninformed
prejudice against us.
ROBERT BROTHERS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Theodore Facing the Storm.
From a land of lost opportunities:—
In the face of all Australian experience the
crowd that has run Queensland since 1915 expects
to win the election on May 12, and that by a
strengthened majority. During eight crowded years
of inglorious life it has increased the public debt,
from £BO to £lO9 per head, the annual interest bill
from £1,975,000 to £3,286,000, and the taxes from
£1 Bs. 2d. per head per annum to £4 19s. 9d.
Also, it has converted what used to be
a payable railway system into one which
has accumulated a deficit of £7,177,000 in
five years, and in which the return on
capital invested (portion of the money having been
borrowed at 6 and 7 p.c.) has got down to 11s. lid.
p.c. But, remarkable 'as it seems, the Government
has persuaded itself that the electors will ignore
these facts and others of the same nature, such as
the £ 500 per day paid in outdoor relief and the
mint of money sunk in State mines, fishing-boats,
stores, pubs, treatment works and cattle-stations, the
last of which have been run at an admitted loss of
£400,000. Theodore talks of having six seats
to the good, instead of two. Coyne, the Lands
Minister, predicts a majority of 10.
A point in Labor’s favor is that its opponents are
divided into two camps, But it enjoyed the same
advantage in the Federal sphere on December 16, in
spite of which it won only two of the 10 Queensland
seats in the House of Reps, and was beaten out of
sight for the Senate. Moreover, the feeling between
the Commonwealth Nationalists and Cockies didn’t
prevent them from coming together as soon as the
election returns were in and forming a Ministry that
looks likely to last. True, contingent voting was
obligatory in December and will be optional next
week, but the only electorates in which the Labor
man has a chance of scraping home as the represen-
tative of a minority because the other candidates
refused to exchange preferences are Port Curtis
and Murrumba. And in the latter case his prospects
are not bright.
Port Curtis, however, is a seat that it will be
hard for the Opposition to hold. Fletcher's
majority in 1920 was only 204 —this in a poll of
4110 effective votes —and since then he has offended
the Cookies by oscillating between them and the
Nationalists (or United party, as they now call
themselves) ; what is more, there are 700 or 800
new voters, introduced into the electorate by the
Government’s “vigorous” public works policy, to
be reckoned with. Mindful of its being election
year the mob in office has surpassed its worst record
in the way of calculated extravagance. With
£4,501,000 available in the loan fund on June 30,
Theodore budgeted for an expenditure of
£4,929,000, borrowed at 6 p.c. or thereabouts (it
means an addition to the public indebtedness of
£6 ss. per head in one year), and he has played
It up royally. Having secured another million from
the loathsome capitalist he has been promising all
manner of things against the day of wrath—another
bonus on beef; a halfpenny per pound more for
second-grade cotton; a two-thirds subsidy for a pros-
pecting shaft, estimated to cost £20,000, iri
Charters Towers, one of the doubtful electorates;
£25,000 wiped off the interest owing by soldier-
settlers ; and so forth. Still, it is one thing to go
after votes in this high-minded fashion and another
thing to get them. Inducements still more lavish
were offered by Dooley and McGirr in N. S.
Wales last year, and everyone knows what happened
to them. Moreover, the very same influences that
encompassed the destruction of Dooleyism—healthy
influences, some of them, such as the revolt against
bossism and over-taxation; others unhealthy, even
poisonous—are working against Theodore and his
crowd.
In 1920 the Government w’ent to the country with
a majority of 20 and returned with a majority of
four. It was actually in a minority of 20,000 votes,
and was only saved from obliteration by inflated
rolls and the then iniquitous arrangement of seats,
which was so rottenly undemocratic that one Oppo-
sition member — Barnes, of Bulimba —had as many
electors in his division as five Labor members.
There has since been a redistribution, and after the
manner of redistributions it hasn’t hurt the party
in power. Instead of Labor pocket-boroughs like
Burke (2220 electors) and Chillagoe (2238 electors)
being erased from the list, that fate was reserved for
Pittsworth (4449 electors) and Drayton (4786 elec-
tors), both represented by Country-party men. Mus-
grave (4011 electors), another safe C.P. seat, has
also gone; and a strongly Nationalist subdivision
has been cut out of Townsville (Green, deputy-leader
of the United party, sits for Townsville) and added
to Herbert, with which it has little or nothing in
common. This makes Townsville doubtful. In addi-
tion, the Ministerialists have high hopes of wrest-
ing Normanby from Peterson, who won it for them
three years ago with a majority of 622 and seceded,
first to the Cookies and then to the United party.
They are also reckoned to have a fair-to-middling
chance in Kelvin Grove, one of the three new
constituencies —all metropolitan. The others, Wyn-
num and Sandgate, are gifts for the U.P. men; in
fact, Labor is not contesting Sandgate.
Theodore is confident that there will be no turn-
over, except in isolated cases. He counts on gaining
country seats, by virtue o i his scheme of agricul-
tural co-operation, and of retaining his hold on urban
constituencies as a result of his truce wdth the indus-
trialists, signified by his acceptance of the Bed
objective. But since the Country group loomed up
farmers who used to vote Labor, chiefly because they
wouldn’t be seen dead with the Liberals, have got
out of the habit. They may be induced to resume
it by the gift of co-operation with a catch in it —
the catch being city-fixed wages and the 44-
hour week for all rural workers— but the prospect
is remote.
Lastly, there is the fact that the people haven’t
had a change for eight years.' In the course of
eight years they are apt to grow weary of even
a good Government, and many of them have sub-
stantial reasons for thinking that this one is almost
as bad as a Government can be. To sum up, there
is a possibility of Theodore’s scraping in by the
skin of his teeth, and there is a much greater
possibility Of his being beaten as badly as Dooley
was. It will be one thing or the other—narrow
win or decisive defeat. If the man gets back with
a majority of 10, as Coyne predicts, the age of
miracles wilf have returned.
o
The Man of the Mountain Mists.
W. M. Hughes has resumed his journalistic
career in Sydney Telegraph with an article
on “Where I Stand in Politics.” It was
long, but the definition was as indefinite as
a baseless rumor in a fog. This was the
whole terrace of platitudes:—
(1) I believe in Australia as an integral part of
the British Empire.
(2) I believe in a White Australia.
(3) I believe in the regulation of ivages, hours and
conditions of labor by legal tribunals.
(4) I believe that the minimum wage should be
sufficient to maintain that standard of living and
comfort which is recognised in Australia as proper
arid necessary for the happiness and well-being of
our citizens.
(5) I believe in democratic’and responsible Parlia-
mentary government.
(6) I believe in sane finance and the development
of the great resources of Australia.
The Bulletin presumes that Mr. Hughes
wants office again. He certainly looks like
a man who does. But this shouldn’t be the
way to get it. When a confession of faith
is merely tantamount to saying that the poli-
tical aspirant believes in the moral code and
has a general leaning towards civilisation it
is very unsatisfying. Could wild traction-
engines drag from Mr. Hughes a concrete
proposition? For instance:—
(1) Does he believe in passing uniform bankruptcy,
company, insurance, banking, marriage and divorce
laws as specified among the (unused) powers of the
Commonwealth, if such laws can be passed, and
if they can’t does he know why ? And will he set
to work to remove the obstacle, whatever it is,
and how soon will he start after he becomes Prime
Minister again? And will he stick at the job after he
is started? If he believes, then how much does
he believe (the answer to be expressed in horse-
power), and if he doesn’t believe why doesn’t he,
and what does he think these subjects are mentioned
in the Constitution for? If, after all these years,
he hasn’t made up his mind, what does he think
is the value of his mind (the answer to be expressed
in Bolshevik paper money) ?
(2) Seeing that a great part, and the most
vulnerable part, of White Australia is hardly
any whiter than it Was 40 years ago for lack of
white people to whiten it, will he begin the
South-to-North railway promptly when he is once
more enveloped in the mantle of office, and then
keep going hard? If he won’t, will he mention
some adequate substitute for a railway as a means
of carrying white population to Where it is wanted,
and carrying its produce around ? Also will he let
us see the substitute working for a month or two?
(3) Will “sane finance,” when Hughes is C.usar
again, include a solid sinking fund—one that will
keep well ahead of new borrowings and make a
real reduction in the Federal debt? Further, will
it include a plan for controlling and reducing State
debts, there being nothing gained by relieving
Smith, the average citizen, of 20s. of Federal liabi-
lity if lie acquires 80s. of new State liability at
the same time? Or will “sane finance” just
scramble along in the old planless, formless way ?
(4) An adequate living wage being one of the
best things going, will Hughes return to his emi-
nence armed with a scheme for dealing with cases
where it can’t be paid under existing conditions
because the selling price of the output of the indus-
try won’t provide it ?
The Bulletin would also like the gentle-
man's definite opinion upon the New States
movement. It has been over 60 years in
politics, and Hughes has been there for 29
years. So if he says he hasn’t yet made up
liis mind, he might also mention the average
pace of his mind, and whether it stops at
all stations. Nobody will object to Mr.
, Hughes developing “the great resources of
Australia,” but it would be grateful and com-
forting- to learn if lie has any special resource
and any special form of development in view,
or is just chatting at large. And when he
speaks of “democratic and responsible Parlia-
mentary government,” does he mean simply
the present old thing, or Has he an amended
sample in view, and if so what does it re-
semble?
The Slump in Zionism.
Of all the vast, vague schemes of salvation
that had their birth in the World War Bol-
shevism has received the widest advertise-
ment, owing to the necessarily monstrous
scale on which it was staged; but Zionism
runs it a close second for impracticability.
A cable the other day spoke about a dele-
gation to the Colonial Office which “asked
that Earl Balfour’s declaration regarding
Palestine should be abrogated.” One of the
supporting facts brought under the Duke
of Devonshire’s notice was that, whereas
there are 589,564 Moslems in Pales-
tine, there are but 83,794 Jews, although
there are nearly 15 million of them
available to populate, the National Home!
What was the motive power which turned
the nebulous, theoretical Zionism of
Goldwin Smith’s day—a creed which a
fetv visionaries preached in England and
on the Continent without ever intending to
make an actuality of it —into something
capable of enlisting the support of so. prac-
tical a statesman as Lord Balfour? The
only possible answer appears to be a grow-
ing spirit of anti-Semitism. Before the war
distrust of the Jew was confined—so far,
anyhow, as Western Europe was con-
cerned —to France. During the war, and
after it, the Jewish international financier
impressed the public imagination even in
England as a menacing figure; it was
noticed that most of the successful Com-
munists and revolutionaries were Jews (in
the early days of the Lenin-Trotsky regime
Lunacharsky was the only prominent Bol-
shevik who was not a Jew) ; and the poor
Jews put up a bad record as evaders of war-
service. A feeling became prevalent that it
would be a good thing for civilisation if
Israel was nationalised; that if the world
failed to nationalise Israel, Israel would
presently inter-nationalise the world. The
obvious thing was to offer Palestine to the
Chosen People, whose leaders had always
represented them as hungering for it. The
first difficulty was raised by the Arabs, who
were as annoyed at the idea of their country
being transformed into a new Zion as Tas-
mania or the South Island of M.L. might
have been. The objections of the Arabs could
doubtless have been overcome if the best
class of Jew had brought his money and his
culture to the National Home. But the best
Jews declined to even visit the place. The
Hebrew immigrants it attracted were chiefly
unemployables and Bolsheviks. Another
method of beating down the prejudices of
the inhabitants would have been to outnum-
ber them. Here also Judaism failed. There
are still nearly as many Christians as there
are Jews in Palestine; neither faith is
materially increasing, and the Moslems out-
number the two combined by three to one.
Yet in the face of this Israel Zangwill,
the modern (non-resident) Prophet of Zion-
ism, is urging that the Arabs should be
forced to withdraw beyond the Jordan and
leave Palestine entirely to the Jews. Already
Britain has incurred the resentment of the
half-million Moslem inhabitants of Pales-
tine (including the important persons who
look after the Moslem holy places), and the
sentiment is likely to spread. It is hard
to say what counter the Gentile can find
against the racial exclusiveness of his Heb-
rew brother and the latter’s uncanny knack
of piling up huge sums of money ; but the
Palestine experiment has. anyhow, proved
one thing—that the Jew does not intend to
oblige the world’s anti-Semites by obscuring
the light of his diamonds in Zion.
Barbering a Barber.
Some years ago a bright young citizen of the
TJ.S.A. arrived in Sydney and opened a bar-
ber’s shop in Pitt-street. lie had the
national yearning to get rich quickly, and his
notion was to screw excessive prices out of
his clients by various impudent devices. The
amount from which the client was sepa-
rated depended on how much he had. and
one of the bright young visitor’s gifts was
a capacity to diagnose a prospective patron’s
wealth on sight. Once in the chair a simple
fellow who had intended to confine himself
to a shilling haircut was progressively com-
mitted to a neck-shave, beard-trim, massage,
manicure and blackhead treatment—total
costs, say, £5 10s. Attention was drawn
to the scandal, and counsel advised that the
offence amounted to conspiracy. The barber
and several of his assistants were thereupon
arrested, tried —and acquitted. Last Thurs-
day he appeared before the Registrar in
Bankruptcy. The profits made out of hun-
dreds of extortionate massages and thou-
sands of unconscionable beard-trims had
totally vanished in a few weeks’ litigation.
He had paid £2391 for the defence, which inclu-
ded the fees of two barristers and three other solici-
tors. Having been paid that amount his solicitor sued
him in the District Court for £220, subsequently
reduced to £64. It was on this latter debt that he
had been made bankrupt.
What a peerless example of poetic justice !
As that master of stereotype, W. M. Hughes.
might exclaim : “He has been hoist with his
own petard; Greek has met Greek; the biter

the wall and fie failed to observe it!” What
the ordinary member of the public w.ll won-
der, however, is why barbers who overcharge
should be indicted for conspiracy and finan-
cially ruined in the course of the struggle
to escape gaol, and not solicitors or bar-
risters. In recent trials in N. S. Wales
Judges have repeatedly complained that
counsel were deliberately wasting the time
of the Court. In view of the fact that the
gentlemen who so offended were being pa.d
some hundreds of pounds per week, it is
not clear how their conduct differed ethi-
cally from that of our Yankee visitor, who
also relied for his profits on the hairdressing
equivalent of wasting the Court’s time.
The Dashed Good Fellows.
“Saaedi” could do without some people:—
To the Dashed Good Fellow politician Australia
must debit most of its land, financial and centralisa-
tion worries.
Dashed Good Fellow politicians are of two kinds,
professional and temperamental. The former plun-
■ der prosperity to purchase popularity; the latter
are aften mere weaklings who blow this way and
that with the winds of expediency. Charles 1.
and Louis XVI. were horrible examples of the latter
type. They both made a fearful mess of things,
and lost their heads in consequence. To-day their
democratic prototypes in Australia make a fearful
mess of things, too, but we don’t get any satis-
faction. Ah, those were the days!
But whether the Dashed Good Fellow is such by
temperament or tactics he is never less than a
calamity. If an industry strikes a little rough
weather he rushes in to subsidise it, and so estab-
lishes a precedent for parisitism that is often fatal
to the industry, and always costly to the community.
An industry shoved about in an invalid’s chair soon
forgets how to use its legs, soon forgets it ought
to have legs.
Does the Dashed Good Fellow hear of 1000 persons
balloting for a block worth about £2OOO to the
winner, he raises a howl concerning land hunger, and
declares in a loud emphatic voice that he will see
to it. He retires into seclusion for a space, and
emerges triumphantly with a stupendous scheme for
settling everybody. The subsequent procedure
never varies in its fundamental features. The estab-
lished experienced settler, is bought out at a boom
price (if there isn’t a boom when the Dashed Good
Fellow starts he always makes one), and 10 or,
still better, 20 insanely optimistic amateur agricul-
turists are planted in the spot the experienced man
has vacated. The new settlers shoulder the burden
of the boom price and accruing interest on the
pocket-handkerchief blocks, and in a short time
there is a Royal Commission pondering over them,
and the country- is subsidising them, and the Gov-
ernment is blaming the drought, or original sin,
or Tutankhamen for the mischief.
Meanwhile the Dashed Good Fellow is away in a
cloud of dust rectifying some other grievance. But
the original Owners of the unsettled land are
pleased; so are the land-agents.
It is the city Dashed Good Fellow who is almost
invariably- the worst sample. This is inevitable
since he lives in an atmosphere of boom and
bureaucrats. He turns the full rays of the sun
of his benevolence upon the multitude roosting on
his doorstep. Is a tramline desired, or a bridge,
or pleasant and lucrative toil for the horny-handed
of his electorate, or more pleasant and lucrative toil
in “the Government” for a cobber, or a cobber’s
cobber, the Dashed Good Fellow is your man every
time. •
Of course, being a Dashed Good Fellow and having
such a growing. army of cobbers, there is always
arising the harsh necessity of increasing the number
of Government jobs, or decreasing the number of
his friends. But the D.G.F. has never lost a cobber
this way yet.
Such is the Dashed Good Fellow politician, and
he has crippled more industries, driven more people
off the land, and cost posterity more than the
droughtiest drought that ever parched the plains.
In consideration of these things, I propose that
every person before standing for election shall be
required to prove that he has never been a Dashed
Good Fellow. Also, that if, while electioneering,
he becomes reasonably suspected of developing into
a Dashed Good Fellow, he shall lose his deposit and
be disqualified. Further, if after being elected
he should be proved to have become a Dashed Good
Fellow (this often happens), he should be immediately
relieved of his Parliamentary job and sentenced to
complete his term on a prickly-pear selection.
The Problem of Race.
“Nordic” looks into a melting-pot:—
In the U.S. House of Representatives a bold
statesman called Sanders has introduced a bill to
prohibit immigration to the United States. Uncle
Sam has been getting terribly scared lately about
the influx of miscellaneous immigrants, and with
good reason. There are too many of them, not only
Germans and Italians, but Hungarians, Roumanians,
Russians, Lithuanians, and other Eastern Europeans,
mostly Yiddish. Sam once had the idea to let every-
body into the land of the free, but he knows better
now. It is only within recent years that science
has dealt seriously with the problem of race. Form-
erly people had a blind trust in the virtues of the
Melting-Pot ; but experts know that purity of race
is more important than numbers, and that the Melting-
Pot is a snare and a delusion. There is the
historical case of the Roman Empire, whose immense
melting-pot proved a horrible failure, whose ultimate
result is well exemplified in the coast peoples of
the- eastern Mediterranean and in the present day
population of Constantinople.
Mommsen said long ago that a mongrel people can
never attain real prosperity, or make a genuine
contribution to civilisation. According to modern
experts, the Europe* is are row divisiol into three
main races, the Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean.
The Mediterranean race achieved its highest results
in ancient Egypt, where the great civilisation of the
Nile Valley remained as long as the people were
uncontaminated by foreign blood. The Arabs or
Saracens had a burst of splendor in Mesopotamia
and Spain, but when strange women came into the
harems they faded out. There are different theories
as to the decay of classic Greece, which, of course,
was Nordic in race, with a Mediterranean substratum.
Something leitaiily went wiog with the mixture;
and as in the case of Egypt there has been no flower-
ing of civilisation for 2000 years. The celebrated
conflict of the Reman Patricians and Plebeians appears
to have had a racial rather than a political or
economic basis. The ultimate outcome of the Roman
Empire was the breaking down of racial barriers
and a general mix-up of the whole ancient world.
So Mommsen’s moral seems to bold good. The only
case that may contradict it is that of Athens, whose
people, so Professor Tucker assures Us in his bright
little book on Greek life, were more mixed and mon-
grel than any other Greeks. But perhaps the differ-
ent strains that went to the formation of these
intellectual world-beaters may have been mainly
Nordic.
The Melting-Pot has now been transferred to the
United States; and Uncle Sam looks thoughtful as
he watches it seethe and bubble. He begins to fear
the mongrelisation of his country, as in the case of
the Roman Empire, and makes strenuous plans for
race purity. So far Australia has been lucky in
having practically no such problem. The overwhelm-
ing majority of the people belong to the same race,
with the same blood, language, religion and tradi-
tions. Theoretically, and if the new science of anthro-
THE UNBEATABLE GERMAN.
JOHN: “Here, what’s the trouble between you two?”
ALPHONSE : “I’re. fought him and played him chess for the stakes, and he still won’t
pay up.”
FRITZ : “Yes, but he isn’t fair. He won’t play me with my double-headed penny.”
pology isn’t nonsense, Australia is in an ideal
position for making a first-class contribution to
civilisation, as all the greatest epochs were manifes-
tations of race flowering in new and various environ-
ments. It would be a fatuous policy to swamp
the country with immigrants, any kind of immigrant,
whether they were mixed or not, for the sake of
cheap labor. Quality counts more than numbers.

taken away a baby girl of five, occupied the
same room with tier for a couple of rights,
indecently assaulted her, and finally planked
her down near her home with a threepenny-
bit for a present! The jury recommended
the horror to mercy as he “didn’t mean any

Dear Bulletin, —Senator Gardiner went
GanbeiTa-ing with v.gor and incoherence be-
fore the Public Works Committee the other-
day
if I am an expert in interpreting public opinion,
ami I do claim to have had some experience, I say that
there is the utmost dissatisfaction throughout N. S.
Wales over the way in which tae compact made with
this State and with the rest of Australia 20 years ago
regarding the immediate building of the federal
capital has been broken. .. .If Labor was in power
we would be meeting at Canberra within two months.
According to the terms of the original compact it
was stipulated that the Commonwealth Parliament
should meet for business in its own House within 10
years.
iNuW, I should have guessed that Senator
Gardiner was about the most appalling
failure at “interpreting public opinion” in
Australia. A man who once prophesied vic-
tory at the polls and found himself the soli-
tary representative of his shattered crowd
in a House of 30,' seems an. Eiffel Tower of
misinterpretation. If this low-eomedy figure
in politics can produce an authenticated
copy of the “compact” about the. "immediate
buuding of the Federal capital,” or
the other “compact” about the Parliament
being there within 10 years, the concealment
of the incriminating documents is folly
amounting to lunacy, and should involve
medical inspection. It seems rather stupid
to shout that if a Labor Government was In
office it would do the. shift to ’Berra in two
months, seeing that four Labor Governments
have been in office during the period of sus-
pense, and two of them included GardiNer,
yet nothing was done except some per-
functory pottering. Gardiner didn’t re-
sign, either, by way of protest. The crowning
jest, l.howover, lies in the statement that
“there is the utmost dissatisfaction through-
out N. S. Wales,” which wants its Can-
berra and wants it hard. On that aspect
of the case a test is easy. When N. S.
Wales is really mad about something it goes
on strike, or parts of it do. During the last
year for which complete figures are avail-
able it had 535 separate industrial rows,
while the other five States managed only 89
among them. Not one of the. 535 was a
protest re Canberra. Some of the mining
strikes had no reason assigned. The men
wanted a hol'day, but couldn’t think up a
grievance. They might have said that
they were making a demonstration to attract
attention to Canberra, but they drew the
fine at; being that size in laughing stocks.
If Senator Gardiner can persuade even a
very minor union—say the Stained-glass
Window-cleaners or the- Ferry-boat Cooks
—-to throw down its tools on account of the
“utmost dissatisfaction” alleged, his case
will receive cons'derat'on. Otherwise it will
remain the standby of- elderly noodles who
are otherwise short of a policy.—Yours, etc.,
Bildad.

“Alkaloid” : “Sucre’s” figures(B.l9/4/’23)
--“the average return from a N.Q. sugar-
farm is about 700 tons of cane” —don’t apply
to the Burdekin, undoubtedly the largest
potential sugar area in Queensland. On the
Delta 25 tons to the acre is an average crop.
I have seen many 50-ton crops, and
occasionally 100 tons. “Sucre’s” 700 tons
could readily be grown on 25 acres or there-
abouts —a one-man job on the hundreds of
hoM.ngs north and south of the Burdekin.
Cutters' wages at 7s. 6d. per ton would
absoib £262 for 700 tons. Tins leaves £<oo
from “Sucre's” £970 for the farmer-owner
if he is prepared to do most of his own
work, as he should. An average sugar con-
tent of the cane is 12 or 13 p.c. I have seen
it as high as 19.2 ; rarely does it fall below 10.
This gives per ton roughly 3001 b. sugar, which,
retailed m Mel bourne or anywhere else at
per In., returns £5 12s. Gd. The
farmer gets £2 2s. That leaves £3 10s., which
the farmer never handles; so that the talk of
the high cost of sugar bemg due to the intro-
duction of white labor is rubbish. VVliat the
growers really do want is a better service of
mills to crush the season’s crop. Build a
few more crushing and treatment plants,
and there’ll be no need to import Island
sugar; nor will the visitor to the Queens-
land fields meet the depressing sight of hun-
dreds of acres of “stand-over” cane.
From 1893 to 1904 redistribution of seats
in W.A. meant little else but the creation of
brand-new constituencies on the goldfields.
Ever since 1908 its main objective has been
to rub out rotten boroughs and depopulated
electorates east of the rabbit-fence, and give
the cockies and citydwellers more represen-
tation. The Mitchell Goveimment has a
commission employed in examining quotas
and boundaries whose recommendations are
expected to cost the goldfields three or four
more seats and throw a similar number of
lawmakers on the labor Market. Coolgardie
and Cue look to be marked out for elimina-
tion at last, and Menzies, Leonora and Mount
Margaret are likely to be amalgamated into
one. As a slight set-off there is just a chance
of what is called the goldfields urban dis-
trict around the Golden Mile getting an-
other member. There are no indicators
that show the steady sag of the W.A. gold-
fields during the past 20 years more relent-
lessly than the electoral rolls. Time was
when the gold-mining districts returned more
than a third of the State Assembly, and at
the inception of Federation they were prac-
tically assigned two-fifths of W.A.V member-
ship of the House of Reps. Bit by bit, with
the decrease of population, their Parliamen-
tary representation, both Federal and State,
has had 50 per cent, knocked off it.
■ ♦
“Bloggs” : The loyalists of the Channel
Islands have just received from the Mother-
land a blow similar to that against which
our loyalists protested so bitterly when Lord
Dudley arrived in Australia with a mandate
from Downing-street to do what he could
for the Australian Navy scheme. In plain,
brutal terms, Jersey and Guernsey are being
asked to begin paying their defence bill. Of
late years well-to-do Britishers (and, inci-
dentally, well-to-do Australians) have been
pouring into the Channel Islands to escape
war taxation. The Britisher pays in taxes
£l7 Is. 2d.: the Jersey man £3 7s. 2d. The
British national debt is £lBO per head: the
Jersey debt £l2 per head. The Britisher
pays £7 13s. lOd. per head in income-tax and
super-tax: the Jersey man nothing. And the
nation says that it is time something was
done about it. If, as a result, the Channel
Islands come into line with the rest of the
Empire as regards taxation, the last refuge
of the British patriot who wants to be Jingo-
istic without financial tears, but within reach
of a good golf club, will be removed. An
additional tragedy from the standpoint of the
tax-dodgers is that many have bought homes
for which the original owners asked extor-
tionate prices on the plea that they were
situated in “the cheapest place on earth.”
The Turk is a procrastinating Mohammedan,
as a rule, but the Parliament at Angora
almost broke its wicked neck in its haste to
close with that Yankee syndicate which pro-
poses to invest some of the war profits on
this gigantic project for the reconstruction of
Turkey :
It includes the transformation of Angora into
a dream city, containing the outstanding features of
London, Paris, New York and Washington. The
scheme includes sugar refineries, afforestation, a net-
work of railways and roads and canals, bridges,
irrigation on a great scale, schools of agriculture
and engineering, hotels, etc.
It is said that 150 financial Goliaths of
Noo Yark are in the movement; also the
monetary children of Anak and Og, the big
capitalists of Bashan. George Washington
Goethals, the Panama Canal-builder, is to
take a hand in the work, and though he is
65. he is still “active and spry.” For long
Abdul dodged destruction by playing off
European Powers against each other; but
Germany, Austria and Russia are worn-out
pawns, and a new one became desirable. But
—and again, but! Uncle invested dollars in
Texas when it was Mexican land, also in
New Mexico, Arizona and California; and
Don Greasero de Pronunciamento saw
them all go. Uncle put a trifle of his savings in
the Philippines and Hawaii and Panama, too ;
and things happened to all of them. Moreover,
he is a much bigger and more mobile Uncle
than he was in the Mexican or even the
Spanish war days, and he knows the war-
road to Europe, which he didn’t know then.
Incidentally, Uncle has many dollars invested
in Canada. And one or two in Queensland.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Premier Theodore’s heelers are a valiant
and fairly eloquent crowd, with many fish
stories to demonstrate that their _ god has
brought peace and plenty. Their _ worst
enemy is the impassive Wickens, who ignores
politics, and only builds Federal statistics.
These figures of his dealing with factories
cover the period from 1915, when Theodore
and his friends of the “Rea Objective” took
office, to 1922, except, that the S,A. figured,
being late, stop at 1921: —
Commonwealth Factories, 1916-22.
Increase in Increase in
Number of Number of
Factories. Employees.
Victoria . . .. .. 1340 31,042
N. S. Wales .. .. 1082 31,871
Westralia .. .. .. 206 3,479
S. Aus (to 1921) . . .. 172 4,934
Tasmania •• •• 97 1,707
Queensland . . • 35 169
It is big Theodore’s hitter complaint that
his horde of unemployed (the biggest in
the Commonwealth) came from other States;
but as he hasn’t been _ finding employment
for more than a fraction of Queensland’s
natural increase it looks rather as if his
State had been exporting unemployed, and
those on hand were a vast sediment that
failed to get away. If it had done as well
proportionately as Victoria it would have
found jobs for 17,000 instead of 169.
Vic. Premier Lawson will probably return
from England to find the political atmosphere
as calm as when he left. The Cockies, who
were lately animated by the success of their
brethren in the Federal Parliament, have
abandoned their hopes of ousting Lawson,
and are now convinced that they can do
more good for their side as an independent
minority. The Labor party is too small to
make any trouble, though it threatens to be
fractious, over the amending Factories Act
Rill. However, this is a very small cloud
on the horizon, and it may be dissipated en-
tirely by diplomatic concessions.
The N.S.W. “Nationalist” Government has
taken a load off Theodore’s mind by having
the Irish Republican envoys arrested on a
charge of sedition. Thereby it prevented the
representatives of government by gunmen
from realising their plans for an immediate
invasion of Queensland, where their presence
in the closing stages of a bitter election
campaign would have sorely embarrassed
the Labor Premier. With the Opposition
waving the Flag for all it is worth, he
wouldn’t have known what to do with them.
A shrewd Sydney Government, alive to the
political possibilities, would have let the elo-
quent nuisances go north, and speeded their
going. But the Oakes Government has only
one eye, and that is blurred.
For its million loan the N.S.W. Savings
Bank received applications running to four
millions. As the money is to be used to pro-
mote “rural settlement,” the Government
chortles gaily that the over-application is an
evidence of the popularity of its land-settle-
ment policy. It is nothing of the sort. It
is merely an evidence of the attractiveness of
an offer of 5$ p.c. interest free of all taxa-
tion. Federal and State taxes combined take
np to 33i p.c. of a good many rich men’s
income, and in such cases 5$ p.c., plus exemp-
tion, is as good as 7J p.c. tor an ordinary
investment. And you can’t get gilt-edged
investments that yield p.c.: even the Com-
monwealth Government's ordinary 6 p.c. is
above par.
The Commonwealth Government has sold its
woollen cloth factory at Geelong for £155,000.
James Dyer, of Flinders-lane, is the pur-
chaser, and he takes stocks, etc., at valuation.
There have been many worse experiments in
State socialism ; but the Government is well
out of the business, for it couldn’t keep the
mill working full time without installing ex-
pensive machinery and plunging into fierce
competition with taxpayers, among others the
returned soldiers and sailors who have estab-
lished a co-operative woollen and worsted
factory in Geelong. And it has already
backed that undertaking with a £50,000 loan.
Some of the S. Aus. Libs, are so wild with
Barwell that they begin to foam at the mouth
when his name is mentioned. The impetuous
Premier’s latest offence was to ruin their
patient attempts to conciliate the Agrarian
group by rushing to the country and telling
the Cockies what he thought of them. The
latter replied in kind, and the row went on
until it petered out because there was no-
thing more to say. Now R. L. Butler has
taken Barwell to task for his tactlessness
and his Black Australia utterances, aid
other dissentients are expected to hold forth
when the party meets. The next session of
THE LANDSLIDE.
“In the first of his published articles, Mr. Hughes stresses the fact that lie is a champion of
democracy and democratic government.”
HUGHES: “Three hearty British cheers for democracy!”
THE KID: “But you didn't say that when you were strutting on top of that precipice.”
HUGHES: “Tut, tut! That isn’t a precipice — it’s merely a bluff!”
the State gas-factory is likely to be even
stormier than the last. And that was tem-
pestuous enough for anything.
The clumsy Sydney A.L.P. executive made
one more blunder when it summoned a con-
ference of trade-union secretaries to
strengthen its hands for the fight against
Dooley. As generally happens in these cases
the Communists took charge, and made the
executive and its tame Dunn and McTiernan
look cheap. Thanks to the exertions of Gar-
den, Willis, Howie and other imported
trouble-makers, the purpose for which the
meeting was called was lost in a cloud of
Red resolutions, one being that the N.S.W.
Labor party should be bound by the decisions
of the 1921 Trades Union Congress (in other
words, by Marxian Socialism and the “take
and hold” doctrine) ; another that the Com-
munist organisation should become part and
parcel of the Labor party. A Seamen’s
Union motion that the conference should
turn down the White Australia policy was
ruled out of order. But it shows how the
madness is spreading.
Provided Taylor inherits Theodore’s crown
in Queensland, he says his party will favor a
referendum on the question of dividing the
great unmanageable State into three. But
secession hardly seems a promising subject
for a referendum. This is really the ques-
tion to be put to the ruLng majority in Bris-
bane or Sydney or elsewhere: —
Seeirg that there is no known law which entitles
one white community to rule another against the
other’s will, will you let the said community rule
itself if it shows by popular vote that it wants to?
A certain size limit is necessary except in
the case of city States. But inside an
authorised area the people should be allowed
to settle the question of secession or no seces-
sion by themselves.
The cruellest thing ever said about the
Queensland Premier has come from Com-
rade Bob Boss. According to the fatally
eloquent Robert, who went north some
time ago in pursuit of funds for the Sydney
Labor daily, Queensland’s story of progress
towards socialism is “as worthy as Rus-
sia’s.” In fact, “Theodore is Australia’s
Lenin, or Lenin is Russia’s Theodore.” This
fatal adulation was printed when the vic-
tim was touring the rural electorates and
posing as a mild co-opera tionist. His re-
marks are understood to have been as red
as the Objective.
Theodore says passionately that there is
nothing but base calumny in the tale that
he once almost arranged to quit his party in
consideration of a leading place in the other
crowd —to make, in fact, the shift that Hol-
man and Hughes made. Still it was an inter-
esting lie, the burden of it being that a
fellow-Minister took too much refreshment
and told the matter, or what he thought was
the matter, to a private member. Either
because of his joy, or to drown his sorrow,
or from habit, the private member also filled
himself up, and in that condition scattered
the news afar. Then some men on the
other side, who d ! dn’t want Theodore in the
party, but who might have been mollified in
time, said things, and men on Theodore’3
side said almost everything.
All manner of friends have lain in wait
for the “soldier settler.” The Kendenup
crowd, 66 strong, is specially aggrieved.
Ivendenup is plain land of the pound-or-so-
an-acre sort; but when the original pur-
chaser had turned it into a company with a
big capital the paper value went up tremen-
dously. Advertising cost a lot, and ground
and lofty financing with debentures cost a
lot more. The 66 soldier settlers allege
that they contracted to pay £32 an acre,
being 20s. or so for the ground and the rest
for fatherly things the company was to do on
their behalf. The co., having dried up,
can’t do these things, and unless relief comes
from somewhere the settlers may have to
forfeit what they have already paid. Ken-
denup was Yanco without the power to
charge its losses and muddles to the tax-
payer. When it began to issue debentures
with lace and insertion on them, and baby
ribbon at the corners, financial people reck-
oned the game was up.
♦Minister Pearce is going to inspect his
biggest charge, the Northern Territory. He
will approach the place by sea, and when
the steamer calls at Brisbane Theodore will
presumably see him about getting the Dar-
win railway contract broken, and the line
taken into Queensland, leaving most of the
Territory as undeveloped as ever. When he
reaches Darwin he will go overland, but
not southward so that he may take in the
Macdonnell Ranges, and the Finke and other
rivers, and the land of cool summers and the
surveyed railway route. Rather he will cut
out most of the Territory and proceed to
Longreach (C.Q.). It may not signify any-
thing ; but, at any rate, South Aus. is justi-
fied in feeling some alarm at finding the
Minister even flirting with the corrupt pro-
posal to tear up the agreement which the
Commonwealth made with that State.
“Noah”: If Australia’s prize exhibit in
the soft-job section of the Commonwealth
service is the Taxation Appeal Board, the
Navigation Department is exhibit B. It
is run by imported skippers, for the most
part, w T ho have no idea of local marine con-
ditions, and is a byword for ineptitude and
“cushy” jobs. Formerly the functions of
the Department were exercised through the
State by local skippers well-versed in Aus-
tralian conditions and requirements. Then
came the Navigation Act, one of the worst
examples of Hughes legislation, and the
Federal Department was created to take
over control of overseas, inter-State, coastal
and harbor shipping. The overseas and
inter-State shipping was duly taken over, but
when Federal authorities essayed to secure
control of coastal shipping the High Court
declared the provisions ultra vires. The
Constitution will also prove a snag to the
authorities if they try to touch pilotage. So,
instead of one Department controlling ship-
ping, we have two, entailing an expenditure
of an extra £lOO,OOO or so p.a., plus
the cost of litigation on the constitutional
points involved; and the work is not done
as well as it used to be.
Something that some people might regard
as a joke is alleged in connection with Syd-
ney’s big prospective Cordeaux dam. It
has been known for at least seven years
that the dam v r as a coming event, but no
Government remembered to do anything
about the timber on it, said to be worth any-
thing up to £200,000. Holman put it off,
Dooley was too busy fighting McGirr, and
Storey and Fuller were occupied catching
the boat for London. Now the dam is
wanted in such haste that there is only time
to burn the lot, and it may cost £60,000 for
matches, etc. Sydney’s catchment area will
now extend to Mittagong.
One thing about which pious pilgrims re-
turning from Russia agree is that it is a
very different Russia from that of the early
post-Revolution days. It is. Lenin Pasha
saved himself and Trotsky Pasha in 192.1.
when he abandoned a cardinal principle and
permitted private trading. Before then
Smithoff couldn’t sell an egg to Brownski.
He had to sell to the proper department,
which gave him valueless paper in return ;
and then the department hung fire till the
egg went bad. Hence came the famine, or
the worst aspects of it. The crops failed in
some districts, and in others the farmers
had sowed only enough for their own pur-
poses, having lost interest in the official de-
partment. The change was made by “de-
cree,” of course. There is a Soviet, but if
it forgot its unimportance it would probably
be sent after its predecessor, the elected
National Convention, which made the mis-
take, in 1918, of thinking it was real.
No _ wonder ex-parson J. S. Garden,
who is really a very mild man, doesn’t
think Bolshevism would quite suit us.
Bakunin, the father of Nihilism, which is
the father of Bolshevism, wrote in his “Re-
volutionary Catechism”:—
If a son kills a bad father the act, though
meritorious in its humble way, does not take us
much further. But if he kills a good father, it
cuts at the root of all that pestilent system of
family affection and loving-kindness and gratitude
on which the present system is largely based.
Not for nothing do they call it the Red'
objective.
SECOND-HAND BEDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When snuggled up warm in your quilts of down,
Has it ever entered your heads
To think of the people who live down town
And sleep in their second-hand beds ?
Your blankets are clean and your sheets are white,
They are changed whenever you choose;
But how would you feel if your lot each night
Was a bed that looked like a bruise?
You sit on a chair to take off your boots,
Your room has a wardrobe and table,
A drawer for studs, and a place for suits,
Where you hang them up—if you’re able!
But how would you like it, when bedtime came,
To sleep in a threadbare blanket,
(dad were it only a blanket in name- —
And charity’s hand “be thankit!”?
How would you like to be junk in a crowd
That follows one after the other,
The sick and the sore, the crawling, the loud,
The Chink and his blackfellow brother?
Bach after each in the same old bed'—
Processions that lengthen with years—
“ Ticked” for the drunkard, the babe, and the dead,
In blasphemy, misery—tears!
Has it ever come into your well-kept heads,
As you lie in your quilts of down,
To think of the women in second-hand beds
At the other end of the town?
Have ever you thought of the babies born
Who have never yet lain on sheets,
Brought up and bred to the marriage morn
On the filth of second-hand streets?

This is another co. which was misled by its
advisers and reconstructed at the height of
the war-boom. For many years Paul and
Gray’s had been a sound and prosperous busi-
ness, ranking among the select few which
always appeared capable of earning good
divs. During 1018 £30,000 of reserves were
capitalised, and two years later £25,000
more. Prospects looked bright enough even
with capital expanded to £200,000 by the
£55,000 of bonus additions. But the direc-
tors did not stop there: at the height of
the 1920 “prosperity” they decided to recon-
struct, and £150,000 more bonus capital was
created l —this time mostly by writing up be-
longings and introducing goodwill as an
asset worth £65,000. For the following half-
year profits larger than those earned for
any previous full year were thought to have
been earned. Not long afterwards the direc-
tors began to discover that the 1920 “pros-
perity” was mostly froth and bubble: stock
values declined, the demand slackened, and
some accounts which had looked good became
doubtful. Things went from bad to worse
last year, and this is bow the directors sum-
marise happenings
At the date of the last report stocks were set down
at the then market value, and it was thought that
would leave a fair margin of profit on trading. How-
ever,- unfortunately, each succeeding shipment that
tame to hand proved that the values continued to
fall, and losses had to be borne throughout the year.
Believing that prices are now at bottom, the value
of stocks has been closely gone into, and the basis
adopted for calculating these was that of lowest
replacement value, which mainly accounted for the
loss.
Including the allowance now being made for
bad debts, the co. slipped £57,048 during the
year. That also included £8787 interim div.,
at the rate of 5 p.c. p.a., paid on September
19 ; and in view of the statements that values
had decliued continuously since the Febru-
ary, 1922, report, and that “losses had to
be borne throughout the year,” it would be
interesting to know how the directors justify
that distribution.
Practically all outer and inner reserves
having been absorbed in the reconstruction,
the directors have had no option but to don
sackcloth and fishes and appeal to share-
holders to agree to the writing-off of capital
to correspond with losses. Three shillings
mi each of the 351,500 £1 fully-paids
(£52,725) is being struck off, reducing pawl
capital to £298,775. It is questionable
whether the directors have lopped off suffi-
cient dead-wood; only slightly more than
one-third of the bonus scrip issued in the
reconstruction is swept away, and that does
not take into account the £55,000 bonus addi-
tions between 1917-1920. No less than
£59,000 of capital is still represented by
goodwill, and the justification for allowing
that intangible to remain depends wholly
on future profit-earning. An 8 p.e. div. on
the reduced capital requires £3OOO more than
the average earnings disclosed during the
seven years ended 1918. To the old hands
the juggling with scrip has not mattered
nmcli; in fact, some unloaded to advantage
in a market which was led astray by the
reconstruction. A number of new-comers
have been bitten: for a time reconstruction
scrip was at a premium, but when the co.
disclosed that O could uot maintain the 10
■p.c. div. with which it started, the market
fell a couple of shillings below par. Balance-
sheet comparisons over four years are given

The Union Trustee Co. is operating in three

The value of the estates administered is not
disclosed: the Union is one of the few trustee
concerns which have not followed the fairly
general practice of revealing this. At the
recent Union meeting, however, the chairman
confided that “the value of estates entrusted
to the co. during the past six years reached
£8,763,000,” an average of nearly 11 million
p.a. The non-disclosure of the aggregate
figures is of no real consequence; trustee
business is not like life assurance, in which
a management undertakes that, over a period
of years, it will accumulate amounts con-
tracted for. The trustee management is
handed the principal at the beginning, and is
not responsible for the quality of the invest-
ments; it merely undertakes to do the best
with the goods supplied, handle them economi-
cally, and obey instructions to the letter. As
a guarantee of good faith, and to assure
clients and beneficiaries against carelessness
and; fraud, the trustee co. offers its own
funds as a bond. This one has net assets
with a book value of £148,342, and share-
holders undertake to pay up Bs. per share
(£40,000) if called upon by the directors,
and are liable for another £1 (£100,000)
on liquidation.

distributed are not so sweet as the same rate
paid by some trustee cos. But shareholders
are doing very well, and, taking into account
the rapid development of the business and
the big margin of surplus profit, they have
prospects of fatter returns.

Wunderlich P. and L. accounts and directors’
reports say very little: the former are con-
fined to one entry which gives the net prefif,
the latter merely disposes of that profit with-
out a word concerning the year’s operations.
For the 12 months ended February 28 a net
■profit of £40,320 is shown, but in the table
£3520 voted to purchase of staff-partners’ cer-
tificates, to pay divs. on employees’ scrip
and to augment a superannuation fund is not
included. The Wunderlichs were among the
first Australians to introduce a co-partnership
scheme into their business, and the em-
ployees’ fund now stands at £34,100. Share-
holders’ capital is £380,000. The amounts
set aside for employees during the past seven
years have been as follows:

Their inclusion with the figures in the in-
troductory table makes earnings look better,
but there is not the pre-war fatness in the
business, for, apart from employees’ in-
terests, paid capital has increased from
£162,591 to £380.000, Net profits 10 years
ago gave a return of almost 21" p.e.
on capital; for the past year the re-
turn was 10.6 p.e. In addition to
the extra capital got in, £46,000 or so
more visible reserves are also helping. Of
course, conditions have not been normal for
some years: on the other hand, the building
trade has been much more active than might
have been expected considering the heavy
increase of costs, both in labor and mater,als.
Nevertheless, Wunderlich’s continues to pay
10 p.c.. and though the small margin left ■
after making that distribution suggests that
that rate is not dependable, the eo. may be
doing better than its published accounts
claim. No particulars are given of the allow-
ances for depreciation, etc., and only those
inside can tell the true extent of reserva-
tions.
During the past year there was an all-
round shrinkage of balance-sheet figures:—

of course, have exceptionally strong backing.
Reserves, apart from the provisions for de-
predation, doubtful debts, etc., amount to
£108,458, but goodwill (£65,702) is still in-
cluded in the balance-sheet, and reserves re-
presented by tangible assets amount to the

This old brewery co. did so much better
last year that the directors decided to alter
the form of the accounts slightly. For 1922
gross profits amounted to £62,839. Amongst
outgoings were Federal and State taxes,
£11,767. The past year’s gross profits
(£63,855) are shown after providing for
taxes. Net earnings are still considerably
less than they were around 10 years ago;
the brewing industry was then on a much
more favorable footing than it has been since
trading restrictions, heavier costs, higher
excise duties and other troubles interfered.
But a swing-back to something approaching
the former prosperity has been evident in
recent brewery accounts. During the war
years, when another wave of prohibition
propaganda was at its height, visible brew-
ery profits may have been affected by
managements making extra provision for
contingencies; a couple of the big brew-
eries w’ere certainly piling up very large
internal reserves. Whether this one was
also putting aside something more than usual
cannot be definitely ascertained. Its business
was restricted during the prolonged strike
at Broken Hill, where the co. has a branch
which has. shown losses, and business there,
is “still depressed from the consequencs of
industrial trouble.” Nevertheless, for five
years 10 p.c. divs. have been paid regularly.
Meanwhile visible reserves have expanded
only a few hundreds, practically the whole of
the surplus profits having been used to write
down book values of plant, rolling • sL^v.^’
etc., and goodwill. The latest appropriation
took another £5OOO for goodwill, and ex .
guished it as an asset. The co. had or. 1 ? 1 "'
ally paid £60,000 for it. So the if '‘b ot
reserves shown in the introductory table a r
no longer nominal: the whole of that reset e
besides the quarter-million paid capita is
now represented by things which are visible
to the naked eye. There are nlso reserves
for freehold depreciation (£48,832), lnsui-
ance (£3940) and security depreciation
(£2042), but what portion of that total of
£54,514 is a genuine reserve and not actually
required as a set-off against the book value
of assets is known only to the insider.
Since 1913 the book value of all fixed
assets (including goodwill) less the freehold
depreciation account has declined from
£459,269 to £425,987, the 'disappearance of
goodwill having been responsible for much
of the falling-off. Meanwhile the liquid
position has altered in this way: —

Excess liabilities £117,676 £40,053 £86,651 £90,211
During the past three years there have been
considerable additions to fixed assets, and
to pay for them the management has had to
go outside for funds. Consequently, after
having improved the liquid position by
£77,623 in the seven years to 1920, since then
it. has slipped back £50,158. Of the
£243,190 of liabilities £150,000 is a deben-
ture loan, and £50,692 of the liquid assets
was in the care of trustees to provide for
redemption. These debentures carry 5 p.c.
per annum and have been very helpful to the
business since money became dear. They
are redeemable in June, 1926, and on pre-
sent appearances the co. will have to pay
a good deal more for the money required to
help capital carry the property purchases
and brewery extensions of recent years.

The public is interested only in the £14,130

on ’Change. It is an astonishing business;
the gross profit from trading in prohibition
tipples and sweets last year was £28,908, and
when all exes, had been paid, income-taxes
provided for, and £4288 written off Wasting
assets, a net profit of £6OBO remained. The
cumulative prefs’. 10 p.c. is, therefore, at
present covered more than four times. The

That provides a wide cover for £14,130, even

out, portions of the plant and furniture
assets would be no more valuable than good-
will. However, that is a matter which con-
cerns ordinaries; but as their scrip for
£55,007 includes £29,303 excess of goodwill
over and above accumulated reserves, their
divs. are meantime very much more tasty
than the 7J p.c. rate suggests.

Because sharebrokers Were and Son have
been putting a few new ideas into their
business, Melbourne Stock Exchange has
been pursuing them with an axe. The firm
engaged a bright writer to compile and pub-
lish a weekly circular giving titbits of infor-
mation collected on the Block and in the
bank-parlor. Of course, the circular reaches
others besides the Weres’ clients, and rivals
don’t like it. Recently the firm was fined
£5O by the committee for commenting on
the slowness of contributions to the Vic.
loan, and for recommending as a better in-
vestment some of the short-dated, higher
interest stocks of other States. The Stock
Exchange committee constitutes itself a cen-
soring body with powers akin to those the
Hughesiliers wielded under the War Precau-
tions regulations. All publications, whether
in the newspaper press or otherwise, or
circulars by members in the nature of an
advertisement, are prohibited unless issued
with the special permission in writing of the
committee, which is to be the sole judge of
what is “in the nature of advertisement with-
in the meaning of this resolution.” Sydney
and Adelaide long since got past the stage
of prohibiting brokers adding their own
opinions to the formal official-list circulars.
* * * *
“Quondam Broker”: Nearly 35 years ago
a schism occurred in Melbourne ’Change
over the right to freely advertise by circu-
lars, reports, booklets, etc., as well as by
advts. The real cause of the bother was a
monthly report issued by Donaldson and Co.,
whose then chief partner, 11. H. Ker, pluckily
tackled Melbourne Trams paid to 10s., and
said they were not worth £6. Although they
went to £8 ss. Ker was quite right; still, he
was nearly torn to pieces by the old mem-
bers of the Exchange, many of whom held
Trams or had lent heavily on the scrip. The
fact was that the conservative brokers were
envious of the big business Ker gathered
through advertising. The rules were altered
to restrict advertising to publishing quota-
tions, and for many' years booklets giving
advice and tips and criticising balance-sheets
were not issued.
t Chairman Dick Osborne is too old a
bird in mining to say much about
Mutooroo’s Mt. Juglah show in his an-
nual report. The job is left to mana-
ger Jack Warrick. At the four shafts
prospects were irregular, but down to
40ft. sampled out at from 17dwt. to 30dwt.
The lode was in nice schist, and there were
plenty of pyrites. But below 40ft. values
faded to Bdwt., which, in a remote place like
Transville, wouldn’t pay for keeping the billy
boiling. The breaks in the lode and the lessen-
ing values reduced Warrick’s enthusiasm
to zero. The gold, he says, seems to be in
lenses, which means that it is in short
shoots —not a promising sign of permanence.
He wants to get down to 100 ft., connect up
the shafts, test the lode, and decide if the
show is worth further attention. Mutooroo
has £14,000 cash in hand, so can afford to
go ahead with prospecting to learn whether
the show is really better than it looks.
Mt. Monger Proprietary (W.A.) has been
impounded by the mortgagee, who intends
to drain the water-logged workings and “con-
tinue further development.” Years ago a
co. which then ran the show talked of a
Christmas dividend, a new 4oz. reef, and the
early duplication of the 10-head mill, and
prospects generally were boomed. But the
div. never eventuated. The 4oz. reef could
not be found when wanted, and prospects
faded altogether. The mine, like several
others on the Mt. Monger field, had some
rich ore near the surface, but what didn’t
go into the adjoining Gt. Hope lease petered
out in shallow ground.
* * # #
Hancocks, the Mecca of a number of Mt.
Juglah and Hampton Plains failures, and
the home of the Empire Syndicate (W.A.),
has a history. The first find was about 20
years ago, when a number of leases were
taken up by Adelaide and Melbourne cos.
A fair amount of gold was won, but by 1920
nearly all the ground had been abandoned,
and all the cos. had died. As far back as
1907 the State mining-engineer reported that
the reefs were near the contact of the dio-
rite and granite, and had a flat underlay.
But he made no mention of the large iron-
stone formations which are responsible for
the present activity.
* * * #
The inequitable basis on which taxation
is imposed on progressive mining cos. is
shown in the case of the Hampton Plains
Celebration Co., which out of a total expen-
diture of £39,376 had to pay £18,797: Fed-
eral, £10,797; State, £BOOO. The directors
state that “the payment of these taxes
absorbed the whole of the available cash
balance, and in order to provide furthei*
working capital it was decided to create a
mortgage of £lO,OOO, so that, in effect, the
co. had to mortgage its assets and pay in-
terest on a loan for the purpose of paying
this taxation.”
* * * #
“Peter Wongi’’: Ernest Williams could not
have done anything else but castigate the
present management of Boulder Persever-
ance (W.A.). The letting of this once-
good mine on tribute was a scandal. Wil-
liams might get it going again, but I doubt
it. The mine has been so pig-rooted, in the
usual tributor fashion, that it will be an
almost hopeless task to reorganise it. Any-
way, Williams had his opportunity 14 years
ago, when he was manager. He did not
make much of a fist of it then, when things
were better, so I don’t like his chance
now. The trouble with the Perseverance,
right from the start, was that a 22,000-tons-a-
-month plant was put on a 12,000-tons-a-month
mine. The consequence was that thousands
of tons of mullock and unpayable ore were
put through to make the tonnage, and the
rich stopes were “flogged” out to provide the
gold to balance the, poor stuff. Had two-
fifths of the plant been shut down 17 years
ago, and a monthly output of 12,000 tons
aimed at, the Perseverance would have been
a good mine to-day.

A Perth co., headed by A. E. Morgans, has
arranged with the Whim Well Co., Roe-
bourne (W.A.), to extract copper by its
new process, which Morgans and others
claim will revolutionise treatment. Several
experts, including State Mining-engineer
Montgomery, are "impressed” by laboratory
tests, etc., but say that the success of the
process in bulk treatment has yet to be
proved. And that’s the only success that is
worth tuppence to the co.
Daisy Queen, formerly the Hampton Daisy,
has induced a London crowd to nibble at
its Lawlers mine. A six-months’ working
option is under consideration, and if taken
and exercised Daisy shareholders are to get
£25,000 cash and a share-for-share interest
in any new co. formed. Operations have
been carried on continuously for over two
years, and although values appear to be
deep-seated results have not been dazzling.

The old Britannia lease, near Hampton
Plains, was included in the _ forfeitures re-
commended by the Kalgoorlie warden the
other day. There was no appearance for
the co. During the Hampton boom glowing
reports, specimens, newspaper puffs and other
devices boomed the shares, but when a few
small crushings had been put through the
mill a heavy frost settled on the venture.
The hopeful who still hang on at Cool-
gardie have asked the Westralian Govern-
ment to spend some money in testing one or
more of the old mines in deeper ground. The
request is not unreasonable; there is much
unprospected country, but the capital re-
quired can’t be raised locally, and outsiders
are shy of the old field.

Red, White and Blue, Norseman (W.A.),
announces a 31dwr. crushing. This is the
mine which a visiting optimist last year esti-
mated contained 14| million pounds’ worth
of gold, which he said was recoverable at
a cost of 3| millions sterling.

Gippsland coal-owners descended on Vic.
Mines Minister Sam Barnes with a load of
grievances the other day. The deputation
was behind closed doors, but the main griev-
ance appears to be that the State mine at
Wonthaggi is sell-ng fuel too cheaply for
them. They ask that Barnes, as Minister of
Railways, should induce Railway Commis-
sioner Clapp to lift the price of his coal
2s. (id. per ton. If not, 1560 workers may
be affected. This puts Barnes in a tight
corner, for he is a Gippsie himself. But it
is a rather cool request. The railways give
special rates to the mines, and Newcastle
does not quote against them. If they cannot
live under such conditions how are they
going to fare when Morwell gives its cheap
heat and power from brown-coal ?
* * * *
New Blue, Bendigo, had a record yield last
week, 500 tons giving 66S0Z, The co. had
nearly £2OOO cash in hand after paying a
Is. div. There was a decline of about 10s.
in the market value of shares in the middle
of last week, but there was ( a recovery on
the issue of a report by the manager that he
could see “no vital reason for the fall, as
the mine, generally, was looking ouite satis-
factory.” The slump was attributed to the dis-
appearance of stone in the main bedded vein
at 1600 ft. south. The manager attaches no
great importance to this, as the level is about
40ft. below the roll which recently went
overhead, and, as has happened before, he
expects the reef to make again at any time.
The rich stone struck above the 760 ft. level
did not continue when driven on, but the
face is still in “payable ore.”
Glen Innes district (N.S.W.) is noted for
its multi-metal deposits. There are many
lodes which carry a variety of metals, and
most in sufficient quantities for each to con-
stitute a payable proposition if it could be
separated economically from the others. It
is quite common for a lode to carry tin, wol-
fram, bismuth and molybdenite together in
an arsenical-pyrites matrix, but with none
so predominant as to make it profitable to
apply any selective process to its separation.
Around one shaft sunk 40 years ago is a
heap of ore from which specimens of gold,
silver, lead, copper, zinc, tin, bismuth, wol-
fram and molybdenite ore can be picked.
There is a strong, persistent lode, and a
general sample taken from the shaft not long
since showed aggregate values of nearly £lO
per ton; yet experts’ verdicts have always
been, “most interesting but impossible as a
commercial proposition.” The latest reported
discovery is at Shannon Vale, near Glen
Innes, where, it is stated, there is a big
lcde carrying tin, gold, silver and lead.
Queensland’s mineral production for 1922
was worth £1,825,280, as against £1,456,436
for 1921, an increase of ±366,844. More
than half of this increase came from Mt.
Morgan, owing to the longer period worked
in 1922. Very little advance was shown by
new fields. Chillagoe registered a good in-
crease, mostly from the lead-silver of the
Girofla and Consols. Its figures for 1922
were £122,310, lead alone totting up to
£59,390. Indooroopilly output was only £3838,
but the ore had been held back for local
treatment, otherwise there would have been
an advance over the £4037 of 1921. Her-
berton tin output just about held its own.
It has taken a jump forward this year, and
if the tin market holds the field should do
much better. Kangaroo Hills just held its
own. In Oloncurry the gougers were more
active and sold £14,000 more copper in 1922
than in 1921. The Mt. Cobalt lode raised
£20,330 worth of cobalt ore. The output
of arsenic for the State nearly doubled, most
of it coming from Jibbinbar. The Sundown
and Beecroft should send it much further
ahead this year.
* * * *
Mining in North Queensland showed signs
of rejuvenation during Premier Theodore’s
more or less triumphal tour of the northern
electorates. Around every corner a depu-
tation was lying in wait for him to screw
out the utmost possible on the eve of the
impending election. The biggest thing was
the deep-shaft subsidy for Charters Towers,
the State being asked to fork out roughly
£15,000 to make up the £20,000 considered
necessary. Theodore reluctantly agreed to
recommend the expenditure, provided the
scheme, is approved by the Government
Geologist. Several doles were handed out
to the smaller fry around the Towers. Mt.
Coolon waited in force with a peremptory
request for a public battery, but as there are
already three private ones in action, the
only satisfaction that crowd got was that
the matter would be looked into. Coolon is
growing in importance; it was stated there
were nearly 1000 tons ore awaiting crushing
facilities.
It has been one of the most awkward and
costly jobs for its size ever attempted in
Queensland to get the Lady Jane, at Mun-
gana, into action again ; but the job is com-
pleted, and the shaft secured to a depth of
320 ft. Down to 200 ft. the shaft was in
soft country that would not stand, and to
timber the shaft to this depth everything
had to be suspended by cables attached to
piles across the collar of the shaft. It was
rather lucky that copper improved when ore
was reached. The much-boomed lady dis-
gorged 360. tons copper-ore during March.
She is the lineal successor to the Einasleigh,
now defunct, in supplying the State smelter
at Chillagoe. The Lady Jane had a repu-
tation for rich shoots, but was always re-
garded as a dangerous and costly show to
work.
* * * *
No ore has been sent away from Silver
Spur (Q.) during the past quarter; silver
values have declined below the point that
justifies transport to Port Pirie. Stopirg
has been confined to the new lode around the
150 ft. level, and the ore is averaging 450 z.
silver. The ore-body has increased in width
with sinking, and that offers encouragement
to Edgar Hill to get smelters into action.
* * * #
The Government scheme for the disposal
of sapphires on Anakie field (Q.) seems to be
working smoothly. The Government acquires
the whole of the State’s output of gems, and
is dealing with Rubins after its own buyer
has graded the parcels and made advances
on the spot. High-class stones fetch from
£6 to £lO an oz.

The Dalmayne Collieries Co. is being re-
placed by East Coast (Tas.) Development,
Ltd., with nominal capital of £500,000 in £1
shares. The old debenture-holders are to
receive 45.000 8 p.c. first cum. prefs. for
their 8 p.c. stock; 94,400 ordinaries give
share for share to holders in Dalmayne;
90,000 8 p.c. cum. participating second
prefs. are reserved for contractor Joseph
Timms, of Adelaide, who is to take half the
cost of building the proposed railway from
the mine to Cole’s Bay in paid shares and
half in cash; 175,600 of these cum. partici-
pating prefs. are offered to the public; and
25,000 more go to underwriters. To induce de-
benture-holders to take shares, they are guar-
anteed arrears of interest. No cash or free
shares go to anyone, and if the new issues
are fully subscribed the co. will have £160,000
of working capital. The prospectus esti-
mates a colliery yield of 172,000 tons coal
annually, of which 80,000 tons will be for
Adelaide. 52,000 for the Speck’s services
and 40,000 for the National Portland Cement
Co. On the basis of an output of 150,000
tons and ss. per ton profit, with freights,
wharfage, etc.. £38,500 p.a. is expected,
which would give an all-round 8 p.c. and
leave £7552. The co.’s two explored seams
are estimated to give reserves of 8,000,000
tons. Estimates by the State Geologist, in-
cluding two unexplored seams, take reserves
to 15,000,000 tons. The other attractions
presented are : Railway land-grants, involv-
ing the right to buy at ss. an acre 2000
acres of Crown lands for every mile of
main line built; free township sites at the
mine; and port and timber cutting rights on
10,000 acres of additional land.

Mt. Jasper (Tas.) assets are as follows:
Mine and plant, £21,000 ; Mt. Stewart leases,
£2770; development account, £21,000; P.
and L. debit, £OOOO. They are book assets
only, and it is doubtful if a clean-up sale of
the plant and property would bring in more
than £.lOOO net, when due consideration is
given to the location of plant, its obsolescence
and present surplus of second-hand mining
gear available. In any case, the £21,000
placed against development can under no
conceivable circumstances be reckoned an
asset unless ore is available for extraction to
reimburse the account. The mine to-day has
no ore reserve available, and the £21,000
should rightly be added to the debit at P. &
L. During the past three years a mine-
manager and four men have been employed
on the actual work of extraction, assisted by
a secretary and a Board of Directors in
Melbourne, and during the period their com-
bined operations have taken £BOOO-odd.
Head-office expenses alone amounted to about
£3OOO, which is a ridiculous proportion and
quite out of keeping with the small-scale
operations. Mt. Jasper is in a district notori-
ous for its “stringing-on” propensities, and
from the many hundreds of thousands spent
and wasted in the area not one decent pros-
pect has been unearthed. As about £23 per
live share has been called to date for no re-
turn whatever, and the mine has not been
able to give sufficient ore during- the last
three years to pay mine-management ex-
penses, it’s about time the shutters were put
up. Formerly a copper show, in recent years
Mt. Jasper has been scratching here and
there for galena on Pleazlewood Hill.

A co. in which Hobart is interested pro-
poses to open up a nickel-copper formation
in the Mt. Read district (Tas.). The lode
is reported to be 54ft. wide, the pay streaks
assaying 8 p.c. nickel, 10 p.c. copper and
4dwt. gold. If the lode opens up well a
large float is contemplated.
* * * #
A new lode near the old Swansea mine,
Zeehan (Tas.), has been opened up by pros-
pector Sweeney. A 30ft.-wide lode is claimed
to carry galena on both walls. Bulk assays
fromthe firsts have returned 90oz. silver
and 75 p.c. lead. The discovery is causing
some excitement in the old silent city.
Radium production must be an exciting
business. The principal mine is said to be
in the Belgian Congo, and “has the best-
equipped plant in the world.” Its record
annual output was that of last year—less
than 500 grains !

Centurion”: Some of the Light Horse
had a good example of the Gyppo’s venera-
tion of the dead—a veneration that has re-
cently given Rider Haggard and others much
concern apropos the “desecration” of Tut.’s
tomb. The regiment was stationed at Beni-
hassar, in Western Egypt, the site of the
ancient city of Oxyrinchos and Heaven

HUBBY: “You want every fashionable fad that other

knows how 7 many before or since. The edge
of the desert was a mass of tumuli; broken
pottery and bone fragments were every-
where. In the heart of the ancient city
site the Gyppo in hundreds was mining the
dust of his venerated ancestors for manure.
This was sifted to get rid of metal scraps,
pottery, etc., and the soft, rich, brown
powder was carted off by the bargeload along
the canal known as the Bar Yusuf to the
Fayoum. The biggest mine reminded me
of the old open-cut at Mount Morgan on a
small scale, save that the pillars of a Greek
temple stood in the middle. Every
digger and sifter was a curio-merchant, and
did more or less business with visitors. Over
it all was a cloud of brown dust and the
smell of dead ages.
“Ajax”: The Adelaide Register has been
collecting some glowing impressions on com-
munity singing. “I think it is sweet,” coos
one enraptured lady, “that a mother should
learn a lullaby like ‘Oh, hush thee, my
baby, thy sire was a knight.’ What if, as
she sings it to her baby, she has nothing
to look at but a back yard and a clothesline?
In imagination she sees further than that.”
Doubtless: but if a husband with no poetry
in his soul hears her lullabying it, com-
munity singing will have its drawbacks when
it leads to an oppressively respectable
K.B.E. being cited as a co-re.

“Digger’s Batman”: Usually my badge
costs me money, but on Anzac Day it was
different. The tram conductor, ignoring my
extended tuppence, went fare-hunting in
further compartments; and when, getting oft.
I approached to pay him, he rang for the
driver to start, and waved back the proffered
coins w r ith a “G’luck, Dig.!” Then I re-
membered the badge on his coat. On
two other trams I failed to induce the
troub. to collect my fare, and in the same
number of pubs the barman insisted that the
money I had put on the counter in payment
was my change. The steward in a city club
who put the money back from his tray on to
the table doubtless voiced the general senti-
ment : “We did our bit, mister, and there
ought to be one day in the year when the
others pay for us.” Next Anzac Day I am
going to leave my conscience at home and
have a really good time.

in 1915. Objection wars taken by the Dig-
gers to two of their number being spread-
eagled on a waggon’s wheels, on the edge of
a blazing salt-lake, in the heat of the sum-
mer sun. Some of them paraded to the O.C.
and asked that the men be released or tied
up in the shade. The request being refused,
the Diggers went down in a body and cut
their comrades loose. The martinet in
command had them tied up again, and stood
with the guard beside them. Though at
first he drew a revolver w r hen a further
demonstration of protest began, he finally
caved in, and the victims of Field Punish-
ment No. 1 were loosened and taken to the
guard tent. The trouble didn’t end there,
however—some of the Digs, got up to six
months for complicity in the affair. I was,
later, with one of the two men who were tied
up, and he was as good a soldier as I could
wash to know. A piece of shrap. dinted his
eye in on Gallipoli. The other passed out
in France.
“Bouragi”: Some mission-
aries who recently reached
Sydney in the John Williams
are alleged to have told a wide-
eyed reporter* that a chief of
the wild and savage Fly River,
30 miles from Daru, Papua,
was annoyed with his daughter
over some matrimonial aspira-
tions, so he took her to “his
schooner,” anchored out in the
river, and after chopping her
arm off locked her in the cabin,
to die. Of course, the district
is inhabited by the “worst type
of native,” and only after the
intrepid missionary had gone
there first and reported the
matter did the Government
dare to investigate. The yarn,
slightly varied, has been heard
a hundred , times. Its real im-
portance lies in the advertise-
ment it gives the mish. For
30 years any locality within 30
miles of Daru has been a
darned sight more law-abiding
than Martin-place in Sydney.
The chief who owed a schooner
is, however, new to me, and I
have known Papua since ’97.
So is the chief, or any other
Papuan, who would ruin a
valuable asset like a pretty
daughter by cutting off one of
her arms. The yarn goes on
to say that after the girl’s arm
had been lopped she lived for
four days, though nothing is
said as to her method of stop-
ping the arterial bleeding. As
it was, she “died too soon to
hear the triumphant Drocession
of her lover’s tribe, with her father’s head
leading all the rest.” This is a new addition
to the old story, and I bless the Amurrikan
movies for it.

“D.”: Dr. Stopford, a N. S. Wales M.L.A.,
has written to Speaker Danny Levy urging
him to have a transmitting broadcasting set
placed in the State Assembly at an estimated
cost of £5OO. The object is “to enable per-
sons all over the State to listen carefullv
and with interest to the debates.” If the
citizen can stand the language the Exchequer
should be able to afford the money. Dan
Levy, as the central figure of one of the
loudest outbursts of violence and blasphemy
that have besmirched the Macquarie-street
Legislature, is just the man to adjudicate on
the matter. On the one hand he will argue:
“Should such a wild-beast row as that which
broke loose when I first took the Chair be
brought to the ears of law-abiding bulloekies,
etc.?” And on the other: “If Parliamen-
tarians know that electors are listening in,
is it not conceivable that they may behave

more like human beings?” The public’s view
will probably be that the experiment should
be worth trying, even tliough the ears of
Outbackers are seared while Parliament
is learning to control itself.

“A.T.R.”: From a municipal report in
the Launceston (Tas.) Examiner:—
Mrs. wrote asking if she could rent the cemetery
in the town of Crawford for three or five years, as
it is in a bad condition. She offered to cut black-
berries and ferns, as it was of no use to anybody as
it was, and she desired to plant it with 'potatoes.
It was agreed that the letter be sent on to Hobart
with a recommendation that it be accepted.
There seems to be an idea here. I know at
least a dozen to_wn-born and town-bred men
who, out of their profound ignorance, legis-
late on land and other rural matters. In
consequence what I long to see is an advt.
like this in the Examiner :
Undersigned has vacancies for two M’s.P. They
will be taught country needs in return for services
as rouseabouts. —F. Goggist, Hope-on Farm.
Like that cemetery, something might really
be done with these city agents, etc., if they
were taken in hand.

“Fana”: There was a “man-woman” case
which the dailies didn’t get hold of in a
large metropolitan hospital the other day A
motor accident late at night resulted*in a
youth of about 19 or 20, with two more mature
companions in mishap, being taken to the
hospital by a passing motorist, assisted by
a constable. The two older men were merely
bruised, but the youth had been stunned, anil
the casualty surgeon on duty ordered him
to be detained for treatment. In the course
of executing the order, the attendants found
that the patient’s pants belied the wearer’s
sex, so to speak, and some natural confusion
ensued. The situation was not cleared up
till the girl had recovered her senses. Then
it came out that the affair was the outcome
of a bet that the joyous nymph would not
be game to walk along certain thoroughfares
and enter a restaurant wearing a man’s suit.
The bet had been won, and the return jour-
ney almost accomplished when the accident
occurred. The doctor and nurses were im-
plored to keep the secret, and they kept it
so well that one John Smith is still on the
hospital records as the recipient of the casual
treatment that Jane Ilighstepper received.
* * * *
“The Deacon”: The “Office Sexton” (B.
26/4/’23) puts the marriage service case for
the Protestants alone. The R.C. Church
has no use in her ceremony for the “love,
honor and obey”—especially* the “obey.” It
holds that the essence of the matrimonial
contract is centred in the parties themselves,
not in the officiating minister, who is merely
a witness to the transfer of the bodily do-
minion of the pair. The Church merely in-
sists that in a true marriage the bond is in-
dissoluble, except by the death of either
party, and that the male must cherish and
support the other. It is all contained in
a eommendably brief service, lasting about
three minutes,’ in which there is never a
hint about obedience.
“Clifford Snook”: It
is consoling to learn,
on the authority of
doctors who specialise
in signing the certifi-
cates on which the
allegedly insane are
run in, that there are
no sane folk in N. S.
Wales mental hospi-
tals, any more than
there are any good
folk in Sheol or inno-
cent people in gaol.
Reluctantly they admit
that they don’t make
mistakes and “sign
up” the wrong parties,
nor do they cover up
other medicoes’ blun-
ders as a matter of
etiquette. So I feel
safer now. At the
same time, various
Sydney doctors who do
not specialise in the
mental line themselves
have assured me that
one of the men who
does is very mad. And
I knew one leading
light of the tribe whose
condition, before he
gave up practice, was
obvious enough. His
finish was rather a ■
mystery.

“Wilfrido”: A
Maoriland counsel was
boasting of his recent
successes at the Bar.
“During the last two
years,” he said, “I
have had over 70
Supreme Court cases,
and I’ve only lost
four.” The quiet mem-
ber of the club potted
a difficult black. Then,
looking up, he asked gently, “Were they the
defended ones?”
* * * *
“Nemo”: “Caballer” (B. 29/3/’23) on
Chinamen and bombs reminds me of
an incident (never mentioned in despatches)
that happened near Poperinghe in 19 IS.
Around this town many Chinamen were
engaged in repairing roads. The Fritz
airmen were very active at the time, and
on a moonlight night one of them “found” a
Mongolian camp with a “string” of bombs,
causing a few casualties, much chatter and
a general stamped*. Some nights later a
party of almond-eyed avengers, equipped
with “souvenired” Mills bombs, crept up to
a. camp of German prisoners in the vicinity,
and started what they evidently deemed
legitimate '.reprisals. Owing, however, to
excitement or ignorance they forgot to re

move the pins, whereupon the grinning Huns
pulled the pins out and threw the bombs
back. There were a few casualties, but
Fritz entered into the business rather as a
joke than otherwise, and for once didn’t do
the butchery that was in his power.

THE GIRL WHO TURNED ME DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the girls that are so sweet
There’s one beyond all praise;
My heart f once laid at her feet —-
’Twas in my calf-love days.
When “No"’ she said, instead of “Yes,”
My grief I tried to drown.
That’s years ago: I’ve learnt to bless
The girl who turned me down.
She married Brown —poor little wretch!
I see him, henpecked, worn ;
Her slave to carry and to fetch,
At noon and night and morn.
The clacking of his lady’s tongue
He bears without a frown;
She’s just the wife for him, the young-
Pert miss who turned me down!
He’s loyal. He would never hear
A word against his spouse;
The Stork calls punctually each year,
And to his fate he bows.
She “dresses up” like any ciblt,
But drab and frayed is Brown;
Her virtues, though, we both extol,
The girl who turned me down.
And I’m sincere as well as he;
He won her for his bride,
And she preferred that chump to me—
We all are satisfied!
I push no go-cart round the block,
I wear no martyr’s crown;
Fortune at my door gave a knock,
When that girl turned me down.
VICTORIA.

“Natia” (Misirna Island, Papua) : My
native orderly and his wife fell out, where-
fore the lady abruptly quitted the sago-palm-
leaf matrimonial shack and returned to her
parents in an adjacent village. The aggrieved
husband, assisted by some sympathetic
friends, proceeded to enforce the restitution
of conjugal rights in the way that Papuan
custom prescribes: he just went over and
retrieved his missing property vi ct armis.
Unfortunately he chose the wrong day for
his enterprise, as appears from the following
protest addressed to the Government by the
native missionary of the village:—
Greetings. This little paper I write to you. I want
to ask you if it is fitting for a man to take spear and
knife with which to kill a man on the Sabbath?
Yesterday, Sunday, some Suaus came to a house
here with spears and knives and threatened the
people. We are angry because they came on the
Sabbath and did this thing. •
Which suggests that at least one of the Ten
Commandments is making gratifying head-
way in Papua.

“Winkle’s” tribute to an all-wool chaplain:
As far as the pressing needs of the fighting men
were concerned, mental, physical, financial or
spirituous, your ordinary padre was of no great
assistance, largely because his three stars and the
looked-for salute put him above the level of the
ordinary private. But there were some notable
exceptions. To R.C. Padre Bossence the Camel
Corps in the desert must at first have seemed a
lost tribe. The “stinkers” were called daily so
many kinds of blankard that this word became the
staple greeting. Polite attire consisted’of the scan-
tiest possible pair of “shorts,” but most, attire was
impolite. Gambling—including two-up—was the
popular recreation. “Boss” didn’t try 'to alter these
things in a day. He moved quietly among the men,
joined in their sports, turned his deaf ear to their
ribald choruses and gory adjectives, but was always
trying to help without scaring anyone with his
piety. With his own flock he had one rigid rule:
all must attend mass once, a week, or put on the
gloves with him, when he would thrash backsliders
in a mild and winning manner. During an engage-
ment he was always in the trenches with the hoys,
VERY POLISHED.
"Mr. Sinnik is very polished, isn’t he?”
“ Very! Everything he says throws a reflection on some-
one.”
joking with them and bucking them up; and beyond
Ibna Abrak he got his M.C. for bringing in wounded.
He was never called Captain, nor Rev., nor Sir, but
he earned a lasting respect from one of the roughest
crowds in the war—a crowd that included this
writer, who was not of his flock.
OH, QUITE DIFFEREDT.
“Do you believe, dear, that, we should ' work for our husbands?"
“You bet I do, old deaf. You just bet f do."
“I mean after we're married."
“Oh, after we are that's different."
“Lexite” : The Johnson v. Johnson divorce
case, which found its way to the High Court
the other day, exemplifies the maddening pre-
cision of the Law. The complaint of the
petitioner in the original divorce suit was
admitted as proved, but the point was raised
that the wife, when the adultery occurred,
was insane. Accepting this view, the
Divorce Court refused the petition, and the
appeal proceedings began. The position
appears to be that, although a man can
obtain freedom from a wife who is insane
because she is insane, or from a wife who is
unfaithful because of her unfaithfulness, he
is denied, relief in the case of a consort who,
whilst, insane, has committed adultery—
assuming, of course, that he applies for it
on the. ground of misconduct. There is some-
thing in this hair-splitting which raises fresh
doubts about the sanity of the Law itself.
“To Po”: A Vic. State-school boy won a
scholarship, completed his four years’ sec-
ondary course, and, to please his dad. sat for
the entrance to Duntroon exam, and topped
Australia, though his personal ambition was
pharmacy. For five years he swatted at
soldiering, part of the time in England, win-
ning an honored position, in each test. Then,
when the Government decided that the de-
fence of Australia could look after itself, he
was booted out, having no friends in high
places. He is now too old even to dream of
becoming a chemist, and the last I saw of
him he was broken-hearted and clerking for
a butcher.
From the Office Sexton:
The Russian has always been
viewed as a pious person in a
dull way, But he is also accus-
tomed to be ordered about by
either a czar or a “commissary” ;
wherefore he possibly may go back
to heathenism to order. It would
be a grotesque and calamitous
jest if, after that, there came a
Mohammedan revival, simply be-
cause the people felt that they
wanted a faith of some sort, and
were told that the old gods were
out-of-date and unsatisfactory.
.The old Russian Empire contained
14,000,000 Mohammedans, and
they remain in their old haunts.
Turkey-in-Europe didn’t contain
a third of that number, and Islam
ranked second among Russian
sects. R.O.’s and Protestants
hardly count since the session of
Poland and the Baltic States,
and if the Orthodox Catholic
(Greek) Church is pushed off the
premises Abdul - may' find a. chance
to plant his little mosque on the
vacant space. He may be slow
in many matters, but in hunting
for converts he is an express. And
the mosque, like the synagogue,
comes to stay, unless removed by
violence, as it was out of Spain.
It represents a creed which doesn't
strain the intellect, offers latitude
in the way of hating one’s neigh-
bor on earth, and provides an
easy road to Heaven, with good
female society when one gets there.
So a converted Mohammedan is
about as rare as a square triangle.
“E. J.P.”: “Drayman’s” figures about
battalion losses (B. 29/3/’23) impel me to
draw attention to the history of the 24th,
which claims a casualty list of 3420. The
figures are quoted from Birdie’s foreword to
the “Bed and White Diamond”; the killed
amounted to 920. Apart from those who
later went west in hospitals, the numbers
who actually fell on the principal battlefields
were: Gallipoli, 95; Pozieres and Mouquet
Farm, 213; Bullecourt, 114; Broodseinde,
132; Mont St. Quentin 48; Montbrehain,
63. At Mont St. Quentin the wounded
totalled 91, the excessive proportion of
deaths being due to the lack of shelter, which
resulted in men once hit being repeatedly
wounded by the heavy M.G. fire. “T.A.W.”
(B. 12/4/’23) claims that losses are nothing
to be proud of. Yet, to most of us, casual-
ties will continue to be evidence of the
severity of a unit’s engagements, and the
memories of losses sustained in valiant at-
tempts or glorious achievements will remain
the subject of pardonable pride.
“Pip Tok”: Hobart University is spark-
ing. Up till a few years back no Australian
seat of learning took its pleasures so sadly.
The undergrads, were not adepts
at revelling even at Commem,
time. When the period referred
to in Sydney as “the Students’
Saturnalia” arrived in Hobart,
a number of sad-looking young
men, in gown and mortar-board,
essaying the feat of smoking-
churchwardens, would drive
round the town in landaus. The
whole proceedings were marked
with a decorum that was
almost funereal. Now comes
the news that barbarous clamor
prevented Lieut.-Governor
Nicholls from delivering his
address at this year’s Commem.
The Lieut.-Governor regards
this as a personal affront to
the Sovereign. During the pre-
sent King’s visit to Sydney,
early in the century, he was
mildly heckled by Sydney un-
dergrads. on the subject of John
See’s knighthood, which John’s
well-wishers expected would be
a sequel to the royal tour. The
students concerned were ex-
cluded from the following Com-
mem., but _it is not recorded
whether his Majesty felt ag-
grieved or amused. In the
Speck they are more ruth-
less and _ make the punishment
fit the crime. The King having
been allegedly affronted in
treatment accorded to his de-
puty, the names of the offen-
ders have been removed from
the Government I louse visiting list.
:• f “0.K.” on national saints :
Anglican Archbishop Lees commented recently on
the absurdity of the objection to St. George being
called the English patron, saint, instead of the British
ditto. I’m with his Grace. The saint never existed,
perhaps, . but if Scotland is going to celebrate a
St. Andrew’s Day, and. Ireland make an everlasting
turmoil oyer St. Patrick’s Day, and the Welsh brag
about St. David, why is it not permissible for poor
old England to have a dragon-killing St. George 9
The Scotch take care not to call their saint British;
and why should a -St. George’s Society be less English
than a .st, Andrewls is aggressively . Scottish'? . Is
the English worm never to turn ? Let the Scotch:-
men , drop their Andrew, and .the Taffies discard their
David; then they can have shares in George.
*** * •
“Lex’s” view of it: —
. The Law. has shown an unwonted weakness in
regard to the Irish envoys, by comparison with the
sledge hammer blows it is capable of dealing at
others who are objectionable to embattled Authority.
Let it be granted that with the War Precautions Act
dead Bruce couldn’t have treated Father O’Flanagan
and his colleague as Hughes did Esmond. Yet there
is still the Alien Immigration Restriction Act, it
was expressly designed by the late Joe Chamberlain
to meet such cases as this. If our unwelcome visi-
tors had been asked to write a verse of “God Save
the King” in Icealandie as a. condition of entering
the country they would never, have left their ship.
As to tiie position of the N, S. Wales Government, it
had a perfect cloud of Just prior to
every big race meeting, and on hundreds of other
occasions, the police round up those who might be
expected to interfere with the general harmony under
the Vagrancy Act. Wealth has nothing to do with
the matter. A Victorian was “vagged” in Sydney
the otner day who was in a position to prove that
he had a large income. The envoys began by saying
they were collecting for the Republican Army, and
they now claim that the money is for another pur-
pose ''altogether. By a little straining of the law,
from which no well-trained Government official
would recoil in the interests of his job, the missioners
might be indicted for obtaining money under false
pretences. And then there is that infallible stand-
by, “offensive behavior.” Offensive behavior is any
imaginable activity that happens to annoy a police-
man, from wearing a white hat to throwing a bomb
at a Governor. The Oakes-Bavin device of during
De Valera’s emissaries to take up collections, daring
citizens to jisten to their remarks, and daring- hall-
owners to let them halls is rather like going quail-
shooting with a defective air-gun when a new Purdy
12-bore is available.
•** * *
“Konini”: A projected memorial to the
Diggers who fell in the war has been meet-
ing with heavy weather at Wellington
(M.L.). Last year the soldiers themselves
got to work, with the aid of civilians on the
committee, and raised about £2OOO. This
year plans were just completed for another
assault upon the pockets of sluggish citizens,
when an unlooked-for complication arose.
A. P. Whatman, from Mastefton, who looks
upon the returned Diggers as his special care,
and has already gone dawn into his pockets
deeply on their behalf, arrived from the com-
placent capital of the Wairarapa and, at a
meeting of 700 Diggers, swept aside the
monument which had been practically de-
cided upon and suggested a Soldiers’ Club at
a cost Of £35,000. As a start he undertook
to give £lOOO, With visions in their minds
of a comfortable club —the present institu-
tion is W makeshift—the Diggers provided
a majority for the new scheme, though not
a thumping one. But if the struggle to raise
a couple of thousand pounds for a monu-
ment was so strenuous, what will it be to
raise £35.000 for a club, especially when
there is a sharp division of opinion about it?
A TRIFLE ON ACCOUNT.
"Daddy, am I going to be a lawyer when I’m big? I
can make a lot of money at that, can’t I. daddy?”
“you should, sonny.”
“ Then, daddy, lend me sixpence till I grow up.”
“Six-and-Eight” on history’s encores:—
The sale of the N.S.W; loan-bought trawlers recalls
the first occasion on which the trawl net was. used
in Australian waters. It was in 1857, when a
ship from Mauritius .arrived in Sydney with such
a net on board. The yarn told by the master of
the vessel (no doubt with an eye to business) was.
that he had caught such enormous quantities of
turbot near Sydney that the net had broken under
their weight. Daniel Cooper and Governor William
Denison bit, and the skipper sold his net. Then he
disappeared and the purchasers persuaded Captain
'Francis .Hickson, R.N., to take charge of their fish-
ing venture. Hickson trawled Jervis Bay and likely
places along- the coast, but had- no luck. The net
fouled, the beam broke, and after 12 days, during
which not a solitary turbot was seen, the enterprise
was abandoned. Beside “plenty of blubber and other
refuse” the catch consisted only of a few sole, John
Dory and flathead. Such was the inauspicious
beginning of trawling in Australian waters, But.
Hickson’s report on it was no worse than the
N.S.W. Auditor-General’s funeral oration over the
just-defunct State enter-prise.
HEAVEN AND HEARTH.

I do not know what Heaven may show
Of raptures rich and rare;
I do not know if, when I go
To test that Otherwhere,
TTI find those blooms of rapture blow,
Or, finding, think them fair —
1 know not if this will be so,
Nor do I greatly care;
I only know I ne’er can know
A Heaven to compare
With Home, and Hearth, and fire aglow,
Arid laughter in the air;
With pipe and book, the warmths that throw
Their comfort on my chair;
The voice I love, so sweet and low,
Of one beside me there,
And the flamelight weaving to and fro
Soft shadows on her hair.

Tom O’Callaghan, who has seen three
police chiefs come and go in Vic. since he
retired, is still vigorous at 78. It is about
13 years since he
went out, and he
has shown that he
was wiser than
some of his ad-
visers by drawing
a pension of £6OO
a year or there-
abouts instead of
taking a lump sum
of £4OOO, as he
might have done.
He is at the city
court daily, and is
as good almost as
an extra P.M. for
the State.
Dean SHANAHAN,
said to be the
oldest 'priest in
Australia. lie
has been at Hamil-
ton (Vic.) for 37
years, and at 87
is still hard at
work.
Vic. Premier Lawson will not be able to
say that McPherson, his deputy, “queered
his pitch” while he was away. Mac never
lets it be forgotten that he is merely No. 2.
Lawson is not keen on a title for himself,
but many will be surprised if he does not
have one cabled to McPherson. It would be
disconcerting to the Treasurer’s economic
soul if it were a baronetcy, since, according
to Stanley Baldwin, Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, the fees and stamp duties tot up
to £270. But it won’t be that.
P.M.G. Gibson can’t draw much comfort
from his predecessors. The office seems to
be a graveyard for the men or their reputa-
tions. Sydney Smith, Philip Fysh, John
Forrest and C. E. Frazer are dead. Hugh
Mahon is outed and politically forgotten, like
J. G. Drake, John Quick. Josiah Thomas and
tfie venerable W. G. Spence. Then there
was Agar Wynne, who wearily retired after
putting a kangaroo on the stamps, while Sam
Mauger has dropped back to private life.
Poynton and Webster were knocked out when
actually holding the office that Gibson is
trying to adorn, and Wise only just escaped
The sole survivor of the P.M.G.’s in the pre-
sent Parliament is Gibson’s colleague Austin
Chapman.
In 40 years Charles McPherson climbed
from pupil-teacher in a Vic. Western Dis-
trict school to Public Service Commissioner
of his State. He quitted teaching for an
office table in the Education Dept., and, after
working up to the highest clerical job,
switched off to the Chief Seeds Department
and became permanent head a trifle over
two years ago. His new job is worth £1250 a
year, and is for seven years. McPherson is only
57. How such an amiable man remained a
bachelor can only be explained by the fact
that hard times struck the Department in
the days when he was young and impres-
sionable.
“T. 0.1.”: That half-crown joke (B.
26/4/’23) with Lady Carrington recalls an
anecdote about Lady Mary Fitzroy, who
was killed in a car-
riage accident at Par-
ramatta in December,
1847. A prominent
ironmonger, soon after
Lady Mary arrived in
Sydney, put in an
appearance at Gov-
ernment House, and.
meeting a personage
whom he took to be
the housekeeper, pre-
sented his business-
card and a £5-note,
expressing the hope
that she would use her
influence to get him
the vice-regal custom.
The “housekeeper,”
who happened to be
Lady Mary in a work-
ing costume, promised
to “think it over.”'
The £5-note was
handed to a charity,
and the ironmonger
was icily informed of
the fact.
Dr. J. B. NASH,
M. of
N. S. Wales.
Dead at 86, Major Z. C. Rennie, who came
years ago from New York to found a branch
of the Mutual of N. Y. Life Co. in Sydney.
Pie gave about £l5OO per foot for the n.-w.
cornei 1 of Pitt-street and Martin-place, where
he built offices. When the co. decided to
abandon the pursuit of new Australian busi-
ness, and retain only what was on its books,
the Major resigned and his son took over the
agency.
According to the Opposition organisers,
Pletherington, ex-Mayor of Brisbane, has
Speaker Bertram cornered in Maree, and the
10 seconds will be counted over his pros-
trarte form next week. But if the argu-
ment had really to be decided with the
gloves, Hetherington wouldn’t be in it. Ber-
tram was amateur middleweight champion
of Queensland in 1899 and 1900, and at 38
he can still go a bit.
“Alastor” : Theodore, Queensland’s Premier,
is a draught-horse for work, and an iron
constitution helps him to pull through trying
times, when his troubles from within and
from without would kill a man less physi-
cally fit. In the midst of a heated debate
Theodore will retire for a half-hour’s nap,
with orders to his Whip to call him should an
emergency arise. He sleeps well in trains,
boats, bush pubs—anywhere. Once he was
caught napping in the House and an
opponent yelled: “Hello, Ted, what will
you have—a general election, eh ?” Theo-
dore, suddenly aroused from a sound sleep,
collected wits enough to reply with a grin:
“No; mine’s a beer.” Pie is still only 39.
From a corner in the Gallery:—
Federal Parliamentary and Treasury officials
wonder whether Earle Page has a home to go to.
He has created a frightful precedent by coming to
work before breakfast and knocking off when he
hears the clang of the last tram;; and all the
10—4.30 tribe reckon that he has delivered a blow
at tradition from which the country will never
recover. Page was ever a toiler—his scholastic
record will tell you that—but he gets so absorbed
in balancing the Commonwealth’s ledger that he
sometimes forgets the existence of the staff, and
may quite unwittingly keep some of them'after hours.
Furthermore, his industry has proved a trial to
the Government chauffeurs, for he is following
Hughes’s and Rodgers’s exciting habit of leaving his
office for the Sydney express at Spencer-street when
it is on the brink of departure. In the Treasury
they yearn for the machine-like routine of Watt.
The present Speaker kept respectable hours, and
was fastidious about the state of his table, whereas
Page works behind a parapet of documents, and he
can only see his staff through a periscope.
There are not many Diggers among the
149 candidates who are scrambling for the
68 contested seats in Queensland Assembly.
One of the little band with badges on their
left lapels is Gilbert Taylour,. who is oppos-
ing Theodore for Chillagoe on the New State
ticket. Taylour was a gunner in France
and Flanders. The United party has given
L. M. Lyons the tough contract of unseat-
ing Payne in Mitchell. Like Roland Green,
who settled the hash of Hughes’s Minister
for Defence, Lyons left a leg on the other
s'de. J. E. "Hatton, U.P. nominee for
Maryborough, laid down the pen for the
bayonet when the trouble was on. But in
Maryborough, likewise, the Labor member
is well dug in.
T. A. Dibbs, the Sydney banker, who died
in March, left £133,680.
Tom Lonsdale, whose rugged eloquence
has often made the Theodore Government
squirm, is tackling Harry Coyne in War-
rego as an independent Laborite. Lons-
dale is a unionist of the old Australian
school, who doesn’t admit that Marx is
God and Lenin his prophet. The West
Queensland teamsters swear by Lonsdale;
but Coyne, though indisputably the least
inspiring member of the Ministry, has about
the safest seat. In 1920 he won by 2507
to 1144. An invincible majority.
George Cowie Morrison, who has just
handed over the Vic. Public Service Com-
missionership, is a parson’s son, and began
to earn his own shoe-leather as an assistant
clerk of courts at Kyneton. Thirty years
ago, when a full-blown senior clerk of
courts, he was made private secretary to
Premier Shiels; a little later he was a P.M.,
then district (metropolitan) coroner, and
permanent head of the Chief Sec.’s dept, in
turn, before he got the P.S.C. appointment
15 years ago. His pension is £Bl6.
“Tay Pay”: W. Geer, R.C. priest, recently
transferred from Mount Carmel to the
Springwood (N.S.W.) ecclesiastical semi-
nary, was formerly an Anglican, and prior to
1912 was at All Saints’ (C. of E.), Wool-
lahra. His change from Canterbury to Rome
caused something of a stir, particularly as
he had given no prior hint of papal sym-
pathy. Pie was not even Pligh Church, and
had only once entered an R.C. chapel—-that
was when the crowds surged into St. Mary’s
to view the remains of Cardinal Moran in
1911. The work of Cardinal Newman —him-
self a ’vert to Catholicism—-apparently
caused the transfer. Archdeacon Geer (C.
of E.) is an uncle.
For the first time in its long life Sydney
Grammar has appointed an “old boy” of its
rival, Sydney High School, as its head-
master. PI. S. Dettmann naturally went first
to Fort-street and then to Sydney High, his
father being a State-school inspector—he was
the senior for many years. The youngster
made a record for Fort-street by being its
dux at 13. Afterwards he went to Sydney
Uni. and Oxford, loaded himself with degrees,
specialised in modern literature, was classics
master at Sydney Grammar for a while, and
then was appointed professor of English at
Christchurch (M.L.). At 48 he can still
play a good game of cricket. Pie was born
at Bathurst (N.S.W.).
Archdeacon Whitington, retiring at 70,
has been nearly everything except bishop in
the Anglican Church in Tas. for about 30
years. He was born in S. Aus., where one
of his brothers was high in the Govern-
ment service and another secretary of the
Jockey Club. He himself was once in the
Register office, where Ernest Whitington,
his nephew, is now chief-of-staff. In the
early ’nineties he was sec. to the Australian
Board of Missions, and went down to malaria
in New Guinea. The doctors said firmly:
“A colder climate,” and it has been Hobart
ever since.
The late Henry F. Shelton, 8.A., shared
with ex-inspector Holland, still going strong
at 80-odd, the distinction of being the most
popular school inspector in Vie. He pioneered
the Wimmera and then moved on to Bal-
larat, where he met W. T. Dimsey, who
waged relentless war upon tobacco and grog
and was a strong Orangeman to boot. Dim-
sey forced a prosecution against Dicky Vale,
M. for smoking in a railway carriage,
and Vale had to choose between forking out
a two-pound fine and going up for a fortnight.
Alec Peacock, the day after he was first
made Minister for Education, was smoking
a cigar on the Ballarat West platform,
when Dimsey hunted up the S.M. Peacock
laughed and chaffed—but finished his smoke
in the drizzle outside. Once the Board of
Advice at Sebastopol reported their head
teacher, the redoubtable reformer, and Shel-
ton, a breezy Irishman and R.jC. who smoked
like a furnace and enjoyed his glass, sat on
the case. He ended up by sitting heavily
on the Board, dismissing the charges as
trumpery and unsustained, and eulogising
Dimsey as a conscientious and successful
teacher, as he was.
“T. 0.1.”: There is at least one daily tra-
veller between the Blue Mountains and Syd-
ney who used the railway when it didn’t go
past Mt. Victoria. He is Crosbie Blake
Brownrigg, an old-time surveyor, now in
his 83rd year. When that remarkable vol-
T. P. BELLOHAMBERS, S. Aus. natural-
ist, who maintains a sanctuary for
native fauna at Humbug Scrub, near
Adelaide.
canic oasis, Mt. Wilson, was surveyed in
the ’sixties, it was Brownrigg who did the
job. The country between Mt. Wilson and
the then railway terminus was terribly
rough, and while making one journey the
surveyor broke a leg and had to be carried
on a litter to the contractor’s camp,, thence
by trolly to Mt. Victoria and by train to
Sydney before the limb could be set. Four
medieoes consulted about it. Two were for
amputation and two against. The noes had it,
and Mr. Brownrigg still owns the leg.
Former 'comrades say that Mick Consi-
dine, ex-M.H.R., was working on the Mel-
bourne wharves recently. Laborites sus-
pect that Michael has his eye on the Mel-
bourne Ports seat when Matthews is finished
with it; but they guess that Tom Walsh is
also casting longing eyes on the same bit
of furniture.
The Under-Treasurership of 8. Aus.,
vacant through H. F. Peacock reaching the
age limit, goes to R. R. Stuckey, at present
Public Actuary. He is 42 and the son of a
brilliant mathematician who, after being sth
wrangler at Cambridge, took up law. The
son has stuck to figures all through, and was
in the A.M.P. before he got the Government
actuarial job in 1914.
John Gale, of Queanbeyan (N.S.W.), kept
his 93rd birthday on April 17. He has five
generations of descendants to his credit,
numbering in all 10S —11 children. 41 grand-
children, 32 great-grandchildren and 24
great-great-grandchildren. The old gentle-
man is still coroner of the district. He was
long associated with the Queanbeyan Age.
and the paper is still in the family’s hands.
G. 11. Sutton, who has just taken the chair
of the Vic. Railways Discipline Board, is one
of the few active relics of the old Hobson’s
Bay Railway Co., which started operations
in the ’fifties with a couple of miles of track
from Melbourne to Sandridge • now Port
Melbourne). Sutton was only a thy or so
with the co. before the Vic. Griyei nmen't took
over the business and him with it. That was
in 1880, and he has been a railway official
ever since.
G. S. Browne, soldier and scholar,
who is vice-principal of Vie. Education De-
partment’s Training College, is a local cham-
pion of the freedom-in-education movement.
He would set the task, but allow the senior
youngsters discretion as to the method of get-
ting through. Cultivation of initiative, aban-
donment of the stereotyped, and thinking “on-
your-own” is the aim. Behind Browne is
the encouragement of the Department, and
experiments are being made by pitting one-
half of a class taught On the old lines with
the other half which explores for itself.
Recently knocked at the doors of the Home
for Incurables, Adelaide, “Ted” Mason, who
engraved illustrations in wood in the early
days of The Bulletin. After many ups
and downs he moved to Adelaide, where he
found employment at. his old calling in_ illus-
trating furniture catalogues and. similar
work ; then he took to painting in oils and
met with a little success. A severe illness
has now led him to the Home.
THE GUSHERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Skies seem brighter when royalties mate,
Maid or man, like the birds in Spring.
Mary’s babe is a stone in weight!
Loud and long let the joybells ring.
Clear and sweet let the minstrels sing.
York to the altar his bride has led!
Care with a cheer to the winds we fling.
But what of the day when the Prince is wed?
Mush and buttermilk by the yard
Over the throbbing cables come.
What’s in your pocket, my bright-browed bard,
Ode or epithalamiugi ?
Leader-writers so grim and glum
Purr as on lioneydew they’d fed.
“Loyal’’ devotion our dailies hum —
What shall we read when the Prince is wed?
Mary’s a mother. Isn’t it great?
“Touch of nature,” etcetera, eh?
York has entered the nuptial state,
As most of us have —or will—or may.
All who love lovers are glad and gay.
Such the eulogies sung and said
That I know not what will be left to say
Or sing (do you?) when the Prince is wed.
Envoy.
Edward Albert, my heart misgives;
With dictionaries from A to Z
Stripped and beggared of adjectives,
Who’ll find the gush when our Prince is wed?

“Parama”: “L.F.S.” (B. 12/4/’2o) wants
to know the record for deep diving in the altogether.
In Torres Strait I’ve had “boys” bring up shell
from 20 fathoms, remaining below for 2min. 34sec.
It was reported that two Darnley Island skin divers,
some years ago, bottomed 30 fathoms off Bramble
Cay while investigating a wreck. There are skin divers
among the Sulu Islanders, about 150 miles east of
British North Borneo, who bring up shell from
25 fathoms, and make no bones about doing it either.
They remain below for anything up to three minutes,
though 2min. 30sec. is the more general time.
Working in the clear water of the sea is an easy
business for them, but I’ve had two of my “boys”
below the surface of a filthy, muddy New Guinea river
clearing yards and yards of wire-like bush vine
from the propeller, around which it had got wound
so tightly that the engine was stopped. These boys
were under for two-minute shifts, and were over
half-an-hour doing the job. Skin divers are at their
best in 10 fathoms and# when remaining below not
longer than 90 seconds. The Torres Strait Islanders
are fond of telling of their diving feats, and talk
of the risks of 10 fathoms being so great that they
“don’t do it now.” They’re an infernal lot of
liars, which fact is too well known for them to hope
to fool any but the very rawest of new arrivals.
* * * *
“Ben” : I’m not boasting about it —merely
stating it as a fact. When 1 was camped on the
Upper Manning (N.S.W.) the howling of a dingo
kept me awake for a couple of nights. The third
night when the brute howled, I picked up my rifle
and let drive at the voice. The howl stopped in the
middle and 1 got a night’s rest. In the morning I
found the body of my noisy friend —a jet black
dingo, half-breed of course—with the bullet fair in
his skull. A bonzer rug, now in the possession of
a Wingham bank manager, kept that dog warm
until my rifle spoke.
* * * »
“Sucre” : Can any Abo. seer explain this?
On Rosenthal station a four-year-old stallion suddenly
went blind. He was promptly segregated by the
manager’s orders, but a young mare, disregarding
discretion and paddock gates, visited him and sub-
sequently bore him a fine healthy son. The day
the youngster drew his first milk ration, the
stallion recovered his sight. And the nearest name
to Hickson on the station was Brown —owned by
the head groom.
* * * *
“Skyrider”: I have made more friends this
summer than I ever dreamed of before, and if the
drought has brought gloom to
many it has had for me its bright
side. ■•Under a walnut-tree in the
back yard I installed a, bath, con-
structed from half a kerosene-tin
cut longways, with (at Mrs. S.’s
suggestion) a brick inside to give
small visitors a chance. Since the
official opening—performed, o f
course, by a willywag—bath
tickets have been issued daily to
thrushes, tits, robins, ring-necks,
and those slate-colored little
warblers which hunt in groups
and roost in dozens on the yellow
box in Spring. The bathers are
becoming so tame that I have to
go out to settle arguments as to
whose turn it is to sit on the wet
brick, and the other day the wife
was waited on by an indignant
scissor-grinder, who wanted to
know why in the world the boss
hadn’t filled the bath before he
left for work. The local council
is talking of putting on restric-
tions presently, but our public
baths will remain open even if I
have to go without my morning tea.
* * * *
"McNag” : The cane gang had just swung
in on the farm, and the cocky’s dog—a big man-
eating brute-—was sniffing round. “By cripes,”
rumbled the ganger, “if that dam’ dog bites me
he’ll die.” “Aw, I dunno,” drawled Cocky, “I’ll
wash his mouth.”
“Six and Eight”: “Jim Carew’s” assertion
(B. 12/4/’23) that in Western N.S.W. binghis
believe it is certain death to handle a living eel is
surprising in view of the widely held belief that
there are no eels in Ma State’s western waters.
At several places on the Dividing Range the distance
between the sources of eastern and western rivers
is only: a few hundred yards, and, while eels abound
in the streams of the eastern slope, in those of the
western not one can be found. Eels breed in the
-'ea at a depth of not less than 500 fathoms, whence
the elvers migrate to the rivers; so the reason sug-
gested for this absence of eels in the Murray-Darling
system is that the mouth of the Murray must, by
some unknown natural law, be closed to elvers. A
parallel European case is the Danube and its tribu-
tary streams, which contain no eels, though they
abound in rivers opening directly into the Mediter-
ranean. The explanation is thought to be that the
Black Sea does not afford a suitable breeding
ground, and that the way through the Dardanelles
is closed by some natural law similar to the one
operating in the case of the Murray-Darling system.
“Eel-fare’’ is the Anglo-Saxon term for the march
or swim of countless millions of, elvers, a little
over two inches in length, which come up from the
sea-depths to the estuaries. They move in a body so
dense that as they reach the narrower parts of the
streams they may he taken out of the water by
merely dipning a bucket into the ranks of the pro-
cession. What do the truthful Abo.-ites (if there
he any) know of eel-fares occurring in Australian
waters ?

do taake.”
“Jimmy Possum”: “Dave Shep” will have
it (B. 8/3/’23) that ploughing and harrowing will
give couch its coup de grace, provided the work is
done at the right time and with the right imple-
ments. Now will “D.S.” kindly let us have the
medicine, with full directions? We had some smart
chaps from Victoria up here (C.Q.) a while back
who were going to show us how to get rid of
“quitch,” as they called it, in two shakes of a rab-
bit’s tail. The poor devils are seeking “fields and
pastures new” elsewhere, but the couch is still with
us. As for Red Natal, it will kill out anything
where it gets a footing, if left to have its fling.
At my own home, which is on volcanic, scrub
land, and where couch grows as if it owned the bally
place, “red top” rules supreme -in a paddock which
had been surrendered to couch. Red Natal is cer-
tainly not a cocky’s joy; but it is a good summer
grass, and is greedily eaten by stock till it seeds.
“Esther Mason”: One more queer acci-
dent ; and it happened under my eyes the other day.
As I was riding into Yetholme (N.S.W.) I saw a
black snake between 4ft. and sft. long, crawling
towards the trunk of a fir-tree. It had just reached
the butt when a fir cone fell from a high branch
and hit the reptile on the head, killing it instan-
taneously. It didn’t give even a final quiver.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: “Ragav” seems surprised
(B. 5/4/’23) because the carpet-snake his kids were
playing with didn’t back out of the hole it was half
in. It didn’t because it couldn’t. Only with diffi-
culty can a snake move backwards, at all, as the
scales catch in the ground, making it a very slow
and tedious job. A wriggler half-way down a hole
and desiring to come out again always turns and
doubles back, except when the hole is too small
then lie has to go right in before he can come out
again. I once grabbed the tail of a small black
snake which was half-way down a hole, and it
doubled back as I have said. I have a nice sear on
the hand as the result.
* * * »
“Mag”: I dunno about records of kan-
garoos shot at one sitting—however long that may
be—but I can tell “Tom Pepper” (B. 12/4/’231
that a few years back in the saltbush country near
Lake Buchanan and Gallilee (C.Q.) a friend of
mine, with a mate, potted 4000 in six months with-
out shifting camp. As 150 skins constituted a
load, and Jericho was 150 miles away, ■ „ is obvious
both Were not shooting all the time. Where the
country had been burnt, and the sweet young grass
had sprouted, it was not uncommon for mobs of
100 and upwards to be seen. The low saltbush
giving a good range of vision, as many as 25
’roos fell to one rifle in a day. Strangely enough,
after wet weather the ’roos became less numerous
in these districts; but, no doubt, in dry weather
the saltbush provided a succulent fodder not pro-
curable anywhere else within eoo-ee.
“W.R.P.”: Tell “Comet” (B. 5/4/’231
that this is the secret of that well-bound stone axe-
head. The gum that exudes from the cypress-pine
is well chewed, then held in a piece of strong hide,
and the string or gut drawn through it. The bind-
ing on of the axehead is done immediately, and the
whole then sets, into a tight and very strong mass
that will last indefinitely. At first the gum is dis-
agreeable and very hard, but when chewed for some-
time breaks up and loses all its taste. It is an
operation that needs to be done out of doors, as the
gum makes the saliva flow in a continual mouth-
filling stream.
“Jim Carew”: I can support “Yarruni”
(B. 5,/4/’23) when he says that the pheasant lays
only one egg each season. When I was a youngster
living on the far South Coast (N.S.W.) I had a
commission to gather pheasant, curlew and plover
eggs for a Yankee collector. With shame I admit
that I robbed upwards of 200 pheasant nests. On
one occasion only did I find a nest containing more
than one egg, and that time the second egg was
not a pheasant’s but a cuckoo’s.
ON TERMS WITH THE PRINCE
“They reckon the Princer Wales never wears
a. suiter clothes maren once.”
“Well, ’e ain’t got nothin' on us. Ours is
a longer once, that's all.”
"F.L.11.”: Ever hear dt a bull being sold
for one shilling? This happened at Bannockburn
(Vic.) the other day, when one of these animals
which was unclaimed and had caused damage by
breaking through fences was impounded. The bob
was the highest bid and the buyer was —a butcher.
(Continued on page 24.)
THE BUCK JUMPERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With calico walls and a sawdust floor,
And a sunburnt girl at the open door
Pointing the way that we were to go,
We found our seats at the buckjump show ;
The seats were solid and cold and bare,
But they let us smoke, so we did not care.
A grey came in with a flying bound
And lashed the rails as he galloped round.
Hey ho! and let her go—
A local horse at the buckjump show !
“Ladies and gents, the show will open with an
exhibition by a local horse. Bill Dempsey in the saddle.”
The grey was vicious and mad with fright,
And nearly blind in the glaring light;
He crossed the ring at a plunging lope,
And squealed and kicked as they pulled the rope.
We gave advice and we gave him cheers
(We’d followed the game ourselves for years).
I ley ho! we clapped and cried:
The horse can buck and the boy can ride.
“The next is Australia’s greatest outlaw. There’s
£5 to anyone tvho cap. ride him for one minute, in
a poly saddle.”
The horse was caught and a bushman came ;
lie was stooped and slight, but his heart was game.
A flying buck and an ugly trip—
We held our breath as he lost his grip.
We did not clap and we did not yell—
The ground was hard where the bushman fell.
But he kept an eye on the flying feet
As he rolled away to a safe retreat.
Hey ho! and a hue and cry
As a steer ckme in with his tail on high.
“A pound for anyone that can ride the bucking
bullock. Come on, yous dairymen.”
HIS ONE FAILING.
"Yes, my dear, it’s a great pity, lie comes from a good
family, hut lie simply can’t keep away from the
hop-vine.”
They fixed the crupper and strained the girth,
And the bullock bellowed and pawed the earth.
“I oughter ho able to ride the cow,”
Said a boy with freckles from chin to brow ;
And he clutched the pommel and grasped the hide,
As he lurched and wobbled from side to side.
He swung his legs and he waved his arms,
As he’d ridden the calves on tlie dairy farms.
Hey ho! and the sawdust flew
As they crashed the rails and he rode him through.
“Fun in the stockyard! Bucking bareback
donkeys, ponies and cattle. Hop right in and have
good Australian sport.”
But they stepped in gingerly, one hy oue,
And most of them rather would watch the fun.
They rode the donkey from rump to ear,
And they swung on the tail of the brindle steer;
And women fainted or screamed aloud
A s their sons went up in a dusty cloud;
And braces broke and shirts were torn
And pants gave way where the seats were worn.
Hey ho ! and let them go.
They rode them fast and they rode them slow.
*•Thanking yer for yer kind patronage, and wishing
yer all a safe journey to yer respective homes, the
performance will conclude .with an exhibition of
stockwhip cracking.” ,
Then slowly he backed across the ring,
Giving the twelve-foot thong a 'swing;
He whirled it high and he twirled it low,
He cracked it fast and he cracked it slow ;
He played a tune with a silken thong,
And he danced a step and he sang a song :
Then he toyed a while with a pair of whips,
And flicked a card from his partner’s lips.
Hey ho! as they closed the show —
We’re, stiff and cold as we rise to go.
“Them horses couldn’t buck l I’d have had that
five quid only I had me good trousers on. So long!
Goo’-night! Goo’-night! Sec yer Sundee.”

“Osric”: I don’t know much about atro-
pine, but not 50yds. from this spot (Richmond River,
N.S.W.) there is a clump of flowering trees, the
juice or dust of which when brought in contact with
the eye dilates the iris just as atropine does. The
trees are there for purely ornamental purposes, and
are inown locally as “trumpet-trees.” Their growth
is limited to about 15ft., they have a soft, pulpy
wood similar to the wild tobacco-bush* and stinging-
tree; they bear large, spatulate leaves of velvety
texture, and the flowers are pendulous and about
the shape of a toy trumpet, lOin. long. The per-
fume of the flowers is heavy and sickly-sweet. Neigh-
boring children play about the clump, and often
PARDONABLE CURIOSITY.
“I see Cohen had a fire the day after he insured.”
“Yes—what was the reason for the delay?”
pluck the flowers to decorate their cubby-houses.
The first intimation given me that there was some-
thing peculiar, if not dangerous, about the trees
was when I saw an excited group of mothers and
children at one flower-strewed cubby, and two of
the children were proudly exhibiting what they called
“big, black eyes.” One eye only of each child was
affected, and the iris in each case was totally dilated.
I warned the mothers, but the youngsters persisted in
playing about the clump, and there have been three
additional “big’, black eyes” since. A little time
ago my father, in order to extend a fence, had to
cut some of the trees down, and shortly after he
found the focus of his right eye all askew. We
packed him off to the town and doctor, but on his
arrival there the iris was almost normal again. The
specialist said he had never heard of such a thing
being brought about in the manner I have described ;
so what does the Council think about it? Is it
atropine, or have I discovered the source of a similar
drug? Anyway, pending some learned opinion, and
providing I can keep the kids out of their cubbies.
I shall allow the trees to stand for a while. Possibly
I shall find myself in the midst of unexpected afflu-
ence through the marketing of a drug that will
literally open the eyes of the public.

“Pat Bushie”: It pleased me to read
“Macgee’s” testimony to the excellent quality of the
flesh of an old friend —the fresh-water catfish (B.
5/4/’23). A good way to remove the skin is to dip
him in boiling water, then bring a pair of pliers
into action—the skin rips off easily. From lOin. up
they are splendid eating - , and even a steak of an
“old man” is toothsome. The flesh is beautifully
white and firm. Even the most finicky diner will
lelish this fish if its identity is not disclosed.
“The Overlander”: A contractor on Olive
Downs station (Nor’-West N.S.W.) has for a
pet a chocolate-brown crow, and would not
part with the bird for King Solomon’s mines.
He is the first of the color that anyone ever
remembers seeing around here. “H.S.K.”
(B. 22/3/’23) says his brown cocky must
be a cross between white and black cockatoos.
Well, what the deuce is the parentage of this
chocolate Kelly?
“Exul”: Tell “Molokihi” (B. 5/4/’23),
who has a kindly feeling for Papuan murderers, that
his opinion of this class of gent, is shared by
Havelock Ellis, who says, “Murderers are not
usually the most degraded of criminals or the most
dangerous to society.” He quotes Kropotkin:—
Eastern Siberia is fifll of liberated assassins, and
nevertheless there is hardly another country where
you could stay with greater security; while unceas-
ing robberies and murders take place precisely
throughout Western Siberia whereto no murderers and
only minor offenders are exiled. It was not un-
common to find at an official’s house that the coach-
man was a liberated murderer, or that the nurse
who bestowed such motherly care upon the children
bore imperfectly obliterated marks of the branding-
iron.
And Mr. Davitt is also quoted:—
The really hardened criminal will never commit
a murder. Murder deliberately planned is ordinarily
the offspring of the passions of revenge and jealousy,
or the outcome of social or political wrongs; and is
more frequently the result of some derangement of
the nobler instincts of human nature than traceable
to its more debased orders or appetites.

“Aide de Camp”: Let me give evidence
for old Jack. Donald
MacDonald sums up
the kookaburra as an
unqualified scoundrel—
a robber of nests and
a murderer. He isn’t.
1 caught a young Jack
with a view to intro-
ducing them into the
Speck and hung him
in a cage in a Vic.
garden. A pair of
kookaburras nesting in
a tree in the garden
had evidently lost the
“tally stick,” for they
thought my youngster
was one of theirs, and
proceeded to feed him
through the bars. The
garden had at least a
hundred nests of small
birds, some with eggs
and some with young ;
but Mr. MacDonald’s
murderers did not feed
one egg or one small
bird to the foster-child
—the menu was en-
tirely khakii-beetl es
and frogs. After keep-
ing the bird for a
couple of weeks, during
which he got free
board from the old
•Tacks, I let him go be-
cause I couldn’t get a
pair. The last I saw
of him he was up a
dead tree with a frog’s
leg hanging out of his
beak, and the old ’tins
were enjoying; the joke.
His real parents didn’t
let on —and they still
chuckle over how they
got out of rearing that
son
"Dimederra”: “L’Fou” (B. 5/4/’23)
wouldn’t have ruined the varnish on the legs of his
safe if he had tacked rabbit skin (furry side out)
round them instead of standing them in tins of
water. Ants have a strong objection to crossing
fur of any kind, and I’ve suggested rabbit as it’s
the cheapest. Which reminds me. Our pommy cook
once asked the missus what she could do to stop
the ants getting into the safe. The missus suggested
tins of water, and handed him four. Later on,
there being no decrease of the pest, we inspected
and found the tins placed in a neat row under the
safe.
* * * *
“FY7”: Good as “Barcoo’s” barramundi
is as a table fish (B. 5/4/’23) I refuse to admit it
is superior to the Murray cod. If “Barcoo” is a
fisherman on his name river or the east coast, one
can forgive him his prejudices, for there are no eod
in the Barcoo. Not the least of the barramundi's
attractions are his beauty and his fine fight-
ing qualities. There is no finer fresh-water
game fish, and he is easily taken on spinning tackle.
As he is a powerful fish and runs to big weights he
deserves as much attention from Australian big-
game fishers as the inedible tunny, Spanish mackerel
and others.
SAFETY FIRST.
LORRYMAN : “ ’Ere,
wot’s yer game,
jamming a bloke
into the side of
the cliff? Git
over a bit.”
“Bad Australian”: “Yarrum”(B. 5/4/’23)
is on a sure thing when he bets that the “pheas-
ant’s” (lyre-bird’s) nest has one egg in it at a time.
I spent nearly a decade wandering around the Aus-
tralian Alps with a prospecting outfit, and although
I examined hundreds of nests I never found - one
containing more than one egg or a solitary chick.
“Yarrum’s” observations over such a long period
would appear to establish the interesting fact that
the lyre-bird’s eggs produce male and female in
alternate years, and that the same nest is occupied
in each succeeding year. This is not borne out by
my experience. I have found the adult females
greatly in excess of the males, and I have seen many
nests abandoned after the first year. Incidentally, it
would be of interest to know how “Yarrum” deter-
mined the sex of the fledglings. Personally, I could
never detect the slightest difference in the chicks,
although it is so pronounced in the older birds.
» * * *
“D.F.”: All the Australian lies about tre-
mendous journeys on horseback are easily outclassed
by a performance attributed by Ossendowski, in his
just-published “Beasts, Men and Gods,” to an old
Mongol named Tzeren. He says that. Tzeren rode
from Uliassutai to Peking, 1800 miles, in nine days,
doing 200 miles a day. He bound his abdomen,
chest, legs, arms and neck with
strong cotton-bandages to protect
himself from strains and stress.
He rode at full gallop, with
plenty of fresh horses, for 17
or 18 hours a day. Then he ate
a leg of boiled mutton and slept
for a few hours. Five times a
day he drank tea.
* «■ »
“Donalbain”: As a rule
the Australian abo., unlike the
Maori, was a mighty poor navi-
gator. It is true that there is
a recorded instance of piracy on
the part ; of the abos. In Governor
Hunter’s time they put out into
Broken Bay in their canoes and
: plundered a boat carrying maize
from the Ilawkesbury to Sydney.
But seems to have been a
solitary case.' Nevertheless, one
half-caste abo., William Chase-
land, gained a great reputation
for resource, skill and daring
among the bay whalers around
Maoriland in the ’thirties. His
most noted exploit was to steer a
whaleboat from the Chatham? to
Otago Harbor, across 500 miles of
stormy sea. As a harpooner and
boat-steerer he was second to none
among the hard-bitten crowd
which worked the stations round
the South Island. Curiously,
William Lanne, the last pure-
blooded male Tasmanian, was a
whaler. And in later days one
of the smartest whalers at Twofold
Bay (N.S.W.) was an abo. or part abo. —Charlie
Green.
* * * »
“Jim Carew” : Can any Abo. explain the
use of the small cup-like nest that the tomtit builds
on. top of its nest? The tomtit usually fashions a
big, ragged nest with a tiny opening in its side in
the heart of a prickly bush, and then on top adds
this small cup-like structure, which it lines as cosily
as its own nest. Bird-observers put forward many
reasons for it. Some say it is for the use of the
male when the female is sitting ; others say that it
is to prevent cuckoos laying in the real nest. But I
have examined many tomtits’ nests, and I've never
found a cuckoo’s egg in the top receptacle, nor have
I ever seen a tomtit in it.
* * • «
“Jimmy Possum” : If Herb Gates, of Wil-
eannia (N.S.W.), shot over 300 ’roos in one week
(B. 22/3/’23), I’ll swear he never skinned ’em
nor pegged out' the pelts. The peeling of an old-
man ’roo is half-an-hour’s job for the average shooter,
though an expert may do it in less than half the
time. I have known a bear-shooter collect 40 pelts
in a day; but the animals were mostly skinned
before they had ceased to breathe. A Too-shooter
has to wait until the quarry has kicked the bucket
before getting busy with the knife, otherwise he
might come to grief. . An average of 10 pelts a
day is about the limit in virgin kangaroo country.
“W.D.G.”: Wliat’s the proper tucker for
blue-tongue or shingle-back lizards? Some time ago
1 threw $ lot of them out of wire-netting rabbit-
traps on the border fence, and they all started to
eat wild flowers. Perhaps being shut up had made
them dilly—or are flowers and herbage their natural
food ?
» * * #
“P.X.”: A. S. Le Souef, of the Sydney
Zoo, is on the tracks of a new beast. It is a marsu-
pial cat —the name has been only tentatively
adopted—and it is now fairly definitely known to
exist in some remote parts of North Queensland.
But it is possible that it prowled over
a much wider area. The Zoo enthusiast
was out at Widgiewa, in Western Riverina,
the other day arranging for the capture
of a few kangaroos in the wild-life sanc-
tuary (stop here for a minute to give
three cheers for the Falkinefs), and was
told by two old hands that they had seen
similar cats in that country. Indepen-
dently they gave a description of the ani-
mal, which coincided with that of the
N.Q. “marsupial cat”—bigger-bodied than
the wild or native eat, and dark-striped
instead of spotted. Now a plaintive cry goes up to
the Far West (N.S.W.) for further information,
lias anybody else seen the striped cat? When?
Where?
A wide selection :
“Coot’’: Tell “11. M.” (B. 12/4/’23), who asks
the origin of “So long,” meaning; “Good-bye,” that
many philologists aver it is a sailor’s perversion of
“Salaam.’’ Others trace it to the German “So
lange.” Walt Whitman in one of his poems remarks:
“1 whisper ‘So long,'
And take the young woman’s hand
... .for the last time.”
“Ragar”: The first time 1 heard “So long” was
years ago over in S’Afriea. Iruanswer to my question
as to what was meant 1 was told that it was a
short cut for “It’ll be so lona till we meet again.”
“Ye Smidd” : “So long” is probably a corruption
of the French “Nous allons,” meaning “We go.”
“Russ”: “So long” is a corruption of the old
“sing along,” typifying the old-time bushnur,
who as they trudged from place to place sang to
themselves for company.
“Sucre”: “Nod Ivolly” (B. 10/3/’23)
mentions a colony of birds which got advice about
the approaching collapse of their roost. Years
ago at Elbow Valiev (S.Q.) I was kangaroo-shooting.
ENGOURAGEMENT.
THE PARSON : “I preach, ’nd I preach, hut it doesn’t
affect the congregation here at alt. I’m afraid
they’re a wooden-headed lot!”
THE PARISHIONER : “Yon keep on with yer preachin’.
Wood can’t resist dry rot for ever.”
Tired of tramping, I sat with my back to a large
deceased ironbark tree. Suddenly I felt a tremor
pass through the giant. I grabbed my gun, and
did evens for 50 yards. Nothing happened while I
waited, but at sundown, six hours later, the trea
fell with a crash that stopped my watch. “Ned
Kelly’s’’ birds got the same warning as I did— ‘
through contact.
A LIFT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where grey miles stretch from west to west,
And red miles run to the north,
Where mirages gleam in a mocking jest
When broken men set forth,
It's a weary trudge through burning days
For the wrecks on the human drift,
Yet their hearts grow light when someone says,
“Get up, mates; have a lift.”
It may he lie comes in a motor-car
That is worn and nearly done,
For wild are the roads that travel far
On the track of the setting sun.
It may be he drives in a creaking dray,
And his horses are hard to shift,
But the shadows break when he stops to say,
“What ho, mates, have a lift.”
Where red miles stretch from north to north,
And grey miles run to the west,
There are broken wanderers faring forth
To walk on the roads unblest.
And hard is the trudge ’neath the burning sky
On the ebb of the human drift,
And hardest when someone passes by,
But offers them never a lift.
Oh, this is the way of the old bush code
That is stronger than change or fate,
When man meets man on the lone, long road,
It shall be as mate meets mate.
And though on one the dark fates frown.
The other shall count it his gift
To call to him who is broken and down,
"Get up, mate; have a lift.”
VICTORIA.

AWAY IN THE BUSH
is where tyres are put to the test. Rough
tracks, and in many instances rough driving,
soon determines the worth and value of a
cover and its suitability for hard service “out
back.” With the nearest garage scores of
miles away one needs and looks for depend-
ability, and it does not take the average
country motorist long to find out which make
best stands up to requirements. In all parts
of Australia “ Railroad ”
are far and away the most popular. You see

Another anniversary of Anzac Day has
slipped through the reverent fingers of Aus-
tralia like the bead of a rosary through a
devotee’s nand. In the sweeping sheets of
rain on that morning mothers, fathers, sisters
and lovers made their way to memorial ser-
vices. In the city St. Andrew’s, St. Mary’s
and Town Hall were packed. To the Town
Hall maimed men and army nurses were led,
where, glimpsing the laurel wreaths, the
rosemary and the flags brooding, as it were,
over all, they wondered maybe why we should
mourn the dead who, having written a
glorious Q.E.D. to life’s problem, crumble
to laughing dust in French pasture or above
ADgean Seas. To the maimed soldier remain
the pain of old wounds, the torture of gas
upon corroded lungs, the soul-scar, and the
unanswered puzzle of how to make both ends
meet in a world nearly a decade past that
proud storming of Gallipoli.
In the evening the Town Hall was
crammed with returned men and soldiers’
relatives, all with something of the air that,
in attending the mbnster Anzac Night con-
cert, they were concluding the ritual
of a day whose afternoon had included
the service at the Woolloomooloo Wharf
gates. There was something very touch-
ing about the huge audience, listening
v -th approval to each item on the long pro-
gramme. Perhaps Roderic Quinn’s Anzac
verse and Will Ogilvie’s “Bravest Thing God
Ever Made,” as interpreted by Lawrence
Campbell, got a louder hand from mother
and father than even Gerardy or Lauder;
but there’d be no jealousy coming from
either quarter because of that, for is not
one himself a soldier and the other a sol-
dier’s father?
Adam MeCay’s verse on the programme
cover deserves a special word. There is as
throat-gripping a quality about the first two
stanzas as there is in the much-quoted
Segur’s “I Have a Rendezvous with Death.”
A simple dignity hard to beat pulses in the
Australian’s opening lines:—
Now over every head
The ferns and grasses sway,
Soon to be gold and red
When April meets with May:
Bat underneath the flowers they keep
no holiday.
Before next Anzac Day we might decide
what we ought to do with our flags on the
great anniversary. Last week, if there were
three staffs in a row, one would be sure to
be bare; from the second a flag would flutter
at half-mast; the third would fly the proud
banner of a nation’s birth. What Anzac Day
is we haven’t yet decided. And if only for
the sake of tidiness, we ought to. Are we
supposed to be sad or glad?
At Ivurnell on Saturday the landing of
Captain Cook, R.N., had another anniver-
sary; and there was another tame little
ceremony. We can’t do these things like
our cousins, Uncle Samuel’s demonstrative
children. Chief Justice Cullen was there;
Joseph Carruthers, of course; the large and
genial Judge Cohen; and hon. sec. Stilling,
under the brim of a shiny top hat. There
was a note of sincerity in the Gov.-General’s
voice as he spoke of his “intense love” for
Australia. As he orated her Ex. held her
lord’s hat till a glittering aide got posses-
sion of it. The Cullen lady brought her pink
cheeks and.' blue eyes. Lands Minister
Wearne made suitable references to the hero
of the occasion, and the words of Cullen,
C.J., were heavily rained upon. The G.-G.
“broke” the flag; buglers sounded the
reveille; and the Anzac, moored as near as
time; and tide permitted to the Endeavor’s
anchorage, fired a salute.
Lady Forster flung wide the doors of the
drawing-rooms at Admiralty House the
other afternoon in the interests of the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital. In spite
of pouring rain the roll-call in response to
secretary Mona Daley’s rally was almost up
to a theatrical first-night, and the very best
furs in Sydney (amphibious, ambiguous and
jungle-born) were sleekly complacent in the
comfortable chairs and lounges about the
president’s table. Later, when Lady Forster,
radiant in leaf-brown satin and lace, led the
meeting into the right paths and expressed
everybody’s thanks to Dalgety’s for the
loan of the Ceramic for the ball, offers
of service popped out of every mouth
as eagerly as corks from bottles of
sparkling burgundy. Mrs. Tony Hordern,
a double string of pearls finishing off her rich
upholstery, agreed to be joint secretary with
Mona Daley; and Denison Miller has prom-
ised to look after the takings. The Waley
lady, who wasn’t present because of a
sprained ankle, is to be another heavyweight
on the committee. The Empress of Sar-
gent’s offered the firm’s rooms for a bridge
party to be arranged by Mrs. Monty Severn.
There are to be posters and exhibition dances,
and what all, till the ball sounds as though
it will be like an Asche production. Judge
Backhouse, being the president of the
Motherhood establishment, said the usual
happy things: the only other male present
spoke no word at all. And then there was
a wonderful afternoon tea, with the G.-G.’s
lady hostessing, and just one aide helping.
Enid Douglas married Dr. Curtis Elliot at
St. Mark’s a week ago, in the presence of
nearly 200 guests. Tall Enid James, in
flame-colored, embossed velvet upholsterings,
followed the froth of georgette and satrn that
made up the bride’s apparel. Peter Murphy
stood by the bridesmaid to see the principals
through ; and later on the bride performed an
operation on the wedding-cake to the satis-
faction of her medical husband at her Belle-
vue Hill home.
One of the week’s prettiest weddings hap-
pened at St. James’s in the midst of the
showers, Bessie Wilson, of Bondi, figuring
as bride to Norman Richards, of St. Kilda
(Vic.). Embossed ivory velvet and silver
lace formed the wedding dress, which drew
a long wake of velvet train glistening with
crystal drops. The bride’s sister Nellie, also
in ivory velvet, bore the train with conscious
pride, while Andree Leverrier and Lilian
Norrie carried out the vellum effect in
velvet and silver tissue. Four small girls
strewed the bridal path with rose petals.
Pianist Frank Hutchens was best man, and
Mrs. Goossens-Viceroy sang “Beloved, It Is
Morn” while the marriage lines were being-
handed into the bride’s keeping. The honey-
moon will raise her lamp above England and
its not very neighborly Continent.
Talking about appropriate wedding music,
a recent announcement was to the effect
that while the register was being signed Mr.
Cocks sang “Beloved, It Is Morn!”
“Manie” Gorman, of Corowa, gave her
promise to Edward Macpherson, of Nhill
station, at St. Mary’s in her home town,
last week, in the presence of half the dis-
trict. The bride carried all the white splen-
dor demanded by the occasion, and had two
bridesmaids and a trainbearer to help her
through.
Katherine Bliss Wilkinson (it isn’t every-
one who has a middle name like a benedic-
tion), who owns up to Strathfield as her
abiding place, has just promised herself and
the sunshine of her smile to Joseph Palmer
Abbott, son of the late knight, and step-
brother to writer J.H.M.
With violinist Daisy Kennedy for mother
and pianist Moiseiwitsch for father, it’s no
wonder that
the small
Tata n i a is
proving some-
thing of a
musical pro-
dig y. Two
years ago
father sent the
youngster a
little harp
from America:
in less than
three months
she could play
pieces such as
the Brahms
Waltz in A
Flat just from
having heard
father play it
on the piano.
But the piano
is to be her
instrument.
&he loves it, and is already studying it.
Bessie Robertson, who gave a brilliant
performance in the Conservatorium this
week, was a student of Carreno in Berlin
for three years, spending her summers under
Madame’s wing in Switzerland or Bavaria.
Even in Berlin Bessie heard of Doris Bar-
nett, the clever Sydney girl, who was then
studying with Godowsky, and who afterwards
became assistant teacher to the great man.
Since her return to her home town Bessie
has studied under Doris’s guidance; and the
achievement of the woman-taught artist is
enough to make the Feminist banner let out
another reef or two for pride.
The Polo Balls will be the big midwinter
nutter, and the Wentworth the scene thereof.
So great has been the demand for tickets
that the original one ball has growm into
two, and the price has popped up to a
guinea for the first event and 15s. for the
second. All the polo world is helping, and
as the takings go to the multiplying of the
splendid Bush Nurses, the Country Women’s
Association deserves every dancing-man and
woman’s help. The committee includes the
vice-regal lady, who is its president; and the
G.-G. Forsters are spreading their plume of
approval over the good endeavor.
Dame Margaret proved she knew some-
thing of the Outposts of Empire when the
Victoria League gave the first of its monthly
afternoons. To the assembly-room of the
Women’s Club, on the seventh floor of Stan-
way House, the lift developing a stop-work
attitude for the occasion, climbed that layer
of Sydney Select who form the league. Those
who didn’t faint by the way heard a charm-
ing discourse on the Seychelles and iVewfound-
land (accent thrown back), both of which
stirring centres Sir Walter'has Excellencied.
One couldn’t help thinking when the lady
mentioned a camp-out in the Doggy Country,
when she slept with four blankets below and
six above, her feet, head and hands swathed
individually, what a Turkish bath some of
our February days must seem to her.
This lady was the world-famous Godowsky’s
assistant-teacher during six years. Her
name is Doris Barnett, and she is one of
Sydney’s own.
The brilliant
girl was one
of Sydney
Moss’s pupils
before migrat-
ing to Vienna
and the studio
of Godowsky.
The big man,
recognising her
qualities, made
her his assist-
an t teacher.
Then came the
war, and
Doris flew to
America, and
she has a
mountain o f
glowing press-
notices that
appeared after
her first reci-
tal in New
York. This last week or so Rieke Parker
and Bessie Robertson, who have both worked
with her since their return from Europe,
have given successful concerts at the Con-
servatorium.
The Repertory Society held its first shivoo
of the season in the almost conventual atmo-
sphere of the Women’s Club during last
week-end. There was a lank, dank, tea-leaf
feeling about the first part, as though the
evening’s sodden greyness had crept in and
taken the permanent wave out of even
Gregan McMahon’s spirit. Eleanor Ross
told a Leacock story in her inimitable way,
and was rewarded by wavelets of blonde
laughter, whereas if moon and stars had
been shining a full-blooded brunette roar
would have thundered ashore. Una Black,
flashing pink taffetas and a pretty bowing
arm, tried to fiddle some cheer into the even-
ing ; and soprano Ella Goodman and pianist
Walter Thormann did their best. Then the
night did begin to lift its drooping head, and
people gathered into groups and talked as
one human being to another. The diminu-
tive Mrs. Willie McMillan and Miss Tildes-
ley hostessed, Mrs. Willie vivid in rust-
colored frocking and Miss Tildesley in shell-
pink embossed gorgeousness that brought out
the quality of her English pink-and-white-
ness. Playwright Mrs. Margaret Dale was
there; also Miss Hiscocks, who banked the
Telegraph prize-money for her play, “The
Spirit of Desire.”
“Lady Patricia,” which might just as well
have been called “Nuts and May” or “How
the Peerage Does It,” was staged at the
Conservatoriurn on Friday and Saturday in
the interests of the Rawson Institute. The
G.-G.’s and a bunch of society’s choicest
blooms attended the first performance, and
a bunch of society’s e.b.’s and the State
Exes, came to the second. The cast was
small, and included a group of earnest
people whose intentions were w T orthy if their
lines were inaudible. Whatever the Rudolf
Besier comedy was like in its London pro-
duction, Saturday night’s performance
turned what was intended for a bubble into
a lead sinker, Barbara Knox changed her
frock four times as Lady Patricia, and re-
clined gracefully on a lounge-chair during
most of the first act.
With the deaths of C. F. Bunz and Her-
bert Bloy there snapped two strings in
Maoriland’s musical bow. Bunz was a Dane
whose fingers were taught the way they
should go over the piano by the celebrated
Lagenbuch. Subsequently he became master
of the Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry Band
and leader of various musical societies.
Bloy, one time member of the Queen’s Hall
Orchestra under Sir Henry Wood, was a
first-rate violinist, conductor and composer,
besides being a black-and-white artist and
an architect.
Alfred lekerson, of Mosman, one of the
victims of a sensational motor accident on
the Windsor-road, was by profession a sur-
veyor, but of late years had dealt success-
fully in land. He was well preserved for
his 63 years, and was of the quiet, kindly
nature that attracts and holds friendships.
lekerson was a keen bowler, and nlayed with
Mosman for many years. His wife, who was
also in the smash, sustained a gruesome list
of injuries, and is still perilously ill.
The j crowds that drifted up to Rupert
Bunny’s show on Wednesday came upon a
case of oxidised silverware from Mildred
Creed's clever fingers. Delicately-wrought
spoons and table implements and a quaint
old-fashioned tea measure drew the house-
wifely eye while father was measuring, up
how much Bunny canvas he could fit into
the new bungalow.
Island novelist Beatrice Grimshaw is back
in Sydney with a portfolio of photographs
taken by her in the old head-hunting country
of New Guinea. But they were all purchased
ahead by George Newnes, so Australia can’t
see them. Intrepid Beatrice came back from
London, where she was quite a lion in the
lecturing world, by way of Burma, the Fed-
erated Malay States and Java, and combed
them all for copy The Celebes and Moluccas
held her sponge-bag for some months, and
a ruined palace in Termate was her headquar-
ters —a cheerful specklet of volcanic origin
encircled by 10 other equally temperamental
islands. In Dutch New Guinea the lady
had to charter a 90-ton steamer to get away.
Her last port of call was the mandated
Territory and the Sepik River. Port Mores-
by will mark the full stop of the Odyssey;
and then the lady pulls out a writing-pad
and starts in on a three years’ output which
has been marketed in advance.
Walter Jardine, the decorative artist who
did so much to teach the Australian that his
hosannas to the peanut or whatever else he
wants to sell needn’t be a mere wilderness
of type, has been tickling San Francisco.
(Uncle S.’s millions called him last year.)
His description of the Californian girl has
been quoted and re-quoted : “A flash of old
Spain; a touch of Anglo-Saxon calm; a
rare combination of poise and vivacity;
floral complexioned, lissom, sun-warmed; a
child of Nature she, versed in the highest arts
of modern civilisation.'' “Gee!” says the
’Frisco Examiner. “This artist will get on
in the world. Any man with such a gift
of blarney will.” Laryngitis has been keep-
ing him in California during the winter;
then he’s for N’York.
St. Paul Collegians want the reminder
whispered abroad that their college is hold-
ing its glad annual dance on June 6. .
(Mrs.) Dr. Maud Fere, of Christchurch
(M.L.), is on a holiday visit to Dr. Ethel
Sands, at Manly.
A Brisbane postscript:—
The Pitt Rivers lady and Dr. McDonnell are
sheltering at the Governors mia-mia, and the other
night his Ex. fed Premier Theodore and his wife,
just back from raking the State for votes.
Brisbane Club president Kennedy and his wife
said how-d’ye-do to a big crowd on the 26th, m
celebration of the Duke of York’s wedding day,
though exactly, why it should be so celebrated wasn’t
made Clear. The rain rushed down, but inside
there were a saxe-blue lattice, flags and African
daisies, Dobbyn’s jazz band and a good spread, to
keep out the cold. Sir Matt had Mrs. Pitt Rivers,
in black chantilly, under his wing, with Captain
Hammond guarding the rear. The president’s wife,
also in black, clutched a collection of roses and
gerberaS, and a black osprey quivered in her hair.
Pretty Mrs. J. L. Woolepek’s bright complexion was
set off by almond-green. Emily Bulcock trailed
regal black velvets. Mrs. Robert Thompson chose
pink.
With Sir Alfred Pickford, Mrs. Pitt Rivers and
Dr. vEneas McDonnell shadowing him, Sir Matt well
and truly laid the foundation-stone of the Boys’
Grammar School memorial library what time Cap-
tain Hammond gazed thoughtfully upon a throng
of archbishops, major-generals, colonels, canons,
judges, doctors, mere headmasters, lovely ladies and
the Mayor of Brisbane. Prince Alfred laid the
foundation-stone of the old school in 1869, and the
same old bottle was served up for the new library,
stuffed with a history of the war, its own biography,
a school report, and list of volunteers.
The Voice that Breathed recently linked two
Queensland pioneer families, McManus and Loughnan.
The bride was Gem McManus, whose aunt was the first
white woman to settle in Western Queensland, and
she wrote “Early Days on the Maranoa” to emphasise
the fact. W. H. McManus, of Mount Lonsdale (now
gathered to his fathers), was the bride’s daddy,
and Mrs. C. J. White, of Mitchell, is her mother
Ray Loughnan, of Mitchell, was the ’groom. The
bride was in white brocade and silver; Joyce Atkin-
son and Lily Loughnan helped in pink taffetas.
Fifty were fed like one at the Coo-ee by the H. L.
Whites, and the bride started off south in blue
marocain and a black satin cape.
The overdue rainy season poured its friendly vials
over the Uni. students for Commem. Day. It was
all very well for the men undergrads—they could
have “a couple to warm them,’’ but the girls—
girls in Brisbane don’t. And the airy costume of
one sweet young graduate, who jazzed cheerfully,
invited pneumonia. Rain has dispersed armies
ere this.
Brisbane’s intellectuals met to hear Tom Heney
celebrate Shakspeare’s Day with an address in the
School of Arts hall. Wild flowers surrounded a
bust of the Bard, and the programme was strictly
and ethereally Shakspeare, with not even a smell
of Bacon about it.
Queensland University, struggling to widen its
activities, has been given substantial help by Dr.
J. O. Mayne’s gift of 700 acres of farm land. It
is at the junction of Moggill Creek with the Brisbane
River, and is said to be just the thing for experi-
mental purposes. A chair of Agriculture is now
almost in sight.

A futuristic outfit of tango, blue and jade
green that detracted from Stella Power’s
youthfulness at her first concert was happily
replaced by a fairy-queen frock and head-
dress last Saturday. The comely little song-
stress was every way more winsome. She
combined the almost "regal with the wholly
festive—smiled much, made her bow with
sharp and sudden inclinations from the
waist, and kissed her hands freely to the
multitude. The air of enjoyment suited
Stella admirably, and if she didn’t really
revel in her work she must already have
mastered the platform art that usually dis-
tinguishes the middle-aged. If her apparent
tirelessness caused a few envious sighs from
old-time singers in the audience, the windy
suspirations of forced breath, as Hamlet
called them, had no malice in them. Stella
Power makes no pretence of abnormal sweet-
ness. She is just pleasant and young and
careless of her speech when she announces
the name of the song she is going to sing
for an encore. The big original Melba can
talk beautifully when she likes, but her
“little - ’ protegee has a natural asperity of
utterance which she doesn’t trouble to soften
thus far. Louder, but much more rounded,
was the speech of an impressive manager
who came on the platform after 9 o’clock
and called upon a certain member of the
Tramways Board to come from the audience
to the artists’ room to answer an prgent tele-
phone message. Whereupon everybody won-
dered whether some more tramway strike
was about to begin, and two nervous souls
lied precipitately.
Lieut.-Gov. William Irvine’s elder daugh-
ter, Beatrice, is engaged to an Apple Islander,
one James Morrison, whose dad s homestead,
St. Peter’s Pass, is at picturesque Oaklands.
The bride-elect is a good-looker, with high-
brow tendencies which have been strength-
ened by a ’Varsity training, but she has a
nice, unsidey personality which earned her
much popularity at the ancient seat of
learning.
Lady Forster was hostess in absentia at
the Anzac Day memorial service for mem-
bers of the Sailors and Soldiers’ Friendly
Union in the Government House ballroom.
The Chauvel lady, in a sombre dress with
a white leopard-skin athwart her shoulders,
sat in the gold and plush throne, with the
Cressw'ell and Bridges dames and other com-
mittee members grouped around the dais.
The gathering, 600 strong, mostly wore next-
of-kin badges on black frocks. Ex-Padre
MacCrae Stewart did the necessary talking,
and a comforting message from Lady For-
ster, w T ho lost two sons in the war, was read
and replied to. Tea was handed round
between musical items arranged by Theophi-
lus Roberts and Mrs. Selheim, the per-
formers including Irene Certo, little Zoe
Allison, Mabel Philips and Isabel Langlands.
Each guest w'as handed a sprig of rosemary
as a memento. General Coxen’s wife and a
fair-haired daughter were busy with the tea-
pots ; so were Mrs. Teddy Downes and her
youthful-looking mother, the Arthur Robb
matron.
John Longstaff, now' in Melbourne helping
to choose the Vic. brushmen’s work for the
show of Australian art in London, is still
almost incredibly young in his w r ays. Not
long before he left Sydney he spent an even-
ing with everyone’s sweetheart, Miss Rose
Scott, w'ho “mothered” this perpetual boy in
the most approved manner. There’s a fine
old lady in Victoria who claims the first
place w'heu John is in the Cabbage Patch.
The artist’s mother is 90. Of the lad’s tender
heart in his knickerbocker days a fond
mothers tells a tale of birds that vanished
mysteriously out of their cages. And John
w'as always somewhere near when it hap-
pened.
Keith, the medical soil of the H. J.
Parkers, of Manly, with his pal, Dr. Harold
Thomas, came across from Sydney to seal
his matrimonial contract with the George
Crespins’ chick Marjorie. The scene was
South Yarra Christ Church. The bride had
sacrificed symbolism to spectacular effect by
substituting amber curtainings for virginal
white. Her bridal satin, enmeshed with
silver, w'as fortified with georgette and a
suspicion of Garrickmacross lace on the
upper storey. Orange blossoms clamped her
tulle veil and trickled dowm the edge of her
silver-lined tail-piece, w'hich was proudly
carried by two adorable infapts, Mar-
garet and Harvey Gunnerson, the latter
suited in velvet to match his sister’s yellow
georgette frock. The bride was followed by
three amber-clad maids—one yellow, one yel-
lower, the other yellowest—who suggested
vivid patches of sunshine. The trio flew
winged sleeves of georgette with their maro-
cain drapings, and were hatted in black
velvet. Godfrey Darling and Geoff Crespin
helped Dr. Thomas to see that the bride-
groom held up. The health-drinking feast
was spread at No. 9 Darling-street, where
Mrs. Crespin hostessed in blue silk, with an
underskirt of black and gold and a black
hat that had a jet decoration leaning over
its front balcony. Mrs. Parker glittered in
moonlight beads, backed by black, and
feathers nodded from her hat. All the best
Civics were there, of course, and the Gaud
Mayor and Alderman Cabena gave a hand at
the speech-making. Parson Roscoe Wilson,
who tied the knot, handed the bride an ivory-
bound edition of the marriage service, which
the guests autographed.
Charlie Duffy and his wife are receiving
no end of sympathy on the death of their
twin sons. The Stork had no sooner left
them than the wee things released their
slender hold on life.
One of the Naicest, who had not been a
personal admirer of Prime Minister Bruce,
says that she now believes in him because
he either carelessly or carefully omitted to
wear a returned soldier’s badge, or any other
sort of reminder of his war contributions, at
the Anzac service in the Town Hall. Also
the fact that he sat on the platform and
said nothing is counted in his favor. One
cannot imagine the late Premier Hughes
holding such a position, on such an occa-
sion, without making a lot of himself in the
character of a hero who helped to win the war.
Here was his successor, who actually did his
bit with his hands, attending an Anzac
memorial service undecorated and untalka-
tive. One is bound to respect a Prime Min-
ister who can do things like that.
Joyce Landale and Neville Armytage
celebrated Anzac Day by getting married.
The local squattocracy, with heavy reinforce-
ments, overflowed the Deniliquin Anglican
church, and gasped united admiration when
bride Joyce, led by brother Bobby, trailed
up the aisle. Under a tulle veil, anchored
with orange-blossbms, she wore ivory maro-
cain, equatored with gold to match the key-
patterned hem embroideries. A back curtain
of satin, with inn.r entanglements of white
and gold, was held out of the dust by a trio
of fairies, Sheila Armytage, Sonia Landale
and Brenda Andrew. The three fluttered in
pink and gold to match the dresses of the
bridesmaids, Floss Cox and Fay Good, who
topped their rosy drapings with net caps
swathed with pink and gold. The bride’s
mother staged the cake-cutting in a marquee
at Mundiwa. There she shook hands with
her guests in inky hangings cheered with jet
in a setting of balloons and roses. After the
cheerio, the just-weds oiled off in a storm
of rose-petals and applause—she in blue
marocain under a red-lined cloak, with the
same colors flyine- from her hat.
Who would suspect such an attractive
young thing as Kathleen Daly, herewith pic-
tured by Alice Mills, to be one of the high-
brow brigade? Hhe has just put up an almost
unbeatable record at Melbourne ’Varsity by
outdistancing
a 11 competi-
tors in the
medical finals.
She got home
first with
honors in
every section.
Mere man was

groan when
little Kath-

scored by
sharing the
Fulton Exhi-
b i t i o n for
obstetrics and
gynaecology
with Prof.
Osborne’s
brainy wife,
who is like-
wise breathing
defiance at the
ancient belief (man-made, of course!) that
her sex is fitted out with grey matter of a
quality inferior to that boxed up in the male
skull. The Presbyterian College earns a pat
on the back for its early training of this
bright little lady rtied. Solicitor Arthur
Daly, of Hawthorn, claims her as a daughter.
An only chick had that day returned to
the parental roof after spending a week at
the home of her fiance, and, saying she was
tired, she. went to bed earlier than usual,
Before putting out the lights dad had occa-
sion to pass her bedroom door, and was
astounded at hearing a man’s voice. Listen-
ing to make sure, he distinctly heard the
man speaking in most endearing tones. He
ran to his wife, and both returned and de-
manded admittance. When the door was
opened by the blushing girl it disclosed a
gramophone at the bedside—a present from
her lover, who had had special records made
so as to enable him to say “good night” be-
fore she retired. Dad said it was a damfool
business, but mum’s eyes were moist as
they left the room.
An interesting little performance was
staged on the Yarra bank the other after-
noon, when Mrs. Fred Michaelis, whose
hubby had handed a new racing eight to his
old college, Wesley, smashed a bottle of the
best over the nose of the boat. She named
it “L. A. Adamson,” after headmaster
“Dicky,” amid thunderous cheers from a
group of gold- and purple-capped youngsters.
Mrs. Fred smiled on the glad happening in
a bell-shaped hat and neat tailorings, wrapped
cosily with a monster fur stole.
The Fisken family, who were plunged
into mourning for brother Archie a few
weeks back, are now torn with anxiety over
eldest sister Lily. She is seriously ill as
a result of the shock. Archie Fisken was
a brother-in-law of the Irvine dame.
This is Ruskin’s latest of pianist. William
James, who is now sharing the limelight
with Stella Power at the Town Hall. James

with a facility that amazed his competitors.
It wasn’t long
before he was
figuring on the
programmes of
the Royal
Albert Hall
and Queen’s
Hall Promen-
ade concerts,
and at the
same time he
was erecting a
separate repu-
tation as a
composer. It is
hard to say
whether h e
prefers the
role of inter-
preter or of
creator, but
his composi-
tions are. ad-
vertising him
furiously
among people of high musical taste. He has
written a ballet for orchestra, and he had
the use of Sir Thomas Beecham’s own band
in making the music publ:c at the Savoy
Theatre in London. In Britain also Peter
Dawson and Horace Stevens are advertis-
ing the truth and feeling of his newest bush
songs.
Gwenda Grimwade, who is snapping her
pretty fingers at superstition with a May
wedding, has decided to give the city a miss
and swear herself away to Chettie Manifold
at Frankston. The knot w : ll be tied at the
lodal Anglican church, with after-jollifica-
tions at the family shack, Marathon. On'y
relations and friends among the younger
generation will take part in the revels. The
bride is one of the shining lights of Franks-
ton yachting, and can trim a sail with the
best.
The horde of enthusiasts in the old
Masonic Hall when the Shakspeareans cele-
brated the Immortal’s umpteenth birthday
hardly supports the suggestion lately put
forward that interest in William and all h's
works is chilling off. G. R. Long, as pre-
sident, opened the party with a few compli-
mentary remarks before a long programme,
compiled by the tireless Charlotte Hemming,
was unfolded. In the opening scene from
“The Merchant” the lady herself, as Portia,
and Maisie Cumming, as Nerissa, lived the
characters quite convincingly in modern
ehiffonery. But a poetical little Ophelia
(Adele Bramley), parcelled up in while
wrappings and displaying a stockinged leg,
achieved a less happy effect. Norman
Bradshaw warbled Shakspearean lyrics, and
the applause nearly cracked the cei’ing when
he and Jo Foster combined their voices.
The Berry-street Foundling Home will
get a nice financial lift from the card-and-
rnusic affair engineered by the Women’s
Automobile Club tes at the Oriental the other
afternoon. A gang of girl-brigands worked
off sweets and raffles. The tennis-playing
Claperton sisters and a Sydney-sider, Mettle
Bradley, headed the predatory band. Br’dge
and poker enthusiasts were mercifully tucked
well away from the song centre, where the
brightest turns were provided by Mrs.
Robertson, Alan Murray and tenor Victor
Baxter.
Death released Mrs. Barnes, mother of
Sam Barnes, Minister of Mines and Rail-
ways, from long suffering on Saturday morn-
ing". She was a martyr to rheumatism for
years, and her son exhausted all the re-
sources of the medicoes to give her some
surcease. Her devoted boy is a bachelor,
and 57. ,
11. L. Heron, gen. manager of the Com-
mercial, succeeds C. W. Wren, of the E., S.
and A., as chairman of the Associated
Banks. Since the Commonwealth Bank
came into being and Denison Miller has
loomed so large, less is heard of the chair-
man of.the associated establishments, and
little social limelight now falls upon him.
The Russell Clarkes, who land back
shortly from a trip to the Cold Land, have
acquired the Fred Fairbairns’ Domain-road
house, which bears no nameplate but a defianr
"18.” With all their family married and
away, the Fairbairns ( she is just back from
the Fog) find it more cheerful to divide their
time between their country place and a
South Yarra flat. No. 18, wnere Edward F.
once spent a jazzy evening, is at present
leased to the Jack Turnbull pair. She was
one of S’Henry Parker’s daughters.
The Norton Grimwade pair, who between
travels have been hiring other people’s
houses, have now bought the late William
Cane’s South Yarra property. It has been
rented as a flattage for several years, and
the Grimwades can’t unload their furnish-
ings until the long lease runs out. It is be-
coming “awfully swish” to have a house to
yourself, now that flats have become the
refuge of the servantless.
An enthusiastic audience packed the Play-
house on Saturday night to scatter blessings
on clever little Nellie Bramley and her band
of players, who were closing down on a
satisfactory comedy season in "The Lion and
the Mouse.” The building has been tem-
porarily earmarked for other purposes; but
Nellie and her managerial husband, William
Russell, will ring the curtain up afresh after
putting in the intervening eight weeks on
a mumming expedition in the Speck. After
the mouse had successfully gobbled up the
lion, so to speak, the principals were em-
bedded in vegetation and the house latticed
in the stage with streamers, through which
Russell and his Nellie had to smash their
way to voice their united thanks.
Times have changed. Not so long ago
we didn’t think of planting even a gilly-
flower without putting a fence around it.
Then in a moment of trustfulness we pulled
away the obstacles around the Fitzroy and
Treasury gardens; and nothing happened
except that people seemed to feel themselves
more at home there. Now the heads have
decided that the daring experiment might as
well be applied to the Botanical Gardens.
Incidentally, there will be large changes
inside : director Cronin is a sick man and
will retire, and the new chief will be ex-
pected to do a whole lot of reorganisation.
Early last week word was cabled to
Colonei Parnell, Administrator of Norfolk
Island, that his mother, the widow of Lieut.-
Col. Edin Parnell, had passed out. She came
to Australia 65 years ago, when she was 28.
Latterly she lived at Riversdale-road, Haw-
thorn.
Fred Mewton, who long-time conducted a
choir of his own, and is otherwise musically
and honorably knoryn, is to be given a com-
plimentary concert before going to Sydney,
and meetings are talking it over at the Town
Hall this week. Mewton was among the
original lot of choir boys at new St. Paul’s
—the cathedral which some good churchmen
would like to shift for the sake of the land
value of the present site—and helped to
sing “The Voice that Breathed” at the first
expensive wedding solemnised in that edifice
a little more than 30 years ago. In Sydney
he is to take charge of the music in St.
Andrew’s.
A lice or two from Adelaide:—
A'ozac Day saw the completion of the Women’s
War Memorial —Garden of Memory, Cross of Sacrifice
and Stone of Remembrance that have gradually
come into being close to the Anglican Cathedral
in the north park lands. Soldiers were there in
plenty, and the women who have given the memoriai.
The c eremony was of the simplest: the National
Anthem, a hymn or two, a prayer or two, and a word
from the Governor when, at Mrs. Glover’s request
(she was chairman of the committee when it was
launched), he drew aside the coverings from the
stone.
Two hundred English wives and their babies were
guests of the Victoria League at the tea arranged
by the Settlers’ Welcome Committee in the Botanic
Park, and the committee put in as hectic an after-
noon as the visitors did a cheery one. Mrs. Per-
cival Stow, the committee’s president, did the honors.
Usually more is heard of the Victoria League’s, tea-
parties than of its other work, but it has done fnucli
good in the way of extending a friendly hand to
rather lonely newcomers to the State.
The Victor-a League and League of Empire joined
forces in a meeting to hear Prof. Darnley Naylor
lecture on the League of Nations. On the same
evening Prof. Strong was lecturing for the University
Shakspeare Society—his subject the theatre of Shak-
speare’s day. Josiah Symoh, who knows more of
Shakspeare than most, was in the chair.
Socially we’re still as dead as in midsummer;
but gradually town houses are shaking themselves
awake and casting off their dust sheets.
Miss Ida Turner, back from two years’ tripping
abroad, was welcomed with a tea at the Queen Adel-
aide Club a day or so after landing. Mrs. Dudley
Turner was hostess, and Mrs. Walter Duncan, Mrs.
Roy Burston, Mrs. T. G. Wilson, Mrs. Nat Campbell
and Mrs. Humphrey Makin were among the Pekoe-
drinkers.
There have been farewell parties, too. At the
South Australian Mrs. Harry Taylor hostessed one
at which the guests were Mrs. Jule Wendt and Miss
Lois Wendt and Mrs. Ernest Tolley. Another was
a tea at the Pier at Glenelg, where Mrs. H. K.
Wendt had bidden her friends come along for a
final handshake with Miss Lois Wendt before she
sailed to India, where she’s to stay with friends
at Quetta.

NOTIONS
"NO TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Were the late Sam Johnson on hand to
bring his Dictionary up to date, his definition of the
beautiful word “amateur” might be as memorable
as the meaning he gave to “oatmeal” and “excise.”
The task is beyond any modern lexicographer. Accord-
ing to P. B. Colquhoun, president of the Lawn
Tennis Council, J. O. Anderson’s terms for consent-
ing to accompany a second-rate Davis Cup team to
its certain defeat in America included (1) a trip
to Wimbledon, with “the usual daily allowance,” as
well as all hotel and travelling expenses, and (2)
the provision of a business substitute during his
absence, at the council’s cost. To the first demand
the controlling body yielded at once, but the other
point it found itself unable to concede. There was
an insurmountable barrier in its constitution.
Which is just as well. Sydney Sun, which employs
Anderson to write tennis notes, vouchsafed the
further information that, on top of the lavish ex-
penses account for his English and American excur-
sions last year, a considerable sum was subscribed
by some of his admirers. There was mysterious men-
tion of money having been handed over in a lump,
and also of weekly payments. It was likewise pro-
vokingly explained that the enthusiasts in question
hadn’t come forward this year, no reason being
assigned for the rash act.
In the absence of these philanthropists the Sun
has been trying to raise £3OO to provide Anderson
with a locum tenens in his sporting-goods business.
The paper itself gave £5O, and Annette Kellerman
weighed in with £5, but the Sydney public, which
\yas alleged to be burning with indignation at the
prospect of Anderson staying home instead of going
on his travels again, morosely refused to burn money
for the Korz. After the fund had been open a week it
had coughed up a whole £7 10s. For three days
not a sixpence came in. The Sun might have had
better luck had it taken E. W. Carr under its wing,
In view of all the circumstances, the Tennis Council
would be well advised to retire from the Davis Cup
trade, as far as 1923 is concerned, and co-operate
with other amateur bodies in getting a thoroughly
representative Australian team ready for the Olympic
Games.
* * * *
“10-2-4” : The starting of a fund by the
Sydney Sun to recompense Anderson’s firm for iiis
absence from business with the Davis Cup team
recalls the fact that the sporting public cannot be
too careful of offending - the susceptibilities of its
gifted amateurs. It is in the course of the
attendant ceremonial that disaster may materialise.
The utmost delicacy is called for. I am reminded
of the case of Horace Clamwissle, ex-champion Halma
player of the world. The Halma Cup Tie was due
to be played that year in Reykjavik. The Halma
Association agreed to pay the then champion’s travel-
ling and living expenses, and those of his wife and three
adult daughters; the municipal council of his suburb
undertook the upkeep of his house and garden;
the Burrangorang Halma Club, under whose auspices
he first won to fame, made itself responsible for the
education of Ilia two boys in the absence of_ the
breadwinner on the nation’s business; public opinion
forced the firm which had the misfortune to employ
him, to keep his job open and allow him full pay.
At the Town Hall meeting, at which the State
Premier spoke of the tributes gladly, proudly pa id
by devotees of the grand old game to their idol,
Chamwissle expressed not only acquiescence but
approval. Not a hitch occurred at any of his send-
offs from the different Australian ports visited by
the liner on which he travelled. And then, at
Colombo, a criminally inefficient steamship employee
put Nobbs, the English professional cricketer, in
Clamwissle’s cabin. The amateur at once left the
ship, and within 24 hours was on his way back
to Australia by another line. As a direct result
the Halma championship went to Sambo, a member
of a tree-dwelling tribe inhabiting the banks of the
Übangi in the Belgian Congo, and has remained
in the possession of that nation ever since. If a
thing is worth doing it is worth doing with tact.
“15-30”: Brookes’9 choice of Anderson,
Hawkes, Sehlesinger and Mclnnes as the best quar-
tette for the Davis Cup is open to the criticism that
he selected the two colts purely on their perform-
ances in the recent Autumn tournament in Mel-
bourne. At that meeting Mclnnes played well
against O’Hara Wood, and Sehlesinger defeated Pat-
terson, after dow'ning Wertheim, but one can’t see
that their form on that occasion justified the down-
right preference for them shown by Brookes. Clemen-
ger has cast further doubt on the wisdom of the
selector by playing a draw with Sehlesinger (four
sets were contested, each winning two at 6 —3) and
by gaining the odd set in a grim two-days’ match
with Mclnnes. The Sydney colt has a stronger
physique than Mclnnes, and is gifted with the test-
match temperament. But Brookes says he w'on’t
alter his team. Personally I prefer Norman Peach
as a reserve to any of the aforesaid youngsters, be-
cause he has proved a strong partner for Anderson in
the doubles. And it is not easy to find a suitable
ally for James.
* * * •
“Basil”: “Jamwood” says (B. 26/4/’23)
that Anderson will never be a world’s champion,
though, with only two appearances abroad, he is
already ranked among the first six on the globe.
Seeing that J.O. is still young and is capable of
beating the admitted star, Tilden, which he did at
Chicago after a Homeric struggle two years ago,
I wouldn’t be so cocksure as “Jamwood” on the
matter. Anderson is a great player, and if Carr
does as well as he in a much less “strenuous
pastime, if “Jamwood” ’VU pardon my saying so,
we won’t need to drag in the R.S.L. to prejudice
the question of their respective merits as sportsmen.
For every one who is interested in a sprinter
cutting a fraction of a second off some established
record over a certain distance there are a hundred
who are attracted by the tennis encounter, because
of its international importance and because it is
intrinsically worth their attention. The time has
aone for superior scoffs at the alleged girlishness of
the pastime. I suspect that much of this form of
criticism springs from sedentary idlers who never
follow any healthful recreation. You will hear the
same sneer at “goff” by large, burly men whose
idea of exercise is pushing their way to a book-
maker at Randwick or Flemington. These people
are on a par with the broad-minded democrats
who condemn Prime Minister Bruce on account of
his spats.

The subject of
the sketch is A. E.
P o r r i 11, Maoriland
Rhodes scholar and all-
round athlete. At the
recent inter-’Varsity
sports Porritt won the
long jump, the 120yds.
hurdles, the 220yds.,
and the 100yds., the
last in lOsee. That
ought to be good
enough for Oxford.
Rarely is the Oxford-
Cambridge 100yds. won
in even time. It has
only happened thrice
since 1880.
The inter-collegi-
ate sports in Adelaide
(still confined to two
schools, Scotch not
having come in as
hoped) reversed last
year’s result, St.
Peter’s winning by 67
points to Prince
Alfred’s 53. Moor-
house, for the winners,
took the 100 yards, the
220, the long jump and
the steeple. Fisher,
for the losers, won the
high jump and weight,
being placed also in
the hurdles, the steeple,
and the long jump.
There were some des-
perate finishes, includ-
ing a dead heat in the quarter-mile. In the
old-bovs’ events —hundred, quarter and hurdles —
L. V. Pellew swept the board. He did the hundred
in 10 l-ssec.

Purser celebrated bis victorious return
home by winning the. Glenhuntlv Cup at Caulfield
last Saturday. Coming from a long way back, the
Sea Prince gelding took the lead in the straight and
stayed there, the nearest of his followers being The
Tyrant, who had 311 b. the better of the weights
and was giving his first evidence of ability to stay
even 11 furlongs. Valwyne, with Frank Dempsey
aboard, brought off a bit of a stable coup in the
two-year-old event, and Sonora broke a series of
disappointments by winning the six-furlong flutter
from Imputation. The Steeplechase brought little
comfort to punters, who had notched Gold Coin and
Faithful Knight for Grand National consideration.
The Coin fell at the second last fence, and Faithful
Knight tired when old Oopina tackled him at the
distance.

James Scobie is always suspected of seri-
ous designs on the Adelaide meetings in May, so
perhaps Rosina will do the trick in the Goodwood
next Saturday. But on recent form the mare is not
kindly handicapped, and her chance, anyhow, depends
on how the change of climate agrees with her. Lewis
has the mount.

“0.K.”: Perhaps it was only a strange
coincidence that King’s Battery should have followed
his full-brother Artilleryman to the grave in the
prime of his racing life. Nevertheless, the early
decease of those two sons of Comedy King and Cross
Battery suggests that they shared a certain weakness
of constitution. King’s Battery died of being raced
when an influenza germ had just got to work on
him. Artilleryman, one of the most brilliant three-
year-olds, on Australian record, developed a swelling
which, in its early • stages, didn’t stop him from
winning three races, and was therefore said to be
of no consequence. But when the noble gee, after
s’uffering defeats, died suddenly of some internal
complaint, it was clear that the warning lump
had meant something serious. A screw had always
been loose in Artilleryman’s works. His failure
to beat Richmond Main in either of the Derbies,
although he had looked a certain winner each time,
was utterly at variance with his very best perfor-
mances. King’s Battery showed an even more marked
peculiarity, in blossoming so late. Up to fire years
he was but a petty winner among duffers. Then he
started to be a horse of some importance, but as
soon as he fell sick there was hardly enough kick
left in him to kick the bucket.

The aristocratically-bred Sardine, by Tra-
falgar-Fishery, has won a couple of races about Syd-
ney lately—one at Menangle and the other at War-
wick Farm. He is not much good, but has a bit
of his sire’s gameness, and doesn’t shirk his work
under the whip. He is owned by W. IV. Evans, who
got Apologue home in the Melbourne Cup, and rode
many winners in India. Perhaps the best of Tra-
falgar’s progeny has been Heart of Oak, which won
good races in Westralia, and was then sold to an
Indian buyer. But Wallace’s stout-hearted son can
hardly be called a stud success.

“H.K.”: The first recorded race meeting
in Australia took place at Parramatta on April 30,
1810. There was a race between a horse called
Parramatta and another named Belfast (Parramatta
won), also cock-fighting, foot-running and jumping
in sacks. But the most exciting item on the pro-
gramme w r as a 100yds. contest for matrons. The
prize w'as enough calico to make a chemise.

“Dun Brown”: One I)e Courcy Bower —-
his Le Queux-like prattlings about Monte Carlo
are appearing in Sydney Telegraph —while posing as
the man whose “system” broke the Casino bank,
merely succeeds in demonstrating that no system can
break a roulette bank. He got together what he calls
“an army ready and trained to a hair for the con-
test” ; he gave each of his half-dozen colleagues
100,000 francs, and the contest began:—
“I lost steadily. I glanced over at my assistants.
Their piles of money were diminishing with each
regular sweep of the croupier’s rake. People were
openly commenting as time after time I was bled by
the bank. I noticed that two of my assistants, the
Irishman and a Spaniard I had known in South
America, were beginning to look white and haggard
• —for the money was decreasing at an alarming
rate.”
And then suddenly, for no reason whatever: —
“It was borne in on me that the ‘moment’ had
arrived to throw all my weight against the hank. I
cannot explain why this came to me with such over-
whelming confidence, but 1 knew that I had the
game in my hands. I took my seat, and with abso-
lute certainty commenced to play the maximum.”
And he promptly proceeded to break the bank three
times running, with the result that he and his
“army” netted £220,000. He does not claim to
have done it again, and is now living by journalism.
Any lunatic with half-a-million francs to play up is
likely to increase it tenfold, though he is infinitely
more likely to lose it. But, as Bower shows, the
arbiter is not the system, but the luck. Hiram
Maxim invented 17 different systems and failed with
them all. The father of Australia’s late visitor,
Lord Loughborough, went to Monte Carlo with what
was described as “the most perfect system ever in-
vented,” and the backing of a big syndicate, played
it consistently, and lost everything he had. There
is but one sure system at Monte Carlo, and that is
to be on the spot when the mechanism of one of
the tables goes wrong. This may have happened
when Bower was there, but it is a slender reed on
w'hich to rely these days, the Bain de Mer authori-
ties being as alive to the ruinous possibilities of a
run on one number, or even color, as anyone else.
The inter-State eight-oared race, in many
respects the finest event of the year in the amateur
sporting world, will be rowed next Saturday on the
Swan. Queensland isn’t represented, and the N.S.W.
crew will compete under difficulties, having been
relentlessly pursued by the angry hag Misfortune.
On their showing in 1921 and 1922 the Westralians
should have a hand in the finish, but the Gropers
have done better on remote rivers than on their own
difficult waterway. Also, their welterweight stroke,
George Rogers, is getting up in years. .South Aus-
tralia’s hopes will again be carried by the Murray
Bridge boat, which won in Sydney last year, but
Pfeiffer’s men may find the Swan a tougher proposi-
tion than the Parramatta. In 1906, when the race was
held on Melville Water for the first time, Tasmania
was first and Victoria second; in 1912 the positions
were reversed. Maybe the Victorians will repeat
their performances of 11 years ago (they haven’t
won since), but the Speck boat is tolerably sure to
be well up.

Alf Felton’s luck was in when he beat
Barry on the Thames that wild October day in
1919, but it has since deserted him. In his match
with Hannan, the Blenheim (M.L.) sculler, on
Nelson Harbor, the long Digger passed the finishing
point three feet ahead but was outed on a foul.
He had tried, unsuccessfully, to have the match
postponed on the ground that ill-health had interfered
with his training.

“London”: England takes its sport seri-
ously, all right. Niekalls, of the Oxford crew, was
due! to give evidence in a London court, in a
motor-collision case, on March 8. The boatraee
was not till the 24th, but counsel pleaded, that
“enforced absence, even for a day, w'ould seriously
interrupt training”; and, though the other side
opposed, the Judge ruled that it was a reasonable
application, and adjourned the case till after the
more important matter had been rowed.

At Coogee (N.S.W.) Aquarium on Satur-
day, in a bath which for half its 50 yards length
held less than two feet of water, Mina Wylie re-
tained her 100 yards State championship, beating
Lily Robertson and Vera Pawley in 72 4-ssec. Mina
didn’t defend her 100 yards breaststroke title, and
Ettie Robertson defeated Ella Smith by 3 yards in
93 4-ssee. But Ella was consoled by depriving Lottie
Wigney of her diving championship. Ella’s record
this season- —besides the diving she has won the
440 yards, free style, and the 50 yards backstroke
titles —has been equalled only by Fanny Durack and
Mina Wylie during the last decade.

“D.”: A queer feature of Sydney life is
that hardly anybody displays gratitude on being
saved, or on seeing a relation saved, from death oy
drowning. A couple of Sundays ago the South
Narrabeen Surf Club brought off 62 rescues—mostly
of fool-visitors who had neglected the warnings of
the local experts. The total thankofferings to the
club’s by no means brimming treasury consisted of
a ten-bob note. But this was more encouraging
than the reception given to a team on one of the
metropolitan beaches, whose members, after hauling
a stout young woman ashore, in the face of high
seas and a warning that sharks were in the bay,
were met by a storm of abuse from her father on
the score of their alleged dilatoriness. “A nice lot
of life-savers you are!” he said. I could a done
it as quick meself and not ’arf-drowned the gnl.
Yer club ought to be wiped out. ’ The ex-Uigger
who described the episode to me put it this way.
“If we hadn’t been returned men, and so used to
such treatment, we might have got apnoyed with the
old cow.”

This vigorous youth is Archie Bradley, the
Gympie (Q.) welterweight, who whipped George
Eagel, of the U.S.A., at Sydney Stadium, and in doing
so gave a rare display
of force and stamina.
As strong as a bull
and saturated with
combative instinct,
Bradley forced the
fight from the first
round to the last and
never let the Ameri-
can get set for a
punch. He closed
Eagel’s left eye half-
way through the pro-
ceedings, and woe
18 of the 20 fast
rounds fought.
The Yank damaged
his left fist in the
third, but he could
not have beaten
the rushing
Queenslander, who
is a great ad. for
the Gympie cli-
mate. The lads
drew £591 Bs. 6d.
apiece for their
hour’s work. They
might have got an-
other hundred or
two if the Stadium
people (regardless
of the regulars who have uncomplainingly paid
high prices, to see rotten fights between third-
raters) hadn’t rushed up the tariff.

Those Sydney footballers who play the
Australian game, which is supreme in four States
and is making headway in the other two, commenced
their season on Saturday. Their headquarters are
at Erskineville, and they now control two ovals at
North Sydney. The burly Police team began well
by kicking 9 goals 22 behinds to East Sydney’s
7 goals 9 behinds; and Paddington scored 9 goals
12 behinds against Balmain’s total of 6 goals 12
behinds. But the slushy conditions were all against
good football. Teams from Victoria, South Oss and
Tasmania will come over to Sydney during the year,
the idea being that it is an auspicious time to
challenge the popularity of Rugby League. The Soccer
people are also active. They have added Sydney
Cricket Ground No. 2 to their list of playing fields,
and are preparing for the visit of an M.L. team,
against which three test matches will be played.
Then there will be a Chinese invasion.

It is years since Melbourne saw such a
long- interval between cricket and football, but She
barraeker is getting himself fit watching practice
matches. The League and Association having signed a
five-years’ agreement, there isn’t the trafficking in
stars there used to be, though country townships
are finding up to £lO a w r eek to entice a metro-
politan coach. The Magpies suffer most from this
caper; but they just capture another Collingwood
youngster -and train him up as the others were
trained, and when he makes good he goes, the same
as the others. South Melbourne, on the contrary,
entice champions from “abroad.” Last season they
had a St. Kilda man as captain and coach; this
time they have snared a ’Woodsman. They do the
same in cricket, but their luck is poor. Last foot-
ball year they bottomed the list; and in the just-
closed cricket season they were almost last.

“Treble”: Sam McMichael, who went west
the other day, will always be remembered as a mem-
ber of a trinity. As a footballer with Fitzroy he
had for colleagues on the back line Con Hickey and
Tom Banks, and during his 20 years with the East
Melbourne cricket team he was associated with Peter
McAlister and Frank Laver. At the winter sport
he was fearless, and to the present day Fitzroy are
always most successful when playing the rushing,
desperate game that was initiated 30 years ago by
McMichael and his contemporaries. For many seasons
Sam opened for East Melbourne with McAlister, and
at pennant cricket scored his 6000 runs; also, he
did great work for the club as hon. sec. He was a
graceful writer on sporting subjects.
* *• * *
“Winkle”: P. C. Barney Herbert, who
grew' grey, and Clarrie Hall, who went bald, in
the service of Richmond, are this year to be antago-
nists. Barney is coaching at Brunswick, and Hall
is teaching North Melbourne. Years ago Richmond
were the topnotch Association club, and Clarrie was
one of their forwards. On their entry to the League
it was thought he would be too small for the new
company, so he w r as dropped. The expected world-
beaters not arriving, he was brought back, and
quickly established his reputation as the most daring
of rovers. Barney Herbert, very raw and bony,
came from Collingwood Trades, and for a year at
least was a source of worry to the club coach. How-
ever, he developed into a champion follower.
* .* -* *
“Ashmead”: When the Old Launces-
tonians, who have done big things for rowing,
applied to the North Tasmanian Football Association
for admission as a fourth team, they were turned
down by a big majority. The Ass. decided that
preference should be given to one of the junior
clubs, which had “kept the game alive during the
war.” It apparently didn’t matter that most of
the chaps who would comprise the new club were
too busy kicking the Hun about in those- years to
think about booting leather.

“(I. Rich”: In a rifle-club match between
Deeside, Scotts Brook and Kojonup (W.A.) the Deeside
team was composed of seven Muirs and three Dousts,
the most distant relation being a cousin. The
family team shot into second place.
THE FOOTBALL CUP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the English Cup Final at Wembley, 100,000
people broke the barriers and swarmed into the
ground. Over 60 were removed to hospital with
fractured legs, arms and minor injuries... .It is
estimated that this is the largest single assembly
ever seen in Great Britain.” — Cable.
Since Britain first emerged from nothingness
Was ever crowd so vast in space so small?
A quarter of a million, more or less!
A revolution is it? Not at all.
From all the corners of the land they press,
Disablement defying and distress,
To see West Ham and Bolton boot the ball
And settle who shall Soccer champions be
For nineteen-twenty-three.
•Spring’s in the air and in men’s hearts is Spring.
What did he know who said that Britons take
Their recreations sadly? Not a thing.
Matchwood of barriers and gates they make.
Thousands are down. But still “God Save the King”
Two hundred thousand jocund voices sing
Careless of ribs that snap and legs that break.
No time to reckon casualties up,
The thing just now’s The Cup.
Against the surging crow’d the cops advance
The field of play to clear at any cost;
The whistles blow, the plunging horses prance
(How can the Final else be won and lost?).
The stretcher-bearer and the ambulance
Work double tides. A painful circumstance,
But eggs must break ere omelets can be tossed.
Hurrah! ’Tis o’er at last. The game is won.
Bolton —two goals to none.

Just Charming.
By “PHLOX.”
" A CAREER is all riglit, Audrey, as
far as it goes; but I don’t think
it is sufficient to satisfy the aver-
age woman’s heart.”
“I suppose, Aunt, that’s why you gave
up your medical practice and married Uncle
Edward.”
“Yes. I was getting on in years when I
married. I had begun to feel that want of
companionship with someone I could really
call my own—someone who was more to me
than a friend.”
' Those are my sentiments, Aunt. I feel
I have a more interesting career than most
women with a lectureship at the University
and my research work in archmology, but
there’s something wanting.”
“And that something, my dear Audrey, is
a husband. I’ve been through the same thing
myself, and I know —it’s the same old story,
old yet ever new. I loved my profession as
you love yours, but alone it was unsatisfy-
ing.”
“Yes, Aunt. I realised that when I saw
Nita Anderson’s radiantly happy face as she
announced her engagement to be married;
then I realised that even a career does not
compensate for a life of single blessedness.
1'ou remember that jolly girl who passed so
brilliantly in Arts! She’s going to marry
Professor Butler.”
"And I think, Audrey, it’s about time
you looked around for a husband. You’re
not cut out for an old maid, though of late
you’ve acquired one or two little prim ways,
and the average man does like a little bit cf
fluffiness about a woman.”
•'What do you mean?”
“I mean that you want to take more pains
with your general appearance; fluff out your
hair a bit, and so on.”
“But I don’t happen to have flufty hair.”
“Then you’ve got to fluff it; also to im-
prove your skin; in fact, where Nature has
been deficient, supply the deficiency with
art. That’s what I do. But I promised
to meet Uncle at 6 o’clock, and it’s nearly
that now—I must be going. Good-bye,
Audrey, and think over what I’ve told you.”
Audrey Johnson was thinking over what
her practical aunt had suggested w T hen she
was interrupted by someone wrapping on her
study door.”
“Come in,” she called.
Professor Livingstone’s pretty wife
entered. She had come to ask Miss Johnson
to join in a send-off to Nita Anderson.
After this had been satisfactorily arranged
they talked of all kinds of things.
Audrey had often noticed what pretty,
fluffy hair Mrs. Livingstone had, and how
beautifully she dressed it. Why not ask
her for some hints on hairdressing?
Mrs. Livingstone felt quite flattered at be-
ing asked for advice by clever Miss Johnson.
“So much depends,” she told her, “on the
way the hair is shampooed as to whether
the hairdressing will be a success. Per-
sonally, I always use Stallax,” said Mrs.
Livingstone, “and I find it makes the hair
beautifully glossy, fluffy a iid easy to dress.”
“And that’s just what I want,” replied
Miss Johnson.
“Do,you ever use a hair tonic?”
“No, I’m afraid I’ve never given much
thought to my appearance, but I ihtend to
turn over a new leaf in that respect.”
“I can give you a recipe for a simple,
home-made tonic. You buy a package of
boranium from the chemist, mix it with
a quarter of a pint of bay rum, and rub into
the scalp occasionally.
“Do you know,” went on bright little
Mrs. Livingstone, “a little while ago I was
getting quite grey, and I happened to hear
a woman in a chemist’s shop ask for two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite and three
ounces of bay rum to mix with it. She
then turned to her friend and said that there
was nothing like it for restoring grey hair to
its original color. I thereupon ordered the
same, and now I haven’t the sign of a grey
hair.”
“I’m glad to know of that, too, for I’m
continually pulling grey hairs out of my
head.”
“But, Miss Johnson, when you begin to
look after your hair you must also look
after your skin, and I find that there’s
nothing like mercolized wax for keeping the
skin soft, clear and free from blemishes.”
“My aunt was telling me that I badly need
a skin food, but she didn’t tell me what to
use.”
“All the well-preserved women I know
seem to use mercolized wax, It contains
oxygen, and removes the old worn-out skin
so imperceptibly and painlessly that you
don’t know the process is going on until
soihe fine day one of your friends will re-
mark, ‘I don’t know what you’ve been doing
to your skin, but it’s like a baby’s.’ ”
“Then, that’s certainly the cream for me.”
“Well, if you care to come round to my
place when you have time I will show you
a pretty way of dressing your hair. Believe
me, my' husband always keeps me up to the
mark, and is delighted to hear people whis-
per as we pass, ‘Look! isn’t she just charm-
ing?”’

THE INKY WAY.
“11.F.L.”: Geelong (Vic.) is threatened with a
new daily, the Standard. The co. launching the
venture lias bought the plant and building of the
Geelovg- Times, which gave up the ghost recently
after a run of 60 years.
“Tasmaniac”: Hobart is to have an evening paper
towards the end of the year. The newcomer is to
be called The News, and is to be published by News,
Ltd., the energetic Adelaide co. of which Jack David-
son is managing director. The Speck's capital has
not had an evening journal for many years —since
the old Evening News was absorbed by the Daily
Post.
“Zion”: Residents of Goulburn (N.S.W.) are put-
ting. their shillings together to raise a stone over
the -.remains of Tom Hebblewhite, who splashed ink
in the local tri-weekly for 35 years. Before lie died
Hebblewhite wrote his reminiscences, and as these
have an appeal wider than the town boundaries,
because of the political personalia so freely dealt
with, there is talk of publishing them in a memorial
volume.
“Coot”: Melbourne’s weekly Midnight Sun has
set, after shining (more or less) for nearly four
years. Although it could once boast “a greater cir-
culation than any other weekly in Melbourne,” it
faded out suddenly, without any preliminary groans.
Originally published at threepence, it dropped to a
penny towards the close, but the reduction either
failed to assist dissolution or accelerated it. Many
Melbourne freelances will regret its passing, for it
was practically the only journal in Melbourne which
encouraged the unattached par. writer.
F. B. Guthrie, for over 30 years chemist to the
N.S.W. Agricultural Department and Farrer’s associ-
ate in wheat-breeding experiments, has reached the
retiring age in the public service ; but he refuses to
believe that he is too old to still do something for
others and a little for himself. So on his retirement
he will go to Brisbane and take charge of the Daily
Mail's agricultural section. Guthrie has merely
played with printer’s ink hitherto: when he wanted
relaxation he was always liable to turn to verse-
making, and The Bulletin hasn’t printed very much
better verse than a few of “F.B.G.V rare con-
tributions.
Oliver Growden, who ended in the Yarra the
other day, wrote leaderettes and book reviews for
the Herald when J. E. Davidson was in command
—and did it well. He turned out some graceful
verse, too, and published two or three novels and
series of sketches, and if he could only have
believed in himself and been a trifle less sensitive
he might have gone to the top. When Innes took
charge Growden was made a reporter, and news-
hunting irked him. Naturally he was ultimately
elbowed out, and had not been in regular work
for two years. Nothing was left for the widow.
“Ena”: While being entertained by his friends of
Flinders-lane, Prime Minister Bruce paid a compli-
ment to the newspaper men who call at his office
daily. lie. preferred the newspaper men he met
to those with whom he never had personal contact:
“Personally, he had an extraordinary dislike for
editors —those men whom no one ever saw, but who
framed the policy of the papers, and w'ho said he
had done the most outrageous things. But the
pressman one met in everyday' life was a. pleasant
and reliable fellow/’ •
Bruce has been at pains to obtain a “good press,”
the value of which he realises. One of the first
things he did after being- sworn in was. to suipmon
the political roundsmen and proclaim opportunities
for mutual help. His regime is a vast improve-
ment on that of Hughes. The new man has an
engaging frankness and courtesy: he politely suffers
the inexperienced and youthful, at whom Billy would
at times direct a choice piece of sarcasm. In
truculent moods, Billy’s negatives wiere defiant:
Bruce’s are mostly accompanied by an explanation of
why, they are negatives, given in a spirit of trust.
He frequently takes the pressmen into his confidence
on subjects in negotiation witli Downing-street, on
which publication would have the most embarrass-
ing effects. Always his confidence has been re-
spected ; hence, no doubt, the remarks to the calico
merchants.
“Max A.”: Melbourne’s twain of afternoon dailies
in their rush to get ahead of each other are falling-
over their own feet. The other day the Herald
mixed up the A.L.P. row in Sydney with the coal
strike, and remarked that, while the status of the
expelled leagues and councils would be fully restored,
“the owners will insist upon an undertaking that stop-
pages of work will cease.” Then-the Sun under the
captions, “Spooning Question —Should It Be Raised ?”
argued it out for a half-column, ending a par by
asking “Should a Woman Flirt?” and proceeding:
“Speculation is rife concerning the likely composi-
tion of the Australian party to accompany Mr.
Bruce to London”; and so on for the rest of the
column. Best of all, the Sun’s cherished “Moving-
Picture Show-” department rounded off one day with:
“Any kind of useful hint regarding the home —cook-
ing, cleaning, dressmaking, care of the children —
will find a place in this column. Mother Elwood
would like a good recipe for jam fritters.”
“Clifford Snook” : When the unnecessary frills had
been put upon it the cablegram was printed' like this:
“Borde, accused of an amazing series of burglaries,
which earned him the nickname of the French
Raffles, made a daring attempt to escape from Sante
prison. With much labor, Borde sharpened one of
the posts of his bed, and pierced a hole in the wall
of his cell. He worked every night with the patience
of the Count of Monte Cristo in order to make
the hole large enough for him to squeeze through.”
Apparently a once familiar masterpiece has flopped
into forgetfulness. Edmond Dantes, the ignorant,
sunburned sailor, was certainly in gaol, and he
blossomed into a tall, pale, inscrutable, unaccount-
able evening-dress Count after his escape. But he
was no borer and burrower. He would be in his
cell yet, unknown, unrecorded and dog-poor, but for
the wonderful old Italian priest who was doing a
life sontence, with the option of renewal, on the
ether side of the wall as thick as a pyramid, and
who gnawed his way in, and adopted Dantes, and
educated him. and informed him about buried trea-
sure, and gave him his start towards the peerage.
Probably even Borde, the burglar, who spoiled the
story again by being recaptured on the outer wall,
knew enough not to take himself for Dantes; and
Dantes, by the way, didn’t make his final exit through
any old hole.
“Sol. M.”: This world would be a happier place
if fallen idols wouldn’t take to contributing to the
press. Kaiser William, who appeared in serial
form as well as between boards, was lamentable.
He is now on the shelf where the great reductions
are and where few offers are refused. Lloyd George is
as dull as a wet day in his own country. He was
driven to throw himself on the bosom of the news-
paper-reading public, he explained, because many
years of office-holding had left him poor. Of course
this is deplorable; still no man has a right to make
other people miserable for a living-. Possibly George
would be a chirrupy writer if it was orthodox for
him to put into his letters all the horrid secrets he
gathered in the course of his long career; but even
that is doubtful. A subject is a hand}' thing for a
writer, but the writer is more important than the
subject. One man may make a brilliant column
about the death of a Presbyterian elder; and another
might .be given a private view of the end of the
world and not make a readable paragraph about it.
Now the affluent W. M. Hughes has been engaged by
Sydney Telegraph and other papers to write articles
at fixed dates, whether the spirit moves him or not.
■Hughes was once known as an active penman on “The
Case for Labor,” and he collaborated with one Dick
in a “brochure”- on Federation. But the case for
Labor is no longer his case,, and Federation is rather
an old topic. And it would seem bathetic for
Hughes to write trenchantly as to what should be
done about the amendment of the Constitution, the
making of new States, the South-to-North railway, or
any other matter qf, size, for he always professed
complete inability to make up his mind about them.
It wouldn’t be appropriate for him to write about
a sinking fund, or even about the need for a uniform
insolvehey law, for his Government used to introduce
the necessary Insolvency Bill and then forgot about
it. A Prime Minister who was oolitically cut off
in the middle of his policy naturally carries the
battle into the press, but no onp knows that Hughes
was cut off in the middle of anything save his salary,
and perhaps a few War Precautions.

Stella Power, who has a time ahead of her
when technical criticism will abase itself
and everything in the newspaper garden
will be lovely, had more tumultuous applause
from her second Saturday-night audience at
Melbourne Town Hall than at her first con-
cert. Putting vivacity into her manner, and
giving exacting numbers for encores, the
charming young artist made it clear that
her voice-production is almost as flawless
as her beautiful soprano. When she warbles
Sven more directly from the lips, as Melba
does, and is less afraid of straining her
mouth, her reproduction of the Melbaic tone
should make her famous. It has to be re-
membered that Stella Power even now is
considerably younger than Melba was when
she made her ddbut in Europe, and what is
said of her lack of dramatic force in inter-
pretation was said of Melba right up to
the year when she first returned to Australia.
If the younger woman continues to perfect

her fine vocalism,
to study her enun-
ciation in English
as closely as she
seems to have
studied it in
French, and to
guard against ex-
cess of plumpness,
there must be a
great future for
her. Her voice
has beautiful qual-
ity, purity and
freshness; her trill
is memorable; her
top note is almost
higher than it
ought to be, while
her lowest are deep
beyond her years.
Judging from her
generous perform-
ance on Saturday
she has the throat
that mak e s for
lasting fame. She
sang many dif-
ferent sorts
of compositions—
Mozartian or Tra-
la-la', the Hindu
Chant (which she
repeated) or “Min-
netonka” —and had
her flautist been
Lemmone she might
have rivalled the Melba of old in her fluent
warble of the Mad Scene from “Lucia.”
The supporting company is interesting.
William James, back in Australia after 10
years,, is a pianist of class, with a touch
of that chill severity which is noticeable
in Donald Mcßeath, the violinist, who gets
a fine full tone, but is disinclined to play
the music that would tempt him to sugary
strains. And Waldemar Seidel’s accom-
paniments are excellently done.

Melbourne’s orchestral drought was broken
on Saturday by the Musicians’ Union, with
Alberto Zelman as conductor. A combina-
tion of 70 or so, including a good percentage
of capital performers, devoted, in the first
place, an hour of conscientious labor to
the “Pathetic” Symphony. Before that
familiar classic had concluded. with due
solemnity an appreciative audience felt that
Zelman and his brother-professionals de-
served well of it. There were some great
moments in the Symphony’s chequered
career, and the general response to the con-
ductor’s excited appeals indicated a good
understanding between captain and crew. If
the effect was sometimes slurred, the musi-
cal work never slumped. In short, it was
good enough for anyone to be out of the
sunshine and into that atmosphere of
Tschaikowsky and fitful gloom. Beethoven’s
“Leonore” Overture, especially in its old-
fashioned finale of passion triumphant and
tumult victorious, was as successful in its
way as the long symphony; but the hack-
neyed overture to “Tannhauser” was mostly
a reminder that the same thing has been
better played by poorer orchestras in the
same building. There was a point at which
the interpretation seemed in danger of nod-

ding and dropping off to sleep. A very pass-
able rendering of Charpentier’s “Depuis le
Jour,” by Maude Zelman, had a charming
orchestral accompaniment. The next concert
will be on May 19 —a matinde.

Melbourne Town Hall. And his reputation

Friday night brings two of the J.C.W.

female vote, “Woman to Woman” makes
way for “Smilin’ Through.”

At Melbourne King’s, a novelist, a poet
and an airman who lives in his uniform are
paying homage to Diana Wilson. The novel-
ist has to settle her bills, as well as pay
her homage, but whether the poet will as
cheerfully produce the needful when he mar-
ries her, the comedy doesn’t state.

* # * :K
Most of the younger generation who
haven’t seen “Conn the Shaughraun” accept
it as a novelty in its new film form at Mel-
bourne Majestic. The picture is entitled
“My Wild Irish Rose,” and a few appro-
priate jigs from the orchestra help the
atmosphere of artless sentimentality which
the old-fashioned drammer requires. “The
Silent Vow,” which follows, whisks the
audience away to North-West Canada, where
brave hearts beat under the uniform of the
famous Mounted Police. The superman of
the force is unloosed in this fiction, and plain
people yearn for him to do something mean
or trivial just to relieve the pain of his un-
bearable heroism. Hoyt’s people are too para-
lysed by the wonders of their new D. W.
Griffiths opus, “One Wild Night,” to spare
an adjective for the rest of their programme.
The tale is full of unbridled mystery and
ingenious humor, but it suffers from the
Griffiths fault of over-elaboration. “The
Old Nest,” a sob on the ancient subject of
muvver love, has brought the wet season in
early at the Britannia.

At the Vic. Artists’ picture-palace;—
W. B. Mclnnes adds further to his reputation
with a couple of fine portrait canvases in the autumn
show of the Vic. Artists’ Society. His commissioned
study of two kiddies of some social tonnage has a
birthday-party aspect, but the painting reveals that
he was thinking of something higher than the fee.
His more appealing view of a fair-headed lad hold-
ing a football is another example of his uncom-
promising veracity with regard to child life. Charles
Wheeler comes next in importance by registering
gentle piety on the face of an elderly parson. The coun-
tenance of the dark lady of the sonnets in “A Quiet
Hour,” by G. R. Growcott, seems to have been
caught between two expressions. The flesh is also
rather pallid ; still, a curious air of distinction lin-
gers about the model. Portia Geach has a day-out
with her strident palette in a snapshot of an Oriental
person. Possibly the eyeglasses and the suggestion
of hauteur in her picture of Mrs. Cowan, M.L.A.
(Perth), make that excellent lady resemble one of
the old snublesse. C. E. James’s damsel in lilac is
not successful in trying to strike a classical Greek
pose with a vase. Nor is Miss Pye’s sketch of a
nurse (No. 13) sufficiently spirited to arrest atten-
tion. The odd, new name of Hardy Tiarks is
appended to two or three canvases that might be mis-
taken by the short-sighted for colored photographs.
He draws well —the nymph in No. 109 is unim-
peachable in contour —but he frizzes out boiling
surf like the wool on a prize sheep. George Bell
contributes a slick head of Clewin Harcourt, and his
red-lipped girl near by has a pre-Raphaelite droop
of feature. J. Beament’s industry as a landscapist
is noted with approval. He is beginning to paint
the bush without the sentimentality and prettiness
of the Victor Zelman and Delafield Cook school.
Zelman promised well a couple of years back, but he
is becoming trite and academical. The honest paint-
ing of R. McCann, as seen in a bit of Devonport
(Tas.), is entitled to more respect than the sharp
emphasis of the sun’s radiance in E, Buckmaster’s
farmscape, or the false assertion of color and style
in Norman McGeorge’s “Mouth of the Darebin
Creek.” One can hardly see the scenery for the
brushwork in V. M. Griffin’s “The Basket Willow,”
while J. J. Collins continues to select trees that
throw tarantula-like shadows on the foreground.
Louis McCubbin’s “Wattle at Yarra Bend” is better
than his interior, “Study in Blue and Gold,”
wherein the young lady at the table seems a little
stiff and self-conscious. Herbert Rose hangs an
ingratiating memento of a farm that has a familiar
look, and Dora Wilson’s unfaltering draughtsmanship
earns an honorable mention in the back view of a
nude. Blanche Cade exercises her pastel in making
a homely old dame presentable, and Gwendolyn
Stanley Grant is represented by four or five impres-
sions of no marked character in either landscape or
portraiture. Ninety per cent, of the water-colors
are sadly commonplace, and of the remainder only
Sturgess’s atmospheric efforts are really first-class.
He is a poetic observer of still days on sea and land,
and his achievement is more conspicuous with every
performance. The Society, by the way, advertises
a new sculptor, whose life-size “Water Nymph” in
bronze is a delightful young person.

not played during the season with more
charm and power than he did on Monday,

want to tell the pleasant-faced singer that
his was the one heart in all the assembly

that musical comedy and _ the filw> s

the ease and grace with _ which he

spoiled by the readiness of his audiences to
laugh at the wrong time. The Two Vaga-
bonds, whose facile violin- and piano-playing
is warmly applauded, deserve a better name.
Edgar Benyon, who attempts almost every-
thing in the vaudeville line, earns a mention ;
also ventriloquist David Poole, whose turn,
however, is a few minutes too long.

Adelaide Royal has been taking a rest and
making some structural changes to stage the
massive effects of “Cairo,” just beginning;
the back (North-terrace) approach to the

Meanwhile, the competing variety pro-

the Majestic the Staig sisters have at least
one new thrill in their reckless act, the
Molinaris are singing charmingly, and Daisy
Jerome is just due. The P. of Wales has
a lot of new turns, including the elocution-

that Parliament was a dull place now that Mr.
Hughes had ceased to be Prime Minister.”
No pungent language, no explosive scenes,
No epithets that cut like sword or sabre 1
No one to give the Country Party beans
} Or lay the lash upon the hide of Labor 1
A Baptist bunfight opened by a Mayor
Would be a more hilarious affair.
Interrogated Ministers unload
Smooth platitudes and ceremonious phrases;
No interjector’s dubbed a cesspool toad,
No questioner consigned to blithering blazes ;
And ginger i’ the mouth no more is hot
Since Billy from his eminence was shot.
That acrid tongue could always raise a row,
No influence so gloriously discordant
E’er livened legislation up. But now
No biting gibe, no innuendo mordant
Sets off the Chamber in an angry buzz.
It gives a chap the pip, I’ll swear it does.
A poor old place, sans Hughes, is Parliament
For warrior souls like mine. No snap, no color,
Debate’s become a spiritless event,
No stagnant ditchwater was ever duller.
The zest of it has vanished and the pep;
There’s little pleasure now in being a Rep.

AT OUR SHOW CONCERT.
MR. WAYBACK (proud of his daughter's
singing) : “Howlin' success, that’s what
I calls ’er!”
“F.L.H.” : Buckstone’s old Adelphi drama,
“The Flowers of the Forest,” was the play
in which Melbourne theatregoers first saw
Eloise Juno. That was in April, 1867, at
the Royal. It was a strong cast: Madame
Celeste as Cynthia, Miss Mortimer as
Lemuel, C. Vincent and J. J. Welsh as
Ishmael and his friend Pharos, Harwood as
the Kinchin, and T. S. Bellair as Capt. Lav-
roek. The Stewart family was well repre-
sented ; Richard, senior, was Cheap John,
and Maggie wore Abigail’s habiliments,
while Doey was Lady Agnes. Eloise, of
course, was Starlight Bess, and, allowing
for the fact that her ayont-the-Tweed accent
was rather prominent in those days, her im-
personation was a striking piece of work.
After the drammer she obliged with “The
Bonnie Fishwife,” a turn with which she
had pleased her ain folk in M.L. before
coming to Australia.
“Orb”: The last time I saw Eloise Juno
on the stage was with Tyrone Power and
Edith Crane at Melb. Princess’s in 1901.
She was a particularly mild virago in the
revolutionary tribunal scene in “The Only
Way,” but was much more effective as the
gentle old mother of the two boys in Belas-
co’s “Charity Ball.” On the first night
of “The Only Way” the over-anxious Eloi.se
.anticipated a cue, and inadvertently cut out
Gus Glover’s entire part. She left him not
one word to say. That is, till the curtain
fell; the stentorian Glover was fluent enough
then.
“Fidsnap”: The late Fred Cambourne won
a lot of humorous recognition through his
abnormally protuberant nose. 1 remember
him as an English sergeant keeping order in
the court when Andrew Mack was being tried
for sedition in one of his Irish plays. Cam-
bourne’s scarlet countenance, with the pro-
nounced growtn in front, aroused roars of
laughter whenever he opened his head to
bellow “Order!” to the pathriots who were
cheering Mack. I have another recollec-
tion of him as Smee in “Peter Pan,” when
lie toiled at the sewing-machine with his
proboscis hanging over the wheel, as if it
were a carver about to be sharpened. Man-
agements exploited his extremity to some
extent. The success of the old cadger he
played in “Lightnin’ ” was due not to the
acting, but to the frost-bitten look of his
bowsprit, which seemed to imply that, with
a bit more cold weather, it would have a
dewdrop on the end of it.
“Whitebait”: The lady who complained
that “the reference books are coyly silent as
to when Julius Knight was born,” couldn’t
have consulted the right authorities. The
one I looked up states plainly that Julius first
saw the light in Dumfries, Scotland, in 18(53.
Not so long back I met one of his old school-
fellows, who remembered him as Tom Fitz-
patrick, and hailed the great man as such in
the street. Julius, I learn, was a good boy
at school, and was deeply devoted to his
family. He used to be smart at Latin, and
could spout the old Roman authors by the
yard.
“Second Murderer”: Apropos “Santan-
der’s” comments on the stars who occasion-
ally fail to coruscate at matinees (B.
26/4/’23), the late William F. Hawtrey was
a great offender. When “A Message from
Mars” was being first played at Sydney
Palace, Hawtrey, who was an ardent crick-
eter, would wander off and leave Percy Walshe
to juggle the part without any word of
warning. Walshe would ask the stage-
doorkeeper, “Is the old man in yet?” and
if the answer was “No,” he would assume
the Tramp’s dilapidated clobber and play
the part as a matter of course. Even Haw-
trey admitted that, for an Australian,
Walshe played it dashed well, old chap,
what? Walshe was a first-rate man at sav-
ing the situation. Robert Brough took sud-
denly ill just before a performance of “The
Second in Command,” and Walshe climbed
into the boss’s khaki and got through a
long part with honors.
“V.C.”: Evidently “Cartot” (B. 19/4/’23)
did not find the right brand of history-book,
for the appointment of Court Jester is still
in force. George Robey was given the billet
by Edward VII. when Dan Leno resigned.
Incidentally, there are quite a number of
similar jobs, all more or less nominal, which
the King can bestow either as royal camou-
flage for charity or as a mark of distinction,
or for no particular reason at all. The
King’s Challenger, for instance, gets a per-
manent retainer for the arduous duty of
throwing down a gauntlet and defying' the
world on behalf of the King at each corona-
tion. Billy Hughes, on one of his frequent
visits to the U.K., is said to have been much
struck with the King’s Challenger idea, and
might have appointed a similar functionary
for himself had his reign lasted.
“C. Ockney”: “J.R.A.” i(B. 12/4/’23)
calls Edwin Booth an eminent actor. He
certainly was-—in America. But that coun-
try’s opinion on Shakspearean acting differs
vastly from that of England, as was proved
not only in Booth’s case but also when the
otherwise-admirable Daly company essayed
the Bard in London. Likewise Lawrence
Barrett, John McCulloch and Richard Mans-
field could not convince Londoners that they
were up to the mark as Shakspearean actors,
although they were idolised in the U.S.A.
One should not, of course, wholly trust to
one’s memory after a lapse of so many years,
but a stage-struck youngster’s impressions of
the theatre are very vivid, as a rule, and I
submit that my remarks on the acting of
Booth and his company were just. “L.H.P.”
denies (B. 29/3/’23) that the leading man
was vilely supported, and quotes the names
of the principal players. In doing so he
goes far to prove my case, for no one who
knows anything of the English stage would
deny that Edmund Leathes, John Beau-
champ and Thomas Swinbourne were but
second-raters. Barren, excellent comedian
as a rule, was quite out of his element, and,
as “L.H.P.” admits, Miss Gerard was a
failure as Ophelia—as she was in subse-
quent roles. However, they are all defunct,
and it is ill work flogging a dead actor. Re-
turning to “J.R.A.” for a moment, I may
remind him that h# who excuses accuses.
There may have been other reasons for
Booth’s failure in England, but, as I pointed
out, the principal reason was Booth him-
self. In spite of the “beautiful eyes and
musical voice,” Walter Gooch, the Princess’s
manager, never recovered from the disas-
trous season of the American tragedian.
“C.M.” : “Whitebait” gives Robert Ross’s
version of Wilde’s “Salome” trouble wth
Bernhardt (B. 12/4/’23), and seems to pre-
fer it to Sherard’s. However, Leonard Cress-
POSTER REFLECTIONS.
THE SCEPTIC: Andsome , yes! But, my Qawd, could a
woman trust ’im?"
well Ingleby, in his book on Wilde, upholds
Sherard, and so does Edgar Saltus. “Salome”
was written in foreigners’ French, but be-
fore Bernhardt took it to Paris with her
for production at her own theatre, Wilde
had had it revised and polished by various
collaborators, principally Stuart Merrill, ti 1
in its new form it satisfied the actress. Then
the crash came, and she rejected it; and
although she made Wilde promises of help
she never kept them. Had Sarah only bought
the play for the few pounds the desperately
hard-up author was willing to accept, she
would have made one of the most profitable
investments in dramatic history. The suc-
cess of “Salome” has been extraordinary.
“Arthenice”: “Machete” (B. 19/4/’23)
contradicts my statement that “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” was a satire on Handel. In
Johnson’s Life of Gay it is expressly stated
that the opera was written in ridicule of the
musical Italian drama. True, Charles
Pearce, in “Polly Peachum,” maintains that
“what Gay had in mind was not ridicule
but rivalry” ; but other biographers support
Johnson’s view. It is certain that Gay’s
work not only “hit Handel hard in the box-
office,” as “Machete” says, but drove the
artificial Italian opera from the English
stage. Nor is “Machete” quite accurate in
saying that the thing had no composer.
Admittedly the greater part of the music
consisted of old English airs; but these
were collected and arranged by Dr. Pepuscli,
founder of the Academy of Ancient Music.
Pepusch also contributed some tunes of his
own, but he was not a profoundly original
composer, and lie stole freely from Handel.
As to another of “Machete’s” points, the
word “opera” was variously used in the 18th
century, and denoted almost any play with
music. 5 Italian opera itself was largely
spoken drama, interspersed with set pieces;
the continuous musical drama which we call
opera was not vet born.
“Full Point”: “T.P.” (B. 12/4/’23)
alleges that one of the exhibits in the case
of a boy-liousebreaker at Wodonga (V.)
was a skeleton-lcey which the youth had made
from directions given in a Yankee film. I
say that a film giving such directions would
never be allowed in this country, were any-
one senseless enough to produce it. JNot till
“T.P.” names the picture he refers to will
I believe him. Incidentally, I know
many films—l have to —but I m not
acquainted with one that so distorts the
young mind as the average penny dreadful
sold all over the country.
“Speck”: “Nord” (B. 12/4/’23) needn’t
be downhearted. Some of the lesser known airs
in “Maritana” may have been composed else-
where, but “Scenes that are Brightest cer-
tainly floated into Wallace’s mind as be sat
on the balcony of the old Bush Inn at New
Norfolk (Tas.) and gazed on the wonderful
reflections in the Derwent. _ New Norfolk s
Oldest Inhabitant never claimed more than
that.
“J.F.H.” (Bond.) : A bitter controversy
has been excited by the proposal of Alfred
Butt and Charles B. Cochran to bring two
lots of negroes, 300 in all, across
the Atlantic to do plantation turns
at the Empire and the Pavilion. Aus--
tralian Daphne Pollard has been dragged
into the argument. “Why
are Nelson Keys ana
Daphne Pollard unem-
ployed?” Butt was asked.
“That question should have
heen addressed to them and
aot m e,” h e retorted.
"Both refused three-figure
engagements for the Empire
before the colored artists
were engaged. One was
offered ±250 a week to
appear in this very revue,
the other £l5O. Both de-
clined, demanding £5O a
week mo r e.” Daphne’s
finances ’must be in an amaz-
ingly flourishing condition if
she would rather be out of
a “shop” than accept £l5O
a week.
“New Farm” : Six months
ago Hugh D. Wilson, some-
time general manager of
the Union Picture Theatre,
Brisbane, and Haldane, one
of Phillip Lytton’s mum-
mers, left for South Africa
with the calamitous made-
in-Australia film, “The Man
They Could Not Hang.”
They reached Jo’burg just
when the leaders of the Red
Rebellion were about to be
executed. Owing to the elec-
trical atmosphtere prevail-
ing, the authorities inter-
vened, and “The Man”
wasn’t permitted, to hang or
flicker either. Wilson and
Haldane moved on to Eng-
land, and have since been
working steadily through
the U.K. with the celluloid
catastrophe. “The Man
They. Could Not Hang” is
at present advertising Aus-
tralia in Wales. What’s
the usa of having a cinematograph censor-
ship if films, like this unpleasant thing are
not only suffered to be made and exhibited
here, but are allowed to go forth to the ends
of the earth?
“Fax”: Multitudinous are the absurdities
talked on theatrical subjects by artless
prattlers, but this, from Melbourne Herald,
would take beating :
One of the quaint delusions cherished by people
who seldom think about stage technique, and more
especially by flappers who never think at all, is
that actors just stroll on and say whatever comes
into their heads.
Now, whoever cherished that delusion? Even
flappers are not such idiots as the Herald
man declares in order to appear compara-
tively wise himself. If they have never
acted themselves they probably know a girl
who forgot the author’s lines and had to
be prompted. As for “stage technique,” why
should the average paying guest at a theatre
think more about the cooking and serving
of a satisfactory entertainment than of the
preparation of a good dinner at the board-
ing-house ?
“H.N.” : In America the person w’ho gets
a complimentary ticket for the theatre, de-
servedly or otherwise, is invited to contri-
bute 10 or 15 cents to the Distressed Actors’
Fund. It is a. notion that might be intro-
duced here % Sixpence on each single ticket
and a shilling- on an “admit two” would
grow into something handsome for those
Australian Poverty Pointers who have aban-
doned, or been abandoned by, the ungrateful
stage.
“Hamfat”: There is a crueller way of
expressing disapproval of a show than hiss-
ing the performers or walking out of the
theatre. Out of the silence of the audience’s
boredom comes a sharp metallic clink. A
copper coin lands on the stage; then an-
other and another; the tempo increases;
the drip becomes a shower. I suppose
that the chucked coin is a succinct criti-
cism of the player’s value. There is a
cold humiliation about it, anyway, that
makes a hoot seem almost like a kindness.
THE ABANDONED FILM
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A difficulty has arisen regarding the release of
the film of the Bramham fox hunt, in which Viscount
Lascelles is featured as the star. Viscount laseelles
at first objected to many of the sub-titles, and when
these were deleted it seemed that the trouble was
over. The newspapers then began to refer to the
Viscount as a film star, and he objected to the picture
altogether.”—Sun.
Cadwallader F. Bunk perdooced the flick
(He was the first to dose his custard-pies,
And make a film-star genuwinely sick).
A he-man realist was Bunk. No flies
Was on C.F. Soon as he seen the Vike,
“Doug will play him,” sezzee. “A jockey’s cap
Of green and gold; a scarlet jacket like
These golf gazooks put on; a cane to slap
His noble breeches with, and there you are: —
ton a Lascedles Dressed and Ready for the
Chase.”
His wife was billed as the supporting star
In hat with feathers drooping to the face,
A velvet skirt and fur-topped riding-boots
(She’s Sudden Death on Foxes, Wild or Tame).
Lord 1 How Los Angeles yells, cheers and roots
When Mary, as the Princess of that name,
Rides forth with Doug an’ ninety spotted dogs 1
They duly meet the ruined village maid,
And Lascelles her betrayer soundly flogs;
Then, as the hunting party through a glade—
Guns loaded, sheath-knives ready-—slowly rides,
The cry is heard: “A fox 1 Ahoy! Ahoy!”
The Viscount’s Aral) steed with eager strides
Bounds forward. (On, this Vike is sure Some
Bov!).
But Princess Mary’s Shetland at a fence
Comes down, and while she lays unconscious there,
The local Ku Klux Klarismen through the dense
Thorn hedge beside tile roadway bust. They bear
Her senseless form to where a motor waits.
Next Part : The Kit Knux Chieftain’s Mountain
Cave.
The Viscount : “Lead me to her. Oh, ye Fates!”
The Captive: “Hands off! Free me, scurvy
knave !’’
You get the notion, bo ? That film was done
Regardless absolootl.v of expense.
Yet when the Viscount seen it he begun
A stream of oaths so full of vehemence,
So loud and tierce that, “Can it, Vike,” says i.
“Sooner than show ’er now I’d take an’ die.”
But here's what’s biting' Bunk an’ me as well:
What peeved the Vike? What got his goat? Oh,
hell!

HE SALESMAN who can design and write
his own Show Cards and execute his own
advertising matter is not only invaluable in
the way of obtaining business for his employer,
but can succeed on his own account.
The art of designing becomes a fascinating
pleasure, that, once you have mastered the theory,
you feel you must go on till you make it a
highly payable and pleasant occupation.
In a few lessons you will be able to do plain
ticket writing, and then advance until the most
elaborate and artistic show card is in your
power to execute.
The Course consists of 12 lessons covering
every branch of Show Card and Ticket writing,
and includes Good Lettering and Figures, Design,
Flat Washes, the Use of Colors, Ideas, where
and how to look for them. A special individual
Letter of Criticism and advice is sent direct to
the student with the corrected work. This is
even more valuable than the lessons. No special
artistic ability required. A practical course by
a practical man.
Many purchasers have written similar to O.
W. Owen, of Newcastle, who recently wrote:—
“I can’t see how you ask so little, while
others with far inferior courses get from £l3
to £20.”

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Light the Binnacle: It isn’t a question of
rolling the “r.” If you can detect no difference
between “lawn” and “lorn,” or “cawed” and “cord,”
your ear needs tuning Alkaloid: Looks as if the
artist had to get Maoriland in somehow and there
was no room for it in the proper place.... Plodder:
Both are nice, but both want a sharper point at
the end. “Bhythm” is one syllable.... Rebus: The
“Mile Stone” is a heavy lump of clay... .Epictetus:
Can’t find the point... .W.S.T.: The verse doesn’t
say anything by way of comment on the quotation.
.... VV'.II.L.: Up with “The Curtain” :
As youth rushes madly on
In front of our veiled eyes like a river,
While the rival of life, as sharp as a knife,
The strongest bond it can siver.
As we sail along, full of mirth and song
Like a ship on the calmest ocean,
We eat and drink, but never think
Of the Captain who keeps it in motion.
... . A.D.A.8.: Your horse seems to be made of wood.
.... Starving Dentist: All that to say that a man
had a fit in the train... .Lex M.: Put some more
meat into your stew M.J.T.C.: It had possibilities,
but you let it flop to nothing... .T. Jimm: The
yarn doesn’t make its point, and the verse is calami-
tous. Can’t remember the faults and virtues of the
other... .T.W.0.: Both are far too crude....
M.8.R.: Begins well, but a line with two extra feet
would spoil most things. .. .John F.: Lacks imagina-
tion .... M.J.D.: Solid commonplace... .Jo: Rather
insane without being mirthful A.H.Y.: An idea.
hut you must work it out better than that
Gauwjn: Merely says what everybody has been say-
ing for eight years, and says it in bumps. .. .K.K.:
IVot. nearly up. . . .Bellerive: The balloon incident
carries the real thrill: —
Vivid is my memory, though
Years have passed away
Since, the thrilling balloon ascent
On one public holiday.
Music wafted from a band
On the sunny afternoon
When skyward cleaved the daring man
Within his gas balloon.
To the horror of the huddled crowds
On St. Kilda-road, Domain,
; Suddenly at a height in space
The balloon did burst atwain.
Downward shot the crumpled mass,
And caught between two trees ;
To the spot excited men
Did quickly flock like bees.
Le Strange within the netting lay,
Which was severed by a knife ;
Ringing cheers did rend the air—-
The trees had saved he’s life.
... . G.M.S.: Not well enough cooked.... Q.P.: They
don’t strike us... .C.F.M.: Poor yarn... . J.E.K.: You
don’t make what you should of it V.L.: “Mrs.
Barker” wants some fattening food., . .C.R.C.: Too
much like the explanatory yelps in American picture-
films.... H.S. (Hobart): Showy commonplace....
G.lv. (Toorak) : Not quite; and please look up the
pronunciation of “exquisite” I)o-untc-others: A
crude attempt, which is neither verse nor prose.. ..
W.W. (Narrandera) : Dreadful S.S. W.: If we have
a bad dream to-night you’ll be responsible for it.
. ...L.D. (liillara) : Nicely enough done, but slight.
D.P.M.: Doesn’t get near. ... Jimmy B.: You
saw a cloud ! You strain our credulity.... White
C.: Rugged and doesn’t land all the mirth there
might be in it F. 0.8.: Old thoughts drest in
worn l ags.... G.F . W. : We’re afraid it’s mostly rub-
bish. . . .Q.F. (Whangarei) :No g00d... .Norman Sea:
The frog, the duck and the rest of the menagerie are
all very melancholy Celia W.: Thin, grey and
wobbly.... Splinter: Try “Revolution” again, and
don’t leave long lines out of scansion C.L.C.: It
wanted a point at the end... .R.S.E.: Bumps out
of rhythm too often G.K. (Toorak): Highly moral
and instructive commonplace. We don’t mind the
morality and the instructiveness, but we loathe the
commonplace... .J.J.H.: Altogether too vapid.' * Why,
there isn’t more than a gallon of blood to any page
of it!.... Doris B.: Doesn’t appeal to us... .Jumbo:
Ah, you’ve gone round the old ring.,.. Fred A.:
An old imitation, rather more virulent than usual.
R.G.T.: No interest A.K. (Adelaide): Less.
... .R.E.L.: Poor verse... .Geo. F.: Seems to be
written with a split toothbrush in some language
unknown.... A.L.A.: Poor stuff with astonishing
rhymes.,. .Eileen D.: Too loose and thin A.C.H.:
You take too long to get to your point. Read some
good short stories. .. .Farnum: It scarcely had
strength enough to reach the basket R.Q.8.:
Don’t potter about , like that. When you’ve got a
good dog you don’t have to tie a tin to its tail to
make people look at it... . J.W.: The “Wild Cat”
bad its say on that float when the prospectus first
appeared.... Osric: Let your, pars gently simmer for
12 hours. Three of them in their raw state would
fill a page C.R.T.: Tidy it up; there are loose
ends everywhere. . . .G.A.S.: Haven’t you heard of air-
eddies created by moving objects ?.... A. de L.:
Once more, it’s impossible to sub. typewriting with
no interlinear spaces F.C.8.: Length outruns
interest... .Crispie: But if you drop a horseshoe and
a beer cork down a shaft they won’t hit bottom to-
gether. .. .F.J.K.: The climax wants to be done
better. The rest is all right... .Coram P.: You
travel too far to get there D.L.: A thought in
it; but it doesn’t quite make the weight.... G.:
We’ve had something like it Rusty: A good
pen-name, anyway. The stuff does want brightening.
Bert C.: We love a good lie; but if you couldn't
tell your mother a more convincing one than that
you must have got many a hiding Quid Short;
YVe’ve read your verse; but it’s shaken half our
teeth loose K.E.: A little more polishing and it
will be very acceptable.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A. J.G.: Niggers like that are a great argument for
White Australia A.S.: Drawing weak, and ink
weaker F.G.A.: Nothing in it E.R.S.: Smell-
fuliy 01d... .H.8.D.: Even with his bend amidships

“F.A.” comments (B. 22/3/’23)
on the Maori’s thoroughness as a fort
builder. Granted, but his skill was never
shown on the hills above Anderson’s Bay,
Dunedin. There are no known Maori earth-
works south of Goat Island, Purakanui,
Otago. What “F.A.” took for Maori fort and
earthworks are really the remains of a saw-
mill of the early days of settlement.

Although in Australia but a comparatively
short time,Skalski’s genius has speedily
gained him recognition as a virtuoso of high
calibre. His conductorship of the late State
Conservatorium Orchestra was that of a mas-
ter of performance as well as that of knowledge.
As a pianist whose reputation is better known
in the old-world musical centres than even
it is here, his opinion of the New Beale is
authoritative.
r%iessers. Teale & Co. Ltd.,
Permit me to compliment you
on the production of a small
horizontal piano 'which has
all the attributes of the ideal
solo instrument. For many
months I have been playing
two of your small grands —
one in my home and one in
my studio. At all times they
have responded perfectly to
my work. I find the tone rich
and full and of striking 'vol-
ume. The instrument's flexi-
bility is also something which
has pleased me very much-
permitting of great dynamic
effects with the least amount
of fatigue. One is agreeably
surprised to find these quali-
ties so 'well developed in the
small instrument. It is in the
full-sized concert instruments
that one most readily expects
to find them.

“D.D.”: The old-time telegraphy is
doomed. Every day the machine is displac-
ing hand work. In Australia not only has
the Creed printing system and the Murray
multiplex printing telegraph been installed in
the cities, but arrangements are being made
to tit out all the main country circuits with
direct-printing telegraph instruments, thus
doing away with the highly-skilled operator
and his ancient dots and dashes.
* * * *
“J.P.” "Centre” (B. 8/3/’23,) wants to
know the actual food weight producible by
an acre of bananas in 32 months. Speak-
ing from practical experience, let me tell him
that, everything being 0.K., within 18 months
from planting he should cut from 90001 b.
to 12,0001 b. of fruit, and from double to
three times, and even four ..times, that weight
in the next two years. After that produc-
tion will diminish year by year until the
plantation becomes exhausted. Six to seven
years is the average life. There are records,
hpwever, of some producing marketable fruit
for 20 years, but such instances are excep-
tional.
* * # #
“Verde Gris”: The N. Territory holds the
world’s record for big back-yards. Victoria
River Downs station has an area of 11,500
square miles, which is about the size of Bel-
gium, while Wave Hill, the grazing paddock
alongside it, has 10,700 square miles. The
Barkly Tableland, probably the best pastoral
country in the Territory, is in the hands, pro
tern., of a dozen holders, whose runs vary
from_ 400 to 10,000 square miles apiece. Ter.
ritorians have to think in miles where other
people think in acres, and calculate in weeks
instead of. hours. A few spots are so remote
that Christmas comes once every three years.
“C. Rich”: It happens even within the
Church. In the W.A. Church News Arch-
gaiters Riley, of Perth, makes an appeal:—
I used to possess a little portable organ for use at
occasional services. It has been borrowed, but not
returned. In 1891 I went to Oberammergau, and
was impressed with the simplicity and appeal of the
Gospel story. I had a set of slides (“The Passion
Play”) for a lantern —they were borrowed and have
not been returned. Can any reader help me find
these lost articles?
A lovable old man, esteemed by all denomi-
nations,- and generous to the last copper of
his stipend, is “C.O.L. Perth.” Whoever
“pirated” his musical-box and slides will have
a warm time in the hereafter if there are
any Westralians on the jury.
» * * *
“Cartot” : Recently the food-faker in Aus-
tralia has been turning his attention to the
adulteration of tea. The favorite method
of making two pounds stand where one stood
before seems to be to finely chop up the leaves
of some harmless plant, dry them in the sun,
then pour boiling water over them and, after
steeping them for some hours, again sun-dry
them. This makes them roll up longitudi-
nally and look like tea-leaves. The next step
is to color them with sulphate of iron, which
turns them a uniform black. They are then
added to the genuine tea, and even an expert
cannot at first sight distinguish between
adulterated and unadulterated samples.
‘‘Birre Gurra” : The agent who informed
“Centre” (B. 8/3/’23) that one acre of land
will produce 250,0001 b. of bananas per
annum is—an agent. A first-class farm
here (Blackall Range, Q.), considered equal
to anything in Southern Queensland, could
produce, under careful cultivation and in a
liighly-favorable season, only 54,0001 b. of
actual banana food per acre. That was
with the stools planted 12ft. apart. The
same land planted with stools at 9ft. would
produce, roughly, 71,0001 b. of fruit. I am
game to bet “Centre’s” agent that no farm in
Australia will turn out 250,0001 b. of bananas:
per acre in two years, let alone one. “Centre”
also asks if the N. S. Wales grower receives
as large a return as the man further north.
No! The nearer the tropics the better
bananas thrive.
* * * *
“Caerleon”: What’s the matter with
Cocky? “W.E.” (B. 12/4/’23), a jerry-
builder who lives in the city, and is making
money, asks why the man on the-land passes
his local store and sends to the city for his
goods. I grow a few grapes, and to prevent
them going off I send to the local store-
keeper for a few pounds of crude sulphur.
He charges me 9d. per lb. When I protest,
he cuts it dowm to 3d. per lb. My wife sends
for a small clothes-line —6d., and 3d. cartage.
He charges me Is. 7d. per lb. for bacon; and
I had it landed right here, a flitch, at 3 s. 3d.
When my potatoes were costing me Bs. he
was selling them at 18s. 6d. Gas globes made
in Japan he sells at 45., and I can buy them
in Brisbane for 2s. 6d. At Christmas he
quoted ham at Is. 7d., and later at Is. 9d.
I rebelled, and four hams were landed
from my own co-op. store at Is. 3d. per lb.
The country storekeepers think the cocky is
a fool —-and mostly they are right. They
think he cannot read reports on trade and
finance, giving him the price of his wire,
iron, nails, flour, currants, etc. He can,
but as a rule, he doesn’t.
* * * *
“Pat Eller”: In a Sydney court the other
day a person was fined £lOO for sly-grog
selling. And good enough, slyness being an
abomination, whether in what Mrs. Suburbs
gabbles over the back fence or in what Bill
tells you under the rose about old Jack
being out in a motor with a fairer-haired
blonde than his lawful wife. But observe
that whenever you are convicted of beating
the Government you get it harder in the
neck and closer to the jugular than if you
had only got the blind side of the long-
suffering, short-chinned public. You may
sell milk and water, and if caught get off
at the expense of a small fine, which makes
it profitable to carry on the adulteration
even if you are nabbed twice a week. You
may sell the people dirty food and escape
with a light fine. In spite of the Pure Foods
Act, you may palm off on the public the thing
that is not what it purports to be and still
“get away with it.” But defraud the almighty
Government over a penny stamp or by sell-
ing tuppence worth outside the circumstances
which it has augustly decreed, and a 10-ton
fine, possibly without the option, surely
awaits you. Like the other God, the Gov-
ernment is a jealous one.


“Having tried all sorts of oil sham-
poos for the hair, I And Rexona Soap
incomparable as a shampoo.”
Miss SYLVIA CLIFTON.
“I like Rexona Soap for the hair.
It makes my coiffure stay glossy,, wavy
and in order.”
Miss CONSTANCE WICKS.
“Rexona Soap is by far the best
shampoo for the hair.”
Miss EDITH DRAYSON.
Girls!
“Rexona Soap is unequalled as a
shampoo for the hair.”
Miss RITA LLOYD.
Do you know that in less than ten minutes
you can double the beauty of your hair? It
becomes light, wavy, fluffy, abundant, and
appears as soft, lustrous and charming as
anyone could desire, after a simple wash with
Rexona Soap. A delightful surprise awaits
those whose hair has been neglected, or is
scraggy, dry, brittle or thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust,
dirt, or excess oil, and in a few moments you
have doubled the beauty of your hair. Rexona
Soap dissolves every particle of dandruff,
cleanses, purifies and invigorates the scalp, for
ever stopping itching and falling hair. If you
care to have pretty hair, and lots of it —get a
tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.
•‘I always use Rexona Soap, for I
think there is nothing like it for the
hair.”
Miss LOTUS THOMPSON.
Shampoo it with Rexona Soap.
“I have found Rexona Soap by far
the best as a shampoo for the hair.”
Miss VIOLET CREMIN.
To shampoo or wash the hair with Rexona
Soap is an easy task, but the results are startling.
It leaves the hair in such a beautiful condition,
the scalp perfectly clean and wholesome. The
hair becomes light and fluffy, waving about the
face in abundance, as beautiful hair should
always appear. Rexona Soap leaves a delicate
perfume, invigorating the roots of the hair,
which prevents greyness. A few shampoos
with Rexona Soap effectively remove every
trace of dandruff or loose and falling hair.
Ladies who use it for the hair say that Rexona
Soap is far better than any of the so-called hair
tonics.
“I would not think of usingr any
other soap but Rexona Soap for my
hair, for it is the best I have ever
used,”
Miss MADGE URQUHAKT.

to 500 H.P. should know
something of engine effi-
ciency.
A well-known aviator states:
“After 8000 miles absolutely
trouble-free running , I say
my 6-h.p. B.S.A. Motor
Bicycle is the finest solo
machine I have ever ridden
Such testimony from an experi-
enced rider should decide those
who have not yet found a satisfac-
tory mount to send now for full
particulars contained in the free
illustrated B.S.A. catalogue.
IF you are not yet a
Motor Cyclist, for
entire satisfaction,
ride a B.S.A. You can
obtain it from —

Do You Use a B.S.A. Gun ?
Gone west, at the age of 75, Alexander
Clerke, civil engineer of Launceston (Tas.),
who made the official survey of the river
Tamar.
A Port Adelaide man has put up a record
by being convicted for stealing two lamp-
posts. He pleaded shell-shock, and the
police admitted that he was “very drunk at
the time.”
“T. 0.1. ”: No, The Bulletin’s old vicar
of The Rocks (Sydney) was not first Bishop
of Bendigo; his brother. H. A. Langley, was.
The Rocks man, J. D. Langley, was the
second of Bendigo, and is still alive, aged
about 88.
Clapp loses yet another brainy young
officer. Harry G. Smith, one-time a State-
school teacher and in recent years an engi-
neer at Newport at about £6OO a year, has
turned in that job to become general manage?
for Australasia of the Poldi steelworks at
about £l5OO p.a.
Pine Tuakau, who died at Moawhanga
(M.L.) the other day, was credited with
having reached his 108th year. He fought
the pakeha in the early settlement days; but
later carried a British rifle against his dark-
skinned brothers. For all that the Maoris
bore no malice, and Tuakau’s passing to the
happy hunting-grounds was widely lamented.
“Randolph Rentless”: “Women do not
drink beer or whisky to any great extent;
it is wine that attracts them. In some wine-
shops there are more women to be seen
than men,”, a police official said the other
day:—
Let every lad
Drink beer who can ;
Wine maketh glad
The tart of man!
“Nota Bene”: J. T. H. Whitsitt. M.H.R.
(B. 15/3/’23), was not born in his consti-
tuency (Dahvin, Tas.), but in the North
of Ireland. The State Labor Government
that he put in power lasted for two years,
and only went out after the 1916 elections.
Last December, when' he stood for the Fed-
eral House, out of 92 votes polled in Cooee,
his home village, lie got 89 —which must be
something like a record.
“Alastor”: When Hulton Sams, the
“Fighting Person,” was out in West Queens-
land a friend of his one day catechised the
youngsters about cussing, swearing and tak-
ing the Lord’s name in vain, etc. “What is
cursing V” he asked a demure little blue-eyed
lass. “Please, sir, wishing ill to your neigh-
bor,” she replied. “But try to give me what
you mean in your own words,” he said.
‘Damn your eyes, sir,” she lisped.
“II.II.”: Sydney Telegraph wasn’t in its
best society form on April 21, when it
printed in big capitals “The Duke of York’s
Future Bride,” and, underneath, the portrait
of a monkey with her mouth open. She was
a dubiously respectable monkey, too, for she
possessed a baby. Another effort was said
to represent the bride “at Glamis Castle, her
ancestral home, quietly resting before her
Wedding”; but instead of showing her in bed
in a fortress as might be expected, the lady
was up and fully dressed, and holding on to
a post. This high social racket is very con-
fusing.
“Nugget”: “Nollig’s” friend (B. 12/4/’23)
doesn’t hold the Commonwealth’s record yet,
though his score of 32 olive branches takes
beating. The King family, of Wollombi
(N.S.W.), numbered 33. They were all the
offspring of the same parents, and came
along one at a time. The mother was a
fresh-faced woman looking years younger
than she had any right to look. I still re-
call the sight of a bright little lady conduct-
ing a bullock-dray between Wollombi and
Maitland while her lord and master reclined
on the load. It was Mrs. King back at work
after a brief “holiday.”
“Kelvin”: There were worse objects in
khaki than “2nd Divvy’s” conscientious
objector (B. 8/3/’23). A British troopship
from Alexandria, with a few M.L. nurses
(who shouldn’t have been there) aboard, was
torpedoed in the Gulf of Salonika in ’l5. A
Tommy sergeant, finding himself awash, dog-
paddled to one of the ship’s small rafts, cap-
able of carrying six persons, pushed three
nurses back into the water to drown, and
shouted hysterically : “I object—one man, one
raft!” He was duly picked up, taken to
Salonika, court-martialled, and, on the evi-
dence of his own officer, well and truly shot.
“Randolph Rentless” : A man of 88 turned
up at a Sydney police court the other day
on a charge of drunkenness, and was fined five
bob or the rising. But this isn’t the record.
Not long ago a Sydney policeman spied a
white-whiskered old drunk who was crooning
gay songs as he skipped along the street
with a bedraggled female on each arm. Not
liking the look of the “ladies” the John Hop
essayed to rescue the oldster, who promptly
offered to fight him. Next day the bellicose
gent, told the Court that he had been cele-
brating his 90th birthday; and that was
corroborated. A magistrate, who probably
felt some envy, fined the old man, but paid
out of his own pocket.
The Victorian police will not get as much
in pensions as they are looking for if Acting-
Premier McPherson dominates the Cabinet.
He is willing to plank down a pound for
every note the men in blue rustle out of
their pockets in fortnightly contributions,
but that doesn’t satisfy those who have come
in since Shiels abolished police pensions 21
years ago. At the back of the Treasurer’s
mind is the fear that whatever the Force’s
moiety is the State will nave to find it as
well as its own share. For there is sure to
be an agitation for increased pay as soon as
a. Pensions Act is passed and proclaimed—
and pre-election manoeuvres of that sort are
nearly always successful.
“Lexite”: There is no narrow-mindedness
about Dr. Bickersteth, a canon of Canter-
bury, (Eng.), now touring Australia. He
lias been telling religious audiences who
would probably be shocked if lie wasn’t a
canon that he favors early morning and even-
ing services on Sunday, the rest of the day
being devoted to the pursuit of fresh air.
Bishop Julius, of Christchurch (M.L.), was
the first Australasian cleric to take this sort
of stand. Twenty years ago he announced
that he himself took athletic exercises every
Sunday morning, and, although he believed
people should go to church, he preferred the
young men who went out playing cricket
or tennis to those who idled out the day on
street corners. This shocked the godly of
Christchurch, and when the Cathedral shortly
afterwards suffered from earthquake they
attributed it to the wrath of God,

Can You Tell the Cause
of Your Trouble?
Are you sometimes discouraged, and think you’ll never get any better V
Can you tell what is the matter with you, or what makes you sick ? . Do
you know that about nine-tenths of all sickness is caused by Kidney Trouble t
Have you ever stopped to think that your kidneys may be the cause of your
poor health?
Most people do not realise how much work the kidneys are required to do
every day.
Every drop of blood in the body must pass through and be filtered by the
kidneys thousands of times a day.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, if the hills offered one pine-dark
breast "** , .
Whereon the body and the soul
might rest,
Folded in mountain arms!
(Some dim, wild-violet nest,
Sweet as if goddess-prest —
There to be wrapt for ever from all harms .)
Or where the sea far spreads its silken calms
To find a turquoise bed,
And to strong peace be wed,
While Frailty sets her face towards the
land,
The bright hair of her head
Outblown, and o’er her shed
Salt foam, a crown of thorns within her
hand—
Her feet have printed every amber strand.
Oh, she is sweet to see,
Yet would the soul be free,
And lift the sleepless yoke, and find its rest
In one sure, utter love,
Broad as the sky above,
And yet no broader than a human breast,
Clipt in unchanging arms, yet dearly prest.
So many transient fires—
Bruised wings of blind desires
Innumerous as the Foam-born’s flying doves;
Sea salt within the mouth.
Sere deserts of the South,
Strange weakly hates begotten upon loves!
Svelt pleasure like a seeking panther roves —
Ah! tireless panther feet
Your quarry is more fleet —-
As in time’s morning woods, you still pursue.
Now should the long trail cease,
Pleasure o’ertaking peace
In hyacinthine glades of heaven’s blue,
Still rivers of the deep Uranian hue.
All cities, lands and seas
Have seen my loyalties,
My secret gardens of forbidden flowers;
My joys, my knife-like fears,
The winter of my tears,
My sins delivered to the nameless powers;
Altars of blood, and brazen prison towers.
So many, many loves.
Such ’wildering wings of doves!
And yet behind the many waits the One,
Long sought, from life to life,
Through strife and peace and strife,
Through all the soul has done and left un-
done.
The seeking panther found its prey in none.
One Love behind them all,
A pillared temple hall,
And at its threshold halt the panther feet;
Dark as the holy night
Where dwells unuttered light—
Dark as the cave where first I found re-
treat ;
Dark as the couch where heart ’gainst heart
may beat.
Oh, darkness holiest!
Oh, depths and heights of rest!
The panther crouches, and the soul goes in.
Here is the final shrine
Where naught is undivine,
And God’s mute, child-heart questions
“What is sin?”
Love locked in love can neither lose nor
win.
Ah, do I die or live?
Do my lips take or give?
All lives are mine, and every pause of death.
The circle is complete,
Stilled are the panther-feet;
I know the stars of heaven are but a wreath
Dropped by some child where ' Spring buds
break their sheath.
Eternal pulse of Spring,
One with the slumbering
Of the eternal void whence beauties came!
The world-heart is a rose
Of fire cooled with snows.
And I am as a flame within the Flame.

I wake in Eden, laugh, and speak your

DULCIE DEAMER.
Hopping in with Henry.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OP all my friendships I suppose that
with Henry Settle is of longest stand-
ing. It dates from our schooldays—
it was in the corner by the hatpegs, I re-
member, that he one day took a match, non-
chalantly flipped back his eyelids so that for
a moment they somehow stayed back, and by
one fascinating act won my boyish notice and
esteem. Henry has grown, of course, since
then, and his spirits find expression in
fashions less bizarre, but his appearance is
singularly unchanged. The same large,
smooth face; the rather bulbous forehead,
with fine hair like lichen growing well back
and giving him a frank and open look; the
same large nose and mouth and teeth, the last
a little protrudent; the same slight paucity
of chin. These and other things have en-
deared him to me. In such manner as is
fitting I love Henry Settle.
Marriage may dislocate the oldest estab-
lished of such intimacies, but, thanks to
Helen’s tolerance, our relationship remains un-
changed, save that it has acquired a triangular
aspect. Not that the full bouquet, as it were,
of Henry’s personality is always appreci-
ated by Helen. She suffers him, neverthe-
less, to call on us frequently, and I think
extracts pleasure from his visits. There is
something so bright, so softly buoyant about
Henry—despite a plumpness of habit, he em-
ploys a certain aptness of phrase when he
remarks that he has “just floated in.” And
he floats in, as I have said, quite often, for
his business ties are not exacting. He does
something in the London and Polynesian
Bank.
To the comparative lightness of the demands
made by his day’s work may be traceable the
gentle sprightliness which characterises
Henry in his hours of leisure. There are
those, I know, who disparage Henry’s men-
tality—it has been said at the Polynesian
that the strain of tying his bow and choos-
ing his socks in the morning leaves him intel-
lectually debilitated for the day. To the
authors of such taunts I would reply : What,
then, about Henry’s ideas? For he has
ideas—more ideas of a miscellaneous nature
than perhaps any man I know. Few, one
must concede, are of commercial value, but
all are worthy and many beautiful. Take,
for example, Henry’s idea of a book.
The exact source of Henry’s ideas is
occasionally obscure, but the authorship pro-
ject was obviously a direct consequence of
his success with his climbing beans. Even
to an onlooker the affair of the beans was
a little arresting. The scene of the phe-
nomenon was The Gums, Gurner-street,
Glebe, the thin, chrome-colored property, like
a slice off a mortuary, where Henry lodges
with his aunt. Here was a fence—for years
a perfectly nude fence, a mere shabby ap-
pendage of the sooty strip of back yard com-
manded by Henry’s bedroom window. Here,
a few weeks later, was again the fence; but
clothed now in twining emerald, with vege-
tation valuable both for its ornament and
its food. His triumph with the beans
pleased Henry. It pleased Henry’s aunt.
It could not but please, indeed, any person
of sensibility. And it generated in Henry
not only joy and pride but enthusiasm too,
so that for upwards of a week he devoted his
daylight leisure to spade and hoe, and his
evenings : —one inferred from his rather am-
biguous replies to telephone inquiries—to the
works of the leading seedsmen.
It was on the ninth evening that his char-
acteristic manipulation of the front-door bell
informed us that he was again about to float
in. His eyes were bright, his cheeks incar-
nadined with health; about his footsteps
there hung little odors of bonedust. And
presently they were hanging everywhere, for
he was in one of his restless moods, victim to
one of those excitements the significance of
which I knew so well.
“Yes?” I prompted at length.
There is sometimes a slight self-conscious-
ness about Henry at such moments. Helen
fingered a few notes on the piano.
“Yes?” I repeated.
A little shyly Henry extracted from his
pocket a ream or so of London and Poly-
nesian letter-paper—the first section of
“Cloud-wrack and Leaf-mould: Prose Poems
of the Soil.”
It was notorious, said Henry, that
every living soul possessed the material for
at any rate, one book. Personally, he had
scarcely realised until a week before what a
wealth of undeveloped matter littered his con-
sciousness. In the serene atmosphere of his
aunt’s back garden this matter had tended to
cohere, and of the product he was already in
the position to submit some unpolished
samples. Nothing ambitious —a handful of
what he might term literary vignettes. But it
was impossible, said Henry emotionally, to
see the young lettuce springing from the loam,
to glimpse from one’s bedroom window of an
evening the radishes like rows of rosy sentinels
beneath the moon, without a desire to set
down something of what such communion
with simple natural things inspired. More
than once he had been impelled to rise from
his bed for pencil and paper as some fugi-
tive thought took shape. Unpretentious efforts
though they were, to those with imagination
they might not be entirely lacking in appeal.
And there was money in books —it was well
known that no less than a quarter of a million
had been scooped out of “If Christmas
Comes.” One never knew. The thing to do
was to hop in.
Considering that Henry had hopped in
barely a week previously, it seemed to me
that the quantity of matter accumulated did
him credit. It was easy to read, for Henry’s
is a neat and clerkly hand. The title of the
first vignette, “The Call of the Galliopsis,”
had a spirited sound that I rather liked. It
opened on a staccato note. “Morn!” com-
menced Henry, and started a fresh line. “A
summer’s morn!” and filled in portion of
the space still left over with three little dots.
“YVisps of mist trail in the gullies, the
lingering chill of the moon-steeped hours
makes wraiths of vapor of each exuded
breath. Yonder from the east comes the
faint sound of the never-ending wamblings of
the sea. Sad, yet”
“‘Wamblings!’” murmured Helen at my
shoulder.
“If it’s a fair question, Henry,” I asked,
“just what are ‘wamblings’?”
“Wamblings,” said Henry, not displeased,
I think, that the word had not escaped our
notice, were approximately rollings. To
be perfectly frank, he had not intended men-
tioning the sea until he tumbled across
“wamblings” in a dictionary belonging to
his aunt.
“What’s this one?” interrupted Helen,
turning over the page a little impatiently.
“This sounds funnier —‘When the Earth-
worm’s Gone to Rest.’ ”
A little whimsical as to title, perhaps,
granted Henry somewhat stiffly, but none of
them professed to be actually funny. Pos-
sibly we would catch the atmosphere better if
he read it himself.
I can honestly say that Henry’s word pic-
ture of the incidents attending the retiring of
the earthworm —his description of how, as
with close of day it curled tiredly round a
potent narcotic and the breezes sang a
lullaby—was one of the most soothing
things I ever listened to. A trifle long, per-
haps. It is possible that I dozed. Came
presently a sense of the passage of time
and a resharpened consciousness of Henry’s
voice.
■•.... Who can wander in such fragrant
places : —who can pause awhile where the
lupins droop their azure heads, where the
voilets sniggle’ ”
“‘Sniggle,’ Henry!” echoed Helen sharply.
“ ‘Sniggle,’ Henry?” I repeated.
“ ‘Sniggle,’ ” insisted Henry firmly. _ “A
more delicate shade of the thought that is in
snuggle, y’know. That one’s my own.”
Helen pursed her lips; then went over to
the piano and fingered some more notes.
“Of course,” said Henry, again rather
stiffly, “if you’re tired”
What one really wanted, I pointed out,
with stuff like Henry’s, was to soak in it
quietly on one’s own.
And for the time being we left it at that.
During the month or so following we saw
Henry but little. It was essential, he said,
unless one wished to mess round with the
thing indefinitely, to stick to something like a
system, and he was making it a rule not to
go to bed until he had turned out a thousand
words. It was impossible, of course, to
stick to the rule absolutely—sometimes he
went to the limit and even beyond, and some-
times, on the other hand, he went to the pic-
tures. But he was progressing—he was get-
ting on so well, he assured me eventually,
that in a week’s time the book should be vir-
tually finished. Which estimate proved cor-
rect, for a week later he called round with
the completed copy, neatly backed in brown
paper and threaded with red tape.

Are You as Wei I as
You Should Be?
It isn’t right for one to always feel tired, weak—all worn
out. Yet how many folks are constantly ailing, though
seldom sick enough to be in bed! Are you one of these
unfortunates? Do you suffer daily backaches feel dull
and weary —nervous and dispirited? Is your health
slowly slipping away? It s time, then, you were finding
the cause. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold, strain
or overwork lias slowed up your kidneys and brought on
that dull, dragging ache—that soreness, stiffness, lassitude and weariness. You may have headaches,
dizzy spells and annoying kidney irregularities, too. Don’t wait for serious kidney trouble, but help
the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor!
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street, Erskineville,
Sydney, says: “As the result of an attack of influenza a
member of my family suffered terribly from kidney
trouble. The symptoms were various, the most trouble-
some being pains across the small of the back. This
ailment was very trying, especially so as every move-
ment seemed to make the suffering more acute. No
position was comfortable, the ache keeping up practically
night and day. One day we were advised to try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved a blessing, six
bottles driving the pain out of the back and restoring the
kidneys to a healthv state. Doan’s Pills are a marvel-
lous kidney remedy, and I am sure sufferers from back-
ache cannot do better than take them. I consider they are
a boon to humanity, and I am never without a bottle in
the house.”
Two years later Mr, Francis says : “The cure referred
to still holds good, no signs of kidney trouble having
returned, a fact that Droves Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills give lasting benefit.”

AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. W. P. Ritzau, 364 King Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says: “For years I was a great sufferer from
kidney disease. I have been treated by doctors and in
hospitals, and tortured with operations. After fifteen
months in one hospital I came out a thorough cripple;
I was so ill I was advised to go back into the hospital,
but my husband would not let me go. I was recommended
by a friend to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
commenced using them, carefully following the directions.
These pills have cured me. I can now get about and
do my work, and the pain has completely left me. My
cure is wonderful, for mine was really a very bad case.
Since my cure my uncle has used the remedy and they
have effected a complete cure in li'is case also. Our
experiences prove that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a positive cure for kidney trouble.’’
Eight years later Mrs. Ritzau says: “I have still
the same good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
When I feel a- slight return of my old complaint I take
them, and they never fail to put me right.”

“The question now,” said Henry, thought-
fully lighting one of his frightful Manila
cheroots, “is who’s going to have the publish-
ing of it. How many copies d’you think
we’ll want?”
“Well,” I said, “there’s me and Helen, and
I suppose your aunt will want”
Henry frowned.
“Would, say, two thousand hold it for a
start?”
“They probably would,” I said.
“It is rather important to put it into
the hands of the right firm,” said Henry.
“What about Wangle and Cobblestone?”
“One could but give them a fly,” I sug-
gested.
And it was in this wise that Henry’s
negotiations with the publishing trade com-
menced.
One of the things that I admire in Henry
is his sanguine outlook, but that in this
matter he was a little over-assured struck
me from the start. His first approach to
Messrs. Wangle and Cobblestone was per
medium of the post, and it says something,
I think, for the firm’s office organisation that
whereas the manuscript left Henry on the
Monday evening it was with him again by
the first delivery on Wednesday. Then
Henry called. He viewed the matter differ-
ently. It was obvious, he pointed out to me,
that he was the temporary victim of some
clerical error. I never learnt the exact de-
tails of liis interview —it was tfie first of his
setbacks and a subject upon which lie never
became anything but reticent —but from
what I gathered the manner of the man was
discouraging, i'liere was no demand, he said,
for such matter as Henry had troubled him-
self to submit. When there was he would
let Henry know, but he could not honestly
say he anticipated occasion for further
correspondence.
The number of local publishing firms is
somewhat limited, and there is no doubt that
the attitude of Wangle and Cobblestone had
dashed Henry not a little. It demoralised
him, I think, and with every subsequent
repulse his manner of approach smacked a
little more of the arrogant. Driven eventu-
ally to trying the smaller and less reputable
firms, his air—l accompanied him on one or
two occasions—became positively offensive.
When a man in a small upstairs room in
George-street North reminded him that he
had already conveyed a negative in the most
convincing manner of which he was verbally
capable on five occasions, and that on the
sixth he would certainly flina Henry and
his manuscript into the lift-well, Henry at
last realised that his prospects of publica-
tion were remote indeed.
Again for close on a month Henry floated
nowhere near us. Then a ring on the tele-
phone and an urgent request that I should
endeavor to accompany him the following
morning to an address in Castlereagh-street
told me that the embers of his hopes still
glowed. He was quite a small man, the man
in Castlereagh-street, said Henry, but he had
given a very reasonable quote. His aunt
(Henry’s aunt), added Henry, was abso-
lutely wedded to the idea of his book being
published and had promised to finance _ its
printing—at any rate of the first edition.
Bottleshaw was the man’s name. A per-
fectly ridiculous name, of course, but it
would only appear on the book in small type,
and....
And then the line got crossed, and I rang
off.
Henry was plainly excited. We made our
way along Castlereagh-qtreet at a quite
feverish pace and arrived at our destination
moist and breathless. It was patent that
no particular cachet would be conferred by
Mr. Bottleshaw’s imprint—his business pre-
mises were modest, even mean. Of the two-
storeyed building in which they were situated
Mr. Bottleshaw occupied portion of the
ground floor. Above Mr. Bottleshaw were
a milliner and a herbalist, and ornamenting
the facade, I remember, were two vases of
plaster grapes.
We had obviously chosen a slack moment
for our call, for tiie figure to be discerned
consuming cherries in the doorway proved
to be none other than Mr. Bottleshaw him-
self. A large and florid man, Mr. Bottle-
shaw—an affable and unaffected sort of man,
judging from his manner toward the girl
arranging the contents of a neighboring den-
tal showcase and his mode of discarding
the unedible portion of the fruit mentioned.
He escorted us courteously inside.
“Concerning ‘Cloud-wrack and Leaf-mould,’”
said Mr. Bottleshaw, “it was no use saying
one thing and meaning another —his line was
jobbing. lie had no doubt, on the other hand,
that lie would be able to turn it out in a
style satisfactory to all parties. Man and
boy, he supposed he had. .. .Not but what
....Though, mind y0u”....
I coughed and wound up my watch.
"Of course,” said Henry, “the price is
very reasonable, but I wouldn’t like you to
take it on unless you felt quite certain”
Let Henry leave it to him, said Mr. Bottle-
shaw —just leave it, that was all Henry had
to do.
First of all, however, Henry discussed a
few ideas he had as to make-up. He didn’t
know, he said, whether Mr. Bottleshaw had
noticed the tendency in some of the higher-
class publications to ornamental initials and
a rather prodigal use of space. Personally,
the style rather appealed to him. And what
about a frontispiece? How about a por-
trait?
Just his name on the bottom of the cover
would satisfy him, said Mr. Bottleshaw.
“Of me, i mean, of course,” said Henry
gently.
“Well,” said Mr. Bottleshaw critically,
“that is a matter for you to decide, but
speaking for myself, and it is no use saying
one thing and”——
“Just as you like,” said Henry, slightly
pettish. “Now, how long do you reckon it’ll
take?”
And there, Mr. Bottleshaw had to confess,
Henry had him. We could see for ourselves
how things were —he waved a hand in gen-
eral indication of an apartment beyond
wherein, so far as I could see, a scorbutic
lad toasting a teacake over a gas-ring pro-
vided the only movement. He couldn’t pro-
mise it under two months.
And it was exactly two months later that
the first edition of “Cloud-wrack and Leaf-
mould” arrived at Henry’s per medium of a
handcart and the scorbutic lad aforesaid.
“It’s a pity about the title,” said Helen
examining the autographed copies that Henry
had hurried across with. _
“I blame myself, really, said Henry, for
not insisting on seeing a proof, though any
idiot could have seen that ‘Clod-wreck and
Leaf-moult’ is wrong. Still, there it is. The
next move is to get it into the hands of the
booksellers.”
Which, I can see now, was where Henry
made a grave mistake.
It would have been better if, instead of
distributing the edition on a sale-or-return
basis among the booksellers, he had allowed
his aunt to do as she suggested and work up
a demand for it in those circles to which
her status in certain social-welfare move-
ments gave her an entree. The stoutest of
books could not have stood for long the con-
tinual fingering which Henry’s received from
a curious but parsimonious public. Copies
were sold, of course —five were disposed of
in the first fortnight; but of the mental
balance of the purchaser of one of these
the salesman confessed he had been doubt-
ful at the time of the transaction, and re-
presentations by the unfortunate man’s rela-
tives subsequently resulted in the sale being
cancelled, while of the other four copies it
ultimately transpired that three must have
been inadvertently knocked off the stall and
removed with the day’s garbage. Sometimes
Henry would mix with potential purchasers
himself, but the rough way in which his work
would be picked up and discarded, and the
disparaging comment to which it was sub-
jected so incensed him that after an inter-
view, in which the bookseller expressed him-
self as nauseated by the very sight of the
line and only too glad if Henry would re-
move the books once and for all to any-
where he obscenely well pleased, Henry
tired of this, falling eventually into a state
so low and morose as to leave me seriously
disturbed.
A month went by—two. A railway book-
stall confessed to the reduction of its stock
by two copies, presumably sold. Six months
crept slowly past. Henry consigned a butter-
box containing a complimentary 120 to a
rural school of arts.
And a year wambled by.
Henry continued to float in as usual, but
by tacit consent we ceased to make mention
of his literary work. It was probably about
this time that he re-collected the now much
soiled volumes from the booksellers, for sub-
sequent evidence proved my assumptions con-
cerning their disappearance to have been
erroneous, and the almost complete edition of
Henry’s soil poems to be still extant.
There is a certain pathos about the circum-
stances in which I was destined to come
across them again. It must have been fully
three years after our visit to Mr. Bottleshaw
that an extravagant use of the bell while
Helen was at the butcher’s summoned me to
the front door.
He would like, said the man on the step,
to introduce to my notice a line of tea, the.
like of which it was rarely his privilege to
handle—Piffle’s Pink Label, guaranteed dust-
less, a shilling the certified half-pound.
It was thoughtful of him, I said, but quite
futile.
To popularise the line referred to, pur-
sued the man, warming to his theme, Piffle’s
had purchased at enormous cost a complete
edition of the work of one of our foremost
humorous writers, and with each Packet or
the tea would be presented a copy of the book
"’"His not too teach to say,’/ declared Riffle's
representative, splashing his words a
now quite fiercely and simultaneously broach-
ing a receptacle like•a large leathei sa\ ~
"that in presenting without extra charge te
work of so eminent a writer as Hemy
K 'l ttl s e tarted. “Settle,” I corrected sharply.
“Any idiot can see the word s Settle. I
the volume displayed was indeed a copy ot
Henry’s prose poems of the soil, and at file
sight a sudden feeling of mingled indignation
and tenderness consumed me.
It was perhaps foolish of me to purchase
so much of an article for which, except at.
such times as we entertain, we have found
so little use. but it hurt me to see the fruits
of Henry’s brain hawked from door to dooi
by a man so disagreeably glib and palpably
unwashed. I took his entire stock of l ime s
tea and received as bonus the four copies ot
the book left over.
For in such manner as is fitting I

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I HAVE passed the whole day with my
brother, the'Sun,
And my sister, the Sea;
Seen the pageant of hours
Clad in raiment of orange, and azure, and
emerald spun
By their magic, like flowers
In Time’s blos’my garden ablow;
Or like glittering gems on his fingers aglow
And aglearn, sparkling, radiant, each one
With its own lustrous beauty aflame, dazz-
lingly,
In the light of the sun.
I have lain in the soft, circling arms of the
Sea,
And felt on my face
The blown petals of spray
From the snowy foam-blossoms she wears
at her breast, under me.
Cool as mornings in May,
Close-linked, the smooth strength of her
hands. .
I have heard her sweet whispering words to
the sands
Murmured low to the wind’s melody.
Alluring, enchanting, all beauty, all grace,
Is my sister, the Sea.
I shall weave of my thoughts of the sea
and the sun,-
Of this wonderful day,
The warm gold of the sands,
The silvery drops of the feathery foam as
they run
O’er the cup of my hands,
A raiment of brightness, a rare
Robe of beauty and splendor my spirit shall
wear
Evermore. - As a prize dearly won,
The caress of the sea I shall treasure alway,
And the kiss of the sun.

■—it never varies.
Producing an illuminating oil as good as “Light
of the Age” Kerosene is no hit-or-miss proposition.
“Light of the Age” never varies in any single detail
of quality: it is always exactly the same: uniform in
goodness.
Its origin is the finest grade of crude oil, produced
in the great oil-fields of North America.
it is cleansed of all impurities by the most modern
refining processes. It comes to you so clean that it
is almost odorless. It burns with clear, unflickering
light right down to the last teaspoonful in the lamp.
“Light of the Age” gives a steady, restful
illumination, free from glare. Its flame is sootless.
Above all, “Light of the Age” is safe. • Absolute
purity makes it so.
