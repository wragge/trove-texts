Victor Daley
Christmas Eve of 1800 was tho most
mournful of my life. I had seen twenty-one
years and three months of this world, anc
1 felt older than I do to-day. I had throwi
in my job, lost a true-love and spent al
the money I had. -And one does not quite
realise in youth that there will always bo
other jobs, other girls and currency of some
kind.
I was sitting in a very humble office ii
the old Temperance Hall in Pitt-street, Syd-
ney, when a pal about my own age canu
in with a Christinas gift, consisting of
bottle of squareface and a copy of “The
Golden Shanty”—one of the earliest Bulle
tin publications. The squareface was com
forting, but something in “The Golden
Shanty” did me more good. It was Yictoi
Daley’s “Sunset Phantasy,” which I ther
read for the first time. I sensed allied ari
and feeling in all its beautiful lines, am
thereafter I have always bracketed Victor
Daley with John Keats. Daley may noi
be as great as Keats, but he has much of
Keats’s quality. I am not saying that finish
is everything. We can have beauty without
completion—as, for instance, in Coleridge
the most “unfinished” poet in English (I am
using the word “finish” here in a somewhat
altered sense). Coleridge is a poet of beau-
tiful fragments—Daley a poet of fine com-
pletion. The post-mortem school regard this
in Coleridge as a defect, and ascribe it to
dope. I may be wrong, but I ascribe it to
—Coleridge. To some characters there is a
certain charm about unfinished enterprises.
Life, when one comes to regard it in
the cold white light of experience, is an un-
finished enterprise. Coleridge probably over-
appreciated the fact. Daley, on the other
hand, found joy in completion, and strove
for it sometimes under difficult con-
ditions. Long after I had read the “Sun-
set Phantasy” I saw him add the last lines
to a fine set of verses standing up to Tiie
Bulletin counter. lie told me that he had
a guest at his house in Paddington who
would not be denied —under the exact sum
owing. The price of the poem just made up
the balance due.
When Daley came to Sydney in the later
’nineties he left a note at the Sunday
Times office saying he would like to meet
me. The precious scrap of paper is before
me here. He was living, as he tells me, with
Tom Durkin, the artist, and one Tom Brown,
a theatrical agent, on a schooner called the
Vesta in Middle Harbor. I regret that I
never got aboard the Vesta. There was
always something hazy about that ship. As
near as I could gather, Henry Lawson went
down to Victor and his friends, and
somebody cut the schooner away from her
moorings—an envious critic probably. The
rollicking ship’s company disbanded shortly
after, and Daley came to live in town. I
met him first at Fred Broomfield’s place in
Paddington. That night William A. Hol-
man, then a fledgling Parliamentarian, dined
Victor, Fred, Bert Stevens, Lawson and my-
self at Paris House. He had met us all
together by chance in Hunter-street, and was
generously equal to the occasion. Later
Victor Daley and Bertram Stevens visited
me at Bossiey Park, where I had a little
ex-urban holding. Stevens, who subsequently
became Daley’s posthumous editor, was then
a law clerk in Sydney. I have always dis-
agreed with Stevens in his memoir of Victor
Daley which prefaces “Wine and Roses.”
Stevens lacked the creative capacity to un-
derstand Daley. However, Keats has no
Boswell; and Daley does not need one.
Afterwards Daley came to me on the
Clarence River, just as Lawson came to
Mallacoota. We dwelt under the same roof
for six months. About three years later he
died at Waitara. I acted as honorary organ-
iser for his benefit and memorial, and, with
the generous assistance of artists, theatricals,
writers and the Sydney public, we made it
a historical success. All the papers in con-
nection with the memorial .are here, and I
am having them bound into a volume.
Looking over my treasured Daleyana, and
thinking back about the poet, there is one
little episode which occurs to me to tell.
Christmas Eve, a year before Victor died,
Herbert Low and I were sitting together in
Power’s Hotel, our year’s money won and
a dividend declared. Low was a brilliant,
saturnine Jew, a - journalistic Autolycus
with a faculty for writing polished prose.
He had a good money-getting sense', but the
careless, open hand of a Celt. He hid his
real nature under the scoffer’s mask; he hid
it even from thbse he liked and admired.
He was one of a brilliant family who have
honorably contributed to modern English
literature, and liis untimely death in I!)10
robbed me of an associate for whom I cher-
ished a great secret regard. Neither of us
was much given to open demonstration, but
my last letter from Herbert Low, on tho
eve of his departure for the Unknown, is full
of gentle friendship and a courage in the
very face of death equal to the courage of
the battlefield.
It seems that after Low and I parted for
*the holidays on this remembered occasion he
suddenly thought of Daley, who was in
neither good health nor good circumstances.
Idea and action ran in double-harness with
Herbert Low. He hailed a passing cab and
drove rapidly from one shop to another.
With a well-filled pocket-book and a fiercely
generous impulse, the matter was easy.
Daley told me the sequel. “I was sitting,”
said he, “in a downstairs room thinking
that I was going to enjoy the most mourn-
ful holiday of a lifetime, when I heard a
rumbling of wheels without. The vehicle
stopped at the door, which I opened in re-
sponse to a violent knocking. I was met
by Low. with the frightened face of a cab-
driver peering over his shoulder. Both were
loadcd with packages, bundles, boxes, parcels
—gifts of all shapes and sizes ; and a glance
at the argosy in port showed me that it
carried a full cargo. He had loaded it to
the upper deck. Before I could fully grasp
the situation Low pushed a fully undressed
turkey into my arms. Before I had thor-
oughly recovered from the assault the hall
was converted into a barricade, from which
an angry-looking Hebraic Santa Claus kept
sweeping me with the grape-shot of his good-
will. Before I even began to express any of
the emotions natural to a man under the cir-
cumstances, the door was violently slammed,
and the last I saw of my Maecenas he was
urging the terrified cabman to greater speed
as the emptied conveyance rounded the
corner,”
Only once did I dare to introduce my know-
ledge of the episode to Herbert Low—with
the result that he cursefully cast reflections
upon me and my race which, if I had not
known the man so well, would probably have
led to bloodshed. But I have often supersti-
tiously thought that the blessing I almost
unconsciously laid upon Victor Daley for the
comfort his “Sunset Phantasy” brought me
on a sad Christmas Eve over a decade pre-
viously had, somehow or other, in the
cobweb course of life’s highway, come to a
poetic realisation.
E. J. BRADY.
Criticism and Narcissus
lii “Criticism and the Feminine” (R.P.
19/3/’25), T. Jasper is guilty of grave in-
justice to woman. “In the correlated and
impersonal attributes of justice, humor and
capacity for criticism,” lie holds, “woman,
as compared with man, is lacking.” To those
who do not possess in some small degree the
faculty of detached, impersonal analysis, it
must be abundantly clear that these limita-
tions are not peculiarly feminine. They are
merely human. The qualities of humor and
justice, the power of vision to “see men as
trees walking,” are rare products of intel-
lect and are not essentially sex attributes.
Mr. Jasper refers to "the psycho-analysis
craze,” but it is just a little late in the day
to dismiss psycho-analysis with a contemptu-
ous gesture. A little honest introspection
will convince anyone that this study
has placed a peculiarly suitable label on the
very trouble of which Mr. Jasper complains.
Every human being has a Narcissus complex.
No man is exempt. At some time or other
each of him has mentally registered the same
satisfactory opinion of himself as did Little
Jack Horner. “Bitter constraint and sad
occasion drear” compel us all to re-adjust
our ideas. Perhaps it is true that woman,
whose experience of life is usually more
limited than man’s, makes her adjustments
less readily, and it is maladjustment which
causes trouble—in psychological language,
the failure to sublimate to normally useful
channels the energy inhering in the Narcis-
sus complex. Partial failure makes the par-
tial critic.
Mr. Jasper girds at woman’s “intensely
personal attitude to life.” Man's attitude
to life is also personal. How, indeed, can
one imagine progress except from the per-
sonal to the impersonal? Can any man in-
terpret life except in terms of his own
experience? We project our own personality
into the people and things about us. Lan-
guage teems with proofs of this. How would
t fare with the poet were it otherwise? He
t is who possesses this faculty raised to the
nth power. Many poets have testified to
this. Says Keats: “A poet. ...has no iden-
tity. .. .he is continually in some other body
... .If a sparrow come before my window, I
take part iii its existence and pick about the
gravel.” Byron asks: “Are not the moun-
tains, waves and skies a part of me and of
my soul, as I of them?” It is by virtue of
this power and our common share in it that
the poet is able to convey something of the
“soul-stuff” of poetry to our duller minds.
We seek, in art a realisation of ourselves.
Man is driven by a resistless urge to see
homogeneity in himself and his universe.
The children begotten of this desire are
Religion, Art, Science. And is it not extra-
ordinary that Mr. Jasper should hurl it as
a reproach against woman that she extols
a “craze” which “seeks to interpretate life
almost wholly in terms of sex”? We all
seek to interpret life in terms of ourselves.
Is there any man who does not recognise the
paramount importance of sex to himself —
and to his world? If so his “better half” is,
I fear, complemented by a wowser half.
I hold no brief for the popular novel. It
reminds me of a potion much revered by
certain Eastern Jews. The concoction is
made by writing certain words on a tablet
and then washing them off with w r ine to
which has been added part of a citron, used
at a tabernacle festival. The popular novelist
usually finds, the source of his inspiration
written elsewhere —and he dilutes it Well
with inferior, spicy wine. Women may gulp
the draught more greedily than men ; but, if
so, it is because of their inferior educational
and experience opportunities. And in the
last analysis this is not greatly to man’s
credit.
Finally, there is little justification fqr Mr.
Jasper’s belief that only a fanatic can make
a worthy mother. The job of being a mother
is too long, steady and inconspicuous to suit
a fanatic. Nor is it the doubtful “wisdom
of emotional excesses” which a mother
learns! It is rather a wisdom which was
vouchsafed to the sages after prayer and
fasting, but which seems to be instinctive in
even the humblest mother —a racial inheri-
tance, perhaps. In this one avenue wherein
she has specialised woman has learned that
only in service is true freedom found—or,
as Mr. Jasper himself expresses it. in a
wider application, “a man must lose himself
to find himself.”

Joy and Art
Jack Lindsay (R.P. 19/3/’25) writes a
sentence which suggests that nonsense prose
may tickle the palate no less agreeably than
nonsense verse. It concludes: “....For
there are no problems to the man who real-
ises that joy in life is the only reason,
excuse or vindication for art. There are
no problems, there is only life.” Whether
the last phrase is intended to mean any-
thing at all only Heaven and Mr. Lindsay
(an- odd bracketing, partly suggested by
Carroll’s “cabbages and kings”) may know.
Not being in the confidence of either I can
only admire the delicate flavor of non sequi-
tur; as though one were to say there are no

When is
a battery cheap?
The price is only one—and the least one—of three
things that tell whether a battery is a good bargain.
More important considerations are : How long will it
last and how few will be the repairs ? One repair job
may change the lowest-priced battery into the most
costly.
The true way to put a value on your battery is
to take the first cost, add the repair bills, and consider
the length of time the battery lasts. Do this and you
will find that an Exide Battery costs you less than any
other per month and per year of service.
Now, even the first cost of an Exide is low—
with the quality as high as ever.

problems in geometry, there is only geometry.
Or one might apply Mr. Lindsay s own logic
to himself and point out that there is no joy
in life, there is only life. It is possible, o.
course, that the phrase is an epigiani aiK
should be passed in decent silence.
But. no such excuse can be ottered tor tne
sentence as a whole. It contains two state-
ments —that joy in life is the only reason
for art, and' that, to the artist who sees
that truth, there are no problems in lire.
The first need not detain us: it has been a
commonplace among the younger undergradu-
ates as far back as history runs, and, being
in all probability rather physical than men-
tal in origin, is scarcely matter for argu-
ment. But the view that seeing the joy
means not seeing the problems, or that an
artist cun treat the one without the other,
seems to deserve direct contradiction.
Cows, possibly, see no problems, but only
life; but the cow has never been the symbol
of joy. By men life is seen clear of pro-
blems only through dulness of vision or rank
inexperience. Seeing problems is the con-
dition of seeing anything at all; and the
man who exalts joy in life without seeing
the mass of problems inseparable from Ins
ideal can never have aimed at any joy more
complex than plum-cake. Though even that
has its problem—the problem of how to eat
and have it too. And this very problem —
whether in so many words, or dressed up
by one as “love’s sad satiety,” or by another
as the “infinite longing and the pain of
finite hearts” or in any one of a million other
ways—is at the centre of all this world s
joy. The art that ignores it is mere pretence,
and bears with it its own punishment, since
this very problem of finitude, more than any
other single element, makes the appeal of
art. Without it joy is insusceptible of artis-
tic treatment, since nothing becomes boring
sooner than to witness the mere unshadowed
joy of others. So it comes that the art that
sees only the joy and misses the problems
is of no more value than a burst of drunken
laughter, or (if it be of a less boisterous
sort) the vacant smile of idiocy.
F. J. S.
Our Friend Stefansson
Canadian literature which has drifted my
way suggests that our late visitor Stefans-
son is a many-sided man. I would call him
nothing less than a hexagon, and he may
even be an irregular crystal. The latest
addition to my collection is an article cut
from a Toronto paper. It deals with the
wanderer’s explorations in the deserts ot
Australia, he having gone there to disperse
the illusion that they really are deserts. A
misty impression is left that he succeeded,
and that the Australian desert is now cleared
up in some way like the sources of the Nile.
It is added that Stefansson hopes to go to
the African Sahara, and put it likewise in
a new light which nobody has heard of
before. Another paragraph in another paper
deals with the expedition which the explorer
led, or was on the verge of leading, to res-
cue the Governor of Victoria, lost in the
treacherous wilds of the overland telegraph
line near Horseshoe Bend.
Perhaps we got a wrong idea about our
Arctic pilgrim when he pervaded these pai'ts
in all his glory. Common impressions were:
That he was the first man to demonstrate
that white men could live permanently inside
the Arctic Circle. (The largest permanent
town in the Arctic is probably Hammerfest,
in Norway; population 3500: date of origin
obscure, through age.)
That, caravaning through the frozen wilds,
he came on Eskimo tribes who had never
previously seen a white man—not even an
explorer. , . _
That he discovered the Polar regions to be
no silent waste, but to teem with animal
life, especially caribou and musk oxen, and
to be a prospective meat-exporting country.
A Sydney daily had an article on this future
source of food supply and fount of chops and
steak. ...
That he demonstrated how the proper kind
of Polar explorer need not hump provisions
along, but can graze at large on the riches
of the land.
One of the earliest comments on the fetet-
ausson theory which I have seen was pub-
lished in the Montreal Gazette of 14/1/ 2_
after the distinguished gentleman had wound
np his last Polar affair.
During the whole course of the expedition Mr. Stef-
ansson pursued a policy of wild extravagance. He
has stated that the expedition was planned to demon-
strate the principle of living by forage. How does
lie reconcile this with his efforts from the first to
have the Canadian Arctic expedition, 1913-1918, the
best-equipped expedition that ever sailed ? The ships,
the Karluk for the northern party and the Alaska for
the southern party, were equipped as fully as possible
from the very first. When more men were added
more provisions were bought, and an additional ves-
sel, the Mary Sachs, was bought at Nome to carry
supplies in 1913. A considerable amount of freight
was shipped to Herschel Island on the whaler Belve-
dere in 1913. Later, in 1914, the schooner North
Star, with all the supplies of its trader-owner, was
bought, and another trader named Duffv O’Connor
was bought out. In 1915 Stefansson bought the large
schooner Polar Bear, loaded with supplies, as well
as a smaller schooner, the Gladiator, in the same
way, at Arctic Ocean prices. The El Sucno was
also chartered to carry supplies. Large amounts
were purchased from the Hudson Bay Company and
other traders at Herschel Island. A large Bill was
purchased from the trading ship Herman in 1916, and
in 1917 the Challenge was bought, and Hudson’s
Bay Company stores, and the independent traders’
stores were bought in many cases. Practical results
of 1917-18 were virtually limited to Stookerson’s ice
trip north of the coast of Alaska. Bills ran to over
half a million dollars.
This exploration Oe luxe was certainly a case
of the explorer “living off the country,” but
any stay-at-home pensioner or Tite Barnacle
could have done it in the same sense.
In 1922 there appeared a pamphlet “by D.
Jenness. Victorian Memorial , Museum,
Ottawa.” in which the writer not only com-
mented on the heroic finance of the explorer,
but alluded to another matter: —
There is another side to this question of living off
the countrv... .It involves the destruction of entire
herds of caribou and musk oxen—males, females and
young. On .Melville Island, one of the largest islands
in the North, where musk oxen are still found, Mr.
Stefansson and his companions killed, on their own
estimate, about one-tenth of the total number of musk
oxen (400 out of dm estimated 4000) .... The musk
oxen have already been almost exterminated on the
mainland of Anierica and in Greenland. On Vic-
toria and Banks Islands they were destroyed by the
Eskimos prior to 1913, and the onlv places where
they remain in any numbers are Ellesmere Island
and a few sr, Mler islands ad.ip cent to it. The cari-
bou, too, have seriously diminished in numbers.
Their extinction round Coronation Gulf J
within sight now, although in 1913 they
counted there by thousands.
The vague impression which came to usicu -
ing Stefansson’s stay here, that he was in
some wav the original discoverei of the 11
numerable caribou and other food supplies
and prospective food exports in the Arct ‘ c ’
fades in the light of these remarks It seems
both tame hunting and tame
pursue the cow, whether plain, musk 01

the gentleman who polled this simple coun-

had an inspiration to add to the British Em-
pire Wrangel Island, 100 miles north, of
Siberia. The alleged idea was that it might
serve a great purpose in connection with an
air service, or a bear service, or something.
Wrangel Island is a very considerable mass
of frost-bitten rocks rising to
of 2300 ft. Under the auspices of the Stc

The New Aphrodite
That a book like Michael Aden's “The
Green Hat" should have gone through eijit
editions in three months is a rather notable
circumstance, but the reviews in the pub-
lish papers are the really interesting thing
about it Even that guardian of morals the
Times, is not shocked; it dismisses Arlen .
book, without serious disaproval, as a new
kind of literary cocktail. The Sunday
Chronicle calls it the i novel of 1 1 ast /
another very respectable journal, the Daily
Graphic, bestows on it the epithet lovable.
And it is only about 30 years since Ibsen
could get no hearing in London, except from a
few people considered freakish and dangerous.
Thirty years ago the woman who preferred
freedom and her own life to companionship
with any sort of morally and physically
diseased husband was not to be spoken about
in decent society. Now comes Arlen with his
detailed, clever and sympathetic study ol
the woman whom you have got to admire
though her weakness for men (if weakness is
the word) is precisely that of the average
man of the town for chorus girls.
This is surely the farthest north—oi south
—that the modern successful novel has got
vet. When I say successful, I am not think-
ing of that atrocious, common enough thing,
the success of scandal. Arlen is m a class
above that. He is young, but he is someone
to be reckoned with. He may play to tin
gallery, but he has something to say. Anil
his way of saying it is not merely clever
or smart; it is always vivid and occasionally
brilliant. This puts him right out of the
class of those indecent-mmded purveyors of
fiction who are the carrion crows of litera-
ture. It may be said that the idea of com
mending to our admiration a woman like ins
Storm is no new thing-that the younger
Dumas did it long ago in his Lady.of the
Camellias. But there is a world of difference
between the proudly-independent, menta y-
o-ifted Iris of the English-Armeman novelist
and the plaster-and-wax Camille.
Perhaps, or probably, Arlen is out to sell
first and to preach a moral afterwards. But
any sort of novelist, to be worth anything,
must have a point of view. No doubt then
are people, millions of them, who only want
to be told a story, as children want to be
told. But those people do not make public
opinion, they merely run after it. Arlen s
view is unquestionably that a woman
may have distinction and charm, both men-
tal' and physical, and preserve both, anil
attach to her men of rare sensibility, though
she has had numerous episodical • affairs,
and though, in her own words to one whom
she has kissed in passing, “I have lit many
small fires to quench one large fare.
That is the sin our fathers and grand-
fathers and all the remote, vanished host of
great-great-grandfathers could not and
would not forgive. Even the suggestion of
forgiveness for such an offence —let alone a
series of offences —would have caused an
explosion. Are w-e wiser than our fathers?
It is hard to say. We are at least more
tolerant. Also we are —or some of us are
l ess bat-eyed in our view of differential
standards as between man and woman.
\rlen. writing in 1924, does not pretend
that all the men of to-day. any more than all
the women, are prepared to accept Iris.
There is Hilary, for example, the typical
man about town : “Hilary couldn’t obviously
forgive Iris for not having grown common
and meretricious and. in the slim, beastly
sense, coarse....He couldn’t, obviously, for-
give her for the continued graciousness of her
outward seeming, and of her inner seeming,
too. if one didn’t know those things about
her." , . „ .
There it is—the knowing of certain things
about her! She was' gracious in inner and
outward seeming in spite of them. A Riche-
lieu. a Byron could be gracious and hero-
worshipped not only in spite of them, but
partly because of them. Iris was a woman,
and Hilary could not forgive her. Nor will
other Hilarys of both sexes forgive her.
But there, at any rate, she stands —a new
type in fiction, new not because of the sm
or frailty or whatever it is that takes love as
an anodyne, in lieu of bridge or prayers,
but because she is, above everything else,
distinctive and refined. Infinitely more refined
than Grundyism knows, or can know. So
Arlen would have you believe. If you think
a woman who scandalises, nags, backbites,
idles, over-eats and over-dresses is more re-
fined and purer in heart —or in body than
the one who lights “fleeting nres,” but does
none of the other things, and ends by dying
for her deepest love, you will not care much
about Arlen’s book. But it is an interesting
book, if only as an indication of how post-
war thought is trending.
A. J. B.
Ruritania
Where is Ruritania, that delightful king-
dom whose soul is romance, with its castles,
its intrigues, its gallant prince resplendent
in gold-and-white uniform shining with rows
of orders and stars and crosses, its tearful,
beautiful princess, its grand old general, its
clinking of glasses, its loves, its hates, its
revolutions always ready to burst, always
seeming about to bud, yet seldom blooming.
Where is it? Not in Germany, or Austria,
or the Balkans; yet it is tinged witli all of
them. I’ou know it is some little country
in Central Europe, some vague place forever
seething with plots and mystery. And
through it all there runs a haunting strain ;
somehow its very hint of dark mystery and
love, its castles, its air of old romance, sug-
gest the “Blue Danube” waltz.
It was Anthony Hope who put it on the
map, although before “The Prisoner of
Zenda” was written Thackeray had vaguely
introduced it in liis “Rose and Ring,’ which
was a burlesque more than anything else.
And then, of course, there is Stevenson s
story of Prince Otto, in which we met
Princess Ottilie, Gottesacker, Conrad, the
Prince of Grunewald and all the other people
who went to make that memorable tale. But
Anthony Hope’s book really laid the founda-
tions of Ruritania, and since then a host of
imitators has followed, using the old ingre-
dients with varying success. You know how
it begins—how a young Englishman, while
travelling in Germany, or Austria, or the
Balkans, suddenly finds himself at dusk on an
evening in March. 19—, at the little station
of Z ; how he is instantly caught and
whirled into a vortex of conspiracy;
how a rose, a handkerchief, dropped
at his feet from a window, enmeshes
him in an inexplicable, affair with the Royal
crown! then the message from the peasant
who is a spy; the meeting in the dim cellar,
the clash of swords, the secret wedding ot
the Prince and Princess just as the —hut you
know how it goes on; you know exactly how
it will end, although you follow it breath-
lessly ; know exactly how the handsome
Prince with the ducky little moustache will
marry the lovely Princess, and so restore
the honor of the family. They are enchant-
ing. these tales of Ruritania. Even the
studious man who reads Einstein and Shaks-
peare and Spencer and Darwin cannot help
but share with the romantic flapper the
fascination which they hold. Who can be so
unresponsive as to fail to be thrilled by the
adventures of Rudolph Rassendyll and
Rupert of Hentzau? Who can be so superior
as to sniff at the scenes between the Princess
Flavia and her lover? I do not know
whether “The Prisoner of Zenda proved to
be a best-seller in its day, but Anthony Hope
evidently thought a sequel would not be
amiss, so he gave us “Rupert of Hentzau,
and there are many who consider it bettei
than its predecessor.
J. C. Snaith contributed Ins brick to
Ruritania. For “Mrs. Fritz” was, of course,
none other than the Princess boma ot
Illyria. Another glimpse into the entrancing
land was given us by Justus Miles Forman,
the novelist who went down wit li the .Lusi-
tania. It was called “The Garden ot Lies,
and told of the fortunes ot one Denis Malloij.
a wild Irishman from Montmartre. Lven
those two authors of novels which are so
hungrily devoured in the kitchen, Agnes and
the late Egerton Castle, succumbed to the
lure of the wonderful kingdom, and produced
“Young April,” a glamorous tale ot a young
English duke who went wild for a month
during a tour of Europe. A whimsical story
by Laurence Housman called John ot Jin-
galo” also comes to mind. But perhaps it
could be said that the mantle of Anthony
Hope fell upon the shoulders of George Barr
McCutcheon, whose popular and well-known
Graustark novels have much of the thrill and
romance of “The Prisoner of Zenda and its
stirring sequel. . .. „
But Ruritania is fading. The dim cellars
are closed, the conspirators arc dead, the
roses do not drop at the feet of the young
Englishman, the scented handkerchief waves
no more from the narrow window lii the
castle wall. The princes and princesses, the
flags, the spies, the clanking of swords, the
merry clink of glasses, the gleam of medals,
all are gone. The castle itself crumbles.
Rupert of Hentzau and Prince Otto and the
Princess Flavia have put away their crowns
and swords, and their romance and mystery:
in these days of sex novels and sentimental
tripe and psychology they are lonely figures.
ROY CHASE.
A Satchel of Books
Anthony Mundap (John Lane). Munday was one
of the most prolific and versatile writers in Eliza-
bethan days and this quarto is a reprint of the
original text in the British Museum. It deals with
the lives of Englishmen who “by secret escape leave
their own country to live in Rome under the
servile yoke of the Pope’s government” and seek
“the overthrow and ruin of their Princess and
country.” A quaint and amusing little book in
which the duplicity of Master Anthony peeps out
between the lines.
Half a Minute’s Silence, by Maurice Baring (Heine
mann). If output is an indication of genius, Major
Baring has a fair share of it. Certainly he
has a wide and varied experience to draw on. file
present collection of short stories is named irom
the first of the series, the title being based on a
custom in Russia for people when they are starting
on a journey to sit down and spend half a minute
in reflection. Not only the departing guests but
those who are remaining take part in this .little
ceremony. What is supposed to have been originally
a religious observance has hardened into a social
convention. The stories cover a wide range, Horn
varns to character sketches, from real happen
ings to legend, and are well worth reading.

THE OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
The objects and powers of the Company are
set forth in the Memorandum of Association, but
primarily this Company is being formed to take
over and work claims numbered 17, 19, 22, 28,
29, 34, 70, 72, 77, 81, 95, 96, 97, 101, 118, 121,
122, 125, 126, 127 and 128 in the Kawarau
River, Otago, New Zealand, marked on the survey
plan of the Kawarau Gold Mining Company
Limited.
The Kawarau Gold Mining Company, Limited,
generally known in New Zealand as the parent
company, has obtained a license from the New
Zealand Mines Department, issued by G. Cruik-
shanks, Esq., Warden at Queenstown, and sanc-
tioned by the Hon. G. J. Anderson, Minister of
Mines, to dam Lake Wakatipu. The claims now
under offer to this Company, form part of the
parent company’s gigantic undertaking, which
has for its purpose the shutting off of Lake
Wakatipu from the Kawarau River, to lay bare
the bed of the river, thus allowing the rich
deposits of gold to be worked. This has been
the dream of Otago miners since the early
days of mining in the South Island, when the
rise and fall of the Kawarau River meant gloom
or joy to residents near the beaches along its
banks. A couple of feet fall in the river would
have exposed miles and miles of golden ground,
and many fortunes were won while the waters
kept low. In their twenty-one quarter-mile
claims, this Company will control five and a
quarter miles of what is regarded by experienced
miners as the richest river in the world.
Official records show that gold to the value
of £19,500,000 has been won from the alluvial
diggings and river banks in this locality since
1887.
The parent company will not work any of
the claims, and its only source of revenue will
be a tribute of 20 per cent, of the gold won by
claim-holders, after wages are paid. There are
only 126 claims on the river, so that this Com-
pany will control practically one-sixth of the
entire river.
HALL-MARKED BY THE NEW
ZEALAND GOVERNMENT.
In granting the application and thus giving
the official start to what will be the biggest
alluvial mining scheme in the history of gold-
mining, Warden Cruikshanks said:—
“I see no reason why the application for this
dam should not be granted. It has been before
the Court for over one year. No application in
my experience has been so thoroughly investi-
gated. The Government evidently looks upon
this as a national undertaking, as the Mines
and Public Works Departments have gone into
it with the Balclutha bodies. I have paid great
attention to what the Government offcers have
done. They have arranged the conditions in the
agreement. It is now in my power to grant
the application. I will grant the application for
the dam, and wish the venture every success.”
THE ORIGIN OF THE COMPANY.
There are several small syndicates holding
claims at various points right along the gold-
bearing course of the Kawarau River. After the
successful flotation of Maoriland Kawarau Gold,
Limited (the whole of the required capital for
which was subscribed within 16 days), these
syndicates were approached and induced to pool
their holdings into an Amalgamated claim. It is,
therefore, THE LAST CHANCE INVESTORS
WILL HAVE OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS
WONDERFUL GOLD-PAVED RIVER.
Maoriland Kawarau Gold, Limited, floated re-
cently in Sydney, secured all the capital required
within 16 dqys, and numbers of applicants
were unable to obtain shares.
As the time approaches for the closing of the
dam, which is expected to be at the end of
June nest, excitement, will be running high, and
everyone will want to be in it. If expectations
are realised when the dam is completed, the value
of the claims will be enormous! Beyond calcu-
lation! And this Company has twenty-one of
them.
POSITION OF THE COMPANY’S
CLAIMS.
The Company’s claims are scattered right along
the Kawarau, in amongst all the other claims.
Their location may be seen on the map to be
inspected at the Company's offices.
A FASCINATING GAMBLE FOR A
FORTUNE.
All you sportsmen who love a flutter get busy
now and have a bit on this, the biggest gamble
the world has ever known. Only a limited number
can get into this glorious scheme. Be one of
thpm. Even a few pounds may win a fortune.
THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES YOU
CAN APPLY FOR IS 50, WHICH REPRESENTS
£l2/10/- FULLY PAID, BUT ONLY £2/10/-
ON APPLICATION AND £2/10/- ON ALLOT-
MENT. Send for the prospectus, but CUT OUT
THE COUPON NOW and post it at once. It is
expected that the Company will be over-subscribed
within a few days.
Remember this—on latest advices the shares in
the parent company are at a premium of over
2600 per cent. —twenty-six times their original
value, and are practically unprocurable at that,
and yet the parent company cannot make a
shilling until the claim-holders are getting gold.
Fill in your application and send it along to-
day !

Open and close upon that still dark stream.
A certain brilliance seemed to slide and glide
Uncertainly about from side to side,
As if a flower searched for a lost sunbeam,
As if a sunbeam sought its own lost
And suddenly “The sun and life!” I cried.
When I think back upon it now I sigh.
Those streets, all the harsh edges gone ; the
Quiet; soft voices; peace where’er I trod;
And only light from sky to spreading sky.
This dream I dreamed surely is shared with
Still in the long still galleries of God.

ZORA CROSS.
April Fool.
Golden sunlight and laughing rainfall
Dancing over a hidden pool;
Echoing note of a bushbird s clear call—
“Fool! Fool! April fool!”
Pale pink petals of Autumn roses.
Scarlet wonder on bush and tree
Galling us out ere the winter closes
All too swiftly on you and me.
Oh, sweet wild words with your gay and
glancing . , . .
Laughter that scorns restraint and rule!
Youth, you say, is the time for dancing —
April Fool! April Fool!
Greybeard sits by the fire a-dozing.
Creeping age will the young blood com;
Who would stay in a four walls closing?
April Fool! Oh, you April Fool!

A Sunday Idyll.
Tis full moon to-night, and the sun
Has been set for an hour.
From five little chapels the hymns
Pour out on the dark.
A mouth-organ quavers a rag;
And slumbers e&ch flower.
The call of the mopoke is heard
Far off in a gum.
A cattle-dog howls at the moon.
The bust scent of musk
Steals out on the cool breath of night.
The curlews have come.
From each little chapel a voice
Now lifts itself high
With fervid instructions to God.
The indigo sky
Looks down on the little bush town
As motors flash by.
A lost little breeze stirs the leaves
And sighs, and is gone.
And nobody heeds it, nor knows
That the lost little breeze
Is the soul of Naririyery’s chief*
That wanders alone!

Ou the grey ground
There are fairy leaves lying,
Titty leaves, tawny leaves, narrowly shaped.
Sun petals rttund
Soft as feathers come flying,
Down from the network of branches escaped.
Shadow and gleam
In a glamorous dream
Impishly pattern the sweet summer nOon ;
And on the grey sand
Puck’s skimttting hand
Has written enchantment with fairy leaf

Swift has he flown;
And his hat wings bore hither
Sandalwood odors from golden Cathay,
Pungences blown
From where marigolds wither
On Indian altars where jungle folk pray.

He has tossed in a trice.
Steeping in magic all midsummer eves
And even high noon

And left all the tree stems with laughter

Wields her diamond sway,
Hot. and so silent; but night brings dim
joys
Lightfoot to tread
The silver sand spread
With little leaves, slender leaves, dainty as
toys.
When the last blue
Has left the starred ceiling,
When the last lovers have sighed themselves
home,
Gentle as dew
From the -wave margin stealing
Water fays glide in a glimmer of foam;
Incense they bear
To throw 7 here and there,
At the nod of his Elfship, who watches and
weaves
All through the night
Sly snares of delight
From the smell of the leaves, of the little
slim leaves.
Bitter and burning and salt with the sea,
Dry on the silver sand, green on the free.
Little leaves, -spare the wild memories in me:

MEGALOMANIA IN THE NORTH.
if you want to improve your property you don’t
improve it. You spend the money on the places on
each side.” —Maxim of the political building tradet
Tue small ghost of a week or two ago, at
which date Senator Pearce unfolded his
tale about the future province of North Aus-
tralia, has grown up in a night and developed
into quite a robust spectre. It may mean
something, and it may mean no more than
Joseph Cabruthers’s Million Farms, a
device which roared for a while like a card-
board lion in the Foreign-trade press and
from the platform outside Sydney G.P.0.,
and then died so completely that even its
inventor doesn’t remember it. It didn’t
settle even one kitchen garden, let alone a
million farms, but it possibly served its pur-
pose, whatever the purpose might be. The
sketch of a gigantic Northern Province has
taken shape and been published in larger
detail. It is not Pearce’s individual scheme
to postpone decision and action, and at the
sanm time to solidify his position with his
hard-hearted constituents in Westralia. The
Prime Minister has apparently gone into it
in the regrettable absence of his bearward,
the Treasurer. State politicians in Queens-
land and Westralia have been buttonholed
and notified, and their consent would seem
to depend on the amount which their States
can hope to get out of it at the Federal ex-
pense, which means largely at the expense
of their neighbors. They may gain by it, and
they lose nothing by playing with it. It is
all very spectral; but spectres, like Parkes’s
famous Kiama spook, have their uses. This
one should help the further indefinite post-
ponement of the pledged and promised rail-
way [rorn the South through the Common-
wealth s own neglected estate of the North-
ern Territory—the place which has no luck
because it. has no votes in either House to
bargain with. There will be no need to pose
as a direct breaker of faith, and say that
the land-grant given in consideration of the
building of the line will be kept and no line
built. In an indefinite sort of way the
B>outb-to-North undertaking looks like being
simply “merged in a larger plan,” and merg-
will probably be the same as drowning.
jJie project means that something will be
offered to Queensland, whose politicians de-
sire that the South-to-North line should be
transferred to their State, N. S. Wales get-
ting the tail-end of the work as the price of
its support. It also offers something to the
\V estralians, who have an impression that
the Commonwealth should develop the top-
end of their immense area, not for the com-
mon benefit but for their benefit in particu-
lar. In each case the something, if it event-
uates, should lead to something more. If
nothing eventuates save a dissolving view the
business may still be an advertisement, and
may make a show of toil and earnestness and
energy till after the elections.
* * #
The principal feature of Senator Pearce's
lengthy exposition of his plans is embodied
in two or three sentences:—
. It is always recognised that the greatest need
in encouraging settlement is means of communica-
uon. In the territory I have mentioned splendid
poits are to be found at Wyndham, Darwin and Nor-
manton. They are the natural deep-water outlets
tor the area. If we could have three railway sys-
tems running out, say, 150 miles from each of the
ports the northern portion of Australia would be
quickly settled People think the North is a great
desert but they would be surprised if they could
see the lands on the Barkly Tableland, the area
about Victoria Waters, and in what is known as the
Kimberley area.
On the face of things, therefore, it would
appear that the new method of developing
tlio Commonwealth’s long-neglected pro-
perty, amounting to more 'than one-sixtli of
Australia, is to build 150 miles of railway
in Queensland and another 150 miles in West-
ralia, and to close and abandon 49 miles of
the 199 which the Northern Territory already
possesses. It doesn’t look rational, but no-
thing very rational has been done up that
way since Alfred Deakin’s day. At the
present time the . Northern Province-that-
ls-to-be owns a railway which does mighty
little good because the inland terminus is
a stump in the wilderness, while the marine
end is a lonesome port on a tremendous
stretch of lonesome coast, from which com-
merce has been driven by the Navigation
Act and the A.W.U. bosses. Pearce pro-
poses to have three such unpromising frag-
ments, ending at three stumps instead of one.
The builders of the existing concern had no
delusions about the profitable nature of a
line so pathetically isolated at each end.
They intended building through to Austra-
lia s third largest city, but financial exigen-
cies compelled them to choose between mak-
ing a land-grant bargain with Private Enter-
prise, which could have been enforced, and
one with the Commonwealth, and in a luck-
less hour they chose the latter. The Pearce
scheme ostensibly aims at investing money
in isolated railway fragments as a fixed
policy and not as an unforeseen misfortune.
Put if the scraps become a reality it will
probably be found that the new ones in the
.States will develop and become parts of
definite systems, while the old one in the
Federal Possession remains indefinitely as it
is. The place has no votes to be considered,
and money spent on the common property is
regarded in local-minded quarters as some-
thing filched from State interests.
**- * *
The programme includes a wondrous vision
of cattle and meat; but the old railway has
a misfortunate meatworks at its shore end,
and one of the new ones will have a very
bankrupt meat-factory at its marine end
also. The vast distances by the only avail-
able route (which is the sea route) to any
civilised city allowed the control of local
industry to drift into the. hands of a very
obnoxious type of union Bolshevik, and in
consequence industry almost left off. The
South-to-North line would make an end of
this isolation, and reduce the distance from
weeks to days, but under Pearce’s pro-
gramme this ancient and disad-
vantage will remain unchanged. The adminis-
trative side of the scheme is large, but not
definite. The Northern Territory Develop-
mental Commission is to consist of “say”
three (perhaps someone will say a much
larger number later on) expert and highly-
paid Developers, “fully acquainted with land
settlement, irrigation and railway needs.”
As they and their staff are to be purely
“developmental,” all the existing authorities
will remain to look after other things. The
Developers are to be given “full executive
powers,” subject, of course, to the Ministerial
head and the Cabinet at Canberra. They
are “to control matters relating to land,
water and railways,” with the usual reser-
vations. They will no more be allowed to
make railways simply because such are
needed and would pay than the N.S.W.
Railway Commissioner is. The money for
any independent action will be lacking. They
will have such control over the running of
the lines as arbitration courts, strike com-
mittees and a scared Minister at Canberra
permit. And as ffor “matters relating to
land,” the most visible drawback is that, in
the Territory and in North Queensland, thev
won’t be allowed to sell an inch of public
land, and both in Queensland and the Terri-
tory the unused estate of “the Crown” has
been actually increasing under the unpopu-
lar leasehold system. By way of climax
the Deyelopers are to have “full borrowing
powers,” provided the Federal authority
approves of the loan and of the pur-
poses to which the loan is to be applied, and
by doing so puts its reliable guarantee at
the back of the loan. The Domain dosser
has full borrowing powers of the same sort.
* * * *
The whole business is an effort to repeat
a discredited blunder on an enlarged scale.
The logical process is to push settlement
from the south, building the transcontinental
railway from the .southern end, where white
labor is fairly plentiful and reliable, and
where every mile of completed line will be
available to bring up material for the next
mile. When the first transcontinental rail-
way has got through, then all manner of
developments may follow. The other way is
to hump material over immense distances by
sea, deposit it at isolated spots wftere labor
is scarce and dear, and try to make three
isolated patches of civilisation where one
patch has failed because of its isolation. Re-
garded as a vote-hunting device there may be
profit in it, but it is poor business in a
nation-constructing sense.
THE CRUSADING SPIRIT.
News from the world's chief source of mad-
ness deals largely nowadays with famine in
the provinces and bread riots in what was
the capital until the Government moved in-
land and more out of sight to the semi-
savagery of old Moscow. The “collapse of
the budget,” which 'probably never was a
budget, and the fitful disappearance of
Trotsky are sidelights on the picture. The
riots have so tar been put down with vigor
by. the standing army (strength officially
reported at 600,000) ; but that, however
gratifying, doesn't fully assure the position.
Bolshevism was advertised in the beginning
as a world-conquering force, and if it has
lost its power of expansion it can’t settle
down, as the Turks did, to be an army of
occupation living on conquered foreign races
of superior numbers and intelligence, but
short of military organisation. It has no
sufficient supply of such races. To take, so
early in its career, to a process of vegetation
in a land which was never really civilised
would be a confession of defeat, especially
after so much crusading and so much bound-
ing ambition. An impression prevails among
the little adjacent peoples, who smell Bol-
shevism at close quarters, that it will not be
long before a systematic attempt is made to
spring as many as possible of the mines
which have- been laid So assiduously in so
many cpuntries, from the Clydeside on the
west to Australia on the east. So the little
peoples maintain armies of remarkable size
considering their populations, and are care-
ful to see' that the equipment and training
are good, and that the white-ant of Bol-
shevism isn’t inside the tree. They are not
intended for foreign conquest, for even a
super-NAPOLEON would hardly set out on
a career_of European adventure with Latvia
(area 25,000 sq. miles) for a base and its
force of 25,000 men as an army. What the
little States look for is an internal explosion,
elaborately engineered and surreptitiously
manned ‘ from Moscow, a nocturnal coup
d 1 Mat, and the formation of a sham Soviet
republic, which will pretend to be an expres-
sion of the popular will. The attempt which
just missed success in Estonia a few months
ago is viewed in the light of a trial trip.
'** * *
Thus far the Communist movement has
scored one success, or at least it is a success
so far as the retention of power is concerned.
Tt had also one temporary success; but Hun-
gary was too small a theatre of operations,
axid was almost wholly ringed in by Allied
States, which objected to having a mad
drama staged in their midst. And it had, in
Italy, a partial success which ended in com-
plete fiasco. In each instance the need for
a reliable army under reliable leaders was
made evident. The Italian army was fairly
reliable, but those who directed it were not.
Still, because existed, the Communist up-
heaval, though great things were done in the
provinces, never captured the metropolis and
the whole machine of government. So the
country which produced so many heroes, in-
cluding Caesar and Garibaldi, had a chance
to dig out one more in Mussolini, and Com-
munism went into the discard. In Russia
the old army was mostly dead, and its suc-
cessor, the army of recruits, was mostly very
distant, and almost without real officers by
reason of the boundless incapacity of
Kerensky's republic. In the circumstances
Communism scored a walk-over. Hungary,
when the three months’ madness set in, had
no army at all. The defeated emperor had
wandered off the local map. The defeated
army, left without a commander, had wan-
dered home. The shadowy republic of
Karolyi, more sketchy even than that of
Kerensky, lacked the simple horse-sense
to make the formation of a reliable new
army, even if it numbered a mere 10,000
men, its first consideration. The destruc-
tion of republics being the only business at
which Bolshevism lias any luck. Karolyi’s
was there one night when people went
to bed, and not there when they rose in the
morning, and a self-appointed Government
of Jews ruled in its place.
* * * *
It was a wonderful time. A Red Army
was organised in red-hot haste, for the for-
mation of a great army is always the first
aim. of a Communist movement. Half a
million troops were called for; but, though
more scum than had ever been known to exist
came forward, the full number was never
reached. The army robbed greatly and obeyed
very little, but it might have been licked into
shape and made a formidable weapon it
time had permitted. To the Hungarian
‘ bourgeois’ who had any business of value
three things promptly happened. All his
portable property was confiscated. His busi-
ness was confiscated, but be was retained as
manager at the workman's minimum wage,
With one or two or more young Hebrews of
good Communist standing to rule over him.
And his house, bar one room or possibly two.
was made 51 dwelling-place for comrades
and comradesses, so that he and his family
were never short of company. Those who
h ere accused of wealth and anti-Communistic
feelings, and who had no special value in
the way of making.money for the Bolshevik
Government, were, arrested in a purposeless
way, or if -.they couldn’t be found
efforts were made to secure their wives and
children as hostages. Within a week the
train service, managed by bright young
Hebrews of good Communistic standing and
run by comrades in a comradely spirit, was
almost at a standstill, and the capital citv
began to run short of food, clothes and most
things except garbage. The mansions of the
rich were handed over as doss-houses for
the mmor faithful,” who sold ‘the contents
to buy food and avoid work. The one thing
which was an unqualified success was the
secret police system, evidently organised well
in advance of the revolution, and it was
reckoned so perfect as to make counter-

Communism hasn’t lost its crusading force
and it is advisable to get busy at levelling
down civilisation elsewhere than in Russia
because Communism suffers much by invidi-
ous comparisons. Which all leads up to the
point that there may be a very real and very
large danger in Australia (if the vaporings
of.those who run the local Communist con-
spiracy are to be believed there certainly is),
and that there would be a measure of safety
in the possession of a standing army of at
least oO,oo° men, and the best instrument of
its kmd that money and brains can provide.
A fear is invariably expressed, when a stand-
ing army is mentioned, that it may be em-
ployed to deal with “industrial troubles.”
and many a proposition has split on this
rock. It industrial troubles” include the
confiscation of industries by Commu-
nist cranks, then dealing with them is at
least half the purpose of a standing army,
and no one should hesitate to say so The
other half-purpose is to make the best, pos-
sible resistance to foreign invasion, whether
the invaders are bent on ordinary and more
or less gentlemanly annexation or are a
horde invited here in the Bolsli interest.
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACE.
OVEH 50 years ago, a little later than the
publication of Darwin’s “Origin of Species,”
Francis Gaeton, one of the most gifted
minds of Victorian days, coined the word
eugenics. A many-sided man, traveller,
scientist, psychologist, philosopher, he gave
much of his life to research into the part
played by heredity in the development of
mankind. The result was an opinion, ex-
pressed emphatically, that to improve the
breed by checking the birth-rate of the unfit
and promoting that of the fit was a question
of supreme importance to the race. To
systematic efforts in such direction he
attached this word “eugenics.” Thence on-
ward, though the rate of progression has
been slow, the fundamental idea has con-
tinued to make way.
1 he criminal class was the first to receive
attention from this new school of reform.
Criminality, it was contended, was not
wholly due to either “original sin” or en-
vironment. The children of criminals in-
herited a criminal tendency; they were
unstable, neurotic and emotional, possessing
no . inhibitory check upon their instinctive
desires. Since those early days of the
eugenic movement the treatment of the insane
ami criminal lias received legislative atten-
tion, but only in quite recent years has
thought been seriously directed to that large
class of defectives who, without being insane
or criminal, are a menace to the breed. This
class has been labelled “the feeble-minded.”
and as feeble-mindedness is often on the
border line of normality, attempts to deal
with the delicate balance have been sub-
jected to much criticism. One need not re-
gard seriously attacks of that Chestertonian
kind which questions the sanity of all men.
and points to instances where, great wits
have to madness been allied. There is a suf-
ficiently clear demarcation for practical pur-
poses. So freely is this admitted that in
England and the United States legislation
has for some years past been in operation
dealing with feeble-minded adults and chil-
dren. The English Mental Deficiency Act
came into operation in 1014. Tt was a com-
prehensive measure dealing with idiots, im-
beciles and the feeble-minded. The last-
named were defined to be “persons in whose
case there exists from birth, or from an
early age, mental defectiveness not amount-
ing to imbecility, yet so pronounced that
they require care, supervision and control,
for their own protection, or for the protec-
tion of others, or, in the cases of children,
that they by reason of such defectiveness
appear to be permanently incapable of receiv-
ing proper benefit from the instruction in
ordinary schools.”
In most Australian States the Government
concerns itself only with such classes of
mentally defective persons as are certified to
be idiots or insane. No legislative provision
has been made for the feeble-minded. That
action in this direction has been so long
delayed, the question being one of vital
social importance, suggests that “Politician"
does not spell “Statesman”; for this is a
matter which goes to the future welfare of
the whole body politic. The fibre of the
race, including its sanity, is as much our
concern as its color. It will not profit us
if. whilst securing a White Australia, we
allow the type of the white man to degener-
ate. for degeneracy follows the low mental
type. If we do not come abreast of the
great, white communities of the world by
cleaning our house of the defective and


morally diseased, the day will come when
we will harbor a large body to whom the
contemptuously descriptive term of "white
trash” will be applied. Professor Pigou, ot
Cambridge, thus characterises the class:
There are a number of persons who, not being
certified lunatics, are, in greater or lesser degree,
mentally defective. They have entered manned ana
blind of soul into the world, and they pass in
affliction through it. In their passage they are a
danger to their fellows ; they are often criminal ana
inebriate. When they have passed, they leave
behind them children similar to themselves, ''ho
hand on again to yet other generations the smoulder-
ing fire of a degraded life.
It is one of the ironies of our social system
that the care in selection given by the
breeders of stock to their flocks and herds
is a care which until recent years the
human race has never given to its own mem-
bers. We have been content that the crimi-
nal, the defective and the degenerate should
breed their kind without restraint, “in •“)
per cent, of patients suffering from mental
defect,” said Dr. Trkduoli) before a British
Itoyal Commission, "the condition is the re-
sult of a morbid state of the ancestors,
which so impairs the vital powers of the
embryo that full and perfect development
cannot take place.” Even now. the most
advanced legislation, and that is in the
United States, deals only with the fringe ot
the matter. There assexualisation has been
mooted——indeed some hesitant steps have
been taken in that direction —but. sentiment
stands in the way. It will take time to
overcome the ancient concept that life is
God- given, however tainted its human source.
But if public opinion is not yet ripe for
drastic legislation of that kind, reform in the
direction of control may be exercised. At
present we allow defectives to survive, but we
may at least do something to alleviate the
consequences. That is as far as English
legislation goes and no further. Here we
have not gone even that far. If we are con-
tent with our present laissez-faire attitude,
then the odds are all against a great Aus-
tralian people. We may have a race with
the fecundity of rabbits —for defectives and
degenerates are notoriously prolific—but a
race with a lower mental and moral stan-
dard than have the yellow nations whose
people we have excluded from our land. That
we have this problem to deal with is beyond
doubt. Dr. Sinclair, Inspector-General of
Mental Hospitals in N. S. Wales, says:
At the present time there are many mentally defec-
tive persons whose training has been neglected and
over whom no sufficient control is exercised, and
whose wayward and irresponsible lives are produc-
tive of much crime and. misery, injury and mischief,
to themselves and others. .. .The state of feeble-
mindedness is most frequently observed among those
classes from whom the habitual criminal, the chronic
inebriate and the prostitute are mainly drawn.
No care, no oversight, is exercised with
regard to this unhappy and dangerous class.
There is in American records an officially
authenticated instance of how freely degen-
erates breed, and with what certainty they
transmit their degeneracy. The .Jukes family
was traced to the five daughters of a lazy
and irresponsible father. In five genera-
tions the descendants numbered 1200 per-
sons. Of this number (and some died in
infancy) 310 were paupers, 440 were
wrecked by diseased wickedness, 130 were
convicted criminals, 60 habitual thieves, <
murderers, and more than half the women
were prostitutes. That was the human
clutch from one original nest of degeneracy.
It would not take many such clutches to
ruin any young community.
The starting-point in reform of this kind
must be the child —since we allow the little
unfortunate to be brought into the world.
At present no systematic attempt is made m
our public institutions to segregate mentally
deficient from normal children. They are
herded together. In the report of the Royal
Commission on Lunacy law and its adminis-
tration furnished to the Parliament of N. S.
Wales a year or so ago, the doctor, a lady,
supervising the instruction of mentally
defective children, gave graphic testimony of
the evil effects of this indiscriminate group-
ing. The feeble-minded child must be dealt
with apart from other children, not a few of
whom are vicious though normal. They need
scientific as distinguished from ordinary
treatment. This end is sought to be
attained in English and American legislation
by placing them in special institutions or
under approved guardianship. In such insti-
tutions training is given in industrial and
in agricultural work. From the United
States excellent results have been obtained
in these directions. Scores of children who
otherwise would have drifted into crime,
disease or pauperism have been lifted from
an evil environment and made at least physi-
cally clean and mechanically proficient units
in the community. Maoriland and Tasmania
have some legislation on the subject, based
on the English precedent. The most popu-
lous States in the Commonwealth have none.
What are we going to do about it?

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sinister Movements in Asia.
Many of the European nations “own” bits
of Asia —France has colonies twice her size
in Syria and Cochin-China, and soothes
some 266,064 of the disgruntled inhabitants
of India; Holland has territory six times
as big as herself, and a white man’s burden
of 50 million colored children; Italy
possesses some Red Sea property and a pom-
pous “concession” in Tientsin; even Portu-
gal claims a decaying fragment near the
Australian coast, a gambling emporium fur-
ther north, and a freehold in India which
exports ships’ stewards. These countries
keep touch with Asia only through gold-laced
officials and mercenary armies; and their
presence is regarded by their unwilling hosts
as a perpetual reminder of their own sub-
jection. Russia before the war had conces-
sions, too, but fortunately for her the Allies
made her give them up. They also en-
couraged China to withdraw the privileges
of extra-territoriality from Russian subjects
—another festering point of friction. The
Bolshevik was thus able to come back to
Asia on a footing of equality. He did not
abandon in any important particular the old
imperial policy of the Czars, but he was
able to camouflage the fact with eminent
success. He did not recapture provinces
that had seceded, or try to extend his rule
in the bold, bad jingo manner by sending
armies with lethal weapons, foUoWed by the
missionaries of a foreign ci ■ •
set up schools of Mohammedan leai.mn-
and Buddhist doctrine on his own side ot
the frontier; eager students flocked across
to learn that the Prophet ot Islam was the
first true democrat and tliat
an anticipation of Karl Marx, that Benin
was an avatar of Confucius, and that the
Asiatic family system was Communism under
another name. The enlightened disciples ie-
turned across the frontier to preach this gos-
pel to their compatriots, a revolution usually
followed, and a republic was set up, on
a not too excessive pile of corpses. me
republic hastened to declare its allegiance to
the Soviet federation, the local revolutionary
army became affiliated with the Russian lied
Army, and local superstitions aiul notions
about property were left alone. By these
beneficent methods, involving a minimum ot
friction, the Soviet has in a couple ot years
completed a series of annexations and re-
annexations unparalleled in the history ot
imperialism since Alexander made lus
famous Quick trip to India, the territory
controlled from Moscow now extends into
Asia as far as it ever did under the Czar,
and its outermost waves lap once more
against the boundaries of Persia, India,
China and Japan. The centre of the new
imperialism is bound to its extremities by a
continuous system of great railways that
no foreign invader is ever likely to cut ; and
along those railways travel the emissaries ot
the new religion and delegates from all the
races under European rule to the pan-Asiatic
conferences that are constantly being fostered
by the Soviet in Moscow, Kiev or Astrak-
han. The other day an aeroplane crashed
in Siberia, and the cables reported that in
it perished Soviet officials and Asiatic dele-
gates proceeding to such a conference. A
Canadian Minister stumped the United
States the other day in quest of aeroplanes
and found that the Soviet had pre-empted all
the available supply. The Internationale
was recently sung in Java— astounding fact
The native police drew their swords and
charged the crowd from which came the
blasphemous melody, and 15 were seriously
and 50 slightly wounded; and the Dutch
Government admits in puzzled wonderment
that its once docile subjects are honeycombed
with Communistic doctrine. All these inci-
dents are only visible signs of the deep con-
vulsion that is turning Asia over, and it is
the Russian Government that holds the
power to accelerate or retard the cataclysm.
Russia, in short, can threaten Europe with
the loss of most of its colonial estate, on
which much of its prosperity and wealth de-
pends ; and it can do so almost with im-
punity.
Health.
Dr. Springthorpe points the way to a health
millennium :— 1
The Australian has an ancestry and environment
second to none. Yet during the years 1918 and
1922 we had the enormous loss of 41,462 babies m
their first year, 15,6f>8 between 2 and 6, 14,835
between 5 and 20, and 40,788 between 20 and 40,
in all no less than 112,743 dying before they reached
their prime. And yet we hope for a White Aus-
tralia for our fringe of population! We are really
permitting race suicide.
We must do something, fundamental, and without
delay. The question is What? and How? The first
essential is enlightenment. According to the Rocke-
feller Foundation “four-fifths of preventable disease
must continue, even under the most perfect organisa-
tion and the most competent staff, until such time
as the public understands the issues. An object-
lesson is the way in which Maori land has reduced
its infantile death rate to 50 p.e. below that or
Australia, and its diarrheeal rate to something like
one-fifth by “the, systematic education and training
in mothercraft which has been carried out in
the Dominion for the past 16 years (Tritby Kino).
The same view was recently taken in Ameiica,
where the two leading societies dealing with
tuberculosis resolved “It is our present duty to
recall that there is no medicine, vaccine or serum
the efficiency of which has been demonstrated, and
to warn consumptives against the danger which
they run, and the waste of money and effort in
therapeutics, because both cure and durable ameliora-
tion depend on vigorously observed measures of
personal health and attentive medical surveillance.’'
And it is largely because the medical profession has
never been taught the place and potency of the
psychical factor in ’ health and disease that annies
of men and women to-day flock to quacks of all sorts,
wherein there is a smattering of crude psychology
combined with a complete ignorance of the physical
basis, at the cost of overwhelming sacrifice.
Our Commonwealth is now meeting the situation
by a Royal Commission “to inquire into and report
upon Public Health as a matter for legislation
and administration, by the; Commonwealth, m con-
junction with the States where necessary.” That is,
the Commission is not directed to deal, other than
incidentally, with the dour-fifths of preventable
disease which depends upfon public understanding.
1 am one of the last to minimise the value of
laws and administration, and in my evidence before
the Commission threw all the light I could upon
such reforms and improvements. But 1 am mai.nlv
concerned with the submerged four-fifths: and accord-
ingly asked the Commission, if possible, to place
this aspect foremost, believing that it would then
introduce a new era, ai»d lead to better results than
any previous Commission. On its decision to stay
within the terms of its appointment, I appealed to
the Prime Minister to extend its scope, and I now
appeal to the publuc f<|r support.
Public health is but personal health in the mass.
Legislation and administration should follow lines
of’causation. The underlying essentials are direct
action through the individual. At present there is
almost universal ignorance of the laws of health
and of development, of the potency of the psychical
factor, of the ways and ends of diet, of the lessons
of breeding, of the regulation of the sexual instinct,
of the position of. stimulo-sedatives, and of the
personal vulnerability which generally conditions
attack, extension and ending of disease. It is only
when personal health reaches its maximum
and how else than by personal education? —that
administration and .legislation can possibly be re-
duced to their minima, and public health be
at its best. How qan a Royal Commission which
follows none of these matters to their bases achieve
the results which ai\|; so required?
I submit that wtyit is wanted is a new era in
education, and a revolution in attitude and action
by all concerned. (Make personal health a funda-
mental in primary education; place the laws of
health even before tlie laws of grammar; make diet
a live question and cookery a sine qua non for senior
girls; give scholars opportunities of recognising the
elements of public hygiene; pay more attention to
the emotions and, characters; affiliate with Boy'
Scout and Girl Guide movements; give senior boys
a biological introduction to reproduction, and senior
girls demonstrations in simple home nursing. Arrange
regular visitations oy school dentists, nurses and
doctors. Towards the end, acquaint boys with the
true position of stimulo-sedatives, and give girls
opportunities of visiting Infant Welfare and Mother-
craft centres. Later on introduce questions of respon-
sibilities, explain the result of misuse of the sexual
appetite (at present almost confined to advice to
adults, showing how they may be clever if they
cannot be good), and lead up to eugenics and marriage.
And do all this in an orderly, appropriate, continuous
manner, as part of essential school training, and
not, as at present, left to chance experience or
discovery later on. To deal with a public l so educated
there would be needed —and arise -a new medical pi o-
fession, with new views, new training and new methods
of practice; a better-prepared nursing profession;
and also municipal and public health administra-
tions and Acts of Parliament equal to the occasion.
Is this a dream? Surely the sooner it is entered
upon the better. The way will be long, and hard,
as in ail else worth the attaining. But only thus
can we hope for the best results. Then disease due
to ignorance should first reach its minimum; disease
due to disobedience will probably continue longer
whilst disease due to inheritance will linger on until
the pendulum lias once more swung to its primeval
starting point.
And then—-the Health Millennium !

The Comedy of Labor.
Fbemantle is no more than the fifth port
in Australia as regards the value of its
trade, being a long way behind Adelaide and
Brisbane, and it is sixth as regards tonnage
of ships, but in the way of industrial dis-
putes it holds its own very well. Tlie popu-
lation of Westralia is barely seven-tenths
that of S.A., and is less than half that or
Queensland, yet the figures to September,
1924, allege that in the previous 4f years
Westralia lost more wages than either of
them by strikes. . If it possessed a large
coal-mining community as N. S. Wales does
it should put up a heroic record. It is at
Fremantle, as a rule, that the Commonwealth
ship is held up first, and it is there that the
shindy is most earnest. It might be said
that it is at Fremantle that the law is most
helpless, hut as it is helpless in industrial
matters everywhere the remark might be
invidious. Certainly some of the scenes on
the wharves of Westralia s principal port
have at times suggested a small civil war.
Two recent events took place on the same
day. One crowd of lumpers was receiving
the award rate of 3s. osd. per hour, but
on a bright thought it demanded ss. The
regular arbitrator, who is kept on a war
footing to meet such cases, was promptly on
the spot. He didn’t dream of suggesting that
the award should be observed, but he tried
to save part of his face by granting 4s. 2d.
per hour instead of the whole ss. _ v\ here-
upon the plaintiffs looked at him with scorn
and amaze, and went home. In the other
instance the working party had previously
got a concession in the usual illegal way
and had gone home in scorn also. After a
day or two, however, a compromise was
arrived at, and the rise was accepted on con-
dition that four new arbitrators got together
at the earliest possible moment to consider
a further rise. Some have proposed the de-
registration of unions which apply for awards
and then tear them up. Others have pro-
posed that every union should be required
to put up a solid cash deposit, and renew it
every time it is forfeited for breach of award.
Still another set thinks that arbitration,
being disliked by the employers and treated
with coarse mockery by the employees or
their imported bosses, might as well he abol-
ished. The Westralian is the best-paid indi-
vidual in the Commonwealth, and, if the
factory output per employee is any criterion,
he is the least worked. He is the least taxed,
bar the Victorian, and only N. S. V ales,
where the coalminer lives a wild life of Ins
own. can equal him, according to population,
in the industrial disturbance line. The
State Government appears not only unable
to do anything, but unable to realise that
anything requires doing. It has more
troubles, real and imaginary, than Ireland
dreams of, and it wears its crown of sorrows
even in bed; but it sets everything down to
the wickedness of its Federal partners. Isn’t
it nearly time it began to seriously consider
whether there isn’t something very wrong
at home?
♦
The Government as Fair}’ Godmother.
Adelaide builders assert that the Labor
Government’s thousand homes will average
at least £lOO more than tlie £636 15s. for.
which the enthusiasts in office undertook to
deliver a six-roomed brick bungalow, "with
bath, gas, electric fight, sewerage, water
service, a 400-gallon tank and a Cyclone
fence,” for a trifling deposit and 17s. 6d. or
18s. fld. a week. Presumably the taxpayers
wili be debited with the difference, whatever
it may amount to, as in the cases of the
N. S. Wales Housing Board’s edifices and
the Commonwealth’s war-service shacks;
but the Government, with a desperate sort
of jocularity, announced that the job would
be completed on the day-labor principle at
Mr. Timms’s risk.” The extent of Timms s
capacity to pay compensation was straight-
way indicated at a meeting of his creditors,
at which his assets were estimated at
£132,452 and his liabilities (they included
£53 412 due to unsecured creditors) were de-
clared to be £125,894. And among the
assets were “equity in stores and plant,
£12.000.” and “work done [for the Govern-
ment] and still unpaid for, £12,250.’’ As
regards the last item. Barwell, the State
Opposition leader, alleges that, instead of
the State owing Timms money, the latter is
heavily in its debt. According to Barwell,
the Government arranged the business m
such an extraordinary w r ay that no deposit
was demanded from the contractor in the
first place, no damages were asked for when
the work fell in arrears, although the agree-
ment provided for the payment of “one pound
for each and every day during which each
house shall remain incomplete and unde-
livered” after the specified time, and there
were considerable overpayments besides: —
The amount advanced to Mr. Timms in respect of
foundations laid was far in excess of what is either
reasonable or customary. This accounts for the very
large number of foundations laid, many of which
are now overgrown with, grass. A sum of £12,760
was paid to Mr. Timms without authority or legal
right of any kind. The contract was entered into
on June 27. Not less than 80 houses were to be
completed by October 27, and the remainder at the
rate of not less than 115 houses a calendar month;
so that by March 27 there should have been com-
pleted 655 houses. The number finished by thaJ
date was 61, a shortage of 594.
Bakwell tackled the Government on those
lines, although the indictment was presented
in a less elaborate form, shortly after the
work came to a standstill. The Government
replied by saying that it had nothing to say.
In the circumstances, few South Australians
begrudged the Opposition leader the pleasuie
which it must have afforded him to remark
(being a much badgered Babwell) that for
sheer incompetency, absolute want of ordi-
nary business ability, and wilful neglect to
conserve the interests of the taxpayers, the
Ministry’s handling of the thousand-homes
scheme was in a class of its own. All the
indications are that another massive burden
will be laid on industry because another fool-
Government, heedless of experience, rushed
into the fairy-godmother business instead of
confining itself to governing.
4
Compulsory Training;.
It is idle to pretend that Australia s system
of training is doing what was expected of it.
The training is supposed to be general, but
is avoided by an amazingly large percentage
of boys; and it is to be feared that many
of those who do undergo the course specified
for youths between 14 and 18 gain little but
bad habits and a rooted objection to disci-
pline. Further, the disgruntled obedience,
or outward show of obedience, makes matters
hard for area officers, who are liable to become
either tyrannical or unduly lenient. There
is, for this and other reasons, practically no
enthusiasm behind the system, on the part
of either instructors or trainees. In the early
days of the Act, when the lavv was regarded
as a triumph for the protagonists of national
defence, there was enthusiasm, and it was
mainly responsible for the rapidity
which the volunteers of the early days of the
war were turned into soldiers; but that spirit
has petered out, disgust at war and post-
war maladministration being largely respon-
sible. To-day the Department laces the
cold fact of the failure of the national train-
ing system, but seems disinclined to do any-
thing' except deplore the apathy or rebellion
of the boys and the hostility of parents. Yet
the failure is quite easily explicable. lhe
Swiss system of preparing for national de-
fence and security was in the minds ot most
people who advocated a national training sys-
tem for Australia. But the Australian boy
is very different from the Swiss. The lat-
ter has the tradition of an independence
secured and held by a people in arms, where-
as the tradition of the Australian is against
militarism and the professional soldier.
Many of those who have struggled to admin-
ister the system now realise this. One wrote
in The Bulletin a week or two ago ; another
has suggested to the Defence Department
an alternative scheme. The man respon-
sible for this was for 20 years with the 1 er-
manent forces, for 16 of them as an
instructor; he was in the A.I.F. and was cer-
tified at the Cambridge adjutants school to
be “one of the most capable of the Dominion
officers we have had.” After experience as
art area officer in Australia, this authority.
H. J. SHAW, declares that the present sys-
tom is only creating an antipathy to
national defence in the Australian. His idea
is that military training in its definite sense
should be deferred until the boy has reached
the age of 18 years. For younger boys he
would substitute a system of voluntary clubs
subsidised by the Government. His scheme
has been submitted more than once to the
authorities; but although the defects of the
present system are everywhere admitted, the
Department, like most Government depart-
ments, would rather patch an existing order
than make any revolutionary changes, anti
nothing is done. Nevertheless, if the present
lilan is a failure, Australia is entitled to
know all about it, and to demand some con-
sideration of measures which may improve
the position. The waste of money upon
something quite useless, though important
enough, is a minor consideration; what is
required is a plan that really will work to
prepare Australia's youth for the future de
fence of the country.

The Sacred Rights of Martyrdom.
A few ill-advised philanthropists in _ W ol-
longong (N.S.W.) have touched the dignity
of labor on the raw. Hearing that some ot
the youths knowns as wheelers, who are a
law unto themselves and collectively a source
of much trouble to the coal trade and in-
dustry in general, were undergoing imprison-
ment'in default of the payment of fines in-
flicted on them for breach of those negligible
laws which, by some unwarrantable interfer-
ence with the Gon-given rights of youth, had
been enforced against them, a body ot store-
keepers paid the penalties and had the boys
released. The only excuse the meddlers had
to offer was the paltry one that they thought
gaol was no place for the boys. The obtuse-
ness of such reasoning is obvious. those
bovs were martyrs, and to pay the fine ot a
martyr is only to make him look ridiculous.
Why were the boys in prison? Merely for
the breach of a law that might have some
virtue in it if applied to employers, but none
whatever when applied to wheelers. Mhat.
after all. is a contract? Obviously some-
thing the other party has to keep. One mis-
guided bourgeois went so far as t 0 say J, .'' t
he would give his last shilling, or the shart
off his back, to save boys from being sub
iected to prison. What! No prison, no
stake no rack, no thumbscrew! How can
you make martyrs without these fTPb
And what is the world coming to if lab< P
is to be deprived of its martyrs and left
barren of this rich provocation to strine.
The strike largely on martyrs-every
dav employers are ordered to put them back
at work, and. if they don’t, there is a strik<v
and something or somebody is declared
“black.” It was, therefore, only to be ex
nected that such atrocious conduct as de-
martyrising wheelers would meet withstrong
resentment from the heftj eomrnte of W" -
lon con g As they put it bluntly to the sman
soS tradesmen, they were quite capable
of looking after their own business. Think
of the appeals—wheelers languishing
prison, youth contaminated by Hie
bitter degradation of boyhood. A ' P nm]
by these wretched peddlers of ric
ciothes-pegs!

Soldier Settlements.
“C.0.G.": I notice that a Revaluation
Board has been appointed for the purpose of
revaluing N. S. Wales soldier settlement
farms. I do not know how wide a scope the
Board has, but if its powers are as limited
as those of the Queensland Board, which re-
cently completed its duties, then the sooner
the various N. S. Wales settlements get
together and consider matters the better.
The Queensland Board was appointed in
Sept., 1923. Seeing that it was to visit
each settlement to hear the plaints of the
settlers, and that an advocate from each
settlement was appointed and paid by the
Government for the purpose of assisting the
settler in the presentation of his case, it was
assumed that, in addition to remedying the
high prices paid by the settler for his im-
provements, it would also investigate and re-
commend for transfer those cases in which
men had been settled on land where success
was impossible. On further inquiry it was
found that the Board’s sole purpose was “to
revalue improvements with a view to a valua-
tion at prices ruling on June 30, 1923,
whether higher or lower.” As the advocate
appointed to the largest and, incidentally, the
most hopeless soldier settlement, I, with the
help of various members of Parliament, did
my utmost to have the Board’s duties altered
to that of “readjusting the prices paid, and
then, if the cost of improvements was out
of all proportion to the returns, to revalue
the whole as a commercial proposition.” I
contended that improvements set up on a
sandy block miles from a railway line could
not possibly be worth as much as the same
improvements on good soil, and close to
transportation, especially as the perpetual-
lease rentals were similar. I asked that
power be given the Board to condemn any
area where a man had no possible chance of
making a living. Unfortunately these re-
quests were refused; and, notwithstanding
that the Board could have completed its
duties in a week by sitting round a table
with a schedule of prices and a list of assets,
it went through the sorry farce of revisiting
every settlement, inspecting every farm, and
taking down each man’s evidence. In tin'
circumstances it is no wonder that 18
months elapsed before the Board handed in
its report. And in that 18 months no
fewer than 00 men had been compelled to
walk off my settlement alone (300 had
walked off prior to this). All these months of
work by the Board resulted in an average reduc-
tion of 10 per year in the settler’s indebted-
ness. The questions of back interest and liv-
ing possibilities were not touched. Needless
to say, a big agitation arose, and as- an up-
shot many concessions have been given. It
is only fair to Minister McCormack to say
that, when he was at length roused to action,
lie acted fairly and even generously.
Back unpaid interest has been cancelled,
and no interest will be collected qn fruit
propositions until they are in profit. Tragi-
cal Beerburrum is to be interest free till
1928. for those who can hang on, and the
late chairman of the Revaluation Board is
at present interviewing the remainder with
a view of getting information as to the class
of farming they desire to be transferred to.
The Minister has made areas available around
Gympie, in the Collide Valley and in the
Burnett. But all these concessions cannot
bring back the wasted years, nor can it help
those who gave up the struggle in the last
IS months. Let N. S. Wales and other
States profit by our experience.

The Woman in the Mask.
In the Tuileries Gardens in Paris there is a
statue of a gloriously proportioned woman.
Looking back at her gratefully as you pass,
you are shocked to find the smiling face
changed to a frightful scowl. Returning to
inquire into the phenomenon you find that
the smiling face is a mask held up by the
deceiving lady; her true aspect is one of
horror. What the sculptor intended by his
little trick is not quite clear; but he has
created an apt symbol of Europe before the
war. Up to within a few days of that surpris-
ing outbreak Russia, Germany and France
presented as unbelligerent an appearance as
any Australian State. Petrograd and Berlin
were as full of suave consideration for the
tourist as a sycophantic hotel manager, and
even Potsdam did not suggest an Italian
camarillist with a stiletto up his sleeve.
Although, in the days before the discovery of
the handy efficacy of gas, implements' of
bloodshed were large and obvious affairs and
Europe was stuffed with them, the symbol of
governmental power was still the unarmed
bobby. The unsophisticated eye saw nothing
to suggest that within a few hours terrified
tourists would be crowding to the frontiers
while millions of equipped and uniformed
soldiers would be rushing towards each other
with murderous intentions. Before the war
a tew voices were raised in warning. Lord
Roman's and others earned the hatred of a
lazy generation for raising the mask a little:
the latest to attempt the unpardonable out-
rage is General .1. H. Morgan, ex-Deputy-
Adjutant-General on the Inter-Allied Mili-
tary Commission of Control in Germany. Be-
sides being an expert on warlike matters,
Morgan is a pacifist. He it was wha devised
and piloted through the Supreme War Council
at Versailles in 1919 the convention dealing
with the occupation of the Rhineland, and
who blocked the insertion of a clause author-
ising the Allies to occupy, not only the
Rhineland,* but any other part of Germany
considered necessary; who spoke and voted
in favor of every concession made to German
industry when many of the Commission’s
members wanted to destroy all machines and
factories in Germany above the requirements
of her pre-war commerce. Morgan, in fact,
is a Liberal Englishman who still clings to
the hope that the Liberal tendencies in Ger-
many can be fostered; therefore his indict-
ment. which he resigned his position on the
Commission to make, is well worth listening
to. Summed up his charges amount to the
accusation that, although the leaders of the
Republican Government may be well-mean-
ing and sincere, its warlike departments are
only nominally in its charge; that they have
refused for five years to disclose their re-
cruiting returns; that they inherit from the
old army a vast network of artillery, muni-
tions and supply depots which they leave
idle or lease to convenient tenants; that they
still keep enough officers to serve an army
thrice the Treaty strength; that in pay, pro-
motion, pensions and most other tilings the
Security Police exactly match the regular
contingent; that the present army, in short,
is a robust skeleton that casts a shadow
THE VICTIM.
“The Royal Commissioner (Mr. Lamb, K.C.) found, in his inquiry into the Sydney City Council,
that there was a disregard of ordinary business principles in deciding which of certain tenders should
be accepted; that there was corruption; that the Labor party persistently voted against the accept-
ance of the lowest tender without adequate reason, and without due regard to the interests of the Council.”
across the map of Germany -which fits almost
to a button the size and shape of the great
war machine of 1914. This startling state-
ment roused little comment except in Ger-
many, where the Nationalist papers over-
whelmed it in a torrent of abuse. Most
English newspapers treated it with fretful
irritation and passed on to analyses of the
Australian bowling. Actually it -was a
resume of facts contained in the Inter-
Allied Commission’s report on German dis-
armament, which all the Governments now
have. That document has never fully seen
the light. When pressed to say why they
withhold it the Ministries concerned state
that its premature appearance would pre-
judice some wonderful settlement they are
engaged in. Meanwhile Europe maintains,
even without including Germany, bigger
armies than before the war. France and her
proteges can muster over a million, and
Russia has at least as many. A new weapon,
air fighting, is being feverishly sharpened,
and those nations which have colonies in
Africa are turning thither for reserves of
cannon fodder. Nearly every European
country holds portion of the territory of
others, and those who want to see the Ver-
sailles Treaty torn to pieces are as numer-
ous as those who think they will profit by its
perpetuation. Little about these fundamental
facts appears in public statements, and the
League of Nations is tending to become a
pot of pompous whitewash. Austen Cham-
jserlain the other day playfully likened the
present situation to a jigsaw puzzle which
only requires re-arranging to provide a per-
manent solution. The lady with the gar-
goyle face, in short, has once more retreated
behind her mask, and everybody is glad to
join in a conspiracy to admire it.

“Windsor”: A few weeks ago in The Bul-
letin I said that our present system of
military training was a farcical and expen-
sive waste of time. Since then I have
attended an eight-day camp at Seymour
(Vic.), and the impressions gained from my
senior cadet and preliminary citizen-force
training have been deepened. The eight-day
camp is a good idea, but, as it works at
present, it is in the main a mere change of air
and scenery for the trainee. He certainly
learns more about soldiering in those eight
days than he does during the rest of the
year, but that isn’t saying much. I was in
camp with the 3rd Division, the bulk of
which are infantry, as usual the least effici-
ent, least interested and worst disciplined
of all the units in camp. The Signallers
were easily the smartest unit, being all keen
enthusiasts. When a trainee applies for
transfer from another unit to the Signals, he
is bluntly told that he can be compelled to
attend only one Tuesday night a month, but
that if he doesn’t attend every Tuesday
night he’s not wanted. The tired trainee at
once rightly concludes that the Signals will
be too strenuous for him, and this accounts
for that particular unit’s efficiency. The
Signallers run voluntary and well-attended
camps of their own at Portsea during the
holidays, and spend most of their Sunday
afternoons with flags and heliographs. The
infantry trainees, on the other hand, stroll
along to their compulsory parade every
fourth Tuesday, and go into camp knowing
little and wanting to know less, and deter-
mined to have as easy a time as they can
and to do as little drill as possible. They
comprise (1) those trainees who w T ould not
attend drill voluntarily under any circum-
stances. and (2) those whose interest has
been stifled by the dreary senior-cadet tom-
foolery. If tlio drill were brighter and volun-
tary, those two types of trainee wouldn’t exist,
something on the lines of the Hoy Scout
movement should be introduced into the
schools—the junior-cadet idea was cut out
tor some reason or other—and a revised form
of senior-cadet training, strictly voluntary,
brought into force. If a senior cadet knew
how to handle a rifle with confidence, and
had learnt something of the rudiments of
warfare, it surely wouldn’t matter a great
deal if he wasn’t exactly faultless at “forrn-
mg fours. A strong nucleus of keen trainees
would thus be provided, and the citizen-force
officers would have an easy task when their
turn came to finish off the training. The
present compulsory system, combined with
a slavish adherence to ancient and orthodox
military-training methods, not only is fail-
mg miserably to drive anything more than
a superficial knowledge of unimportant drill
movements into the minds of bored trainees,
but is also steadily cooling the ardor of
those who are willing and eager to be in-
structed.
Once again the bloodstock section of the
Sydney Show has been marked by small
entries and wretched quality. Merry Syce,
placed first from three other candidates in’
the thoroughbred stallions class, is as poor
a specimen as ever fluked a first and a cham-
pion ribbon. What exhibitors themselves
think of the proceedings was shown by the
unabashed entry of Gigandra, 18 years old,
but such a fine ruin that he was placed
second by the judge, who might have been
netter advised to refuse to make any award,
1 his, indeed, the judge in the remount stal-
lions class very properly did. The first for
thoroughbred mares went to an A.Ti.C. per-
former in Eighteenpence, and her name just
about sums up the worth of the whole blood-
stock exhibit —“a disgrace to the thorough-
bred,” as R. Wootton put it. The worst
of it is that horses of this type are allowed
to go unchecked to the stud, perpetuating
their own faults and blemishes, and further
lowering the once-splendid standard of the
Australian blood-horse.
«
The situation of the Australians reported
by the Governor of the Straits Settlements
to be destitute in the Malay Peninsula calls
for action. Unemployed white men do not
fit at all into that social scheme composed
almost entirely of English taipans, Chinese
towkays and Indian money-lenders all hung
about with motor-cars, palatial mansions
and hordes of native serfs, plus European
clerks who struggle to maintain an equal
standard. The derelict white is forced to
hang about the Japanese inns or native
kampongs, where he assists in lowering the
prestige of the governing powers. So well
is. this recognised that most European ad-
ministrations used before the war to pass
on their white misfits, handing them over
to each other all the way from the China
(’oast to India: thd collapse of rubber,
when over 600 Europeans were unemployed
in the Straits at one time, made this im-
possible. . The Commonwealth Government
should ship these destitute Australians back,
and all intending immigrants to those
romantic lands of low-wage coolies and
foreign overlords should carefully consider
the warning that to “go East” unless to a
definite job is great folly.
; ♦
In its handling of New Guinea Australia
might well study the methods applied by the
Dutch in the East Indies, probably the best
governed aggregation of brown races in the
world, and they used to be the, worst. The
change for the better began when the old
company, with its ideal of large profits and
big returns, gave place to direct government
by the Dutch Parliament, which gradually
acquired a conscience in its attitude towards
the natives. Woeful ignorance, existed, how-
ever, as to what was good for Bi'own Brother,
so the administration divided the archipelago
into sections and to each section appointed
the most brilliant ethnologists, geologists,
anthropologists and economists it could get,
to live there and study the foolish and irrele-
vant habits of the indigene. The enterprise
was not only of scientific value, but a sound
financial investment as well. The natives
w T ere confirmed in their systems of land
tenure and superstition, and left to pursue
their own notion of happiness in their own
way, provided it was not too bloody or
destructive. Many expensive wars were
avoided, the population increased enormously
and the Dutchmen acquired a mass of in-
formation about the resources "of their posses-
sions which has been of vast value in their
exploitation since. The average Australian
“Colonial" official is taken irom a city office
chair and goes to administer a wide area of
which very little is known and to deliver
judgment.in courts of law in which evidence
is taken in half a dozen dialects and trans-
lated for his benefit in pidgin English. Igno-
rance drives him to adopt an attitude of con-
temptuous indifference to the language and
beliefs of his constituents, whom he comes to
regard as “only children.” Nevertheless, the
fancies and foibles of these people of the
•lawn are well worth studying, and some of
the most startling of recent scientific theories
have been built upon them.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Vic. Labor Conference, which annu-
ally chases rainbows so energetically, en-
tered upon its task this year in the presence
of solemn Mat Charlton, who -urged the
party to get back to the spirit of 1010. with
the slogan of ‘Unanimity and Solidarity.
The party would bo bettor advised to got
back to the policy of 1910; then the spirit
would revive naturally, and “slogans could
be left to patent-medicine people and the
like. In 1910 the party stood for the White
Australia policy, and for an Australian
Navy and an Australian Army based on the
military training of youth ; in fact, for Aus-
tralianism in all things. Nowadays it stands
for pacifism and naval construction at Cocka-
too as a form of unemployed relief; for inter-
nationalism and the exclusion of immigrants ;
for the socialisation of industry after the
Moscow fashion with discrimination m ta\or
of rich capitalists like Wren. These prin-
ciples are unidentifiable with the spirit of
1010,” and are beyond the art of any slogan-
writer to reconcile. , ,
It transpires that Premier Fuller isn t
going to the N.S.W. electors solely because
the flight of time makes it inevitable. He is
seeking a “mandate” to reform the scan-
dalous system of city government m Sydney.
He won’t get it, of course. The disreputable
municipality contains less than 5 per cent,
of the population of the State, and the other
95 per cent, won’t drop their own vital ques-
tions to make this a paramount issue. Sydney
won’t make it a paramount issue either. A
more strenuous man might have suspended
the council, as was done once before, pend-
ing a cleaning up, and then let his opponent
scour the country for a mandate to put the
old crowd of disreputables back again. It
is always good policy to make the other
fellow do the hard walking.
The Sydney waterside dispute and chronic
hold-up assumed “a new aspect” the other
day when the High Court granted “an in-
junction to restrain the Seamen’s Union and
its officials from committing breaches of
the award.” In due time the Court may
be expected to grant an injunction prohibit-
ing breakage of this injunction, and then an
injunction injuncting against breach of the
injunction commanding better observance oi
the injunction before this one. _ It all sug-
gests the interminable procession of fleas,
each living on the back of the flea in front
and with the flea behind living on it. The
parties addressed laughed the metallic laugh,
and proceeded to put the High Court in its
place by holding up another ship.
THE WHITE-HAIRED BOY.
"M a time when many important Australian industries are languishing owing to unfair foreign com-
petition, it is refreshing to find that the Government is not neglecting to give the lord Motor Co. a
hearty welcome.”
CUSTOMS MISTRESS PRATTEN : “Welcome, Hole stranger, welcome! I haven't been able
to do much for these local boys, but you shall have the top brick off the chim-
ney, bless you!"
There is something pathetic in the way
Victoria has become hysteric about the start-
ing of a Ford body-building plant at North
Shore, outside Geelong, near where L>e Cans
was going to found a new city. There could
hardly have been more prnans if Geelong had
been chosen for the site of the New Jerusa-
lem. with promise of a harp-factory by June,
1926. Certainly more good than harm must
accrue from a Vic. town being selected for
those branch works to feed an American
multi-millionaire, but why not give a little
of the publicity to already existing Geelong
industries which represent Australian capi-
tal tied up—some of it non-earning i Gee-
long, for instance, has many textile looms
idle, wool-scours and fellmongeries not work-
ing to capacity, a glassworks which is doing
nothing, meatworks (one controlled by Ves-
teys) which could do more, existing wharves
which are not congested, and an extinct
brewery or two. They want a boost far
worse than the Ford enterprise does, and aie
better worth it.
The law is a soft-eyed gazelle these days.
A typical instance was when Justice 1 owers
was earnestly assured by a notorious disturber
that if his Honor deregistered a union which
had been flouting the Court for months the
consequences would be terrible. W hereupon
the Law bowed its crested head and took
a back seat. On a more recent date Jacob
.Toll an son, of the Seamen’s Union, was in
question. Jacob was up on summons charged
with inciting to a strike, and his solicitor
proceeded as follows: —
I warn the shipping combine, without any threat,
that they are playing with gelignite, which may
result in more casualties being counted in the
capitalistic morgue than they anticipate.
It was a very obvious threat, whether it
meant personal violence, destruction of pro-
perty or something else, and the most obvi-
ous meaning of it was that, whether Johan-
sen was guilty or not. the law wasn t to be
invoked to protect people against him. lhere
was a time when the Court would have made
the legal gentleman apologise, and warned
him not to play with high explosives lest
there should be a casualty on the roll ot
solicitors; but such things aren’t done now.
In coalitions the stronger group absorbs
the weaker, but there is an unwritten rule
that the pretence of duality must be kept up.
Thus Pearce got into the Bruce Government,
and there remains, as “a representative of
National Laborism.” although “National
Laborism” has long ceased to have any
existence; indeed, the “Xntionnl
had no organisation to speak of, nor even
one safe seat, when Hughes bluffed the
Liberals so brilliantly in 1917. Similarly
a knot of N. S. Wales Cookies or Progres-
sives coalesced with the State Nationalists
in 1922, the true-blue Progs., led by Bruxner,
and the party organisation remaining aloof.
This arrangement had been almost forgotten,
so completely did the coalition Progs, iden-
tify themselves with the Nationalists, but
it was reckoned expedient to allege that it
is still in being. So the public was informed
in the week-end newspapers that the “coali-
tion” had been “renewed for the life of an-
other Parliament." The “renewal” was
effected, on behalf of the coalition Progs.,
by two Sydney lawyers and Whiskers
Wcarne, the entire strength of the “party.”
Not many hours had elapsed after the pub-
lication of the grandiose Pearce plan for a
reconstructed North when alleged favorable
opinions began to be cabled from London.
The most definite was attributed to J. B.
Cramsie, the ex-Meat Councillor, who stated
that “it is satisfactory to note that suc-
cess or failure is not going to be left to
politicians, but to three practical men.” It
is also interesting to recall that ex-Premier
Theodore was the first to outline the scheme,
and in doing so he put in his own application
for the post of administrator on a five years’
engagement. Presumably the application is
still in. People are already asking whether
Pearce may consent to occupy another of
the positions if his political prospects look
gloomy. And there are persons who allege
that half the legislators of Westralia and
Queensland are writing out their applica-
tions. We seem to have heard about these
non-political appointments before.
About 1920 Lloyd George, who is Welsh
and a sanguine jumper at conclusions,
reckoned that his maze of treaties had de-
finitely provided for the peace and prosperity
of Europe. About the same time W. M.
Hughes, who is also Welsh and afflicted with
the leaping sickness, estimated Australia’s
share of the Hun indemnity at £60,000,000,
and nearly got to the point of pawning or
selling these great expectations. This coun-
try really collected £135,000 from Fritz the
other day, the Allies having lent him the
money first, so life is not all froth and bubble.
Tasmania, which is tired of its familiar
part of small, lame devil at the back of per-
dition, has formed a Tasmanian Rights
League with three main objects. It wants
the Navigation Act altered so that any ship
which happens to be passing may carry pas-
sengers and freight between the island and
the mainland. It wants the Federal Gov-
ernment to establish and maintain a mail
service across the strait; but, knowing that
the present kind of Government is so weak
that it can hardly maintain a dead silence,
it makes the heroic but promising proposi-
tion that the officers and crews should rank
as civil servants, with the, privileges of such,
instead of being .Tohanson’s servants. And
it asks that the Federal Government shall
“ensure the proper observance of industrial
awards.” That is bitter irony. The Federal
Government is so flabby that it would hesi-
tate to insure £lOO worth of furniture.
The other day Bryant and May’s Melbourne
match factory, whose employees are probably
the most contented lot in Australia, had to
announce the putting off of hands; but after
the secretary of the union had been shown
the stacked goods awaiting sales, the convic-
tion that there had to be a limitation of out-
put was made so plain that the employees
agreed to share the work round by all do-
ing half-time. They put the blame for their
trouble on their fellow-workers of Australia
who, without benefiting by cheaper prices,
buy two boxes of imported matches to every
one of the better local article, in sheer indif-
ference to the claims of the local industry.
And, of course, blame is also attachable to a
Government which has done nothing, in spite
of a guarantee by the matchmakers that not
only would the price of matches not be in-
creased should a higher duty be, imposed, but
with a bigger output there would probably
be a decrease. An additional reason why
Australian working people should support the
local industry is that, by doing so they will
show appreciation of good conditions of em-
ployment voluntarily maintained. The
Brvant and May people provide their workers
with free lunches served under ideal condi-
tions; with well-furnished recreation and
club rooms, and tennis, rackets and other
sports grounds; and in every way the factory
is designed to take the backache out of toil.
A pleasing touch is embodied in an appeal
of the Sydnev Printing Trades Union to its
members. It begs them to resist temptation,
and not print bogus ballot-papers for vil-
lainous Labor bosses and their heelers to
use at selection ballots.
An impression grows, more especially in
N.S.W.* that the Art Union should be abo-
lished as rigorously as cannibalism, and the
term expunged from the dictionary. The
thing isn’t artistic and it isn’t united, and
its frequent aspect of fraud passes the
grotesque. People receive books of tickets
from as near as the next street and as far
away as Central Queensland, with an invi-
tation to sell and remit, for the benefit of
some alleged charity. If the book is dropped
into the ash-bin it seems to make no differ-
ence. The results of all this fuss and sham
are supposed to be beneficial for various in-
stitutions, chiefly hospitals. In 1922 (latest
official figures) the 158 hospitals of N.S.NV.
had a revenue of £1,081.619. The State
furnished £495,740. Donations were £373 584.
Paving patients found £150,265. “Other
sources” ran to £62.030. The last included
Hospital Saturday, all manner of galas and
carnivals, and art unions galore. The State
mmht as well make up the £62.030 itself, and
bid’ the horde of ticket-sellers and promoters
make a bee-line for the labor market.
IN TIME OF PEACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ramsay Macdonald said he opposed the binga-
pore base because it would assist the White Australia
policy, and that meant a quarrel with Japan.
Oh, once there was a Waterloo and once a Kandahar,
For now and then —just now and then —there's been
a call to war.
And once there was a brotherhood —which now it
seems there’s not—
And if you hammered one of us you roused the

Yes, England, India, Africa,

We all was like a hornet’s nest where every hornet

“We are not huntin’ trouble, but we meet it when

Yes, once there was South Africa, and Diggers didn’t
wait
To ask, “Please analyse and parse, explain,

They didn’t thumb the G’ography with “Where is

When British blood to British blood sent forth the
Empire call.
No, England! Us and India,
Maoriland arid Canada,
We caught the distant echo of a dull, despairing
drum:
“We need you, O my brothers —say, brothers, wih
you come?”
And once there was a powder-pile, and once there
was a spark;
And when all Europe rocked and reeled and stumbled
in the dark,
And England woke to find herself in peril overnight.
Who was it heard the ancient call, and fought the
five-year fight?
Yes, England! India, Africa,
New Zealand, Us and Canada,
We look you in the face to-day without a touch of
shame ;
You wasn’t huntin’ trouble, but —we helped you
when it came!
And once there was Gallipoli—ah, how can even one
Forget the little crosses there that face the Turkish
sun?
Forget the hopeless fight they fought by rocky hill
and shore,
Who gave their lives to make the place a shrine for-
ever more ?
Oh, England, India, Africa,
Maoriland and Canada,
They didn’t ask who blundered there, nor try to fix
the blame —
Their Empire was in trouble, and they met it a s
it came !
We are not keen to speak of it —we’d rather fight
than brag—-
But still we know the miles we marched beneath ouv
world-wide flag ;
But still we know the graves we dug, the trenches
deep and wide;
We are not likely to forget those mates of ours
who died.
No, England! India, Africa,
New Zealand, Us and Canada.
We don’t begrudge one drop of blood to-dav we d

We are not huntin’ trouble, but we’d help you il

But when we strive for purity of British faith and

And when your politicians rise to plaster us witfi/

And tell us straight they’ll sell us out to save a
yellow hide,
My God, it hurts a loyal heart, it wounds a lawful
pride!
O England! Tell Australia,
From Darwin to Tasmania —
Tell it with yOur bugle-song, tell it with your

COLUMN
British Australian Wool Realisation
Association, Ltd. — Bawra is still blocked
by wigs; but the end of the real journey is
in sight. During 1924 the last of the carry-
over wool under the Imperial Government’s
wool contract plus some on agency account —
209,614 bales in all —was sold, the proceeds
amounting to £2,503,217. That is one matter
finalised. Some of the litigation and other
troubles which have been harassing the
Association were advanced a stage or got rid
of. For example :
The negotiations with the British Government over its
claim for taxation on the realisation of assets ended
successfully for Bawra. The terms are not stated,
but, anyhow, the directors write back to capital
£1,200,000 (equal to 2s. per share) from the
£1,700,000 which had been put aside as “provision
for contingencies, including taxation.”
Full and final settlement was reached in the
Central Wool Committee’s claim against the Com-
monwealth Government. The trouble arose out of
the contract entered into in 1920 by the then Prime
Minister and the Colonial Combing, Spinning and
Weaving Co., Ltd. The balance of £138,000 due
under the terms of the compromise arrived at be-
tween Prime Minister Bruce and the chairman of
the Central Wool Committee has been distributed,
half to the Imperial Government and half to Bawra.
The sheepskins litigation and the skin-wool action
have thus far been in favor of Bawra. But the skin-
wool owners have decided to appeal, and similar
action is probable in the sheepskins case.
Though the threatened litigation means fur-
ther delay, an extraordinary meeting will
follow the ordinary in Melbourne on May 7,
when it will be proposed—
That at the earliest date when the directors con-
sider it advisable, having regard to the position of
the litigation in which the Association is involved,
they call the necessary meetings to take steps to have
the Association placed in liquidation, and the assets
distributed among the shareholders.
Proceeds from sale of wool during the
year amounted to £2,503,217, and from in-
terest £272,081; there was the £68,848 from
the Central Wool Committee and £8550 from
other sources; and £1.008,829 of reserves
was written back —£750,000 from contin-
gencies and £258,829 from reserves for de-
terioration of wool. Stocks at the beginning
of the period were in the books at £968,449,
and all costs during the year totalled
£198.983. leaving a surplus of £2,694,093.
This, added to the balances brought forward
from previous years, makes a total of
£5,241.313. Sundry creditors amount to
£93,753 and £400.000 is provided for con-
tingencies and taxation; but the directors
think some of that may not be required.
During the year the Board concentrated on
conversion of assets into as liquid a form
as possible, consistent with a decent interest
return. This comparison indicates vaguely
what was done :
1923. 1924.
Cash —current, deposit, short
Vail £5,213,478 £2,799,268

Wool stocks . . . . . . 968,449
Book debts 229,287 38,364
Freehold and furniture . . 29,645 27,163
The distribution of 9s. per share on Feb.
12, 1924, absorbed £5,331,618, which
accounts for the shrinkage. Of total assets
of £6,327,468 on Dec. 31, £6,261,941 was
earning “a very satisfactory rate of interest.”
In view of the difficulties facing the Board,
which meant that much of the funds could
be placed only for short periods, the return
must be accounted good. The association’s
London premises were taken over and fur-
niture and fixtures were purchased by Lloyd’s
Bank at practically original cost* and the
Board expects to make a profit out of the
Melbourne freehold. Meantime, the London
staff and Australian administration have been
reduced to the minimum, and the directors
recommend that their Own little cheque shall
be cut down by half.
Amounts held in trust and/or pending
settlement totalled £1,814,595 —first 5 p.c.
profits div., £420,043; skin wool, £1,091,938:
and Wool Selling Brokers’ commission,
£302,014. The first two have been the sub-
ject of litigation as stated, and the third is
tied up pending the result of the skin-wool
appeal. Funds held in trust have not
been allowed to remain idle, earnings amount-
ing to £193.282: this is included in the
totals given. The year’s additions were
£80,273.
* * f t • •
There has been considerable market inter-
est in Bawra shares throughout the year, and
recent sales have been at 11s. 7d. to 11s. 4d.
The position is much clearer, and a close
approximation can be made as to the amount
likely to be available for distribution. At
Dec. 31. allowing that the £400.000 set aside
for contingencies will be called for, there was
a surplus of assets of £5,833.715, equal to
almost 9s. 10.2 d. per share. Then there are
the trust funds of £1,814.595. Of the amount
£34,620 is represented by its own shares
(face value), equal to 692,403 shares. Re-
moving that scrip from consideration, there
are left behind assets equal to 3s. 2.3 d. per
share. The shares, on those calculations,
have a possible value of almost 13s. Old.
Rut while that figure is based on the £400,000
set aside for contingencies being required,
it counts in the whole of the money held in
trust—both liable to diminution. On the
other hand, expenditure will now be re-
stricted chiefly to administration and legal
costs, whereas income from investments
should improve on last year’s £352.354.
Factors of uncertainty are the possibilities
of unfavorable decisions in the appeals and
the period of liquidation owing to the volume
of securities which will have to be sold.*

For the first time this bank unblushingly
confesses that it is a capitalist, £4,000,000
having been transferred in equal parts from
the reserve and redemption funds. At June
30, 1924, the former was £2,327,336 and the
latter £2,201,994. The balance of £201,994
remaining in the redemption fund was trans-
ferred to the reserve fund, and this and half
of the disclosed profits of £133,614 make the
reserves (£596,137) of the introductory table.
The other half of the profits has to be paid,
under the National Debt Redemption Act of
1923, to the National Debt Sinking Fund.
This came into operation after-June 30,
1923. Previously half of the net profits
went to reserves and the other half was put
aside, ostensibly for redemption; but the
bank had never relinquished a penny, nor,
thanks to the “may” in the original Act,
was it compelled to do so.
When the bank made its start in 1912 on
£lO,OOO advanced from the Commonwealth
Treasury (actually its authorised capital
was one million, later increased to 10 mil-
lions, to be raised on debentures, but none
was ever issued) it was assured of sub-
stantial business. This was shown by the
transfer on the first day of £2,341,720 of
deposits, mostly balances at credit of various
Government departments. Apart from this,
progress Was expected to be steady. And so
it was to the end of the second war year.
Then profits came in a deluge.. The Com-
monwealth Bank found itself handling tens
of millions of loans, soon to swell to hun-
dreds of millions. It financed and handled
the war and post-war wheat, wool, butter
and other pools; and, despite a policy which
kept charges down to a minimum, the huge
proportions of the business made big profits
inevitable. Meantime the Bank was getting
ordinary business with very little effort, and
there seemed a possibility that the trading
banks, which had done so much for Australia,
and most of which were linked so inti-
mately with its growth, might be embroiled
in a competition with the Commonwealth
Bank to the detriment of their shareholders
and depositors, and certainly not to the ulti-
mate advantage of the public. But the fear
was never more than nebulous, and the late
Denison Miller soon slew T it. Nevertheless
The Bulletin early realised the necessity
for more strictly defining the bank’s pur-
poses and activities, and in 1917 began a
campaign to that end. The war and post-
war difficulties had made clear the value of
central banks; and in Australia their object
was more or less achieved through the 1924
Commonwealth Bank Act. Essentially the
difference between a central bank and the
ordinary trading bank is that the central
bank maintains the reserves of the country
and through the medium of the discount rate
regulates local currency. Our recent diflicul-
ties in financing the big wool and wheat
exports—the first problem, by the way, which
the new bank Board had to tackle—were due
mainly to the restriction in the movement of
gold, and whatever the outcome of the
present, discussions on the return to free
gold, the burden of the responsibility will,
by general consent, be placed on the shoulders
of the Board. In fact, in the mat-
ters of the discount rate and the issuing of
notes against securities lodged with the
London branch, so long as the present posi-
tion holds the Board is called upon to move
with the greatest possible care. As in the
case of the Bank of England, directors or
officers of other banks are excluded from the
Board; but fortunately some members of the
Board are notably fitted, because of experi-
ence in banking and finance, to deal with
any problem which may arise.
Although the 1924 Act amended the char-
ter of the bank it stopped short at remedy-
ing some of the deficiencies of the balance-
sheet. This document is a mere skeleton.
I he fact that behind the institution is the
entire strength of the Commonwealth and
that Auditor-General Israel O.K.’s the
accounts in no way excuses the withholding
of at least as much information as is de-
manded from private banks. The Bank
handles the Federal Government’s cash and is
banker for three State Governmentsand
the transactions on these accounts make ’for
zigzagging deposits. Profits from the bank-
ing business are so stated without any de-
tails ; yet a substantial portion must come
from the savings bank part of the business.
Ibis table shows how wonderfully that
branch has grown since 1915:

cerned in the decrease it is impossible to
say. Assets moved as follows:

Advances (the item includes bills discounted
and other, sums due to the V- nk) were
£2,548,926 less than they were half a year
ago. and £6,784,738 less than a year ago.
It is no use comparing these advances with
deposits, for the latter are largely held on
account of Governments and must be readily
available. For that reason the bank isn’t in
a position to earn as good profits as an
average private institution witli equal figures.
Even so, however, the profits (if they have
all been disclosed, which perhaps they
haven’t been) are distinctly on the small
side; they were last year well under 6 p.e.
of capital and reserves combined.
Starting with the December. 1923, balance-
sheet the profits from the Note Issue De-
partment were shown. These profits go to
the Commonwealth Treasury. They were:
Dec., 1923. £711.761; June,‘l924, £552,822;
Dec., 1924, £699,397. Notes in circulation
at December 31 amounted to £56.890,226,
being represented by gold coin and bullion
£24,905,321, debentures and ~other securities
£29,212,766 and other assets -£2,772,139. The
ratio of gold to notes was 43.78 p.c.

Myer’s (Australia), Limited, is a holding
co.: it controls all the scrip (£744,993) in
two subsidiaries—Myer’s (Melbourne) Pty.,
Ltd., and the Myer Woollen Mills Pty., Ltd.
The latter includes" the knitting mills, run
by a third co. until a year or so back. The
remainder of the assets on March 26 con-
sisted of cash (in hand and on deposit with
the subsidiaries) amounting to £745,948.
The div. for the year was. kept at p.c.,
the other 2| p.c. being added as a bonus;
but as £50,322 was sent to swell the undis-
tributed balance, there will have to be a
heavy slump before the 15 p.c. is imperilled.
Hitherto the public has been interested in
the 9 p.c. cum. prefs. only—it is a substan-
tial interest, there .-being a half-million £l
shares —but investors are to be let in on the
ordinaries, the directors having resolved to
enlarge and reconstruct the co. “No further
capital is being sought,” the directors
say; but after the reconstruction shares
will be made available, although “only
a limited number will be allowed in any one
name. The idea is, of course, to still further
enlarge the co. s clientele and increase the
volume of. trade. Another important move
is tlie letting of a contract for the erection
ot an 11-storeyed building for a model de-
partment store in Lonsdale-street.
o . p J efs ' lo °k very well protected; on March
-.(> there was almost 30s. in cash and deposits
tor each LOs. of pref. capital and almost as
much in the share holdings; and the net
disclosed profits wore equal to nearly
times the £45,000 necessary to provide the
• P\ c - dividend. But the security isn’t quite
all it seems, because the bulk of the money
is ready in the business. The shareholders’
left-hand pocket has lent it to their right-
hand pocket; and from the right-hand pocket
it has presumably gone out to pay for stocks,
premises, etc. On the other hand the subsi-
diaries, according to the last and other re-
ports, have reserves of their own, which they
have lately “substantially” strengthened;
and that means also that the year’s true pro-
fits, so far as the directors can judge them,
were greater than the £205,738 mentioned
above. But as against that there may be
goodwill among the subsidiaries’ assets. On
that point the parent co.’s accounts are, of
course, silent; also, there is nothing to in-
dicate what the outside liabilities are, if
any. ’lhose who buy ordinaries will have
to take a great deal on trust. No doubt,
in view of the magnificent profits and their
rapid increase, there are plenty of people
who will be quite prepared to do that. Hold-
ing cos. don’t generally have much difficulty
in this respect. On the figures for the com-
paratively few years for which they have
been made available, the remarkable Myer
organisation is a wonderful money-maker;
and with that, the big margin of profit over
the dividend and the vapidly increasing re-
serve a large section of the investing public
will be content.

This is another Queensland cattle-growing
co. that is seeking a way out of its troubles by
switching over to sheep. Tarbrax station,
near Maxwelton, purchased in 1918 as a
fattening depot for cattle from the Gulf
properties, was placed under sheep in 1923.
and the first clip sold early in 1924 realised
record prices. The co. was fortunate in get-
ting part of last season’s clip in early, and
it realised the record Australian price to
date for scoured. The return was chiefly
responsible for the first profit for four years,
out of which two years’ divs. were paid on the
profs. But the co.’s interests are still chiefly
cattle. Fortunately during the “good” years,
when the Imperial cow was being milked,
the Board was not extravagant with its
divs., and the improvements policy of the
Q.M.E., from whom it took over, was con-
tinued. That, however, didn’t save the co.
from loss on the slump in prices and the loss
of export markets after 1920. To relieve
the situation Springfield, near the Southern
border, was bought for fattening purposes in
1922, and some benefit was got from the
prices ruling in the southern markets. At
the present time a large number of bullocks
are topping up on this property. The pur-
chase of Springfield, and the conversion and
stocking of Tarbrax, called for money, and
the co. went on the market in 1923; £95,371
was raised in pound prefs., and at Nov. 30
last all but £442 had been paid. There is,
in addition. £218,330 of ordinaries. The
balance-sheet position is not as clear as it
might be

What portion of the outside debt is floating
and what is overdraft is not stated. The
recent changes and conversion would doubt-
less increase amounts owing to sundry credi-
tors, but the bank overdraft is understood
to be substantial. Property, plant and live-
stock increased by £20,000 and the cash and
book debts expanded by £22,000. In all
these movements the influence of now capital
(£43,601) and' wool is visible. After pro-
viding for the pref. div. there were net
tangibles wnth a book value of £316,381,
equal to £3 6s. Sd. for each £1 of pref.
capital. But with the export meat market
still sluggish, the value of that calculation
depends on the livestock. The prefs. call
for £7630 p.a., and that should be easy

This is one of the old gas cos. of N.S.W.,
formed over half a century ago. But,
although Maitland has grown with the years,
the discovery of the coal wealth south-west
of the town brought Cessnock into being—
already a rival in size—and electricity has
curbed demand for gas. However, the co. is
a solid little proposition, and its shareholders
seem likely to continue getting the conven-
tional 8 p.c. p.a. The co. has a capital of
£34,875. Its special purposes and deprecia-
tion fund was £12,075. Outside liabilities
at December 31 totalled £9681 and liquids
and stock were £5442. Freehold and plant
are valued at £55,034, or £1273 more than
they were a year ago, condensers of a
modern type, “providing for a largely in-
creased make of gas,” having been lately
erected.

The Southern Cross Assurance Co., Ltd.,
having itself had great success in share-
selling. has blossomed as a company-pro-
moter : it has launched the Southern Star
Fire, Accident and General Insurance Co.,
Ltd. Nominal capital is £500,000 in 10s.
shares, of which 100.000 are offered to the
public and 20,000 fully paids are taken by
the promoter. In return the promoter will
make available the experience of its office
and field staff and its organisation; it has
canvassed its shareholders for business carry-
ing over £lO,OOO p.a.; and all its accident
reassurances will be done through the new
co.—this last representing an income of
£5OOO p.a. Even so, can the co. win, enough
business at reasonable cost to yield fair pro-
fits? The prospectus publishes an inspiring
list of the notably successful concerns. It
would be much more original to enumerate
the scores that are dead and the many others
that are still struggling for life, and give
reasons why the new co. will not experience the
same difficulties. The Southern Star starts
off with certain advantages, but they will
count as little unless there is shrewd judg-
ment in the selection of risks and economy
in expenditure. Competition in fire, acci-
dent and general business is keen, and the
cos. whose success is cited will be, because
of the very things which made for their
success, the keenest competitors for what
business is passing. Overhead shonl'i he
low, but a co. whose executives are still in
an atmosphere of life-writing at high costs
will have to get a different angle on exes,
in the new sphere if success is to be achieved.
London interests are to be asked to look
into the possibilities of the Essex and Moon-
light groups at Wiluna (W.A.). Both are
owned by Perth people and both produced a
fair quantity of gold in the early days of
the field. Neither, however, was worked to
any depth, because treatment could not then
get a good sulphide extraction. Nowadays
the flotation process is billed as capable of
doing this.
» * * *
Great Boulder’s Norseman side-show, the
0.K., has shut down. In the last five years
the co. has extracted a fair tonnage from
the property and railed it to Boulder for
treatment, but profits were poor when there
were any at all. Latterly the reef, which
was never very big, pinched and became un-
profitable. The co. now operates two mines
in the West, the old Great Boulder at the
south and the Golden Zone-Hannan’s North
at the north end of the Kalgoorlie field.
Neither will benefit shareholders much, so
the co. is on the look out for a new show in
some other part of the world.

Directors of Borneo Oil Option Co. (W.A.)
are in good heart. A strong Melbourne
crowd has come in and a number of Java
investors are willing to follow provided they
can enter on the ground floor. A director of
the co. at present in Java has wired that an
American oil co. has secured an adjoining
area, and this is view-ed as important. As
Melbourne and Perth now appear to have
an equal number of the issued shares, it is
difficult to forecast who will get final con-
trol should trial boring prove that payable
oil exists.
* * * *
Not since the ’nineties, when _ Southern
Cross (W.A.) had four mines in a line
paying dividends, has Yilgarn (W.A.) had
more than one profit-earner at a time.. The
tide seems to have turned, as Great Victoria
and Radio are doing well and appear likely
to do so for some time.
* * * *
The luck of it. Radio, at Manxman, near
Bullfinch (W.A.), originally comprised 24
acres, in which a small ounce reef was
worked near the north boundary. Owners
had a sudden inspiration to effect economj
in rents and surrendered the southern 1-
acres. Prospectors Hughes and Barr promptly
pegged the area and soon struck the Radio
reef, which has since yielded them a lot of
wealth. Unfortunately for the Radio the
reef dips out of the property across the east
boundary into Radio Deeps at about dolt.
In view of possibilities in the Deeps. Hansel
Mundy Co. has taken a free working option
on it and proposes to try diamond drilling.
As the reef is strong in Radio’s bottom work-
ings, Hansel Mundy has a chance of getting
something better than it has ever had.

Recent operations on ’Change in Mt. Isa
shares look as if the bears havq been un-
commonly busy. Anyhow, it is dilhcult to
find a seller now either in Isa or Cloncurry,
a tribute to local faith in the future. Ihe
deeper exploration of the has cei-
thinly been delayed somewhat, but it is now
going full steam ahead. Generally, the work
done below 170 ft. (and several of the shafts
are now down well over 200t’t.) has shown
an increased silver ratio, amt, taking the
Black Rock, the Star and the Rio Grande
together, the average has increased to nearly
an ounce per unit of lead. The significance
of this may be understood by perusing lead
and silver ratios in the superintendent’s last
half-yearly report. Work on the Black
Rock is justifying anticipations, and the
drives to connect Nos. 14 and 25 shafts are
at present in ore averaging 41 p.c. lead and
l>7oz. silver and 40 p.c. and 320 z. respectively.
From reliable sources comes the report that
the question of an early start on the rail-
way to the field is already the only
uncertainty being as to when it will receive
Executive approval and be announced. Ihe
Wild Cat remarks, for the benefit of the
smaller shareholders who may be out of touch
With developments, that now is not the psy-
chological moment to sell any Isa scrip.
* * * *
Satisfactory developments form the sub-
ject of the latest reports from Mt. Isa Prop.
In the Out on Her Own rich ore was cut
in the east crosscut at the 200 ft. level; “size
not yet known.” On the Ibus lease No. 1
drill-hole has thus far disclosed 216 ft. of ore.

Bowen River coalfield’s markets again be-
came available with the re-opening of the
Bnrdekin Bridge to railway traffic on March
31. The field had a period of acute distress,
as about four-fifths of the output goes to
Townsville for shipping, railways, etc.
Townsville was on the verge of shipping coal
from Ipswich, as floods on the Cairns line
cut off supplies from Mt. Mulligan.
* * * *
Walter Colley and Clayton left Mt. Gar-
net (N.Q.) several weeks ago after a thor-
ough examination and sampling of the ore
in the old workings. Rumors were current
in the North that the Zinc Corporation had
purchased the mine, but these were quite
anticipatory, and the question will doubtless
be resolved by the assay results of the
samples as well as the possibility of secur-
ing complementary supplies. In this latter
connection zinc deposits at Almaden. Mos-
quito Creek. Forsaytli and, possibly, the
Night-flower lode may be mixed up in the
deal if it comes off.

Despite the building boom in Brisbane,
Queensland Lime and Cement Co. talks of
closing down its limestone quarries at Gore.
“Lack of support in its own State” is given
out as the chief cause, which means that 200-
odd men will either go on Gillies’s dole or
enter into competition with the thousands
who are looking for a job. Although a com-
paratively small show, this co. produces
cement worth a quarter of a million annu-
ally from its Darra works, but finds the
competition from southern cos. too keen to
be comfortable.

After a very lean period the Sardine, in
recent years the mainstay of Kangaroo Hills
tinfield (N.Q.f, has struck another ore-shoot
in its bottom level. It looks like a new lens
popping up from beneath, and possibly will
give a fresh lease of life to the mine. It
extends for 20ft. in the level, averages about
4ft. thick and is estimated to run 8 to 10 p.c.
The Queensland gold yield for 1025 has
opened badly, owing to the decreased output
from Mt. Morgan; but the big co. is now
doing better. For the first quarter the output
is only 84730 z. fine as against 17.7360 z. fine
for the same period of 1924. Mt. Coolon has
been quiet lately, due to negotiations for
raising capital to work the group on a large-
scale. Gympie has fallen back again. No.
4 North Phoenix has just crushed 88 tons
for 218 oz. smelted gold. Mt. Coolon anil
Ravenswood look like being the only fields
that will show increases for the rest of the
year.

The quest for oil goes on steadily. Tara-
naki scrip has been given a flutter on the
Exchanges, with optimism strongly visible m
the prices. The Tarata bore was down to
1260 ft. at latest report, with the 124 in.
casing fixed to 1232 ft. At Moturoa the
drill was down to 440 ft. in sand with a fair
amount of gas. The reaming had been com-
pleted and the 15*in. casing was down to
256 ft. New Guinea Oil Co. is working to
plan at Vailala. The plant has been trans-
ported from Port Moresby to Vailala River,
and the assembling at the drill site is being
expedited. Meantime the geological examina-
tion of the co.’s area continues “with satis-
factory results.” Within the Commonwealth,
the S.A. Oilwells Co. is still talking of its
oil with no one showing any acute interest.
The report at the beginning of the month
stated that the sand at No. 1 bore had been
got down, “oil showing very strongly on
fluid.” The steel derrick had been erected
at No. 2 bore. In N.S.W. the Hunter River
Oil Co. is searching for oil and gas country
around Maitland as unobtrusively as a fos-
sicker, but thus far has had nothing to record
but the exercise. From other States is heard
an occasional report of activity, but the
Maoriland and Papuan cos. monopolise
attention —what there is of it.

“W’gabba” sums up
The - “suits of oil boring and prospecting examina-
tions In Australia during recent years, boiled down,
leave Queensland as the State with the most favor-
able prospects for commercial petroleum. And this
is the one State that F. G, Clapp, reputedly the pre-
eminent authority in the U.S.A. at the moment,
entirely missed. Longreach oil is apparently not of
great commercial value, but if in quantity could be
used for bithulitic road materials, synthetic rubber
and lubricating greases. The quantity is unknown,
but, as geologist h. C. Ball remarked, the presump-
tion is that if the water column was removed from
the bore the oil would then have free access into :t,
and we might have a truly-flowing oil bore in Aus-
tralia. Certainly, with this evidence and that of
the extensive petroliferous gas field at Roma there is
enough evidence to warrant large expenditure in the
search. If our own people will not now spend, why
not a little propaganda by the State Government?
For instance, a brochure to be distributed abroad,
showing outlines of the structural geology, the quan-
tities and composition of the Roma gas, the com-
position, etc., of the Mhgreaeh Oil, and the other
evidences of gas and bitumen from various artesian
bores? It looks as if we will never get commercial-
quality oil at depths ordinarily attained in other
countries owing to the high-temperature gradient in
the artesian basin. If we have light oils they are
likely to be obtained under 2500 ft. Apparently be-
low that depth the lighter fractions will have dis-
appeared by natural cracking. Prof. H. C. Richards
(Brisbane), after a recent visit to U.S.A., sounded a
note of warning. He said the results obtained
from the wonderful Signal Hill field near Los
Angeles showed how imperative it was that inten-
sive investigations, before actual boring, should be
carried out. For three years geologists worked on
the Signal Hill area before recommending boring
sites, and the wonderful productivity of the field
was largely due to their efforts. In this country we
usually subscribe a few thousands cash and put one
or two bores down on the hit-or-miss principle.

Bob Johnstone and syndicate are still
making good with their dredging plant at the
old Elsie Co.’s ground, near Tent Hill.
Emmaviile (N.S.W.). The predictions of
the experts at the beginning of the venture
did not stilie Johnstone’s optimism, which
is fed by the last clean-up—over four tons
oxide for a three weeks' run. He considers
that there is three years’ work still at the
Elsie.
The tunnel into the cliff face at Flagstone
Tin (N.S.W.) is in 24ft. in very hard coun-
try, but the lode seems to maintain its size,
about 10ft., and its 5 p.c. values. About
30ft. lower down the cliff to the south an-
other vein a foot thick has been cut, vanning
10 p.c. tin. Higher up the cliff face the
same vein widens to 2ft., and carries “good
values.” The actual percentage up .there
would look better on paper than the vague
term employed.

"“O.B.”: The Rand White Miners’ Wages
Commission, presided over by Justice de Vil-
liers, recommended a 20 per cent, increase on
the basic rates fixed in 1918; but, as
adjustments made since then have already
raised pay very nearly 20 per cent, above
the 1918 rates, the effect is not material. Hie
Commission proposes that the employers bear
two-thirds and the workers one-tliird of any
future rise in the cost of living.

A. P. Penman’s exhaustive rejection of
the “Eastern Gold” options at Patchu, Siam,
makes many disclosures where the prospectus
was silent. The area can be approached only
by jungle track after days on a river boat,
so the problem of the transport of heavy
machinery obtrudes immediately. The area
of 3800 acres has been worked by Chinese
for 100 years, and they have depleted all
payable ores to water-level. Penman’s quest
for gold in quantity makes _sad reading. In
one instance lie mentions 50z., but that is
liis supreme effort. Traces to 2dwt. are the
usual thing. Also, the widths and values ot
vein vary tremendously. After discussing
capitalisation, Penman concludes that the
assay returns from the ore were so irregular
and so generally unsatisfactory that it would
be courting failure to attempt to determine
a capitalisation which could be safely justi-
fied by the available evidence. Therefore, it
is definitely recommended that no further
expense be entailed.”

At a meeting in Sydney of Mandated De-
velopment Co., Ltd., it was decided by 1277
votes to 500 that the chairman should resign.
As a result all the directors will go out and

“H.C.”: The style of the company-pro-
moter seems to be permeating the geological
survey of Tasmania. Government Geologist
Reid speaks of 50 million tons of oil-shale
being available for mining, llow on earth,
on the meagre work so far done, can anyone
speak as to 50 or even 5 million tons? It
looks like a guess, applied, moreover, to geo-
logical formations which are known to have
been shattered and dislocated by a vast in-
trusion of diabase. Further, it is most un-
likely that the stuff will prove as cheap to
mine as coal: it is essentially “tough,” and
both in undercutting and in breaking down
the brittle coal would win easily.

was mustered that particular keg wap miss-

home that night; whereupon an ancient
grandfather, contemporary with the deceased
merchant, solved the ancient Problem.

the whole thing should be immediately dis-
posed of. It was accordingly cons,gmed to
a well near Miller’s Point. W lien the small

“Herodot” witnesses a. conversion :
When Ah Sing was thrown from a cart near
Mackay (Q.) some canecutters carried him to the
hospital, where he stayed for about four month,
with a fractured leg and other injuries. 1 met him
a few days after lie had been discharged, and lie
invited me to come to his house the following
night and bring the doctor under whose immediate
care he had been while in the hospital. Ah Sing,
it appeared, wished to formally renounce ins pagan
beliefs and embrace Christianity, presumably out ot
gratitude for iiis mended limb and regained nealta.
I’irsjt of all lie administered a sound beating to a
repulsive-looking joss, using a four-foot stick, after
which lie kicked it around the room a couple ot
times and then flung it out into the back yard. Then
he dived into a tin trunk and brought up a brown-
paper parcel which, • when unwrapped, disclosed a
copv of 'the New Testament •and a book of Methodist
hymns, both in the Cantonese dialect. These were
reverently placed on the shelf which had formerly
been occupied by the Joss. Then the newly made
Christian announced that the ceremony was finished
’and that refreshments would be served ; while wo

“M.ll.II.” : My heroine is an elderly lady
with a nervous dread of burglars. Not so
very long ago she was left by lier husband

suburb for two or
three days, and she
slept alone on the pre-

she reasoned would be
useful in case of emer-
gency. The first night
everything was peace-
ful, but on the second
evening a midnight

was equal to the occa-
sion, and a few
moments later a
startled burglar ‘ fled
for the road with what
he imagined to be the
report of a revolver
still ringing in his
ears. The next morn-
ing a jemmy and other
tools of the trade sup-
plied proof that it had
been no false alarm.
And close beside were
the remains of the
Chinese crackers which’the lady had launched
at him. * , *
“Uramao” : The Maori has to answer many

“Schnorrer” : The cables have given men-
tion to a wealthy Portuguese who, supposed
to be a devout 8.C., proclaimed himself a
Jew on his deathbed, and left his large estate
to Zion. He is probably a survivor of the
Marranos —Jews who professed to embrace
the Christian faith whilst secretly maintain-
ing Hebrew rites, and remained m hpam
when the expulsion of the Jews occurred and
the Inquisition was busy. The persecution
ceased long ago, and in Spain the Marranos
have disappeared; but in Portugal up to the
time of the revolution there was still some
discrimination; and the quaint result is that
after several hundred years the Marranos
make a sort of virtue of secrecy. Hie Jew
who is open in his professions is regarded as
an outsider, one whose forebears have not
been through the mill, and the outward pre-
tence of being something else is almost a
sacred duty.

MIRAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How soft it seems through the friendly haze, "here
the tears ami fears lie hidden,
The gentle vision of other days that starts from
the past unbidden.
It, blurs in clattering trains and trains all the
straining, weary faces
With nearer visions of flooded dams and the spread-
ing, sunlit spaces;
Till, dinging hard to' a swaying rack with an
aching nerve and muscle,
The bushman longs for his wide Outback, for the
rippling grass near an open track,
And the forest giants’ rustle.
How soon forgotten, a trick of Time, are the
lonely years of longing-
The dams drained down to a stinking slime and
the dying horses thronging;
The hopes deferred and the weary souls and the
long grey nights of sorrow,
When eyes met eyes in the camp-fire coals, grim eyes
of a grimmer morrow ;
When all the breadth of the earth and sky seemed
full of the plaintive pleading
Of cattle left in their pain to die and never a
sign explaining why,
And never a God’s heart heeding!
How mem’ry toys with the gaping sieve till the
dead past fears are shaken!
How well the glitering visions live, how the old
mirages waken!
And, dreaming on while the clanking train down
its iron road is swinging,
How good to walk on the gleaming plain where
the phantom hoofs keep ringing!
How good to know in an alien throng, when a bush-
bred heart feels broken,
The gentle swish of a billabong is fragrant still
with a shadow song
And a voice that is heard unspoken.

“Sixenate”: Not many men arc as cheer-
fully unfin uncial as a divorce-court respon-
dent in one of Melbourne’s hundred cases for
this session. The bride, who was a typist
(hubby was supposed to be a b «siness man
of some standing), was amazed when, |hoxtly
after the wedding, the bills came in tor the
suit the ’groom had been married in, Ihe
wedding presents he had given, even the
wedding ring—he had got them all on ast v
that he was marrying well, and would be able
to pay up directly he was a benedict. »tUI,
the lady was a trusting soul, and bought the
furniture with her own money on his promise
to pay her back later. The “later” never
came, and finally the lady got a new job as a
tvpist. Then her audacious spouse bowled
along and secured a loan from her employer.
Onto once did a suspicion that he wasn t
quite the clean potato occur to lam: con-
fessing his unworthiness, he wrote to his
wife saying he would raise no obstacle^ in
the way of her divorce, as he knew he was
“no good to man or beast.” 1 hen, running
true to lorm, he added a postscript: could
she spare him a few bob to help him out of
a hole? #
“Mephisto”: For utter friendliness you
still can’t beat the Bush. A Queensland
drover who had failed to give the township
of Augathella due notice before pushing Ins
sheep through was brought before the local
T.P. and duly fined £1 for lus negligence.
When the Court rose he went round to the
back of the courthouse
and borrowed the
money from my dad,
who happened to be
the magistrate who
fined him. He said he’d
send it back when he
reached Charleville.
And of course he did.

“Ces”- Mirboo North, an energetic town-
ship in Gippsland (Vic.), has varied the
usual procedure by putting its war memorial
fund into a higher elementary school to
accommodate several hundred pupils. The
«oT,ool stands right in the centre ot the
town in eTght acfes of land, part of t given
by the townspeople and the rest by the local
council. The township subscribed £lOOO to-
wards the cost of the school, the Education
Department doing the rest. The district lias
what Frank Tate, Vic.’s showman Director
of Education, calls a “highly developed edu-
cation conscience.” The late Speaker J. E.
Mackey, who represented the district for a
lone time did a lot towards that and he was
?“ S prime mover in the building of the
memorial. The only other of its kind g \ ic-
toria is at m the north of the State.
“Ferodot”: Our engineer told me the
story The night before the ship was due
to sail for China he took a stroll from the
wharf at which the vessel was Ijmg. it
was a fine evening,
and when he
reached a street
corner on the
heights of Darling-
hurst, he paused to
admire the panora-
mic view of the
Harbor. Then a
figure slunk out of
shadows, and,
thrusting a small
brown-paper parcel
into his hands, mut-
tered something
about having a.
“ ’ard job ter git
it,” and made oft.
With a guarded-
ness born of experi-
ence in many ports,
the engineer did
not follow hiifi,
fearing a trap. In-
stead, he put the
parcel into lus
pocket an d re-
turned to his ship.
When he opened it
in his cabin, he
was amazed to find
a gold watch and
chain and £lO in
notes. The ship
sailed early the
next morning, and,
after some thought,
he decided to keep
the fact of the gift
to himself. When
he returned to Syd-
ney a careful search
of' newspapers
failed to disclose
any mention of the
theft of such pro-
perty, so he kept
the watch and chain
and salved his con-
science by sending
the money to one ot
the hospitals. The
jewellery stayed m

nearly 10 years before he woie it, to tins

“The Rat”: The dapper little salesman at
our big store was testing his powers on no
less a person than mean old Paddy Flaherty,
using the whole box of salesman tricks in an
endeavor to sell him a suitcase. He tapped

it several times, discoursing fluently the
while. All to no purpose Shure pliwat

“Seebee”: From the point of view of en-
tertainment the cross-examination ot _ Cal-
laghan, publican and dairyman, who issued
the criminal summonses against the tour
Melbourne ’tecs for conspiracy and demand-
ing money (£6500) with menaces, was dis-
appointing. Of course L. B. Cussen and
Menzies, counsel for the three accused who
put in an appearance, followed the course
that seemed to them best, but old couit
habitues sighed for Purves or Frank Gayan
Duffy to cross-examine Callaghan. VVlt bv>.
cultured, refined Duffy, first running the
tape over his uneducated, shrewd, cunning
fellow-countryman, and then taking fall after
fall out of him, was pictured. The liberty
obtainable in a police court would have
enabled so much fun to be extracted that
the public would probably have lost sight
of the grave issues before the Court. But
such home-made feasts belong to the past.
We look abroad now for court thrills. We
import them by cable —such is the craze for

“Lex” • Woman’s magic influence again!
I ran into a man, prosperous looking and
younger than he seemed 11 years ago, when
he faced a series of embezzlement and forgery
charges which put a three years’ period upon
a prodigal career. He was inclined to cut
me; but, relenting, he told me for a star
that his old name was forgotten —he had
adopted a new one for a brand-new start in
a new environment. He was 4o when he
left gaol with nothing but the small sum lie
had earned there; but he had the definite
objective of a fortune of £50,000. He is
four-fifths of the way there now. and the
rest is easy. It is a fine recovery for a man
who is older than Ins years. Whilst he was
in gaol his wife divorced him and re-married;
and without bitterness he claims that he
never would have lived his old life hut tor
'her Then, to point his story, he took a
newspaper cutting from his pocket-book. It
related'to bankruptcy proceedings against
his old wife’s new husband, a prosperous
business man when he married, but slated
in these proceedings for ‘ reckless finance.

the quiet chap in
the corner, “take

ing. I’ve done it,

pleasant.” That

covered, he married his nurse.

“Clement R. D’Uppe”: Oftentimes, m
courts of law, learned Judges may be heard
to sav: “Mr. Counsel, your right of challenge
is exhausted'.’’—that is, when he has told
eight iurymen to stand aside. But the right
to challenge does not then become abso-
lutely void. Having Challenged his eighth
juryman, counsel may challenge the ninth
after having “assigned a reason. The rea-
son assigned, whether it be connected with
the mentality, morality or general respecta
bilitv of the juryman in question, is tLeii
openly declaimed, and those jurors aheady
sworn in become a ‘ panel of triers. Tb y
decide the issue. There is, however, no pre-
cedent in Australasia for this so tar as
know. One other panel deserves mention
—the “panel of matrons.” In the event: ot
a woman being sentenced to death, the law
lays it down that only 011 c life must so be
taken. Should it be urged that the hanging
may mean the death of two (or more) people
—that is, the death of the unborn—a panel
of four matrons must decide, upon the tacts
laid before it. whether the condemned woman
is enceinte. It may so happen—indeed, it
actually did happen a few months ago in
Sydney—that three or four juries lire m
retirement, and that there are not sufficient
iurymen available to complete the next panel.
In such an extremity the sheriff may empanel
any citizen he can grab.

“Bill o’ Costs”: The harassed students—
the legal embryos, anyway—who spend a week
or so sweating over difficult examination
papers and weeks more in tlie agony of await-
ing results must sigh for the good old days
when Bar examinations were much more per-
functory. According to the old practice they
didn’t liother about examination papers. Iho
test was a single viva voca, and the examiner
was more concerned about the candidate s
social standing than his attainments in
learning. Old barrister J. A. Strachan tells
how one such examiner was asked how he
came to pass a particularly ignorant youth.
He said, “I make it a rule to . pass anyone
who answers correctly 50 per cent, of tlie
questions asked. I asked this student only
two questions. The first was, What is the
rule in'Shelley’s Case?’ (an abstruse rule
relating to title to real estate). He answered
that it had something to do with poetry,
which of course was quite wrong. Ihen 1
asked him, ‘What is a contingent re-
mainder?’ and he replied, ‘l’m sure I don t
know,’ which was quite right. Hence he
gained his 50 per cent, and a pass. In
South Aus. (and probably elsewhere), before

dents in the law had to present themselves

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
AND TWENTY-FIVE DAYS.
A
SPANISH merchant once hired a famous sculptor to make a statue. It
was finished m twenty-five days. The merchant thought the sculptor’s
price too high for only twenty-five days’ work, and he told him so.
The sculptor replied: “It took me twenty-five years to learn to make that
statue m twenty-five days.

Earl Balfour was looking for trouble when
he selected April as the time for visiting
Damascus in the interests of the A’ew Zion.
Besides bitterly resenting (lie country being
invaded by land-hungry Jews from all oyer
the world, the Arab peasantry are passing
through Ramadan, the Mohammedan fasting
mouth, a period of intense emotional strain
throughout Islam, when 200 million waist-
cloths are daily twisted tighter and 200 mil-
lion pairs of eyes nightly search the sky for
the first sign of the “better moon,” when
men can once more eat and be merry and go
in unto their wives. Balfour says he should
have been told; and so he should. In the
chapter of the Koran in which the Prophet
enjoined the faithful to observe the fast is
a very clear direction as to the reception to
be given to infidels who, like the venerable
English statesman, refuse to leave the chosen
of Allah alone. “Fight for the religion of
God against those who fight against you,
but transgress not by attacking them first. . .
Kill them wherever ye find them, and turn
them out of that whereof they have dispos-
sessed you.” As he scuttled secretly out of
the city he had entered in triumph a few
days before, the famous protagonist of the
philosophy of doubt could have had no un-
certainty as to what the Damascene mob
thought of Zionism.
Those who believe in signs and omens will
see some portent in the fact that in the great
Tussaud fire, while all the effigies of exist-
ing Premiers went up in smoke, that of Billy

further political events,” was saved. There

Torres Strait lost an interesting person-
ality and the islanders a good friend when
C. H. Walker, of Badu, died last month. In
his quarter of a century in the islands many
stories have clustered round “Uncle Charlie”;
one of the best concerned a native who came
into the Papuan Industries’ store for medi-
cine for his wife, who had- ar pain in the
side. “Ah,” said “Uncle,” “we’ll soon fix
that up. Now. which side is it?” “Port
side, mine thinkit.” “Very well,” came the
drawl of Uncle Charlie, as he reached down
a bottle of painkiller. "You rub her with
this. But what a good thing it’s the port
side! If it had been the starboard, that
would be ever so much worse!”
May Holman, the new Labor M.L.A. for
Forrest (W.A.), was born at Broken Hill,
but at three she was toddling about Cue
(W.A.), where dad was a hairdresser. When
her school days were over she tapped a type-
writer in the Perth office of the Timber
Workers’ Union, and for a while she was on
the staff of the Westralian Worker.
Though a pleasant talker, Miss Holman
is no orator; but if a piano accompaniment
is wanted for the address-in-reply she can
supply it. And she can sing a capital song,
too.

As a Fort-street (Sydney) boy Os.

So the future Olympic Team manager's first
clubs were St. Clement's Rugby. Mosman

his marriage Merritt made his home in
Manly, and became
associated with the

Just about the time 75-year-old James
Griffiths, tea merchant and tine old philan-
thropist, was run down and killed by a
train at Bayswater (Vie.), all the electric
lights in his charming home at Ferndale,
four miles away, were; extinguished. The
household staff got a premonition of tragedy,
and when the message came that Griffiths
and two of his guests were killed, and that
his wife was severely injured, they were in
a sense prepared. It was Fate’s irony that
a man whose business trade-mark was a
railway signal set at “All Right” should
have so miscalculated as to allow a train
which he was going to meet to run down his
waggonette on a level crossing with which
lie was as familiar as with his office door-
step in Flinders-street.
A wireless message from the Moreton Bay
while ploughing between Sydney and Hobart
conveyed a note of tragedy. Gentle, blue-
eyed Mary Sturgeon, an English’writer who,
having some private means, had done much
research in London, and who was returning
to England, went overboard and was
drowned. She was recently engaged on an
exhaustive book on the life of Tom Hood,
came to Sydney on a health trip after seri-
ous bouts of insomnia and had a look at
Maoriland. The ship put about, and Miss
Sturgeon was picked up, but life flickered
out, and the body was buried at sea.
“Schnorrer”: Rabbi Dr. Abrahams, of
Melbourne, 70 years of age on April 1, is
esteemed by Jewry as probably the greatest
Talmudist in the Empire. He was the son
of a London Rabbi, and has himself been a
shepherd in Melbourne since the early
’eighties. He married, in 1885, a daughter ot
the Rabbi Davis who once presided at the
Sydney Synagogue. When the Chief Rabbi’s
■iob became vacant he was one of the semi-
finalists, and many Jews considered that he
should have been given the preference over
Dr. Hertz.
. Charles Hed-ley, for so many years asso-
ciated with the Sydney Museum and later do-
ing official work af the Barrier Reef, has just
returned from Africa. Periodically during
his long service at the Museum he made
vacation trips to the Pacific Islands and
elsewhere shell-gathering for purely scien-
tific purposes. What he does not know
about shellfish wouldn't make an oyster stew.
Some years ago he made a scientific dash for
the Yukon and did a perish in the far north
of America, he knows the beauty of the
Barrier Reef as a lover the dimples on his
lady's cheek, and recently he made a bolt
for mid Africa. Hedley’s life will be deck-
high with knowledge of the world and its
beauty by the time he is ripe for a seat in
the Ferryman’s boat.
Fx-Agent-General John McWliae is con-
valescent after seven weeks in a private hos-
pital, but he looks years older than he did
when he sailed for London at the end of
1921 to become Vic. envoy in London. A
few weeks at Inverleigh, beyond Geelong, may
set him up, but as a public man he may be
regarded as a has-been. A sub-millionaire,
he can indulge his taste to play the country
squire, and, without seeming to do so, have
a finger in the pie of public affairs.
The career of V. W. E. Goodin, one of
three Laborites who will stand for Murray
in the next, N. 8. Wales State elections,
reads like a chapter out of one of Jack
London’s novels. Goodin, who is an Aussie
of the fifth generation—a great grandfather
was an original trustee of l'arramatta Park
—spent his young days on a farm. Then
he went into a steamer's stokehold, and after
a few years of the sea put on a stiff collar
and studied at Hereford House, taking a B.A.
and an M.A. with honors in education and
philosophy at Sydney 'Varsity. He has
taught at Lismorc, Wagga and Broken Hill
High Schools: it was while he was on the
Barrier that the fierce political bug of those
parts bit him.
An army of canvassers laid the foundation
of the success of the tea business established
by James Griffiths, who was killed last week
in another Victorian level-crossing railway
accident. Arriving from England 50 years
ago, he opened a small shop for the sale of
tea. but soon it was only a depot for the
agents who swarmed all over the country
talking that particular brand. Merely a
fraction did much good for themselves, but
the advt. they gave the tea stuck, and there
were always triers willing to carry on. Event-
ually there were big shops in all the capitals,
and fresh advertising methods helped the
business. Griffiths, a deeply religious man,
had a kindly side. He never went out with-
out bags of lollies to bestow upon the child-
ren he met; and if he could load up his
waggonette with kiddies and give them a ride
lie would. Children were his weakness; hav-
ing none himself, lie adopted the family of a
brother. His wife, five years older than
himself, Was caught in the smash also ; she
died from her injuries five days later.
Tom S key hill, once “the blind Signaller’’
—lie got his head wounds in Gallipoli—is
still doing extraordinarily well in the U.S.A.
as a professional lecturer. His pet subject
how is “The Renaissance of Western Civil-
isation”—and the renaissance seems to be
largely mixed up with birth-control. Lately
Skeyhill was elected chairman of the most
influential lecture association in America—
the first young man to hold the office—and
the University of Ohio has intimated that it
proposes to award him its highest honorary
degree.
March 15 was the 78th anniversary of
the birth of John Clancy. Darwin’s oldest
identity; and after 52 yeai\s ? continuous resi"
deuce in the Territory John still feels fit
tor a little more. He made the port’s first
road, called, in the .spirit of the place and
the times, Smith-street.
1 ew Australian legislators have had such
a spell of Parliamentary life, continuous
except for one brief interval, as iHarry
Gregory, M.H.B. A Kyneton (Vic.) native,
he won the Menzies seat in the W.A. Assem-
bly as long ago as ’97, and held it until 1911.
when Labor at last beat him. For some ten
years he was Minister for Mines. Eighteen
months after his defeat he re-appeared as
Federal member for the Dampier division,
where he dispossessed an old political oppo-
nent; Hugh Mahon. A hard fighter, and gene-
rally more combative than tactful, Gregory
never needed any lessons in the gentle art
of making enemies. But he has always been
a solid worker for his State, and, influenced
by this doubtless as well as by a severe bout of
illness through which he had just passed, his
constituents gave him a walk-over at the last
election, albeit the division is an overwhelm-
ingly Cocky one, and their member’s rela-
tions with the Cocky caucus were distinctly
strained.
“Ces”: Who was the oldest man in the
A.I.F.? I plump for “Man-o’-war Jack”
O’Brien, marine dealer, of Maryborough
(Q.). An ex-R.N. man, O’Brien reckoned
when his sons joined up that he was not
too old to take a hand. He went right
through the piece as Private Jack O’Brien.
If I remember rightly he was 63 when the
big piece started. He was repatriated in
1919, aged 68. It must be pretty near a
record.
The first white child born on the Hastings
River (N.S.W.) went over the hill the other
day. He was John Gillies, who, after a suc-
cessful life on the land, died at Wauchope,
aged 95.
At 81 Cecil Way has abandoned the pursuit
of the 6s. Bd. His lawyer father, who came
from the Cold Country in 1840, set up his
shingle in Sydney. The son. who was born
at Maitland, married in 1872 a daughter of
pioneer solicitor Frederick Wright Unwin.
Avho. in addition to chasing Costs, helped to
found the A.M.P. Society.
COLONEL SOMERVILLE, the new secre-
tary of the Sydney R.A.S.
A man who had known adventure died
recently in Sydney. His name was G. F.
Waterson, and he was one of the crew of
H.M.S. Megaera, which sprang a leak in the
South Atlantic in 1870 and was with great
difficulty beached on St. Paul’s. There was
no provision depot for shipwrecked folk there
then, and the crew lived principally on shell-
fish till taken off four months later.
Waterson served on the Australian station in
H.M.S. Rosaria, and went in her to Santa
Cruz to avenge the murder of Bishop Patter-
son by the natives. It was on this expedi-
tion that Commodore Goodenough and some
of his boat’s crew were killed by poisoned
arrows.
Nearly 100 years ago the original Stinson
set up his sign in the Coolamon (N.S.W.)
district, and the other dfsy his daughter Isa-
bella. who was born oil the Cunningham
Plains, passed on. Sixty-five years ago she
married the son of John Barnes, owner of
the first stores at Cootamundra, the man who
was shot by Johnny O’Meally, one of bush-
ranger Ben Hall’s lieutenants. Mrs. Barnes
was 85 at the end.
Knight Cohen is now the father of the
Adelaide Corporation. With a record of
nine plain and Gawd Mayoralties, his record
is unapproached in any capital in Australia.
Captain John Mason, skipper of the Com-
monwealth liner Moreton Bay, is making his
last trip, after' 45 years on the sea. He
has worked his way up from A.B. to com-
mander. Perhaps the most exciting moment
in that period occurred in 1914, -when the
Strathroy, of which he was in command,
was sunk by the Hun raider Karlsruhe. Witli
the crew he was taken prisoner.
Pursuing its policy of training its own
men for the big jobs, Vic. Railway Depart-
ment has sent W. Thomas, assistant-superin-
tendent of transportation, and S. P. Jones,
chief engineer for signals and telegraphs, to
Canada and U.S. to pick up wrinkles. Op-
portunities are also being given to brilliant
juniors to go to jobs in N. America for ex-
perience. Chief Commissioner Clapp is him-
self Vic.-born, and jumped off from Mel-
bourne Grammar.
“Tu Hawaiki”: Joe Roe may have been
the first to make a regular business of deal-
ing in tattooed Maori heads (B. 26/3/’25),
but the pioneer of the trade was William
Tucker, known to the Maoris as Wioree, who
had been a sealer on the coast of the South
Island and spoke Maori. In 1811 Tucker
brought to Sydney for sale a Maori head,
aparently obtained in Otago. He was a
brother-in-law of James Kelly, the circum-
navigator of Tasmania in a whaleboat, and
Australia’s first Antarctic explorer. In
1817 Kelly and Tucker went' sealing in the
Sophia, and put into Port Daniel on the
Otago coast. The Maoris knocked Tucker
and two other sealers on the head, and Kelly
had a narrow escape.
“Dry”: Can anyone beat this record for
‘•casual” employment? George (“Dusty”)
Smith, of Paddington (Sydney), has shorn
sheep at Bundemar (N.S.W.) 45 years in
succession. I was in the same shed in 1902,
and it was considered then that “Dusty” was
part of the station.

I tells them this; how can 1 tell them more?

Oxmead”: Daisy M. Bates, a lady who
has assuredly studied the Australian native at closer
s‘ m M h n • nian ’ occupied a column in a recent
f • l , lEa ;' L ° ln developing her theory, or rather
. ett.ing foith her assured conviction, that the light-
haired aboriginal women—“virile
female Dutch types”—still oc-
casionally met with on the
Murchison and Gascoyne and ad-
jacent regions of W.A., are
descendants of two or ’ three
ruffianly members of Pelsart’s
crew whom that old-time naviga-
toi marooned on the mainland,
near what is now Geraldton, after
the mutiny and bloodshed on the
Abrolhos Islands, ’way back in
the seventeenth; century. Accord-
ing to Mrs. Bates, these lusty
desperadoes were regarded with
superstitious awe as returned
spirits, and, being sacred, were •
not only made welcome and over-
whelmed with hospitality, but
were suffered to roam the coun-
try far and wide indiscriminately
raping young girls and “wan-
tonising” every tribe' with which
they sojourned. It ; seems an
amazing scries of conjectures
built upon the tiniest fabric of
fact or tradition. It is not even
known for certain, that Pelsart
did maroon the ringleaders in the
revolt against his authority; an-
other version is that he took
them to the mainland and
hanged them. Even if they were
set loose and survived for any
period among the scattered and
savagely irreconcilable tribes who
roamed those parts, it is far more
probable they had a rough spin
and a short . run. To suggest
that these “fair-haired and stur-
dily-built Dutchmen,” as Mrs.
Bates assumes they were, im-
pressed themselves on all the natives they met as
such superhuman beings that they were permitted to
no exactly as they pleased—and that they did it
so effectively that evidences of their extensive and
promiscuous mating may be found to this day—is
something far-fetched enough to be fantastic.

‘•Pick”: While moistening my throat at a
wayside inn not far from Sydney I struck a
school at a game that was new to me. Seven
navvies who had abandoned toil for the time bein°
a , WatChi T the floor ' Each was Provided with
a mug of beer into which, at intervals, he dipped a
finger, flicking a blob of hopjuiee upon the boards.
°T er f th f miniature lake which first
atti acted a fly raked in the stakes, provided the
insect was seen to take a sip. When it departed
without drinking the player had to put a shilling
in the pool. Until one particular wage-slave wa«
accused of adding sugar from his pocket to his
beer, and proceedings were adjourned until the dis-
pute was settled in the usual way, the game
appeared fairly exciting. But what a waste of
beer!
FI ( ; Those Molong emus that were
fond of attacking people or vehicles (B. 26/3/’25)
were typical of all their kind in captivity. A long
time ago I knew one that was the terror of Mount
Abundance station, in the Roma (Q.) country, but
was the apple of the boss’s eye, for to “Jock”
Robertson he was as meek as a cat looking for a
new home. In those days there was a long open
NASTY INSINUATIONS.
"Pair er thick socks, please, fer a biggish man."
"One, madam?”
"One - yes, o’ course. How many husbands d'ye think I got, young feller?"
roiul sloping down to the station, and on this “the
Supei as the hands called him, kept a vigilant eye.
As soon as anyone on foot hove in sight “the Super’"’
went to meet him on the high gear and generally
gave him a devil of a time before he got to the
station. Robertson reckoned it saved him a lot in
rations, for only the desperate swaggie came that
way a second time. His pet side-line was to hide
when a horseman rode up. Old hands usually put
their horses in one of the yards. New ones threw
the reins over a fence or hitching-post and went
about their business. “The Super” would then
emerge from his hiding-place and, with his little
wings quivering ana feathers ruffled, make a dash
for the tethered prad. Result, a ruined bridle and
a. maddened horse away in a big paddock with the
banging stirrups urging him on. “The Super”
died as the result of a gentle flick from a drover's
stockwhip, which broke his neck like a carrot.
* * * *
“Slam”: I would like to invite both “Sax”
and “Marko” (B. 12/3/’25) to North Queensland to
sample the real thing in mosquitoes, and their
mi Id cousins of the South would seem stingless
ever after. An old-timer put the case well in
the bar of Bob Gallagher’s nameless pub at The
Bend, approaching Logan. It was at the stage of
maximum inspiration, about the fifth pint, when
the old fellow butted in. “The North ain’t no place
for pommies,” he announced; “at least, not in
summer. I had one noochum with me once on my
camp on the Di’mantina, an’ after the first week he
was just done in with loss o’ blood an’ want o’
sleep. Then I give him the tip, and after that he
slept in the little fowlrun, which wah made, roof
an’ all, of fine-mesh wire nettin’ to keep out the
hawks. That settled the ’skefeters. They’re as big
as willy-wagtails on the Di’mantina, an’ the brutes
couldn’t get in.”
“Ragar”: I’ve yet to meet the breed of
fleas that will face the turps and camphor treat-
ment. An ounce of block camphor dissolved in a
pint of pure turpentine, shaken very thoroughly
together in a bottle, and the mixture sprinkled along
the..foot and head of the bed, both on the frame
of the .mattress and between the sheets, will ensure
perfect freedom from fleas and other nocturnal pests.
“B.R.’s” idea (B. 12/3/’25) of buying a “few shil-
lingsworth” of ordinary garden mint would come
rather expensive by the end of the summer, and
though I’ve heard of it before it’s a poor second to
the turps and camphor spray.
* * * *
“Gouger”: On many of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria islands, particularly the Sir Edward Pellew
group, there lives on the beaches a “sea-egg” whose
overcoat is composed of at least a thousand long
black spines. The points are sharper than needles,
and any ass who touches them knows all about it.’
One solitary prick, and immediately the skin for
half an inch around the puncture becomes a purple
black color, with intense pain. Relief is obtained
if the wound is straightway sucked. Any ramblpr
on those coral beaches must have sharp eyes or
thick boots to escape trouble. There’s a great lake
on Vanderlin, the largest island of the Pellew group.
The water, fresh and pure, is about a mile across,
surrounded by waist-higli grass and medium-sized
paper-bark trees, the whole enclosed by low hills.
H.J.L. : “Nitric" (B. 19/3/’25) accuses
me of denying the whole theory of hybridisation, i
don't. But Ido deny the validity of “Nitric’s” ab-
surd application of the theory. I have never dis-
puted the fact of self-fertilisation, nor yet the more
beneficial cross-fertilisation of different plants of the
same species. Nature herself has largely provided
again.-t, self-fertilisation, which finds its counterpart
in inbreeding among animals. Genus-hybridisation
will not fit the banana-pawpaw bill. The banana
belongs to the natural order Musacete, and the paw-
paw to the order Cavicacew , and to cross members of
different orders is impossible. I suppose “Nitric” will
admit that flowering plants are divided into two
widely different families—monocotyledons and
dicotyledons. Well, the banana belongs to the
former and pawpaw to the latter group. This con-
stitutes a still greater objection to his theory than
.the difference in natural order. The third point
up against “Nitric” is that banana pollen is abor-
tive, for which reason the fruit bears no seeds.
* * * *
“Caesar”: A find similar to the discovery
of an old tomahawk embedded in the trunk of a
mahogany (B. 19/3/’25) was made in a hardwood
log at Gympie (O.) two years ago. This log, an
ironbark, was brought from Noosa, and when it
was being milled the saw struck a well-covered
foreign substance. It proved to be a telegraph
insulator which had been fastened to the tree years
before, when a temporary line was run from Noosa
to Gympie.
THE LETTER OF THE BOND.
"Mrs. Smith, I pay you two pounds ten a
week and everything found.”
“Ye-es, sir.”
“Well — find my stud!”
“Moe”: Some of the inland districts of
the Mandated Territory are the habitat of a large
bat which is said by the natives to suck blood from
the bodies of sleepers. There is no recorded instance
of this having occurred to a white man, but the
bat is equipped with long, needle-sharp teeth which
resemble those of the Brazilian and Peruvian vam-
pire, and are placed in the same position. Other
features suggest that it is carnivorous. Like most
bats, its habits are entirely nocturnal.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I came in from the distant places.
Where the wattle tosses its golden head,
I shared with the folk of those open spaces
Their envy of cities, their fear and dread.
The street seemed haunted with ghastly laces,
With the ghosts of Strife and the fevered tread
Of shadowy spectres that kept their paces,
Though Death had numbered them with his dead.
The factory piles that the golden lances
Of the fading sunset scarce thrust between
Were bars of a prison that mocked my glances,
Which ventured out to the What Had Been.
My heart was fined with a bitter longing
For the gift of a saddle between my knees,
The quiet of tracks and the cattle thronging
Vacant-eyed through the forest trees;
The friendly touch of the homestead people,
And the cheery clip of the rails shot home ;
The musical clank of the windmill steeple,
The perfect view of the starlit dome;
The fresh, sweet voices of bushbirds singing
In the vine-clad branches that held the nest;
The long-necked swans in the evening winging
Their lazy flight to the gleaming west.
1* arewell, old scenes of my early striving,
That memory colors with softer hue;
The bitter struggle and not arriving,
How sweet they seem from this distant view !
Perhaps the glint of these golden beaches
Has wedded my heart to these other strands;
Perhaps it is wisdom of age that teaches,
That opes my eyes with its gentle hands.
SENTIMENT WAS WASTED.
PARSON : “I feel very distressed about the state of your
husband’s health, Mrs. Tregloan. He’ll need all
our pity.”
MRS. TREGLOAN (wife of a mental case): “Pity edden
no good to ’e, parson. Bang to un is the only way.”
Enough to know for the fleeting present
That the city is not what it seemed to be,
But shares with its cousin the grim and pleasant,
The sorrows, the tears and the tragedy ;
That here as there are the joys and gladness,
Are the brows that sweat and the hands that ache,
The goals unreached and the self-same sadness
Of hearts that tremble and hearts that break.
The plaints of cattle in drought-time lowing
Have their echoes here in a thin disguise;
The rain that falls where the crops are growing
Sweeps down alike on the streets, and dries.
The days are long as the task is dreary
In the factory grind or on farms outback ;
The end’s the same when the lives grown weary
Set out at last on the unknown track.
Aye, all’s the same and it doesn’t matter
If you follow the bush or the city’s call—
The stockwhip’s ring and the winch’s clatter
Have something of kinship, after all.

J. A. SAFE, Prop.
"W.J.C.”: I trust the operation “Win-
gella ’ mentions (B. 19/3/’25) as deemed neces-
sary by N.T. abos. to convert, the youth into
the young man is performed with a more
business-like weapon that the Atherton Table-
land binghi uses in his corresponding cere-
mony, namely, a piece of broken bottle. My
particular friends cut great horizontal gashes across
the chest and stomach, and similar gashes from shoul-
der almost to elbow. Each arm carries three or four,
and there are anything up to a, dozen on the trunk.
While still bleeding the wounds are poulticed with
river mud. The resultant scars are fierce-looking things.
Heaven knows how the victims fared before beer
was brought to their country and they had only
stone slashers. I once asked a, well-scarred abo.
how he enjoyed his initiation. “My cripes, boss,”
he said, “he hurtcm plurry much. Me bin sing
out plenty.”
“Dingo”: “Wink” (B. 26/3/25) need
not be surprised at the oleander lolling blowflies.
The plant is extremely poisonous, and losses in
cattle are sometimes caused by it. The active
ONE OF THE NEW RICH.
“Always for showing off, she is. Why she keeps an egg on her
dining-room mantelpiece—an eggs at the price they is. too!"
principal is oleandrine, which somewhat resembles
digitalin. Both .this substance and decoctions of
the leaves and flowers have been used in medi-
cine, but the preparations are unofficial. In the
south of France it has long been believed that
even sleeping under the oleander will cause death,
and there is a tradition that some of Napoleon’s
troopers died from eating fowls roasted on oleander
spits.
“Numb”: That wily oldi impostor the
kookaburra has sadly deceived “Tara go” (B.
26/3/’25). There is no greater cannibal in our
bird world. In the breeding season 80 p.c. or 90 p.e.
of the food of young jacks consists of fledglings.
Watching for an hour or so, I saw a pair of old
birds carry 17 wood-swallows from a day to three
days old to their own young. I have also repeatedly
seen kookas take small ground-larks. At any time
of the year they will prey on chickens, and even
young turkeys if chance offers. And during the
moulting season they will attack any small bird
within reach while its flight is defective from scarcity
of feathers.
‘‘Yarrum": I fancy this must be a record.
At the mouth of Deep Creek, leading into Lake
George (N.S.W.), J. J. McJannett, of Bungendore,
brought down 17 black ducks with two barrels. As
We had no dog with us I swam in—the water was
thick as soup—and retrieved them one at a time.
I was nearly drowned getting the last, and that’s
why I’m sure of the number.
* * * »
“Buttenderry”: “Jacky Roo” may be eor-
rect in saying (B. 26/3/’25) that
sheep will live in a good season
in Western N.S.W. without water,
but, for my part, if I were look-
ing for a paddock for a mob, my
first consideration would be the
water supply, whether the season
was good or bad. Burren station,
Narrabri, is a fairly good sample
of N.S.W. north-western country,
and some of its paddocks were
watered by troughs supplied by
either a windlass or windmill
pumping from a well. I can
assure “Jacky Roo” that, if by
any oversight or mishap a trough
was not regularly filled, the
sheep would undoubtedly miss the
fluid even in the best of seasons,
and would show their apprecia-
tion when the tap was turned
on. An incident which makes
me suspect that sheep jo require
water is that at one time 1
assisted to skin 274 woollies,
which, leaving their own water,
had nosed up a westerly wind
and hung in a corner. .Just
through the fence was a dam.
and, the wind keeping from the
west for a f<*w days, the sheep
stayed in the corner until they
perished. This happened in a
fairly good season. The number
274 is indelibly engraved on my
memory—there were only three of
us to do the job, and the jum-
bucks were about the deadest
specimens I have ever encoun-
tered.
“Irevdee”: No need to go to Texas for
rough stuff. Lobbed hungrily into a Mnllee (Vie.)
dining-room recently and was greeted with a knife
which nicked a piece off my right ear. Four or five
tomatoes followed, and a loaf of bread; then a fight
started between two wheat-lumpers, and they stumbled
over a table and fell on top of me. The proprietor
arrived to quell the disturbance and soon got his
nose dinted with one of his own chairs. Then he
went crook and fired a couple of shots froin his
double-barrel to restore order. They told me that
something similar is liable to occur any Saturday
night.

“8.J.D.”: The theory of “J.C.” (B.
26/3/’25) re lost men
travelling in a circle,
that it is due to their
not planting their feet
in a line, or that a
man’s right and left
strides differ in length,
is, in .my opinion, not
sound.' When a boy 1
was /twice lost. Each
time 1 was accom-
panied by the same
man. On the first occa-
sion we left a shearers’
hut on a pitch-dark
night for the wool
wash about half a
mile away. We .walked
in a circle and re-
turned to the hut from
which we started. On
the second occasion we
were going from one
station to another.
There were no tracks,
i led on horseback to
pick the way, the man
following in a horse-
drawn vehicle. He
kept calling out to me
“Keep to the right,”
which instruction I
knew to 'he wrong and
so did not fully obey. 1 noticed pai\-
ticnla ily a small round swamp that we passed,
liinally, tired of the frequ(nt order “Keep
to the right," I complied each time. Some two
or three hours latet we had circled back to that
swamp, and there we camped for the night. How does
“■I.C. ' account for the man keeping to the right
when in a vehicle?
‘ Nitric : In his par about infantile
paralysis in Maoriland “M.G.” (B. 19/3/’25) men-
tions that bees in certain districts have developed
a go-slow policy due to a sort of paralysis. A
certain type of flower which the bees visit may
bring this about. In Bananaland the Iceland poppy
occasioned much trouble to apiarists, the bees develop-
ing the sort of trouble mentioned by “M.G ,” which
was preceded by diarrhoea and followed by the com-
plete extinction of hives. Incidentally, I have seen
no flower so intensely attractive to bees as the Ice-
land poppy. Three or four bees will ravage the
flower so fiercely as soon as it opens that in a short
time no petals are left. This poppy, by the way,
contains no opiate.
“Moe”: “Gouger” says that the smoke-
signalling and drum-beating systems used by natives
do not amount to much (B. 26/3/’2. r >). He is evi-
dently not very familiar with those employed in
New Guinea, just across the Straits from Cape York
Peninsula. When the first. Australian troops arrived
on the mainland of the former German possession
the news of their coming travelled hundreds of miles
within 24 hours or so, and the messages which were
despatched contained accurate descriptions of them
THE TELEPHONE'S DELAYS.
“That's old Dogsbody just come out of the telephone box
— he's turned ninety-two."
“Lord! How old teas he when he went in?"
and their numbers, and of what they were doing.
•Sometimes the news of an inter-village fight will be
passed round with all the details as to what started
it and what happened. Curiously enough, messages
which seem long when put into words are, when sent
by drum-beats, often very short in the actual trans-
mission. The detailed description of some occurrence
may be contained in a few beats Once, while
I was coming down the New Guinea coast, near the
Markham River, in a launch, a solitary drum sounded
in the bush for a couple of seconds. Instantly the
three “boys” on the launch were all attention.
After a brief pause the drum started again. When
it finished they informed me what it had said, and
in “pidgin” the interpretation occupied quite three
or four minutes. Yet the drum could be heard for
no longer than 30 seconds, and there were certainly
no more than 50 beats. W hen, later on, I told a
local district officer of this, he informed me that on
one occasion when he had been out in the bush
with some Native Police boys, a message consisting
of about half a dozen separate beats had been accu-
rately interpreted as the news of the arrival of
another party at :,a village some distance away, to-
gether with that of the party’s numbers and the
place whence it had come.
“Si Lang”: 1 can go further back than
‘Der Jong” (B. 19/3/125) as to protecting horses’
legs in thorny country. In 1879 or 1880 Father
McGinnis, a priest out between Eulo and Thargo-
tnindah (Q-), had a horse with leggings of raw-
hide ; a dog also. This was for protection against
the spin if ex. Moreover, my wife can remember
sheepdogs in North-Western N.S.W. also wearing
leggings of sheepskin in the late ’eighties.
* * * *
“J.D.C.”: What is the greatest weight
a bushworker has been known to shift in a day
without mechanical appliances ? I was one of a team
of seven who caught 9300 sheep in a day for inocu-
lation. Every sheep had to be lifted on to a rail
about 2ft. Gin. high, inoculated and dropped over.
They were nearly full-woollod, and in good condi-
tion, and to average them at 1001 b. each would be
well inside the mark, Allowing each man a little
over 1300 for the day would give him, roughly, 60
ions to throw over the fence. We got 10s. each
for the day’s 1 work.
“The “Jumper”: “Boori” (B. 5/3/’25)
speaks of dogs running down an emu with ease.
I’ve seen a fair number of good ’roo dogs go after
emus, but only once was the “long neck” run down,
and that particular bird broke its leg. I should say
that an emu that can be run down by a tyke in a
fair go must have either qualified for the old-age
pension or had his joints rusted by rheumatism.
I have never seen a dingo murder an emu, but 1 fancy
that he would get it by the neck once he had it
cornered. Dogs, both wild and tame, will kill a goose
by chopping its neck.
* * * *
“L’Fou”: I wish Bulletin writers would
stop praising the foolhardy person—he or she crops
up every summer—who chops off a snake-bitten
member. The Lord knows how many Australians have
been unnecessarily maimed in this way, and how
many more believe, despite what they are taught in
the schools, that it's the correct snakebite treat-
ment to chop off the bitten finger or foot —anything
but the head —immediately. “Eljay’s” example (15
12/3/’25) reads more like an exTiibition of panic than
ot pluck. It wasn t necessary to sacrifice one per-
fectly good finger, let alone three. The snake
poison goes along blood channels, not through
bone and marrow. A ligature, a good deep circular
cut lound the bite, and a good sucking, with appli-
cation of permanganate of potash (Condy’s crystals),
if available, is less heroic, but really sounder first-
aid treatment. And then get on to a doctor, bv
all means.

Runa : Russell, the M.L. gathering-
ground for deep-sea fishermen from all over the
pfiith, now holds two world’s records. One is for ;i
;>sBlb. mako-shark and the second for a 571 b. sword-
fish. The weights are official. The shark was landed
by J. Andreas, of Sydney, who for many years
has come over to Russell for the fishing season.
* * * *
“D.D.D.”: The butcher-bird is not the
only feathered Australian to keep a larder hanging
in the vicinity of its nest. The little bird-eating
spotted owl, common from Queensland to Tasmania,
has the same habit. It stores dead birds and mice
about the nesting hollow, impaling them upon splin-
ters, or else thrusting them into cracks for future
use, where they become dried and forgotten mummies
in times of plenty. This bird is Australia’s smallest
owl, and its nocturnal hoot very closely resembles the
‘more-pork ’ note of the boobook owl.
“T p North”: Music lias a great attraction
lor creatures of the bush. Camped in N.Q., with
a concertina-mad mate, I’ve seen a dozen swamp
wallabies squatting in the outer circle of firelight,
and, a little further back in tlic darkness, (lie
blazing eyes of dingoes. As the wind machine
droned on, queer little humpy-backed things rustled
from out the long swamp grasses and, bouncing into
tiie firelight, squatted prick-eared and upright, their
wondering eyes focused on the blazing logs, as if
the fire held the secret of the treacly sounds which
soothed the savage breast. In the black fork of a
dead gum would often flame the large round lamps
of an overgrown owl. And strange night-birds
would swoop low through the smoke and swish
swiftly by.
* ♦ # *
“Mcphisto” : “Dry” was able to boil water
in a paper bag (B. TO/3/’25) for the reason that
water has a great capacity for heat. When the
heat struck the paper it was conducted through
the thin partition to the water, which absorbed it
quickly enough to prevent a rise of temperature r-o
great that the paper would ignite. As paper burns
at a higher temperature than 100 dog. C., the water
boiled without destroying the bag. Had the latter
contained sand or some other substance whose capacity
for heat is not great enough to absorb the heat
quickly, it would have burnt.
“Cliota Peg”: Can any expert in the
Council explain this? During an unusually heavy
thunderstorm in Gippsland (Vic.) an ordinary
drinking glass standing on a, plate on the table sud-
denly collapsed. Examination showed that the bot-
tom, which was over a quarter of an inch thick, had
split, as cleanly as though cut, into five practically
equal segments. There had been no sign of a flaw
in the glass when it was emptied shortly before.
On going to a drawer in another room a few days
later I found a short length of glass tubing neatly
split in halves. Presumably that had occurred at
the same time.
EASY.
THE PARSON : “My dear friend, is there no
way I can save you from this disgusting
habit, of carrying home beer?"
THE DRUNK : “ Yesh —get up petishun to
keep th’ — hie—pubs open—hic—
always.”
“T.V.T.”: “Jesmond’s” dog (B. 26/8/'25),
which shows weakness in the hind legs when it starts
to run, is probably suffering from the after-effects
of distemper, and it is unlikely that any treatment
will effect a complete cure. However, if “Jesmond”
explains the case to any chemist specialising in dog
medicines, he will be supplied with a tonic that
should make a big improvement.
THE CHARGE OF THE DARK BRIGADE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ihe peace of Balaclava, a country town north of
Adelaide was broken on Saturday by a small in-
aboriginals. For half an hour the main
street Vas in an uproar. A fracas commenced when
Weetra” 6 arrested the flrst aboriginal, Maxwell
All the world has duly wondered,
As the poet sternly bade,
At that gallant, grim Six Hundred
Uho to death and glory thundered
And, because somebody blundered,
Hied betrayed.
Oil, the blades that bravely flashed,
As they cut and thrust and slashed
Through the huddled ranks they smashed,
Undismayed !
But there’s never sword nor sabre for a carver,
When Weetra leads the blacks at Balaclava.
Yet untold in epic story
Is the wondrous charge they made;
>iot so grim nor yet so gory
Was the path they trod to glory,
This undaunted, minatory
Dark Brigade.
Oh, the beers they bravely met,
And the blood from noses let !
The policemen they upset
On that raid!
With Peace League measures he holds no palaver
When Weetra leads the blacks at Balaclava.
So 1 cry upon him shame
Who flrst said “What’s in a name?”
Could another see Ihe same
Charge re-made ?
Not a spot more aptly named from here to Java,
When Weetra leads the blacks, than Balaclava.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
SILK
STOCKINGS
“Like a Canterbury Spring meeting," said
the girl from Christchurch after studying
the styles at It and wick on Saturday. And
indeed the Autumn meeting, with nearly
every woman tailor-made, but silk-stockinged
and lightly shod, did suggest a Maoriland
.just emerging from its winter cocoon of top-
coats, gaiters and goloshes. Suits well made
and dressmaker-made and bought ready-made
upholstered the stands, and so continuously
did brown and grey recur that they were like
a uniform. Tufts of fur and borderings of
fur (some of it so extraordinary it bordered
on. the miraculous) peered over the edge of
most collars and many cuffs, and the newest
thing in overcoats flew a special line in
leopard-like spots, or a straggly growth of
tortoiseshell. “We saw old Tom turn up
as gnu, and didn't tell, the same as you,”
emoted she of Maoriland as something that
looked like an eiderdown fashioned coat-
wise wriggled past, its cuffs and hem lavishly
adorned with bright yellow fur.
Skirts were short, but not so short as to
proclaim unduly any shortcomings on the
part of Nature in planning for W oman her
nether limbs. But the same consideration
was not shown in the choice of headgear.
Hats were worn high and narrow, the trim-
mings being hoist on the top of the crown.
The effect on the face beneath was often
circus-like. Knitted suits had their follow-
ers—not the knitted suit of former years,
but cut on long, slinky, insinuating linos,
patterned in many colors, or embellished with
borders of Oriental design. A Purves girl
from Melbourne, looking like a Betty Pater-
son drawing, fluttered the stands about lunch-
time in a cream woollen outfit, bordered in
scarlet, its short cape flying from the shoul-
ders. With this was worn a quaint little
cream and red woollen hat, a pink and white
complexion and fluffy side-pieces of golden
hair. Another attractive wearer of cream
knitted was Mrs. Hector Clayton, who added
white fox to its hem and collar.
The two vice-regal pews bloomed
mightily. The G.-G. and Lady Forster
gathered into their fold the Chief Justice
Adrian Knox couple, the Premier Fullers,
Mrs. Colin Stephen, the Vanbrugh-Bouci-
caults, the Dixes from Melbourne, and old
wine in new bottles, as it were, in their
beginning-of-the-season finery, like the Fair-
faxes. The State Exes, kept the balance of
power even with the Chief Justice Streets,
visiting magnate Frederick Dutton and his
lady, the General Brand couple and General
McNicliol; and the children. Elaine. Somer-
set and Captain Coote. The G.-G.’s lady
enveloped herself in melting blues from the
hat downwards ; while Lady de Chair tried
one of the new petunia shades in rich frock-
ing carrying a chenille design and topped by
a plumed hat in the same shade. Mrs. Pitt
Rivers, who looked in now and again on her
august parents, was tan from her tasselled
hat to her shoes. Mrs. Tony Hordern illus-
trated the trail of the leopard on her black
coat; and Gwen Fuller wore the latest thing
in navy and fiances. He looked a concentrate
of pleasurable emotions in a binding of
fashionable cut.
The just-returned Mrs. Oscar Ireland
smiled rosily under a thrilling hat on which
a green bird of curious lineage challenged
the ornithologist, and the equally newly-
returned and just-about-to-start-again Mrs.
Alec Hay wore brown tones in furs, hat and
frock. Incidentally, this lady will be able
soon to rival Frank Coffee’s 40 years on the
Pacific if she cares to put her travels be-
tween covers. Ceeile Bellbridge, from Albury,
•smiled on the day, and the young Alan
,Spowers matron (she was Rosamund Lums-
dame) renewed old friendships, while Mrs.
Harry Rosenthal and Mrs. Rupert Boyd and
a brown-clad Dix girl were other notable visi-
tors from Melbourne. Mrs. D’Arcy Johnson
picked winners with monotonous regular-
ity ; Mrs. Colin Stephen turned on interest-
ing frocking of navy appliqued in yellows and
greens. Two dames of distinction were the
Hughes and Denison ladies; and of the
<4,000 present, one was the heroine who
retired to a seat apart from the throng, there
to remove her smart and smarting white-
topped boots.
In Monday’s sunshine muslins and silks
sind wide-brimmed hats flashed out with a
last-rose-of-summer effect. Elaine de Chair
ruffled out in pink embroidererd muslins and
a shady white hat, her vice-regal mother
wearing sand-colored- maroeains draped with
lace. Lady Forster's droopy black hat blos-
somed into one prize yellow rose on its brim ;
Mrs. Pitt Rivers clothed herself in amethyst-
ine silk, and wore a perfect lit in black satin
liats. Commander Grant’s wife sheathed
her blondness in the severity of black; and
a ravishing three-piece of navy served with
oyster emphasised the classic charm of Mrs.
\ ivers. Rita Buckland was another pretty
creature—her small hat was tied under the
chin, and wore a gay red feather on its
right side.
AH the roads of N. S. Wales lead to the
►Show at Easter. Pigs, pumpkins, wood-
chopping, riding—these and the thousand and
two other sections of the grand whole claim
ti.eir out-back audiences, while town cousin
goes in hordes to marvel afresh at the rich
outpourings of the fruits of the earth and to
grouch again over the outrageous prices he
Pays his greengrocer. The Hall of Agricul-
ture is a steaming censer to the gods of crops
and docks. Butter and cheeses, honey and
preserves, apples and paw-paws, grapes, nuts
and wine are there in curves of plenty wink-
ing the eye of invitation to the eye of desire.
On Wednesday, after the orders of pre-
cedence had been arranged by the judges and
the rank of tne prize oxen and sheep and
horses had been clearly defined and duly re-
corded in Debrett. the stock aristocrats took
the ring before the stands, and there, pacing
in more or less ruminative majesty, they
awaited the arrival of the State Ex., who
was to declare the Show open. Which same
he did at half-past three, his speech and like-
wise that of the Show’s president, S'Sam
Hordern, being broadcasted over the grounds.
In past years the opening incantations were
made from the stands, so that the vice-regal
gratification seemed addressed to the unheed-
ing herds within the ring. This year a plat-
form. tented in white and red, had been
built with its back to the ring, so that the
Mark Antony orations were thrown into
the very teeth of the stands.
Scattered within the A T ice-regal horizon
were the Governor-General, Priminister
Bruce arid State Premier George Fuller.
Lady de Chair and the Fuller dame sup-
ported their lords, the former in a terra-cotta
sartorial scheme carried out in sleeky maro-
cains, a high-crowned hat in the same tone
but of mirror-like satin finishing the Pom-
peiian design. She wore no wrap, but de-
pended on the famous pearls for neck
warmth. The Premier’s lady from head to
heel suggested a pastel in grey. President
Hordern’s lady softened black maroeains
with an ermine collar in which afj white gar-
denia snuggled; Chief Justice Street’s wife
tried to look as cool as she looked pleased
above sleek peltry; and youth on the plat-
form was represented by Elaine de Chair
and Doreen Hordern.
A thrill of the Show was the exhibit of
cotton, a tray from Grafton being displayed
as the ideal to which growers should strive.
Cotton plantations will mean so much in
the musical as well as the industrial life of
Australia. Think of the unexploited field
in Australian plantation songs ! Future ages
may hang rapt while high-priced vocalists
pour out the Clarence equivalent of the
“Swanee River.” Another wave was put
in the spine by a demonstration of beer-
making—so simple a child could do it. Aus-
tralia surely will be there and need fear
no Hammond. This Letter, too, had always
thought of Italy as producing only Galli-
Curcis, spaghetti, stilettos and fruit-sellers,
but was interested to meet (not too closely)
some dark-complexioned bees —re-incarna-
tions, no doubt, of those that helped to
sweeten the breakfast of Horace and of
Homer, maybe even of Nero.
Imagine a blend of “Aida” and “Land of
Hope and Glory” (with organ accompani-
ment) expressed in raiment-, and you have
Elsa Stralia’s lacquer red, gold-encrusted
robe at her opening concert on Easter Satur-
day. It was the outpouring in fabric of the
drums and the trumpets and the marching
banners in her voice. The clarion call of
that attire and the great voice shook the
audience like a mighty wind, and what with
the forest of gum-leaves that sparkled on the
stage, and so many bouquets and floral
baskets, and canaries, baskets gay with fruit
and foliage, and a ladder of fame with
“Stralia” on the topmost rung (that, was
from Galli-Curci) and a hurricane of
applause, Elsa Stralia knew she was home
again. Joyous little Bessie Griffiths, in her
quaint frock of old-gold satin (suggestive
of one of grandmother’s daguerrotypes),
had an ovation that included the "spoils
of many a garden plot. Mother, sister Mrs.
Swinson and nephew Ryder were eager
listeners to her golden notes. Two vice-reines
graced the front chairs; the G.-G.’s lady
softly pretty in the gentle blues she so
affects, and the State Ex. wearing her hair
in a different and very beooming w r ay above
amber richness. With her were son Somer-
set and daughter Elaine. But neither the
Governor-General nor the State Governor
put in an appearance. Truth to tell, Sir
Dudley doesn’t go to many musical feasts.
Having lived so much on the high seas, per-
haps it bores him to have them sung at him.
The sparkling Galli-Curci dazzled the eye
with at least three concert frocks that have
got the singing girl from Ashfield beaten.
One was a Chinese effect- in black and gold,
its main structure a straight tunic of gold
tissue. Upon this, above the knees, was
superimposed a suddenly flaring lampshade
flounce that extended from side to side, and
from which dangled a vallance-like effect of
black Spanish lace. The frock was short
(that the singer’s legs are perfect from the
knee downwards all concert-goers know) and
practically backless, although from shoulder
to shoulder gold tulle was looped loosely,
falling below the hem of the frock like a
golden cascade. With this was worn a high
black comb in the sleeked black hair, a rope
of pearls and a diamond pendant like a
lustre and the lady’s favorite gold footwear.
Another creation was of shot gold and green
tissue brocaded in an old-fashioned chintz
design, the roses patterned on the rich fabric
pink outlined in gold. This was made with
a modernised watteau bodice and a skirt
hooped over an underskirt of gold lace and
, flowing from the hooped sides into a train
long and circular. Iridescent shoulder-straps
in purples and greens moored the outburst,
while below the beautiful bare shoulders fell
» dong straight streamer of turquoise blue
ribbon scintillating with a design of the
purple-green iridescence down the middle of
the train. The whole was very French, and
suggested at once Chopin, Versailles and
Watteau. Add to this a high pink coral
comb in her hair,, a perfect rain of diamonds
and pearls with suddenly wakened emeralds
in between, and you have a faint idea of
the. blazing whole. Another night the prima
donna tripped on looking like a front-liner
in a tropic-bird ballet —all flamingo pink
tulle that waved and curled with the sug-
gestion of feather fronds. This she topped
with a comb of red lacquer and finished off
with silver shins and shoes.
One wonders if Lady Emily Lutyens, the
visiting Theosophist from India, where her
brother is Governor of Bengal, had borne
an Irish name how the Feminist Club would
have received her. Frocked in blue brocades
and shod in gold tissue, the lady in the gentle
monotones of the quietly obstinate passed
out some frank reprimands over the attitude
of the white races to Colored Brother, unde-
terred by the fact that Henry Braddon, of
the English-speaking Union, was on the
platform. Color prejudice must be over-
come, declared the lady, or else the building
up of an empire of the dark-skinned as
opposed to that of the white must ensue. The
speaker, who had sandwiched this address
in between two relays of the big Theosophist
reception at the Adyar Hall, floated off the
minute her futile and unconvincing speech
was over, or one wondered what the Digger
architect who had gone to the lecture be-
cause he had read so many of her husband’s
books on his craft might have been .tempted
to say.
The Women and Children’s Hospital ex-
pects to have a big moving in June, when
lock, stock and barrel it will go to Clyde
House. Larger premises are wanted for a
roll of patients that grows steadily: Dr.
Lucy Gullet, its secretary, revealed at the
third annual meeting the other day that it has
ministered to over 25,000 patients. Funds,
of course, are needed, and any reasonable
offer to furnish rooms in the new building
will not be refused. The gathering rallied
in the assembly room of the Feminist Club,
where Lady de Chair, who presided, had
much to say in praise of the women doctors’
venture, inasmuch as it sets its face towards
the prevention of disease as bravely as to its
cure. The theme was enlarged upon by
medicine-women Constance Darcy and Har-
riet Biffin, and was embroidered by Billy
Hughes’s lady, Robert Anderson and Ruby
Rich.
Nearly all Who’s Who motored from
Randwick to Edgecliff to drink a dish of tea
at the Kelso King at-home at Quambi after
Saturday’s meeting. The rooms looked as
though the official stand had been emptied
into them, though for many it was mostly a
walk-in-walk-out party owing to the Easter
crop of dinner-dances and theatres. The
reception rooms blossomed like the Valley of
Sharon, and blooms of late summer and
autumn spilled beauty everywhere. The
hostess played her part in black ehantillv
filming rosy silks, wdth a hat of black laee on
which a large lace bow was wired to attention.
There was a sound of revelry by night
that nearly raised the roof of the Padding-
ton Town Hall on Easter Monday. It was
caused by the Town and Country Matrons
celebrating their 16th annual jol'lo. This
ball is one of the big Easter fixtures, and the
scheme of decoration is always a work of
art. This year the pastel tones of prim-
rose and wistaria veiled walls and lights
with nebulous beauty.
One of the big flutters of last week was
the musicale hostessed by the Denison dame'
at the Royal Colonial Institute. No. 17
Bligh-street, since it has become the Insti-
tute’s habitat, has quite the air of one who.
having had reverses, smiles and sups with For-
tune. Now r do knights palely loitering adorn
its passages and crevices while their ladies
camp firmly on whatsoever chairs they are
lucky enough to seize. Large though the big
reception-room at the head of the stairs, the
popularity of the Institute's parties is still
greater, and last week's choero was as happy
and as squashy as ever. Against a back-
ground of scarlet dahlias Hugh Denison's
lady went through the welcoming ritual robed
in mellow ivory lace and a high-crowned hat
of amber hue. Visiting knight Frederick
Dutton and his lady, the equally knightly
Dorman couple and bridge-builder Hugh Bell
were among the guests of honor. Songbird
Stralia, very purry in black satin and fur.
and the new opal came along and had their
advertisement. With Stralia was ’cellist
Bessie Griffiths, who was also handed a posy
to dimple over. Virginia Bassetti enriched
the afternoon with her golden contralto, and
tenor G. P. Wilkinson breathed Ben .Tonson’s
beautiful old “Drink to Me Only with Thine
Eyes” into an atmosphere heavy with the
scent of the tea-leaf.
The cabled news of Mrs. Justin Pargiter's
death (she was Girlie Toohey) at Cape-
town last week came as a terrific shock to
a big circle of Australian friends. Just 211.
Girlie went last year to S'Africa to marry
young Captain Pargiter, whom she had first
met when he was in Australia visiting the
Kidman family. This Letter remembers see-
ing her at some of her farewell parties look-
ing as much like a posy as any of those
thrust on her. She was talented, too, and
had a voice that her Italian singing teacher
declared would have meant a career.
Two well-known Sydney women, Mrs.
Neville Maymau and the wife of solicitor
Gerald Barry, were mourned for last week.
Mrs. Mayman died in England and leaves
a husband and daughter Phyllis. Mrs. Barry
was the mother of clever juvenile lead Roger
Barry and three other sons, Hubert.
Francis and Redmond, and two daughters,
one of whom is Mrs. Stef. McDonald.
Easter Monday saw the wedding blos-
soms of Jean Stark, a Rose Bay girl
who gave her hand in St. James’s
to a happy Queenslander, James Cleeve.
The bridal finery was a shimmer of
ivory charmeuse with a train of silver cloth.
Touches of dawn pink foamed in tiny frills
under the silver tissue; and a cloud of white
tulle was caught in a bandeau of orange
buds and silver leaves over a pretty shingled
head. Nancy Stark, Heather Stark and a
Brisbane girl, Nancy Fowler, were attendant
’maids in rose and gold.
Sister Brisbane's symposium :
His Ex. is in the wilds of Thargomindah, enjoying
those glimpses of Real Bush which his own soul —-not
his vice-regal one-—cries for. He stayed with the
Eastmans at Wcelamurra, and came into Cunnamtilla
to be presented, among other things, with a gold
pencil by a pupil of the local State school.
Judge Jimmy Blair had a big send-off at the
Commercial Hotel, Rockhampton, and an inscribed
silver cigarette-case formed part of the proceedings.
He comes south to Brisbane.
Harry Lauder passed oti the Tango Mam, bound
for the rooftree of Donald Macdonald, of Maoriland.
who lost his only son in the Big War. The comedian
lias nothing on his mind at present but fushin’.
With his lady he has been casting an eye on the
Philippines, India, China, Burmah and Singapore.
C. Stewart brought the pair a basket of Brisbane's
best blossomry and took them for a motor spin.
Mary Macgregor paid her respects to her delighted
parents in Bowen-terrace on her way to Adelaide to
join Muriel Starr and Frank Harvey. She will rei
peat her success as Jill in “The Skin Game,” and
return to Brisbane with Thurston Hall in “The
Broken Wing.”
Mr. Guy, of Higbgate Hill, did a remarkable stunt
with his car this week. Going up the incline of
Gladstone-road his engine ceased fire, and the motor
began to back, went through a. two-rail fence,
knocked down another slab fence, turned two
somersaults and settled down in a private yard after
an 80-foot descent. The driver was a lucky Guy.
and came out with a few bruises, though the wind
screen and hood of the excitable vehicle were badly
bashed.
Fate has played a dirty trick on Tom James, once
of the 9th Battalion. His war wounds worried him.
and his son, a strapping young Queenslander of 21,
brought him from Charlevillc and put him into
Rosemount Hospital. One afternoon, while visiting
bis Digger dad, the boy was stricken with illness.
He was taken to the General Hospital and operated
cn, but, after lingering a few days, crossed the
Divide. The day before, the Rosemount authori-
ties, knowing the case was hopeless, arranged with
the Brisbane ambulance to convey Tom James to his
son’s bedside.
“Campanui,” the big annual round of festivities--
races, balls, etc.—-that draws south-western Queens-
land to Roma, has just had its innings. Campanui
(it’s the name of a creek on Bellevue station, HI
miles from Roma) is the biggest squatter-selector
turnout South-Western Queensland knows, and its
social events glisten with a naturalness and a hilarity
that challenge Richmond’s “Green-hide brigade”
shivoos at their best.
Sandgate held - carnival during Easter. The first
schoolmaster the seaside village boasted has lived
there for 52 years. He is W. R. Barfoot. and hr
still lives, at 91 years, in the home he built him-
self. He remembers when the only council em-
ployee was a man with a wheelbarrow.
Pastoralist J. D. Taylor, of Auckland Downs, is
among those who are steaming nor’ bv west on flic
Marella. This is the first lap of his round-the-
world Marathon, while brother Bob remains at home
to gather in the partnership’s golden fleece.

The heavenly clerk of the weather gave
us a good Easter, and even the most prosaic
were drawn to answer the call of the open-
air, and to sit in the Gardens in the warm
sunshine among the falling leaves of the elm-
trees, knowing it was autumn, but dreaming
it was spring. Good Friday and Easter
Saturday saw crowds of holidaying folk
streaming in and out of Flinders-street
station, or packing their luncheon into
the huge touring motor-cars which stood
moored in fleets waiting to carry Melbourne
off to the hills or the sea.
“Primrose” blossomed for the first time
at His Majesty’s on Saturday night. Frock-
ing runs the gamut of periods from Empire
to the most modern of sporting attire. The
latter opens the musical comedy; hosts of
maidens in rowing, tennis, golf and sporting
rig invade the stage, and ping-pong balls
rain on the stalls from racquet and club.
Memory carries away striped and checked
skirts, some blue sleeveless jackets and vivid
green avool tarns against a background of
Lenglen hair-bands, sports hats and quaint
Chinese headgear. Wanders in Maud Fane,
very slim, listless and with less voice than
of "yore, clothed in the sweetest thing in
mauve one-pieces, with buttons and slots of
cerise hue with helmet-shaped millinery of
the two hues. Equally attractive is a frock
of white satin with silver buttons climbing
over one shoulder from hem to hem, back and
forth.
The Playlovers’ Club staged an at-home at
the Lyceum Club one night recently, when
Eily Malyon, shingled and slim, in beaded
black gown of knee-length, with white camel-
lias poised upon one shoulder, read in attrac-
tive tones Singe’s “The Shadow of the
Glen” ; and Mrs. Davidson, whose bunch of
delphiniums had a nice background of
glistening white frock, talked entertainingly
of the Irish playwright. President Mrs. Jas.
P»ootli, who stood up in rust-hued silk with
a presentation posy of dahlias in her hand,
explained to the uninitiated the difference
between the Playlovers and other mumming
clubs. Playlovers read and discuss plays
while other folk play them —and there you
are! So players and readers should be the
best of friends. Professor Scutt arose with
a sheaf of notes to strum the purely educa-
tional guitar; whereupon the audience
mostly assumed a bored look. Apparently
knowledge must be neatly disguised to make
it acceptable to those who are willing _to
learn, but don’t like to think they are being
taught. Especially must University pro-
fessors disguise themselves on such occasions.
If, for instance, this learned gentleman had
been introduced as the manicurist of Wirths
elephants, all ears would have been opened
to his dreadful disclosures.
There was no odor of petrol but plenty of
musical clamor at the Women’s Automobile
Club’s fortnightly at-home. President Mrs.
H. J. Robertson brightened a sapphire-blue
frock with touches of cherry allied to flower-
decked millinery. Black satin and georgette
and black hat pranked with magenta covered
Mrs. Kroef (known to Sydneyites as Floresca
Warren prior to matrimony), who displayed
some fine contralto notes in song; and the
Russian Madame Kassovskaia, who has a
fine war record in her own land, was heard
in Alfred Hill’s “Maori Lament,” and a wild
national ditty. Elspetli Dunstan used facile
fingers on the keyboard. Founded in August,
1918, by Mrs. T. E. Lambert, with Lady
Helen Munro Ferguson as patroness, this
club started a career of usefulness by taking
hospital patients and soldiers from convales-
cent homes for regular jaunts. When Eddy
of Windsor came here in the Renown, the
Auto, ladies used their energies and their
waggons to give the sailors a good time, and
the then president has as memento the only
White Ensign left in Australia from the big
battleship. Regular trips are run for the
Adult Blind from the Brighton Home and
for patients at the Children’s Hospital. In
between times clothes are made for the
Foundling Hospital, and members always do
their bit in street appeals, so the Women’s
Automobile Club is not the glorious joy-ride
the name suggests. Membership has increased
of late to keep secretary Miss Stewart and
Mrs. W. A. Troedel, whose duties are hono-
rary, quite busy.
Stay-at-homes are finding some consola-
tion. Several big stores are giving patrons
a few happy days of a special Easter sale.
Winter frocks and wraps are marked at
most alluring prices, and the pruning runs
even unto model gowns. It is a rare week
for bargain hunters, and, though insidious,
is still a shade less risky than Randwick.
Delightful French chansons, old and new,
were introduced by Mrs. Alberto Zelman at
a recital at the Queen’s Hall. Ravel, De-
bussy, Saint Saens, Fourdrain and other less
known composers of France were repre-
sented. The mezzo-soprano, who shines in
this class qf work, sang interestingly and
artistically, frocked in cosmos pink, criss-
crossed in beading of white and petunia-hued
crystal. Violin solos by husband Alberto
made very acceptable offerings. The Queen’s
Hall has an intimate atmosphere with its
wee proscenium, suggestive of a Louis
Quinze bedstead—it would make a lovely
setting for a mannequin, lingerie parade. A
full house greeted the artists.
A veil of rare old Limerick lace over
draperies and train of gold-embroidered
white satin framed Vera McLeod, younger
daughter of Mrs. D. McLeod, of South
Yarra, when she became Mrs. Alyn Sewell
at Scots’ Church last, week, in a setting of
palms. The two bridesmaids, Dulce McLeod
and Katie Campbell, laughed at the fates in
frocks of almond green georgette and satin,
with swathed headpieces of gold tissue and
sheaves of pink blossoms and autumn foliage.
Alan Rankin, of Bendigo, best-manned ; and
the guests adjourned to No. 9 Darling-street
for the wedding meats.
Another theatrical combination has come
into being here—Musical Productions Pty.,
Ltd., in which Kitty Reidy and Kenneth
Duffield are associated. The latter, who
hails from Soustralia, after war service in
the A.I.F. collaborated with Dion Tither-
adge in musical revue productions in the
Great Smoke. A successful effort of those
days, “Snap,” is to be the new co.’s intro-
duction at the Palace on May 23. If sup-
porting talent is worthy of the vocal and
histi’ionic achievements of the leads, Kitty
Reidy and Howett Worster, there shouldn’t
be much lacking in the show.
The stage of the Athenaeum never framed
a more delightful picture than it did when
the pupils of the Catholic Ladies’ College
held their annual speecher, and Archbishop
Mannix passed over the rewards and fairy-
books. White frocks were picturesquely
adorned with Celtic cloaks of ivory, faced
with the golden colors of the school, and
gloved hands clapped a welcome which was
also au rcvoir to the Archbish., who leads
the Aussie pilgrimage to Lourdes and the
Holy Year celebrations. “The Snow”
chorus was so tunefully harmonised that
there was no chill left therein, and “The
Blue Danube” set feet of a former genera-
tion softly tapping, so that a crowded house
cried “Again!” A bevy of fiddlers invaded
the orchestral well, and played with vim
under Gertrude Healy’s baton, and a Shaks-
pearean selection and Grecian movements
were among the young folks’ other efforts.
The charming lady of this picture used to
be known to 11s as May Griffiths, a brilliant
accompanist whose reputation stretched
from Victoria
to the Apple
land. Some
eight years
ago she be-
came Madame
Jahnke, and
went to Swe-
den, where the
winter is eight
months long
and the sun
works overtime
i n summer to
catch up, top-
pling over the
aorizon about
midnight, and
bobbing up
igain an hour
or less later.
‘You never
want to go to
bed in summer
there,” says
Madame Julinke, who lias come back to
Melbourne to visit her parents, and is being
feted and tea-ed by crowds of friends.
Mrs. Henry Butler, who set out on the
European liaj by the Oronsay, had a fare-
well tea-drinking at Melbourne’s smartest
chattery, the Alexandra. The hostess
dressed the part in harmonies of Copen-
hagen blue and dove grey, and introduced
son Geoffrey’s bride in bronze crepe-meteor
with millinery a third below. Lyn Butler,
just arrived from a tour abroad, came in
for the glad hand of welcome; she was
in the latest of Continental modes in black
satin, with an embroidered floral design,
and her black corded silk hat was of the
simplicity that leaves a hole in the banking
account. The lately-arrived violinist, Sar-
coli, and Lorna Reid, the songs-at-the-piano
girl, entertained between the chat and the
tea.
A prominent prohibitionist lady, who was
apt to accept the suggestion of drinking
habits against anyone who met trouble, has
had an experience which will give her a
kindlier outlook. She has been developing
a weak heart; and as she came out of a
big Bourke-street shop one day recently
the world seemed to spin around, and des-
perately she clutched at a post and iung
there. In the dimness of the reeling world
she saw mistily the face of the gentleman
who, in the politest way possible, helped her
into the taxi. But he was unable to let her
go without some expression of his feeling.
“This is terrible, ma’am!” he said, “it is
simply shocking to see a respectable-looking
person like yourself in this condition.

Much pasture was represented at the
Scots’ Kirk wedding of Lulu Adare Taylor,
eldest daughter of the Taylors of Bootra,
which lies out in the mujga, and Herbert
Frederick Durant, of Camberwell. Ivory
silk crepe, panelled with golden wheat
stooks, adorned the bride. Cousin Aileen.
Taylor, of Overnewton, ’maided in foxglove-
hued crSpe romaine, with veil of tulle and a
pink posy. Gerald Parker aided the bride-
groom. Bride’s mother, in black with a
girdle of crystal and jet, beckoned the re-
joicers into the Quamby Club. The ’moon
arose over Sydney’s Eastertide.
The Melbourne Rotarians, having dis-
covered that the Boy Scouts movement is in
its aims a brother belonga them, have de-
cided to give the followers of Baden Powell
—Rotarians of the future —a helping hand.
By means of a Boy Scouts’ Week, opening on
May 2, and god-parented by the Club, an
endeavor will be made to rake in £lO,OOO to
endow the headquarters of the association
and also enlist workers for the cause. The
appeal is State-wide, and country centres
will hold a seven days’ rejoicing simulta-
nously.
The English-speaking Union gathered a
varied and more or less distinguished com-
pany at its headquarters at Scott’s last week.
Contralto Essie Ackland was the only petti-
coated guest of honor; she was bracketed
with Dr. Rendall, headmaster of England’s
classy public school of Winchester, Dust
home Donald Mackinnon and Dr. Devine,
and divers visitors from overseas. Since
moving into its new club rooms the union
has accumulated many followers.
Eileen Castles is doing something for the
dependants of those who were killed in the
dreadful motor smash at Highett lately.
A full house at a concert in the Exhibition
is her first objective. She has a rare galaxy
for her programme and trusts to the public
to do the rest. Last week the popular song-
bird was star artist of a concert at Heales-
ville.
After a long period of mourning, Mrs.
Walter Dalrymple is again hostessing the
much missed social re-unions at her Toorak
home with the music-room which is a joy
to visiting musicians. Assisted by daughter
Molly, the popular chatelaine extended the
glad hand to many guests to say “Come
back soon” to Mrs. Bates Post. Walter
Kirby raised his tenor notes in artistic lays
and joined the guest of honor in other offer-
ings.
A proud man was Col. Bourchier, our
Minister for Agriculture, when his son
married a daughter of the late Frank Mad-
den, Speaker in the State Assembly from
1904 till 1917. When the Commonwealth
appointed Howse, Y.C., as head of its
American Fleet reception committee. Vic.
thought it was up to it in picking the head
of its group to match him as nearly as pos-
sible. So it hit on Bourchier, who trails
D.S.O. and C.M.G. after his name in respect
of his Light Horse work in Palestine.
Hilda Samsing, late manageress of the
Government Chalet at Mount Buffalo, the
rival as a winter resort of Kosciusko, has
formed a Melbourne company to construct
another winter playground at Mount
Feathertop—Feathertop, 6306 ft., is the high-
est peak in the Australian Alps. The idea
is to create an Australian St. Moritz, where
skating, ski-ing, toboganning and other
break-neck pastimes can go on for six months
in the year. Miss Samsing is in Switzerland
gathering champion skaters and informa-
tion. Meantime the Railway Department is
spending another £20,000 on its Buffalo
Hotel.
An Arctic-edged wind did not prevent a
full house for the usual “monthly” of the
Friendly Union of Soldiers' Wives and
Mothers at the Oddfellows’ Hall. Lady For-
ster, in a navy suit and furs, topped by a
broad-leafed chapeau, had some happy re-
marks to make, and invited bereaved mothers
and widows of soldiers to the memorial ser-
vice at Federal Government House on Anzac
Day. Mrs. Victor Selllieim had gathered
Doris Pritchard, Iris Roderick, Kathleen
.Howard and John Hughes to entertain the
party. And, of course, there was tea.
The Orousay took off to other lands one
of Melbourne's smartest hostesses, Mrs.
Charlie Lyon, who gave a farewell tea at
the Quamby. A rise in temperature allowed
summer finery to be worn, an all-white turn-
out featuring knife-pleats and bead em-
broidery being the principal lady's choice.
Her mother, Airs. Dodds, chose black dra-
peries and velour millinery, and sister Mrs.
Gordon Langridge was similarly hung.
Guests included the Dalrymples, from Gis-
borne. Airs, de Bavay, Mrs. Colin Fraser
and Joan Chirnsidc.
Mrs. Carty Salmon, just back from the
other side, spent two years in England see-
ing a son through the end of his Oxford
course; and she left him busy in that most
crowded and palpitating London hospital,
Barts. The daughter of Sydney's one-time
Mayor Matthew Harris maintains the
blooming complexion of her girlhood, and is
mighty glad to get away from the Wembley
deluge-summer, which was followed by a
winter only second to the one Noah’s house-
boat weathered.
Alembers of the Austral Salon stirred fare-
well cups with Airs. R. Simmons, Airs.
Deague and Airs. Freame before they em-
barked on the Oronsay for foreign ports.
Secretary Airs. Quinnell fired the parting
shots, and handed the latest in floral arrange-
ments to the voyagers. Alusic was well
served by Dulcie Cherry, Gertrude Hutton.
Rene Alorrissy, Isobel Langlands and Thomas
Bevans.
Anzac Day this year will be the last
the popular G.-G. will celebrate with us:
lie will deliver an address at the memorial
service at the Exhibition. The sales of a
specially struck button inscribed with
“Triumph, Sacrifice” and “Lest We Forget"
upon a rising sun, surrounded with a laurel
wreath, will add to the funds of the Anzac
House appeal.
It has often been said that Black Brother
of Australia can’t be educated in the ordinary
sense of the term. To prove that he can
be. James Noble, a member of the Yarrabah
tribe < Q.), who has been engaged in work
of the Anglican missions for the past 30
years, has come to Alelbourne to speak at
the coming church congress. He is convinced
from personal experience that, given educa-
tion and training, Black Brother would be-
come a valuable asset.
Adelaide notes: —
The polo gymkhana was mostly an affair of
umbrellas and hasty contests, but the programme
was put through and the Governor came down to
hand over prizes and trophies, and throw out a
suggestion that India was not too far away for an
Australian polo team to try its luck there. Mary
Mann (first in both the flag and barrel and
the polo-ball race), Phyllis Bray, Miss Bell and
Miss Sandison were the feminine winners.
Sunday saw the unveiling of the Light Horse
memorial, a granite obelisk standing at the comer
of the East Park lands, with the Governor to do
the unveiling, and the committee’s chairman, Dr.
Duguid, and the hard-working secretary, Mrs.
Roach, as the other speakers. The cost is about
£l2OO, almost all of which has been raised in
small sums. The Tubercular Soldiers’ Appeal, by
the way, has passed the £2700 mark, with more to
come.
The Elder Conservatorium can plume itself Oil
the first heat of its 1925 concert season —the pro-
gramme all Oesar Franck, with a prologue from
Dr. Davies: Olive Carey as the soloist; Charles
Schilsky, Kathleen Meegan, Sylvia Whitington and
Harold Parsons the instrumentalists; and Maude
Puddv at the piano. The thing was excellently
done, and had already established a record by being
given at Government House a few nights before.
His Ex., who has gone by train to the West, where
he will pick up the mailboat for England, couldn t
be at the concert, and wanted a chance of hearing
the programme. Hence the “command” perform-
ance, followed by a little dinner to the band.
A three days’ inferno of east wind and dust gave
way to rain on the night of the polo supper-dance.
The Sydney Show had called home some of the visitors
from the other side, but there were 200 or so
guests at the Osborne Hall, which was hung with
rainbow streamers of the various clubs’ colors broken
by great emerald, scarlet and gold bunches of bal-
loons. Red roses, that by some miracle had survived
the tornado of grit, and maidenhair were on the
supper tables.
A dinner-dance at the Pier, Glenelg, with poloists
and their feminine belongings as the chief revellers,
was another gymkhana frivol. Indeed, about the only
thing that hasn’t been polo-ish for the last fort-
night was a linen tea for Jean Nicholls, whose mar-
riage is booked for the end of the month. The
hostess was Miss Betty Ann Hill, and there were
gifts of linen, exquisite and practical, to water the
mouth of any bride-to-be.

NOTIONS
Drenching showers fell in Sydney on
Friday and Saturday broke cloudy; in fact, heavy
clouds hung about all day. But the Government
Meteorologist, a much better prophet than any of
the professional racing tipsters, was confident that
J. Pluvius would inconvenience no one for the rest
of Easter, and so it proved. An old stager in Palbi
(fi’s) won the First Hurdle, in which six
of the 12 starters fell (two turned up their
toes), and four jockeys were hurt, though
not dangerously. Few would object if the
A.J.C. wiped jumping events off its programmes.
This melancholy business over, punters struggled with
the problem set them by the Holt (Vic.) stable in
the w.f.a Autumn Stakes, 12 furlongs, in which
Heroic, racing in G. B. Kellow’s colors, and Lilypond,
in Thomas Foy’s, were among the seven starters.
Lilypond was firm at 7 to 2, while Heroic eased from
•'> to 4 to 7 to 4 ; Te Kara and Virgin Gold were also
in the market at 6’s. Heroic struck some observers
as being a bit short of work, but he is built on more
robust lines than most Australian thoroughbreds, and
his round barrel is deceptive. The event proved that
there was nothing wrong with him, for after poor
old David had made the pace for five furlongs or
so, Heroic took command and was never afterwards
headed, being a length and a half in front of
Virgin Gold when Harrison, who took no chances,
dropped his hands. Nothing finished better than
Polycletan, who was three-quarters of a length behind
Virgin Gold, after having been a good way back.
Lilypond, who was second into the straight, failed
to come on, and finished an indifferent fifth, behind
Te Kara —a poor exhibition for a Cup favorite.
The race was run in 2min. 36-Jsec., which, on top of
the slow time registered by the hurdlers (their.two
miles occupied 3min. 491 see., whereas the course
record is 3min. 38jjseo), showed that the going
was a bit dead.
After the Liverpool Handicap at Warwick Farm
Brimming ruled as favorite for the Doncaster,
Wren’s moijey being chiefly responsible. But the
public preferred Lausanne, particularly as he had
galloped pretty well on the Thursday after having
been under the vet.’s care for a swollen limb; and
at barrier-rise it was 9 to 2 Lausanne, s’s Brim-
mmg, io’s Golden Voice, 12’s Encre and Whittier,
16’s The Hawk, Valiant, Mountain Song and Royal
Dighton, 20’s Fuji San and All Sunshine, and 25
to 109 to 1 the other ten. The Hawk jumped out
first, but Golden Voice was soon in front, and with
Encre and Whittier chasing him, and Lausanne,
Valiant, Brimming, Fuji San and King Cyllene all
prominent, led to the home turn. Brimming’? white
jacket was conspicuous on the outside once in the
straight, but she socn faded out of the picture, as
did Encre, Whittier and Golden Voice, and a furlong
from home Fuji San, King Cyllene and Valiant were
out by themselves. Valiant looked dangerous for a
L’w. strides, but the distance found him out. and
Fuji San, outstaying the 100-to-l chance, King Cyl-
lene, who was momentarily in the lead, landed the
£3038 stake for his Victorian owner, ,T. P. Arthur,
by three parts of a length. All Sunshine, who came fast
from the ruck and cut his stable-companion. Valiant,
out of third place, was two lengths behind King
Cyllene, whose tote backers received £6 7s. 6d. for
every 10s. risked; and after a gap followed Vala-
mita, Lausanne, Whittier and The Hawk, with
Golden Voice last. Fuji San is a three-year-old
bay gelding by Valais from Lady San, whose dam was
Lady Mostyn, a Maribyrnong Plate winner; and
C. Hodson trains him in Victoria. He was a bad
horse for the public, although a few backed him
because Harrison had the mount, for his recent form
had been discouraging, although Ids two-year-old
performances were good. Oddly enough, in his wind-
ing-up gallop he beat All Sunshin? by three lengths,
with Valiant just shaded by his stable-mate. Some
of the Randwick watchers concluded that All Sun-
shine and Valiant were under wraps, but as far as
the trio were concerned the race was almost an
exact repetition of the gallop.
Although MeShortodds was having an excellent
day he demanded 2 to 1 Spearfelt for the St. Leger
—yet another argument for a straightout tote. Wind-*
bag was at 4 to 1 (7 to 2 in places), Meenah, who
looked a bit light on it, weakened from 4’s to s’s,
and certain licensed bushrangers had Solidify at
10’s, 16’s and 20’s being obtainable in other quar-
ters. Lord Merle, the outsider of the party, set a
slow* pace—much too slow to suit Spearfelt—and
entered the straight, with Meenah alongside him and
Windbag and Spearfelt behind them, the latter being-
on the rails. At the distance Windbag had every-
thing settled bar the favorite, whom Lewis had had
to bring up on the outside. Spearfelt drew level
with Windbag, and momentarily headed him, but the
Magpie-Charleville colt, magnificently ridden by
Munro. came again and got the better of a thrilling
struggle by half a head, with Meenah and Solidifv
following at intervals of three lengths; time, 3min.
8-'}sec. Windbag is owned by Robert Miller and
trained at Randwick by G. Price. Not much to look
at, lie was rather a joke among Randwick trainers
when first introduced to the tracks, but he has come
good with a vengeance in the last six months.
Lewis’s handling of Spearfelt was not up to his old
standard. Munro indisputably rode a much more
vigorous finish. All the same, there was general
sympathy for the veteran when the stewards sus-
pended him for three months at the end of the
day, deciding that his mount, Petunia, had crossed
a bunch too suddenly in the Sires’ Produce Stakes
and interfered with Vaals. That particular race
went to Los Gatos (7’s), a Maoriland-bred filly bv
Absurd-Los Vegas, another Absurd filly in Poetaster
and a Tressady filly in Yule Cake following her
home. Manfred, the G-to-4 favorite, -was left at the
post. So was Heroic a year ago, but Manfred is
not likely to be another Heroic. Thus far the two-
year-olds seem rather a poor lot.
Remembering, possibly, what happened to Stand
B.V and Mirthmaker last year, the owners of only
nine horses paid acceptance fees for the Tocal Handi-
cap, 12 furlongs. However, six of the nine were
backed —-Wallace Mortlake at 2’s, Valwyne at 4’s,
Kingslot at 9 to 2 and s’s, Gungool and Lady
Valais at B’s. and Royal Roue- (by the stable prin-
cipally) at 12's. Dialogue, about whom 20’s and 25’s
were obtainable, made all the running, and nearly
snatched a victory. At the distance he was fighting
it out with Wallace
Mortlake when Don-
nelly, on Royal Rou6,
forced a passage be-
tween the two leaders
and got there by a
head, the same dis-
tance separating Wal-
lace Mortlake and Dia-
logue. It was a good
performance on the
Gadabout gelding’s
part, for he lost his
position at one stage
when running second
to Dialogue and had
to make up a lot of
ground. The time was
2min. 36Jsec.
-J. HOLT , trainer
of Heroic, Lily-
pond and Metellus.
The Sydney Cup was run in ideal autumn weather
and a great crowd witnessed it—Bo,ooo, it is esti-
mated, as against 74,000 on Saturday and 73,000
when Scarlet won. Polydetan, who was receiving
161 b. from Lilypond, whereas he gave the Westralian
31b. and a beating in the Autumn Stakes, was a
firm favorite at 4 to 1, but there was boodle for
Lilypond in big parcels, and he finished at 14’s.
There was even more for Spearfelt, who firmed from
16’s to 6’s. Wallace Mortlake was at 10’s, Wallarak
at 14’s, Virgin Gold at 16’s, Windbag a point longer,
and the others, 16 in number, ranged from 20’s to
100’s, that price being quoted in one or two places
about Solidify. They left the barrier almost in line,
but only a furlong or so had been traversed when
Kingslot fell and brought down Prince Minimbah,
Spearfelt, Wallarak, Backwood and Royal Roue.
When the excited spectators shifted their gaze from
prostrate boys and riderless horses to the sadly-
dirninished field. Solidify was in command from
Dialogue, Valwyne, Royal Dighton, Meenah and Ceo,
and this order was kept until about the six-furlong-
post, where Polycletan had moved into third place.
Bowling along beautifully, Solidify gained appreci-
ably over the next three furlongs, and the Lnvendo
colt entered the straight three lengths ahead of Dia-
logue, with Lilypond, Windbag and Virgin Gold
coming fast and Polycletan dropping back. Solidify
was still in front at the distance, but Lilypond anil
Windbag threw out challenges, and. finishing much
more stoutly on this occasion than he had done for
the same jockey (Duncan) when his stable-companion
was winning the Autumn Stakes, the four-year-old
chestnut from Perth prevailed by a length, with
Windbag a head in front of Solidify, who lasted just
long enough to credit Dan Lewis with third money
and his backers with £9 13s. for every 10s. staked
on the machine—in another stride Virgin Gold would
have been third. Gungool was a respectable fifth,
and Dialogue, Ceo, Te Kara and Polycletan followed!
the time being 3min. 26jsee. Thus the Queensland-
bred and Westralian-owned Lilypond had rivalled the
achievement of his sire, Lil.v-veil. who won in 1914
with Bst. 81b., 6lb. less than his offspring carried.
Five firsts and one 'second is the record of horses from
Westralia in the last 18 Sydney Cups; and consider-
ing that Jarrahland is the most distant State, and
the least populous except Tasmania, and that Queens-
land, South Aus. and the Speck have supplied only
one wirmer among them in 40 years, to go back no
farther, it is rather an astonishing record. Tommy
Foy, who collected ' £6233 and a £2OO gold cup
from the A.J.C. as a result of Lilypond’s victory, is
evidently as good a judge of gallopers as of trotters
—he owns and drives the champion Westralian
pacer, Kola Girl. But his success would have been
more popular if the chestnut hadn’t run so badly in
the Autumn Stakes, and the sudden improvement
should have been met with a “Please explain.”
R. Marsden, the rider of Kingslot, and L. Frank-
lin, who took Lewis’s place on Spearfelt after the
old un’s suspension, were seriously hurt; Franklin’s
skull was fractured, and Marsden is suffering from
concussion and broken ribs. Donnelly (Royal RouG)
and Robinson (Prince Minimbah) sustained minor
injuries; and Kingslot, for whom Samuel Hordern
and his friend “Constable” gave 2000 guineas and
contingencies without getting a tithe of it back, had
to be destroyed, while Royal RouG and Backwood
will be out of action for some time. It is no use
guessing whether or not the result would have been
the same had the six horses not come down and
interfered with others, notably Polycletan and Wal-
lace Mortlake. What is certain as that the ugly
business was avoidable, and that it is the duty of
the stewards to fix the blame and take such action
as will, as far as is humanly possible, prevent a
repetition. There is a great deal too much foul or
incapable riding on Australian racecourses.
The other winners on Cup Day were Metellus (9
to 4) in the first division of the Flying Handicap;
1 ressie (14’s) in the second division; Manfred (10
to 9) in the Faster Stakes; Minterne (7 to 2) in
the First Steeple; Coinage (s’s) in the Nursery
Handicap, first division; Spring Days (7’s) in the
second division; and Narrogin (20’s) in the High-
weight Handicap. Two favorites in eight races;
awl the average ringman laid very little against
Manfred, and not a great deal against Metellus,
who, another of those Valais three-year-olds, is
trained by Holt for Kellow, the former track cyclist.
However, the general impression that McShortodds is
having a wonderful meeting is disputed by that
chronic grumbler, who protests that he has “just
about paid exes.,” and that in any case there is
“not much dough in sight.” Lausanne was one of
those who failed in the second division of the
Flying. A good horse undoubtedly, though his
Randwick form was disappointing, he is to be gelded
and turned out.

The holiday racing in Victoria was not very
important. However, the Sandown Park Handicap, 10
furlongs, on Saturday, provided brisk betting and a
stirring finish. Penloein (3’s) was in front to the
distance, where Artamus (7 to 2), well handled bv
young Rae, caught him and had his head in front
at the deciding point; Deacon (5 to 2) and Roisel
(7 to 2) were four lengths behind. The last-named
jumper finished very strongly. The £lOOO Easter
Cup, 12 furlongs, at Williamstown, proved a soft
thing for Gay Serenader (7 to 2), who was lengths
ahead of Jackstaff and Centreline at the right end,
with Drongo (heavily backed again) one of the un-
placed lot.

“Ilasen”: Melbourne race clubs seem to
have settled down quite philosophically to a steady
diet of rough riding. It is really much worse now
than when jockey Dempsey said his farewell say on
the matter safe aboard a boat for England. It is
the rarest of things to see a race cleanly run, and
it has become so regular as to be monotonous to
read in the daily papers that “Halty Lass was well
backed but was badly interfered with,” and “Slow-
come when making a run was knocked back last.”
And this “interfering” might be an act of God for
all the notice the stewards take of it. Apart from
risk to the lives and limbs of riders and to the
pockets of punters, if things go on without “inter-
ference” from the authorities, owners should soon
find themselves doubtful about risking horses of any
value in such bump-as-bump-ean affairs. The de-
liberate foulness or otherwise of the jostling, boring,
galloping-on and general skittling that take place
is a matter of indifference. Incompetence just as
much as (in my opinion, even more than) foul rid-
ing shrieks for suspension.
A good jumper generally comes to light
in the Great Eastern Steeple, 3J miles, at Onkapa-
ringa (S.A.), and Dundalk (Pistol —Poise) is one of
the best. Ridden by the Melbourne jockey, T.
Glennon, Dundalk gave a dashing exhibition of fenc-
ing, and won in a canter. Favorite on all the
machines, he paid £2 18s. for £1 ; Huja, the second
horse, paid £l5 16s. Old Dependence (Pendil —
Design) collected the Onkaparinga Cup at last, and
registered 2min. ISlsee. for the 11 furlongs. It
was his sixth start in this particular race, and the
faithful who punted on him got nearly 10A to 1 for
their money.

“The Deacon”: “Where are the horses of
yesteryear?” the prad-poet sings at this period of
the Racing Calendar;
and the reply of the
savage punter is usu-
ally short and to the
point. It's either
“Hope the cow has
gone to the Zoo for a
lion’s breakfast,” or
“Hope he’s pulling
his internal mechanism
out in a dealer’s cart.”
But a one-time gal-
loper that was backed
heartily at one stage
for a Sydney Cup has
plumbed the depths of
equine degradation. 1
saw him recently in
the Western Suburbs of
Sydney in an ice-cart.
He was offsider to a
large and unlovely
mule, and, squibby as
ever, was letting the
American pull double.
J. P. ARTHUR,
owner of Fuji San.
Sydney people, always keen on Godfrey's
boxing’, paid £2838 in dollops of 30s. 4d., 15s. 2d..
7s. 7d. and 4s. 4d. to see their favorite pug meet
Harry Collins, of Newcastle, at the Stadium on
Saturday night. It had been copiously alleged that
Godfrey, who has done little fighting jo"f recent years,
would “strip in fine condition.” in point of fact,
he scaled only 4oz. less than Collins’s lOst. 631 b.,
whereas he was little more than a featherweight at
his best; and the superfluous weight was mostly
abdominal fat. Godfrey’s only chance was to “knock”
Collins in the early rounds, when the latter, owing
to nervousness or some muscular idiosyncrasy, is
unable to get going. In this Fatty failed, although
he tried hard enough and landed two or three wicked
punches. Collins was himself in the sixth round,
and after that it was only a question of how long
the tiring Godfrey could dodge the inevitable. He
avoided it until the beginning of the tenth, when a
short right on the chin sent him down and out. Sid
got £BOO for his night’s “work,” Collins having
guaranteed him that amount; and both young men
may count themselves fortunate that the legs of Syd-
new “sports” are so easily pulled.

The encounter between Sam Burmeister
(13st. 1011 b.) and Billy Meeske (12st. 7j)lb.) at
Melbourne Stadium was a failure as a wrestling
match but a success as a comedy turn. Burmeister,
alleged champion of the Philippines, provided the
knockabout humor. His ponderous dives for grips
almost invariably missed ; on these occasions he gen-
erally bounced himself on the mat, but now and
then he varied the proceedings by falling on his
opponent. Meske stopped laughing long enough
to get an easy fall in the fourth round and another
in the fifth. When Sam returns to the Philippines
he will have to defend his “championship” against
Temario Pizarro, the Moro demon, who weighs
Cst. 1211 b.

“Wink”: Weis Eicke, St. Kilda’s main-
stay for 16 years, has left the seasiders, and will
captain and coach North Melbourne, one of the new
League teams. A decade ago, when the State-school
final, preceded the League play-off, young Weis was
the idol of all footballers, for as a player lie was head
and shoulders above his fellows. Then he joined St.
Hilda, and as a back man took a place as one of the
very best, though had he not so repeatedly tried to
play his 18 opponents without assistance, he would
have been a better man for his side. A feature of his
game is his spectacular high-marking, a talent
which glued him for many years to one position; but
during recent seasons he has shown that he can dis-
tinguish himself in any place on the field. His
showy methods endear him to the ladies who follow
the game. “What a pity he’s a Jew,” I remember
one belle saying. “But,” said her friend, “Ikey
may only be his nickname.”

A. S. B. (“Wakka”) Walker, elected as
a selector of the N.S.W. Ilugby Union on his retire-
ment from active footer, has good claims to be con-
sidered the best scrum half Australia has turned
out. Comparisons are difficult, but lie was cer-
tainly the best of his contemporaries, including Dun-
can Thompson, the Queensland Union half, who
later became a champion at the League game.
Every bit as nippy and brainy as the League con-
vert, Walker excelled him in ruggedness, and was a
far better defensive player on a beaten side. “Wakka”
has a great representative record, beginning with
the tour of the Wars tabs in America in 1912, and
following with the games against Queensland in
1913. From 1914-19, he was abroad with the
Light Horse. After that, he played against M.L.
in 1920-21-22-24; against the Maoris in 1922-23, and
against South Africa in 1921.
“Past Grammar”: N.S.W. Rugby lias sus-
tained a serious loss in the return to Queensland of
Otto Nothling, the Sydney player, who has repre-
sented N.S.W. as fullback since 1920, against South
Africans, Maoris and All Blacks. He is one of the
best fullbacks the State has fielded, and has worthily
kept up the great Rugger traditions of Brisbane
Grammar School, whence he came to Sydney Uni.
As Union football is now confined in Queensland to
juniors, Otto intends to play the League-game, hav-
ing, with the Oxford blue, Lawton, joined up with
the Brisbane Past Grammar club, a League survival
of one of the most famous Australian Bugger clubs
of the past.
“Shrewsbury” : A lot of interest is being
taken in England in the meeting between Gilligan's
M. 0.0. XI and that one which recently toured
South Africa under Mann. The fixture was
arranged by Solly Joel, the J’burg- millionaire who
organised the South African tour, before the teams
left England. On form Gilligan’s lot should prove
the better, though Macaulay, the Yorkshire bowler,
and one or two others who the critics think should
have come to Australia, are in Mann’s side. The
showing of the latter in the Union was by no means
brilliant, and no one would nowadays put South
Africa in the same class as Australia.

“Top Rail” : Cricket is usually a peaceful
game, but I recollect acting as scorer for a match
at Chindera (N.S.W.) which ended in the finest
free fight 1 have ever seen. At the time Cudgen,
an adjacent sugar district, swarmed with Kanakas,
lundreds of whom had journeyed to Chindera for
.he Boxing Day sports. I forget whether it was part
of the programme or not, but a cricket match,
Whites v. Blacks, started on the green in front of
the pub in the afternoon. All hands had been im-
bibing freely, and it was a pretty sozzled pair of
skippers who watched the coin come down. The
darkie won and sent Jimmy Solomon and Sandy Fiji
in to bat. The umpire gave Jimmy out l.b.w. to
the first ball, but Jimmy refused to go out and
callecl the umpire a liar. Both skippers tried to
coax Jimmy* out, and the wicketkeeper tried to shove
him out; but Jimmy stuck to the pitch and invited
the bowler to proceed. Then a misguided youth in
the bar, directly opposite Jimmy’s end of the
wicket, attempted to settle the point with an empty
lemonade bottle. Jimmy returned it to the bar
with compound interest in the way of speed. It
missed the chap it was aimed at, but knocked a
whole pint of beer out of the hands of a thirsty
timber-cutter. Then the fight started. It raged
up and down in front of the pub for about two
hours; and I remember distinctly an old drover fall-
ing down on the job of counting the black eyes and
the bleeding scalps. Only the unholy terror the
Kanakas had of the Law stopped the brawl. At
the sight of one constable riding down the road
they threw r in the towel, and the John Hop herded
them off and drove them like a flock of discolored
sheep to Cudgen, two miles away. Next day a
queue as long and dark as a serio’s reminiscences
stretched out from the Cudgen police station, to
be fined ss. each as it passed through that hall of
justice. I don’t remember a white having been
fined, so I suppose the palefaces retained the ashes
A BALLAD OF SUPER-SPORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“1 back the asteroid,” ho said.
The little moon hung low in ‘■pace;
The line of barrier fire was red,
The course clear for the race.
The vast electric engines sang-
The song the morning stars once knew,
And wheeling planets softly sprang
To points of light that grew.
Nine little worlds in racing trim
Pranced to the barrier line of fire,
Sleeking their speed with currents slim
That strained in coil and wire.
“They’re off!” The sudden cry went out.
A thousand million leagues of space
Added its echoes to the shout
Where far eyes watched the race.
The ether dust was blown in clouds
Across the parapets of stars;
And like black flies the watching crowds
Clung to the crystal bars.
The gazing grandsire drooped and died;
His son took up his bets and place;
His grandchild saw the clouds divide
On that stupendous race.
As spinning, quivering, pole to pole,
The leaders neared the judge's bo.';,
Each, shrieking like a tortured soul,
Strained hard its hills and rocks.
And when the orb that crossed the line
First by an island stayed its flight,
Its whole green herbage, tree and vine,
Waved in creation’s sight.
They led it home through groves of light,
A ribbon on its topmost peak;
But one discovered late that night
Its seas had sprung a leak.
Yes, splash by splash, through one great tear
Ran out that ocean salt and green ;
And now they’re trying to repair
The hole with plasticene.

Goldberg 2,
Dry-blowing—Anti-liquor’s claims about
the success of prohibition in U.S.A.
Aid. Hedley Gelston. of Brisbane City
Council, won tlie Ballarat competitions’
championship for debating in 1909, walked
off with the Tasmanian Cup for oratory, and
in the past 20 years has won mortal combat
in all the Australian States for elocution and
extempore argumentation. A few years back
he contested the Herbert seat in the State
Parliament as a Liberal, and, bad he proved
successful, would undoubtedly have been the
orator of the House. Gelston, who hails
from Adelaide; is only 41, and, as he has
strong Parliamentary leanings, may yet talk
himself into a Nationalist seat.
“Sixenate” : In a recent liquor prosecution
a Victorian hotelkeeper, charged with hav-
ing sold liquor untrue to label, alleged that
an “inexperienced barmaid” was respon-
sible for turning one kind of whisky
into a bottle with the label of another brand,
and filling a gin bottle from the draft supply.
The obvious commentary on this is that,
since the State law enacts that only women
who registered! as barmaids on a date now
well in the past are allowed to serve, there
can be no such thing as an "inexperienced
barmaid.” It looks ,»s though it should be
somebody’s job to see that tin' law in relati in
to the barmaid is not flouted.
“Troophorse” : An old battler for the un-
developed N.T. is Tom Styles, who, after a
few months’ spell in Sydney—the first for
27 years—returned by the last steamer to
Darwin. Prospector, drover and explorer
by turns, just lately lie has linked up with
the Government as “boss” of the Brock's
Creek mining district. During the Gilruth
regime he was sent down to the old settle-
ment of 1837 at Port Essington with instruc-
tions to put the Administrator's name with a
“By order” attached on all the scanty relics
he could find. In the confusion of orders
Tom spelled the potentate's name wrong,
with the result that there was bad weather in
Darwin for six months afterwards.
“X.D.”: The most efficient pub chucker-
out I have ever met in a career packed with
experiences of pub-closing times was the
retired pug who looked after the business at
a hotel in Wellington (M.L.). Hardjaw's
methods bought him a few fights, but they
were generally brief affairs —-his reputation
was a power which made for peace. When,
at a minute to the hour, the lights were
flicked out and on again as a hint to revel-
lers that it was time to depart, Hardjaw
promenaded the bars with this gentle warn-
ing: “Ten o’clock, gentlemen ! There are two
ways of going out —walking’s the best.”
Patrons of the establishment almost invari-
ably walked.
“Sixenate”: An offender who has reason
to consider himself unlucky is to face his trial
in Melbourne for an offence committed six years
ago. After successfully eluding the law for
this period he returned to the city with a
beard and a reasonable expectation of being
forgotten; but the scrutiny of a detective
who clambered one day into a city ’bus
embarrassed him. Obviously the sleuth was
struggling with his memories, and the other
man thought it would be a good plan to
bluff. The affable smile he let loose was
his undoing; the flash of a gold tooth gave a
clue upon which the puzzling memories of
the detective closed sharply. He is not the
first man to suffer through failing to keep
his mouth shut.
“Barrabool”: One of the night-patrol on
Fremantle wharf found a beery fireman be-
longing to an overseas ship indulging in a
noisy siesta behind the goods-shed, and
stirred the knight of the shovel to wakeful-
ness. Instead of taking the service in good
part and getting aboard his ship, the
aroused person took the Samaritan by sur-
prise and floored him. As the fireman pointed
his boot for a third kick, the patrolman
got to his feet, and with a mighty swipe
to the jaw, followed by a punch in the region
of the Britisher’s beer-cellar, laid the
quarrelsome one in tlie dust. When the fire-
man came to he found that of all the people
that he might have polished his boots on in
Fremantle lie had chosen Bill Doherty, ex-
lieavyweight champion of Australia. The
old-timer wore a grin when tlie magistrate
rubbed £5 off the sailor’s wages account by
way of a “purse.”
“11. Hardupp”: A Melbourne firm, learn-
ing by some means that a collector in its
employ was at the Spencer-street station,
and that all the indications pointed to
his impending departure by the Sydney
express, became not unnaturally suspicious.
Sundry customers of the firm were approached
by ’phone, and when it was learned that
several fairly big sums had been collected
that day, suspicion deepened and the police
were hurriedly approached to effect an arrest
before the train went. The discovery of
several hundred pounds in notes in the sus-
pected fugitive’s pocket confirmed the firm's
worst fears. But consternation came with
the discovery next day that on the tick of
three the full amount of the collections had
been paid into the firm’s bank to its credit,
and there was nothing to show that the money
the man held was not his own —it wasn’t
the firm’s, anyway. Of course the whole
business was a frame-up. but none the less
it cost a bit to salve the man’s harrowed
feelings.
“Bay Webb” : The recent annual reunion
of veterans of the Soudan contingent re-
vived the old fallacy that the contribution
of 800 men by N. S. Wales to that campaign
was the first military assistance given to the
Empire from overseas. Fifteen years previ-
ously Sydney volunteers had sailed from
Fort Jackson to reinforce the M.L. Militfc
hotly engaged in the suppression of a Maori
rebellion. The year 1857 marked the very
first aid given by a British colony to Im-
perial arms. George Grey was Governor of
Cape Colony, and on the outbreak of the
Indian Mutiny he diverted to Calcutta on
his own responsibility a strong force of Lord
Elgin’s army which had called at Cape Town
on the way to China. He did more than
that. He despatched artillery, horses and
£60,000 in specie from the Cape Treasury;
further, he utilised the colony’s cavalry and
artillery, and even shipped the horses from
his own carriage. And for some time he
kept up supplies of food, men, horses and
ammunition—all without a syllable of autho-
rity from the Imperial Government.

10 YEARS OF
PERFORMANCE
Large numbers of Republic trucks are
operating satisfactorily to-day after ten
years of faithful service. To present
day truck buyers this means simply
that Republic trucks are built to haul
tonnage throughout truck life at the
lowest cost per ton per mile hauled.
Length of life, of course, is merely a
factor in the whole equation—just as
are mileage, and upkeep, and cost, and
operation. You must consider all fac-
tors to decide intelligently what to buy.
However, it is impressive evidence of
Republic’s lowest ton mile cost, that
Republic trucks have performed 10
years—and still are performing satis-
factorily. Trucks that are so built must
have a very long start in the direction
of lowest ton mile cost.
And Republics continue just as they
start. Built by the organisation that
has produced and sold more trucks than
any other exclusive truck company, it
is but natural that Republic trucks
should reflect this experience, this
knowledge and this solidity in econ-
omical hauling.
We want to sell you Republic trucks
only on the basis that, all factors con-
sidered, we can save you money on
your hauling.
Republic is one of the few nationally ser-
viced, nationally used, nationally reputed
trueks. Only a truck proved at every
task, in every region, gives assurance of
fitness for all work.

Francotte Cadet Rifle, 297/230 cal.
Owing to the supply of Government cadet
rifles, which have been recently for sale on our
market with new and used barrels, becoming
exhausted, we have made arrangements for a
supply of new cadet rifles direct from the fac-

fore being sent out. This rifle is well and
favorably known as being easily the best small-
bore rifle to be obtained for long-distance shoot-
ing, it is accurate at 500 YARDS, and on
account of its power and penetration, is quite as
reliable and effective as the larger-size rifle,
over which it has a great advantage in cost of
cartridges. It fires CENTRE FIRE. BOTTLE-

Id eked the gallery at Melbourne Royal on
‘ K turd l y Jl 'ght, Poured down their cheers
when the curtain rose to “discover” Pauline
lederick» and, with cascades of similar
enthusiasm from the circle, and ripples
amongst the bare rocks in the stalls, the
whole house was full of a tumult which kept
the show from making a start for several
minutes, while the screen star bent to the
hoards, the tears in her voice showing how
much she was overcome by the reception,
lhe flattering enthusiasm lasted throughout
the evening until speeches had been de-
in an (Jed and given, and the curtain dropped
tor the umpteenth time and finally on the
flower-strewn stage. But obviously it was
the lady s wide advertisement on the screen
which produced the tumult; for, candidly
the lady is not a star of this other stage—*
not, at any rate, a star to provoke enthusi-
asm for her art alone. As Margaret Sones
she managed to satisfy an unexacting audi-
ence without showing those finer inflections
Ox emotion and character-rendering which
might have been put into them.
tl** * • *
“Spring Cleaning” concerns itself with
the wife of a literary man. Richard Sones
(xMayne Lynton), who, after 10 years of
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
"The Two Rascals” — O'Donnell and Fields.
married life, finds her husband dull, and,
mixing with a set of degenerate idlers, is
tea_sed into inclining towards some of their
viciousness. Alarmed at discovering that
she is philandering with the flippant Lothario
Ernest Steele (adequately represented by
Leorge Barraud), whose philosophy is that
there is no need for him to marry while
other men do so, Sones endeavors to induce
ms wife to break from her worthless associ-
ates, and, finding her obdurate, introduces
a prostitute as his guest to a dinner-party
m order to make a comparison between the
iady of the streets and his wife’s loose-
moralled friends—“the professional and the
amateurs. The subsequent passage of in-
sults makes. a “strong” scene, based upon
rather unbelievable circumstances, and leads
to a climax in which the threatened divorce
is changed to a final reunion of a husband
and wife who really love one another, with
the aid of the street lady aforesaid—a very
neat bit of work by June Elvidge, although
she seemed doubtful whether she was a full-
fledged Cockney or for business purposes
should have a French accent. In the recon-
ciliation a hand is also given by the semi-
repentant profligate who is nartly unwilling
to marry and partly feels that Margaret is
not the sort of woman who should be dragged
through the Divorce Court.
* * * *
Artistically speaking, the play is not up
to the standard of “Aren’t AVe All?” Fred-
erick Lonsdale has here further developed
the tendency he showed there to create
sensation by the use of downright language:
but there is a sense of artificiality about
r——
many of the situations suggesting that they
were created mainly to allow the characters
to juggle with smart sayings and paradoxes.
For all that, it grips from start to finish:
the smart sayings get all their mead of
laughter, and sometimes more; and it seems
to be the sort of thing that will attract big
houses for some time.
* * *
Into a fiat, amazingly elaborate for two
stonybrokc young men, pour a wife who
"wants to deceive her husband” by sporting
with one of them, the fiance of the other
with her mother, a comedy Jew who has a
lien on the furniture and wants to sell it
to a moneyed widow from Kansas who also
arrives with her lovely daughter, the hus-
band of the lady first mentioned, who really
is only a bill-collector, but is naturally an
embarrassment, and bevies of sprightly girls
who have choruses and dances to get oil
their chests and toes, and who hurry off to
change their clothes and come back again ;
besides some sundries. In this atmosphere
of Hurry and intrusion the. story of the
frivolous wife who can't get away because
every time she tries to go some new people
enter, and who finally has to take refuge in
an elaborate wall-bed with one of the young
men, with whom she is duly locked in, and
the developing love of this young man and
the young lady from Kansas —these things
are sometimes remembered when something
amusing that is not a chorus or a dance, but
merely a situation, is required. It provides
hilarious episodes, but is, after all, only a
thread upon which the balloons of frivolity
are strung.
* * * *
Thus “Little Jessie James” opened at
Melbourne New Princess on Saturday, and,
while it has many faults, it has many points
which are warranted to bury themselves in
the esteem of a public not exacting about
its frivolity as long as it is frivolous. One
of the anchors is a number in which a
variety of girls represent past and gone
musical comedies, reviving their memories by
the best-remembered songs. It was one of
the opportunities the piece gives several
girls who are actually merely the chorus;
and they did very well. One stage-setting
covers both acts—a monotony not expected
in this style of piece; but the intro-
duction of some nice effects in a pro-
logue makes an atonement. Dot Brunton
altered her name to Little Jessie James,
using the usual winning tricks to nestle in the
heart of the audience; Elsie Parkes Was the
frivolling wife; and Mary Gannon, as Geral-
dine Flower, showed that in the few mouths
since she was last in Melbourne she has
put strength and distinction into her voice.
As Tommy Tinker, one of the impecunious
young men, Harry Angers made a better
showing as chief comedy merchant than was
expected from his work in pantomime.
Leslie Pearce was' Paul Revere, the other
young man, and sang nicely, though he has a
good deal to learn on the acting side.; Oliver
McLennon was a Clarence who needs to
get more toiie into his singing, and some of
the best work of all was done by John Kirby
as the heavy debt-collecting husband. There
was an introduction of noveltv in the jazz-
band orchestra—-a purely Australian affair,
like the rest of the show, with the exception
of Angers and Escott, the latter an amusing
Jew.
“Primrose,” which decked the meadow at
Melbourne Majesty’s last Saturday, is a
more than usually simple flower in construc-
tion, but it clothes itself in a blatant im-
modesty of color and many swift dances. On
these latter alone it should reach the great
heart of the frivolous public. The story is
about a popular novelist who hitches his
houseboat to the river bank, and proceeds to
incorporate in his new novel (“Primrose”)
the taking young lady (Maud Fane) who
lives in the house near the O.P. entrance.
The love affair no sooner develops than a
misunderstanding arises owing to the be-
haviour of a garish young lady, name of
Pinkie Peach, with whom the novelist
lunches in order to get a friend (Alf Frith)
out of difficulty; but the whole party hie
across to France, where the very slight
understanding is unravelled in a sunny atmo-
sphere of mirth, melody and ecstatic dances.
The music is occasionally too strident to be
tuneful, though there are numbers, “Rose of
France,” for instance, which are appealing.
One catchy chorus, soon due to be whistled
by every early-morning milkman to the
accompaniment of rattled milkcans, “Wait
a Bit, Susie,” is overworked, but seems to
appeal to the palate of trained musical-
comedy adherents, although when it has been
sung by half a dozen different people, and
danced by as many batches of girls, the
jigging refrain is a bit tiresome. As be-
comes a frivolous adventure which is mainly
froth and Frith, the show is full of patter,
from smart to cheap. Cecil Ivellaway, as Mike
the Chauffeur, has less to do than usual;
Maud Fane is not so bright as she should
be; and William Senior is a stiff lover.
But Winnie Collins gives a lively rendering
of the Pinkie Peach who is also a beauty
specialist with a French name, and Hush
Steyne is a good Freddy. The stage pic-
tures are charming; Cunningham and Clem-
cuts add to the full weight of dances with
some swift work which is as much acro-
batics as dancing; and a special word is de-
served by the rapidly-climbing Rita Nugent
as the sporty young lady in x’idiug breeches
who annexes Freddy.
* =!: $
Allan Wilkie had one of the crowded houses
which tilled all the theatres in Melbourne
last Saturday, when he staged “She Stoops
to Conquer” at the New Palace; and his de-
serving was certainly by no means the least.
(Goldsmith's delightful old comedy of how
the young man who was bashful with women

sible ladies, was induced to make love in

Majesty's, Sydney.

a barmaid, rippled
through its amus-
ing situations to
the pleasing accom-
paniment of old
English songs and
the laughter of a
well-satisfied audi-
ence. On paper
the weakness of
the cast seemed to
lie in the part of
Tony Lumpkin ;
but Milton Sands
managed the jocu-
lar lout more than
passably, and in
the inn scene was
particularly good.
Miss Nellie Mor-
tyne did excellent
work as Mrs. Hard-
castle. The play
is to go on until
the box-office calls
for a change. “The
School for Scandal”
and “The Rivals”
will follow.
‘Elijah” was sent up to Heaven on the
voices of the Melbourne Philharmonic on
Good Friday night, with the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra assisting. The absence
of solid retaining walls where the annexes
join the main Exhibition Building was less
felt than might have been expected, although
sometimes it was disturbing; and the
draughts called for overcoats. Madame Mary
Conly managed the soprano solos, and put
fine tone-color into her work; in the con-
tralto role Madame Gregor Wood was good,
and Miss Hilda Foletta sang very naturally
as the youth. The male parts were not as
effective, although T. H. Downie was clear
enough in the tenor solos, and Alexander
Raff less monotonous than on his last ap-
pearances. The choir was at its best in “Be-
hold God the Lord Passed By”; therein
Alberto Zelman managed his instruments
particularly well.
Walter Kirby had a large support in his
Good Friday entertainment at the Melbourne
New Princess; and the audience was pleased
that the Sacred Song ITestival was not quite
as sacred as it had feared when it took the
risk because there was nowhere else to go.
There were two shows, one being an after-
noon matinee. Though harassed with a
cold, the recently-returned Maud Benton dis-
played a voice of enriched quality and
strength, and had the sympathy of the audi-
ence when the cold won on points. Kirby
himself was best in “Betrayed and For-
saken,” and one of the choicest offerings of
the evening was a Chopin Nocturne by Hat-
tenbach.

Iconoclastic Time breaks the reign of “The
Green Goddess” at Melbourne King’s on
Friday night. On Saturday Guy Bates Post
will be “The Masquerader,” which the man-
agement is assuring Melbourne it is aching
to see again.
❖* * *
At the end of another week the good ship
Retriever will cease to come into port at Mel-
bourne Athempum bringing surprise for
Gappy Ricks and a meaty husband for his
daughter. The delayed “Skittles” will then
give John D. O’Hara another game.

Scott Sanders has arrived at Melbourne
Tivoli with a series of sketches which meet
approval. The rest of the programme is
unchanged, with the Two Rascals getting the
loudest noise.

Stiffy and Mo have now got themselves
into the red coats of Huntsmen at Mel-
bourne Bijou. Naturally they go over the
fence at times.

“So Long, Letty,” is having a screen show-
ing at s dc Luxe, with Colleen Moore
and Grace Darmond as the ladies who ex-
change husbands; and “Flying Hoofs,” a
picture to which the trite adjective “red-
blooded” applies, helps the programme.
Douglas Maclean provides exciting humor
at the Majestic as “The Fighting Consul,”
with a theatrical story, “Trouping with
Ellen, for support.
Straha s great success at her first concert
Mas ‘ Bel Baggio" (“Semiramide”). This
M as sung with a brilliance and gracile sweep
that was the more astounding after hearing
the voice in heavy action. After 14 years'
absence the Australian prinm donna made
the first song-flight in the Sydney Town Hall
on Saturday. It Mas an electrifying occa-
sion, iind Verdi's “Aida" was the medium
through which the voice expressed its heroic
qualities. It is a voice capable of magnifi-
cent soarings, is pouerful almost to stridency
in its middle register, and yet is so under
control that it can ripple into the coloratura
region. In her opening number. “Ritorna
\ incitor, she unfolded the ringing claritv
of her upper registers, liquid fervor and
dramatic shadings. Listening to this
first aria you realised that here was
rm flutist sings with her brain.
Jhe big love duet from “Aida” displayed
the subtleties of which the sonorous voice is
capable; the tenor, Jordan, in this number
made a great hit as Radames, Aida's all-
conquering lover. Not so happy was the lady
in the “Trot Here, Trot There” duet from
"Veromque,” but in Curran’s “Life” the
voice asserted all its dominance. But the
big thrill of the evening came when the
organ thundered and Strulia’s voice rang
out in Elgar’s “Land of Hope and Glory.”
1 lie tenor’s notes are manly and heart-
melting, and the voice is robust enough not
to be submerged by the soprano in the duet
numbers. His first solo muis “Celeste Aida,"
and though very melodic, his rendering was
not so devastating to the emotions as Alt-
house’s. But in “Songs of the Hebrides” he
was poet as well as singer: the Tour-
ist Bureau of the islands certainly
ought to pay him a subsidy. Joint star witii
the vocalists is Bessie Griffiths, whose ’cello
has a singing quality; there is, too, a nimblr-
ness of tone and a perfection of phrasing
ttisit allured her listeners, particularly in
“Chanson Indoue” (Rimsky-Korssakow) and
in the Popper and Ivreisler numbers. An-
other delight was the clean sM-eetness of her
boM’ in the beautiful old “Drink to Me Only
with Thine Eyes.” Vern Barnett, the
accompanist, again suggested that his last
job had been with the heavenly choir. Mon-
day night heard the company repeat its
artistic success. Verdi was again the com-
poser most honored, Stralia’s arias being
“Tacea la Notte,” from “II Trovatore,” and
“Ernani Involami”; while the evergreen
“Miserere” was the big duet offering.
The epacris and the wattle have already
faded from the bush, but “Wildflower” will
defy nature for six nights more at Sydney
Royal.
That a white man can retain his health
and a sense of humor in the tropics even
with seven wives is being nightly demon
strated by Mark Daly in “Tangerine” at
Sydney Opera House.

of man in general and liis own family in par-
ticular. His family in this instance consists
of Mrs. Brough, who is the usual dear, de-
lightful old lady in blinkers; her husband,
the Dean (Reginald Wykeham), a somewhat
overdrawn exposition ; his son, a chip of the
old block, who gets caught in the coils of the
usual dangerous woman (Ethel Wellesley) :
with Irene Vanbrugh as the unattached spin-
ster, who assists Dion to sharpen his wit
on all the rest, and E. Pirie Bush as a
rather unpleasant young man from Aus-
tralia who turns out to have had an affair
with the wronged wife, but consents to be-
have like a gentleman about it in the end.
As Greek chorus to this not very original
assortment Boucicault is in his element, and
is able to exploit bis equipment of peculiar
mannerisms and the sparkling libretto of
Frederick Lonsdale to excellent effect. That
libretto sparkles well enough, by the way,
not to need the assistance of the worn-out
device, introduced about 15 years ago by
Bernard Shaw, of putting Australia's copy-
righted curse-word into the mouth of a
parson.
The sun-tanned squatters now in town are
bulging the outer wails of Sydney Tivoli :
and the show is worth the squeeze. At the
head stands Long Tack Sam. prince ot
Oriental showmen, whose brisk turns chase
each other. Chris Charlton, a close second,
is deceiving the sharpest eye with his illu-
sions; Henry de Bray and Doris Hare lam-
poon jazz songs to the delight of highbrows,
and perform a number of ultra-modern caba-
ret dances with good effect; and Tom Clare
shows admirable restraint and a rich vein
of humor in his songs and monologues.
Lorna and Lance are an exceptionally
bright pair of infants, who have captured
the affections of even the blase buldhead with
their dainty old-time dancing at Fuller's
house in Sydney. They waltz with such
grace that one can’t help grieving a little
over what this generation is missing. Togo,
the little Jap juggler, handles spinning tops,
billiard cues and tennis balls with uncanny
accuracy, and Cardini is a wonder with a
pack of cards. The second half, belonging
to George Wallace and co., is occupied by
a sketch called “The Village Boys,” which in-
cludes a smattering of bucolic humor and a
few catchy melodies. But the absence of a
ballet is felt.
“The Three Wise Fools,” at Hoyt's (Syd-
ney), are the screen relations of the trio of
whimsical old bachelors who were with J. D.
O’Hara at the Cri. recently. There is a
greater freedom about the film version ; addi-
tional scenes have been inserted and the
dialogue is retained in an endless number
of sub-titles. “The Sea Hawk” still flaps
its wings at the Crystal Palace; and “The
Ten Commandments” at the Prince Edward
must be worth paying to see—Harry Lauder
went there last week.
"The Great Broxopp," Adelaide Repertory
Theatre’s first production of the year, is
very light stuff. In the main idea A. A.
Milne has played a trick on his audience;
by all stage conventions, when an enthusi-
astic young husband insists on dumping all
his wife’s little fortune into a commercial
venture, it will go bung. But this one does
not. Broxopp s Beans for Babies bring him
fame and fortune; and the story skips a
generation to show his son Jack at Oxford,
very sick of such fame and of the under-
graduate humor that calls him a Bean Baby
and the like. Jack acquires an aristocrat
father-in-law, who first induces the family to
retire from business and change its name to
Chillingham and then loses all its money. So
Broxopp and Jack are at the finish left cheer-
fully planning to build up a new fortune out
of Chillingham’s Cheese for Chickens.

The chief work fell to lioystou Marcus,
capable as the advertising genius, first young
and then middle-aged. Catherine Neill was
content with the minor interest of the daughter-
in-law. A mainstay of former years, Frank
Johnston, came back to take a butler’s im-
portant part. Clive Carey, a new arrival at
Adelaide Conservatorium, made an immedi-
ate success as an intermeddling Dickensy
aristocrat; so did Wallace Johnstone as the
youth with the Oxford manner. The play
drew tv o big houses; but it is hardly Reper-
tory work.
“My Mate,” at Adelaide Prince of Wales,
is an old Australian favorite, in which a
supposed murderer is protected by all the
really nice people, and a man who asks for
money due is well kicked. Rutland Beckett
and George Cross score as the two heroes. In
pictures good old Ambrose Applejohn is at
the York, under an American disguise as
"Strangers of the Night.” West’s has a
really funny story of a youth who insures
against falling in love; and Thomas Meighan
is at his best at Wondergraph.

(M.L.) Charlie Blake, good actor and good
fellow. Born in Nelson with a baritone
voice and Bohemian instincts, the stage soon
superseded his adolescent callings. Small
parts with Dora Mostyn and Holt were fol-
lowed by leads with Rignold, Bentley, Maggie
Moore, Anderson, the Macmahons and Fitz-
maurice Gill. However, Blake had few
serious moments and would sacrifice a big
scene, as he sacrificed a career, for a laugh.
Since 1913, as an advertising agent, he
laughed more contracts from Auckland to the
Bluff than most of his serious competitors.
Charlie’s son Frank lost an arm in the Big-
Broil, and returning to Wanganui, his birth-
place, without the aid of influence or lapel
display, won his degrees and is now eligible
to practise as a solicitor.
“Goldilocks”: Melbourne has had recent
visions of three well-known actors going
about with beards; and sometimes Mel-
bourne, seeing them, has thought it had the
horrors. The habit of shaving, and shaving
in all directions, makes the actor's beard
grow very twistily; but these three, having-
been helping Louise Lovely to make a
moving-picture in the wilds of Tasmania, a
picture in which beards were needed, have let
them stay. Perhaps they may be wanted
again. Whiskers used to adorn actors’ faces ;
in an age when for a man to be without hir-
sute adornment implied that he was unable
to grow a crop, a moustache at least was no

encumbrance to a mummer. The most be-
whiskered Thespian the Australian stage re-
members was Signor Majeroni; but his full
chin-cover was meant as a protection for a
throat that was inclined to delicacy.
“Pitt-strcet Pro”: Tell “S. Gumm” (B.
0/4/’25) that a play by Pauline Frederick’s
hubby, Willard Mack, has been seen in Aus-
tralia. The thing was called “Kick In,” and
saw the footlights in Sydney nearly 10 years
ago, with Muriel Starr and Frank Harvey
in the cast. It was a brutal kind of Eugene
O’Neill crook drama (very crook, according
to Australian ideas), with a wealth of strong
language in the dialogue. No other Aus-
tralian city was favored with a look at it.
“Kick In” was, as one might say, kicked
out.
“Charlik” as a chorister :
The approaching performance of Bach’s B Minor
Mass by Sydney Con. students takes my memory
back exactly half a century, when the Bach Society
was in existence in London under the conductorship
of Otto Goldsmidt. It was an amateur affair, but
some of the adult members of the choirs of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and H.M.’s Chapel
Royal, all professional singers of repute, gratuitously
assisted at. the concerts. My- elder brother, Alfred,
was principal tenor of St. Paul’s, and I was a choris-
ter. For one of these performances in St. .James’s
ITall in ISTS my brother took me, and being accepted
as musically “safe” I was allowed to sing with the
first sopranos. Two incidents on that occasion
stamped themselves indelibly on my mind. The
solo baritone had his arm in a sling, and his name
was Frederici —Fred Baker, formerly a 17th Lancer—
who afterwards met such a tragic fate in Aus-
tralia. The other was at the end of the perform-
ance, when one of the ladies by whom I had been
sitting presented me to Madame Goldsmidt—a sweet,
wrinkled old lady in a figured silk gown, who had
THE LOWER CRITICISM.

things underneath 'em?”
been at. the end of the front row of the first sopranos,
She shook me by the hand and pleasantly chatted
for quite a while. It was a very excited and puffed-
up choir bov who returned to the Cathedral School
that night to brag- to his pals that he had shaken
hands with, and had been spoken to by, the Swedish
nightingale Jennv Lind;
"F.N.W . : An item in an England news*
paper states that Malcolm Scott, the dame
comedian who visited Australia a year or
two ago. has bought a tobacconist s shop
in Brighton ( Eng.). Scott and 1 were once
playing at Hanley (Eng.), and neither of
us found particular favor with local audi-
ences. \\ alking round the town on Satur-
day morning, we paused at the window of a
fishmonger’s shop that was occupied solely
by a stock of cods heads, much esteemed
in the locality as a week-end dish. With
wonderment we surveyed the vast pile of
blue heads with their open mouths and bulg-
ing eyes. “Ah, that reminds me.” said
Scott, sadly, “there is a matinee to-day !”

of his Irish eyes and his soulful voice. He
shows a tendency to elocute, which will
need careful killing when he essays a mod-

Hamfat : Edna Moncneff, a cousin of

“Hambone”: Dion Boucicault’s Austra-
lian productions of “Trelawny of the Wells”
doubtless recalled to him tlie original cast of
the play in London in 1898. Its members
were strongly representative of theatrical
families. Dion’s father w r as the author of
"The Colleen Bawn.” Sam Sothern’s father
created Lord Dundreary and set a fashion
in ziffs ; Gerald Du Manner's dad w r rote
“Trilby” and gave the language a new
word. Aubrey Fitzgerald’s grandfather was
a king of melodrama. Then there was Miss
Bateman, whose male parent had the Lyceum
before Henry Irving’s reign. The achieve-
ments of the fathers kept the 'sixties happy,
Their children added to the gaiety of the
closing century, and some of them have
made a later generation their debtors.
“Fltt-street Pro.”: Hugh J. Ward, so
recent cables tell us, has been busy placing
Australian mummers and mummeresses i,.
tip-top engagements in London and N'York.
\\ e are told that Madge Elliott, Clarice
Hardwicke, Yera Pearce, Cyril Ritchards
and Judith. Anderson owe their prominence
on overseas stages to Hugh .T.'s introduction
and influence. But Yera Pearce has been
in England several years and has held vari-
ous engagements there—revue. musical
comedy and pantomime. Cyril Ritchards went
to America last year armed with letters from
the chief of the Williamson firm to most of
the important managers and agents, and was
shopped with Ziegfeld almost as soon as he
struck Broadway. Judith (formerly Fran-
cee) Anderson has been away from her native
land (where she was never entrusted with a
part of any account) for 15 years, and has
steadily, through her own talent, climbed up
to stardom. These press-agent narratives
may go down with the public, but the acting
fraternity only grins.
"Hamfat": Of course there have been
numberless occasions when mummers in Aus-
tralisi have received nothing
at all for their services; but
1 think the 4‘.d. handed to
each member of a suburban
show in Sydney on a “snap"
visit to Ashfiold is the small-
est actual payment on record
for an evening’s perform-
ance. The “commonwealth
system” used to prevail
amongst “snaps” and subur-
ban shows, and was some-
times tried on extended trips
into the country; the man-
ager, who supplied scenery,
script and props, got an addi-
tional divvy for these and his
(usually rotten) manage-
ment, but bore no liability
for salaries. Usually any ex-
tended trial of the system
crashed, owing to the sus-
picion—f requently well
grounded—that the manager
charged the show more for
expenses than he paid out.
An English actor-manager,
noted in his day, used to en-
gage his people on the under-
standing that he was to take
75 p.c. for expenses and the
work of himself and his wife.
After the nightly count he
would pass the rest to a representative of the
assembled co. with a brusque "Here's your
share —cut it up among yuh."
From "Mid-Channel” :
The fact that Pinero, when writing “His House in
Order,” knew some tricks that A. A. Milne forgot
when he was guilty of “The Truth About Blayds”
(B. 2/4/’25) is easily accounted for. Before taking
to the writing of plays, Pinero gained a practical
knowledge of the stage and its technique, while
Milne’s knowledge was merely theoretical. Pinero
may be likened to Blondin, who could walk the
tightrope, having had practical experience: Mile
to a don who, while understanding all the laws
relating to equilibrium, would break his neck if
he tried to do what Blondin did. In stagecraft
Pinero outclasses all his contemporaries. “His
House in Order” is the type of a perfectly con-
structed play'—-comedy' and drama evenly divided
and the characters standing out in marked contrast
to each other. One circumstance may be quoted to
show how thoroughly' Pinero knows his job. The
sister of the immaculate first wife instals the hoc
in his mother’s sacred boudoir (closed for three
years) in order to deprive the second wife of any
chance of occupying it. This very' act brings about
the sister’s dismissal and the extermination of her
family influence, for the boy finds secreted in the
boudoir incriminating letters which lead to that
end. Notice also that this discovery by the boy
is made when the second wife is practically down
and out —even forsaken by her diplomatic brother-
in-law. And how cleverly Pinero sustains the in-
terest until the end of the fourth act! The audi-
ence is kept guessing all the time. Yet in nearly
all modern plays of similar length written by other
authors, the fourth act is a tedious superfluity.
“E.T.”: Importations from the music-
halls were no novelty on the London
Gaiety stage in its burlesque days (B.
26/3/25)- Indeed, John Hollingshead,
George Edwardes’s predecessor in manage-
ment, was fond of going to the ’alls and
the minor playhouses for recruits to the
Strand house. He picked up some rare
talent there, too. Kate Vaughan, Connie
Gilchrist and Phyllis Broughton were
originally dancers at what are now politely
termed vaudeville theatres. Harry Monk-
house and Arthur Williams were stock
comedians at the old Grecian, off the City-
road. These were all snapped up by Hol-
lingshead. who, by the way, invented the
phrase “the Sacred Lamp of Burlesque."
He once offered Chirgwin, “the White-eyed
Kaffir,” and engagement, but the Cockney
nigger funked it. A top-line comic singer.
T. W. Barrett, accepted John’s offer, but
when he arrived at rehearsal and was given
a part and held the MS. upside down, it
was discovered that he could not read. So
he went back to his free-and-easy single
turn.
GRIEF
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“After all, there is more sorrow than happiness.”
—The Alines.
A song of sorrow I must sing
(Ah me, alas, and alack-a-day!) :
Grief may be found in everything
If only you will look its way.
Oh. let us on our tears insist,
And howl our dismal woes aloud;
A silver lining can't exist
I nless it lias a darkling cloud!
.lo.v springs spontaneous from the bowl.
But, stigmatising wine as sin;
Let us with grievous mournings howl
About the lees that lie therein.
Voung love with rosy lips may kiss
The heart of youth, and make it leap;
But if 1 marry or I miss,
I’ll find good reasons still to weep.
Though cheery blue may be the sky,
Soon leaden clouds its light will shade:
Sweet flow'rs with sorrow fill my eye—
Ah (woe is me!) their bloom will fade.
Let foolish laughter be the thief
Of time with those who think they're gay ;
But 1 will find my joy in grief—
Alas! ah me! alack-a-day!

Apart from replacement and re-
pairs, an engine, no matter how
perfect it may be, demands two
things—fuel and oil feeding, and
constant attention. Why, the
stock themselves are less trouble-
some. Is it any wonder that owners
are fast going back to the free wind
for power —going back to the idea,
yet moving forward in the choice
of the “COMET” Mill as a me-
chanically perfect Wind Engine of a new order. In
fact, it was only doubt or the bad performance of
inferior mills that made men seek supposedly more
consistent power originally. COMET capacity will
fill the bill for you for pence that would be pounds
in engine fuel and upkeep, or inferior mill troubles.

you nothing to prove. Write for Use the Wind,

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Ao notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped,
frame and address must appear on the MSS. So
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Quiz: Doubtful, though it didn't look so
until in Adelaide Supreme Court a while ago counsel
got a verdict for the paper on the ground that the
pel son libelled had already recovered damages from
the original libeller. However, The Bulletin
wouldn t take a chance even now. In a matter ul
contempt of court, action would certainly lie against
the paper.... Spinner: As a matter of fact the story-
tellers are quite as careless; but their stuff can be
sub-edited. It isn't easy to do that to the
artist’s.... F.L.M.: Oh, what an ear you must have!
....Thistledown: Not at all bad until you got to
the last verse. That needs recasting.... Zebulon:
Sent us to sleep at the i;inth page. .. . Murrawee:
Much obliged. You’re probably right E.C.G.M.:
The lid has been put on that discussion ltakoff:
Dirty boy !. .. . 90S: You’ve got the stuff ; but it has.
often been put better.... Paratiui: Can’t sec your
aigument for your forest of words. Get to work
with an axe... .R.S.R.: He says thank you for the
suggestion; but the subject is too modern.... Lester
M.: Don t see where “On the Brink” would tit in
S.T.M.; No good. We want fresh ideas and new
experiences, not pages of the encyclopaedia made
into a dry hash I. Solo:.That's the stuff—the
little things we don’t know about the people we do
know... .W.H.8.: Doesn’t get near.... Alice R.:
thin, hungry verse that is correct enough, but is
always strained and says hardly anything, after all.
. ...A.t.h.: Nothing there to make a yarn about...
J.L.M.; It leaves us cold and rather sad.... The
Cynic; Only repeats the old things in the oldest
way... .A.J.L. : Put more work into it Gordon
M. ; Falls over its own b00t5.... A.A.D.: Goes on
and on without point or purpose... .Junior: The
lines limp painfully'. Head some good verse....
R.D.&.; Doesn’t make us want to print it.... I’.it.
(New Farm): The mirth is of the heavy brand
that could only stir very enthusiastic curates....
H.M. : Falls down tpo often..-. .A 49: It began fairly
well but rambled away to nothing.... Helen 13.: Too
wispy in idea and too frail in construction... .No
Name: “Life, Art and Love” doesn’t appeal to u 5....
O.A\.W. : The verse is pretty lumpy D.C.: Not
well enough done to atone for other defects
1'.H.11.: ’the tale of woe needs tightening up and
making into a more forceful charge.... E. A.
(Perth): Not good enough F.T. (Manly): They
don’t move us to say yes S.T. (Auckland): “The
End of the Road” is a tame sketch without much
reality U.G.: Improbable yarn with bad local
color. .. .M.M.K.; Not up; but the last very good
stanza nearly saved “The Path” W.E.8.; They
all miss by some distance M.J.H.: No use to
us R.B’.S.: Fearful... .Alice S.: A long way off.
J.H.C.S.: Poor quality and very little "inter-
est.... Kevin M.; Masses of lumpy commonplace...
Will R.: The snake yarn isn’t convincing. .. .Emme
M.: The mirth goes thinly 39: “Out of Control”
is a bit too misty for ordinary* comprehension....
Ca:sar: The carpentering of it isn’t good Nellen:
A very sombre little picture that is only half
true... .Steve: None of them interesting enough....
E. : Nothing in the yarn R.X.J.; The potato-
stealing is not bright M.M. (Oamaru): No inter-
est .... Ripponlea: The fate of the mouse is very
moving:—
“Alia ! You little rascal,
_ You’re locked out, 1 see;
Escape is quite farcical,
’Twixt your freedom is nje!”
Said a dustman to a mouse he saw
Scamp ring in front of a pork-shop door.
He crept close and his expression was horrid ;
And seeing this was th’ mouse worri’d.
As it run up and down and all around,
• Th* dustman knelt upon th’ ground.
’Twas then I sensed th’ coming mishap ;
For I seen th’ dustman reach for his cap ;
And I closed mine lids to a sickening swot,
For, alas, th’ mouse had taken th’ knock 1
. ...M.K.S.: Weak and tottery little things....
Flicker: Trick verse of the rondel type must carry
a good deal more than the mere trick to get a hear-
ing.... Bally Rat: The lunatic’s ideas of things are
no way thrilling R.A.F.: That’s the style. Rub
it into the plagiarist:—
The brigand man sought the blessing of his father.
Who was old and white
And feeling the pinch rather,
And he got it all right.
“Go out, my son, and fight all day
With a gun, ramp and slay,
And bring me home
A great poem
Just as if it was fur away.”
lie took some Shakspeare,
And Sir Conan Doyle
And the dinkum oil
From Sir Walter Scott.
His father said you’re a failure.
This great poem
Is not your own,
You must cross the foam
And get better known
As they do it in Australia.
. ...L.G.8.: Your intentions are good; but even as
a first attempt the work is not. .. . L.G.F.: it is
bright, but too thin E.K.R.: Creaks at the joints,
aim says the obvious. ... Richard M.: Won’t d 0....
M.E.C.: Very stodgy description S.D.C.: The
verse doesn’t carry it C.S. (East B.) : Says too
little. .. .D.P.M.: They miss. Grow your own
phrases; use the language you speak, and your work
will be stronger 0.A.J.: Too obviously manufac-
tured Fred S.: The yarn leaves us cold J.J.J.:
Aou ought to take a tonic for your sense of humor.
... .A.C.H.: The Scotch dog, the viking and the
Saxon king all fail in interest and workmanship.,..
F. : Not up.. . .R.C. (Brisbane): That yarn has
been told with minor variations a hundred times.
....White E.: Too long for our requirements. But
you shouldn’t have any difficulty in selling it _o
a magazine Mary M.: That bull has met that
painter-lady and upset her easel too often
Mangel: Oh no, there’s a hungry market here for
topical verse.... Tor; The style doesn’t suit the sub-
ject. ...Johno: As you say, it is pretty good evi-
dence that the original D’Arrietta “paid his own
fare to Australia.” But the subject is scarcely
worth pursuing. .. .8.W.; No good. An ounce of
personal experience is worth more to The B. than a
ton of encyclopaedia... .Irvine D.: Not well enough
done to carry it through; for the subject isn’t
vastly interesting... .E.D.N.: You loaf on the job.
....Ibis: Don’t make stilts of your pen. Come-
down to earth and use your natural language...,
Jess D.: You haven’t struck suitable subjects this
time; but you can write, and we want to hear
from you again. .. .Lismorite (and a hundred
others): Peace, peace! Our hands are up. And
Oswald Pryor swears he will never try to make
another incidental joke without labelling it “Not to
be taken seriously.”
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.H.R.: Three echoes from the past, embellished
with scratches. .. . K.D.: The humor hobbles; but it’s
an Olympic champion compared with the art....
H.G.: Life must 'be worth living in your part of
South Aus.

“Phial”: Some years ago a Perth ware-
house was badly hit by the “fishy” failure of
a prominent business man. The manager’s
chance of indicating his opinion of the erst-
while bankrupt came when the latter pre-
sented himself at the warehouse and offered
to buy for cash. “Tell Mr. So’n’so,” said the
manager to his second, “that we have no
time to test his sovereigns.”

Scot (B. 26/3/’25) would have taken any
risk in picking up a wayfarer and then
accidentally tipping him out of the buggy.
The law—in N.S.W. anyhow—does not hold
the owner of the vehicle responsible unless
it is a hired conveyance. It is the traveller
who pays his fare who may claim damages;
you are at liberty to smash up your friends.

“Mag": The cheese sent by the Pittsworth
Dairy Co. (Q.) to Wembley last year
tipped the scales to 14 tons, measured sft.
bin. across and was 2ft. bin. high. One
day’s supply of milk, viz., 3445 gals., was
used in the making. As it was sold at a
satisfactory price, the company at the re-
quest of the Commonwealth Government has
been spurred to a greater effort, and its
second cheese was shipped on March 2, by
the Essex. It weighed 40001 b., or 0401 b.
better than last year’s.
* * * *
“Huflin-Guffin”: Twice a year, on Good
Friday and Christmas Day, the daily papers
of Victoria tukc a day off. Nevertheless, the
weekly paper account remains always the
same—9d. at present. I have never yet
found a newsagent who voluntarily reminded
me that there were only five papers in these
weeks; I always have to remind them.
An agent doing 1000 each of Age and Argus
must make quite a nice little Christmas
box or Easter gift out of the absent-minded
beggars.
* * 14 *
“Bi”: Speaking of Australian-made rugs
(B. 26/3/’25), I, too, am the owner of an
enduring bit of stuff presented to me by
the South Melbourne Australian Women’s
Assoc, when I was treasurer of the branch
in 1906. It has accompanied me through
Europe and in many Australian excursions,
and I am confident it is going to last me to
the end of my days. It Avas made at Gee-
long, has been washed three times, reappears
every winter, and is as good in color and
texture as when I first spread it over me.
* * * *
“Harry J.” : Among vanished features of
Sydney city life I think regretfully of “The
Hole in the Wall,” that delightful old cara-
vansai’y that used to distribute the smell of
cool beer and hot stew on the crowded air of
Wynyard-lane. You got a pint of beer
for threepence, and there was no limit
set to the amount of stew you could
consume with it. Still, most patrons
exhibited a decent regard for the
feelings of and the fair trade-profit expected
by the proprietor, a fat florid man with a
kind heart and a rare knack of making a
bullock's liver the last word in palatable
provender.
* * * #
“Hamer”: There are Melbournites who
probably value the memories of youthful do-
ings on the old Ozone at more than the
£350 recently paid for the ancient Bay
steamer. She has been torn to pieces and
sold. Even the seats upon which people who
are now grandparents did some of their
courting were among the salvage ripped out
of her. In 1886, when she arrived from
Glasgow, the Ozone was the proudest craft
in Port Phillip; but by the time the
Weeroona appeared she had become the
smallest boat of the three in the Bay ser-
vice ; being put out of commission she was
left rotting at her moorings.
* * * *
“W. J. Digger”: While I waited for a
homebound tram the other night it started
to rain, and a cultured voice near by invited
me to share its owner’s umbrella. I accepted
gratefully and we talked of cabbages and
kings before _ drifting into theosophy and
psycho-analysis. On these subjects my
benefactor spoke as one having authority.
“Are you a University lecturer V” I asked,
when the flow had somewhat abated. “No,”
he answered; “as a matter of fact I’m a
bottle-oh.” He must have felt my astonish-
ment. “Not a house-to-house or general
practitioner,” he added; “I’m a specialist—
country hotels and seaside boarding-houses.
I use a two-ton motor lorry, and a hundred
dozen a day is nothing out of the ordinary.”
“Mako”: Before the war an American sent
by sailing-ship at a nominal freight a trial
consignment of mountain ash to a M.L. firm.
There was no demand for the timber in M.L.,
and the shipment lay on premises in Auck-
land for over 10 years, while the business
changed hands three times. Then the furni-
ture trade announced a shortage of suitable
woods, and a junior clerk suggested that
the firm might try to get rid of the ash. The
timber was snapped up at first offer, and an
astonished U.S. firm received a substantial
draft for an item that had been ’written off
years before. After a few remarks on the
“amazing prices” they promptly offered to
start regular business with the Auckland
house. But the latter, having lost all inter-
est in timber, turned the proposition down.
* * * *
“Teller”: Yesterday I carefully compared
six of the Commonwealth Bank’s notes, and
no two were identical. In some instances the
predominating color was green: in others it
was nearer yellow. The words “T. S. Harri-
son, Australian Note Printer,” appeared on
only two of the six. One was actually a
little smaller in t size than the others. In
several cases the fine “one pound” traceries
overlapped the borders, and in every instance
the marginal widths varied. On three notes
the numbers ran across the words “Common-
wealth of Australia,” but on the remainder
they were separated therefrom by distances
varying from £in. to fin. Further investiga-
tions satisfied me that it would be difficult to
find a standard note by which others could
be properly compared. In the days when
the Australian banks issued their own notes
they would have viewed such a condition of
things with grave concern, because of the
scope for forgeries afforded by such irregu-
larities. The Commonwealth Bank people
evidently are not in the least concerned.

It Pays to Invest in
Pioneer Leather Belting
An investment in Pioneer Leather Belting pays for itself many
times over. Provided the correct Pioneer Leather Belt has
been selected for each particular drive, and reasonable care
used in its maintenance, you can forget your belting problems
for years to come.
Could there be better evidence of the enduring quality of
Pioneer Leather Belting than the letter reproduced herewith?

We are returning to you one Pioneer Double Leather Belt,
each 15in. and V,Un. wide, which we have no further use for
as we have dismantled our Electric Light Plant and connected
up with the Municipal Council Supply.
These were purchased from yon about 25 years ago, ana
are still in very good condition after all these years of service.
They have proved to be a very good investment to us, for apart
from their long and efficient service, they are returning to us
more than we originally paid for them.

MESSRS. DALGETY & CO.. Brisbane
Clem Hack, just retired from the board
of directors of Vic. A.N.A., deserves to be
remembered because of his strenuous fight
tor the “Made in Autralia” movement —he
supplied a heap of the energy of the commit-
tee which arranged for various exhibitions of
Australian manufactures in Melbourne. In
his spare time he and his staff occupy a
suite of offices in Collins House and do
patent-agency work. Victoria stole him from
South Aus.
‘ °ld man of 54,” who was recently
found pursuing the profession of Domain
dosser at Budapest, and was sent to the
workhouse, proved to be ex-Prince Alexander
ot Hohenlohe-Oehringen. He was cast off
and deprived of his rank 30 years ago when
he wedded an actress, and apparently had
been brooding ever since on short marriage
and long repentance. As Kipling put it: “A
woman is only a woman, but a good cigar
is a smoke.”
Just dead, at Bournemouth, in the Cold
Country, Mary _ Irvine, widow of Francis
Ormond, the Victorian philanthropist who
contributed £40,000 to the building of
Ormond College at Melbourne ’Varsity, was
one of the founders and chief props of the
College, and left nearly
£-00,000 for other colleges and hospitals to
snare between them. His widow, who was
lus second wife, was 75 years old at her
death.
Groperland gained an interesting relic the
other day in London when Premier Collier
accepted an inscribed silver cup which a
party of Swan River settlers, impressed with
Ins "wisdom and kindness,” had presented
to Admiral Stirling, the settlement’s first
Governor, in 1833. Two of the sailor’s
grandchildren, Mrs. Cooper and Lieut.-
C olonel R. S. G. Thorold, made the presenta-
tion. Tliorold, an Imperial reservist, was
in Australia at the outbreak of war; with
the rank of captain he went to German New
Guinea. Later he joined his home unit in
1 ranee.
C. Stanton Hicks, one of the most bril-
liant of M.L.’s younger scientists, gets the
new Sheridan-Marks lectureship in Physi-
ology at Adelaide Uni. He had his Master
ot Science degree before the war, in which
lie did good service. He has at various
times held a Research Scholarship of M.L.,
been Government Analyst in Otago, and
made a reputation as consultant for indus-
trial firms, which job sent him to various
parts of Europe. Incidentally, Cambridge
University knows him well. And he is
only 33.
“Glen Alwyn”: In affirming that Father
John Hall, 0.M., president of St. Stanislaus'
College, Bathurst, is a brother of Mother
™y. foundress of the Sisters of St. Joseph,
The Deacon” (B. 5/3/’25) is astray.
Mother Mary was a McKillop. Incidentally,
in addition to figuring as the first Australian
Vincentian, Father “Jack,” unlike a certain
section of the R.C. clergy, is a barracker for
the home-made article. With one exception
his entire staff of clerical assistants at
Stanmes is Australian born, and four
are ex-students of the college.
“Mako”: Even that unfortunate angler
who took home, all unknowing, the cooked
fish had better luck than a Sydney man who
spent a day of much diversion up Middle
Harbor. > One of his equally incapable co-
anglers tied up a small fish for him to take
home as a proof of piscatorial success. His
wife made no comment until next day, when
she revealed the horrible fact that the fish
was wrapped in a lace hanky that bore the
name Dolly” in one corner, and was secured
with a bronze hairpin. It was his last
fishing excursion. He now plays bowls.
Cyrus IV. lye, who has taken the perma-
nent head’s chair in the N.S.W. Works De-
partment, is a sturdy person of 46, whose
features indicate alertness, efficiency and
spare days spent in the open air. Newing-
ton College supplied him with his schooling
and Sydney University gave him diplomas
m commerce and economics. The Educa-
tion Department picked him up in his
youth, and from there he dropped into the
Lands, Department, where he paid special
attention to the Closer Settlement branch;
but he has been with Works for enough
years to know where its good men are. Dur-
ing the cricket season he wears flannels for
Mosman seconds.
“Harold Hardupp”: Upon the register of
curious thefts must be entered that of a
Melbourne man who, being engaged in set-
ting up a home, raided a Salv’army hall for
furniture and linoleum, cutting off just suf-
ficient of the latter to cover his floors. An
even cheekier performance was that of a
citizen who put a ’phone number to an adver-
tisement offering a cheap houseful of furni-
ture for prompt sale. He offered to escort
the first applicant for the goods to the spot,
and within half an hour the applicant had
parted with his hard cash and become the
.purchaser of a bargain lot. When, after the
vendor had vanished, the buyer commenced
to remove the goods, his joy changed to con-
sternation;. an equally surprised houseowner
arrived, and explained that the furniture was
Ins —the man who purported to sell it had
merely that morning obtained the key on the
pretext that he wanted to inspect the fur-
nished cottage with a view to renting it.
“Ex-Dig.” ; A Melbourne chemist has been
prosecuted for selling liquor in the form of
a tonic, but as the case was dismissed with
costs against the licensing police, the pharma-
cists will be under no necessity to re-stock
their shelves. As a matter of fact, the
average chemist’s shop is as full of alcohol
as a brewery; hence the popularity of so
many patent” medicines. A certain “com-
pound tincture” is the best drink that can
be got from the pharmacy. It is almost
pure alcohol, and doctors who have been on
the jag sometimes find a stiff nip useful as
a steadier. For a long time I used it as a
Sunday stimulant when the liquor had run
out and the pubs were unobliging; and,
passing through Durban (South Africa),
where the padlocks were kept severely on the
pubs whilst the Australians were in port, I
became wildly popular with a whole platoon
which I introduced to the seductive beverage.
Soda and this comp. tine, also go very weli
together, and even more surprised than the
chemists who experienced a sudden run on
an article ordinarily little in demand were
the people at Durban’s biggest Y.M.C.A.
when they saw a number of Diggers who had
been ordering nothing but soda becoming un-
mistakably hilarious.

FROM Perth to Brisbane the news
went ’round “the new Studebaker
cars are here” and immediately the great
Australian public thronged to see them.
Never before have any new automobiles
received such a whole-hearted welcome.
Never before have so many people
gathered in Studebaker showrooms.
In America, Europe —everywhere that the
new Studebaker models have been intro-
duced—public response has been the same.
People came. They saw. And they
bought! Bought on such an enthu-
siastic scale that during the last quarter
of 1924 (usually the dullest season)
Studebaker sales broke all records!
There must be a reason. There is. In
fact, there are many reasons. The new
Studebaker models embody three new six-
cylinder chassis, and nineteen beautiful
body designs. Including the entirely new-
type car, the Duplex, an open and a closed
car combined! The Duplex body is ex-
clusively Studebaker!
New beauty of line and finish. Increased
power—smoother,finer performance. New
ease of operation. New, complete equip-
ment. Luxurious riding comfort. Conser-
vative operating cost. Greater motor car
value in every detail. These are not mere
phrases—but facts!
If you are the least bit skeptical it is both
your privilege and duty to investigate.
Studebaker dealers will be pleased to show
you every feature —to demonstrate on the
road the many advantages of the new
Studebaker cars. Don’t buy in the dark.
Ride in one of the new Studebakers before
you decide!

a Beautiful
Rexona Oirl.
“I have always
used B e x o n a
Soap, and I con-
sider It most
excellent for the
skin and liair.”
MISS I. VAN DO,
528 George Street,
Sydney, N.S.W.
Are you Satisfied with your Looks?
Why not be a Rexona Girl?
Rexona and Rexona Soap are the Rexona Girl's aids to beauty. With their
assistance she rids her skin of blemishes and pimples, keeps her hair and scalp
in such perfect condition that she is the envy of all her friends. But the Rexona
Girl is not selfish—she does not keep the secret to herself, but wishes all the
world to rejoice with her. Over 5000 girls have written to the Company the
glad news that they are Rexona Girls, and find the Rexona Products the most
wonderful aids to health and beauty.
They say that Rexona Soap keeps their skin and hair healthy and beautiful,
and should be used by every girl who values her good
looks. They say they are always finding new
uses for Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and
many of their letters contain a
photograph w h i c h
shows, by its beauty,
that these users are
getting the best results
in health and happi-
ness. Are you satis-
fied with your looks?
Why not become a
Rexona Girl, and use
only Rexona and
Rexona Soap, too?

The Rider.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN happy days remote and old
A horseman here a-wooing came,
When kowhais bloomed in pendant
gold
And ratas lit the range with flame.
Tall Christmas trees along the tides
Lent color to their ebb and flow;
The silver tussock sheathed the sides
Of foothills to the fields of snow.
The circling hawk, beneath a cloud,
His downy younglings still in view,
Challenged with raucous notes and loud
The empty gulfs of soundless blue.
Few things remained unmated then,
For Spring was virile on the plains;
And summer in the hearts of men
Lit love-fires in their throbbing veins.
My rider came from hills of wind
Through gorges each a roaring mouth,
Clear-eyed, lean-loined and ruddy skinned,
A mounted viking of the south.
For half a year with me he stayed;
And that half-year he looked not back
With wayward fancy on a maid
Or shed or shanty by the track.
He heard a call and forth he went
To unfenced places vast and free;
His heart was in his continent,
Out there across the Tasman Sea.
He called it “My Land.” with its plains
Fenced by the sky’s inverted bowl.
I dreamed of it as hell, with pains
That sear the very heart and soul.
I saw that land where he would be,
The horses tethered near tin' camp,
The night-fire chimneyed by a tree.
The moon-rise o’er the mountain ramp.
The smoky vault with livid bars
Across the night and many a lake,
Remote and deep, where swimming stars
Left not a silver ripple-break.
I heard a sound of things that prowl,
Nocturnal things that dread the light;
From a dark hill a dingo’s howl
Struck eerie shivers through the night.
I saw a mother nurse her child
At taut and overflowing breasts;
And on the moment I was wild
To have him where his memory rests.
For love is not by age subdued;
To each in season comes the hour
When all her pagan womanhood
Blooms red in one great passion-flower.
Perhaps the desert chafes his bones
Where never rider comes a-near;
Perhaps among its dripping stones
A river shrouds him all the year.
Dav follows day across the vast
From moon to culminated noon;
It seems eternity has passed
And there is neither late nor soon.
Full well they serve who stand and wait!
I show my faith in my man so.
Here by the old love-haunted gate,
Our try sting-place of long ago.
M AORILANU.
DRTIUS.
The Consistency of Grandfather
Hetherton.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A N unpleasant old man was Grand-
/—k father Hetherton. He was not in
*“ the least patriarchal. No young-
sters of his ow T n or any other’s second gene-
ration clung to his knees or gaily prattled
around him. It was but a habit of the
countryside that gave him the prefix. And
there was none of the autumn beauty of
decay about him. From full vigor that held
the attractiveness of all surging, healthy
life he had slumped at once into ugly weak-
ness. His eyes seemed redder, his mouth
more drooping, his hands more tremulous
than those of the oldest old-man had
any right to be. The very twist to his face,
that remained as evidence of the brain-clot
that had struck his confident strength to
doddering senility, was so sneering and sar-
donic. All that should have been pathetic
in him was somehow merely repulsive.
Very little of this, of course, could be
brought as a fault dire'ctly to Grandfather
Hetherton’s door. The stroke that had laid
him low, for example, w T as in no way the
fruit of ill-doing. Hard and harsh had
been his life, but it was hard with unspar-
ing, righteous labor, harsh with unlovely
restraints and stern duties. But there it
was, and they have a way of taking things
much as they see them, these people who
live close to the honest earth. The soil is
not subtle. If it looks ugly it usually is.
But the Rev. Mr. Pedler could not regard
it in this casual way. He was new to the
district and young, so young as to have lost
but few of his illusions about the essential
good in men and little of his white-hot en-
thusiasm. The small weatherboard church
on the hill, w T hose cracked bell seemed too
otten a profaning of many a still Sunday
evening, was his first sole charge, and very
fine it was to him and very seriously he
took it and the duty that was his. It was
the sight of the lonely, twisted figure on the
porch of the old farmhouse and the realisa-
tion that so few of his neighbors sought
the company of Grandfather Hetherton that
inspired Mr. Pedler to a very young and
fierce sermon wherein he thundered his de-
nunciations of the Pharisees who saw the
stricken man and passed by on the other
side. Certainly, in his own experience, the
stricken one had been far from gracious.
Calling on the old man, he had been received
with grunts and sullen indifference. Only
the red-rimmed eyes seemed wonderfully
alive in the dulness of that face, and they
had been turned stubbornly away from him
to glare down the road at the little town
that nestled at the foot of the hill.
But many such setbacks were quite un-
equal to the defeat of Mr. Pedler’s crusading
spirit. Here was one that, he was sure,
was in sore need of comfort, and he began
to study Grandfather Hetherton. Day by
day through the warmer weather the old
man sat in his cushioned chair, and always
he stared down the road to the town. Many
passed on that road, for it was the main
artery of all the country beyond. Bullock
teams with great logs for the mill below,
their shouting drivers winding the heavy
brakes to the steep slope, cattle from far
back driven in to the fortnightly sales,
jolting spring-carts and battered motor-cars
of the fruitgrowers out on the range, horse-
men who clattered recklessly down the lull
and more sedately back, the inhabitants ol
the nearer farms trudging heavily through
the dust—these passed and repsssed the old
man on the sunny porch. But little notice
they got from him. Some waved a greeting,
particularly after that fiery sermon; a few
stopped to speak to him. But none could
divert for long that steady gaze.
From early morning Grandfather lletfier-
ton sat and* stared towards the town and
refused to be shifted till the valley below
had filled with shadows. Even when the
worst of the winter drove him into the
sparsely-furnished front-room to sit huddled
over the fire, his red eyes still _ turned that
way and were fixed and far-seeing as mi the
tldck walls were not there. At such times,
too, his wry neck gave a twist to his head
that made it seem as if lie cocked a listening
ear in the same direction. And then, as the
day closed, his eyes dulled with disappoint-
ment, his bony old hands beat an impatient
tattoo on the arms of his chair and he
snarled in impotent rage at the stolidity ol
Mrs. Johnson, who looked to his com tort and
bustled about preparing his supper. Later
the red eyes would stare into the red heart
of the fire and the sagging lips writhe and
splutter unpleasantly while he muttered to
himself, as if mumbling some lasting mouth-
ful, until finally the old head drooped with
weariness and, half-asleep, he allowed him-
self to be helped off to bed. ,
Sometimes the hulking figure ot John-
son, who had forsaken his own poor selec-
tion to work on half-share the prosperous
Hetherton farm, slouched lazily on the other
side of the hearth. But Johnson found the
old man poor company and spent most ot
his evenings at the more sociable haunt of
O’Shaughnessy’s Hotel down the way.
Usually the heavy silence was broken only
by Grandfather Hetherton’s grumbling voice
and the click of Mrs. Johnson’s busy needles.
Grandfather Hetherton was left very much
to himself and his eternal muttering and lus
constant staring down the road. No one
bothered to find out what he muttered about
or what he expected to see some day coming
up the hill from the towm.
Most of his history Mr. Pedler had in
disjointed scraps from Mrs. Johnson that
he was always a good-living man, that he
had been a regular visitor to the little church
on the hill to the time of the stroke 10
years before, that to it over 30 years ago fie
'had led the daughter of Jim Peterson, who
had run the store in those days. A young
girl she was, said Mrs. Johnson, a laughing
girl who giggled nervously when the old
minister droned the solemn words about
letting no man put asunder. Mrs. Johnson
remembered that part of it herself. It had
been such a terrible thing to her as an awe-
stricken child, gaping at the tremendous
seriousness of it all. Other things she
obligingly recovered by delving inui the
buried but still remembered hearsay of the
time, tales of how quickly the young wife
had forgotten to laugh, of how the hardness
of Hetherton was not all for the outside
world, of how r some had said even that it had
much to do with the death five years later ot
a sad-faced woman who had been a laugh-
ing girl. All this Mrs. Johnson told as
disinterestedly as if it had nothing at all
to do with the old man on the porch out-
side the room. In all her dealings with him
she seemed to have fallen into the auto-
matic manner in which she might handle an
accustomed piece of furniture.
Mr. Pedler returned again and again to Ins
siege, which had for its benevolent object the
forcing of comfort on the beleaguered loneli-
ness of Grandfather Hetherton. He was not
to be discouraged by the sullen reserve that
ringed the old man round as an excellent
defence against the world. He was deter-
mined to break through it. Success as
slow in coming; but, in a measure, come it
did —old Hetherton began to talk to him
not so grudgingly, with a certain interest
and animation. He even thought that he
detected a flitting gleam of welcome in the
bright little eyes as he swung through the
gate; but it was quickly veiled, and inevitably
they returned to their unending search of the
road. . , ,
The afFair had by this gone beyond a mere
act of duty or benevolence. This gaunt,
lonely, unlovely old man, who sat there in-
tent and unmoving through the long hours,
and whose eyes looked right past him down
the hill, always down the hill to the town,
had somehow laid hold of his imagination,
and he felt a pressing need to know some-
thing of the unhappy spirit that shrank from
the world beneath this hard and ugly shell.
And then one day, when for a moment the
hardness seemed to have disappeared, he said
quietly, “You always look down toward the
town, Mr. Hetherton, as if you expected
someone —some long-delayed visitor?” There
was no answer. It was as if the other had
not heard him, and after a time he asked
directly, “Mr. Hetherton, are you waiting
for someone to come up the road? What
are you expecting?” For a moment the red
eyes twisted to his; then, in a second, the
old men seemed to withdraw into that stub-
born detachment which had met Mr. Pedler’s
iirst patient efforts weeks before. Abruptly
he ‘^Nothing!” and that was the last
of his conversation for a long time.
Several weeks had gone before Mr. Pedler
felt equal to trying the question again, and
then only because the other’s mood seemed
unusually human. “Look here, Mr. Hether-
ton,” he said, “I’m sure you’re worrying and
brooding over something. I want only to
help you. Won’t you tell me? Are you ex-
pecting someone that you keep on looking
down the road? For whom are you watch-
ing?”
There was a moment of silence, and then
Grandfather Hetherton said slowly, “Ay,
then, I am.” And, after a further pause,
(Continued on next page.)


Old People’s
Kidneys
Many Elderly People Suffer
from Some Form of *
Kidney Trouble
WHEN past middle age there frequently
comes a noticeable weakening of the
organs of the body, and resulting danger
of quick decline. It is quite necessary to give
prompt help to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Weak kidneys often bring constant back-
ache, lame back, stitches and twinges of pain,
annoying urinary troubles, and the danger of
serious kidney disease. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are gratefully recommended by many aged
people. Read these Sydney testimonies.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. Frederick Bradd, Crump Street,
Mortdale, Sydney, says: “I caught a
severe cold, which settled in my kid-
neys and caused severe backache. I
suffered intense pain, and could not
stoop or move about freely. I did not
know what to do to get ease, for the
remedies I used did me no good. See-
ing an advertisement for Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills led me to try them.
They gave me relief right from the
first dose, and in a short time I was
cured. 1 have no sign of backache
now, and attribute my cure solely to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Sixteen years later Mr. Bradd says:
“I have been free from backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me sixteen years ago. I am still a
great believer in this medicine, and
often take a few doses, as I think the
kidneys need a tonic sometimes.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs. F. Osmond, No. 8 Gilbert
Street, Manly, Sydney, says: “I was
a martyr to backache, and the pain at
times was almost unbearable. I also
had several other distressing symptoms
of kidney disorder, such as headaches,
dizzy feelings and sleepless nights. I
was always trying one remedy or
another, but derived no benefit from
any of them. One day a friend urged
me to take a course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and this medicine
proved to be the very thing I wanted.
There was a marked improvement after
taking the first bottle, and by the time
I had finished three bottles of the pills
I was quite cured, all sign of backache
having disappeared entirely.”
Nine years later Mrs. Osmond says:
“I am still free of backache and kidney
trouble, and have been since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me over
nine years ago.”

SYDNEY MAN CURED OF PILES BY
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
' Mr. W. Solomon, Wentworth Street, Parramatta, Sydney, says: “About
20 years ago I had a very severe attack of Itching and Bleeding Piles, and
underwent an operation. .1 was right for about eight years, and then the
complaint returned. The agony was terrible. Not wanting to undergo
another operation, 1 started using Pile remedies. .The number I used would
astonish you, but they gave me no benefit whatever. I read of Doan’s
Ointment, curing others, and decided to give it a trial. After a few applica-
tions I obtained relief and one pot cured me. I alWays keep Doan’s Ointment
in the house, and shall never be without it, for I know what a thoroughly
good remedy it is.”
Ten years later Mr. Solomon says: “I have still the same good opinion
of Doan’s Ointment. It cured me of Piles many years ago, and I never
suffer with this complaint now.”

NEEDED, AND IT’S NEEDED MIGHTY OFTEN. Price 2/9 per tin.
‘‘My ehild’en,” he muttered. It seemed to
Mr. Pedler that a swift moisture softened
those bright eyes, that the bony hands shook
with an unusual agitation.
A great pity for the lonely old man sud-
denly took him by the throat. He felt
strangely abashed and humbled before this
sorrow that for so long had been dumb to
all the world, and the fitting words of
comfort that occurred to him seemed so poo*
and ineffective that lie could say nothing.
Later he sought Mrs. Johnson with re-
proach hot on his lips for her failure to tell
him of this other great loss that the old
man had suffered.
Mrs. Johnson seemed little perturbed. “Oh,
them!” she said; “I did forget them, then,
of course. Everybody knows about them.
'Twas ten years ago, and more, they went.
Cleared out, they did. Couldn’t stand for him
qnd his ways any longer. Cruel hard he was
on wife and child and beast. It’s little won-
der they ran away if all the tales they tell
be true.”
Much more Mr. Pedler heard then and
later of these two children and the manner
of their going—the boy who flung away in a
hot rage, first becoming vaingloriously drunk
at O’Shauglmessy’s Hotel in the town, and
then two years later the girl, <|uiet. and weep-
ing but equally determined. It, was the year
after the going of his daughter that “oid
Hetherton was struck,” as Mrs. Johnson put
it. The two had never returned. Everybody
knew about it, as Mrs. Johnson said, and
most of them took it very much as a matter
of course. Every talk that Mr. Pedler had
on the subject seemed likely to end on the
same note. “He was a hard man,” said file
countryside, and let it go at that.
But whatever of blame may have attached
to that other lletherton of ten years ago was
swept away by the flood of pity that over-
whelmed Mr. Pedler at the thought of the
stricken man in the invalid chair who, day
after day through the years, stared down the
road, looking for the return of the children
who were lost to him. Forgiven and all but
forgotten were the brusqueness and cranki-
ness, the snarling ill-temper and general ugli-
ness of the man. For the young Mr. Pedler
there was all the glory of the martyr, all the
poetry of a fine figure of romance, in that old
man who sat there waiting, waiting for those
who never returned.
On an early Sunday Mr. Pedler preached
his most eloquent sermon to date, excepting
not even his devastating thunder against the
Pharisees, and it held much solemu telling
of that which is “sharper than a serpent's
tooth.” Not a day now but found him on
the little porch, and many hours the young
clergyman and the old man spent in a queer,
uncommunicative companionship. Only once
again did Grandfather Hetherton refer to his
lost children. And then if was if he were
muttering to himself as his habit was. “Down
the road they went,” he said, “jaunty as ye
could wish. And never once did they look
back.”
Mr. Pedler’s imagination and Mr, Pedler’s
words did much in the sight of the neighbor-
hood toward clothing the old ugliness in a
new dignity of sorrow. The good people be-
gan to realise and repent their deep mis-
understanding. In number and respect the
greetings passed to the old man on the porch
grew amazingly. Within a few weeks he
was spoken of more often than not as “poor
old Hetherton” with no hint of the deroga-
tory in the words. There was serious danger
of Grandfather Hetherton lapsing into a
countryside legend of heroic grief and melan-
choly devotion.
But Mr. Pedler’s enthusiasm had taken
also a more active and practical form—to
find and bring .back those straying children,
to appease at last the hopeless longing in
those sad old eyes.
This was difficult. No one in the town or
the country about had heard anything of the
two for years. It was even forgotten now in
which direction they had started. But on
a wonderful day Mr. Pedler sought and
found the news he wanted*in an old traveller.
Yes, he had seen young Jack Hetherton only
a few weeks before. Doing well, he was, in
a shipping firm in Brisbane. Certainly a
letter to the firm would find him. Mr.
Pedler went secretly and joyously to work.
The letter he wrote held the rare appeal of
an artist. With cruel skill he painted his
picture of the broken father on the porch of
the farmhouse, the intolerable pathos of the
lonely old man forever staring with aching
eyes along the road down which his children
had gone from him.
The artistry of Mr. Pedler availed. In
a first letter the young Hetherton seemed
doubtful and reluctant, but later he wrote
that he and his sister, who was now married,
would come to see the sick man on the fol-
lowing Saturday.
Happily but still secretly Mr. Pedler
gloated over the news. He decided to do
nothing to spoil the dramatic surprise of
this great joy which awaited the old man.
Many times in the days that followed he all
but broke his decision at the thought of
wiping the pain from that tortured face,
but with an effort he held back.
On the Saturday afternoon he sat on his
usual step below Grandfather Hethei’ton,
outwardly calm but with litfte inward flushes
that warmed him with the knowledge of this
deed well done. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson
appeared frequently at door and window, for
at the last they had been told of wdiat was
to happen.
And then, when the sun was half-way to its
setting behind the town, they came. Mr.
Pedler was sure of them as soon as the two
strange figures turned into the road and
started up the hill.
The old man did not see them at once. The
sight was dimming a little in those bright,
red eyes. But suddenly the bent figure stif-
fened ; the old hands trembled violently on
the chair-arms; the old eyes all but closed
in their straining effort to devour the dis-
tance to those two that came quietly up the
hill in a glory of warm sunlight. In those
eyes at last Mr. Pedler had the joy of seeing
the dawning of a great hope.
Slowly the two came; nothing said Grand-
father Hetherton, and not for a moment did
lie look away from them.
The gate creaked behind them, and they
walked up the twisted path, and presently
they stood below him at the foot of the steps.
A likeable, wholesome pair, thought Mr.
Pedler, rather diffident and stiff and nervous
under the stress of the moment.
Then the girl’s face flushed with pity for
that wasted, feeble old man in the chair.
Her eyes showed suddenly misty, and she took
a quick step forward.
“Oh, dad!” she murmured softly.
Grandfather Hetherton lifted himself jerk-
ily to his feet.
“So y’ve come,” he said, and his voice shook
a little. “I/mg years have I waited f’r ye.
Day by day I’ve looked along the road. With
never a turn o’ the head ye went, but I knew
y'd he coming. I’ve watched and watched.
I knew the Lord wouldn’t rob me o’ the joy
o' this moment. I’ve waited f’r it, waited
and prayed. To have ye come back,” said
Grandfather Hetherton, “to have ye come
crawling back to me: to be able to say how
little y’ve been missed or wanted; to cast ye
out again, ye miserable, whining creatures;
to tell how I hate ye, and laugh at ye, and
spit at ye, ye unnatural cliild’en ! Ah, the
l.ord has made me happy this day!”
A thin, snarling laugh tore through Grand-
father ITetherton's twisted lips, and he spat
feebly but viciously in the dust at their feet.
An unpleasant old man was Grandfather
Hetherton, but consistent.

"With the Captain's Compliments.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rONOE met an old gentleman who knew
Edmund Malone, paymaster of 11.M.5.
FantOmc during that vessel’s service
I I 850-53) on the Australian Station.
We had been talking about Cook, and I had
laughed a good deal at the story of how the
famous navigator (a man from the North
Riding of Yorkshire, mind you!) had over-
stepped the Sydney Heads.
“Humph! Jackson again!” Jackson’s
watch mi the masthead had become famous
for its series of exclamations and alarms.
Cook, a bit out of temper, but full of humor,
wrote down Ihe look-out man’s name against
the inlet, thus making him celebrated for ever.
Hail it been any other sailor’s report Cook
might have taken it seriously. But most
people to whom I related this anecdote have
rubbed all the tar, and weather, and romance
out of it by saying: “That is all nonsense.
Cook called the place after Sir George .lack-
son, Secretary to the Admiralty.” Well,
I don’t care if he did. The other is the better
story. It smells so much of character and
seafaring ways that I prefer it to the more
formal one of Captain James Cook sitting
in a cabin with a job-lot of administrators’
names waiting for the next bit of earth to
turn up.
And this is where Malone conies in.
Malone’s friend said: “Malone once saw a
man who saw Captain Cook.”
“Ah, tell me that,” I replied, looking hard
at the man who had seen a man who had
seen a man who had seen Captain Cook.
“Malone told it to me himself, and so it
is a much safer narrative thaxi the one about
Port Jackson.”
I gave the signal for “All clear.”
“One day, early in 1851, while Malone
was sitting in the billiard-room of the Ex-
change Hotel, Auckland, his attention was
directed by the police magistrate to a de-
crepit old Maori mooching about among
some officers of the 58th. He carried a
beaver hat in his hand, which he waved in
salutation during his progress through the
crowd; the proprietor, a Trinity College
(Dublin) man, poured him out brandy and
gingerbeer, which he refused, but accepted
an offer of some clothes. He told Malone
his name was Tamewha, and that he was
the oldest Maori alive.
“Malone had a glass of hot milk brought
in to him, whereupon Tamewha began to talk
freely. He said he remembered Cook, and,
holding out his stick level with his waist,
remarked he was ‘that high’ when he met
the discoverer. After Malone had put a
few questions to him, he replied that Cook
had taken notice of him particularly, be-
cause he was the son of a chief; and, further-
more, that he (Cook) had made him a
present. But just at that moment, a dis-
turbance taking place in the billiard-room.
Tamewha was hustled out for safety, and
Malone never saw him again.”
So Cook’s gift remains a mystery. Per-
haps it is still in existence, unrecognised,
unvalued.

When the Wind Blows In.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the wind blows in from Lyalon
It brings strange dreams to me.
Strange dreams of long-forgotten things
Come rushing on the wind's warm wings
Across the summer sea;
And tremblingly I hold the dreams
The sea-wind brings to me.
In the old days of Lyalon,
The dim-remembered days,
I walked, a child with eager eyes,
Under the clear and pearl-white skies
By shimmering, green seaways,
Where little ships with blood-red sails
Drifted through tranquil days.
Now all is gone of Lyalon,
The wide sea is her grave;
But those who sail the lone seas tell
Of the tinkling sound of a silver bell
Far underneath the wave,
Of a silver bell that rings to call
The dead folk from the grave.
When the wind blows in from Lyalon—
Hid underneath the sea—
It brings me dreams of the little town ;
And I wonder if still up and down
My kinsfolk seek for me
Through the drowned streets of Lyalon
And the green gleam of the sea.
And I see again in Lyalon,
When the west wind brings me dreams,
The little church and the windy street:
I feel the airs blow- warm and sweet
From marsh and twinkling streams;
But all that lives of Lyalon
Are the sea-wind and the dreams.
