Upstairs in the Brain.
In the 1200 pp. vol. of the Australasian Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science there is
a paper on “Fact and Idea,” which by dint
of being most obscure looks almost as if it
might be very profound, by force of going
nowhere with great dignity almost looks as if it
might be going somewhere, and by reason of shed-
ding a large amount of darkness over things-in-
general almost persuades one that there must be
a luminous idea in the region from which so
much gloom has been abstracted. That is
to say, it is a metaphysioal paper, and there-
fore for the most part irrational anc} absurd.
For it is at last beginning to be understood that
metaphysics is an exploded science ; and that all
the metaphysicians from Aristotle to Kant, and
past Kant, have been “ hooting up a dead limb of
the tree of knowledge,” darkening counsel and
confusing understanding in precisely the fashion
of the groping essayist in the 1200-page volume
aforesaid. At the close of the nineteenth century
there is left but one primal science in the realm of
human knowledge—the science of Physics in
the widest sense, the science of things
natural, things as they are; and the
science of things dreamt of, dogmas invented,
baseless theories sent flying like stringless kites
into the domain of the imagination—the science of
Metaphysics —is in truth, if not in fact, as dead as
the. legendary cock that crowed to warn the
legendary Peter.
* • • m
All these centuries the metaphysicians have
been pokiiig the smoke ; the progress of physiology
has at last taught people—some people—to poke
the fire. Instead of reasoning from effects, it is
becoming more and more common to reason from
causes. And instead of losing himself in a maze
of words like “will,” “idea,” “concept,” “voli-
tion, ’ “ emotion, ” and so on, the scientist nowa-
days—the sensible scientist—scrutinises the mole-
cules of the brain, and learns what makes “ will,”
“emotion,” and the rest. The whole world of
psychology has practically been concentrated in the
microcosm of the skull. The germ of a brain re-
ceived from one’s parents, played on by all sights,
sounds, tastes, odours which reach it, works as
mechanically at any given moment as an engine
fashioned by men’s hands. There is no pin-hole
for chance to enter ; no break in the chain of law.
And from a complete knowledge of any brain and
its environment all dreams, actions, passions, can
more certainly, be predicated than from the steam-
power and burden, the shape and displacement of a
vessel, can be predicated its speed in a known water-
formingling and manglingterms and
definitions m relation to xis over. Every day
brings us more knowledge of the x in the cere-
brum, and long before the earth bursts or freezes
good brains will be cultivated like good oysters.
Unluckily, neither Kant nor Aristotle, nor a*ny
personal ghost of them, will be there to see.

In a recent number of Mind , W. McDougall de-
velops further the theory of the nervous system
and its development and centralisation in the
oerebrum. The figure here given in illustration is
not so cryptic as it looks. Roughly speaking,
McDougall, regarding the brain and spinal cord as
a reservoir of impressions inherited from ancestors
or acquired by the individual, suggests that the
central nerve-cells may be ranged practically in
masses one above the other. Roughly speaking, he
divides the house of the brain into storeys. On
the ground-floor of the spinal cord are accumu-
lated the very-old cells with the very-old impres-
sions transmitted in the progress of evolution from
the very beginning of life. In the cerebellum
first-floor one . might say there are held
the cells of impressions stored for us by
the experience of more immediate ances-
tors. And in the second and third floors of
the cerebrum and cortex there are the cells that
we ourselves have trained to duty, and the reserve
stock of cells on which we rely to grapple
with fresh impressions. This is very loosely
phrased, but it will serve to suggest a leading idea
of McDougall’s theory. And the lines in the
drawing show imaginary nerve-paths by which
sensation and motion are communicated from one
cell to another and to the external organs—the
periphery.
* * * *
' McDougall suggests in his drawing the inter-
dependence of the nerve-centres. The simple
automatic reactions are suggested by the
lines from S to M—sensory nerves to motor
nerves— on the first level. Perhaps half
the actions of our lives are performed on
this automatic level, with an immense saving
of wear and tear. Were our ears, for example,
not_ trained to pass insignificant sounds without
nofioe, the din of life would be insupportable.
Talking in a railway train, the rattlemf the cars
goes unheeded. The'bounds are faithfully re-
ceived, but they pass dff by the waste-pipe of the
automatic centres, without distracting the conscious
centres employed in thinking of tire conversation.
The complexity of sensations on the third storey,
where most of the conscious work is done, is
suggested by the more numerous nerve-paths
in the drawing. Aifd the educational lesson
of the whole is thaft during the youth of
every individual as many spheres of know-
ledge and action ,as possible should be' brought
under the oontrol of the automatic centres, so
that se can think and do those spheres with the
least possible expenditure of energy, reserving sis
nervous force for new ideas and unexpected situa-
tions. In the same way as a pianist can play and
sing at the same time, it is conceivable that a
well-endowed human being may compose a
poem, read a newspaper, resolve a chess problem,
invent an improvement in gold-saving appliances!

. ‘ Rolf Boldrewood ” has deliberately fallen on
evil days. Five years ago The Bulletin told
him that be was taking advantage of a confiding
public by trading on his reputation, and writing
fluent rubbish instead of taking pains. The truth
has slowly filtered down to English and American
critics, and his last two or three books have been
deservedly characterised as dull and flatulent
Says a recent Athenceum —
It is difficult to know what to say about the stories
“ A Romance of Canvas Town,” &c., by Rolf Boldre
wood (Macmillan & Co.). They are so elementary in con
struction that they almost defy criticism. In none o
them is there the slightest suggestion of inventiveness
they are incidents which probably happened, told with
some detail, but with very little point. But none the
less, as a social study, the book is interesting for it
obvious insight into life in the Australian bush. Adven
tures at the gold diggings or out sheep farming, the ditfi
culties of domestic service, and such like matters are tolc
with the air of a man who has experienced what he writes
about, and are brought out clearly before the reader. li,
is just the same quality, although on a slightly different
topic, that was displayed in “ Robbery Under Arms.”
That is mild in comparison with some recent
notices. Even the author of “ When the Mopoke
Calls,” who was puffed by his publishers as “a
nephew of ‘ Rolf Boldrewood ’ ” —whatever that
had to do with his quality — does not escape un-
scathed from the shower of dispraise ; and has
lost, rather than gained, by his advertised relation-
ship.
The development of the great English language
is fascinating to watch. Take an American re-
port of a baseball-match, verbatim :
Fifth Inning.— Brown netted two corners. Smith and
Jones nipped Robinson, but Thompson crossed the trocha.
Johnson caught Green’s liner. White banged a home-run.
Walker was grazed by a hot one and took his base.
M Carthy caught Weber’s boost. Two runs.
Second Half.—A grounder to Walker was the cause of
M Carthy’s demise. Walker and Green sent Smith to the
bench. Hill and Yale settled Brooks. No runs.
Sixth Inning.— Mills lifted an easy fly. Smith and
Johnson disagreed over Wilson’s high and he took two
bags. Richardson accounted for Wilkinson’s Steepler.
Bronson flied to Jones. No runs.
Second Half.—O’Rourke singled. Jones promenaded.
Hill pulled in M‘Carthy’s rise. Smith forced Jones
ORourke caught at third. Brooks knocked a homer
scoring Jones and Smith. Wilkinson walked. Smith
singled and took one more on error. Wilkinson tallied
Bronson stole third. Walker captured M‘Carthy’s lofty
foul. Three runs.
Spenser’s exemplar—
Dan Chaucer, well of English undefiled
On fame’s eternal bead-roll worthy to be filed—
should have lived hereafter, in order to write
“The Baseball Pitcher’s Tale.” What a heroic
record, with the slang to fill it with colour and
music !

Kipling’s satirical “praise” of Guy Boothbv
runs thus— J
Mr. Guy Boothby has come to great honours now. His
name is large upon hoardings, his books sell like hot
cakes, and he keeps a level head through it all. I’ve met
him several times in England, and he added to mv
already large respect for him. y
And Boothby’s publishers naively print this as
complimentary 1
Nathaniel Hawthorne.
Siok with a surfeit of new books, it is relief and
gloom at once to turn to Hawthorne. Latter-dav
literature deals so largely with the activities oi
life, the march of science, social problems anc
the parade of old thoughts in a new guise (skil-
fully arranged with intent to deceive), that the
world'grows tired of the multitudinous voices
though they be very varied in register and tone’
It is like walking m a market-place where huck-
sters cry their goods. And it is like turning
aside from the market-place to open Hawthorne-
like entering some grey cathedral where no sound
ol man s feet is anywhere, and the light from
great windows, made red and violet in transmis-
sion through the painted panes, reveals invisible
dust strangely glorified. Solemnity shadows one,
and though he may be in the world he is not of it
A supreme spell takes him in thrall, and grave-
eyed thoughts that have long hided in cloistral
corners steal out and look him in the eyes.
Q . Hawthorne .charms us with his, remoteness
Strange' to say, 'the endearing charm of Kipling
lies in his nearness. They occupy opposite poles
of enchantment. It would be hard to find two
other writers so altogether unlike in theme and
atmosphere. Kipling is intensely modern. He
stands on the bridge of the world and feels the
shudder and .the throb of the gigantic mind-
engine that is driving it onward— -sunward or
niglitward, who will say ? His must be new blood
fresh-made by nature.
On the other hand, and for Hawthorne, the
century displayed its treasures in vain. He had
only cold eyes for them. Men wrought and
thought, and bought and soldi even at his elbows
but his mission was not with them or their doings
Within himself was a sufficient world peopled
strangely. He drew the shadows from their lurk-
ing and gave them a theatre. That theatre was
not always the Past, but sometimes something
antiquely resembling it. Because he was so lonely
m the midst of life, so markedly out of date, so
vaguely apart, it is a wonder and a dream almost
to think on . him. His must have been very
ancient blood indeed, set running long ago when
the race was in the cradle.
Look into your own heart and write is good
advice, but difficult to follow. We are so strangely
fashioned that these eyes of ours have a truant’s
habits and wander where they list. Thus it is
tha,t nine of us out of every ten fail in inward
vision. The tenth is sometimes a Shakespeare or
a Hawthorne.
When Hawthorne sat down to write and turned
his eyes inward it was a grim and gloomy drama
that greeted them. Sm paced the scene with Ke-
morse in pursuit. Seldom is the red act or the
hot embrace presented as in Shakespeare. The
curtain lifts on the after-effect, the coming of Con-
science leading in, with one hand, the desire •
and, with the other, the fear of Expiation. So it
is m the 4 Scarlet Letter, ” the woman with the
c< A 55 on her garb and the child in her arms—the
punishment and the outcome of sin. Nowhere do
we get a picture of the love that went first—went
before the sin—sweetening existence even for a
little while.
Some say that Hawthorne made a novel where
he might have been content with a short story,
and gave to short-story themes sufficient for
majestic expansion. This is only saying that he
was not always a master of suggestion. Kipling’s
“End of the Passage” is more deeply laden with
intensity than anything Hawthorne has done.
Still, to say that his stories are unsuggestive is
not to deny suggestion to his style. It is replete
with side-effects. His stories are like corridors
twilit and paved with polished marble, down
which he leads us gravely pacing, and with a sense
of awe upon us. Here to our right his hand goes
out and a door swings wide, revealing a room full
of faded sunlight. There to the left a second
door grows ajar, and we catch a glimpse of a for-
gotten coffin heaped over with withered wreaths ;
and then, perhaps, we become seized and teased
with a desire to plumb the depths of hinted
mystery, and pause, and gaze, and go a-graping
till our eyes tire and our minds sink back abashed
with defeat. It was more than the coffin and the
faded wreath that the master intended we should
see; and the impressiveness and the exaltation
with which he displayed them cry out to kindred
feelings within us. This is how high imaginative
writing, such as Hawthorne’s, may make a Via
Dolorosa a way of roses, or the rosy way thorny,
and as you will.
Perhaps the sweetest writing of the language is
that in “Daniel Swan.” Certainly, if it is not
the sweetest, it is sweet as any other. It is a
clear pool, where blue and painted- skies lie
mirrored. Stevenson’s best seems turbid in
its neighborhood. Its diction is simplicity and
grace closely wedded. Its conception is familiar as
a dream, and yet as distant. It was gathered from
the frontier of the Communicable, far as the fet-
tered mind can stray.
The test of Art is m the persistence of the artist’s
work. In proportion to the amount of soul he
projects into the canvas soshall the result prosper,
even though Time make constant war on it.
Exquisite witness to Hawthorne’s soul and skill
and dramatic power is borne by the long galaxy of
scenes and faces that cling to the walls of our
memory. Put your mind in service and try how
many you can remember. There, for instance, is
Dimmesdale, sick with inward travail and very
pale, standing on the platform in the red, meteoric
light, his sin made manifest, as though God sat in
judgment. And there, again, in the Minister’s
Black Veil, see the Minister bending over the
dead maiden and—
“As he stooped, the veil hung straight down
from his forehead, so that if her eyelids
had not . been closed for ever, the dead
maiden might have seen his face. Could Mr.
Hooper have been so fearful of her glance that he
hastily caught back the veil ? A person who
watched the interview between the dead and the
living scrupled not to affirm that, at the instant
when the c-lerg.yman’s features'were disclosed, the
corpse had-slightly shuddered, rustling fhe shroud
and muslin cap, though ■'the countenance retained
the composure of death.”
And last, there is 'that great canvas in the
“ Unpardonable Sin,” with Ethan Brend on'the
hillside, pain in Ins heart and on his face the in-
tense light of burning marble.
Whatever place Hawthorne may occupy amongst
writers, he hr'certainly unique in English litera-
ture. And because he is original, graceful, and
intense, it is well to read him twice over at the
least. Butfstill, when all is said and done, there
are some needs he does not satisfy. The heart
cries out for heart-food—permanently hungry for
the milk of human kindness—groping for the
truth that makes the whole world kin, and desir-
ing over and above psychological introspection,
however deep and fine, a lighter communion, a
talk with ordinary individuals like Laura, and
Pen, and Olive, and Ethel, and all the other sim-
ple boys and girls and men and women that
Thackeray, good man, has given us.

Pis. ovi. IS,
*Tis well, ’tis well, in the lowest hell,
And I laugh at the lick of the fire ;
The flame roars up in its brimstone cup,
And it lives what lies on the pyre ;
They’ve done their worst for the man they cursed,
They’ve made damnation dire ;
But they can’t undo the joy I knew
When I knew my Heart’s Desire.
There’s one will scream and one blaspheme,
As they writhe in the molten mire,
And curse the earth that gave them birth,
And damn their dam and their sire;
It pleases the devils to watch their revels,
But I wake the devils to ire
When I burst into rhyme at the thought of tile
time
When I found my Heart’s Desire.
They wrench my back on a red-hot raok,
They comb my nerves with wire,
They poison with pain the blood of my brain,
Till the devils of devilry tire ;
They spit from above on the name of my Love,
They call my Love a liar,
But they can’t take away the dream of the day
When I won my Heart’s Desire.
So here in the hell it is all very well
And I’m snug as a beast in a byre,
The devils are beat by my thought of my sweet,
And a fig for the heavenly choir :
And blood scalds skin where the flame bites in :
But I like the warmth of the fire,
For it burns me through with the heat I knew
When I held my Heart’s Desire.
Oh Heart’s Desire, who art not by my side,
Whose Love, so sweetly lived, so strangely died,
Thro’ faltering, falseness, failure, and the fire
Be still for ever all my Heart’s Desire.

Anywise remawkable so fur as I can tell;

Thur were nutthink in ’er fice ter cause ’er pride,
O, Mrs. ’Odgson looked nutthink —’ad nutthink—

But wasn’t theer a kick-up when she died !
E’d ’is frien’s in, ite or nine—did it fine—sherry

Which fur" ’arf-a-thick-un I’d bin sad ter ’ave ter

An’ the childring ’ad black mittings, an’ thecorfin

And a verse was on the mournin’-card supplied ;
Though Mrs. ’Odgson saw nutthink—’eard nut-

They was very cormpliment’ry when she died.
Mournin’ coaches bein’ wide, they cud ride six

The ’earse ’ad plumes upon it, all were clawsy as

I watched ’ey ridin’ orf, like a torf—mide me corf
Ter think with all I’d done they’d never thought

Though I’d lent ’em things o’ mine, sich as cork-

They’d gort too grand ter offer me a ride,
O, Mrs. ’Odgson looked nutthink—’ad nutthink—

But she was the Queen o’ Sheber when she died.

IN CITY STREETS, 1898.
Yonder in the heather there’s a bed for sleeping,
Drink for one athirst, ripe blackberries to eat ;
Yonder in the sun the merry hares go leaping,
And the pool is clear for travel-wearied feet.
Sorely throb my feet, a-tramping London high-
ways,
(Ah ! the springy moss upon a northern moor !)
Through the endless streets, the gloomy squares
and byways,
Homeless in the City, poor among the poor !
London streets are gold—ah, give me leaves
a-glinting
Midst grey dykes and hedges in the autumn sun !
London water’s wine, poured out for all un-
stinting—
God ! for the little brooks that tumble as they
run !
Oh, my heart is fain to hear the soft wind blowing
Soughing through the fir-tops up on northern fells!
Oh, my eye’s an ache to see the brown burns
flowing
Through the peaty soil and tinkling heather-bells.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ In the Australian Bush and on the Coast
of the Coral Sea ” (Macmillans, London), is the
outcome of naturalist Richard Semon’s two years’
sojourn in Australia, Papua, and the M!oluccas,
and embodies such of his observations and im-
pressions as could not well have been fitted into
his more strictly scientific book upon the same
basis—now being published in parts. This less
formal work—pleasantly written and liberally
illustrated—will be of all the more interest
to Australians in that the author s cen-
tral zoologic purpose has not prevented him
from keeping his eyes about him generally,
with the result that Australia and Australians
come in for some very qandid though good-na.tured
criticism. To students of local natural history
this book will be of special value, as definitely
setting at rest certain vexed- questions in connec-
tion with Marsupialia and Monotremata.
The Free Minstrel.
« Now Hugo the minstrel was a proud man, and he
wandered through the Midlands, Kinging and seelang
favor of no man.” — Old Chronicle.
As a freeman I lived, as a freeman I boro me,
I never bent knee to the pomp of the proud.
And the guerdon I prized was the blue heaven
o’er me,
And I loved the stiff neck that no man ever
bowed;
No lands could I boast as my acres paternal,
No lackeys beset me, a supple-lmeed throng,
I was but as a bird in her freedom supernal—
No fortune was mine but a morsel of song !
And had I but done as I saw them all doing,
God wot!—l had never gone empty away ;
For Dives is deaf to no sycophant’s sueing
And he bends a glad ear to the adulant lay.
No voice could I venture to add to the clamour
Of clients who swept him in glory along,
And I sang as I laughed at his .glitter and
glamour —
“No fortune be mine but a morsel of song ! ”
The love of bright eyes that enthrals us and cap-
tures —
O sweet was your charm that I dared to discard !
For chains were ye weaving of roses and raptures
To fetter the wings of a penniless bard.
Yea, deep was the spell, but I rose and I reft
me —
(Forgive me, dear heart, if I did you a wrong);
’Twas the only resource that my Destiny left me
No fortune was mine but a morsel of song !
No fortune was mine but a musical measure
That sometimes ran o’er in a jubilant sea,
For the gods ever kind had entrusted a treasure
That burst from my breast in a song for the Free ;
And my melodies change at the will of the Sender
Now rising aloft in a strain for the strong,
Now dying adown in a love-lilt so tender —
No fortune is mine but a morsel of song !
Brisbane.
P. LUFTIG.
Villanelle.
They spoke of Love : the shadows fell
Upon the hills, and on the town ;
And Love was ill, or Love was well.
They followed Love—the wedding-bell;
The marriage gift; the bridal gown ;
They spoke of Love : the shadows fell.
And dallying, they turned to tell
Of grey old age, and tresses brown—
And Love was ill, or Love was well:
Or softly spake, with heart a-swell,
Of old regrets they could not drown—
They spoke of Love: the shadows fell.
They followed Love—the subtle spell
Through heart and soul, and up and down ;
And Love was ill, or Love was well.
They followed, from the jaws of hell
And on, and up to Heaven’s crown—
They spoke of Love : the shadows fell,
And Love was ill, or Love was well.

FRANCIS KENNA.
A Little Song.
Last night I heard a song you used to sing,
And like a dart it pierced me through and through,
For every note held memories of you ;
And in my ears the little plaintive thing
Rang all the evening—gas-lamps burning low
Changed into starlight, and the merry flow
Of conversation into murmuring
Of winds and waves, and sounds of long ago.
Dear little song! Dear love, throughout long
years,
Cold stars have shone alike on smiles and tears.
In my sad heart my love was buried deep,
And other loves have danced upon its grave ;
I thought it dead, but from its heavy sleep
The little song aroused it, and it gave
One startled cry—then the dear eyes of yore
Opened and gazed into my own once more,
Half smilingly, yet half-inclined to weep.
Dear eyes ! What fancy brought yours here to-
night ?
As blue as cornflowers, sweet, and starry bright !
And every fond word uttered then again
Arose, all trembling from the mist of years,
And fluttered towards me, echoing in my ears,
Twining itself about the simple strain ;
Vowing by all those hours of happiness,
Each lingering glance, each kiss and fond caress,
No more to sleep—but ever clear remain.
Dear tender words ! O, memories bright and fair,
All whispering in the sweet, pathetic air !
AIRLIE.

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
I through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and life
was an old man, Jeremiah and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Hoodie was heard as never
was heard before or since.

SATURDAY, APRIL 22, 1899.
The Pawnbroker of Salvation.
The crowd shouts ; and “ General ” Booth
advances to his platform-table. He talks,
jests, prays, deprecating and imprecating
alternately. His feet shuffle on the floor ;
his arms are flung out with the gesture of a
Jonah cursing Nineveh. He comes for-
ward, goes back ; is now on this side, now
on the other ; but it is when he is behind
his table, with body bent, face lowered, and
chin thrust forward, that you get the charac-
teristic impression of him. The O-glasses
on his eyes glitter in the light ; the O-cavity
of his mouth hangs between them, suspended
by that formidable Nose of all the world ;
and the audience may, if it chooses, interpret
the historic three-ball hieroglyph and under-
stand the man—the Pawnbroker of Salva-
tion.
* * * *
Salvation !—on earth and in “ heaven ” it
is charity—the charity of good deeds, the
charity of innocence sacrificed. Pawnbrok-
ing ! —the extortion of shekels ; the grinding
of the faces of the poor ; the uttermost
abyss of Business. The Salvation Army is
a charitable business, a business charity.
Luxurious living for the few at the top ; the
dry bread of self-denial for the toiling thou-
sands at the bottom. Free meals for the
starving—in exchange for clothes washed
and wood chopped ; homes for the homeless
—if they conform to the dogmas, sing the
hymns, and pray the prayers of the Army ;
and always the Business idea kept in view—
nothing for nothing, food and shelter in re-
turn for the expenditure of physical energy,
or the loss of mental self-respect. Every-
where and continually wealth being piled
up ; the sources of charity exploited to the
last doit and crumb ; a profit made on gene-
rosity, and sixty per cent, interest demanded
from every gift. Strike out the charity,
which gives and asks nothing in return ; and
leave the Business. The Salvation Army, as
an organisation, is a Business. “ General ”
Booth is justified of his Nose.
• • * •
A remarkable man, no doubt; with pro-
d gious energy, and organising talent, and
Ideas. He has his reward in that Power
which is worth to an ambitious man all the
virtues, all the vices. But it is Power
obtained at the expense of thousands who
starve and sweat in the shadow at the root
of the tree, that he may sit in the sunshine
at the top. The credit of the poor, sallow,
narrow-brained fanatic who slaves for him,
suffused by the glow of Faith, is not his
credit; the sacrifice of the female “cap-
tain ” or “ adjutant ” scouring the streets
to succor the weak and afflicted, living on
a crust‘that she may remit the uttermost
farthing exacted by “ head-quarters,” is not
his sacrifice ; the labor and prayers of enthu-
siasts reproving “vice,” aiding the “fallen,”
denouncing the “wicked”—these are not
“General” Booth’s labor and prayers. The
good that there is in the Army belongs not
to the Army, not to the “General,” but to
the humble soldier who sees the good, and
feels the good, and does the good. He is
the honest Fly whose entrails the huge
Spider sucks.
* • * *
The Salvation Army is a Business ; and
the business idea overshadows all else. No
comprehensive statement of its assets has ever
been published ; but they must be millions
sterling. Everything is sacrificed to the
Main Chance. In the chief cities of
Australia we see the Salvation carts col-
lecting, collecting, collecting—meat from
butchers, bread from bakers, contributions
in cash or in kind, contributions in clothes,
broken victuals, bottles, old bones, any-
thing. What can be sold is sold ; what
cannot, is eaten and worn and used by the
“officers” in the homes, and the poor
wretches who tenant them. Every branch
to be self-supporting; every branch to for-
ward to “ head-quarters ” its monthly dole ;
every branch to increase that dole by the
last penny that the unpaid labor of the
“savers” and the “saved” can produce.
The man who goes to a Salvation “ home ”
in Sydney gets work and food. If he stays
there a month, he gets—work and food.
When he departs, he is rarely richer for his
labor : he has existed for a month, that is
all. And, in nine cases out of ten,
his work has been worth twenty times
the value of the broken victuals given
to him between long prayers. The
“charity” of the Salvation Army is
the business-charity of starvation wages or
no wages at all. Its “religion” is the
business-religion of “head-quarters”—slave,
sell, starve, and send the Cash to “head-
quarters.” Its “god” is the Almighty
business man—“ General ” Booth.
* * * *
In the Australian country the Salvation
spectacle is even more saddening. Doubt-
less some of the “ officers ” of the Army are
mere fanatics, under the sway of religious
or sexual impulse ; bawling, banging, and
raving to no good end. But many—the
majority, maybe—are good, earnest men and
women, whose lives are patterns of true
piety, and whose bodies are daily thrown
under the wheels as the immense Jugger-
naut-car of the Army moves triumphantly
forward. Many of these poor creatures get
no wages ; or a shilling or two of pittance.
They have to “ live on the enemy,” get the
wherewithal to sustain life from charitable
contributions, and at the same time carry
on the charitable work which is the
Army's ostensible justification, and send
money to “ head-quarters.” In the country
towns humanity’s astonishing spirit of self-
abnegation is taken advantage of to the
fullest extent. The War Cry stimulates
the “soldiers” by publishing rival lists of
papers sold and moneys received by “ head-
quarters.” Some of the “ captains ” display
wonderful ingenuity in raising funds. And,
every now and again, upon a town which has
been “ organised ” into the payment of regu-
lar contributions, there descends a “Com-
missioner” or a “Major” announcing a
special week of self-denial and prayer. The
fountains of charity are drained to the last
drop; and the “Major” returns with beat
of drum and a big cheque to “ head-
quarters,” while the miserable “soldiers”
left behind wonder vaguely how they will
make their usual remittance, and sell their
War Crys, and subsist, in the desert where
the “head-quarters” locusts have eaten
every green blade of pence and ha’pence.
“ General ” Booth boasts that his
“colonies” are self-supporting. No won-
der ; when he gets his labor free. He
boasts that the Army prospers. No wonder;
since it is the sweating of flesh-and-blood
reduced to a science.
♦ * * *
How is it done ? By the erethism and
altruism of mankind, and by the Nose of the
“ General.” The Nose of the “ General ”is
its own interpreter, and needs no explana-
tion. The enthusiasm of the “soldiers”
depends upon many things. The Army sup-
plies them with excitement—that Hospital-
Saturday joy for which so many bored
women crave ; it gives them an occupation,
a career, and a sanctified aim. There is
always the heavenly bunch of carrots to lure
the donkey onward. Thousands of persons
—especially of women are everywhere
willing to live a life of mean labor now, that
they may ecstatically embrace the Spirit and
the Bride hereafter. Then there are the
flags, and drums, and shouting—the con-
sciousness of being a public personage—the
gratification of vanity in “saving a soul,”
or delivering an address, or achieving
the greatest sale of the War Crys,
or remitting the largest, or the third
largest, or the tenth largest contribution
to “head-quarters.” Then “civilisation”
has modestly suppressed the public exhibi-
tion of those rooted instincts which formerly
found vent in festivals of Aphrodite, or in
love-feasts, or in kermesses, and a dozen
similar orgies. The Salvation Army diverts
these impulses into religious channels, as
has been done by many “moral” organisa-
tions before it; but it gives them a field for
display more satisfying to weak intellects
than any other mode of religion is giving.
The Army soldieress, dancing and tambourin-
ing, is the modern Bacchante, and looks it.
“General” Booth uses a plough which
seems new, but he is merely ploughing the
same old human ground in the same old
furrow.
* * * •
Does the Army do any permanent good ?
Practically none. Doubtless many indivi-
duals have been temporarily bettered by
contact with its self-denying enthusiasts ;
but the system of the Army is always
more palliative than preventive. While
it draws from the service of the community
many men and women who might become
useful citizens, and wastes their time in pro-
menading the streets and collecting for
“ head-quarters,’’’ it gives the community no
equivalent of men and women turned from
evil lives to good. To come in close relation
with its methods as a recipient of relief is to
be mentally and physically deteriorated. And
this deterioration will never stop while
“ General ” Booth is allowed to teach, even
encouraged to teach, that the practice of
“ charity ” consists in building “barracks,”
and amassing funds, and acquiring landed
property, while paying no wages, or the
meanest wages, for labor, and doing little or
nothing to find independent places for its
proteges—-or victims—in the social machine.
Sydney against Australia.
Sydney against New South Wales, Sydney
against Australia :—that is the present and
final stage of the Federal conflict. It is a
straight-out, clean-cut issue. When the
Federal vote comes to be taken, New South
Wales electors will in fact be asked, “Do you
vote for a continuance and aggravation of the
Sydney tyranny ? Do you vote for a continu-
ance and extension of the Sydney monopoly ?
Or do you vote for the free development of
New South Wales ? Do you vote for Aus-
tralia ? ”
• * • m
This article is written for all Australians.
It is written for the New South Wales country
voters. And it is written for the Sydney city
voters who have sense enough to see that the
continual piling-up of bricks and mortar in one
spot of New South W 7 ales at the expense of the
whole province is a manace to the province and
the nation, that the continual spending of public
money in one spot at the expense of the whole
province is a menace to the province and the
nation, that the continual gathering of popula-
tion to one spot at the expense of the whole
province is a menace to the province and the
nation.
* * * *
The men on the land—and the men in the
Sydney streets; the struggling digger and
farmer and grazier—and the Sydney landlord ;
the men who are the backbone of the country,
and who fight drought and flood to win tlie
wealth of the country—and the Sydney civil-
servant who is a necessary or unnecessary
parasite on their industry ; —-which will you
vote for ? In N.S. Wales, and at the coming
contest, Federation is summed up in that.
* * * *
The anti-Federal agitation was begun in
Sydney ; it is sustained in Sydney ; and, please
Australia ! it will die in Sydney. The
centre and essence of the anti-Federal
agitation is the struggle to maintain and
extend the Sydney supremacy—at the cost of
N.S.W. country districts, at the cost of Aus-
tralia. Just as a cancer lives and thrives in
the body, sending out rootlets in all directions,
and drawing to itself all the strength of the
organism, so, in great part, does Sydney live
and thrive at the expense of the N.S.W.
coastal districts, at the expense of the centre,
at the expense of the West. It is a bitter jest
against the bush township that you can fire a
gun down its main street without danger to
anybody—because, by an unwise policy, the
industry and energy which should make that
township prosper have been sucked to Sydney.
There is a bitter jest against the country news-
paper—“ the country rag ” —and why ? because
the big Sydney paper has supplanted it, thanks
to free carriage by the State which charges
every other tradesman. There is a bitter jest
against the men who “go on the land,” and
why ? because Sydney has been so far subsi-
dised at the expense of the country districts
that to “go on the land ” is often to go into
hell.
* * * *
Sydney as a port will always take first place
in Australia ; but there is no warrant for the
extravagant expenditure of public money on
Sydney ; for draining 31 per cent, of the whole
population to Sydney ; for erecting enormous
Government buildings, filled with an enormous
staff of clerks, receiving and spending enormous
sums in wages, in Sydney. New South Wales
has lost the use of the population of Sydney as
servants of the community. They are masters
of the community ; they make and unmake
Ministries ; —instead of the country ruling
the capital, the capital rules the coun-
try. Every year, as the aggrandisement
of Sydney continues, the outlying districts are
proportionately impoverished. The more people
there are collected in Sydney, the more mouths
there are to feed, the more public money is dis-
pensed to help feed them. The backblocks are
defrauded in two ways. They are defrauded
of the money which should be spent, not in
feeding an unproductive population, but in as-
sisting the pioneers of productive industry.
They are also defrauded of the men who should
be the pioneers of industry, but who find that
employment is obtained under pleasanter con-
ditions in Sydney.
* * * *
Many good artisans, hence many valuable
citizens, are collected in and about Sydney, but
they do not all add value to their work ; many
of them add only price. And few or none of
them are primary producers ; that is, few or
none of them belong to the class on whom, in
the last resort, the strength of a nation de-
pends. While Australia has so much natural
wealth at disposal—while N.S. Wales has
minerals to dig, land to till—we want above all
things that as large a section as possible of the
population should be actual producers of wealth
—men who make grass grow and corn wave
where none grew before—not merely men who
take the raw product and enhance its commer-
cial worth. These have their place, too ; but
it is not the first, the most essential, place.
* * * *
The N.S.W. pyramid is tottering on its apex.
The population of Sydney—one town alone—is
417,000; of the whole of the rest of the pro-
vince, 906,000. The province is depending for
its life upon a comparative handful of pro-
ducers—and upon loan-moneys, with the inter-
est and the capital charged to posterity.
* * * *
That state of things cannot last. But the
nest of anti-Federalists in Sydney wish not
only to maintain, but to extend, the policy of
starving the country, starving the producers,
to bloat Sydney with men and money. New
South Wales does not want the Federal
capital at Sydney: Sydney is already far
too huge for the health and safety of the
province. New South Wales would be more
stable, more prosperous, with the popu-
lation of Sydney distributed over a dozen
towns, over a hundred districts. Sydney
is a great belly, which, according to old
iEsop’s fable, is starving the members, is steal-
ing from the country the blood and money
needed to make the country thrive.
* * * *
It is time to end all this. If the Federal
capital diverts enterprise and money and popu-
lation from Sydney, so much the better. New
South Wales comes first. Australia comes
first. And every man in N.S. W. who has the
interests of the province at heart, every man
in Australia who has the interests of the nation
at heart, will vote in the coming contest against
Sydney—for N.S. Wales and Australia !
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Oriental Express.
When the Commonwealth gets on its legs—and
the eagerness of prospective Ministers and
Judges will now, no doubt, consummate Fede-
ration in record time—the traditional brilliancy
and scintillating genius of Australian P.M.G’s
will at last have a fair field of operation. The
Commonwealth will, of course, in taking over
the postal services, make the mail-contracts
with the steamship companies. And in this
connection the possibility presents itself of
radical changes in the mail-routes, which may
reduce the present time of journey to Europe
by one-half. A divergence of the transconti-
nental line from Port Darwin through Queens-
land (so as to pass through good country and
to tap the termini of the great trunk-lines from
the east coast) would not materially lengthen
the journey, even from Adelaide, and would
bring the Northern Territory into direct rail-
way communication with the chief towns of
Australia. Linked by such a railway to the
masses of our population, its splendid harbor
opening out direct to the swarming East with
its enormously expanding trade, Port Darwin
must become the great entrepot for European
and Eastern mails and passengers, and bids
fair to rival Sydney, at the other extremity
of the line, as a strategic and commercial
centre. By an express steamship service, such
as now runs between Brindisi and Port
Said, the distance between Port Darwin and
the new Siberian railway terminus should be
covered in a day or so over the week. The
Russian engineers anticipate the opening of
the railway next year and promise to send
passengers across the two continents in eight
days—making little more than a fortnight
from our northern port. In the south of Asia
schemes are already mooted for connecting the
Indian system through Persia with the railways
under construction from Constantinople towards
the Persian Gulf, and the Burmese railways are
creeping down the Malay Peninsula to Singa-
pore. Give eight days for the railway journey
from Singapore to Calais via Calcutta and
Constantinople and five days for the water
journey ; we can luxuriously travel by a short,
smooth ocean route from Port Darwin to
Singapore, skirting the matchless scenery of
those “ summer isles of Eden,” and finish by a
railway trip which packs the wonders of the
world into a week. Two days will reach every
important Australian centre from Port Darwin.'
So we will get our London news in a fortnight,
and can take our choice of looking in on either
the Czar or the Sultan for the Christmas holi-
days. These considerations will serve to show
the value to the Commonwealth of the Northern
Territory. Its transfer from the control of
S.A. to that of the Commonwealth, so far from
being the burden on the national finances which
desperate anti-Federalists predict, is certain to
endow the nation with an asset of enormous
value. We may be devoutly thankful that
Northern Australia has so far escaped the
chartered companies and gridiron syndicates
whose greedy maw has several times opened for
the gulp.
A Victorian Draco.
The sentences recently passed by Judge Gaunt
at Melb. Gen. Sessions once more demonstrate
the extreme variability in the incidence of
punishment, according to the personality of
Judges. It is surely a gross scandal on Justice
that an offence which at the previous Ci iminal
Sessions had been adjudged by the then pre-
siding Judge as expiable by 6 months’ “ hard,”
should be next month punished by a sentence
twelve times as severe. Judge Gaunt’s liver, or


gall, or something, made him ladle out to 10
prisoners (housebreaking, horse-stealing and
grievous bodily harm) an aggregate of 46 years
hard labor, trimmed with 64 weeks of
“solitary” and, in the case of the “bodily
harm,” with a solatium of 15 lashes thrown in.
This last—bar the flogging —was perhaps a step
in the desirable direction of punishing
offences against the person as severely
as those against property; but in several
of the other cases the severity of the
sentences moved the prisoners to astonished
protest from the dock; one—who got five
years, with nine weeks’ solitary, for stealing a
few articles of clothing—remarking that a man
would not get any more “ for putting a woman
in a boot-trunk.” His Honor, on the other
hand, displayed some consideration for a rheu-
matism-crippled old man, convicted of horse-
stealing—observing that the man was fitter for
benevolent asylum than eaol ; but nevertheless
inflicting next day—after receiving a medical re-
port on thecase —thetriflingsentence of lOyears !
In answer to another prisoner’s question, the
Judge said that he was wellawarethat“solitary”
meant also bread-and-water. “ But in all my
long experience,” he added, “ I have never
known it do a man in perfect health any harm.”
Which is sweetly consoling to a wretch who has
to undergo nine weeks’ starvation of body and
mind—a week at a time. Also, it is satisfac-
tory to learn that the “ long experience” of a
well-fee’d and well-fed lawyer qualifies his
opinion to outweigh that of medical and scien-
tific experts the world over. Even without the
starvation diet, a single week’s solitary is a
punishment which few men can undergo with-
out more or less permanent damage ; and thus
to prescribe repeated doses of it is to run a
great risk of manufacturing permanent idiots.
There is a crying need for such a systematisa-
tion and regulation of the sentence-administra-
tion plan as shall prevent an atrabilious public
servant from thus venting his gall upon the
wretches delivered into his judicial hands.
But Draco dies hard in Australia. The Trail
of the System is over us still !
The Lamenting Lyne.
When Anti-Australian Lyne was in office, he
was—from the point of Public Principle —as
dodgy a politician as they make. It is, there-
fore, quite the proper political caper that Lyne
should be moved to indignant tears —and a
letter to Sydney Telegraph —by the latest
Federal move of Premier Reid. To appease
the blind wrath of the Anti-Australian little
Sydney party, and, as it were, to take
the rough edge off the clause in the
Federal Enabling Bill which enacts that
the Federal Parliament shall meet tem-
porarily in Melbourne “ until it meets at
the seat of Govt.” in N.S. Wales, Premier
Reid, the other day, pointed out that, in spite
of that clause, the Commonwealth would pro-
bably be administered in N.S. Wales, and
therefore in Sydney, from the very outset.
That is likely enough. That the Federal Par-
liament sits in Melbourne temporarily does not
mean that the departmental work is to be
performed there. As it is to be permanently
done in N.S. Wales, Premier Reid is, probably,
right in thinking that some of it—perhaps a
large part of it—will be done in N.S. Wales
from the beginning, and, therefore, will be
done at Sydney. Details are still so much in
the clouds that even Premier Reid couldn’t
commit himself definitely ; but if convenience
and economy are to be studied, his sugges-
tion is sure to have a good deal of founda-
tion. Even if it has not, the anti-
Australian indignation is just as baseless as the
suggestion. There are two things made certain
by the Bill—N.S. Wales is to have the capital,
and Parliament is to sit in Melbourne while the
capital is being got ready. Beyond that all is
conjecture ; and the Australian conjecture is
just as good as the Anti-Australian, and ap-
parently a little better. Even if the
worst comes, and the Sydney sponge sucks up
no more wealth and population than it does at
present, there may be a consolation in reserve
for the Sydney party. The Governor-General
can live where he pleases ; and, of course, he
will live more or less in Sydney. He would
never think of dwelling all the time among
“ thieves and robbers.”
Left Stinking.
At South Melbourne Court, last week, one
more attempt—probably the last of the series
to make the Law do its duty in the smellful
Dungey-Bromley case was promptly sup-
pressed by a brazen police-magistrate named
Keogh. The appeal this time was for a proper
judicial consideration of the evidence as re-
gards Mrs. Bromley only, all hope of achieving
a verdict against policeman Dungey having
been abandoned by the private prosecution.
The Law, in the persons of magistrate
Panton and Judge Hodges, had made such
a bold, unblushing demonstration in favor
of its minion Dhngey, that the prosecutor
decided to leave him sniggering under the
Law’s wing, and proceed against his female
accomplice, Bromley. The woman, as every-
body knows by now, did shamelessly bait with
her body the “trap” which Dungey planned
for the capture of two alleged abortionists, and,
seeing t hat it was a crime for woman Bromley
to incite a criminal act, she could not possibly
escape a verdict of guilty except through a
gross miscarriage of justice. Keogh, P. M.,
and his attendant honorary magistrates effected
the miscarriage, and Mrs. Bromley, The Bul-
letin supposes, is finally relieved of the trouble-
some consequences of her crime. Keogh,
P.M., refused to administer the Law that
he is paid to administer. The woman’s
legal guilt was laid before him, but he brushed
it aside, as Panton, P.M., had done before
him, and practically spat in the face of Justice
when he said, not that the woman was inno-
cent of the crime charged against her, but that
“ the bench were unanimously of opinion that
the case should be dismissed.” Three men,
thus far, stand convicted by public common
sense of deliberate wrong-doing on behalf of
Dora Bromley —or, rather, on behalf of the
Crown Law Department which sanctioned the
scandalous Dungey-Bromley trap. Panton,
P.M., Judge Hodges, and Keogh, P.M., can
be denounced as a trio of unjust stewards,
and The Bulletin cordially denounces them.
Their intentions may have been honorable: the
immorality of their action is beyond doubt.
They may pretend to find justification for it in
the silence— mostly approving silence—of the
people whose laws they are sworn to administer
without regard to distinction of persons ; but
the fact that all people, Victorian or other-
wise, are mostly fools is none the less regret-
table because Panton, Hodges and Keogh
have thought fit to impose upon their ignor-
ance and stupidity.

Bull’s Paw on N.S.W. Mines.
The most debatable of the provisions which
N.S.W. Chamber of Mines has asked the Minis-
ter to incorporate in his new mining code, pro-
mised first thing next session, is the abolition
of the old-established labor-covenants in leases.
The Chamber, accepting the advice of several
J. Bull visitors, asks that things shall be all
right if the holder spends on land held under
gold-lease “ at least <£lso annually for each five
acres, or fraction of five acres (that is to say,
.£2250 for such area during the first 15 years of
the lease ”), and as to land held under mineral
lease “£5 per acre during the first three years
of the term, and during the remainder of the
term at least £5 per acre per annum.” This in
lieu of the continuous employment of two, three
or four men, as the case may be. Also, “ the
excess expenditure in any one year above the
amount required shall be carried to the credit
of, and go in reduction of, the necessary ex-
penditure for succeeding years of such 15 years’
lease.” Further, it is proposed that holders of
current leases may convert their holdings into
leases with the new conditions; and if any
leaseholder “ can prove an expenditure in
excess of that prescribed by the new conditions
he shall be entitled to be credited with any
such excess.” So mining co’s in a district with
a wage-reduction in view could crowd on men,
and in three months comply with the condi-
tions for three years ; they could then tell the
men to call round when they felt hungry. For
their part, the workmen would have plenty of
time to refresh their memories regarding a
time when many a lessee was unable to carry
out his threat of a lock-out on account of his
covenant to continuously employ a certain
number of workmen. And, anyhow, apart
from all considerations of strikes and lock-outs
and wage-cuts, Labor’s worst affliction', or one
of its worst, is an uneven market; and the con-
ditions which it is proposed to substitute for
the old ones are particularly well calculated to
produce unevenness. For share-market pur-
poses the new idea is most beautiful; but the
stock-jobber is hardly the most important
purpose in the mining industry yet, in spite of
the No-Liability Act and some others.
Sixpenny Kerosene.
Police-magistrate Panton bluntly asserts that
“ the main cause of the prevalence of drunken-
ness (in Victoria) is the want of proper super-
vision over public-houses. There are Govern-
ment inspectors of liquor, but a better class of
men is needed, and the inspection of liquor
should be more persistent.” As a matter of
fact, the Government takes next to no measures
whatever to protect the stomachs of hotel-
drinkers from the slow-poisoning policy of
rapacious licensed victuallers. The Excise
officers who visit hotels at rare intervals to
sample the stock are chiefly concerned in look-
ing after the interests of two or three agents
for certain makes of brandy and schnapps
-—and a whisky or two occasionally. If
the bottles that bear these particular brands of
spirits are found to contain a spurious article,
a prosecution of the pub-keeper will not im-
probably result, on behalf of the firms in-
terested. The Excise officers receive an annual
fee for this service, and are expected to give
their private employers some return for their
money. The Government, seemingly, is quite in-
different as to the wholesomeness, or otherwise,
of hotel drinks in general. At many of the
small, disreputable pubs, there isn’t a bottle of
unpoisoned liquor on the premises, and an un-
wary stranger, walking casually into one of
these licensed hells for a glass of whisky, stands
a chance of losing consciousness right away.
He is lucky if he is able to reel forth into the
street and hang on to the nearest lamp-
post until he feels capable of seeing him-
self home. Certain theatre bars have a
reputation for selling “ whiskies ” that
are criminal libels on the characters of
their alleged brands. In one case, Surgeon
Fitzgerald —being served with a dose of kero-
senic stimulant between the acts—caused the
yellow hair of the Flossie behind the bar to
stand on end, “like quills upon the fretful porcu-
pine,” by threatening to expose the awful
wickedness of the business she was aiding and
abetting. The Government knows about these
scandals. Members of the Government will
stand before a bar and candidly comment on
the atrocious fraudulence of the stuff they are
paying sixpence for, yet the years roll on and
never a legislator rises from his soft seat in
Parliament to propose an honest supervision of
the liquor-traffic. One hears Parliamentary
outcries against patent-medicines, because the
medical faculty, which objects to “ illegiti-
mate ” doctoring, is largely represented in the
’Ouse, but inasmuch as poisonous whisky sends
hundreds of patients to the consulting-room,
the faculty has nothing in particular to say
against that.
An Anti-Federal Bogey.
The most comical anti-Federalist this paper has
met with so far is one “T.M.,” who says he
has discovered something too terrible for words,
and is actually allowed to fill a column of
S.M. Herald over it without editorial remon-
strance :
It being too serious a matter to vote blindfolded a
second time, I determined to examine the Bill section by
section ; and I must confess the more I read it the more
clearly do I see that there are quite a number of its
clauses impracticable, contradictory, and unjust, and
others through which there will not, I think, be much
difficulty in driving the proverbial coach and horses.
Everyone seems to suppose that as South Australia has
female suffrage, only half the number of votes recorded
there will be counted in an election there for members of
the Federal Parliament, until, if it should so unfortunately
happen, all the other colonies have a similar disad vantage;
bur. on a close examination of the Bill I find that t his is
by no means so, for immediately the Commonwealth
Bill becomes law the full number of votes cast there,
male and female, will have to be reckoned. South
Australia, therefore, will have double the votingstrength
of any other State, which other sections in the Bill prove
beyond question. It is only when, if at any time it may
be proposed in the Federal Parliament to alter the Con-
stitution of the Commonwealth in other matters, that
only half her total number of votes will count (see section
127 and its heading). Another (section 30) says: “The
qualification of electors of members of the House of Re-
presentatives shall be in each State that which is pre-
scribed by the law of the State ” ; and as by the law of
South Australia females arc entitled to vote, they cannot
be deprived of it, or the suffrage there in any way
restricted. Not only so, but section 41 gives this’ right
in the most absolute form and for ever, for it reads :
“No adult person who has a right to vote shall be pre-
vented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at
elections for either House.’’ So that it actually becomes
part of the contract with South Australia that no law,
even of the Commonwealth, may ever halve the count
there, except in an election solely for the purpose of
altering the Constitution ; in that case, and in that alone,
will only half the total votes count.
Only by inexcusable negligence could such sections as
these have got inserted in the Bill, and the most chari-
table construction I can put upon this neglect of duty by
our Federal Ten is, that they must have been dozing to
have allowed South Australia to have stolen such amarch
upon them by the insertion of so monstrously unfair an
exception.
According to the Commonwealth Bill the
number of representatives for each province is
to be fixed according to population, so S.A. will
get just the same number of representatives in
the Federal Parliament whether it has male
suffrage, or male and female suffrage, or dog
suffrage, or no suffrage at all. And when a
referendum is on, so that the vote of all
Australia has to be taken, it is expressly stipu-
lated by clause 127 that the woman-vote of S.A.
won’t count unless all the States have a woman-
vote also. But what harasses the anguished
“T.M.”is that when S.A. is electing its own
members —the same seven Representatives and
six Senators that it would have in any case—it
will, by reason of the woman suffrage, elect
them by twice as large a vote as it otherwise
would. And a Federal member from S.A. will
represent 106,000 voters (men and women),
while a Federal member from N.S.W. will re-
present only 53,000 (men only). And the
frantic anti-Billite who fills a column in the
Herald thinks that somehow the one member
returned by 53,000 men and 53,000 women will
have twice as much voting power in the Com-
monwealth Parliament as the one member re-
turned by 53,000 men only. “ T.R.” examined
the Bill “ section by section ” to dig out this
strange lunacy. Truly, Australia is mostly
governed by One-Fool-One-Vote.
On a Poetic Isle.
The beautiful poetic theory about the evils of
city life and the good results to be expected
from a simple natural existence face to face
with Nature, receives a bad knock from a
recent official report on the state of Pitcairn
Island. The Pitcairn Islanders lead the simple,
natural existence in all its beauty. There is
no dusty city thereabouts ; no big red-brick
factories, no looms, no ’buses or tram-cars, no
beer, policemen, theatres, dog-fights or boxing-
saloons, no ribald push rolling home on
Saturday nights, no tea, coffee, horse-races,
welshers, totes, tarts, Flossies, oyster-suppers
—no nothing. It is practically the simplicity
of the early chapters of Genesis over again—
plenty of food, a fair green isle, a fair blue sea,
pure air, no worry, and the stillness of an
eternal Sabbath in the air. The restfulness
and peace which eat into your bones are all
there. And Captain Dyke, of H.M. ship
Comus, reports that this happy, primitive com-
munity is fast qualifying for an idiot-asylum.
There have been three deaths in eighteen
months, and two of them were murders—
two murders in eighteen months among 149
people is a rather steep percentage. The
people have no literature, and refuse to accept
any. “ They do absolutely nothing all day ”
save loaf and look with a cow-like eye at the
blue and green immensity of things. The
island swarms with cocks and hens, and the
inhabitants live on them and fish and vege-
tables, and the battle of existence is practically
non-existent; anybody who can run fast enough
to overtake an egg can make some kind of
living at Pitcairn. The look in the faces of all
the grown-up inhabitants is one of tired
vacancy ; they are weak in intellect, with no
conventional morals worth speaking of, and
the general tendency seems to be a drift
towards unanimous inbecility. Questions have
to be put even to the more intelligent of the
adults in the simplest language, and in a
slow, impressive fashion to evoke an answer,
and even then the questions have to be
about fish, or hens, or vegetables, or some other
easily-understandable subject. The children,
going a step further than their elders, appear
to be developing a gibberish language of their
own. Through some curious process of evolu-
tion or decadence nearly all the women shed
their front teeth at an early age. The only ex-
citement is a slow, long-enduring and seem-
ingly harmless feud between the two principal
families —otherwise they are only a bow'ed and
gradual community much given to prayer. If
the world would agree to leave Pitcairn abso-
lutely alone for a century, and then a deputa-
tion of scientists would call there to see how the
community had mooned along in the interval,
it would be an interesting experiment in evolu-
tion.
Dear Bulletin. —The beautiful working of
N.S.W. Health Regulations! In a country
town recently scarlet fever was epidemic, and
as soon as a fresh case was reported to the
police the latter served upon the head teacher
of the public school a notice requiring that
none of the children of that family be allowed
to attend school until another notice should
have been received, advising that the house,
clothing, &e., had been properly disinfected.
But the children thus kept from school never-
theless freely mingled in their pastimes with
the children it was intended to protect, and
also attended with them the different Sunday-
schools ; and, on attention of police being
directed to latter fact, they sorrowfully ob-
served that “a Sunday-school is not a school
within the meaning of the Act.” They could
do nothing about the Sunday-school, and neither
the parents nor sin-shifter w'ould do anything.
—T.J.
Telegraph talks (April 12) of “the
Anti-Hill party, the party that has set itself
resolutely against having thisparticular measure
rammed down the throat of the country.” Said
“ramming down” consists in offering the
J ill to the country to take or leave, just as it
chooses, and just as every other Bill, policy,
Ministry, or candidate whatever is offered to
the country. The electors vote on the whole
Hill just as they vote on the whole John
tUYNEs. Every individual elector can’t tinker
the Bill to his own notions any more than
every individual elector of Wellington can tin-
ker John Haynes. Plenty Wellington electors
may object that John Haynes’s manly figure is
too Japanese-junk-like and wide in the beam
tor Grecian beauty, but they’re not allowed to
hack nine inches off his waist and vote for the
rest of him—John Haynes is “ rammed down
their throats” all standing. “You’re ill,”
say the Federalists to the country; “ here's
your medicine : take it or leave it, but please
yourself.” And “You’re ill,” say the Anti-
Billites; “ but we’ll take jolly good care you
don t get the offer of medicine ! We love you so
much that we’ll smash the bottle beforehand.”

At Beaufort (Vic.) the local schoolmaster was
recently charged by a small girl-scholar with
having indecently assaulted, her and another
little girl in the school, before the whole class.
Other witnesses, however, deposed that the
12-year-old prosecutrix was an habitual liar,
besides being very dull and stupid, and some of
her class-mates testified positively that there
had been no such conduct as described. Also
the sweet innocent herself, in cross-examina-
tion, admitted that she would say anything to
do the teacher harm, as she didn’t like him !
And, finally, the other girl utterly denied that
she had been treated with any indecency,
whereupon accused was discharged without
being called upon for any defence. The unfor-
tunate schoolmaster will probably continue to
teach precocious and prurient girls as long as
his luck lasts ; when that fails he will probably
go to gaol on some other such trumped-up
charge. The Indecent Small Female is a very
serious menace to mankind in Australia.

Dear Bulletin.—ln offering a prize of j 67 10s.
last year for the best exhibit of dried fruit
N.S.W. Govt, stipulated that there should be
ten distinct varieties, each to represent half-a-
ton. To do this it would have been necessary
to treat about 40 tons of green fruit, at a cost
of £l5O, besides another £5O to £7O for subse-
quent treatment, and as no one in his senses
would attempt to fulfil such conditions, there
was no entry ; with result that this year there
is no prize offered. Contrast this with Govt,
treatment of the dairying industry, which year
after year has a £5O prize awarded for an
exhibit that costs about £5, and with no stipu-
lation about any stock of same quality behind.
This, too, in spite of the fact that, as there is
no import trade in butter to be competed with,
the industry is well established and able to
take care of itself without Govt, assistance.
With Federation pending, this should be a real
live question with any chap that wants to
“ save the country ” anywhere off the stump.—

Concerning N.S.W. Postmaster-General Var-
ney Parkes’ new parcels-insurance system :
Ed. Bulletin.—P.M.G. Parkes has solaced himself for
his defeat by the holy how lers over the Sunday work-
question by the introduction of a parcels-insurance
system, regulated by a number of cumbrous and clumsily-
drawn rules printed on the back of the “ Certificate of
Insurance.” Now, as, under the N.S.W. system of treat-
ing parcels in the same way as registered letters, the
loss of the former is almost unknown, this new' idea of
extorting revenue is both ridiculous and unfair. Of the
sapience of the rules let No. 13 serve as an example.
This provides that “no compensation shall be given
where the loss arises from flood, tempest, shipwreck,
earthquake, war, or other causes beyond control.”
Which simply means that the “compulsory insurance”
protects sender only against the dishonesty of postal
officials. Another item : “ A fee of 6d. will be collected
on every uninsured parcel received from the U.K. which
is found to contain jewellery of any description.”
That is after the parcel has safely made its long
journey. P.M.G. Parkes actually fines the re-
ceiver 6d. because the sender did not insure it against
loss by dishonest postal officials. Another rule sets forth
that “ over-insurance is a bar to compensation ” ; so that
for a postmaster to get a fair estimate of the value of,
say, a parcel of lady’s underwear which sender wishes to
insure for £lO but which he, the postmaster, considers is
but worth £5, he must separately examine and appraise
every article in the parcel. At this rate, the services
of an expert valuator will be needed in each P.O.
Also, many persons who insure their parcels will
find that on receipt at other end the most valuable portion
of the contents has vanished, and, as only a personal
examination of the parcel and a checking of the invoice
by the receiving postmaster can block mysterious disap-
pearance of valuables which were never enclosed, this
precious insurance system opens up a particularly invit-
ing door to dishonesty.—Bargo.
The N.S.W. anti-Federal platform:-
1. That the Federal capital shall be Sydney.
2. That all contracts for Federal buildings, &c., shall be
carried out by Sydney firms.
3. That all Federal positions shall be filled by Sydneyites,
and no other than a Sydneyite shall carry on any business
within the Federal confines.
4. That N.S. Wales i.e., Sydney shall have a repre-
sentation in the Federal Parliament equal to that of all
the other provinces combined.
5. That any Sydneyite who doesn’t like w'ork shall be
comfortably supported out of the Federal revenue.
6. That N.S. Wales shall be allowed to divert or lock the
Australian rivers wherever she pleases, and throw the key
overboard if she desires.
7. That the Braddon clause shall be removed, and a fresh
scheme of taxation, under which N.S. Wales shall have
the right to contribute as much or as little as she pleases,
shall be forthwith drafted by Damchieago Dibbs and John
Haynes.
8. That, if these resolutions be not at once accepted by
the other small and inconsiderable provinces, then the
landlords of Sydney and their claqueurs pledge themselves
to remove, with All their goods and chattels, from Aus-
tralia, which shall for ever after be accursed.
Maoriland’s extended municipal franchise
system comes into operation after. April 14.
There are to be three qualifications for enrol-
ment, as against one previously—ratepayers’,
freeholders’, and residential occupants’. The
freeholder must possess land of a capital value
of ,£25, but he can’t exercise a ratepayer’s and
a freeholder’s vote too. The residential occu-
pant must be a three-months resident of the
borough, and pay a rental of at least £lO
per year for private house, warehouse, office or
shop. If a husband is entitled to a vote, his
wife may cast one on the same qualification,
and vice versa. But only ratepayers and free-
holders can vote on questions of borrowing.
This broadened franchise will probably revolu-
tionise civic government locally, and it badly
needed readjustment.

The present production of “Othello” is
so good that it ought to stand for another fort-
night. Rignold has seldom been seen in a finer
character than that of the Moor of Venice. His
conception of the part is on all-fours with Cole-
ridge’s, who insists that mere, vulgar jealousy was
not the point in Othello’s passion. It was rather
an agony that the creature, whom he had believed
angelic, with whom he had garnered up his heart,
should be proved impure and worthless. It was,
says S.T.C., the struggle not to love her. It was
a moral indignation and regret that virtue
should so fall, combined with a feeling of out-
raged honor, tfiat drove him to Desdemona’s slay-
ing and his own suicide. “ There is no ferocity
in Othello ; his mind is majestic and composed.”
By the way, Rignold over-stains his Moorish
countenance. Coleridge considers that Othello
must not be conceived as a negro; but a high and
chivalrous Moorish chief. The Moors were ori-
ginally Arabs, a Semitic race ; and Rignold’s
almost-woolly wig is incorrect. Besides, why does
he stab, after smothering, Desdemona ? The text
gives no warranty for this. Rignold should never
play melodrama ; Diver should never play any-
thing else. The lago of the latter is foppish and
jerky, and his villainy too obvious—a bandbox
Mephistopheles—despite its facile cleverness. His
finesse would not deceive anybody. lago was a
large man of imposing presence, and a bluff, hearty
manner; a soldier, all apparent frankness and
easy good nature. lago is a comedy part, Tither-
adge would play it almost ideally.
* • * •
Theatre-goers who know their Shakespeare,
grumble about excisions, forgetting that without
them it would be impossible to stage a single
Shakespearian play. Whoever produces Eliza-
bethan drama must edit largely. Rignold may,
perhaps, be blamed somewhat for the trend of the
editing that carves at the other characters rather
than his own. But what is the use of being a
potentate if you cannot do what you like ? "The
Sydney press doesn’t rapturise over Rignold as it
did over Wilson Barrett, but ■ artistically Barrett
isn’t in the same histrionic street with the local
man. One thing, moreover, it doesn’t waste
commendation upon the splendid scenery, to wit,
from the brush of artist Phil Goatcher.

When Miln was playing some ten years
ago at Melbourne Opera House “Othello” was
produced with a novel attraction. One night
“G.C.M.” played the title-rdle, and Dam pier
played lago. Next night Miln played lago, and
Dampier the Moor. The scheme worked splen-
didly, and ensured double bookings by everybody
interested in either actor. The crowd rolled up
eagerly to see if “ the other fellow ” was able to
down its own man in one or the other part. Of
course, Diver as Othello is not an alluring propo-
sition.

Napoleon Bonaparte is still impersonating
Robert Brough at the Sydney Royal, and shirking
the responsibility of paying his antediluvian laun-
dry-account. ‘ ‘ Madame Sans-Gene ” ought about
to sound the knell of the First Empire boom.
When the dramatist worries a hero into the
depths of a clothes-basket, and clear-starches his
frayed linen to the fitful moaningsof the clarionet,
it is about time to fold up the Sunday shirt of his
glory and put it away for gala use in the historic
locker. No emperor is a hero to his blanchisseuse.
Talking about clothes-baskets, the threatened pro-
duction of “ The Merry Wives of Windsor, ” at the
Criterion, will raise memories of the great Brough-
aparte, for there is no end of dirty linen and
washerwomen repartee in the Shakespearian
comedy. Anyhow, Madame Sans-Gene takes a
well-earned rest from the labors of the washtub
and the malapropisms of a laundry-built Duchess,
on Friday, and the 22nd will witness the produc-
tion at the Royal of “ Lord and Lady Algy.” So
far, the Brough season in Sydney looks as if it
were going to hum. The houses have been so
good that Brough considers his opening fortnight
has brought along the record two weeks’ business
of his managerial career.

The Tivoli has burgeoned forth with a new
relay of artists. Perhaps the foremost of the
fresh-comers is Mr. Manuel Wilson, a contor-
tionist with novelties of muscle torture. His
characteristic is speed, the eye being unable to
follow the rapidity of his movements with any
degree of certitude. His turn is performed on a
white cloth, which gives it a cameo-like aspect.
The three Keziahs are ladder-trick artistes, neat
and clean in their performance, though perhaps
not very novel. Then there are Miss Edith
Conley and Geo. W. Carew, serio-comic singers,
sketeh artists and dancers. They are good of
their kind, and fairly replace Bellman and Moore,
who introduced to Sydney the refined musical
sketch, sans high-kicking and knock-about vul-
garities.

The Woman of Destiny has continued to
wave her knife wildly in the limelight at the
Lyceum. But the days of her eloquent madness
are numbered. The Union Jack and the reaping-
machine and the red sunsets and the blue seas and
the realistic steamer and all the pomp and circum-
stance of the glorious British Empire retire to
make room for “Man’s Enemy” which, we sup-
pose, is a euphemistic method of nominating the
“cursed drink”; and which, no doubt, will be
somewhat similar to “ Our Guardian Angel ”
only more so.

“Round the World in Eighty Days”
ceased from its cyclonic sprinting on the 15th
inst., and the Sydney Opera House will re-open
on the 29th with musical comedies. By the way,
the owners of the earth-circuit piece had better
hustle round and get as much as possible out of it
while the title is decently modern in its applica-
tion.- With the invention of steamers that put
up records of 40 miles an hour already on the
bounding main, the day is not far distant when
the achievement of Jules Verne’s hero will be a
very small affair. The present century is doing
all it knows how to beat Puck’s fastest—4o
minutes.
s[£
Fitzgerald’s Circus is still profitably in the
same place, and a great joy fills the heart of the
“ Zoologiseher ” gardens ; likewise the tiger has
not yet gastronomised his steed, and the elephant
and the lion lie down with the bicycle ; also, a
large peace broods over the only bunyip in cap-
tivity, and the total menagerie has not yet shown
any sign of tuberculosis, or any other form of
measles known to medical men.

After a merry, moneyed run of ten weeks
“The Geisha” retires on Friday from Her
Majesty’s. From first to last the opera has drawn
this city in large quantities. On Saturday the
Firm put up “ lolanthe ” for six nights only. The
opera season will then close, and the Knight-
Ferrar co. will come in on its heels.

departure for England, is to have a ben. at Syd-

ance of Misses Eva Carr-Glyn, Ada Clyde, and
Catherine Pardoe, and Mr. F. W. Reilly. Some
of the Tivoli Co. (permission of Mr. Rickards) and
some of Fitzgeralds’ Circus artistes (permission of
the Brothers F.) will also contribute, and the Syd-
ney Comedy Club will wind-up with the Ist act of

“ The Belle of New York ” gets along
better than was expected at Melb. Princess’s.
At last week’s matinee Albert Whelan took the
principal-man part, wherein poor Oscar Girard,
the one visible humorist of the imported crowd,
appears to be playing himself to a standstill.
Whelan was a satisfactory substitute for the sick
man, and his appearance in place of somebody else
would amount to a decided change for the better.
Meanwhile, the lamentable new arrival, who
figures as Mugg, is enjoying robust health, also the
impersonator of the Polite Lunatic steadfastly
refrains from falling ill, and the exponent of
mixed-ale pugilism goes on unchecked. The irony
of fate is very noticeable in this matter of “The
Belle of New York.” An accident, “fortunately
unattended by serious consequences,” might as
well happen to give the Automatic Twins leave of
absence from the bill, but it doesn’t. The unpre-
cedented mummers in question are still there.
Likewise the somewhat Napoleonic stranger who
struggles with the character of an interesting
young prodigal, and the unsesthetic “Queen of
Comic Opera,” and the female contortionist in
petticoats. They are all there, as before. The
present writer drops into the Princess’s occasion-
ally to approve of Miss Hepner and Girard, but
when he finds the others all there he stifles a sob
and leaves early)

“Woman and Wine” has not yet slack-
ened its prosperity at Melb. Royal. The title
turns out to be a powerful attraction, and the
drama’s honest endeavor to shock the public is
much appreciated. Very few dramas fulfil the
promises of their headlines, but this is all that the
title suggests, or even more so ; in fact, Bland
Holt would have been justified in billing it as
“Sin and Wickedness,” not to say “Booze and
Bloodshed. ” Hence the large attendances. An
ornate feature of this tale of dissipation is the
plump tenor, who prowls gingerly around
a cafe with a knife in his costume, and
mentions that the weapon has slain several
faithless women in its time. Maddened by
Miss Watson and drink, Walter Baker buys
this fatal toy from the plump vocalist, which ex-
plains why Walter is arrested on suspicion when
his best girl discovers Miss W.’s corpse under a
heap of roses. Bland Holt’s dramas are usually
rich in moral lessons, but this is the first drama
to point out the foolishness of buying an instru-
ment of vengeance in a public restaurant.
** * *
It now appears from a letter written by
Allan and Co. to Melb. Age that Amy Castles
didn’t get half the profits of her cleverly-worked
boom at the Town Hall, but she was handsomely
treated nevertheless. “After the success of the
concerts Mrs. Doubleday informed Miss Castles
that she would receive a cheque for 75 guineas,
and this, with outlays made on Miss Castle’s be-
half, is equivalent to her receiving fully £lOO for
the two concerts.” Any number of girl-warblers
would like to be “ discovered ” on the same terms,
of course, and lots of enterprising Mrs. Double-
days are pn the look-out for another “ finest voice
in the world.” Consequently there will be some
sore disappointments presently. The musical
critics have rashly committed themselves to the
glorification of Amy Castles, and if another Amy,
with an equally round voice, and a much more
promising physique, were to be exploited next
month, she would find the public grown indifferent
and the press notices rather chilly.
The current agony at the Haleck consists
largely of Augustus Glover in the felon’s dock—a
small dock, with only room, enough for one in it.
oome of the witnesses incline towards Augustus,
but others are dead against him, and you get
warning of these from the look of despair in the
prisoner s eyes, arms and body, as he beholds them
entering the witness-box. Augustus escapes the
gallows at the finish. The beasts who bore false
witness are shoved into the dock instead of the
thunderous innocent aforesaid, and the 12 respect-
able jurymen find ’em guilty inside of 11 p.m.
Ihe change of bill for next Saturday was not
announced at time of writing, but it will doubt-
less happen with the requisite Haleckian awful-
ness.

Dante, late of Sydney, introduced himself
to Melbourne on Saturday at St. George’s Hall,
where the light wasn’t as good as it will be made
this week. When the new light is thrown on
Dante s pretty little show, the fame of that curly-
headed artist will spread rapidly in Melbourne, no
doubt, for in a hard, professional way of speaking,
he is All Right. Dante is an entertainer in the
first place, and a distinctly excellent conjuror
afterwards. The magic of his smile goes a long
way, also his legs are rather lovely, and he
is a gay deceiver in all respects. Whilst
Dante makes a favorable impression on the girls,
his assistant goddess, Mdlle. Edmunda, casts a
soothing spell over other fellows in the audience.
Hie show starts well, goes well, and ends well. It
is neatly put upon the stage, and it deserves a
more festive home than St. George’s Hall, but
seeing that the Palace Theatre couldn’t be carted
across from Sydney for the purpose, St. George’s
Hall will have to do for Dante, and the public
must take this fresh young wizard where they can
find him.

Much-travelled Pianist Friedenthal gave
his first recital on Sat., April 15, before an audi-
ence which comfortably filled the Town Hall.
The gathering was thickly salted with local musi-
cians of all cliques—Zelman, senior, Father Ryan,
Herr Hartung, Mrs. Palmer, Mona M‘Burney,
&c., &c. Hero-worshipping damsels, interested
m the man rather than the musician, will be more
numerous next time. The “expert” tone of his
reception must have gratified an artist who ignores
the gallery, so to speak, dispenses with sensational
mannerisms, and, in his own words, wants
nothing of his audience “ except that they love
music.” Nevertheless, judging by the well-
groomed and much-cherished aspect of Mein
Herr’s dark tresses, he possibly won’t be com-
jiletely out of sympathy with those hearers (not a
few probably) who oyer and above said modest
sine qua non, set their superfluous affection on
Music s interpreter, in the person of slim, dark,
sympathetic Albert Friedenthal. A more mature
and self-sustained artist than Mark Hambourg,
our present visitor, unlike the Polish boy afore-
said, does not frenzy excitable listeners by ebulli-
tions of youthful impetuosity, flame, sound and
fury.

Friedenthal - fire, like forked electric-
flashes, perturbs some natures less than Ham-
bourg sheet-lightning with thunder-claps and a
brimstone whiff. Serenade (Sohubert-Liszt) was,
maybe, the gem of Saturday’s programme. Frie-
denthal’s own little Gavotte got an encore, though
frowned upon by the cognoscenti as a sop to the
Philistines. Said skittish composition is destined
to go the round of the local drawing-rooms with
its freakish finger-gymnastics. Performer trills
simultaneously with the nails of the thumb and
second finger and en route strikes notes in the
ordinary way with the forefinger. Second Frie-
denthal concert, billed for Tuesday, April 18, will
have happened when this paper is printed.

“ The ‘ long arm of the Law ’ is nothing,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ to the lengthy arm
of Love. George Bull, formerly of the Sydney press,
marries Madge Rossell, the popular danseuse, in Septem-
ber. Miss Rossell was in Australia with the last Gaiety
Co., will be remembered for her dancing as Flo Fan-
shavve in ‘ In Town,’ and met her future guardian, who
was‘copy-jerking’for the Australian Star. But the
track of veracious affection never helps the running for
the Matrimonial Stakes. They parted ‘out thar,’ en-
gaged and met ‘ over he ar,’ disengaged—a dark dividing
cloud, some years wide, of misunderstanding expanded
by the haughty pride But now—Bow-bells, orange-
blossoms, horseshoes, curtain.”
“The new Alhainbrkballet, ‘The Red Shoes,”’ writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “is the finest
that has been produced in England in the memory of
young-man. The ‘ parched-pea ’ ballerina with limbs like
a champion rooster-bikist has been warned off to rest the
corns on her toe-tips, and the tasty, harmonious dresses
almost excuse what they do not disclose. The final
scene, representing ‘The Firmament’—whatever that is
—is, lam ready to believe, the most striking, artistic,
and elaborate display ever made. The ’99 team will rush
this ballet and the bicycle-polo at the Empire. Exciting
and clever, the two-a-side teams battle nightly on their
merits, and betting is an institution in the grand-circle.
“ Ven.”: Remember, when a youngster, staying at the
Cornwall Hotel, Launceston. The divisions between the
rooms in that ancient hostlery were so thin that you
could hear every word spoken by your neighbors. And I
heard —much, I recollect, to the prompting of my pity
and sympathy—a solemn voice say, “This half-crown,
my dear, is all we have in the world.” I wonder if George
Coppin remembers 1
“ The new ‘ Savoy ’ opera,” writes The Bulletin’s Lon-
don correspondent, “ is laid—hang on to the car going
round corners!—in a mining camp in Australia! A
smart man, he of the ‘ French Maid,’ Capt. Basil Hood,
trundles out the mullock, and Sir Arthur Sullivan cradles
out the gold in melody. Hurry up that batch of Austra-
lian authors, for it’s a 100 to 1 every digger will wear Wel-
lington boots, red shirt, and a gracefully curved broad-
brimmed felt.”
“ The latest sensation in theatrical circles,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ is the managerial
triumvirate of the Georges. George Edwardes, George
Lederer, and George Musgrove, of the Gaiety, Casino
(N.Y.)andShaftesbury, an Anglo-Yanko-Austral shamrock
with a very solid stalk. The triplicate have taken the
Prince of Wales Theatre, Arthur Roberts’s late home, and
will open shortly with ‘ Revue, 1899,’ an American form
of entertainment. The events of the day, or the past 12
months, are reproduced in burlesque. Politicians, soldiers,
professionals generally of note, represented in doing
something they have done or ought to. Each character
will be copied to the life, and full face masks worn accur-
ately moulded. It will be really a superior topical panto-
mime, and contretemps of the Randy-Pandy type may
intervene.”
Oscar Girard, the long, thin comedian of the “ Belle of
New York,” seems to have come to Australia in pursuit
of health, poor fellow ! His quaint, effective method of
talking his songs was forced upon him by his failing voice.
Melb. Age’s musical critic committed himself to the
statement that Amy Castles is “ not yet fully grown.”
Which accounted perhaps for a letter in a subsequent
issue of the Age commencing with “ In view of the great
sensation caused by the wonderful child vocalist .” The
only sensation experienced by outsiders, who paid their
“bob” or two shillings in a spirit of enquiry, was a feel-
ing of mild disappointment.
The Bulletin’s London correspondent : —“ Geo. Mus-
Strove tells that New York Belles and London Beaux may
come or go, but the ‘Belle of New York’ goes on for ever,
and in the tenth month to the tune of over £2OOO a week.
The Shaftesbury theatre is now like nothing but the old
days of the Gaiety, when the ‘sacred lamp of burlesque’
took a ‘bunker’ of champagne and an ‘eight o’clock
rush’ of suppers to feed the giddy wick. It has been a
marvellous performance of G. M.’s to lift the curse off
that theatre. It generally takes a good fire and a subse-
quently-solvent proprietor. But the Amurkan girls have
fetched and held the whole of the Johnnieocracy. With
eye-tooth wisdom the ‘ tired ’ ladies are transported back
to New York, and fresh paint, blood, and limbs of the
curviest replace them. As a bookie, I’d lay odds the
‘ Belle of New York’ will be here to push M'llwraith’s
Maori off London Bridge—or the Q.N. Bank.”
“For She is the Belle of New York ” now puts the nose
out of joint of “Sons of the Sea ” as the current whistling
and la-de-dah nuisance of Melb. What is the occult in-
fluence that makes a melody “ touch the electric chain
with which we’re darkly bound ” ? It rumbles in the
railway wheels, and those of the trams, puffs with the
smoke from the locomotive funnel, is heard in the very
rollers of the sea upon the beach, and you can’t tinkle
your knife against your plate without producing it. Even
the electric telegraph raps it out. Just as everyone is
going frantic with tune in the head, worse than the hum-
buzz of the influenza, there comes a refreshing change,
and the “ Belle of New York” is gone.
The toss of a penny, when he was a hobbledehoy in
London, decided Coppin on going to Australia, instead of
to America. He landed first in Sydney. Soon he found
his way to Hobart, as comedian and manager. From
Launceston he brought his company, including Rogers
and Mr. and Mrs. Ohas. Young, to Melb. Queen’s. He
had the first carpet laid on the Melb. stage—for a per-
formance of the “ School for Scandal,” himself as Sir
Peter. The Queen’s and the pub. next door were owned
by John Thomas Smith, Melb.’s Whittington, seven times
Mayor. Coppin concluded his engagement with Brooke
behind the scenes of the Birmingham theatre, in the
time when Mrs. Rignold, the manager’s wife (mother of
George and William), was so popular in Hamlet and
Romeo—but it cannot be verified that she played lago,
as has been alleged. The news of Brooke’s death reached
Coppin while he was chatting in Caple’s book-shop,
Colli ris-street.
“ Bun.”: Veteran Geo. Coppin, who recently arrived at
the 80th milestone of his journey, gave an Argus reporter
a brief sketch of his career. In this he mentioned that
Rogers, old-time comedian, and father of Horace Rogers
of the S.M. Herald, was the son of a clergyman and had
never performed on the stage until he came to Australia.
This is correct. Rogers was a soldier in the 51st Regt.,
when stationed at Hobart. His brilliant acting in
garrison amateur performances led to the purchase of his
discharge by some admirers. He immediately took a
leading position ori the Australian stage. That was before
Coppin’s time.
Apropos veteran George Coppin’s 80th birthday, Satur-
day, April 8. So long ago as 1848 he built a theatre in
Port Adelaide (S.A.), where he was most popular as a
comedian and hotelkeeper 50 years ago. His first wife is
buried in Adelaide cemetery.
Averred that the authorities of Melb. Conservatorium
of Music declare Miss Amy Castles, of Bendigo, to be the
possessor of a finer voice than Melba’s, and predict for
her a future much more dazzling than that of Nellie
Armstrong. “Castles" in the air?
“S.S.”: Amusing to note the crowd of women and
tame males standing about Melb. Town Hall steps to gape
at the latest songstress as she passes out, after sitting in
the hall and staring at her through many songs. Query—
which part of Miss Castles’ audience paid best, that which
went to hear or the other that went to see?
Bland Holt received from Melba two portraits of her-
self, in lieu of New Year cards, for himself and wife.

Mrs. Marcus Clarke will benefit at Melb. Town Hall
next month, to put her in the way of going ’Ome on
business. Mrs. Clarke has received an offer from an
English firm to republish her late husband’s works, and
she cherishes a hope of getting one or two of his plays
produced in London. “ She will endeavor also,” says the
circular, “to compel certain publishers to file accounts of
works already issued, and collect the amounts due to
her.” Dr. Neild, Frank Stuart, Zox, and other friends are
building a substantial programme for the ben.
“0.G." : “ Round the World in 80 Days” has a geo-
graphical twang about its title which would be un-
pleasantly reminiscent of one’s school-days if the manage-
ment did not thoughtfully obviate this by making the
details as inaccurate as possible. Thus we have a Hindu
princess in Turkish costume, and a pale-faced Hindu priest
who looks like a Druid in an Eight Hours’ Day procession.
Likewise we have a barmaid in America, where the he-
drink-slinger is universal ; also, in the same land of the
Stars and Stripes, a barrel-bodied Frenchman prances
around declaring himself a “ man of de bull-dog breed
dat made old England great.”

Westralian wire : “ Copper is attracting a good
deal of attention in the Kalsroorlie district. Application
has been made for a reward claim. The Warden will

vised from London that copper mines are only floated
there once in about 14 years, and no sooner did the metal
run up to £7O than London was infested with mines from

The Kallenite Explosives Company (capital
£160,000 in £1 shares) has been formed to acquire process,
specifications, and patent rights of the series of explosives
known as “ Kallenite,” and to manufacture and sell the
same in N.S.W. and elsewhere. The explosive Kallenite
was discovered by Messrs. Alex. Fraser and John Calla-
ghan, by whom the invention was matured and perfected
with the advice and co-operation of Major Quinby, of
San Francisco, a well-known explosives expert. It is
claimed for Kallenite that, while practically smokeless
and fumeless, it is stronger and cheaper than any other
nitro-glycerine compound, becomes safer, instead of more
dangerous, with keeping, and will probably be in Govt,
requisition for defence purposes. Offices, Imperial Cham-

Dredging schemes by the score are in process of
incubation in Sydney. The same old tribe that bobs up
serenely in every boom is at the game, but this time they'
will reckon without their host. The public are not biting
freely at the tempting bait dangled before them by certain
prints. The man who puts his money into any dredging
scheme without subjecting it to the closest investigation
and getting independent opinion as to its merits deserves
—to be fleeced. There may be difficulties as to titles and
riparian rights, and heavy royalties to pay, a M.L. syndicate
having applied for patents covering bucket-dredges—that
is, they are doing in N.S.W. what they would not dream
of attempting to do in their own country.
* * * »
Queensland and South Australia have shown no
sign of joining in the dredging-boom, but they may be
depended on to come along later. For Westralia to start
would be funny enough to awaken a general sense of
humor, and that always nips a boom in the bud when
floating is in the air. Over two years back the writer,
after putting in a week examining John Wallace’s dredges
at Yackandandah, Vic., anticipated a dredging boom
someday. It has come, and with it the time for antici-
pating its “ bust.” Two things are essential in dredging
—a little gold in the stuff, and conditions favorable for its
cheap extraction. In many of the schemes, incubated
and incubating, there is enough gold, but not enough
water; in others, plenty of water, but too little gold.
There are two systems—the bucket, and the centrifugal-
pump dredge. One works in water, the other beside it.
In some of the schemes it is apparent, to anyone who
understands the business, the natural conditions are such
that neither can be effectively or profitably used. Gener-
ally the idea is to dredge the public for cash. One man
wants £6OOO to erect a dredge and half the property, and
is himself quite satisfied that the wash will go as many
dwf. “to the load” as grains are wanted to pay.
Another man, representing an engineering firm, is
also satisfied that the ground is suitable for
a dredge, and naturally supplies an estimate of the cost
of one. Old alluvial co’s ground is to be operated by new
dredging co’s, for a heavy consideration in paid shares—
and the privilege of taking over old liabilities is thrown
in. The success of Garland and other N.S.W. people,
who have never yet had a clean-up, is anticipated and
grossly exaggerated ; one Vic. co. has been six weeks at
this little operation (cleaning-up)—no joke where the
bottom is bad. Men who have never seen a dredge work-
ing in their lives have become dredge-experts ; and, in
one notable case, it is as clear as the noonday sun that
the daily publication of fictitious sales at fancy prices is
resorted to with the view of drawing the public in and
providing something for the Stock Exchange’s attention.
Maoriland’s dredging success is quoted every day, but not
a word that the united capital of all the co’s working
there would not make up half the capital of the co’s pro-
jected here—that the conditions there are generally
favorable—there are no dredges working where they are
not—and that the returns don’t average 40oz. each dredge
a week, anyhow, and, no matter how cheaply dredging
things can be run, 40oz. a week won’t pay divs. on a
heavy capital.
* * * *
In favor of one of the N.S.W. dredging co.’s
now on the market, at least one thing can be said. One
of the reporting experts admits that the gold starts a
little below the “ grass roots.” In every other prospectus
writer has seen the gold start right “from the grass
roots so mixed up together, in fact, that he expects
soon to see a scheme for extracting large quantities of
gold from the roots themselves.

After all the yabber of the great good—and no
possible harm—dredging was going to do Vic., one Lynch
is out with a terrible indictment against it. He cites in-
stances of rich river flats ruined by silt and sludge, of
farms abandoned, of deep, continuous waters turned into
a chain of lagoons, and from the clearness of crystal to the
color of pea-soup ; of streams gradually silting up with
many other horrors, and is amazed at the blindness of
the Vic. farmers to the great and irreparable dangers of
the dredging boom.

A fair-sized library might be stocked with
learned monographs and papers on the Broken Hill Sul-
phide Problem ; and tbe most substantial shelf of all
should be given up to the Ashcroft process. Mr. Ash-
croft himself lately sent out a couple of massive pam-
phlets, in one of which he reviewed the whole history of
his connection with the meteoric business. Much of the
150 pp. or so consists of correspondence. It began with
gushful notes to “Dear Ashcroft” from “Kintore;” it
ended with letters to “ E. A. Ashcroft, Esq., Sir,” in
which “ J. Butterworth, secretary,” intimated that if
Ashcroft wanted law the directors were ready for him.
This massive volume was thrown at shareholders of the
Sulphide Corporation at their last annual meeting in Lon-
don ; the meeting replied by knocking the thrower’s
name out of the co’s title. Ashcroft summarises his case
thus: The ore contents of the co’s mine (the Central)
weren’t so good as the co’s own mining experts had re-
ported ; he (Ashcroft) had never had proper control and,
therefore, a fair show'; and the final trial-run was ter-
minated while the process was working successfully. Still,
in his final words, he confesses that “the low grade of the
ores at Broken Hill practically put wet processes,
such as Ashcroft’s, out of court.” And this is, ap-
parently, the end of the most expensive metallurgical
experiment which Australia has known. In one way and
another it cost a trifle over £lOO,OOO.
Ashcroft was electrical engineer to the B.H.
Proprietary Co. at a very comfortable salary. In an evil
hour he would be an inventor; and after using up his
spare moments and coin for some years, he produced what
Prof. Schnabel declared to be theoretically the “ best pro-
cess for the treatment of sulphide ores.” And (this is
told for the encouragement of inventors), according to his
own account, this is how he came out of his successive
rounds with Fatman, Esq. : First time he ran short of
cash he had to hand over twd-thirds of his interest for
£lOOO. Then, on Mr. Schlapp’s glowing report, a
quarter-share in the whole thing was bought by
the Gibbs, Bright and Co. people. Experimental
plants, &c., were wanted ; when 500,000 shares in
the Sulphide Corporation were paid to the ven-
dors, Ashcroft’s “end” was 56,000. His “financiers"
took the balance of his parcel ; and he still owed £15,000.
Since then the £15,000 has been paid ; but he has had to
surrender his entire interest in the co. In other words,
it has cost the inventor about £lO,OOO to produce the
theoretically-" best process of sulphide-treatment yet
made known.”

new concentrating plant and engine already ordered will

cutting-down the main shaft, and it is impossible to put
the full complement of miners on before this work is
finished. Cobar Gold Mines also spending many thou-
sands-not now in miners’ wages, which, however, must
eventually form the bulk of expenditure. These two
mines are spending more money in massive machinery
than all the others of Cobar put together. Yet the
Warden lately intimated to the representatives of each
that he would grant no more partial labor-exemptions.
A Warden who acts like this does not know his business.

“ E.E.” wants to know what has become of the
Lady Maude G.M. Co., Stewart’s Brook (N.S.W.) ; he says
that he has not received any notices of calls for seven

circumstances he concludes that the co. is defunct. It

There have been mighty “ructions ”in London

pally of titled politicians—and local offices have been

vested with full authority.

Birthday mine, Parkes, has had another nasty
fall. Resurrected under the name of the Avoca Reefs.
Great were the prognostications as to results from cyanid-
ing. The results, however, have launched the co. prac-
tically into insolvency. Further calls are to be made to
sink the shaft and pay off all outstanding liabilities,
“ with the exception of the bank overdraft.” What grim

At Grassy Gulf, Nowra district (N.S.W.), very
rich gold ore is being won from a lode found in a road-

another instance of a road-cutting or railway-cutting dis-
closing a payable lode ?

Bowes Kelly, off to England with a credential
which, according to Knox, is ample to ensure his receiv-
ing full consideration while there —the fact that during
the past 15 years mining companies with which he has
been associated have paid £10,500,000 in dividends.
Doubtless Mr. Kelly’s wealth, good-nature and sincerity
will help him to gloss over that forcible brusqueness of
speech and manner acquired in long years of jumbucking
and bullock-punching out West.

Geologist Pittman records the interesting theory
that the White Rock mine (Drake, N.S.W.) is the filled-up
neck of a volcanic vent. But he carefully avoids the
more interesting problem : is there any pay-ore in the
mine? It was the sensational million-mine of 12 years
ago, but it killed two local companies and the third is
likely to share a similar fate.

What is the trouble with the Lake George
mines? Returns low, but remarkably consistent; large
quantities of ore mined, and, judging from reports, taken
fairly from all parts of the Workings, profits, according
to official statements, nearly £4OOO per month. Were
copper to decline to £5O per ton, there would still be a
good profit. Reported that the co. is now out of debt;
yet, despite all these things, shares are buyable at
9s. —less than two years’ purchase on present output.
Stated in Sydney that all the selling orders come from
Melbourne, the headquarters of the co. On reports, Lake
George, at £78,750, is an incomprehensibility when com-
pared with some W.A. stocks, the market-values of which
run into seven figures. Still, the fact that big lines are
always available in Melbourne must be accepted as an
indication that things are not all they seem. The market
talks.

At Nutherungie, way out in Wilcannia wastes,
there is said to be a large deposit of copper-ore “superior
to anything found in Cobar.” The warden thinks that
there is enough ore in sight to warrant the erection of
smelters. The owners of the thing, apparently, think
otherwise. They are waiting for English capitalists to
come along and take the risks. If the place is superior to
Cobar why isn’t it worked for all it is worth ? Cobar was
a div.-paying mine, despite the handicap of over 200
miles of road-carriage, in its early days. Nutherungie is
within 70 miles of permanent navigable water.

A sharp lesson touching the folly of depositing
trust-money in private banking accounts has been taught
by Judge Tin O’B. P. Gibson at Broken Hill. An agent —
a man well known in Melb. land-boom circles—sold a
cottage, took £lBO for it* and lodged the cash at a bank
where he was overdrawn. He alleges that he lodged it
thus on the understanding that he could draw it, less his
commission, to pay the vendor. Just then bank-managers
changed, the arrangement was denied, neither deeds nor
cash was forthcoming—and the sentence was two and
a-half years’ hard.

Paddy Lackey Deep Levels, N.S.W. : A side-on
show. Shaft started two years ago to pick up reef on
underlay, down about 350 ft. Five thousand shares were
issued at £1 some months back, £5OOO more was raised
by debentures, and a good cut has been made into this.
Should cut the reef between 500 ft. and 600 ft., but, if they
drive north on it they will soon find themselves in the
parent mine’s ground, as it runs at an angle across the
lease, and the underlie is not nearly so rapid north,
whereas, in driving south, one of the Paddy Lackey 5-acre
blocks, running past the boundary easterly, will be met
with. As writer has said, it will be “The Very Deep
Levels ” before it is much good to anyone.

Manager Stewart has taken possession of the
Chillagoe Co.’s mines, and many people expect the shares
to boom. Others, having no shares, but large interests in
surrounding and other blocks, expect these to “ go off
like wildfire.” Up to date, they show no sign of
going off, and unless something tangible is done by
somebody in London shortly, played-out boomsters
will begin to kick themselves vigorously, and want to
know what use are rich copper-mines, anyhow. Chillagoe
has had its little boom—it was short-lived, because the
public soon realised that three years must elapse before
the parent mine could get things going in good shape,
that meantime the copper-market may collapse, and no
matter if it didn’t—outside shows that could not work
without a railway could never weather the storm of wait-
ing for one. The surface copper deposits of Chillagoe
district are probably the richest in Australasia—it is also
admitted that generally they are in limestone —a ffirma-
tion in which the richest of nearly all metals is found,
and by the natural order of things the richest has the
shortest life. There are one or two celebrated copper-
mines in limestone, but exceptions prove, &c. So far no
attempt has been made to prove the Chillagoe mines in
depth ; that must be done sooner or later. If they go
down, and are permanently rich, there will be nothing in
the world to equal them ; if, like nine out of ten other
limestone deposits, they peter out, and are otherwise as
treacherous as they are rich—well, it won’t take long to
exhaust all the surface shows of the field. Stewart does
not deal with this phase in his report—probably because
he has had no experience of exactly similar formations in
other parts of the world to warrant him in doing so, and
Stewart is admittedly a verra cautious man. With copper
at over £7O a ton there is no sign of another Chillagoe
boom, and there won’t he till permanency and richness in
depth have been established beyond all doubt.

Great Extended Hustler’s, Bendigo, the mine
that made a sensation for some years in the 70’s, has
struck very rich stone at 2700 ft. Too soon for holders to
go into ecstasies. Last year, a few good crushings and
one div. were got out of a find that proved a pocket.
Hercules and Knergetic, on another line, also made a
strike last week, in driving south on the east leg at 2500 ft.
This, too, was a good mine years ago.

ever having any gold. First drove a tunnel, then started

country. Imagine any gold-mine in N.S.W. sinking so
far in the hope of striking gold some day 1

Castlemaine, Vic., is having a little boom —a big
one compared with the depression long hanging over that
camp. Spring Gully Mine still running over an ounce,
reef big and well-defined, and gold run so long that other
mines are prospecting for it. Adding 20 stamps ; divs.
regular. Also has one mine dredging at a profit; others
threatening to sluice away about two-thirds of the place,
which seems quite prepared to be washed away in the
interests of the boom that makes it feel good.
Controversy has been raging i n Melb. as to whether
Prof.M'Coy, or any other geologist, did say manyyears ago
that gold in quartz would not live or pay below 300 or
400 ft. All the living members of the Royal Mining Com-
mission of ’56 deny that any such statement was made,
but admit that all the evidence went to show that richness
decreased with depth—on Bendigo particularly. So it is
the world over. Sometimes rich things go down, but
mostly they don’t. As a rule, the first 100 ft. contains
more gold than the next 1000 ft. Nor has the old order
of things changed on newer fields. Westralia is a striking
example of the golden rule. Bayley’s got much more
gold above 100 ft. than in all the levels below. London-
derry had thousands of ounces in a big, solid, rocksalt-
looking reef within 6ft. of the surface. At the Wealth of
Nations, “ Big John ” and other stones containing hunks
were lying on the surface, but nothing of the sort was
found below it. On any new camp, the writer, in ex-
change for all the surface-gold, would allow other people
the pleasure of driving tunnels into mountains and sink-
ing into the bowels of the earth to find the balance left.

a suburb of the “Golden City.” He and two mates had

with brooms, shovels, a cradle, and a wheelbarrow (latter
presumably to carry away the gold). Yield not stated.

30,000 eligible? in the two provinces. Comparatively
Zeehan (Tas.) is the strongest union centre ; it has 820
members, and about £'3ooo in hand. Bendigo has 2000
members, and £2609 ; Ballarat, 1600 members, and £1720.
Financially Stawell is strongest—26s members, and £2651

Another famous Berry (Vic.) mine nearing its
end. The manager of the Berry Consols is “ hopeful that
the ground cut up for blocking will maintain profitable
results for the current six months,” the significance of
which is shown in the further statement that “ prospect-
ing has been kept well advanced, but unfortunately with
indifferent results.” Last half-year’s record: gold,
£38,455 ; divs., £16,500. Record to date : gold, £810,589 ;
divs., £313,000 ; royalty paid, £60,815. Called-up capital,

An English co. having acquired the land be-
tween the Great Southern Garden Gulf mine (Bendigo)
and the boundary of the cemetery, we may look for a re-
vival of the burying-ground scheme of 28 years ago. A
syndicate of speculators bought a number of contiguous
grave-yard allotments and seriously contended that they
had the right to sink a common grave and that it must
be immaterial to the trustees whether the grave was sunk
6ft, or 1001 ft. The collapse of the boom stopped the
scheme in the syndicate stage.

they don’t take long to find out, when on the spot, that

what they can ; though if their earnings should happen

The Austral Otis Engineering Co. Ltd., South
Melb., has completed and delivered a very fine set of
winding engines for the Cobar Gold Mines, N.S.VV., capable
of hauling a load of two tons from 1500 ft. at a speed of
1000 ft. per minute. The engines are a pair of 14" cylin-
ders, geared to 7ft. loose drum, and are fitted with link
motion reversing gear, vertical indicators, andpoweiful
brake gear. The pair of engines are set to one side of the
drums, and all the driving levers are brought behind the
drums. The co. has also just delivered a fine set of
pumping plant for the Paddy Lackey mine for taking the
shaft down to 1000 ft.

No mining co. ever had a more appropriate
name than the Big Blow, Limited. The only improve-
ment possible was perhaps a modification to the Big Blow
and Bluff Amalgamated and Unlimited. The original co.,
the Big Blow Amalgamated, was registered in ’94 with a
nominal capital of £150,000. The modest vendors took
£25,039 and 99,961 pound shares. In Aug., ’96 a new co.
was registered—just the Big Blow this time ; nominal
capital, 1200,000. Two major-generals and a brace of
captains were on the board to lead it to victory. By the
end of ’97 they had actually got a crushing—23o tons stone
yielded 740 z. Since then there have been more crushings,
until this gorgeous mine has yielded 805 oz. from 3029
tons. Apart from what the vendors had been paid, it had
not cost more than about £40,000 to produce this much.
The new co. in 12 months or so swamped £13,689 on the
mine and £4917 on “ London administration ” ; besides, it
owed on the latter account about £l5OO more. At about
this point, Boulder Hamilton was invited to report on
the show ; and his verdict was—too poor to pay. So the
machinery has been sold for £2OOO, and an official receiver
is waiting for somebody to offer something for the mine.
Apropos the value of metals exported, and
especially of the Westralian gold, as to which some
remarks were lately made, when it was said that the
figures officially published were not reliable. In the case
of the Big Blow, shareholders complained to the official
receiver that they had been led to suppose that the gold
was worth nearly £4 per oz., whereas some of it actually
realised £1 11s. 6d. per oz. and other of it £2 10s. To
which the directors’ only reply was that the value of the
bullion could never be known until it went to the mint,
and was reduced to standard value. That is, until the
local mint Is in operation, the value cannot be known
until long after the official returns have been published.
Tho value of Lake View Consols output for
March was £33,000, and the cost of production £lO,OOO ■
the latter not including development work, which is’
charged to capital account. The profit on working
account was £23,000-equal to £276,000 a year. The out"
put, it is said, will be doubled when the sulphide plant is
going. Suppose that the working costs are not increased
there will then be a profit of £562,000 per year, or 13-8
per cent, on present market value of the shares. The
buyer at £l6 who expects a profit of 6 per cent, on his
investment at compound interest would have to wait ten
years before he gets his principal back.

Refreshing to hear the managers of Kalgoorlie
boss mines, at the Exhibition-opening banquet, on the
alluvial digger. Said Hamilton, of the Boulder : “ No-
thing more immediately benefits a country than a good
alluvial field. The alluvial miner does not send the money
he gets for the gold out of the country in the form of
dividends. You should remember the alluvial miner,
then, when framing further mining legislation.” And
Callahan, of Lake View : “ The alluvial man is the path-
finder. We follow afterwards. There is no capitalist
equal to the man who has the muscle to make the
country. The residents of the Kalgoorlie district could
have made the country what it is to-day without a dollar
of British capital.” And these things were said, not at a
miners’ shivoo, but at a dinner to J. Bull’s representative,
Jerry Smith.
They made big efforts in the West to kill the
uneasy feeling with regard to local banks by heaving at it
chunks of ridicule. The most-favored yarn of the genesis
of the mild scare was that a local pub.-keeper, whose
cheques had been declined, took the first opportunity
that offered to say, when the bank’s notes came in—
“Jlere, just wait a minute till I send round and get gold
for this. Safer, you know ; and, well — ” the rest being a
wink. The most feasible part of the yarn is that it was a
pub.-keeper’s cheque that was returned ; for Perth pub.-
keepers are about the stone-brokest crowd in Australia
just now. The statement that somebody presented a
note to pay for a drink in Perth casts grave doubt upon
the whole fabrication.

Gov. Tennyson (says The Bulletin’s
Adelaide correspondent) is fat, florid, and flutter-
some in appearance, with a half-bald head and a
closely-trmnned beard. He is evidently most
anxious to please, and has, so far, made a very
favorable impression. “ There is as much meat
in his talk as on his bones, and I think he is a
very good fellow,” was Premier Kingston’s com-
ment after a few snatches of conversation with
him on the day of his arrival. His speech at the
swearing-in was rounded in phrase, and given in
a full, orotund voice, and its only fault was, per-
haps, a too-plenteous quotation from his father’s
poems. He reminded the audience incidentally
that Arctic-navigator John Franklin, once Gov.
m lasmania, was his uncle. Lady Tennyson is
too charming for words, and so is the French
governess, Mdlle. Dussan, who accompanied the
vice-regal party to the platform, and smiled with
sweet benignity upon the delighted spectators,
who caught exquisite glimpses of her shapely
ankles as she tripped up the steps. Gov. Buxton
was impossible to the verbatim reporter, who was
reduced to despair by his sentences, but his pre-
sent Excellency recites his piece in a way which
is balm and nectar to the stenographer. Indeed
he gets along so deliberately that he could almost
be written up ”as he goes.

As predicted, Coolgardie Exhibition has
turned out a miserable fiasco. According to pre-
sent outlook, the show will come to a speedy and
inglorious termination. Mining-magnate Mor-
gans, the president,, is wroth with the Easterners
for their apathyJn the matter, and threatens to go
dead against federation in consequence. He
considers that N.S.W., Victoria, S.A., and Q.
Govts, should each have voted ,£lO,OOO or so
apiece in recognition of the splendid markets that
Westralia has opened up for them. But then
the other provinces have all had some previous
experience of Joubert, and his mode of run-
ning shows. John Forrest was reluctantly dragged
into the concern at the eleventh hour, and foolishly
gave £5OOO of public money towards boosting it
up. Then, when fairly committed to the wretched
affair, he had to give another =£sooo, and Heaven
knows how much more will be needed to get out
of the mess. In this “exhibition” the W.A.
Premier has a particularly ravenous wolf by the
ears.
Consider the J.P., how he “acts the goat.”
At Carlton (Melb.) again—of course—on Monday
week, H. Gresham was charged with a “cowardly,
unprovoked and brutal assault ” (Age report) on a
young woman whom he met the previous Satur-
day afternoon in Carlton Gardens. Coming up,
he, without warning, struck her, blackening her
eyes and rendering her insensible. He was gently
and reluctantly fined ,£1 or 48 hours, and the
kindly magistrates allowed him a week in which
to raise the cash !! ! Having thus nobly dis-
charged their duty, these two awful beaks next
proceeded to consider the case of a man and woman
who had been locked up since the preceding
Saturday on a charge of common or public-house
drunkenness. They were promptly fined £2 or
one month each ! ! ! All three had been previously
convicted. Truly, the Carlton J.P. is a hopeless
case.

A correspondent, on the Bourke Camel
Carrying Co. trouble
Dear Bulletin.— The camel-drivers’ trouble at Bourke
seems to be much a question of interpreting. Stated that
Abdul Wade, the camel co.’s manager, put aside N.S.W.
Govt, interpreter, and himself translated the agreement.
The Govt, interpreter does not seem to know whether
Abdul Wade’s translation was right or wrori g. These
men, if really Afghans, speak a language quite different
from Hindustani, though some of them may understand
a little Hindustani or Panjabi. In fact there are four
languages spoken in Afghanistan, and an interpreter to
be efficient would have to know them all. In view of the
above-mentioned statement about the translation of the
camel-drivers’ agreement, a little more precise informa-
tion about the Govt, interpreter’s linguistic attainments
would be interesting.—D.G.
Some mien are
“ whales ” at illustrating
their remarks. T’other
day, at Roma, a dentist
wanted to show folks how
gun-accidents happened.
Accordingly, he drew a
bullet from a cartridge,
placed the latter again in
the gun, and held his
mouth near the muzzle.
The stock struck the floor,
the powder exploded, tore
the hapless dentist’s jaw
badly, and knocked him
unconscious. As an illus-
tration, however, the acci-
dent was simply perfec-
tion,
N.S.W. Public Ser-
vice Board apparently
finds the reorganisation of
the charities a hard row
to hoe. An “ acting direc-
tor ” was appointed in
Nov., ’97, and is still act-
ing. Every month rumor
is busy with the name, of
the selected director, and
the Parramatta papers
(the old town is an inter-
ested party) have from
time to time appointed six.
The rubber stamps by
which official correspond-
ence from other depart-
ments reach his office have
lately been re-made, and
they now stamp “ Acting
Director.”
Melbourne seems to have made up its
mind that phrenologist Medor, the much-tor-
mented man who committed one murder and two
lots of personal injuries at the Eastern Market,
shah not be hanged for his frenzy. Perhaps he
didn’t attack the right people, and certainly he
erred in—horrible deed !—gouging out the eye of a
third party; but when a man’s business neighbors
are either leagued together to persecute him “on
their own,” or to laugh at the practical “ jokes ”
which madden him, nobody can reasonably
wonder if his vengeance run its course. Judged
by a tribunal of nervous subjects, capable of
imagining themselves in the murderer’s place,
Medor would get six months imprisonment and an
address of sympathy. Tried at Melb. Criminal
Court he is sure to get something rougher than
that. All the same, he can reckon that he
has helped to humanise the Eastern Market.
TWO VIEWS OF IT.
MAID : “Did you enjoy yourself at the hall, miss?'”
MISS POTTS POINT : “ Oh, splendidly. I had lots
ofpartners.”
MAID: “My! you must have been carry in’ on.
One mash of a night is enough for me.”
Melb. Herald let itself loose over the
Eastern Market murder, and its report was lurid
melodrama with coagulated gore all over the shop.
Comic relief was provided in the shape of slabs of
bald and awful bathos: And down upon the
awful scene in the shop carpeted with blood
. gazes Her Majesty the Queen in serene dignity,
from a cheap print upon the wall.” Ye gods!
The average reporter would seem to have the art
instinct of the carroty small boy who illuminates
stables and hen houses with the assistance of a
clay puddle and a big stick.
♦ * * *
As soon as Melb. police authorities re-
covered from the shock of astrologer Medor’s
Market murder, they set hurriedly to work to
clear all the fortune-tellers, palmists, and bump-
gropers out of the place, bundling them neck-and-
crop into Little Collins-street. These people have
been at work in the market for years, but it
needed a gory horror to make the powers officially
aware of their existence, and the distempered sud-
denness of the clearing-up suggests an agonising
dread on the part of the police that all the
astrologers and mahogany-stained gipsies and
other peddlers of horoscopes were liable to break
out suddenly and shed gore over the Council’s
property. But the tribe will be back on the
job again within three months.
“S.”: Astrologer Medor, the Melb. Market
murderer, evidently had the most sublime faith
in his calling, and held it in such reverence
that the customer who dared to display the
slightest cynicism was haughtily shown off the
premises. He is just the sort of man who would
rather declare in the dock that he knew all along
he was going to be the prime-mover in a No. 1
tragedy, and let it be imagined the crime was pre-
meditated, than have people believe for a moment
that the stars had kept this important fact dark
to him. I can imagine his lawyer saying, “But
if you talk like that they’ll hang you,” and Medor
replying loftily: “May be, but you forget I have
a reputation to maintain ! ”
* * * *
The question as to whether one or two
policemen behaved invalorously in the Melb.
Eastern Market tragedy excitement very soon got
settled to the satisfaction of the Eoorce. One
Goodison was alleged to have made a statement of
police backwardness in coming forward, or for-
wardness in keeping out of the way. Therefore
four detectives and inspectors came along to
Goodison and asked him if he intended to accuse
the police of cowardice, and Goodison not un-
naturally said “No” with a capital N. Also he
threw in the remark that Constable somebody
showed “ coolness, courage, and discretion,” after
which the regiment of ’tecs felt more than proud
of their comrades, and went away, leaving Goodi-
son to breathe again.

When a party of Christchurch (M.L.)

Memo, for Premier Turner, who is draft-

Rhodes was brought before Heidelberg (Vie.)
court—-vagrancy. Pound in a stable, starving—
which is about the meanest crime in the calendar.
Taken to the station, he spied some crumbs on the
cell-floor, and instantly devoured them. In the
intervals of difficult mastication, the old chap told
of his woes. Had been well-to-do. N Bix children,
all married. All right till his wife died —and
then “strangers came in, and robbed me of my
home. Ah ! there was no woman like my dear
old girl,” and he wept. The bench sent him to
gaol for six months. “I’d rather die,” he whim-
pered, “ than go to gaol.” “But at Geelong it
isn’t like a gaol,” said a sympathising constable ;
“ You’ll get the sea-breeze, and be treated tip-top.
I wouldn’t mind going there myself for a holi-
day.” The old fellow gazed at him through his
tears. “Ah, well,” said he, “ mebbe it isn’t as
bad as I thought. Can you give me another
crust V ”

Silverton, which bears to Broken Hill
much the same relation as that into which Cool-
gardie is drifting with regard to Kalgoorlie and
The Boulder, still retains a municipality, chiefly
because there aren’t enough people left there to
wind it up. For some years after Silverton’s
glories had faded, its chief business consisted of
removing itself into Broken Hill. Most of the
houses were of wood and iron ; some were pulled
to pieces first, and others were laboriously hauled
1G miles over bush-tracks. Even that industry
has failed these last three or four years, and its
occupation has since consisted of swapping horses
with passing stockmen, showing occasional visi-
tors the scene of the departed pub. where the boys
used up 20 doz. gold-top one evening, and
exchanging perjuries about “ slugs ” and
“ jumping ” cases. There hasn’t been any muni-
cipal election since the light failed, and nobody
pays rates ; when the aldermen want money to
buy stamps for a letter to the Govt, petitioning
for a special grant, they go out and pound some-
body’s goat. _ The other day the clerk, or ex-clerk
(this paper isn’t committing itself), sent in a bill
for =B4O, accumulated screw of several years. The
aldermen weren’t very sure whether there was a
clerk or not; in fact, they aren’t sure whether
they are aldermen or not. But on the off-chance,
and insufficient goats being available, they pulled
up some galvanised-iron fence and sold it to raise
funds to fight the clerk with in the courts. And
yet you can find Silverton printed in big letters
on some maps.

The delusion that jurors if they! agree
without leaving the box will be kept in the box
for the next case was “exploded” by N.S.W.
Judge Backhouse the other day. It is probable
this “ popular delusion,” as the Judge called it,
originated in seme whimsical Judge ordering a
jury who so agreed to stay for another case. Which
shows that Judges should take no liberties with
juries. For instance, ’twas once a popular delu-
sion with many jurors that if they found a map

the man’s neck would inevitably be spared.
Judges and Executives, however, took liberties
with juries in this respect—in fact, like Judge
Backhouse, exploded the popular delusion, and
now jurors go a far way around (as in the Flynn-
Kelly case) to find a murderer guilty of man-
slaughter alone, thus saving the man’s neck with-
out giving the Judge a chance to interfere.

ecclesiastical courts” is absurdly weak in face*of
the facts that the fidelity of even Archbishop
Temple himself has been questioned, and that
more than half his fellow bishops are as “ High ”
as they make ’em. The Australian episcopate is
similarly affected, and here the bishops have a
looser hold on their clergy. Primate Smith, of
course, is opposed to ritualistic purple and gold,
and crosses, and incense, and Gregorianism, but
there are at least three churches in Sydney that an
R.C. stranger might easily mistake on occasions
for temples of the Papacy.

Verily Sydney Sunday Times is real
cabbage-tree ! The Bulletin (keenly alive to
the fact that a paper only gets the sort of letters
it wants) reprints this from a half-column howl
in S. Times aforesaid about the urgent necessity
for plenty of flogging in Australia :
Flogging at the cart’s tail is generally supposed to have
ceased after 1827, but several instances are on record of
that punishment being imposed up to 1836. This vanished
system not only inflicted deep physical suffering, but also
great public degradation, and it is to be hoped that the
Government of any country will not be under the painful
necessity of renewing public punishment of such descrip-
tions.
“It is to be hoped ” Govt, will not be under the
painful necessity of—nailing anyone’s ears to the
pump ! What a lovely idea for the year 1899 .
By the way, the S. Times office is situate in the
old cart-tail-flogging district, ihe punishment
for purloining oars from a waterman s wherry was
flogging at the cart’s-tail down Druitt-stieet to
Darling Harbor. , , *
Shocking little Melb. boys have discovered
Lord Brassey’s falling sickness, and now when
H.E. rides abroad, or walks, or drives, or sails, or
propels himself on a machine, he is greeted with
shrill yells of “ Fall off, Governor ! ’
Be N.S.W. “Lieutenant-Col.” Neild’s
contention that the letters to his superior officers
which have been adjudged insubordinate were
not written in his military capacity, but upon the
basis of his Parliamentary position, The Bulletin
supposes that if, some day, in actual resistance to
invasion, some Parliamentary warrior or other
should be charged with prematurely retreating,
he would explain that he was running away
merely in his civil capacity, and strictly without
prejudice to his military intrepidity.
The German communities in S.A. are dis-
tinguished by their frugality. It transpired in a
court case, the other day, that for 3d. a week one
can be a member of the Kranken und Begrabniss
TJnterstiitzungs-Kasse—which in itself is a good
deal for one’s money—and command the services
of a specially-selected German doctor. Also it
was mentioned that members called in their medi-
cal adviser for consultation upon agricultural and
other problems, and then forgot to make any pro-
vision for him in their wills—which, indeed, was
what this law-suit was about.
“ J.F.D.” : Undertaker who is also a
“ sojer ” told me t’other day that before he went
to recent Sydney encampment he knocked up two-
dozen coffins for stock, but business was so brisk
that he had to return two days before breaking-up
and resume casket-building.
George Burgess, the
well-to-do baker of York
(S.A.) who went suddenly
demented, and butchered his
wife and children, and then
committed suicide, stuck
closely to the traditions of
his kind in one respect. He
got up early in the morning
and did the slaughter. Most
demented people who butcher
their families or commit sui-
cide do it early in the morn-
ing—provided, that is, they
quietly develop into the re-
quired mental condition. If
their incipient madness is
brought to a head by sudden
excitement, as in Napoleon
Lis son’s case, this rule
doesn’t apply, "*|jyt if Lisson
hadn’t been hurried into in-
sanity by external events he
would also, most probably,
have developed quite silently
till he also became ap early-
rising homicide. Apparently
the voices that moan in the
ear of the man with the tot-
tering intellect moan their
loudest in the early morning
when there are no passing
carts to drown the row. Pos-
sibly insanity leads-to, early
rising—or perhaps early rising
leads to insanity. Anyhow,
the old man who is found
hanging in the barn, and the
old woman whose remains are
discovered in the drinking
water, mostly get there al iout
6 a.m. in the winter or 4 a. m.
in summer. And in fully half
the cases where the whole
family is obliterated with an
axe the horror is first dis-
covered because some other
early-rising person (who will
probably murder his own
family later on) sees blood
under the front door when he
comes with the milk, or the
early meat, or the paper.
There was much unreported fun at a re-
cent swell banquet mainly through the vagaries
of a wealthy and ancient squatter. He had paid
£2 2s. for his ticket, and was determined to make
a profit on the transaction. His feet were sore,
and he staggered the august company by appear-
ing in carpet slippers and pepper-and-salt tweeds.
When the eating began he was observed to be
“ pouching ” heavily, and he informed the scan-
dalised importer on the right that he would enjoy
“ them” when he got back home. The carcase-
butcher on the left drew his attention to a large
and beautiful jelly, and later on he induced the
old man to hold his pocket open, and flopped the
jelly in. Later on the ancient cursed that carcase-

butcher to his face. When the show was over he
sat on the steps of the banqueting-hall, with the
neck of a ehampage-bottle sticking out of his
chest-pocket, and raked the jelly from a case-full
of assorted fruits that the carcase-inan had poured
in on top of it, and flung it with curses to a crowd
of small buys, while some distracted female rela-
tives tried to get him into a cab. When he had
scraped out the jelly and put the fruit back he
pulled off his slippers, told the cabman to drive to
the Federal capital, and walked down street in
grey socks trying to comfort the poor girls with
repeated assurances that he had a “ bootiful
sooper ” for them. And he owns several flourish-
ing stations.

Bad policy for a member of “cronk”
society to wag a loose tongue in court. A young
larcenist, at Melb. Criminal Court the other day,
asking for lenient treatment on the first offence
ticket, was told that “his cross-examination
showed him to be intimately acquainted with the
language, customs, and resorts of abandoned
women and thieves.” He had practically been
owning up to previous offences all the time that
the man in the big wig was taking notes.

the deceased Tom or Tabby is fed to his live

It is a woman, if you please, who sends
this to The Bulletin
The young men of Albury' are to be congratulated on
their exclusion of the fair sex (including clergymen) from
their debates. The ruination of every debating-society
dates from the evening when some weak-eyed softy gets
up with a grin and begs for “ the refining influence of
the ladies.” When a young man joins a debating-society
he does serin order to debate ; when a woman joins, nine
times out of ten, it is to look at the young man, and from
thence the society degenerates into gigglings and “ l-do-
thiriks” (which is woman’s nearest approach to argu-
ment), till the young-man part of the society 7 dies out in
a thin fringe of amorous youths waiting to see their girls
home. The Salon of a century ago was a capital institu-
tion because it consisted of many men and a few picked
women, but we can never hope for the Salon again. The
commonplace women would swamp it.

savagely at his victim’s lacerated back.

Awhile ago many a stranger who
dropped in upon Perth unannounced had
veil- satisfied with a shake-down on the
billiard-table —no ordinary four-posters
being available. But to-day, according
to the humble prayer of the local Bung
Association to the Licensing Bench, you
could march an army in and get bunk
accommodation on the spot. Bung’s little
list is supplied to support his plea that
he has too much competition already;
and to that extent it may be sniffed at
suspiciously. Nathless, the association
secretary has sworn to it more or less, and
has deposed that he found one pub. with
25 beds, all of which were empty ; others
with 22, 7, 12, 12, 18, 9, 26, and so on in
the same unprofitable state. Of 1300
beds in the Perth district pubs., less than
400 were occupied when this “census”
was taken.
Perhaps, in late years, and in Austra-
lia, there never has been a greater
scramble for beds than there was on the
Tas. West Coast when Zeehan and Dun-
das began to be talked about, and when
the thousands who had 4 ‘ just missed it ”
at Broken Hill trekked across to pick up
a few of the scores of bigger plums with
which the bleak Coast was, of course,
stuffed. The landing-place then was at
Trial Harbor—a magnificent port out of
which the miserable cockle-shells scudded
on the first signs of an approaching storm.
Writer was offered, at the only pub., the
choice between the bar-form and the
coach standing outside; he preferred to
bunk in the latter, with two others.
First thing in the morning (it was driz-
zling, as usual) the boss came round col-
lecting; half-a-crown a head for “accom-
modation.” It was part up or get down
in the drizzle. Later on, at Zeehan,

M.L.C., now an M.L.A. ; No. 21 one of the
best - known mine - managers in Australia, sup-
posed just then to be representing Lansell.
No. 7 died next day, and all below him went
up one. Eight went out prospecting, some
more returned to the mainland, and in three days
No. 20 was No. 3. Two days after that he was
promoted to a bed.

The maiden morn, full-lipped and tender-browed,
Rich in the promise of a perfect day,
Now paces, joyous, on her sun-flecked way,
Charming the camp-smoke into crimson cloud,
To float in majesty, serene and proud,
About her veiled feet. And far away,
Around some mountain’s verdured crest to stay,
Low-ling’ring o’er a forest golden-boughed.
The bells chime clearlj 7 from an echoing creek,
The hobbles jingle musical and low,
The fairy cobwebs, diamonded with dew,
Tremble with joy divine as poets seek.
The morning breezes whisper as they blow ;
Up bursts the sun, and day begins anew.
WILL. M. FLEMING.


Amy Castles, the much-paragraphed Australian
song-bird, will, no doubt, wing her flight to Europe to
perfect her voice by the highest artistic training. Just
as cultivation perfects the harmonies of song, so do P.D.
corsets perfect the harmonies of graceful curves and flow-
ing outlines of the female form divine. A pair of P.D.’s
cultivates the figures as effectively as a Marchesi cultivates
the voice. Borsdoff and Co. are agents for this invalu-
able aid to feminine attractiveness.*
“Lead Kindly Light,” the beautiful poetic in-
spiration, was written by Cardinal Newman. The light
that leads all other earthly lights is given by the “ Alba-
tross Lamp Wick.” They “ require no trimming,” have
no smell, give a greater light, prevent explosions and
broken chimneys, and are the woman’s friend.*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, April 17, 1899.
My Dear Myee—
Never have I heard the word “ Magnificent ” so
flayed upon for all, and more than all, it was
Wprth, as at the great Army meeting last week,
when General Booth told the story of his life.
Lately, Magnificent has seemed to be getting a
little rusty. Everything to-day is Great. The
play was “great.” The ball was “great.” The
supper was “great.”- The cricket was “great,”
which does not mean Great any more than the
frightful “colonial” horror, “not too stinking,”
means that something didn’t smell bad.
In most people’s youth, Magnificent took a hol-
low sound from the unrealities of history learnt at
school, and never lest it. But last Tuesday there
was a revival, and Chief Justice Darley said the
General’s speech was Magnificent, and G. R.
Dibbs said “such a Magnificent speech I have
never heard. ” And plain Mr. George Reid shook
out a lot of tidy sentiments through which Mag-
nificent leaped and bounded wherever a place
opened for an epithet. Such a run on one word
might mean sincerity. Or it might mean that the
seventy-year-old General had not struck off in-
spiration enough to suggest a word apiece to those
three great minds.
On his seventieth birthday, he who may be the
man of the century next century, looked shrunken
with illness. His long, yellow-grey beard fell flab-
bily on his chest, and his long, red nose was pinched.
The eyes were not too dim to show the hollows
round them. He twitched nervously and looked
round constantly for draughts. When he got up
to speak I wondered how on earth he was going to
get through five minutes—much less 70 years. His
voice was a sort of growly husk without any
quality. He built it up as he went on, and pre-
sently there he was shouting and shooting humor
and humanity right away to the back rows of the
gallery. It was a hot and stirring cry from high
levels. But the cold earth-word ‘ ‘ collection ” came
in and spoilt everything. Why don’t the orators
realise that ?
“The Story of My Life” was not what the
General told. Nobody regretted, though. It is
only the man of 20 who legitimately tells the story
of his long and wicked and extraordinary career.
Thirty tries it, and ends in—well, perhaps in
kisses. Forty feels that the story wouldn’t be in-
teresting from middle-aged lips. Fifty begins to
remember. Sixty keeps on reviving. Seventy has
got it all by heart. But, just then, nobody wants
to listen. With a sublime knowledge of human
nature—perhaps including his own—the General.
kept the most part of his story to himself.
Sydney Liedertafel is flourishing. It opened
its new season last Wednesday to what is con-
sidered a record house for the first night of the
new season. The V.R. patronage swelled itself
out with Judge Real from Queensland, Mr. Henry
Dilke, and a big party of Burdekins, who always
come out strong at Liedertafel concerts.
But why do some people go to concerts to do what
they could do just as satisfactorily at home? For
instance, you see a young, pretty girl come in with
her party. With much spread and ceremony she
lays her cloak out over the seat in front, fingers
its fur edge, pats, strokes, gazes ; inspects her
gloves ; switches her skirts first one way, then the
other; finally, fastens her eyes on her jewelled
corsage. From beginning to end of the concert
she sits and contemplates the loveliness of that
little chiffon bodice. Only one thing in the hall
exists for her—the frock outside of herself. But
why pay four shillings to come and look at it in
publie?
The programme only ran off the usual Lieder-
tafel lines when it announced that “Roberto ” was
“Toi que j ’Odoro.” Otherwise, it was punctuated
with the usual type of orchestral numbers, and
choruses where rather less robust tenor voices than
of yore made themselves heard. Madam Helen
Roze was the only lady-warbler. She hails from
the Carl Rosa Co., and sang with much culture
and an agreeable quality of voice. Perhaps she
would have made more of a hit if her personal
appearance had been more becomingly accen-
tuated. Mr, Richards, the male soloist of the
evening, was a little man with nerves and huski-
ness. M. Stael’s violin solos were entirely de-
lightful, finished, and thrilling. It seems that
this fine fiddler is getting into his work more and
more of the warmth one has sometimes missed.
A delightful fete last week was the Old High-
School Girls’ re-union. For this, the big, bare
building went into ecstasies of Chinese lanterns
and laughter, and decorations artfully turned out
of palms and waste-paper baskets. Mrs. Garvan,
the head-mistress, received the several hundreds
of mostly fresh young guests. Looking round, it
seemed as if the Old Girls, who turned up in large
are not to be comprehended by that
term. Ethel Turner was there in a white silk
frock with pink satin sleeves. Florence Mack
warbled. Miss Mercy Murray, in clinging yellow,
recited charmingly some of “The Lady of Lyons,”
which shows that school-room recitations are alto-
gether reaching up.
Ada Evans, the much-talked-of Sydney grad,
who is now going pluckily through our law-
schools, is an old High School girl. In appear-
ance she is ; a fragile-looking little woman, with
naturally.-fnzzy hair, a delicate complexion, and
bright, vivacious eyes. At school she was thought
very pretty—that may help her if ever she gets a
jury but not the sort to blossom (or wither) into
a lawyer.
A rest and luncheon room for shop-girls was
opened on Monday afternoon by Mr. James Fairfax,
supplemented by a few words from the Rev. Carr-
Snnth. A bright, sunny room in the new markets
is the chosen haunt. Working-girls, who now have
to take their bread and tea among the cockroaches
at the back of their ‘ ‘ establishments, ” may have
a quiet hour here, with white tables and chairs
and magazines. Tea for a penny is the special
feature. The girls may bring their own lunohes
if they like, and it is actually whispered that there
won’t be any attempt to cultivate, reform, or in
any way interfere with the privacy of the indi-
vidual with needle-worn fingers who likes to wash
down the gilded doings of noveletted duchesses
with her pen’orth of tea.
Next Friday, April 28, is the date fixed for the
French ball. It comes off at the Paddington
Town Hall under V.R. patronage, and ought to
be a brilliant success.
One of the prettiest brides seen in Sydney for a
long time was Miss Nina Church, married last
week to Mr. Ernest Wilshire, S.M. The wedding
came off on Wednesday afternoon at Christ
Church, and created quite a stir up Haymarket
way. The charming bride-—and the first word
isn’t used simply because it is followed by the
the second, as this bride is a black-haired, blue-
eyed beauty with a profile—was arrayed in decol-
lete white duchesse, draped with real lace, no
orange blossoms, but plumes in the hair and a veil
falling backwards. Some tiny boys in black satin
page suits, and tinier girls in white muslin frocks,
followed as bridesmaids and pages. After a brisk
interval of speeches, Mr. and Mrs. Wilshire went
qff on a secret honeymoon which is to continue
itself later at The Australia for a few weeks. The
bride’s going-away dress was a grey coat and skirt,
and braidfed heliotrope vest.
The history of one young couple, who were mar-
ried last month at Randwick Presbyterian Church,
was spiced with romance by “ Tattersall.” They
became engaged last year, but had little or no
prospect of being speedily wed. In October,
however, they approached “ Tattersall ” with a
modest 55., and drew the winning horse in a Cup
sweep. Their investment netted £4OOO, with
which tidy sum they have set up housekeeping.
Yet another naval engagement. This affair
belongs to the daughter of a lately-deceased soli-
citor and a smart young officer. Most society
girls declare that naval men are nice to talk to,
charming to dance with, but to marry —oh, dear
no ! Too much away from home, too little money.
But, as someone once sapiently observed some-
where, “asking makes all the difference;” and
the name of rejected British officers is certainly
not legion. When, as in this case, the bride-elect
is well dowered, the latter objection does not hold.
A quiet little wedding that came off last week,
at St. Augustine’s, Neutral Bay, was that of Miss
Mayne, daughter of Alec. Mayne, the popular
theatrical manager, and Mr. Harry Martell, of
Melbourne. The bride wore white muslin and a
white hat, and her two pretty sisters in pink
muslin and pink hats followed as bridesmaids.
Emily Soldene’s farewell matinee comes off at
the Criterion Theatre on Tuesday, May 2. The
snappy programme includes Rignold, Mr. and
Mrs. Brough, Phil Newbury, and the Soldene
herself as Serpolette in “Les Cloches de Corne-
ville. ”
Pattie Browne went off to Melbourne last week,
to receive a benefit matinee, given to her by Mr.
Harry Rickards at his own theatre. This does not
look like a quarrel between Rickards and Pattie.
In fact, I have it from the only Harry himself
that there never was the slightest ground for any
such rumors.
Coining over the water lately a lively member
of an imported co. shared her cabin with a lady
missionary. The missionary bore in silence for a
long time the peculiarities of the latter’s toilette,
but one day she couldn’t help herself and broke
out, “Oh, my dear, let me beseech you, do give
up that dreadful paint. If I used it / should be
as beautiful as you are, but you see I wouldn’t. ”
“Why don’t you,” said the frisky one, “Gawd
must know you need it. Come, do have a loan of
my rouge-pot! ”
The fact that Mr. James Arthur Pollock won
his appointment as Professor of Physics after
“open competition with the world” speaks
volumes in favor of the Sydney born and bred
fraduate, and of the educational power of the
Iniversity. Prof. Pollock will, undoubtedly,
receive an ovation on Commemoration Day. Mr.
Henderson, who is filling Prof. Wood’s position
during the latter’s 12 months’ leave of absence, has
had the title of Acting Professor conferred upon
him for that period. There are rumors of another
appointment to be made at the University, but
whether this is only idle rumor or a foreshadowed
fact it is yet too soon -to say.
Other appointments lately made in connection
with science and engineering at the University are
those of Mr. Basil Turner, A.R.S.M., as lecturer
for one year in metallurgy ; and Mr. T. Brearley,
B.Sc., as senior demonstrator (under Prof. Pol-
lock) and Mr. G. Harker, 8.E., as junior demon-
strator. Mr. Brearley is, perhaps, most widely
known at the University in connection with the
dramatic society of which he has always been a
conspicuous member. Mr. Harker is a promising
young scientist, whose sister also won high laurels
at Sydney University ; they are closely related to
the “Money-Millers,” of Melbourne. Mr. Basil
Turner, as his degree implies, has lately arrived
from England.
Sydney University is' very proud of its medical
professors. _ Dr. Anderson Stuart is quoted as an
authority in various works of medicine in addi-
tion to being at the head of “My Medical School.”
Dr. Has well is part-author of a work on Zoology
widely used as a text-book: while Dr. Wilson is
splendidly educated and perhaps the inost broadly
scientific of them all. But this, it seems, is not
enough. Their wives must be learned us well.
Mrs. Haswell (a Maorilander) is also a B.Sc., and
now it is said that Mrs. Wilson (nee Miss Mabel
Salomons) is entering upon the three years’ Science
course at the University. Mrs. Wilson always
had a leaning for the higher education and it was
while studying anatomy that she met her future
lord. . Mrs. David also takes a thorough and tech-
nical interest in her husband’s scientific pursuits.
The many friends of M. L4on Caron are work-
ing up a testimonial matinee for this deserving
director, who is going away, like a good French-
man, to see his mother at Boulogne. The date of
the matinee is fixed for April 28.
The latest news of the Fancy Fair in aid of the
Consumptive Home fund is that the fair will open
on Thursday, August 10th, at the Exhibition
Building.
Some newly-arrived pieces of music are : Jones’
second Barn Dance (Paling and Co.), which bears
no visible relationship to the other Barn Dance
and comes on the scene a little late, as the Barn
Dance is commonly supposed to be dead; “Love
of My Life, ’tis You,” with words and music by
Charles Kenmngham (Allan and Co.), a simple
uneventful little ballad that does hot try to be
flashy, and owes much to Pat Bathurst, who sings
it m the “ Geisha the “May Queen Waltz,” by
Violet Guiseppe Truda (Palingand Co.), a change-
u , rr } easure with a lot of con sentimento about it
which ought to make it and its' waltzers go well in
a ball-room.
I have also received a little book called the
Household Manual,” by Mrs. Theo. Winning
from Moree. Something fresh and wholesome
attracts one to this nice little publication ; it
seems to have got the gum-trees into its hints
and recipes. . Someone who has tried them tells
me that the jams and preserves are especially ex-
cellent. The book isn’t all recipes—it covers the
ground from Mutton Broth and “What to Do
till the Doctor Comes,” to “How to Look Your
Best at a Ball.” I filch the latter for you. “ Take
a warm bath with a little ammonia in it, drink a
cup of hot milk, and lie down for an hour before
dressing. Just before starting take a spoonful of
sal volatile.”
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“Amy Castles, whose Tuesday concert drew a
second crowd and who was applauded and
blarneyed to the top of her bent ivhen she sang at
ot. Vincents Fair, is a product of Carlton (where
the fool ‘ beaks ’ come from), transplanted to
Bendigo, four years ago. In private life the
warbler is a naive, countryfied chit. On the eve
of her Town Hall debut, she seemed chiefly con-
cerned lest her feet should look big in the white
shoes prescribed for the occasion by a feminine
board of advice. Ma Castles, one hears, wastes no
love on certain doubting Thomases of the
Metropolis, who persistently credit the 17-year-old
Amy aforesaid with having tasted her 20th birth-
day-cake. ‘Things are come to a pretty pass,’
complams the fond parent in question, ‘ when
11 i} lts °f boys ” down-face a mother about the age
of her own offspring ! ’
. “Amy Castles was ‘discovered’ in the first
instance by a Melbourne lady during a recent
visit to Bendigo, where the damsel’s voice has
been asserting itself, more or less, for the past five
years.. An elder, or younger, sister also had a
big voice until she warbled the bulk of it away.
The Melb. lady, reckoning that she could work a
boom for Amy, made overtures to the girl’s
parents, toqk her to Melbourne, rigged her out in
appropriate style, and entered her for an ‘ under
21 ’ musical scholarship, in which she was
understood to finish second. A boy violinist, Foley
Westwood, got the scholarship. Then the entre-
preneuse introduced her protegee to the Austral
Salon crowd, who took her up on the understand-
ing that they were discovering her. Much para-
graphing followed, with the result that the indus-
trious real discoverer thought she couldn’t go
wrong in running her little Amy at the Town
Hall. She didn’t go wrong, for (with her co-
guarantors, if any) she takes a half share of the
handsome profits. The story of how Amy Castles—
a singer of some years’ practice—came to be sprung
upon Melbourne as a 17-year-old novice is very
interesting.
“Pianist Muller, another prodigy of the mo-
ment, played at the Austral Salon (Monday, April
10th). Said Fritz is a small-sized, 11-year-old,
with wistful, elderly face, and straight, thickly-
growing hair, worn longish. As a juvenile
exquisite, he is not to be compared with the
Salon’s former musical protege, blue-eyed Grainger
of the golden curls, snowy collar and Eton jacket.
Instead of discussing Art in the abstract with
Salomtes of all ages, after the manner of the ele-
gant Percy G. in his day, little Fritz, in the
intervals of his performance, steadily ate cakes
and skipped round the rooms with a girl of his
own size, in the wake of the lump-sugar. To the
programme the urchin contributed much Schubert
and Chopin, all without the score and rendered
with feeling, though his tiny hands handicapped
him somewhat as an executant.
That was an extra-festive Salon gathering, by
the way. Lovely flowers, tea scented like a nose-
gay,. professional entertainers. Ida Osborne,
smiling as ever in blue suit and toque, surpassed
herself in IVta Babbie, ’ that motherly, hush-a-bye
croon of some soft, fat, caressing negress. Bertie
Zelman fiddled, the hostess’s pretty daughter
sang, elocutionists Osmond and Morris gave
bright, unhackneyed recitations. The hostess
that afternoon was Mrs. Horace Wills, formerly
of Springsure district (C.Q.). Hubby Horace
Wills and his brother Cedric were boys at school
in England when their father, with 17 others, was
murdered by the blacks on a station near Spring-
sure. ‘ Murder Scrub ’ souvenirs the tragedy
thereabouts to this day ; and also apropos thereof,
more than one sane, sober old resident of that
district swears to a phantom blackfellow, said to
ride Springsure road at certain times of the year.
“The wedding of the week (April 12th) was
that of Dean Vance’s daughter Ruby to Dr.
Charlie Alsop. The victims made an ideal couple.
She—fair, plump, petite and smiling. He—tall,
dark, slight and perturbed. Clerical circles get
well initiated into ecclesiastical pomps and cere-
monies, and never was a marriage celebrated more
‘ decently and in order ’ than this particular one.
The portly Dean led his daughter to the sacrifice
m the usual white satin, court train, transparent
sleeves and chemisette, pearl necklet, &c. Bishop
Coe, in fatherly tones, joined the young things in
the bonds. Five pretty maids gowned in white
silk, hatted with violet velvet, and poised with
purple orchids and autumn leaves, stood in grace-
ful attitudes and saw that not a fold of the bride’s
train fell ungracefully. The Cathedral interior
looked its best, choristers sang, organ played,
chimes rang out, presents were plentiful, all
parental authorities delighted. ‘lf that’s not
bliss, what is ? ’
“ Orating recently at the National Mutual Life
meeting, Chief Justice Madden (where doesn’t he
orate !) said that every wealthy person he knew
personally 21 years ago was either in the Benevo-
lent Asylum or had died in the odor of poverty.
At that long-past time, Jack Madden was just be-
ginning to get a foothold in law, but a few years
previously, when his degree was newly-fledged, he
fell under the ban of a Melb. matron who had
jumped to the erroneous conclusion that the pro-
spective C. J. was matrimonially-inclined towards
her daughter. The old lady freely denounced
Madden as a man ‘ with nothing in him, ’ and fore-
told that he would never make his way in the
world —being thus much beside the mark in the
latter statement, however accurately she may have
hit it in the former. The damsel, bundled off to
another province, made, financially, a much better
match, and was afterwards very near catching a
Premier for a second husband.
“ The ‘ Belle of New York ’ goes on her way re-
joicing rather more than heretofore. She might
show her lovely teeth oftener than she does, with-
out giving spectators just cause to call her ‘proud.’
A domestic and etiquette encyclopaedia, revered
by our mothers in their youth, says : ‘lf your
teeth are fine, unostentatiously turn the conversa-
tion into sprightly channels ; if otherwise, the
serious rdle will prove more suitable to your style.’
“Belle Bucklin and most of the N’Yorkers
seem dentally gifted. S’pect their pearls groxved,
though such wonders are told of American den-
tists. Over thar, ’tis said, if a tootsie is the teeni-
est mite irregular, you part with him in the sure
and certain hope of a-glorious artificial substitute.
On this side, Nature as an ivory-manufacturer
still makes hacks of the field.
Ihe most pathetic incident of the Service
funeral was the utter collapse of poor old Duncan
Gillies. The hero of the boom-time has always
been regarded, even by his warmest supporters, as
a coldblooded, unsympathetic person ; but when
the body of bis old colleague disappeared into the
grave, the Gillies that nobody had seen before was
revealed. People approached to sympathise, but
the old man would have none of them, and walked
off by himself with his head bowed and tears
streaming down his cheeks.
The Loretto Convent, at Ballarat, has been
housing a German Countess for the past few
months. The lady is young, charming, wealthy,
and travels with an elderly duenna. Having
letters of introduction to the'Superior of the Con-
vent, the Countess looked her up, took a fancy to
the Convent, and elected to pass a few months in
the cloister. She even studied for matric., with
the idea of taking a degree at Melb. University,
but changed her mind and left a week or two ago
for the land of lager, intending to rush back to
Loretto nunnery ere the end of the year. Many
things, however, may happen to curb the Coun-
tess’s piety before Dec. 31.

“ O. J.” : First met Medor (who ran amok
in Melb. Eastern Market) 18 years ago, in the
National Hotel, Bourke-street, Melb. He wanted
to work my bumps. Wouldn’t permit it; but
paid the fee (half-a-crown). Medor asked me why
I objected to be examined. Told him that, if
there was any truth in his science, I was a scoun-
drel ; if there wasn’t, there was still some evi-
dence in that direction. He handed back the
half-crown: “You know more than I,” he ob-
served, sadly. “ Let us have a drink.”
Peter Phillips, who for nearly 20 years
has been sec. of Bendigo Miners’ Association, and
the most prominent man in the crowd, has re-
signed his office, alleging that for three or four
years past friction between other executive offi-
cers and himself has been increasing until it has
become intolerable. But, after an almost even
contest, the committee has elected him to hold
office till the annual appeal to the members ; and
then it is more than likely that the old one-armed
battler will triumph again.
A reporter was interviewing “ General ”
Booth three years ago in Perth (W.A.), re the
proposed dumping down in that province of
several thousand English ex-oonvicts. Scribe
asked: “Stripped of the military title you have
given your following, what would you call them?”
“A Mosaic democracy,” was the answer. The
reporter looked at the Hebraic features of the
General, and remarked, “ Then you are Moses? ”
“I am,” was the calm reply. And it is true;
with only this difference, that whereas the other
Moses destroyed the golden calf, Moses Booth
embraces it.
“T.”: Be “Locust’s” paragraph on the
good times Tyson might have had. Stayed
at Woorooma once with squatter Loeky
M‘Bean, who had been expressing a desire
to travel and see things generally. Said
the writer : “ Why don’t you do it ? Your
money is no good to you—your’re living
here like a blackfellow.” “Eh, mon, awin
too auld, there’s the gettin’ tackets, an’
lookin’ after yer luggage, an’ arthot.”
“ Get some smart young fellow who
wants to see the world ; he’ll attend to get-
ting the tickets, and so on—and you can
no doubt get one at a very small salary.”
The old boy listened to it all, then laid a
shaking finger emphatically on the palm of
his outstretched hand and replied : “ Aye, and
pay his expanses, mon ! ”
Hosie, the recently-dead Melb. caterer,
started business in the long ago with big, fat,
highly-seasoned mutton pies, for which he charged
3d., and as the great Australian bank-note-sand-
wich-and-champagne era was then only just dying
out, the amazing cheapness of Hosie’s pies struck
the popular imagination a big advertising blow in
its stomach. Everybody ate Hosie’s pies. Eminent
counsel even came into court with crumbs of Hosie
clinging to their whiskers, and stains of mutton-
fat on their briefs. Hosie’s pies were the first
indication that the Melbourne “ d—n the change ”
era had passed, and that the despised tray-bit had
re-acquired an appreciable value.
Rev. Dr. Lang, who is to be com-
memorated in Brisbane for his herculean
immigration labors of the early days, had
three ruling ideas which he rung-in on
almost every theme he discussed. One of
these was antipathy to Sydney Govt.
House. Fitzroy, the first Australian
Governor-General, lived there then, and
one of Lang’s many allusions to the place
was—“ There is no slum in London that
stands more urgently in need of a thorough
clean-out.” Another ruling idea was that
more Scotch immigrants should be im-
ported to counteract the Irish, as he be-
lieved there was a conspiracy to make
Australia an appanage of Rome. That was
why he chartered the Fortitude for Bris-
bane. Third, he believed Australia should
cut the painter from Britain and start at
once as a Republic. He emphasised these
several beliefs with the energetic banging
of a fat umbrella.
Julius Vogel, the man of many
vicissitudes, was particularly fortunate in
his domestic relations. His wife, a lovely
blonde in her youth, and a woman of regal
beauty in middle life, was thoroughly de-
voted to him, and during his gout-stricken
years of physical helplessness attend d on
him with untiring watchfulness. Before
Vogel attained to the Premiership he was
regarded in official society at Wellington
as a somewhat under-bred adventurer, and
his young wife did not, in consequence,
receive the recognition which Vogel con-
sidered her due. The great social panjan-
drum of the windy Maorijand metropolis in
those days was the wife of the senior
puisne Judge, and she had taken a lead-
ing part in—well, not encouraging the
Vogels. But when Julius became the
popular Premier, whose Public Works
policy was to give the Midas’ touch to
Maoriland, he had his revenge. The Chief
Justice, Arney, dying, the senior puisne
naturally expected the post, to which his
position and his commanding ability cer-
tainly entitled him. His friends danced
attendance on the Vogels for weeks, and
much mud was eaten to propitiate the
Premier, but eventually the vacancy was
conferred on Prendergast, a comparative
mediocrity.
David Syme is probably less sus-
ceptible to humor than any other man on
the Australian press. David rarely smiles,
and when he does it is merely a physical
effort, a spasmodic contraction of the mus-
cles of one side of the face. Nearly all the
members of his staff have at one time or
other had a go at the alleged humorous
columns in his publications, but the effort
to satisfy David’s sense of humor is like
feeling out in the dark for the bottom of
the abysmal void with an umbrella-handle.
The “Wise and Otherwise” department
in Saturday’s Age is personally edited by
David, and resembles a procession of leaden
tombstones in a barren land.
Captain Roger Turpie, who is being
lassooed, per Louis Becke, into the authors’pen in
London, should tell many thrilling stories of the
South Seas, as well as of the Australian coast in
the early days. Bor 50 years he cruised about
these quarters, retiring from time to time to his
cottage at Woollahra, Sydney. He was connected
with the John Williams missionary vessel for over
40 years—most of the time as chief officer.
HYDE PARK—HIS LAST HOME TAKEN.
WEABY DIOR: “ Well, I’ll be Mowed!“
Those Australians who wax wroth over the
alleged favoritism Shirley Baker showed the Ger-
mans in his days of Tongan power, and over Hig-
ginson, of New Caledonia, and M'Leod, of the
New Hebrides, taking oaths of allegiance to
France, should remember that Queen Victoria’s
second son, Edinburgh, similarly renounced his
allegiance to England, and that her third son
Connaught, announces himself as ready to do the
same.
The Bigsby gold medal for his Funafuti
achievements reached Prof. David, of Sydney
University, after much circumlocution. The Geo-
logical Society of London forwarded the medal to
N.S.W. Agent-General, who forwarded it to
N.S.W. Acting-Governor, who laid it on the
Executive Council table, thus forwarding it to the
Govt. Then Govt., represented by the Premier,
officially forwarded it to Minister Hogue, who
sent it to the Professor.
A lately-reported death is that of B. Rol-
tenius, one of the oldest German merchants in
Adelaide. A little knowledge of metallurgy
picked up at Freiburg and elsewhere induced the
German “colony” in Adelaide to get hold of a
solid block of Broken Hill shares very early ; and
more than one (including Mr. Noltenius) was able
to go back and smoke in comfort in the Father-
land. Others remained here—among them Mr.
Muecke; for years past a director of the co.
There is technically no hangman in the
employment of Vic. Penal Department. He is
apparently not on the pay-list, and there does
not show in the expenditure column of the
balance-sheet any casual item such as “ strangula-
tion, <£s 17s. 6d.” But the man-choker is there,
nevertheless disguised in the designation of
“ Gaol Messenger ” at £lOO a year. The sheriff
would look foolish some fine morning if the
scragman should refuse to act, on the ground that
he is not a scragman, but a messenger.
Gov. Tennyson, in mentioning his interest
in Australia in his first .speech at Adelaide, does
not seem to have alluded to his uncle Horatio,
who spent some years in Tasmania. He was
(vide the biography of the poet) “ sent off to try
his fortune in Tasmania,” after wanting to be .a
soldier, and that career being disallowed by his
mother. Horatio is still living in the Isle of
Wight. But there is only this brief reference to
him in . the Tennyson Life, and Gov. Tennyson
drops him. Why ? One hopes that Horatio was
a good boy. Is anything known of him in Tas-
mania? - . .
When Rear-Admiral Pearson was captain
in charge of the gunnery-school at Whale Island,
Portsmouth (Eng.), he was known by the men as
“Doggo,” from the way in which he followed
them about and kept an eye on their behaviour.
One of his fads was to keep the grass on the island
as level as a billiard-table. Shortly after his ap-
pointment he forbade the wearing of hobnail boots
by anyone on the island; and later on he would
not allow boot-protectors to be worn, as they were
supposed to cut-up the grass. Disobedience to
this order meant a spell of “ten A ” for the cul-
prit. Even the solitary horse on the island was
shod with specially-made boots to prevent him
disturbing the sward.
“Old Jack”: Sullivan, the Maungatapu
murderer, was not shipped to America. Went to
England, and in London was so shadowed by ’tecs
that his life became unbearable. So he took, ship
for Melbourne, where he was promptly arrested
and brought before Call, P.M., on some conve-
nient charge. Saw the brute in Court. He had
dyed his hair and beard jet-black, which served to
give him away. He stated that he was hunted
wherever he went. Discharged, he made his way
to Wedderburn —where at one time he had kept a
grog-shanty, wherein, as may be supposed, bloody
work had oft been done. The Wedderburn people
wouldn’t sell him food or shelter, and when he fell
sick he lay in an old shed, where a compassionate
woman brought him victuals. When he left the
district he made for N.S.W., and finally landed in
Wagga or Gundagai, where he pegged out in
hospital.

“A.JS.G.”: Knew a 14st. woman who
wasn’t afraid of the wildest bullock. Saw her
once in a small yard with one. Bullock charged
and charged, but she simply stepped aside, and
fetched him one over the nose with a waddy as he
passed. Then he sulked in a corner until she got
her gun. Killed and dressed him, and had car-
case caitud away. Also, once saw a N.S.W.
squatter fight a bullock with an axe. Bullock
charged ; man stepped aside and slung axe at
head. Axe stuck in jaw. Bullock rushed again ;
man got back, snatched axe out and waited for a
“knock-out.” Bullock came again, was chopped
behind the ear, and went under. Put that
squatter in an arena with a bull, and writer's
“ stuff ” wouldn’t go on coo. [The bull-fighting
of Spanish entertainment isn’t done with an axe,
and the squatter would find the toreador’s lance
as awkward a weapon as would Garcia the
squatter’s little chopper.— Ed. B.]

“ Heimsdal ” : How many of your readers
have eaten “ goanna ? ” A surveyor of my
acquaintance always cooked any he shot, and de-
clared the flesh butter than fowl. An erstwhile
Rylstono publican also would give half-a-crown
for a good fat one ; said he preferred it to any
other meat. Re “goanna’’-killing sheep. Have
seen them tackle a ewe which was down and
couldn’t rise ; and 1 believe they will go for any-
thing that can’t get away, even if it were an ele-
phant. II ive often seen them kill lambs and
half-grown hares, which they sneak up to when
asleep.
“ Eateu-Out ” : “ J.P.M.” (B. *25/3/’99)
says “he never found a twin in or out of kanga-
roo’s pouch.” Twin ’roos are certainly very rare,
nevertheless, I saw two joeys taken from one
mother a few years ago. Had several poddy ’roos
and added these to the number. They grew up
together, precisely alike in every respect, color,
marks, shape, size and sex (male). They left and
took hi the bush when about 10 months old. All
poddy ’roos do this at age of from 6 to 12 months
if given a free run. Only exception, to my
knowledge, was a female of the “blue flyer”
species, which always remained in the company of
the station horses. Came up to the yards with
them when run-in every morning, and would feed
about with them through the paddocks. Would
go under their bellies and round their heels, yet I
never saw one attempt to kick or bite her, and
there were some unbroken snorters amongst them

too. The ’roo once followed an old mare out with
a cart for 7 miles, got with a boundary rider’s
horses there, stayed with them for a week, and
then came home. The station dogs never inter-
fered with her, though a strange tyke coming
along often gave her a big run—but the “ flyer ”is
too speedy for the average bush dog—she never
came to any harm. A ’roo taken young is an easy
animal to poddy— except the wallaroo, which will
sulk, refuse milk, and clear out first chance. Also,
it is easy to teach a kangaroo to box. A poddy
takes to it quite naturally, and when a few months
old will shape up “on his own”—in fact, comes
round looking for fight. Uses only his “ hands,”
too, very rarely lifting a hind leg to rip, as in
tackling a dog.

“ Ben Sun ” : “ C.M.Gr.” says any female,
deprived of young, welcomes any means of reliev-
ing milk-pressure pain. Should have said “ most.”
Sheep and goats never mistake their young, and
will butt away the counterfeit, even when the pain
of milk-pressure must be excruciating.

“ \Yerrimee ” : A selector, living on the
bank of a lagoon, had a merino ewe that used
regularly to swim across the water to feed on the
other side. When called, she would plunge in
and swim back. Have often noticed sheep swim-
ming round in a tank. Some say they do it to
cool themselves ; but as the merino, as a rule, is
chary even about wetting its feet, the dip is prob-
ably an accident. Being too thick-headed to
swim straight ahead for anywhere, the jumbuck
paddles about till it drowns. Old boundary-
riders will tell you “ they go in for a cooler and
the weight of the wet wool drowns ’em.”

They were an aged German couple occupy-
ing one of M.L.’s Government “small farms,”
and they came in to Wellington to complain to
somebody. Laid on to the right department,
they burst in on the chief, and the husband began
(without preliminaries) : “De stoads and de
veesels dot you put my farm to gill de rabbids mit,
dey live and breed mit dem in de same ’ole and let
de rabbids ead me up.” Then wife : “ Und’t der
veesels und’t der rrabidds und’t der stoads.” He
(taking a breather): “ I dry and geep young duck
and der veesels dake dem.” She (keeping up the
staccato): “ Und’t der rrabidds und’t der vee-
sels .” He (warming up): “I go send my poy
get egg ad nide, and a veesel bide his pluddy
finger off. Bud dey don’t bide der tam rabbids,
dey live vid ” She (sitting down on the type-
writer) : “ Und’t der stoads ” He (placing a
inanurey boot on a bundle of new Grown lands
reports): “I go oud mit my dog to chase rabbids
und he go into der ’ole, he come oud vid von eye
oud.” She (crying): “ Und’t der .” But here
a powerful messenger intervened, and, as the old
pair wouldn’t leave, they had to be assisted.
They have yet to interview Seddon, and if he
can’t stop the rabbits, etc., “living in de. same
’ole ” they are going to tackle Gov. Ranfurly.

“S.S.” : Know an old miner on the Tas-
manian field who had never heard of Smiley or
Mark Twain, but who had a pet frog which he
had reared from a small, flat, green orphan, about
the size of a sixpence, to a monstrous, warty
creature with the sage expression of a fat deacon
after a hearty dinner. The old man kept his
queer pet in the folds of a wet sugar-bag, and fed
him on flies and other insects. The frog would
hold a pipe in his mouth, put up his fore-paws as
if in prayer, or yawn when bidden. Some-
body bet the proprietor a pound that his frog
would not return to him if put in the dam at the
Chum; but it did, hopping into the crown of his
hat, and settling there in a fat, contented way.
The old man wondered could I tell him how long
frogs lived. “ I’m sorter’fraid he’ll die soon, an’
leave me lonely,” he said ; “I've tried to rear
others in case, you know, but Jim, here, he’s
jealous, an’ he always kills ’sd-”
Steele Rudd ”: Have likewise seen ’roo
swimming in a flood- —also dead cows and hay-
stacks and big logs, but none of these ever put in
a stroke. Reared in a district where ’roo was
thicker than the stars —where one could fringe his
clothes-line with the ears of those that died quietly
round the humpy, and where, sometimes, ’twas
necessary to build a big yard and fill it full of ’roos
and wade in for days with prop-sticks and pitch-
forks to lay out those that wouldn’t starve, but
never saw one swim. Have seen them drown
frequently, and once sa w five go down at one gulp

“Widdin”: “The monotony of the
bush ! ” Bandicoots ! Have been lost in it and
heard its weird voices ahead and followed them •
behind, and gone back ; above, and found them in
the friction of interwoven branches. Its startling
shapes have stood out in the gloaming and mocked
me; its soldier-ants have put periods to my re-
flects ; its snakes, if not in my boots, have been
around them; its spiders have crawled over me
and its ground leeches have fattened on me. In
storm, its falling timber has frightened me; in
calm, its stillness has awed me—but its monotony
has never meddled with me 1

“Wallaroo”: Astonishing is the topo-
graphical ignoranceof N.S.W. bucolics. Carrying
in New England district lately, noticed that every
settlement pointed a directing finger-post at
Kangaroo Camp. Began asking distance thither,
and nearest I got to it was— “ Dunno ; but father
says it aint far.” This from a youth topping the
twenties. Was exasperated into asking one be-
whiskered young fellow if he had ever been out-
side his own paddock, and was gravely informed
that he had “been to Elsmore a few miles
away. Asked another bushie distance to next
township, and was told, after much consideration,
“ about nine miles.” Found it was 30 !

“ A.L.W.” : Any- reader know how cat-
fish’s (or jew-fish’s) nests are built? Numerous in
head-waters of Mary River, Q. The nest is a
perfect ring of stones (some weighing 51b.) averag-
ing 3ft. in diameter, embedded upon a submerged
sand-bank, no other stones, as a rule, being within
20 yards of a nest.
A wealthy turfite of many jamborees
was once ingeniously “played upon” by
his trainer. They had set out for a country
fixture with two good gallopers, and all
went well until the day before the meet.
Then the stately owner “broke out.”
Trainer and jockey knew that it would be
the same on the morrow : the boss would
make'a show of himself—the good thing
would be given away to all and sundry.
That night they carted him to bed, tacked
down the window blind, fixed a blanket
over the blind, so arranged the curtains as
to preclude the admission of any light what-
ever, left four big bottles of beer, a long
candle and matches on the table, annexed
his timepiece and departed. On awaking
next morning the sleeper fossicked round,
lit the candle, “ took a pull,” and relapsed
again. “Ditto, repeato,” during day.
Meanwhile, both his neddies had won, and
the trainer arrived just as the boss had got
downstairs to yell about his watch having
been stolen, and was being congratulated
all round. “What the is the meaning
of all this ! ” asked the bewildered owner.
“ Don’t know, sir. I was wondering why
I didn’t see you all day.” Classic language
passed on discovery of the trick, but, of
course, the trainer disclaimed all know-
ledge. “I was beginning to think they
had some d long nights in these parts,”
muttered the owner, as he made for the bar.

“ Timi ” : A couple of years ago
Mrs. Richards, wife pf a selector on
Buckingong station, near Narandera, N.S.
Wales, found a nest of wild duck, and
reared two of the ducklings until they
were 12 months old. They became very
tame, frequently coming to their mistress’s
window and tapping on the pane when in
want of food. Mrs. Richards presented
her pets to a Vic. squatter, who took them
home, clipped their wings, and they be-
came apparently quite reconciled to the
change of location. A few weeks ago Mrs.
Richards was awakened by a familiar noise
at her window; her ex-proteges, their
wings having grown, had flown back to
Buckingong, many hundred miles, after a
year’s absence. Correspondence with their
Vic. owner showed that six days before
their return to Buckingong the ducks had
been suddenly missed. These facts were
narrated to present writer by a recent
visitor to Buckingong, but he has unfor-
tunately forgotten the address of the Vic-
torian from whose homestead the ducks returned.

“Nitfc.”: Re Australian slang. “Ringer”
and “good iron ” are both derived from the game
of quoits ; a ringer being a quoit which rings the
peg, while “‘good iron ” corresponds to “good
ball” at cricket. “Straight wire” is obvious
enough, but not so “straight griffin.” Melbourne
man told me it came from the proverbial relia-
bility of the local detective sergeant Griffin, and
spread from the criminal class there to the
“ cronks ” elsewhere in Australia.

“ Ercildoune ” discovers a new blis-
ter :
Entomologists would delight in a certain little
W.A. specimen known as the “ cocktail.” The name
must be understood literally, for an intimate ac-
quaintance with the insect will at once show that
it is able to take its own part several times over. It
is always found in the neighbourhood of dead gums,
old stumps, &c., is about 3-16th of an inch long and
of variegated color, mainly peacock-blue ; its tail
is, however, a bright red and cocked-up, hence its
name. In defending itself it ejects a very blis-
tering secretion. 11 Cocktails ” can be gathered by
the quart, and might probably be utilised medici-
nally as Cantharides Occidentalis Australis.

Harry Stockdale on aboriginal mar-
riage customs :
Strange indeed are the aborigines’ marital regu-
lations. A black will gather his friends and invade
the country of an enemy for the sole purpose of
stealing a bride ; and when he has got her, some-
times at life-risk, the party assisting him to obtain
the woman are rewarded by being the first recipi-
ents of her favors. This is custom, whether the
husband likes it or not, and is in vogue generally
throughout Australia. Women who are taken after a tribal
fight by the victors, as the spoils of war, have an uncom-
monly rough time, being the common property of the tribe
until such time as they are chosen by leading men of the
tribe or by some special fighter with whom none care to
dispute title. Unfortunately, not only aboriginal women
of other tribes, but white women have been on different
occasions waylaid and abducted, or obtained wandering
in the bush as survivors from wrecked vessels. These
women all had to undergo the usage of “tribal
custom ” as related above. It has always been
found a matter of great difficulty to effect the release
of a white woman once in the possession of the blacks.
There are authentic records of a number of white women
having been carried off by the blacks—from squatters’
wives and daughters down to women of the poorest
class. A remarkable instance of a white woman fall-
ing into the hands of the blacks, and ultimately getting
away, was that of a woman who escaped from a wreck at
Wide Bay, on the Q. coast, and was taken possession of
by a neighboring tribe. After enduring much hardship
and outrage, news as to her whereabouts reached the
settlement, where was a convict who had been for some
considerable time with this particular tribe. He was
despatched to rescue the woman, which he heroically did,
swimming rivers with her on his back. This woman took

Apropos of aboriginal Jimmy Solomon s
breaking gaol at the Gilbertian township of Dan-
daloo, which has provoked some very common-
place comments in the press, The Bulletin rises
to remark that the love of liberty is the noblest
instinct implanted by Nature in the mind of man,
and no one who breaks gaol without violence
should be punished for it. Anyhow, the low-
comedy incident was laughed out of court, as the
offending blaekfellow explained that he had the
toothache, and had taken French-leave in order
to procure, in a paddock near by, some gohanna
gall—the aboriginal remedy for that complaint.
In the case of the aboriginal woman, aged 39, who
was going blind, and appealed to the N.S.W.
Aborigines Board for an allowance, let it be
remarked that the black native female of 39 is 10
years older than her white sister —and Heaven
help the white woman of 49 who is going blind
and has no friends to help her.

Started hare near middle of

The M‘Cooey expostulates :
Re Australian snakes and their mode of biting. Let
me say that there is no analogy between the English
viper and Australian snakes. No greater bosh was ever
written about the latter than appeared in last Nov.
Queensland Agricultural Gazette (official), although
from the pen of editor Boyd, F.R.G.S. The English
viper’s fangs are movable, and, when not in use, lie flat,
points backwards, being erected when the snake is about
to bite; whereas, in all Australian snakes—even in the
death adder (which is one of the viperidw)— the fangs are
permanently erected and immovable. There is, there-
fore, in the Australian snake no such pre-mordant erec-
tion of the fangs as Mr. Boyd refers to. The fang of an
Australian snake is firmly fixed in an anterior horizontal
jawbone, hinged to a shorter posterior bone ; and when
the snake is about to bite the anterior bone is pressed
down posteriorly, thus projecting the fangs forward, and
making them appear to be erectile. Mr. Boyd is also
wrong in saying that “ a snake does not bite —it strikes!”
The case is exactly the reverse ; and, if an Australian
snake didn’t bite and cling on with jaw-pressure, it
couldn’t force the poison from the glands, through the
fangs, into the wounds. The ignorance of the bushman
and the “ blackfeller ” is pardonable ; but Boyd, F.R.G.S.,
should know better.

The natives of the Gilbert Islands have
petitioned the Commissioner to pre ventmissionaries
coming their way. Say they are quite content
—plenty to eat, both vegetables and human
nature. Also, that things socially are ripping
along most satisfactorily—no young men dying,
only the old ones ; who probably make good soup-
stock. There is something pathetic in their
appeal, and it will be a cruel thing if it prove
ineffective. For, without doubt, wherever the
missionary sets his foot, the old order changeth.
And the young men die quite as much as the old,
and laughter and song are heard no more.
As most people know, caoutchouc is obtained
from what is called the india-rubber tree, by
piercing through the sap-ring and collecting the
milky discharge in gourds. The visoid fluid is
then boiled in pans, and the residue, rolled into
handy-sized balls, becomes the raw rubber of
commerce. Last week a Sydney importer, upon
cutting open a portion of a consignment (from
Papua) of such india-rubber balls, foundnoless than
two out of 12, or about 16 per cent., were simply
handfuls of wood-chips with a caoutchouc coating
—valueless rubbish which had been dipped into
the pans and then rolled to resemble the solid
balls of india-rubber for which full market price
had been paid. The missionaryised nigger has
just enough nous to add the white man’s vices to
his own, and treat the combination as a business
asset.

the pen ; but with the brush—and time—there are few

“ effects ” in the line of his likings which he cannot accu-
rately and adequately realise.
The Bookfellow gives this engraving (from a

Mahony’s best - known picture, now hanging in
N.S. W. National Art Gallery. “Itis an episode
of bushranging days, thoroughly felt, strongly

Generally believed that the elastic Law of
Victoria was again stretched to an unlawful
extent, the other day, when the Full Court was
cleared of public and press, to admit of certain
financial matters being discussed in camera.
Johnny Wallace, M.L.C., gave rise to this extra-
ordinary proceeding. Truculent John is under
the Chief Justice’s order to retire from the
management of millionaire Monahan’s estate, and
the chief clerk has named the Equity Trustees
Co., as a fit and proper substitute for John afore-
said. The angry old man objected to the appoint-
ment of the co. named, on the ground that
barrister Higgins, who fought for the winning
side in the original law-suit, is a director of
said co., and will be unconsciously biassed
against him a ridiculous objection, seeing
that Wallace himself has no claim upon the
property they are wrangling about. Failing in
this objection, Wallace appealed to the Full Court
and embellished his appeal with a suggestion,
seemingly, that one of the other Melbourne trus-
tee companies, in which there is no Higgins con-
cerned, would be safer than the E.T.E. and A.
Co. The idea of having the facts and figures of
sundry financial concerns discussed before the Boy
(i.e ., the Public) was appalling to Judge Williams,
a’Beckett, and Hodges, so they decided to keep
the arguments dark. Whereby they have possibly
given an opening for Johnny Wallace to appeal to
the Privy Council against the finding of an irregu-
lar Full Court. At present, Johnny is dismissed
with costs, much to the disgust of a hiccupy ad-
mirer, who assured their Honors that it would be
all right if they put back the old ’un as trustee.
No finer combination of cricketers than the
present Australian XI has ever visited England, says
Ranji. Their bowling displays pace, method, and variety.
Much the same compliment might be paid to the London

bination than London and American styles can be found.
The pace at which we (the L. and A. S.S.) execute orders
is wonderful ; our methods are rich in craftmanship, and
the variety of excellencies, quality, reasonableness of

effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of
experience, can be had in 4 sizes, by post i/4 2/fi

The death at Devonport (Tas.) of ex-Dis-
trict Constable Quinlan recalls that the nona-
genarian always maintained that the wrong man
was hanged for a certain old-time murder. At
Kitty’s Corner, near the Black Tier, in Oatlands
district, a settler named George Sturgeon was
murdered. Richard Innis, alias Long Mickey
who was “wanted’’for a minor offence and long
eluded the police, was eventually captured, made
to fit the crime, and died protesting his innocence
Years afterwards Quinlan, who took a prominent
part in the capture of Long Mickey, stumbled
across a bit of evidence which convinced him of
the innocence of his prisoner and fixed the guilt
on another person. But the evidence, though con-
clusive enough for Quinlan, was, owing to the
peculiar administration of Y.D.L. law in those
days, hardly good enough to establish a sure coh-
viction. Also, proceedings would have involved
a number of innocent persons, so Quinlan held his
hand. In his very old age his tongue worked
loose, and he declared to cronies that he knew
Long Mickey was innocent of murder. “ But ’tis
along time ( since the throuble,” he always said
“and there’s wheels within wheels, so we’ll lave
it at that.” And, so far as writer knows the
secret of the crime is Quinlan’s still.

815 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY
(nearly opposite Railway Station).
Business, Robbery, etc-
Nothing like official correspondence for arriving
at the truth. A Vic. country resident sent to certain
friends a crate of fowls, which had to be transferred at
Swanston-street station to another train after a four-
hours’ wait. On arrival at their destination all were
found to be dead. In reply to official enquiry, the guard
of first train advised that he had watered the fowls on the
journey, and handed them over fresh and well at the
terminus. Guard in charge of waiting-room reported—
“ Fowls here four hours—well watered and fed, and sent
away in good order.” The third guard was quite unable
to account for the fowls arriving dead, except that it was
a terrible hot day. Upon which the Commissioner writes
to consignor, regretting that “he is unable to account for
the fowls arriving dead, as every care and attention was
given them during transit.” He received this reply:—
“Am quite able to understand the circumstances, as the
fowls were killed and bled before being sent away.”

A well-known Sydney business-man used to
keep in his desk a small Bible which a J.P. friend of his
found handy for casual affidavits. One day the J.P.
came along with an intending deponent, and “George”
carelessly handed out, as he thought, the Bible. But
after the volume had been duly mumbled over, and the
others had departed, “ George ” found that the book was
a copy of—Don Juan ! “Nevermind,” he said to him-
self as soon as he had recovered from his consternation—
“it’s a good book in itself, anyhow, and not half as
* blue ’ as the Old Testament.”

“P.A.”: Watch wouldn’t go; took it into a
gorgeous shop with £2OOO worth of jewellery and dia-
monds in the window. “Ah ! very dirty—seven-and-six.”
“ I had it cleaned a month ago for four and-six.”
“ That’s it; too cheap; must have it done properly.” I
tried another Aladdin’s palace. “Yes,” said the man
with the dice-box in his eye, “ there’s a lot of long hairs
in it wound around the safety-valve ; seven-and-six.”
“Then it wants a barber,” I replied; “ what do you ad-
vise—hair-cut or shave?” He looked at me in a pity-
ing, superior way, and I went further on till I came to a
shop with two Waterburys, a card of brass wateb-keys,
and a sheet of fly-paper in the window. I thought,
“ This maq looks poor enough to be honest.” “No ; I
can’t see nothing wrong.” “Not dirty?” “No!” “Not
got long hairs wrapped around the ball-bearings? ” “No ;
it wants a drop of hoil on the linch-pin is all I can see.”
The oil went on, and she started like a 20-head stamp
battery. “How much?” “Sixpence.” “ Have a drink ?”
“No, sir; never tetch it. Good-day, sir. Thank you.”
Now, is honesty the best policy? It may be, but appa-
rently the holder of that policy will have more dead flies
than diamond-rings in his window.

A Melb. undertaker’s way (per printed circular)
of calling upon clients to pay up : —“ street, Mel-
bourne, and all suburbs. January 2, 1899. Dear friend, —
Courtesy prompts us to wish you 1 the Compliments of
the season,’ which we heartily do, and hope that the
incoming year may bring every prosperity to you and
yours, and keep and leave you all well in health', full in
purse, and free from debt. At the same time, we feel-
ingly sympathise and condole with you on the hard times
we have all passed through, and we are convinced that
nothing but the direst misfortune could compel you to
let such an account as that for funeral expenses—per-
formed by us for you (and with which you kindly ex-
pressed your satisfaction) —remain so long unsettled. We
trust that with improving times you will now be able to
instruct us to write off the balance, or at least some por-
tion of it. For a settlement we are willing to assist by
making a liberal allowance. We will be glad to acknow-
ledge your kind recommendations either by cash pay-
ments or by reducing the standing account. If, however,
it may strike you that the account should, by effluxion of
time, have paid itself, see us and obtain a clearance, as
we have no wish to quarrel with you, or to let an old and
a bad debt stand in the way of our doing any business it
may be your misfortune to'require in the future.—Yours
respectfully, Smith and Sons, High-class Economic Under-
takers.”

A certain Sydney business-man rarely sends out
a debt-collector. Should a client be dilatory in dealing
with “account rendered,” the smart trader will let
him slide for a while, and then, after adding from £1 to
£5 (according to original amount), send in account
again with a polite note hoping that no harsh measures
will be necessary. As to how it works, hear the wily one
himself: “ Veil, I always preddy soon gids a rebly ora
call from de party, mit hayment for der first account and
a brotest about der monish I added. Then I take der
dollahs and apologises for mein clerk’s error. Ha ! ha ! ”

Much in evidence lately in Sydney
is the lydy who has just dropped her last 6d. down a
street grating, and asks a passing boy, “ whose eyes are
sharper than hers,” if he can see the coin. When boy
stops other boys stop, and crowd soon gathers, out of
which some benevolent old gent is pretty sure to bestow
upon the bereaved one the equivalent of the never-lost
coin. Saw one dame recently play the game twice
within an hour, and when a policeman eventually moved
her on with the remark that “ the ole gent gave you
sixpence,” she indignantly replied—“ Yes; but that
wasn’t the one I lorst.” A woman always has an answer,
of some kind. Even for a policeman.

The latest dodge-joke (an old trick revived). A
smart young man waits upon an unsuspecting house-
holder and represents himself as travelling for a firm of
tailors. He then solicits an order for a suit of clothes.
The bagman’s eloquence overpowers all objections, and
an order, say, for a pair of trousers is given. Sample of
cloth selected, deposit of ss. paid, and scientific measure-
ment laboriously effected. If the victim is corpulent, the
traveller perhaps complains that his firm will be a loser
in cloth by the transaction. Finally, the tailor’s client
is told that the goods will be ready on such a date at such
an address. He calls per arrangement, to find the pre-
mises long occupied by an undertaker. This “ fake ” has
of late been much worked around Sydney.

The other day in a Vic. criminal case it trans-
pired that accused had pawned articles in an assumed
name. Then the sapient Justice Hodges, who never

is a certain indication of dishonesty.” How little the
average Judge seems to know of the world !

“ Face ” : A swindle, whereby one can get, at a
comparatively small outlay, enough collars, neckties, &c.,
to last him half a century, is worked by individuals versed
in the haberdashery business on big soft-goods firms in
dear old England. Send £1 to one of said firms with a
request that you be put on their sample-list, and in two
or three months you will receive a large box packed with
many variegated neckties, numerous silk and other hand-
kerchiefs, together with a fair supply of socks, collars,
gloves and other useful and necessary articles. Many
backblock storekeepers get their supplies in this way. Of
course the British draper won’t be had twice by the one
individual, but said individual can always get a fresh
supply by changing his “ custom " to another shop.

An attempt is being made to coerce the Austra-

one if he desires railway privileges. Or, if the Railway
Commissioners fall in with the C.T.A.’s views, an ob-
noxious drummer who wishes to preserve his rail
privileges, may be blackballed and deprived of what is
his public right. Cheek !

“S.S.”: There are many ways of making a
living, and I have discovered one of the meanest, fol-
lowed by a bottle-nosed person in the suburbs. His
game is to take up small shops in poor localities, and
start greengrocery or pin, cotton, and tape businesses,
keep them going for a week or two, and then advertise
A business for sale in a populous suburb, suitable for
widow or wife of workman. Stock and goodwill, £25.”
there is always a demand for businesses of this kind, and
the bottle-nosed person, being gifted and plausible, suc-
ceeds in trading off his twopenny-ha’penny biz at an
enormous sacriflth, my tear.” Heard him boast of
having sohl three in one week, out of which he cleared
AMO. Only one of his ventures he has failed to sell within
a month or so, and that developed, to his enormous sur-
prise, into a profitable concern. Fortune favors the
Knave.

“The White Man’s Burden.”
Mr. Rudyard Kipling has recently been telling
the people of America, in a series of magnihcent
verses, what “ The White Mans Burden •
shows the responsibility which has been
on their shoulders by recent conquests, and in
soul-stirring cadences, bids them lake up the
White Man’s Burden.” Whilst these verses are
addressed to the Americans in particular, there is
another “White Man’s Burden of far more
universal character, namely, that particular y
sensitive organ, the liver. This great organ is the
regulator of our bodily health. If impaued, ot ler
organs, such as the kidneys, become affected, ana
ill-health results. And such was the experience
of Mr. J. Waller, of 82 York-street, South Mel-
bourne. His story of suffering for years from
long-standing liver complaint, and subsequent
cure by Bile Beans, was narrated to a repre-
sentative of the Spobtsman as follows
“I am glad,” he began, “to give my testi-
mony as to the very great value of Bile Beans.
After five years’ intense suffering from liver and
kidney disease, Bile Beans have cured and made
a new man of me. It is, in fact, over five years
since I first began to feel bad, could not properly
digest my food at times, and, on other occasions,
would suffer from too much bile, . and endure
agony. Doctors said it was the liver. I tried
various remedies, but without benefit, and
gradually got worse, could scarcely look at food,
lost flesh, and became a miserable wreck of
humanity. Two years ago the complaint was
aggravated by kidney troubles, with touches of
rheumatism. Yeu can scarcely imagine how I
suffered. I became gloomy and morose. The
world seemed black to me, and I did not care
whether I lived or died. Hearing so much about
Bile Beans, and knowing people who had bene-
fited by them, I decided to give them a trial, and
did so. The effect was immediate and pleasantly
surprising. Two boxes made ine feel a very dif-
ferent man. I continued to take them, and am
now, as you see, cured, all the credit being due to
Bile Beans. I can now quite understand how that
medicine works its cures, for it must act on the
liver and bile. I hope others will benefit by my
experience.”
Shot Through the Head.
An elderly gentleman while walking down one
of the principal streets yesterday was alarmed at
experiencing a sharp pain that shot right through
his head. He knew immediately that a headache
was threatening, and, being a man of great good
sense, he also knew that the best possible remedy
was Bile Beans for Biliousness. These Beans,
acting directly on the liver, give almost _ in-
stantaneous relief in all cases of constipation,
headache, indigestion, debility, biliousness, and
similar complaints, which all have their origin in
liver derangement. If the liver gets out of order,
as it often does in a climate such as ours, the whole
digestive system goes wrong, and as the proper
digestion of food is the most essential thing in the
sustaining of life, the consequence of bad digestion
must be most disastrous. Bile Beans will keep
you well during the trying wintry weather
that will soon be upon us. If you get sick, they
will put you right. They are the greatest specific
of the age, and, as such, they have positively
cured many cases where other remedies for which
much is claimed have utterly failed.
The Newsboy’s Question.
It is a well-known fact that among the little
street arabs who vend the daily newspapers
about the streets of all large cities, the possessors
of remarkably keen intellects are frequently found.
A case in point occurred only a few days ago. The
youngster, after having effected the sale of a
paper, requested the purchaser to answer him
which was the quicker, heat or cold ? Bailing to
receive an answer, the boy volunteered the infor-
mation that heat was the quicker, as you can catch
cold. And now as this is the weather when colds
are most easily caught, it would be well to fortify
ourselves against such possibility. Colds are
caused by the congestion of the blood, which is
most prominent in the head and throat. In-
fluenza can be traced to the same cause, and
irregular or insufficient liver action is in most
cases responsible for both. If the proper and
effective working of the liver be restored, the
dangers of contracting colds or influenza will be
reduced to a minimum. Bile Beans for Bilious-
ness have been proved to be the most effective
known remedy for ensuring the safe and thorough
discharge by the liver of its natural functions, and
is, therefore, the surest preventative for colds, and
where they have been contracted, Bile Beans will
speedily remove them. Their price is only a shil-
ling and three halfpence per box, and they can be
obtained from all chemists. If a course of this
remedy be taken, it will minimise the danger of
your experiencing personal proof of the newsboy’s
statement that heat is quicker than cold because
cold can be caught. There is a heap of solid
advice contained in the newsboy’s witticism, and
advice which, if followed by older foks, will bring
in its train far greater benefits than may at first
sight appear.

" They Didn’t Know.”
Many people, when detected in the commission
of some wrongful act, attempt to excuse them-
selves by the plea that “ they didn’t know it was
wrong.” Of course, the law of the land absolutely
refuses to excuse any wrong-doer upon such a
ground, and the moral law should be as equally
just in refusing pardon to all such as do wrong to
themselves by neglecting the care of their health,
particularly when they advance the untenable ex-
cuse that they were unaware of anything which
would remove the causes of their trouble. Ninety
per cent, of the ills which afflict the people of
Australia of to-day are directly the result of im-
paired digestive organs. The liver, stomach, and
kidneys are the three great regulators of human
health, and when those organs become affected
the effects thereof are quickly felt in the system.
Now, it is plain that if the sure and effective
working of those organs be secured, the causes of
the ill-effects, which, when impaired, they are
the known producers of, will be removed. For
promoting the thorough working of those organs
Bile Beans have been proved to be the most effec-
tive known preparation, as well as being the most
potent remedy for all ailments resulting from any
derangement of the digestive organism. They
are obtainable from all chemists and storekeepers,
and the price is only one shilling and three half-
pence per box. Thousands of sufferers have been
benefited by their use, and patients have been re-
stored to health when hope of recovery had been
abandoned by their medical attendants and
friends. From far and wide testimonials are
being daily received from grateful persons who
have been cured by their use. If you are suffer-
ing through any ailment resulting from deranged
digestive organs, you have a simple but most
effective remedy at hand. This remedy is Bile
Beans for Biliousness, and you should not do
wrong to yourself by neglecting to avail yourself
of their curative powers. If you do there is abso-
lutely no excuse for you, and you cannot shield
yourself behind the “I didn’t know” hedge of
defence which seems to be so eagerly sought by
persons now-a-days in their efforts to excuse or
hide the results of their folly and negligence.

Midnight Executions.
In Australian gaols the sentence of death which
has been passed upon a condemned criminal is
customarily carried into effect during the early
morning. But it may not be generally known
that midnight executions are taking place in
thousands of Australian homes every night of our
lives, with impaired digestive organs acting as the
executioner. It is at night, when sleep should be
reinvigorating our bodies, that a deranged
digestive organism gets in its evil work, and lays
the foundation for the ruin of health, home and
happiness. Now, something is required to check
these wholesale midnight executions, and Bile
Beans for Biliousness will be found to be the
required article. They exercise their beneficial
effects and curative powers upon a sufferer whilst
he is at rest, and thereby counteract the insidious
attacks of a deranged liver, stomach or kidneys.
Their action is gentle, there is no griping or
purging, and no evil effects. Their formula is
purely vegetable, and such drastic ingredients as
aloes, calomel or mercury, as found in most purga-
tives, are emphatically and positively not em-
ployed, even in the smallest degree. For the year
ending February 28, thirty million doses of Bile
Beans were consumed in Australia alone. They
are sold by chemists and storekeepers generally,
price one shilling and three halfpence per box.
They have, in thousands of cases, proved their
efficacy in restoring sufferers to health, and they
are universally acknowledged to be the most
potent power known to-day in Australia in pre-
venting those midnight executions which are
almost nightly occurring.
♦
“I Took Them.”
The laws relating to the unlawful taking of
other people's property are somewhat stringent in
the colonies, but their administration is occasion-
ally the cause of much comment. It has fre-
quently been noticed that the unfortunate, who,
when perhaps pressed by want and hunger, appro-
priates to his own use a small sum, is sentenced to
a long term of imprisonment; whereas the well-
connected wrong-doer, when charged with the
larceny of perhaps thousands of pounds, has fre-
quently, in reply to his “ I took them,” received a
sentence far from commensurate with his crime.
The ill-gotten property of such actions never re-
sults in benefit, but there is a preparation now
being sold throughout the Australian colonies—
Bile Beans for Biliousness —which, when used,
causes people to joyfully say “I took them.” These
Beans are a purely vegetable preparation, and the
result of years of thoughtful research on the part
of an American medical man. The use of
any, even the slightest deleterious substance, is
most carefully avoided. They have been com-
pounded with the especial object of assisting the
liver, stomach and kidneys to thoroughly and
effectually perform their natural functions. If
any of the foregoing organs of the digestive
system are impaired, ill health is the result ;
and, in fact, nine-tenths of all the ills which
affect mankind to-day are directly traceable to
deranged digestive organs. As Bile Beans will
restore those organs to their proper working
order, they will prove efficacious in removing the
causes of a great majority of the ailments from
which men and women unfortunately suffer to-
day. They have done this in thousands of cases,
and innumerable men and women to-day find
themselves in a position of great benefit through
being able to say “ I have taken them.”
Progress in Science.
Scientists tell us that in this nineteenth century
of ours about the greatest strides made in the dis-
covery world have been in medicine. We have to
record a discovery by an American medical man
of a certain vegetable substance that has the effect
on the digestive organs of Nature’s own animal
bile. The discovery is revolutionising all the pre-
sent methods of treatment for digestive ailments.
The old theory of pepsin, bismuth, starving,
purging, &c., &c., is to be done away with. This
great vegetable substance is compounded with
other ingredients to facilitate the working, and
to-day this remedy can be purchased the world
over and in Australia under the name of Bile
Beans for Biliousness. This great remedy
possesses the peculiar properties of acting on the
bowels without purging or otherwise weakening
the patient. This is because the substance that
relaxes the bowels has about the same action as
the natural bile. Bile Beans are purely vegetable,
and a course of them will probably successfully
oust the most chronic cases of Piles, Indigestion,
Headache, Biliousness, Female Ailments, De-
bility, Constipation, and a host of other ailments
that owe their origin to defective bile flow, assimi-
lation, and poor digestion. These Beans are
placed on the market in a form that anyone can
take them without medical supervision ; and as
the price is very low, there are few homes that
cannot afford to always have a box on the shelf for
emergency. Australian depot, 39 Pitt-street,

General Failing Health.
REMARKABLE CURE AT EPSWIOH,
QUEENSLAND.
BILE BEANS ACHIEVE A WONDER
FUL VICTORY.
Usually when a person is attacked by General
Failing Health his or her life is regarded as fast
drawing to a close. The fears in such an event
are based upon a stronger foundation when the
sufferer is one of advanced yeais. In like manner
the restoration to health of such a person so
afflicted, should attract much more than passing
wonderment. And such a cure would indicate
that the means by which it had been effected,
must have been some extremely efficacious and
life-sustaining remedy. The wonderment at the
cure would be naturally heightened also when it is
known that it had been effected by a proprietary
medicine after hope had been abandoned and doc-
tors and many other medicines tried in vain.
Usually patent medicines are received with mis-
givings, but the following details of the remark-
able case and cure of a Queensland lady will
silence any misgivings, even supposing such to be
entertained, in regard to the marvellous curative
properties possessed by Bile Beans eok Bilious-
ness.
The lady’s name is Mrs. T. Wooley, of East-
street, Ipswich, Queensland. She is 53 years old,
and has resided in Ipswich for twenty-six years,
being well known in the district. Mrs. Wooley
says she has not the slightest objection to the pub-
lication of the facts connected with her case and
cure. “I consider,” she said, “it is for the sake
of humanity, and also that I may be able to show
my gratitude to the makers of Bile Beans. The
facts of my case are as follows : —I commenced to
suffer severely from headaches and continual
pains in the chest about eight years ago. The
pains, which were of a most acute nature, usually
attacked me after meals. I did not at that time
know from what kind of illness my pains arose,
but I have since thought that they came from in-
digestion. As I have already said, the pains first
assailed me about eight years ago, and never left
me until a short time back. During this time I
consulted many doctors in turn, and it is a sin-
gular thing but they each and all said that the
pains in my head were the result of worry, and
advised me to take a change of air. I took this
change, and after having given it a sufficient time
within which to work some improvement in me and
it failing to do so, I became convinced that some-
thing else was needed. It was then that I, in
turn, tried all the patent medicines so largely
advertised. Notwithstanding that I persevered
in taking those medicines for a time, extending
over some years, I found myself in the end
worse instead of better. I was now thoroughly
disgusted, and thought that the remainder of my
days would be spent in suffering. My headaches
and pains had by this time so increased that they
were almost intolerable. My appetite left me,
and my sleep became very poor ; and, as a conse-
quence, my system was wholly run down. I have
now reached the turning point in my story. A
Bile Beans pamphlet having been left at my
house, I read in it a testimonial from a person
giving particulars of the cure by the use
of Bile Beans of a complaint which I
thought was similar to my own. Although
I was tired of taking medicines, and had but little
faith in the Beans, I thought I would give them a
trial. You may imagine my surprise when, al-
though I had no confidence in the Beans, I began
to feel better after a few doses. My pains and
headaches began to be less severe, and my health
continued to improve. This improvement gradu-
ally went on until now my former good health
has wholly returned, and I feel as I felt before my
illness first attacked me. I have now been taking
the Beans for three months, and during that time
I have not had even a slight return of my former
complaints. My neighbors are surprised at the
change which has taken place in me, and say that
they never saw me looking so well; and, as I feel
as well as I look, I cannot say too much in praise
of Bile Beans. It will certainly be a hard day for
me when I have not a box of them in my house.”

LIVER MEDICINE UNTIL YOU HAVE
FIRST TRIED WARNER’S SAFE CURE.
Mr. George M. Hashing, Teacher, Haddon
Bush, Southland, N.Z., l/3/’9B, sends the follow-
ing report: —“ I am pleased to testify to the great
benefit I have derived from the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure, when a few years ago I was suffering
from kidney disorder. From Mr. 0. H. Mac-
alister, chemist, Invercargill, I obtained my last
ease of Warner’s Safe Cure, and it completely
restored me and put me into grand form.”
This is just what thousands have previously ex-
perienced, and no medicine before the public to-
day can show such an array of indisputable proofs
of its power to cure kidney and liver disease.*

Attention is directed to the advertisement
of Webber’s “Vitadatio,” as a remedy for many
of the “ ills that flesh is heir to.” It has already
achieved wonderful success. Mr. S. A. Palmer,
the general agent for Australia, is himself a living
example of its efficacy. He went to Tasmania to
recoup his health .when given up as incurable by
the doctors, and found salvation and good health
in the “Vitadatio ” he is now loyally introducing
to his suffering brethren. The medicine is said to
be absolutely pure and free from poisonous drugs.
People who have been cured all declare its efficacy,
and many of them are well-known. It is claimed
to be a specific for indigestion and debility.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
A Parliamentary Marine Board—N.S.W.
Legislative Council.
A lie has nine legs ; and when it wants
to put its best foot foremost it uses the “ leg ” of
Sydney Day-lie Te-leg-raph.
Sydney D.T. heading :—“ Denouncing the
Bill. Mr. John Nobbs, M.P., Speaks.” Which
unfortunate caption made all who know Mr. John
Nobbs, M.P., think of Balaam’s Ass.
Gr. Republican Dibbs derides Reid’s 12
nominees to N.S.W. Leg. Council as “ a seedy
lot.” But not so seedy as the crowd who lately
supported Dibbs at Sydney Town Hall.
Sydney Sunday Times has now sheered off
the capital clause, and is using as a scarecrow the
Braddon Blot and the prospect of a Protectionist
tariff. Yet the Times has hitherto posed as a
Protectionist organ.
FOR N.S.W. LEG. COUNCIL.
They either fear their fate too much,
Or their deserts are small,
Who dare not put it to the touch
To win or lose it all.
Sydney D.T.’s' latest dilemma is to please
the Labor members in the Lower House by de-
riding the new M’sL.C., and, at the same time, to
keep in with the working classes by approving of
the recognition of the Labor-party's right to be
represented in the Upper House.
Affleck, M.P. for Yass, and Wilks, M.L.A.
for Balmain, are recent converts to the Federal
Bill. Sydney D.T., which so often has printed
the glowing periods of these mighty legislators,
made not the slightest reference to the Assembly
speeches wherein they announced their apostasy.
Premier Reid deserves credit for holding a
stiff back to those urging him to imitate Seddon in
offering a contingent for service in Samoa. N.S.
Wales General French’s hint of “ a thousand men
who would be very pleased to go ” fell as flat as a
hundred other invitations to play butcher without
precisely knowing who owns the calf.
In the ’76 ructions in Samoa, then also
accompanied with considerable loss of life, it was
the British and Americans, not the Germans, who
were at loggerheads. On that occasion Capt.
Stevens, of H.M.S. Barracouta, arrested the
masterful Col. Steinberger, and nearly precipitated
hostilities between John and Jonathan.
‘‘Willie” Stephens, M.L.A. for S. Bris-
bane—all the Willie-boys have a weak spot some-
where—now joins theanti-Federationists, although
he declared for Federation before the elections.
It was this quaint politician who, two years ago,
openly accused the Boodlewraith (his own) party
of bribery and corruption ; but he still sit I and
votes with it.
BACKYARD SARCASM.
SHE (coldly): “Thank you, I don't want any
vegetables to-day."
HE (nastily) : “ Neow! I suppose that Chow's bin
flatterin' yer lovely fyce fer yer. Even if yer
gyve me a bob fer every pertato, I'm afride I
couldn’t do that.”
N.S.W. Mines Minister Joe Cook is as
doleful an example of YeS-No as. his boss, Reid.
For instance, as Minister for Agriculture he is
preparing a Bill to encourage viticulture—wine-
making and, necessarily, wine-consumption—and,
»s member of the Ministry, he has drafted and
holds ready for presentation a Bill for stringent
local option—in the Cook sense, for drink suppres-
sion.
Premier Kingston and Labor-leader Bat-
chelor are being hard pushed at West Adelaide by
editor Denny, of the Southern Cross (a youth of
25), who has the Capitation-grant as his great
shield and buckler, with 2000 Irishmen as an army
behind him and the priests as his standard-
bearers —and seeks to dish the other side by pick-
ing up the whole Ministerial polioy plus the sub-
sidy to churoh schools.
S.A. Laboritesare “ working” for all it is
worth the characteristic speech of the National
Ass magnate, S. Tomkinson, M.L.C., at the re-
cent Moonta and Wallaroo Co. meeting. Moonta
miners are notoriously ill-paid ; yet Mr. Tomkin-
son, talking of “ill-advised” promises of ad-
vanced wages hitherto made, declared: “The
claims of the shareholders come first, and the
increase of wages is undue and unnecessary.”
A pity that Crick’s offer to resign his com-
fortable West Macquarie seat and help to carry
Federation through N.S.W. Leg. Council was not
accepted by Premier Reid. Crick is the sort of
man who could do a heap of good in the Council
by waking up J. Lucas, and speaking candidly
to Benjamin Backhouse, and the Honorable
Blanksby, and acting the genial bull-ant gener- .
ally in that somnolent Elysium. The Council has
not possessed a man like Crick since the advent
of “ Responsible ” Govt., and that vitriolic genius
has himself been so slumbrous and dispassionate
of late that his migration to “ another place ”
might help the gods to laugh again.
All over Maoriland now flaps the gaudy
election banner of the Tory party with the device
Let us reduce Taxation.” It is about
time someone kicked a hole in that ban-
ner large enough to throw a goat
through. Maoriland is a cheaply-
governed country—in proportion to
population it is run at less expense
than N.S.W., Queensland, S.A. or
Westralia, and it would also be run
more cheaply than Victoria but for
the fact that the old Tory Party
left it a far heavier debt and a
far bigger interest bill than Vic-
toria possesses. There is little
room for retrenchment in Maori-
land. Therefore reducing taxa-
tion only means more borrow-
ing, which means more taxa-
tion in the future; or more
land sales, which means less
land revenue, and consequently
more taxation in the future.
Premier Braddon, of Tas-
mania, has dreams about a land-
tax based on unimproved land
values only, and the necessary
assessments are in preparation.
Tasmania’s present land-tax is Jd.
in the and if a strong Premier
would double or treble this im-
post, and use the proceeds to open
up the West Coast with roads and
railways in place of leaving the
work to gridiron syndicates, he
might live to see Tasmania well on
the road to a population of a million.
It is a solemn thing to reflect upon
that almost the only decently-watered
part of tliis horribly dry land is prac-
tically inaccessible because a tired Go-
vernment won’t make the necessary
roads.
According to his annual report,
“ Boss ” Creer, of Sydney Govt. Labor
Bureau, continually finds himself confronted
by the problem of what to do with that portion
of the unemployed that is too old or otherwise
incapable of facing competition. Private em-
ployers will not engage the aged, and Govt, has
to either find them relief-work at which they
can do their little best to earn enough to buy
food with, or take the responsibility of let-
ting them starve. And as Govt, hasn’t got
the courage, or the brutality, to say it will
let them starve outright, why not have an
old-age-pension system and do the. thing
decently ?
Gut of three Q. sugar-towns—Bun-
daberg, Mackay, and Cairns—two now re-
turn anti-kanaka legislators. A nasty knock
for the Govt, press, that is continually crying out
that the kanaka is the mainstay of the sugar-
industry. Evidently the people in the districts
concerned don’t think so.
The N.S.W. Anti-Billious leader, is still
unannounced, and the pathetic appeals to Jack
Want to come out and lead the party betray the
fact that he has no likely supplanter. The anti-
Federal following, too, gains few recruits. The
Cabbage-Tree Mob was reduced to placarding
Stephen—who ran Dacey to a head for Botany
seat—as a politician dead against the Bill, and
even he has “turned dog” and supports the
measure.
Kerr, Labor M.L.A. for Barcoo, Q., owes
his seat to the loyalty of his bush mates. 110 of
them were unjustly disfranchised. And Kerr’s
opponent took care to have the backblocks polling-
booths as far apart as possible ; but the disfran-
chised men provided relays of their own horses
every 10 or 20 miles, and Kerr’s supporters tra-
velled 90 or more miles on polling day. No
wonder the Boodlewraith is astounded at the
Labor organisation.
A big weapon in the hands of the N.§.W.
Conservative-party is that members of the Leg.
Council are unpaid. Pay the Council, and it will
be far more amenable to public opinion. Also,
pay the Council, and you will be able to appoint
thereto good and democratically-representative
men from all over the province.' Just consider
the disadvantages under which a miners’ repre-
sentative like Buzacott must labor in coming,
unpaid, all the way from Broken-hill to Sydney.
From circular issued by South Warrego
(Q.) Political Association, run in the Ministerial
interest :
, The result of the last annual revision-court was par-
ticularly gratifying to our cause. Out of 78 objections
lodged to names on the roll 76 were allowed.
And yet Premier Dickson, who was prevented
speaking at Cunnamulla, where the revision-court
was held, by some of the 76 disfranchised electors,
threatened to bring in legislation to stop such tac-
tics at public meetings !
The latest bogey manufactured by the
N.S.W. “Colonists’ Anti-Bill League” makes it
appear that Riverina pastoralists (who, because of
differential rates, have their wool now railed for
about 40s. a ton) will have to pay between £4 and
£5 a ton under the “ virtual monopoly ” of the
Commonwealth. That bogey is too murderous in
intent. It would not alone scare to death the
present, but all Federal Bills for all time. But
the pure bogeyness of its character is shown by
the fact that pastoralists, among them Riverina
pastoralists, are excellent friends of the Bill in
hand Sam M'Caughey, M.L.C., king of the
squatter-ring enters N.S.W. Upper House in
the interests of Federation, and to help keep the
Sydney colonists’ gang from garotting it from
behind. And surely Sam M'Caughey, the man
who started with nothing and has made three or
wet mill,ons ’ knows enough to come in out of the
Premier Kingston is delighted at having
unearthed in S.A. Register of 1855-7, the period
in which the S.A. Constitution was being
fashioned, a series of most radical leading-articles
advocating manhood suffrage for both Houses of
the Legislature, and urging, that the only differ-
ence as to their election should be that the Council,
r by the whole province as one constituency,
should represent general interests, and the
Assembly, elected by districts, should voice local
needs. It is too excruciatingly funny,” Kings-
ton writes, “ the way in which the Register in its
manhood, of nearly 50 years ago disposes of the
pet theories of its present dotage. ”
Selt-preservation is the first principle of
politicians. Scores and scores of “ward” and
lodge statesmen regard Federation as an engine
specially contrived for thei r extermination. Who
can oonceive a Federal Par-
liament handicapped by
the presence of theanti-
Federal hangers -on
of the provincial
Assemblies ?
AT A SILVER- COIN SHOW,
FIRST ACTOR: “Business is ‘dead slow.’ I’m
almost starving.”
SECOND ACTOR: “ Nonsense ! Didn’t you have a
meat-pie one day last week?"
Parkes, when Premier in 1888, moved—
That in future the Govt, of N.S.W. should be
informed of any intended appointment to the
high office of Governor before such appointment
is finally made.” G. R. Dibbs, then leader of the
Opposition, seconded the motion. G. H. Reid
spoke and voted against it, but Parliament passed
There still stands to the credit of N.S.W.
new Houses 1 of Parliament i!100,000, authority to
expend which was duly given under a Loan Act.
Luckily, this sum is still intact. There also exists
a Board Reid, Lackey, Abbott, Lyne, Want and
others —to examine and advise on designs. But
the Board forgets it is in being. The <£loo,ooo
was only a first instalment. The best thing Par-
liament can do is to repeal the Act, returning the
cash and wiping out the Board.
Premier Reid’s agreement to help Henry
Copeland to obtain leave to introduce a Bill to
regulate Sunday trading—principally to open the
pubs.—and prevent N.S.W. Civil Service Co-
Operative Society from retailing whisky at its bar
—is really a timely sop to the King Division
whisky-millers. These gentry are pawing the
ground ominously, so Reid rushes in “to help
Copeland to obtain leave to introduce,” etc. Put
if the Bill be actually introduced, where will Reid
be at the critical division? Where was he last
time?
A TELL-TALE POSTER.
The Alien Restriction Act came into force
in Tasmania April 1. Under this measure every
alien may be required to write 50 words in some
European language before being allowed to land.
S.A. Govt, is still being bombarded by a
syndicate for permission to construct a railway
from Pt. Augusta to W.A. border. The
syndicate says it is willing to spend
£2, 000,000 and asks for no land-grants,
and offers to give Govt, right of pur-
chase at any time, and only wants a
State-guarantee of interest on the
£2, 000,000 to the extent of 2| per
cent. As the country between Pt.
Augusta and the W.A. border is
some of the worst in Australia, this
looks about the most philanthropic
scheme of the century. But such
schemes are generally ioaded some-
where or other.
Curious that Maoriland, of
all places, should be agitated by
such a violent discussion about its
falling birth-rate. . It has a higher
birth-rate than Victoria, or S.A.,
and a lower death-rate than any of
the other six Australias. In ’9B,
for every 1000 inhabitants there were
nearly 10 deaths and nearly 26 births—
a gain of 16, so it had the largest in-
crease by excess of births over deaths in
Australasia. In fact, the only province
which came within gunshot of it was
_ Queensland. Maoriland doesn’t know when
it’s well off.
“Victorian”: The seats of some
Vic. M’s.P. are kept secure in an in-
teresting way. Nearly every cocky
and cocky’s man has a sonin
the railways or civil-service.
and the influence of the
absentee is maintained in
the district by the rates
being paid in his name,
the “ old man ” taking
out an electors- right.
Then, when an election
happens along, the “ rate-
payer” is franked back to
vote. Manhood suffrage and
the recording of votes at
the handiest polling-places
would send a few out-of-date
fossils into long-merited ob-
scurity.
Curious to consider all the
small -ways in which Freetrade
N.S.W. protects its local industries.
In the matter of wheat, for instance,
the railway rate for N.S.W. wheat
coming from the west towards the seaboard
towns is 11s. 4d. per ton on a 200-mile
journey. Imported wheat going inland from the
coast pays nearly double these rates. Victoria
and S.A. charge the same rate both ways, but
they dump a heavy duty on the imported grain.
They are openly and honestly Protectionist on
a large scale. N.S.W. is secretly and dishonestly
Protectionist on a small one.

Dear Sir,—For about 12 months I had been troubled
with enlargement of the liver and indigestion. The
usual treatment produced no good effect, and hearing
of Vitadatio I determined to try it. After taking five

tonic, and enables one to relish his food at all times, is
easy and pleasant to take, and does not necessitate ah-
senee from business. For people engaged in sedentary
employment nothing could be better. Wishing you
every success,—l remain, Yours truly,

The fire and burglar epidemic has come round
again, and is raging briskly in Sydney. During the last
few weeks there have been several fires in which there
has been considerable destruction of valuables, and the
enterprising burglar has had some good jewellery hauls.
In each case this was due to inadequate precaution. If
the advantages of the Sydney Safe Deposit had been
availed of the loss would have been little or none, while
the cost of this insurance would have been infinitesimal.
We are desired to invite Bulletin readers to visit the
vaults in Ash-street, off George-street, back of Paling’s.*
The cure of piles by the new “Canalin”
treatment is fully described in the pamphlet,
Piles, and How to Cure Them,” by Albert
bharp. Copies, with testimonials, sent free to
any colony from the dep6t, 257 George-street,

The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society’s
funds now exceed two millions and a quarter, of which a
considerable proportion is invested in Government stock
and other liquid securities. The Bankers’ Magazine
(London) writes: “The Colonial Mutual has not only a
position of great strength to recommend it, but it is re-
markably progressive in its methods, and is oontinually
striving to render its policies more and more attractive.”
The Federal character of the Colonial Mutual’s organisa-
tion renders it an institution of special interest at the
present moment.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Significant of the stage the new: boxing-boom
has reached in Sydney that 1200 people distributed them-
selves between Alhambra A.O. and Golden Gate A. 0., last
Saturday night, to witness novice-competitions—each for
30sovs. cut up. At Alhambra the fighting was lively and
severe, especially bouts between Poet and Harden, and
Head and Jim Hope. Poet gives promise of developing
into a good ’un. He has a daisy left, and never loses his
head. Read, pupil of Tom Nelson, who figured promi-
nently in the days of the old “ White Horse” gymnasium,
made his initial public appearance “ for keeps.” Report
credited Read with being a top-notcher, and much was
consequently expected of him. He belongs to the legs-
and-wings variety’, and keeps up a continual toe-jig
throughout every round. Gallery-sports whistled horn-
pipes for the man on wires, and the man on wires got
angry thereat. Hope, inches shorter every way and
pounds lighter, but game as a pebble, led the long ’un a
merry dance so merry that the judges couldn’t separate
the pair at the close of the fifth round, and another had
to he fought, with the result that Read won, but by very
little. Hope is among the grittiest in the ring to-day.
bix red-hot battles were witnessed at Golden Gate A.C.,
and how some of the pairs did bash each other 1 They
kept the excitement at fever-point from end to end, and
left the rings “busted.”
* * • •
At Alhambra A.C. (Sydney) on Saturday night
things were mixed. Judges slow in giving decisions,
referee slower still. Crowd jeered, boxers made im-
promptu speeches to the gallery’, seconds argued with
officials and brandished bony fists in their fat faces.
Read’s second rushed into the ring—-a palpable breach of
the rules which should have given the fight to Hope, but
no notice was taken of it. Confusion reigned supreme
for minutes.

“Old Timer”: Saw Conlon-Burden affair
(won t call it fight) at Golden Gate A.C. on Sat. night
week, and am satisfied Burden won on points ; also satis-
fied that Conlon has a weak streak. Burden got close
in once punched the big fellow in the ribs twice, and
Conlon wasn’t “ taking any ” afterwards. Conlon. is
matched to fight Dan Q Connell, the Captain’s Flat
(N.S.W.) miner, next month, and former will know he
has been up against it—good and hard —when that battle
is over. Daniel’s a fighter through and through.
Provided nothing interferes meanwhile, ’rastler
Harry’ Cansdell (Sydney’s own man of thew) and German
Lorenz will gets in “ holts,” Friday, 21st inst., at Alham-
bra A.C. (Sydney), to contest for the local middleweight
championship. Conditions—Graeco-Roman, first two falls
out of three. Graeco-Roman style wearies one as a rule,
Dpt this bout will be lively, as the agreement provides
that neither athlete is to go down unless fairly thrown.
Ground-wrestling limited to smin„ and if no fall, both
shall be ordered to assume the perpendicular.

Though still in the thirties, Mick Dooley,
Sydney s one-time brilliant heavyweight, is now a decided
back-number. He who formed the stepping-stone to
championship honors for Peter Jackson, Paddy Slavin,
and Joe Goddard was, let us hope, seen for the iast time
m a willin go when he met and was beaten by Doherty
at Kalgoorlie (W. A.), Easter Monday night. Poor Mick
presented a very feeble front, and 'received his quietus
fair on the point in the fourth round after a poor
showing, during which not for one moment did he
exhibit any of his old dash or cleverness. Doherty
and Dooley have now met three times within about
as many months, and have apparently been playing the
game in the West for all it was worth. At Fremantle,
/u° c " on in half-a-dozen rounds; at Kalgoorlie,
(the first time) Doherty got home within the same period,
and then know-alls looked wise and said, “ It’s Dooley’s
turn next! But it wasn’t, for Dooley’ went down before
a steam-hammer punch that would have felled an ox.

A great take-down at Melb. St. Vincent’s Fair
was one Boota Singh, a lanky Hindoo, with an arin like a
chicken s leg and no chest worth mentioning. - Boota—
Iniu aS Champion Wrestler of India—came out at 9st;
101 b. to battle with Cashin—formerly’ a middleweight
0rf j C^Ti a *' ■h^ s h- The Australian was a mass of muscle,
and it looked the Federal capital to a cake of soap that
the turn-up wouldn't last lOsec. But it took Cashin 20
solid minutes to get the dusky one on his back, and that
only after a couple of very close shaves for himself. The
mg., who is a handkerchief-vendor in private life, seem-
ingly knew all about the game, even if instructions hadn’t
been yelled at him by half-a-hundred Ram-Jam Sammees
who had turned up to do a barrack. What an object-
lesson those barrackers would have been for the superiah

Big negro Armstrong, protege of Peter Jack-
son’s erstwhile hustling manager, “Parson” Davies, and
much-heralded prospective world-beater, met, last month
at Cincinnati (U.S. A.), another “ cullud pusson,” Frank
Childs, a deal shorter but verv stockily built, for the
colored heavy-weight championship of the earth, and
latter won after six savage rounds. Childs made such a
splendid showing that arrangements were subsequently
entered into for him and sailor Sharkev to a-et together
Australian Peter Jackson’s first fight in Yankeeland was
for the colored championship of the world, when he licked
that wonder of his time, “ Chocolate ” Godfrey, with left-
hand jabs over the heart which Godfrey treated disdain-
fully until, as he afterwards explained, their frequency
seemed to weaken the spot, and they became strange
thumps as if a ton weight were behind them. “ I was
fairly parlysed or mesmerised,” said “ Old Chocolate.”
Peter paralysed or mesmerised many others in the same
manner afterwards, until the “ heart blow ” became more
famous than Australian George Dawson’s “ kidney
punch.” J

The victory of one Australian in America now-
a-days is a .novelty, but what must be said of two men
from this section coming out on top in one ring on one
night? Tom Tracey and “ Cocker ” Tweedie met Muller
and Reilly, respectively, at ’Frisco, Feb. 28. Tracey won
in 10 of what was to have been a 20-rounds fight, while
Tweedie got away on points after boxing 15 rounds
There was nothing to rave about in’ either win. As a set-
off, news comes by same mail that in one night (March 7)
but at widely-separate places, two Australians went
under—Joe Goddard was easily beaten by Gus Ruhlin in
New York, and Billy Murphy got his quietus from Van
Heest at Dayton (O.).

Melbourne “ Sewerage Champion ” Billy Ed-

middleweight, who went to the United States with Peter
Jackson in the ’Bo’s, had a hot go in New York, Feb. 23
Paddy made things sultry awhile, but directly the man
with the scented title got fairly to work he knocked
chips off his fellow-Australian until the seventh round,
when the already-satiated crowd cried “ take him away !”
And poor Paddy was carried off, a sorry spectacle.

Pathetic item from the land o’ kilts and burgoo.
One-time-all-round-champion-athlete Donald Dinnie, hero
of victories totalling thousands, has had his tools of trade
(dumb-bells, &c.) “ arrested ” for debt at Aberdeen—the
magnificent Scot’s native town. Seems but a few months
since brawny Donald left Australia, after 10 years’ resi-
dence, full of hope and confidently looking forward to an
open-armed reception and replenished purse in the coun-
try which his deeds of strength and skill had advertised
the world over. Auld Donald is 63.

Two consultations on Canterbury Park Plate

sweep-money’s right) rich prize.

Brighton (Sydney) 2 miles handicap trot was
concluded on Thursday last, when Acquittal made an easy
win from Shakespeare in 5.28 J. What might have been
an exciting contest with reasonable handicapping, was
completely spoilt by the ridiculous marks on which some
of the better-performed horses were placed. Take Cool-
gardie, placed 40seos. behind. To beat Acquittal, the
horse_ would have had to trot at a 2.24>4gait; and even
allowing the handicap had been framed on a 2.50 basis
she would want to show a 2.30 gait to win—an impossible
task for her. Brighton is certainly the only club which
gives trotting a show in the Metropolis, but the good it
does the sport is discounted by the incapable handicap-
ping.

The Doncaster winner, Vigorous, must have
genuinely earned his reputation for inconsistency, other-
wise a cute owner like Sam Fielder wouldn’t part with
him for £3OO, at which price he has been sold for India.
A horse that can, at weight-for-age, run Merloolas (in his
present fettle) to a head, as Vigorous did at Randwick, is
worth several times that amount—provided be
depended upon to always run up to form—and Vigorous
apparently can’t. Vigorous has a big contract before
him to beat the Indian record of another of Sam’s exports
—Vanitas.

The Grandmaster filly, Grand Belle, one of the
late “ Dick ” Craven’s, has been put to pony-racing, and
opened her acoount by easily winning Kensington Handi-
cap, last Thursday. She is a peculiarly-built mare—
viewed from the rear she looks a “ 16 hands,” but is a
fair pony in front, and a nice galloper. She was bought
for only £2l.

Ed. B.— Re par. as to Fairy Prince run-

the horse did a wonderful “ go ” at Moorefield during the
week when the local crowd were away at Brighton—so
good that it was no wonder he equalled Survivor’s record
in the race. Those in the know backed him to a man,
and it does seem extraordinary that his trainer should
not have had a decent win considering the long odds on
tap.—W.

Pity, for the prestige of the Australian race-
horse, that Aurum has broken down. When Newhaven
went to England it was thought the Britishers would at
last see the best of Australian form, but he was a disap-
pointment, and now Aurum has collapsed without show-
ing his quality.

Ever since young Flanagan’s death at Caulfield
last year, the authorities under the Children’s Protection
Act (N.S.W.) have been waiting for a case to see whether
their regulations could be used as a check upon the prac-
tice of trainers engaging youngsters too small to cope
with the tasks imposed upon them. Last week the De-
partment’s inspector laid an information against E. E.
Keys, owner of Sir Charles, and Callinan, sen., for allow-
ing young Peter Callinan to ride at Randwick. It appears
that the boy, who is only 12 years old, fell off his mount
during the preliminary canter and broke his arm, the
cause being the large amount of dead weight he had to
carry. Sir Charles is a big horse, and the jockey simply
toppled off, top-heavy. The defence admitted the youth-
fulness of little Peter, and also the danger, but denies
that a horse-race is a “ public performance ” within the
meaning of the Act. The magistrate would not decree
the point, and a case is to be stated for the Full Court.

The Great Eastern Steeplechase, run lately at
Onkaparinga (S. A.), seems to have been almost a record
race for Australia. Fifteen faced the starter, and the
whole lot, barring Eclipse, fenced like machines. Domino
humped the crusher of I2st. 131bs. to victory, thus beat-
ing Flashlight’s (12s. lOlbs.) and Mahdi’s (12st. 121b5.)
wonderful performances. S.A., woefully behind N.S.W.
and Vic. in flat-racing, yet not only manages to keep
’chasing up to the mark by attracting good ’uns from
other provinces, but turns out excellent “leppers” of
her own.

Old-time ’rastler Teffen shuffled off at Riverton
(M.L.) recently, having “strutted and fretted” 62
years. For over half-a-score of that term he was 9.7
champion of England, and could give more weight away
than any other man in his time.

The inevitable forging in connection with Melb.
“ art-union” tickets has happened at last. Two tickets
bearing the numbers of the second and third prizes in the
Druids’ lottery were sold at a heavy reduction on their
face value (in jewellery) to a couple of confiding hotel-
keepers, and when presented for payment were found to
have been “ faked.” The pasteboards were genuine, but
their numbers had been ingeniously altered. When one
considers the cheap get-up of these shilling cards the
wonder is that the swindle didn’t suggest itself to the
spieling intellect years ago.
The management of the Druids Gala, whilst
claiming due credit for the discovery of the fake by com-
paring these wrong tickets with the official counterfoils of
the right tickets, incidentally mentioned that the second
prize had not been claimed. This raises the question
whether it was actually sold. Druid Art Union tickets
could be bought in Melb., anyway, on the day of the
drawing. At what hour was the sale stopped, and what
means are taken to ensure the omission of unsold numbers
from the drawing ? How many tickets were put into cir-
culation? How many of these were thrown back on the
committee’s hands? Are all of the 125 prizes (mostly
paltry) available for capture by public purchasers of
tickets when the drawing comes off ? The system of sel-
ling tickets through hundreds of agents in'Victoria and
elsewhere seems to demand that all returns should be
made at least a week previous to the date of the drawing.
The recent reception of Bill Martin at Melb.
St. Vincent’s Fair shows that it would be almost worth
while for Australian cycling leagues to unite and pay the
renowned Plugger £2OOO a year to stay here and ride.
Boom the sport Bill certainly does, for Saturday brought
a bigger and more enthusiastic crowd around the arena
than has been seen for many a day. When William, bare-
armed and pink-suited, made his appearance, he was
simply roared at. He is thinner in face than of old,
but is very fat about the legs, and, were he not a man
who is always fit, he would be reckoned out of condition.
No doubt it was the green tinge in his blood that in-
duced him to appear gratis at St. Vincent’s show. His
entries, however, being irregularly made, he had no
chance for the prizes had he won them, but he rode four
hard races (only five days ashore) and raked in at least
£lOO for the charity.

Pitted against Beauchamp, R. Lewis, and Hunt
in the heat of the mile scratch at Melb. St. Vincent’s
Fair, Billmartin went out at the last lap and won in great
style, and, later in the afternoon, he and Body paced one
another up to the field in the preliminary of the handicap,
for him to win from L. M. Jackson, jerking his machine
around the last turn as he used to do two years ago. Bill
was blocked in the semi-final of the handicap, but, in the
final of the mile, he met Walne, who had scratched him-
self for the heat of the handicap which Bill won. Half a
lap from home Martin shot out, and AValne hanging to
him a most exciting battle took place along the straight.
Walne’s finish was too good for the Yank, and as head to
head they passed the line, Walne’s wheel was a few' inches
in front. Martin is out now with a challenge to Walne
for £2so—while Don Walker wants Bill to lay him £lOO to
£5O and ride three distances in a match.

The main result of last week’s Sydney military
tournament was to prove that at mounted games the
bush-whacker—the real way-back bushy—can badly lick
the city and bush townsmen that comprise the Lancers
and Mounted Rifles. Australian Horse competitors, many
of whom had never seen the events before, got into every
final, and they won one event straight out, dead-heated
with M.R. in two others, and got innumerable places.
In several events said competitors captured the hearts of
the public, but lost the prizes, by going through at a
gallop, whilst the more experienced Lancers and M.R.
took things at a steady canter ; but with more practice
they should be able to give the latter this little bit in.
Apropos: in the sham-fight, during camp, officers had
hard work to stop their men from charging clean over
any of the enemy they came in contact with.

Tom MaJone’s former hostelry, the Gladstone,
at Tempe (Arneliffe) is being taken over by Mr. John
Ferris, who intends putting the running grounds into
thorough order, and starting matters with a handicap, of
which the programme will shortly appear
War between civilized nations over the
Samoan question would, according to German
minister Yon Bulow, be criminal, “ but the main-
tenance of Germany’s right is a point of honor.”
Which is to say that Germany is prepared, if
necessary, to chance her share of criminality.
“Crowner’s quest” again. Three men
were recently killed through the faulty construc-
tion of a temporary bridge at the Pieman (Tas.).
It was explained that the cables that formed the
chief part of the suspension bridge simply drew
through the clips and deposited the whole struc-
ture,. with the workmen, into the river. The jury
verdicted that “no blame could be attached to
anyone.” A local newspaper passed over the re-
mains of the three men with the barest mention,
but grew eloquently sorrowful at “the loss of the
iron rails.”
Recent Samoan events make it look as if
Kipling’s “ White Man’s Burden ” is rapidly get-
ting heavier. One hundred and ten whites go out
for niggers’ wool and come back badly shorn
themselves. Butcher’s bill : 7 killed and 7
wounded. They had with them 150 “friendly”
natives who, finding they were short of cartridges,
very sensibly bolted. The “automatic Colt”
gun went bung at the critical moment, and on the
whole the niggers had much the best end of the
stick, though it is said (evidence not very clear)
that 30 of them were killed. Three of the whites
killed were officers—Lieuts. Lansdale and Mona-
ghan, of the U.S. ship Philadelphia, and Lieut.
Freeman of H.M.S. Tauranga. The last-men-
tioned officer, who was well-known in Sydney and
whose portrait appears herewith, had seen much
service, and possessed, in addition to several pro-
fessional decorations, the R.HS. bronze medal,
awarded for a gallant life-saving exploit in shark-
infested waters.
Policy-holders in the great A.M.P. Society
will be pleased to learn that the experienced and
trusted Reginald J. Black, who is a retiring
director, will be a candidate for re-election. On
the death of J. R. Hill, the A.M.P’s deputy-
chairman, Mr. Black was chosen by the directors
to fill the vacant seat on the board. Mr. Hill was
president of the Bank of New South Wales, and
the directors of that institution also paid Mr.
Black the compliment of selecting him as being, in
their opinion, from his extensive knowledge of
financial and commercial affairs, the best man for
the position. The investment of the large aggre-
gation of surplus funds of the A.M.P. Society is
the most difficult question the board has to deal
with, and as Mr. Black has retired from active
business, he is able to give ample time and energy
to his responsible duties.
Cabled that Jack Want has resigned his
place as Attorney-General in the Reid Ministry—
which apparently means that, after a lot of con-
sideration, he has made up his mind to sacrifice
his fat salary and fight Federation. So much the
better: an open enemy is far to be preferred to a
treacherous friend-on-a-fence.
Poet Ogilvie has a practical horse-side as
well as a poetical, and when he was handling “a
young one ” the other day it fell and rolled on
him, hurting his shoulder to some extent. The
enforced leisure has been productive of seve-
ral sets of verses which will shortly ap'pear in
The Bulletin. Ogilvie’s charming book of
“ Fair Girls and Gray Horses ” continues to sell
as well as it deserves—that is to say, splendidly.
The price is 4s. 6d. post-free from Bulletin

Stephens, the victim of the Melb. Market
murder, was a witness at an inquest about a year
ago, and was shown over the morgue by the
coroner’s orderly. “ What a ghastly place ! ” he
remarked on emerging from the mortuary. “It
gives me the horrors. I won’t go in there again
till I have to.” And now he has “had to ” —with
two bullets in his body, and with his neck nearly
severed.
The Q. anti-Federalists are beginning to
move. At a “monster ” meeting lately called in
Brisbane one or two more or less defunct
politicians, headed by the ancient editor of that
most miserable of all rags, the local Telegraph,
tried to raise their discordant and feeble voices
against the extinction of Queensland and the
transformation of Brisbane into a grazing-ground
for N.S.W. cattle. Two of the chief speakers—
the president of the moribund local Protection
League and the self-styled leader of the Freetrade
party—created much amusement by flatly con-
tradicting each other, and the meeting, which
consisted mainly of a thousand empty chairs,
broke up abruptly on the vulgar suggestion of
someone that funds were needed to carry on the
agitation.
It takes a bard to catch a bard ; and E. J.
Brady claims to have caught the popular Newbolt
tripping when he wrote that
Drake, he’s in his hammock and a thousand feet below.
Brady points out that Drake was not thrust over-
board in the usual sailor-fashion, but was coffined
in lead that he might be better preserved to fight
Spaniards at the Day of Judgment. But
surely the lead coffin does not exclude the ham-
mock ? Anyway, Newbolt is welcome to pick
holes in Brady’s just-published collection of verses,
“The Ways of Many Waters,” and a copy has
been sent him to that end and others more com-
plimentary. The price of “The Ways” is 5s.,

Archbishop O’Reily is backing Editor
Denny, of the S. A- Roman Catholic organ,
Southern Cross, in the latter’s attempt to slip
into Parliament between Premier Kingston and
labor-leader Batchelor, the sitting members for
West Adelaide. Denny upholds the sphefne
of subsidising R.C. schools with a capitation
grant; Kingston and Batchelor, as in duty bound,
oppose it. The Bulletin hopes that the West
Adelaide Irishmen, who number many good
democrats, will, on this'momentous occasion, bear
in mind Dan O’Connell’s historical caution
against allowing priests to interfere in politics.
Kingston, and the broad-minded men who have
fought under his banner, can give, and have given,
the Irish more than they could ever hope to get
if represented in Parliament solely by men of
their own blood and creed. Even should
Denny succeed in ejecting Kingston from the
Assembly, the cause of a religious capitation
grant would still be hopeless, as the national
vote on the subject taken a year or two ago
clearly showed. The Bulletin calls on all
good Irish - Australians in West Adelaide to
record their votes for Kingston and Batchelor—
for the honest Radicalism which in politics asks
no man his religion, and which believes that chil-
dren of all creeds should study and play together
at the same schools to the end that they may
really know one another and be friends in after-
life.
A few days ago Sub-Inspector Cooperwired
from Cooktown to Brisbane that he had buried 37
bodies (victims of recent hurricane), and that
several corpses of colored men were found 2 feet
above the ground on trees. It’s only in N.Q. that
such things could occur. Also, according to
Hamilton, M.L. A., thousands of snakes, land and
water, were found thrown up on the coast, after
the hurricane. Bodies of porpoises were found 40
and 50ft. above sea-level, while trees were barked
and grass torn up by the roots. A long sandy
beach was transformed into a bare stretch of rock,
the sand having been all carried away by the
violence of the wind.

This Company is being' formed for the purpose of acquiring from the Vendors the Invention, Process, Specifications,
and Patent Eights (as hereafter detailed) of the Explosive or Series of Explosives known as “ Kallenite,” and for
the purpose of Manufacturing, Selling and Disposing of the same in New South Wales and elsewhere.
The Explosive “ Kallenite” was discovered by Messrs. Alexander Fraser and John Callaghan, and the invention
was matured and perfected by these gentlemen aided by the advice and co-operation of Major W. C. Quinby, of San
Francisco, California, who has had an experience of over thirty years in the use, sale, and manufacture of all grades
of explosives. _
The Vendors having carried on extensive experiments for a considerable time with ultimate satisfactory results
now feel confident that they are offering to the country a valuable manufacturing industry, and to capitalists an
exceptional opportunity for investment.
Major Quinby reported : —“ After tireless efforts of myself and the members of the Syndicate, WE HAVE PRO-
DUCED THE BEST EXPLOSIVE EVER YET TESTED BY EXPERIENCED MEN. The discoveries are not only
revelations, but in their effects will be almost revolutionary, especially as far as these colonies are concerned.”
“ ‘ Kallenite ’is the most powerful explosive that I know of. IT SEEMS TO BE ABSOLUTELY SMOKELESS
AND FUMELESS. It can be manufactured in Australia as cheaply as any first-class explosive can be produced in
any other country. A clean, safe, smokeless, and fumeless explosive will be hailed with joy by miners everywhere.”
The following is an extract from the Sydney Morning Herald of 12th January, 1899, giving the result of a Public
Test, made at the Government Works, Glebe Island, by permission of the Minister for Works
“ The experiment was carried out under the direetiom of Mr. T. E. Burrows, of the Harbors and Rivers Depart-
ment, who has charge of the works. Fifty pounds weight of ‘Kallenite’ having been inserted in the bottom of the
four holes drilled downwards from a ledge high up the side of a stone cliff, it was discharged by electricity, and
straightway, with merely a slight incidental report, 200 cubic yards of rock suddenly broke out and fell forward in
fragments. There was little, if any, upheaval. The movement seemed similar to that of a landslip, and no fumes
or smoke were discernible.
“ No. 1 dynamite has 25 per cent, non-explosive material in its composition,-gelignite, 4 per cent, non-explosive ;
and blasting gelatine about 2 per cent, non-explosive ; but‘Kallenite,’it is claimed, is entirely explosive, and that
gives it a great advantage.”
Another test was made by Mr. J. Hutchen, Manager of the Mount David Gold Mine, who wrote
“ I have this day made a crucial test of the new explosive ‘ Kallenite ’ in all parts of the mine, stopes, drives, and
in the main shaft, and am pleased to say that it has done most satisfactory work all along the line.
“ The test made in the shaft was most pleasing, as the men went down immediately after the explosion and
FOUND, EXCELLENT WORK DONE, AND FOUND VERY LITTLE SMOKE OR FUME, OTHER THAN LEFT
BY THE BURNT FUSE.” '
As it is intended to produce “Kallenite” near the point of consumption, there will be NO HIGH COST FOR
TRANSPORTATION ; as it will be stored in the Companv’s magazines, THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE OF STORAGE
WILL ALSO BE SAVED; and as there is NO EXUDATION, NO DELETERIOUS CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION,
AND CONSEQUENTLY NO DESTRUCTION OF STOCK, this saving alone over other explosives will make ah and-
some profit to the manufacturers of “ Kallenite.” r
Of the keeping qualities—a very important point to be considered—Major Quinby says :
“ The original samples of ‘ Kallenite ’ at first stood a heat test of only four minutes ; but now they stand ope of
twentv-six minutes, or more than six times the amount they did at first.* ‘Kallenite,’ he ventured to say, WOULD
NEVER DETERIORATE, BUT WOULD IMPROVE BY AGE AND KEEPING.
“This was a most valuable fact, and was characteristic of no other powder.
“‘KALLENITE,’ he considered, ‘WAS THE SIMPLEST EXPLOSIVE TO MANUFACTURE IN THE
WORLD.’”
* It is to be noted that the heat-tests above referred to were applied TO THE SAME SAMPLES with the
following results, viz. :
When the samples were newly made... ... ... ... 4 minutes
AFTER HAVING BEEN KEPT FOR 4 MONTHS 26 MINUTES.
Another most important, feature of the process is the fact that what w r as at first considered to be only a
waste product in the manufacture of the blasting explosives was found, as a result of the careful and patient
experiments, to produce the most perfect smokeless powder for sporting and military purposes ever seen by
experimenters, so that, in addition to what it was at first sought to attain, the Company should produce and
supply an absolutely smokeless gunpowder in sufficient quantities to satisfy all demands. The material of which
this fine and valuable pow’der is made is in reality but a by-product of the “Kallenite” process, and conse-
quently can be manufactured very economically, and sold at a large profit.
It is estimated that to purchase a suitable site, to erect the necessary buildings, with the most modern
and up-to-date machinery for the manufacture of all classes of explosives, “Kallenite,” cordite, smokeless
powder, blasting-powder, etc., and to provide materials, and cover working costs for extensive operations,
£40,000 will be more than sufficient.
Briefly summarised, the following advantages may be claimed
“ KALLENITE,” in the various grades in which it can be manufactured, is, considering all the qualities required
or desirable for various uses, the best-known explosive.
“ KALLENITE ” is practically smokeless and fumeless.
“ KALLENITE ”is stronger than any other nitro-glyoerine compound. There is no residue.
“ KALLENITE ” is locally made of Australian products, and can be manufactured cheaper at a profit than any
other nitro-glycerine compound.
“KALLENITE ” is as safe to handle as any other nitro-glycerine compound, and becomes more safe, instead of
more dangerous, with keeping.
“ KALLENITE,” being stronger, safer, and cheaper, should command the entire Australasian trade, with a hand-
some profit on the total capital of the Company.
“ KALLENITE,” by reason of its superiority and local production, should command the Government require-
ments for National defence.
The only contract entered into on behalf of the Company is one dated the 12th day of April, 1899, between T. H.
Kelly, G. W. Bell, Walter Sully, and R. N. Kirk of the one part, and the Company of the other part.
The abovementioned contract may be inspected at the Office of the Company.
Full Prospectuses, with forms of application and copies of Government and other reports, may be obtained from
the Brokers of the Company.
The Company will be considered formed as soon as 40,000 shares have been applied for.
The whole of the money subscribed, less a sum not exceeding £lOOO, and expenses of brokerage and flotation and
legal expenses, will be placed to the credit of the Company.

How American Axes are Made.
The American axe has been the pioneer’s
greatest mechanical ally in Australia. In clearing,
splitting, cutting timber for mills, and in a hun-
dred other operations the light, keen chapping
tool that comes from America has been premier
for many years. The superiority of a first-class
axe is ensured by using superior metal and skill in
its manufacture, and there is a great deal more in
the simple-looking tool than appears to the eye
The Collins Axe is a triumph in this respect and
has earned a great name among bushmen. At the
recent Royal Agricultural Society’s Show in Syd-
ney, J. M. Mackinolty won the champion-
ship (and the special prize presented by
Messrs. M. Moss and Co., of Wynyard
Lane, Sydney, on behalf of Collins and Co.)
with one of the make, and thus add'd to a list of
successes previously placed to the credit of Collins’
Axe. Some details of the manufacture of these
axes are illustrated on this page.
An axe is made in two parts, a “ poll ” or head
of iron, and a “ bitt ”or cutting blade of steel; the
place where these are joined, or welded, may be
recognised by a faint line a few inch' s, above the
edge of the axe. Axe polls or heads are made
either by punching the eyes out of solid iron, or
by welding together the ends of blanks of iron
that have been bent around to form the eye. Polls
with the eyes punched out are the strongest and
best. Collins’ American Pattern axes have
punched polls. Axe bits or cutting blades are
made either by splitting or opening the iron, in-
serting the steel blank (fig. 3), and then welding
the iron and steel solid as one piece, or by welding
a thin envelope of steel (fig. 4) over the iron,
whereby is secured a handsome exterior with a
large display of steel surface with but little wear
or durability.
The following illustrations clearly show the re-
sults of the two methods of manufacture.

steel ready for inserting

“Overcoat” axes are so
made.
Axes made as described in figure 2, having th<
steel welded over the iron, appear to have a large
amount of steel in them, while in reality the steel
available for a cutting edge only extends from D
to E, and is only 3oz. of the 4oz. used, while in
axes with inserted steel, as described in figure 1, a
cutting edge is available until all the steel is worn
from B to A, which in an axe stamped Collins and
Co., Hartford, is not less than 12oz. in a 3£lb axe,
thus yielding more than three times the wear oi
steel applied as in figure 2.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should

others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms

Melb. Argus reads Minister Taverner a
lecture on what he will learn and unlearn by visit-
ing Britain. Its readers are asked to conceive
what Taverner’s feelings will be when he looks
upon the old country’s activity and notes “ the
infinitesimal interference by the State.” Taverner
probably will be struck, though not quite as the
Argus expects. After his trunks have been over-
hauled by State Custom House officers, and he
has travelled in State-inspected railways, he may
ride in a hansom licensed by the State, and be
stuck-up by a State policeman who is regulating
the traffic. He will stay in a State-licensed hotel,
will go to a theatre where he will see a play which
has been submitted to a State censor and is pro-
duced in a State-licensed building. He will find
in army of €k>vt. inspectors supervising every
factory he enters, he may visit a State-regulated
coal-mine, he will tumble across State health-
inspectors at every turn, he may go to a State
church on Sunday, and look at some compulsory
State schools on Monday, and ride there in a
municipal (i.e., a local State) tram, mix municipal
water with his whisky, and read his evening
paper by municipal gas-light, and wash in a
municipal bath, and go round and see the work-
men’s houses owned and built by the municipality.
And then he can look at the State telegraphs and
the State-regulated Bank of England, and come
home again.

to their advantage to send their opal direct to

A severe reproof from wayback :
Ed. Bulletin. —Paragraph (18 2 '99) urging suppression:
of the “ newspaper bludger” reflects discreditably upon
the would-be exclusives of the journalistic press. The
badge suggested as a method of designating duly-
accredited press representatives would, by the writer’s
own showing, merely be an advt. soliciting those ques-
tionable favors shared in by the bludgers aforesaid. Also,
said badge would savor of degrading mendicancy as a
means of participating, “ free gratis,” in the gorge-and-
swill functions characteristic of an age of swinish public
display. And who are the journalistic representatives
claiming thus exclusively all the privileges alleged to per-
tain to the Fourth Estate—specially the right to public
bounty in the shape of bribes from foolish aspirants for
newspaper jam ? According to the par. under notice, the
“ bludger” is a loafer without a license ; the fellow who
needs the badge is the legitimate deadhead. “The ill-
odour in which pressmen are held by some people ” may
be due to bogus journalists ; but the well-merited con-
tempt in which average pressmen are held by many in-
telligent persons is due to characteristics too odiously
prominent to need further mention. Such are the
would-be exclusives who purpose joining an organised
Bohemian Olub ! The present writer was connected
with a newspaper, wrote its leaders, dictated its policy,
built it up into a prosperous concern, and, while
thus engaged in licking the rag into shape, educating its
nominal editor, and acting as bear-leader for its reporter,
who was the proprietor-editor’s brother, the literary
laborer never attended gorges or public functions in a
press capacity. The nominal editor and his brother posed
as the authors of all the original matter published in the
rag ; and many free-lances who are, or have been, in like
case, do not grudge the “bludger” his share of the
relinquished bribe proffered by folly and claimed by
knavery. After all, ’tis only natural that such jealousies
should find open expression. The journalistic press being
mendacious, parasitic, and socially pernicious, the tool
of the quack, the abortionist, and the commercial fraud,
the mouthpiece of blatant ignorance and the veriest slave
of the Mammon of Unrighteousness, it is not at all sur-
prising that its inferior mercenaries regard the “bludger”
as a dangerous rival.— Frank.

Notice of testamentary
BEQUESTS.
The Late LAMES WEIR
of Saint Clouds Blackrock in tiie County of Dublin
Esquire by his Will dated 12th of October 1893
bequeathed the following legacies amongst others
namely:—One thousand pounds to Mrs. Rachel
Sandiland ; One thousand pounds to the children
of the late Andrew Brown ; One thousand pounds
to each of the seven children of Testator’s wife’s
sister Isabella Fallow, namely James Fallow,
William Fallow, John Fallow, Gavin Fallow,
Janet Fallow, Mary Fallow, and Agnes Fallow.
One thousand pounds to Mrs. Grace Barr,
formerly Steele. One thousand pounds in equal
shares amongst the children of John Steel son of
Mary Steel; One thousand pounds to the issue
living at the death of the Testator of James Weir
who died in his lifetime ; One thousand pounds to
each of the six children of Testator’s brother
Thomas Weir deceased, namely James Weir,
Francis Weir, Andrew Weir, Agnes Weir, Eliza-
beth Weir, and Margaret Weir.
The Testator recited that some of the persons
who might be entitled to legacies under his Will
were, the Testator believed, resident in America,
Australia and New Zealand, and it contained the
following clause: “ I hereby declare that every
person entitled to a legacy under this my Will
shall within a period of three years from the day
of my death send to my Trustee or Trustees a
claim (in writing) for such legacy and any person
who shall not send in such claims as aforesaid
shall absolutely forfeit all benefit which he or she
might have otherwise claimed under this my Will
and the Legacy hereinbefore bequeathed to him or
her shall be dealt with as a lapsed legacy.” And
the Testator directed his Trustees as soon as con-
veniently might be after his death to cause
advertisements to be inserted in newspapers
requiring all persons entitled to legacies to send in
their claims. The Testator died 30th October,
1898, and said Will and one Codicil were on the
18th November, 1898, duly proved by Sir William
Findlater, Robert Bell, James Anderson Merry
the Executors and Trustees thereof.
Now all such of above-named Legatees as have
not already done so and all other (if any) persons
claiming to be Legatees or to be beneficially entitled
under the said Will and Codicil are hereby re-
quired to send in the said Executors and Trustees
at the office of the undersigned solicitors claims
(in writing) and the necessary proofs of identifica-
tion, and the Trustees will at the expiration of a
period of three years after the death finally wind
up the Estate and distribute the then remaining
assets of the Testator without reference to any
claims except those which shall have been sent
in within said period. The Executors have col-
lected and realised a very large proportion of the
Testator’s assets and they have paid the Testator’s
debts and thus will shortly be in a position to pay
the above mentioned legacies and to distribute
their Testator’s Estate (except of epurse such part
of the residuary property as it may be necessary
to retain three years).
The Executors believe that they already possess
the addresses of the abovenamed legatees but
for extra precaution and in pursuance of their
Testator’s directions publish this advertisement
and particularly request each named or indicated
legatee to send in a formal written claim without
further delay.

Mr. C. J. A. NIELSEN,
A Living Witness oi the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To IIKRR RASSMUSSEN.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great a irony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.
Sciatica Cured.

Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Aifaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

Mr. THOMAS MUDIMAN,
The well-known Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney,
states, on oath, how his shattered nervous system was
completely cured and restored.
Statutory Declaration.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, do
hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the NERVES, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried
several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rass-
mussen’s Purely Herbal ALFALINE VITALITY PILLS,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COM-
PLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and although
this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.
The ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same
to be true.
Declared at Sydney this 29th day of April, 1898.

B. R. Wise on the Cabbage-Tree Mob and
co. :
The opponents of Federation said trust the people pro-
spectively, but in the same breath characterised the
people of the other provinces as plunderers and robbers.
If the angel Gabriel came down from heaven and offered
them a constitution, some newspapers would fight
against it. They had all sorts of faddists and extremists
arrayed against them—single-taxers, socialists, and men
of that extreme stamp. The Domain orators were fond-
ling over Dr. MacLaurin and Mr. Jack Haynes in loving
embrace, and gloating over the discovery of the admir-
able qualities they had just discovered in each other.
The object of these combinations was to prevent
a reasonable basis of union on any terms. They
wanted a union that would give them Sydney as
the capital, that would better all their posi-
tions and cost them nothing extra. It was a heaven-
born Constitution they wanted. If they recalled
the narratives of the Old Testament they would re-
member how an experiment in this direction was tried.
A Constitution was given on Mount Sinai to the great
leader of the Jewish people, but how were Moses and
Aaron received ? . . . Provincialists throughout all time
were of the same type, and used the same language.
First, there w'as an outbreak of rebellion, because it was
given out by Moses and Aaron that the worship of the
golden calf would have to be discontinued, and the idols
destroyed. It was the golden calf image that was stand-
ing in the way of some Sydney people just now.
Dubberke’s friend, Pratt, who scooped the
=£sso reward in the boot-trunk mystery case, is
said to have deft Melbourne for parts unknown.
Anyhow, his'offic-e knows him not at present, and
his solicitor declines to acquaint the police with
his whereabouts.

SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS

Bayswater, Sydney, October, 1898.
W. H. Mai, vox, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir,—For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salts,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY:—
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of mvself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

Al!
High, clear and high, the soaring skylark sings
Love ! Love I Love ! the joy of life and woe :
Throbs, throbs his heart, as upward on thrilling wings
Far, far he soars from this dim world below.
Was it a skylark’s voice or a soul’s triumphant song
We heard in the days gone by in the woods of Dande-
nong?
Rose, lovely rose—a fairer rose was she —
Rose, white rose, I kiss your tender leaves 1
Speak, speak, speak, O soul-white rose for me,
Say, say to her ray heart in silence grieves.
Lonely ami sad it grieves amidst the careless throng . . .
Ah, green are the waving trees in the woods of Dande-
nong 1
Star, crystal star, shining where angels be,
Bright,,bright star—yet brighter were her eyes—
Ai! Ai ! Ai! Star of my life was she !
Shine, gently shine where low her bright head lies.
And ah, but the world is cold and the way is dark and
long ;
And oh, that we u-ere once more in the woods of Dande-
nong.

THEN IT WENT ON ALL RIGHT.
The writer of the letter which I am going to
copy for you in a moment has a complaint to
make. Rather, perhaps, a complaint to place on
record, as the reason for it is passed away for the
present, and she hopes—and we hope with her-=.
that it may not return. The complaint does not
refer to any relative, friend, or foe, but to her Own
heart. It did not work well. It was weak, and
for a long time she was unable to find means to
make it do better, Which was a serious matter,
inasmuch as the vigor of the circulation of the
blood always depends upon the force wherewith
the heart drives it.
Still, it seems to me wb Ought to be a bit indul-
gent towards the heart in view of the labor it has
to perform. Remember that it never takes a full
minute’s rest at one time, night or day, from the
instant it begins at your birth until, like a muffled
drum, it stops for good and all—life’s funeral
march to the grave being over, Luring all this
While, ten years or a hundred, the heart has got to
keep on pumping blood through your body at the
rate of from 130 strokes«a minute in childhood to
§0 or 60 in old age. If you happen to have ft
mechanical turn of mind, it may interest you to
figure out how much this stands for in units of
horse-power for a given case and time. If not,
you can take my word for it that, merely as a
machine, the heart deserves your respect. So long
as it goes ahead steadily, up hill and down dale,
hammering away softly but strongly, you haven’t
a word to say for or against it; but when it begins
to get weak, maybe skipping a stitch now and
then, you call in the doctor, who puts the tip of
his finger just below the base of your left thumb,
looks wise and solemn (as befits the occasion), and
says, “ Ah, yes, yes ; I see, I see.” But what does
he see ? He doesn’t tell you that ; he leaves medi-
cine, and mentions when he will iook in again.
But as to the letter I spoke of. “For many
years,” the lady says, “ I suffered from indigestion
and weak heart. Very little exertion made me
feel weary and tired. Cold, clammy sweats broke
over me. I had a poor appetite, and after meals
an aching pain at the chest and a miserable sink-
ing feeling at the stomach. I had also much pain
at the left side, and my heart would flutter so as
to frighten me. At length I became so weak I
was barely able to get about, being no longer able
to do my housework.
“ Owing to the trouble at my heart I obtained
no proper rest at night, and often walked about
my bedroom at night. Many times these attacks
were so bad I thought I was dying. During the
day a sense of suffocation sometimes came upon
me, and I was obliged to go to the door for fresh
air.
“Year after year I suffered like this; now a
little better, now as bad as I could be. In No-
vember, 1887, while on a visit to Croydon, my son-
in-law persuaded me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
He got me a bottle, and after taking it I experi-
enced great relief. The pain at my heart was
easier, and I felt better as a whole. I could eat
well, and the food agreed with me.
“ I now felt encouraged to continue using this
remedy. Soon I was in better health than for
years, the heart trouble having disappeared alto-
gether. Since that time when I feel anything
ailing me a few doses of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
never fail to give the desired relief. I have told
many persons of the benefit I have derived from
it, and hereby consent to your publishing this
statement should you wish to do so.”—(Signed)
(Mrs.) William Harrington, near Wickford Hill,
Clare, Suffolk, November 12, 1897.
Now what ailed Mrs. Harrington’s heart ? Why,
precisely the same things that ailed her lungs, her
nerves and her muscles — weakness. Therein she
is right. It was a weak heart, but not a diseased
heart. The heart is a muscle, and (seeing the pro-
digious lot of work it has to do) necessarily a
strong, active muscle. But it will not work with-
out pay any more than you or I will. With all the
rest of the body, it has got to be sustained and
strengthened by food. Here we have the point,
then. The lady was afflicted with chronic indiges-
tion. For this reason her whole body grew weak
—the heart, of course, with other parts of the
engine. Hence all the symptoms she names. Her
immense all-round weakness and puller-down is
that same old dyspepsia. When Mother Seigel’s
Syrup made the digestion of plenty of food pos-
sible, the heart went on all right, like a newly-
wound clock.’'

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing- cough, difficulty<iri breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and ,t 9 those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation ill the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
Sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that 1 could not leave my bed. ' At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and-after taking, two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria,”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthfna, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1583,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelohg, Victoria.” > ■

suffering greatly, and in such a serious
nervous condition that she never expected
to live through it.
“Yes,” said Mrs. Dean, “hope seemed
deul. One after another I had tried all the
medicines and pills that are so widely
advertised as nerve cures. They were all
ghastly failures. I believe such things
would be total failures in every case.”
‘ How so, Mrs. Dean ? ”
“ Because I’ve made enquiries, end have
been so informed by people who ought to
know. Once a gentleman who has a special
knowledge of medicines called here and I
took the opportunity of enquiring as to a
very widely advertised medicine which is
guaranteed to cure nerve affections —in fact,
it is warranted to cure every illness.”
“Yes, responded the reporter,” I think I
know what you refer to. I know the game;
they assert they cure everything—but tell
me what this gentleman said.”
“He said, ‘I know what the nostrum in
question is; it is a delusion, and entirely
ineffective,’ and that I should have got just
as much relief if I had taken as many clay
pills. You may guess my astonishment and
chagrins Here I had been taking this stuff
on the faith of the statements put forward
in print, hoping day by day to find an
improvement in my condition, only to find
in the end that I had been grossly deceived,
and was cramming myself with useless
rubbish. And I have reason to believe,
pursued Mrs. Dean confidentially, that all
these new fangled catch-penny medicines
now so widely advertised are all useless—
these people only want your money—as to
your health, little they care about that, for
they are here to-day and gone to-morrow,
to seek fresh fields and pastures new in
other count)ies, after having fooled all the
gullible people to be got hold of here. ”
“ Did you try many medicines? ”
“ Yes, I tried them all. I also went to
see certain people who advertise themselves
specialists'in debility complaints.”
“ How did you get on with them? ”
“ Well, the least said about them the
better—their advice was about as good as
the other things I was talking about.”
‘‘ But doctors, Mrs. Dean the doctors—
it is the business of these gentleman to cure
such maladies as yours ? ”
“The doctors’me icines did not appear
to touch the cause of my complaint.”
“ Now, Mrs, Dean,” said the newspaper
man, “ kindly give the particular symptoms
of your illness —how did it start, for
instance ? ”
“ I was sitting upstairs one day, when
suddenly I felt a most peculiar sensation in
my legs—it was as though they were numb
and paralyzed, and I had hardly any feeling
in them. I tried to get down stairs but was
utterly unable to do so, and I had to call out
to my daugh er to help me. That was the
beginning of my troubles. For many
months after that I was in a perilous state. I
continually suffered from nervous headaches.
My nerves got worse and worse till I
daren’t go out alone. Sometimes this
sensation would come over me , whilst
walking in the streets or riding on a tram.
I should start trembling. 'I hings would go
hazy before my vision and all feeling would
disappear from my lower limbs. It would
feel just as though the whole world were
giving way under me. hy, on these
occasions I posti\ ely couldn’t see straight.
Seeing wasn’t believing then, I can assure
you, for I couldn’t even trust my eye sight.”
“Can you describe the sensation more
fully?”' w =
“No, I hardly think I can. It was a
terribly low, ‘ all-gone ’ sensation —it was
horrible, and I fairly turn cold now when I
think of it. Frequently I turned giddy.
The merest shock would start my nerves
shaking. Any one coining suddenly into
the house, for instance, or anyone slamming
the door, would cause me to go all over »
tremble.”
“ How did you rest ’ ”
“That question is answered in three words
*1 was sleepless,’ replied Mrs. Dean.
Night after night I passed without sleeping,
and at length I got into such a state of
trepidation that I daren’t allow myself to
be left alone anywhere under any circum-
stances. So weak were my nerves that I
was not able to read the paper. I was so
easily excited by anything unusual which
appeared in the paper. The account of a
fatal accident or anything of that nature
would affect me severely. As I have
already told you, I dare not go out by my-
self, but sometimes, when my husband would
return from business, I would cling to his
arm and get a short distance. This
continued debility of my nervous system
resulted in an intense nervous depression.
I became horribly low-spirited. I lost my
usual cheerful spirits entirely, and felt I
didn’t care what happened to me. I took a
gloomy and melancholy view of everything.
I didn’t even trouble to eat. I never
wanted any food. It was placed before me
and I ate what I could mechanically. I had
no interest in anything, and, as I’ve said, I
never expected to recover. My daughter
can tell you that I’ve not overtold my tale
of misery.”
“Indeed no,”saidthisyounglady, who was
present; “all mamma says is quite true, andone
of us had to stay with her both night and
day. It was a bad case of nervous pros
tration, so the doctors told us.”
‘ I changed terribly in appearance,” con-
tinued Mrs. Dean. “My nearest friends
would hardly have known me, and my face
wore a haggard and anxious look. It was a
bit of bad luck that I didn’t take Clements
Tonic sooner than I did, because, you see,
I should have been saved all these months
of suffering, and I should have taken it
sooner, doubtless, but for my husband;
though, to tell you the truth, it was he who
obtained Clements Tonic for me in the end.
You see, explained Mrs. Dean, he had
j taken Clements Tonic, and it cured him of
indigestion in quite a marvellous way, but
he was under the impression that Clements
Tonic was an indigestion cure, and nothing
more. Of course he was wrong, for when
he did obtain me a bottle, and I hazarded a
j few doses, the change in me was astonishing.
! I can’t exactly explain the good that I found
Clements Tonic was doing me, but it felt
something like being lightened up and
I pulled together. It braced me up like a
b »th. I began to feel bright and iapp/
again, and to rejoice in my returning heauai.
I ate my food with a zest, slept peacefully
and long at nights, and once more could
walk the streets without tremor, help or
fear. I kept on taking Clements Tonic till
my cure was complete, and my nerves were
as strong and unfailing as when I was a girl
I tell you I am really grateful, and I have
already written a private note to tin
proprietors of Clements Tonic expressing
my gratitude.”
“ Can we print what you have said ? ”
“You may publish it as you think fit.”

Notes Celestial.
BY AN AUSTRALIAN IN CHINA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tint introduction of railways into China has
provided fresh pastures for the Celestial Bill
Sikes. Accompanied by a screwdriver he will
travel in a train car; and if every screw and piece
of brass-work doesn’t leave that car with him it
will only be because the screw driver was no good.
When travelling on a Chinese railway I never
venture to sleep; if I did I should wake up with
nothing left me but my shirt.

It was at an amateur dramatic performance by
the European “ Naicest ” in Shanghai—the Paris
of the East and the wickedest city in the world.
During the course of the play one of the mummers
had to be considerably battered and then killed ;
but while this process was going on, a pretty
Chinese girl in the stalls jumped up and sereanred
out “ Wha’ foh you kill my boss ! ” The amateur
mummer’s wife made unpleasant enquiries, and
even divorce-proceedings were talked of. But it’s
a custom of the country.
» * * *
Some little time ago an eminent Chinese actor
appeared by Imperial command before the Son of
Heaven at the Palace, and wishing to tickle the
Royal ribs, introduced a suit of European clothes
into one of his acts, putting the Vest over the coat
and the seat of the trousers in front, and thus
highly amusing the blue-blooded audience. But
on leaving the Palace the poor mummer forgot to
take the clothes with him, and they were found
several days after by one of the courtiers, who,
enraged, at the idea of having been so long within
a mile of anything foreign, reported the matter to
His Celestial Majesty, who immediately ordered
the actor’s arrest. The culprit was taken to the
Palace and —beheaded !
• * * *
Which energetic proceeding recalls what hap-
pened when the Chinese reformer, Kang Yu Way,,
thought it advisable, for the sake of his health, to
quit Peking, and the Empress Dowager sent a
gunboat in pursuit of Kang’s steamer. The gun-
boat had to put into Ctiofoo to re-coal, and,
failing therefore to catch up with the fugitive,
the captain returned to the capital to report. He
will never “report” again.
* * * *
The lighting system of Peking is worth munici-
pal attention. A certain sum —about <£looo—is
set aside for the lighting of the'city streets. The
places where the lamp-posts ought to be are easy
enough to find—the sites are there right enough—
but if you walked from one end of the city to the
other, you would never find a public light. And
yet the money is regularly set aside from the Im-,
perial Treasury for the purpose.

Was living for. a time in one of the Yamens, or
official residences, at Wuchang, 700 miles up the
Yangtze. There were missionaries in the city,
but, being engaged on important business, I, of
course, carefully avoided these gentlemen: because
you cannot do business in China if you associate
with missionaries. The mandarins did their ut-
most to make me comfortable, even going so far
as to-engage a cook (at my expense) who said he
knew all about European cookery. I bore with
this fraud until he put a bottle of lavender-water
on the table, and insisted that it was vinegar.
Then I battered him, and upon one of the
mandarins interfering, 1 bashed him, and had to
leave Wuchang hurriedly.

The Canton executioners are complaining that
unless they get either more pay, or more
“patients” they will starve. They have asked
that in future they be paid 1000 cash (about 2s.) —
instead 500 cash, as heretofore—per head, in order
to’make up for the slump in business. The official
interviewed stated that though he could not grant
their request he was convinced their business
would very soon be brisker.
* * * *
It was in one of the few Provinces of the Middle
Kingdom where nominal Christianity is strong,
and where the ruling mandarin was entirely with
the Lord. A complicated case came up for hear-
ing: Shu Yao-fung said that So Ting-tsin owed
him 600 strings of cash ; So Ting-tsin said that on
the contrary Shu Yao-fung owed him 100 strings.
Shu was honest; his claim was just, and in other
circumstances would doubtless have been allowed.
But at the hearing So claimed to be a mission
preacher, and said that he trusted to the Lord to
bring him out all right. Decision accordingly
given against the man who was not with the Lord.
And yet the world wonders what is the cause of
the occasional attacks on missionaries !

Li Hung Chang relates that at Manchester he
dined with a gentleman, who was chairman of a
large company there, and that he (Li), wishing to
be polite in the Chinese way, asked his host what
salary he drew for his services. The chairman
replied that he received absolutely nothing ; but,
observing his guest’s incredulity, added, “ Well, I
occasionally receive a little present; ” and pointed
to a valuable diamond ring on his finger. “ Well,”
commented Li, with the Celestial equivalent for
a wink, “you could sell that for a large price, and
anything that will bring money is money ! ”

The reward of virtue ! A Japanese daily news-
paper, the Yorodzu, of Tokyo, is reaping the
recompense for its efforts on behalf of public
morality. Since publishing a list of the concu-
bines kept by men of note in Tokyo, including
prominent Government officials, bankers, and
merchants, it has increased its list of subscribers —
mostly ladies ! —by 4000, the total circulation now
amounting to 80,000. And the editor is over-
whelmed with letters of thanks from wives whom
he has enlightened about the little tricks of their
husbands.

GUMSUCKER.
Through the White Horse
Rapids.
“ OHILOAT,” an Australian, pictures to The
Bulletin some aspects of the road to Klondike: —
The journey to Dawson Oity, through the series of
lakes and rivers, is full of varied experiences and sur-
prises, and a man must look very sharp to escape mis-
adventure in some shape. For instance, in the “ White
Horse Rapids,” four miles in length, the fall of the
river is no less than 800 ft., and even after passing the
rapids we have drifted 100 miles in 16 hours. All the
waters of the lakes and rivers, before arriving at White
Horse, have to force their way through a straight narrow
passage about a quarter of a mile long and only 10yds.
wide, between high, perpendicular walls of basalt; and
so great is the compression that during its passage
through this canyon the centre of the stream is fully five
feet higher than the sides.
Safety depends upon the steerer keeping the course
straight, right on top of the mass of tumbling and seeth-
ing waves—should the boat swerve towards either side it
becomes a spinning-top, and a capsize is inevitable.
After emerging from this canyon, a number of falls have to
be negotiated, the series ending at the White Horse
proper, where, also, the last and greatest leap has to be
encountered, 10 to 13 feet deep, surrounded by powerful
eddies and sharp-pointed rocks. Here it is that so many
have lost their lives.
The miners usually land at the head of Miles Canyon be-
fore attempting the rapids to watch how other boats fare
at that last dangerous leap, and great is the cheering when
a boat comes safely through. I myself sat for. hours on the
rocks anxiously watching each boat as it ran the gauntlet.
While there I noticed a woman standing alone, a little
way from me, wringing her hands and weeping, and as
the roaring of the. water prevented her from hearing my
shout I went to her, but all that my questioning could
elicit was, “My husband ! my husband 1 ’’—pointing at
same time towards the rapids. I was imagining all sorts
of disasters, when she suddenly clasped my arm hard and
with wildly-staring eyes pointed to a solitary boat
approaching the fall. It was all over in a moment, and I
thought the woman would have gone mad with joy when
she saw the boat emerge safely from that chaos of water.
Laughing and crying in one breath, clapping her hands
and patting me on the shoulder—l confess that when she
hurried away towards the spot where the boat was trying
to land, I felt a lump in my throat which took many
swallows to gulp down.
Next “boat” to dare the leap was an extraordinary
structure—a mere raft of logs, cigar-shaped, with a sort
of turret in the centre, in which the provisions- were
stored. At the pointed end of the raft stood a man hold-
ing on to a pole from which a small American flag flut-
tered, and the man steering was dressed in a belltopper
and frock-coat, tails of which flapped gaily behind him,
while painted on the craft in big, black letters was her
name, “ The Holy Terror.” .
Near the rapids are many graves, some marked by
wooden slabs, telling who lies underneath; others with-
out rhyme or name. One grave was pointed out to me as
that of a man who, after losing outfit and boat at the
last fall, barely escaping with his life, returned to Skag-
way, obtained another outfit, and had another try, when
the boat again capsized, and he himself was rescued with
difficulty. After recovering a little, he borrowed a
revolver—and the slab at the head, of his grave is in-
scribed^“ Similia similibus cu/raritur.”
CHILCAT.
“ The election at Hythe, owing to retire-
ment of the sitting member, ” writes The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent, “was striking
evidence of the growing power of the Jew in
England. It was the first time a seat had Been
contested for by two openly - acknowledged
Hebrews. Sir Edward Sassoon, a long-eyed,
drooping-nosed, fragile, Conservative, Persian-
Bombay Jew, vanquished Sir Israel Hart, a
plump little Radical robin recbchqeked, nasal-y-
-hooked Petticoat-laner. Had either put his hand
over his nose and said, ‘ Vat bart of Ireland do I
come from ? ’ a child would have guessed it in one.
Oh, yes, they were Jews, and with enough shekels
to announce it on the platform to prevent mis-
takes. Sassoon married Baron Gus 'Rothschild’s
daughter, and Hart was married by a lady so
emblazoned with pods of pearls, searchlights of
diamonds, temperance-processions of turquoises,
and conflagrations of rubies that when she ‘ took
the chair’at his meetings the Folkestone voters
went blind—at the adjoining pub. In London
the Jew is now more over-powering and all-per-
vading than ever.”
Perhaps, outside Mt. Gambier, in the
S.E. of S.A., there isn’t an Australian town where
one stands in danger of being tossed out of the
roadway and over a fence by a stray stag. And
it doesn’t happen often even there. One lordly
creature, however, wandered in the other day, and
threw an elderly lady on top of her woodheap
He was, apparently, an escapee from Yallir.u
Park, where there is a large herd which is only
with difficulty kept within bounds.
John Wilkie, one of the three brothers
who made a mint of money out of W. A. railway
contracts, has been selected as Liberal candidate
for Patea against Geo. Hutchison. The latter
has had a varied political career. He has stood
against Atkinson, Bryce, Bruce (Tories), and Bal-
lance (Liberal), caused a hullaballoo against \V hit-
taker and other leading Conservatives over their
connection with the 8.N.Z., and was responsible
for some of the bitter attacks on Ward when he
succumbed with the Colonial Bank of N.Z. Was
challenged to a fight in the lobbies by John
M'Kenzie for his charges of nepotism against Big
John, and was partly suppressed by his own
leader, Russell, for his ridiculous allegation against
Seddon of being alias Bun Tuck. Hutchison a
copyist of Chamberlain, but cant manage the
monocle. Also, he is an unreliable political
friend and a very reliable enemy. When Reeves
was in the House of Reps, he was always told off
to reply to George, and their encounters-eontained
the best speeches M.L. Parliament has heard since
the days of its political giants.
When Ward and Reeves dropped out, and
the Maoriland Government was patched by the
addition of Thomas Thompson and Hyphenated
Hall-Jones, Seddon’s luck was distinctly out.
Thompson and Hyphenated Jones are, two utter
failures. Thompson broke his record of clumsi-
ness the other day. A deputation, headed; by
Opposition member Wilson, wanted something.
Thompson said it couldn’t be granted on account
of .an Act which he himself had carried through
only last session. Was asked name of Act, and
Thompson couldn’t remember. It was a ridiculpus
situation, and' the deputation looked surprised,
and the inflammable Thompson suddenly blazed
up and called the deputation a eub and other hard
names ; in fact, to all intents and purposes, he
offered to spank the deputation on the spot. It
begins to look as if Joseph Ward, of the Colonial
Bank disaster, who, it is printed, has paid his
Maoriland debts in full, and is paying of his
English ones, was about due to rejoin the Maori-
land Ministry. Buckley is dead, and Reeves is
in England, and the Thomas Thompson and
Hyphenated Jones element is weighing the
Government down.

Kidnev Disease £ Doan’s Dackache Kidney Fills.
"I
&& 3
73
Kidney Diseases do not prostrate a man the first day, possibly not the first year. They
are the most mysterious of all diseases. But, at the same time, as surely fatal as consump-
tion if neglected.
The first approaches of kidney disease are seldom painful. Slight dizziness, sleeplessness,
irregular heart, highly colored or scanty urine, are often disregarded or ascribed to some other
cause. These symptoms, and others, may even pass away, and the patient says to himself, “ I
am all right now.” This is a fatal mistake.
Soon the symptoms return, in a little stronger form, and last longer. Nature is giving
the patient plenty of warning. If he heeds these warnings in time he may save his life ; if
not, death is as certain as it would be had he taken arsenic or strychnine. Will the reader
have confidence in a medicine that’s made to cure kidney diseases ? That is curing them all
the time here in Sydney, and is always endorsed by Sydney people ? Is it not better to trust
the medicine that’s made for Kidney diseases, rather than boastful medicines that say “ I cure
everything, from consumption to measles ” ?
Bead the statement of a Sydney man:—
Mr. Dan. Symmons, of No. 1 Butt-street, Surry Hills, and formerly a well-known tobacconist of 696 George-street, Sydney,
has the following to say :—“ I have been suffering for the past eight years from pains in my back and kidneys, also from weakness
and giddiness. In consequence, I had to neglect my business, and sometimes have been confined to my bed. It was difficult for me
to walk any distance, and I could not do so without the aid of a stick. Even then I was often obliged to sit down and rest at intervals
from sheer weakness. During the period stated I visited several doctors, one of whom treated me for diabetes, and another for some-
thing else, and all to no effect. I felt well-nigh desperate, when Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were mentioned to me. I invested in
some, and bless my good fortune in having found a remedy which freed me from my terrible pain, and enabled me to move about
with perfect ease. To anyone afflicted as I was, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the best thing to take.”
The Kidneys are put into our bodies to filter the impurities and poisons out of the blood.
If they are sick, or unable to perform their work, the poisons stay in the blood, and are
carried back through the system.
Kidney trouble must be treated as a serious matter. It is serious, and every day that it is
neglected makes it just that much more so.
It is honor enough for one remedy that it can cure well and absolutely one class of diseases. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
do this with kidney disease, and that is why they are gaining ground so fast here in these colanies. If now or at any time the
reader have any kidney trouble, remember the medicine that’s made for the kidneys—DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS—
and be sure you get Doan’s.
DOAN S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS may be had of Chemists and Storekeepers generally throughout the Colonies ror 2s. 9d. per box, or six boxes for 15s. 3d. ;

In working this out let it still be your lay
To cultivate only the virtues that pay.
Such virtues are not of the workshop or cloister ;
They test every act by the way it pans out ;
They prompt you to seize on the world as your
oyster,
Inserting your knife with a spirit devout.
For strait is the portal, and narrow the way,
Representing the route of the virtues that pay.
Men as good as yourself, or most probably
better,

You must watch, you must prey, never missing a
collar —
The course is severe, and the company good.
You must rev’rence the Thrift-God, and earnestly
pray
To be grounded and built up in virtues that pay.
By this means you will serve the Almighty and
Mammon,
And die in a state of salvation and wealth ;
When the clergy, without a suggestion of gam-
mon,
Will furnish your soul with a clean bill of health.
So you’ll sweep through the gates in your spotless
array,
A shining example of Virtues that Pay.
Yic.
TOM COLLINS.
On Our Selection.—His Father.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mother and Dad talking at the barn. Mother,
bare-headed, holding some eggs in her apron.
Dad leaning on a hoe.
“ I am afraid of him,” Mother said ; “ it’s not
right you should keep him about the place. No
one’s safe with such a man. Some day he’ll take
it in his head to kill us all, and then ”
“Tut, tut, woman ; poor old Jack ! he’s harm-
less as a baby.”
“ All right ” (sullenly) ; “you’ll see.”
Dad laughed and went away with the hoe on his
shoulder to cut burr.
* * • *
Middle of summer. Dad and Dave in the pad-
dock mowing lucerne. “ Cranky ” Jack sinking
post-holes for a milking-yard close to the house.
Joe at intervals stealing behind him to prick him
with straws through a rent in the rear of his
patched moleskins. Little Bill—in readiness to
run—standing off, enjoying the sport.
Inside the house sat mother and Sal, sewing and
talking of Maloney’s new baby.
“Dear me,”said mother, “it’s the tiniest mite
of a thing I ever saw ; why, bless me, anyone of
y’ at its age would have made three of ”
“ Mind ! mother,” Sal shrieked, jumping up on
the sofa. Mother screamed and mounted the
table. Both gasped for breath, and leaning cauti-
ously over peeped down at a big black snake that
had glided in at the front door. Then, pale and
scared-looking, they stared across at each other.
The snake crawled over to the safe and drank
up some milk that had been spilt on the floor.
Mother saw its full length and groaned. The
snake wriggled to the leg of the table.
“ Look out ! ” cried Sal, gathering up her skirts
and dancing about on the sofa.
Mother squealed hysterically.
Joe appeared. He laughed.
“You wretch !” mother yelled. “Run!—rim and
fetch your father.”
Joe went and brought Jack.
“Oh-h, my God [’’—mother moaned, as Jack
stood at the door, staring strangely at her. “ Kill
it—why don’t he kill it ?”
Jack didn’t move, but talked to himself.
Mother shuddered.
The reptile crawled to the bedroom door. Then
for the first time the man’s eyes rested upon it.
It glided into the bedroom, and mother and Sal
ran off for Dad.
Jack fixed his eyes on the snake and continued
muttering to himself. Several times it made an
attempt to mount the dressing-table. Finally it
succeeded. Suddenly Jack’s demeanor changed.
He threw off his ragged hat and talked wildly. A
fearful expression filled his ugly features. His
voice altered.
“You’re the devil!” he said ;“ the devil! the
devil ! The missus brought you—ah-h-h ! ”
The snake’s head passed behind the looking-
glass. Jack drew nearer, clenching his fists and
gesticulating. As he did he came full before the
looking-glass and saw, perhaps for the first time in
his life, his own image. An unearthly howl came
from him. “M e father !” he shouted, and bolted
from the house.
Dad came in with the long-handled shovel,
swung it about the room, and smashed pieces off
the cradle, and tore the bed-curtains down, and
made a great noise altogether. Finally, he killed
the snake and put it on the fire ; and Joe and the
cat watched it wriggle on the hot coals.
Meanwhile Jack, bare-headed, rushed across the
yard. He ran over little Bill, and tumbled
through the wire-fence on to the broad of his back.
He roared like a wild beast, clutched at space, and
spat, and kicked his heels in the air.
“ Let me up —ah-h-h—let gome throat ! ” he
hissed.
The dog ran over and barked at him. He found
his feet again, and, making off, ran through the
wheat, glancing back over his shoulder as he tore
along. He crossed into the grass paddock, and
running to a big tree dodged round and round it.
I lien from tree to tree he went, and that evening
at sundown, when Joe was bringing the cows
home, Jack was still flying from “ his father.”
* * * *
After supper.
“ I wonder now what the old fool saw in that
snake to send him off his head like that ?” Dad
said, gazing wonderingly into the fire. “ He sees
Plenty of them, goodness knows.”
“That wasn’t it. It wasn’t the snake at all,”
mother said ; “ there was madness in the man’s
eyes all the while. I saw it the moment he came
to the door.” She appealed to Sal.
“ Nonsense !” said Dad ; “nonsense/” and he
tried to laugh.
t| “Oh, of course it’s nonsense,” mother went on,
everything I say is nonsense. It won’t be non-
sense when you come home some day and find us
all on the floor with our throats cut.”
“ Pshaw ! ” Dad answered ; “ what’s the use of
talking like that ? ” Then to Dave : “ Go out and
see if he’s in the barn.”
Dave fidgetted. He didn’t like the idea. Joe
giggled.
“Surely you’re not frightened ? ” Dad shouted.
Dave colored up.
“No—don’t think so,” he said; and, after a
pause, ‘ You go and see.”
It was Dad’s turn to feel uneasy. He pretended
to straighten the fire, and coughed several times.
Perhaps it’s just as well,” he said, “ to let him
be, to-night.”
Of course, Dad wasn’t afraid ; he said he wasn’t,
but he drove the pegs in the doors and windows
before going to bed that night.
* * « «
Next , morning, Dad said to Dave and Joe,
Come ’long, and we’ll see where he’s got to.”
In a gully at the back of the grass-paddock they
found him. He was ploughing—‘sitting astride
the highest limb of a fallen tree, and, in a hoarse
voice and strange, calling out—“ Gee, Captain—
come here, Tidy—wa-ay! ”
“ Blowed if I know ” —Dad muttered, coming
to a stand-still. “ Wonder if he is clean mad ? ”
Dave was speechless, and Joe began to tremble.
They listened. And as the man’s voice rang
out in the quiet gully and the echoes rumbled
round the ridge and the affrighted birds flew up,
a gloom fell over the place.
!- tj s no use kein’ afraid of him,” Dad went on.
’ We must go and bounce him, that’s all.” There
was a tremor, though, in Dad’s voice which Dave
didn’t like.
“See if he knows us, anyway”; and Dad
shouted, “Heigh!”
Jack looked up and immediately scrambled
from the limb. That was enough for Dave. He
turned and made tracks. So did Dad and Joe.
They ran. No one could have run harder. Terror
overcame Joe. He squealed and grabbed hold of
Dad’s shirt, which was ballooning in the wind.
“Let go!” Dad gasped. “ Danin y’, let me
go” —trying to shako hjm off. Rut Joe had great
faith in his parent, and clung to him closely.
When they had covered a hundred jmrds or so,
Dave glanced back, and seeing that Jack wasn’t
pursuing them, stopped and chuckled at the
others.
“Eh ? ” Dad said, completely winded —“ Eh ? ”
Then to Dave when he got some breath :
“Well you are an ass of a fellow. (Puff!)
What th’ devil did y’ run f’ ? ”
“ Wot did I run f’ ? Wot did you run f’ ? ”
“ Bah ! ” and Dad boldly led the way back.
“ Now look here (turning fiercely upon Joe) :
don’t you come catching hold of me again, or if y’
do I’ll knock y’r d head off. . . .• Clear home
altogether and get under the bed if y’r as frightened
as that.”
Joe slunk behind.
But when Dad did approach Jack, which
wasn’t until he had talked a great deal to him
across a big log, the latter didn’t show any desire
to take life, but allowed himself to be escorted
home and locked in the barn quietly enough.
Dad kept Jack confined in the barn several
days, and if anyone approached the door or the
cracks he would ask :
“ Is me father there yet ? ”
“ Your father’s dead and buried long ago, man,”
Dad used to tell him.
“Yes,” he would say, “but he’s alive again.
The missus keeps him in there ” —indicating the
house.
And sometimes when Dad was not about Joe
would put his mouth to a crack and say :
“Here’s y’r father, Jack!” Then, like a caged
beast, the man would howl and tramp up and
down, his eyes starting out of his head, while Joe
would bolt inside and tell mother that “Jack’s
getting out,” and nearly send her to her grave.
But one day Jack did get out, and, while mother
and Sal were ironing, came to the door with the
axe on his shoulder.
They dropped the irons and shrank into a
corner and cowered piteously too scared even
to cry out.
He took no notice of them, but, moving stealthily
on tip-toes, approached the bed-room door and
peeped in. He paused just a moment to grip the
axe with both hands. Then with a howl and a
bound he entered the room and shattered the
looking-glass into fragments.
He bent down and looked closely at the pieces.
“ He’s dead now,” he said calmly, and walked
out. Then he went to work at the post-holes again,
just as though nothing had happened.

about his private bathroom, and is seen impatient-

The Best Nerve Tonic
It cures nervousness, neuralgia, nervous
prostration, restlessness, sleeplessness, ner-
vous headache, nervous dyspepsia, and that
terrible feeling of utter prostration.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
1
A
During the past summer I became weak, nervous, and all run down. I
had little or no appetite and did not sleep at all well. I tried several so-called
tonics without obtaining any relief. At length I tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and
I have found it a sure restorer of energy, appetite, and strength to the body.
‘‘ I have surely proved that it aids digestion and helps the system to with-
stand the terrible heat of this climate.”
This strong testimony, with the above portrait, is from Mr. C. B. Berglm,
of 29 Blizabeth Street, Waterloo, New South Wales.
Of course there are other sarsaparillas; yet there is but one great Sarsapa-
rilla. It is “ Ayer’s,” the original sarsaparilla, the long-tried sarsaparilla, the
sarsaparilla that acts directly on the blood.
Its high standard of manufacture, and its multitude of astonishing cures
has given it the name of
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
It makes the nerves steady and the memory strong. It takes out the
poisons in the blood that cause your hard headache. It drives away nervous
prostration and gives you nerve nower.

Dear Sirs,—Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I de-
sire to add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating
cough, with much" expectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything
I have tried. It loosens the mucus, which, therefore, comes more readily away, and
the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
I remain, Yours respectfully,
THOMAS STOKES.
Always ask for BONNINGTON’S.
