The Red Page
“Saint Joan” and Blank Verse
Some months back I sent to the “Red
Page” some notes on Shaw’s “Saint Joan. ’
The present remarks are suggested by a
recent second visit to the New Theatre, where
that production, after an enormously success-
ful season, makes way for the appearance of
Matheson Lang in “The Hour and the Man.”
(J.B.S.’s latest work is a great play. 1
believe it is for all time, enjoying a greater
chance of survival than any of his previous
efforts, fine as many of them are. But it
lacks one thing, and that is blank verse. 1
am, of course, aware that Shaw has defi-
nitely decided against blank verse, not only
by his consistent avoidance of it in his pro-
ductions, but by express repudiation of it in
his “Better than Sliakspeare?” preface. But
I am convinced that all this modern revul-
sion from the sweet restraint the Eliza-
bethans found so acceptable is a mistake.
First of all, to examine the matter from a
negative standpoint, as it were, what is there
against blank verse? Is there some inherent
defect in it for dramatic purposes that
Sliakspeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben
•Tonson and the others missed, and that
Shaw, W. Somerset Maugham and our other
eminent moderns have surprisingly dis-
covered? Would “Hamlet,” “The "Alchem-
ist,” or even Massinger's “Virgin Martyr,”
where the measure limps like Shaw’s own
thorn-wounded lion in “Androcles,” be better
plays written throughout in prose? I think
that—with the quite probable exception of
the arch-rebel G.B.S. himself —there would be
few intransigent enough to make firm, open
avowal of such a doctrine. Yet that, after
all, is precisely the assumption underlying
the present-day enthusiastic cult of prose,
prose, never anything but prose, as a drama-
tic medium.
It is a difficult matter to confine the men-
tion of Shakspeare’s name to within manage-
able limits in this business, and quite impos-
sible to keep it out altogether. I am not lacking
in sympathy with Rupert Brooke’s protest
against the Shakspeare-worship with which
criticism is tainted. At the same time, it
must be admitted by every sane mind that
Sliakspeare does stand as a type and emblem
of all that is best in our drama. As Coleridge
was so fond of insisting, not the least remark-
able side of Shakspeare’s genius is his excel-
lent judgment—his extraordinarily good
commonsense, if you like—in all matters
appertaining to the art of the playwright.
So the argument conies to a head. If un-
suitability for swift, circumstantial plot-
treatment (comprising both the “complica-
tion” and “development” of Aristotle), for
the portrayal of the subtleties of individual
character, for the natural reaction of person
upon person, for the exercise of wit, humor,
pathos or any other element; if any of these
or similar grounds be urged, as they have at
times in all good faith by some critics been
urged, against the employment of blank verse
in works intended for the theatre, then the
confuting instance of Shakspeare’s practice
and achievement arises and supplies a con-
vincing answer to each and every one of
them. If, moreover, the evidence afforded by
the creed of the greatest dramatist in our
language be thought not strong enough un-
aided to establish the proposition, there
flocks to his banner a splendid army—Ben
Jouson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster.
Massinger, Ileywood, Dekker and a host of
others, through Dryden. to Shelley, whose
“Cenci,” by the way, scarcely meets with the
recognition due to its worth as a play pure
and simple.
“Oh, yes,” I hear the advocate of present-
day methods good-humoredly objecting, “that
all sounds very plausible, no doubt; but you
have gracefully glided over the whole ques-
tion of one of the chief merits of prose. The
modern emancipation from the shackles of
hard and fast rhythm in dramatic dialogue
has for its primary purpose the achieving of
a natural form of speaking. Richard 111.
did not speak in blank verse; nor did Joan of
Arc; nor does the actual individual of to-day,
whose life, or part of whose life, we attempt
to reproduce on the stage of a theatre. The
employment of prose is an important means
of obtaining realism. We want to hear people
in a play talk as they really do talk in every-
day life, not in accordance with an absurd
convention, whose acceptance has so long been
the result merely of an effete tradition.” We
wish to hear characters on the stage speak
as they do in everyday life, do we? I utterly
refuse to believe it. We desire, certainly, to
hear the personages of a play express them-
selves in a manner compatible with their
characters, as those are unfolded for us, in
•their actions and sayings. We do not expect
to hear an uneducated crossing-sweeper quot-
ing Horace in the original, or a moron mani-
festing a deep insight into the significance
of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. That, how-
ever, is an entirely different matter from
hearing them, or any other characters,
occupying the stage with the all-too-familiar
dulness of ordinary speech. We wish, in a
play, to find the personalities the author has
created for us using a language which, while
appropriate to their station in life and to
their personal character, is elevated by the
playwright’s art, beyond the level of what
they might actually say, to the height of
what, in the given circumstances, we would
expect them to say. Dialogue is a lovely
thing (Wilde says in “Intentions” it is the
most magnificent of all media) ; and must
we sacrifice, for the imagined advantage' of
hearing sentences we - can listen to any and
every day, at the table, in a barber’s shop or
in the street, all the beautiful possibilities of
this pleasure of rhythmical speech, which is
one of the choice attributes of the drama?
Why, even the newspaper reporter, who sets
forth for his readers the prosaic recital of a
politician’s election-speech, knows better than
to present it intact with its “ahems,” its
irritating starts on sentences that are never
completed, and its tangled diction—things
which are passed over, more or less unnoted,
in the inartistic carelessness of our ordinary
listening!
Moreover, it is an easy matter to point
out that this kind of pursuit of so-called
realism fails, and always must fail, on the
stage. Even if we did want such stale real-
ism. and not, as is actually the case, an
illusion of realism, we could never hope to
achieve it. Take one case, that of the
soliloquy. Maeterlinck, in a note to one of
his own plays, has given directions for its
shortening, by the omission of certain indi-
cated portions, if a desire be felt to avoid
“tedious passages.” lie mentions, as an
example of the type of thing which may be
considered superfluous, Hamlet's “To be, or
not to be,” which is surely as foolish a piece
of dramatic criticism as there is on record.
For who is there who needs even a moment's
thought to realise that this “tedious passage"
is of the most immediate importance and
strictest relevance as an intimate revelation
of the Dane’s brooding character, that very
phase of his psychological complex which,
making him ever the dreamer and dilatory
in decisive, action, provides the whole
material for the play? Now apply this test
of the abbreviated soliloquy to the work of
the modern playwrights. I tremble to think
where, for instance, Shaw’s “Man and Super-
man” would be without the interminable,
delightful musings of his Satanic majesty.
What would become of countless other pass-
ages, this time in dialogue, if they were re-
duced to “realistic” proportions?—for the
number of Heaven’s elect who can reel off
500 reasonably logical and lucid words with-
out pause or error is pitiably few in this our
humdrum world.
Then “Richard 111., King of England, did
not speak in blank verse”. . .. No, nor was
Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl, wont
to converse with the Archbishop of Rlieims
in English prose. In short, the drama, like
any other art, has its numerous legitimate
conventions, without which, indeed, it were
no art at all. Of these traditional privileges,
in English drama, the use of blank verse is
one with which we can least afford to part.
The foregoing remarks have all dealt with
the negative aspect of the question, examin-
ing reasons advanced to show why blank
verse should not be employed in the drama.
They have already extended to such length
as to preclude consideration of the positive
side, the many excellent reasons to be urged
in favor of its use. On that enticing sub-
ject reams might be written. Perhaps, how-
ever, it will be sufficient simply to point to
the inexhaustible treasures bequeathed to us
by the Elizabethan dramatists, who revelled
in rhythm, and, leaving the argument at that,
hope that, to quote, with a shade of differ-
ence of meaning from the original, the words
of Longinus in his “Treatise on the Sub-
lime,” “it comes to pass that a bare thought
without words challenges admiration for the
sake of its grandeur alone.”
RICHARD MEREDITH.
A Convention in the Yosemite
To such a fine point has the Art of Con
volitions been carried in America that i
would not surprise me to find some energetic
university founding a chair on the subject
for the Americans have long realised tha
one of the chief pleasures of the middle-agec
and the elderly lies in attending these meet
ings. A certain amount of useful work is
done, the fate of to-day and the fears fox
to-morrow are discussed, and —this is im
portant—all the middle-aged and elderly
consciences are at peace; but the wore
‘ Convention” also covers a multitude of plea
sant social doings, carefully arranged out of
business hours.
Sometimes the Americans translate tin
word into a democratic rendering of our
Royal Command : such is the case with the
State Convention of I’rincipals of the High
Schools of California. The convention lasts
a week, attendance is compulsory and the
State pays all expenses.
Last year the convention was held at
Camp Curry, in the Yosemite Valley, in ideal
circumstances. Camp Curry is a noted con-
vention centre, so large that several conven-
tions; can go on simultaneously without get-
ting in each other's way and without inter-
fering with the comfort of other guests at
the camp. My husband and I were invited
to attend the convention, and he was asked
to give an address dealing with education
from the English point of view. In our
case extremely little compulsion had to be
used.
The Scout Masters of California were con-
vening at Camp Curry, too, but they kept
aioot, sleeping in tents at The Happy Isles,
cooking their own food, and only coming to
the camp for the real work of their conven-
tion ; gallant specimens of young America.
But, to my surprise, the Principals in
some cases appeared in as fancy dress as did
the legitimately-picturesque Scout Masters,
lo be sure, they arrived in the unobtrusive,
and almost standardised, American man’s
business suit. (By the way, a tailor’s ad-
vertisement in San Francisco is interesting
He offers “The Double Life Suit,” which’
in the land of the film, suggests sensation.
The explanation, however, is calming. “Two
prs. pants double suit’s life,” he remarks.)
Many of the Principals shed their placid
business suits at once, and reappeared in
sombreros, in sweaters, in riding-breeches, in
flannels, in their shirt-sleeves, and, in a few
cases, up to breakfast-time, in running-shorts
and singlets. Indeed, with the women—not
necessarily connected with any convention—
nearly all wearing knickerbockers and flan-
nel shirts, or in riding kit, with all the
American men wearing ’most anything, and
with a few elegant Europeans en route from
Honolulu and Japan fastidiously clad in
shantung suits and solar topees, the crowd
round the camp-fire looked like some won-
derful mediiaeval fair. Chesterton, with
'lour caps that cry for a feather,” would
have approved.
We all stayed in bungalows for two or
tour people, with electrically-heated water
m our bathrooms, and girls, with hand-
carts full of clean linen, and with a clever
contrivance for brushes and dusters, made
their orderly morning rounds, giving every-
body “full hotel service.” The life of the
hotel-village centered in the main buildings
where the lounge, the post-office and the

Nature herself has made Shell

than any other Motor Spirit in the World.
And the vast Shell organisation is the Master
Key which has unlocked these superior forces
of Nature for the use of every Motorist.

central dining-room are. The service of
the camp is all done by students, who put m
an eight-hours’ day, six days weekly, m re-
turn for board and lodging, a moderate salary
and the chance of living in the most wonder-
ful air and scenery. The nice boy who car-
ried our “grips” was a law student at Los
Angeles, and the pretty girl in the pink
gingham dress —technically a Sassy Jane
frock —told my professor, with genuine
friendliness, as she waited on us at table,
how much she was looking forward to being
in his class at Berkeley later on.
The convention was interesting. In scope
it ranged from a well-expressed address on
“Platoon System of High School Attend-
ance,” b.v a dignified Principal, to a whist-
ling solo, at 9 o’clock one morning, by the
wife of the chairman of the Southern Cali-
fornia Educational Association. There was
a good deal of singing scattered through the
conference hours, “Poor Black Joe” being
sung several times with great solemnity. In
California that song is a subsidiary national
anthem.
A stately woman,' principal of a co-educa-
tional high school of 2709 pupils, told us
with quiet pride that all connected with her
school enlisted for the war in Europe, and
that not one eligible “old boy” waited till
the draft came to fetch him. Many of the
Principals had been at the war, judging from
the relics of uniform they were wearing. It
struck me that they were an unusually tall
set of men, and younger than our English
headmasters. In America the worth-while
men get the chance of winning tlieir spurs
soon. In their talk they showed an intimate
knowledge of “hunting,” as they call ordi-
nary rough-shooting, and of fishing. Nearly
every one of the 350 of them owns a car.
Many of them came by automobile, often
accompanied by their wives, but in no case
by any child of school age. A good example
has to be set by those in authority.
Every evening at. Glacier Point, a moun-
tain high above the camp, a huge bonfire
is lit. At the end of the concert, held round
the camp bonfire, the Stentor calls his greet-
ings from the camp to the man in charge
of the mountain bonfire, who answers, and
then sweeps the whole of his high blazing
pile off the jutting rock into space. It
falls, a wide, long cataract of flame, down
the bare granite rocks, a startling
sight to the uninitiated. It is the last spec-
tacle of a long day, and is regarded as the
curfew bell of the camp.
There were two English visitors there in
whom the sight of fire falling from the air
awoke sinister memories.

Saul was not a born seeker. He was driven
forth to seek definite objects by his father's
commands. The born seeker is driven forth
to seek indefinite objects by some imperative
command that comes from within. He goes
forth to seek a kingdom and finds a world
of asses. He seeks the ideal; he always finds
the real. Then he begins again. He rushes
here, there, everywhere, always driven by
an all-consuming enthusiasm, a real Prome-
thean fire that rages within. There is, and
will be, no rest for him while there is life
in him. He is like a thirsting man with a
magic orange with infinite skins. He has
only to remove the skin to quench his thirst;
he removes the skin, and finds —another
skin. The born seeker everywhere sees sug-
gestions of what should be. He rushes off
in vain endeavor to catch what should be.
And ever, like the mystic blue bird, it flies
off and leaves in his hands—what is.
D. 11. Lawrence, author of “Kangaroo,”
“The Boy in the Bush,” “Sons and Lovers”
is a born seeker. In “The Boy in the Bush”
he writes what might serve as a key-sentence
to all his works. “This is the Fata Morgana
of Liberty, of Freedom. She may lead you
very definitely away from to-day's
prison. But she very definitely leads
you towards some other prison. Liberty
is a changing of prisons to people
who seek only liberty.” Having defined
liberty, being a born seeker, off lie rushes
again to seek —liberty. Lawrence would be-
come a religious fanatic if he could find a
religious form to believe in. He would be a
socialist if he could find a practical socialism
to believe in. But he must seek under all
beliefs, and they will not stand. So he has
no beliefs to cling to, nothing to keep him
from falling if he does not move, so he must
be always moving.
August Strindberg was a born seeker, lie
sought in art, in literature, in physics, in
chemistry. He had a colossal knowledge of
all these things. When he was not seeking
the ultimate symbol in them he was seeking
the ideal in woman. If lie had sought the
real woman, possibly lie would not have been
the woman-hater he became. He sought the
ideal woman, and found everywhere women
ready to play the part of the woman of liis
dreams. That is a game that certain women
are very adept .at, and very fond of playing.
But the time surely conies to them when
they weary of the game, or perhaps it is that
another man arrives on the scene looking
for another ideal woman. Desire coming
to try the new part, all that they have put
on for the first man they throw off, and lie
sees them as they are. Then a Strindberg
becomes for a time almost insanely angry.
But lie should not. The women have not
deceived and fooled him nearly as much as
he has deceived and fooled himself. He has
been deceived, but it was only because he
wanted to be deceived. Soon he is off again
seeking still for the ideal woman in some
• other woman. The sought is still beyond.
The great symbolic seeker of the literary
world is Don Quixote. Generous, proud,
heroic, he sought everywhere the ideal and
found everywhere the real. He sought a
world of heroes and heroines, and found
only a world of men and women ready co
play, for his benefit and their own ultimate
advantage, the parts of heroes and heroines.
Because he wanted to be deceived they
helped to deceive him, but in the end some-
thing would always cause them to throw
aside their play-acting and reveal to him
what they were. But that only mattered for
a little while. He would mount his Rosin-
ante again and take his lance, and. unhappy
but dauntless, would ride forth to new adven-
tures, with his Dulcinea, still the loveliest
lady in the land, somewhere beyond.
The born seeker has vision. He can see
further than ordinary men. So he sees
be’auty they cannot see. Also he sees ugliness
they cannot see. To him everything is beauti-
ful or ugly, to be fought for or fought
against. There can be no compromise, and
never for a moment can he accept the ordi-
nary man’s complacent view of things. -V
man like Lawrence sees beauty suggested
everywhere, and he sees everywhere ugli-
ness accepted by man. The world that is
maddens him dreaming of the world that
might be. He seeks here, he seeks there,
for the people who, like himself, want the
world that might be. And he finds every-
where people never looking beyond their
fellow people and to-day’s aims—complacent,
compromising everywhere; everywhere, com-
pared with the beauty that all nature sug-
gests, unbeautiful, ugly.
The born seeker is never very popular
in the world of men. He is too restless, too
critical, too disturbing. The world of men
only wants to be left alone. It does not want
to be led into new W’orlds. The seeker is
an awakener, and the world of men does not
want to be awakened. When it is thoroughly
awakened, it is often only then grateful to
the seeker. Thomas Hardy says of great
men that they are like meteors that consume
themselves to" light the earth. Great seekers
are necessarily great men. They seek truth
and find what truth is not, never what truth
is. But they must go on still seeking truth,
and lighting for after-coming men the way
they go. All they know is that truth is beauti-
ful and that truth is somewhere—somewhere
where neither they nor other men have yet
been. Ever they must seek that “some-
where.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
Dave and Rod. and the Rest
Both the fortunate individual who snatches
his Bulletin (still damp and odorous of
ink)' from a newsboy near Circular Quay,
and unfortunates like myself who sit for
an hour in the shade of an old blue-gum
awaiting the coming of the mailman with his
packhorse and a Bulletin a week old,
eagerly open our papers and scan them to
ascertain what fare the editor has placed on
our literary menu. And, scanning thus, we
find many familiar names; and of them all
those of David McKee Wright and Itoderic
Quinn are most intimate. But every week
or two we find a strange name appended,
usually to a set of verses on the “Abo.” pages.
Not very good verses, perhaps, but always
verses hinting of the glamor, the freedom, the
kindliness of a wide, sun-kist land; always
verses that waken poignant memories in the
hearts of those who have known and loved
the bushland; always verses that, though
their rhythm may cause a Wright or a Quinn
to raise scandalised hands, have in them the
beat of galloping hoofs, or the cadences of
a clean, unhampered wind.
I know nothing of the methods of verse-
construction employed by our “major poets.”
I always think of David McKee Wright
strolling into his library and saying to a
maid-servant: “Close the doors and windows.
I am going to write several sonnets on sev-
eral subjects this morning, and must not
be disturbed.” And of Rod. Quinn, ivith a
pint-pot of good ale at his elbow, gazing out
of the bar-window of a liarborside hotel, joy-
ously scribbling verses that have the salt
tang of restless waters. (I may be doing an
injustice there. It may be David who has
the pintpot and Rod. who has the maid-
servant. Was not some lady writer recently
lamenting the fact that we of the bush knew
not the habits of the literati of Australia?
It certainly is lamentable. We should know
whether Zora Cross is addicted to silk under-
clothes and other absorbing items of a like
nature.) But the bush bard —ah, Ido know
his methods! Some day, as he pulls a cross-
cut saw through a pine log in the coastal
scrubs, or tails a mob of weary weaners
along a western track, a line or two comes
a-singing in his brain, and the germ of an
idea is born. Slowly, sometimes it may be
a process of weeks, verses seem to frame
themselves. A line or two here or there
may be elusive, but it surely comes; mayhap
when he is sitting at the galley fire some
star-gloried night awaiting the cooking of
the salt-beef that bubbles in the kerosene-
tin, or while he lies sleepless on his bunk,
the midnight silence disturbed only by the
curlew’s wail or the nocturnal meanderings
of a kangaroo-rat. So, slowly, the whole
song sings itself into his mind, a mind that
knows nothing of dactyl, or trochee or the
other mechanics of versecraft.
And perhaps it is because of his lack of
knowledge of the laws of poetry, because his
lines are born out of the memories of a glori-
ous gallop or of a lass loved and afar, or
out of a nostalgia, heart-wearying and exqui-
site, or out of a hundred sensations that we
too have known, perhaps because his lines
come to him unbidden and liltingly, that a
goodly crowd of us find a livelier pleasure in
his verses than in the thoughtful poems of
a strictly metrical David, and the neat, cor-
rect lines of an impeccable Rod.
G. A. L.
Chocolate-box Beauty
When I was 10 my portrait was painted
by an artist with a wider range than any
of the three Australian L’s —Longstaff, Lam-
bert and Lindsay. The artist’s name was
McTavish, and he “painted my fortagraff”
in intervals won from coloring my father’s
fences and my mother’s bush-liouses in the
Bendigo where I was born. He did face and
fences with the same brushes. I recall tell-
ing him anxiously: “McTavish, just look at
my skin—like satin! Not a bit like the
trellis of the bush-houses! And my hair —
oh, do get some softer brushes and some gold
paint.” To which McTavish replied: “Oh,
ay. I’m no Satan’s painter. Even if ye are
like a chocolate-box image, I’m no’ goin’ to
paint ye as sic.” That was years ago, but
in the interval between Then and Now I
always experience a sensation of having my
mental fur rubbed the wrong way when a
critic hits a portrait with a chocolate box.
It suggests that he is badly-equipped with
adequate weapons of legitimate criticism.
Some years ago Mr. Arthur Adams, discuss-
ing an art-sliow then being held in Sydney,
wrote of Eve Grey’s portrait: “Mr. Longstaff
has done the best he could with his chocolate-
box subject.” And in The Bulletin of
Nov. 20appears this: “His [Frank Clarke’s]
claim that John Longstaff had no superior
anywhere as a portrait-painter was received
with incredulity by those whose acquaint-
ance with his work began with the brace of
chocolate-box beauties on the south wall, and
who had not seen his fine portrait of Dr.
John McFarland.” Are youth and beauty
to be kept out of portraiture be-
cause the subject has no lines of “char-
acter” on her dial or a chin that
could stop a charging bull? I haven’t
seen the brace of beauties on the srtutli wall
or the portrait of Dr. McFarland, but what
I should like to be told is: What is wrong
with the technique, coloring, likeness, etc.,
of the chocolate-box beauties? If they were
feminine prototypes of Dr. McFarland, would
their portraits be masterpieces? Is thero
anything wrong with them save their youth
and beauty? Another view: Some chocolate-
box pictures are absolute works of art. And
yet another: Why speak contemptuously of
the dawn because it is not noon ? Go to!
I'm beginning to understand why Mr. Lam-
bert never paints a portrait of a young and
beautiful woman. Of if he does he contrives
• —with masterly art —that his subject shall
never be accused of chocolate-box beauty.
ETHEL KATER.
A Satchel of Books
Young Mrs. Cruse, by Viola Meynell (Edward
Arnold). Short stories, all of which with one excep-
tion deal with domestic subjects in urban and rural
England. Pleasantly, though sometimes discursively,
told.
This Above All , by A. St. John Adcock (Harrap).
One of the six prize novels in the publisher’s compe-
tition. The author is known by his previous work,
“The Man Who Lived Alone,” and the present one
has the same characteristic of a breezy style that
carries the reader along with it.
Mod-beggar, by Lawrence W. Meynell (Harrap).
One of the six successful novels in the Harrap
competition. The outstanding figure in the book is
Rachel Massinger, and most of its interest centres
on, among a host of lovers, a specially favored three.
It is in the portrayal of character that the author
depends for success. The book is sprinkled with epi-
grams of varying merit.
“What is Truthf” by Gabriel Wells (Helnemann).
The author of this little book writes letters to the
papers. He is probably the first of the clan lo
published his incubations in book-form. His first was
written in New York in 1903, about 81 years after
his first acquaintance with the English language,
and since then he has written on everything, from
Prohibition to the Dawes Plan. His English is
pure, his condensation marvellous, and his political
wisdom and prescience such that if any of the
newspapers to which he wrote had published his
letters in their leader columns they would have
gained an Unexampled reputation for sagacity and
lost most of their circulation.
The Old Ladies, by Hugh Walpole (Macmillan).
It is not a cheerful book, though here and there the
sunlight breaks through its shutters —but it is a
very earnest, a very real book in which paint and
powder are rubbed off the face of life. Hugh Walpole
never shirks the issue. Whatever the problem of
life he places before us he carries it to its inevitable
conclusion, asking neither for the reader’s tears nor
his laughter. In the present novel he places before us
the picture of three lives, those of Lucy Amorest,
May Beringer and Agatha Payne, women of the age
of 70 or thereabout, and each representing a distinct
type. They live together on “a windy, creaky, rain-
bitten dwelling-place. Mrs. Amorest and Mrs. Payne
were wonderfully strong women for their age, but
Miss Beringer felt her back a good deal.” Very
human, and worth a cartload of the jazz fiction that
loads the bookstalls.
Old English Sporting Hooks, by Ralph Nevill (“The
Studio,” London). The first English sporting book
was written in the reign of Henry IV. by a iady of
noble birth, the Prioress of Sopwell Nunnery, in
Hertfordshire, who beguiled her hours of leisure by
writing her youthful experiences of sport, especially
angling, in which for religious purposes she still
indulged. It was not, however, until about a
hundred years ago that the vogue of sporting books
began. It was a brutal age, and among the recrea-
tions enumerated as suitable for a gentleman were
cock-fighting, bull- and bear-baiting, and the assault-
ing of night-watchmen. Some of these old books
made fortunes for their authors and were dramatised
.in England and America. They were dashing chron-
icles of the times, and were illustrated by such
delightful masters as Henry Aiken, the two Cruik-
shanks and John Leech: the cold eye of the camera
is good enough to record the milder relaxations of
our day. In this collection, elegantly assembled by
The Studio, are reproduced over 100 of the prints
that ravished the eyes of our forefathers.
The Loughsiders, by Shan F. Bullock (Harrap). Mr.
Bullock is one of that little group of writers who of
late years have done so much to bring about renewed
interest in Irish literature. His “Loughsiders” is a
study, through fictional characters, of the Protestant
Irish, showing us their customs, traditions, modes of
thought and spiritual character. The Northerner
does not here stalk a soulless lay-figure trailing a
string of gibberish behind him, but lives and speaks
as the man himself. His language is idiomatic. The
outstanding character is Richard Jebb, a true-blooded
loughsider, with all their “inborn canniness of mind
and nature, their awful reticences implanted deep as
their creed itself.” The story is cast in “the days
before the troubles. It is purely domestic;
all its adventure lies within stone-cast of
Richard’s own cottage, near the home where
old Mary Harper on days when it was “grand
and warm” sat knitting socks of coarse brown wool,
and the farmhouse of Harry Nelson. Nelson is a
farmer with a genius for what is always difficult in
“old Ireland,” making the farm pay. Jebb, a
bachelor with a small area of poor land, lets covetous
eyes rest on his neighbor’s fields with their richer
soil. Nelson dies leaving a widow, Mary ; a daughter,
Rachel; and two sons, Sam and Jim. Gradually the
family drifts into debt and muddle. All the interest
of the story then concentrates on Richard Jebb. With
admirable skill the author develops a character com-
plex in its interwoven good and evil. Jebb schemes
to gather, under cover of disinterested friendship, the
drifting Nelsons into his net. Yet it is not all cold,
calculating self-gain. Whilst following an unswerving
under-line of personal interest, he so plans it
all that in the event, when he has accomplished his
end, the reader will probably agree that he has also
disposed of the fortunes of the folk he has ousted
to their gain rather than to their loss, they being such
as they were. As a character study, the book is
excellent ; and keen insight and genial sympathy are
conveyed by a pen that writes incisively and with a
fine sense of restrained humor and satire.
Cronulla, by Vance Palmer (Cornstalk Publishing
Co.)- “Cronulla” has nothing to do with the surfing
resort outside Sydney, but was the name of a cattle
station owned by Stephen Buckley, who belonged 1o
the old school of bushmen. Unfortunately it was in
the dry country, and, though it carried 5000 cattle,
the owner, generous handed and big hearted, was
unable to carry it through a succession of drought
years. The property was purchased by a neighbor,
Harding, who had a fund of driving energy and a
good business head which made the base of a character
that otherwise had little to commend it. The plot
turns on Harding’s scheme to win Madge Buckley, her
father’s only daughter, a typical Australian character,
open-hearted, independent. Her affections are given
to Alec Graham, a friend from childhood. Old
Buckley dies, and the girl is left protected only by
her brother Will. In the end, Harding’s net to
surround her is broken and the young lovers are
united. The story carries the reader on from the
first page to the last in the thrall of an interesting
plot through scenes that are genuinely Australian.
And it is published, and excellently produced, by
an Australian firm.

POWERFUL STURDY KEROSENE TRACTORS

The true test of a Tractor is not in the results it gives in a so-called “field demonstration” of
short duration, but in its endurance and continued satisfaction to owners under practical working
conditions on the farm.
In this respect the HART-PARR Tractor Stands Alone
These Owners Speak for the HART-PARR
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Marchagee, W.A.
1 Bth July, 1924.
To Malloch Bros.
In answer to your inquiry for particulars
of work done by my "Hart Parr” Tractor,
15/30, purchased 21st February, 1923,
I have pleasure in stating that my Tractor
is giving perfect satisfaction, and I sin-
cerely claim that she has ploughed over
1 000 acres of land, besides all belt work
and haulages on the place, and at present
is scrub rolling in heavy scrub land. To
date the Tractor has cost me 7/6 for
spares, which, no doubt, you already
know, as spare parts are not purchased
from anywhere but your firm for “Hart-
Parr” Tractors.
I highly recommend her for scrub-roll-
ing. I can roll 20 acres per day with a
7ft. 6in. roller, costing about 2/- per acre
for kerosene and lubricating oil. My costs
for ploughing in stiff gimlet and salmon
country are 3/7 per acre for kerosene,
lubricating oil and grease, including labor.
With regard to delay in work: as I have
had no breakages, I have had no stop-
pages, nor have I had occasion to call for
your expert. I have cleaned the engine
out twice, and on neither occasion have 1
obtained one ounce of carbon, and I claim
my compression is as good as the day 1
purchased the Tractor.
I have ploughed with the Tractor after
sundown, and have done as much work
before midnight as the horses would do
in a full day. lam still using the original
pinions and bull gears, and these will
easily do another 500 acres of ploughing.
I do not recommend overloading a Trac-
tor in heavy, stiff ground. I find a 6-
furrow mouldboard is the most profitable
load to pull. In lighter ground, of course,
I can pull up to 10 furrows.
(Signed) F. R. BRYANT.

Dear Sirs,
My opinion about the Hart-Parr is that
it has proved itself absolutely satisfactory
with all work done. The Tractor worked
throughout the harvest without a hitch,
and I feel sure that it would have pulled
a 12 ft. header without trouble. In my
opinion, the life of the engine will be long
with reasonable treatment.
Yours faithfully,
R. JOB.
With his Hart-Parr Mr. Job put up a
World’s Harvesting Record during last
harvest by taking off 302 bags off 30
acres with an Bft. header in one day. With
this Tractor Mr. Job took off the whole of
his harvest, 3700 bags, from 530 acres,
in a little over four weeks, during which
time the Tractor was also used for chaff-
cutting and sawing.
QUEENSLAND.
What the HART-PARR can do is
clearly stated by Mr. John Kalians:—
I hauled 560 tons of cane on portable
rails, and find the Hart-Parr just the Trac-
tor for this job. The grades on my farm
range 1 in 12 to 1 in 9. I have let down
four loaded trucks on the 1 in 9 grade,
and have pulled as many as five loaded
trucks up the same grade. I have 83
chains of portable rails, and have trucked
out 40 trucks of cane in seven hours. 1
had four hills to climb, making eight dif-
ferent grades. The time was taken from
when I coupled on to the empties to bring
them into the paddock until I had the last
of the 40 ready for the mill loco. I had
only one man and myself on this job, and
the fuel consumption when trucking out
was eight gallons of kerosene per day. 1
have pulled 40 full trucks on the level. To
do the same work with horses it would
need two teams of three horses pulling up
the hills, and one team letting down, and
two men to each team, to do 40 trucks in
1 2 hours.

Extract from “Farm Implement News,”
Chicago, of the 28th August, 1924:
Tractor Works Twenty-three Years.
In the Pittsburgh-plus report farm trac-
tors were given a life of four years. There
is one on exhibition at the lowa State Fair
this week that has just been retired after
a service of twenty-three years. It might
have been continued in operation longer,
but the manufacturers wanted it returned
on account of its historical value, for it
was the third machine produced in their
plant.
The Tractor in question is a Hart-Parr,
and is now known as Old No. 3. It was
one of fifteen tractors shipped from the
Hart-Parr plant at Charles City, la., in the
Spring of 1901. It was bought by a
farmer near Charles City, one George
Mitchell, who has owned and operated it
every season since he obtained it. Last
month it was bought back by the Hart-
Parr Co.
Old No. 3, after showing off at Des
Moines this week, will be sent to the Min-
nesota Fair, to be held next week. Then
it will be shipped back to Charles City,
where it will form a portion of the Hart-
Parr historical exhibit, showing the devel-
opment of farm power.
Before buying a Tractor, Investigate the HART-PARR,
then you will buy a HART-PARR.

A Prayer to Santa Claus.
“There is no Santa Claus, ’ I heard them say.
Their voices argued, but without distress
The desert grieves not for its barrenness-.
And these, the old-young children at their
Were wise’to things, their mothers said and
Proud o? the’ knowledge of the modern child.
No Santa Claus, of patron saints the best!
No tinkling bells, no sleigh of fairy power
To ride the roof-tops at the midnight hour
With bulging sack of all dear things
possessed—
Brown teddy-bears awaiting an embrace.
And dolls with wonder-laden eyes and lace!
But I believe in Santa. Come for me.
Years have not robbed me of a childish
heart; .
And that brave faith that is the dreamer 3
part
Still sings with the eternal ecstasy
Of fine-spun fancies and the delicate
Beauty of their imperishable state.
See! Here’s my stocking hanging by a pin!
My heart is beating with the strangest
thrill ,
Within the gloom so rapturously still.
My stocking’s empty, darned, and worn, and
thin;
Stuff it, dear Santa, while I feign to sleep,
With all the dreams and loveliness you keep.
The chimney’s open and the curtain's drawn.
(Things are most real that have never been
And sights most vivid I have never seenO
Drive your light sleigh across the arch oi
dawn — .
Your brother saints rest well in Heaven
above, ,
But we have need on earth of Santas love.

The Bad Little Girl.
Marie-Jean! Marie-Jean!
Out in the clover cool
She plays on Sunday afternoon,
When good little girls are in Sunday-school!
She builds a house in the shivery grass,
With a roof of rose-red sheaves;
She laughs as the fat bees pass and pass
And calls to the blue wren high in the leaves.
She flicks a root or a shining shoot,
AYliere a yellow spider weaves.
Marie-Jean ! Marie-Jean !
The sun has rouged her face;
Her hair flows ivild o’er her torn pink
dress,
Rut she flings it back with a childish grace.
She laughs aloud when the organ booms
To thundering sound that dies.
It shakes her house, with its gold-lace
rooms,
Where dreaming dreams to herself she lies;
But the voices ring as the children sing
Of mansions in the skies!
Marie-Jean! O Marie-Jean!
I had rather be with you
Out in the grass when the sun is hot
And the clouds are white in a -world of blue!
The sad-eyed Christ on a sorrowing way,
The saints in their painted pain
Are not so true as the short, sweet day!
And I think that God when Ilis grief seems
vain
Must softly pass o’er the shivery grass
And hide in your house of leaves!

Yesterday.
Yesterday I walked again
Down the quiet leafy lane
That nestles in the valley’s breast
And whispers “Rest.”
Red berries on the trees were out;
And on the grey, disordered rout
Of wildwood hedge the birds were few.
They sang, “Ah, rue; ah, rue!”
The rivulet went laughing by,
The bluest thing beneath the sky,
Along its bed of golden sand.
I saw the sword-reeds stand.
I lay upon a bed of grass
And watched the great clouds slowly pass.
I thought of men at -work and play,
And life and death all yesterday.

Waking.
The gentle rush of morning, as it comes
Rustling with soft sweet laughter in the
trees,
Has crept into my dreams. Its finger drums
Upon my pane; and, as from death reborn,
With waking mind I see the smile of morn.
A hundred visions with that first gleam wake
Of fragrant gardens kissed by early light,
Far-sweeping beaches where the young waves
break,
Rich lawny slopes where day’s feet lightly
pass
And white and yellow flowers in the grass.
And it is flooded full with waking song:
Each rustling tree holds its own cheerful
choir.
All my rapi senses take with ardor strong
The living images, which gladly I
In weariness last night allowmd to die.
So may it be when, with an awesome tread,
Into my shuttered room my friends shall
come
And whisper ’twuxt themselves that I am
dead.
Into that death shall some sweet knowledge
leap—
A newer morning wake me from my sleep.
VICTORIA.
HAMER.

“SETTLEMENTS” OF A SORT.
Seabrook, M.H.R. for Franklin (Tas.), has
announced liis intention of moving for--the
repeal of the coasting-trade clauses of-the
Navigation Act as soon as he gets a chance.
If the Bruce-Page Government has any
backbone at all it will suspend the opera-
tion of the said clauses without waiting for
Seabrook’s motion, and keep them sus-
pended until the lawless Soviet regime which
lias been set up in the shipping business-
crumbles and respect for constituted autho-
rity is restored. When the Navigation Act
was brought into operation it was never
meant that the coasting trade of Australia
should be handed over to the control of a
group of Communists headed by that enemy
of Australia and the White Australia policy,
Walsh (imp.) ; but that has notoriously
been the result. Drunk with power, these
men have made war on the community in
forms recommended by their friends in Mos-
cow. There have been irritation strikes,
sympathetic strikes, job-control strikes and
overtime strikes —every sort of strike that
malevolence could suggest. The Government
has been repeatedly humiliated by examples
of triumphant lawjessness, and the president
of the Arbitration Court has been insolently
defied in his own court.
* * * *
The methods of these monopolists have
become so outrageous that even a Labor
Ministry has been goaded into resistance.
Certain dredge-workers employed by the
Westralian Government having become dis-
satisfied, Walsii (imp.) rushed over to Fre-
mantle, not to effect a settlement on condi-
tions ruling in other States, but to bring
about a general work-stoppage at the busiest
time of the year. He saw McCallum, the
Minister for Works, and this is what McCal-
lum says:—
At our first interview, Mr. Walsh suggested to
me that he should arrange a hold-up, to use his own
words, of the port of Fremantle, in order that I
might grant the members of the Seamen’s Union
some special consideration. He asked me to agree to
this proposal. I told him that I viewed it as being
a decidedly wrong, unfair and unwarrantable sug-
gestion, and that I could not be a party to it. But
it was plain that no matter what I, as Minister, did
a strike was certain. He was determined to have
a strike and hold up the public services of this State.
So the hold-up came. It coincided with the
lumpers’ strike against the shipowners em-
ploying wharf-laborers from the Sydney
Bureau, and for a time it was difficult to
distinguish one affair from the other, especi-
ally as Walsh had declared a sympathetic
strike against Bureau employers on his own
account. Presently “white’* ships on which
the lumpers had expected to earn good
cheques were declared “black” by the Sea-
men’s Union as a move in its campaign
against the State Government; and the lum-
pers roared with rage. Also, steamers bound
for Fremantle were compelled, for kick of
pilotage, to remain in Gage Roads; quaran-
tine and Customs officials were prevented
from boarding them ; the lines of vessels at-
tempting to berth were thrown back into the
harbor; hawsers were cut in at least two
cases; and passengers making for an Orient
liner were stopped by union pickets and com-
pelled to give up the attempt. When the
last-mentioned outrage occurred the Labor
Government sought the advice of the Trades
Ilall Disputes Committee, a body unknown
to the Constitution, but in these matters
superior to the Government in the Westralian
Labor view. The committee graciously
allowed that police might be sent to the main
wharf (previously abandoned to Walsh’s
Reds), remarking that it couldn’t tolerate
shipping being “paralysed by unlawful means
to suit a small group at the expense of 30,000
trade-unionists, a handful of men who were
making war on the Labor movement.” They
were also making war on the majority that
didn’t belong to the Labor movement, but
that seems to have been a minor considera-
tion. So, surrounded by policemen, the passen-
gers embarked. Finally, after the hold-up had
lasted about three weeks, the men who had
struck against the State Government went
back to their jobs for an increase of nine-
pence per week more than they had been
offered at first. All that arrogance and
anarchy and bushranging over a matter of
ninepence a week!
* * * *
The Prime Minister, who “settled” the
waterside dispute arising from the Sydney
Shipping Bureau without reference to the
returned-soldier employees of that bureau
and their legal right to preference, is re-
ported to have hopes of “settling” the
numerous shipping strikes also. His opti-
mism is not shared by the general public,
which has reached the stage where it can-
not book a passage on any Australian
steamer, or consign a line of goods to any
Australian port, with any confidence that
the contract will be performed. The only
settlement worth talking about is one which
will deliver this supposedly free country
from the tyranny of Walsh and his fellow-
Sovietists; and that means, in the first place,
suspending the coasting-trade clauses of the
Navigation Act.
GETTING BACK TO THE TRACK.
An English writer, referring to the pre-
dominant style of domestic architecture in
our finer Australian homes, points out that
it belongs to the earlier part of the nine-
teenth century—the period between 1810 and
1850. That strikes a kind of keynote in
Australian affairs. In the period named
the broad Australian foundations were laid.
Great roads were pushed inland ; wide areas
of land were taken up and partly developed;
inland towns were established. It was
the age of exploration and of pioneering.
Men and women carried progress in a cov-
ered waggon into the interior, faced great
hardships with a smile, succeeded, failed,
rose again and finally planted secure homes
in the wilderness. All Australian life was
then an adventure —an adventure full of
boundless possibilities; and a good deal of
the first pioneer energy carried forward into
the stirring times of the new goldfields. After
that the impulse se.emed to slacken. New
developments went on in more imitative and
less intense fashion ; Governments did more
and the individual less; only in a few areas
was there continuity in the big business
of adding to the territories of civilisation.
Not only the designs of our best houses be-
long to the first half of the nineteenth cen-
tury, but our best impulses can be traced
to the same period; and so much have thoso
impulses slackened that Australia seems to
be turning back upon itself, moving more and
-more towards the seaboard and feeling less
and less the call to develop our great heritage
of the soil.
* * * #
Although a somewhat similar state of
affairs exists in most countries, it is much
more difficult to account for in Australia
than elsewhere. It is true that there were
in some cases strong driving forces behind
the early pioneers. Conditions in the Bri-
tish islands during those early and middle
years of last century were hard. Industry
was shamelessly exploiting child labor; farm-
ing had fallen into misery, and the lot of
the agricultural laborer was pitiable; the
sweating system kept thousands of workers
in the towns in a state bordering on star-
Tn escane from such evils into a
vast land of sunshine and health was a thing
utterly desirable. Much hardship might be
cheerfully faced to make a family safe
against the ills that had bitten into the soul
of England and still more dreadfully into
that of Ireland. But the mere sense of
escape was not enough to account for the
swift and eager progress of early Australia.
There was an idealism behind the whole
movement. Men saw vaguely but hugely the
vision of the future in a new free land. The
books of the time are full of it; the private
letters of settlers reveal the constant for-
ward look. There was a kind of intoxication
of hope, which was at times as infectious
as an epidemic, driving the people on. They
might stagger before the tremendous blows
of an unknown and uncertain climate; but
they were up again and fighting with a grim
determination to succeed. Flood and fire
and drought drove them almost to despair;
but the green days came back swiftly. In
the end they discovered the balance of things,
and found that the evils were incidental
and the good seasons enough to atone for
them all. Looking at a map of Eastern Aus-
tralia made in IS7O, and comparing it with
one of to-day, it is curious to note that the
boundaries of genuine settlement have
advanced hardly at all in 50 years. Great
masses of detail have been filled in on the
modern map; but outposts of civilisation for-
merly shown have faded away. But compare
a plan of Sydney and its suburbs of the same
date with one showing the development of
the city at the present hour! The fact
stands beyond all question that our real pro-
gress was made in the early and middle
nineteenth century, and that we have spent
the last 50 years mainly in heaping burdens
upon that progress in the shape of city
streets and non-productive suburbs. The
pioneers of to-day exhaust their energies on
blocks 50ft. wide within a tram-ride of the
city.
* * * *
One great Australian problem of to-day
—perhaps the chief problem—is to find a
means of reviving the spirit of the pioneer-
ing years. There is an Australia as large
as the one w r e now effectively own which has
not yet been developed. The all but empty
North is still offering to those who will face
the great national task all the opportunities
and prizes that were offered to the
pioneers of earlier times. Politicians occa-
sionally and in a spasmodic fashion try to
nurse small, new settlements into life; but
it is very much to be questioned whether such
nursing is the thing to be desired. Wide
opportunity would seem to be the main re-
quirement for any great forward movement.
Despite the attractions of the nightly picture-
show and the little suburban garden, there
are tens of thousands of people now in the
cities who have vague ideas about land settle-
ment differing little from those which pos-
sessed the early pioneers. What is wanted
is something that will bring those ideas to
a head, revive the old spirit of home-seeking
adventure and turn the youth and strength
of the nation to the nation’s first job. Gov-
ernments that cannot re-awaken the pioneer-
ing spirit in young Australians have very
little hope of creating it in migrants fresh
from the land of unemployment doles and
narrow acres.
QUEENSLAND’S LABOR FINANCE.
Ra ndolph Bedford replies :
Much travelling delayed my reply to the Queens-
land critic of November 27. Only because of Tub
Bulletin's importance is the preposterous person
worth reply at all.
* * * #
For a beginning, his misuse of railway statistics
is dishonest. Queensland has so much higher rail-
way development that generalised comparisons are
impossibb, Queensland has 6040 miles open, costing
£49,711,014. or £8230 per mile. W.A. has 3629
miles open, costing £19,638,044, or £5411 per
mile. In arguing the financial results of the
operations of the railways of Queensland and W.A.
the nature of the country traversed must be
considered, and in this respect the position
of the Queensland railway system with its numerous
heavy grades (which increase working costs), tun-
nels and bridges, which resulted in increased cost
of construction and consequent higher cost of main-
tenance, does not lend itself to such a low cost of
operating as in W.A. A comparison of the interest
on capital cost of railways is as follows: Queens-
land, £2,316,353; Westralia, £787,221. That dif-
ference practically covers the Queensland railway
deficit, to be attributed to the highly-developed rail-
way position of the State—far in advance of actual
requirements of present population.
Queensland railway losses are largely owing to
numerous branch lines serving agricultural districts
where primary products, carried at low rates, form
the bulk of the traffic, and where train services
greater than warranted by the volume of business
have to be maintained to cope with perishable-com-
modity traffic. The rates statement following deals
with the W.A. items apparently specially selected for
comparison, and shows that on most of the items
Queensland rates are much lower than Westralian.
Other principal lines of traffic would show Queens-
land rates and fares in an equally favorable light:—
Rates—Firewood.
20 miles. 30 miles. 40 miles. 50 miles.
Queensland.. 3/5 3/9 3/11 4/6
Westralia .. 12/6 4/2 5/2 6/2
The rate for wheat 143 miles in Queensland— i.e.,
to the principal flourmill centres—is 11s. 7d. per ton,
not 12s. Id. as stated. A comparison of the wheat
rates to flour-mill centres compared with the
“cheaper” rate for wheat in Westralia is:—
150 miles. 200 miles. 250 miles. 300 miles.
Queensland 11/7 12/8 13/2 13/3
W.A. .. 15/9 14/1 15/11 19/-
The rate of fertiliser for 144 miles is 6s. (not 6s. 7d.
as stated). Comparison of the rates in the two
States:—
100 miles. 200 miles. 300 miles. 400 miles.
Queensland 4/5 8/9 10/3 11/9
W.A. .. 4/1 6/2 8/3 10/4
The rates for timber for 75 miles are: Log, 13s. 3d.
per ton; sawn, 13s. lOd. per ton (not 14s. 4d. as
claimed by the carper). The rates for logs for vari-
ous distances are:—
100 miles. 200 miles. 300 miles.
Queensland .. 14/11 21/6 28/1
W.A 16/6 25/3 32/9
And for sawn:—
100 miles. 200 miles. 300 miles.
Queensland . . 17/2 27/4 33/9
W.A 16/2 25/3 32/9
In Queensland log timber is conveyed at measured
weight, which returns a much lesser weight than
machine weight, so that a true comparison is even
more favorable.
A comparison of the cheapest rate for fruit for
local consumption gives the following:—
100 200 260 300
miles. miles. miles. miles.
Queensland .. 10/9 18/2 20/8 22/3
M r 4 16/6 25/3 29/- 32/9
The principal items of groceries and comparison of
rates for the transportation of such in the two
States are:—
Flour (cheapest rates).

Queensland .. 10/9 12/8 13/2 13'8

Queensland .. 22/11 36/6 41/10 45/-
W.A 55/- 92/2 107/8 123/3
The cheapest rates in Queensland apply where
the bulk of the traffic is transported— i.e., from
centre of supply to centre of distribution. Many
other principal items of traffic would show equally
favorable comparison.

Comparison of cheapest published return excursion
fares in Queensland and W.A. gives similar results.
Again, if the carper were correct, Queensland s
railway deficit is chargeable to extravagance. That
is easily disposed of by a comparison of working
expenses per train mile, obviously the only true test
of management. The figures of working expenses per
train mile are; N.S.W., 9s. ; Victoria, 10s.
5.85 d. ; Queensland, Bs. 3jd. ; S.A., 9s. sd. ; W.A.
9s. 6d. The Labor Government is charged with over-
staffing. Yet this is how it compares with the Tories
it displaced: Employees per mile of railroad in
Queensland, 1914-15, 3.09; 1923-24, 2.80. Revenue
per employee: 1914-15, £257; 1923-24, £336.
And if items are required to explain railway deficits
there are such cost increases, over 1914 figures, as
54 p.c. in cement; 73 p.c. in rails; 79 p.c. in
sleeper plates; 161 p.c. in flat spring steel; 87 p.c.
in coal and 59 p.c. in mild steel bars. Also Labor
took over a starved service. The expenditure on
locomotive repairs for nine years prior to 1915 was
£1,198,000 and for the nine years 1915 to 1921
£3,300,000. For the same periods the figures of
repairs to carriages and wagons were: 1906-15,
£1,119,000; 1915-24, £3,220,000.

Further, says the carper: “Mi - . Bedford’s figures
as to factories are misleading; in fact, worthless.”
The carper’s figures on factories are dishonest; in
fact, fraudulent. Why harp on mere number of fac-
tories when, as the Commonwealth Statistician points
out, numbers alone do not indicate progress, since
larger establishments may absorb smaller enterprises
or amalgamations may take place? A factory is de-
fined as any workshop employing four or more per-
sons, or under four persons when power is used. So
that any workshop employing one or more persons
where power is used is a factory. The increases in
some of the other States may look imposing, but
when analysed I find that in N. S. Wales 437 of
these new factories employed under four persons
(some of them perhaps one or two persons) ; and
334 in Victoria, 138 in W.A., and 47 in S.A. were
of similar capacity. There was practically no in-
crease in this class of factory in Queensland ; but in
the factories that count —those employing over 100
persons each—the increases since 1918 have been:
Queensland 16, S.A. 14, W.A. 10, and Tasmania
1. The latest figures show conditions a little better
in Queensland and a little worse in other States.
The southern States employ more female labor in
factories than does Queensland. X. S. Wales employs
37,000 females to 114,000 males; Vic. employs
49,000 females, 103,000 males; Queensland, 7000
females to 35,000 males; S.A., 6000 females to
27,000 males; and so on. Child labor in factories
provides similar comparisons. Queensland leads in
the value of factory output per employee, and the
amount added to raw material in process of manu-
facture per employee. These are: N. S. Wales, £872
and £365; Vic., £729 and £319; Queensland,
£B7l and £378; S.A., £775 and £314; W.A.,
£593 and £302 ; and Tasmania, £622 and £3lO.
Only a crazy old woman hoping for the worst can
say these figures are “worthless.”

As to the “cotton-grower getting on better with-
out Ministerial meddling,” how far did he go under
Tory Government, before alleged “Ministerial med-
dling” began? Here are the Queensland cotton figures
since 1918:
Acres under Yield in
Crop. Pounds.
1919 .. .. 72 27.740
1920 . , . . 166 25,065
1921 .. .. 1,944 940,126
1922 .. .. 8.716 3,956.635
1923 .. .. 40,000 11,748,510
1924 .. .. 14,000,000
(Area cropped in 1924 is not definite, and yield is
official estimate.)
The 1925 planting is completed ; and, roughly, 60,000
acres are under cotton. The critic’s tale of £40,387
loss is true, and represents establishment charges—a
mere nothing compared with the total production of
15,173,0001 b. of cotton produced to October last.
Similarly Mr. Critic’s figures of “losses” on various
State enterprises are mostly establishment charges;
but probably he would describe the ploughs and other
working plant of a farm and the money spent in
clearing and grubbing as a “loss.”
The beautiful Commonwealth scheme for succor-
ing the dairy farmers is no use to the dairy fanners
in Queensland; and as to whether it will be more
use to dairy farmers or the middlemen in the other
States, read the Melbourne Age of a few days ago,
and the Age should know the effect in Victoria.

If Queensland has added 36 million pounds to the
public debt in 10 years, Vic. has added just that
amount in five years, and that with much of its estab-
lishment work done. As to bleeding the taxpayers, the
Commonwealth Statistician shows that last year the
following amounts were collected per head of the
population in the various States by the State Gov-
ernments; Westralia, £2O 19s. 7d.; N. S. Wales,
£l6 12s. Bd. ; South Aus., £l6 Bs. 7d. ; Queensland,
£l5 19s. 6d. ; Victoria, £l3 12s. Id'.
The uwvser remarks about that excellent proposi-
tion, the Golden Casket, are answered by superior
conditions of Queensland hospitals and ambulances
and establishment of maternity hospitals in the Back-
blocks. Here are hospital revenue and expenditure
of the States compared, to be read with the propor-
tionate populations in mind ; N. S. Wales, £1,074,073
revenue, and £1.051,405 expenditure; Victoria,
£388,511 and £385,186; Queensland, £528,883
and £510,672; S.A., £266,448 and £245.140;
W.A., £166,665 and £166,072 ; Tas., £75,878 and
£77,015. That is one of the reasons why, as the
carper delicately puts it, we “hang on to office”—
to save the State from the incompetent Tories who
are Carper’s friends. But, of course, juggled figures
of elections to prove that Labor in Queensland rules
by minority will still be in order for the hopeless
gang who must win, tie or w r rangle. Yet we should
abolish the Casket and copy the N. S, Wales habit
of cadging pennies from school children to assist the
starved funds of the hospitals!
A HANDFUL OF IMMIGRANTS.
The carriage was alive with the liquid
babbling of Italian voices as we left
Townsville and jogged slowly up to-
wards the cane-country, where the rain falls in
waterspouts and turns everything to a green
that almost hurts the eyes with its vividness.
Among the immigrants there was an atmo-
sphere of excitement, the round heads of
children bobbing out of windows, their dark
eyes shining like agates, and their mouths


open ready to emit staccato cries of wonder
and admiration. Tlieir vitality made the
handful of Australians in the carriage seem
inexpressive and wooden. These newcomers
were not overcome by any feeling that it was
indecent to display their emotions, and so
their energies were not used up in repres-
sions of all kinds.
At least not here, moving along towards
country so pleasantly filled with then* rela-
tions that it must have seemed another Italy !
In the hotel at Townsville I had seen a group
of these same people almost overwhelmed by
a technique of manners they did not thor-
oughly understand. They were women with
families, newly-arrived by the boat, carefully
dressed but slightly provincial-looking, with
wide skirts that flowed out from their tight
Waists, and gold ornaments that took a lustre
from their dark skins. At the table in the
brightly-lit dining-room they had been rather
ill-at-ease, looking round anxiously to see if
anyone had noticed that little Pietro had
spilled his peas on the floor, or that Carlotta
had put her own knife in the butter. It had
been pathetic to see their eagerness to make
a good showing in a strange country.
Now there was no need to worry about
that. They were at home. They took
possession of the carriage in their amiable
way, pointing out the little cane-farms in the
bends of sluggish creeks, exclaiming at the
gangs of cutters, rising to a crescendo of
enthusiasm over the belts of luxuriant scrub.
Altogether they made an interesting crowd.
They did not correspond in any degree to the
Dago immigrant of current legend. The
rat-faced Neapolitan wharf-loafer, with a
thin violence in his gestures and a stiletto
in his boot, was conspicuously absent. The
men were thickset and open-faced, well-
dressed in rough tweeds, with a quick intelli-
gence in their lively eyes; the women seemed
to have a tradition of good breeding, and
wore their outmoded clothes with a quiet
grace. Apparently they had been used to a
degree of comfort.
But what were they thinking about as
they stared out at the tin shacks on the edge
of the scrub, where the cane grew to the door,
and the floors were raised just high enough
on their thin piles to show the collections of
jam-tins underneath ? Did they have memo-
ries of the more complex and varied world
from which they had come? Those dark,
luminous eyes seemed to hold pictures of
shadowy courtyards with flagged paths,
splashes of sunlight on white, ancient walls,
solemn processions through the streets on
holy days—all the things that give a richness
of texture to the old life of Europe. Per-
haps it was quite an illusion. The Italian
of to-day takes the word “moderno” on his
lips with a kind of reverence, and does not
trouble much about the past. As for art, he
has no more than the minimum which a man
reared in Pisa, Florence or Venice cannot
help sucking in through his pores from the
atmosphere around him.
At Ingham there was a surging crowd on
the platform, nearly all Italian. Appar-
ently all the friends and relatives of these
40 immigrants had rolled up to give them
a welcome. There was a confused babel of
sound, excited recognitions, and an extraor-
dinary amount of promiscuous kissing among
men and women.
“So the bucks kiss, too,” said a youthful
cane-cutter with a grin, looking down on the
crowd from the full height of his imperial
stature.
Outside there was a row of Fords covered
with Ingham mud. Most of them belonged
to the Italian cane-farmers who were welcom-
ing the new arrivals. A man wbo is making
money on the land nowadays may live in a
tin hut, with hardly more furniture than is
necessary for a blackfellow, but he must own
a car of some kind if he is to hold his head
up among his neighbors. It does not seem
as if the Italians have any richer concep-
tion of what is essential for a full existence.
One might have expected that they would
have introduced new ideas of comfort, amuse-
ment or domestic architecture, that would
have relieved the bareness of the ratber raw
life to which they have come. There is no
sign of that, though. A few of them grow
prosperous, send for their relations, and meet
them at the station in Ford cars. That is
all.
Yet they seem to make good citizens, in
the conventional sense of the word. The
youngsters learn English at the local con-
vent. if there is one, or else pick it up in
the hurly-burly of the State school. Their
elders work together in groups on tlie cane-
farms, and are initiated into the mysteries
of two-up on Saturday nights in front of
the nearest hotel. They seem to be just as
amenable to the law as their neighbors. There
are a few cases of stills being discovered in
patches of scrub, and the ownership being
traced to some Giuseppe or Garibaldi ; now
and then a young blood draws his knife when
crossed. As a rule, though, they are as en-
titled to be as shocked as other Northerners
when they read in the local paper about the
crimes of Melbourne.
This belt of fruitful earth, from Ingham
to Cairns, seems to be marked out for them
by right of their own energy and powers of
adaptation. There is no need to worry about
the invasion, at any rate as yet. In spite
of the prevalence of Italian names around
Ingham, Halifax and Innisfail, their owners
form a comparatively small proportion of the
population. It is their mere foreignness that
makes them seem so numerous in this country
of uniform habits and ways of life. Anil
they do not come from the lowest strata of
the Italian proletariat. In physique and
intelligence they compare favorably with the
bulk of the immigrants we are getting from
other quarters.
One objection to them is that when they
have secured areas of cane-land they only
give jobs to their countrymen. That might
hold water if they paid less than current
wages; but the newly-arrived immigrant
soon drops to the fact that there is an award
for the industry, and is no more eager to sell
his labor cheaply than the cane-cutter from
Fitzroy or Balmain. Again, it is said that
in districts where Italians are in the ascen-
dant it is hard to get new schools. Giuseppe
sees no reason why his young hopeful, aged
nine, should be sitting on a form adding up
rows of figures when there are more import-
ant rows of cane waiting for the hoe! He
is not alone in that, though. There are
cockie-farmers in backwaters all over the
continent who are just as ready to dodge
what is due to the next generation and tlie
country at large.
And the fact remains that the Italian
immigrants are doing the job, burrowing
into the belts of scrub, turning up the sou
between the tree-stumps, and raising uuir
flimsy houses on the banks of steamy, tropic
creeks. Only those people who are infatu-
ated with stupid German-American theories
about the superior virtue of the Nordic races
could be troubled in watching them arrive.
The pity is not that they are coming in, but
that they are bringing so little with them in
addition to their amazing energy. They
come from a country that, after all, knows
a eood deal about the art of living, and the
“tin-shack-and-two-ufl” civilisation of some
of our pioneering settlements could do with
a little richness and complexity.
VANCE PALMER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Motor-cars for the North.
F. Birtles is widely known as a man who
took to wandering over Australia by push-
bike in remote days, and has been on the
move by all manner of swift conveyances
practically ever since. lie has been across
Australia, and round Australia, and all over
Australia. He has seen much (no one could
go so much and not see something) ; but it
does not appear that lie has found any new
mineral or oil deposits, any valuable new
vegetation, or any previously unknown rivers
or lakes; that he has solved any engineering
problems or settlement problems or other
problems; or that he has, by direct or in-
direct action, started any new industry. The
other day the chronic mover was in Sydney
again, and was reported as adding his verbal
straw to the heap of alleged evidence: —
Mr. Birtles added that in his opinion the North-
South railway across the continent would be a great
burden on the taxpayer. It would cost the Govern-
ment perhaps £1,000,000 a year and would serve
only fixed localities, whereas motor transport would
open up the whole of the vast areas of the North.
A satisfactory scheme of road transportation would,
in his opinion, not cost more than £lOO,OOO per
annum, and would have the effect of developing
every district in the Northern Territory.
The itinerant gentleman isn't widely known
as either an engineer or a financier, but he
certainly drives motor-cars, and when he re-
turns, brown and bumped, from one of his
tours which tend to advertise the staying
qualities of some machine or other, he is
received and more or less lionised by eminent
persons in the trade. On the other hand he
doesn’t drive locomotives, and isn’t greeted
on arrival by railway commissioners. These
matters may unconsciously warp his judg-
ment. No explanation is offered why a com-
plete railway with a good port at each end
should lose £570 per mile per annum, or why
it should be such an amazing thing if it did.
N. S. Wales has a batch of lines, most of
which serve no defensive purpose, that lost
£1,207,824 last year, and it is building hun-
dreds of miles more which, it is well known,
will be of the same, sort. It should }>o ex-
plained why the line which is a national
defence work and an obligation of honor,
which will open a new province, and which
has been paid for with a land grant of
200,000 acres per mile, is the only one where
a possible deficit is an insuperable obstacle.
No reason is offered either why the proposed
fleet of motor-cars should lose only £lOO,OOO
per annum, or why a car service, said to be
so wholly sufficient for the Federal province
in the North, shouldn’t be good enough also
in place of the Port Augusta-llay or Port
Augusta-Broken Hill railway which there is
such an intense desire, in certain axe-grind-
ing quarters, to donate to N. S. Wales. In
Birtles’s tale, or the one ascribed to him,
there is a lack of differentiation between the
railway, which “would serve only fixed locali-
ties,” and the motor service, which would
presumably serve movable or travelling locali-
ties and places that fly about. (It is a
pity that this drawback concerning railways
wasn’t noticed earlier.) There is an utter
neglect of the simple fact that no car
service “would have the effect of developing
every district in the Northern Territory”
unless roads, each serving its “fixed locality,”
were built for them to run upon. A motor
road which will bear heavy loads, and wear
as well as the ordinary permanent way and
four steel rails, might easily cost twice as
much as the railway. The motor, though it
seems to kill more citizens at a week-end
than all the railways of a State do in a year,
may be a fair financial proposition when it
uses a highway already made for other pur-
poses and charges the repairs to the tax-
payer; on the other hand, when roads have
to be specially made for it in a thinly-peopled
country, it may be an expensive dud. As
another issue, the advocacy of a means of
transit which depends as yet solely on im-
ported fuel, against one which can be fed
with local coal, would certainly be good for
the importing interests, but its advantage to
any other interest is doubtful.

A Plea for Public Executions.
Dear Bulletin, —J. H. M. Abbott’s word-
picture of a modern hanging (B. 18/32/’24)
was a valuable addition to the bare details
given by the daily papers, and was a consola-
tion to those citizens who realise the value
of these periodic blood-lettings, but are pre-
vented from attending them. The tendency
to cover the unpleasant facts of life has lately
gone too far, what with prohibitions against
the publication of divorce proceedings and the
names of Indian potentates; and the meaning
of our occasional hangings is apt to be missed
in consequence. Society has always believed
in practising for its own good a little violence
now and then. The people of Uganda used
to get rid of their sins and evil impulses by
putting them on the shoulders of a man,
woman or child, whom they escorted over the
borders of their own country into the terri-
tory of an enemy, where tiie limbs of the
victim were broken and he was left incapable
of bringing his sinister burden back to his
own people. We like to convince ourselves, if
possible, that somehow our scapegoats deserve
their fate, but they were more honest on the
Niger. There a couple of sickly persons
were commonly purchased by public subscrip-
tion from another district, and with a ten-
derness and tact that Mr. Abbott would
approve the community hired a man from a
different town to put them to death. In
Siam it used to be the custom to select a
debauched old woman and carry her in pro-
cession through the streets to the music of
drums and fifes, until she had collected all
the public sins into her withered frame, which
was then incontinently flung on to a dung-
hill. With us, as with the cultivated Athen-
ians, the sacrifice is only occasional, and as
warranted by necessity. The ancient Greeks
regularly maintained at the public expense a
troupe of useless and degraded persons whoso
purpose was to rid the city of the spirits of
plague and famine. When calamity befell
the city a couple of these human prophy-
lactics were led from house to house until they
had absorbed into their bodies the germs of
misfortune, and then taken outside the city
and stoned to death, In those Sodoms where
the sense of slit Was always present, nothing
but a yearly sacrifice Would meet the case.
The LeucadianS used annually to hurl a
criminal into the sea from a high bluff pleas-
antly called the Lover’s Leap; blit, like the
present generation, people got squeamish
about it, and live birds and feathers were
fastened to the victim, who was afterwards
picked up by waiting boats. But not only
outcasts have been pressed into the service of
this public sanitation. The popular opinion
that the Kaiser should be hanged for the
disaster of the World War was not a new
idea: kings have been sacrificed in places
as far apart as Mexico and Tibet, sometimes
for as temporary a matter as the failure
of the crops. In view of the great an-
tiquity of social violence, I don’t agree with
Mr. Abbott's plea for the tidying up of capi-
tal punishment. It is a dangerous and re-
volutionary proposal. Since Mr. Abbott
presumably believes that the killing of mur-
derers deters would-be murderers, a public
spectacle would achieve his purpose much
more effectively than a whiff of gas in a
lethal chamber. But, as I have shown, that
is not the chief object of capital punishment.
Hanging never has deterred people from mur-
der. It did not even deter pickpockets from
stealing silk nosewipes. The persistence of
the custom of hanging has a much wider sig-
nificance. The average citizen feels his real
justification for the act lies in the sense of
relief he experiences when he reads in the
paper that; somebody has been hanged. As
long as he is uneasily aware of his own sub-
conscious predilection for violence, he will
continue to sanction a little killing as a
social purge—even when science has proved
conclusively that the victims are morons who
are no more responsible for their actions than
little children.—Yours, M.G.fcS.
A Frost at Canberra.
The sale of leases (business and residential - )
at Canberra excited faint and perfunc-
tory applause—so perfunctory that it
might have been some of last year’s
left-over applause warmed up again. The
S. M. Herald said “Buyers Active,” but on
inspection it proved that two buyers were
active over one block, both being anxious
for the credit of being first purchaser. The
Telegraph shouted “Brisk Sale,” but it was
only the brisk sale of the same lease to one
of the same pair. Apparently nearly 300
people turned up; but, as the Herald put it,
“the number quickly dwindled.” Out of 303
sites offered 150 were sold, so it is obvious
that 243 didn’t sell. Despite the “brisk
sale” of the first block, the bulk of the deals
were at the upset price, which was low. and
the buyers were mostly of the speculative
order, who took a job lot apiece. The indi-
vidual settler in search of a home amid bright
surroundings, at a place which “will be the
social centre for a large portion of the year”
(vide advertisement),was remarkably absent.
Yet it can’t be said that there was lack of
inducement, of a kind. Canberra will have
no early struggles, like an ordinary town.
Its water supply, electric light, electric
power, drainage, good roads, parks, dry pub,
golf links and its railway (to Queanbeyan)
are all provided, free of municipal debt or
municipal rates to pay the interest on the
debt. The buyer gets a 90-years’ lease. He
pays 5 per cent, on the amount of his bid
for the first 20 years. At the end of 20
years, 40 years, 60 years and 80 years the
value may be re-appraised, and 5 per cent,
is payable on the new price. In the last lqp or
two of the race, should the figure appear
too high or the town too dead, it will probably
involve little loss to abandon the worn-out
premises. Yet the slackness was pathetic,
flic total bidding for 150 allotments was
only £60,000, which will represent a revenue
of no more than £3OOO per annum for the
first 20 years. One explanation offered for
the fizzle was that the sale was held too
soon ; but for the buyer who wants to have
his bungalow ready against the moving-in of
Parliament in 1926, the margin seems nono
too large. Doubtless some more purchases
will be made, for there are people who must
have some sort of foothold at ’Berra, or at
the adjacent N. S. Wales town of Quean-
beyan, where drink is sold. But they are put-
ting off the evil day.
- ♦
The “Tu Quoque” Argument.
The strangest apologist to date for .Sydney’s
very malodorous municipal politics is young
Alderman English, who says he has been
four months in the Town Hall business with-
out having had his nurity assailed or his
virgin pocket smirched with the proffer of
tainted gold. His attitude is that if there is
graft in the City Council there is also “graft”
in the commercial world—as much as exists
in the Council, or more. Considering how
much larger the commercial world is than
the Mayor and Corporation of Sydney, it
seems a baby of an argument. There may
be more dust on an elephant than on a beo
without any disparagement of the elephant.
The graft alluded to in the mercantile com-
munity appears to consist of discounts, rebates,
commissions, money spent outlie entertainment
of customers, and other recognised devices.
They may be occasionally shady, but the
commercial man, except when he is forced
to tip a villainous alderman before he can
get a contract, the tip to the municipal scoun-
drel being added to the price, doesn’t do his
corruption with the ratepayers’ money. To
that extent it is nobody’s affair but liis own.
And there is a subtle distinction to most
minds between tips, discounts and commis-
sions on one side and robust blackmail on
the other. Furthermore, the commercial man,
as a rule, has other visible means of sup-
port besides his suspicious surroundings, and
that gives him the benefit of the doubt. He
is seldom a person with no office, no books,
no bank account, no capital, being a mere
dealer on commission, practically no recol-
lection of the names of the people for whom
he cominished. and with an intense desire
for an ostensibly unpaid aldermanic billet
of few perceptible legitimate attractions.
Among Town Hall matters which still shout
for explanation, and for which it is difficult
to find counterparts in local mercantile life,
was the passionate desire of certain alder-
men to pay £60,000 or £70,000 of the rate-
payers’ money for a coal lease whose value
was assessed by their own expert at from
£5OOO down to nothing, and the equally pas-
sionate craving to pay £30.000 or £40,000 to
a firm of architects, selected without competi-
tion. for looking on at an ordinary house-
breakers’ job. The bright young alderman
whose honor, it is alleged, has escaped even
an attempt at defilement for four months
went so far as to make some proposal about
the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry
into commercial graft—something similar to
the one which has been asking questions
about the Great Town Hall Smell. At last
census the commercial community of N. S.
Wales was numbered at 135,7'44, and it may
have increased since. Even a casual investi-
gation into the honesty of that little party
might easily divert attention from the Town
Hall till all the present aldermen are turned
into corruption underground, whatever they
previously were on top.
«
Sunday Observance.
ARTntTR Griffith plumps for a happy day:
The recent protest by a number of clergymen
against the holding of a sports meeting at a military
encampment on Sunday, and the fuss made by the
Presbyterian Assembly in Victoria because the State
Governor was supposed to have held a tennis party
on the Sabbath, open once more the whole
subject of Sunday Observance, and raise the question
what our Sunday really is. The Sabbatarians would
seem to maintain that it is the Jewish Sabbath
transferred to another day of the week —they habitu-
ally stigmatise as “Sabbath-breakers” those of our
young people who play a game of cricket or tennis
on Sunday. If they are right, then every clergyman
who has a chop grilled for his breakfast on Sunday
is guilty of the sin of Achan, and by the law of
Moses should be “stoned with stones till he dies.'’
No question here of the softening provisions of a
First Offenders’ Act! But surely this view is wrong
—theologically and historically wrong. The observ-
ance of the Sabbath is just one item of the vast
Mosaic Code. That Code either is or is not binding
on Christians. If it is, it must be so in its entirety.
The. laws of Jehovah —the God of Wrath —cannot be
monkeyed with. No one has any warrant to pick out
a portion of the Code and ignore the rest. If
it be a sin for Christians to ignore the Mosaic Law
concerning the Sabbath, it is equally a sin to ignore
the prohibition against eating oysters. Both man-
dates issued from the same authority.
But the Christian churches have always taught that
tne Jewish law has been superseded—not in part
but in whole-—by the Christian dispensation, and to
emphasise this fact with regard to the Sabbath the
early Christians deliberately fixed their weekly holi-
day on a different, day of the week—on the first in
place of the last. They selected not the Jewish
Sabbath Day but the day Christ rose from the dead.
This practice was confirmed by legal enactment in
the year 321 by the Emperor Constantine, whose
ed.ict describes Sunday as a joyful privilege, “the
venerable day of the Sun.” Charlemagne, the first
great Christian Emperor of the West, promulgated
laws prohibiting masters from compelling their
servants to toil on the Sunday, and from his day
onward Sunday became the great weekly holiday
throughout Christendom. Our own Parliament, in
the days of the Plantagenets, voted a considerable
sum annually to provide prizes (a sow’s ear filled
with pennies) to be competed for by the yeomen on
every village green in England “between noon and
sundown on every Sunday throughout the year,” and
later enacted a law prohibiting football on Sunday
because it interfered with the practice of archery!
The idea that the prohibitions of the Jewish law
contained in the Third Commandment were, by some

The Protected Importer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a manufacturer of proud and lofty
hopes;
In all affairs of industry he thought he knew
the ropes.
He built an article of worth and found the
building paid,
While far and wide he advertised the words
“Australian Made.”
Hammered and wrought and filed and turned
of bright Australian steel,
The token of his craft became his pride and
crest and seal;
And, though imported rivals tried to beat it
in race,
It was the best that cash could buy, and kept
it fame and place.
Yet this true manufacturer sat on an Aus-
trian chair
Beside a desk of English oak set out with
Yankee ware;
His carpet was of Asian make, his clothes
of Yorkshire tweed,
His Swedish-paper circulars were there for
all to read.
About the streets he drove a car of famous
French design ;
From glasses made in Belgium he sipped im-
ported wine.
The corks that popped were Spanish grown,
and on the table spread
Was Ulster linen; British knives dissected
meat and bread.
His home from door to attic showed his
wealth and care and taste—
His wife’s imported diamonds were African,
not paste;
Things from the east and north and west
were everywhere displayed;
And nothing but the people there was marked
“Australian Made.”
Only in business hours he spoke about “im-
ported trash”;
In private, foreign trade might have his good
Australian cash.
And just because there always were too many
of liis kind
The tariff-sinkers kept their way, and no
one seemed to mind.

joyful privilege” of the old English Sunday which
had formerly earned for the old homeland the sobri-
quet of “Merrie England.”
The attitude of our local Sabbatarians recalls the
story of the old Scotch lady whose son, on being
reprimanded for going for a tramp on Sunday, re-
minded her of the incident when Christ and His
disciples went out into the cornfields on the Sabbath ;
to whic h the dear old lady tartly replied: “Ah
yes, Ah ken a’ about it, and, to tell the truth, Ah
often wish He had na din it.”
The conventional idea of spending Sunday—eating
a big dinner and going to sleep all the afternoon—
particularly with regard to people confined indoors
all the week, is to my mind a hog’s conception
of a holiday. To me it appears a monstrous shame
to see our beautiful cricket grounds closed on our
one whole weekly holiday and our young men given no
outlet for their energies but smoking cigarettes,
swapping questionable yarns at the street corners,
sneaking into the back doors of the pubs or
“heading ’em” in some dark alley while “keeping
cave” for the police.
We are badly in need of a Charlemagne in Aus-
tralia who, while careful to prohibit work on
Sunday, would develop and systematise wholesome
sport and clean athletics. I reprobate as strongly
as the stoutest Scotchb3’terian the earning of money
<n Sunday, and would willingly prohibit anyone
doing so except the collectors in the churches and the
small section of workers required to transport and
supply with necessary refreshments a holiday-making
population. I consider the existing prohibition of
(lean sport in our public parks on Sunday as one of
those flagrant and pernicious examples of minority
tyranny to which we easy-going Australians are far
too willing to submit.
The Roman Catholic Church and some sections of
the Anglicans have always refused to accept the
gloomy Puritanical attitude in this matter. They
insist on their adherents performing certain religious
duties on Sunday morning, leaving the balance of the
day free for wholesome recreation, which the intelli-
gent men who control these organisations realise is
the most valuable form of rest.

A timely article in the Alfred, the little
(iuarterly run in connection with the Alfred
Hospital in Melbourne, calls for more con-
sideration for the struggling middle class, who
are practically debarred from using the pub-
lic hospitals. It is not altogether snobbish-
ness which constitutes the bar: hospitals
in Victoria are expressly declared to be for
the “indigent poor,” and no man or woman
need be called a snob for objecting to be
enrolled in that class. Yet the professional
or semi-professional person with £9 per week
or more is frequently worse off than the £9
per week working-man. What is advocated
is the reopening of the accommodation which
was formerly provided in the Melbourne hos-
pitals for “paying patients,” thus offering a
middle way between the necessity of adopt-
ing the role of an “indigent” person and
the payment of heavy charges at a private
hospital. It is a matter that deserves con-
sideration, at least until the hospitals are
made State utilities, to the use of which
no stigma of pauperism will attach.

Tea is our national beverage. In no other
country has it become so necessary to the
ordinary life of the people; yet our sup-
plies are entirely dependent upon Asiatic
gardens. At the present moment the world’s
crop is barely sufficient for current require-
ments ; and there are indications that those
requirements may soon fail to be met. The
use of the beverage is spreading rapidly. In
the United States tea was largely drunk in
the days of the New England clipper trade,
but gave place later to coffee, which in-
creased in popular favor until it was in uni-
versal use. Ten years ago there were many
large towns in the West and Middle West in
which nobody could be found who knew how
to make the brew; since then there has been
a rapid change, and tea-rooms are springing
up all over the country. As a result sup-
plies look inadequate for the growing con-
sumption, and an early indication of the
state of affairs will be found in rising prices.
If Australia is not to lose its fragrant billy we
would do well, then, to consider the supplying
of our own needs. The plant will grow here
over wide areas : it has long been a curio-
sity of ordinary gardens, and finds a place
in nurserymen’s catalogues. The picking of
the crop has been represented as the stum-
bling-block ; but this should prove no more
serious than the picking of a cotton crop.
Only experiment could prove the actual price
at which good locally-produced tea could be
placed on the market; but that price, once
found, should be the standard. There is no
reason why we should drink tea at a lower
price than that at which it can be supplied
from our own soil; and the additional price,
if any, would be a good investment. The
matter is quite important enough to engage
the attention of the State and Common-
wealth Governments. A few experimental
plots and a little scientific knowledge may
be all that is required. It would be better
to make the experiments now than to wait
until we are forced to make them by the
prohibitive cost of the imported article.

“Stellsby” is moved to a protest:—
At the Limbless Soldiers’ annual smoke social at
Melbourne Town Hall, the president said “the greatest
of friendships were welded amongst people who
suffered the greatest disabilities.” Possibly. But
do limbless soldiers suffer the greatest disabilities?
Only the other day an ex-Digger who had actually
lest his skin passed out, after years of agony; and
he was but one of a thousand men tortured by the
gas which wrecked them. And the gas-wrecks are
not the only ones either. I know one man who is
going about his business with a bullet pressing an
his brain, an 1 the pain he suffers at times drives
him to the verge of insanity. Another man of my
acquaintance who was shot through the heart and is
walking the streets to-day knows full well that he
is likely to drop dead at any moment, though you
wouldn't guess it from his demeanor. And what
of the spine cases now lying in Caulfield and Rand-
wick hospitals? Consider also the T.B.’s, especially
the throat and stomach cases. These men not
only suffer “the greatest disabilities,” but know
pretty well the number of days of grace remaining
to them; whereas men, even if limbless, may enjoy
excellent health, and be able to work. Again,
what of the blind and the insane? The latter, poor
fellows, are even incapable of “welding a friend-
ship.” They deserve a cheer now and then, God
knows, even if they don’t have an annual smoke
social. All decent people believe in the principle
of preference to soldiers, but only the indecently
ignorant believe in preference to limbless men
among the disabled.

A bill passed by the Speck's Assembly gives
the Wood Pulp Co. practical control over the
timber on no less than one-twentieth of the
State’s total area (16,000,000 acres). It
sounds formidable enough, but Premier
Lyons declares that in reality the Govern-
ment is giving away next to nothing, as all
existing timber and mining rights have been
safeguarded. The co. has the right to cut
pulping timber 15 miles on either side of the
Emu Bay railway line along 70 or SO miles of
its length; but as its freehold Surry Hills
estate (ills up something like half the area,
the Government concession is not particularly
huge. The co. pays one shilling for every
cord of wood cut on Government land, and
cannot lock up any portion of the land except
blocks of such size and situation and for such
time as the Conservator of Forests considers
necessary for the economical working of the
industry. In addition to these precautions
against land monopoly and go-slow, the bill
provides that the Conservator shall have the
right to reserve a total of 60.000 acres any-
where within the area for a State forest or
forests. This latter provision is apparently
inserted to ensure a supply of timber for any
mining field that may spring up in the
locality. The whole area is free to saw-
millers, splitters and the like on, the usual
terms, except on such blocks as the co. has
received the Conservator’s permission to
“work out of a face.” This is interpreted as
preserving all present rights of outside saw-
millers, while debarring them from jumping
or straddling a tramway laid down by the
big co. The latter is also given security
against any increase of the present land-tax
(2d. in the £) on the Surry Hills freehold.
Taken altogether, the bill looks like an honest
and business-like attempt to give every pos-
sible encouragement to a new industry, while
taking all reasonable precautions against
State concessions being used to establish a
dangerous monopoly. It is an experiment
that at least deserves success.

“Ming” : The murder by an Indian in Fiji
of S. B. Seai.y, a well-known surveyor, has
a more sinister aspect than that of the crime
itself, deliberate and brutal as it was. This
is the first time in Fiji’s history that a sahib
has been murdered for the sake of money—
the murderer, one Jantree, an employee of
Sealy’s, was convicted and duly hanged.
The affair emphasises how far the Hindu in
Fiji has travelled since pre-war days, when
the .Tantrees stepped humbly aside for the
white man, and insubordination was put
down with a heavy hand. Young India in
the islands has grown away from the old
folk, who cam; from dire poverty and were
glad enough to work for food and small pay;
he wears yellow boots, carries a cane, and
cherishes a vendetta against manual toil and
sahibs, and as he outnumbers the white popu-
lation of Fiji considerably the position is
not as reassuring as it might be. Since the
Natjsori rising of a few years ago the possi-
bilities of a big concerted movement by im-
ported India have been uneasily recognised ;
and those Australians who don’t see any
danger in flooding the North with “our In-
dian fellow-subjects” are blind and deaf to
what the peril in Fiji should teach them.

“C.L.”: A whole cargo of Greeks, Slavs,
Macedonians, Italians and the like ap-
proaches Australia—l2so or more of the
kind of people that the U.S.A. no longer
welcomes at its port of Skyscraperboro,
beside the statue of Liberty and the Man-
hattan cocktail. Arrangements are said to
have been made by which, after this consign-
ment lands, only 1200 Greeks and 1200 Jugo-
slavs will be admitted to Australia annually,
but even that seems fairly numerous, and the
alleged settlement appears to leave Italians,
Spaniards, Portuguese, Maltese, etc., an open
question. The strangers are mostly of the
laboring type, of whom Australia has too
many already. The whole basis of discrimi-
nation calls for revision. It is possible to
make too much of nationality and too littl.e
of the color of the hair. If ten sound and
blonde-headed immigrants could be got for
one, or, at most, two, of murky thatch, it
wouldn’t matter so very much where the ten
came from—-provided, of course, they were
not Bolsheviks. One result would be to give
the North Italian a big preference over the
Neapolitan and Sicilian, and he deserves it.
Dark persons with the faintest suspicion of
kinkiness or woolliness in their head-covering
should be rejected utterly. It might not
be too much if fair people of good character
and physique, who could show that they
wore competent tradesmen, were supplied
with free passages for selves and families.
Maltese ought to be barred en masse, as being
a little Asiatic, a good deal African, under-
sized, the wrong color of head, the wrong
kind of hair, and (in the main) no fighters
except with a carving-knife and from behind.
If to these few precautions was added abso-
lute shutting out of Syrians, a hawking race
badly mentioned in Scripture, Cypriotes.
Mohammedans and individuals who won't
take the oath of allegiance, things should be
pretty right until new problems spring rp.

-Al The willows droop their tresses,
While underneath them in the tide
Swift perch and mullet gleam and glide,
Or hide with pulsing gills and fins
In deep, weed-screened recesses.

And there a teal’s breast-feather;
And yonder, making ring and ring
That ripple wide, with dipping wing
A skimming swallow makes the most
Of life and golden weather.
Hither ere noon has Beauty strayed
To bide awhile, and ponder;
Hither, in radiant robes arrayed,
Has come to lighten reach and glade;
For here it is her sovereign will
At morning tide to wander.
Rich-jewelling the lustrous air

It seems the scene was surely made
For Love and Love’s well-wishers.
And feeling this, a happy thrush
Sits hidden, song uplifting;
And knowing this, with cheeks a flush
And eyes aglow, through reed and rush,
Their skiff scarce moving down the stream,
The lovers come a-drifting.
Through rush and reed, ’neath limb and tress,
They drift, and seek no landing;
And while they fondle and caress,
Of them and of their happiness,
To me it seems, the willow-trees
Have sylvan understanding.
Unheeding aught, their eyes a-swim
With lights that joy discovers,
Through reed and rush, ’neath leaf and limb —

He more than all the world to her —
They drift, the happy lovers.

The Russian triumvirs, Stalin, Kameneff
and Zinovieff, have pushed Trotsky out of
all his jobs, including the commandership
of the Red Army, on the ground that lie is
not uj) to the standard of ruffianism which
their brand of brotherhood demands. “In-
disposition” is given as the cause of his
retirement, and his doctor strongly advises
him to seek a warmer climate. It seems
more than likely that his late colleagues will
conduct him to the warmest of all.
At the annual conference of the Queens-
land Teachers’ Union a proposal that the
organisation should “assist in the movement
for the socialisation of the means of pro-
duction, distribution and exchange”—i.e.,
the entire Moscow programme minus the
bloodshed—was lost by a mere three votes:
40 Ayes and 43 Noes. Affiliation with the
Labor party was decided on by 46 to 37. The
N. S. Wales teachers, for their part, have
been bombarding the Federal and State mem-
bers with demands for a statement of their
views as to Commonwealth arbitration for
State dominies, and Labor papers are glee-
fully predicting that the T.U. will cast a
block vote against the Fuller crowd next
year. Presumably these Government em-
ployees know their own business best, but
by allying themselves with one of the politi-
cal parties they are forcing the other to
segregate the public-service vote at its first
opportunity. And even more drastic things
than that are likely to happen if people get
the notion that Communism is being insinu-
ated into the curriculum at some of the
State schools.
The thing that more or less justified pre-
ference to unionists in the beginning has been
quite lost sight of. The mere fact of a man
being a unionist doesn’t entitle him to pre-
ference any more than the mere fact of a
man being a Methodist. The early unionists
said “Give us preference, and we undertake
in return to refer all our disputes to arbitra-
tion and abide bv the awards.” The moment
a union strikes or disputes an award it thus
forfeits all moral right to preference.
Canadian papers continue to warmly con-
gratulate their Government on the commer-
cial reciprocity bargain which it has made,
or is making, with Australia, and that is the
worst kind of sign. Last financial year the
Canuck sold us 13 times as much merchan-
dise as he bought from us, which is the way
he loves to trade. In fact, he sold us more
value in farm implements alone than the
worth of all he bought from us, which was
bad for our own implement business. His
joy, on top of the previous joy, is presumably
because he hopes in future to sell us 25 times
more than he buys.
From the Gallery :
The N. S. Wales Leg. Council began an exciting
last-week by doing the Fuller Government a favor.
Recognising that Fuller was keen cn the Local Govern-
ment Amendment Bill, which gives increased decen-
tralisation powers to shires —or that Bruxner, the
Progressive leader, was keen on it, which amounts
to the same thing—it “reconsidered” the rejected
measure, and passed it without amendment. But,
becoming truculent all of a sudden, it struck cut
the clause of the Railways Bill granting railway
passes for life to politicians who had sat through
three Leg. Assemblies. Back came the bill with the
message that the Assembly insisted on the clause.
Then Carruthers, who leads for the Government, was
seen in one of his rare bursts of emotion; he
declared that the “grab” section had made the bill
“improper, illegal and unconstitutional,” and
that he would maintain his opinion if he “had to
leave the Government next day.” At his instance the
House insisted on its amendment, and the Assembly
gave in at two in the morning, being anxious to
adjourn for the holidays. Farrar and Boyce, the hon.
Ministers in the Council, sided with Carruthers, and
it looks as if the Government will have to be re-
constructed, whether Cocks and Oakes become Leg.
Councillors or not.
The real objection to the N.S.W. Assem-
bly’s grab at life railway passes for members
who have been thrice returned is that it
was surreptitious—members saw a chance
to collar a bit, and rushed it. It would be
a perfectly fair thing to suggest that mem-
bers have to make too many sacrifices for
the return they get, and to bring in a bill to
give them more —life railway passes, or pen-
sions, or anything else. Then the whole
matter could be discussed fairly. But this
bill didn’t raise the question whether M's.P,
are sufficiently paid or not; and the Council,
therefore, did the right thing in firing it out.
The deplorable feature is that it should be
necessary for a nominee House to do it.
The Allan-Pcacock Ministry had a strenu-
ous time trying to wind up the Victorian ses-
sion. Lukewarm Liberals were found difficult
to handle, and patchwork legislation was the
order of the day. The Uppah Chambah was
also snaky, being no longer under the domi-
nation of Arthur Robinson, who bossed it
when he was Attorney-General. In point of
fact, every Australian Government except
the one in Queensland has had trouble with
its Upper House this year. As a rule, when
BOWLED OUT.

a sign either that the Government is weak
or that it is not in earnest about its pro-
gramme.
A warning from London :
Mr H. E. Hyde, cne of the authorities on the
Lean-lie of Nations, says that the peace protocol brings
migration—the White Australia policy—within the
cognisance of the League, and is therefore the thin
edge of a dangerous wedge. Mr. Hyde is emphatic
in his opinion that the protocol should not be rati-
fied, principally because -of the inclusion of the
clause relating to migration inserted on the motion
of Japan.
Even if this country doesn’t sign the docu-
ment authorising interference with its immi-
gration policy by a league which includes
China, India, Persia and Abyssinia, the inter-
ference will certainly come unless this coun-
try sets out to do more per year for its
north-western half than it has done in the
past 50 years. Barring an occasional
theorist the White Australia policy hasn’t
a friend in the world outside the Common-
wealth and Maoriland, and mighty little is
being done to make friends.
The S. Australian loan estimates trans-
pired the other day. That State owed a net
debt of £122 7s. 4d. per inhabitant at June,
1923. What it owed at June, 1924, hasn’t
been published yet. What it will owe at
June, 1925, may be guessed at, seeing that
the proposed spending of borrowed money for
the year is £7,514,723, which is rather over
£l4 for every man, woman and child on the
premises. Two and a half millions are for
railways, and five millions for all sorts of
things, including hospitals and the purchase
of bits of scenery.
By reading his speech explanatory of the
bill to tax motors, traction-engines and horse-
drawn vehicles, Premier Allan created a bad
impression in Vic. Assembly. Certainly there
were many technical details, but half an
hour’s close study and a few notes would
have enabled Farmer John to give an ad-
equate exposition instead of reminding mem-
bers of a schoolboy at dictation-time. Law-
son, when Premier, always paid the House
the compliment of getting a good grip of
his subject. Solly asked if Allan was in
order in reading his speech (and reading it
badly, he might have added). Bowser didn’t
remonstrate, but he must have known that
Solly had the backing of May. Often Min-
isters are the mere mouthpieces of their
senior officers, who even prepare Budget
speeches, but they shouldn’t make it too
evident.
Cohen, K.C., only beat his fellow member-
for-Melbourne, H. H. Smith, by one or two
votes for the job of unofficial leader of Vic-
toria’s Dreary House. And Smith was sup-
posed to be a back-ranker. There is a
chance of getting some badly-needed new
blood into the Chambah in June. The rise
in property values has increased the number
of voters enormously, and as any old home
j s now wor th £5O a year rateable value or
£lOOO capital value heaps of men and women
are eligible as candidates. The £2OO douceur
paid for about 30 sittings a year is also an
inducement.

The Vic. Cocky party has found a place for
another of its members. Walter, who got
in only six months ago after two contests
for Gippsland West, has been put on the
Public Accounts Committee. It is a very
little fish, being worth only £3O a year or so,
but numerous members would have been glad
of it. Great is the rush for “perks.”
All through the waterfront strike Japan-
ese liners were regularly loaded and un-
loaded by gangs of union wharfies, while
British and Australian vessels, paying sev-
eral times Japanese rates of wages, were
just as systematically held up. A curious
commentary on this preference was the arri-
val of a Japanese liner with a statement,
signed by white passengers, that the second-
class part of the ship had been “dominated”
by an unusually large party of Maoris.
The night before the steamer reached Sydney, the
Japanese on board gave the Maoris a dinner, which
the captain and chief steward attended. Speeches
were made at the dinner stressing the friendship
between the Japanese and Maori races, who the:
Maoris asserted were blood brothers.
Henare evidently got that theory from
George Grey. Froude records in his
“Oceana” that when he visited Kawau in
ISBS the old man “insisted that most of the
islanders of the South Pacific, and the Maoris
in particular, were Japanese.” At any rate,
some Maoris, like some Australian Labor men,
seem to be getting into queer company.
Tom Wilford, Leader of Bill Massey’s
Opposition, which is suffering from the same
malaise as Liberalism elsewhere, moved the
S. M. Herald to big headlines over the
Japanese menace the other day. Wilford’s
proposals for combating the menace, how-
ever, are not likely to make the enemies he
visualises shake in their sandals. They con-
sist mainly of scrapping what little indige-
nous navy M.L. can boast of and increasing
the subsidy to John Bull. In these circum-
stances, the advocacy of co-operation between
his country and U.S.A., which has an
adequate home-built navy, and Australia,
which has at least started building one,
savors somewhat of “nerve.”
The S. M. Herald had a spasm of the old
Freetrade fervor the other day, and headed
an article “The Stimulus of Freetrade.” It
stated that the McKenna duty on motors
was taken off in England last April, and that
a slump was expected. But, instead of such
a thing being certain, a London Freetrade
weekly (the Nation and Athenaeum) had
alleged that the chief director of a large
motor-making co. (name not given) had
(at a period left indefinite) said his concern
expected to turn out over 1000 cars per week
during the next year. How many it turned
out previously wasn’t mentioned; also there
was no news as to how the new expectation
was panning out. It was a tale without
much beginning or end, and rather short of
middle; but, apparently, it was the best the
Herald could do for its old joss.
Judging by his talk at his welcome in Mel-
bourne, Donald Mackinnon has more than
a small regard for Brother Jonathan, as the
result of a 16 months’ sojourn with him
as Commissioner for Australia. Jonathan
is quite willing, he said, to be big brother
to Australia, stand by us in upholding White
Australia, and even lend us money. Cir-
cumstances might actually force him to trade
with us for food, as, with a natural increase
of two millions a year in population, he may
not be able to supply all his own wants in
a few years. Mackinnon stressed the point
that ’Frisco and Vancouver are little good
as trade gates. In his opinion we must get
round to the front door, and thus reach
N’York, Boston, Philadelphia and the rest
before we can do much good. He lias his
eye also on New Orleans and a possible
market along the Mississippi.
Though, acconding to the cables, Ulster is
adamant on the boundary question, recent
pictures of Craig, the Premier, show him to
have aged greatly. Being adamant is a heavy
job when every by-election shows that moder-
ation and faith in constitutional methods are
gaining ground in the Free State. Even if
Ulster started right, 20 years of adamantine
bluster would leave her in the wrong.
The latest Federal volume brings its life
assurance information up to 1022, at which
remote date 30 offices, including wild cats,
were doing business. A return for two years
earlier showed 19, and some had come and
gone in the interval. They seem to be a
coming and going lot, part of their business
being to sell out to a rival. Whether the
people who sell the old affair start a new
affair, or whether they simply become aider-
men, this paper has been unable to ascertain.
An embittered contributor recently stated: —
N. S. Wales is almost alone among civilised States
in having no laws expressly dealing with life
assurance cos. as such.
That may explain why 15 out of the 30
offices have their headquarters in Sydney.
Perhaps when the Federal Parliament comes
back from its long holiday on full pay (£lOOO
a year) it may attend to this matter, as well
as other of its unused powers and long-
neglected duties —uniform marriage and
divorce law, for. instance.
HERETICS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wong the Caveman’s death is due;
Whet the sacrificial knife 1
Wong, who ate of things tabu,
On the altar spills his life.
Wong the tribal law has broken;
il/ana-filled, the Chief has spoken.
Hale him to the market-place,
John, the accursed heretic 1
Spit upon his twisted face
As the slow flames curl and lick ;
Down his cries with laud and bell
As his black soul leaps to Hell.
In committee, stern and grim,
Sit in conclave round the Boss,
Men who make short shrift of Jim,
Who blasphemed the Party Joss:
Jim’s the pariah of the clan ;
Bill’s the safer party-man.
Caveman, heretic or thief—
Doctor, rabbit-hawker, clerk—
He who spurns the tribe’s belief
Walks the plank and feeds the shark.
Since the Neolithic prime
Independent thought’s a crime.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
It is just 33 years since The Bulletin
first printed its “Wild Cat Column,” and
during that period only two men have
directed it. From the beginning of 1892
to the end of 1903 James Edmond was in
control, and it was he who not only decided
upon the form of the tables but fixed the
character of this section of the paper; Mr.
Edmond was succeeded at the beginning of
1904 by S. H. Prior, who had been for a
year Mr. Edmond’s assistant; and from that
day, 21 years ago, Mr. Prior has, except in
his rare absences, written or supervised every
line that has been printed. The staff work-
ing under his direction and supervision has,
of course, undergone various changes; but
the hand that has governed the Column for
21 years still governs it.

That record div. is free of English income-
tax, which means a respectable addition to
the return to shareholders who live on that
side of the water. What the co. will make
this term, with unexampled prosperity in the
pastoral industry and good prices for most
primary products, should be a pleasant form
of guesswork for shareholders. They have
something to build on. Headquarters are
in London, and, although the accounts close
on June 30, the appropriations are not made
until four months later. Therefore the Board
had time to weigh up the position before
it lifted the final distribution the extra 2 p.c.;
and it also allocated £25,000 to the staff pro-
vident fund, or £lO,OOO more than in 1923.
It is never safe to prophesy, of course; but
it docs seem safe to say that if the current
year isn’t a fat one there is going to be a
horribly disappointed Board.
Old shareholders are probably rubbing
their eyes to make sure they have read that
17 p.c. aright. It isn’t the sort of dividend
Dalgety’s used to pay even in years when
things were supposed to be booming in Aus-
tralia. In the late ’eighties it paid no more
' than 8 p.c.; but it was able to maintain that
rate right through the blood-sweating ’nine-
ties. After the rabbits and the droughts had
assisted poor markets to put most of the
back country in mourning in 1902, there was
a gradual reduction to 5 p.c., but no lower.
(In these days when we don’t blink to read
that wool has been sold at 51d. it is scarcely
believable that 7ld. was a good price in 1901
and “good merino” had been as low as OJd.
in 1895.) Through those disturbing years
Dalgety’s had—as it still has—-the inestim-
able advantage of cheap fixed debenture-
money. What that meant not only to Dal-
gety’s but to Dalgety’s borrowing customers
is not to be computed in terms of interest
only. You can reckon the benefits in many
things—sleep, for instance.
The next little table is dropped in chiefly
for the sake of the last item, “Taxes” :

The outgoings there for the past year don’t
include the £25,000 passed to the staff provi-
dent fund; that nice little nest-egg now
amounts to £106,000. In three years past
the co. has paid £534,958 in taxes. In the
last years before the war it was paying
about £30,000 p.a. The gross profits are also
exclusive of provision for bad and doubtful
debts and depreciation, the extent of which is
not disclosed.

There is nothing sounder in Australia. Lia-
bilities (including terminable stock) amount
to £3,050,113. The whole of it is covered by
cash and Government securities and book
debts, amounting in the aggregate to
£3.669.705. and the excess more than pro-
vides for the half-million of profs. In addi-
tion there are the advances and premises and
stock : these at their written-down value total
£4,636,914. And internal resources must be
very weighty. How weighty may be gathered
from two items. Over one million pounds
has been laid out on premises and plant, and
they have been written down to £416,183.
The reserve fund investments are in the
books at £1.000,000, but the securities
(enumerated)have a face value of £1,301.860,
so that, unless they have to be disposed of,
considerable profit will be made as they
mature—although that is looking a long way
ahead in the case of some of the stock. When
assets such as those are treated in that
manner, there is fair ground for assuming
that possible contraction in the value of
others less stable has been allowed for gener-
ously. In 1904, with capital £500,000 less
and visible reserves not one-fifth of their
present dimensions, advances on land, sta-
tions, stock, wool and other produce (includ-
ing properties held by the co.) amounted to
£4,563,532. The balance-sheet total was then
£0,8,)9.907. At June 30 last the same assets
stood for £3.660,168 in a balance-sheet total
of £8,306,619.
This is not a time for plunging in pastoral
securities, sheep are very dear —how could
they be low-priced when they will earn you
a pound a head in a year? Dalgety’s are
therefore justified in playing for safety. Yet
there is. so much work to do in Australia
that this Column will feel more cheerful
when the management can find better use
than it makes at present of the nearly three
millions of “cash and investments.”

That's better. The co. last year distributed
only £06,001 of its £7)0,072 of profits • and a
few. more years like this will do it no harm if
it wants to expand as rapidly as some of its
competitors have done. In the past its
shareholders have been too hungry, and have
neglected reserves, so that funds in relation
to risks have often been below what is gen-
erally considered a fair thing. Two-thirds
of the . capital of £300,00S represents re-
serves issued as bonus scrip in 1911 and
1916, and the second issue might well have
been smaller. Those capitalisations would in
themselves have been of little moment if it
had not been . that divs. have been main-
tained at a high rate. An insurance co.
cannot have it both ways. If it maintains
disproportionately large reserves it may pay
large divs.. as did the South British. Or
it may capitalise reserves and pay a moderate
div. like the United. But it cannot do both
and win the complete confidence of the insur-
ing public. Often, no doubt, the position is
better than a rival agent is able to make it
appear. In 1922, for instance, it looked
pretty bad when the reserve to cover unex-
pired risks was lessened by £20,000 to permit
of a 71 p.c. div. being paid, seeing that
thereby this reserve was reduced to 11.3 p.c.
of net premium income, whereas 40 p.c. is
the customary tiling. Actually the ratio
of total funds to net premiums was 12 p.c.
greater than is usually considered adequate:
but the rival agent wouldn’t be likely to
point that out. Even now, though the policy-
holder is quite well nrotected, the reserve to
cover unexpired risks is much below the
40 p.c. That percentage called for £106,763,
but the amount in the reserve was only
£42,500. There is, however, a general re-
serve of £100,000; but with reinsurance re-
serve under-proportioned, shareholders can
look upon only £35,737 of that as theirs
beyond all question. The directors ought,
therefore, to sit down hard on any proposal
to increase the dividend beyond 10 p.c. for a
good many years to come. And that can be
done without any hardship. To old share-
holders last year’s div. was equal to 30 p.c.,
and even to those who bought shares on the
market at a 50 p.c. premium up to eight
years ago the yield is equal to 13J p.c.
The Colonial Mutual should expand. It
is getting on towards the half-century mark,
and is not doing its fair share towards win-
ning that business which has hitherto gone
to offices whose profits drift overseas. This
is the co.’s history viewed from that stand-
point :

Though the increase in the expense rate is
very substantial, the premium income is
barely maintained ; and there isn’t anything
very satisfactory about that. Investments
are in the following form:—
form:—
, 1921 N f 1924 —

Public securities & cash £394,699 73.0 £324 172 60 3

Mortgages .. .. 12,000 2.2 Nil Nil
Sun Iries .. .. 34,144 6.3 31,744 5.9
Policy-holders, as before remarked, are
thoroughly well secured : total funds amount
to £461,666, which is over four times last
year’s losses. And the investments appear
to be quite sound and fairly remunerative.
Last year, on the mean of the funds, they
earned £5 13s. 6d. p.c., yielding £25,710
over five-sixths of the dividend. During the
year V. J. Saddler, the good Australian
who had been chairman of the co. for 18
years, died. M. 11. Baillieu was appointed
to the vacancy on the Board.

There was £73,274 more capital at work
during the half-year than when the preceding
term opened ; and no doubt the increased pro-
fits are in part a consequence. Enough was
left over after the 8 p.c. cum. prefs. were
paid to give ordinaries a div. at the rate of
14 p.c.: but the directors did the right thing
in keeping to the old 8 p.c., and shareholders
are not entitled to expect any mqre until the
position shown by the balance-sheet is still
further improved. Matters at present stand
like this:—

Bank overdraft was worked down £OOOO-odd,
but the reduction was more than offset by
the increase in sundry creditors. Stock was
reduced a little further, but stocks for the
Christmas selling would arrive after the clos-
ing date, so that movement was little more
than normal. Book debts took a sharp step
upwards, the increase amounting to £31,490.
That may be seasonal (a whole lot of Aus-
tralia gets paid only once a year—about
January) or it may indicate a larger turn-
over. The outstanding feature, in any case, is
the.co.’s dependence on the bank. Reserves of
£60,497 have accumulated, but £51,577 of
capital is still unrepresented by tangible
assets, which means that tangibles of
£448,423 have to earn divs. for the half-
million. Substantial improvement in the
position is, however, being made, in
two years the co. has won £104,999 of
profits, paid 8 p.c. divs., written off £3856,
and added 30.731 net to reserves. This pro-
gresses all the more creditable in view of
the fact that for the Sept., ’2l, half-year a
loss of £35,000 was shown and in the follow-
ing term a profit of only £6660. The co.,
which was formed by the amalgamation of
businesses trading in the various States and
Maoriland under the same name, lias had a
good deal of organisation and consolidation
to do. If the improved results of the past
half are the firstfruits of this work, equal
benefits should be shown in the future, and
a couple of years should in that case see
all the capital represented by revenue-earning
assets. In ordinary circumstances the sur-
plus earnings would go towards reduction of
debt; but the co.’s policy is to be its own
laudlord wherever possible—premises are to
go up next in Brisbane. How this policy
will work out nobody knows. It may in
course of time save the co. from the exac-
tions of a landlord —or many landlords. It
certainly will if the cities continue to make
progress. But it isn’t easy to earn big divi-
dends when a large proportion of the capital
has been newly put into bricks and mortar
built at present prices. Some cos. do it, cer-
tainly ; but they are twice blessed.

co. gave for it, though one would feel more
satisfied about the new book-value if a valu-
ator’s report was attached. The co.’s
original intention was to raise sufficient capi-
tal to manufacture fertilisers, but only
£23,000-odd was subscribed, and the co. never
got past the stage of being a distributor. Big
concerns operating super.-works as a side-
line or working in conjunction with smelters
collared the market: and there wasn’t enough
co-operation about this little intruder to win
it much of a footing. Sales have steadily
moved the wrong way:—

1916 .. 30,102 1921 .. 17,445

1918 .. 12,778 1923 .. 11,497
1919 . . 10,658 1924 . . 7,591
Even the modest 5 or 4 p.c. div. was not
possible last year, and there is only promise
in the current term. Altogether a dismal
record and a not-too-bright prospect for a
concern which was formed with the Good
Australian ambition to help build up local
industry. Creditors are in a good position:
as at Aug. 31 liabilities were £332, while
cash amounted to £5334, War Loan £1952,
and book debts £429l—these besides stock
(£2301) and the fixed assets.

When the disclosed profits are exact to the
penny necessary for the div., the review of
the company’s accounts should probably
open: “Once upon a time.” But the
Invincible is a Howard Smith-controlled
concern and shipping influences have affected
the lay-out of the balance-sheet and report.
It is an uncommunicative document: “The
balance at credit of Profit and Loss after
providing for depreciation is £lo,4oo”—just
enough for the div. The same phenomenon
was observed three years ago. The question
is: What has been the allowance for depre-
ciation of plant and coal properties? lias
it been sufficient? Or more than sufficient?
There is only circumstantial evidence on the
point. Colliery and other properties and
plant are in the books at £79,596, and that
is £4145 less than they figured at in the
1923 accounts. Cottages for rental have
been written down to £9O from £242 in ’23
and £419 in ’22. Further, the accident in-
surance reserve (not included with reserves
in the table) went from £13,887 to £15,005;
and it looks as though there might be a bit

is strengthened by this comparison:—

Liabilities.. .. 3,588 2,901 5,490 7,031
Surplus .. £6,822 £43,517 £53,227 £54,972
There probably has been depreciation of some
of the fixed assets: for example, the coal
that lias been taken out can never be put
back again. Still, £4OOO-odd is a pretty
good provision to make against that wastage
in two years. Paid capital was unaltered at
£104,000, so that the surplus of liquid and
semi-liquid assets of £54,972, less the final
div., represents 9s. 9d. per share. As to the
future, the rumbles from the coalfields are no
louder than usual, and the Howard Smith
agency insures marketing.
An attempt is being made, as it ought to
be made, to carry on the old Sydney business
of Feldheim, Gotthelf, Ltd. But the thing
will have to be done carefully, or there will
be another failure ahead. The goodwill is
no doubt worth saving; but goodwill of itself
isn’t to be trusted to earn a farthing. If
a good name could earn money the old co.
wouldn’t have got into such a mess. The
fact that so heavy a loss was made, despite
the good name, suggests that either the
policy or the management was astoundingly
bad; and those who want to resurrect the
business ought to proceed, if they proceed at
all, with that fact always in mind. That
means that nothing should be taken over as
a matter of course —warehouse, fittings,
plant, stock (what there is left of it) or
staff.

The expected zone of secondary enrichment
has not yet made its d6but at Alt. Isa (Q.).
A puzzling thing is the purity of the oxidised
ore as regards zinc and its limited occurrence
in the now partially revealed primary ore.
All along St. Smith and others have spoken
.of the leaching, in the carbonate ores, and
they were right, for the zinc now appearing
is undoubtedly primary sulphide. Where,
then, has the zinc gone from above water
level, and the silver with it? There is tiie
strongest possible argument for the existence
of secondary oxides and sulphides, but in
the three shafts which have tapped water-
level there is practically no enrichment. One
theory is that small fault channels have
segregated bonanzas above water level in
isolated patches only, and that the three
deep shafts have been unlucky in missing
them. The other is that there is a fairly
deep zone of alteration, and that, although
primary sulphides have been struck, the bulk
of the ore so far is secondary and that en-
richment is still below. The absence of zinc
above water level and its presence below
makes one of these theories look almost a
certainty. In the No. 11 Black Star lease
the bottom ore assayed 19 p.c. zinc in addi-
tion to 30 p.c. lead and lOoz. silver. The
gross value of this ore is, roughly, £l7 10s.
Several other assays have shown over 10 p.c.
zinc, and opinion is hardening on the field
that if it keeps above 8 or 9 p.c., it is
going to be a decided asset. There is
not much doubt now as to the permanency
of the lodes to considerable depth, but the
next 50ft. of sinking is going to disclose
a lot about silver values and as to the place
zinc will ultimately take on the field.

Dr. Wade is at present on field work
with State Geologist L. C. Ball in the Roma
district (Q.). Ball can now be numbered
definitely with Dr. Jensen as taking an
opumistic view of the western country as
a potential oil producer. He cites, in addi-
tion to the wet gas at Roma, the petroli-
ferous products, as well as various gases,
obtained from numerous artesian wells
between Roma and Longreach. He thinks
water pressures have been probablv with-
holding evidence of the existence of oil in
the artesian basin. Dr. Wade’s opinions on
this basin will be aired in Sydney before
the Federal Parliamentary Commission. He
has already been to Tewantin and Beau-
desert, but has made no announcement re-
garding these areas.
“Shareholder”: Randolph Bedford says
the N.S.W. Railway Commissioners are mak-
ing a success of the Lithgow Colliery. I
gather that privately-mined coal there was
formerly 17s. lOd. a ton, but State compe-
tition has forced it down to 11s. sd. But
State competition does not do that where
Mr. Bedford’s own party rules. Can he
produce evidence that one State colliery in
Queensland can land coal at the “profiteering”
price of 17s. lOd. and yet show a profit?
To pay for its optioned blocks Mt. Isa
Prop, is issuing 140,000 ss. shares, payable
Is. on application and Is. on allotment, bal-
ance as required. Holders are being offered
the shares, one for every one held.
Australian gold production is still on the
down-grade; for the 10 months to the end
of Oct. the decrease was 29,6750 z. fine
compared with the first 10 months of last
year. Queensland is the only State to show
improvement, the gain being ll,ooooz. Not
one notable find has been proved in the
Commonwealth in the year, and Westralia
contributed over 70 p.c. of the 10 months
total of 563,2930 z. Queensland has moved
up into second place with 79,2620 z., which
is not so much an evidence of increased
activity in Queensland as of deadness in
Victoria.

Belimbla Creek (N.S.W.) battery should
be heard from early in January unless yet
another management is woefully out in its
calculations. The tunnel intended to cut
the main lode at Nerrigundah is in 500 ft.,
and has about 400 ft. to go; but at least two
other sources of ore supply are already
opened up. The co. will need to get on to
gold recoveries early in the new year, as
the whole of the 90,000 contribs. are fully
paid. A trial lot of 10 tons of stone went
just an ounce; and this is only half the
extraction forecasted in the prospectus. And
trial crushings don’t show the worst possible
results as a rule.

To June 30 the fire in the Sulphide Corp.’s
Central mine, Broken Hill, had cost £187,123.
It has been charged up to contingencies;
otherwise it would make an awful mess of
the year’s accounts. As it is. without reck-
oning the cost of the fire as an outgoing for
the term, the profit has been reduced to
£84,142.

The report on Yalgogrin (N.S.W.) by
L. F. Harper, senior Government Geological
Surveyor, is unfavorable. The little pros-
pecting done made it impossible to determine
the length or depth of the veins and veinlets,
which vary from 1 in. to 6in. wide; but indi-
cations were against much of any conse-
quence. Another area, six miles to the south-
west, showed more promising values; here
systematic prospecting is ImM to be ’ tified.

During the 10 (rays’ holiday a new a .afting
will be put into the winding engine at No.
1 shaft of the Broken Hill South. No ore
will be raised while the new shafting is
being fixed. Parties have been hreelOm;
ore on the 1270 ft. level for several weeks
past. This was the level that was fiooaed
after the fire broke out in the Central, next
door.
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) reports an Im-
provement as the western ore pipe in the
Wild Cherry at Ardlethan goes deeper. The
eastern pipe, however, has not regained the
good appearance lost a month ago. Other
workings reveal no material changes, but the
6d. div. due in January and the improve-
ment mentioned have bucked the market to
the region of ss.

Christmas Gift, Cullinga (N.S.W.), had
to stop because the men considered the work-
ings unsafe. Apparently, having thought it
over, they decided to take the risk, and so
returned to their drills. Mines Inspector
Jacquet inspected the Gift about a year ago,
and apparently saw no cause for alarm;
but a lot of things may happen in a year.
The lode is a big one, and cavernous stopes
are the result; also, the co. is usually short
of filling. If a mine of that sort hasn’t
been inspected for 12 months somebody wants
a wigging. The old co. recovered nearly a
ton of gold from the shallow levels, but the
present one has not had much luck lower
down. .

Accounts of Great Britain (N.S.W.) for
the half-year to October 18 show that the
Britain plant recovered 38 tons 3cwt. from
28,169 yards, or more than 31b. to the yard :
while the Y Creek plant treated 22.105 yards
for 13 tons 18cwt., or 1.41 b. Net earnings
were £lB9B. and four shilling dividends on
the 10.000 shares absorbed £2OOO. Since the
balancing date another dividend of Is. and
bonus of Is. have been distributed. It is
a good performance for a capital of only
£5OOO, especially as reserve account figured
at £5OOO on October 18, and creditors claim
only £1275. Property, plant, fuel, etc., are
valued at £9436; investments, £2316; cash,
£1269; ore in hand, £954.

The New Guinea Oil Co. (Sydney) has
made good ime of the seven months that have
elapsed sincb the flotation. While general-
manager R. S. Haynes was away in America
buying plant, brother L.T. was at the-leases
on the Vailala River doing the spade work
preparatory to the drilling. In the same time
a 40-h.p. launch to do the running between
Port Moresby and the co.’s leases has been
built in Sydney. Drilling is scheduled for
the end of March; when, all going well, a
20in. hole will be commenced. This will carry
a 151 in. casing designed to shut off all sur-
face waters. _ At 200 ft. the hole will be re-
duced to 15in., and the casing to 12$in.
Further examination has located another
series of pas jets and oil seepages. The co.
has a capital of £150,000 in 20s. shares. Of
these 50.000 were appropriated by the ven-
dors, r l 50,00 A '’ontribs. are in reserve.

Maiupau Oil Corporation did not leave
the slips. It was to have been a half-mil-
lion proposition, but despite an impressive-
looking iloard the money was not forthcom-
ing. Mandated Development Co. was hand-
ling the flotation. It has withdrawn the pros-
pectus, and intends to offer 5000 £1 ordi-
naries to present shareholders and to those
who applied for Matapau shares, all at a
premium of £1 per share. This £lO,OOO, with
the money available, will do further pros-
pecting with the plant on the ground. A
further bore is to be put down, and an endea-
vor made to prospect a promising-looking
area on the Sepik side of the property.
The position of Ratrut was revealed by
chairman Kerry at the annual meeting,
Avhen the directors assessed the life of the
property at no more than two years. Con-
sequently shareholders may expect nothing
until another property has been secured;
for current funds and future profits from
the old ground may be all wanted in the
shifting process. “The resumption of divi-
dends would be contingent on the ability of
the co. to finance transfer of the plant to
another site,” was the chairman’s way of
putting it. Having been bitten by one pup,
the directors have become cautious.
The new Ronpibqn (Siam) dredge got
down to bottom in April, but, with only a
narrow gutter of wash to cut into, did not
do the yardage expected. Running costa
were Gd. up to June. Now, according to
R. W. Stringer, they have fallen to 3d.
This in ordinary circumstances would estab-
lish the good name of the plant for effici-
ency ; but it is merely sweeping up ground
worked by the Extended, and the critics will
have to wait till virgin ground is entered
before the last word as to the plant can be
said. Meanwhile the information wanted
from the Extended is how it is that
the plant can rake up from 25 to 30 tons
from its worked ground. The Ronpibon co.
holds half of the Extended shares, and re-
ceived £3875 as divs from the pup for the
year, while 4s. a share further has come in
since the books were closed. Another pend-
ing Ronpibon float is that of the Thajerm
mine, the issue having been underwritten,
presumably by A. W. Palfreyman. So far
£10.600 has been spent on the area, which, of
course, will be recouped to the Ronpibon
either in shares or cash. Its shareholders
will also be allowed to snap up the new
stock, thereby providing working capital for
the concern. Incidentally, a new co. will
adorn Stringer’s doorplate. Ronpibon’s
cash position is good. At June 30 it had
£6687 in the bank and £3OOO to flow in from
the Extended, as against £4OOO of debts.
Rawang Tin Co. (F.M.S.) is reorganising.
It is proposed to return 4d. a share on the
2,000,000 shares and cut down the 2,000,000
2s. shares to 200.000 at 20s. The market had
a spurt to 2s. Bd. in consequence, but the
flow of scrip at that figure checked any fur-
ther accretion in paper values.

The Speck Assembly has passed a bill
embodying the agreement with the Austra-
lian Shale Co., which is expected to result in
the Latrobe shale deposits getting a trial

the co. a practical monopoly of the shale
country for 21 years, but Parliament cur-
tailed it to 10 years. Shareholders have yet
to accept this.

Holders of copper stock are whistling to

are supposed to be low; but if there were
definite signs of a rise buyers wouldn’t be
likely to miss the chance of stocking up.
The real trouble is the discovery of mines
which can be worked profitably at present
prices. The French properties at Katanga,
in Congo Free State, are pouring out stuff.

Much of the current trouble In Egypt is due to
Allenby’s reluctance to offend Moslem susceptibilities
by an} thing in the nature of direct action. The Anzac
Mounted Division was in a rest camp in Palestine
after the Armistice, and suffered much from the
thieves of the Arab village of Surafeud, near by.
All complaints were ignored or minimised by the
British authorities, who had strict instructions from
Allenby to conciliate the Mohammedans. Individual
attempts by Anzacs to correct matters were severely
punished. One night a Maorilander, while attempt-
ing to capture an Arab who was robbing his tent,
was shot dead. Ilis mates followed the robbers
tracks at once over the dew-damped sand to the
village and put a cordon round it. In the morning
the murderer was asked for, but the Sheikh didn’t
savvy. Next night, supported by the two Aus-
tralian brigades of the Division, the Ist and 2nd, the
Maori landers surrounded the village and, aftei taking
out the women and children, started in cn the men
with waddies. A lot of the village matrons were
widows next morning and every wallad got his
hiding. Then the village and a Bedouin camp were
burned, and all hands returned to the usual routine.
No one would squeak; all Allenby could do was
to “blow off,” and the language he used to men
unable to reply inado the whole mob his enemy. In
his official reports and recommendations for final
honors and decorations mention of the famous*
Division and of individuals belonging to it was
conspicuously ignored. Possibly he has changed his
views lately as to the wisdom of “conciliating"
the Moslem of Palestine and Egypt by truckling sub-
sevvience.

“Cwrw Bach”: “Oh!” said our romantic
lady visitor, gazing rapturously through tli:
verdurous gloom of the primeval scrub with
its tangle of vines, bangalow palms and tree-
ferns, “I think a wild life must be wonder-
ful.” “I useter think so once,” observed
old Dan, the sleeper-cutter, reflectively, “but
wot with the ’eadaclies next mornm an —er
—other things, it ain’t no good ter yeh,
Missis: it ain' no good ter yeh.”

“Hasen” : I’ve heard the best Billingsgate
of a London taxi-driver who considered him-
self under-tipped.
I’ve seen .and heard
an old-time Mel-
bourne cabby who
had been paid his
exact legal fare.
But for artistic
work my reference
goes to an under-
sized ’rickshaw boy
in Pedder-street,
Hongkong. He had
just dropped his
shafts. From the
vehicle stepped a
portly Eurasian,
ringed and jewelled
an d clothed i n
ultra - European
fashion. Without:
a glance at the
panting, sweating
boy lie handed over
a small silver coin,
wlii c h possibly
squared with his
liability but not
with the other’s
expectations. For
a moment the
human pony stood
motionless,, glaring
from the coin in
his hand to the fat
back of his fare.
Then he spat. No-
thing more. Just
spat squarely and
largely on the
shadow of the re-
tiring lordly one.
Spat “with expres-
sion.” Beside it
the finest efforts of that old-time cabby
seemed mere childish petulance.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : Some queer sweethearting was
mentioned to one Solomon, S.M., and several
Solomons, J’s.P., at a Melbourne court the
other day. The middle-aged cavalier used
to take his second choice to the grave of his
first helpmate, there to read her religious
poetry and selections from the love-letters
of the departed. This, according to the girl,
was the sole dissipation of their courting
days, except regular churchgoing—the gloomy
swain even declined to take her to a Sunday-
school concert lest he should be accused of
indulging in reckless and unseemly gaiety
within 18 months of his bereavement. The
lady, who appeared as defendant in the case,
declared that she regarded the estrangement
as merely a temporary one, due to her hav-
. ing demanded some brighter entertainment;
being still engaged, in her own opinion, she
declined to return the engagement-ring and
sundry other jewellery. The plaintiff deep-
ened the gloom that hung around his latest
love affair by mentioning that the jewels had
all been worn by the dear departed, and de-
clared, with tears in his voice, that this w r as
why he wanted them back. The Solomons, S.M.
and J’s.P., possibly wondered why a bright-
faced girl should want to remain attached
to the dejected mourner and his wife’s jewel-
lery, but decided that, as she still maintained
her readiness to accompany the plaintiff to
the altar, she was entitled to keep his pre-
eonjugal gifts.
THE STERN REBUKE.
“What, did you say when he told you that awful smoking-room story?”
“Oh, I just pinched him good-bye and said “This is no place for Birdie.' ”
“Billy See”: This was another case of
precipitate matrimony. Away back in the
’eighties a Ballarat business man with no
conjugal responsibilities went on his
periodic razzlc. Towards the end of the week
he awoke one morning to find another head
on the pillow. “Who the deuce are you?”
lie asked bewilderedly. “Oh, it’s all right,”
he was assured. “I’m your wife. We were
married yesterday. There’s the certificate
on the dressing-table.” She had been the
new barmaid at his favorite pub, and, though
all his life he denied any remembrance of
the wedding ceremony, the lady lived to be-
come Mayoress of Ballarat on the strength
of it.
* * * *
“Stockwhip”: Some of us have queer ideas
of a joke. A motor-cyclist was riding fast
in the dark to Oakey, a township between
Toowoomba and Helidon. to get medicine for
a sick man. Someone had thrown a tem-
porary barbed-wire fence across the road, and
the wheelman, running into it in the dark,
had his throat cut fatally from ear to ear.
And that’s not the first case of the kind in
the district. Years ago a bank manager at
Toowoomba was riding back from a bush
dance along a road he had traversed a
hundred times, when his horse met a fence
which had not been there some hours before
—and was not there when he- was picked up
unconscious some hours later, with a frac-
tured skull.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp” : Fate was in a kindly
mood with a Melbourne man who thought
a dip in the Yarra would provide him with
an exit from his troubles. A passer-by fished
him out before he had gone down for the last
time and took him home; and the would-be
suicide presently regained consciousness to
find that his rescuer was a scliool-chum of
his English boyhood. The latter didn’t stop
at saving his old friend’s life; he proved
to be in a position to give him employment
and a fresh start as well. The pair thus
strangely brought together had not seen one
another for over 20 years; the rescuer had
spent some years in America before estab-
lishing himself in business in Melbourne;
the other man had come to N.S.W. as a lad,
and had wandered about the world consider-
ably, his experiences including some service
with the A.I.F. before ill-luck and hard
times had got him down.

“Griffith Moses” writes a page of history:
According to so much as is known, the heir pre-
sumptive to the throne of Cashmere (what there is
of it) won the real or alleged affections of Mrs.
Robinson, wife of a one-time butcher and book-
maker, and was found with her, by an elaborate
adjustment of events, in circumstances for which
“compromising” is a feeble expression. The finder
exhibited alleged fury and alleged that he was
Robinson, when he was really a stranger with no
place in the picture at all. This person was described
by one party as “the most complete scoundrel
unhung.” The hasty and rattled nigger parted with
two cheques for £150,000 each to pay one man
for the wrong done to another man’s wife, ami one
of the cheques was negotiated. That was the deluded
Asiatic’s last personal appearance. A bank account
was opened in London by the complete scoundrel
and a legal accomplice, so the story goes, in the name
of “C. Robinson,” and the robust cheque was paid in
and collected. Then the genuine Robinson received
£25,000 for moral depreciation of his wife, though
how he found out that she was depreciated is less
clear than it might be.
Years rolled on and it somehow came to the
injured husband’s ears that the cheque which was
made out in his name, or in a similar name, but
which he had never seen, was for £150,000, and ne
sued the bank for the £125,000 difference.
His attitude seemed to be that the institution should
have known, by looking at its new customers, that
neither of them was Robinson. A jury rehabilitated
the Robinsons’ character, or at least the cabled
narrative points that way, but refused Robinson the
£ 125,000. The colored gent.’s aide-de-camp, whose
extradition was sought, declares that, so far from
making a fortune by joining in the fraud, lie spent a
pile of money in defending the interests of his
princely employer, and received nothing but in-
gratitude that was blacker than his fellow-subject.
The latter remains torpid, and shows no desire Jo
go to England and clear his own good name or
anybody else’s, and get his picture in all the comic
papers.
The fate of the second cheque for £150,000 is the
subject of conflicting explanations. A solicitor
who was leaving the country hurriedly was inter-
cepted and refused bail. Robinson was last hen <i
ox as appealing for a new trial, though the <>ld one
is said to have cost £30,000 or more. Who paid
the £30,000, or gave his IOU for it, is uncertain —
like many other matters.

“H.E.R.”: I’m looking forward to New
Year’s Eve. There’s a wild mob in my
suburban street who got “pinky” drunk at
this year’s birth and ushered it in with noise
and hilarity. My roof was bombarded with
road metal and other bric-a-brac. When
I expostulated a further volley hit the top
HEE-HAW!
DORIS: “Listen to me for a moment .”
MAURICE: “I’m all ears.”
DORIS: “Well, then, stop braying, donkey!”
and I retired from the argument. In glori-
ous New Year sunshine I climbed on to my
roof to remove the debris. Among the stones,
tins, old boots, etc., I found a gold watch
and chain. The timepiece was still going
and showing accurate time.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Angora Government lias taken a disgraceful
revenge upon the Aga Khan for his attitude towards
the Kemalists in relation to the Khalifat. It las
instructed certain Turkish newspapers to identify
‘Mr. A.’ with the Aga Khan in order to discredit
the Moslem leader among Turkish Moslems. The
Turkish newspapers are publishing the lie.” — Cable.
The Aga Khan is a Sultan swell
And a sort of Moslem Pope as well —
There are swarthy millions who bow the head
Whenever his sacred name is said —
And a Prince whose loyalty none disputes,
With a lien on eleven-gun salutes ;
Fifty, to boot —though I’m well aware
His age may be neither here nor there ;
Still, hardly the sort of giddy guy
For a co-re.’s rOle to qualify.
Yet they seek to fit on his sober pate
The cap of the rackety “Potentate,”
The gayest dog in the Kajali clan,
Which is surely tough on the Aga Khan.
When the Turkish Crescents and Evening Stars
Come wet from the press to the packed bazaars,
Did the Faithful reel when their eyes beheld
The tale that the wicked headlines yelled?
When to ends of Islam the whisper ran
That “Mr. A.” was the Aga Khan?
Did turbaned Arabs dissolve in tears
As their worlds were crumbling about their ears?
Did gaunt Moors start, under suns that bake,
And sob as their trusting hearts would break ?
Did they toll, to a mournful rhythm set,
The bells of mosque and of minaret
When the Ottoman press suborned began
To daub the soot on the Aga Khan?
Or—what’s maybe worse —were there grins
and winks
And digital digs in costal thinks?
Did gags like “Cherchez la femme” come quick
In Hindustani or Arabic?
BY PROXY.
“Once I swore off everything for two years—just like that.”
“My! What a strong will you must have!”
“No, darling, I haven't — but. my wife has.”
Did sinners of lowlier degree,
Chaps not as strict as they ought to be
Their human passions to curb and stem,
Feel Paradise mightn’t be barred to them
If a Caliph’s self to the primrose way
From the Koran-pointed path might stray
At a woman’s beck, for a moment’s whim,
With no Jehannum to yawn for him?
Wherever the canard’s flight you scan
They have played it low on the Aga Khan.
But whithersoever, you know, we fare
There’s few that haven’t a cross to bear.
The best and noblest, like you and me,
Are never secure from calumny.
So when next the mischief-makers try
To queer your pitch with some shameful fie,
To crumple the flower of your blameless life
By hints about somebody clse’s wife,
To spin some fiction outrageous how
You were drunk as Chloe or David’s sow,
There may be a morsel of solace when
You reflect ’tis the common lot of men,
And you can’t have more to complain of than
The staid and impeccable Aga Khan.

“Wing Forward”: The cabled story of
Professor Gilbert Murray’s success in read-
ing the thoughts of Earl Balfour recalls a
somewhat similar happening in less exalted
circles in Brisbane years ago. To be pre-
cise, the “reading” took place in a private
bar late in the evening after an inter-State
football match. An old reprobate with long
white hair, locally known as “the Professor,”
entered on his usual game of cadging drinks
and shillings by “thought reading.” A crack
Queensland wing three-quarter of those days.
Yorkie O’Shea, accosted him with: “Look
here, you old fraud, here's ten bob if you
can tell me what I'm thinking.” “My boy.”
said the Professor, taking the other's hand
and gazing hard into his eyes, “you're think-
ing what an infernal old rogue I am.” Yorkie
paid over without a murmur.

“Percy Pawnticket” : Tasmania’s new Gov-
ernor, Sir James O’Grady, has been claimed
by an ancient prospector in Westralia as
his long-lost son. The veteran asserts that
he lost sight of his wife and son during a
strike in Lancashire, and that the misfortune
caused him to wander far afield. My
sympathies are with his Ex., for I myself
once picked up a spare father in Ashburton
(M.L.). He asked me my name, and in-
vited me to have a drink; then he refused
to believe that my name was Pawnticket,
and told me that I was his reprobate son
who had run away from home at the age of
14, and nearly broke my poor old mother's
heart. Between drinks he recalled scenes of
my childhood, and would have wept on my
bosom had I not removed it quietly whilst
lie was immersed in his beer. His attach-
ment for me developed so rapidly that next
day, when our company (I was an actor
then) left Ashburton, I only avoided his

embraces by making a last-moment dash for
the train; and even then he chased the cara-
van out of the station roaring wrathfully.
After that he was a standing affliction as
long as I stayed in the South Island. Some-
times he was drunk when he turned up un-
expectedly, and sometimes he was sober; but
he was always a nuisance.
“The Dip” : “Snowy” Simpson, hanged at
Bong Bay for the double murder at Appin
in March, got a rough spin all round from
the world when all is said. His early oppor-
tunities were very limited; he married when
little more than a boy, obtained a divorce a
few months later, and never quite recovered
from his matrimonial mishap. Wounded at
the Front, he was afterwards prostrated by a
severe bout of fever. Coming back to Aus-
tralia, he found himself in Gong Bay Gaol,
and while there nearly cashed his checks
from pneumonic ’flu. His attack of fever
left him unable to withstand drink, and it
needed only a couple of pots of beer or a
stiff whisky to put him off his balance. He
wasn’t a very sensitive soul, but he furi-
ously resented anybody referring to his bald-
ness, and while awaiting trial on the murder
charge he frequently cursed the newspaper
men who mentioned his loss of hair. Prior
to going to Cordeaux Dam he was motor-
mad ; liis obsession was to obtain a covered-
in lorry in which he could tour the State,

paying his way by odd jobs cn route. The
prevailing opinion is that Simpson deli-
berately murdered Guy Clift and Flynn, but
those who know him as the writer did find
it hard to dismiss his plea that the shooting
was accidental and not intentional It is
quite likely that Simpson was endeavoring
to get rid of his revolver—he would have
got a “sixer” for having it in his possession
—and that Flynn mistook his action.

“Harold Hardupp”: The sly-grog possi-
bilities of the motor-car are bothering the
Melbourne licensing police. This form of
enterprise has been going on for years, and
there are big pi’ofits in it. Sunday being the
busy day, although
warm nights are
good for trade, too.
Holiday resorts are
the most remun-
erative fields, and
there is little diffi-
culty in selling out
several cargoes of
beer at 2s. a bottle.
At Mentone re-
cently a couple of
John Hops got on
the trail of one of
these whirling sly-
groggeries; and,
although unable to
overtake it, suc-
ceeded in glimpsing
the number. But.
when they looked
up the registration
records they found
the Said number
belonged to the car
of a highly-respect-
able medical man,
whose conveyance,
wh e n inspected,
was totally differ-
ent from the
wheeled sliant y.
The occupants of
the latter are now
wanted for two dif-
ferent breaches of
the law.
“Oxmcad’ : Touching the police practice
of chaining up obstreperous drunks who dis-
turb the King’s peace at up-country race-
meetings (B. 4/12/’24), there is at least one
district in Australia where this method of
restraint is unlikely to be ever tried again.
That is Roebourne (W.A.). Nearly 30 years
ago a race-meeting was held at a place called
Tableland. Things were booming then in
this part of Groperland’s nor’-west, what
between gold finds and pearling operations,
and the liquor flowed freely, until finally the
lone constable sought to assert his authority
and the majesty of the law by arresting a
visitor who had become more aggressively
inebriated than his fellows, and attaching the
cantankerous toper to a handy log. Pre-
sently somebody dropped a lighted match and
a bit of a bush-fire started, fanned by a
strong breeze. The crowd was on the other
side of the course when so'mebody recollected
the prisoner. I think he was alive when the
would-be rescue party reached him, but there
was an inquest afterwards,
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: Apropos “Schnorrer’s” gum-
trees in Palestine (B. 38/32/’24), I have met
the gum in many places about the world, but
the most unexpected encounter was on the
Dieng Plateau, Java, 9000 ft. up, and within
a few stones-tlirow of the equator. The
plateau is the crater of a volcano which blew
the froth off its final pint during the Hindu
period, perhaps 3200 years back. Twenty
years ago the Dutch started repairing the
long-outstanding devastation with Australian
blue-gums. The lovely trees stand straight
and tall all up the mountain-side, and their
lower branches provide fuel for the miserable
tribe which inhabits the plateau. The
chimneyless houses, smoking at night from
every pore, are an extraordinary sight. The
old remedy for ’flu, of inhaling the fumes
from eucalyptus in a jug of hot water, was
nothing to putting one’s head inside those
dwellings, where red-eyed natives squat half
their lives round heaps of smouldering gum-
leaves.
* * * *
“Edmac”: All the early Westralian gold-
fields towns had race meetings, the in-
gredients for a successful gathering (except
punters) being imported from the coast, viz.,
horses, owners, trainers, bookmakers, spielers,
whisperers, confidence men and pickpockets.
Many of these preferred to travel on the
never, and on this occasion the railway
people were determined to discourage the
practice. The train was pulled up just be-
fore the Coolgardie station was reached and
a search commenced by Ginger Mick, the
departmental sleuth, for travellers without
tickets. As he approached one man jumped
from the train and broke for the bush. After
him went Ginger, and the passengers en-
joyed a ding-dong contest. Rut at last Mick
nailed his man. “Wotcher chasing me for?”
demanded the pursued truculently, as soon
as ho had recovered some of his breath. “I
want yer name fer not havin’ a ticket, ’
panted the pursuer. “But I’ve pot a ticket,’’
said the sun, producing it. Meantime, on
the town side of the train, a choice collec-
tion of magsmen, without a “brief” amongst
them, had scattered helter-skelter for
sanctuary.
* * * *
“Hamer”: The intrusive Eve is abroad
nowadays even in the furthest-out shores of
Port Phillip. One spot well south of Men-
tone has long been the Sabbath retreat of a
band of St. Kilda sun-bathing yachtsmen;
their practice is to pitch a tent-fly on a
shelving bit of turf, attire themselves lightly
in cocoanut oil and bask the pleasant hours
away. But picnic-parties have discovered
the spot. On a recent Sunday, getting warn-
ing, just in time as they thought, of the
approach of a bevy of merry damsels along
the beach, three of the perturbed sunbathers
bethought themselves an ingenious screen.
They got on their knees suddenly, and with
Saturday’s newspaper in front of them
appeared to be keenly interested in the news,
hugging the delusion that they were thus well
covered. And so they were in front; the
only contretemps was that another picnic-
party happened to lob along simultaneously
from the opposite direction.

(( Hyver ’: While travelling the world as a
six-bob-a-day tourist” I received very few
letters from Aussie; I was a lonelier soldier
than most of those who advertised the fact.
Vi hen I was convalescing at Wareham Camp
my cobbers would read portions of the let-
ters they had just got from lady friends;
and they insisted on regarding my failure to
receive any such delectable missives as clear
proof that I was a dud where woman was
concerned. Becoming desperate at their gibes
I wrote a ten-page letter, signed it “Yours
till eternity, Gertie.” addressed the en-
velope to myself, and carefully posted
the packet of endearments at the local post
office'. Then T sat back to await events,
dropping a casual hint or two about my
girl. My luck was dead out; when two
weeks had passed I realised that the 00 per
cent, efficient post office had failed for once.
I always wondered who received that artless
tribute of affection, but I was too broken-
spirited ever to repeat the experiment.

My lass is a ladj r who’s proud as she’s beautiful,
She knows her full value, she’s full of disdain.
She thinks a mere man should be humble and dutiful,
But he who talks duty to her may be slain.
It’s cn'y her love and her high-minded charity
That prompt all her actions, yet somehow they lit
Thrice better than hers —-oh, I see it. with clarity!
Who, loving not duty, is driven by it.
My lass is a lady who’s fond of frivolity,
And the wide world was made for the dance of her
feet.
She wants the whole earth, or at least all its jollity;
And she thinks all well paid by her smile —which
is sweet.
And .vet all the good is so worked in her fashioning,
She would give up the world if a beggar should call
With a tale of sheer suffering, her soft heart im-
passioning—
She stoops to be kind to the humblest of all.
My lass is a lady. It seems like audacity
To think I should hope still to make her my own;
For where shall I find in my purse’s capacity
Enough for her slippers—apart from her throne?
Vet love has strange magic; the thought of my
meagreness
From my mind when my arms are around her will
pass.
Oh, proud she may be and for life full of eagerness :
But I thank my good stars that my lady’s a lass!

Stafford Bird, who went west in the Speck
the other day at the age of 85, had one of
the few really fine old-fashioned beards to be
found in politics. He had put in 42 years
in the Assembly and the Council when he
retired last May. In the boom days of the
’eighties the Bird-Fysh combination counted
for a lot in Tasmanian politics. Before he
went into the sordid game he was a Congre-
gational minister and a preacher of note. His
wife was given to good works even after he
had left the pulpit, and spent much of her
time in toiling for the welfare of prisoners
in the gaols.
South Aus. Assembly, generally a well-
behaved body, had a sensation when it was
formally reported to the House that Butter-
field, Minister for Lands, had blacked the
eye of Moseley, its oldest member, aged 75.
The blow followed an argument in the lava-
tory over a previous debate, and Mclnnes,
the Speaker, was the only other person pre-
sent. By general consent the matter was
left to him, after Denny, for the Ministry,
and Barwell, for the Opposition, had discussed
the legal side of an assault outside the House
though within the precincts. Butterfield at
once expressed his deep degret, and next day
the Speaker closed the incident by a formal
reprimand—with Barwell still arguing that
it ought to be done by a Resolution of the
House.
From a dentist in Dunedin to instructor
to the air forces of Marshal Chang Tso-lin is
one of the strange moves that the fortunes
of war ordained for a Maorilander, Captain
W. Mackenzie. The captain, who previously
saw service in S’Africa, left with the M.L.
Expeditionary Force in 1914, and after Gal-
lipoli and France went on to China, where
he is now located at Mukden, instructing
young China in the new way of going aloft.
Many of the Vic. mining men who heard
the call of the W.A. goldfields in the roaring
’nineties were old pupils of the Ballarat
School of Mines. Recently a few of these,
and others who have followed them west-
ward, remembered the man, still living at
Ballarat, who gave them a good part of their
technical training, and subscribed for the
bust of Professor Alfred Mica Smith which
was unveiled in the Council Chamber of the
School of Mines a week ago. Acknowledging
the eulogiums that came his way at the un-
veiling ceremony, the veteran Professor men-
tioned that it was 51 years to the hour since
he had landed in Melbourne at the age of
29 to take up his long-distance instructional
career. His first Australian job was with
the Bendigo School of Mines; he went to
Ballarat in October, 1881.
Canon T. A. Colebrook, who died recently
at Camperdown (Vic.), was revered by
squatterdom and idolised by the under-dog.
In the ’eighties he landed in Sydney, an
English public schoolboy, with £5OO in his
pocket. He sailed his yacht, shook hands
with the aristocracy, chummed in with
Domainers and then drifted inland, doing
boundary-riding on the Monaro plains and
teaching in bush schools. Later, with an
Australian wife and a young family, he
crossed the Murray, and did service in Davis
and Graham’s tannery in Buninyong—the
place where Victorian gold was first dis-
covered. He shook things up in the Ancient
Village as editor of the local Thunderer;
then shifted on to the Ballan Times, and
later bought out the Gordon Advertiser,
pedalling between the two offices on a push
bike. He was the handy-man of the district.
If a charity minstrel show wanted a corner-
man, Colebrook filled the bill. A blind-
people’s concert party came and a bullock
died on the road the same afternoon. Cole-
brook collected the bank-manager, the school-
master, and picks and shovels, buried the
quadruped, collected 10s. from the shire
council, and handed it over to the blind
people. It was Bishop Thornton who found
him helping an over-worked, under-paid par-
son, and roped him into the Church.
A couple united in the “holy bonds” the
other day at Gympie (Q.) totalled 167 years
between them. The bridegroom was 85, and
the bride three years younger.
James Gunson, Mayor of Auckland
(M.L.), is still a young man; at little over
30 he was not only Mayor, hut Harbor Board
chairman and president of the Chamber of
Commerce. Abrupt and taciturn, Jimmy is
not made for popularity, but the public faith
in his ability to straighten out a tangle is
unlimited. An ardent prohibitionist, he was
the leader of the band of business men who
nearly brought off the great water-waggon
success a few years ago.
The captain of the mother ship of the
Norwegian whaling expedition, the Sir James
Clark Ross, died on the vessel 15deg. from
the South Pole, as wirelessed to Port Chal-
mers, on December 8. Captain C. A. Larsen
was a Norwegian, aged 63, and he had led
several expeditions to South Georgia, receiv-
ing a decoration from the King of Norway
in recognition of his services; he was the
first to develop the whaling industry in that
inhospitable corner of the world. One of bis
sons is a junior officer on the ship. The
captain’s wife and niece came to Port Chal-
mers on the whaler and remained there; they
will return to Norway with the body, which
has been efnbalmed down in the frozen south.

“The Dip” on a gaol governor:—
Steele, superintendent of the Long Bay Penitentiary
and Deputy-Controller of N.S.W. Prisons, looked to
be a certainty for the head job, but political intrigu-
ing may rob him of something to which he has
undeniable claims. A self-taught man, he is widely
read, unlike most men who have started in the
prisons service as a warder. He knows the classics,
ancient and modern, and can chat about Plutarch
and Masefield almost as well as about criminals and
gaols. He is a strict disciplinarian, but none the less
fair because of his firmness. For this reason most of the
prisoners in his charge respect him, although there
is a disgruntled minority prone to regard him as
the martinet of the old regime. Steele would un-
doubtedly be an asset to the State as Controller-
General.
Sergeant Richard Glenny, just dead at
Albert Park (Vic.), aged 76, shared in
the attack on the Kelly gang at Glen-
rowan, and received mention for bravery.
Subsequently he was in charge of various
police districts around Melbourne.
The two oldest inhabitants of the N.S.W.
nominee House are both doctors —Creed and
Mackellar. Their appointments date back to
September 8, 1885. These two lost a fellow-
appointee of that date when Henry Moses
STORKEY, V.C., at the Bar: he was lately
appointed Crown Prosecutor for the
South- West District of N. S. Wales.
resigned last year at the age of 90—he felt
he was getting a bit too old. Creed, who
once sat for the Upper Hunter (1572-74)
has the best claim on the fathership, for
Mackellar’s membership hasn’t been continu-
ous. C. .T. Roberts, who has been granted
leave of absence until the end of the session,
is the third-oldest; he dates from 1890. He got
a C.M.G. —for keeping a pub at the Corner
of Market and George streets, it was said,
but perhaps really for being Parkes’s P.M.G.
and good friend. Among Labor nominees
N. J. Buzacott, .T. Hepher and James Wilson
are the ancients: they have worn their rail-
way passes since 1899.
George Burston, an old-time cycling ex-
port, passed out in Melbourne the other day.
He was one of the earliest importers of the
useful wheel, and in the late ’eighties lie
and H. R. Stokes did a world tour on “bone-
shakers”—one of his amusing experiences
was a race with a reindeer in Greenland.
The old rattler is still kept as a memento
by the family.
Died at Mbsman, Sydney, at 67, C. F.
Warden, son of David Warden, of the Croob-
yar estate, who settled in 1839 at Ulladulla,
South Coast, where the son was born. Edu-
cated at old Newington College, C. F. War-
den started life in the Commercial Bank of
Sydney, but resigned in ISSS and returned
to Ulladulla. He was one of the founders
of the Ulladulla Butter Co., and a provisional
director of the Coastal Farmers' Co-op.
Society, of which his brother, Wynter War-
den, M.L.C., is now chairman.
After 40 years as Prof, of Pathology at
Melbourne ’Varsity the knightly Harry Allen
lmj thrown up his job owing to continued
ill-health, and Peter McCallum, a Maoriland
Rhodes scholar, now patho. lecturer at Edin-
burgh, is to him.
It is seldom that the same obituary notice
fits two brothers almost exactly; yet the
record of James Bergin, who died a few
months back, would fit brother John, who
died at Parramatta (N.S.W.) recently. Both
were pioneers of the district and assisted
their father to establish the Granville woollen
mills. Both were intensely musical, both
published their melodies successfully, and
both wrote extensively about music. John
was 74 when he went to join James.
The Vic. railways have a plucky Anzac
in J. M. Barkland, a shorthand writer in the
district-superintendent’s office at Seymour,
who returned from the Front a cot case, hav-
ing mislaid part of his stomach somewhere in
France. He was declared “permanently in-
capacitated,” but, with a lofty disregard for
medical pronouncements, rubs along in his
old job much the same as usual, except that
he has to wear a steel corset.
Thomas Crombie has realised Captain
Kettle’s ambition of satisfactorily transfer-
ring from the sea to the soil. Crombie was
on saltwater for over 4u years, and a cap-
tain lor 30. During a typhoon his ship lost
18 sails in half an hour, and the steersman
was blown into the rigging still holding a
couple of pieces of the broken wheel. To-day
at Mylor, in the Adelaide hills, the captain
has a fine fruit garden, 500 leghorns, some
dairy cows and a vegetable garden.
Williamstown (Vic.) lost a marine nota-
bility when Captain Alfred Easton went aloft
a few days ago. He w r as the pilot who was
in charge of the Renown when she came into
Port Phillip.
Sydney’s new City fathers: —
Eleven of the 26 are new, although bootmaker
Jackson, M.L.A., has been in the Council before,
and Stanley Cole, master carrier and president of vlie
Local Government Assoc., has been Mayor of Glebe.
Jackson, Cole and Sam Walder, a maker of tents,
are the only new ’uns who are Civic Reformers, the
remaining eight being Labor. Camperdown supplies
two of them: E. C. O’Dea, the Shop Assistants’ Union
secretary and candidate in a Labor pre-selection
ballot; and Jack Mostyn, of the Electrical Trades
Union. This ward previously returned Lord Mayor
Gilpin and Mallett, a fellow “breakaway.” Bligh
contributed another two: C. Roberts (Storemen and
Packers) and Arthur Lawes, who as a boy worked
in the electric ity department of the Council. Another
ex-Council employee is Ernie Glasgow, who represents
Belmore along with the new Lord Mayor. This
ward includes the labyrinth of alleys inhabited by
Chinese, gaolbirds and painted ladies and known as
the “acre of mystery.” Brainston, the expelled A.L.P.
alderman, used to represent the district, but he went
to Macquarie and was licked. Flinders —formerly
held by W. J. Walker, who stood again and lost, and
J. R. Charlton, who wouldn’t recontest it —has, be-
sides Walder, Frank Green, an agent, to fight for
its grievances. Terence O’Brien, hotelkeeper, had
little difficulty in getting home with W. P. Fitz-
gerald, ex-Lord Mayor and grocer, for Gipps. Lam-
bert, who was one of the members of the old
Denison Ward that was cut out by the Boundary
Commissioners, did not stand, and English, the
other member, went over to Pyrmont. Here he took
the place of W. Holdsworth, who runs a pub near
the Domain, and who was elected with W. Clapham,
a ’Loo barber, for the new Denison Ward, which was
carved out of three other wards. ' General Rosen-
thal and R. W. Caldwell, who used to sit for Bligh,
went west in this area, where wharfies and loyalists
conduct battles royal. Notable among the defeated
were Scott Fell and Dick Meagher.
There must be something conducive to
longevity in the Williamstown (Vic.) air.
At a recent social re-union two of the guests
were over the 90 mark and octogenarians
were quite numerous. One of these, George
Professor BALD-
WIN SPENCER,
of Melbourne.
Spotswood, was
born in the district
85 years ago and
claims to have been
the first arrival by
that route. There
recently died in the
seaside village Mrs.
Hannah Morison,
who conducted a
little Old Curiosity
Shop concern to
the end. She was
85 and had run the
business since
early womanhood.
The smile on Tom Mutch’s face these
days suggests that he is visioning the day
when he will step into Fuller’s shoes. As
Lang beat him by only one vote in the
election for the N.S.W. Labor leadership
a few months back, his chance looks rosy.
Mutch has been a shearer and rouseabout,
a journalist on the Worker, president of
the N.S.W. branch of the A.J.A., and a
member of the Anti-Conscription 1916 execu-
tive that threw out Holman, Hughes and
the brains of the movement; and J. 11.
Page, who had represented Botany for 10
years, lost the seat to him for telling the
electors to vote “Yes.” Mutch was Minister
for Education in the Storey and Dooley
Governments, and earned admiration by in-
sisting on a closer study of Australian sub-
jects in the schools. Peter Loughlin might
cut a better figure as Premier; the other
is the more popular man with the younger
members of the party.
HIS NAME IS NOT MACPHERSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If battle-axes were in vogue
As in the days serene and simple
When every knight could slay a rogue
For honor of his lady’s dimple,
Then I would slay three times a day
A man whose name is not Maepherson,
Who tells the oldest tales I know
With dreadful mirth akin to woe,
And tells them in the loud first person.
He did the things that Noah said
Were done by Shem when they went arking;
He saw the sights on which the dead
For countless years had ceased remarking.
His babe and wife have made of life,
According to his bold narration,
In all respects the very thing
The played-out jester told the king
When he was drunk beyond elation.
Maepherson—no, that’s not his name —
Has told me as his own invention
Tales that were published without shame
By other folk of some pretension
As long ago as when the flow
Of Tiber saw things that disgust us,
When persons of barbaric wit
Used their obscenity to bit
The dull successors of Augustus.
It takes all sorts to make a world ;
And in these days of large compassion
When League-long covenants are unfurled
The battle-axe is out of fashion.
The heavy train snores through the rain—
He tells the tale how someone tricked him ;
And though his name is not Maepherson
But that of quite another person,
The fact remains that I’m the victim.
Oh, happy are the peaceful dead!
It takes all sorts to fill a coffin.
I wish the hearse were well ahead
That fate has built to take him off in.
I can but sigh. His dreary eye
And drearier “I” are things I smash on.
I would pay twice my income-tax
For one hour with a battle-axe,
If such tools were again in fashion !

It is surprising how different a cool, steady CENTURY breeze makes you feel

“Moe”: A “boy” employed at the Native
Hospital in Rabaul was observed to be distressed
about something. Asked what was wrong, he replied
that his brother in Eitape, seven or eight hundred
miles distant, had died that morning. As there was
no possible way in which he could have had com-
munication with that place, he was laughed at by
the doctor, a stranger in the country, and told not
to be a fool. Nevertheless, when the first schooner
arrived from Eitape, three weeks later, one of the
boys in her crew brought a message to the hospital
boy that his brother was dead, and a comparison of
dates showed that the death had taken place on the
day on which the native in Rabaul had informed the
doctor of what had happened. Another instance
occurred at a station in an out-of-the-way district of
New Britain, where there were a number of police
bo3's from Buka, in the Solomons. One morning the
district officer noticed that the six or seven Buka
boys were all discussing amongst themselves some-
thing of great interest. He was told that during
the night there had been fighting at the village from
which most of them hailed, and that a number of
their friends and relations had been killed. As in
the other case, it was later learned that what the
natives had described had taken place, and that
their information had been correct to the smallest
detail. The station in question had no wireless.
Such instances could be produced by the score.
One noticeable feature is that the native who receives
the news is always certain of the accuracy of it,
just as if he had seen the incident happen with his
own eyes. If it is thought transmission, it is entirely
Involuntary and the natives have no control over it,
being quite unable to send or receive messages at
will. Tests that would take too long to describe
here have made this clear beyond a shadow of doubt.

“G.A.M.”: Two young men from Con-
dobolin, who had several times fished in a deep
hole in the Lachlan without success, though they
could see plenty of fish, determined to use a little
dynamite. Accordingly they filled a small bottle with
explosive, and, putting a fuse through the cork, threw
it in, forgetting, however, to attach a weight to sink
it. Their dog, thinking to fetch it out, plunged in.
seized it and made for the bank. As the fuse was
slowly burning down, the scared fishermen took to
their heels and ran as they never ran before, shouting
to the dog to “drop it.’’ The faster they ran the
quicker the dog ran, and he was gaining on them
at every stride until the explosion took place. Then
there was no more dog—only a mess and two
exhausted anglers who had gained a little experience.
“Lily-Beale”: A recent heavy storm at
Murwillumbah (N.S.W.) was responsible for the
death of four valuable cows. The animals were graz-
ing with their heads through a wire fence when it
was struck by lightning, the current killing the
animals instantly. 1 remember a similar case a
few years back at Euroka station, near Walgett
(N.S.W.), where the victim was a man struck
whilst, getting through a fence. Friends found him,
hours afterwards, a charred mass, with a leg on
either side of the wires.
“Sax”: I’ve not hoard of platypus as near
as the Melbourne morgue, but a doctor, formerly
in charge at Yarra Bend Asylum, who knows a platy-
pus from a water-rat, sometimes saw them there when
he was fishing at dusk. Snakes were plentiful near the
asylum, six or seven usually being despatched every
year when the last of the crop was being cut, as
well as a fair number at other times.
* * * *
“Vanikoro”: In some discussions about
the spread of plants in the South
Seas there has been a tendency
to overlook the work of the
whalers who swarmed over the
Pacific in the early part of the
nineteenth century—in many cases
far ahead of both the missionary
and the trader. The introduction
of the Lima- or butter-bean into
Madagascar is an illustration in
point. This bean, a native of
Peru, was introduced by the
Spaniards into California. About
1864 some New Bedford (U.S.A.;
whalers established a station at
St. Augustin’s Bay, on the west
coast of Madagascar, and bartered
their ship’s stores for meat and
fruit. Amongst the things thev
gave in exchange were some Lima-
bcans. These flourished to such
an extent that Lima-beans are now
the chief export of the west coast
of Madagascar, whence thousands
of tons are shipped each year.
“Vanikoro”; Amongst the weirdest and
most unhandy weapons ever invented by man are the
12ft. basket-hilted wooden swords made by the
natives of the Sepik River (New Guinea). They look
like ceremonial weapons, but it is said that they
are used for actual fighting—not, however, in tribal
warfare, but for duels between personal enemies.
Made of hard wood they are sharpened point and
edge, but it takes both strength and knack to do
any damage with them.
* * * *
“R. 8.”: A N.S.W. South Coast native
once gave me the truth about Binghi’s creed. I found
him crouching over my campfire at two in the
morning, after he had come in from deep-sea fishing.
God with the South Coast natives is Mirrooral, or the
One Above, but there is a secret name for the
Supreme Being which is never told to women nor,
before the bora initiation, to men. The soul after
death rises, and, if it is a pure soul, reaches the
place of comfort which all pure spirits attain; but
the impure spirit cannot ascend that high, so the
aboriginal Hell is everlasting solitude, since in the
scale of varying merit no two spirits reach the
same altitude. There is no forgiveness for sin. If
you sin you are damned eternally, since the spirit
cannot be purified. That is why aboriginals always
die unrepentant. The story of the creation is that
Mirrooral just thought, and his thoughts became
things. He wanted a man, and his will took effect.
He thought a fire was needed to warm man at night,
and there was a fire. Tlun shade was desired, so
the One Above willed a native cherry-tree to give
man not only shade but fruit as well. Still, man
w-as not happy. So Mirrooral willed a little bird
with a red breast to chirp about the tree. But
man was still discontented—and then he willed
CHRISTMAS DAY WITH THE OLD FOLKS.
woman. Mirrooral used to visit the couple and
converse with them. He did not talk and he did
not sing, but he used to “yungatbaal.” What that
meant the old blackfellow could not explain. Later
on they had descendants of different color, who
could not agree, so Mirrooral caused the rebels, who
thought themselves superior to the others, to con-
gregate on a point of land, and when they were all
together he chopped the point off, and it became
an island which drifted away. “Some day,’’ Mirrooral
said, “they shall come back.’’ And Binghi pointed
out to me that it came true, for the superior people
were the whites. He explained that the cause of
people becoming white was too close inbreeding. A
lot more did my old Binghi friend tell me which has
become indistinct with the passing of 30 years. But
1 remember that the next day the old man returned to
me in a state of great anxiety, because he said he
had told me things which were secrets, and should
only be told to one who had gone through the bora
rites ; and he asked me to join the aboriginal religion
so that it might not matter. But the bora, which
would have provided me with much copy, did not
come off.
* * ■* *
“Cartot”: That some varieties of plants
possess at least a modified power of reasoning by
what is known as “trial and error” seems undoubted.
Recently a friend painted the upper half of a shed
on which was growing a small climbing vine. When
the first tendril reached the edge of the wet paint, it
kept straight on and became caught in the sticky
surface, with the result that it withered and died.
The later tendrils changed their course, seemingly
to avoid the paint, and most of them started to grow
in a direction parallel with the edge of the painted
area. They kept on doing so even after the paint
had become dry. Then some of them apparent!}
discovered that the upper portion of the shed was
no longer dangerous and started to extend their
growth over it. The marvellous thing about such
phenomena is the manner in which the plant ascer-
tains that certain changes have taken place around
it, indicating that there are depths in biology that
man has not yet even started to sound.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Somebody—let’s hope it is
Home and Territories Pearce—deserves a cheer for
two “national reserves” just proclaimed in the
Northern Territory, one in the Coburg Peninsula and
the other in the Macdonnell Ranges. The Peninsula
site is a typical tropical area, but that in the
Macdonnell Ranges is unique, consisting of the two
famous “palm valleys” on the Finke River. These
contain palms and cycads found nowhere else, and
accepted by botanists as the survivals of the original
Ccntralian vegetation. Animals and birds in plenty
haunt the permanently-watered area, which is near
the Hamiansburg German Mission, an institution
which has set Australians an example of what can
be clone in developing “the Dead Heart of Australia”
by people who decline to notice the deadness. 'The
new reserve is a place of chastened peace, where even
time loiters.
“Bad Australian”: I have seen hundreds
of growing eucalypts infested with white ants and
have found them operating in pumpkins and par-
snips as well as potatoes. But all this is ncgliblo
compared with the work of the Melville Island term-
ites, which ate up almost everything the first settlers
brought ashore. They devoured several bales of
shirts, 65 pairs of trousers, 23 smock frocks, leather
goods of all kinds and soldiers’ knapsacks, including
contents—they left nothing but buckles and razor
blades. Then they cleaned up the supply of sawn
timber, some ammunition boxes and a tent 30ft. long,
and, to complete the tribulations of the commandant,
they dropped into the cellar and got away with the
corks of two dozen of his special reserve claret.
“Claude do Tropic” : “The Rumpus” (B.
20/11/’24) is right—it is instinctive for a nigger to
kill. When I was a boy in the Gulf district (N.Q.)
my father adopted an aboriginal youngster he hail
found in one of Binghi’s deserted camps. Later on
this lad always accompanied him on shooting and
fishing jaunts into the bush. When 18 he said to
my father one morning that he knew where there was
a lagoon, the home of a surprising number of wild-
fowl. The dad knew the country well, and could
not understand how it was he had never seen this
lagoon before. More out of curiosity than anything
else he ordered the boy to lead him to this sports-

man’s Mecca. After-walking about eight miles under
a fierce tropical sun he decided to rest under a shady
ti ee, and was almost dozing when something prompted
him to turn around. The aboriginal youth, with a
heavy stick lifted in the air, was about to bash in
my father’s brains. Questioned later he said, “Some-
thing told me to kill you.”

And yet, I confess it, I’m still an old fool,

Last night I was dreaming (the reason is plain)
I m back in old Ireland, old Ireland again.
The Devil may shoot me, 1 have to admit

The Law could not reach him, I’d only to bleed.
“WELL, I ALMOST CAUGHT HIM, ANYHOW!”
I’d only to suffer the wrong and the loss,
To curse or forgive him like Christ cn the cross ;
I chance to be living, like many folks more,
In nineteen hundred and twenty and four.
In pumps and knee-breeches old Edgar came in ;
His wig was new powdered, he’d shaven his c-hin;
But this I remember, nor time can efface
The scorn on his bearing, the grin on his face.
A ghost on a pivot, he suddenly drew
A Icng-barrelled pistol and levelled it true
On him who had done me the dirty, mean deed—
He shot him as dead as a doormat indeed.
Last night I was dreaming like many folks more;
To-day I am living in nineteen-two-four,
Not seventeen hundred and fifty and three.
Pass me the bottle, a-hone and a-whee!
VICTOIUA.
E. J. BRADY.

“Curletv”: “Nitric” (B. 4/12/’24) un-
favorably compares Brisbane’s attempt to utilise
goldfish as destroyers of mosquito larva; with Ameri-
ca’s method of spraying swamps from aeroplanes with
solutions of Paris green. Still, there are obvious
objections to the spraying of populous towns with
arsenical mixtures. The real remedy for malaria
and mosquitoes is frogs—-hundreds, thousands, mil-
lions of frogs! In 40 years of migrations all over
Queensland I have invariably found tadpoles and
mosquito larvce incompatible in the same water.
The only reasons mosquitoes exist at all are: (a)
Many swamp districts diy up periodically, and con-
sequently the frogs become nearly exterminated ;
(6) where water is permanent, it is so infested with
fish, ducks, cranes, snakes, water-rats, etc., that the
frogs are reduced to a minimum ; (c) water is caught
in tanks or other receptacles where mosquitoes can
breed freely, without batraehian intereference.
Already our local tanks have to be made mosquito-
proof, and it is illegal to leave stagnant water about
in any open receptacle; and supplementary to these
a scheme to preserve the frogs in drought would be
better than any system devisable of raining down
poisonous solutions from the clouds.
“James B.” : Reading of a man dying from
blood-poisoning caused by having a tooth extracted
prompts me to ask whether we had greater powers
of resistance 50 years ago, or was blood-poisoning
rarer then? It is just 52 years since I had my
first experience of tooth-extraction, and the memory of
it is as vivid as ever it was. At that time I think
there was one dentist in Sydney, but that was 50
miles away. Doctors did most of the tooth-pulling
but they were far off, too, and my need was pressing.
So when a neighbor told me “Ole Bill has a
machine for dronin’ teeth,” I rode across the ten
miles to Bill’s home. I found him cleaning out the
stable, and he was as dirty as a man could be.
“Come over to the ’ut,” he said. Arrived there he
sharpened his knife on his boot and with it cut
around the tooth. “Lancin’ the gum,” he called it.
I thought agony could go no further. Then he
fastened his forest-dbvil on the tooth, and for an
eternity or two we were locked in a deadly embrace,
I filling the air with yells of anguish, he with
profanity. At length we fell apart, and I put my
hands to my head to feel if it was in its right
place, while Bill held aloft the dripping tooth and
yelled “Got ’im, be Gawd!” He was welcome to
’im—l wanted ’im not again. No attempt was made
TAKING NO RISKS.
“Now, listen to what I tell you, young fellow, and don't you carry
me past the terminus .”
to dress the gash in my jaw, and I rode home in
the teeth of a biting gale. Didn’t I catch cold or
blood poisoning? Not a bit of it! For a day or
two I lived on flour and water boiled to a mush.
Then I was able to tackle the salt horse and damper,
our staple food in those far-off days.

“Akran”: A resident of Dobie’s Bight
(N.S.W.) put a setting of eggs to hatch, and when
hatching was due noticed one egg with the shell
chipped, but too dry for the chicken to break
through. After being dipped in warm water the
shell parted, and two perfectly formed, healthy
chicks were disclosed. The “twins” were put under
the hen, and now are as strong and healthy as the
rest of the clutch. Does anyone know of a similar
instance ?
“C. Coral”: Turtles coming up to deposit
their eggs on sandbanks are frequen.ly scared away
by light: they don’t seem to mind a fire round
which the waiting natives may be sittii g, but a
lantern’s beams are too much for their modest dis-
position. Booby Island was a favorite turtle resort
at one time, but the rays from the lighthouse
thereon have caused
them to go elsewhere.
A concrete beaccn, on
which a light will later
on be placed, has just
been completed at
Bramble Cay, where the
turtles come up by the
dozen, and whither the
natives rush off m
their canoes and lug-
gers to obtain their
“fresh meat” supplies
—4O or 50 may be
turned over in me
night. Jimmie Susu is
beginning to wonder,
though, whether the
latest addition to the
Cay’s architecture is
goin; to have the effect
of scaring away the
turtle. Anyway, since
in his legends he as-
cribes the origin of
“Brammakee” to super-
natural beings who
carved a slice out of
Darnley Island and
transported it to is
present site for the ex-
press purpose of at-
tracting turtle, he con-
siders he has good
reasons for doubting
the benefit of the ne.v
structure. Also, as he
observes, “plenty ship
come fast and lose
’long Brammakee: we
find all kind good ting afterwards—bokis, plank,
copper, any kind ting.” Jimmy foresees some lean
years in the flotsam and jetsam line.
“Nitric”: “W.L.W.” inquires whether din-
goes will stalk curlews (B. 27/11/’24). I have
often seen them do it in the low ranges near Cun-
ningham’s Gap (Q.). Curlews are as curious as
hares. I have shot them after first attracting them
by lying down and waving a leg in the air.
* * * *
“Aimurta”: Touching the endurance of
tiny children lost in the bush (B. 20/Xl/’24 d-
In the early ’nineties a boy named McDermott,
aged two years and • eight months, strayed
away from Kallioota station, north of Port
Augusta (S.A.). His mother missed him at
2 p.m. on Saturday; he was not found until noon
the following Tuesday, after having been 70 hours
without food and water. He had for companion a
four-months-cld pup, who not cnly never left his
little master but evi-
dently tried to steer
him back to the sta-
tion. Twice we saw
the track of the dog
leading the boy home
—once he had brought
him within a mile of
it—but the toddler had
turned back into the
scrub. The search
party, which included
a black tracker, finally
found the youngster
asleep ; the pup barked
and woke him. The
first words he said
were “Want d’ink of
water." I gave it
him, a spoonful at a
time; when his own
thirst was appeased lie
said: “Give Clidy Boy
[the pup] a d’ink.” It
was 10 miles from the
station where we found
this hardy young Aus-
tralian, very little the
worse for wear, though
he was a bit delirious
when we got him
home. He had travel-
led fully 30 miles and
over some fair-sized
sandhills. The indi-
cations were that the
boy had walked about
until he was tired,
then dropped down and
slept; judging by his
tracks just before we found him, he was all out, as
his resting-places were very close to each other. It
was in December, but fortunately the weather was
very cool for the month, otherwise he must have
perished from thirst.
* * * *
“Duanrat”: The queerest nesting-place I
know is an old square iron tank which has harbored for
many seasons a pair of swallows, who build in
one of the top corners, and there regularly hatch a
family. In spite of the fact that the tank is
always more than half full of water, and that the
only entrance is through the opening at the top
with an iBin. diameter, I have known of only one
fatality by drowning. The victim was a young
bird which probably made a false start when essaying
his first flight.
“Parama”: A Dutchman, one Dr. Huen-
ger, has foe n 1 perfect milk-white pearls in cocoa-
nuts. He informs the world that they come from
“blind” nuts—those lacking the usual three eyes;
two dud and one soft —and, being extremely rare, are
hard to get from the natives, who consider them
“good medicine” against magic. The “blind” nut
TERRA FIRMA BRAND
“How about trying a little champagne or sherry, sir?”
“No, steward. Port is the only thing that’ll do me any good.”
is itself almost as rare as the sovereign ; I’ve only
seen cne in several years on cocoanut plantations,
where the nuts are husked and opened in tens of
thousands. It was left most carefully alone by the
“boys” engageu in the work of opening the nuts.
They informed me it was “allsame devil,” and that
it was no good for copra, being rotten and sting-
ing inside. I burst it open to see, and there was
no doubt about it being rotten. The boys got
well away from me when they saw I meant breaking
it, but whether with the idea of dodging the stinu,
or of getting as far away as possible from the
“allsame devil” they thought lived inside it, I
can’t say.
* * * *
“Phip”: In reply to “Fordson” (B.
4/12/’24), “Mr. Lyons” who knows all there is to
know about ploughs, invariably uses discs, and this
for many reasons. Should the ground be at all
dirty, with straw, melons or grass, the disc goes
right through; or if at all hard it makes no differ-
ence to the disc. Again, by using the disc there
are no ploughshares to buy and point, and in
many cases a share has to be pointed every day.
Discs also are much lighter to use than mouldboards,
since anything that revolves is easier to pull than
anything that has to be dragged. With the disc, too,
there is never any worry about sticky ground. I
used mouldboards once and didn’t see the boards all
day. A mouldboard is a good plough in liglit,
clean ground, as it certainly does better work and
turns all rubbish under.
* * * «
“R.N.W.”: Has any Bulletin writer
compared the endurance powers of different animals
when swimming? At Surprise Island, north of
New Caledonia, I had left a large porcelain dish
about 16in. in diameter, half full of water, on the
assay laboratory bench over night. At 6.30 next
morning I saw three mice in the basin swimming
vigorously, and left them to drown. At 8 o’clock
they were still swimming, but at noon one was dead.
I could stand it no longer and took them out.
After remaining still for a few minutes on the bench,
they staggered off. These two survivors had, under
my observation, kept up for five and a half hours,
and I do not know at what time of night they
had fallen into the water. «
* * * *
“T.V.T.” : A farmer in our district some
years ago owned an Ayrshire bull whose harem con-
sisted of pure-bred Ayrshire cows. He sold the
bull to a dairyman, a few miles away, who, wishing
to produce the Ayrshire- Jersey cross, ran him
with Jersey cows. His original owner bought
him back two years later, and again paddocked him
with the Ayrshire cows. His progeny now showed
marked Jersey characteristics, especially about the
head, many of them being similar in appearance
to the calves he had sired from the Jersey cows.
I have heard of the fen ,tie animal “throwing back”
to a male, but this is the only case I have found
in which the process was transferred to the male.
* * *
“Parama” : Unless “Gouger’s” , “sucking-
fish” (B. 27/11/’24) is a new line of goods, he’s got
hold of the wreng end of it. The sucker-fish
found in Australian waters measures about 3ft.
in length. It is known throughout Torres Strait
as “garpoo” by the natives, and is pretty generally
used for turtle catching. But the fish does not
try to suck with its mouth. It is supplied with a
lamellated sucking disc on the top of its head, ty
means of which it attaches itself to a turtle, cr
anything else that looks like being able to give it
a free ride. The performance “Gouger” saw was-
bungled, for the fish glides below the sleeping
turtle and attaches itself without disturbing the
sleeper. The “boy” at the end of the line attached
to the “garpoo” knows when it is fast, by the
line ceasing to run out. A g<ntle pull confirms
this; and then slowly and carefully the line is hauled
in. When the turtle is within a few fathoms of
the boat, another boy slips silently into the water,
carrying a noosed rope. This is dexterously slipped
over one of the turtle’s flippers, and the right-away
signal given. Then the fun starts. The boy in
the water hangs on to the turtle’s shell from behind;
those in the boat haul in the line till the prize : s
alongside. Then one of them slips his hand under
the turtle, presses the “garpoo” gently upwards
and forwards, thus forcing it to release its hold,
and the next moment the turtle is on its back at
the bottom of the canoe, while the sucker is allowed
to attach itself once more to the outside, where it
will remain until wanted again. These fish attach
themselves to anything that is floating or moving
through the water—shark, dugong, floating spars,
the wooden bottoms of pearling luggers and bGche-de-
mer boats, and even the steel plates of ocean
steamers; more than once they have been found c n
a ship’s plates while the vessel has been lying in
the muddy waters of the Brisbane River at one
of the city wharves.
“C.0.M.”: The splendid flowering-gum
of AVestralia is a tricky vegetable. Its blooms may
be scarlet, but it is no proof that you have reared
the wrong vegetable if they turn out crimson, pink
or even white. One N.S.W. enthusiast for native
flora has a yellowish-white specimen which has
grown into a nice little tree. It is no use pulling it
up to throw at the nurseryman who supplied the
seedling. The thing is true to form botanicallv
and only tired in the matter of color. If it had
carried the jest a little farther and come out a
vivid blue, the game might have been worth while.
“ J.G.”: A dog on my visiting list was
owned by a gardener at Epsom, near Bendigo. He
would be sent out with two or three cows in the
mornings, and his job was to watch them on the
roads until about 4 p.m. Sometimes he followed the
cows for miles along the roads, but as soon as a train
from Echuca rumbled through Epsom, at about 4
o’clock in the evening, he rounded up his charges
anu took them home. Although perhaps half a dozen
trains passed in the course of an afternoon, he knew
the right one to pick out for knock-off time.
# * * *
“Stellsby” : A small dairy cocky sends his
old dog Jess every morning to fetch the cows. The
other morning I saw her in the distance slowly bring-
ing up a straggler, and I noticed that every now
and then she pulled up and laid down for a while;
moreover, Strawberry halted too. I thought the dog
had injured her foot, and went to investigate. It
was not until I got to close quarters I saw that
Strawberry was accompanied by a few-hours-old calf,
and that the sagacious canine Sairey Gamp, with sex
sympathy, was skilfully making the passage home in
easy stages.
“Bouragi” : Next time “Parama.” finds lie
has a mob of mosquitoes on board his boat, though
two miles off shore, with no land breeze blowing
(B. 13/U/’24), let him make sure he did not shit)
DISGRACEFULLY DRUNK.
“ Shay, ol’ man, lesh walk ’omc —’s plenty

“Walk! Washemarrer? Are you too full to

the creatures at his last port of call. Mosquitoes
have an astonishing capacity for stowing away on
a craft, remaining invisible during the day and
coming out hungry at nightfall. Two miles off-
shore is far enough to spell immunity from any
winged visitor, barring angels, mollyhawks and
flying-fish.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
The opening day of the Summer meeting
was served to a singing breeze and a blue
sky on which cloud galleons floated, all sail
spread. Randwic); was crammed, in spite
of the holiday exodus from the city and the
excitement of cricket. A trickle of just-
returneds from Europe percolated through
the stands, showing the new length of leg
and the high, square-crowned hat. (But
that is on the wane, so the English fashion
books declare.) One of the smartest of the
newly-arrived frocks appeared on Bea Mc-
Donald —it was navy, narrow, and had a
dash of chilli red. On the whole, the Sydney
girl clung to the colorful frocking that has
so persistently this wet summer clung to the
pegs in her wardrobe; and if every now and
then a doubtful glance went scurrying to the
changeful sky, she kept on smiling.
Early ferries and trams and trains bring in
the real Sydney girl, sun-browned, bare-armed
and tub-frocked, and, with a callous dis-
regard of the calls of Christmas shopping,
she steps into a Cricket Ground tram, and
gives herself over to a day’s enthusiasm. She
carries a hamper, a suit-case or a basket
in which repose her lunch, her lip-stick and
her powder-puff. She wears a veil and a
sunshade, and she enjoys the game for its
own sake. Why shouldn’t she? In the pack
is the dark-haired Maoriland girl Lowry,
somewhat torn in her allegiance, having just
become engaged to A. P. F. Chapman, of the
English cricketers. Her companion is the
Falkiher girleen, whom she is visiting.
Cohorts of women cleaned up pyramids of
sandwiches and mountains of cake at the
opening of the Women’s Club last week.
In five minutes the tables were scraped to
the bone, and _an SOS went out; only an
eternal fountain of tea kept the day from
disaster. Dr. Mary Booth, who founded the
club—its first headquarters were in Rowe-
street —talked of other days, while the photos
of the first committee smiled down from the
dining-room walls. The McMillan dame, the
Club’s present president, wore a twist of
Persian blue high about her throat, and
talked of presidents that have been; and
Miss Fry had a bouquet ready to throw at
her when she sat down. The bedrooms are
delicious nests of chintzes and bedspreads
and rugs in harmonic color-schemes; there’s
a dining-room where you can take mere man,
and there’s even a comfortable smoke lounge
where gaspers can be indulged in. though
what the committee might sav if the mem-
bers took to pipes and cigars is too shudder-
some to think of. There are balconies, and
a flat roof remote from the roar of Elizabeth-
street, and looking out over the bowels of
the City Railway to the spires of St. Mary’s.
The Women’s Country party, instigated
chiefly by that alert Mrs. Butler-Gye, en-
gaged Edna Thomas to help furnish its new
club the other evening. Result: over £lOO
towards fripperies and what-nots, after the
lady’s fee of £5O was paid. Edna was filled
with temperament that night, and declared
she could only sing against a background of
blue hydrangeas; so some pinks and mauves
that had tried to get into the limelight had
to be pulled out even while the Adyar Hall
was being filled up to the brim.
At Tresco on Monday Captain Craufurd’s
lady said good-bye with one hand while
with the other she welcomed Commodore
Wardle’s daughter, Jean. Jean’s sailor-
father had already given her an introduction
to her new social duties at a dinner-party
on the Sydney on Saturday.
Most of the King’s Navee on these pleasant
waterfronts turned up at the Christmas party
at the Naval Depot the other afternoon.
Rushcutter’s Bay is a fairish step from the
tram, and the rain poured mightily; but over
200 baby Jack Tars and Miss and Mrs. Tars
took a chance of a ducking to say good-bye
to president Mrs. Craufurd and Mrs. Brand,
who sail for England early next year. The
lady of Tresco has been the jolliest president
the Union of Sailors’ Wives has known, and
Mrs. Brand has been its secretary since back
m the dark war-days. Everything behaved
beautifully except the weather; the rain
spoiled the kiddies’ sports, but it couldn’t
spoil the tea-party nor the Christmas-tree,
nor the presentation of a wristlet watch to
Mrs Craufurd and a glittering cigarette-box
to Mrs. Brand. Best of all, it couldn’t spoil
the Christmas spirit, though Santa Claus,
funnily enough, brought liis message of
goodwill riding on a gun-carriage. Mrs.
Robins, the new Naval Commanders lady,
held a kind of informal reception, looking
very rolled-up-umbrellaish except for her
eyes, which are blue as the skies and have a
twinkle to them. Commander Wardle’s
daughter Jean turned up frocked and shod
in the royal blue that is always recurring to
. popularity in Britain—for no apparent rea-
son except that ancient Britons found woad
so fashionable. Mrs. Quick, whose starry
eyes are enhanced by the blackest and thick-
est of lashes, Mrs. Nelson Clover, Miss Cor-
bett and the new Mrs. Soutter were a few
who worked hard for the success of the party.
Sparkling Dorothy Rudder might have
been illustrating the pearl of great .price
when she kept her appointment with Leonard
(“Siam”) Smith the other night in St.
James’s Church. The satin of her wedding
frock was stiff with seed-pearl embroideries,
and the pink-lined train flew true-lovers’
knots of pearly lustre. A sweep of tulle,
orange-bud accessories and an armful of pink
and white roses further cheered the bride,
while a full muster of choir boys sang the
vow-exchangers across the threshold, and
Padre Russell securely locked them in. Four
’maids and a tiny trainbearer, who looked
like a plump baby-rose, stood by the bride;
and E. Haggett and Nimrod Greenwood gave
first aid to the 'groom. The cake was cut
at the Wentworth.
A North Shore bride of the week was
Eileen Ryan. She became Mrs. W. Garnsey,
of Forbes, at St. Mary’s, Ridge-street, Father
O’Connell tying the knot. Later Mrs. ,T. J.
Dalton hostessed a reception at the Carlton.
Elizabeth Bay and Potts Point were flut-
tered by a wedding among the Chosen mid-
way through last week. The bride was a
daughter of the Richard Ashers, of Eliza-
beth Bay, and her first name (one cannot
well speak of a Jewess’s Christian
name) is Dulcie. The young man in the
case was Ernest Baruch, of Melbourne. The
good-looking young bride was sheathed in
sinuous silver lame that had the wrist-long
tight sleeve which is becoming so fashion-
able for the wedding garment. A long misty
wash of tulle and Limerick lace train w r as
followed up the Great Synagogue by four
small and extremely pictorial maids in Kate
Greenaway frocks. Rupert Michaelis best-
manned, and Rabbi Cohen presided over the
symbolic and impressive Jewish ceremony,
at which bridegroom’s brother-in-law was
chief assistant. The Wentworth was the
rallying-point afterwards.
Amongst the ladies at the recent wedding
of Quakeress Kathleen Wardell —the Manly
girl who was wed to John Powell in the
Friends’ Meeting House—was Mrs. Sefton-
Jones. Mrs. Bobbie Williams gave the tra-
veller, who hails from England, a good-bye
tea in the Women’s Club the other day. Mrs.
Jones —her husband is on a -world-wander
with her—is a writer and a student of Eng-
lish medievalism. Under Flinders Petrie
she studied the misty history of the Pharaohs,
and has taken part in the disturbing of dis-
tinguished mummies. The Sefton-Joneses
left by the Niagara to have a look at Maori-
land on their way to London. Tasmania was
so impressed with the lady who wrote
“Devonshire House” that its Women’s
National Council has asked her to speak for
Tasmanian literature at the 1925 conference
in Washington.
Nearly every boy who has a crystal-set
knows Miss Wallace, w T ho keeps the wireless
shop in the Strand. Well, that young lady
with the electrical-engineering diplomas and
the witch-like knowledge of radio is going
to be married on the last day of the year.
The man in the case is Cecil Roland McKen-
zie, of Watson’s Bay. But which is going
to be cast for the listening-in in the domestic
drama neither knows yet.
Freeman presents this lady. She is Miss
Agnes Littlejohn, author of a series of
charming fairy-story books that all young
Australians will love. These are the imagi-
native weav-
ings of a mind
that, 1i k v
Peter Pan, has
never grown
up, and the
author h a s
given them to
the world un-
der such titles
as “Star Dust
and Sea
Spray,” “Rain-
bow Dreams,”
“The Sleeping
Sea Nymph”
and “The Lost
Emerald.” The
stories have
artistic illus-
trations, and
“Rainbow
D r e a ms,”
chosen as one
of 100 repre-
sentative books for a New York library, has
some beautiful pages by Alek Sass and
Albert Collins. The writer has also several
novels and a book of poems to her credit.
Beatrice McDonald stepped off the English
boat last week brimful of the excitement of
12 months in Europe. The brilliant girl,
who has a host of literary and artistic friends
in London and Dublin, met “A.E.,” Susan
Mitchell, Lennox Robinson (of “White-
headed Boy” fame), Casey (the Dublin
bricklayer who wrote “Juno” and "The Pay-
cock” —he is still laying bricks and writing
plays), Sara Allgood and every color and
ink notable of the two cities except W. B.
Yeats, who was away lecturing. Australia’s
old acquaintance Rosita Forbes travelled as
far as Aden with the Sydney girl, and was
off to Persia to act her own adventures in
a film. She is married again ; the husband
is a nice, self-contained sort of man —Mc-
Grath, of the Foreign Office.
The Orvieto brought Mrs. Cavendish to
Australia. She is remembered here
as the beautiful Enid Lindeman who mar-
ried the wealthy Ronald Cameron. Her
second marriage has brought her a Briga-
dier-General and social “tone.” She is here
for six weeks to see her people, and returns
by the Mooltan.
Here’s the lady whose magic pen every
year builds a happy fairy-play for the young-
sters. She is Mrs. Rocke-Phillips, and for
five years she has not failed the small people
of Sydney. Her plays have been staged at
nearly every
big department
store in the
city, and this
year Farmer’s
had to put up
the “h ou s e
full” sign
twice a day on
their exhibi-
tion-hall door
because the
fantastic play-
let she pre-
sented was so
popular. Mrs.
Rocke-Phillips
is the wife of
the veteran
producer who
was for 37
years with the
J. C. William-
son firm and
is now with
Hugh J. Ward. She herself played for many
years in musical comedy as Lily Rochfort,
and was associated with many of Florrie
Young’s successes. The picture is from May
Moore’s studio.
Other popularities on the crowded boat
were the Earl and Countess of Ducie —she
made quite a good speech at the presentation
of sports prizes, at which she presided.
Another bachelor was Mr. Cross, a grand-
son of Lord Phillimore, and a relation of
Westralia’s vice-reine, Lady Campion.
The youthful Herbert Nelson couple sur-
prised everybody by issuing cards for their
silver-wedding celebrations. Mrs. Bertie,
who has a Titian shingled head and a boyish
figure that twenty-five might brag about,
dressed her part in gold, and glittered like
minted sovereigns from the slipper up—not
too high up. Bertie himself wore a conven-
tional design in dress-clothes, but the table
was a shimmer of the roseate and silver of
young Romance. There was a wedding-
cake, too. It was the centre ornament, and
from its iced minaret silver streamers flut-
tered to each guest’s place, ending in a
name card and an old-world posy. After
dinner the flat at the Astor roofed a crowded
reception.
Pretty Mary Regan, of Tamworth, is
another who’ll eat her Christmas dinner in
her native land. For three years Europe—
first the famous Sacred Heart Convent,
Roehampton. and next Paris—has lavished
its pearls of learning on her. In .Tune last
she was “presented,” then she “did” the Dub-
lin horse show, and followed it up by what
our grandmammas used to call the grand
tour —sort of getting it all over at the one
time. For the present the family, including
mother, are housed at the Pacific.
The woman who cranks her own car and
has a special winning smile for traffic
cops will disagree with some of the
remarks a writer makes about petti-
coated drivers in next Tuesday’s Mikror ;
yet she will have to admit there is a lot in
what is said. Also in the same issue there is
a striking story by Harold Mercer, a humor-
ous tale of the early days by J. H. M. Abbott,
and Ethel Turner’s serial. Thomas Hardy,
Will Ogilvie, Dorothea Mackellar and Ethel
Martyr are represented by verse that is
above the ordinary, and the rest of the 64
pages are up to the high standard of previous
numbers. The success of the paper has been
extraordinary: last week’s circulation was
more than one and a half times greater than
that of the first issue.
A note from a Port Moresby woman:—
A sad little party of Austral-Papuans gathered
about the grave of Mrs. H. W. Champion, wife of the
Government Secretary, whose recent death in Sydney
sadly reduced the small band of pioneers who liav»
done so much for this .Territory. Mrs. Champion
had borne the heat-laden and malarious burden for
more than 30 years, and, apart from the stricken
husband and three sons, she leaves a host of friends
who will miss her for her invariable cheerfulness,
kindly good humor and readiness to help all who
needed it. She was Papua’s organiser and restlessly
moving spirit in the collection of Red Cross funds
during the late war. We who had the sorrowful
privilege of watching her laid to rest did our best
to swallow the lump in the throat, and prayed the:
while that the kindly earth might rest lightly upon
her.
Seen in Sydney wearing plus-fours, a
greenstone watch-chain and an old felt hat,
Moko, chief offsider to Tan Wiremu Ratana,
the Maori faith-healer. Moko looks after
Tan's mailbag and shoos away the inquisitive
pakeha who want to have a word with the
great man. He confesses that the healer
drew a blank in London, and was Parti-
cularly disappointed at the icy hand extended
by Edward P. after the hospitality Ilori and
his people showed the young man in Maori-
land. Ratana seems to have expected the
Prince to come along to his pub and rub
noses and pass an opinion on the flavor of
dried shark. Ratana, who came back via
China and Japan, fraternised cordially with
Ah Pong and Kitsiama, mostly on the ground
that Chinese, Japs and Maoris are descended
from common forebears —doubtless the lost
tribes of Israel.
Sydneysider Miss L. E. Armstrong is back
in Sydney organising conducted tours. The
capable young woman left Australia nearly
five years ago, and, after, running with con-
siderable success her own enterprise of
adviser to travelling Australians, joined the
staff of Pickfords, the travel organisers, in
London.
One of the distinctions Professor Hunter
won was the Ethel Talbot memorial prize, and
Ethel Talbot was a brilliant student of her
day who specialised in research work —and
died in her twenties from typhoid!
Brisbane’s occasions:—
Sir Matthew handed out the Red Cross Society’s
gifts to the men at Ardoyne home and had a yarn
with the sick Diggers. Red blossomry and asparagus-
fern decorated the wards, and balloons bobbed gaily,
while roses and gladioli adorned the supper set by
the matron and sisters in their drawing-room.
Sir Matthew went to the performance of “The
Messiah” by the Musical Union, having the Ja'dine-
Grahams, Mrs. Leonard Turner and the Dea r dens
with him. Mrs. Robert Bell, Blanche Burns, W. W.
Crisp and Ted England were the soloists, and George
Sampson conducted.
Lady Mary Campbell, who is trotting the globe
with Mrs. McDonald Moore, came in by the Montoro.
She served three years as a V.A.D. in France.
The Authors and Artists’ Association put its arm
inside the Sketch Club’s and went up the river, some
50 strong, to consume tea and cake at Seventeen
Mile Rock si-
Cloudy skies frightened away some of the chiffons
at Ascot. But there were a few attractive frocks.
Mrs. Arthur Pierson wore) maize, and Irma Dearden
white and coral pink; and Mrs. Jimmy Blair
was in brown paisley, with a brown straw toque.
Bertram Merrilles, of Winothulo Park, took Perci-
val Ferrier, of Bellevue station, Roma, for bettcr-an’-
worse. Canon Eva put the leading questions, and
little Gracie Harden, in gold, held up the five-.vards-
long bridal train. The bride wore satin and Brussels
lace. Dr. Nicholl’s daughter Jocelyn was maid of
honor, in gold and blue; and petal frocks of gold
georgette sheathed the ’maids —Meg Bunting
(Samarai), Jocelyn Merrilles and Peggy Provan.
Some hundred -were breakfasted on the lawn at Wino-
thulo Park. Colombo and the Malay Straits see T.he
honeymoon.
Deputy-Mayoress Wilson was the Good Fairy for
the sick kiddies in the hospital, and 250 little patients
were cheered with sweets, comics and magazines.
Matron Sorenson teaed Mrs. Wilson and her party
after the distribution.
G. W. Whatmore’s son, George, has handed a ring
to Gloria Arndell-Price, daughter of ,Mrs. Arndell-
Price, of Sydney.
Coolangatta staged a party to welcome Archbishop
Duhig, who has been driving in the pegs of a new
parish. Some of St. Ursula’s girls from Armidale
helped with the musical programme.
Toowong Progress Association conjured up a Christ-
mas-tree for a thousand delighted youngsters in Too-
wong Park, J. F. Maxwell opening proceedings.
And Toowong Boy Scouts and Auchenflower did battle
for a silver cup.
Sir Matthew, with Jack Turner in attendance, gave
out. the prizes at the Boys’ Grammar, and there w r as
a big gathering of the clans. The day before his
Ex. opened the new Anzae Club, in Elizabeth-street,
where brass-hats mingled with plain Diggers and fair
maids.
The Knights of the Round Table handed out nuts
and sweets, toys and balloons to a number of sol-
diers’ kiddies, and gave a sumptuous afternoon-tea to
the little ones, in the Theosophical Society’s rooms,
amid a decoration of pink roses. A Christmas-tree,'
a Father Christmas, with Marcella Clarke concealed
inside, and an adequate Christmas cake were amongst
the items.
Thursday Island a few months back started a
branch of the Geographical Society. For a baby it
has done well and has already collected valuable
material bearing on the history, etc., of the Coral
Seas. Besides co-operating with the Barrier Reef
Investigation Committee in that body’s work, it is
inviting visitors to deliver lectures; those snared
so far include Captain Wilkins, Beatrice Grimshaw,
Charles Hedley (Sydney Museum) and entomologist
Lea (S.A.). Possession Island, where Cook hoisted
the flag, is within coo-ee of Thursday Island, and
the society will probably help in the search for the
explorer’s buried records.

Mrs. Pitt Rivers lias crossed back from
Sydney, convalescent after her recent illness,
but still so far from being herself that the
doctors have ordered her six months’ com-
plete rest. She has now gone down to Port-
sea with her two small sons.
The Travellers’ Aid Society will have its
funds enriched by a matinee launched by
Irene Vanbrugh. The house was pretty well
filled, but there was no overflow. The star
item on a well-compiled programme provided
the Vanbrugh with the finest opportunity
she has had since she landed here —in the
playlet “Rosalind,” specially written for her
by Barrie. The vice-regal Forsters filled a
box, with Lady .Tcllicoe and a Jellicoe daugh-
ter ; and Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who was to have
been in the show, came up from Portsea to
be present. Looking quite unfit for the
ordeal, she was half-carried in by a nurse and
an A.D.C. Lord Stradbrokc and daughter
Helena were penned on the opposite side,
and Mrs. Stanley Bruce was with a party.
Mrs. Ernest Wilshire shouldered the chief
brigand’s responsibilities for her sister, Mrs.
Fred Payne, who was too ill to look after
the sales of sweets, etc. Lady Stradbrokc,
who was to have taken an active part in the
matinee, was kept away by the serious ill-
ness of little Christopher Rous.
Lady Helena Rous entertained the Jel-
licoes’ eldest girl, Lucy, f.t a jazz party
last week. The affair was held in the dance
hall at old Admiralty House. Little Mrs.
Ron Irving chaperoned. Pink carnations
flirted with the blue cornflowers decorating
the tables set apart for the Governor’s
daughter.
A big crowd mustered in the Government
House ballroom to be initiated into the mys-
teries of the post-war revival of “Toe H.,”
by its London honorary chaplain, H. F.
Hayes. The cleric has come here as advance
guard for the founder, the Rev. P. B. Clay-
ton, who is preparing to root the movement
in Australian, soil. With the help of Lord
Forster, Rockhampton’s Bishop Crick intro-
duced the speaker and the subject. The
original “Toe H.” was Talbot House, the big
hostel right in the firing-line, where officers
and men, irrespective of rank, gathered to-
gether for a little peace and comfort before
going out to face death. Of the 20,000 who
halted there only 2000 came back. It was
the men who sacrificed themselves so will-
ingly who inspired the after-war revival of
Toe H„ and every member is pledged to
social service in order that these men,
who are known as the “Elder Brethren,” may
not have sacrificed themselves in vain.
Already thousands of young Englishmen,
headed by Edward P., have enrolled as mem-
bers, and the movement is spreading to
Canada and the TJ.S.A. Women arc admitted
under the special heading of Toe Emmas.
It is a wonderful movement, inspired by a
great ideal, but it is doubtful if Melbourne
will find much room for further social-service
activities. The G.-G. and Lord Stradbrokc
spoke feelingly, the one from the fulness of
his heart and as a father who lost both sons
in the war, the other as a soldier who fought
right through the trouble.
The Blind Asylum had its Christmas party
in the Ormond Hall. The affair had been
arranged by secretary Hedger in the belief
that what the guests could not see they would
sense. It began with a charming gymnastic
display by some of the pupils, and ended with
jazz and supper. The present-laden Christ-
mas-tree covered the entire stage, and
was flanked by lighted lanterns of all shapes
and sizes—a dazzling display. When the
lights went up, after a minute of darkness,
the air was rent with joyous shrieks. Each
year city firms stock the tree generously. The
Mayor and Mrs. Brunton were there with the
president and Mrs. Carnegie, who brought
a son and a pretty daughter; and vice-presi-
dent James Angus was with his popular wife
and an Adelaide niece, Addie Markwell.
There was a braw gathering of the clans
in the Collins-street kirk one night last week
to see Mrs. W. Hamilton’s daughter Isobel ex-
change her vows with Neil McNeil, the dis-
tinguished Rhodes scholar, who came lately
from Oxfoi'd to take command of Sydney’s
new Knox Grammar School at Wahroonga.
Bride Isobel’s tulle bridal veil misted em-
broidered cr§pe, worn with a train of old
Brussels lace, and she cuddled a sheaf
of water-lilies. A small white-suited
nephew, Jim Hamilton, looked after the
lace tail, while Cora McNeil, Alex.
Grey and Jess Blanch, in maize geor-
gette and tulle caps wreathed with flowers,
cheered her to the sacrifice. The bride’s
clerical uncle Cameron helped parson Bor-
land, and Robert Hamilton handed his sister
over to the ’groom. The latter had the sup-
port of brother Ken McNeil. Ken Bailey
and Hunter Grant. The health-drinking
was held in No. 9 Darling-street.
Madonna lilies and pink carnations fur-
nished the Melbourne Grammar Chapel for
the joining of William Fanning and Gladys
Wertheim. Wearing white satin, with a bro-
caded crepe train and Limerick lace veil
which floated from a glittering Spanish
comb, the bride faced the music on the strong
left arm of eldest brother Herbert. Super-
stition was defied with two green-frocked
’maids, Una Ryan and Claire Baillieu. Alan
Syme and Guido Wertheim combined to look
after the ’groom, and padre Arnold, of the
school, tied the knot. The bride’s widowed
mother, sheathed in black and silver, with a
lace brim to her hat. dispensed the wedding-,
cake at Menzies’, where the reception-room
was massed with pink and white blossoms.
Mrs. Fanning wore grey and silver, with a
dash of black in her toque, while her daugh-
ter, Mrs. Kingsley Newell (Sydney), topped
ivory georgette with an ebony hat. The
bride handed ill-omen a second knock by
setting out for the honeymoon in a green
frock and wrap.
Frank Talbot, wise old theatrical bird and
good fellow, dodged a difficulty by deciding
that the Athenaeum should re-open with a
“charity nigl.it.” At the inauguration of the
Capitol there was a contretemps which has
worried the management ever since. Invita-
tions to attend were sprayed around with a
good spirit, but when the socially unimpor-
tant Mrs. Brown was seen by the socially
important Mrs. Jones in a superior seat
there began an unpleasantness which, multi-
plied by hundreds, is still causing trouble.
While showing an equally generous spirit in
giving away the whole “house,” Talbot has
left it to Society to sort < itself out, so to
speak.
The Poster and Shawl Ball held at the
Town Hall a few months ago to aid the Civil
Ambulance was a trump card which won
tricks worth £1031; and Miss G. M. Rennie,
who played the hand, has been given loud
cheers over the result. The cheers were not
allowed to stand by themselves either, for
at a large gathering, invited by the council
of the St. John Ambulance Association, the
blushing lady was handed a presentation
dressing-case and an attache case. And that the
work of a helpful sister might not be over-
looked, a life membership certificate was
given to Miss 11. M. Rennie.
John Bowser, the Speaker of the State
Assembly, had to take a couple of days off:
in the busy time last week to mourn and
bury his mother, who died at seaside Sand-
ringham. She had outlived all her old
friends : born in the year of the Great Re-
form Act, she had lived her quiet life through
four reigns.
The lovely face captured by Brootliorn's
lens belongs to Merle Roberts, a youthful
Socioty girl who put a tentative foot on the
boards a year
or two ago
with the
Emelie Polini
co., and now
has both
feet firmly
planted with
the same firm
in musical
comedy as
understudy to
one of the
principals. Be-
sides a tuneful
voice, twink-
ling feet and
a sense of
dramatic ex-
pression, she
has a literary
flair which set
he r writing
stories almost
as soon as she
learnt to use a pen. Soon she is going to
take her talents across seas under the wing
of her youthful-looking widowed mother,
who contemplates a second matrimonial
plunge with Leo Cherniavsky. On the
maternal side the auburn-haired Merle is
an Australian of the fourth generation. Her
grandmother, Mrs. Daniel], is the daughter
of late Beechworth Police-magistrate Morphy,
and sister of the Countess of Darnley.
Much sympathy is felt for Mrs. J. Russell
Ross, of Kincaid, Christmas Hills, in the loss
of her daughter Isabel, who died in the Caul-
field Repatriation Hospital, after a long ill-
ness. the result of hardships endured on active
service. Both Mrs. Ross and her daughters
(one is the wfife of G. A. Maxwell, M.H.R.)
were indefatigable Rnd Cross workers through-
out the war years.
The widow of the late Queensland medico
Dr. Forrest, of Charters Towers, who has
been in indifferent health for some years
past, has bucked up wonderfully during the
past weeks. The other day she was able
to hold her third Forrest grandson in her
arms, after the infant had had the name of
l’eter sealed to him, at St. Pat’s baptismal
font. He was robed for the occasion in
lace given by the Abbotsford nuns, and Jim
Alston and Mary Mornane sponsored him.
Memories revived of a similar happening 30
years ago when the babe's grandmother, then
fresh from the Emerald Isle, held her only
son in her arms for his naming ceremony.
The lady, whose husband met deatli tragi-
cally 14 months back, was noted in Queens-
land society for her beauty and social acti-
vities.
Dr. Elma Sandford Morgan, who smiles
at you from over the dimpled cheek of her
small chick Rosemary, is a travelled Adelaide
girl who has
just nailed up
her brass plate
in II oba r t.
The lady med.
was a gradu-
ate of Sydney
U n i v e r s ity,
where she
lightened her
learning with
sport, and
won her blue
in the hockey
field. After
experience as
resident doc-
tor at the Syd-
ney Children’s
and Prince
Alfred Hospi-
tals. she
crossed to
Engl a n d to
specialise i n
eye work, later going to India and the Quetta
Mission Hospital. The Colonial Office recog-
nised lier ability and appointed her—the
first woman to hold the job—to the Civil
Hospital for Women and Children at Bag-
dad. The Aussie girl stood to her post
right through the Arab rebellion, when most
of the English women were hurried out of
the country. There she married Major
Morgan, of the “Old Contemptibles.” who
was liaison officer with the Arab army, and
when Rosemary was born the pair turned
their eyes from the faded capital of Har-
oun Alraseliid towards Australia.
The Mermaid Repertory Co. has been wel-
coming two important amateur players just
back from across-seas. One is Mrs. Frank
Apperly, who has been showing her two Aus-
tralian-born infants to admiring relatives in
the Emerald Isle. The other is Isabel Hand-
ley, who has been making a study of Reper-
tory productions. She gets back fully con-
vinced that, all things considered, the local
Rep. has plenty of cause to hold its head up.
Aroona, Mrs. Alec Landale’s big Toorak
home, has been seething for weeks with work-
ers who have been readying the place for the
widow and her youngest son, Gordon, who
stepped ashore from the Orama after three
years on the other side of the Equator. Too-
rak, which has been having a slow time, has
every reason to rejoice over the return of a
matron who never allows things to sag.
William Watt handed out the awards to
the prize-wdnners at Miss Nankivell's Too-
rak school. The event took place in St.,
John's Church Schoolroom, and the Speaker's
political opponents would hardly have recog-
nised his usually grim face. A small Watt
son, in white suitings, claimed a smile and
award from his parent; and amongst the
other youngsters was a Gaunt boy, nephew of
the Australian-born admiral and his liter-
ary sister Mary, and (on the maternal side)
of “Chinese” Morrison. It will be interest-
ing to see what heredity does for him. One
dimpled girlie, Judy Price, was a grand-
daughter of the late Colonel Tom Price,
founder of the Mounted Rifles, and another
the grand-daughter of late Akgus editor
Willoughby.
Kyneton has sent out the fiery cross to its
sons and daughters scattered throughout Aus-
tralia to return home for a week (Jan.
24—31 next), and hundreds will obey. Willie
Watt, Speaker of the Reps., and Argyle,
Chief Sec., will be in the contingent that will
swap yarns in the old town.
Mrs. David Turpie, just dead at Ballarat,
was Mayoress of that city no less than half
a century ago. She was 97 when she died.
During the war the lay community was
expected to give what it could afford, but
professional singers were asked to give their
aJI. About the same time that Queen Mary
announced she would patronise no more
charity shows unless the artists were given
their tram fares, laundry bills and a little
extra for bodily nourishment, the Vic. Vocal-
ists’ Society came into being. It was mainly
the creation of Mort Pettigrew, who after-
wards learned the military eye-test by heart
and managed to get away with the A.I.F. As
an official of the Victorian Taxpayers’ Asso-
ciation, he has again taken up the cudgels
for the musicians by laying bare the pretty
scheme by which some broadcasting concerns
planned to secure six-sevenths of the license
fees collected from listeners-in without pay-
ing the artists who provide the entertain-
ment. The result has been a falling off in
the supply of competent pros., followed by
howls from owners of receiving-sets who
tear off their headphones when the amateurs
open up their flow of band-of-hope ballads.
The P.M.G. will shortly be faced with a
deputation which threatens to sing him to
submission if he won’t capitulate.
Undiscovered Rembrandts and 1 andykes
unknown to fame are from time to time
offered to Australian art galleries. It is a ran'
tiling for their relation to the famous artist
to be established: but occasionally some heir-
loom brought here in the early days turns
up trumps. About a century ago Francis
Butler, the first of the clan to settle in Tas-
mania. brought to Ilobart a picture given
to him by a great-aunt. The good old lady
seems to have believed that it was a. por-
trait of Nelson's friend, Lady Hamilton.
Anyway, she described the original as a “very
wicked woman,” and kept the portrait with
its face turned to the wall. Wicked or not,
it proved a valuable gift. Eventually it was
sent back to London, verified at Christie s
as a Romney, and sold for 3300 guineas.
Melbourne police took a census of motor-
cars travelling across Prince’s Bridge one
day recently, in order to get exact data
bearing upon the traffic problem which in-
cludes the consideration of the proposed
Spencer-street Bridge. In the hour from
8.45 to 9.45 856 cars (not counting motor-
’buses) swam into and out of the watcher s
ken. They carried 1536 passengers, but 377
were occupied by lone drivers, and 329 others
carried only two persons. It works out at
slightly over 14 cars per minute. Appa-
rently the sexes in the driver’s seat weren’t
distinguished ; but another recent count gave
the proportion of women as one in five. That
was a suburban count, though; in the city
it would be less.
Adelaide’s footnote: —
The Red Cross Circle of the Women’s Battalions
Clubs arranged the usual treat for tubercular soldiers
at Bedford Park— £lBO worth of tea and presents, not
only for the men, but for their wives and children,
too ; witli something for the men at Myrtle Bank, and
cash to spare for special dainties for the summer.
Mrs. Harold Davies is president and Mrs. Kinnear
treasurer of this association of women who, when the
need for comforts for fighting men was passed, turned
their minds and energies to work nearer home.
The City Council has added another item to its list
of Queen Adelaide relics —a tortoiseshell thimble bear-
ing her name and dated 1832, and presented by
Queen Mary.
A sweltering night made no difference to attend-
ance or enthusiasm at the demonstration given by
Miss Heather Cell and her eurhythmical pupils at
the Prince of Wales’s Theatre. Tiny mites in green
and grown-ups in brown and mauve gestured and
moved delightfully. Proceeds were for charity.
The municipal elector is an unchivalrous creature;
as often as enterprising woman offers him her
services so often does he turn her down.
Mrs. A. K. Goode, who has already tried her luck
at Parliamentary elections, dashed into the civic field
this year, but with no better luck than her prede-
cessors.
The Bruer-Heath wedding was housed in the Kent
Town Methodist Church and at the James Gartrell
home at Burnside. The bride, in cream satin and
old lace, slung a train of white and gold crepe lame
from her shoulders, and held her veil in place with
a bandeau of orange-blossom and tiny roses of gold
tissue. Her bridesmaids, Evelyn Scarfe, Jean Taylor
and Hope Rutherford, were in embroidered jade-green
crSpe de Chine, with a softening of marabout at the
hem, and Margaret Davie and Margaret Parsons were
train-bearers in cream and gold.
Adelaide poloists have snared a new player in
Capt. Brook, not long arrived from India to take
up A.D.C.-ing at Government House, and with a lot
of experience in the game. The Birkalla tourna-
ments are fixed for mid-March and Clare is to have
its week towards the end of January.
The Hospital Day Committee has taken stock of
its cash and split it up among half a dozen or so
institutions. The Adelaide Hospital heads the list
with £B5O, and the Children’s Hospital comes next
with £5OO less. Smaller sums go Mareeba, Minda,
the Queen’s Home and the North Adelaide and
Memorial Hospitals.
A French honor—the Medaille d’Honneur des
Affaires Etrangeres—has come to Dr. and Madame
Krakowsky in recognition of the services rendered
by them to one of the French colonial regiments in
the second and third years of the war.
The will of the late Andrew Smith, father of
Ross and Keith, has been sworn at £23,000.
The most spectacular of the innumerable school
speech days was provided by Miss Nora Stewart
and her pupils at the Theatre Royal. The Governor
and Captain Hambleton came to see the parents
gloat over their juvenile prodigies as fluttering
moths and dashing hunters in the delightful ballets.
A Dvorak number gave Veronica Martin opportunity
for an “eccentric” dance that made her the star of
the evening—no small achievement in a programme
universally good.
The new Gorge-road from Adelaide along the
Torrens is proving unexpectedly dangerous. With
an easy grade and a perfect surface, it looks simple
enough; and its beautiful scenery tempts motors by
the hundred. But the curves are sharp and almost
continuous. One week-end lately two cars plunged
through the post-and-rail fence and down the 1-in-
-3 bank to the river. In each case the occupants were
luckily spilled out on the way. The 75-feet drop
did no permanent harm to four travellers in one
case; in the other the driver was stunned by a
tree, and lay unconscious while the car burned
150 feet further down.

Ninon de I’Enclos
was one of the loveliest women of her day, and one who retained her
charms to an age when most of us have settled down to a resigned
ugliness. Of the many passions she inspired, one of the most ardent was
lit in the breast of a young nobleman when Ninon was
OVER SEVENTY
Strange stories were told of the methods by which she preserved her
beauty. It was generally admitted that she had a
MAGIC POTION
with which she daily bathed her face and thus perpetually renewed the
roses and milk of her complexion. One is tempted to wonder whether
it was not a specially-prepared
WAX
such as mercolized wax of our own day which kept the glamor of youth
on Ninon’s cheek. There is for any woman who will take the trouble to
flake off the soiled outer cuticle invisibly and painlessly with mercolized
wax, the comforting prospect of
MANY MORE YEARS OF BEAUTY.
Mercolized wax dissolves away the old dry skin and leaves behind a new,
healthy complexion. Beauty is but skin deep—mercolized wax brings
it to the surface. It is emphasised that this wax is quite harmless, and
contains only the purest ingredients, being free from any poisonous
mercury salts.
As a general facial skin cleanser mercolized wax is unequalled, being in
universal every-day use by up-to-date, discriminating women—husbands
also find it very beneficial for use after shaving, especially if the skin is
chafed. It should always be used before the application of powder, as
the wax will prevent the pores of the skin from becoming clogged and
unhealthy.
All chemists and stores can supply you with pure mercolized wax, in 5/6
neat, original tins containing sufficient to last from six to eight weeks.
You will therefore realise that it is much cheaper than ordinary face
cream.

SPORTING
NEEDS
Any bettiug man would want to lay odds
on a Test team which finished the first day’s play
with 282 on the board and seven wickets in hand,
and that in an abnormal season, when the barometer
has been playing tricks. Such was the position in
which the Australians found themselves at the Sydney
Cricket Ground on Friday, and 34,000 people went
home satisfied that the game was as good as won —
whether the expected or the unexpected happened
will have to be told in next week’s Bulletin. Collins
began it by securing the right to bat first on a
perfect wicket, and continued the good work by
contributing an invaluable 114 in 235 minutes. He
had his customary life at 42, Hendren missing him
badly at mid-on off Freeman, who was played in-
stead of Tyldesley—the same fieldsman finally caught
him in the slips off Tate—and he was dreadfully
slow in the morning, but when he got his hand in
his batting was free and attractive. Bardsley, as
usual, opened with the captain, but with only 21
opposite his name he snicked one of Freeman’s slows
into Woolley’s hands at first slip ; he had previously
been missed off Tate by the unfortunate Hendren.
Patsy is a great little trier, but he has had ghastly
hick in Test matches. It was Ponsford who helped
Collins to put on 190 for the second wicket. Tate,
who bowled excellently until he tired, nearly got
the little chap in his first couple of overs, the ball
just shaving the wicket two or three times, but
after these escapes the Victorian shaped confidently,
and his exhibition delighted the crowd. He uses the
cut more than when last in Sydney, and his driving
and leg-glances and shots past cover were perfect. At
85 he gave a chance to Sutcliffe, at square-leg, off
Woolley, the Yorkshireman falling in trying to grab
the ball; and Gilligan bowled him with a beauty when,
after a stay of 228 minutes, he had reached 110—
his identical score in each of Victoria’s innings
against N. S. Wales, with a not-out the second time,
m the deciding Sheffield Shield match last January.
In five knocks on the Sydney C.G. the amazing young-
ster has averaged 109.75. The Englishmen’s ground
fielding was beautiful, Gilligan and Chapman especi-
ally distinguishing themselves, but they can’t afford
to drop chances in Test matches.
* * *
“Banana”: P. M. Hornibrook bowled pro-
misingly against the 1920-21 English team, but he has
been handled so roughly in the last year or two that
his chances of getting into a Test match this season
are small. Thus far his 1924 figures are: 5 for 210 v.
England ; 4 for 38 and 1 for 59 v. N.S.W. ; and 0 for
87 for Hendry’s XI v. England—lo for 394. Aus-
tralia’s greatest left-hand bowlers in Test cricket have
been Jack Ferris, 48 wickets at 14.25 ; Jack Saunders,
64 at 25.32 ; Charlie Macartney, 29 at 23.89; and
Bill Whitty, 15 at 33.20. But in these days of
covered wickets a lefthander is apt to be a passenger
in the team unless he is an exceptionally good bat
like Macartney. And Hornibrook is not much of a
bat.
* * * *
“Tren”: Clarrie Grirnmett’s bad luck with
the selectors sticks to him. In Melbourne he carried
off the pennant average and aggregate for years, but
was not picked in a Shield match until the last
game of last season, when he “showed them” by
despatching 9S. Ossies for 98. This so impressed
the Adelaide people that they induced him to cross
the border ; and this year he has been of great ser-
vice to them, but the Test selectors are as cold as
their State brethren used to be. In big games
this season Clarrie has taken 28 wickets averaging
just over 30 ; in fact, he has dismissed more batsmen
than any other Australian bowler. Nor is he a
“rabbit”-killer. In the two games with Victoria
he clean bowled Ponsford three times, got Mayne and
Ellis twice, and despatched Tarrant, Hendry, Park,
Woodfull, Love, Liddicut and Keating; against Eng-
land his victims were Sutcliffe and Chapman, each
twice, llearne, Douglas, Woolley, Bryan and Tyldes-
ley; against N. S. Wales, Ivippax, Nothling, Morris-
sev, Gregory and Oldfield. This bag makes the
recent efforts of A. Richardson, Hartkopf, Hendry
and others look very sick.
* * * *
“Tuart” : When E. E. Bean was appointed
one of the Australian XI selectors, Warwick Arm-
strong waddled into print with a protest, the pur-
port of which was that Bean had little knowledge
of the game and less judgment. Replying in r.is
brisk style, the V.C.A. secretary said that Warwick
himself had no more judgment than a stuffed
dinosaur, or something of the sort, as witness the
fact that the stout man had objected to McDonald’s
inclusion in the 1921 team, asserting that the
Victorian express “wasn't a bowler’s bootlace.”
Armstrong thereupon broke off the controversy with
as much dignity as he could muster. Curiously
enough, his book, “The Art of Cricket,” published
by the Methuen firm, contains lavish praise of Mc-
Donald. For example:—
“It is a great loss to the younger generation that
C. T. B. Turner and J. T. Hearne are no longer
to be seen and studied. During the past season,
however, young (English) cricketers had an oppor-
tunity to see and study E. A. McDonald. .. .As was
anticipated by the closest judges of the game, Mc-
Donald met with much more success in England than
his performances in Australia might have led some
people to expect. . . .His disguise of the .very fast
ball is very clever, and his length was always delight-
fully accurate throughout the tour. If there is the
slightest life in the wicket he can spin the ball
back and make it rise up awkwardly.. . .He was
able to adapt himself to prevailing conditions, and,
MAGNIFICENT, BUT NOT FOOTBALL.
OLD HAND: “Magnificent hit! Crean over the pavilion!”
LADY WITH THE JUMPER: “Fancy! And would that be what you
term a goal?”
. playing against Lancashire at Liverpool, he slowed
down to middle pace of perfect length, and obtained
eight wickets at a trifling cost. During the tour he
took 150 wickets at an average of 15, and un-
doubtedly he takes high rank among the greatest of
Australian bowlers.”
Copies of the publication were available in Australia
while the argument was proceeding, and it is a
mystery to me why Warwick did not quote the
foregoing extracts in reply to the “bowler’s bootlace”
charge. Perhaps it is because authors are a forgetful
race. I know what Ernie Bean would say, but I
am not going to say it.

At the moment of writing the A.J.C. Sum-
mer Cup, to be run at Randwick on Boxing Day,
looks like going to either Mirthmaker (Bst.) or
Comptroller (7st. 41b.). Mirthmaker’s finishing run
in the Warwick Handicap on December 6 was very
impressive, and if Comptroller can reproduce the
form he showed in the Sydney Handicap on the third
day of the A.J.C. Spring meeting, when he left the
field at the turn and led until the last few strides,
only to be cut down by Purser, he will be dangerous.
Purser’s subsequent Caulfield Cup victory proved that
Sydney Handicap form was good, and Comptroller had
a bit of bad luck besides—his little jockey was so
exhausted at the crisis that he could not ride a finish.
Comptroller has been shaping well on the track, and
perhaps he is slightly to be preferred to Mirthmaker.
There is a good word for Dick Wootton,
who has a nag or two in training at Randwick now
and then, in “Men and Horses I Have Known,” by
the Hon. George Lambton (Thornton Butter worth).
The Hon. George is a son of the second Earl of Dur-
ham, and trains for Lord Derby. Wootton he de-
scribes as “a wonderful tutor of jockeys: he had his
faults, but he was a warm-hearted, generous man, and
a good sportsman. He was a very fine judge of a
horse, and if I was thinking of buying a yearling I
always liked to get his opinion of it. He was a
man'who never said things to please people, but spoke
exactly as he thought, which does not tend towards
popularity.” Frank Wootton, son of Dick, did a lot
of riding for the Hon. George, who rates him “the
best lightweight I ever saw,” and “Stanley Wootton,
who had a most gallant record in the war, was also a
fine jockey—in a long race quite as good as Frank ”
Unlike his great rival, Danny Maher, Frank Wootton
never rode a Derby winner (Dannv rode three) but
if he hadn’t preferred King William to Stedfast in the
1911 race (he had his choice of mounts) he might
have done the trick. King William got off well and
ran horribly; Stedfast, left a hundred yards at the
post, was a fast-finishing second, two lengths behind
Sunstar. But Wootton was on Swvnford when that
good horse won the St. Leger for Lord Derbv. On
that occasion, the author records, “Bronzino, a horse
of Mr. Jimmy Rothschild’s, came with a tremendous
rush in the last hundred yards, nearly catching my
horse on the post.” Sam Hordern, who afterwards
went to five figures for Bronzino, must have
often wished that, instead of running second in the
St. Leger, the disappointing brute had fallen over a
cliff.
* * * *
Having been outpointed in the first round
of his legal fight with the V.R.C. over the disqualifi-
cation of 'Purser, J. R. Corteen announced last week
that he was abandoning hostilities, and intended •
leaving for Britain with his trainer, Godby, who
is also under the ban. The interesting pair have
an idea of taking Heroic with them and racing him
on English courses. But before they book the colt’s
passage they would be well advised to ascertain how
they stand with the English Jockev Club. That
venerable institution has little love for disqualified
persons who carry their dissatisfaction into the law
courts, and it is quite likely to be huffy about the
proposed invasion.
“Clef”: If the
discussion on lob-bowl-
ing hasn’t ceased, let
me in with the state-
ment that H. F. Boyle
used to vary his fine
over-arm deliveries with
under-arms. The Mel-
bourne papers of the
period gave him two
lines in the bowling
analysis: one for over-
arms, the other for
lobs. I don’t think
Harry ever got a
wicket with his lobs
in big cricket, but he
scooped a few in club
matches for East Mel-
bourne. I remember a
match in the ’eighties
when Percy McDonnell,
for Victoria, was past-
ing the best of the
N. S. Wales bowling,
being particularly
severe on Tom Garrett
and Spoffortli. Murdoch
gave the ball to
Charlie Bannerman,
and I’ll never forget
the howl of derision
that went round the
Melbourne ground at
Charlie’s “Sydney grub-
bers.” As long as the
ball was on the wicket
the batsmen treated it
with respect, but any-
thing an inch or so
off was smitten vio-
lently. I think this
was the last time grub-
bers were bowled in an
inter-State match, al-
though they lingered
till the end of the cen-
tury in Melbourne pen-
nant cricket; in fact.
North Melbourne won
the premiership on one
occasion by resorting
to grubbers (they kept
the batsmen quiet, and
got a couple of
wickets) when Mel-
bourne was fighting for
runs and time was the
essence of the con-

After the Spring meetings in Victoria,
Easing-wold was taken back to Westralia, which he
hadn't seen for a couple of years. He has been doing
famously on the beach south of Fremantle, where, on
a regimen that many Eastern trainers would laugh at
-—little fast work, lots of cantering, and a heap of
swimming—horses get wonderfully fit; and is fancied
for the W.A.T.C. Railway Stakes, in which he has
lOst. 2lb. The distance —10 furlongs—suits the son
of Eaton Lad—Bahloo, and he won with a bigger
weight at Randwiek last Easter. The W.A. Derby-
favorite is Huette, a Night hawk —Barmeny filly owned
by Dr. Officer, who was a champion full-back for
Essendon (Vie.) in the early ’nineties. Huette has
won over nine furlongs at w.f.a., and though hardly
the smashing three-year-old that Lilypond was, is
likely to do well.

“Blotto”: At Elwick (Tas.) recently a
horse belonging to one of the officials strayed on to
the racing track while three overheated steeds were
fighting out a finish. One of the trio crashed into
the stray, and both horses and the jockey came down;
Another nag jumped over the prostrate prads and
the rider, and finished second. He was just too
late to catch the winner, who avoided a collision
altogether.

Mountain Song’s recent form has been
so good that it is a pity she wasn’t nominated for
one of the Christmas handicaps in Sydney. Per-
haps her owner intends flying at higher game—the
Doncaster, for instance. In the Stanley Plate, at
the Queensland Turf Club’s December meeting, the
Quantock —Sweet Chime filly made Serelot and
Admetus look cheap at w.f.a. She was five lengths
ahead of the three-year-old and 12 lengths in front
of the other at the end of a mile run in lmin.
37}sec.—-excellent time for Ascot, or anywhere, for
that matter.

“FY7” : Ermyntrude has been making her
gentle presence felt on N.S.W. country trotting
courses for some time past, and the other day at
Menangle Park the promoters put on a race for
drivers and riders belonging to the Sex. There were
eight starters, and the winner was handled by a
niati on, after a rattling finish with a single damsel’s
mount. But the concourse was dubious as to the
merits of the new departure; and patrons of the
Bed Hots are by no means pernickety, as a rule.
Lovely woman is certainly not seen at her best with
her head well down on a horse’s shoulder, fighting
out a hard finish in the modern short-stirrup seat.

“Centurion” ; Certain misguided people are
trying to work up a boom in professional wrestling,
in Britain, when the century was young, the music-
nails and athletic clubs were over run with Terrible
Turks, Gigantic Greeks and Horrible Huns, but the
public soon tired of the big loafers and turned to
more exciting spectacles. The same thing happened
m Australia m the ’eighties, although the game
\vas pietty good for a time, and subsequent revivals
have been of brief duration. One explanation is
that it is the easiest thing in the world to fake a
wrestling match when experienced practitioners are
at work, and the public’s suspicions are soon
aroused, justly or otherwise. Again, cateh-as-catch-can
can be desperately monotonous, and the modern
professor of the “art” rarely goes in for any other
style.
“Machete”: Australia is presently to have
a visit from Charles Paddock, the amateur sprinter
who has cracked so many short-distance records.
According to accounts from the other side of die
1 acitic, 1 addock and Loren Murchison, his j'ountcer

Will leave ’Frisco in January for Mnoriland and

So far the attendances at Melbourne’s

; P. nz ® s are not extravagant considering that the
tariff is 3s. and 25., and the management shouldn't be
in too much of a hurry to get back the £35,000 which
tne outfit has cost. A lot more stands are wanted,
and there is room for other improvements. So far
Ikey Moses has kept his raucous voice out of the
proceedings ; and if he can be made to continue that
way, and the sport is kept clean, there is a pros-
perous future before the undertaking.

The All Blacks polished off Hampshire by
20 —0 last week, after having been entertained by
members of the,British Olympic Association, including
the chairman, Lord Caledon. The speechifying al
the luncheon was complimentary, and stress was
laid on the fact that there had been “overmuch
criticism and too little eulogy of a fine! side,” with
further praise for their clean tactics. The quoted
phrase is peculiarly applicable to a Sydney journal
which forecasted a disastrous tour for the Maori-
landers, whose chief offence in its eyes was that they
were a Rugby Union and not a League team.
“Kicker”: Seven points to nil was England’s score
against the M.L. Native team (B. 4/12/’24).
Madigan, the M.L. wing three-quarter, was having-
ins first game after an enforced spell, the result of
a broken leg; and most of the others were stale,
having had too much football. More than once
five matches were played in a week, owing to the
need for the root of all evil. The “gate” at the
game against England was large, but many of the
other fixtures arranged by the English Union barely
paid rail fares, and the team had to negotiate other
in lies to avoid financial disaster. There were no
millionaires among the players, and they had a
tough time getting shaving money from the manage-
ment. I have an abiding memory of one of the best
of them hurrying down the Auckland wharf to catch
the steamer. All he had in the world besides what
he wore was wrapped in a red pocket-handkerchief.
“J.H.” (London) : I saw the All Blacks beat Cam-
bridge by 5 points to nil. Porter and co. were on
top, both back and forward, throughout, but the
conditions were appalling. There had been rain for
12 hours before the match, and from start to finish
the ground was a quagmire; in short, any attempt
at handling the ball was out of tile question. Where
the All Blacks invariably shine in matches against
English sides is in quick backing up, and in smart
“passing out” by the forwards in support of the
hacks both in attack and defence. There always
seem to be three or four Maorilanders handy when
their line is threatened, and there are invariably
two or three men over at the end of a successful
attack. All the same, I haven’t changed my opinion
that England will win on January 3.
“Past Grammar”: There is no false pride
about the body that controls League Rugby in these
parts. An English team having recently visited
Australia, it was modestly suggested that an Aus-
tralian side should hp bidden to play the League
clubs of Yorkshire and Lancashire next season. The
proffered honor has been declined, the League
authorities in England having invited a Maoriland
team instead. The idea, apparently, is to make still
another effort to vitalise the professional code in the
Dominion by pointing out that free tours are not
a monopoly of the Union. But unless the M.L. League
can buy or otherwise induce a lot of the Union
cracks to join its banner, as the N.S.W. body did
years ago, a touring side of M.L. Leaguers will be
a poor draw “oop i’ t’ North.”

Oxford gets a good oarsman in Myles
Formby, the new S. Aus. Rhodes scholar. No indi-
yidual Adelaide rowing man has been much in the
limelight of late years, since Murray Bridge has
been allowed to represent the State as one crew, but
Formby is well up to inter-State form. Both at
St. Peter s and at the University he found time for
lacrosse and other games, but the river had first
claim on him. He has won a lot of scholarships, and
took a brilliant degree in medicine the day after the
Rhodes award was announced.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The Maoriland Rowing
Association has selected a crew for the eight-oared
boat which is to race in Sydney early next year.
Four of the chosen hail from Blenheim, three from
Canterbury, and one from Wellington. They are a
big lot, as might be expected, but amateur rowing
form in the Dominion is practically a sealed book as
far as this side is concerned. Maoriland is far keener
on the sport than the N.S.W. public is nowadays,
and that may count for something.
BALLAD OF THE BITING OF GILLIGAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Toowoomba (Q.) is annoyed at the reference by
Gilhgan, captain of the English Cricket XI, to che
local mosquitoes. It is claimed that the municipality
has eradicated the pest, and that whatever bit Gilli-
gan must have been brought in his baggage from
Brisbane.”
Close-shrouded from our feeble ken
Lies many a murky mystery;
Which was the first, the egg or hen ?
What leisure hath the busy bee?
Buckley's assailant —who was he?
What do the angels do for scran ?
Which of the fell lnseclidae
Bit Britain's skipper, Gilligan?
On moonlit down, in shaded glen,
Toowoomba slumbers peacefully;
For never stagnant pool or fen
Harbors iusanitarily
The culex that by night doth flee
To plague the sleeper, tossed and wan;
It surely was an importee
Bit Britain’s skipper, Gilligan.
Drive the sour scandal to its den !
The City Fathers, conscience-free,
Scoff at the sneers of baser men,
In virtuous hilarity.
From their demesne the Fly and Flea
Are exiled by the Council’s ban;
A Brisbane beastie, you’ll agree,
Bit Britain’s skipper, Gilligan.
Envoy.
Your baggage, Blokes, where’er you be,
When shifting quarters closely scan,
Or you may court calamity
And get a nip, like Gilligan.

THE INKY WAY.
“Verri”: Some recent pars, about reporters who
did their best with obscure cables recall that when
M.Tj. Premier Seddon revisited his native town of
St. Helens in 1897, he greeted the townsfolk with
the broad Lancashire “Lads, I’ve come whoam.”
This was duly cabled to M.L., causing a couple of
papers to announce that Dick’s opening remark to
the welcoming crowd had been “Lads, I’ve come.
Mho am I?’’
“Byuol”: Our librarian received two shocks the
other afternoon. He told me about it later. A Uni-
versity professor called to consult “The Economical
Effects of Child Labor,” but the book was missing
from its usual place. A good deal concerned, my
methodical friend inquired of the lady assistant
whether she had any knowledge of the volume’s
whereabouts. “Oh, Mr. Jones,” she said, demurely,
“1 put that book in the Maternity Section.”
“S.T.S.”: The little (comma) more, and how
much it is ! The little less, and what worlds away
(from the sense) ! These instances are from recent
English papers:—
(1) Rembrandt, whose picture “The Mill” was
sold for £lOO,OOO, recently died a pauper.
(2) A man charged with being £l7 in arrears was
allowed to go on promising to pay.
(3) (Of the Canada of Kipling’s imagining):
“Daughter, I am in my mother’s house.”
“C.”: IJ.S.A. literary collectors are paying bigger
prices than ever for R. L. Stevensoniana. The MS.
of the “Requiem” changed hands the other day for
1500 dollars. At the same sale, the notebooks
(only) of “Travels with a Donkey” went for 2000
dollars; while the MS. of “Kidnapped” brought
10,000 dollars. All three came from the estate
of the late W. H. Arnold, the great Stevenson collec-
tor ; the buyer was Dr. Rosenbach, the Phila-
delphia dealer.
“Tauwarra”: The way of the Australian writer is
hard. Recently, in a N.S.W. cathedral city, I
inquired at the School of Arts for “Post-mortem,”
“My Odyssey,” “Seatracks of the Speejaeks” and
“Patrolling in Papua”—all good works by good
Australians. The librarian seemed to think at
first I was pulling her leg ; finally she confessed her
ignorance of any and all of them. But I could
have had my choice of Ethel M. Dell, Berta Ruck
and the rest of the sugary (and alien) sisterhood.
“T.P.H.”; Rhodes Scholar S. C. Lazarus, rn
Oxford Doctor of Philosophy, makes more money as
reporter than as a lecturer at Melbourne ’Varsity.
One of his first jobs for the Herald was to write
up the Nieholson-street gold bubble. Ernest Scott,
now Professor of History, was a Herald reporter
from 1890 till 1897, and then he had a long spell
on the State and Federal Hansards. Lazarus may
also find the press a good jumping-off place if a
professorship is his goal.
“Coot”: A Vie. State-school boy was asked to
render into prose the lines from Tennyson’s “Brook’ •
“I murmur under moon and stars
In brambly wildernesses ;
I linger by my shingly bars,
I loiter round my cresses.”
His interpretation read; “A man came from the bush
and hung about the bar, whispering to the barmaid
with the shingled hair.” i
“Alastor”; In the Queensland ‘School Paper,”
sub-edited by Frank Brennan, Minister for Public
Instruction, the following eulogium on our craft is
supplied; “Journalists are noted for their integrity.
There *is not a reputable journalist who would betray
a trust reposed in him. Very oft i Ministers of
the Crown give information of a confidential character
to pressmen. This recognition of their fidelity is
appreciated, and such information is never disclosed.”
Doesn’t it brace you up, brother of the Inky Way?
But what was the avocation of the miscreant who
got himself jugged for offering Brennan a bribe a
couple of years ago?
“Percy Pawnticket”: A Melbourne newsagent tells
a story of a poet who recently published a collection
of verses under the title of “Bathos and Blither” or
something "to that effeqt. The young aspirant
for a jockey’s license to ride Pegasus sought to solace
himself for the absence of a public ready to buy I,is
effusions by giving them away to all’ and sundry
with the usual complimentary inscription. He must
have been in the middle of this pleasing occupation
when he spared a moment to 'write a cheque for his
newsagent. The man of papers still keeps the docu-
ment; above the signature is scrawled mechanically
“With the Author’s Compliments.”
“Azores”; Conrad never visited Hobart or he might
have gained there a hint for the sinister Frenchman
without hands who figures in “Within the Tides.” He
Says that this Frenchman kept a tobacco shop in
Lower George-street, Sydney, in the ’seventies, and had
to get someone to hold his cards for him when he
played. Back even earlier than the ’seventies, a
maimed Portuguese was a noted cardplayer in Hobart
Town. It is true that the Portuguese had one
hand left, and that he made shift to hold his cards
and to play them in some marvellous manner. Like
most of the Portuguese who came to Aus-
tralia in those days, he was from the Western
Islands (the Azores or Madeira) and had never seen
Portugal. There was quite a sprinkling of them
on the Australian whaling and sealing craft of
the early days.
“S.T.S.”: A new book of reminiscences by Lincoln
Springfield, one of Northcliffe’s editors, has a good
yarn about the Journalistic Sense, H.M.S. Albion
was launched on the Thames about 20 years ago
by the present Queen. Springfield assigned the job
to a stylist named Jewell, and he handed in “a bril-
liant description; the nearest thing to a Turner
sunset that you could get in MS.” Just as it was
going to the printer the “tape” brought the news
that a staging had collapsed at the launching, with
hundreds of spectators, and SO had been drowned.
“There had not, in Jewell’s masterpiece of scenic
effect, been a hint of any disaster, of anything at all
untoward. I demanded an explanation. Hadn’t
he seen anything of the catastrophe? ‘Well,’ replied
the languid Jewell, ‘I did see some people bobbing
about in the water as I came away.’ ”
BITTEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gordon Smith, who rescued a bov from a ten-foot
shark off the Town Pier, Port Melbourne, said ‘I
know something about sharks, and as I stabbed thi3
one in the side I didn't give him a chance to turn
over and bite.’ ”
As oft, when idly seeking news,
Our eyes the columns comb,
From out some item we peruse
A sudden shaft hits home;
Amid so much that’s merely print
Some pithy- line like steel on flint
Strikes out responsive sparks ;
So, thrilled unto our hearts were we
\\ hen, red and dripping from the sea,
The rescuer admitted lie
Knew something about sharks. <
He gave the thing no chance to bite....
Would we could say the same!
But, penned too oft in corners tight,
We’ve many a cruel maim
Scarring our poor, financial limb—
The leg we stand on ; chasms grim
To show you ; awful marks !
And still the brutes their nips renew
With compound interest. Eheu!
Yea, in our indigence, we, too,
Know something about sharks.

CJ~HE Question of Silk Economy' is
not lightly solved by making a practice of
purchasing the lowest priced stockings
offered.
Quite often, very low price is merely a spe-
cious attraction which, in actual fact , is the
enemy of economical expenditure. And this is the
reason why it is quite true that sometimes “one pair
of silk stockings is better than two. n
A
u
Now, let us take the case of the woman who huys
simply on the “lowest price” basis. Naturally, she
cannot expect to obtain anything but “cheap” c/lrti-
ficial Silk Stockings, nor can she reasonably antici-
pate that they 0 will add to her appearance or prove
really dependable in wear.
Tlie only definite advant-
age she receives is that her
immediate outlay is limit-
ed to a small amount.
c The certain aftermath is an
accumulation of stockings,
all of which are in a semi
worn-out state, while only
a small percentage can be
made presentable, even by
the use of needle and
thread. If the total expend-
iture they represent were
considered, it would be found
that the same amount would
have been much more wisely
invested in silk stockings that,
though the initial cost was
higher, would have possessed
the lasting advantage of &iv-
infc fcood service.

If Seymour Hicks ever feels in need of a
rest-cure he should borrow from Guy Bates
Post his part of the Rajah of Rukh in “The
Green Goddess,” who has just begun her
reign at Sydney Criterion. Post s presenta-
tion of the Eastern potentate who, after
acquiring an enamel of Western culture, re-
turns to rule over a semi-barbarous btate
perched in the Himalayas, was a fine piece
of composed acting, which threw an atmo-
sphere of grateful lassitude over a play whose
plot was really not a bit less agitated and
impossible than the average movie scenario.
The show opens with the forced descent on
the spiky scenery of Central Asia of an
aeroplane containing an officer, a doctor and
a lady, all English. The lady is married
to the fat officer, and in love with the thin
doctor,*and the lovers have been waiting for
some time for the husband to drink himself
to death. The fanatical subjects of Rukh
show a strong desire to tear the whole party
to bits because they have inadvertently fallen
on sacred ground, but the timely arrival of
the Rajah suspends their wrath. Secret
wireless communication with India has
apprised the potentate that the British Gov-
ernment has sentenced three of his brothers
to death for political murders, and he uses
his three accidental visitors as hostages;
their refusal to compound with him induces
him to turn his lascivious and Oriental eye
0 ". the lady, who is invited to buy her re-
prieve at the price of entering his harem.
In a sober moment the lady’s husband forces
an entry into the Rajah’s wireless cabin and
gets an SOS through to India, expiating his
sin of intemperance by a noble death. With
a contempt for diplomatic procedure and the
League of Nations which is getting alto-

gether too common nowadays, the British
Government promptly sends a bombing squad-
ron to the rescue. The lovers depart, con-
gratulating themselves that the exciting in-
cident has cleared up their matrimonial
tangle, the Rajah makes the perfectly just
comment, “Well, she’d have probably made
a damn nuisance of herself,” and the cur-
tain falls.
* * * *
The atmosphere of a savage and mysteri-
ous kingdom is well sustained by the fine
scenery of the mountains and the temple of
the hideous Kali-ma, with her frenzied
priests; and there is much Rukh talked and
some Russian, and quite a lot of Morse trans-
mitted ; but this Page can only vouch for
the Morse, which was legible but indifferent.
Nell Carter, as Mrs. Crespin, rejects the
Rajah’s advances with sincerity and not too
much passion; Wynnington Barnes, as the
bibulous husband, and J. Grant, as the tact-
ful lover, are adequate; and Ashton Jarry
makes an extremely picturesque and impres-
sive high priest. The Cockney soul of Wat-
kins, the body servant of the Rajah, is
skilfully laid bare by Leslie Victor.
A heavy slump in the tourist traffic may
be expected as soon as “The Bunyip,” now
showing at Sydney Hippodrome, gets into its
stride—or whatever it is a bunyip gets into.
This Showman, for one, does not want to
visit Kanimbla Valley any more after see-
ing its pantomime replica; and the Jenolan
Caves have also lost their lure for him after
seeing the Fuller version, with gnomes and
fairies and Stiffy and Mo (the pair better
behaved than usual) thrown in; though he
is prepared to take shares in any Wild Cat
floated for the purpose of picking up tho
nuggets that lie about in such profusion on
the floor. The Wattle Blossom ballet,
although the bloom isn’t of the variety at
present pushing out into the sun in
every gully around Sydney, also evokes
a responsive throb in a breast that gon-
dolier and toreador choruses had hardened;
and if Outback is really peopled by squatters
dressed as artistically as Mike Conners, with
daughters as dainty as Rene Barlee, and sons
as handsome as Queenie Paul, swaggies as
tuneful as Peter Brooks, and fruit-pickers,
miners and sundowners as plentiful and will-
ing to work as the vivacious chorus, the
London immigration agents ought to be told
about it. Ivy To we, a real little Australian-
born Chinese, is a graceful anachronism as
a dancing sprite; and Pave Lohfmaun pro-
vides the necessary ingredient of horror as
the chief gnome.
* * * *
Whatever this bald-headed critic has to
say of the thing, however, it can saf»ly be
prognosticated that the juvenile cohorts of
the State will satisfactorily endorse the en-
terprise of an Australian firm in putting on
this all-Australian pantomime.
V
An assortment of vaudeville turns loosely
connected by a thin thread of plot that
occasionally trips up the feet of the per-
formers is “The Rise of Rosie O’Reilly,”
which took off cheerfully at Sydney Grand
Opera House on Saturday night. The vau-
deville turns are good, and the plot isn’t
likely to interfere with the digestion of any-
body’s Christmas turkey. Amongst the
features were whirlwind dances by Decima
and Eddie McLean, which were so
excessively whirling that, as Shelley or some-
body said about something else, “the sense
faints picturing them”: the next stage in
this rotating business is complete invisibility
and a placard saying that the turn is on."
* * . * •
Dorothy Brunton, as the ragged Rosie
who sells newspapers, begins her career under
the murky arches of Brooklyn Bridge
(N.Y. ), among crooks and hicks (what is a
hick?), and ends it outside the ornate man-
sion of Roscoe Morgan, millionaire; and
there is much song and dance in between ;
and patter by Charles Heslop as Jimmie
Whitney, who is Bob's pal from London ;
and musical exposition by Leslie Pearce,
who is Bob and in love with Rosie; and
criminal proceedings amongst the bootleggers
and corruption amongst the police; and
some strong chest notes from John Kirby as
“Bull” Johnston, a plain-clothes detective;
and some genuine acting by Sadie Gale, who
is Cutie Magee; and the chorus works hard
and the scenery works harder —but what it
is all about doesn’t really matter. And if
there are any complaints about the composi-
tion of the above paragraph, this critic’s only
defence is that it is like the play.
** * *
Say, would you wander ’neath Italian
skies, see dances quaint, hear jocund melo-
dies, watch laughing lips and animated eyes
at winning work? For “Wildflower,” at the
Royal, book a seat: these are the goods
with which it is replete, and at her merriest
and brightest meet Miss Marie Burke.
** * *
. At Sydney Majesty’s are still on view the
giddy peers and gladsome peris, too, heading
for that objective where they strew the glad
confetti. There’s gaiety galore and quirk
and quip, and those in matrimonial partner-
ship (as well as those who aren’t) may get
a tip or two from “Betty.”
Despite the entry of several newcomers at
Sydney Tivoli, Maidie Scott hasn’t to yield
up her previous position as tup hit of the
show. The sayings of the little bird that
makes its nest on Nellie’s headgear con-
tinues to bring the house down, and her im-
personations of fashionable deadheads who
make themselves nuisances to the rest of the
audience are a scream. Gene Morgan gives
an uncanny exhibition of negro shuffling;
the Four Ortons introduce some clever fool-
ing to a wire-walking turn; and Australia
is represented by Ross, Barker and McLen-
nan, who play the latest jazz songs with vari-
ations of their own. The Hadji Kader Arabs
will rebound on the stage next Saturday.
Comedian Phil Smith, who came to Sydney
Fullers last Saturday with his musical-
comedy co., is a dapper little agriculturist
whose crop consists of laughs. In “Mamma’s
Boy” he is helped in his harvesting by Will
Greene—a capable juvenile lead —Phyllis
Nicholson, a bunch of beauties called the
Sunny _ Smiling Six. and others. On the
vaudeville side Amy Rochelle, Mayne Lyn-
ton and Nancye Stewart are the pick, and
the man who sawed the woman in halves last
week is telling how the gory deed is done.

Isabel. The rest of
the play deals with
the reaction of the
revelation upon members of the family,
th» interest depending upon the develop-
ment of various characters in their
dilemma, helped by lively dialogue. But for
the initial impossibility of a man so young
as the real poet, having left enough first-grade
verse to fatten the reputation of' the im-
postor through his long life, the play is well
constructed, and the dialogue is clever. A
small cast rendered it well. C. M. Allard
offered a striking characterisation of the
ancient Oliver Blayds, still vain in his re-
morse.. The old man's son-in-law and private
secretary, Conway, stands amongst Dion Bou-
cicault’s keenest impersonations. Mrs. Brough
was a sufficiently disturbed lady as Conway’s
wife; Irene Vanbrugh was an entirely
credible Isabel, and Janet Eccles a daughter
of the oddly-assorted Conways. The cast, in
which everyone matters, was well rounded off
by Roland Ward as Blayds’s son, Douglas
Calderwood as Royce, a literary critic, and
Ethel Wellesley as a maid.
* * * *
“Cinderella” burst last Saturday night at
Melbourne New Princess’s upon a pleased
audience in which one could even find a
child here and there. But, generally speak-
ing, it is only the middle-aged and old who
are nowadays young enough to whole-
heartedly enjoy a pantomime, which is prob-
ably why this year the Hugh Ward produc-
tion has the stage all to itself so far as Mel-
bourne is concerned. The show is the usual
compote of nonsense, dancing (plenty of it),
bright music and changing scenes; and in
midst of it all Australia’s Kitty Reidy makes
as attractive a principal boy as most that
have been seen. The worst to be said of her
is that she has developed some of that tinni-
ness of tone which is associated with many
importations; but the ill habit hasn’t gone
too far to be checked. The lady has two
songs likely to be whistled on every early
milk-cart within a hundred mile*; inside a
month, “Your Lips Tell Me No, but There’s
Yes in Your Eyes” and “Girl of My
Dreams.” Cinderella (Roma Phillips) is
distinguished mainly by good looks. Her
acting is amateurish ; but in a part in which
looks matter most she is satisfying enough.
The conventional Dame has been dispensed
with, but as Baron Munim and his charm-
ing daughters, Bert Eastcott, June Mills and
Dinks Paterson provide plentiful comedy.
Moon and Morris help in that too, and give
some good dancing. So does Fred Carpenter,
who, as his partner, introduces a spectacular
new girl, Nola Reid, whose face and figure
are a pleasure to the eyes. William Hassan
is the usual amazing feline, Cutie the Cat;
William Innes is a demon concerned about
the bassness of his voice; and amongst the
many incidentals is a dog and monkey circus.
$
The ancient story of Shylock, the usurer,
and sundry Venetian larrikins continues to
wear its new face at Melbourne Royal. The
Moscovitsch interpretation is that of a man
in the prime of life showing a fierce resent-
ment of the wrongs heaped upon himself and
his race, with Antonio always the chief
scoffer. It is a robust interpretation, in
which some of the sympathy that has occa-
sionally come to the old man for his doting
fondness of the renegade daughter is lost;
blit there is a power in it which grips the
audience. Arthur Greenaway is good as the
man wdio ran the risk of losing a pound of
good meat for his friend’s sake; and Jean
Robertson is a charming Portia. Bassanio
(William Stack) has a lisp which gives an
impression of affectation, but he is sincere and
forceful in the passages following his realisa-
tion of the danger to which he has exposed
his friend and benefactor; Basil Bowen is
a vivacious Gratiano, and Leslie Manners
(recently a member of the Allan Wilkie co.)
works well with Gertrude Cremer (as Jes-
sica) to make the pair of lovers well liked.
The lady, by the way, exhibits an extreme
callousness regarding the father she robs and
deserts, rather than the conflict of emotion
sometimes shown. A distinguished bit of
work is the Prince of Morocco of G. Kay
Souper, who clothes the character in dignity:
it makes a contrast to the over-accentu-
ated affectations of the Prince of Arragon
by H. Mackenzie-Rogan. The Nerissa of
Eileen Sparkes is lively; and Wynne Bronte,
Phyllis Best. Eardley Turner and Harold
Moran take the eye in other parts.
* & ❖ :J:
A hotch-potch of hilarity over which the
management had exhausted all the phrases in
stock, from “aggregation of artists” to “zip
and verve of life,” with such adjectives as
“sissling” thrown in, arrived on Saturday
to disturb the gloom which has rested upon
the New Palace (Melb.) for some weeks.
“The Midnight Frolics,” so named, appa-
rently, because you can enjoy them and still
catch the 11 train home, is a cascade of
vaudeville; and although some of the turns
are mediocre, the weaknesses are soon for-
gotten in the whirl. Nell Fleming, Alec
Ivellaway, Edgeley and Dawe, and Gregory
Ivanhoff provide the brightest sparkles.
* * *
Amy Castles gave the last of her four Mel-
bourne concerts to a packed Town Hall which
accepted the offering with all those noises
that delight the artist. Her “houses” have
been good and appreciative—a rather remark-
able contrast to her poor season in October
of last year. The stout songstress's best
effort at the concluding concert was “One
Fine Day” (“Butterfly”), very wistfully
rendered. A. C. Bnrtleman did some fine,
strong work; Cappelli was evenly good ; and,
in a final quartette Vera Bedford effectively
sang a “Rigoletto” excerpt with the two
male singers and Amy Castles. Amy’s
appearance in “The Messiah” will be the last
opportunity Melbourne will have of hearing
her for a long time; she subsequently goes to
Westralia, then to Adelaide, and afterwards
to Sydney. Following that she will go to
England again.

How not to do it was illustrated by the
mismanagement of the matinee given at Mel-
bourne King’s in aid of the Travellers’ Aid
Society: there was not nearly the audience

widely known that new material would be
provided by players from all the theatres.

Moncrieff and Walter Kirby were amongst
others who contributed. Apparently the
arrangements had been taken out of the hands
of the experienced theatrical people who were
ready to handle them ; even the newspaper
critics had been overlooked and were con-
spicuous by their absence. Pros, who gener-
ously give their time and work to charitable
causes deserve at least a notice of their
efforts: they are likely to make sure that

Melbourne Tivoli’s vaudeville pudding for
this week is rich, the mucli-recommended
“Six Brown Brothers” having been included at
the last moment. Harry Weldon’s lazy humor
fails to tire, although he is doing acts pre-
viously seen at the Royal. Hilda Glyder
improves on acquaintance, and the droll
Beryl Beresford is back again. The Novelli
Brothers do some slick violin-playing while
tumbling over each other, but their best turn
is the “Two Lonely Birds”—a twittering
love episode. The rest of the programme is
well up to standard.

A two-women show in Melbourne:—
Miss Janet Cumbrae Stewart, now two and a half
years in Europe, has sent back a batch of pastels
which, with some etchings by Miss Hylda Atkins,
with whom she shares a studio, are on view at
Miss Jessie Traill’s little gallery in Collins-street.
The etchings show sound composition and good
draughtsmanship—“Fishing Boats, Venice,” and
“Pont Neuf, Paris,” are particularly striking—and
the pastels exhibit a fine sense of color. “Snow,
Westminster,” is specially attractive ; and in “Stormy
Day, Richmond Castle,” the frown of an angry sky
upon the landscape is well expressed. The lady has
scored well abroad ; she has had portraits “lined” in
both the Paris Salon and the Royal Academy, and at
a lone-handed exhibition at the Dorg Galleries, Lon-
don, her little lot was sold out.
“Flaming Youth” : My most embarrassing
stage experience occurred during a perform-
ance of “Sappho” at the gold-mining town of
Ivarangahake (M.L.). The rather weighty
Sappho of our co. had to be carried upstairs
by the passionate young artist, who, for the
purpose of the play, returns a few minutes
later to see his doting relatives assembled on
the stage. I had succeeded in the weight-
lifting act, and was confronting my unsus-

kindly advice in a rough, hearty voice from
the back of the house. It is not advisable to
repeat exactly what Bill said; but the pur-
port of it was that if Bill were in my place
he would hurry back to the fat French tart,
even if he had to chuck the family out. For-
tunately the orchestra (a piano and violin)
came to light with a burst of music, which
drowned the violent blushes of the audience
and company.

“Caesar’s Ghost”: The stage career of
Jean Robertson, the clever Australian who
has returned as Portia to put the kibosh
nightly on Moscovitch’s Shylock, nearly suf-
fered an eclipse in her early days with
Julius Knight. She was then merely an
extra lady, but her style soon recommended
her for a small part. One night Julius said
to her disapprovingly: “Miss Robertson, you
are not made up ; go and make up properly
at once!” To those who thought they knew
Julius, that condemnation spelt her doom.
But a couple of months later she became his
leading lady, and subsequently George
Arliss’s.
“Machete”: Hollywood got another fine
advertisement from the death of Thomas
Ince, who gave Enid Bennett her start on
the fillums. Thomas, it seems, died of
alcoholic poisoning after a yachting cruise
with “a wild party” which included William
Randolph Hearst, proprietor of yellow jour-
nals, several leading film “actresses” lately
from the pickle-factories, and Elinor Glyii.
It is painful to think of the gifted authoress
of “Three Weeks,” who rarely writes of
anyone lower in the social scale than a James
I. baronet, thus associating with the canaille.
“Tuart”: When last heard of the New-
castle Steelworks Band was touring Boer-
land under engagement to African Theatres,
Ltd. If permitted to land in Australia by
the great Walsh (imp.), it will give a few
performances in Victoria and go on to Maori-
land ; and Queensland will be visited before
its travels end. Report is silent as to
whether the baubles won at Halifax and
Manchester are being brought to Australia
for exhibition or left in their native haunts
for next year’s competitions, but the band
is still 28 strong, having manfully with-
stood the allurements of British beauty and
beer, nor has George Portus’s silver thatch
been shingled. After the massed band con-
cert at the Crystal Palace, London Daily
Telegraph wrote of Arthur Stender, the
steelworkers’ star cornetist, that he was “the
greatest executant heard in this country since
the famous Levy.” Have any of , our Great
Dailies ever mentioned Stender’s name?
“Amity”: Tell “Charlik” (B. 11/12/’24)
that the theatregoer who does not get the
cast or the piece he has paid to see
can recover his money here as well as in Lon-
don. One night when the late H. B. Irving
was playing, the management roped off most
of the stalls in an attempt to make the public
pay 10s. instead of ss. as advertised. I
demanded my five bob back, there being no
ss. seats available, and got it without argu-
ment ; but when 20 more five-bobbers came
along with the same ultimatum the theatre
officials offered us the 10s. seats for 7s. Gd.
Several people objected, and we finally com-
promised on 6s. all round. When Mus-
grove’s German Opera co. was in M.L. it
was a common thing to receive one’s money
back. Truculent Deutschers would frequently
refuse to appear, and on the announcement
that “Faust” or some other stand-by would
take the place of “Tannliauser” > or “The
Flying Dutchman,” a large proportion of the
audience would arise and file round to receive
either its currency or free passes for another
night. The theatre, like any other business
concern, can be compelled to perform its
contracts.
GETTING EVEN WITH THE BRUTE.
“Mr. Gamboge sent me one of his cubist landscapes the
other day, so I am sending him one of mine.”
“I see—a reprisal.”
“Flaming Youth” : Toti dal Monte’s suc-
cess in the U.S.A. (B. 11/12/’24) is wel-
come for substantial reasons to J. C. Wil-
liamson, Ltd. Three years ago the lady sang
for £2 per night, and was glad to get it;
nowadays her fee is more like £2 a minute,
and it will be more when her present con-
tract expires. Still, the chances are that
Toti will have only a few years in which to
reap her harvest. Her voice does not seem
to be of the durable sort, and avoirdupois
will always be a wmrry. The little woman
put on weight during her short stay in Aus-
tralia ; but, then, nearly all professionals do,
particularly pugs.
“Lond” : A fine new film has been made in
England showing the naval attack on Zee-
brugge during the war. Faked, of course,
but with the co-operation of the Admiralty
and the Belgian Government, and with many
men in it who took part in the actual raid.
A curious feature is the inclusion of a series
of painfully realistic sinkings of merchant
ships by German submarines. It is posi-
tively stated that these were real events,
filmed by the Germans in mid-ocean ; and
that the films were captured by British war-
ships while they were being taken to America
about 1916. They were to have been used
as propaganda to help in keeping Sam out
of the "war.
“Nelbur”: In present-day theatrical pro-
ductions the demand is for types. Once a
player has established a certain line of char-
acter, producers see to it that there is no
deviation ; consider John D. O’Hara and Sey-
mour Hicks and Mamie O’Brien Watson.
Field Fisher has also dropped into the cate-
gory of “character” actors, and Frith’s lugu-
brious studies have earned him a reputation
as a “specialist.” Long ago Jimmy Athol-
wood gave up the hope of getting any “fat”
in a piece on account of his careful playing
of “special” parts. As for some of our old
stage villains, nothing would convince the
public that Jeff Tait or Austin Milroy could
fit into the hero’s habiliments.
“Billy See”: Jonathan Morris, a pub-
lican, ran the first Sunday-night picture-
show in Ivalgoorlie; “admittance by silver
coin.” The harvest might have seemed ad-
equate to most showmen, but Jonathan
reckoned his entertainment was worth at
least sixpence, and the volume of tlirummers
annoyed him. He tried putting a few half-
crowns alid shillings on tile plate as decoys,
but the ruse had no effect whatever, f inally
he made a bold attempt to corner all the
threepennv-bits in the town, lie succeeded
fairly well, hanging on determinedly to the
accumulated collections of a dozen Sunday
nights while the local shopkeepers grew half-
distracted over the shortage of tlireepennies.
At last came a night when Jonathan seemed
to have all the “trays” in the town, and the
collection-plate was piled high with six-
pences. But it was a short-lived triumph:
during the following week half a dozen local
banks brought up £lOO in small coin from
Perth and effectually busted the corner. For
months afterwards there was such a deluge
of tlirummers that the sight of sixpence in
the plate would almost move Jonathan to tears.
“T. 0.1.” : Another out-of-tlle-ordinary pub.
sign was once to be found at Milson’s Point,
Sydney—“ The Lilv of St. Leonards,” said
“iily” being a full-blooded aboriginal girl.
The sign was painted by Sam
Stead, a Mount-street artist,
when that part of the North
Shore was known as St. Leon-
ards. An early licensee of the
pub was William Dind, who
also combined financial in-
terests in theatres with the
sale of liquors. He had pre-
viously kept the Clown Tavern,
in Pitt-street, opposite the
Victoria Theatre, which In;
sold to George Coppin in
1844; then he opened a new
house, the Star and Garter,
on tlie opposite side of Pitt-
street and near the theatre,
which spoiled Coppin’s pros-
pects. After his occupancy of
the “Lily” William built
Hind’s Hotel higher up the
street, whither the “profes-
sion” flocked. The walls of
the parlors were adorned with
photos., prints and lithographs
of the most famous singers,
actors and actresses who
visited Sydney. “Old Bill”
Dind was co-lessee with James
Bartlett, of the Prince of
Wales Opera House in Castle-
reagh-street, when it was de-
stroyed by fire, uninsured, in
January, 1872. A public
benefit was organised to help
the sufferers, who included
almost everyone connected
with the theatre; Dind and
Bartlett themselves refused to
accept any share of the pro-
ceeds. Garnet Walsh’s bur-
lesque, “Trukulantos,” was
the staple piece; a pantomime
followed in which, I remem-
ber, I was the pantaloon—
alas, 52 years ago!
“Ilamfat”: The patron of the Castles
family in its early clays in Melbourne was
Father Robinson, who has a more enduring
monument than the voices of his protegees.
The energetic pusher of many movements
decided to build a church; and Our Lady
of Victories stands in its magnificence, with
a gilded effigy above its dome, in Camber-
well. The padre broadcasted invitations,
worded almost like commands, to R.C.’s the
world over to contribute “bricks” to his edi-
fice, and his daily mail brought him “bricks”
in cartloads. Subsequently, when the build-
ing was completed and contributors called
upon the priest, he had a habit of taking
them to see the church. “That’s your brick.”
he would say gravely, pointing to one as if
he had a plan of them in his mind.
“E.T.”: Bernard Shaw must have enjoyed
a critique of his “St. Joan,” penned by a
Dresden professor after witnessing a produc-
tion of the play in liis city, and forwarded
to a London theatrical organ. The learned
German announces that the performance was
“the first great event on the new season,”
and goes on to remark that “it w r as even
the event from the last year’s,” and that
“owing to this was a large assembly of the
most prominents and eminents persons.”
Finally, “the success was worthy of the
genious poet and his work, builded with
gifted inconsiderateness.” A shrewd hit, that
“gifted incohsiderateness.”
“D. Street”: Can any old-timer remember
Millie Herberte, the “sweet sentimental bal-
ladist” of the ’eighties? Millie was very
massive, like her voice, and I have an undying
recollection of her dressed in yellow satin
with a two-yards’ train, and beefing out a
ballad with the following refrain: —
My mother was a lady,
And yours, you will allow,
And you may have a sister
Who needs protection now.
I’ve come to this great city
To find a brothah dear,
And you would not dare insult me, sir,
If Jack were only here.
It had a great vogue among the stable-boys
of the period.
THE VILLAIN DIES!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We mark his entrance in the garden “set,”
Arrayed in flannels beautifully pressed,
Ai.d when he sneers and taps his cigarette
His wicked glances thrill each flapper’s breast.
But as they gaze upon him from the stalls
Their hearts grow heavy as the moments fly—
Alas! they know that ere the curtain falls
He’s doomed to die.
They see him peering through a pane of glass
To watch his uncle Roger hide the will
That leaves his riches to that < silly ass
\v hom he has tried so oft in vain to kill.
The limelight streams upon the haunted tower,
And, as the muted fiddles sob and sigh,
They fear that, though this is the villain’s hour,
’Tis he who’ll die.
He looks so debonair; and see 1 the moon
Shines on liis diamond studs and satin cloak ;
The temperamental flappers almost swoon,
They cease to chew their chocs for fear they’ll
choke.
Ilis movements now they watch with eyes all wet,
Ag at the window-catch they see him pry
And glide into the room they fear is set
For him to die.
The fiddles twiddle with a mournful moan,
As old Squire Roger steps into the room—-
Only to fall, and with his dying groan,
Map for the villain an unpleasant doom.
And then they mark with dread a secret slide
That opens slowly, till the butler’s eye
Surveys the corpse the villain cannot hide—
So he must die.
The hour is late, the gods have had *their fill
Of beer and peanuts and the maiden’s grief.
The butler has retrieved the stolen will,
And named the villain as the gory thief.
The villain sneers, and swears he’ll live to see
The ill-used maiden wed the comic spy ;
But ere our last boat leaves the shadowed Quay
We hope he’ll die.
The time draws nigh, and men who’ve brought
their wives
Begin to worry (Hah! the lights grow dim!).
The villain’s doom, so long delayed, arrives.
We see the shadows creeping over him.
The wicked Countess draws her gun, and then
A dear old spinster at my elbow sighs ;
Maybe she thinks a man is wasted when
The villain dies !

f Focus the Light Where Needed
TWTANY manufacturers in the past have felt that the industrial
lighting question has been solely a matter of good lamps.
But the fact is, that in addition to good lamps, there must also be
the use of scientific lighting devices. These will actually make
better lighting pay for itself.
Poor lighting is much more expensive than good lighting. Good
lighting means not only savings, but also increased earnings, be-
cause it produces definite and measurable increases in production.
To obtain the proper efficiency for the current consumed, it is
necessary to install the correct fixtures for reflecting and focusing
the light.
Westinghouse industrial lighting equipment is designed to pro-
vide the greatest amount of illumination over a given area for the
power consumed.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia,
Westinghouse will be pleased to hear from firms interested in
acting as distributors.

EVERY Stevens is made
to last a lifetime. Take
a Stevens double or single
barrel shotgun —each bar-
rel and its lug are of one
piece—solid sk 1.
Examine their construc-
tion —-the fore end snaps on
the barrel with a strong
spring which prevents loss
of fore end and always
exerts a pressure which pre-
vents the barrel from loos-
ening on the hinge pin.
Stevens guns will never
shoot loose.

Canada —that wonderland teeming with romance and adventure —
opens unknown beauties to those who would escape from the hustle
and bustle of life in a crowded city.
The glories and the deep splendour and majesty of the Canadian
Rockies form an effective background for the shining lakes and
other beauty spots that lie at their feet—and far away from all
the worries and cares you can rest for awhile in a cosy, jolly
bungalow camp—or in a luxurious hotel.
The Canadian Pacific Railway
system of transportation is one of the most up-to-date and modern
railway systems in the world. The equipment is designed for the
greatest comfort, while the service of all employees is unequalled.
Plan ahead —book your accommodation for trains, hotels and
steamships prior to your departure. Through tickets to England
and the Continent of Europe are obtainable in connection with the
Canadian-Australasian Royal Mail Line to Vancouver, and the
Canadian Pacific Steamship services across the Atlantic. The
New Quadruple-Screw Motor Ship “Aorangi” (22,000 tons dis-
placement) in connection with the favorite s.s. “Niagara” will
afford an unrivalled service to and from Vancouver, B.C.

Same and address must appear on the MSS. A'o
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
. tartly submitted; and no MS. will be returned

J. 8.: Afraid you don't understand very
much about that. Why not write of the little things
you know ? Don’t you chaps realise that every one
of you is an expert on something?... .Hung Ferdy:
In a manner of speaking, you call in at too many
pubs on your way... .Buttenderry: Within an ace
of it... .E.H.M.: Off our beat; and it’s prettr thin
t 00.... Envy Kay: Too old a sinner. .. .G.M.: “'The
Goddess” has been wooed too often. ...E.M.E.: Con-
vention il; and your slum waif talks like a professor.
....Point Blank: There’s an idea in it; but vou
have buried it under 2cwt. of wearisome moralisings.
....Spearmint: Get off those stilts. No two Aus-
tralian bush mates ever talked like that E.M.L.:
Sorry, but it has had a lot of attention already....
Folly Point. Of course you as a grower don’t get
a quarter of what the consumer has to pay. How
can you expect to when your only market is one
congested city ? The cost of maintaining this vast
wen is so great that the Council charges even a
fruit-barrow in the street a rent of as much as
£lOOO a year... .1.5.: The verses scribbled in pencil
were not worth the punctuation you didn't give
them.... Pioneer; It has feeling, but is not well
enough done.... Dying Chief: The abo. who died to
the strains of “The Minstrel Boy” falls far short.
Me Again: You mustn’t let lines run to any
length they please just for the sake of chasing a
rhyme down... .R.D.M.; Not much g00d... .Muriel
W.: Weak little hammering out of the old things
about the old sunset Ethel D.: A sonnet of that
sort is too easy and too thin... .F.F.A.: Too weak
and crude F. J.H.: You ask if this is Love.
Can’t say, but it’s middling verse Galen: It
treads old ground in heavy boots that make the
lines lurch and stagger... .P.R.S,: Both miss bv
a lot H.G.8.: “Dreaming” wakes up too often,
with the jolt of its own metrical bumps.... Emgee:
Well, you should thank Heaven that he didn’t make
the mistake of supposing that Captain Cook discovered
Australia Pompom: Tell your own tale. Why
put it into the mouth of a third party? Something
is bound to be lost in transmission.... Bimm: Not
a streak of hope... .Ripponlea: Welcome, gay lilt
and happy melody:—
Gone is the Eld Year. Gone!
Time a new gown has put on.
Don’t of regret prate.
Tolls the Bell. Gone the year. Shut the gate.
Further away from Birth,
To the Grave more near,
Scampering like rats o’er the Earth
Each Year!
Hollow vanities in yesteryear's wake.
Born in bliss; dies in ache.
Oft I’d forfeit Culture’s gains
And seek Dryads on saltbush plains.
For some day we’ll be box-sides betwixt,
And our screaking souls ’ll infest the Styx.
And -we’ll discard Life’s clumsy cloak,
And with gruesome grimaces croak.
. ...M.W. (Esmond); As an exercise in short-line
metre it is not at all bad, but it doesn’t get to
anything worth while M.R.C.H.: Doesn’t strike
us 8.D.A.: The method is bad and the lines are
pretty lame. Read good verse and get its meaning.
....Leamington; Not quite well enough done....
J.J.8.: The work looks very young. It is full of
metrical faults and extravagant setting of the com-
monplace, but there is a hint of good phrasing....
J.B. (Mount Lofty): Well, the flowers are remark-
able all the same; but Spring at Mount Lofty
should be worth a song. ... A.H.M.: The verse isn't
strong enough to carry it... . A.L.G.: The “thee”
and “thou” mix badly with the other phrasing.
And the idea is old and weary.... Roy L.: Very
crude... .G.E.H.: It’s hard to see why verse should
be called “thoughtful” because it asks some of the
questions that the most primitive mind asks....
J.G.8.: “Triumph” is on the road; the others are
very poor T.J.C.: The lines are ragged and
some of them carry no meaning. .. .G.S.A.: Not
much improvement. Try to say something new
without using any phrase you have read.... Vera
II.: Held for inquest.... J.H. (North Sydney): We
are quite unmoved by niggers driving mules....
J.R.C.; We have seen better verse than that cut
out by a circular saw.... Desmond M.: Small ideas
in flimsy verse. .. .W.F.8.: “The Dream” sets out
the old commonplaces in lines that flutter weakly.
....Alice R.: Gentle little thing that says nothing.
. ...L.R.M.: The mirth is of the heavy or hippo-
potamus 5ch001.... Bellerive: Its mournful cadences
awake old and cherished echoes:—
I draw the old-age pension, Lad,
My active days are o’er.
I was one of the first to drive a ’bus
In the good old days of yore.
Time brought forth the motor boom,
The electric tram and train;
Horse ’buses through the city, Lad,
Will never run again.
Speed and science is the craze,
No chance have old ideas ;
But life was safer in the streets
In the good old bygone years.
I’m in my sere and yellow leaf,
My span is nearly o’er.
For many years I drove a ’bus,
But never will no more.
. ...L.R.D.; Thanks; but we’re going to get that
North-South line built first —for one thing, because
the Commonwealth is pledged to build it.... J.L.W.:

“Rita”: The old N.Q. custom of tethering
obstreperous race patrons to a tree, so that
the local trooper might continue his super-
vision of the meeting (B. 4/12/’24), is still
followed on at least one racecourse in
S. Australia. Every Easter Monday the
police arrest a score or so of bookmakers and
others at the Oakbank meeting. The only
available clink near by is a small building,
part of a disused brewery. It takes about
half a dozen captured birds to fill this cage,
and the rest are tethered to surrounding
trees. As the big picnic meeting is held only
once a year the authorities do not feel in-
clined to erect anything larger.

“Merino”: It is worth Mary's while to
have a little lamb these days. One at
Merino (Vic.) has three such woolly pets,
now two-tootlis. This year they cut 601 b. of
wool, which averaged 3s. a lb. and returned
£9 to their enraptured mistress.

“Nikko”: Herewith the tale of the highest-
priced pearl-less oyster on record. It was
picked by Albert Scott, on Brown’s Island,
Auckland Harbor, and it cost him £9 in
fine and costs. It’s enough to embitter a
man against shellfish for ever.
“F.L.H.”: Advt. from Melbourne daily:
Wanted, Smart Junior Salesman, with knowledge
of Manchester, Dress and Clothing Departments, tor
good country town. Violinist preferred.
The next thing I expect to see is:—
We require six salesmen for excellent subdivision
a few miles from G.P.O. Previous experience un-
necessary, but applicants must be saxophone players
and good sightreaders. Those able to double on
the trombone and drums preferred. Apply with
music before li.—Getcher Sayles, Ltd.
“Clerk”: Vic. Railway Commissioner
Clapp has sprung into the limelight recently
as a vendor of typewriting-machines. The
Department obtains typewriters at low con-
tract rates, and Clapp announces that he is
prepared to let employees buy these machines
at the same price on the instalment system
—a fiver deposit and ten bob a pay. ’ The
only catch is that the machine must be “used
by the purchaser in connection with depart-
mental work for at least 18 months from data
of purchase.”
* * * *
“D. Mac”: How’s this for a record? Last
month a dairy farmer at Eumundi (Q.) had
65'cflws that gave a return of £lll Is. 7d.,
or an average of £1 14s. 2d. per cow. The
farmer attributes this high average to the
nourishment secured through his practice of
loosening the earth round the roots of paspa-
lum by ploughing and then following up with
the disc. This puts sustenance into the grass,
and not only makes body-building for the
young stock but increases milk production
in the older.
* * * *
“F.J.E.”: A fine bit of seamanship was
witnessed in the. Brisbane River the other
day. The Euripides had been declared black
by the waterside unions, and the crews of
the tugs refused to take her from the wharf.
Two large vessels were moored one imme-
diately ahead and the other astern, and a
strong south-easter was blowing; but Cap-
tain Gibson, of the pilot service, manoeuvred
the 14,000-tonner out into the stream under
her own power. And down the tortuous river
she went unaided, except for the direction
of the pilot in charge.
“Clerk”: In a foreword to a handsome
souvenir of the Hume and Hovell centenary
celebrations, prepared by the Albury
(N.8.W.) committee, there appears the fol-
lowing tribute to local public spirit:—
This town itself is fortunate in having in its
midst a number of citizens whose chief aim in life
is to further the interests of their own town and
never cease in their claim that Albury is the hub
of the universe.
The town has undoubtedly several of this
type of citizen, and it possesses a few good
printers also. Still, the local patriots sent
to Sydney to get their brochure printed!
“O’Back”: Despite the frequent industrial
disturbances which strain relations between
employer and employee at Broken Ilill there
are firms and cos. with records for old hands
that would take a lot of beating in less
volcanic centres. Five employees of Kidman
Bros., butchers, measured up the other day
and found they had been distributing meat
for the cattle-king for 144 years. One of
the five is G. N. Matthews, who began as a
junior clerk, was then foreman, and ended
as manager. The tally might have gone on
increasing in this case but for the fact that
Sid Kidman recently sold the business to an
outsider.
* * * *
“Coot”: Near Dandenong (Vic.) there
stood some years ago the No Good Damper
Inn. In the early ’forties a carrier carting
lime from Melbourne to Dandenong turned
his horses out to feed one night: they strayed
away from camp and it took him a couple
of hours to track them in the morning. On
his return he noticed that some of the lime
bags had been broken, and the contents
stolen. A camp of aborigines taxed with the
theft blandly assured the angry team-
ster, “No-good damper.” One De Villiers
opened a nub in the locality shortly after-
wards, and dubbed it the No Good Damper
Inn.
THE SONG OF THE SAWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Swiftly and smooth the hauler brings
Great logs from the forest green;
And blithe is the song that the fiddler sings
As she sweeps her long-toothed bow and swings
To halve the long logs clean—
“ Now you shall make stout ships for kings
Or a palace fit for a queen.”
Shrill is the song of the big band-saw
As the heavy logs move down.
The spinning teeth in her hungry maw
Moan as they rip through the timber raw
To the heart of the cedar brown—
“ You have lived your lives by the forest law
And now you shall build a town.”
Breathless and bright the gang-saw runs.
With her twenty blades in rhyme,
She takes the logs in twos and ones
But the flash of the new boards meets the sun’s
A round score at a time—
“ You shall soar again, O forest sons,
In lofty spires sublime.”
Through the hum and drive of the roaring mill
The song of the saws comes Clear;
“We have shaped you, logs from the swamp
and hill,
That the wild winds sang to, loud and shrill,
But we bid you have no fear.
When the same wind cries on mast or sill,
On soaring spire or housetop still
You shall answer, ‘We are here’!”

All the world over Rexona Children are famous for
their beautiful skin and hair. To keep that purity and
delicacy of skin health use only Rexona Skin and Facial
Soap. Washing with Rexona Soap first takes away all
impurity and dirt, then softens the skin cells and acts
as a tonic upon the cuticle so that the elasticity is
strengthened, and the result gives the soft bloom of health
that we see in early youth.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing,
healing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treat-
ment of skin affections is known throughout
the world.
Mothers! Insist that your Children use
only Rexona Soap daily, and see if it does not
quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples, and leave their com-
plexion clear, fresh and velvety. -
Rexona Children—
The Pride of
Australia.

The Bulletin’s old friend Kay Pritchard
Hughes (cetat 89), who every year trudges
all the way from Sydney to view his mother’s
grave at Goulburn, has just completed this
year’s pilgrim’s progress and celebrated the
odyssey in characteristic fashion. The hilari-
ous old sport came up before the Beak and
cheerfully pleaded guilty at his suburban
destination a day or two ago. He was con-
gratulated and fined half a crown.
“Toby C.” : At a recent horse sale in War-
wick (Q.) a buyer opened the bidding with
an offer of two bob for an upstanding five-
year-old colt. No further bids were forth-
coming, and the auctioneer closed the trans-
action with “Going at 24 pence—another
‘brownie’ anywhere? Going, goin’, gone!
Will you take five dozen at the same price?’’
The buyer declined, but wanted to claim a
decent-looking bridle attached to his two-
bob prad.
“Notfarg”: Missingham, M.L.A., is a
strong favorite on “the rivers” for the posi-
tion of President of the N. S. Wales P.P.U.,
rendered vacant through the death of C. J.
Mcßae, who was the genesis of the move-
ment. Missingham rose from the ranks, and
was President of the District Council before
being elected to the State Parliament.
Rather a unique personality in Parliament,
he threatens to biff the first man who calls
him “Strawberry.” The position of Presi-
dent of the P.P.U. is better paid than that ol
a State lawmaker, and there are several
after it.
Billy Caldwell, who has been talking on
labor topics before various Brisbane socialist
bodies, secured Westralia’s Rhodes Scholar-
ship for 1916; but instead of proceeding to
Oxford he got into khaki and spent three
years with the 48th Battalion, at the finish
sporting three stars. In 1919 he entered
Balliol, and after taking his degree with
distinction joined the League of Nations’
International Labor office in Geneva. He is
now attached to the diplomatic division there,
and, having the gift of tongues, acts as
chief interpreter to Babel. He was born at
Fremantle and educated at Perth Scotch
College and University, and is now enjoying
a long holiday.
From the N.S.W. press gallery:—
Molesworth couldn’t have given Speaker Levy a
better birthday present—Danny was 52 a few days
ago—than his anouncement that he intended throw-
ing up polities. Ever since Molesworth became an
M.L.A., in 1920, he has been the worry of Levy's
life. He rarely entered the House without having
to be repeatedly called to order, and his interjections
displayed a vocabulary that a Surry Hills hawker
would be proud to possess. On one occasion he
punctuated an address by Dr. Stopford till the
Balmain medico stopped and, gazing at the hen.
member for Cumberland, said with a sort of
fatherly patronage: “Look here, Mr. Vol Molesworth,
I never interrupt you when you’re speaking.” In
a flash came Voltaire’s reply: “Garn, yer not game.”
But it wasn’t an absence of courage that deterred
most members from tackling him; it was merely a
disinclination to give him the opening to Are off
the abuse of the fish market and the back alley.
Prince Henry, the third son of George V.,
may shortly be made Duke of Edinburgh, a
title which went into abeyance when his
grand-uncle Alfred renounced it in favor of
a return to Germany as Duke of Saxc-Coburg
Gotha. Alfred is still remembered in Aus-
tralia as much for his strictly economical
habits as for the fact that, although several
of his family were shot at, he was the only
one to be shot at and hit. Even O’FarrelPs
attempt at assassination could not make his
victim popular in Australia, while in Eng-
land he was easily last in the public fancy,
a position to which he was helped by an arro-
gant Romanoff spouse. The hoodoo that
tracked him all his life overtook his son.
who lost his job when W. Hohenzollern lost
his: and it may be as well for his grand-
nephew to consider whether the reputation
attaching to the proposed title makes it
worth while.
“Cleveland”: Faulty addition of the en-
tries on his cheque butts makes a Queens-
lander I know £93 10s. better off than he
thought he was, the mistake having occurred
13 years ago, and, the cash being at current
account, £74 worse than he would have been
had the money been at fixed deposit. Thir-
teen years ago he won £lOOO in a double,
which he placed to his credit and started to
draw cheques against it. When he had
reached what he thought was near the limit
he totted up the amounts on the cheque butts
and drew out what he reckoned was the
balance. Times went hard with him, drought
drove him off his selection, and he was
months without any sort of a job until he
headed for Mount Isa (Q.). There, through
a cousin, ho discovered that he had a credit
balance which w r as slowly being eaten up by
bank charges—they had devoured £6 10s. in
13 years. At 4 per cent, compound interest
it would have grown to £167 10s., so he is
£74 out on the deal. But if he had known
the cash was there he would have had none
of it now, so he reckons his bad arithmetic
did him a good turn, after all.

Italians would try to get work in the coal-mines.
One-fifth of the passengers were Greeks, who would
probably start fruit- and fish-stores. There were
9 Syrians, 55 Maltese, and 150 Jugo-Slavs, who
were expert lumber men.”
From far across the azure main
They come to pioneer the land ;
And some will grow the sugar-cane,
Or take the forest growths in hand.
The Skis this job or that may seek;
But fixed already is the fate,
Of each incoming fiery Greek —
He’ll serve da oyst upon da plate.
The Jugo-Slavs are hefty folk ;
They calculate to earn their cash
Where, ’neath the axe’s ringing stroke,
The forest giants reel and crash.
The men of Mussolini’s breed
Coal in the bowels of earth will hew;
But Athens’s sons will deftly feed
The city man his steak and stew.
The distant fields, they say, are green,
Across the range, beyond the flat;
But not, I think, for the Hellene —
He knows a game worth two of that.
Where festive diners spend their splosh
The Greek will wave his ready tray
And sell da fruit, or make da squash,
Or serve da oyster and da cray.

WAX Your Linoleum
JOHNSON’S POLISHING WAX (Paste and
Liquid) is endorsed by all the leading manufac-
turers of linoleum for polishing, preserving and
protecting their product. Read the paragraphs below,
which are quoted from a letter written by the
Armstrong Linoleum Co. on July 5, 1923, to S. C,
T ohnson & Son:—
“Our Research Department has tested John-
son’s Wax on a number of occasions, and has
approved it very highly for use on Armstrong’s
Linoleums. We have been recommending John-
son’s Wax in our advertising literature for pro-
bably ten years, and no user of our goods has
ever made a complaint to us regarding the satis-
faction secured by the use of Johnson’s Wax on
our linoleum.
“An application of a good wax, thoroughly
rubbed in, provides a film of wax over the surface
of the linoleum which hardens and prevents dirt
from being ground into the linoleum itself. It is,
therefore, much easier to clean a linoleum floor
that has been properly waxed, because the dirt
is readily wiped off the surface. Wax also pre-
serves linoleum and takes off a good deal of the
wear.”

Backache!
Do you rise in the morning with & groan? Do you feel
that you are getting old? Having made up your mind that
you are a martyr, do you vent your ill-humor on the family?
After a while the pain and stiffness leave you and you forget
your troubles until the next morning, when the same dull pain
in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing your nerves,
brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim and
you are starting on a long journey towards ill-health and
infirmity. The kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleans-
ing out the impurities from your blood. Each day there is an
accumulation of waste which must upset the body. It forms
Uric Acid and Uric Acid is the most insidious form of poison-
ing that can take place in your body. The number of ills
to which it leads is almost limitless and though middle age is
the most favorable season for their activity, even the youngest
child often suffers and sometimes dies from the different mani-
festations of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable,
specially-prepared remedy, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your sluggish kidneys to
re-action and assist the work of removing impurities from
your blood, which the kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that
are filtering the blood that the work is done automatically as
by a perfect machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling,
dragging feeling gradually leaves you ; in the morning you can
leap from bed, feeling a glow of health and vigor and meet
life with a smiling face.
It is the duty of every man, not only to himself but to
the world at large, to keep bis health in the proper condition
for his daily task; and for the victim of Kidney Trouble Dr.
Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost his organs need to
make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to ill-health.

Packed in the famous Red Box, which is a presentation package created to
convey, by its artistry of design and distinct color, the quality of its contents.

ful centres, and the many varieties, have induced people to come to us for

the fact that, having realised from the beginning of this business that the public
was entitled to the BEST-QUALITY Confectionery that could be made, we
have devoted all our energies to making it so.
“You can taste the quality.”
Every care is taken in packing, so that each box leaves with the assurance

Home, Dearie, Home!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Kitty was my wife a year,
With ripe and rosy lips
She tempted me one day to sing
Of sailormen and ships.
•'l'd rather sing to you,” I said,
"Of cornflowers tall and blue;
The sea is not a proper theme
For tender things like you.
••I'd rather sing of lilies white,
And roses all in bloom,
This little cottage of our own
With sink and sitting-room.
"A sucking babe upon your breast
Would dearer be to me
Than all the ships that ever sailed
Triumphant on the sea.”
"My sailorman, my lover-man,
I’d nothing of the kind ;
I’d long to feel the stinging spray,
I’d love to hear the wind.
“My sailor dear, my lover dear,
I want to go one day
And watch with you the sunset fall
On lands of far-away.
"The Seven Seas, the Seven Seas
That run from Tole to Pole —
Oh. sing to me your Seven Seas;
They call my heart and soul!”
And so I sang her “Rio Grande”
And “Never More We’ll Roam.”
But she joined me in the chorus
Of “It's Home, Dearie, Home” :
‘•Oh, there's a wind That blows, and it's blow-
ing from the west.
And of all the winds that blow His the one
that I love best ;
For it blows at oar backs, and it shakes the
pennon free,
And it soon will blow us home to the North
Countree.”
Ah. she would be a sailor lass,
And I a longshoreman !
Next year I landed at the docks
Come home from Surinam.
Her brother met me on the pier,
And when I saw the band
Of crepe, new-sewn upon his arm—
By either sea or land
I knew my dear would never roam
O’er this grey world with me.
I knew my lass had taken ship
To sail Eternity.
Ah, the winter night is falling.
And there’s mist upon the pane,
And I’ll never sing a chantey
To my pretty love again.
*S <o it’s home, dearie, home! Oh, it’s home I
want to be.
My topsails are hoisted, and I must out to
sea.
For the oak and the ash and the bonny
birehen-tree,
They’re all a-growin’ green in the North
Countree.
Oh, it’s home, dearie, home! Oh, it’s home
I want to be!

A Bad Debt.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LOUIS GOLDBERG, manager and sole
shareholder of the Atlas Loan and
Discount Company, closed his ledger
and gazed disconsolately at the huge, ela-
borately-framed oil-painting which for many
years had adorned his private office. The
picture had been hung right in front of his
desk with intent; for it represented his
supreme act of folly in the world of low
finance—a fifty-pound loan on a security
which subsequently proved to be worth less
than fifty shillings. Always, when he was
opening business with a new client, it shouted
to him “Be careful! Be careful!” And
thus far it had never shouted in vain.
Yet there was good ground for this par-
ticular evening’s depression. Every Friday
night after the clerk had gone Louis pre-
pared his soul for the Sabbath of his ances-
tors; for except in supervising the occasional
seizing of assets under bills of sale—the real
labor of which was performed by husky
Gentiles—he would never work on Satur
days. At G o’clock on Fridays, when all was
quiet, he would run through his ledger, ex-
tract the credit balances and carefully add
up the result. This week he was worth £lO
16s. 4d. less than on the previous balancing.
Three forced sales of furniture, seized under
bills of sale, had resulted in recovering
slightly less than the ledger balances. That
each account, treated as a whole, showed a
clear 30 per cent, profit was not the point.
The ledger said that another £lO 16s. 4d.
was owing, and now’ that no security was
left the amount must be written off. So it
was that the picture loomed large in Louis
Goldberg's perspective and cast a shadow
over the musty little room.
The quick opening and shutting of a door
leading from the outer offices broke his chain
of pessimistic reflection. He looked round
nervously, and saw that someone had en-
tered. Economy only permitted one gas
hght. just over the ledger; and it was not
till the intruder stepped up to the table that
his features were distinguishable.
“Why did you not knock?” he asked.
“Sorry,” was the answer, “but I’m just
back from France. I s’pose I left my man-
ners as well as other things over there.”
“You vould knock to come into the Gen-
eral’s room over there? Eh?”
“Every time. But you’re not a General,
lou’re Mr. Louis Goldberg, I believe.”
“Vat does it madder to you who I am?”
'Oh, nothing; I just called on a little
matter of business—recommended by a cus-
tomer of yours.”
Business! In a moment Louis was fuss-
ing about the room.
“Take this chair bere,” he said, and lighted
another gas-jet. Then he took what he called
his “inventory of appearances.” His beady
little eyes became alert and watchful; and
in a few seconds lie had sized up his new
client as a respectable working man looking
for a loan on the family furniture—a most
profitable line of business. When they were
both comfortably seated on opposite sides
of the table Louis opened the proceedings.
“I don’t usually do business after G
o'clock,” he said amiably, “but to oblige one
of my old customers —now what can I do for
you?”
“I have something to sell—something you
might buy from me.”
“Vat!” screamed Louis, rising from his
chair, “you come into my office —without
knocking—after business hours —to —to ■
Did you not the notice see? No hawkers
admittance? Don’t vaste my time!”
“Sit down!”
It was the way those two words came
. at him, like the crack of a two-barrelled rifle,
which made Louis realise that this was no
ordinary hawker. He gazed open-mouthed
at the intruder and wished that he had been
more careful with his “inventory of appear-
ances.” There was something menacing in
the set of that mouth, in the ugly look of
assertiveness on the lean, weather-beaten
face. It might be better to sit down.
“Vat you vant?” he growled. The old
vernacular would come back in moments of
excitement.
The visitor produced a peculiarly-shaped
metal object from his pocket and displayed
it on the table.
“I want you to buy this.”
“Vat is it?”
“A bomb I brought back from the trenches
—a real little beauty.”
“Is it—is it—loaded?”
“Of course it is. Do you think I'd try
to take you down with a dud? There’s
enough juice in this little can to turn this
office, its furniture, its books, its pictures,
its iron safe, its manager, the floor, the
ceiling, into a broth from which nothing
could ever be sorted out. A pal of mine was
monkeying with one of these things once.
All I ever found of him was a belt buckle.
Do you see this little cap on the top? Well,
you just turn it and”
“Take it away! Vat for vould I vant
such a ting?”
“Why, to keep on your mantelpiece, of
course. To remind you that we used bags
of these things as pillows, on beds made of
duckboards, with blankets made of a mix-
ture of mud and lice —while you kept the
home fires burning; while you and your
kind looked after our wives and children
and waved flags and paid your income-tax
in advance to help the Government.”
“I don’t vant no trophies, I tell you. I
have now three empty shells already at
home.”
“But you must add a real live one to your
collection. It's a damned handy tiling to
have about if someone you don't like drops
in and starts worryin’ you. I remember
once scouting round the remains of a house
near Amiens —thought it was empty—went
inside and. found three Germans there —had
my hand in my pocket and puffed the cap
off—this little cap—here—l timed it exactly.
Let me just show you how it works.”
Louis Goldberg had known fear—many
times —but this fear grew into terror. It
was a new experience. All capacity for re-
sistance was gone, and he abandoned the
business principles of a lifetime.
“I'll buy id.” he muttered ; “I vill give you
five shillings for it.”
“Five shillings! For this! My price,
Mr. Atlas Loan and Discount Company, is
£6B 10s. 9d.”
From a breast pocket he produced a letter
and repeated “£6B 10s. 9d.”
“My Gott!” cried Louis, “you blackmail
me!”
“Listen to this. On the right side, ‘The
Atlas Loan and Discount Company, Louis
Goldberg, Manager,’ in print. On the left
side, ‘£6B, 10s. 9d.,’ in writing. ‘Final notice.
Unless the above balance is paid before ten
to-morrow, my company must exercise its
rights under the bill of sale.’ This is ad-
dressed to Mrs. Maud Enright. I’m John
Enright, Private, No. 6 Company, Ith Bat-
talion, 6th Infantry. Just back from France,
and this is the welcome you send me!”
“But, my dear Mr. Enright, that was busi-
ness. I lend your good lady money to help
over her troubles only because she vas a sol-
dier’s vife. I take great risks —unregistered
bills of sale —never before till this var; and
she owe that money.”
“How much did you lend her?”
“Vat it say in that letter.”
“You old liar! Show me ydlir book.”
“My books is locked in the safe. My
clerk haf the key.”
“That book in front of you. Turn up the
account.”
“I vill not allow”
“Won’t you?” said the Digger, reaching
for the bomb.
“All right, all right. Give me time
enough,” replied Louis, his fingers fumbling
through the pages.
“Pass it over here.”
“Dere it is. Let me egsplain it.”
“I can read. Sit down, damn you.” And
Louis Goldberg, his face moist with sweat,
and trembling in every limb, again sank
back into his chair.
John Enright, with one hand always on
the bomb, rapidly glanced through the ledger
account.
“I thought so,” he said. “In the three
years you lent her sixty pounds. She has
paid you back eight-four, and you show a
balance due of £6B 10s. 9d. You dirty
thief.”
“But I lend her more than sixty pounds.
There was the costs of the bill of sale, the
search fees, the valuation of the furniture, all
sorts of liddle expenses and interest on der
renewals.”
“You little hog! I’d love to blow a dozen
of you on to the roof of Hell. Fattening here
for three years on our women while we
Make me out a clean recipt for that bal-
ance !”
“I vill not. I’ll haf the law on you for
intimidation.”
“The law!” and John laughed for the first
time. “I’m the law now! This little bit of
steel, filled with a few spoonfuls of black
stuff just like treacle, makes me law-maker,
judge and jury.”
“But my friendt—Gott, I cannot talk mit
your fingers always on that!”
“Don’t talk. Write!”

“Every Picture
Tells a Story ”
Tells on the Kidneys
Many People have found this to be true.
The strain of overwork tells on weakened
kidneys. The hurry and worry of business men,
the heavy lifting and stooping of workmen, the
women’s household cares tend to wear, weaken
and injure the kidneys until they can no longer
filter the poison from the blood, and the whole
body suffers from the waste matter that
accumulates. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
prepared especially for weakened kidneys; tired,
worn-out backs have proven their merit in
thousands of cases. Convincing proof of their
worth is here told.
SYDNEY MAN TELLS HIS STORY,
A COMPLETE RECOVERY.
Mr. H. Holder, 235 West Street, North Sydney, says:
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are indeed a wonderful
kidney medicine. I have proved this. For a long time
I suffered agony from backache and kidney trouble, and
only those who have been afflicted in this way have any
idea what I went through. My limbs swelled consider-
ably, the kidney secretions were thick and cloudy with a
red sediment, and I had agonising pains in my back. 1
was treated by a doctor and tried till sorts of remedies,
but nothing gave me the slightest relief. 1 was naturally
very worried about the serious state of my health, and
when Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under
my notice I decided "to try them. It was a grand thing
for me that I got this remedy, for seven bottles cured
me completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan's Pills
and recommend them with every confidence to other suf-
ferers.”
Eight years later Mr. Holder says: “I have still the
same good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
They cured me of kidney disorder eight years ago, and I
have had no return of the complaint since.”
At All Chemists and Stores, 2/9 per bottle, or from
Foster McClellan Co., 15 Hamilton Street, Sydney.

DOAN’S OINTMENT CURES PILES.
SYDNEY PEOPLE SAY SO.
Mrs. R. Wark, 63 Eveleigh Street,
Redfern, Sydney, says: A member of
my family suffered terribly with Pro-
truding Piles. The pain was so great
that he could not sleep at night, and
would toss about for hours. He had been
suffering for three years, and we were
always having advice and using dif-
ferent remedies, but nothing did him
any good until we got Doan’s Oint-
ment. This remedy proved excellent;
it gave complete ease. I cannot say
enough in praise of Doan’s Ointment,
and recommend its use whenever op-
portunity offers.”
Eighteen years later Mrs. Wark
says: “I am pleased to tell you that
the member of my family who w r as
cured of Piles by Doan’s Ointment over
eighteen years ago is still free from
this trying complaint. This remedy
is a certain cure for Piles.”
Mr. ,T. Mitchell, 26 Campbell Street,
Glebe, Sydney, says: “I was a sufferer
with Itching Piles for years, and I
cannot describe the agony of this ail-
ment. Scores of times I have lost
my rest, sleep being out of the ques-
tion. I used a great many Pile reme-
dies, and was treated by a doctor, but
got no relief. Keading of cures effected
by Doan’s Ointment, I decided to try
it. A few applications gave me ease,
and by continuing the treatment I
found, to my great satisfaction, that
all the pain and irritation had gone.
I am very grateful to Doan’s Oint-
ment for my cure, and advise sufferers
to try this remedy, and am satisfied
that if they follow the directions they
will soon be cured.”
Ten years later Mrs. Mitchell says:
“My husband has been free from Itch-
ing Piles since Doan’s Ointment cured
him, but he still uses this remedy now
and then, just as a preventive
against any return of his old com-
plaint.”
Price 2/9 per tin.
KEEP A TIN ALWAYS ON HAND.
IT’S A MIGHTY FINE REMEDY.
“I’ll gompromise, if you like. Led me
take twenty pounds off and I vill gif one
year, two years, to pay der balance.”
“I’ll give you three minutes to write that
receipt—say four minutes, to allow for the
trembling of your hand.” .
“But vou must let ne egsplam! It I
charge too much you can take me to court.
The Judge will fix what is fair between us.
“You’re in court, you yellow cur!”
“But if to-morrow I go to the bolice and
say you threaten me? Eh? Your receipt
don’t be worth nothing.”
“Oh, yes it will! You won’t go to the
police.”
“But I vill.”
“No, you won’t, Mr. Louis Goldberg. You
know you won’t.”
“But vy von’t I?”
“Because you will be afraid. You know
that I will come again. This little toy will
keep for years; and, besides, you ain’t game
to produce that ledger in court.”
“No. But I can produce the bromissary
notes and the bill of sale.”
“You’ve wasted two minutes out of your
four.”
“I vill not sign anyding.”
“Oh yes, you will! Look at me, you
measly little runt. Look at me and see for
yourself if I am bluffing. I, who have been
a paid man-killer for four years—paid-for
killing men, not such vermin as you. Sign
that receipt!”
And Louis looked. Ilis eyes wavered be-
fore the steady gaze of his antagonist and he
wrote out the receipt and threw it across the
table.
“Put the office stamp on it,” said Enright,
“same as is on this letter, and also a duty
stamp.”
Louis complied, and from the depths of Lis
chair muttered: “Now go. Go quick. You
haf made me ill. And take that—that with
you.”
John Enright rose, pocketed his receipt
and made for the door without his bomb.
“I sold it to you,” he said; “and you
know how cheaply.”
And then Louis made his supreme sacrifice.
Placing a bank note on the table, he whis-
pered : “Here is five pounds for you to take
it away.”
A few seconds later John Enright was
hurrying homewards with a clean receipt and
a five-pound note and his hip pocket bulging
slightly with the rejected trophy.
Half an hour later, Enright junior, aged
four and a half, was in ecstasies of expec-
tation as father produced a shining metallic
article from his pocket and placed it on the
table. Suddenly, on his finger touching a
hidden spring, the top new open and a cheer-
ful follywog leaped into view, amid shouts
of childish laughter.
“Where ever did you get that” asked his
wife.
“Bought it in Paris,” said John, “special
for the Kid.”
And for the following week no business
was done by the Atlas Finance and Discount
Company owing to the illness of its manag-
ing director.
GEORGE S. BEEBY.
The Magic Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ARTHUR WALTON was in luck. He
felt it as he walked home through
the silky night—a night brocaded
in black satin and silver, and made for the
romance that fitted with his stirred pulses—
but he did not know then just what his luck
was. All he did know was the sweetness
of that last kiss with its promise of many
ecstasies in the future.
There were five drab years behind him—
of which he admitted the drabness only now
that he felt he was definitely leaving them
behind. The estrangement with his wife
had come after three years of happy matri-
mony. He admitted that the fault was his.
Regarding unfaithfulness in men as natural
and venial, he had under-estimated his wife’s
moral attitude and her personal pride. The
estrangement, based on her discovery of some
of his unregarded backslidings, had amazed
him; yet when he realised his wife’s view-
point. he felt an involuntary increase of re-
spect for her. Repulsed in his attempts to
bridge the chasm between them, he allowed
matters to take their course until the condi-
tions became such that neither tried to alter
them.
Yet his wife’s coldness, instead of driving
him to a complete abandonment of restraint,
served to cure his amative tendencies. He
hoped that rectitude of behavior would cause
his wife to relent; and then the rectitude be-
came a habit. But Myra appeared to have
turned to ice which might never be thawed;
the mere thought of approaching her chilled
him. She was an intelligent, coolly agree-
able friend at times and usually a mode)
wife. More than that he had ceased to ex-
pect from her. Sometimes, in a fit of irri-
tation, he wished that she had divorced him
at once. But he kept his anger to himself.
The scornful look in Myra’s eyes reminded
him that whatever coldness she might show
had its justification in his own acts.
When Zarah came into his life he felt a
resurgence of old feelings in a new form.
Zarah, the dark-eyed, young middle-aged
widow —or, possibly, grass-widow—knew
how to stir him. Five years had put a great
deal of age upon him. He could no longer
plunge into the affair with youth’s light
casualness: it had become a more serious
matter to make love.
He gauged Zarah cynically, even as he re-
sponded to her challenges. Their intimacy
ripened rapidly; and though his judgment
told him that under her apparent warmth
she was selfish and mercenary, she seemed
worth while. Whatever was cheap about
Zarah she would not let herself go cheaply.
She would want his money—a lot of it —but
she would also require a personal fealty
which must eventually mean a break with
Myra. Gradually—-and swiftly though
gradually—he reached the decision that it
was time the unnatural state of affairs in
his home ended. And so he had found him-
self that night talking passionately to Zarah
of hopes and desires, of a holiday they would
take together in Tasmania. Later she was
in his arms, half-yielding, half-repulsing,
keeping her lips from him.
“Dear, I love you,” she whispered. “But
you must wait, give me time to breathe —
time to think. That is only fair if you love
me.”
Had she yielded at once she would have
been a great deal less desirable; her resist-
ance added the one touch necessary to weaken
his hungering reluctance about bringing the
rupture with Myra to a head. Her one kiss
before, laughing softly, she eluded him was
carefully calculated.
He strode away, walking on air; he was
a man exalted. When he thought of Myra
it was with a fierce exultation that she
would be punished for her coldness and in-
difference. _ .
Myra herself had felt something of the
warm romance of that night. She had de-
cided to remain at home, and had been trying
to read against the pull of the night influ-
ences. Then Charters called. On the re-
putation which was given to him by uncharit-
able friends she ought to have disliked Char-
ters and treated him with coldness; but
actually she liked him, and was glad of his
visit. He was a good singer, too; and as
she sat at the piano playing for him,
he sang with a voice which throbbed with
meaning and seemed to fit into the atmo-
sphere of the night. A sensuous fragrance
of soft air ctept through the wide-open win-
dows, redolent of the scents of the garden.
His hand dropped caressingly on her neck,
and she seemed to take no notice. But when
the caress became more palpable she left the
piano quickly and moved across the room.
Unabashed he followed her.
“Why not come out on the verandah?” he
said. “A night like this is wasted while we
stay indoors.”
They sat together in the deep shadow and
talked quietly ; and shortly he was caressing
her hand. The night intoxicated her senses
and made the flirtation delightful. She had
no real feeling for Charters; but to-night
it was a delight to have him near her. To
be wooed softly in the moonlight by anyone
was sufficiently sweet for her to postpone
the check which she knew she must give to
his growing advances; but when he declared
that he loved her, and, having watched her
for weeks, had decided that she was not
as happy as he would like her to be, she
rose to her feet. But he rose, too. and she
found herself in a fierce embrace whilst his
lips rained hot, mad kisses on her face. And
all the time she could only feign anger,
although outwardly she struggled against
him.
“But I love you, Myra !” he whispered in-
tensely. “I want you to leave Walton ! I
know you are not happy with him —that
there is estrangement between you.”
"How dare you say that?” she panted.
“I dare anything, Myra—for you. This
is the way I love you, Myra. I would never
leave you alone for other men to make love
to.”
Again his hot kisses fell on her lips; and
for a moment, her pulses all beating in defi-
ance of her moral reason, she lay unresist-
ingly in his arms. Afterwards, when she
had spoken indignant words and sent him
away, he remembered that moment of pas-
sivity and gloated upon it.
“Go! You must go!” she told him im-
periously.
“I’ll go, Myra. But I’ll come to-morrow
night; and I’ll ask you to choose between
a life with love in it and the life you are
leading!” he cried.
When he had gone she stood, feeling her-
self palpitating with something that was
not really anger. She almost wanted to
call out to him—to bring him back. The
bang of the gate as it closed behind him
sounded like the closing of a door or some-
thing that she should not have lost.
She \vas still restless with stirred emo-
tions when Arthur came in. He was sur-
prised when he saw her. There seemed to
be a deep passion in her eyes he had not
seen there for years; and her cheeks were
glowing.
“Why, Myra!” he cried. “You are look-
ing splendid !”
“Have you been enjoying yourself?” she
asked—and there w T as a w 7 arm wish in her
tone. The mere question, spoken as it was,
was sufficiently unusual to surprise him ; but
in her heart, wakened now to new feelings,
she pitied him for all he had suffered at her
hands.
“Not as I might have done if you had
let me be w T ith you—if you were not so cold
to me,” he said.
He had forgotten Zarah : and he meant it.
“Do you ever think of testing whether I
am so cold?” she smiled.
The way in which that reconciliation came
about was always a puzzle to Arthur. It
was a puzzle to Charters also. But when
he learned with bitterness that Myra and
her husband had gone away for a trip to
Maoriland together, he guessed dimly that it
w 7 as his own unwilling hand which had
stirred to new life a feeling far stronger
than any he had dreamed of.
HAMER.
One From the Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One from the Dead came back to me,
Not meek and phantom-wise,
But warm and swift and fair to see,
With anger in her eyes.
“Is it, then, kin of mine who flees
In sheer defeat?” she said.
(“Mona, Mona!”) “Up from your knees!
Face loss with lifted head!
“What if your heart be riven in twain
With the stab of broken trust?”
{“Mona, Mona!”) “Thank God for pain,
For a heart that feels the thrust.
“Stand straight, break free from clammy
fears,
Limp hands that earthward pull.
Even with anguish and fiery tears
Be glad your cup is full.
“A watery draught for the half-awake;
But—for your blood is mine—
You, my sister, must drink, nor quake,
Deep of the richest wine.”
So, proud again, I meet the strife
And doubt of each dark morrow;
I drink a steady toast to Life
In the black wine of sorrow.
