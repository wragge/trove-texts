What Makes Us Laugh
Wallace Nelson’s definition of laughter and
its causes (R.P. 30/10/’24), while good so
far as it goes, does not cover the whole
ground. “A sudden and unexpected transi-
tion in consciousness from the great to the
little” is certainly one cause of laughter;
but there are others. “It is the sudden
transition that produces laughter,” says Mr.
Nelson. But almost any sudden transition
produces laughter; iff* is the sudden shift, the
surprise, the unexpected incongruity that
touches off the fuse.
(1) “Descending incongruity. From the
sublime to the ridiculous is but a step, and
when that step is taken we laugh—if we do
not weep. An example in story form is
Mark Twain’s burlesque speech:—
Shakspeare is dead: Milton has left us and I
don’t feel very well myself.
An example in the form of incident was
given by Charlie Chaplin in “The Idle Class, ’
when, after making a most elaborate toilet
(only the upper part of his body being seen
on the screen), he walked off without his
trousers.
(2) Any sudden transition, not necessarily
from the great to the little. Example :
Drunk on tram-car: “Is this Pitt-street or
Tuesday?”
(3) Any decided incongruity, not neces-
sarily in a descending order. There is still
plenty of fun in the old story about the
bathers getting their clothes mixed, and a
big man having to struggle into a suit many
sizes too small for him, while a little man
slops home in the big man’s togs. No doubt
the humor is heightened by making the
bathers men of social importance ; but this
is not east ntial to the joke.
(4) Surprise. The Americans are firm
believers in surprise as the chief element in
provoking laughter. In telling a humorous
story they carefully reserve the “cracker ’
to the very end, where it comes in with
explosive effect. A well-worn example is
the story of the Pullman passenger who
tipped the negro porter to be sure to wake
him up and put him off at Buffalo. He heard
a great commotion early in the morning, but
turned over and went to sleep again. When
he awoke again he was hundreds of miles
past Buffalo. He complained to the porter,
who exclaimed in astonishment: “Ilully gee !
Who was dat chap I trew off at Buffalo?”
(5) Innuendo. Example:—-
I have three brothers living—and one in Melbourne
(or Sydney, as the case may be).
Years ago, in Melbourne, the single word
"Footscray!” was sufficient to provoke a roar
of laughter—ror a free fight. Innuendo about
the perfume of the Yarra or the chances of
stopping a bullet in Fitzroy are still uproari-
ously comic—in Sydney ; while Melburnians
find food for laughter in Sydneysiders’ pride
in "our ’arbor.”
(6) Exaggeration. This form of humor
has been done to death, bflt there is no deny-
ing its explosive effect, when well done. For
examples, see any book of American humor.
(7) Understatement. A more subtle form
of humor is understatement. When the
battler who has been kicked out of an hotel
picks himself up with the remark “I see what
it is; they don’t want me in there,” we
laugh because it is such a ludicrous under'
statement of the facts. Similarly, when Mark
Twain, .after having been abused like a pick
pocket by the agricultural editor whose place
he had taken, observes quietly: “I gathered
that he was displeased, with me.”
(8) Ellipsis. The humor here consists In
leaving out the essential part of the story,
which the reader or hearer has to supply for
himself. Ambrose Bierce was the great
master of this form of humor. Examples
(I quote from memory) :
Desperado Dick, the gunman of Dead Dog Gulch,
arrived in town yesterday. He was met at the stage
by Sheriff .iones, who leaves a large family and
will be regretted in the district.
Two citizens had an argument over a land deal in
Main-street yesterday. It is understood that the
widows will continue the litigation in the courts.
A rigid analysis would reduce these classes
by combining several of them as subdivisions
under a common heading; put I think it is
clear that there are more causes of laughter
than the Nelsonian-Spencerian one sole cause
of “descending incongruity.”
Of course, there are many forms of humor,
and those the highest—the humor of Shaks-
peare, Cervantes, Molifere, Scott, Sterne,
Dickens, Barrie —which may incline us more
to tears than to laughter; but these do not
concern us here.

Man and His Eyes
Small wonder that The Bulletin and
the Melbourne Argus animadverted on the
extraordinary cable emanating from the Sur-
gical Congress sitting in New York, winch
purported to set forth the views on vision
held by Dr. Lindo Ferguson, the Maori-
land ophthalmic specialist! No sooner had
we parted with the notable educationist, Dr.
Adams, who said that we lacked culture and
did not read half enough, than we received
a bombshell that too much reading was bad
for our eyes, these delicate organs being in-
tended by Nature for use in the jungles look-
ing out for wild animals and searching for
food. _
Primitive man was a very dull and poor-
witted creature, scarcely, if at all, superior
in intelligence to the gorilla: he did not
bother himself about, anything except the
chase and the spying out of a lurking foe,
thereby, from constant practice, developing
a most acute vision for distance. This char-
acteristic persists even to this day in the
tracking abilities of Binghi and the Rea
Indian; the dwarf African Bushman is
likewise highly being able to spot
a carrion bird high up m the sky miles
away, and can also follow with incredible
swiftness a honey-bird in its flight to the
sweet store concealed in a tree ah unbeliev-
able distance away. There was not much
fn 1 nrinvitfv e* * mi fl C ° consequently !" it*™-
mained poorly developed, and millions of
vears must/ have passed before it attained
anything like perfection. If he had pos-
sessed even a moderate-sized pre-frontal area
of the brain which controls muscular activi-
ties and delicate visual adjustments, it
not likely that he would have put up with
unpolished stone implements for countless
centuries ; sooner or later he would have, hat
a brain-wave, and seen that chipping them
and polishing them improved their uselui-
ness. But it does not follow that becauso
human eyes were not specially constructed
for near work much reading is bad tor
them, and that it is largely responsible tor
the amount of eye-diseases met with in
modern practice. What was probably
meant —and probably said, too —was that too
much reading in children and youth under
poor hygienic conditions, and under pool
illumination, brought about a host of eye*
complaints, chief amongst which might be
placed myopia, to which unfavorable school
conditions, such as the stooping position,
undoubtedly contribute. Also, home lessons
under bad illumination predispose to the on-
set of myopia, and such lessons for this
reason ought to be curtailed or cut out, be-
cause parents, as a rule, don’t worry them-
selves about such trifles as deficient illumina-
tion. They are unaware that children have
soft and delicate eye-structures which are
liable to be stretched when all common-
sense rules are set at defiance.
If it had been suggested that the. small
type used in printing books was injurious to
the eyes, especially when presbyopia has
developed, there would have been much sense
in it, this being a subject which wants
serious consideration. I would advocate large
type on India paper for presbyopes, and this
innovation might lead to a great deal more
reading than is indulged in at present.
A simple test will show that our eyes were
meant for distant and not for near vision.
When the eyes are closed for some time and
are suddenly opened their axes will be found
to be parallel, and not in a converging posi-
tion, nor even in a position midway between
the two. Vision played a leading part in
evolution, and an enormous jump in the
visual area in the brain occurred in the mar-
moset, the lowest of the simians, as compared
with the little pro-simian Tar sins (the spec-
tral tarsier of Borneo), fortunately alive
to-day and in nowise altered from its pris-
tine form. Advantage has been taken of this
fact by Professors Elliot Smith and ,T. I.
Hunter, the latter in “Brain,” describing
the oculomotor nuclei of this animal, which
was admitted into the distinguished order
of the primates on account of its large visual
brain-area. When animals took to an
arboreal life the sense of smell was not so
necessary as heretofore, so that vision, the
tactile sense, muscular agility,, etc., de-
veloped at the expense of the olfactory sense.
Although this little primate, which can be
held comfortably, with a young one, in the
hollow of the palm, possessed visual charac-
teristics 1 which left animals lower in the
scale, such as the jumping shrew (which has
an enormous olfactory apparatus), leagues
behind it, it had not arrived at the finer
points, such as stereoscopic vision, which
distinguish the higher primates. Professor
Smith says with truth: “One of -the most
significant of the changes that occur in the
transition from the pro-simian to the simian
stage—in other words, that mark the acquisi-
tion of stereoscopic vision—is the splitting
up of the nucleus for convergence, so that
each eye can be focussed independently of
the other upon any object. Thus two sharply-
defined and exactly-focussed images can bo
obtained even if the object is seen obliquely,
and is therefore further away from one eye
than the other.” The spectral tarsier, for
instance, has binocular vision—the snout has
disappeared to allow the eyes to come fur-
ther forward; but it does not possess the
mechanism for the associated movements of
the eyes in all directions without moving the
head. It gets out of this difficulty by focus-
sing both eyes on the object to be examined,
and in order to do this it has the power of
moving its head on the neck through an
angle of nearly ISO degrees.
It is certain, with regard to vision, that
man possesses a keener direct vision than
animals, although in indirect vision he is
surpassed by the higher animals. Man has
a tiny area of direct vision called the macula
lutea: vision 10 degrees from this point drops
to one-tenth, and the periphery (indirect vision)
is used for discerning moving objects, and
for seeing in the dark. At best our eyes
are an imperfect optical apparatus, as was
observed by the great Helmholtz; and. in
the words of Eindo Ferguson, they have not
kept up with the demands made upon them
by civilisation, so that it behoves us to take
the greatest possible care of them. But as
for reading being harmful under proper con-
ditions of illumination and with decent type,
that is a perfectly absurd contention.

John Wesley: Statesman
According to the figures collected at the
decennial census, Methodism in Australia
makes a very good showing; but its power
and influence are not gaugeable from statis-
tical returns. In the cities of the Common-
wealth and the large seaport towns of the
coast, Methodism is representative mainly
of a highly respectable, well-to-do religious
formalism. In country and bush towns
Methodism is militant, educative, prosely-
tising and self-sacrificing. The Catholic
priest and the Wesleyan preacher are the
two only links with the great outside world
of thought that many an isolated Australian
homestead knows.
‘ln an age which boasted many eminent
men two names are invested with a world-
wide significance—that of the creator of the
British Empire (in its modem sense) and
that of the organiser of the spiritual revival
called Methodism. The first, the elder Wil-
liam Pitt, was, owing to the obstinacy of
his king, powerless to keep intact the Em-
pire he had created; the second, in spite of
the cold indifference, and frequently the
determined hostility, of the church of which
he never ceased to be a member, established
a spiritual dominion in America which has
outlasted the Revolt of the Thirteen
Colonies, and is to-day one of the greatest
of religious institutions in modern times.

the exclusion of all other cloths
by those who have once worn
them.
Fine cloths call for fine yarns,
finely spun from finest Australian
wools.
To produce a light-weight Fox
superfine cloth it is necessary to
spin the yarn to such fineness
that a mile weighs less than an
ounce.
Look for the Fox Trade Mark
which gives entire satisfaction
because it is backed by this
guarantee
Fox’s Cloths are all pure woo!
and will not shrink or fade by

“Thfme’S'tTdevelopment of the religious
of o< rel'igious° he % “he
evolutionary medium. John Wesley approxi-
mated in character and in methods, at one
point or othoV, to the three men of genius
in religious creativeness whose names have
ust been mentioned. Like Luther, he em-
marked in a work of moral reformation,
through religious media, without any idea
into what galley his zeal would carry him,
but his initiative was reactionary, rather
than revolutionary. Albeit, lie sought,
Luther at the beginning of Ins career, to
reform and to remodel, not to disrupt and
to recreate. Like “General Booth at a
later date, he was compelled, by the exigen-
cies of his environment, to make his appeal
to the lower strata of the community and
to work upon the religious emotions ot the
uneducated; yet his sympathies were
always with literary culture, and he held m
high esteem the amenities of good society.
Though John Wesley rapidly became the
master spirit of the purely religious move-
ment of the little society of Oxford students,
his younger brother, Charles, was really its
founder. The small band communicated
every week, fasted regularly on Wednesdays
and Fridays and during Lent, read and dis-
cussed the Bible in common, eschewed luxu-
ries, shunned amusements, visited the sick
and the inmates of gaols, and were called
“Methodists” —a college nickname bestowed
in mockery. So Wesley began his long mis-
sion as a somewhat narrow and strict-
minded ascetic of the school of Archbishop
Laud. He next fell under the influence
of William Law, an emotional zealot of the
extreme evangelical type. It was not until
his return to England from an unpropitious
mission to Georgia that he came in contact
with Peter Bohler, a Moravian teacher or
brother, who practically became for a period
his spiritual director. But, greatly devel-
oped though he became, on the spiritual side
of his nature, it was his genius for organisa-
tion and leadership that constitutes his claim
to a place in history.
Like Loyola, he believed in visions and
visitations, supernatural appearances, etc.;
and, like Luther, he was ever prepared for
a personal combat with the Evil One. Fie
was too strong-minded to succumb, as did
the poet Cowper, to spiritual despair; but.
he believed literally in the Biblical doctrine
of witchcraft, and regarded as impious the
cessation of the legal prosecution of witches
and wizards. With Dr. Johnson, he gave
complete credence to the existence of ghosts,
which a dozen Cock-lane exposures could
not have destroyed. But withal he was a
keen observer, and in his enormous literary
output he is to be noted as remarking on
the scandalous irregularities of the political
representation of his period. Though not
qualified as a medical practitioner, he. set
up a dispensary, and gratuitously adminis-
tered remedies to the poor. He believed in
the medical utility of electricity, and. strongly
advocated the practice of inoculation. He
was also one of the first to draw. attention
to the horrors attending the traffic in slaves;
he reprobated the vile conditions of the gaols
which created the fearful pestilence of
“prison-fever”; and he collected money for
the relief of French captives of war. In
short, to quote the language of historian
Lecky: “It is no exaggeration. to say that
he has had a wider constructive influence
in the sphere of practical religion than any
other man who has appeared since the six-
teenth century.”
That Episcopalian Methodism is. to-day
the leading denominational body in the
United States, and has considerable repre-
sentation also in South America, is due to
a master-stroke of his statecraft. All his
life clinging tenaciously to the Church of
England, he was greatly perturbed by the
Revolt of the Thirteen Colonies, which im-
perilled the continuity of ordination. Even
in England itself Wesley frequently, but
ineffectually, endeavored to obtain for his
Methodist preachers episcopal recognition,
and in 1763 induced a Greek bishop, then
visiting Britain, to consecrate one of
them —a step which caused great commo-
tion. Drawing a bow at a venture, lie .him-
self consecrated Thomas Coke the first bishop
of the American Methodist Church —a bold
stroke of statecraft which has had the most
far-reaching consequences.
John Wesley died in 1791. at the great
age of 88; but, as Lecky, the historian, points
out. he lived to see the sect he founded
number more than 70,000 souls upon Bri-
tish soil, and about 300 itinerant and 1000
local preachers raised up from his own
people; whilst the different branches of
Methodists in the world numbered, even
a quarter of a century ago. no fewer
than 12 millions of adherents. “They have,”
writes Lecky, “already far outnumbered
every other Nonconformist body in England
and every other body in the United States,
and they are probably destined largely to
increase, while the influence of the move-
ment transformed for a time the whole spirit
of the Established Church, and has been
more or less felt in every Protestant commu-
nity speaking the English tongue.”

Literary Collaboration
Collaboration in fiction is rarely successful:
generally the product, under the influence of
unconscious restraint, exhibits the deficiencies
rather than the excellencies of the literary
partners. Within present memory Erck-
mann-Chatrian, in France, and Besant and
Rice, in England, showed the possibility of
making it both successful and continuous.
They were, however, the exception, not the
rule; and even in their cases it meant much
expenditure of time and waste of effort and
material.
In “The Nature of a Crime,” a recently
published fragment of collaboration between
the late Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox
Hueffer, the surviving partner gives an in-
teresting account of the working of the pro-
cess. Hueffer had already collaborated with
Conrad in “The Inheritors” and “Romance,”
neither of which can claim to have been a
conspicuous success, lhe collaboiatio
he tells us, almost purely oral
We wrote and read aloud the one to
Possibly in the end we even wrote to ‘“d a loud t

But as often as not, by a leal telepathy, . ,
eves on the page and my voice going on, I would
grow aware of an exaggerated stillness on the pa t

an ice age. Yes, it was the stillness of a prisoner

On the other side of the hearth I would Jiave a

of fingers contorted. . . -I, would rend on lo g
time it would come: «°h !.. •-Oh, °h 1• •. .Oh, mj
G0d.... My dear Ford.... My deal fellah.
So much for partner Conrad; now as to
partner Hueffer: —
For myself I would listen always with admiratiom
And if there were admirablenesses that did hot seem
to me to fit in with the given scene ! I could .at. least,
at the end of the reading, say with peitect smcei ity.
“Wonderful! How you do things !’’ before beginning
on: “But don’t you, perhaps, think ....
The writer does not fail to add that these
differences of opinion were maintained m a
good temper and without quarrel. I really do
ESSES" he says, “that either my coiiabora-
tor or myself ever made an objection which
was not "jointly sustained.” sub-
editing of his partners copy appears to
have been somewhat drastic. When I last
looked through the bound proofs: o
‘Romance,” says Hueffer, I was struck
with the fact that, whereas my collaboiatoi
eliminated almost every word of action ahd
SO per cent, of the conversations by mysclt,
I supplied almost all the descriptive passages
of the really collaborated parts—and such
softer sentiment as was called for. And my
collaborator let them go through. One can
picture Conrad with a grim smile on his lace
passing the “softer sentiment • .
As a contrast to this serious business of
collaboration, here is Walter Besant s de-
scription of how he and Rice conceived and
gave birth to that lovable ne er-do-well, Dick
Mortiboy:—
I wish I was five-and-twenty years younger, sit-
ting once more in that dingy little office—handy tor
Rule’s and oysters. We would adjourn loi the
“delicious mollusc” and then go back again to the
editor’s room to resume the wrangle Here we
would be interrupted by Julia, who brought the
bookbinder’s account; or by the h
thirsty hack who brought his copy, and ™ith
aroma of rum. In the evening we would dine
together or go to a theatre, or sit in my chambeis
and play cards before resuming the wangle. Ami
always during that period, whatever we did, wherever
we went, Dick Mortiboy sat between us.
One almost regrets that journalism and the
making of novels—to which there is no end
—has become such a respectable trade. You
could not imagine Mr. Lord Madox Ilueffu
in such a galley. He and his collaborator sa
on opposite sides of the domestic hearth.
Of the Erckmann-Chatnan collaboration
an interesting sidelight lias been given by
Edmond About. “The two friends, he said
“see one another very rarely. When they
do meet they elaborate together the scheme
of a work. Then Erckmann writes it, Chat-
rian corrects it, and sometimes puts it m the
fire.” ~
The analysis of “Romance give l ? 1 n all
appendix to this little volume, is illuminat-
ing We find Conrad writing: I remember
the' indescribable” When these words
have passed through collaborator Hueiter s
hands they read: “I remember the chilly
smell of the typical West Indian store, the
indescribable smell of damp gloom, of locos,
of pimento, of olive-oil, of new sugar, of new
rum.” It recalls the incident related by
A. C. Benson of the diligent man whose
hasty and un considered writings were
forcible, lively and lucid,” but who was
ashamed of them for being so rough, where-
fore he polished and polished till ‘ the thing
was really unintelligible; it liad no motion,
no space about it.”
By this time we have arrived at some con-
clusion why the twins, “The Inheritors” and
“Romance,” never breathed the breath of
success. They were overlaid by Mr. Hueffer.
T. B. C.
Pursuers?
“Women desive pursuers,” declared Lester
Way (R.P. 2/l(J/’24),and proceeded to make
public their methods of securing them.
Acquaintance, friend, companion, lover, hus-
band — a n these a woman may desire. But
“pursuers,” no; for she knows how often
pursuit becomes persistence and finally de-
velops into persecution. Deep down in every
woman’s heart is hidden away a vision
the vision of “her man.” She does not know
when, or if ever, she will meet him; but
the modern woman is no foolish virgin, and
is always prepared. It is for him she adorns
herself, and for him alone that she constantly
practises those feminine artifices some men
recognise, appreciate and .understand in a
woman, and others describe as angling
for all and sundry. These are the days of
equality of the sexes and mutual adjustment.
Daphne is a back number, and xApollo out
of a job. The modern woman is too sure of-
herself to seek refuge in flight: in offence
she is the equal, of man, in defence his
superior; and instead of being a “pursuer”
he is merely a participator on sufferance in
the most fascinating and wonderful game in
the world —the game of love —wherein
woman displays the skill she has inherited
and man has only acquired. If he cools off
he is left to get warm again unaided; if lie
becomes too previous he is put back in his
place; and, after exhausting all the antics
“instinct, the inherited experience of the
race,” tells him his ancestors practised (from
the same cause the woman recognises them),
lie has to lay his cards on the table and
accept terms not of his own choosing.
The most amusing exponent of the great
game is the man who adopts the attitude of
“not trying to catch a woman.” He is
always “easy,” and soon finds that some
woman has caught him, inspected him at her
leisure, found him just the same as the rest
and labelled him not wanted on the voyage.
Finding himself superfluous, he tries to depre-
ciate our greatest charm by accusing us of
being “all alike.” when he knows too well
we are all totally different, and admits his
inability to classify us by taking refuge in
that vague expression, “most women,” mean-
ing thereby the few he has met and the
still smaller number with whom he has been
on intimate terms. In these enlightened days
which threaten to end in a total absence of
consequences, men who consider themselves
successful lovers, and who ascribe their con-
quests to some weird masculine attribute they
fancy they possess that appeals to. “most
women,” would get the shock of their lives
if they could read the minds of many of
their “victims.” Women are curious about
men. The “desire to understand, to fathom,
to investigate” is not peculiar to the male
species and, coupled with a certain amount
of toleration, is responsible for a lot more
in women than most men would deem pos-
sible. .
With her ever increasing invasion of his
domain, man’s ancient role of “pursuer” of
woman has disappeared. He is slowly but
surely ridding his mind of the obsession that
her greatest ambition is to “catch a man”
for a husband, and is displaying a growing
tendency to refrain from constantly reminding
every woman he meets of her sex. She has
pulled him down from the pedestal he occu-
pied all too long, stripped him, marked all
his secret imperfections, and decided he is
“no better than he should be.” She wants
him—sometimes. He is handy to have about
the place—occasionally. He is all right in
his way—but frequently in the way. And
with the discovery of his many weaknesses
and frequent abandonment of his duty as
“protector,” many women say with Laurence
Hope—
Yet this were folly indeed: to bind in fetters of
permanence
A passing dream whose enchantment charms because
of its transcience,
while legislators suggest amendments of the
marriage or divorce laws.
But we live in a degenerate age. The
Ford car has superseded the steed of Young
Locliinvar, and a well-clad man snooping
around with a box of chocolates, seats at a
picture show, or cheap jewellery has sup-
planted the hairy person who depended upon
his strong right arm and his club to get him
a wife. Lochinvar and the hairy person
were rough lovers, but they Were “square
dinkum,” and their intentions were strictly
honorable. Incidentally, they were faithful
to their woman ;so the modern female looks
back on them with admiration while eyeing
their successors with disdain, and murmurs
“Pursuers?” with the accent on the note of
interrogation.
RITA COGHLAN.
A Satchel of Books
Sails of Sunset, by Cecil Roberts (Heinemann).
Last year this writer’s first novel, “Scissors,” caught
the Red Page’s eye. There is in this second story
much of the same facility in character-drawing, the
same capacity for genial satire, and the same ability
to keep things moving without forced haste. The
Venetian panorama before which the characters play
their parts furnishes Mr. Roberts with ample oppor-
tunity for the “purple patches” which give color
and atmosphere. The book well maintains a reputa-
tion won by the sudden stroke of his first novel.
The Autobiography of a Caddy Bag, by “Stancliffe”
(Methuen). This writer is well known to golfers
as the author of “Golf Do’s and Dont’s” and other
primers. Here, endowing a carldy-bag with person-
ality, he narrates, the experiences of the clubs it
holds. They discuss the merits of their master, the
humiliation inflicted by the untrained beginner and
their triumph in the hands of the skilled player.
The book is written to attract the outsider who
someday “hopes to take up the game,” while it is
ri(h in suggestions by which the old hand may profit.
Legs Parsons, by Ferdinand Berthond (Morton,
Batch, N’York). A story of up-country Africa. The
author lived there for over 13 years, as diamond
and gold miner, storekeeper, surveyor; and m
the story of a long trek by ox-waggon in search of
mysterious diamond fields we have a chronicle ot
real doings, handled with such vigor that the move-
ment of the toiling oxen is the only slow action
throughout. Both to youth with adventure in the
blood and to age looking down the years of great
pioneering efforts, the book will have a charm.
Isvor, by Princess Bibesco, translated by Hamish
Miles (Heinemann). Isvoi —the name means a spring
—is a Roumanian village in a country of willows, in
this willow-land stands Brancovan Palace, the ances-
tral estate of the Princess. To this estate she returns,
doubtful of the fealty of a lover and seeking refuge
in “a flight behind the willows.” It is with life in
this remote village that this chronicle deals; it is
neither novel nor travel tale, but a picturesque and
attractive collection of fragments, a literary medley,
into which are gathered vivid sketches of the people,
glimpses of the beauty of the land, and fascinating
stories of its folk-lore.
Chestnuts Re-roasted, by Seymour Hicks (Hodder
and Stoughton; Angus and Robertson). As tne
author of “Difficulties,” Seymour Hicks is already
almost as widely known on the bookstalls as on tne
stage. A sub-title to this new volume is A Collec-
tion of Perhaps Funny Stories,” and in a preface
Mr. Hicks offers an explanation—it is scarcely an
apology—for the “re-roasting” of the chestnuts. Once
a story appears in type it becomes dead as a
novelty or as an original thing, and can therefore
never again be repeated in the club lounge. Ao
longer need the clubman, “trembling and unaimed,
enter the lounge to face “the very latest quip,
which was old when his own father told it to mid.
The weapon of publication will kill it. As would be
expected, a large proportion of the nuts come from
the stage, the studio and the courts, and are associ-
ated with such familiar names as Irving, H. J.
Byron, Toole, Grossmith, Burnand, Wilde, Tree,
Barrie, Grundy and Clement Scott. A capital book
for odd moments.
The Black Hood, by Thomas Dixon (Appleton,'
NY.). Readers of this author’s “The Clansman,
upon which “The Birth of a Nation” “picture” was
built, will be familiar with the birth also of the
Ku lilux Klan. “The Reconstruction Government had
been established by the bayonets of the Northern
army. The negroes, wearing yet the rags of tour
thousand years of slavery, suddenly clothed with
the sovereign power of the ballot, were allowed to
vote on the same day to enfranchise themselves and
disfranchise their former masters —sons of the men
who had created the American Republic.” The
Ku Klux Klan appeared—white robed and hooded
horsemen. “On the night before the election ghosts
rapped on every negro’s door. In sepulchral tones
they warned the black citizen that death awaited
him in the morning if he dared to vote.” The present
story deals with the days when the old Klan was
tottering to its fall. It is a dramatic and picturesque
setting of what in their essence are historical facts,
and in these days of disordered and diseased fiction
is more than twice welcome.

“T. Jasper”: “C. McL.” makes a slight error when
he includes Catherine of Russia amongst the three
women against whom Frederick the Great established
his military reputation (R.P. 30/10/’24). It was
Elizabeth of Russia who was allied with France and
Austria against Prussia during the Seven Years War.
The turning point of the war for Frederick was
when Elizabetli died and her successor, Peter 111.,
completely reversed his predecessor’s policy. Peter
reigned only a few months, being deposed in a
revolution which Catherine, the wife of his bosom,
promoted. Catherine was proclaimed Czarina, but
refused to renew the alliance which formerly existed
between Elizabeth and Maria Theresa. Later Cathe-
rine's own interests clashed considerably with those
of the great Prussian, but the pair were never
actually at war.


The Burroughs Duplex
—a machine
with a memory!
If you knew a man who could add several
groups of figures—one after the other —and
then remember all the totals so that he could
instantly write the grand total of all the
groups, you would consider him very unusual,
wouldn’t you?
Certainly you would! But any one of your
employees using a Burroughs Duplex can do
the same thing. The Duplex will add groups
of figures, furnish totals and then produce a
grand total without relisting or re-adding a
single item. It is really two adding machines
in one!
This remarkable machine will also list two
sets of figures alternately, give an inde-
pendent total of each and a combined total of
the two if desired.
The Burroughs Duplex Adding and Listing
Machine brings added speed and accuracy to
the handling of all kinds of dissection work,
such as sales by assistants, commodities or
departments. It will also list cost and selling
price, quantities and amounts, gross and net,
debits and credits, cash and discount, in one
operation and give an independent total of
each.
Much time is needlessly wasted in making
two operations of work which the Burroughs
Duplex—the adding machine with a memory
—will take care of in one. Think of the time,
labour and money that this machine will save
you in your business.
Let the Burroughs representative show
you how the Burroughs Duplex will help you.

The Parramatta River.
Fairest thou art in flush of roseate dawn,
Like beauty wakened after pleasant sleep;
Soft breezes dimple smiles where waters
deep .
See the high curtains of the mist withdrawn.
Oft at the noon, when scowling winds arise,
The western gale makes foam-capped
passion reign
For a wild hour, but soon thou smilest
again
And all is calm and wondrous to our eyes.
At eve the homing seabirds downward gaze,
A shrinking collier churns its noisy way,
The twinkling gleams of boats light up the
shore
And sable night her mantle gently lays
Along the waters. Lo, another day
With mists and rosy lights is at the door!

Black and White.
The black of sorrow was her gown,
The soft black sorrow falling down.
She had a wisdom in her eyes
That held the light of blinding skies.
Sweet as a garden in the rain
My lady was, the Maid of Pain.
My lady hid her blistered hands,
My lady loved her galling bands.
Now is she clothed in happiness—•
In garments of its white largesse.
(I used to say “When she is dead
Let her be kissed and comfc-ted.”)
But 10, she is free of circling seas
And purple hills and calling breeze!
None may follow her laughter’s flight,
She is a Lady of Delight.

Creep thou up to my shoulder,
Lean there thy head;
Thou wilt forget, when older,
Love was thy bed.
Only the old remember:
Youth in its day
Knows but its burning ember —
Age, the decay.
Hush, then, and slumber;
Hush. then, nor ail!
What should thee cumber,
Small and so frail?
Ah, with my arms for cover,
Sleep yet awhile;
Love, that must pine thy lover,
Waits but thy smile.

Gently the grey earth sleeps; and overhead
The stars draw threads of gold from height
to height
To snare the winged minutes in their
flight
And measure out the time already sped.
O come, kind Death, on such a night as this ;
And I shall welcome you and steal away
As softly as these fleeting minutes go
To break the star-threads with a tender kiss,
Knowing that I shall find a wondrous day
Waiting to greet me with its friendly glow.

Once When She Thought Aloud.
“I’ve had all of the apple,” she said,
“Except the core.
All that many a woman desires,
That and more—
Children, husband and comfort enough
And a little over.
Hungry Alice and bitter Anne
Say I’m in clover.”
“I’ve had all of the apple,” she said,
“All that’s good.
At times I feel I’d throw it away,
The wholesome food—
Crisp, sweet flesh, snowy-cool, and skin
Painted bright—
To have a man that I couldn’t bear
Out of my sight!”

Day’s End.
The trees are gold in the dying sun,
The greens grow brown and dark;
I know where little wind-gusts run
By the sway of hanging bark.'
Brown, huddled boulders closer press.
Only the mopoke calls
By their cold, mossy loveliness;
The gloaming’s on the falls.
The reservoir, ’mid solemn hills,
Broods like an exiled sea,
Drowning a hundred singing rills
In dark tranquillity.
Faint echoes sound of flashing spray,
And noon’s incessant drone; ’
An unrecoverable day
Has gone and I’m alone.

TWO INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE
MADE AUSTRALIA TIRED.
In the process of plaguing Australia with
their malevolent work-stoppages the ill-condi-
tioned tyrants of the maritime and waterside
unions have unwittingly made two things
plain. The first is that the sorry joke of
Hughes’s steamers has lasted long enough;
the second, that the Navigation Act will have
to be mended or ended. Fundamentally, each
of these remarkable institutions is a favor
bestowed on a relatively small section at the
expense of the whole people, and since the
community has been requited with ingrati-
tude and insolence and vulgar oppression
and systematic attacks on its trade and in-
dustry, it is clearly entitled to withdraw
the boons and make other arrangements.
Government ownership of steamers is the
policy of Australian unionism, and the Com-
monwealth liners were bought and built in the
special interest of the maritime unions. They
pay the highest wages in the world, and, as far
as the crews are concerned, are the most
comfortable vessels afloat. But the section
in enjoyment of these privileges has become
so infected with Soviet ideas of discipline,
introduced by imported officials, that the
working of the Government steamers has
become a world’s jest. A large part of the
fleet is always tied up because, in the cir-
cumstances, there is no cargo available, and
the vessels in commission are rarely without
a hold-up. Sometimes the hold-up occurs
because the union insists on selecting the
crew; sometimes because unionists have
signed on in spite of this mandate and are
therefore branded as “scabs,” the ship being
declared “black” until they are dismissed.
Sailing orders have had to be cancelled be-
cause the line engaged British seamen in
Australia, because it chartered vessels in
England, because it got fed up with a bos’n
addicted to making speeches, and because
it refused to re-employ a body of stewards
who disobeyed orders on the high seas. In
the result, of course, the line is unable to
guarantee that it will lift and deliver goods
or passengers, as the case may be, according
to schedule. And the taxpayer has to find
£1,250,000 a year to keep this delirious ex-
periment in the new socialism going.
* * * »
The Navigation Act reserves the coasting
trade of the Commonwealth and its posses-
sions for ships on the Australian register,
the idea being to build up a great Austra-
lian mercantile marine. It was a fine idea,
as C. C. Kingston conceived it in the origi-
nal draft of the bill, but it has borne bitter
fruit: since the Act was brought into opera-
tion there has been a reduction of passenger
tonnage, a curtailment of services, a loss of
trade to remote ports and periodical out-
breaks of job-control. And the Tariff Board
reported in June, 1923, that “much of the
benefit conceded by the tariff is lost through
the additional cost in freight on Australian
goods,” and that “our primary producers and
manufacturers will not be able to obtain the
full share of the markets they are entitled
to until some other methods can be adopted
to provide a service that will not place our
shippers at a disadvantage.” These state-
ments have been challenged, but there can
be no arguing against the evidence quoted
by two of the Royal Commissioners who re-
ported in August last on the working of
the Act: —
A Queensland co. with a capital of £275,000 is
manufacturing cement. Cement can be shipped from
Britain to Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and
Brisbane for 245. per ton, whereas the co. has been
paying 41s. per ton from Brisbane to Cairns and
355. per ton from Brisbane to Townsville.
A Cairns merchant bought some porcelain crockery
from a factory in Westralia. The shipping cost
from Fremantle was 90s. for 40 cubic feet —20s.
more than the rate from Britain. He now buys
British goods, although the quality of the Westralian
article was quite satisfactory.
Australian maize-growers have been suffering from
the competition of S’African maize, which is largely
nigger-grown. The rate on maize from Cairns to
Melbourne is Is. Ofd. per bushel; from S’Africa to
Melbourne Is. 2d. per bushel.
The charge for shipping fencing-wire from London
or New York to Fremantle is 38s. per ton; from
Newcastle (N.S.W.) to Fremantle 425. 6d. per ton.
Also, the Westralian farmer has to pay £l2l for
a machine sold in Victoria at £lO5.
But the State that lias suffered most since
the Navigation Act came into force is Tas-
mania. The two Commissioners referred to
found, among other things, that direct ship-
ments could no longer be sent to Adelaide
or Fremantle, and that the timber trade with
Maoriland had been killed outright. The
Minister for Customs was recently told by
Henry Jones that it was costing him 103 s.
per ton to send jam to Westralia (28s. more
than the rate to British ports) as against
20s. to 30s. p.t. in 1920; while Seabrook,
M.H.R., supplied the information that 50
per cent, of shipping had quitted the Tas-
manian routes, and that the tourist traffic
had gone to pot. One reason why trippers
have ceased to go to Tasmania is that they
can never be sure about the date of the
return voyage. If they spend their holidays
somewhere on the continent they can get
back by motor-car should the railwayman
go on strike, but once they leave the main-
land for some seagirt fragment of Australia
they are entirely at the mercy of Walsh
(imp.) and his comrades. And holiday-
time in Tasmania is generally job-control-
time with the maritime unions. Thus early
in the season there have been ugly strikes
supplementary to the chronic trouble on the
Commonwealth line of steamers and the over-
time disturbance on the wharves, and it
won’t be Walsh’s fault if there are not
more. Summoned to the Federal Arbitration
Court at the instance of the Commonwealth
Steamship Owners’ Association, one of whose
ships had been held up because three mem-
bers of the crew demanded overtime pay,
to which, it was argued, they were not en-
titled under the award, the imported person
who once threatened to plunge Melbourne
in darkness declared that “we do not want
to be made tools for keeping their industry
going.” He added the threat that “if they
don’t pay the award we will tie up ship
after ship until they carry it out,” and the
award, it seems, is to be interpreted as the
union pleases, regardless of the Judge.
# * * •
It has been remarked during the overtime
strike that Japanese steamers were being
loaded and unloaded while ships belonging to
the Commonwealth Government and the inter-
state shipping companies, which pay three or
four times Japanese rates of wages, were under
the union ban. The Waterside Workers’
Federation has had no grievance on its own
account against either the Commonwealth
management or the inter-State companies,
but it has a cordial understanding with the
maritime unions; besides, as a Sydney Labor
paper engagingly explains, its relations with
“the Yamashita Kiser Kogyo Ivaisha Co.” are
excellent. Clearly the Government is not
justified in asking the community to make
immense sacrifices which are not appreci-
ated. It should dispose of the Common-
wealth steamers and repeal the coasting-trade
clauses of the Navigation Act. The parties
who have intolerably abused the monopoly
established by the clauses in question may
then apply for Protection under the Customs
tariff — -i.e., duties on foreign shipping pro-
portioned to cargo rates and fares. But such
duties should be conditional on guarantees
being furnished that Australia will get a fair
deal from employers and employed.
SLOGAN ET PRETEREA NIHIL.
“Dr. Maloney, M.P., who expects to leave for
Australia in the middle of December, when inter-
viewed, said: ‘What I have seen here emphasises
the necessity that our slogan of a White Australia
must remain unalterable if we are to hand over the
fifth continent as a heritage to the white race. In
the millions of blacks to the north, South Africa
has a similar danger to Australia’s. Mohammedanism
is making strides southwards.’ ” —Capetown cable-
gram shining forth in all the papers.
It would possibly be sinful and a cause of
misunderstanding to damn the slogan ; yet the
familiar cry about “keeping Australia white”
has become a weariness, through no demerit
of its own. What has happened is that too
many people orate about the slogan, and
cable about it, and loaf on it, and are helped
into Parliament by it, and paste their adver-
tisement on it, while too few do anything of
the least value for the cause it represents, or
contribute to it practical service worth the
price of a badly-neglected hair-cut. Some
stern advocates (by mouth) of White Aus-
tralia even combine their doctrine with a
dabbling in that Communistic pliilanthropy-
of-a-sort which alleges that all men are
brothers, except white employers, “intellec-
tuals” and “bourgeoisie,” and that colored
men and semi-Tartars from Eastern Europe
are extra-special brothers. The question is
really not one of keeping Australia white,
which implies the maintenance of an estab-
lished condition, a purely moral effort and a
stern but placid and eloquent and self-satis-
fied sitting down beside an accomplished fact.
The real matter at issue is the making of
Australia white, and that calls for patriot-
ism, industry and self-sacrifice, while offering
little immediate reward to the self-seeker,
political or industrial. It is even, to some
extent, a matter of recovering lost ground.
Two-thirds of the continent, on the far side
of a line drawn from north-east to south-
west, are very little whiter than they were
100 years ago. Some odd bits are less white
than they were 10 years ago. Too many
who have hurried to take a hand in the
Queensland sugar boom are Sicilians of
doubtful whiteness, and Maltese about whom
doubt has merged into certainty. Mean-
while time is drifting by, and our lease of
Empty Australia is 13G years shorter than
when it was first taken out.
A hope prevails that the pompous “Proto-
col for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes” is dead and gone so far as all
sections of the British Empire are concerned.
The new British Government decided that
it would not commit Great Britain to the
dubious document till it discovered whether
the Dominions were coming in, and it should
be a self-evident fact that they are not com-
ing in. The real point of interest, in the
Protocol has always been the clause inserted
at the instance of Japan, making, in its
original form, the exclusion of aliens not a
matter which concerns the excluding country
only, but one which the excluded people and
all other peoples may argue about. No man
was to be really master in. his own house,
but all houses were to be in an important
measure common property, save, of course,
for the usual reservations against criminals,
lunatics and diseased persons. Densely-
crowded races such as the Italians, Belgians
and Japanese stood to lose nothing by . the
proposed arrangements. Rare or unique
peoples like the Australians, with big man-
sions and many unoccupied rooms, stood to
lose their entire future, their hopes and
prospects, and their identity, and not even
get a decent new identity in exchange.
They would be absorbed not by one respect-
able race but by a hash of mixed intruders,
whose own identities were in the melting-
pot. The objectionable clause was toned
down, but it is by no means certain that
even in its diluted state it gives the owner
of the premises absolute power to choose his
own guests and lodgers, without would-be
guests and rejected lodgers taking him to
law over their claims. There is plenty of
reason to suspect that some of the powerful
and overcrowded States which strongly
approved of the “pacific settlement of inter-
national disputes” did so for wholly unpacific
reasons. So the Protocol really appears a
good thing to avoid. Its capacity for set-
tling old troubles is uncertain, and the sus-
picion that it is loaded with new ones is
considerable.
* *■ * *
But if the question of our right to hold the
spare half or two-thirds of the continent
doesn’t arise through the “pacific settlement
of international disputes” it will rise ac-
tively in some other way, unless something
is done more important than being the
proud possessor of a slogan. No one doubts
that Britain, except perhaps in one of its
worst Ramsay Macdonald moods, would
put up a willing fight with any nation that
wanted to argue the point in order to retain
Australia in the empire, just as it would
to retain the Soudan or Jamaica. But if
called upon to fight on behalf of White Aus-
tralia as it is note it might attach unpleasant
remarks, or even conditions, one being that
we should either produce the article or cease
making so much noise with the slogan. The
White ideal has practically no support in
England. That country believes in colored
people because they compose most of its
empire, and have been a source of pomp and
profit. It doesn’t understand anyone dread-
ing a huge influx of colored people, because
its own cold and crowded experience is that
niggers don’t want to come. The theory of
reserving Australia, as much as possible, for
English-speaking people has no friends in
Europe outside the British Isles, and none
in Asia, and none in South America, and
not too many in North America. Even
the British Isles are just mildly interested.
The prevailing opinion there is that the Com-
monwealth fails in its duty as a refuge for
desirable British population. And that
opinion is right. It is, however, difficult to
put many new arrivals in a place like Syd-
ney, because it is growing so fast without
them that homes are almost unprocurable.
It is absurd attempting to put them in coun-
try towns on any large scale, for the -home-
grown population can hardly hang on in the
desolate country towns owing to the removal
of their industries to the big cities. They
can’t be put in the empty places, for no one
makes these accessible. Enough railway is
built in any ordinary five years—sometimes
in one, year—to open up’ the Northern Terri-
tory. but it is cut up in scrappy lengths, and
distributed about old snots with names such
as Bull Plain. And of the work which the
white English-speaking arrival can do there
is little offering, for loans and imports fill
too much of the bill.
The summing-up is that White Australia,
having practically ceased to expand, has mis-
laid its punch. It hasn’t a friend outside
who counts for anything: and its friends
inside are not doing anything that counts
for much. In its present condition it might
be described as a voice and nothing more, or,
in debased Latin, Slogan et prcvtcrea nihil.
SOME PEACETIME MANOEUVRES.
Uncle Sam was very worried over the
Japanese amendment to the Peace Protocol,
lie saw the manoeuvre to have immigration
placed in the category of international poli-
tics in such a sinister light that he sus-
pended. interest in the Presidential election
long enough to raise a first-class war-scare
about it, and the reverberations of his un-
easiness affected the nerves of Europe to
such an extent that on September 21) flocks
of newsmen and newswomen in Berlin were
yelling: “Extra! America mobilises ! Calls
10,000,000 men to the colors for war with
Japan!” The sensation was a hoax, but it
was none the less an indication of the way
the international wind is blowing. Univer-
sal funk probably had as much to do with
the outbreak of war in 1914 as all the other
49 authentic reasons that have been sup-
plied by the various blue, white, green, red
and purple books; and it is the method of
modern journalism to transform abstract
ideas and complicated tendencies into con-
crete images.
* * » #
Where there is so much smoke it is, at any
rate, prudent to look for fire. Uncle Sam's
trepidation had its immediate origin in the
discovery of plans alleged to have been pre-
pared by the Japanese General Staff for a
trial of martial strength with the neighbor who
refuses to recognise the brown man’s peace-
time equality. “We shall declare war,” said this
document, “when all or most of the Ameri-
can Navy is, in the Atlantic. We hope to
have an ally in the Atlantic, whose fleet will
be engaged in manoeuvres near the Ameri-
can coast at the time. Then we strike in
three directions. A squadron of eight or
ten of our older cruisers and battleships will
dash into the Pacific end of the Panama
Canal and blow themselves up. A few small
warships will convoy and cover the dis-
embarkation of a large occupation army on
the Philippines. All our new and powerful
battleships and cruisers will take a position
a few miles east of the Hawaiian Islands,
but will not attempt to capture them because
of the minefields and land fortifications, arid
because of the order not to give battle in
the middle of the Pacific. When the Ameri-
can Navy finally approaches our new fleet
off Hawaii the Japanese Fleet will imme-
diately sail for Japanese home waters and
try to lure the American warships to follow
them. When the odds are strongly in our
favor we will give battle. It will not be
necessary to keep any part of the Japanese
Navy at home to protect Japan, because we
have ample minefields and land and air pro-
tection. After we capture the Philippines
and wreck the Panama Canal the American
Navy must come to Japan to attack us
sooner or later. We have much greater oil
reserves in the Pacific than America, and
■we managed to preserve 90 per cent, of our
naval oil and coal reserves in the earth-
quake, but that is not known.” This plan
may be apocryphal, but, in the absence of a
Singapore Base and other uncertain factors,
it sounds practical, especially with regard
to the Philippines, which are a collection
of rotten apples asking for a lap to fall into,
and which are also a stone’s throw or so
from Australia’s brand-new colony in New
Guinea. In any case, whether the document
is genuine or not does not matter. A recent
story about Lloyd George having decided
on the voyage back from America to hoist the
Protectionist standard as a means of get-
ting back to power may not be true, but it
was characteristic; and character is the
truth of a thing, while a fact may be an
illusory exception. Taken together with
Japan’s diplomatic offensive at Geneva, this
plan for a war offensive is characteristic.
* * *
In her diplomatic attack Japan attempted
to align the nations which had no immigration
problem against those that had. The voting
showed that Eastern Europe (crowded, ill-
nourished and misgoverned), Italy (over-
populated as never before in her history),
the Latin peoples generally and some of the
Latin-American peoples (with a grouch
against Uncle and a distinct predilection for
Japanese immigrants), and the black repub-
lics, all sided with Japan : and Britain, under
the temporary and vacillating Macdonald,
showed an inclination to look with favor on
Japan’s proposal, although a general election
and some hard thinking since have reminded
John Bull that he has Dominions with
Pacific interests, even if those inter-
ests are not all identical with his.
Uncle Sam’s reading of the signs is that a
large proportion of the European Powers, and
therefore of the League of Nations, sides
with Asia over the question of alien immigra-
tion. Uncle is large and almost self-
contained, but he does not like feeling friend-
less. And that is why he is sending his Fleet
round shortly on a tour of the Pacific.
WHAT IS EVIDENCE WORTH?
Tite. value of evidence as a means of ascer-
taining facts in courts of law and before
inquisitorial bodies must always remain in
doubt. It is the only means we have, con-
sequently it is Hobson’s choice; but the
process of its extraction can never be re-
duced to anything approaching an exact
science. And scientific truth itself stands
good only so long as it reacts to the required
tests. Evidence may react to all the tests
of examination and cross-examination and
yet be untrue.
Of recent years much attention has been
given to this problem of truth: how r best to
extract it from a witness in the fullest de-
gree and with the minimum of alloy. Such
questions as the language of the eye, the tone
of the voice, the facial changes^ —movements
of the mouth and nose —the motions of hands
and feet, the manner of lingual expression-
hesitancy, “bluff” ‘ aggressiveness, feigned
humility and so on —are indices of the per-
sonal factor in the witness, and have been
closely studied. Then the psychologist has
in these days something to say on the matter.
Emotional excitement, he tells us, is gen-
erated when thought is turned to that which
interests us. and the keen spectator has no
difficulty in detecting such excitement—it
may be a brightening of the eye, an alert-
ness in the face. The intelligence of a wit-
ness does not necessarily add to the relia-
bility of his report. In any happening las
interest will attach itself to its object bj


an instinctive process of selection. Thus it
is that in the witness-box, as every Judge
and magistrate knows, two or more witnesses
of the same occurrence will give partial
accounts of what happened, what they saw.
One may have seyn that winch other wit-
nesses with divergent interests may not con-
sciously have noticed. Another may have
merely glimpsed a fact, but will give that
impression as the fact itself.
A club of students at the Harvard Law School
carried out ail interesting experiment winch
threw quite a startling light on the accuracy
of human testimony. A court was consti-
tuted, with Judge, jury and counsel. Ihe
witnesses in the case were told to be present
at a certain time and place, and then and
there take mental note of wliat happened.
Two members of the club, after a careful
private rehearsal, appeared at the given spot
and enacted a quarrel in which a scuffle
occurred. One of the men, Chalmers, sued
another, McGuire, for slander in tlie use
of the words, “You hit me on the back,
a charge denied by the latter. This was the
action tried by the Students’ Court. Four
witnesses were examined at this mock trial,
held four weeks after the event, with the
result that their evidence was so conflicting
that the jury could come to no conclusion.
It seemed that as each witness received a
definite image his effort to impress it clearly
on his mind caused him to fail in observing
what followed: some saw facts not observed
by others, some imagined details that were
non-existent —the quarrel had been carried
out in exact conformity to the rehearsal. To
the imaginative witness the illusory details
were as vivid as were the facts to which
they were attached. All of them failed to
recall one particular fact. The witnesses
were above average mentality, knew’ they
would have to testify, and were instructed
to be mentally alert, and the facts of the
occurrence, all faithfully reproduced, had de-
signedly been made simple. There was no
inducement of any kind to cause a partial
or colored version to be given. It was as
nearly as possible a perfect test of observa-
tion.
But the fallibility of observation is not
the only difficulty in the way. The power
of suggestion, a very subtle intrusion by
skilful counsel, is another formidable obstacle
in the path. Some types of witness are like
putty to receive the slightest impress, and
the artful suggestion of the required answer
is seized upon at once. It is impossible to
w’holly eliminate this influence from trials
in court. The very form of the question—■
as for example, “Did you see?” or “Didn’t
you see?” —may affect, and by tests has been
shown to affect, the mind of the witness.
Then there are such instinctive qualities as
fear or caution, combativeness and so on
to be reckoned with. An over-anxious or
fearful witness, such as an ultra-conscien-
tious man, will hedge his evidence round with
such qualifying words as “So far as I know”
or “To the best of my belief” till it is so
watered down as to be practically negligible.
Again, personal bias or prejudice has to be
reckoned with; what to one man is a very
simple transgression will to another of sterner
moral mould take large proportions, and his
evidence be tinctured by his point of view.
As it has been put, “a man gazing at an
object through green glasses necessarily finds
it colored with green, and so eyes covered
by a mind clouded with strong religious,
social or political ideas record in the memory
necessarily colored account.”
Sex is another factor. AYomen are more
emotional and imaginative than men, and
their facts frequently spindle into imagina-
tion till it is impossible to determine the
dividing line. An experienced Judge once
remarked that he would not accept the un-
corroborated evidence of any woman. Their
highly-strung temperament rushes them into
exaggeration and surcharged phraseology,
with consequently distorted records. Sages
of psychology say that men are from 20
to 33 per cent, more accurate than women;
hut it is exceedingly difficult to put the dis-
crepancy into figures. Age is still another
factor: in youth memory is clear, the mind
alert; in age the perceptive organs arc less
acute, the faculties in process of decay.
Memory wanes with the passing of time;
the less appreciated details of a fact drop
out, till only the outstanding point on which
the high light of instinctive interest is cen-
tred remains, and in the end that too is
blurred.
Those who sit in the high places of the
Bench have deplored the waning sanction of
the oath. It is said that it no longer carries
with it a sense of profound responsibility
before a higher Bar. The psychologist has
brought liis tests even into this domain, and
has found that the oath still retains some
of its ancient force. The results have shown
that in unsworn testimony there is nearly
double the error of that in sworn, but even
in the latter there is a good 10 per cent, of
mis-statement.
After all, it wuxs not wholly a jest when
Pilate asked “What is truth?”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Multiplying Wild Dog and the
Procrastinating Wearne.
In 1893 the Western Division of N. S.
Wales carried over 16 million sheep, and
many busy townships testified to the value
of the industry. Then the wild dog came.
In eight years the sheep in the Wilcan-
nia, Milparinka and Wanaaring subdivi-
sions dropped from D] million to 271.630.
Before the advent of the new curse 17 West
1 larling holdings carried 1,226,000 sheep
between them. After the plague had smitten
them, some had gone out of existence, the
remainder tended a tattered remnant of
41,548. The evil became so great that at
length the Governments moved, and S. Aus-
tralia and N. S. Wales started to build dog-
proof boundary fences. From this beginning
8. Australia moved on to a measure which
provided for the creation of Boards to deal
co-operatively with the pest. Encouraged
by the great success of this plan, the pas-
toralists on the N. 8. Wales side began to
agitate for a similar measure in their State.
The Government was asked to lend the money
to enclose each group with a fence and main-
tain it, while the lessees would constitute
themselves a Vermin Board for their own
area and strike a rate on themselves to repay
the loan with interest in 21 years, the loan
to be made a charge upon the land. In
March, 1923, the Graziers lederal < ouncil
waited on AY. E. AVearne, Minister for
Lands, and got a promise from him that the
necessary amendments to the Wild JJog
struction Act would be introduced in the toJ-
lowing session. Being unsophisticated people
who harbor old-fashioned notions about the
good faith of Governments and the value of
Ministers’ promises, some of the lessees pro-
ceeded to restock their land. The amend-
ments did not come up that session, but
another promise—this time to the Pastoral-
ists’ Association of West Darling—was forth-
coming, and it was even more resolute and
determined than the previous one. It was to
the effect that the amendments Avould be
brought up, even if Parliament had to
wrench a whole day out of the Christmas
recess for the sacred cause. Touched by
the self-abnegation of this engagement, the
pastoralists waited patiently; but as Christ-
mas draws near without any propitious
omens they are getting anxious. They
wired the other day to the self-sacrificing
AVearne asking him to name an approxi-
mate date, but AVearne, concerned with the
needs of more importunate people nearer
Sydney, had forgottten all about the wild
dogs and the struggling squatters and selec-
tors of West Darling, and was quite unable
to name a date. Pressed for a more definite
pronouncement, he confessed that the Parlia-
mentary draftsmen were so busy with other
important measures that the matter could
not receive attention at all this session; and
one of his utterances in Parliament suggested
that it is not going to receive attention in
the future either. In reply to a question
put by M. A. Davidson in August last, he
stated tbat, according to a return, “in the
whole of the year 1919 the number of wild
dogs destroyed amounted to 896, and the
number destroyed in the district [ Wanaar-
ing] for the last six months was only 29,”
inferring by this dark pronouncement that
the menace had been courageously attacked
and suitably dealt with. The fact is that
the district referred to, being adjacent to the
Queensland fence, profits by that circum-
stance, and not by any governmental efforts,
while in AVilcannia and Menindie, which are
farther out, the pest continues to flourish like
the green bay-tree. If AY. E. AVearne, pri-
vate individual, found a dead man on his
doorstep he would be deeply stirred; if The
tragedy occurred in the next suburb he might
be mildly curious about it; if it happened a
thousand miles away it would not interest
him at all, unless its romantic features ex-
cited his fancy. The fault of the Western
Division is that it is far away, it hasn’t
many votes —and will have fewer next year
—and the railways that touch it drag its
produce off to other markets, instead of bring-
ing them to Sydney. Also, its slow mur-
dering is a dull and unspectacular affair.
Therefore to \A r . E. Wearne, Minister for
Lands for N. S. AVales, the building or re-
pairing of dog-proof fences out there is about
as intimate a matter as the proper mainten-
ance of the Great Wall of China. The
Sydney habit of treating outlying districts
as if they were foreign countries calls for a
drastic corrective, and the general Australian
method of leaving a national menace, to the
unco-ordinated enterprise or stark indiffei’-
ence of the various States bellows for modi-
fication. In his recent grand tour Priminis-
ter Bruce shed tears .over the decay and
disappearance of many once-prosperous min-
ing towns. He was wasting moisture on
the obvious and mourning for an event that
was as inevitable as human dissolution, while
at the very moment an absolutely prevent-
able and more far-reaching tragedy was being
enacted elsewhere. He might fittingly give
his attention to the national aspect of the
wild-dog question. It is quite clear, at any
rate, that George Fuller and his Minister
for Lands, in spite of all their protestations
of regard for country interests, are utterly
indifferent about anything to which there
are no votes attached.

Immunity for Madmen.
The sacredness of lunatics was a fetich of
ancient times, occasionally modified by the
use of the lash or the stake as a means of
exorcising the evil spirits that caused the
trouble. The men in wig and ermine who
interpret our caveman laws hover between
the two extremes, but no effort is made to
put the treatment of the mentally defective
in the law courts on a scientific basis. Cumu-
lative sentences totalling 11 years were im-
posed on a degenerate in Auckland (M.L.)
the other day for two cases of indecent
assault and one of stabbing a young woman
in a park at night. A flogging and 10 years
were inflicted on another moron for criminal
assault. In another case —not in this country
—a mother, her son and two daughters,
charged with shop-lifting, were declared to
be kleptomaniacs, and police records showed
that the disease went back four generations.
At Toowoomba (Q.) a woman, recently re-
leased from a mental hospital, cut the
throats of two of her children, and her tria'
is pending. The law, in dealing 'with mental
defectives, has evolved no better method than
to confine them after each offence for a year
or a month and then let them loose on society
with an edge put on their appetite for mur-
der, lust or looting. A slave was once killed
by a Roman emperor for dreaming of his
death. Psycho-analysis has, however, shown
us that we are not guilty of our dreams, but
that each one of us harbors an extra mind
which is a law unto itself. In .the normal
man the sub-conscious finds the liberty it
needs during slumber; and some authorities
consider that, besides being the certain knot
of peace, this is sleep’s most important func-
tion. In the case of the lunatic and the
adult creature with the undeveloped brain of
a child, the sub-conscious tyrant is on his
throne during waking hours as well. The
mentally deficient are thus as irresponsible
in their waking life as flic normal person
in his dreams. A set of formula?, involving
exhaustive tests of mental and nervous re-
actions, was devised some years ago by two
Victorian alienists and applied to the casts
of skulls of murderers who had been executed
in Melbourne Gaol. In nearly every case
the measurements showed these full-grown
criminals to have the brain capacity of little
children. In the light of modern knowledge
it is as irrational to prescribe the lash to
prevent congenital idiots repeating their
offences as it was to stretch an epileptic on
the rack in order to drive out tile demons
that possessed him. And to allow a creature
with the cranial capacity of a baby and the
propensities of a wild beast to resume, after
a term of enforced celibacy in prison, his
place in society, with all his sexual attri-
butes unimpaired, is criminal stupidity.

Filins and Crimes.
Dear Bulletin, —The short way to prevent
the debate about Yankee moving pictures be-
coming eternal is to end it, and a sure way
to end it is to prohibit the importation of
these pictures altogether. If there is discus-
sion after that I presume it will be not about
films but about the absence of films—a dif-
ferent subject altogether. Reasons in plenty
can be advanced in favor of my plan. The
Yankees prohibit the incoming of liquor and
Japanese, so they furnish precedent, all
ready made, both for exclusion and for dis-
crimination in the process thereof. They
also come very close, to the exclusion of Aus-
tralians, for the hundred or two who may
enter per annum are hardly x\’ortli mention-
ing. It is to be hoped that they will con-
tinue doing these things and perform others
like them, for the mild and long-suffering
inhabitant hereabouts requires tons of pro-
vocation before he will do even an ordinary
act of self-defence. The list of arguments
for exclusion is pretty long. Pictures are
among the superfluities of life, in which
respect they somewhat resemble pony-racing.
The. motor-car was also regarded as some-
thing of a superfluity once, but it does a
great deal of work which requires to be done
by some agency, and the film doesn’t, nor do
the ponies. The moving picture has created
the demand for itself, the same as ponies,
and the same as drink if one learns to drink,
and drugs if one learns to drug. Too many
artificial demands tend to make life squalid,
for something must be saved off necessaries
to pay for shabby luxuries. Stories are told
of working families in which as much as £1
per week, to say nothing of a great deal of
time, is absorbed in paying for picture
shrieks, and as the shrieks don't increase the
earning capacity of the household it lives
in more discomfort and is more ready to be-
lieve the scheming nuisance, generally im-
ported like the film, who preaches that the
only hope of betterment lies in lawlessness
and promiscuous shooting. Lessons in law-
lessness and promiscuous shooting are sup-
plied by the film. It really has a limited
range despite its apparent variety, and not
a high range. Any active printed shocker
can be adapted to the picture show if suffi-
cient new shocks are put in, but such works
as “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “As You
Like It” or “Much Ado About Nothing”
don’t fit in well unless altered and adapted
by the talented author of “The Ghoul at the
Window.” The picture craze creates no
demand for a new Siiakspeare or Aris-
tophanes or even a new Pinero. The case is
not helped by the fact that the almost ex-
clusive source of picture supply is a morbid
republic where divorce and the more violent
sort of crime have reached the top so far as
white communities are concerned. The
United States include one State in which
divorces are more numerous than marriages;
it possesses a city where within the last 10
years 350 murderers confessed their crimes
and only one was executed —probably by
oversight. Loeb and Leopold, the highly-
educated millionaire boy murderers, presum-
ably made 352. And the morbid republic
owns “great dailies” which averaged a page
apiece of Loeb and Leopold during the 33
days of the trial—a trial that was
kept going purely for show purposes,
as the two criminals, one of whom
could “recite the Lord’s Prayer in 15
languages,” merrily owned up before the
curtain rose, and while the orchestra was
just tuning up. When Australia’s popular
entertainments are concocted in such an
atmosphere, and out of such materials, and
by people who see little or nothing wrong
with either the atmosphere or the materials,
they are not likely to have an uplifting effect.
In fact, they are likely to have a rotten
effect. Apart from other considerations, it
is not desirable that young Australia should
grow up wflth the impression that Uncle
Sam’s morbid republic is the whole globe,
and that all the inhabitants of this un-
healthy globe are supermen and super-heated
w’omen, and that life is one kaleidoscopic
race of drunken events, tearing across Time
and Space at 450 miles an hour. And it isn’t
desirable to send to Uncle’s place so absurdly
large amounts of our ready money in pay-
ment for cither sordid crime and sin and dis-
sipation records, or crazy joke records, or
“tin Lizzies” or any other of its products.
Judged by the goings-on of its jewelled
youth, it has more money than is good for
its soul already—assuming it to have a soul.
Rut it is desirable that Australia should get
fixed in its mind that it has a country and
an identity and a standing of its own, and
has the same right as the next individual to
exclude persons and goods without explana-
tion, and to deport aliens who make it tired
without giving them any right of appeal. If
by great good fortune the Yankee film is
barred out, some diplomatic party will doubt-
less come snooping furiously round to demand
a reason. The simplest reply would be that
this country proposes to begin to prohibit
things, and is practising in a small way to
get its hand in.—Yours, etc., Solomon Mala-
PROP.

Open Lands.
The annual report of the N. S. Wales Lands
Department shows that of a total area of
198 million acres 176 millions are occupied ;
110 millions are under lease or license, and
but 65 millions are freehold or perpetual
lease. So the State has 22 million acres as
yet untouched, including a great deal of
country—rough country, no doubt—compara-
tively close to Sydney; and if this were
made easy to secure it might do much to lessen
the exploitation of the public by those who
make subdivisions of barren acres to satisfy
the demand for a “little piece of earth that
a man can call his own.” At distances of
50 and 60 miles from the city blocks of virgin
bush are being sold on terms at prices per
foot which are beyond all speculative or use
value; and side by side with these are areas
of forsrotten public land which might be
profitably offered to the week-end home-
seeker at one-tenth of the price asked by
the private vendor. With the price fixed at
two or three pounds per acre, small blocks
could be readily sold with conditions of
building and occupation attached; and the
effect would be not only to provide a fair
amount of revenue and create a public
demand, but to squelch a form of land specu-
lation which is every way unwholesome. Much
of the land referred to is doubtless avail-
able even now if the public knew ay he re to
look for it; but the Lands Office gives no
assistance, makes no advertisement, and often
even seems to resent any attempt to dis-
cover its whereabouts. Perhaps the best
people to handle the matter, would really be
the Railway Commissioners ; for assuredly the
opening up of such blocks would add con-
siderably to their week-end and other traffic.
Further, it would give to town dwellers just
that whiff of bush life which is calculated to
counteract the eternal narrowing influence
of the pavements and the picture shows. A
family with five acres in the nearer country
aud a small home there can never be so blind
to the meaning of Australia as one whose
horizons are limited by a racecourse and a
railway station.

The Golden Gummidge State.
Dear Bulletin, —As the morning paper
puts it, “Disabilities suffered by Westralia as
a consequence of Federation which have not
been suffered by other States will shortly be
investigated by the Royal Commission
appointed for the purpose.” In other words,
ex-Minister Higgs and colleagues are loading
their baggage-camel for the West, where a
lone, lorn State —a Golden Gummidge among
States —never ceases to repine that it has
been the one special victim of the Federal
system, and to cry aloud for recompense and
consideration. On the face of things Tas-
mania is the special sufferer. Under Federal
control of navigation, and the Federal Navi-
gation Act, and the Federal incapacity to
cbpe with ; even a strike of its own stewards,
and its general inability to do anything save
lay up its ships, the one State which depends
entirely on the sea for communication with
the outer globe has had a rotten time. That
and the embarrassment of its jam industry
by the increase in the cost of sugar, under
the Federal guarantee of a high price for
the Queensland crop are the most conspicu-
ous changes which union brought to the
Speck. The only way in which Westralia’s
case appears to differ from the common lot
is that it got a railway costing £7,300,000
at the general charge, so that its isolation
was alleviated while that of Tasmania grew
worse. One way by which a sort of estimate
of the relative prosperity of States can be
arrived at is by measuring their respective
contributions per head under the five uniform
direct taxes which the Commonwealth col-
lects. Victoria has to be left out of this
estimate, because “Central Office,” which is
in Melbourne pending its removal to Can-
berra, collects odds and ends which don’t be-
long to the State, though they appear there;
but as regards the other members of the
party the method looks fair enough. The
fact that a perfectly new batch of figures has
brought the tidings un to 1923, and the fact
that Westralia’s alleged sufferings are again
on the mat, amounts almost to a Heaven-sent
coincidence: —
Contributions per Head to Five Federal Taxes
(1922-23).
S. Australia.. £2 15 3 j Tasmania .. £1 13 7
N. S. Wales .. 2 14 10! Average (5
Westralia . . 2 010 | States) ..294
Queensland .. 118 0 |
The discrepancies which appear can be ex-
plained by one or more of four causes. (There
may be various other causes, but the four
stand out conspicuously as assured starters
in the event.) One is lack of visible natural
resources, and in this respect the high posi-
tion consistently occupied by S. Australia, the
most ill-provided by Providence of the whole
group, is a marvel. Another explanation
might be labelled “Disadvantages arising
through Federation,” and this may greatly
help to account for Tasmania’s troubles. Two
other feasible suggestions are that backward-
ness is due to bad State administration, and
to a loafing and Bolshevik frame of mind
among employees, combined with the incom-
petence of employers—in short, to third-rate-
ness all round. As an illustration, the new
“Official Year Book” says (page 831) that
the Westi’alian factory-worker collects the
highest wage in the Commonwealth (£9 Bs.
per annum above the Commonwealth aver-
age; it adds (page 837) that he gives
the very poorest return, the value of the
work he does bejng £3B per annum below the
average. That is “added value.” The gross
output of the Westralian factory toiler (page
837) is also the poorest of all, being £199
per annum below that of the Commonwealth
in general. No small amount of go-slow and
incapacity must exist to explain these dis-
crepancies. Wherefore it is suggested:—
(1) That considering how large the income is
which Westralia supplies to the Commonwealth while
doing so little work to earn the means of payment,
there can’t be much wrong with the State itself.
(2) That considering how small that same income
is compared with that furnished by at least one
State possessing not half Westralia’s natural oppor-
tunities, the really urgent subject of investigation
should be the Commonwealth’s grievances against
Westralia, particularly in the matter of its failure
to carry its fair share of the load.
The Gummidge of fiction was soured by age
and poverty, which made the case excusable.
The Gummidge of the Golden West appears
to be embittered by youth and riches, and
has never got over being presented with a
railway.—Yours, etc.. Henry llorsecollar.

The Luck of Being King.
S. Talbot Smith holds a Royal parade:—
“Chance —or Providence, if you please —has so had
it that to the throne of Britain an eldest child singu-
larly seldom succeeds.” That was the alliterative
summing up of a stockbreeder with a historical eye
in Tub Bulletin lately; and he left it there.' Driv-
ing the research down the fairway of history, it
will be found that he was almost startlingly correct.
It seems a fair thing to begin four centuries back,
when princes first had a fair chance, the habit of
butchering them in infancy having lately died out,
nor were they expected any longer to lead the army
into battle. Henry Vll.’s eldest son died young,
married but childless. Henry VIII.’s two eldest were
both daughters. Edward VI. was unmarried, Mary
childless; Elizabeth was unmarried, and a Scotch
cousin had to be sent for. James saw his elder son die as
a youth. Charles— well, the case is arguable;
Charles 11. certainly did not succeed him in the
ordinary course, though 11 years later he arrived
on the throne. It is one of the ironies of history
•that the only person legally qualified to succeed the
Merry Monarch was a mere brother. James 11. was

CHRISTMAS TIME IN SYDNEY.
This month is indeed a season to enjoy the plentiful delights of the “Queen City
of the South”—and likewise the complete and luxurious comfort of “The Australia.”
At Christmas, too, there will be special seasonable functions in the Ballroom.
COMFORT AND SERVICE AT MODERATE RATES.

Light Luncheon in the Winter Garden, from 2/6.

“THE AUSTRALIA,” The Hotel of the Commonwealth, Sydney.
not popular, but let us speak of him with respect;
he was the only King of England who ever forfeited
his throne for the sake of his religicn He left an-
other dubious case: Parliament barred his eldest son
but let his eldest, child share the throne —mainly as
"ife of her cousin from Holland. William and Mari
were childless, Anne lost all her children, and an-
other cousin—from Hanover this time —had to be
sent for.
Here ends interference from politics or religion,
and the Curse, or whatever it is,, has to depend on
natural causes.
Twice in a century the favorite did get home, so
to speak, George I. being succeeded by George 11.
—who, however, lost his eldest son in early man-
hood, reputedly the first martyr of the cricketfield—-
and George 111. by George IV. By further irony
his only legally-qualified daughter and grandchild
died young, and his brother William's legal wife
was childless. Victoria, whose very existence was
due to a determined effort of the other sons of George
111. to find legal heirs lest an utterly unpopular
brother' should follow, was the only child of one of
these late marriages, and her father died soon after
her birth. Her eldest child was a girl, who became
Empress of Germany and mother of the recent
Kaiser, instead of Queen of England. King Edward
saw his elder son die as a young man about to
marry; and King George—whose chance when he
first visited Australia as a jolly midshipman had
seemed not worth considering—succeeded when the
time came, though second son of the second child
of the only daughter of a third son.
Thus it is not surprising that historians look
thoughtful over the prospect of the present Prince
of Wales reaching the throne, altogether apart from
the gossips who suggest that he has no wish to do
so. In four centuries the eldest son has duly suc-
ceeded his father only four times, the eldest child
only twice. “Singularly seldom” was a mild way
of putting it.

“The Trade” ill Westralia.
The licensing legislation of Westralia is
getting into an appalling muddle. In 1921
there was a local-option poll (the first under
the 1911 Act) at which 37,710 electors voted
for continuance, 31,302 for no-license, 6940
for reduction and 2165 for increase. No-
license failed everywhere of the necessary
three-fifths majority, but reduction was car-
ried in ten districts by a simple majority-
all that was required on this issue. , At the
same time 28 districts voted for, and 14
against, new licenses being held by the State,
while 23 districts wanted State management
and 19 said they wouldn’t have it. These
latter declarations were ignored by the Mit-
chell Government. That Government, how-
ever, appointed a Board to delicense hotels
in the reduction districts, and the Board
seized the opportunity to wipe out super-
fluous pubs in places that had voted continu-
ance, some of which, as generally happens
in the freakish business of local option, were
far more in need of its attentions. It also
granted £14,814 to 39 dispossessed landlords
and licensees, although financial recompense
was never contemplated in the 1911 Act—the
late ,T. L. Nanson, author of that measure,
maintained that ten years’ immunity from
local-option was enough for any man.
Scrapping the Nanson Act altogether, the
Mitchell Government legislated for a Pro-
hibition referendum, to be held next year.
It restricted the issues to no-license and
continuance, and stipulated that no license,
to be effective, must poll a three-fiftlis majo-
rity of votes and at least 30 p.c. of the elec-
tors. Now the Collier Government proposes to
let a bare majority suffice, voting to be com-
pulsory. In that case townships like Marble
Bar. Broome and Wyndliam, distant respec-
tively 1239, 1374 and 2177 miles from Perth,
may be deprived of their hotels—necessities
of existence in those parts, for nowhere else
can the traveller or the unmarried resident get
comfortable accommodation —by the caprice
of a few people in a Perth suburb. In a hot
country like the West, where 360.000 people
are spread over 975,920 square miles of terri-
tory with 4250 miles of unpatrollable coast-
line, Prohibition is wildly impracticable.
What the State needs is another 10 years’
respite from disturbing polls and a strength-
ened Licenses Board to continue the work of
reduction in over-pubbed towns, to grant new
licenses where the circumstances warrant
them (particularly to men with modern ideas
about public-houses) and to encourage those
engaged in producing light wines—an indus-
try with fine possibilities if it is safeguarded
from fanatics.

National Thinking.
The declaration of an English Labor leader
that “the workers must learn to think inter-
nationally,” and that “it is necessary to re-
gard the world as one country,” has a smooth-
sounding appeal, but is based upon a false
view of nationality. The greatest hardships
inflicted on human beings have been due to
just such a doctrine. The idea that a dozen
nationalities could be forced to a uniform
pattern of thinking, and so work together in
unity, was the cause of the canker at the
heart of the Austrian Empire. The idea
that two nationalities could live comfortably
under the will of the larger was the cause
of 700 years of strife between England and
Ireland. To understand nationality is to
appreciate the problems of the world; to
dismiss it is to invite trouble. Labor men,
with a sincere desire to extract half a
crown a day more from the employers and
a. vague idea of abolishing the employer in
order to get all he now holds, are apt to
think that the half-crown is the dominant
idea of all the unionists banded to-
gether to obtain it. They fancy that,
Turk or German or .Japanese or Bri-
tish. it is all much the same; one half-crown
to-day and another perhaps the week after
next will keep them hoping and agitating
together. It is a gruesome jest. A thousand
—or ten thousand—years of sentiment and
prejudice are behind a man; he is heir to
all the sentiments and prejudices of a long
line of ancestors. These sentiments and
prejudices are the crystallisation of whole
masses of thought over long periods of years
—thought which, though now grown vague,
was once much more definitely active than
the desire for half a crown. A nation is. in
fact, an association of men who have learned
through ages to think alike. International un-
derstandings on certain points are always
possible; and it is even to be hoped that the
points may so increase in the course of the
years that a complete understanding may at
last be arrived at. Still there is nothing
more sure than that in a Labor-governed
United States of Europe the British w'orking-
man would be the first to break into rebel-
lion. Nationality is playing its part in the
evolution of the race. As a physical species
man’s type was determined long ago by the
the snobs.
"Austialian Trade Unionism proposes to substitute May 1, the International festival of Anarchy,
for the Australian-born Eight-Hour Day."
INTERNATIONALIST: "Who’s your shabby-looking friend?”
UNION OFFICIAL: Oh, he’s a poor boob ivho believes in eight hours' work a day.
Quite obsolete, thank God!”
working of natural law; but the mental
species is not yet determined, and the law
ot the survival of the fittest is working as
truly in ideas as it once worked in physical
form. So the world must rise or fall a
nation at a time; and it is neither wise to
try to pull up the Russian Communist nor
to stand the chance of falling down with the
Spanish anarchist.

Russia and the Single-tax.
Percy R. Meggy in his defence:—
“Sol. Malaprop” (B. 20/11/24) would have your
readers believe that the single-tax is enforced m
Russia, that it has egregiously failed, and that it
would meet with a similar fate if tried in Australia.
The very facts which he adduces in proof show that,
whatever else Russia may be, she is certainly not
single-tax, more than half the revenue, according to
his own admission, being raised from taxes other
than those on land. To describe Russia as under
the single-tax is decidedly mal-apropos. It is,
therefore, a perfect justification of your correspon-
dent’s nom de plume. How could anyone expect
land nationalisation in Russia to be a success, con-
sidering the way in which it was carried out?’ This
correspondent tells us, with a naive simplicity one
cannot but admire, that “agricultural rents had to
be collected in, kind, and they had to be heavy to
make up for losses in other directions; hence agri-
culture languished.” C)f course it did. It was
the very way to make it languish;—and everything
else, too. The appalling famine in Russia a year
or two after the revolution was the direct result of
the Soviet method of exacting almost the whole of
their product from the peasant farmers, who very
naturally refused to cultivate the land any. longer,
and fled to the cities in shoals, whitening the way-,
side with their bones. A recent telegram (August 6)
shows that the Soviet exactions still prevail, with
the same result. “Masses of starving peasants are
flying from Tzaritzine-and Samara,” says the corres-
pondent. “They say it is no longer ■ possible to
support the ruthless requisitions of their crops in
order to enable the Moscow Government to secure
ready cash by selling exports.'’
The policy advocated by Henry George and the
method pursued by the Soviet are as wide asunder as
the Poles. The Soviet confiscated the land, turned
the owners out of their homes, and handed the land
to the peasants, leaving the owners to starve. The
Georgian or single-tax policy, on the other hand, is
to leave the so-called owners in full possession of
their land, allowing them to cultivate it to the
fullest extent, and to retain the whole of the produce,
provided they' hand over the economic rent to the
State. The economic rent is not the income, as
“Malaprop” seems to think, but only a return to
the State of the annual unimproved value of the
land for the privilege of using it and making an
income therefrom, free from all other taxes. What
the owners cannot use and ,do not wish to retain they
can dispose of in any way they please. It is not the
farmer but the holder of valuable city lots who
would be called upon to band over to the State
the bulk of the economic, rent.
“Malaprop” further justifies his name by telling
os in the same breath that Russia made “a sincere
attempt at Freetrade,” and that, “in Soviet Russia
the Government is the sole importer.” How trade
can be free when the people are prohibited from
indulging in it he does not condescend to explain, but
that is “Mala prop” all over! As'a matter of fact,
the single-tax is the very reverse of everything
associated with the name of Soviet. The disciples
of Henry Geo roe stand, not for the confiscation of
land, as in Russia, but for the appropriation of land
values, which, having been created solely by the
people as a whole, should be appropriated on their
behalf by the State, and not, by private individuals
who did nothing to create them. We also stand, not
for Government interference with foreign or any
other trade, but for the right of everyone to buy
where he will and to sell where he will, without any
dictation from Government, enforced by means of a
tax. Finally, we stand for the freedom of the person,
whereas the Soviet stands for tile massacre, imprison-
ment or exile of all those who offend it in any way.

The decisions at the last inter-State Labor
Conference included the usual manifestation
of childlike faith in the omnipotence of the
capitalistic employer, that good fairy whose
simple duty it is to produce great wealth out
of nothing at any hour of the day or night.
It was resolved that the maximum week’s
work should be 44 hours, and the. minimum
week’s leisure 124 hours, and that the
loss of at least one-twelfth of the output
in 48-hour industries should be made up'and
compensated for like this
That the present unsatisfactory manner of comput-
ing the minimum .wage of the worker be discontinued,
as the capacity of the worker’s stomach has no rela-
tion to the value created by the productive effort
of the worker. It is therefore desirable that the
basic wage be added to, or increased by, 25 per cent,
before being set down as the minimum wage.
That, quite apart from the reduced hours and
output, would make somthing like a 25 per
cent, addition to three items in “secondary”
industries—wages paid directly in the fac-
tory, and fuel and raw materials, which are
the result of wages paid before these articles
come to the factory. The latest calculations
are to the effect that wages, raw materials
and the minor item of fuel absorb, on an all-
An.stralian average, £Bl 10s. out of every
£lOO of value produced ; and even if produc-
tion kept up despite the 44 hours, a much
smaller increase than that proposed would
absorb the balance and close factories unani-
mously. Theodore, the outstanding figure of
the conference, is, in his capacity as Premier
of Queensland, an immense employer of labor,
and it was a pity he didn’t give some hint,
out of his vast experience, as to how the
community can get 10 pints out of a gallon
measure.
Cables report a split in the ranks of the
Soviet administration. The question at
issue is whether the Central Committee shall
continue to exercise its . supreme power
through the machinery of the Cheka, or whe-
ther there shall be a return to a form of
government in which the governed will have
at least some shadow of control. Trotsky
is with the “moderates,” and opposing him
stands Dserzhinsky, the most sinister figure
in Bolshevism. Lenin dead, to whom
Dserzhinsky bent in devoted allegiance,
Trotsky stands naked before the dreaded
executioner. At his will Trotsky remains
a nominal ruler, or passes into the. dungeon
of Cheka, and on to that same death to
which his regime has sent so many thousand
men, women and children. The position
irresistibly recalls, the Trench Revolution.
We see the elegant, blue-coated Robespierre
as he leaves the Convention after establish-
ing the new religion of “reason,” bearing a
bouquet of flowers and wheat-ears, and wo
see him as he goes to the death to which
his own Terror has sent so many pitiful
creatures. In his hours of “rest” does such
a picture fill the thoughts of Trotsky?
♦
“Machete”: Randolph Bedford, as usual,
protests too much in his championship of the
American copyright law (B. 13/11/’24).
There is no doubt that the Yankee'Act is a
first-rate bit of legislation, and has done a
lot of good to the bank accounts of American
writers. But when Bedford asserts that
“the American writer of fiction does not
undersell the Australian novelists with bad
work as the British writer does.” he trips
over, his own prejudices and spoils his case
with his own pen. If America did not pro-
duce “The Sheik” it has given us tons of
literary awfulness; the tables and shelves of
every Australian bookseller are crammed with
it. Much the same may be said of the
American tripe monthlies which flood our
markets, and have for years prevented a
genuine Australian magazine getting a foot-
hold, no matter how powerful the backing.
We do want an Australian copyright law.
and have wanted it badly this many a year: a
law to apply, as the American Act does, to
all publications coming from outside. But
its arrival will not be speeded up by hysteri-
cal remarks on the respective merits of being
“pro-Australian” as opposed to “anti-Ajperi-
ean” and “pro-British.” Like the casting off
of the hyperbolical chains once dear to the
orator of the soap-box, those cliches are
nowadays as dead as mutton.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Cablegrams from Europe say that “it is
very unlikely that the League of Nations
will intervene in the Egyptian crisis, the
bulk of opinion regarding the affair as en-
tirely domestic.” Probably the bulk is right,
but it would very likely hold the same
opinion even if it knew it was wrong. The
League is very shy of interference when one
of the parties is large and angry and doesn’t
like to be interfered with. It has lxad some
successes, however, in stopping wars when
neither party wanted to fight, and was ach-
ing for an excuse to get out with dignity.
Knowing the ropes, Peacock, as soon as lie
took office as Treasurer under Allan, said it
was easier to talk about erecting a bridge
over the Yarra at Spencer-street than to
find the money. He warned those clamoring
for the structure that it was a £570,000
proposition, and that the State could not
stand the whole racket. And then, without
lpoking into details, Premier Allan must go
aiid tell a crowd at a Caledonian feast that
he would instruct Goudie to get on with the
job. Municipalities which had been asked
to shell out £410,000 towards the cost there-
upon chuckled. It is certainly not a
bill for the Backblocks to pay. Of the
£570,000 about £160,000 Avill be spent on
streets to make the bridge of real use in
relieving traffic (congestion, and another
£250.000 will have to be given to the Harbor
Trust to enable it to construct wharves in
place of the berthage of which it will be
deprived from Spencer-street to Queen’s
Bridge.
Premier Lyons’s proposed method of put-
ting the Speck’s Leg. Council on its defence
in regard to its power to amend money mea-
sures is something quite new in constitu-
tional scrimmages. At least this paper
doesn’t at the moment recall a precedent
in Australia, though the somewhat analogous
plan of “appointing new peers” has been
often practised or threatened by Govern-
ments up against difficulties with Upper
Houses. Lyons’s scheme of ignoring an elec-
tive blit obstructive Upper House altogether
by taking the Assembly’s money bills direct
to the Governor for his assent (first sug-
gested in Tas. by ex-Speaker Woods), is so
revolutionary as to be pretty sure of con-
demnation by the Imperial authorities as
unconstitutional, but pending that condem-
nation there must be a bitter controversy in
which the whole bi-cameral system, as ap-
plied in Australia, will get a much-needed
airing. This is probably Lyons’s object.
Westralia is not to have State sweeps after
all, the Leg. Council having thrown out the
Labor Government’s Lotteries Bill. Of
course, there is nothing to prevent the
Government suspending the present anti-
lotteries law and going ahead with a
committee-run gamble, like the Queensland
Golden Brisket, but such a proceeding would
offend more people than it would please.
And a man in Collier’s position has got to
be sensitive to public opinion. Like Gunn
in South Aus,. he wouldn’t be where he is
but for the quarrels and blunders of the
other side. *
While revising the Labor Ministry’s esti-
mates Yic.’s new Government was informed
that the revenue for November was £57.447
behind the receipts for the same month last
year, but that the takings for the five months
.since July 1 were £287,000 to the good. Rail-
ways and fees were mainly responsible for
the decrease in November, and as there is
every prospect of a bumper harvest Minis-
ters did not think their luck was out. The
Coalition will not try to extract as much
additional income-tax as Prendergast pro-
posed, but it will ask for some more, and
will revise the betting-tax so as to levy on
wagers in proportion' to the amounts staked
by punters rather than on the number of
transactions. At present there is a stamp
duty of from 6d. to a penny on each betting
ticket, according to the place (stand, hill,
metropolitan or country course) where the
bet is made.
For the first time the Commonwealth
Statistician has had a shot at estimating
the number of Government employees in Aus-
tralia. The total he gives is 202,476 —69,546
in N. S. Wales, 42,603 in Vic., 32,107 in
Queensland, 16,190 in South Aus., 11,449 in
Westralia, 4262 in the Speck and 26,319 in
(lie Commonwealth and its territories. But
the figures are up to two years old; also,
temporary officers are not included, and the
legions of manual laborers employed on
public works are omitted altogether. Accord-
ing to the Public Service Commissioners there
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
AUSTRALIAN WORKER ( bitterly) : “You call me a scab for sticking to my job! What
about you sticking to that cheap, flea-bitten foreigner?”

and I thrive on trouble.”
were so many “temporary” and “exempted”
officers in the Commonwealth departments
in 1923 that the grand total of the service
on June 30 was 44,889, instead of the Statis-
tician’s 26,319: the 1924 aggregate is not
given. At the moment there are probably
300,000 adult citizens drawing Government
pay, and the 300,000, with their relatives,
etc., represent a voting strength of 1.000,000;
yet the number of electors on the Senate
roll at the last Federal election was under
3,000,000, and only 1,728,246 voted. Such
is the trouble in which job-multiplying poli-
ticians have involved a careless people, and
the worst is to come.
Sydney is to enjoy another three years
of Labor government, or what goes by that
name. At the city elections on Monday
the Municipal Labor party, with a smaller
aggregate vote than the non-Labor total,
carried 15 of the 20 seats. It owes it's vic-
tory to the stupidity of its opponents in
quarrelling among themselves and to the fat-
licaded folly of the Fuller Government in not
providing for preferential voting; in the
absence of such a measure three Labor alder-,
men were elected by minorities, and their
seats made all the difference. Among the
casualties were Gaud Mayor Gilpin ; Brarn-
ston, of ballot-box notoriety; and Walker,
whose transactions are being probed by a
Royal Commission and who, it has been
stated in evidence, is known at the Town
Hall as “Bugwhiskers.” The wit of Syd-
ney’s civic bosses is as refined as their ad-
ministration.
A very doubtful feature of the N.S.W.
motor-vehicles taxing scheme is the exemp-
tion of Government vehicles. The better
way would be to abolish all such exemptions,
and make all Government enterprises pay
national and local taxes. This method would
keep the accounts square, and make the com-
parison between public and private enter-
prise an honest one. If the State makes a
sham profit by exemption from taxation, then
it may be misled into extending the business
and making more exemptions till it owns
everything and exempts everything. Soviet
Russia took over everything in its early
days, even the sole right of retail trading,
and not being able to tax itself or to make
a profit it was reduced to printing paper
money and stealing wheat.
The present situation is too absurd for
words. On board the Moreton Bay the 62
well-paid and not-much-worked stewards re-
fused duty at sea —in other words, they
broke into mutiny. The Commonwealth
management walks warily, like a ghost step-
ping on eggs, lest it should lose votes at next
election. It didn’t prosecute the mutineers
or turn them loose with bad discharges. It
sent them adrift with good characters so that
other people might employ them. In return
for this mildness the union showed no grati-
tude at all. In fact, it demanded preference
for mutineers, and when they were refused
engagement its attitude was “Why this
brutal malice? Look at our splendid testi-
monials ! You signed them yourself!” Then
it proceeded to hold up the Commonwealth
line for doing it a kindness.
It is always safe to predict nowadays that
a new Labor Government will (1) raise
the taxes and (2) add to the number of
Ministers, and the S.A. Gunn Government,
now in its eighth hectic month, is doing both.
During the present century South Aus. has
never had more than half a dozen Minis-
ters, four in the Assembly and two in the
Council, and when Dismal Dick Butler was
Premier in 1905 there were only four. But
Gunn asserts that he can’t get along with-
out six Assembly Ministers, and one of his
new lieutenants is to draw £1250 p.a., like
the others. The eighth Minister will pre-
sumably be paid by his colleagues—until the
obligation can. be transferred to the tax-
payer. So the burden of over-government
goes on growing.
„ The fate of Page’s Dairy Produce Export
Control, Act, passed last session, will be
decided next week by a poll of cow-cockies;
ballot-papers are returnable on the 10th.
There is strong opposition to the doctor’s
proposals, mainly in Queensland, and chiefly
on the ground that the Act doesn’t apply to
local sales (as a matter of fact, it can’t), and
that there will be too many selling agents
on the Board of Control; but on the other
side it is claimed that a similar scheme now
operating in Maoriland has in a single year
saved the M.L. farmers £200,000 through re-
duced insurance, and cargo rates. Neither
set of disputants has pointed out that this
control business wouldn’t be necessary if
the Australian market were developed to the
highest point. And it can only be so de-
veloped as the IJ.S.A. has developed its own
home market —by scientific Protection.
G. H. Knibbs, Director of the Bureau
of Science and Industry, has been ex-
plaining . how his efforts to do some-
thing big and practical have been
wrecked on the rock of official somnolence.
What he wants is a grant for research after
a new liquid fuel —not some temporary
deposit which is found, but something that
can be made, so that it will be a steady job
and a permanent supply. He can’t get - any-
thing, of course, though private persons
offered to subsidise the grant on a £ for £
basis. His view is that the world’s supplies
of oil may finish in 20 years; that long
before then the producing countries are
likely to prohibit export; and that, even if
Australia finds oil, that is only postponing
the evil day. In other words, just when
Australia gets to own a million motor-cars
the lot may have to be left by the road-
side while the whole nation walks home.
An episode of the marine disturbance was
that the Court ordered a crew to be pro-
vided for a certain vessel. Whereupon the
union secretary, an imported gentleman
named Walsh with no small opinion of him-
self, frankly explained to his Honor the
extent of his Honor’s unimportance by telling
him that the crew would not be supplied.
If his Honor didn’t like it lie could lump it.
I'lie meekest Judge on the Bench took it as
though it was what he was paid for. Accord-
ing to the Minister for Works in Westralia’s
Labor Government, the same imported gentle-
man called on him with a scheme by which
strikers were to hold up the port of Fre-
mantle, not on account of any grievance, but
that the Ministry might have an excuse to
back down and make “concessions” to the
union. The hold-up began in due course,
and the concessions are being waited for.
Tasmania’s House of Dodery has been mak-
ing a name for itself by holding up even the
smallest items of proposed expenditure. The
other day, led by Joe Darling, M.D.C., it de-
manded a full and complete explanation from
the Government in regard to a proposal to in-
stall a cash-register in one of the departments.
I'lie suspicious item was duly postponed until
the information was produced and the Min-
isterial rep. had made an exhaustive state-
ment showing that the installation would re-
sult in saving £8 9s. 24d., or some such
lordly sum, a year. These goings-on by the
ancient House are naturally provocative of
sniggers, and at time of writing the Deg.
Council is giving rise to more grins to the
square mile in Tasmania than ever before in
its history. The Lyons Government, which
nas to face the electors not later than May
next in any case, is hoping that the An-
cients will keep on making themselves ridi-
culous right up to nomination day. In which
case, of course, the issue will be tipper House
abolition. And on that issue Lyons will win
easily.
From the N. 8. Wales Gallery:—
Two piquant incidents of the week were the Leg.
Council s rejection of the Local Government Amend-
ment Bill, which the Fuller Government had promised
to Bruxner’s Progressives (it empowered shires object-
ing to the Valuer-General’s Department, an insti-
tution loathed in Northern N. S. Wales, to make
their own valuations for rating purposes), and
Attorney-General Bavin’s reply to the rowdiest
section of his critics. Bavin, though a man of
ability, and as straight as a die, is the most abused
figure in N. S. Wales politics. Trade-unions, public-
service associations, Labor and pony-racing newspapers
have pursued him with roars of rage. Singling out
the pony paper, he connected its campaign of mud-
slinging with a remonstrance he had made about
an unsavory case in which employees of the journal
had gone to the house of a suicide, removed a letter
tddressed to a girl whom the man had tried to
ehoot, and published it. Bavin’s speech was uncom-
monly spirited, and for once he had the House on
his side. But the badgered A.-G. -hasn’t finished
with his detractors yet. He is joining forces with
George Black and other downy old birds in the Leg.
Council to prohibit the publication of the luscious
details of divorce cases—details which bring so
much grist to the mill of sensational journalism. It
is an axiom in well-regulated newspaper offices that
it doesn’t pay to libel lawyers, and baiting Attorneys-
General is an equally unprofitable game.

reward was a lecture from an infuriated
chief. “What in the d’you mean !'
he roared. “You walked across there as if
you were a Sunday-school picnic! I
asked you to imagine that you were soldiers
crossing exposed ground towards a position
in which there were guns to pick off any-
one exposing himself, but you appeared to
imagine you were a heliotrope wedding
party.” A hard-faced sergeant spoke up m
exculpation. “You see, sir,” he said, ‘we
imagined it was a pitch-dark night.”

“Intonsus”: When mankind reverts to
sanity and whiskers, the pictures of Stanley
Baldwin and Stanley Bruce (and possibly
some of their immediate successors) will
serve as mementoes of an age when there
was no tyranny like that of fashion. Con-
sider the - clean-sliaved Bruce’s predecessors.
You must pass six faces, either bearded or
moustached, in mental review before getting
back to the only smooth one; and Barton,
of course, was a lawyer, one of the class
which even in hirsute periods has always re-
lied on razors to make it look more profes-
sional. As for the pre-Baldwin heads of
British Governments, if it wasn’t for a single
exception (Lord Rosebery) it would tin
necessary to go back almost to ear]'" Victorian
times to find clean-shaven Prime "Ministers.
And Rosebery was a very transient and acci-
dental P.M.—his pink-and-white face in a
picture gallery of such nocables would make
him look as if he had strayed there by mis-
take. After him came Salisbury with the
beard that rendered neckties superfluous; be-
fore him Gladstone with the whiskers that
waved as if they were the oriflamme of
Liberalism; a little sooner the glittering
Dizzy with the chin-tuft probably modelled
on the French imperial. Palmerston, Derby
and Russell cultivated the sideboards of the
period, I think I am correct in saying;
barring for the brief Rosebery interlude, whis-
kers in some form had a clear 70 years run
at Downing-street till Baldwin came along.
“Room Thirty-two": In modern Labor
circles strategy counts for much. In a
Sydney suburban league a disgruntled coterie
had been trying for months to depose the
president, who in the course of time would
have charge of the local polling-booth in the
triennial pre-selection ballot; but the plan had
been blocked by the invariable attendance of
a number of staunch female supporters of
the man in the chair. It wasn’t till just
LISTENING-IN.
“ Don’t you like it?”
“Bores me stiff! What’s the good of a talk you can’t join in?”
before the meeting prior to the selection
ballot that the schemers hit on the right
method of getting rid of this phalanx. The
usual censure motion had been duly tabled,
and then the conspirators bought a score of
tickets for reserved seats at the local picture-
show. They were marked ••Complimentary”
and along with a persuasive type-written
circular booming a super-film that was to be
exhibited that night were delivered to the
ladies an hour or two before the meeting.
Nearly all the recipients jumped at the chance
of viewing Vera Vampeyes in “Hectic Hus-
bands and Wistful Wives” for nix, and that
night the league president was badly beaten
and another was elected in liis place. The
incoming president did his dirty work well
at the ballot-box in the selection that followed
a few weeks after, which explains why an
almost unknown candidate secured an ab-
normal number of votes in that particular
area.
“FY7”: The “new
rush” in Fitzroy, Mel-
bourne, where alluvial
claims were pegged out
in a Chinaman’s back
yard, recalls a similar
Brisbane happening in the
’eighties. When the foun-
dations of the Courier
building, in Queen-street,
were being dug, colors
were found and claims
were promptly pegged
out. It gave the Courier
people some worry and
caused a little expense,
but the excitement soon
petered out —the sooner
when it was established
that colors could be got
anywhere about Brisbane.
The scrubby hills around
Ithaca, Morningside and
other then outlying sub-
urbs were dotted in those
days with prospectors pot-
holes. They were to be
seen even in Victoria Park,
quite near the city, while
Enoggera water reserve
supported odd ’weight-
chasers for a number of
years.
“C.G.C.”: The intricacies and finer
shades of the French language involved
many Diggers in embarrassments. An
A.I.F. man of my acquaintance in
Alexandria was on very friendly terms
with a European family which included two
charming daughters. The ladies spoke Eng-
lish very diffidently, so the Aussie, after
studying somebody’s “French in Ten
Seconds,” essayed to converse with them in
their own language. Accompanying them for
a stroll round the city one day he noticed on
a door a brass plate which bore the inscrip-
tion “Madame , Sage Femme.” “Wise
woman,” he said to himself—“she must be
a fortune-teller,” and promptly suggested to
his fair companions that they should go in
and interview the lady. A depressing silence
ensued, and the girls discovered urgent ap-
pointments elsewhere. Beset by misgivings
the Digger took refuge in a near-by hotel
to consult his pocket dictionary. A whole
bottle of cognac failed to disperse his gloom
when he discovered that Madame was hang-
ing out the shingle of the midwife.
“Swiss”: “Rarb’s” peripatetic clink (B.
13/11/’24) reminds me that in the early days
of Hughenden (N.Q.) the lock-up was a
log. and one of unimposing size at that, for
the timber in the vicinity includes no forest
giants. One morning, while their custodians
were relaxing in a game of billiards, I saw
three prisoners carry the log (to which they
were obviously attached) into the yard of
a handy pub. After sinking several drinks
they duly restored the clink to its accus-
tomed place, and resumed their bunks in the
toyt, authority being none the wiser for the
interlude. In other parts it was the prac-
tice of the Law to take along a chain to
local race-meetings; in the event of any
patron proving obstreperous he was promptly
tethered to a handy tree, thus permitting the
officer to continue his supervision over the
balance of the concourse. The last time I
saw the system in operation was at Forsayth
some 10 years ago.

“The Beak” : Parliament and politics are
fertile grounds for the production of literary
bulls and bloomers. A N. S. Wales aspirant,
touring a large electorate, happened to hear
another of the candidates use the word “her-
maphrodite.”. This high-sounding and evi-
dently military word tickled his ear, and,
determined not to be beaten by the other
fellow, he stored it up for use. He was
elected, and almost at once had to address
a number of school children, and did so in
these words: “You, my dear children, will
be the future citizens and electors of this
State, and from you, God willing, we shall
draw our great and glorious army of her-
maphrodites.”

“Ex-Dig” : The matrimonial affairs of that
Sydney John Harding whose evidence was
mainly responsible for sending Colin Boss
to the gallows have been reviewed by the
Melbourne Divorce Court. The police got
Harding out of the State where his life was
in danger from the underworld friends of
Ross; wherefore, although before that he
and his wife had been separated, Justice
Macfarlan decided that in the circumstances
Harding’s absence could not be described as
“wilful desertion.” The wife was told, how-
ever, that she could obtain a divorce by
basing her petition on her husband’s frequent
convictions. The more one knows ,of Ilard-

ing the greater must be one’s mistrust of the
testimony he gave. Even the credit he got
for being a returned soldier was not earned.
He enlisted in Nov., 1914, and was away just
six months. Then they sent him back. Ross
was not much better perhaps; but to this
day T. C. Brennan, who defended him, de-
clares that he was not guilty of the murder.

THE FERRY STEAMERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Empearled amidst the morning gold the wakened city
stands ;
The treasure chests can hardly hold their spoil ot
many lands ;
And there is neither watch nor ward on gate and
towered wall
Nor man-at-arms to draw the sword and speed the
warning call ;
Vet dashing to the city’s throat from cove and point
and bay
Each painted, rakish, rushing boat is driving through
the spray.
And two by two across the sea to seek their hearts'
desire
Come Bos’n Blunderbus, J.P., and Captain Kidd,
Esquire.
They slice the plug and spin the tale and blow- the
brawny chest
That's reminiscent of a whale just southward of the
vest;
And it’s “I’ll show you building land as fine as you
could see”—
“Dear chap,” 1 said, “please understand, you won't
sell shares to me.”....
“And vot you tink? All cotton-lined and at der
price of silk !”....
“The capital, old man, you’ll find is watered, like
the milk !”....
“Oh, yep, I’ve got to sell or shut; I’m busted since
the fire,”
Says Bos’n Blunderbus, J.P., to Captain Kidd, Esquire.
The ropes that strangle pile and pier unleash the
wild assault—
If Blunderbus brings up the rear his bunions are at
fault.
They jamb the streets and leap the stairs, wrench off
the coffer lids ;
Ten thousand padded office chairs hold fighting Captain
Kidds.
They storm Success in eager ranks with stock or wool
or grain ;
They- tear the coinage from the banks and pour it
back again.
And high above the struggle dire peals out the note
of glee
>.i,en good old Captain Kidd, Esquire, slugs Blunder-
bus, J.P.
Old Blunderbus has seldom failed among the fighting
men—
He lifts ten creditors impaled upon his office pen.
But ere his crested helm appears his bitter cup is
quaffed,
For, blowing cold about his ears, he feels the over-
draft.
VICE VERSA.
“My husband’s awfully jealous.”
“How embarrassing !”
“Yes. Isn’t yours?”
“Not a bit.”
“How humiliating!”
Whole regiments armed with lusty throats are fighting
tooth and nail
With Contracts, Promissory Notes, and heavy Bills
of Sale;
But, short and thick or long and lank, they seek the
harbor foam,
For each in turn must walk the plank, and steam
away for home.
“A busy day,” says Blunderbus to Captain Kidd,
Esquire,
“I reckon this ’ere Fickle Cuss will win if he’s a
trier”....
"l'ou haven’t seen my youngest yet, a bonny little
chap”....
“To-night, all right, now don’t forget, we’ll have a
hand at nap”....
“.hist stick them somewhere in the ground, they’re
easy things to grow" '
‘Do your kids ever haul you round to some dashed
picture-show?”
“Good night—the wire she’ll rouse a treat; 1 m
rather late for tea 1”
And Captain Ividd leaves all the street to Blunder-
bus, •T.P.

“Hamer” : Arthur Streeton told a meeting
of the Institute of Arts and Literature in
Melbourne that his one-man show of paint-
ings on his return from Europe about 1906
was the first of its kind held in Australia.
I know earlier ones. They used to be
held in a shop window and—these things
being easier to work in those days—permis-
sion to run an art-union at a bob a time was
secured, the pictures being the prizes. I
don’t think that the name of the artist re-
sponsible for them is treasured in the annals
of Australian art, but the beer that
the proceeds bought was better than can
be got nowadays for more money. We—
there were three of us —used to collect the
proceeds as they dribbled in. One picture in
particular remains in my memory. Our artist
had painted “Mitre Peak, M.L.,” when the
third of our company (a six-foot-four giant
whom the ladies used to call “Fairy”) sug-
gested that a cow in the foreground was
essential in a picture intended for sale in
Australia, and said it looked like the Upper
Clarence country. So a cow went in, and the
picture was named “A Reach of the Upper
Clarence.” The masterpiece was won by a
publican who had accepted an Art Union
ticket in lieu of payment for drinks; and as
he raffled it three times, and one of his family
won each time, I think it was a profitable
speculation.

“Sixenate”: Some people think that the
family-circle hasn’t its old strong ties; but
they weren’t at a Melbourne suburban court
with me the other morning. When the court
was declared open there was standing room
only in the corridors; and until the police
demanded silence there was a mutter as of
impending battle. As far as a plain tale could
be sorted from the tangled evidence, a wife,
in the course of an ordinary domestic
squabble, made an infuriating remark about
her husband’s mother. Whereupon he
“slammed her one.” Her sister took a hand
in the disturbance by throwing crockery at
the slammer and biting his ear; being ejected
from the household, she returned with re-
inforcements in the form of her father, brother
and cousin, who fell upon the man and bore
him down by weight of numbers. But he,
too, had relations, and, hastily summoned by
the outnumbered garrison, they routed the
victorious forces and chased them to the house

“Geoffrey gave me these pearls because he said they were
like my character.”
“That’s awkward! He gave me a necklace of jade.”
of the father-in-law. blushed with success,
the victorious husband took his allies home
to celebrate; but the fiery cross was raised
by the enemy, and the party had to dis-
continue its revelry to repel a new invasion.
There were several more scrimmages, but
all the Court was asked to do w 7 as to fix a
penalty for the husband’s original “slam.”
It declined to do more than “bind him over” ;
which judgment w 7 as responsible for an im-
mediate clash outside the court amongst
the rival forces not bound over, and the
local police couldn’t get a decent sleep all
the morning.
“Carcharias” : Australia’s first train-ferry,
the Swallow, now carrying trucks between
North and South Grafton (N.S.W.), has at
least one tragedy recorded in her log. On
the outward voyage from Rangoon to Svdney,
some 11 years ago, she anchored at Thurs-
day Island, off the old pilot jetty. Late one
night the chief en-
gineer, the mate
and a Japanese
were boarding a
dinghy at the jetty
to return to the
vessel, when the
former slipped on
the metal-slieathed
steps and capsized
the little craft,
with the mate and
the Jap already in
it. The strong cur-
rent swept the
mate away from
the jetty and under
the bobstay of an
anchored lugger.
He managed to
climb aboard, but
the other two met
a horrible fate.
Next morning's
search disclosed the
engineer’s body on
the reef past the
hospital point. The
head, face and feet
were almost un-
marked, but no-
thing was left in
between except the
spinal column with
a few inches of rib,
the pelvis and the
leg-bones. From
neck to ankle the
flesh had been
carved down to the
bones by sharks’
teeth as cleanly as
if cut with a but-
cher’s knife. Ex-
amination of the
small piece of lung
left in the cut-off
rib bases satisfied
the Government
medical officer that
the man was not drowned. Of the Japanese
only a portion of one arm was picked up.
“J.A.8.”; In a M.L. township recently an
amateur boxer of local fame, whose wife
was away, spent a jovial evening from home,
and failed to discover until his return that
he had locked hfmself out of his domicile.
After a period of muddled consideration he
decided to smash a small pane of glass at
the side, of the front door, put his hand
through and unlock the door on the inside.
Nodding complacently at his own resource,
he went to the clothes-line for a towel,
wrapped it round his right hand, and sparred
up to the window. It was here that habit
became too strong for him; he feinted with
his right, and jabbed his left through the
glass. I was the doctor who was knocked
up to stitch the cut.
“Birrivock”: How 7 hard it
is to define courage ! I have
known a V.C. scared by a
scolding woman, and seen an
intrepid explorer shivering
at a crowded crossing. In
Malta in 1916 I met an Eng-
lish regular, a decorated
Mons officer, whose job, that
of landing officer when hos-
pital cases were arriving
from Gallipoli, brought him
so near to a breakdowm that
he personally saw the Gov-
ernor (Lord Methuen) and
wangled a return to the
peace of the trenches. Shorn
of the excitement of action,
the pure misery he had to
face became unendurable to
him. Men would die in his
arms, maimed boys would
give him dying messages,
mental cases_ would rave
and babble. He told me, in
all sincerity, that he thought
he w’ould go mad. Return-
ing to France he collected
more decorations and two
happy wounds.
“Bill R.”: Put this into the precipitate
matrimony collection. The widow of
a Monaro (N.S.VV.) selector was driving
her springcart across Bungarby Plain when
it capsized. A stranger opportunely ap-
peared from over the horizon and assisted in
righting the overturned vehicle. He proved
to be ” widower from the Snowy River, and
the courtship progressed so quickly that the
pair were married the next morning. Inci-
dentally, each of them already possessed 10
children, so there was some sort of a founda-
tion to start on.
“The Deacon”: The pilgrim’s progress of
a youth of 89 has been causing the Bench and
police over a wide area of N. S. Wales con-
siderable perplexity. For the greater part of
the year the veteran is tucked away in the
Old Men’s Home at Parramatta, but with
the first hint of Spring up goes Matilda and
ONE AS RAD AS ANOTHER.
“Do you believe getting married on Friday is unlucky?”
“Of course I do!”
“Hut why is Friday more unlucky than any other day?”

he starts out on the long trek to Wagga. For
years it has been his custom to spend his
birthday at the graveside of his mother, but
the 330 miles naturally take some negotiat-
ing. The kindly Johns en route are always
perturbed lest the other Old Man may way-
lay him by the roadside, but with his knot
aloft and stick in hand he wins along. This
year the sergeant at Wagga introduced him
to the Bench as Kay Pritchard Hughes, and
told the story of his odyssey; and for want
of a better way of assisting him he w r as
charged under the elastic Vagrancy Act. But
the old battler’s ready tongue convinced the
beak that his liberty, plus his stick and a
pair of shears (he trims hedges for tucker),
was all he required for his constitutional,
and soon he was cheerfully footslogging along
the return track.
“Fi Fa”: Yiddish is used more extensively
in Australia than most people realise (B.
20/11/’24). I recollect a law case in Bris-
bane a few years ago, between two Hebrew
ole-clo’ dealers. Complainant was in the box
and under a rather searching cross-examina-
tion she shot out a stream of Yiddish at
defendant, who excitedly talked back in the
same language. It transpired that all the
six members of the two families, one of them
a girl attending a State school, habitually
spoke Yiddish. There are sometimes difficul-
ties about exact interpretation. In the case
mentioned the complainant caused some
mild excitement by saying that one daughter,
a girl of 18, had run out into the street
naked to prevent defendant breaking the shop
windows. The young lady in question sub-
sequently qualified this by explaining that
her mother meant undressed ; actually she had
been clad in a nightgown and draped in a
blanket. A sight of relief went up from the
courtroom.
* * * *
“Hamer”: A Fitzroy schoolmaster con-
fided to me that when interrogating new
pupils—the sort of new pupils who introduce
themselves —his greatest trouble is to ascer-
tain the Christian name of the male parent.
Three answers that he received recently on
the one morning in response to the same
question were (1) “Jones, like myself”; (2)
“Ginger” (the youth adding that this was
what his mother called the head of the house-
hold, and he did not know of any other
name) ; and (3) “My father ain’t got a
Christian name: lie ain’t a Christian. Mother
is—she’s a Congregationalism Father’s a
Roman Catholic.
* * * *
“Centurion”: There are jobs still going for
the Soldier of Fortune. The cable mentions
a slight fuss in England over the departure
of two British airmen for Jeddah; their
offence was that they left without seeking
permission from the Air Council, possibly
realising the unlikeliness of receiving it. The
chances are that they have struck an opulent
employer in the King of the Hejaz, who
wants the infidels to bomb the wowser
Wahabis out of the sacred city of Mecca,
whence they have chased his Majesty. The
King, Ali by name, gathered in a pot of
sovereigns during and after the war for his
assistance on the desert border of Palestine
and his work on the Hejaz railway. His
troops got more cash for value given than
any others before or since, as any Light
Horseman who saw them on active service
will agree. The subsidies to Ali were all in
gold, the artless Arab refusing any other
tender. If the two fliers are lucky enough
to avoid being taken prisoners by the
Wahabi, they should be able to rake in
enough to tide them over till the next stunt.

“Sol Malaprop” : I think the dailies, especi-
ally those which print jokes, anecdotes and
portraits of leading nonentities on the front
page, should devote a column to “Uncon-
scious Humor, or the Want of It,” though
I suppose, the humor being unconscious,
they would put the wrong things in the
column. In one recent issue it was set
forth that nine lions at Pretoria Zoo had
died from strychnine poisoning, and foul
play was suspected. As the animals hadn’t
bought poison at any local shop, and had
left no written notice of their intention
to commit the rash act, the matter almost
looks like certainty, but the Archimedean lever

gagement is announced."

was taking no risks. Another item w 7 as to the
effect that Rowley, who married the Earl of
Dundonald’s daughter, wants a divorce, and
so does she. There were sordid details about
the lady emptying the teapot, the milk-jug
and the marmalade pot over her lord and
master, but the interesting point was that,
on one occasion, three nurses had to hang
on to the peers coat-tails to prevent him
attacking his son-in-law. Nurses are hefty
women, as a rule, and if the earl was a
big man, and was pulling with the usual
energy of the Scottish race, the one inter-
esting problem in the case is whether the
tail held, or didn’t. Nothing was said about
this, nor was there any news as to where
similar clothes are for sale. Still another
item was_ to the effect that a “heavily-
financed” Yankee expedition is shortly start-
ing for Mount Everest. It will probably con-
sist wholly of millionaires. Uncle Washing-
ton has an enduring faith in the dollars, and
his idea is that the richest man gets to the
top first.
AFTER THE RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The red-gum tips are flaming in the sun,
The turpentines are whitening in the breeze,
A thousand baby airs with laughter run,
Playing at hide-and-seek among the trees.
Under the rooks the feirn in green and gold
Make magic carpets for the dreaming feet,
And in the shadowy places damp and cold
The great red roots in rugged arches meet.
There are a thousand voices in the trees,
The blossoms whiten all the hill like snow ;
It is the glorv-time of birds and bees
And every hour has fresh delight to show.
But in the ordered garden, where the brown
Of new-turned earth recorded faith and deeds,
The thistle lifts his angry Scottish crown,
And all the growth is weeds and weeds anl
weeds.

“Rev. Vale Owen, of Birmingham, declared that
spirits had told him that all the buildings demolished
in war-time were being re-erected in Heaven. Lou-
vain’s wonderful old library had been reconstructed
as a sort of celestial university, he declared.”
Well, I’ll not start prospecting for books and such
things
When my spirit goes soaring on high,
And they give me a harp and a halo and wings
And the run, so to speak, of the sky.
For I’m hoping to find on the heavenly shore
Some livelier joints that we lost in the war.
As I walk in the streets, with the angels around,
I hope that I’ll quickly be shown
Where bob-a-plate oysters once more can be found
And they know how to devil a bone.
There’ll be barmaids to open their optics of blue
And murmur delightedly “Hamer, it’s you!”
There’ll be tankards well charged with the juice of
the hop
In pubs never closing at six;
And I’ll eat half and half in Ted Slattery’s shop
Re-built with celestial bricks;
And perchance I may find what I’ve missed more
than all,
The sawdusted floor of the “’Ole in the Wall.”
Yes, yes, I have visions of Heaven to be
(When Peter flings open the door)
Where they’re keeping the old merry pleasures for me
That went up in the smoke of the war.
The libr’ies can wait in those beautiful spheres
Till the froth I have blown off the threepenny beers.

Last year this society notched still further
records. Total income climbed well beyond
the two-million mark, an advance of over a
quarter-million, and the total funds reached
£7,510,749, a gain of £1,072,924 in the 12
months. It is interesting to recall that com-
bined funds in 1900 amounted to £503,789.
The progress is remarkable. In the Ordinary
branch income lias more than doubled in the
past six years, and more than trebled in the
past 10. In the Industrial department the
increase is even more notable: income has
more than doubled in six years, and trebled
in eight.
Last year's figures indicate an intensive
selling campaign which might reasonably
have been expected to swell the expense rate.
Actually the effect was negligible in the
Ordinary branch —a mere Is. p.c.—while in
the Industrial there was a fall of 3s. p.c. to
the lowest point on record. Here is a twenty-
year comparison:—

The Industrial branch record is very strik-
ing. In 1914 the expense rate was £3B 10s.
3d. p.c.; last year it w T as £33 13s. 9d. —a
difference of £4 16s. 6d. p.c., which, related
to last year’s income, meant a saving of
£62,600-odd. Inasmuch as the T. and G.
pays bonuses on Industrial policies, that sav-
ing is worth a lot, both front tho viewpoint
of saving per se, and as selling argument for
further Industrial business. The actuary’s
valuation covering last year disclosed a sur-
plus of £226,534, £151,293 in the Ordinary
branch and £75,241 in the Industrial. So
far as the latter is concerned, £73,194 is
allocated for reversionary bonuses, equal to
10 weeks’ premiums on* policies from five to
10 years in force, 20 weeks’ premiums from
10 to 20 years, and the equivalent of 30
weeks’ premiums on all over 20 years. Ordi-
nary policy-holders benefited from 425. for
each £lOO of whole-life policies one year in
force, to 68s. for a policy 23 : years in force,
and, for endowment assurance policies, from
325. p.c. to 58s. p.c. This is an all-round
increase of 2s. p.c. over 1923. New ordinary
business again was written at a rate to make
some of the young cos. —and old ones, for
that matter —envious. Allowing 7 p.c. of
renewal premiums as a fair charge for old
business and debiting the balance of ex-
penses against first premiums, you get a new-
business cost of just over 78 p.c. This as an
increase of 4 p.c. over 1923; but as 19.930
new policies assuring the record amount of
£4,368,741 were written, the movement isn’t
surprising.

In all payments to policy-holders amounted
to £485.609, or £68,356 more than 19-3 . in
the Ordinary branch death claims accounted
for £59,790 and endowments mature!,
£70,445: in the Industrial £94,010 for dea tlh
£101.057 for maturity claims. A glance at
the table shows how. the ratio has been re-
duced since 1914, mainly, of course, because
of the tremendous increase m new business
chiefly, no doubt, risks on young lives.
Doubtless the visiting nursing service has
also had some effect on the figures. This
scheme has been further extended. T le re
periodic medical examination, initiated last
year, is said to have been largely availed of
bv policy-holders, and the Society is satisfied
that this scheme, too, has the effect of post-
poning the visit of the undertaker and there-
fore the payment of claims.
The next table shows the steady increase
in investment earnings :

The Society is nearing its lialf-century, and
is making large preparations to meet the
anniversary impressively. Its big Brisbane
office was completed in January, a 10-storeyed
building is climbing upwards in Adelaide,
and sites for premises in Wellington and
Christchurch (M.L.) have been purchased.

Until a few years back the co.’s financial
headquarters were in London; then John
Bull’s taxes became a burden, and the seal ot
the co. was brought to Melbourne, along with
that of Buckley and Nunn, which is a family
connection. As in the case, of B. and N-,
the public is interested only in Robert Reid s
prefs. and debenture stock. Both concerns
have been profitable; hut ordinaries have not
had such a glorious harvest from the whole-
sale swings as from the retail roundabouts.
At the time of Robert Reid’s transfer to
Australia £200.000 of 7 p.c. prefs. and
£150,000 of 6 p.c. mortgage debentures were
issued to replace somewhat similar issues
held in England; and early in 1921 £250,000
of 8 p.c. prefs were offered and snapped up.
Big profits were made immediately after the
transfer. Reserves, substantial to start with,
were soon almost half a million, so £161.669
was capitalised. The old co.’s profits had
been: 1916, £65,380; 1917, £6B 338: 1918,
£109.054. The increase to £309.562 dis-
closed in the boom year looked like an amaz-
ing stride. However, it wasn’t all that it
seemed at the time, and the slump took the
gilt off the performance. As soon as the
nasty streak became visible, the Board de-
cided to wipe off £300,000 from stocks in one
stroke, and though that nearly righted mat-
ters, 1922 profits were only £35.457. But at
no time had holders of prefs. and debenture
stocks any reason to stay awake at nights;
and at present the position is:—

After providing for liabilities, debentures
and first prefs.. there was a surplus of liquid
and semi-liquid assets of £843,560 to cover
the quarter-million of 8 p.c. profs., or over
£3 7s. for each fl share. Incidentally, the
co. has established a nice little pension fund
of £54.408. This hasn’t been included with
the liabilities in the last table. Perhaps it
should be. On the other hand, though plant
and fixtures are evidently written down out
of profits, a plant and fixtures depreciation
fund is being steadily added to. It amounts
now to £31,356, and has not been included
with the reserves shown above.

The directors ascribe the loss for the second
consecutive year mainly to over-producing,
accumulations having to be sold at a loss.
The realisation of what’s wrong should go far
towards ending it. As far as can be judged
the plant and the organisation are now effici-
ent, nor is the co. bothered by a burden of
debentures. Practically half the capital is
in prefs. These have had only one div., but
if the profits are not there, even pref. share-
holders can do no more than wait until they
arrive. (Debenture-holders, as Gold’s found
out in Svdnev, are different cattle.) Lincoln
Mills (Australia), Ltd., is a holding co. It
was formed in 1922, when the Lincoln spinning
and knitting concerns decided to free them-
selves from their dependence on outside
money and provide for expansion. Capital
consisted of £802,631: £402,631 in £1 ordi-
naries was issued for the two concerns (good-
will was placed at £80,000) and £400,000 m
9 p.c. cum. prefs. was offered to the public.
All that glittered in the prospectus was not
gold. Speaking “conservatively” and with
“moderation” the promoters estimated profits
at £98,875 p.a., but the table shows how hard
facts have refused to accord with airy
theory. Holding cos. are taciturn, as a rule,
but on this occasion the directors are com-
municative to the extent of stating that __the
two subsidiaries made a net loss of £42,582.
Under technical advice a policy of re-orgam-
sation has been adopted; but “a considerable
period must necessarily elapse before the
benefits accruing from such re-organisation
will become apparent,” they say, though they
claim that even now figures are better than
they were. The tone of the report indicates
that the present directors have got a grip
of things. The mills are, according to the
“Wild Cat’s” information, up-to-date, and the
co. owns the only silk-throwing plant in the
Commonwealth, which should give it an
advantage. The field still to be covered
amounts to the millions’ worth of those goods
still imported, mostly, it is true, the product
of cheap-labor countries overseas ; and accord-
ing to the directors divs. are not likely for a
considerable period—apparently the manu-
facturing cos. want to fill up a few holes
before they pay out dividends. The security
for prefs., judged by the details which
appeared in the prospectus, should be ample,
but the condition and value of the assets are
matters on which the holding co. says nothing
in this last report.

This co. was started in the early ’seventies
by a grand-nephew of Bobby Burns, and
having to fight prejudice as well as ordinary
competition, only very careful management
saved its life. For the 10 years to 191 J
divs. averaged only 5 p.c. Then 7 p.c. was
paid for a few terms; and the introductory
table tells the rest of that story. Even
when the war gave the co. accidental Pro-
tection and permitted of big earnings, the
Board made no departure from its customary
caution, though it gave a bit better return to
shareholders. The next table is informative
on the matter of plant:—

Of that £71.639 of plant and property m
1910, the mill was down at £61.644. In the
intervening years almost £67.000 has been
spent on new machinery, yet the book value
of “land, buildings and machinery” at last
balance was only £47,970. Which suggests
that the directors don’t believe in having any
of their capital represented by obsolete or
worn-out junk: in other words, they make
profits pay for the plant worn out in earning
them. Which is the only honest thing to do.
In other lines there has not been much
change of late. Liquid assets (£136.088) as
at October 6 were £101.721 in excess of
liabilities, and paid capital is only £95,380;
and there is, besides, the property and plant
with a book value of £53.970.
Steady business expansion was interrupted
last year, but the management succeeded in
keeping exes, down :

No doubt foreign competition was respon-
sible for the shrinkage of gross profits, and
that competition isn’t finished yet, by a long
way. Even the heightening of tariff walls
will not protect us until we realise that,
generally speaking, our competitors are
working a lot harder than we are.

The position was unsatisfactory_ from tlie
beginning; in fact, at the beginning it was
scandalous. More than half the capital o,
£35.000 was represented by goodwill and
£5750 by leases, and extremely short leases
at that. Fortunately, when the thing looked
like a total wreck, the co. was able to acquire
the business of Miss Bishop, cake-maker,
and since then various shops liavo been
opened under that name. Ordinary share-
holders have not had a div. since
1010. Accumulated losses were over
the £lO.OOO mark by March, 1022, but on
paper, at any rate, that has now been con-
verted into the small reserves shown. The
improvement since that year certainly has
been substantial: —

The opening table does not show anything
written off for a couple of years. Actually
£lBOO was put by last half-year, and £7OO
in its predecessor to provide for “deprecia-
tion and taxation” ; and there is a reserve for
“depreciation, etc.,” now amounting to £6360.
But this is probably not a true reserve, and is
not reckoned as such in the table. So far
as profits are concerned prospects are better;
but the security for capital is still poor. Be-
sides the liquid surplus shown above (£3356)
there is £13.810 in freeholds and £20,970
(less depreciation reserve) in plant and fit-
tings.

The declared profit seems too poor to he
true; and yet it probably is near the mark.
Certainly, though again and again the co.
has been suspected of stuffing away profits,
such things were never and don’t
appear to have existed, and there is no better
reason to suspect that they exist now. Other

The absence of friction in Pioneer Wood Pipe per-
mits of its carrying a bigger volume of liquid, size
for size, than any cast-iron, steel or concrete pipe.
It is a well-known engineering fact that smoothly-
planed timber has the lowest co-efficient of friction,
and the inside bore of Pioneer Wood Pipe, when
finished, is as smooth as modern machinery can make
wood. No corrosion, tuberculation, formation of scale,
nor accumulation of organic growths chokes it s
diameter, capacity or velocity Of flow'. Neither ex-
tremes of temperature nor electrolysis harm it.
Pioneer Wood Pipe merits thorough investigation

GUTHRIDGE LTD., 10 George Street, Camperdown, Sydney.
Greta, though the pioneer of the field, has
given its shareholders but one small lot, anl
only twice in 11 years has the dividend
touched 10 p.c. Maybe the marketing was
at fault - maybe the inclined workings weie
a handicap. Three or four years ago, seeing
the end of the old mines —hast Greta and
Stanford Merthyr—approaching, the co.
looked around for other territory, and bough.
3072 acres at Millfield, near Cessnock. and
6000 acres alongside at Ellalong. Bores
had proved here a fine 12ft. seam. \> anting
capital to turn this into a mine the co. put
up a proposition to the Adelaide S. S. Go.,
which took 235,000 £1 shares at par. ihus
the co scored money and a market at one
stroke.’ With these facts in mind Pitt-street
expected better than 6 p.c. for. the past year;
but the new mine, though it is now turning
out 250 tons a day, hasn’t been much of a
producer yet. Things ought to show a change
presently. Up to 1918 the co. also owned
the East Greta railway; but this property
was then taken over by the South Maitland
Railways. Ltd., the co. receiving payment m
149,798 shares. Balance-sheet movements
over five years have been :

Expenditure account for the new pit has
moved from £240,840 to £280,279 in the last
12 months. The outlay lias been heavy, but
the equipment is modern, and in an output of
2000 tons a day, if the market can absorb it,
there should be- something fatter than the
co. has ever had yet. As to marketing pros-
pects, Melbourne is not going to be as good
a buyer from Newcastle as it has been in
the past: but this co.'s connection with the
Adelaide S. S. Co. will give it chances it
never had in the old disappointing days.

Recent W.A. Mines Department reports
declare that in view of the high price of
lead Westralia should prove attractive to
investors. On its oldest field, Northampton,
several mines have been re-opened and
some are doing well. New finds on a couple
of farms there have also helped. In one
instance a piece of galena pulled out of the
ground by a cocky led to the discovery of
a 3ft. lode assaying 30 p.c. lead; and the
picking up of floaters by another cocky was
followed by the opening up near the surface
of a rich make. Glowing reports have also
reached Perth about the value of another
lead-bearing area at Braeside, on the far-
distant Pilbarra field. There, according to
official reports, lodes can be traced for nine
miles o)i the surface, and, in places, assay
up to 80 p.c. lead. Practically no work, how-
ever, has been done on these bodies, so their
size and value are unknown.
* * * *
Pernatty Central, one of the many Adel-
aide cos, that drew a blank at Hampton
Plains (W.A.), has let its “mine” on tri-
bute. During the Hampton boom reports
of big lodes, good assays and “London coming
in” sent the co.’s shares from a few shillings
to over £2, and a further £1 rise was talked
of. But the market collapsed soon after, and
most of those who were in were unable to
get out. Since then little has been heard of
the co. or its doings.
Although a big mine has never been found
at the north end of the Kalgoorlie goldfield
many rich patches have been unearthed. The
latest was that struck a few months ago
in the Yorkshire Lass, which forms part of
the old Hannan’s Reward North. So far
two or three hundred tons of ore have been
broken and treated for about £6OOO or £7OOO
worth of gold.

The Financial Times commends West-
ralia for exempting from taxation mining
cos. that have not yet begun to make a profit
for shareholders, and also for exempting from
taxation any additional capital raised by
older cos. for employment in the State. But
the generosity is declared to be very much
offset by its belatedness. In the past few
years oversea capitalists and mining-finance
cos. have turned their backs on the West
and gone elsewhere, notably to Canada. They
will not be lured back, says the Times,
merely by contingent relief of taxation,
especially while labor continues to insist
033 33iinimum hours of work and maximum
rates of pay enfoi'ceable by Arbitration
Courts “with one-sided powers of compul-
sion.”

Dr. Prichard turned up at George Meu-
dell’s Lake Bunga meeting at Scott’s Hotel.
Prichard isn’t behind Bunga, for he is at-
tached too firmly to Torquay oil, but he
still avows that oil is somewhere in the Cab-
bage Garden. Meudell is 033 t to amalga-
mate the scores of leases round Lakes Tyers
a'id Bu3iga. Incidentally, he requires a
£5OO syndicate to do publicity work and help
squeeze a £5OOO subsidy f3'o3n the Allan-Pea-
cock team. But that will be a tough job.
Liquidating Wallaroo and Moonta assets
promises to be a slow job in its fhial stages.
First year’s sales brought in £142,745 for an
outgo of £11.838 to pref. creditors and other
expenditure of £28,829. On Nov. 1, therefore,
£102.078 cash was still in thebank ro
await distribution. Another £22,800 re
mained to be collected, so with a total debt
of £160.565 to be paid, a little gap of some
£% 600 has to be filled. To do that, boilers,
motors, plant, the old mines, stores and
spares and freehold land at Wallaroo have to
be sold, and the market for scrap of that
kind isn’t brisk. Someone has bought the
dumps and cementation plant, and Adelaide
is to form a co. at cost price to the promoters
to work them.

When Autox took over the Costerfield
(Vic.) gold-antimony show, it was filled with
hope that cheap working would squeeze, out
profits where others have shown loss. With
only the last shilling callable, the verdict
of the Bendigo crowd is that it is time to get
out. This means that the English antimony
people who held Costerfield for so long will
have to buck in themselves again or call in
the machinery man to sell off. High costs
and the shipping trouble are stated to be
the cause of the downfall of the. enterprise;
but what did shipping costs really have to
do with it? Antimony-bearing ores are
always difficult of treatment. At Coster-
field, low costs, even if skill is there, are im-
possible to-day. The output at best is so
small that the chance of undercutting the
Chinese in the market for the metal is
very slight. # » *
New Bong Tunnel will have to do better.
Geologist Baragwanath picked the site for
the low level No. 2 tunnel in the ill-fated
North Long Tunnel valley, though about
£200,000 went into the old North mine with-
out a decent reef being cut. The tunnel is
in 200 ft. with 600 ft. to go to hit the eastern
dyke, 400 ft. below No. 1 tunnel. Nothing
tliat will ever set the Thompson River afire
was picked up in No. 1 tunnel, but Hartrick
is so full of faith in Walhalla that he sees
the possibility of something good being got
in the 850 ft. of rock to be traversed. Hope
such as that has kept the fires burning in
Walhalla ever since the Pearsons sold out.
Heavy water drowned the Palmer (N.Q.)
reefs when workings were first put down, and
the supply has not run out. The owners of
the Louisa are finding this out. Recent
work was much hampered, and the pumps are
going at full pressure. Jim Berry, who
went from Charters Towers to manage, lias
left the field. Operations have been in pro-
gress by various parties for the past three
years, and there is no gold yet to compensate
for all this effort. The richness of the stone
has been the lure, but there is a big doubt
as to whether there is enough of it in view
of the isolation and the heavy working
expenses.

The Marvel shaft at Emuford (N.Q.) is
down 40ft., and is now on 15 p.c. tin-ore.
Shareholders who followed Fred Reid’s
advice look like doing well, as capital sub-
scribed is just about made up by the value
of the ore exposed. The shoot has averaged
about 7ft. all the way down, including a foot
of low-grade dirt, and will bulk about 10
p.c. for concentrates. News of the first
crushing is due at any time now, and origi-
nal shareholders seem to be on velvet; the
local market is offering a premium of 60
p.c. on the £lO shares. As a matter of fact,
the issue was much oversubscribed before a
report could be obtained or the prospectus
set up in type.
* * * *
A Gympie (Q.) venture that has no luck
is the Lucknow, where a local syndicate
sank on to a nice quartz reef and followed
it down with a view of testing it in the belt
of plumbago-slate which has carried most of
the gold on the field. They sank through
385 ft. of country, and crosscut at that level
106 ft., but missed the plumbago. It has
been decided to discontinue the lower pros-
pecting work, as apparently the country
there is faulted.
* * * *
Kangaroo Hills tinfield (N.Q.) is having
a quieter time than the promising discoveries
of two years back and the buoyant tin
market would lead one to expect. Only the
Sardine and Canary are producing on any
scale, and the output even of these two is
not up to forecasts. Numerous prospectors’
shows are being worked, and handy parcels
swell the output, but the field is now unite
overshadowed by its northern rival, Her-
berton. The leading mine, the Sardine, has
crushed only 160 tons in the last two months,
although the yield per cent, is handsome,
nearly 10 tons of cones, making the ore
worth £lB per ton. The Canary started on
some shoots which were rich but
small. These will keep the mine going on
a small output, but no new shoots of any
promise have been discovered since.
The option over the Mt. Coolon, Native
Bear and Sydney mines at Mt. Coolon,
taken up by Billy Clark, of Charters Tow-
ers, secures the cream of the field. Some
of the other shows have fair tonnages, but
values are doubtful. The Chilean mill re-
cently erected with Government assistance
is in action, and is putting through a crush-
ing from the Sunbeam. The value of this
ore has been hotly debated on the field,
mainly because of the peculiarity of Coolon
ore, which never gives the same assay re-
sults from identically-sampled parcels. There
are 500 tons at grass at the Sunbeam, as
well as 250 at the Golden Bar and 60 at
the Victory. Some of this has been at grass
for years waiting for crushing facilities.
* * * *
Recent operations at the Misima (Papua)
don’t reflect much credit on the old Block 10
Co. and its management. A trustworthy man
on the spot states the position as follows :
Block 10 Misima called up £170,000, recovered gold
worth £132,000 ahd never showed a profit. Lavish
expenditure and a plant of three times the necessary
capacity swallowed the lot. Leases, mine, stores,
machinery, including seven miles of raliway .lines,
locomotive, etc., valued at over £lOO,OOO were sold
for about £7OOO. A local and Samarai syndicate,
in 12 shares of £250 each, bought leases and material
for about £2OOO, from the purchasers of the property,
and started mining and cyaniding direct, without any
preliminary reduction of ore, under Gilbert O. Wilkin-
son’s management. The venture promises to prove
very remunerative. To date they have treated 1700
for an extraction of £1 4s. a ton, with gold in
zincs and slags to be added. Costs at present run
about £1 per ton, including treatment, mine develop-
ment, maintenance and repairs. As the mine was m
bad shape, owing to being idle for almost two years,
these figures must be considered satisfactory. Present
plant is able to treat 200 tons per week, and costs are
expected to fall to between 15s. and 17b. Misima
is the only co. in Australia that cyanides lode matter
direct. Extraction to date more than compares
favorably with the last recovery by the Block 10 co.
£ 1 6s. per ton, and that was with the aid of up-
to-date mills and slimes plant. Wilkinson, who
knows Queensland fields from end to end, estimates
42*000 tons payable ore to mine.

N.S.W. Mines Department has assayed
some stone from Nibbler’s Hill, 34 miles from
Parkes. One picked sample (as though
picked samples w T ere of any value!) gave
IGoz.- 13dwt. gold and Bdwt. 17gr. silver to
the ton ; another, loz. 13dwt. gold and 6dwt.
13gr. silver. These w T ere taken at 60ft.,
where the lode is said to be 14ft. wide.
Fifty years ago “Jimmy the Nibbler,” an
eccentric old party, found the first gold on
this hill, and there have been desultory at-
tempts at intervals since. But nice-looking
assays are the best it has given.

Harry Lawry, who worked on Old Luck-
now and is said to know the veins from the
deepest levels to the grass-roots, was ap-
pointed manager of Lucknow’ Pups a couple
of weeks ago. His report to the directors
states that the three veins in the s.-e. work-
ings are developing the characteristics which
marked Old Lucknow’, and he is very opti-
mistic. But optimism is poor stuff to fatten
on. In 1922, Lawry, managing the Luck-
now’ Mines and having only 20ft. to 30ft. of
old country to handle below the basalt, found
a small brown vein which gave 590 z„ the most
from the present revival. Underfoot, liis
chance wms nil with 20 miles of waterlogged
workings. But there is more scope in Pups’
virgin areas.

The initial crushing from Bribbaree
(N.S.W.) gave 2oz. to the ton from 180
tons treated, inclusive of 30 tons of
poor quality stuff left by the pros-
pectors. Shareholders would feel much
better if the 180 tons had been broken
in the ordinary course of current develop-
ment ; actually it w r as the result of .18
months’ accumulation. The appearance of
the first annual balance-sheet synchronised
With the crushing return. The document
show’s that the co. lost £895 for the term,
and ow’es £503. Subscribed capital is
£15.625, including £7500 in 30,000 ss. ven-
dor’s shares. The remaining £8125 is repre-
sented by 50,000 eontribs on which 3s. 3d.
per share has been called up.
* * * #
Yet another postponement is heralded be-
fore Takuapa Valley, Western Siam, com-
mences dredging. On the occasion of the
boost and sudden drop in share values early
in October, a “Wild Cat” par doubted
whether the co. would be able to accomplish
its kick off early in December, the amended,
date then given. Later cables announce that
“the dredge w’ill not commence operations
until the end of January at the earliest.”
This time, the “principal” causes are: (1)
Phenomenal floods: (2) non-arrival of im-
portant parts of the dredge: and (3) short-
age of skilled labor. The previous hold up
was caused by a heavy flood in the Takuapa
River. :

Shareholders in Crown, Mudgee (N.S.W.),
will extract few crumbs of comfort from the
mine manager’s bulletin dated Nov. 22. No
wonder shares fell below Is. 3d. when it was
posted. He says that “110 tons were crushed
on two shifts at the battery. It was a short
w’eek ow’ing to the accountant’s funeral on
Monday. Amalgam collected was 19oz. This
seems poor, but the dies, which are practi-
cally w r orn out, are very low in the boxes,
and the bulk of amalgam may be there. A
30ft. face of ore is being worked at North
section, No. 4 shaft, which prospects fairly
well. No word about the motor for dam
pump yet. We are waiting for same to en-
able us to crush three shifts.” How came
worn-out dies to be installed? What did the
battery contractor at the first annual meeting
tell shareholders as to the quality of the
plant? Who prompted the official report six
weeks ago that three shifts at the battery
was the actual state of affairs?
* * *- - *
Peak, Cobar (N.S.W.), has raised 30 tons
from the 226 ft. level of the north drive on
the west lode, a grab sample assaying loz.
lldwt. gold and 4oz. silver to the ton. De-
velopment work continues on a 4ft. 6in. body,
and assay values in gold are given as loz.
Bdwt. In other parts of the show prospecting
has not revealed anything above 6dwt.

During the tail-end of the 18th century
Michael Nowland became acquainted with
The veteran

who, at 76, has
tackled the Vic.
portfolios of Lands
and Immigration.
Admiral King in
the East Indies,
and when King
landed the snug
job of Governor of
N.S.W. his old
shipmate was
found the good
possie of superin-
tendent of convicts,
first at Parra-
matta and after at
Castle Hill. Now-
land became an
early expert in
wool-culture at Wil-
berforce, on the
Hawkesbury, where
the other day his
grand - daughter,
Sarah Lumley, died,
aged 98.
Allan, Vic.’s new Premier, was a fair
cricketer in the days of his youth, and figured
in country v. town matches. At 58 he still
plays in Parliamentary contests. In a 66
yards’ race he could give Alec Peacock, who
rs 63, 16 yards and beat him. Allan saw
the finish of the match England v. Vic. on
the M.C.C. ground the other day, and shared
all the thrills of the last five minutes. He
was all Victorian native then. It was only
when he caught sight of a haggis at a Cale-
donian feast that he claimed to be a Scot —•
by descent.
o Had he lived Ross Smith would have been
to-day (Dec. 4). He was two years
younger than his brother Keith.
Digger Slater, Labor M.L.A. for Dundas
t> IC '.i ’ w * lo was Attorney-General in
i rendergast’s Government, will be elected
chief president of Vic. A.N.A., at the annual
conference to be opened at Ballarat on St.
fats Day next year. He will be the first
M.P. since 1911-12 to get the top job.
I ellow-worker Lemmon. M.L.A. for Wil-
liamstown, was chief president in 1911-12,
and is still a director.
Allan, the new Vic. Premier, will draw
±l4oo a year, or £lOO more than Alec
1 eacock. The other six salaried members of
the team (Argyle, Eggleston, Downward,
Bourchier and Richardson) will get
r-Jh lu,., 0110 * 1 ' The tota l appropriation is
±lO,OOO. Prendergast’s division of the spoil
was £1551 for himself and £1207 each for
the other seven.
The Rev. Father Bourjade, who died at
Vine Island, New Guinea, last month, was
the fourth-greatest aviator of France during
the war. He had 28 German machines to
his credit, and with these the Croix de Guerre
and bars and the Legion of Honor (he was
the youngest officer to hold the latter). A
member of the R.C. Mission at Papua, which
he joined in November, 1921, his work in
the arts of peace was as sound as in the
game of war. Blackwater fever took the toll.
“The Deacon”: Something like a record
has been put up by Mother de Sales Dooley,
who has been
60 years in
charge of the
Convent of
Mercy at La-
trobe (Tas.).
She left Ireland
with two other
nuns, and set-

Maoriland. yachtsmen will miss departed
Governor-General Jellicoe most of all. In-
stead of setting a new and expensive stand-
ard for the sport with an ornate steam yacht
or a 100-ton schooner, Jellicoe started right
away by building a dainty little 14-footer;
and what was better, in the races which
were enthusiastically launched for that class
of boat-, he took the tiller of the pocket Iron
Duke himself. There is not much comfort
in sailing small craft on the open stretches
of Auckland harbor or in the crazy willy-
wahs of Wellington, but the Admiral stuck
to his first fancy, and 14-footer racing is now
the most popular pastime on M.L. waters.
A delicate soul went out on the west wind
lately when George Wilkinson Kershaw left
his beloved roses. A nurseryman with his
heart in his job, he had cultivated his pet
flowers in the northern suburbs of Sydney
for 39 years, and no man understood their
whims better.
John Stuart Scott, who steps up to deputy-
governor James Kell’s job in the Common-
wealth Bank, is a Victorian, born in Ararat
in 1873. lie has seen service in every State
in the Commonwealth, and also had a term
abroad. Kell, of course, succeeds the late
Denison Miller as governor.
At Peacock’s suggestion Governor Stanley,
in 1918, gave a commission to Lawson to form
a Cabinet. Under pressure from the Bow-
sers, including McPherson, Lawson kept
Peacock &ut of the Ministry for two years
and eight months. As some sort of repara-
tion Lawson handed over the Premiership to
Peacock seven months ago, when the Liberal
party was moribund. More generous towards
friends, and less mindful of political conse-
quences, Peacock, as soon as he got a deputy-
commission to pick six (including himself)
for a Composite Ministry, offered Lawson
and McPherson the two best jobs. They
declined to go into the team, and Peacock
then turned to Argyle and Eggleston.
“0. McKay M.”: Verily youth is being
served nowadays in the distribution of cov-
eted University jobs. Dr. Hunter, Sydney’s
brilliant anatomist of 24. was the first of the
early blooming crop. Then Keith Hancock,
at 25. was made Professor of History at
Adelaide; and S. C. Lazarus, who was at
Trinity (Melbourne) and Balliol (Oxford)
with him, achieved his P’h.D. and a senior
lectureship in Melbourne Uni. _ Ken Bailey,
another Rhodes scholar and Balliol man, and
scarcely a year older than the other two,
has recently stepped into the vice-mastership
of Queen’s within the University of Mel-
bourne ; and now philosopher Fisher, lately
of Queen’s and the London School of Econo-
mics, has been appointed professor at Otago
(M.L.). Prof. Copeland, who relinquished
the Chair of Economics in Tasmania to in-
augurate Melbourne’s course in commerce, is
only 80, and he’s a sage of five years’ profes-
sorial standing. And Alex. Boyce Gibson,
son of Melbourne’s Prof, of Philosophy, has
appropriated to himself a lectureship in logic
at Glasgow.
R. H. (Hughie) McLeod did not long sur-
vive his defeat for Daylesford (Vic.). When
his dad, the venerable Donald, died last year
the son sat in the vacant Daylesford seat, after
beating McDonald (Labor) on a recount.
McDonald got even when the dissolution
occurred and the Assembly electors had an-
other say. McLeod had lived every hour of his
61 years—as a devil-may-care lad at Scotch
Col., as undergrad, at the Uni., as Uni.
coach or Technical College tutor, as inky-
wayfarer in two or three States, as man-
about-town, as legislator and lobbyist. He
had his ups and down, but was an optimist to
the end.
Samuel Seccombe Dingle, who died last
week at Marrickville, was one of the best
known and most popular landsmen on the
Sydney waterfront. A graduate of Cam-
bridge, he was intended for the Church, but
the pulpit had no appeal for him, and he
came to Australia when he was 23. He was
the second son of an old Cornish family with
an estate, North Darley, which has known
no name but Dingle for nearly 500 years.
S. S. Dingle fell heir to this small property a
few months ago when liis elder brother, Dar-
ley, died from injuries received while serving
in the Great War with the Yeomanry, “S.S.’s”
son, Geoffrey, who served with the Light
Horse in Palestine, will not go to England
to take over the small estate, but will stay
here to look after the Argyle Bond which
his father had owned since 1904.
“Cartot”: .T. P. Smith, who died at
Bathurst (N.S.W.) a few days ago, at 92,
was probably the oldest bagman in the State,
having started on his first round for
McArthur and Co. nearly 70 years ago. His
earliest beat was in the Northern districts
of N. S. Wales, at the time when Thunder-
bolt was operating there. Smith scorned to
take precautions to avoid the highwayman,
trusting to the professional smoothness of
his tongue. In due course he encountered
Thunderbolt on a lonely country road,
and was ordered to stand and de-
liver. Instead, Smith began to temporise,
and in a short time his soft and persuasive
member had changed the bushranger’s threats
to protestations of undying friendship, the
two eventually parting on the best of terms.
Born in London, Smith was one of the mil-
lion who booked and then cancelled their
passages by the Dunbar, bound for Sydney
and tbe fatal Gap.
Allan is the first of the 29 Vic. Premiers
to have a name beginning with the initial let-
ter of the alphabet. The Vic. Uppah Cham-
bah once went to the other extreme and
elected Zeal President. At present that
Plouse has an Austin and a Zwar among its
members.
Martin McGregor, one of the Uppah
Chambah honoraries in Vic.’s Compo. Minis-
try, told a crowd the other day that the first
he knew of his inclusion in the team was
when he saw his name and photo in the
papers. It was true. Peacock took the
risk of nominating him without his consent,
and McGregor stood by him and turned up
at the appointed time to be branded. Years
ago he was in a branch of the Chief Sec.’s
Department, and retired on a pension ; but
he cannot draw the pension while he is an
M.P. Toutcher, M.L.A., is in the same boat.
The monument to S. J. Way, formerly
Chief Justice of S.A. for nearly 40 years,
and Chancellor of Adelaide University, has
been unveiled by George Murray, who suc-
ceeded him in both offices. It stands in a
garden strip on North Terrace, just outside
the ’Varsity fence. The bronze has been made
by sculptor Alfred Drury, who also did the
Thomas Elder close by and the C. C. King-
ston in Victoria-square. It was paid for
nine years ago by a syndicate of 16, exactly
half of whom—E. T. Smith, Barr Smith,
Richard Smith, Peter Waite, John Lewis,
Charles Goode, T. R. Scarfe and A. M.
Simpson—did not live to see it. But the
statue is a poor portrait of the little man
whom ’Varsity students loved to heckle.
The addition of the spectacles which he in-
variably wore might improve the likeness.
“J. Drayman”: An alderman who admitted
having accepted a present from a man he had
helped also told the Sydney Tammany Com-
mission that “Cropley almost lived at the
Town Hall, and was looked upon as a Fisher’s
ghost by the officials.” It must be nearly
half a century since Fisher’s ghost walked
at Nunawading (Vic.) ; and until the pre-
sent it must be years since it got into print.
Even now, unless some sheet revives tbe
story of the gifted Nunawading woodcarter
who posed as a dinkum Messiah and had
visions and held strange religious revels with
wood-nymphs at full moon amid the
ti-tree glades of Dandenong Creek, Fisher’s
ghost seems likely to fade out altogether, even
from the language of legend. That the
phrase is already sub-editorially considered
meaningless to the multitude is shown by the
tact that nearly every metropolitan news-
paper m Australia printed the Sydney alder-
man s remarks about Cropley without giving
letter'' IS^er or Sh° st a capital initial
An old-time skald of the backblocks of
Aor them Victoria passed out at the Bal-
larat Benevolent Asylum when William Vic-
tor Arnold died the other day. Twenty or
more years ago he
was a prolific writer
of verse and songs
on local events. Ho
never aspired to
print, being con-
tent with such local
audiences as could
be obtained al
farmhouse dances
and in pub bars. It
was said he was
the black sheep of
an aristocratic Eng-
lish family.
PHIL FINKEL-
STEIN, the gen-
eral manager of
publicity for J.C.
Williamson, Ltd.
The most silent of W. F. Massey’s hench-
men in the M.L. House of Reps, is George
Hunter, member for Waipawa, whose reti-
cence indoors, however, hides a lot of activity
outside. Hunter was born in Wellington in
1859, and is a son of the Tempestuous City’s
first Mayor. He is one of the solidest of
Maoriland’s squattocracy, and a gift of
£30,000 worth of land for soldier settlement
earned him his title, and still left him with
enough land to swing a cat in. In fact, a
telescope is required to see the front door
from the back gate on his fine property bor-
dering on the Hawkes Bay coast, where he
breeds long-haired sheep and long-winded
racehorses. He exchanged bachelorhood for
the other thing in 1923.
On his third try for Parliament A. W.
Foster, a Victorian barrister, hopes to win
Fawkner at next Federal elections. Foster was
born at Beechworth, where the Fosters were
amongst the earliest inhabitants. As a stu-
dent lie was the Supreme Court Prize-winner
in 1908. He has been interested in Labor
politics all his life, and is a member of the
Central Executive; and he is also president
of the Vic. Rationalists’ Association. In his
one sport, tennis, he represented the Univer-
sity and, later on, Victoria in inter-State
competitions.
“E.D.”: Organist Peake’s record (B.
20/11/’24) was beaten by the late Charles
Eyres, of Lydiard-street Methodist Church,
Ballarat. A tablet erected to his memory
by choristers and admirers states that he
was organist and choirmaster from 1865 to
1913—48 years. He saw the first “kist o’
pipes” supplanted in 1890 by a three-decker
pneumatic machine, which has only this year
been re-built with latest accessory ideas. A
banker by trade, he wanted to see his 50
years out, but the management thought other-
wise, and this helped to break him up.
Francis Edward Bloxham, who crossed the
bar at Bondi (N.S.W.) the other day, was
the penologist who introduced the single-cell
system to Goulburn Gaol, into the governor-
ship of which he entered without any practi-
cal knowledge of prison work. It was on the
great man-control displayed by him during
five years’ secretaryship of the Government
Labor Bureau, which at his instance had been
established in 1892, that he obtained the job.
Later he introduced electric light and the
single-cell system into Parramatta, the
State’s greatest gaol, where the smooth
running of the new idea was for a long while
dangerously obstructed by “the birds” who
wanted to flock together.
A. E. Fryar, manager of the land depart-
ment of , Elder-Smith’s, has burst into
flame in Adelaide through winning, among
other prizes, the championship gold medal at
the Australian and Maoriland Philatelic Con-
gress and Exhibition at Christchurch (M.L.).
Fryar has been an enthusiastic collector for
20 years, and once held the presidency of the
local Philatelic Society. His exhibition col-
lection numbered 1237 examples, but he owns
four times that number of rarities. The
most valuable is a fourpenny ultramarine
error of 1879, catalogued in London at £250
—there are only six other specimens of the
freak known ; King George has one, and an-
other is in the British Museum. Fryar’s
two sons have also got the habit, and they
both won prizes at the M.L. exhibition.
An old lady who died in Collingwood
(Vic.) recently made arrangements with a
local undertaker 15 years ago for her funeral,
and paid him there and then. She had a
premonition that the Cost of Dying would
go up.
THE LUCK OF THEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The teachers of this State are the best-paid in
Australia, if not in the world.” —Premier Fuller.
lie sinks no more, the dominie,
His teeth in hash and hominy ;
As Premier Fuller’s nominee
He ambles on the stage
To demonstrate that nary a
Co-craftsman in the area
’Twixt Bass and Carpentaria
Commands so good a wage.
The cop in language tropical,
Or pungent phrase and topical,
May rate as microscopical
11 is monthly quid pro quo;
But he who shows utility
Instructing juvenility
Beyond all possibility
Should with contentment glow.
The curate, worked excessively,
May bear his cross repressively;
The fact’ry hand aggressively
Demand a fairer log.
Most men, whate’er their status is,
Find in their wads hiatuses,
The one Prince Fortunatus is,
’Twould seem, the pedagogue.
And what an added bliss it is,
Now Fuller so explicit is.
To know your own felicities,
Mentorial brigade!
When worried incidentally,
Or criticised parentally,
It ought to brace you mentally
To muse how well you’re paid !

“Ain’t little Jimmy clever. Missus Johnson? He made
that, motor all by ’imself. And the funny part "
of it is that none of my other children ain’t a bit
of good at makin’ things.”
“Well, Missus Simpson, some is adopted for one thing
and some is adopted for another.”
“G.D.P.” : Somebody recently claimed for
the Spaniard a proficiency in all matters relating to
horse; which reminds me of a Portuguese I once saw
whose methods were all his own. It was at an
Australian veterinary hospital outside Calais, during
the latter stages of the war, and we were dipping
about 200 head of horses and mules, an unenviable job
in midwinter. The animals were led up the race
into the crush, and from there persuaded into the
dip by means of a breeching and, when necessary, a
stockwhip. After we had put through most of
our quota, a party of Portuguese from a near-by
camp arrived with horses to be dipped, and two
of them were put on the breeching to relieve a
couple of our chaps. One enterprising Dago, evi-
dently thinking the job of affixing the breeching far
too slow, dropped his end, spat out his cigarette,
climbed through the rails into the crush, and
flattened himself against the far end of it. When
the next horse emerged, Pedro quick as lightning
dived his head between the animal’s hind legs and
pushed as if he were in a football scrum. The
neddv, thinking Beelzebub had been let loose with a
battering ram, gave a snort and made a flying leap
into the dip. A dozen were put through in the
same way with extraordinary rapidity. But with
the thirteenth came disaster. A sandy-colored mule
flashed into the crush, and poor Pedro let him get
too far in before applying his method of persuasion.
He was bunched up and had taken one step when he
got it. His skull cracked like a melon.

“Cartot”: Is the race of shearers dying
out ? This year a number of sheds in Western N. 8.
Wales have had to delay the roll-call simply through
inability to obtain the men needed. Before the era.
of higli wages in Australia, city and country youths
were eager to learn the art of sheep-barbering'. The
cheques they knocked up more than compensated for
the back-breaking toil. In those days the shearer
was a plutocrat amongst wage-earners and an
aristocrat amongst workers, and there was
always a steady stream of recruits to his ranks.
Nowadays unskilled laborers can earn big money
without leaving the bright lights of city picture-
shows and the pleasures of suburban racecourses.
This explains why one sees only middle-aged and
elderly men on the board. At one far western sta-
tion in N. S. Wales last season, out of 12 shearers
five were wearing grey beards, and the other -seven
were all over 40.
* *• *
“C.M.”: Re “Pick’s” 110-gtiinea collie
which turned out a dud as a sheepdog (B. 23/10/’24).
Was he bought as a working collie or merely for the
show-ring? I suspect the latter, in which case his
behavior at his owner’s station is not surprising.
In Scotland, the home of the breed, the ornamental
show-dog is often useless as a worker. It is almost
universally the case at the big Sydney and Melbourne
shows, where beautiful animals with pedigrees as
long as. a girl’s pigtail of yesteryear would shy at
a sheep if they met one. At Scottish shows there
is a difference in the two standards. In the working
collie the head and ears are of minor importance.
In the purely show-dog they are the first things the
judge looks at.
* * * *
“E. Debro”: I was in Yunamindera
(W.A.) during the winter of ’99 working on a show
that was prospected by Jack Agnew, later 8., M.
and Co.’s big gun. My mate, after
changing into a pair of pants
that had hung in the bough-shed
for some weeks, complained of
two stings, one in the right groin
and another inside the right leg
above the knee. Examination
showed a web and a crushed red-
back spider. No time, "was lost
getting; my pal in to Dr. Schneider,
a well-known North-East Cool-
gardie identity, who did every-
thing possible with the drugs
available, but without much bene-
fit to the patient, who within 48
hours was running a high tem-
perature. Next day he was so
bad that he had to be strapped
down and carted to Menzies
Hospital, where all efforts to, save
his life were unavailing. He died
within a week of being bitten.
Three? years later, at Burtville, in
the same district, I had been, sub-
sequent to a good crushing, enter-
taining some, friends. For a nap
table a long empty beer-case was
placed on one bed, while the
other bed provided seats. After
playing for some hours the box
was removed, and I lay dowm all
standing on the bed. On waking
in the morning I found a lump
over my right eye as large as a
good-sized egg, together with two
small protuberances on one cheek-
bene. There was a squashed
‘Teddy” with four piccaninnies
(also deceased) on the quilt. After
a couple of stiff wads 1 rode my
bike into Laverton Hospital, where
I was treated with injections and
discharged at the . end of a week.
For some time subsequently I used
to experience severe shooting pains
where. the lump had been ; the}'
would last for an hour or two at
a time. The native cure rfor
redback-bites was similar to that
for snake-bite—application of the
business end of a burning stick of
mulga.
■‘Centurion”: “Wewak’s” bows five to six
feet long (B. 30/10/’24) would be handed to the
kids to play with in the West of the Gulf of Papua,
where the weapons run to seven or eight feet of
steel-like bamboo, matured and smoke-seasoned, and
2in. broad at the grip. These bows are split out
of the giant bamboo, and a novice, however strong,
finds it the Devil’s own job to half-bend one, let
alone shoot with it. The Gulf Papuan lays'his whole
body into the pull, and consequently the shooting- is
not so accurate as a Lee-Enfield’s. The bow is
strung with a strip of rattan, and the war arrows
are usually bone-headed or barbed. Wooden heads
are used for fishing arrows. In a turn-up which
William Macgregor’s police had with these Western
bowmen leng ago, one of the arrows went half
its length through a whaleboat rudder an inch
thick; and when the Goaribari natives attacked the
Merrie England in 1905, a lot of their arrows pene-
trated the teak panels of her deckhouses. In other
parts of Papua inland tribes use a much shorter and
more easily manipulated bow.
HYPERSEXSITI VE.
MAGISTRATE: “Why didn’t you call the police when he started knocking you about?”
THE DAMAGED ONE: “Oh, sir, I 'adn't the ’cart to. Me ’usband’s such a sensitive bloke.”
“Nulla” : Apparently it is the politicians
who are warrigal’s friends in N. S. Wales and
Queensland; but in , the far sou’-western (Bight)
country of South Aus. the allies are dingoes and
wombats. The latter are very prevalent, and have
habit of starting a burrow either outside a fence
and emerging a long way inside it, or vice versa.
The holes are usually large enough for a man to
crawl in, and warrigal has the easiest of jobs walk-
ing through, and thus in a manner puts his fingers
to his nose at the best of dog-proof fences.
Measures are being taken to deal with the under-
ground porker, and he is being poisoned wholesale by
burrow fumigation.
* * * *
“Saridys”: I have a pair of wedgetail
eagles on my walls, and they go 9ft. -tin. and Bft.
oin. respectively. No, I didn’t shoot them. I was
out with a friend one day, and we watched for over an
hour the antics of the pair, who appeared to have
had a drop too much. Just about sundown they
fell, and we landed home each carrying a dormant
but terribly fierce-eyed eagle. It was midnight
before they died, and if looks could kill we ought to
have pegged too. I shiver yet when I think of the
way those birds cursed us. After the post mortem
we found a verdict of poisoned rabbit.
“Saaedi”: Is the rabbit learning to live
without water? Years ago poisoned water was an
exceedingly effective method of rabbit extermination,
but now, even when conditions are apparently quite
favorable; the number destroyed in this manner is
usually disappointing. Again, rabbits appear nowa-
days to be able to exist for an indefinite period in
netted paddocks devoid of both grass and water. It
has been suggested that in such cases bunny burrows
for moisture, but close observation has convinced me
that this isn’t so.
* ■x- * *
“Sylvester”: A reptile inhabits S.-E.
Queensland that I would like some information about.
It grows to about 2ft. in length, but most specimens
I have captured were from 9in. to a foot from stem
to stern. The back is-a dirty black; it has a
yellowy-white belly and a bright yellow band about
half an inch wide around the neck. It has apologies
for legs; in a.foot-long specimen these legs are about
Jin. in length. The ends of the legs are marked as
if Nature had intended to add toes, but, finding
there was no room, had left off. When the creature
crawls the legs are moved to and fro, but so far as
I can see thev do not touch the ground at all.
* ' * * *
“Two Seas” : The domestic affairs of that
pair of magpies which started housekeeping in my
front garden ended in tragedy. When their triplets
were only half fledged, some murdering hound with
a pea-rifle—the breed that would blow the tail
feathers off an archangel if they saw one roosting
on a fence—potted the head of the family when
he was gathering caterpillars for his young brood.
Two days later I found one of the youngsters dead
on the garden path beneath the nest. The following
day another one was sitting on the ground squalling
lustily every time its mother alighted on the nest
above with a titbit for its sole occupant. But the
mother took no notice of the homeless fledgling.
It dawned upon me then that she had pushed two
of her family overboard because the task of feeding
three was too much for her. I feel sure of this,
because last year, when a schoolboy captured the
youngsters and put them in a cage, the parent
birds continued to feed them. I never realised the
number of caterpillars a pair of magpies collect
until I started to feed the-, evicted • infant. ; I had to
cover a radius of 300 yards to gather a feed, whereas,
before this brood hatched, the paddock and
garden swarmed with the hairy crawlers. By the
way, “Lukie” (B. 23/10/’24), referring to the vicious
attacks made by magpies upon anyone near their
nest, inquires “Why do these birds make a distinction
between man and woman?” They don’t. Although
my magpies have nested two years in our garden, and
were fed by us in the winter, they have taken
samples of skin and hair from every female member
of the family during the nesting season.
“Vanikoro” : As soon as lie has a chance,
Lieutenant Chinnery, the recently appointed anthro-
pologist of the New Guinea territory, is going to
overhaul part of the practically unknown hill country
in the south of New Britain. It has lately been
reported that sonic of the bush tribes in those parts
use the blowpipe. As Borneo is the nearest place
where this curious and highly specialised weapon
is known to be used, this fact, if it proves to he
a fact, will be of absorbing interest to anthropo-
logists. Incidentally, it is curious that the distri-
bution of the blowpipe concurs with that of the
tapir. Both arc found in two areas only, one in
the tropics of eastern South America and the
other in .Malaysia.
* * * *
“Country Pod" : Why all this fuss about
the chameleon’s power of changing color according
to environment? The ordinary frog found in the
garden can do it. Under a bag or a piece of wood
the little chap is a dark brown, almost black. Amongst
the green grass he matches its bright color. Placed
on a hardwood floor, he becomes grey. There is a
well-authenticated story of an artist painting a
frog that was gTeen with stripes of gold to mat< h
the shafts of sunlight streaking through his reedy
home. The artist left his sitter for a minute, and
on his return had to begin a long search for the
amphibian. It was found at last under the artist's
chair, having taken the color of the floor. This
ability to change color is the frog’s mode of pro-
tection from its enemies, the wading birds and
the snakes.
MALIGNING THE BEAST.
THE BITTEN ONE: “Blarst the cur!”
THE OWNER: "Nonsense! 'E wouldn' bite
yer! Must have bin a flea off ’is back."
“A.P.”: The queer accidents didn’t all
happen in Gran’pa’s day. A man working on the
Maroondah (Vic.) dam a few days ago fell into the
water, and the flow carried him a couple of hundred
feet through a pipe about four feet in diameter.
Luckily, there were no closed valves to impede hi'
progress, and he shot through to safety without any
physical injury.

THE FITZROY DIGGINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Gold has been discovered in Fitzroy, on the
property of Mr. Goon, a Chinese herbalist. Mr.
Goon has applied for a mining lease.”
With the gold-bug I’ve been bitten, an" niv heart
is filled with joy
Since I read these glorious tidin’s in th’ Sun.
Sc I’m packin’ my belongin’s an’ I’m makin’ for
Fitzroy,
With my dish an’ pick an’ shovel, an’ my gun.
I gave ’arf a minute’s notice to the cocky where 1
work,
An’ I told ’im I was leavin’ his employ;
Now I’m ’eadin’ for th’ goldfields from beyond th’
back o’ Bourlce,
I am makin’ for th’ goldfields of Fitzroy.
I’ll be strollin’ up th’ Narrows with my loam-bag on
my back;
Little Hanover I’ll prospect very soon;
I’ll be dollyin’ in Young-street, till I get upon the
track
Of the golden lode first happened on by Goon.
With the luck of the Celestial, Mister Goon should
be the chap
To excavate the glittering ounces troy
That have lain for generations in a crowded city’s
lap,
For no one thought of digging in Fitzroy.
So I’m makin’ down to-morrow—not another day
I’ll waste
Ere I dump Matilda down and peg my claim ;
Once again th’ joy of diggin’ for th’ yeller stuff
I’ll taste,
For I ain’t a bloomin’ novice at th’ game.
So, then, ’ow erbout it, cobber? Let me put it to
yer straight:
Will yer pack yer traps, an’ come along, old boy?
I am startin’ in th’ mornin’, an’ I’d like yer for a
mate
When I’m ’eadin’ for th’ diggin’s at Fitzroy.

emus which did up to 30 miles per hour must be
miles faster than the emus of my acquaintance.
When the big birds were plentiful in my part of
the country, any good station horse could run up
to one for any distance over a mile.
* * * #
“M. J.D.”: “The Rumpus’s” cut (B.
23/10/’24) was not at all singular. On our farm
at I.aidley (S.Q.) we had an old tabby who, having
heard the buckets, was always waiting at the
bails when the boys arrived. There she mewed per-
sistently until rewarded with a stream direct from
the teat. It was amusing for the first second or two
to see her blinking as she got it in the eyes and
face, but once she found her bearings she was right.
Distance didn’t matter as long as the stream was
kept steady. [Half the farm cats in Australia seem
to get their milk direct from Strawberry. At least
two score of letters report experiences similar to
the above.— Chief Abo.-liak.]
* * * *
“Wart”: “Lily-Beale” (B. 6/11/’24) says
that the nardoo is the best bush compass and chrono-
meter. At dawn the leaves are lying on the ground,
facing the east, and as the day progresses they
gradually rise. At midday they are perpendicular,
A GLIMPSE OF THE OBVIOUS.
“Come in, old man. Sorry the wife's away."
“Oh, don't mention it!”
and at sundown they are on the ground facing west.
I intend to plant a few in the garden; but before
pensioning off my old Waterbury I would like to
know how the leaves get back to the east before
dawn? Does one have to get out of bed to do it?
“Ctesar”: ‘‘FY7” cites the somersaulting
of a motor-car with no injury to the occupants as a
queer accident which wouldn’t be likely to happen
twice (B. C/11/’24). Well, the same thing happened
in Esk (Q.) about two months ago almost to a detail.
In this case the driver swerved to avoid a horse.
The car over-balanced sideways, and, turning com-
pletely over, got on to its wheels again. The hood
was up, as in “FYT’s” case, and beyond a few minor
dents to Liz and a shaking for the two passengers no
damage was done.
“Troophorse”: Tell “Pfella” (B. 30/10/’241
that Binghi in his wild state, so far as I have made
his acquaintance, never takes a hand in the cere-
mony unless there be any difficulty in childbirth,
then he will enter the women’s camp armed with
his hair-belt, made generally from human hair, and
tie it tightly round the woman’s body, just under
the breasts. During the ceremony not a word is
spoken. If this ruse fails the husband will walk
slowly away from the camp with a view of inducing
the unborn child to follow him, which, it is said,
it rarely fails to do.
“SAY, MISTER, ARE YOU DOIN’ THAT FOR THE
PICTURES?”
“Wai-lioi”: How does “Troophorse” (15.
16/10/’24) get at his yarn about the old bossed-out
bull-buffaloes of the N.T. making for the Queensland
side while the elderly ladies go towards the sinking
sun? Old buffalo-bulls were seen in the country
immediately to the east of Cambridge Gulf (W.A.)
in 1910. Plenty of men round about Kimberley
have had a crack at bull-buffs on the W.A.- side of
the Territory, and well into and in Kimberley, too.
* ’ * * #
“FY7”: It is hardly fair for “Two Seas”
(B. 30/10/’24) to call collies treacherous because
he has been bitten while trying to let specimens of
the breed out of a dingo-trap. The meekest of
animals is apt to see red when nipped in a powerful
dog-trap, Homo sapiens not excepted. It is a
lunatic act, anyhow, to try to liberate a trapped
animal without first stunning it or rendering it
helpless with a bag or saddlecloth.
* * * #
“Tarago” : It was during the interval be-
tween the barn dance and the Alberts that a number
of gents, sat mopping their necks on the stage at one
end of the hall. “Hey, Bill,” said one, “Jever try
ter tear a silk handkerchief with a steady pull like
this?” He illustrated by holding the handkerchief
by the corners and
pulling hard. Bill
took the “silk stook”
and tried, then tossed
it back to the owner
with the remark: “I
don’t want ter tear yer
handkerchief.” “Go
on,” urged the other,
“betcher can't; steady
pull, mind—no jerks.”
Bill took up the chal-
lenge, and seizing the
handkerchief between
hands like hams, put
weight into it. With
a rip that made the
ladies look around with
appi’ehension, the silk
parted from end to end.
“There y’are,” he said
ruefully, “told yer I
didn’t want ter spoil
it.” The other laughed.
“Tain’t mine,” he
roared—“l jest took it
from yer pocket.” Bill
looked at the two
halves. “Huh,” he said,
“that’s the . one I
pinched from you ther
last dance.”
“Boronia”: I doubt if there is a timber
that can shrink more than Westralian jarrah. Its
initial shrinkage is considerable; and even aftei
years have elapsed, the planing of the surface is
sufficient to bring about a further decrease of measure-
ment.. For 6in. jarrah boards to shrink down to
less than sin. is common. This accounts for the
fact that those who know their timber will wait
a couple of years before permanently nailing down
new floors. Recently two jarrah boards which had
formed a shelf in a cupboard for over 30 years were
taken out. The edges were well planed, and they
were carefully fitted together again. In less than
a fortnight a sixpenny-piece could be inserted in
the joint. P.S. —Do you think it would be any use
inoculating the National Debt with jarrah juice?
“Fordson”: Will the Council please give
its opinion of which has the greater advantages, the
disc-plough or the mouldboard? In my opinion the
disc beats the other, but I know many mouldboard
enthusiasts who, though some of them are using
discs, still prefer the other.
“Y.E.”: It is not always safe to thrust
an arm or hand into birds’ nests, is it may happen
that there is a snake coiled up inside, the black snake
in particular being a keen hunter after eggs and
nestlings. Writer has always felt a creepy sensation
when exploring the
deep and very dimly
lighted hollow's of lyre-
birds’ nests, and also
with regard to the ex-
cavations (about lBin.
deep) of the blue or
azure kingfisher, which
tunnels into banks.
Either may well serve
brother black snake for
a siesta, and he is
always careful to leave
his business end point-
ing outwards, ready for
immediate offensive or
defensive operations.
Flinders, when explor-
ing the islands in Bass
Straits, and short of
food supplies, trusted
much to the mutton-
birds (short-tailed pet-
rel) which breed there
annually in immense
numbers. According to
his account it was only
necessary to thrust the
whole length of the arm
into the nesting holes
and bring out either a
mutton-bird or a snake.
The reckless sailors
willingly took the risk.
The black snake being
an able swimmer and
quite at home in salt-
water, could easily have got across from the mainland.
Two tiger-snakes (mating possibly) have been iound
coiled in the nest of a kangaroo-rat.
« * * *
‘‘Black Bonnet”: The nutmeg pigeon, one
of the most beautiful of the many beautiful pigeons
of the North, is “in.” That is to say, the birds have
arrived at the islands off the North Queensland coast
for their breeding season. They nest on the islands
in companies, and fly over to the mainland daily to
feed on the wild fruit in the scrubs. Although pro-
tected, the birds are shot quite openly—they are
excellent eating—and the man who shoots one or
two for the pot can hardly be blamed. It is the
self-styled sportsmen who bang away all day long
and boast of their bags that require pulling up.
It is common talk in the coastal towns that boats
still go to the islands (Japanese boats are mentioned,
too) and massacre the pigeons in hundreds at their
nesting-places. It is safe to say that if this killing
goes on the nutmeg pigeon will become as extinct
as the Dodo before many years have passed; they
plainly decrease sadly from year to year. Gould
it not be arranged to establish a real Protector of
wild birds in the North, who would visit or even
stay on the islands —Hope, Low, W oody and others
in the breeding season, and put a stop to the slaugh-
ter of the innocents that has been going on for years,
and which most certainly will not be stopped by
anv unenforced law ?
" * * * *
“W.P.T.”: “Verri” has struck a miracle
(B. 4 /9/’24) in the girl who can hatch freak fowls
from double-yolked eggs. Double-yolked eggs, whether
the fruit of hens, ducks or any other bird, are never
fertile; and if set under a hen she will recognise
them and push them out of the nest. Hens don't
set on eggs for fun.
* * * *
“Mephisto”: Concerning “Overlander’s”
inquiry (B. 30/10/’24) about the safety of motor-
cars and their occupants during a thunderstorm, it
would be as well to understand just what lightning
is and why it strikes. Before a storm a good deal
of static electricity is generated, and it accumulates
mostly in the clouds. It has several causes, the chief
being the condensation of the water vapor in the
atmosphere to form the dense nimbus storm-clouds.
The electricity is of two kinds, positive and nega-
tive, and they attract each other. So when a nega-
tively-charged cloud approaches a positively-charged
one, the pent-up energy is released, and for an in-
stant a great charge of electricity flows from one
cloud to "the other. This gives rise to a brilliant
flash of light and heat. It also tears the air apart,
and the vibration thus caused gives rise to the sound
called thunder. (There is a. theory also that the
fresh smell after a storm is partly caused by the
formation of ozone front the oxygen of the air, which
is really a molecule of oxygen with three oxygen
atoms instead of the usual two.) When the electricity
cannot neutralise itself by discharging to a cloud
oppositely charged, it looks round for the next best
thing, viz., the earth. It likes good conductors —
metal spires, wet trees and so on. For this reason
it will strike a lightning-conductor connected directly
with the ground in preference to a roof connected
to the ground by means of a high resistance —wood-
work, for instance. Now-, a motor-car rests on
rubber tyres, and rubber is one of the worst conduc-
tors of electricity; so such a car is fairly safe. But
if the tyres- are standing in much water, the metal
portion of the car makes it dangerous as a refuge.
“Tarago”: Lightning does not strike at a tree or
other object; it simply uses it as the shortest track
to “earth.” Bill Smith, cited by “Overlander” (B.
30/10/’24), owes his life to the fact that he was
carrying a chain with one end trailing on the
ground. Probably William thinks the chain “at-
tracted” the lightning, but it didn’t. He was on the
direct path of the current, and steel chain is a
better conductor than the human body; so William
got only the seepage of the volt that travelled
through the chain to earth. Had Bill been empty
handed, or the chain off the ground, there would
har e been one Smith less in Australia to-day. It
is certainly dangerous to be near good conductors
during a storm : but, paradoxically, the man who has
a good conductor earthed at the moment he steps
into the track of a thunderbolt generally lives to
tell the tale.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: Sitting last week behind a
boulder, watching for wild ducks to flv down the
Goulburn River (N.S.W.), I spotted a lean fox with
a couple of young ones emerge from a moss-covered
hollow-log. The trio meandered up the bed of the
river, and presently ran into a sow with a litter
of 11 infants. AA'atching her chance, the hungry
vixen pounced upon a sucker. The old sow came
at her, and there was a rough and tumble, in which
the families got badly mixed. After a bit the she
pig got the fox on her back, and rooted and reached
for a stranglehold on the throat. In two minutes it
was all over with the mother fox, and the two little
orphans had reached their lair in the log. The fox
put up a gallant scrap ; but she lacked weight.
* * * #
“Bolem”: Tell “Yardley” (B. G/11/’241
his dog must be tone-deaf. My mere mongrel knows
the sound of our family car and cannot be misled,
on the point, even by the approach of a car of the
same make and class. He is enclosed to such an
extent that he cannot see the car, and judges by
sound only. An even better instance is the local
medico’s dog, which readily distinguishes Sawbones’s
Lizzie from all other hussies of the same make.
Take your dog to the races, and, should McShortodds
offer a decent price about a horse, Towser will hear
it first.
* # * *
“Wai-lioi”: I have just had a run through
the tingle-tingle country between Albany and the
Leeuwin. This giant eucalypt grows only on quite
a narrow strip of country round about the Frankland
River. Sid Jackson, who collects birds’ eggs for
“Belltrees” White, spent some time in the tingle
country, and was the first to collect the flowers of
the monster gum-trees which scientifically are called
after him. Along the road from the Bow River to
the Frankland there are trees which are 60 feet
round at ground level and 200 ft. high ; but these
are youngsters alongside some that grow high up
the Frankland. A chap who has lived in AV.A.'s
forest country for the past 16 years swears that the
butt of one tingle-tree, five miles away from where
the Denmark-road crosses the Frankland, is close up
100 ft. in circumference. Eight men abreast of one
another were not broad enough to hide the trunk
of another of these giants. Tingle-wood is one of
the prettiest grained of AV.A.’s gums and makes tip-
top furniture; but it gives a bit of trouble if it
gets alternately wet and dry, as it swells and shrinks
abnormally. Some of the wood is also badly gum-
veined. All the same, I reckon that one of these
days tingle will become the rage. It’s great to see
tlie big black giants growing among the monster
white kauris and beating them in the race for
Heaven.
THE CONSTANT LOVER.
“Father says he is going to hick you into the
middle of next week.'”
“Righto! Ell see you on Thursday,
then.”
“Mephisto” : Re “Boronia” (B. 30/10/’24 1
and the superstition that lightning does not strike
twice in the same place. There is a dead tree in
the grounds of a Toowoomba (Q.) secondary school
which has been struck twice in two consecutive
Februarys ; and I have much pleasure in destroying
the old fallacy by stating that on each occasion the
lightning struck the same jagged projecting 20ft.

THE LOST EIDERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the Eucumbene’s a silver thread beneath the
starry night
There’s a silence that is broken as a phantom host
takes flight.
You may see the ponies slipping where the ground
is white with frost,
You may hear the phantom voices of the riders that
are lost.
You may hear a ghostly murmur; then the heavy
stockwhips roar
As they breast the trackless ranges that they breasted
once before ;
Ana the echo strikes the gullies where the sleepy
cattle lie
To stampede them through the mountains till the
dreaded host goes by.
Ghosts of rough an 1 unshod brumbies wifs their
red-streaked nostrils vide
Take the creeks that feed Iviandra and the tree-
stumps in their stride ;
And behind them go the ponies in their fleeting
demon ranks,
With the sweat upon their shoulders and the blood
upon their flanks.
Ah, tlie snows have left Iviandra and the hills
are clothed with green,
And you never hear the ponies by the silent Eueum-
. bene!
There are sheep among the ranges where the brumbies
used to feed ;
There are newer, fewer riders, with a “Lizzie” for
their need.
But by night there comes that murmur and a ghostly
coo-ee call;
There’s an echo down the ranges as the stinging
stockwhips fall;
You can hear the drumming thunder of the breed
that would not die.
As the phantom mountain ponies and their riders
gallop by.

Dear Sir, —
It wilt be of interest to you to know that the Model
200 One-Ton Isko Refrigerating Machine which you
supplied to this Hotel in January last is proving an
unqualified success.
It has been in operation now for the past twelve
months, and the Thermostatic control is functioning
perfectly, stopping the machine when the desired
temperature is reached, and re-starting it when the
temperature again rises. The machine carries on
quite automatically, and we have not found it neces-
sary to go near it.
My Chef tells me that he is more than pleased with
the condition of the perishable foodstuffs which the
“ISKO” takes care of, which I attribute to the dry
refrigeration of the “ISKO” as opposed to the cold,
moist air of the old-fashioned ICE Chamber.
Although, as you know, the machine is only about
22 feet from my office, I sometimes do not hear it
running, as it is very silent in operation. To my
mind, this is a most important feature in my busi-
ness.
Believe me.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir, —
In response to your inquiry, I will state that we
purchased our small Isko Refrigerating Machine some
four to five years ago, and it has been working, when
the weather has been at all warm, ever sinee. As you
know, we use this machine for cooling chocolates, and,
as you may also know, we have at all times over-
loaded our Isko; in fact, our work really calls for a
refrigerator of at least one-half-ton capacity. How-
ever, the Isko has served us up to date.
We consider our Isko a wonderful little machine
and would not consider parting with it, except it
be replaced by a much larger capacity machine. We
have never had any trouble whatever with our Isko.
At a later date we hope to make some improvements
in our Chocolate factory, and hope to And use for
your larger model Isko.
Yours truly,

Dear Sir, —
I have much pleasure in statiug that the “ISKO”
Refrigerating Plant you installed for us some months
ago has been working to our uniform and entire satis-
faction.
The machine is clean, noiseless, and so far has
proved 100% efficient, and, moreover, has called for
the minimum of attention on the part of our staff.
We consider it an ideal installation for our busi-
ness, and are highly pleased with our choice of
machine.
Yours faithfully,

Gladys Moncrieff’s reception on Saturday
night in “The Merry Widow” revival should
once and for all rout the persistent delusion
of managers that Australian stars only shine
coldly and by reflected light. The Gallery
in its eagerness unloosed its bombardment
before the zero hour, Gladys being still busy
with her grease-stick, and the play was held
up for some minutes to satisfy their hunger.
The Moncrieff shingle fits the widow's vari-
ous head-coverings far better than her old-
time bobbed locks did. But she gives the
Gallery goddesses something to wonder at
when she balances an enormous picture-hat
on her cosy head with all the confidence of
a woman of Samaria. The chorus provided
the usual ravishing display, and Nellie
Payne looked her best in a short-skirted
dress whose blue rivalled the color of her
eyes. The dress-circle and front stalls over-
flowed with the better-dressed. The Frank
Taits had one 0.-p. box and Charlie Wenman’s
wife another.
Soaking rain failed to frighten away one
infant from the treat which Wirth Brothers
gave to the Sailors and Soldiers’ mothers,
wives and children connected with the two
• friendly unions.” Platoons of kiddies, all
best-dressed and under the wings of anxious-
eyed relations, whooped joyously at the en-
trances fully a couple of hours before the
show opened. Their troubles about pulped
shoe-soles when the Greatest Show on Earth
loomed before them; and none of the young-
sters showed more expectant glee than the
De Chairs’ good-looking flapper-daughter
Elaine and her small brother, who had
dropped in on Melbourne on their way to
join their vice-regal parents in Sydney. The
pair came with the G.-G. and Lady Forster.
Her Ex., as Union patroness, stepped into
the arena half-way through the show to voice
thanks to the Wirth Brothers. Philip Wirth
answered back with a nice simplicity that
he and his brother were in no danger of for-
getting the debt they owed the Anzacs. The
palpitations of the show were agreeably
punctuated by ice-creams and cakes, handed
out by committee women and an army of
helpers.
The well-dressed crowd which gave Gladys
Moncrieff further tribute at His Majesty’s
on the revival of “The Merry Widow” had
the opportunity to show an appreciation of
real stage romance, and duly showed it. Tom
Moore, the popular star's near-new husband,
was billed for a special dance-turn with the
dainty Hazel Meldrum. Hazel came in for
a generous welcome on her arrival as a herald
of the real hero who stole a stage star’s
heart; and when Tom Moore himself ap-
peared the applause poured itself in cascades
from upper circle and d.c.. and rose like a
flood even from the usually less romantic
stalls. A star in his own right could have
asked no more. The tall, rather lanky
young man’s neat footwork, however, earned
him only polite benediction. Evidently the
great heart of the public loves him not so
much for himself as for his distinguished
spouse.
Thirty incapacitated soldiers from Caul-
held Hospital and 500 poor kiddies from the
various institutes helped Lady Stradbrokc
celebrate her birthday by having an after-
noon at Wirtlis’ Circus at her expense. Un-
fortunately the kindly Countess was an-
chored to the bedside of her invalid son
Christopher, and could not be there to see
her guests enjoying themselves; but the Gov
ernor and daughter Helena Rous came, and
were greeted with a chorus of rousing cheers
intended for the vice-regal hostess. Girl
Guides had been called in to gladden the
interval by feeding the guests on tea and
cake.
Westerners overflowed the Collins-street
kirk one day last week to see Fairic Moffatt
and Keith Calvert exchange their tows. Not
even a showery day could dull their cheerful-
ness. The bride was a dazzle of white and
gold from crown to hem, and her trailing
court train was held out of the dirt by little
Ibell Murray. Sisters Betty and June Mof-
fatt fluttered pink draperies topped by
biscuit-colored hats with gold lace frilling
the under-brims. Tree tulips were posied in
their hands, and the bride carried sheaved
Easter-lilies. Jim Affleck, with the help of
Eric Learmonth, best-manned the ’groom.
The Moffatt parents held the jollo at Men-
zies’, where the room was garlanded with
roses. Mrs. Moffatt gladdened black silk with
silver embroideries, and the ’groom's mother,
Mrs. Darcy, lighted a magpie frock with a
bouquet of damask roses. ?
The Best Known crowded the Queen s
Hall one night last week, when Mrs. T. A.
Wei gall, wife of the acting Judge, seated
herself on a piano-stool and talked about
Rutland Boughton’s fairy opera “The Im-
mortal Hour,” this time to help the St. Kilda
branch of the Free Kindergarten Union,
j ady Forster, who is keen on both opera and
the cause, epilogued the talk with a tribute
to the genius and generosity of the talker.
Airs Weigall, who discourses with her tongue
as colorfully as with her fingers, visualised
Boughton’s charming opera so convincingly
that her listeners, when it was' over, rubbed
their eyes on finding the Immortals fled and
the stage coldly furnished forth with a lady
seated at a grand piano.
At last those w T ho have the public’s health
iii their hands are taking notice of the awful-
ness of some of Melbourne’s guest-houses,
and are calling for a better enforcement ot
the rules and regulations lately passed to
redress the evil. So far only East Mel-
bourne has been inspected. In some of these
houses, which are tenements in disguise—
and rottenly disguised at that—one dingy
room with a gas-stove on the landing and
a tin bath behind a curtain constitute a
flat. Self-sacrificing philanthropists buy old
houses that once accommodated a family ot.
say. half a dozen people and convert them
into rabbit-hutches for thirty. St. Kilda and
South Yarra boast the most splendid speci-
mens. Seeing that nearly half the houses
in some of our suburbs are for sale and
empty allotments loaf behind advertisement-
hoardings. one wonders why this should be
so in all its awful tliusness. The health
experts might next cast a savage eye on the
decaying shanties which line many Rich-
mond streets like heaps of broken packing-
cases flung aside. These breeders of dis-
ease have been rendered doubly unhealthy by
the great hoardings rising above the back
fences, and shutting the light and air out of
the yards which are the little children’s only
playgrounds.
Lady Forster has promised to drop into
the Palace Theatre on the evening of Dec.
8 to sec how Gaston Mervale puts on
Vachell’s play, ‘‘The Case of Lady Camber.”
The Mervale Academy students will get pro-
fessional assistance from Arthur Styan,
Frank Shepard and Mervale himself, and the
amateur stars will represent three States--
Millie Ryan, of Queensland: Irene Young, of
N. S- Wales; and two local damsels, Phyllis
Best and Louise Moorehead. Phyllis Best
has had her baptism of limelight with the
Emelie Polini company, and is now getting
her second chance with Muscovitch under
the J.C.W. banner after developing amazingly
as a Mervale Academy student.
Just what the Victorian side of the Murray
thought of the Woman’s Mibboe can best
be told by the prosaic figures of the distri-
buting agents in the wholesale way. Gordon
and Gotcli are old hands at the business and
ought to know pretty w T ell what the news-
shops and bookstalls will want; but the
demand for the Miekok so far exceeded their
guess that they increased their order for the
third and subsequent issues by 100 per cent.
—the demand was just double what they had
reckoned upon.
These handsome eyes snapped by Broo-
thorn belong to
Mary Claxten,
a Melbourne
girl whose line
dramatic so-
prano Theo-
philus Roberts
is polishing up
for comic-
opera use. A
pretty face,
plenty of per-
sonality and a
lightsome pair
of toes should
help her up
the ladder that
leads to the
stars. T li e
Rigo Opera
Co. taught her
how to use
her voice and
Allan Wilkie
how to hold
her hands.
The vice-regal Forsters watched the Mel-
bourne Grammar sports from the middle of
the arena, under convoy of the headmaster
and a few of the school councillors. The
pair, who w’ere aided by Captain Mulholland,
first drank afternoon tea in the Franklin
parlors. After the events had been run off,
the vice-regal lady, charming in navy silk
with a flower-trimmed hat, handed over a
tableful of silver cups.
A coo-ee from London mentions that the
W. Tobin widow’s younger daughter, Mrs.
Baldwin Raper, is seeking for the second
time to have her matrimonial shackles struck
off. Her first plunge was taken some years
back with a nephew of the Marchioness of
Linlithgow, Lord Frederick Conyngham. who
afterwards inherited the Conyngham Mar-
quisate. She soon divorced her peer for tak-
ing the wrong turning, and later on married
Baldwin Raper, one-time M.P. for Islington,
renouncing her title to do it.
The Kenneth Mclvers have given the
parental blessing to eldest daughter Mavis,
who has made a confession of intending mat-
rimony with the “Sunshine” McKays’ young-
est son, Hugh. The McKays now live
in the Clarkes’ old Sunbury homestead,
Rupertswood, which the harvester man
acquired a few years back from Baronet
Rupert. Mavis is the ex-schoolgirl tennis
champion, who lately played herself into the
Victorian team. She added to her laurels
in the inter-State matches against S’Aus-
tralia by winning every set she played.
Helton Daniell, here pictured by Lafayette,
has been one
of the live
wires of the
Repel* tor y
movement in
this city ever
since Gregan
M c Mahon
launched it 15
years ago. He
lias tried most
parts, from
leading ma n
to noise-maker
off stag*. This
year he is pro-
ducing an d
performing in
”L o y a Itics’’
a n d “T h e
Dover Road,”
which two suc-
cessful shows
will be again
presented at
the Playhouse for tlie Repertory’s final 1924
season on December 8. The 1924 produc-
tions have simply boomed; hundreds were
turned away from the Playhouse at every
performance of Barrie’s “Dear Brutus.’
Much of this success has been due to Helton
Daniell’s flair for fitting the right people into
the right parts.
J. C. Eccles, Vic. Rhodes scholar for 1925.
has accumulated an imposing collection of
exhibitions during his five years at Melbourne
’Varsity. Coming up to the Uni. with a
Government scholarship and sundry school
distinctions, he proceeded to annex a hrst-
class and the exhibition in each of three med.
subjects: in 1921 he topped his year in ana-
tomy. and filled second place in physiology,
and at the following examination led lus
confreres in both courses, repeating the per-
formance at the fourtli-year tests. The
bright young med. is the first Newman man
to carry off the Rhodes, and there was no
other candidate with a record to touch his.
Incidentally, Eccles is a blue in athletics. He
will do research work at Oxford.
Australia is calling some of them back.
Pianist Percy Grainger is coming again, and
Elsa Stralia is going to show licr own coun-
try how slic lias made fame abroad. But
another lady is returning who is even more
interesting. Few people are likely to remem-
ber the immature Frances Adler of a score
of years ago ; that lady is now Frances Alda,
prima donna of the New York Metropolitan
Opera, who meditates a descent on her native
land in 1926. She is married to the million-
aire controller of New York’s big opera
house.
The Acting-Sirdar of Egypt, Colonel
Huddlestone, who lias distinguished himself
by walking unarmed at a mob of Soudanese
mutineers who had their rifles cocked, has
manv relations in this country. He has a
step-b-other in ex-Queenslander Chataway,
who uses a brilliant journalistic pen in this
city as special correspondent to the London
Morning Post and other overseas papers;
and Admiral Cresswell is a cousin. Tlie
colonel is the son o 4: an ex-Professor of
Languages at Cambridge—the ’Varsity kept
him at his post even after the loss of his
eyesight. The only other Huddlestone son
was killed in the advance on Mons; and a
Chataway half-sister is the widow of
Moberly Bell, who used to be manager of
London Times.
The Ross Soden widow, who crossed to
England early this year, died the other day,
following an operation on her ear. Her
only unmarried son, AJf, was with her to
the last. Mrs. Ross Soden, who inherited
a slice of the Tyson millions, settled in
Toorak many years ago, first in Mandeville
Hall and afterwards in the roomy mansion
she had erected on the ashes of an old
Toorak bungalow, Grong Grong. During
the war years her big parlors sheltered more
money-raising entertainments for patriotic
causes than any others in this city. She
was a shrewd, kindly woman with a strong
personality which won her many friends.
Christmas shoppers should not forget to
explore the Disabled Soldiers’ furniture fac-
tory during their buying excursions. The
place is just off Prince’s Bridge, in Sturt-
street, South Melbourne. Baskets, chairs
and tables are some of the goods on offer.
Those who are looking for smaller trifles
will find them in the Red Cross handicraft
shop on the first floor of Queen’s-walk.
Fred Knight the younger has been facing
a bombardment of congratulations since stop-
ping on the matrimonial engagement list
with an attractive N. S. Wales girl, Jtfan
Nicholson, whose father feeds his flocks near
Berrigan. Fred’s mother was a Riverinu
Falkiner. The young man himself won-
khaki in the war.
Boyena Chisholm, 8.A., who succeeded
Brenda Sutherland as head of the Domestic
Economy College, lias gone abroad to widen
her knowledge. She is an Education De-
partment trainee. By the time she gets bark
the new college, the coin for which lias been
provided by ex-Treasurer McPherson out of
his own pocket, should be up on the old Mel-
bourne Gaol site, in Russell-street.
A special halo has been earned by the Old
Colonists’ Association. This organisation
was started in 1808 to relieve eases of dis-
tress among long-distance citizens, and
when its first balance-sheet was presented,
in IS7O, it had a credit balance of £O9B.
The funds have grown to £82,801; and when
the Government, recognising the society as
a deserving charity, put it on the estimates
for a subsidy of £lOOO, the Treasurer received a
shock. The Association remarked, with its
compliments and thanks, that it didn’t really
peed the money, and suggested it might br
used to assist some genuinely needy concern.
Despite the' bad taste of proputty-owners
and traders in converting professional and
residential places in Collins-street into shops.
Melbourne Club is holding up its head
proudly as if to emphasise the point that it
is d—d if it is going to be crowded out. It
has furbished up its facade in cream, tricked
out with green; and it stares haughtily over
the heads of the newly-rich who splash coin
so freely at the pubs opposite and on its
flank. If the City Council attempts to cut
down any of the shady trees in front of it,
as it is about to do foreninst the Athenaeum,
there will be a row.
Ex-Professor Meredith Atkinson, whose
course lately has been a very troubled one.
has just suffered a crowning calamity in the
loss of his wife, who passed away last week,
leaving three little children.
Hugh Ward will return to Australia next
month. Rumors about a combination with
J.C.W. need not be relied on. Hughie is out
to stay.
General Coxeu is switching over from his
job as Artillery Chief to Quartermaster-
General with a seat on the Board; but his
gunner pals will still keep touch with their
well-liked chief in liis role of Artillery
Adviser. The General, who is an A.D.C. to
George V., wears on his tunic a special kind
of aiguillette to show it.
A note or two from Adelaide:—
The Children’s Hospital established a new record
for itself by raking in nearly £9OO at its yearly
ffite. Mayoress Glover gave the show her inaugural
blessing, and in turn was blessed in the Hospital’s
name by lion, treasurer Herbert Phillipps. Of the
cash raised in the recent £20,000 appeal, between
£3OOO and £4OOO came from efforts launched by
the Mayoress.
Local charities are piling up bank balances. Miss
Keith Sheridan’s trustees (she was a sister of the
late Mrs. A. M. Simpson) are still paying out
bequests, a £lOOO cheque going to Minda and
£5OO and £2OO to the Mission to Seamen and the
St. John Ambulance Association. Mrs. Harry
Bickford’s legacies include £2OOO to the Orphan
Home for Girls at Mitcham and smaller sums to the
Church Lads’ Brigade, the Free Church Schools
and the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institutions at
Brighton.
Three teams opened the Polo season with a kind
of cyclic match at Birkalla, thereby proving that
F. E. Barritt, R. J. Evans and G. A. Ruddle, led
by F. \V. Porter, were the best of 12. Gordon Law
Smith, the Adelaide Club’s captain, dispensed tea,
and small silver cups were placed in the hands of
the winning team by Mrs. C. T. Bray.
Leila Constance, only daughter of the Hugo Booth-
bys, was married to Colin, only son of the Percy
Trevors, at Christ Church last week; and Marjorie,
daughter of Canon and Mrs. Murphy, said she
would to one of Dr. ,J. Gordon’s sons at All Souls’,
St. Peter’s. At the Boothby wedding guests were
mostly relatives, but even that made for a biggish
muster. There was tea and a speech or two at
the Boothby home in North Adelaide, and then a
confetti-showered departure per motor for Mount
Gumbier and the Victorian Western District.
The South Australian Orchestra said good-bye to
its fifth season with a social, at which conductor
Foote got a smoker’s outfit and some grateful praise
from Dr. Davies. Finance is the organisation’s
chief concern at present. With economy it can carri-
on for another five years, but somebody has got to
pay the piper after that, and the Government has
apparently turned its deaf side to a request for
State assistance.
Dorothy Slane, an Adelaide girl who is making-
good as a dancer in the States, is at present stepping
her way from San Francisco to Vancouver in a
vaudeville turn.
Alec Melrose drew the curtains of Beatrice Ohettle’s
paintings, hung in the Piccadilly tea-rooms, with
an appreciative word for the simplicity and direct-
ness of her work. The artist is one of the Talbot
Smith connections from the Cold Country. Both her
English and Australian pictures had a satisfactori-
scattering of red seals in the very early part of the
afternoon.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-

STOCKINGS
Tkere were great rejoicings last week in
the De Chair household (transferred to
Sutton Forest for the summer) at the arri-
val from England of bonnie daughter Elaine
and son Somerset. Further excitement came
late on Saturday when Lord Jellicoc dropped
in to swap yarns with his brother admiral.
Lady Jellicoe and the family also had bed
and a bite at the vice-regal residence in
the hills.
Those industries and handicrafts of dis-
abled and invalid soldiers which were spon-
sored by the Red Cross were fully represented
at a Market Day held at Rose Hall on Thurs-
day. Though the utility industries —pottery,
toys and basket-making—have left their god-
parent’s roof, being grown-up enough to face
the world alone, they were bidden to join in
this Christmas sale. The Red Crossers
themselves added a flower-stall, refreshments,
dips and other coin-extractions; the Blinded
Soldiers’ Tea Depot was also represented, and
most folk found there w r as nothing wrong
with the brand. All day long there was a
steady stream of buyers at the well-stocked
stalls arranged in the pretty grounds of the
Convalescent Home, and there wasn’t much
to take back to depdt and factory when the
gates closed upon the last customer. This
market day did much towards advertising
the wares, just as the generosity of Beale
and Co. in lending a window for a display
last week opened folks’ eyes to the beauty of
the articles in leather, brass, wood and
raffia that the Red Cross handicrafts
depOt has for sale. Other firms might fol-
low Beales’ lead ; there must be plenty whose
creed is “I believe in the Australian-made
goods of the other fellow as well as my own.”
The Women’s Handicrafts show was
opened at the Education Gallery by Tom
Henley’s lady. Though running almost neck
and neck with the Arts and Crafts’ Society,
there is a line of demarcation —the Handi-
crafts lady specialises in the fair harvests
of the needle: trousseaus and those garments
which the languid sales-lady refers to as
“lingur-ee.” Lace being rather out of date,
the undies and nighties feature embroidery
of the finest, equal to the best French. Once
more fashion turns to garments of white,
with perhaps a mere suggestion of color, as
illustrated in a “gown” of ivory crepe-de-
Lhine, with self-toned embroidery upon neck
and armhole edging of buttercup organdie.
Batik and the art of dyeing is demonstrated
by Misses Madsen, Eastwood and Manning.
Wonderful silk scarves and handkerchiefs
are in shades of blue and fuchsia, and in
tones of gold and hues of a rising and setting
summer sun. A supper-cloth of linen, with
exquisite crochet, stands to Miss Innes Noad’s
credit. The Association has had a prosper-
ous year, and this exhibition should gather
both dollars and laurels for the members.
Jumble sales are among the popular money-
raisers of the moment. Saturday afternoon
the Brown Owls had such a function to get
funds for various schemes of the Junior Girl
Uuides. A rare collection of wares included
four “hard-hitters”; but no customers could
be found patriotic enough to follow the lead
of the Prince of AVales in the matter of
headwear; not even the lady who left the
baby in the bath while she viewed the stock,
or the housewife who discovered a florin in
the sink and came to invest the same, could
be lured on to the purchase. Proceeds of
Brownies’ jumble sales and a few other
entertainments have lately provided two sun
shelters for the small patients at the Alex-
andria Hospital for Children.
A rare medley of dress and undress was
', lew |' t ' at Bondi on Saturday afternoon, for
the heat brought the local resident out in
baUung-suit and batli-robe, while a fashion-
ably-clad throng, chiefly feminine, sought the
seaside to jazz and drink tea at the Casino
ir aid of . St. Martha’s Home building fund.
Mrs. Cecil White and Kathleen Finn seere-
umed the successful function, and Minnie
Everett despatched some pupils to tread a
measure. St. Martha’s Home instructs girls
m the almost neglected art of housewifery,
and adds as a special feature needlecraft
mi excelsis. Ecclesiastical stitcliery gets a
deal of attention, but trousseau and lace-
makmg almost make it a dead heat.
The influence of Mr. Gilligan and his Eng-
lish cricketers has spread with alarming re-
sults amongst our very n nicest people,
nampden Oval was all of a flutter on Satur-
day afternoon when Keith Hardy led a team
into the field to worst an XI collected by
jack Brunton. The game was strictly
limited to those who had never played cricket
before, and the grandstand was lined with
Merivales, Johnsons, Bruntons and Wilkin-
sons, who balanced teacups and cakes on
their knees and cheered the players in the
proper spirit.
As the result of the cabaret held at the
Wentworth on Friday St. Margaret’s will
be able to keep many babies for many days.
Some 600 patrons crowded ballroom and palm-
court, and between dances sipped tea, while
pupils of the Misses Scully gave charming
ballets. Mrs. W. D. Langton (president),
Sister Kerven (treasurer) and May Sheehan
(lion, secretary) were chief movers of the
gathering.
The new wing of the Tressillian Mother-
craft Training School will be opened on
Saturday afternoon with an “American tea.”
Translated, this means “Bring a gift and buy
a gift,” and one supposes the tea is obtain-
able for a consideration also. Chief Secre-
tary Oakes will declare the building ready
for occupation.
Christmas bush and Christmas bells herald
the approach of the fatted turkey, and as
usual many of the big stores are arranging
special attractions for holidaying kiddies. Far-
mer’s staged yesterday for the first time
their twice-daily show of exciting adventures
in snowlands and buslilands, the whole ter-
minating in a wonder scene in the fairies’
country. The wireless “Hello Man” is going
to tell his audiences of young folk what magic
he uses. So the small girl who wrote “You
must be God, for only God could speak
through the air,” is to have another beautiful
illusion shattered.
The Women’s Club, which celebrated its
majority last year, is preparing to move
from its quarters in King-street to its brand-
new buildings in Elizabeth-street. To com-
memorate the founder of the club, Lady
Beaumont, the imposing skyscraper bears
her name. Mrs. McMillan is using her
artistic perceptions in helping to select the
fal-de-lals and furniture for the assembly-
room.
Violinist Ethel Holden collected heaps of
flowers, mysterious small packages, enough
boxes of chocolates to set up in the sweet
business and much applause from a big
audience at the King’s Hall on the occasion of
her recital. In a simple gown of fuchsia
cliarmante, the draperies caught with a dia-
mente buckle, the clever player, with Frank
Hutchens at the keyboard, displayed fine
tone, good technique and plenty of tempera-
ment in the haunting themes of Cesar
Franck’s Sonata in A, and the more forceful
rhythms of Sonata in C Minor by Grieg.
Included in the violinist’s smaller offerings
were a delightful composition, “Chosen,”
evidently built upon an old English folk-
song, by Howells. Clem Williams supported
with well-sung numbers, including “Largo al
factotum,” “Linden Lee” and Rex de Rego’s
melodious “Live with Me and Be My Love.”
He gets this Letter’s blessing for his clear
enunciation.
The lady in the picture is the new matron
at the Royal Hospital for Women at Pad-
dington. She is
Matron Major
West, R.R.C.,
and after
spending three
years in sav-
ing soldiers’
lives in Salon-
ika she came
back to Aus-
tralia to help
save little citi-
zens by the
hundred for
this great con-
tincnt. A
trainee of
Prince
Alfred’s, she
served for sev-
eral years be-
fore the war
in country hos
pita 1 s, and
since her re-
turn from foreign parts has been senior sister
of the big baby-raising institution of which
she now becomes chatelaine. May Moore
made this picture of her.
The exhibition of etchings, embroideries,
etc., from Czecho-Slovakia has proved a profit-
able investment for Mrs. McMillan and Miss
Tildesley, who dared the venture. Though
the show does not close at Swain’s until
Saturday, within the first couple of days the
whole consignment except etchings was pur-
chased. The Slovakian is becoming modern-
ised in so much that national dress is gradu-
ally being discarded; but he adheres to the
past in many industries, and his pottery of
to-day is the pottery of yesterday morning.
Katlier quiet in color design are these wares,
but glowing tones —vivid reds and gold and
blue—appear in wearing apparel and the
toys made by the peasants. An altogether
fascinating exhibition, and enlightening, too.
Dr. James Graham’s widow was the lock-
smith at the Christmas sale of needlework,
done by orphans in far-away Armenia, held
at the Chapter House in St. Andrew’s
grounds. To preserve the atmosphere stall-
holders wore the effective national dress and
the Mayor’s Armenian Relief Fund benefited.
Young folks will have a Christmas frolic
to-day (Thursday) on the decks of the
Marella. The gathering will be for the
benefit of Prince Alfred Hospital. Dallie
Thomson, as organising secretary, heads a
committee of energetic w r orkers, who mean
to make returns a record.
No man has brought the message of glori-
ous sound to more people in this State than
Ernest Tru-
man. For 16
years he has
been City
Organist, and
during th a t
time his great
instrument has
pealed and
thundered its
mighty music
to eager tens
of thousands.
If you are of
the blessed and
can afford to
pay for all the
concerts you
want to go to,
then yon can’t
imagine just
wh a t those
free organ-re-
citals in the
Town Hall are
to those to whom the spending of even a few
shillings on entertainment is next to im-
possible. Mr. Truman for many years was
organist at St. Patrick’s, Church Hill, and
it was during this period he composed his
best-known Mass. An Ave Maria and a
cantata, “The Pied Piper,” are other works
from his graceful and fluent pen. Of one
thing the city fathers can be proud, and that
is the appointing of a Sydney native to the
position Truman has so long occupied. The
picture is by May Moore.
White satin marocain gracefully draped to
a pearl caboclion, with a rare Limerick lace
veil, was worn by Myee Kenyon at St.
Mark’s last week, when she became the life-
partner of Dr. D. H. Bodycomb, of Griffith.
She was ’maided by her sister, whose white
satin frock showed touches of green, and
green leaves ci-owned her fair locks. The
bride’s parents welcomed, the guests at
Quambi, Double Bay. The honeymoon is
being spent in the southern capital; the
bride defied the fates by starting off in
almond-green.
Helen, only daughter of the late Major
Morris, of the R.A.A., and of Mrs. Morris,
of Darling Point, has given the right answer
to Lieut.-Commander Gilbertson, R.N. and
D.S.O. The lass, a brainy maiden, is a
grandchick of that benign old citizen of other
days, Mr. Christian, of Tudor, Elizabeth
Bay.
George Marks and Linda Wallis are to
have a wedding at the end of the year. The
bride-elect is the artist who plays tennis and
golf extra-well. Her late father was for
many years a director of Winchcombe, Car-
son and Co.; and our first baronet, Daniel
Cooper, was her grand-uncle. Napoleonic
history is the pastime of the prospective
bridegroom, who is on the Sun’s literary
staff. The ceremony will be at St. Mary’s
on December 3.0, and the after-rejoicings at
the Ambassadors.
Edna Thomas, the fascinating singer of
negro spirituals, whose concerts also demon-
strate the charm of the crinoline, has a drop
of Irish in her make-up; so last week she
went to exchange greetings and melodies with
members of the Gaelic League at their rooms
in Castlereagh-strcet. The lady from
Louisiana, who must be back home shortly,
sings the last of her spirituals and creole
lullabies to an Australian audience in the
rosy glow of the Adyar Hall to-morrow night.
No Australian deb. ever had a more suc-
cessful coming-out than The Bulletin’s
flapper, the Woman’s Mikbor, had last
week. It' whs literally an astonishing suc-
cess—so astonishing that if twice as many
copies had been printed the demand would
have been only just satisfied. Every Tues-
day will see the flapper in her pale-blue
frock on the bookstalls and in the stores;
and it is already quite obvious that she is
going to be the most popular young thing
this country ever knew. For 3d. there are 64
pages, a free dress-pattern and about a dozen
dress designs besides.
The Hotel Australia is after the scalps
of those wantons who have recently hacked
frills off cushions and tassels off lamp-shades
in the newly-decorated drawing-room. All
hotels suffer more or less from the depreda-
tions of the sneak-thief—-the self-styled
“souvenir-hunter” —but when it comes to
sheer vandalism the victims are moved to
emphatic protest, and a reward is awaiting
anyone who can lead the management to the
offenders.
Organising Girl-Guide Nella Levy is going
to London early in the New Year, and
au revoir gatherings are being arranged. A
field day by the Guides, and a pow-pow (no
relation to kow-tow) by the Brownies, who
are Guides in the making, are among the
farewells proposed. The popular little lady
will be wished good luck by her sister-officers
at a moonlight harbor trip, which sounds
very pleasant, but rather a waste of moon-
light.
Another recruit to the stage is Yal Rolin,
Judge Rolin’s pretty niece, who answered
her first call on Saturday night in the musi-
cal comedy. “Wildflower.” The law was to
have been the maiden’s aim, but the lure
of grease-paint was stronger. She is said
not to lack talent, and now only awaits
elusive Opportunity to prove it.
Lord Jellicoe’s visit to Sydney recalls a
story of Scapa Flow. An enemy sailor and
a British tar had been swapping ideas, and
the former, expectorating freely into the sea,
exclaimed “That for your King, that for your
Jellicoe, and that for your British Navy.”
“I don’t care what youl*do about the King
and Jellicoe,” replied John Tar, “but don’t
you, dare spit in our sea!”
Contralto Kate Rooney Kirkham is aboard
the Sierra, which left San Francisco on Nov.
19 for Australia. With small son Billy she
intends spending about six months here with
her mother and sister.
The carpenters and plasterers who are
remodelling the Mosman Town Hall chased
the local Musical Society to the distant fields
of North Sydney, where Lionel Moncton’s
“The Cingalee” was produced at the Manresa
Hall. In this melodious and mirthful two-
acter, Dorrie Ward was a lively Lady
Patricia and the pick of the basket; while
Gwladys Rawling, as Peggy Sabine, was
smartly gowned, and sang with spirit. The
role of Nanoya fell to Mary Hosking, who
was a dainty and refined little Nan. Harry
Perfect’s Chambuddy Ram, the Baboo law-
yer, produced topical gags which raised a
laugh even from the Cremorne lady who
had had (and lost) three domestic helps
in a fortnight. The Royal North Shore Hos-
pital pockets the proceeds of the show, which
ran tor a number of nights.
Judith Anderson, a Sydney girl who has
been building up a reputation in the
U.S.A., got the reward of eight years’ pains-
taking apprenticeship, plus dazzling talent,
when the great Belasco himself sought her
the other day with a five years’ contract to
play on Broadway.
Brisbane adds a postscript:—
Sir Matthew went to William Heughan’s concert
in the Elite, having with him Mrs. Nathan, Mrs.
H. I/Estrange, Mrs. Jack Chandler and a parry
of youths and maidens, with 11. M. Saunders to
take care of them. There was a full house to
hear the Gordon Highlander, wno sang “Auld Lang
Syne” and other unfamiliar ditties, then retreated to
musical Lismore, where a packed house awaited him.
Sir Matthew dined the Gaukrodgers and the Iveti-
nedys at Government House, and had Mrs. P. L.
Oardew and a party to tennis and afternoon tea, on
the 27th. The Gaiters of Rockhampton and Miss
Crick have been staying at the Governor’s mia-mia.
They left for Sydney on the 28th. Mrs. George
Nathan and Miss Crick went with Sir Matthew to the
Musical Union’s “Song of Hiawatha,” where Con-
stance Buchan soloed in mauve and silver.
Incidentally, Sir Matthew has been to Murgon;
watched a stump capping; broke meat with the
Murgon shire council; presided at a meeting of the
Queensland Forestry Association; admired a physical-
culture display in the Gym. Hall; opened a few
memorial fetes, and dined with the Caledonians.
The rest of his life has been his own.
Dr. Robertson has given daughter Margaret to
brother-medico Ralph Weaver, of Forbes (N.S.W.).
Dunalister, the W. N. Robertson home, was dressed
up with poppies and daisies and Christmas-bells.
Archbishop Duhig and Father O’Connell tied the
knot. The bride was in cream brocade, silver tulle
veu and orange blossoms; Joan Robertson and
Mabel Weaver ’maided in green frocks and green-
and-silver turbans, with pink begonia bouquets. Dr.
J. J. Power best-manned and Margaret’s brother
Ken Robertson ’groomed. The bride, who is a good
looker, was a well-known amateur actress, and took
part in Walter Hunt’s repertory shows.
The last of this year’s Authors and Artists’ social
evenings woke up the Wattle Cafe, where Merna
Gillies and A. G. Stark purveyed a programme of
seng and elocution; and E. Colclough drew high-
speed pictures with a faggot.
Harry Borradale is ploughing the stumps out of
Steele Rudd’s “Grubb’s Selection,” to come forward
at the Elite for the benefit of the Association’s cash-
box.
The Sketching Club is letting the public sea
its efforts shortly, and on Dec. 13 is having a jaunt
to Seven Mile Rocks.
Mrs. Jack Caine, whom the Orsova brought home,
gave a dance in Lennon’s ballroom to Captain Mathe-
son, the Bulcocks and others. Daughter Maisie has
stayed behind to study in Paris.
“Little Nellie Kelly” was greeted by a good house,
including the Cadell Garricks, Mrs. 11. C. Mills,
the Whittinghams and Mollie Brenan. The dancers
should leave a few pounds behind in this city owing
to a heat wave we’ve been having.
The Brisbane Women’s Club feted retiring president
Highfield and hon. secretary Bingham with flowers,
vegetable and verbal. The club’s membership is
close on 400. Mrs. E. B. Harris was elected president
unopposed, and M. H. Arundell hon. sec.
St. Mary’s (South Brisbane) is out to build an
up-to-date Infants’ School, and Monsignor Byrne
opened the campaign in the school grounds, Peel-
street.

Seven >of the 10 winners at Canterbury
Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday were favorites —a change
for Sydney punters. The good-looking but hitherto
disappointing Dion (10 to 9) started it, and St.
Hryde (4’s), St. Eaton (2's), Alick Ray (9 to 4),
Media (3’s), Irish Flower (2’s) and Mont de Pete
(u to 2) continued the good work, with interruptions
irom John Sands (8 s), Loyal Alerv (9 to 2) and
Lord Babbie (20’s). The last-named is a two-year-
old half-brother, by Highfleld, to Rivoli, now retired
from business, but it is doubtful if he will ever be
classed with his distinguished relative. More of a
Royan than a Rivoli, perhaps.
If Rlackadder starts in the A.J.C. Villiers
Stakes on December 20 he will have plenty of friends,
his 9st. 91b. notwithstanding. With 9st. 2ib. he
made hacks of a good field in the seven-furlongs
Camellia Stakes at Rosehill on Sept. 20, and
although he had only Bst. lib. in the Epsom Handicap
he won with fully a stone in hand. Enere (Bst
31b.), Cistercian (Bst. 21b.) and Friarsdale (Bst.
lib.) are a likely-looking trio, and there may be a
good race in Royal Dightcn (7st. 31b.), who will
have profited by his spell. David has lOst. 21b. in
the Summer Cup, but there is a doubt about his
running; in any case, he would find it a tough
problem to concede the weight over the distance
(13 furlongs) to smart young horses like Prince
\Voorak (7st. lllb.), Prince Minimbah (7st. 71b.)
and Highlander (7st. 31b.). Many Carrington Stakes
and Tatt.’s Cup doubles will be started with Bardoleur
(Bst.), a fair horse at Randwick. And Comptroller
(7st. 51b.) or one of the three mentioned for the
Summer Cup may be dangerous in the 12-furlongs
handicap on New Year’s Day.
* * * *
Bernbanks (Bernard-Agnes Banks), of
whom his owner has an exalted opinion, had a win
at last in the 10-furlongs handicap at Sandown Park
on Saturday, scoring cleverly from Covess and Bind-
weed. But the shop-getters would have been more
troublesome if Covess had been kicked along earlier,
and if Bindweed had not been rushed to the front,
from which position she has repeatedly refused to win
—the race was really a triumph for William Duncan’s
riding. The ancient Attadale, another of those
hardy Westralians, led for most of the six fur-
longs in the Sandown Plate, but imported Shanky,
who has shown good form in South Australia, caught
him at the half-distance, and held him safely to the
end. Bernbanks (4’s) and Shanky (3’s) were half-
favorites, and MeCramp profited little by the suc-
cesses of Lord Trim (4’s) and El Capitan (3’s).
The day closed less evilly for punters than the early
victories of Mnomi (15’s) and Reputed King (16’s)
suggested.
* * * *
“Tuart”: It puzzles me why some of the
wealthy people who go in for breeding racehorses
don’t give Westralia a trial. They could get the
land for a tithe of what it would cost them in
the Hunter River valley or in the Western District
of Victoria, and there are other advantages. Whether
because of the climate or the feed or a combination
of causes, horses do uncommonly well in the West.
Yearlings bought for tw’o or three hundred at the
Sydney sales put in a couple of seasons in the
Jarrah State and return champions or near-
champions : witness Blue Spec, Jolly Beggar, Mistico,
Eurythmic, Easingwold and Lilypond. Also, steeds
with indifferent performances in other countries have
a knack of coming good in Groperland: for example,
Paul Pry, Dyed Garments, Macadam, lan 1 ’Or and
Lilyveil. Again, horses last longer at the game in
Westralia than elsewhere. High Wall, who won the
Hurdle at Helena Vale on Nov. 22, was one of the
“ponies” admitted to the fold when unregistered
racing was abolished in 1916, and he had been racing
two or three seasons before that. He must be nearly
old enough to vote. Bobaris, another winner at
Helena Vale, ran second in the Boulder Cup in
August, 1919, and he was getting up in years even
then. A third winner at the Vale was Outlook, who
was third in the V.R.C. Maribyrong Plate in 1917
how many of that vintage are racing now? Horse-
breeding has never been more than a sideline in the
West, and it has suffered from a superfluity of poor
mares. A breeder with a high-class stallion and a
representative collection of stud matrons would
probably do well.
* * * *
“FY7” : The Red Hots have their cham-
pions no less renowned than the Ponies and the
Regulars. When that great trotter Man-o -War ran
second in the Ferguson Handicap at Otahuhu (M.L.),
he raised his prize-money record, since arriving .’n
Maoriland, to £Booo—a wonderful achievement,
though the trotting game in the Shivery Isles has
better backing and commands bigger rewards than
prevail in N.S.W. According to one account, Man
o’-War started “seventh favorite.” It is not often
that a first, second or third favorite, to go no further,
gets home in the Red Hots. The form is too hard
to judge.
* * * .*
The weather provided for the tennis cham-
pionships at the Albert Park (Vie.) ground was
patchy, and so, in the main, was the tennis. 9ut-
standing in the early part of the week was the
engagement between Sclilesinger (Vic.) and N. leach
(NSW.), in which the latter gained two out of
the three first sets, scoring with faultlessly executed
forehand drives; but Schlesinger came strongly in
the next two sets, which he won narrowly, iattei-
son’s play, both in doubles and singles, was in and
out, but he excelled himself against Mclnnes, whom
he defeated in three straight sets. And young It.
0. Cummings, of Sydney, entered the championship
class by his victory over O'Hara Wood. He had
previously drubbed Clemenger (6 2, 6 0, o 2),
and his accurate driving and fine stamina were too
much for Wood in a great five-set match (9—7,
(j 3 3 e, 4 — 6, 9—7). Patterson found Havvkes
a tough opponent (1 — 6, B—G,8 —G, 10 — 8, G—-3), and,
tired as the pair were, they overwhelmed tne
Fitehett-Mclnnes combination in the doubles, Hawkes
playing in defiance of doctor’s orders. Patterson beat
Cummings in the final.
“Toosday” (U.S.A.) : In a printed compari-
son of his style with those of Charlton and Borg,
Johnnie Weismuller attributes his slight superionty
in speed to better leg work. He rates. Charlton the
strongest-armed swimmer alive. W eismuller em-
ploys a six-beat thrash; as the right arm enters for
the pull, the legs, with ankles flexed, beat right,
left right leg. By this time the left arm has entered,
and’ the beats are left, right, left leg; the whole
represents two major drives (1 and 4) of 20in. with
four minor beats (2, 3, 6, 6) of 12in, Both Charlton
and Borg use their legs as “balancers, and,
accordingYo Weismuller, the Manly youth's wide two-
beat trudgeon kick necessitates a bad dip of tne
right shoulder and roll of the body while he
breathes and “coasts,” the. attempt to get propulsion
from his legs resulting in the pause in his arm
action. When I saw Weismuller register 4min. 57sec.
for 440 yards (Carnegie Pool, New Haven) he was
swimming a straight eight-beat thrash, four to each
arm, but since his “heart disease” he has gone bach,
to the more comfortable six-beat rhythm.
Ernie Rice (lOst. 51b.) demonstrated be-
fore a sparse Melbourne Stadium audience on
Saturday night that England has not altogether lost
its punch. Walking up to his Australian opponent,
Dave Ross (lOst. 61b.), as if lie merely desired to
make some remark about the oppressive weather,
Ernest unwound a surprising double-fisted battery
that soon had the Aussie on the canvas. On the
ninth second, Rice rose from the near-dead and
survived the round by clinging to his opponent like
a lover. But the battery got to work again in the
second round; and Ross went down unconscious.
It was the most effective example of compressed
stoush seen at the Stadium for ages. Rice failed
badly—and mysteriously—in Sydney, but he is likely
to make a nice squash of some of the lemons now
fighting about Melbourne, if the public condescends
to supply the sugar.

until it livened up.
‘Wake me up,’ I says
to Tom, ‘when any-
thing exciting hap-
pens.’ By and bye I
felt him shaking me,
and woke up with a
start. ‘What is it?’
I asks. ‘Anything hap-
pened?’ ‘No,’ he says,
‘only they’re closing
the gates and we might
as well go. It’s 6
o’clock.’ ”

H. Lee, aged 16 years, won the 100 yards handicap
from scratch in lOsec. dead. Giving away up to
25yds. he cut out a furlong in 22- 4-ssec. Certainly
he was helped by a typical Canterbury nor’-wester,
but, even so, the times were great. A week later
at the Secondary Schools’ championships Lee won
the hundred, after stumbling at the start, in 1C
3-ssec., the furlong in 23 l-ssec., and the quarter
with ridiculous ease in 55sec.

At Cardiff on Saturday, the All Blacks
levelled up a nineteen-year-old score by beating Wa’es
19—0; 4 tries, 2 goals and a penalty goal to nil.
The crowd numbered 50,000, and then the gates
had to be shut long before play started. Maoriland
led all through, scoring 11 points in the first half
and beating the Welshmen forward and back. As
far as points go for the first 21 matches, this side is
still a few below the record of 1905, with 496 to 61,
as against 503 to 41, but it is still undefeated, and
likely to remain so.
“Past Grammar”: An echo of 1905 was dis-
cernible in the news that the All Blacks had asked
the Welsh Rugby Union to submit the names of
three referees for the match against Wales, the
visitors to make their choice. The 1905 All Blacks
sustained their only defeat at the hands and feet
of Wales. The referee allowed E. T. Morgan, of
Wales, a try which the Maorilanders swore he never
got, and refused an apparently clear one to Geo.
Deans, the All Black winger. He was a Scots-
man, J. D. Dallas, himself an active player and
a Scottish “cap.” Some weeks before this game
the All Blacks had given Scotland a drubbing,
and a feud had arisen between the two, which led
to Scotland refusing to meet the present All Blacks,
after nearly a generation had elapsed. The men
of 1905 made no secret of their dissatisfaction witii
Dallas, and when the Ulster team submitted an-
other Scot, J. M. Tennant, as referee the other
day, the present All Blacks turned him down.
Altogether, the ring seems set for a royal row
between the Scottish and M.L. Rugby Unions. The
possibility is all the more regrettable since the
Maorilanders are largely of Scottish descent.
“J.H.” (London) : I have seen the All Blacks in
10 of their first 11 matches and, while their victories

FLAPPER ( watching pole-vault) : “Think have much higher he could
go if he didn't have to carry that stick!”
look impressive, I can’t help thinking they will strike
trouble against; England at Twickenham on January
3. County football in England is of poor quality—
the teams are scratch sides with little chance against
a team of internationals well into their stride and
playing together twice a week. The All Blacks are
beaten regularly for the ball, and, while this is
a small handicap against the counties, it is apt to
be disastrous against a side with a strong attacking
back division. Newport is by no means a great
XV, but it w'as only in the very last minute of the
game that the All Blacks scored the winning try.
The present English XV would run rings round New-
port, who only scrambled home by a point a
fortnight ago against a mediocre Blackheath XV.
The trouble with the All Blacks is with the forwards;
they are good enough individually, but they don’t
seem to be able to get together as a pack. The
hacks are good, but great—no, decidedly not. To
compare them with Gallaher’s 1905 combination is
absurd.
* * * *
“Nitric”: Re elderly playing footballers.
Bob Williams, who toured England with the Kan-
garoos in 1910, turned out for Warwick (Q.) in the
inter-city fixtures this year. Bob is 47. He was an
old comrade in arms and scrums with “Sandy”
Pearce, who is 46 and yet plaved international foot-
ball in 1921 and interclub matches in Sydney last
year.

Somehow or other the South Australians
always seem to strike bad luck in Sydney. On
Friday they had to begin their game against N. S.
Wales three hours after their arrival from Melbourne
(some of them hadn’t slept a wink on the train),
and then they were deprived of first knock on a per-
fect wicket, owing to Vic Richardson losing the toss.
And, as if that wasn’t enough misfortune for a day,
Wall, their new express, had to leave the field after
bowling one over, having ruptured a leg muscle.
In the circumstances, the Ma State’s achievement
of scoring 312 in 188 minutes, with four wickets
clown, wasn’t as remarkable as it looked. All the
same, the batting of Rock, the University crack,
who hit 127 (60 of them boundaries) in 140 minutes,
was very bright, and Andrews (99) was equally
entertaining till he was splendidly caught by Vic.
Richardson. On the second day Morgan (74), a
promising Glebe batsman, and the stylish Kippax
(127) carried the score beyond the fourth hundred,
hut the last five wickets fell for 46, with the total
at 510 ; Grimmett. who had taken 1 for 125, finished
with 5 for 137. The Croweaters started with Gould
and Arthur Richardson, but Gregory, howling in
something like his old form, got Gould for 3 and the
all-rounder for 4, Then a plucky stand was made
by Vic; Richardson (100 in 136 minutes) and Prit-
chard (71), who put on 180 for the third wicket.
Richardson played the fast bowling in the style of
a master, his sturdy drives and perfectly-timed on-
strokes being delightful to watch; and Pritchard,
though bothered at times by Gregory, jumped out
to Mailey’s slows and knocked them all over the
shop. But no one else did much, and the innings
closed for 248, Gregory having bagged 7 for 88.
More bad luck befell the visitors at the outset of
their second innings, Gould and Grimmett being dis-
posed of in a bad light for 2. The game should
have been adjourned till the light was better—a
course adopted when Vic Richardson came in,
although Gould’s appeal had been rejected. An-
other splendid stand was made by Richardson and
Pritchard, the captain’s contribution being 125 (in
IS4 minutes) and the left-hander’s 85, while 202 was
added by the partnership, and (Rymill coming to
light with a spirited 62) the side was saved
from an innings’ defeat. Pluckier cricket has rarely
been seen, and it now looks as if the two Richard-
sons will have to be played in at least one of
the Test matches, especially as Macartney is out of
action for the present. Also, Pritchard is not un-
likely to succeed Bardsley, as the left-hander suc-
ceeded Clem Hill.
* * * *
“Will Vernon”: They were at the match
between the Ma State and Gilligan’s XI —four
blinded Diggers, with their hats pulled down over
their sightless eyes. With them was a crippled cob-
ber, who communicated to them the story of the
scoring board, and the smack of bat against hall
and the impulsive cries of the spectators did the rest.
Of course the cricket authorities of a grateful country
had provided them and their one-legged friend with
seats in the members’ stand and . Not a bit of
it,. They were among the two-bohbers on the hill,
seated at' the foot of the slope, immediately behind
the packed ring of people standing to view the game.
And the crippled cobber stood as well.
* * * *
“Old H.” : Judging by exhibition trials
given on Melbourne’s new motordrome, future spec
tators at races thereon are likely to get more thrills to
the minute than at any other sport going. The outfit
is more of a soup-plate than a saucer. The level centre
is grassed (it is
reached by a subway)
—and the concave edge
where the speeders
race is of reinforced
concrete, while the rim,
where sightseers stand
and look down on the
midgets careering
round, is a well-
sloped clay bank. The
track itself is 35 feet
wide, a fid there are
three laps to the mile.
Already several motor-
bikists have cut out
a lap in 15 seconds,
equal to 80 m.p.h., so
persons with weak
hearts are advised to
stay away when the
record-breaker gets go-
ing. The management
seems to have had an
eye to this contin-
gency, as, built into
its concrete outer wall
—Oft. high with
barbed-wire entangle-
ments atop—are many
brick turnstiles, so
narrow that no fat per-
son has a hope of en-
tering. Around the
outer edge of the soup-
plate 80 big electric
lights throw a bilious
glare over after-dark
contestants. As long as all goes well the concern
will be a joyous boon, but should a tyre burst or
other accident, happen, well —the machines will be
here and the riders in the hereafter.
* * * *
The Englishmen demonstrated in Sydney
that they have a match-winning bowler in Tate and
a match-winning batsman in Chapman. “Chappy”
was the hero of the closing phase of the struggle
with N. S. Wales; going in when five good wickets
had fallen for 183, and 117 more were wanted, he
knocked the bowling all over the field for a
superb 71, at the rate of a run a minute, and
his side won by three wickets. At Brisbane, in
the match against Queensland (fresh from a success
over a fairly good N. S. Wales XI), the cheerful
youth scored 80 in 70 minutes, to the huge satisfaction
of 13,000 spectators. Previously Hobbs had made .'>4
and Sandham 64, and with Hendren contributing a
magnificent 168 in 192 minutes and some assistance
from Whysall (40) and Tyldesley (38), the total
reached 522. Honiibrook did most of the work for
Queensland, but the tall left-hander was very costly:
5 for 210. O’Connor (29), Benstead (40), Rowe
(32), and Thompson (39) gave the Bananalanders a
fair start, but Tate (4 for 32) got to work again,
and Queensland was soon facing the prospect of an
innings defeat.
* * * *
“Downside”: A cricket item deemed worth
cabling last week was that the august M.O.C. had
upheld the ruling of a Yorkshire umpire who, when
a left-handed batsman turned bis bat round and
made himself right-handed to bit at an off-ball,
promptly gave him out for “obstruction and unfair
play.” There’s little new in cricket, and 40 years
ago or more, the versatile E. M. Grace, who gave
most freak strokes a try, in his time —“the long-
whiskered doctor who laughs all rules to scorn,” poet
Francis Thompson called him—was credited with
having done exactly the same thing, the only differ-
ence being that he had to convert himself into a
left-hander. I never heard that an appeal was made
in that case; the incident probably passed as one of
“The Coroner’s” eccentricities and laws were less
rigid then. Still, the M.C.C. ruling has sound
sense as well as regard for fielders’ lives and limbs
to support it, and the modern bunch of slips will
doubtless view it with entire approval. A batsman
sufficiently ambidextrous to drive, not merely edge, a
fast long hop in their direction would make the gully
an excellent place to be out of.

“Ashmead”: Aldred Tliurstun will play
bowls this' season with his dad (G. 8.) and grandad
(j.E.) on the Launceston club’s green. The two
older fellows have their names on the club champion
ship board. I don’t know of any game, unless it is
ping-pong, in which the like could happen.

TOURINS CAR
It is frequently asked how a car so light can
be at the same time so remarkably sturdy.
The answer, of course, is simple. Pressed steel
parts and perfectly designed steel forgings are
used instead of heavy castings.
Combined with the admirable design and
balance of the car, this construction results in
ease of control, greater tyre mileage, low
upkeep cost and long life-

Albert Pointing, the wealthy retired
N.SAV. master-butcher who died a few days
ago, began life as a choir-boy in Winchester
Cathedral.
Died at Suva, Fiji, Charles Ormond Eyre,
once of the Fijian civil service and son
of the Australian explorer and, later, Gov-
ernor of Jamaica —famous there for quell-
ing the last black insurrection in the island.
W. J. Long, the young man who secured
one of the five places in the Labor selection
for Botany (Sydney), like the late J. S. T.
McGowen and W. J. McKell, M.L.A., who
succeeded him, is a boilermaker in the Rail-
way workshops, having learnt his trade and
acquired his particular shade of red at Cobar.
A prominent striker in 1917, he had to stand
down for three years before re-employment.
His pet aversion is bonus work in the shops.
“Lily Beale” : Letter-sorters may deserve
an occasional bouquet for their acumen (B.
30/10/’24), but some can be wondrously per-
verse as well. A week or two back Fleming
Bros., of Palesthan station. Condobolin
(N.S.W.I, received a letter posted to them
at an office in the same district last April.
The missive, like the girl in the play, bad
taken the wrong turning and gone to Jerv.
salem first, Palesthan haying obviously beet*
confused with Palestine. It is rather curi-
ous that both the brothers saw service there
in the war.
After quarter of a century of more or less
loose living, the Commonwealth has 700
people on its pension list, exclusive of Dig-
gers. Not all the liability, however, belongs
to the Commonwealth ; when it took over an
army of State officials, the States kept a
share of superannuation liability. The
highest-paid pensioner is Nicholas Lockyer,
whose last job was that of Inter-State Com-
missioner, but w T ho was Assistant Collector
of Customs at the outset of Federation.
Lockyer draws £792 p.a., and is followed
closely by A. Green, ex-Public Service In-
spector (£703) and G. T. Allan, sometime
Secretary of the Treasury (£751), who has
been drawing his dole for Si. years. Others
are Capt. It. H. M. Collins (£627). A. W.
Arkill (£443) and F. Savage (£506) ; all
these three were at Australia House.
Will Lawson writes from California:—
Extra quick trans-Pacific passages by sailing-vessels
are not often noted; but a barquentine, the Kate
G. Pederson, blew into San Francisco last week after
sailing the 7000 miles from Sydney in 49 days 18
hours. This is accounted the fastest time for 31
years. In 1893 the barquentine Jane L. Stanford
niaue the run in an even 49 days. Other fast times
recorded are: British ship Star of France, 50 days
(Oct., 1897) ; British ship Micronesia, 51 days (July,
1890) ; American barquentine Mary Winkelman, 51
days (Nov., 1897) ; British ship Tamar, 51 days (Feb.,
1897). Sailing across the Pacific means laying courses
to catch prevailing winds, so these old-timers may
have travelled a good deal more than the 7000-mile
steamer distance. The three British ships mentioned,
with a dozen others, are lying in Oakland basin most
of their time now. Once a year, in the salmon season,
L..<_y go north to Alaska to be used as canning works
and store ships, and return to San Francisco at the
end of the season, loaded down, but sailing as well
as of yore.
An Australian heroine died at Chatswood
a week or two ago. She was the widow of
tlie adventurous Nat Buchanan and the
daughter of John Gordon, and was born in
1842 at Port Macquarie, where lier father
was in charge of the stock of Major Innes.
As a small girl of 10 she moved to Glen
Innes, where Gordon formed and stocked the
Furracabad, Mole and Dundee stations.
Twenty years later the family moved by
bullock and horse teams to the Burnett, in
Queensland. Her next long trek was with
her husband to Bowen, and thence 400 miles
inland by buggy to Bowen Downs station:
she was the first white woman in that part
of Queensland now known as the Thompson
and Aramac districts, including Muttaburra
and Longreacli. In 1890 Mrs. Buchanan
joined her husband, brothers and son on
Flora Valley cattle-station, near Hall’s
Creek, East Kimberley (W.A.),_ with only
one white woman within 200 miles. Then
after seeing her people through their rough-
est time she came to Sydney. Her only
child is Gordon Buchanan, of Glen Innes.
“Ex-Dig.”: Monash during his chairman-
ship of the Vic. Police Commission only once
departed from his sternly judicial attitude;
that was to remark that in his experience a
senior who was very strict was not neces-
sarily unpopular. And Monash knows. In
the First Division was an officer against whom
so many comnlaints of unnecessary severity
had been made that the General thought it
advisable to investigate them himself. The
news got round that Mac. was likely to be
removed to some sphere where rigid disci-
plinary methods would be less liable to stir
up resentment, and Mon ash was puzzled to
find the under-a-cloud officer suddenly popu-
lar. He was still puzzled and undecided
when, taking a walk, cloaked, he hit on the
idea of asking a Digger, who had no chance
of recognising him in the darkness, his
opinion of the officer. “As far as the men
are concerned,” he was told. “Mac. is a
blanlty blanker. But he’s a blanky fine sol-
dier.” It was because of this inkling that
a splendid officer, who, by the way, did not
live to see the war through, kept his job.
“Gouger”: A couple of up-to-date sales-
men are -working the Clarence (N.S.W.)
with a complete milking-machine ready for
instant action mounted on an old Ford lorry.
Their plan of campaign, whenever they hear
of a possible buyer, is to dash into his yard
at milking-time, switch on to the cows, put
the lot through at top speed, then turn
patronisingly to bewildered Dad and say:
“There, now. that’s how we do things in
the city. The price is” Sometimes
deeper than strategy is used. A cocky with
a big herd of milkers and a family of cricket-
ing sons is “spotted.” One bright Saturday
afternoon, when the family is shorthanded
and Dad has just run his legs off to fetch
the obstinate cows in, and Mum is going off
the handle because she has to leave the
kitchen, and the girl is cursing her luck be-
cause she can’t go to tennis, up tears the
lorry. Mum is hustled off the milking-stool.
Dad is put on the fence to smoke, the girl
is shown how simple it is to manipulate the
machine. It’s a pound to a gooseberry a
sale is made the moment Dad realises how he
can run the herd “without th’ damned boys.’

“Wildflower,” the ‘ musical play” which
has succeeded “The Cousin from Nowhere”
at Sydney Royal, is placed in the perpen-
dicular scenery of Lombardy, and opens with
a discharge of musketry : but any fear that
the thing might develop into a Fascist melo-
drama is dispelled by the production of a
dead pullet, which is the only tragedy that
darkens the evening. The murder of the
pullet gives Marie Burke, as Nina Benedetto,
the opportunity of flying into a tantrum,
tantrums being hereditary in the Benedetto
family—the fact that they are hereditary in
all Italian families doesn’t matter. Nina
is good at tantrums, and she looks diaboli-
cally beautiful in them, so she hates to have
to give them' up. However, being left a
large fortune (in Italian paper money) by
a grandfather on the condition that she re-
frains from indulging the family failing for
six months, she draws on reserves of sweet
reasonableness hitherto unsuspected, and de-
feats the machinations of Fted Mackay,
Charles Zoli and Marie La Varre, who stand
to benefit by grandpa’s will if she defaults.
Having behaved in an exemplary manner
for the prescribed period, Nina waits for
the stroke of midnight and then flies off the
handle worse than ever. There is a love
romance between Nina and Guido (Herbert
Browne) mixed up in this, but it gets dis-
entangled before the last tram, leaving the
lovers at the point from which Shakspeare
started his “Taming of the Shrew.”
Not that the American playwrights re-
sponsible for the play worried about that
aspect of the thing. The logic and consis-
tency of Gilbert and Sullivan, who stood
things on their heads to show how real they
were, are old-fashioned these days. Never-
theless “Wildflower” is the best specimen
of trans-Pacific flora that has been brought
over to this side for some time. The music
is pleasant, the costumes are striking, and
the tableaux, including a live donkey and
an apple-tree which beats the mango trick
“TONS OF MONEY” AT MELBOURNE

hollow by bursting into several varieties of
blossom without the cloth being drawn, are
effective. Marie Burke, with a handsome
face, a flamboyant manner and an adequate
voice, is splendidly in place as the congenital
spitfire, and uses the “bambalina,” an Italian
dance with Dutch affinities, with dramatic
effect. Herbert Browne, as Guido, is the
first flapper hero this Sundry Showman has
seen, and is a pleasing contrast to the
elderly, beef-fed, horsey-looking person who
usually takes such parts; his baritone voice
is so nice that the orchestra is jealous of it.
Charles Zoli, as Gaston La Roche, an
allegedly comic lawyer, made the most of
an assortment of gags selected from one of
tlio popular anthologies of after-dinner wit.
Gus Bluett gave a genuinely humorous por-
trayal, expressed mainly in dumb show, ot
a melancholy schoolmaster hugging a hope-
less passion for the glittering ISina. His
duct, “The World’s Worst Women, sung
with Marie La Varre, was a comic master-
piece.
The Arundel Orchard-Gregan McMahon
production of Rutland Boughton’s music-
drama, “The Immortal Hour,” which intro-
duced Sydney on Saturday to the spirit
world of Ireland, is highly commendable.
The music is very beautiful, strangely remi-
niscent of Wagner’s “Parsifal” and “Lohen-
grin” at times in the grouping of strings ;
some of the themes are quite grand, and there
are haunting, simple melodies of Irish folk-
songs. The orchestral work was sufficiently fin-
ished to suggest that the instrumentalists were
at their best, and the chorus of spirits and
warriors was excellent. Harry Tollcmache
carried off honors among the principals for fine
dramatic singing, and Miss Millie Hughes
as Etain, the Immortal who found the world
wanting, was a charming figure, quite equal
vocally to the demands made by the com-
poser. Alfred G. Steel was Dalna, the
shadow of pale hopes, singing correctly but
weightily ; and Molyneux Phillips, looking like
a silver “Boy Blue,” displayed rather pre-
sentable limbs, but an unpleasant voice as
Midir, who leads Etain back to the Immor-
tal world. Daphne Deane was responsible
for effective dances and chorus groupings,
and -the whole was fascinatingly set. The
ambitious season ends next Saturday. It
is so far quite a happy one. The State Oon-
servatorium of Music and the Repertory
Theatre Society share honors of the pro-
duction.
“Ship me somewhere east of Suez” was a
Kipling Tommy’s cry. But a cheaper,
quicker passage you may book at Sydney
Cri. for the vague, alluring region where no
Ten Commandments are, and the moths their
wings are singeing in the flame of Muriel
Starr.

At Sydney Opera House the festive career
of “Broadway Jones” terminates to morrow
night. After re-inflating his tyres, the versa-
tile Seymour Hicks will hurl himself and
Ellaline Terris into the adapted-from-the-
Frencli “Sleeping Partners,” with a glimpse
of Dickens’s “Scrooge” for a curtain-raiser.
# * * *
“Betty,” at Sydney Majesty’s, continues to
display the gilded halls, also the servants’
ditto, of Britain’s old nobility with such
accompaniments of song and leg-kicking as
musical comedy demands. A few such hilari-
ous peers as Alfred Frith would do a lot to
brighten up the House of Lords and avert its
abolition.

Charlotte Parry, who is on her last lap
at Sydney Tivoli, presented a new turn
called “Into the Light” last Saturday night
that gave further proof of her protean pow-
ers. The nimble-footed Rich and Galvin are
an entertaining pair so long as they keep to
their simultaneous dancing—it is only when
one of them approaches the footlights and
begins to sing that one prays for the cur-
tain to fall —hard. There is plenty of ginger
about Rosie Lloyd, who has the more pious
of the single young men wishing they had
left their best-girl at home. Broughton and
Creedon are a likeable couple, and Scott and
Whaley bring the house down with their
exceptionally amusing act, “The Counsel for
the Defence.”
Fullers’ Theatre, Sydney, is sheltering the
Dorror dancers and operatic singers. Accord-
ing to the press-agents they are Roumanians
who narrowly missed being eaten alive by
whiskered Reds; but it hasn’t damaged their
limb-twirling and vocal acrobatics. Stiffy
and Mo, who need no thrilling stories of
sensational escapes to draw their crowds,
are as popular as ever; and Dan Thomas
is a pantomime dame who is wise in all the
wheezes of the trade.

“Her Marriage Vow” is being sworn at
Sydney Lyceum. The wife upbraids her hus-
band for neglecting her for his business, and
turns to a fast set for companionship. She
is driven out by her husband, but her mater-
nal devotion compels her to creep back one
stormy night to see if her kiddies have had
their necks washed. The result is just what
it ought to be at the Lyceum. A theological
student runs amok at the Lyric; and at the
Crystal Palace “Captain Blood,” the admiral
of a frowsy fleet of pirate ships, saves Eng-
land from invasion. “The Dangerous
Blonde,” Hoyt’s dimpled, blue-eyed vamp, is
having a lot of catty remarks passed about
her coiffure by jealous brunettes —but what
does she care when a millionaire a minute
falls to her charms? It is not often that
the forewoman of a canning factory turns
into a first-class singer, but it happens to
the heroine of “Triumph,” at the Globe.
“The Cyclone Rider” does his riding at the
Empress; and “The Ten Commandments”
are still at the Prince Edward, where the
fountain plays in the foyer and a thousand-
guinea chandelier is suspended over the heads
of the dress-circle. “Chu Chin Chow” con-
tinues to do great business at the Palace.
About an imported show: —
There are few surprises in the collection of
etchings, litnographs and wood-cuts from Czecho-
slovakia at present showing at Swain’s Galleries,
Sydney, but there is some sound and interesting
work. J. Rambousek depicts the terrible ordinariness
of Czecho-Slovakian suburbia ; he draws with a stark
realism and an economy of line that local producers
of pretty conventionalities might well study. J.
Konupek has a series of nine diagrams of his emo-

Immortal Hour”

mache).
tional reaction to the horrors of Shakspeare’s “Mac-
beth.” J. Stretti Zaniponi’s “Snowed-in Village” is
good to look on these summer days, and T. F.
Simon finds frozen moisture easy to handle, too.
The latter gentleman was all the rage in Paris in
1920 and commanded big prices: the prices asked for
his work and others in this show are remarkably
modest. Czerho-Slovakia has probably never heard
of Norman Lindsay; certainly none of these exponents
of Czecho-Slovakian art have his power of mixing
saints, devils, fauns, nymphs and satyrs into one
infernal stew and making a composition of it; nor
has one of them thought of using his etching needle
with the contemptuous ease of Norman Lindsay, as
if it were a pen.

The gallery-girls made another early assem-
bly to greet the revival of the popular
“Merry Widow” at Melbourne Majesty’s last
Saturday, and were mainly responsible for
another very late session. The eagerness of
some managements to recognise the demand
for encores begins to grow tiresome. As
Sonia, the widow whose 20 millions is of
vast importance to the State of Marsovia,
Gladys Moncrieff displayed a voice which
has acquired a little extra polish during her
absence from Australia, and was otherwise
a deserving character. Howett Worster, who
is developing a staginess which makes his
performances less convincing than they
should be, was a passable Prince Danilo;
and William Perryman took himself with in-
tenseseriousness as Vicomte Camillede Jolidon.
Arthur Stigant pervaded the piece, spilling
puns and other bits of humor and near-
humor in a manner that drew laughs; and
Bryl Walkley was a pleasing though color-
less Natalie. Of the others, John Ralston
deserves mention. An interesting item was
a duet dance by Tom Moore and Hazel
Meldrum, whose entrance was made an ocen-
sion for an extra-special outbreak on the part
of a sentimental audience.
❖ * *
For the final spasm of the short J. D.
O’Hara season, at Melbourne Royal, where
Muscovitch is to open at the end of next
week (December 13), “Lightnin’” was put
up on Saturday night. The cast is not as
•good as the earlier one, the difference being
in the minor characters. As the old waster,
Lightnin’ Bill Jones, J. D. O’Hara was as
lovable as ever, and Maggie Moore made
him a good partner. But a mistake was
made in fitting Harvey Adams with the part
of John Marvin; he was too elderly a youth.
Nor was Ailsa Grahame, as Margaret Davis,
sufficiently well versed in the art of vamping
to represent the character convincingly.
And finally George Blunt played Lemuel
Townsend on broad comedy lines, getting
laughs where he might easily have scored
points for finer work.
* * * *
“Aren't We All?” is to run another week
at Melbourne King’s; then “The Truth
About Blayds” will be published to an ex-
pectant world of first-nighters.
Last Saturday Melbourne rolled up in
great force to make the farewell of popular
Dot Brunton memorable, aud converted the
stage into a flower-garden for the presenta-
tion of the good-bye speeches. Gross darkness
falls on the New Palace until December 20,
when the “Cinderella” panto will dawn with
gorgeous effects.
** * *
The electrics will again sparkle in front of
the New Palace (Melbourne), on December
20, for “The Midnight Frolics,” which,
according to the proclamation, is a show of
“speed, spice and sparkle.” Other new
shows due to arrive in time for the Christmas
festivities include Josie Melville in “Good
Morning, Dearie,” at His Majesty’s, and
Muscovitch in “The Merchant of Venice at
the Royal.
❖ ❖ $
Melbourne Tivoli has added to its attrac-
tions the expert toes of Williams and Taylor,
and the Hadji Ivader Arabs, whose former
appearance was at the Royal, contribute to a
programme of whirl. Van Cello helps by
juggling tubs in the air with his feet, and the
rest of the bill is good without being con-
spicuous.
** * *
Possibly Mexico does no less mad things
than the Con Moreni Revue Co. suggests at
Melbourne Bijou. The idea of arranging an
exchange of utilities between the Government
(which has ammunition but no guns) and
the revolutionaries (who have guns but no
ammunition), so that the peace-tired people
can have the revolution necessary to make
them happy is a good one. In the part of
the show which isn’t revue Howard and
Wyndham provide some good dancing.

“Borrowed Husbands” is showing Mel-
bourne Majestic audiences all the things that
the parasitical American woman can do to
the man who has helped, and is helping,, to
make her a parasite. The humorless origi-
nators probably did not intend it to be the
satire it is. “The Sixth Commandment” is
a supporting film. Hoyt’s De Luxe shows
Barbara Le Marr in “The White Moth” —a
lady who dances around the flames which, of
course, always exist in Paris —and a rather
pleasing drama of the Kentucky hill country
in “The Hill Billy.”
Allen Doone ended his season at Adelaide
Royal by a strong reversion to the Irish type
which he had for a time deserted in favor of
American farce. His sobbing on Mother’s
grave was very strong indeed. A startling
chanee is now bringing in “Good Morning,
Dearie,” and the sudden rise of the virtuous
working-girl. George Wallace continues his
hearty (but occasionally reckless) fun at
the Majestic. In pictures, “Going T 7 p,” at
West’s, is a delight. Douglas McLean s un-
willing aviator is much more like the Prince
of Wales than like Frith; but seldom has a
film brought such continuous laughter as is
heard when his ’plane runs wild, and scares
off the course not only the other competitor
but the judges. Wondergraph and York are
dramatic and intense, the latter having Chap-
lin’s “Paris” play, in which he does not

Browne) say it in dance-steps.
appear himself. And the coming of summer
—on the calendar only—is marked by a Wil-
liamsonian venture of Humphrey Bishop’s
light co. in the open at the Exhibition garden.
The Woman’s Mirror —The Bulletin’s
flapper daughter—will next week contain,
besides the serial story by Ethel Turner and
interesting short stories, articles about “The
Care of the Piano.” “Woman and the Motor-
car” and “Home Decoration.” The current
week’s issue, besides the household and health
and beauty hints that are in every issue, has
an article on “The Mistress, the Maid and
the Law,” by a barrister-at-law. There is a
free paper-pattern with every issue and a
dozen or so dress designs. It is an extraordi-
nary three-penn’orth.

"Adelaide”: “V. Louis.” writer of the
lyrics for the musical version of “Tons of
Money’’ in Australia, is V. L. Solomon, son
of the late politician of the same name who
represented the N.T. in the S.A. Assembly
when the two were attached, and was Premier
for just a week in the old days of chop-and-
ehange Ministries.
“Lud”: “Primrose” (B. 20/11/’24) has
been acquired by J. C. Williamson, Ltd., for
Australia. It is the latest London Winter
Garden success, and with it will come Maude
Fane, who, swearing that she would ne’er
consent to revisit the glimpses of the foot-
lights in these parts, has, of course con-
sented. So the little farm in Brixton—or
was it Crouch End?—will have to get along
without its fair proprietress for at least a
year.
“Charlik” states a case:—
The late *l. O. Williamson, on being remonstrated
with for having dropped an Australian priina donna
in comic opera in favor of an English girl, said
WASTED COURTESY.
FIRST ACTOR: “So we er-play without an
orchestra to-night? Tell me the er-
storrry!”
SECOND ACTOR: “When he came in I ashed
him to take a chair. But it was the
pi-ah-no he wanted, because, forsooth,
we hadn't paid for it!”
“Australians don’t like Australians!” In that faith
he imported leading lady after leading lady. Some
were fairly successful, others were tolerated, but
not one could be compared to her advantage with
Australia’s own. Nellie Stewart, dear departed Flo
Young, Carrie Moore, Gladys Moncrieff, Dot Brunton,
Josie Melville and others have proved that Australian
girls in opera and musical comedy are equal, if not
superior, to the world’s best. The old prejudice is
dying as regards the ladies, but what about the men ?
A few have certainly justified their artistic existence,
but they have had to go overseas to do it. O. P.
Heggie and vocalists Peter Dawson, Alfred O’Shea,
Shepherd and others were admired here, pleasantly
patted, and that was all. A mediocre performer
from overseas cleverly boomed will score greatly over
a consummate artist locally produced but inade-
quately advertised. Now for what I have been
leading up to. Everyone who goes to the theatre
knows J. B. Atholwood. His performances are always
appreciated by playgoers anl adequately recorded
by the press. I have never met Mr. Atholwood,
strange to say, therefore I can be acquitted of any
personal feeling; but why has it not occurred ro
J.C.W., Ltd., that Atholwood would give an inter-
pretation of the character of the Indian Prince in
“The Green Goddess” quite equal if not superior
to the performance of Mr. Guy Bates Post —fine artist
though the latter gentleman undoubtedly is? If
we are forced to have imported plays, let us have
Australian actors to play them. The plays would
not suffer.
“Double Bass” : Yes, true bass voices are
very rare. In my experience of over 40
years in Melbourne I have known only four
fit for solo work in public—those of "Bat”
Maroney, Walter Jones, Walter Barker and
Gordon-Gooch. I am referring to local sing-
ers, of course. Jones had the most excep-
tional range, extending from the low C to E
natural, two octaves and a third. lie sang
the songs mentioned by “Charlik” (B.
20/11/’24) in the original key.
“Senex”: Had he lived long enough to
hear from them, “J.F.11.” (B. 23/10/’24i
would have found quite a number of
Australians who remember Walter Mont-
gomery. I was not by many the youngest
boy in the “Select Academy” in my home
town when Walter gave recitals in the inter-
vals between his more serious dramatic work.
The cult of Shakspeare in those days was.
I think, more keen in the schools than it is
to-day, and when a star like Montgomery
condescended to go into the provincial towns
all the small boys and girls were ranged in
lines and marched off to hear the gifted
actor recite. A great favorite on the Mont-
gomery programme was Poe’s “The Bells,”
in which various kinds, from the assertive
little Metliody bell to the chimes of the
sledge bells, were illustrated; and I, can re-
member how for days after the great man's
visit we were “bell, bell, belling” each other,
from growling bass to ear wracking falsetto,
till the headmaster suppressed the business
as a nuisance.
From the ninepenny seats :
Cunningham, Federal M.H.R. for Gwydir (N.S.W.),
says that “the persistency with which the Minister
for Customs is harassing the picture industry in
Australia is causing great concern to those who have
invested their capital in picture-shows.” Picture-
industry? There is no picture industry in Aus-
tralia. The so-called “industry” is really an import-
ing business of huge dimensions, and 9:3 p.c. of the
goods are American. However, there is going to
be a picture industry in Australia, Cunningham and
other squealers notwithstanding. The Diggers have
determined that. At the R.S.L.’s Federal Congress
in Adelaide, after some plain Australian speech
about Hollywood offal, it was resolved that the
issue of showmen’s licenses ought to be conditional on
the programmes being 50 p.c. British and Australian.
And the good Australians of the Brisbane branch
have not only kept banging away at the Government
and the Tariff Board in the interest of Australian
films, but are lending financial support to the com-
pany which is out to make pictures in Queensland.
Apropos, Theodore’s State, with its mellow climate
and its variety of scenery and human types, is an
ideal country for picture-production, and in “Steele
Rudd,” Randolph Bedford, Mrs. Forrest and others
the scenario-writers are ready waiting. Also, there
is material for capital photo-plays in the humorous
lines of Brunton Stephens and in such verses as
“The Women of the West” and “Where the Pelican
Builds Its Nest” —indeed, admirable two-reelers,
which would probably find a world-market, could be
made by adequately “picturising” the two poems
nu ntione'd, “The Sick Stockrider” and scores like
them.
“Clos V.” : Comic opera lias already taken
tribute of the vegetable garden (B.
20/11/’24). During the war the 51st (High-
land) Division ran (for 12 months, to my
knowledge) an excellent opera called “Turnip
Tops,” written, libretto and score, by a staff-
officer who had been producer in a big Lon-
don theatre —the Haymarket, I think. The
show had a plot, real humor, discreet allusive
gags, and bright, tuneful music—any man of
the 51st will remember “Popocatapetl”—and
with more elaborate mounting and staging
would be just as successful as most of the
stuff we import from London and Noo Yoick.
One of my men, by the way, was whistling
the pretty air I mention when he was blown
to bits beside me. Its composer, too, I re-
member for the “spot” he gave me in the
sclioolhouse at Moussy the night before we
hopped over at the second Battle of the
Marne. Should this meet his eye he’ll know
his good deed is not forgotten.
“B.B.”: Harry Jewett (B. 20/11/’24 and
27./11/’24) left Australia for America soon
after the divorce proceedings which separated
him from his then wife, Maggie Knight. One
of his early engagements in the States was
in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”—he' was Simon
I.egree to the Uncle Tom of Peter Jackson.
Harry, knowing how much negroes resent
being called “nigger,” baulked at using the
word when at rehearsal he had to apply
it to Peter. But the great master of ring-
craft grinned. “Say it, Mr. Jewett,” he
urged. “I won't take it .as personal.” So
Harry said it.
“B.B.”: I remember that frosty grand-
opera season in Sydney Lyceum at Christ-
mas, 1898. Bert Bailey, as “F.Y.Iv.” states
(B. 27/11/’24), was in the cast of ‘‘Car-
men,” but it wasn’t his only essay in grand
opera. He appeared, and not discreditably
either, in the subsequent productions of
“Maritana” and “The Bohemian Girl.” By
the way, the tenor of the ill-fated season
was Clarrie Leumane, who was the Faust
to Federici’s Mephisto when the latter
dropped dead just as the twain were sup-
posed to be descending into Hell. Another
member of the Lyceum cast was Lulu Zesch,
afterwards a favorite in vaudeville.
“Quero”: Re musical accompaniments,
appropriate and not quite so, I recollect the
case of a departing Governor, a gay old sport
with a keen eye for a trim ankle, who was
farewelled with “The Girl I Left Behind
Me.” Her Ex. was leaning over the steamer
rail, and it was evident from the sudden
fading of her smile as the familiar tune
floated up that the band’s choice confirmed
her worst suspicions.
“F.L.H.”: Who in recent years has heard
a solo on the double bass? Ceschina used to
play ’em at old-time concerts in Melbourne
"WHOA UP, LIZZIE! IT'S ONLY A FUTURIST'S
DRAWRIN'!"
•■Hid Sydney ; lie made the big instrument sing
like a 'cello and bowed it with the lightness
of a Heifetz. Another bass virtuoso was
Arthur Howell, the comic man with the
Lyster Opera Co. of 1878. At a concert in
Adelaide Howell showed his skill with the
“dog-house,” Cescliina, by the way, lending
him his bass. There were two or three
generations of Howells known in Fogland as
’cellists and contrabassists.
“Ibsenshaw” : Though not in need of boost-
ing, for it is drawing fine audiences, “Aren’t
We All?” at the Melbourne King’s got a
good advt, from one of the clergy the other
day. The rev. gent., while eulogising the
comedy, asked why the cloth should be
caricatured to such an extent in one of its
principal characters. The Argus, in a
leaderette, sententiously explained that it
was all a question of “comic relief,” and
concluded by saying: “After all, most people
realise that it is never wise to take the
theatre too seriously.” Maybe. But it would
do no harm if some people—and especially
newspapers and their critics—took it a little
more seriously. We might get better plays
then.
“Glen Elg” : In a communication to a Lon-
don theatrical journal Bransby Williams, the
Dickens entertainer, chats about his experi-
ences _in Australia during his Tivoli tour,
summing up the capitals according to the
way his efforts were received in them, which
is a way stage performers have. Thus Syd-
ney is “a real city with a real audience”;
Adelaide, on the other hand, he compares
with an English cathedral town so far as
its appreciation of variety shows is con-
cerned —in fact, there is “great opposition
to vaudeville there.” This will be news to
the Fuller firm, which has had a variety
theatre giving two shows a day in Adelaide’s
principal thoroughfare for years.
Re lachrymose ditties (B.
1-j/11/ 24), can anyone tell me the style
or title of a morccau I heard a Cockney
sergeant sing at a camp concert? The
haunting refrain, which moved even the
strongest to tears, is with me yet:—

"Flaming Youth” : There had been a row
over a demand for increased salaries, and
my friend the s.-m. gazed bitterly at the
well-d reused mummers who were drifting
away from the rehearsal. “They think of
nothing but clothes!” he snorted. “Twenty
years ago your people came along to re-
hearsals looking as if they had got their
clothes by raiding the second-hand shops.
They looked like a lot of brigands, but they
could act. Now they are a lot of brigands,
and they can’t act.”
“Hamfat”: Australia was visited just be-
fore the war by a pretentious English pro-
vincial actor, a sort of starved and acid
Crummies, who would have added to tin-
gaiety of the profession had not the “awful
salaries” he found he would have to pay
driven him home again. He told the busi-
ness managers with whom he discussed tin
prospects of a country tour that lie expected
to get leads for 80s. per week, and another
pound for bed and board. Charlie McMahon,
always ready for some venture which would
enable him to jerk his cuffs on the house
front, interviewed him. “I assure you, Mr.
McMahon,” said the thin Crummies, speak-
ing of his star “drummer,” “that in every
theatre where I have played this piece the
gallery has been in tears.” “Yes,” retorted
Charlie, “of course the gallery was in tiers;
but was there anybody on them?”
“Hamfat”; That shell-shocked soldier who
tried to throw himself from the gallery at
Melbourne King’s (B. 20/11/’24) has since
explained that the mention of Egypt in
the play excited maddening memories of his
sufferings. I remember a case of a similar
awakening in a man who, as one of the sur-
vivors of a shipwreck, had,
before help came, been re-
duced to thoughts of canni-
balism. The theatre was the
Royal, Christchurch (M.L.) ;
the play “The Term of His
Natural Life” ; and Gabbett
( Henry Douglas), Rex
(Mario Majeroni) an d
Veitch (“Hamfat”) were
doing the cannibalistic
scene when we were in-
terrupted by a man who
yelled : “If you kill that poor
man, by God I’ll kill you!”
and tried to rush the stage.
Held back by members of the
orchestra and thrust into a
seat, he dropped his head
into his hands as the scene,
after the laughter subsided,
proceeded; but when Gab-
bett took a bite at Veitch’s
arm he arose again. “You
beast!” he screamed, in a
frenzy. After that he was
led out, and his story ex-
tracted. Fifteen years after-
wards, in the last year of the
war, I was telling some stage
yarns in a tent on the French
front. The man beside me rose when I had
finished and told this one without men-
tioning the names, which he had forgot-
ten until I recalled them. He had been the
limelight operator at the Royal at the time
of the incident.
“Billo C. ’: They do things pretty swiftly
on- and off-stage at times, as, f’rinstance,
in the writing of letters; but Shaw, in “Saint
.Toan, ’ beats all records for brevity. Joan
is led out to the stake, and while the horrible
business is going on certain remorseful
parties hold the stage. Then the executioner
enters to report that his gruesome job has
been done —the body completely incinerated
(except the heart, which, according to legend,
would not burn) and the ashes thrown into
the river. All in less time than in our house-
hold it takes to make cinders of a chop.
“Philm Up” : Who says the movie adver-
tisements are not elevating? Why, there’s a
picture being shown in Sydney, “featuring”
rsorma Talmadge, the proprietors of' which
have issued an “appeal” by that lady “against
the cancer of divorce that is eating its way
into the homes of the world!” Says Norma
who writes nearly as well as she acts:
•Civilisation to-day is thundering towards
the orisis that must come if men and women
stoop from the high estate ordained in mar-
riage.” Delicious! And every other Los
Angeles picture-star has just been divorced
or is just going to be.
When yon come to reckon them np there
are an astonishing number of people in Aus-
tralia who have successful books to their
credit. No less than forty of them are repre-
sented in the Christmas Bulletin, to be
published on December 13. J. H. M. Abbott
contributes the most humorous story he has
ever written ; the only long unpublished poem
that Henry Lawson left behind him will now
be given to the public; James Edmond has
a story, full of sparkle, of some experiences
in Palestine; and David Wright, E. J. Brady,
Steele Rudd, Mary Gilmore, Edward Dyson,
Conor O’Brien. Will Lawson, Hugh McCrae.
the late Frank Morton and half a hundred
others are represented. The number is at
least equal to the best Christmas Bulletin
ever issued: the verse is not as good as it
has been sometimes, but the other sections
are exceptionally strong.
The 1925 issue of the Commercial Travel-
lers’ Australia To-day is interesting and
informative and full of excellent illustrations.
The full-page colored supplement is a sample
of A. E. Newbury at his best.
THE CUE. THAT WASN’T.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The youthful lovers embraced up stage, where the
limelight played dead-centre ;
And the villain was grinding his teeth at the wings,
awaiting his cue to enter ;
1 or the lovers up stage were sweethearts off, and the
show they’d completely forgotten
In that moment of bliss in the mimic scene! But
the villain growled, “Cripes, this is rotten!
I can t go on till I get the d —d words.” And he
cursed at such “amateur mumming.”
1 hen the voice of the prompter was heard with the
line, “Hush, love ! 1 hear somebody coming.”
Still the couple, unheeding, spoonily kissed, an I
the gods were beginning to “bird” ’em ;
\\ hile the prompter, fast losing his temper, once more
with a roar like a bull, tried to “word” ’em:
‘ ‘Hush, love! I hear somebody coming.’ You
fools!” Here the “juvenile” looked up, dis-
tra< ted,
I hen gaped at the maiden; she gaped back at him
—their one scene convincingly acted.
Hush, love!” yet again came the tip from the
side, and the youth did his best to obey it.
I know, yes, I know,” he despairingly cried;
“but which of us two has to say itf”

EVERY Perdriau Tyre- be it Master
Cord, Semi Balloon or Standard
Balloon is made on the one Balloon
principle of low pressure. Unequalled
success has been the reward of this
Perdriau pioneer movement started
many years ago.
To-day the Tyre World recognises
the necessity for low pressure in
absorbing road shocks, imparting
greater comfort and increasing
chassis life.
The exhilaration of riding on
Perdriau Balloon Tyres and
the boon of perfed comfort, is
equalled only by the pleasure
of knowing that the cost is less
than that of similar equipment
offered by other makers, who
now follow the original Perdriau
lead.
A guarantee basis of 5000 miles
is issued with every Perdriau
(The alterations shewn against each size
will fit that particular rim)

V/s,
if you demand good roads to make transport easier and less costly, why not exercise still
further economy by modernising your Waggons with SKF Ball-bearing Axles, and so save
"horse energy”?
These axles eliminate friction and “drag” from horse-drawn vehicles to suc-h an extent that
one horse can draw the usual two-horse load and still keep “condition” better than before.
One horse out of three can easily be dispensed with, and the same loads handled in the same
time.
SKF BALL-BEARING AXLES cut out “strains” at the start, on the level and over the hill.
Make the change without delay, as, due to decreased production costs, we have made a
SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION 1 IN PRICES OF
SKF
BALL-BEARING AXLES.
This means that the cost of conversion will be lower, and this factor, together with the
increased haulage and the prolongation of your horses’ working life, will result in a greater
distinct money-saving. WRITE FOR PARTICULARS AND PRICES NOW.

J arrah: Words, words, words; and not
an ounce of feeling in a hogshead of them....E.M.E.:
“Missing” is pleasantly told, but very conventional.
....Tom R. Hah: “Sport”-“naught” for an ear-
distressing rhyme to start with, and the rest isn t
g00d.... Roti: Thin ; and when it is finished we don’t
know your characters any better than we did at
tlie start... .P.M.H.; Hardly earns its space....
M.0.C.; No use for that brand of wild and whirling
stuff. Bad things are not necessarily wrongs....
C.M.H.: Sorry they miss; “Blossoming of a Fool”
got nearest... .S.F.F.; Haven’t the space for the
fruitless wrangle that it would provoke... .R.R.:
As you say, the story is different. Unfortunately it
is also indifferent. .. .Medicus; Strong; in fact, too
strong J.8.W.; Cuthbert is killed E.M.8.:
Too melodramatic. ... D.H.P.; You call it “A drama
of life.” It reads like a burlesque. .. .J.H.M.; Ghost
is laid and will not rise again... .H.E.L.J.: Theory
of love being a secretion of the liver might be sub-
mitted to a gastronomical society.... A.R.Y.: Better
suited for Christmas number of some religious maga-
zine. .. . W.C. : Situation has dramatic interest, but the
story is not up to standard. .. .M.F.; All lovers are
liars. Your truth is better than your fiction....
Zack; Your new chum with the same old snakes and
mosquitoes is too old a chum. .. .A. 8.; You commence
with a sentence of 77 words and leave it without a
predicate....H.; (i) Adelaide; (2) the Azores;
(3) this is his third trip W.W.L.S.; Doesn't
cover the ground... .L.T. (Wynnum) : Sorry, but
none of them get near... .Doris H.: It is all badly
out of step. .. . R.C.R.: Not a very good parody of
stuff that is particularly easy to parody... .C.N.
(Wayville); It has a hint of something, but the
method of telling is poor and the verse has many
faults... .T.H.D.; No tuning up could make them
worth while. . . .A.N.G.1.: The poppies have been
written to death; the other seems to have things
badly mixed. . . .M.McD.; The painful yarn is not for
us F.H.8. : It is only a monotonous jangle of
words to say something which has been often said
better... .L.M. (Tallangatta): A gentle little idea
in crude form May A.; A lot more skill is
needed. .. .Ripponlea; Now this is heroic:—
Around a hovel
Some water did grovel
As the Heavens did burst into tears ;
O’er a celery top
A slug did flop,
Anil some cabbages flapped their ears.
O’er a platter o’ pork
Some Chows did talk
And toy with a jugful o’ gin,
When one, with a squawk
Hit the roof like a cork
And returned with a ghastly ghrin.
With a horrible roar
He collapsed on the floor,
With a grizzly smirk
They set to work
And planted him near some beet.
Now cnion roots play
Where his watch-chain once lay,
And lie’s pushing up spuds with his feet.
D.P.M.; All have freshnev and are well on
the way; but they. say very little and the metre
stumbles too often T..T.0.; Needs a lot of sand-
papering. .. .E.M.S.; Thin as a rag that’s been in
the family for years. .. . Akran: Nothing in it that
hasn’t been better handled F.C.W.8.; Not enough
marrow in their bones.... M.M. (Semaphore): What’s
the use of saying you want to sing? If you are
hungry you don’t merely go on ringing the breakfast-
bell .... Bulimba; Too slight C.T.C.D. : The
Journey is not eventful. .. .E.M.E.; The Witch falls
over her own broomstick too often 8.E.8.; The
form is only fair; the subject matter is strained;
the whole is unittractive Boronia; Too slight.
. ...G.S.A.: The nameless verse beginning “Where
hawthorns break the breeze’s power” gets near, but
has too many commonplaces. The others are inconspicu-
ous. ... A. M.J. : Try to iron out the metre a little.

drawing-room song in poor verse Barnacle Bill :
Too many splinters in it W.G.C.: You have no
yarn to tell; and any yarn would be ruined in
verse as bad as that.... Vera H.: Both “Soliloquy”
and “Long Last” were just on the edge... .Jona-
than ; The verse is fair, but the path has been
worn into ruts.... Dry: You’re better on the prose.
.... Coburg : The chief trouble is that, after these
union officials have been a few years at the job,
they are not fit for much else, and thereafter, in
dread of losing their billets, they tell the crowd
not what they know to be the truth, but what they
believe the noisiest part of the crowd wants to hear,
it is much the same with the member of Parliament,

“Lex”: An Adelaide Court has decided
that the blunt speech of Mrs. A to Mr. B,
“I have accused your wife of having cotn-
iuitted adultery with my husband, and ]
have absolute proof of it,” could be untrue yet
not necessarily slander, as Mrs. B claimed.
The Bench put it this way: Mrs. B’s htis-
band had gone to Mrs. A on a “fishing ex-
pedition” for evidence against his wife;
therefore it was a privileged occasion for
freedom of speech.

“Zantlius”: Australia’s pioneer air service,
from Perth to Derby (W.A.), is likely to be
extended to Wyndliam, via Hall’s Creek,
before long. A flying man has already been
over the route picking out landing-places.
This will bring the terminus of the flight
close up to the border of the Northern Terri-
tory. and if Lieutenants Fysh and
McGuiness carry out their pet project of
extending the Queensland service from Clon-
curry to Darwin it will not take much to
bridge the whole north of Australia aerially.

“Gil Gunnia”: The strike at Castle Creek
(Q.), where 250 men downed tools, has
hung up Queensland’s pet irrigation scheme
for the present, the Government having closed
down the works. Castle Creek is an Arca-
dian spot on the Upper Dawson, where pro-
ceedings were enlivened lately by a visit from
Governor Nathan and by an arbor day. The
township boasts a fine bandstand, but no
band as yet. An experimental farm is in
full swing where several sorts of alfalfa,
millet, rye and the like are growing luxuri-
antly, watered by irrigation ditches. It is
an oasis in an enormous valley hitherto de-
voted to cattle-raising, though doubts are
sometimes expressed as to how all the pro-
duce will be disposed of when the scheme is
really launched.

“Nitric”: The utility of the aeroplane for
the destruction of insect pests is recognised
in America, where poison-dust ’planes are
being employed by the Department of Agri-
culture to attack the boll-weevil pest with
calcium arsenate. Also they spray swamp
areas, otherwise inaccessible, with solutions
of Paris green and Tripoli earth to kill off
the malarial mosquito. These ’planes can
treat an acre of ground with 21b. of solution,
whereas ordinary spraying takes three times
the amount. In South Africa, too, the locust
is being tackled from aloft with a poison
spray of bran and confetti. In Brisbane,
however, householders are still being invited
to provide open tubs and utilise gold-fish to
destroy the mosquito larvae ! And when aero-
plane spraying was suggested to make things
unpleasant for the priekly-pear in inacces-
sible areas the idea was ridiculed.
* * * *
“Landa”: The old meatworks at Ramor-
nie (North Coast, N.S.W.) are in the
hands of the auctioneer. The concern
was started close-up to a century ago, ami
in the palmy days of army contracts cattle
were slaughtered and tinned as fast as knives
could cut them up. working in three shifts.
Sailing-vessels loaded at Grafton with meat
from the works and wool from the table-
lands and headed straight for London. Re-
frigerators, centralisation and the Meat
Industry Act of 1915, which proscribes the
sale of. meat unless slaughtered at Home-
bush, killed the old-established enterprise.

“T.J.M.”: In writing of dry yeast as “a
sort of by-product of Prohibition” (B.
2/10/’24) “X2X” ignores the fact that 35
years ago it was being delivered daily at
the London bakeries. Compressed yeast was
originally manufactured on the Continent,
principally in Holland, and imported into
Britain for bakers’ use. Although it is now
manufactured in large quantities in England,
and is a product of the Distillers Company.
Ltd., of Edinburgh, about 15,000 cwt. is still
imported into the United Kingdom monthly.
Compressed yeast has been manufactured in
Melbourne and Sydney for about 15 years
Past, and also at a factory in Christchurch
(M.L.). It is not a by-product: in the
manufacture of yeast, vinegar or spirits are
the by-product. There were very large manu-
facturers of compressed yeast in America
long before Prohibition came along. The use
of yeast medicinally is a matter for doctors,
but even brewer’s yeast is known to have
beneficial qualities as a blood-purifier.
MY LORD THE SHEEP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“An absolute record for the Sydney market was
set up last week when 491 and. was given for greasy
merino fleece.”-
Let Eurythmics and Gloamings in stake money score
Such totals as never were landed before,
And clip, all oblivious of weather and weights,
Split-seconds off times for the Cups and the Plates.
Let borse-lovers, hoarse with idolatry, claim
For Davids and Beaufords perennial fame.
Let Cockiedom whoop as the lacteal yield
Of some super-phenomenal cow is revealed.
But while bouquets you heap on these prodigies, keep
A bit of blue ribbon to pin on the sheep,
The real Big Cass in the fauna casino ;
“Four bob and three ha’pence for greasy merino” !
Of the limelight his share is the rarest and least,
That patient and somewhat conservative beast,
Retiring and homely and stubborn and slow.
Unused to being petted, bored stiff at a show;
No rapturous punters his praises to sing,
No bookies to bellow his name from the ring.
He vastly prefers that you leave him in peace
While your grfcss he converts into mutton and fleece.
But when records go crack, upon market or track,
Say, which is it carries the land on his back?
Whose feats are the fitter to warrant a beano?
“Four bob and three ha'pence for greasy merino” !

A car for every
purse and
purpose
y & i^ry
R
IN the automobile industry there have
been developed several distinct price
classes in accordance with which most auto-
mobiles are built and sold.
General Motors, as the world’s largest
builder of motor vehicles, makes a motor
car for each price class.
Its price line ranges from Cadillac, “Stand-
ard of the World,” to Chevrolet, the lowest
priced quality car. In the price classifica-
tions between are Buick, with its world-
wide good name; Oakland, the first “light
six” motor car; and Oldsmobile, the first
motor car to be produced in quantity.
General Motors also builds a car for every
purpose. There are not only passenger cars
for every need, but cars for business service
too, ranging from the Chevrolet commercial
cars to GMC Trucks, which everywhere are
displacing antiquated means of carrying
goods.
Today the cars and trucks made by Gen-
eral Motors are used in 236 different kinds
of business —virtually every form of human
enterprise.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Thus General Motors builds a car for every
purse and purpose. But its service does not
end there. General Motors aims to give
the utmost value in each price class.
By coordinating the purchasing power of
its divisions, General Motors effects large
economies in the building of each car; and
the total volume of sales is so large that the
margin of profit on each car is relatively
low. Both factors result in a material saving
to the buyer of any General Motors car or
truck.
In addition, General Motors insures that
the engineering of each car is of the best by
providing its divisions with the largest engi-
neering and research facilities in the world.
Further information regarding General Motors may be had by writing to General Motors
Export Company, Manchester Unity Building, 160 Castlereagh St., Sydney; or General
Motors Export Company, Bourke House, Bourke & Russell Sts., Melbourne.

W. H. Turner, who died at Warwick (Q.)
lately, was one of the pioneer farmers of the
Toint Macleay (S.A.) district in the early
’sixties. Turner’s chief recreation was paint-
ing. Many S. Australians have examples of
his 'work, and he exhibited with success in
the eastern States.
John Cock, who passed out recently, was
one of Victoria’s best-known older mining-
men. He came to Melbourne in the mid-
’eighties, and settled down to the gold-seeking
business at once. One of the mines he man-
aged—the Chiltern Valley—paid a quarter of
a million in dividends. His last job was as
superintendent of the Wallace group of
mines, most of which were money-spinners.
Little Billie Slowgrove, who died at
Waterloo, Sydney, the other day, was, at
something under 7st., perhaps the smallest
bricklayer in the trade. He had been on
the Eight-hour Committee since its first
year, which should constitute another record.
Ilis claim to be a bricklayer might be dis-
puted, however, as 20 years ago a bursting
gun blew off his left hand, and he had not
set a brick since.
John Thomas Hunt, the six-feet-odd of
splendid physique who died recently at Mt.
Gambier (S.A.), was a one-time international
footballer, and played for England against
Wales, Scotland and Ireland. He also repre-
sented liis county at cricket, and was a win-
ner of many amateur boxing championships.
Coming to Australia as a young man, he
settled in Western Victoria, and managed
various station properties,
“Harold Hardupp”: Professional pride is
not restricted to the more distinguished of
occupations. A sliivoo of the Melbourne
Newsboys’ Society, which has been made a
very lively organisation by the enthusiastic
secretary, Miss Onions, brought together, be-
sides the juveniles, some of the organisation’s
“old boys” and their relatives, including the
grandfather of a newsboy who is carrying on
a four-generation tradition in street paper-
selling. The oldster reckoned that his own
father, now dead, had been one of the first
newsboys in the southern capital.
Recently the students of the Melbourne
Working Men’s College met to make a presen-
tation to the College’s most ancient mentor,
Thomas Alexander Sisley, who, at 78, was
intending retirement. For 31 years he lias
had charge of the elocution classes at the
very useful Melbourne institution, and he has
also helped students in English and commer-
cial correspondence. Death, however, struck
before the date of retirement arrived; and
last week a full muster of College students
walked behind the hearse which took the
precise but likeable old gentleman to the
place of his long sleep.
A good citizen was born 78 years ago when
Thomas Bourke arrived in Launceston
(Tas.). He did more than most to shove his
native place along—helped to found the Tas.
Produce and Cool Storage Co-op. Co., and
was a director till his death; for yeai-s was
a director of the Building Society; exerted a
quiet influence in getting trams and the
woollen mills established, and was the origi-
nator of many of the features which make
the Launceston Show the premier exhibition
in the Speck. He was liberal with money,
too —he gave the main entrance gates to
Royal Park, and a rock garden which has
made Hillside-crescent one of the pleasantest
parts of Launceston; and the improvement
of the Cataract Gorge was largely financed
from his pocket.
Though never shipwrecked during his 55
years at sea, Captain Frederick Sheriff, re<-
cently deceased commodore of the Huddart-
Parker fleet, served on four vessels which
were lost shortly after he left them. The
barque Isabella, on which he completed his
apprenticeship, met her fate on the coast
of New Guinea, several of her Chinese crew
being devoured by cannibals. The barque
Solent, from which Sheriff later received his
discharge, foundered on her next voyage. On
the A.S.N. Co.’s Lyeemoon he was second
mate, but transferred to another steamer
a few months before she was wrecked with
great loss of life off Green Cape. In 1885
the lucky mariner, when chief officer of the
Cahois, was ashore on his honeymoon when
news of the loss of that ship reached him.
“Leamington”: It is improbable that
Repat.’s round-up of soldiers’ widows who
have been drawing pensions (B. 13/11/'24)
disclosed all the methods of evading the
regulations. There are several cases in my
own knowledge where the marriage-tie has
been done without lest the pension should be
forfeited. I know one soldier’s widow who
lias lived with her present mate almost since
her husband embarked, so they have had the
poor beggar’s allotment thrown in with his
pension. What is more, she was conceded
preference to an appointment as charwoman
in a Government department on account of
her war-widowhood. When there are thou-
sands of genuine cases of want, consequent
on the death or disablement of a bread-
winner, Repat. ought to look a little more
closely for deceptions and impostures. Doubt-
less the women are generally less to blame
than the blighters who cling to them, bludging
on the dead, as it were. It is significant that
among such of these as I have met I have
yet to sight a brass badge.
“Cartot”: “J.E.” says that, “according to
belief,” the real Black Death appeared only
once in history (B. 13,/11/’24). Actually
the name has been applied to several sudden
and devastating pestilences. The first ap-
peared just after the start of the Christian
era, and swept up and down the Mediter-
ranean littoral. England had its best-known
Black Death in the fifteenth century ; but the
plague which swept filth-ridden London
over two centuries later was also referred to
as the Black Death by many writers of the
period, including Daniel Defoe. And the
pneumonic plague of our own time has been
in some respects the most dreadful of all.
The Mediterranean Black Death may have
been typhus and it may have been cholera.
The first of the two English epidemics was
most likely typhus; from what we know of
the symptoms, the pi’obability is that the
second was bubonic. Had it not been for
the progress which medicine has made, it is
likely that the epidemic of 1918-19, which
was at first called “Spanish influenza,”
would have easily eclipsed every preceding
pestilence; it might well have exterminated
half the human race before running its
course. History may yet refer to it as the
Black Death.

HIS is the problem, in the habit-forming years, to awaken Interest , whether in music or the othet
desirable graces that make for well-bred manhood and charming femininity. In interest lies apprecia-
tion. In appreciation reside the germs of ripening acquaintance. From continual contact comes the
familiarity which enables man or woman to wear such graces as an accustomed garment.
And above all other things, must music be a close companion. Its pleasures and comforts, its powers
to sooth hurts of soul and mind ; its cheerfulness and uplift are more readily understood and used,
as knowledge of it expands in scope and increases in character.
The New Beale Player-Piano provides this opportunity
for expansion. It is a complete, interpretative instru-
ment that will enable you to guide, with positive
surety, the faltering steps of your children’s early
musical adventurings.
With it you will journey forth with them into a won-
derful land of romance. With them you will sweep
the skies in Wagner’s "Ride of the Valkyries With
them you will buffet the wind and rain and sleet in
Weber’s "Storm” You will guide them in the wisdom
of your own knowledge of what is best; you will play
with an artistry that will teach respect for the posses-
sion of adequate technique. Later, actual use of the
player, by themselves, may be encouraged as a spur
to analyse rhythm and phrasing, long before their
manual dexterity is sufficiently developed.
This is the way in which the New Beale Player is being
used by many other parents who value music as a
distinctly home influence. It is the one instrument
which provides a perfect piano for manual use, with
controls that make artistic interpretation, not merely
possible, but almost instinctive. It is the New Beale of
which Mr. Oscar Asche wrote, saying; "It is impossible
to express in mere words my appreciation of your instru-
ment” Its endorsement is unanimous amongst many
eminent musicians, both as an instrument with high
interpretative ability and concert qualities.
The encasements of the New Beale are genuine cabi-
net woods, double hand-selected. Rich Italian wal-
nut, low-toned mahogany of correct hue, rosewood of
historic fame, make it a piano to kindle pride of
ownership.
It is easily purchased, being within the reach of even modest incomes. Silent pianos accepted
in partial exchange and liberal terms extended 'where desired. ‘•Printed matter posted free

REXONA! Best for
Summer Skin
Troubles.
In the summer-time we all suffer more or less from some
skin trouble, such as Rashes, Boils, Ulcers, Sores, Stings of Insects,
Pimples, or, perhaps, even Eczema. These skin eruptions are
dangerous if neglected, and might become chronic. You must
give them careful attention. There is no better treatment than
to apply Rexona, the Rapid Healer. This is an antiseptic
Ointment, containing just the right cooling, soothing and healing
properties that are needed to rid your skin of all impurities.
Rexona soothes pain, builds new tissues, and renews and heals
the skin. The triangular pot of Rexona, with its healing, soft
green Ointment, should be kept handy on the dressing-table, so
that every member of the family can have access to its wonderful
healing powers.

Portobello.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TIHE road to Portobello
Was paved with Spanish gold,
That road to Portobello
The Rovers took of old,
With powder in the locker
And round-shot in the hold.
So hey for Portobello,
Away for Portobello,
My sullen lads and bold!
Oh. I have spent my money
In gay Port-Royal town,
A-drinking and carousing
With ladies Hack and brown.
So hey for Portobello,
Away for Portobello,
Before the moon goes down!
The treasure of their southern coasts,
The treasure of Castile,
Must fall unto our fearless hands
Though fenced with walls of steel;
For we have lost our plunder
With wantons white and brown,
Who rob the sea-borne robbers
In bold Port-Royal town.
Up, lads, the morn is breaking!
Up. lads, the tide is making!
Come, loose your canvas free!
We'll out along the Main again
To rob and ravish Spain again,
Across the Indian Sea!
For pearls of Porto Rico,
For ingots of Peru,
For ouzas of Cordova,
Who would not dare and do?
Ave. you and I, my bullies,
Who sulk in rags to-day,
Anon may strut and ruffle
The streets in silk array.
Our armorers have labored
Like devils in the shades
To weld and temper sweetly
Our short and heavy blades;
Though flint and pan may fail us,
The cutlass, to and fro.
Still seeks a door to open
The loot of Mexico.
For us the gentle Incas
Have labored in the mine;
For us have sails of treasure
Crept slowly o’er the brine;
For us, who now assemble,
With greedy, grim intent,
The Dons unwitting gathered
The gems of Orient.
A merry thought, my bullies—
Come fill your cans again !
Drink health to Harry Morgan.
And Death and Hell to Snain!
Then rouse ye up. my rascals,
From tavern and from stew;
The loot of all the Indies
Is calling unto you !
Port-Royal rum is heady;
We stagger as we thud
A-cursing up the gangway
To sign the Bond of Blood;
Bat, full of lust and courage,
Let Fate fall as it may,
We’re all for P'ortobello
Before the break of day.
Though Cod’s red anger smite us
With lightning, storm and wrack;
Though Death, or worse, await us,
They will not turn us back.
Shall festered wounds deter them,
Or hunger, thirst or pain.
Whose fevered dreams are glamored
By gleam and glint of Gain?
So hey for Portobello!
Away for Portobello,
My swarthy lads and bold,
With powder in your lockers
And round-shot in the hold!
The road to Portobello
Is paved with Spanish gold.

Ponsonbey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT some period of their career—-it is
/-% usually when they are broke —writers
go through the gates of Romance into
the Sydney Domain in search of true-to-life
stories from some “dosser” on a seat. Once
upon a time I set out on such a quest, and
found Ponsonbey.
Ponsonbey (spelt with an e) fulfilled
traditional requirements. He was hunched
up dejectedly on a seat, weather-beaten and
ragged. I knew by the cut of his clothes
that he had seen better days.
He did not alter his position as I sat
down beside him. I coughed, and said in
the approved manner: “You seem in trouble.
Perhaps I can help you !” He looked up,
and I could see by the emotion in his eyes
that my interest had touched him. His face
was long and angular. His pale eyes seemed
to take the expression of a child's, and
his lips trembled.
“I am indeed in deep trouble,” he said
sadly. “But I am too proud to accept help
from a stranger. I have never claimed to
be a religious man, sir, but all my life—
tragic as it has been—l have trusted in
Bod; and God, I believe, will listen to my
Prayers and lighten my present afflictions.
Perhaps you would care to hear my story,
sir?”
“If it would ease your trouble to make
me your confidant,” I murmured.
“Mjf name is Ponsonbey—spelt with an
e,” he began. “It is not easy for me to men-
tion, under these sad circumstances, the
name of a family respected throughout Aus-
tralia. But I am a Ponsonbey, sir, and
even though forced to make the Domain my
temporary home, am justly proud of my
lineage. I have never been in such sad
straits before. This suit, you will observe
—admirably cut —was made by his Excel-
lency’s tailor. This collar and tie —alas!
now almost shabby—l purchased at his Ex-
cellency’s mercer’s. On my unpolished shoes,
too, you will note the name of his Excel-
lency.’s bootmaker. The Almighty, I am con-
vinced, _ intended me to become a brilliant
figure in the legal world. I was a born
pleader. At college I took a prominent part
in the debates. I am not guilty of s
flattery when I mention that ray acting w
the Dramatic Society was brilliant. Y\ he
I left college I nourished ambitions for my-
self as a barrister. I saw the
headings after a famous trial: IONbUJV
BEY, K.C., WINS AGAIN.’ Ah, sir, did
you ever have your youthful ambitions shat-
tered in the bud by a ruthless and misunder-
standing family? My father old Sir
Richard Ponsonbey, y’know—quenched my
ardor, and apprenticed me to ail ironmonger
—a bitter ignominy! The whole course or
my life was altered, and I grew to manhood
oppressed by humiliating association with
cheap pots and pans! But I accepted my
fate resignedly, and eventually bought a
small ironmongery business for myself.
"I married : then my real troubles began.
God knows I am a peaceful and gentle-
natured man, but Maria made life a hell.
She was the possessor of A vicious temper,
and was always dissatisfied with her lot. I,
with my lost dreams, faced the world
bravely; but Maria was not made of such
stern stuff. She nagged and nagged, and
made my life miserable. When the kiddies
came—dear little children whom I loved
it grew worse. She neglected them shame-
fully, then reproached me for not earning
enough money to send them to a private
school. I who had given her and her child-
ren the precious name of Ponsonbey!
Matters became worse between us, and I
was in despair. Deep in my heart I loved
my wife fondly, but nothing I did seemed
to please her. Then one day a very dear
friend of mine—he is a prominent figure on
the Stock Exchange—suggested a remedy
which, unfortunately, I tried. He told me
to visit an imaginary physician, then return
to Maria and tell her that I had only six
months to live. She would be so affected,
my friend said, that she would do her utmost
to make my last days on earth happy. The
idea seemed feasible, and I followed liis
advice. My dramatic abilities stood me in
good stead. I put a haunted, tragic expres-
sion in my eyes, and entered my home with
dragging, leaden feet. I told Maria what the
physician had said. I had been overworked,
I explained, a slave to other people’s happi-
ness, and my reward was death. I would
die within six months. There was no escape.
I was doomed. Could you have seen, sir, the
expression of wretchedness I put into my
naturally vivacious eyes, you would have
realised what a genius the dramatic stage
had been robbed of. Useless, bitter regrets,
however.”
Ponsonbey sighed, leaning forward on the
seat and gazing across through the trees to
the Art Gallery.
“Events shaped,” he proceeded, “as my
friend had predicted. At first Maria was
prostrated with grief and remorse. She
freely admitted that she had treated me
badly, and begged my forgiveness. ‘My
darling wife,’ I said magnanimously, ‘I for-
give you gladly. I am a Ponsonbey and I
have endeavored, in my small way, to make
you a good husband. My heart is desolate
if I have failed.’ I kissed her tenderly. I
go to my death willingly,’ I added, ‘my eyes
bright with the realisation of your love.’
She broke down, and swore never, never to
be inconsiderate to me again.
“We entered upon a period of unalloyed
happiness. Maria, despite my earnest protest-
ations, insisted on drawing considerably from
my banking account. My last days, she in-
sisted, must be filled with every pleasure that
love could give, or money buy. We bought
the children new clothes, and allowed them
to see the motion pictures as often as they
desired. They had a splendid time. But I
refused to give up my ironmongery business.
Maria was goodness itself. Each night we
were at home she would draw the most com-
fortable armchair in the house to the fire,
and settle me in it. She would read to me
my favorite dramatic works, and listen with
unconcealed admiration to my imaginary
pleadings on behalf of an accused criminal.
We went to the theatres regularly—in the
stalls. We heard every performance of the
grand-opera season. Life was made beautiful
for me, and the months passed swiftly.”
Ponsonbey paused and I saw a look of
suffering cross his face.
“Yes?” I encouraged him.
“I had started an immense force in motion,"
he said hoarsely, “and the dread realisation
came that I was powerless to stem its awful
onrush. I had put too much faith in a
woman’s nature. The six months came to
an end. Our money also! That is, except
the £3O Maria had insisted on reserving for
my funeral expenses. I did not die. 1
looked, if anything, to be enjoying better
health than ever. I could not die. Maria
was puzzled, and, I fancy, a little disap-
pointed. I spent a miserable week endea-
voring to look as if my gallant spirit was
passing away. I did not want to die. But
at last, as I observed my wife’s compassion-
ate nature slowly turning into bitterness,
I came to a heart-breaking resolution. Soon
there would be no money in the house, save
for my funeral expenses. Soon, I told my-
self, Maria would become her old self again
—nagging, unreasonable. I must die. I must
disappear from the ken of my dear family
before the crash came.
“One night, while my dear curly-headed
children lay sleeping peacefully in their little
cots, I stole up the stairs and kissed them
tenderly. Poor little innocent tots ! I was
leaving them without a father. But what
could I do? I moved into my wife’s room
and kissed her also. Then I slipped out of
my home for ever.
“That happened a short month ago. I
sold all my clothes except the suit I stood
up in, and sent the money anonymously to
Maria. I was a Ponsonbey, and I was deter-
mined, sir, to play the game to the end.
Since then I have never been vouchsafed a
glimpse of my darling children or my wife.
I roam the streets by day. searching in vain
for a billet, however menial. But my dra-
matic gifts are not appreciated. I am an
outcast. At night I sleep here on this seat,
hungry and cold, and turning bitter against
my more fortunate fellow-creatures. Ah, sir,
would that I had been offered the happy
release of death a month ago!”
Ponsonbey’s voice trailed away, and he
sighed. His tale had moved me, and I patted
his thin shoulders awkwardly.
“Ah, sir,” he said, “if only you knew how
deeply I appreciate your kindness in stoop-

Every-day Accidents.
Treat them all with ZAM-BUK.
In the home, the workshop and the playground the
value of Zam-Buk as a thoroughly reliable first-aid is
being proved daily. Whether it be a cut, bruise, burn,
scald or sprain, Zam-Buk provides the handiest, surest
means to quick, clean healing.
When Zam-Buk is applied to a wound or sore, pain is
soothed and inflammation subdued. In a perfectly natural
way Zam-Buk stops the growth and spread of dangerous
microbes and insures against all danger of an injury or
sore “going the wrong way.” In addition to special
emollient qualities, Zam-Buk also has very powerful but
highly-refined antiseptic and germicidal properties, and
grows healthy new skin.
Zam-Buk owes its unquestionable supremacy over
mere ointments to its unique composition and. its entire freedom from animal
fats and risky minerals.
Moreover, a box of Zam-Buk retains its wholesomeness for an indefinite
time, and does not turn rancid as do cheap ointments. Nothing can possibly
equal Zam-Buk as a thoroughly safe, reliable and economical healer.

TERRIBLE WOUND ON LEG HEALED.
“I had a terrible wound in my left ankle,'’ writes Mr.
William Wallace, Plymyard, Gray Road, West End, Bris-
bane. “This disabling injury defied all manner of treatment,
ordinary ointments and salves being quite powerless to heal the
sore. One day, after reading of the marvellous curative power
of Zam-Buk, I decided to give it a trial. Even the contents of
the sample box which I applied were sufficient to prove its
exceptional healing properties. I then purchased a larger size,
and the healing results exceeded all expectations. The obstinate
wound simply couldn’t resist Zam-Buk. It induced perfect
healing in remarkably short time.
SCALD ON FOOT TURNS TO BLOOD-POISON.
Mr. Guthrie F. Long, Viola. Roseberry Road, Guildford,
N.S.W., writes: —“I had the misfortune to upset half a gallon
of boiling water, severely scalding my right foot. In addition
to the terrible pain caused by - the scald, dirt got into the
exposed flesh, setting up a dreadful state of festering and inflam-
mation. The limb was in such a state that for weeks it was
impossible for me to .follow work.
“It was not until I began to treat the limb with Zam-Buk
that it gave real signs of healing. From the first this grand
herbal balm was wonderfully soothing, and its persistent use
reduced swelling, expelled all poisonous matter from the wound
and healed perfectly with fine new skin. I am glad to say my
foot is now as sound as before.”
A REAL ANTISEPTIC HEALER
ing to comfort a waif of the world like me!
I am a Ponsonbey, sir, and cannot accept
help from a stranger; but if only I had a
five-pound note in my pocket to help me face
the cruel dawn to-morrow! To the world’s
knowledge 1 am dead, but faintly my heart
beats beneath this shabby coat. A five-pound
note would fill my wasted body with re-
newed courage to fight my uneven battle
with Fate. Perhaps I could sit here and
dream of my dear children in their tiny
cots. I could see Maria bending over them
and holding them to her breast. Poor little
mites! No father to support them—only a
memory which they will forget as the years
roll by. But I am proud—ah, too proud!”
What could I do? With a bursting heart
I forced it upon him. He hesitated, remem-
bering he was a P’onsonbey; then, with a
sigh, lie accepted it. His tale had cost me
two shillings. Yet I comfort myself with
the knowledge that I had met one who might
indeed have been a brilliant ornament of the
theatrical profession.
GILBERT MANT.
The White Man’s Legacy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
80UEA was old; very old. His wrinkled
skin hung about his shrunken body
like an ill-fitting garment, and his
limbs were thin and grotesquely twisted. He
was quite naked, and was roughly smeared
all over with clay, dead white clay, through
which the totem mark of his tribe showed
indistinctly on fcis shoulders.
I came across him late one afternoon as
he was squatting before a small fire, ’ near
the bank of the little Gatubama River, over
in New Guinea. All around us the trees
were faintly stirring to the soft evening
breeze, as the sun, Low in the west, sent
long shafts of golden light searching the
gloomy depths of the forest, gilding the
under side of the palm-le»aves and mottling
the tree-trunks with wavering splashes of
light and shade.
The old savage made a strange picture,
squatting there alone in the heart of the
dense and sweating forest. From the fire a
thin trail of blue-grey smoke spiralled verti-
cally upwards, until caught in an eddy of
the breeze, while all around, from the fast
deepening shadows, caniic soft, mysterious
rustlings, as little wandering puffs of wind
brushed the leaves aside. He made no sign
of having seen me as I approached him from
the river bank, and it urns not until I was
actually facing him, acrjoss the fire, that he
raised his head for a monnent and glanced up
at me.
His behavior showed neither respect, curi-
osity nor fear; and he gave me no greeting
whatever. It was not tiintil he was satisfied
that I was neither a Government official nor
a missionary that he did more than answer
in monosyllables. A gift of two sticks of
trade tobacco, however, went some way to-
wards getting us on more friendly terms;
though my explanation that I was tnere
searching for orchids made him again sus-
picious. Finally he accepted that, too, though
showing plainly he considered me childish, or
mad.
He was engaged in cooking his evening meal,
a snake, which he had wound round and round a
short length of green cane, and was toasting
over the glowing wood embers. I filled my
pipe and stood watching him for some min-
utes ; but he was too intent on the coming
repast to take further notice of me just then.
At last I squatted down to get a firestick
for my pipe, and, as I bent forward, his eyes
met mine for an instant. They were extra-
ordinary eyes. Stone-grey, with neither
whites nor pupils. Blind eyes that saw,
and that held something in them that made
me wonder. Our eyes held for a moment
only, and then his lashless lids fluttered, down
in a way that made me think of a monkey.
Finally he seemed satisfied with the con-
dition of the toasted snake, and the meal
began. Taking the cane in both hands he
sucked the meat off the bones, carefully spit-
ting the latter into the heart of the fire. In
this I recognised the native belief that an
enemy could kill him by bewitching fragments
of food that had been partly eaten and left.
Native villages would become untenable in a
short time but for this belief.
The meal finished, the old man wiped his
mouth with his palms, and his palms against
his thighs. He was evidently feeling better,
and was soon talking freely. I questioned
him about his people, and his being there
all alone. It was then, from the lips of this
old cannibal, one-time famous warrior and
head-hunter, I heard the tale of the White
Man’s legacy as we squatted on opposite
sides of the little fire that slowly died out
during the telling.
“It was when I was head of my tribe;
when my word meant life or death, and
when my wives were many, and bore me men-
children to follow in my steps. It was when
I was true head of my people, before all
things were changed and we were killed by
the magic of the white men while we feasted
and danced or slept. It was before men of
your tribe and color came, men whose skin
was like your skin—white, but all covered
with devil-tliings to hide it.
“Then my village was by the sea, and the
beach was black with my war-canoes. My
warriors shamed the thunder by the power of
their war-songs; made the lightning pale by
the flame of their fires. My house was then
as high - as the highest palm-tree. My
strength was the strength of many men. That
was before the coming of the white men;
before I became a man without a tribe.”
lie peered at me venomously from under
his hairless eyelids, his eyes reminding me
of some great snake. For several minutes he
remained silent, while the greying embers of
the fire settled softly down, and the last of
the daylight merged into the blur of night.
“Then came those first white men,” he
slowly resumed. “They came riding, high
out of the water, in a great devil-canoe that
barked at us as we paddled our canoes to-
wards it; barked like some thunder-devil,
with flames and smoke coming from its many
mouths. One of my canoes was broken by
their magic, and some of my warriors were
killed. Those thrown into the water were
angry because others laughed at them, and
they swam fast towards the white man’s
devil-canoe which was trying to get away,
but which, being big under water, stumbled
against a sandbank it could not see. Then
my warriors overtook it. They climbed up
its sides, many being killed by the barking of
the devils and the magic of those white men.
Then those in the canoes smelt the blood of
the’killed, and with a great shout they went
into the devil-canoe together; they swarmed
over it like ants over a wounded snake.
"Those white men fought well; fought with
much noise and fire and magic; but my
warriors killed and killed, taking many heads.
Some they took alive to keep for the ovens.
“There was big eating and dancing after
that fight, and the palms were lit up for
many nights by the leaping flames of the
fires, while the beating of the great wooden
drums was like the roaring of the sea when
it is angry—like the voice of the storm-devil
when he tears up the trees. Ten and ten
and ten heads did the old men prepare for the
decoration of the daritno, the men’s house,
where they should hang from thg roof, in
the smoke, for the pride of me’ and my
warriors. There was great feasting through-
out all the village, for they had brought in
all those who were killed in the fight also.”
He opened and closed his hands to count
the tens, until the total was forty, and then
held up three fingers of his left hand only.
“So many there were brought ashore of
those white men, living and dead, for the
feast. They were lying on the beach like
turtle, on their backs, while the stones were
being heated for the roasting.”
Souea lapsed into silence, nodding slowly
as he stared into the greying ashes of the
fire, recalling the joyous horrors of that far-
off day.
“The feasting and dancing lasted many
days,” he continued after I had watched
him in silence for some minutes, “and then
my people slept, because there was no more
white men for them to kill and eat. We
were tired of so much kaikai and dancing.
The fires were untended, and died out; the
great flat stones of the ovens cooled; the
drums became silent; my warriors and women
slept. I, too, slept, having eaten well at the
feasting and grown weary of watching my
warriors and women dance before the fires
for many nights.”
Once more the old man became silent, his
head sunk forward as he stared with unseeing
eyes into the dead fire, while I visioned the
ghastly scene he had described, in which an
entire ship’s company had been trapped and
butchered, roasted and eaten, by this man
and his savage tribe.
“That was before the great trouble came to
my people,” he resumed slowly, peering up at
me again in the dim light. “That was before
the magic of those white men killed my war-
riors and my women and my children, until
there were none left by the sea. All were
dead, save only me and one old wife and one
son. We fled deep into the forest, where
the trees are big and where the daylight
comes only through the leaves like sunlight
through deep water. We fled from the spirits
of those white men we had killed, for they
were too strong. They had quickly destroyed
my people. They killed them in the night and
in the day, and they died not knowing those
that killed them.
“It was then, as I fled away from this evil,
that the men from the mountains came down
to fight us. They had spied on us from afar,
and knew of the long knives and ropes and
the pots of yellow and wfliite metal we had
taken from the white man’s devil-canoe; and
the coverings for the body—only they were
not such as you have,” he added, looking me
over with cold snake-like eyes.
“They came early in the night, those fight-
ing-men from the mountains, and I fled
deeper into the trees, leaving all, for I had
none left to fight for me —all were dead—
killed by the magic and the spirits of those
white men. Prom afar I heard the yells and
shrieks of our enemies as they discovered
the village filled only with dead. They
feasted and danced and sang; and the light
of the fires turned the sky into blood above
them.”
What, I wondered, had been the cause of
the tribe dying in the manner described by
the old man. Could it have been ?
“Two days and two nights were those fight-
ing-men in my village,” Souea’s voice broke
in on my speculations, “and then they burnt
my war-canoes and all the houses of my
people.”
He paused again, passing trembling hands
over his face, while he rocked his body
slowly from side to side, swaying from the
hips. As I waited the heavy silence was
broken by a tree-frog close at hand. The
short “whoof” of some prowling alligator
came from the direction of the river. Then
the old man spoke again.
“The magic of those white men was strong.
Even as I fled and hid it overtook me. I
became, weak and could no longer stand.
Also, all light went out, and I could no more
see. My old wife and son tended me there
under the big trees, digging holes in which
they put me when the spirits fought me.
See! Even now, when lam an old, old man
—how old none can tell —I still carry the
scars of my fight with the spirits, of those
wfliite men. See!”
I looked closely into his face, as he
pointed at it with a hand like a withered
bird’s foot. The entire surface was covered
with countless tiny wrinkles, and was lined
and scored deeply in every direction. I
looked still closer. Yes, there could be no
doubt about it. In spite of the wrinkles,
scars of wounds, and the dirt, there were the
unmistakable pits of small-pox. My eyes
travelled down over his clay-smeared and
filthy body, and, sure enough, wherever the
skin showed through the clay, there were the
fatal marks.
So that was the “white man’s magic,” the
work of the “devil-spirits” that had w'iped
out old Souea’s cannibal tribe.
* # * *
I rose to my feet, and, tossing a couple of
extra sticks of tobacco to the old man, left
him there, alone with his memories, before
the dead fire.
“Small-pox!” I said to myself, as the
launch sped down stream towards my camp.
The dread disease must have been on board
that old ship, and swiftly avenged the
murder of those who had been on board her.
