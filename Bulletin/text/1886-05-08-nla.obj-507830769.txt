SATURDAY, MAY 8, 1886.
Some weeks ago, Mr. Thomas Michael
Slattery, M.P., stated his intention of re-
tiring from public life in New South Wales.
Now, however, it seems that he has unwisely
repented, and proposes to brand himself as
a political clown instead. This may or may
not have been his direct intention, but the
motion in his name for the Bth June will un-
doubtedly have that effect. Its terms are as
follows
“ That, in the opinion of this House, this colony,
as well as all British dependencies enjoying re-
sponsible Government, should each contribute an
equitable sum annually towards the expenses of
the army and navy of Great Britain and Ireland,
in order, not only to relieve the tax-payers of the
mother country from further payments by them
for and on account of the Inestimable services
rendered by the army and navy in the protection
of the lives and properties of Her Majesty’s sub-
jects In this and the said dependencies, but as a
just contribution towards such expenditure from
a loyal people.”
It is difficult to discover the motive power-
ful enough to induce Mr. Slattery to table
such a resolution as this. It may possibly
be that he, a son of the Roman Catholic
Church—which has ever held the Queen to
be second to the Pope, and which declares
the Law subject to prelatical interpretations
of the Gospel—feared that his loyalty to the
Crown might be suspected, so brought this
proposal forward as evidence to the con-
trary. He doubtless knows that the Abi-
gails of the House have remembered his too
generous utterances when, as a Minister of
the Crown, he promised very large assist-
ance in an undefined manner to the Jesuits,
and is aware that those indiscreet promises
are retained for use against him. But even
so, it would have been far better for him to
have borne the stigma of a too devoted
loyalty t© his church, than to invite ridicule
by posing, in the way he has done, as an
hysterical patriot*-to the empire. If his
motion bo rejected with the contempt it
merits, he and those who vote with him
will be the objects of thinly-disguised de-
rision; if on the contrary any marvellous
combination of circumstances should give
him a majority, the Assembly of New South
Wales will be the subject of ridicule to the
whole English-speaking world. For a com-
munity to offer to pay away a portion of its
revenues before any request to that effect is
made, for a benefit that is chiefly imaginary
is foolish in the extreme; but to lecture
“ all British dependencies enjoying respon-
sible Government ” upon the necessity of
their doing likewise, is the height of im-
pertinence, and the apex of absurdity.
m » •
Farcical as the resolution is, there are
many politicians and newspapers bound to
support it, or else be self-oonvioted of the
grossest inconsistency. Upon all who advo-
cate Imperial Federation this motion has a
special claim, as it prepares the way for that
closer union of the mother country and her
colonies, which has already been the theme
of many high-flown but lamentably indefi-
nite leading articles, and of much fervid
post-prandial blather. These panegyrists of
Imperial Federation have touched, only
upon the sentimental side of their subject;
they have dilated upon the glories to be
achieved by a United Empire, but have not
indicated at what cost this Union is to be
consummated, nor what privileges the
colonies must renounce in order to be
sharers in the vaguely-prophesied triumphs.
77 r * Slattery’s motion directs attention to
he otherj side of the question, calls upon
Australians to contribute to the cost of
governing Great Britain, and plainly points
to a renunciation of our privilege of self-
defence. His is the practical view: that
adopted by the Dallbys of the community
the unreal and the romantic. The proposed
system may have been a potent delusion,
when only vague generalities were discussed
in heroic terms, but when direct payments
are involved we are convinced that Imperial
Federation will lose many of its most en-
thusiastic and least thoughtful—the terms
are in this case synonymous—advocates both
in the editor’s room and the banquet-hall.
When, further, the proposal to vote a subsidy
is regarded as a payment to England to induce
her to continue the guardianship of our
shores, the proposal will be spurned by all
who value the measure of independence
MR. E. H. HARGRAVES,
The Original Discoverer of Gold in Australia.
which the colonies have already won. Yet
the successive steps towards Imperial Fede-
ration would involve levies and sacrifices of
which those contemplated by this present
motion afford but an insignificant example.
Let it be supposed that Mr. Slattery’s mo-
tion is carried, and that a sum of money be
sent to England to reimburse her for de-
fending our ports. Then it will be only
just that the colonists should have a voice in
the disposal of monies to which the com-
munity is a contributor, and so a paltry
coterie of New South Wales representatives,
selected from the privileged classes, would
be sent to the Commons. Consequent upon
this representation the degradation of the
local Assembly would ensue. With ac-
credited Australians in the Commons all
matters which concern the dependencies as
separate communities in relation to other
States or nations would rightly be dealt
with by the Central Parliament. This
would leave nothing but matters of a
strictly municipal character to the local
Legislatures, and the Legislative Coun-
cillors, as well as the Slattbrys and
Abigails of the Assembly, would find in
road and bridge discussions full scope for
all the intellect and Statecraft with which a
beneficent Creator has endowed them.
* * *
Such a picture of the consummation of
the Federation which our local Imperialists
profess anxiety to achieve is not pleasant to
contemplate, yet it is a correct forecast of
what must necessarily be the course of
events if the system is ever to be inaugur-
ated. Its worst feature would be the ex-
tinction of our national aspirations. We
should then be not Australians, but English-
men living in Australia. And loyalty is
largely discounted by distance. Men can-
not be patriots to a mere abstract idea. Every
worthy Australian could be devotedly loyal
to an Australian Federation, for he would
be as a unit cohering to millions of others
akin to him in the broad circumstances of
national life, and fellow sharer with him in
national dangers. But it would be otherwise
if he were a citizen of an enormous federated
empire of which the constituent portions
were distributed over the face of the globe.
He would then be asked to claim national
kinship with men of whom he had heard
but the vaguest reports, and with others of
whose dangers and aspirations he knew no-
thing ; he would have to contribute to wars
of whose justice or necessity he could not
judge, and to join in quarrels which his
fellow-countrymen had no share in making,,
and his patriotism and loyalty would need
to centre upon a mere abstraction—
a shadowy and fanciful creation which
the mind is unable to invest with
reality. Australians could fight for Aus-
tralia, but that they should suffer for the
sake of the integrity of a heterogenous
empire, ruled over by an elderly lady for
whom the discriminating people of England
itself do not evince a very large amount of
respect or admiration, is neither reasonable
nor just.
* * *
As anticipatory of the tendency of Mr.
Slattery’s resolution, ,it Is worth while to
consider the effect of representation in the
Commons. This latter body would then be
charged, as we have shown, with all colonial
legislation affecting the attitude of the
colonies to other dependencies or nations,
and the evident result would be to foist an
Imperial Policy on the various communities
composing the empire. Victoria would then
be asked to give up Protection, New South
Wales to allow an avalanche of Chinese to
pour in upon her territory. And a peerage
for Australia—a species of hereditary
0. M. Q .-ship—would be a necessary reward for
those politicians called or elected to attend
the English Parliament. These are some of
the penalties appurtenant to Imperial
Federation, which, when once realised by
the people of New South Wales, will for
ever remove the craving that any unreflect-
ing colonists may have for that “closer
union with the mother country” upon
which the Sydney dailies delight to ex-
patiate. We have spoken of the Federated
Empire as though it were possible that it
should ever be brought about by the efforts
of “patriots ” of the Slattery order, but the
fear of such a calamity is extremely remote.
If, indeed, Australia should ever become so
bound to England, the bondage would
be but the first step towards abso-
lute freedom. Somewhere on this Con-
tinent there would be another Lexington,
a second Bunker’s Hill, and another
Saratoga. Then the various colonies hav-
ing united in a common cause, would find
it to their own mutual benefit to make that
union permanent. Imperial Federation
would merely hasten the advent of Austra-
lasian Federation with national indepen-
dence.
• • ■
Mischievous as is the tendency of Mr.
Slattery’s motion, its immediate effect
would be equally vicious. Disregarding the
spirit of Jingoistic cant evinced in the words
which invite the Assembly to arise in
judgment against all other British depen-
dencies under responsible Government, we
still object to hand over to England our
duties in the way of self-protection. If a
squadron is necessary to our safety, it must
be procured at our own expense, and be con-
trolled by the New South Wales authorities.
To supplicate or subsidise England to keep
us safe from our enemies, would be to stifle
national aspirations and strangle the spirit
of self-reliance essential to our advance as
a community. The power of self-defence
should be 00-extensive with our opulence:
the greater the temptation which the colony
offers to a rapacious foe, the more complete
should be its means of repelling an attack.
To ask England to take a contract for our
protection would be not less foolish than
cowardly. Two further reasons should dis-
suade colonists from depending upon Eng-
land for protection by sea. The first of
these is that it is possible that England her-
self may be Australia’s first assailant. The
other, that a European war may wipe Eng-
land out of the list of nations. It is not
necessary to dwell upon this latter contin-
gency. When France went to war with


Germany in 1870 it was found that money
which should have gone to equip the army
had been squandered on courtesans. In like
manner a large portion of the English army
vote goes into the pockets of rascally con-
tractors who supply leaden bayonets,
shoddy uniforms, and unserviceable guns
and ammunition; and royal loafers such
as the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Lbinin-
gbn, and the Duke of Edinburgh, clutch
huge salaries for demoralising the forces by
taking, over the heads of good men and true,
positions, the duties of which they are
utterly incompetent to fulfil. England is
not impregnable, and it would be madness
to leave the safety of the colonies dependent
upon her continued prosperity. A “ Battle
of Dorking ” would in such a case mean the
subjugation of Australia.
• •
Should the resolution as quoted in our
opening paragraph ever come to a division
in the House, it will probably be supported
by all who have ever toadied for a knight-
hood, a C.M.Q.-ship, or for permission to re-
tain the title of “Honorable” within the
colony, and by all who intend to sue for these
honours in the future. It will also most
probably be supported by those who wish to
tie the Australian kangaroo to the tail of
the British lion and by all hysterical loyal-
ists Of the DALIiEY-OUm-SLATTERY-OUm-
Abigail order. Still, in spite of such mighty
advocates, there must ee enough members
who are loyal and patriotic to New South
Wales to scornfully reject a motion which
would check the material prosperity of the
colony if adopted, and which would make
our Parliament the laughing stock of half
the known world.
The Proposed Parsonical Land-Grab.
The creeds of well nigh all the bells have been
dinned into people’s ears about this business. Pres-
byterian and Methodistic have been at it loudest,
the souls they had saved were more directly
menaced, you see; the stations they had secured
and hoped to secure were also imperilled; but that
of course was a secondary consideration. The
bells of the creeds might have rung on, however,
they would have had no more effect upon the
New Hebrides and their disposal than the tongues
of the parsons upon the filth and rot of humanity
generally found in grossest forms beneath the
shadows of the churches. But, unluckily, the
bell-ringers found a voice in a politician who, like
Ga wain’s ghost, has become nothing but a voice,
—Sir Henry Parkes. Sir Henry Parkks saw
that there was something wrong in this matter of
New Hebrides; and there would indeed have been
something very wrong if the House had made it his
footstool to power. And with two morning and
two evening papers to clerical control,
or led by ignorant impulse, giving tongue with
zeal, there was a temporary fizzle amongst the
shallower minds of New Sonth Wales.
w * * •
What was it all about ? Ask the S.M. Herald
what It was all about, and the Herald will
answer with either the most audacious mendacity
or contemptible ignorance: “England wants to
sacrifice Australian interests to her temporary
convenience, and our Government is willing and
eager to aid her.” Ask the Telegraph, but you
had better not, lor the Telegraph became angry
in the matter and so incoherent. Ask the mis-
sionaries. As well ask a Jew for leaven in Pass-
over week, or a loan on the chance of a Civil
servant’s rise in any week. It is of no use asking
any of the voices which have been loud in this
matter. It Is better, it is necessary. Indeed, to go to
the facts yourself to gather them into intelligible
form, and read and understand what they really
mean.
• . ■ m
And what are the facts ? Let us put them
plainly. The first fact is that the New
Hebridean people, happened to be doing very
well for themselves, and England and France
chanced to be honest enough to let them
alone. England said to France : “If you
don’t I won’t ” (steal was meant), and France re-
plied, “Amen.” Bo matters jogged along for
some years, notwithstanding the howls of certain
Presbyterian missionaries, who, with the example
of Shirley Baker In Tonga before their eyes )
wanted badly to perform more acts of heroic atlf-
saorifioe, get a few more trading-stations, and
make a few more easy piles.
• * *
About this time thundering along the Pacific
came that pickor-up of all unconsidered trifles—
Bismarck. The big part of New Guinea, New
Britain, New Ireland bore the impress of his foot,
and of his red hand of brutal conquest. He was
moving as resolutely and unscrupulously as his
Vandal ancestors, and France, eager—naturally
eager—to have some sort of standing-ground
against the advancing enemy, put in her plea for
the New Hebrides; said to England in plain terms:
I want to steal the New Hebrides—will you
object ? England then, with a really fine courtesy,
asked the opinion of Australia, and, for the part
of Australia which he chanced to represent, Sir
Patrick JenNings answered—and very well—
” Give them the,Now Hebrides if you can make a
bargain that they send no more convicts to the
Pacific.”
• n m
That was the reply which put all the fat In the
fire, that set all the penny trumpets a squeaking,
that gave Sir Henry Parkes his imaginary ful-
crum, and stirred up pious editors to bring such
railing accusations against France and Frenchmen
as Michael the Archangel, never conceived
against the Devil.
* * *
But the mystery of the matter is that
not one of these pious persons seemed
to have the slightest idea that the flisfc
duty of England was to do right, and that a first
cause of quarrel amongst Great Powers would be
a breach of a specific agreement. Perhaps wo
ought not to have expected them to understand
the second matter. Their peculiar training in the
way of dQuWe-aiuUUsi and fast and loose play
with clear words and evident facta must tend to
twist their moral sense. They cannot see how a
bargain is binding, or understand how, amongst
men of the world and nations in the world, what'
is agreed to be done generally is done. But men
in Parliament ought not to be so befooled, and
they were not. The few men we have in Parlia-
ment, with old Sir John, who, though never a
statesman, was and Is and while he lasts will con-
tinue to be a man, cursing loudest, at their head
kicked the thing out in contempt. And what did
we see then ?
♦ * *
Precisely what a far-seeing man might have ex •
peoted. Pious people who did not scruple to charge
the Republic of France with lying, treachery, and
premeditated theft, turned round in a moment on
the majority of our House of Assembly and charged
them with perjury and corruption. Not in direct
terms, of course. They are not fond of direct
terms. They put it as “voting on this matter not
according to their conviction, but in accordance
with what they conceived to be the exigencies of
the case.” And what more? Nothing more ex-
cept the surprise and disgust of sensible and
well-informed people. Tne Parliamentary minor-
ity had spluttered, they went out. The
Premier sent his straightforward and politic
message home, and so the matter rests. Who
cares whether the Premier is fishing for a
baronetcy, or whether any Lord’s shepherd is
hungering after a fat island or a good trading
camp ?
• • •
If this affair is dealt with by the Liberal party in
England, amongst the first things asked will be
these—What guarantees will you Australians,
preachers or politicians, give for the fair treat-
ment of those niggers? What have you done
with them hitherto ? What are you doing with
them now, eh ? And if there is an Australian
around who has travelled, but not for “the
Lord,” he may answer—We have just murdered
them all in Tasmania; in New South Wales we
have about a thousand left; you may find about
40 camped at Lavender Bay, a mile from Sydney
Post-office—now—rotting out of the world,
poisoned with nicotine, with vile rum, with foul
disease. In Queensland we are shooting and stab-
bing with manly vigour, killing the men, flogging
and outraging the women, stealing the children.
In various islands of the Pacific we have, by our
unscrupulous slave trade, sowed such seeds of
hatred, that the black vendetta will only die out
with the black races: but all the while we
have got the banner of Christ aloft. Oh, honest
man Christusl bon sans calotte Jbsul forgive us
the blasphemy and the brave work we have done
beneath it.
■ ■ ■
The Liberal party, the Democratic party, the
party in England based on righteousness and
broad conceptions and true recognition of human
right, will not listen to our poor, our weak, our
rotten Australian plea for more and more
dominion.
* ♦ *
But, oh, brothers, dearly beloved, let us, like
you, add a little of the wisdom of the serpent to
the harmlessness of the dove. Oh, brave knights,
dreaming of baronetcies, and, good men and true
also (if you will permit us to introduce you to the
peculiar company), would you grasp an oppor-
tunity which may grow out of all this muddle ?
Will you look ahead just a little bit ? You, good,
pious folk, who believe all men are liars, may j ust
take our candle to find the lost ends of your own
theories. You better fellows may follow a more
reasonable supposition. Suppose, now, this bar-
gain, this very good bargain, is brought about, and
that by and bye France, following her own (always
evil) designs or retaliating In time of war, or seek-
ing new changes by new treaties, proposes to begin
again the deportation of her conviois to southern
seas. Think of it! Realise it! Imagine the holy
howl you could raise, the satisfaction with which
you could hiss out the “ I told you so I ” It would
be very very fine, and you could enjoy all your
pious delight, while we could go another way to
the satisfaction of our worldly desires. We, using
human nature as we find it, and the influences
which are sometimes pitched in by chance, would
find in the general cry that would be raised
against that proposal, the flux essential to Austra-
lian Federation. We would join your hallelujahs,
and also the orating and bombast of the knights
who would be baronets, and the Colonels who
would be Generals, and the little folks generally
who always will be big, with a yell to one and all
to get up and “ chuck the tea overboard.” We
think we might shake Australia together by that
effort, and, to the confusion of many estimable
people, doubtless, shake her also—free, loose. .
* * *
And then, with a soul and a body of her own, and
as good an intent to keep the one as to save the
other she might possibly begin to grow.
Their Excellencies.
If the Sydney dally newspaper would do its duty
it would not fall to us to approach the vice-regal
Court. For we go there neither to flatter nor to
fea&t. We have a few plain words to say, in a very
plain manner, and yet with a proper decorum and
in full dress as It were. Our dress, however, must
be of our usual plain English, and if we fall short
of customary courtesy,', their Excellencies must
pardon us and let the superfluities of the worthy
retired publicans and storekeepers, the exquisite
sons of old colonial sires, and the fair butterflies
of English breeding whose foreheads and china
have all been lost in the process of refinement,
make amends. We can’t try their weapons, having
never proved them.
» m m
Let us get to the point, and the first point we
propose to touch is a certain £lOO cup and a £5
donation. Lady Carington gave a hundred
pound cup to the winner of the Sydney Cup,
Lord Carington sent £5 to the fund for the relief
of four widows and about fourteen orphans at
Lithgow Valley.;And is there fault or sin in either
of these gifts? Not a jot. Both are good deeds.
Why shouldn't her ladyship wear all her feathers
at the Cup and give the winner another cup and
make a nice little speech, and add zest and grace
and the delicate flavour, the flne aroma of true
aristocracy, to the show? Why not, indeed? An-
swer up, Praisb-Qod-Barebones-m;c have no
thing to say. Aud why should not his Excellency
give £5 to the Lithgow people? Don’t know.
Don’t know either why he should or shouldn’t
give five hundred. It is his own business.
* • *
But this do we know, that he shouldn’t let it
appear in print and on the same day that her lady-
ship gave the cup and made the speech, that
he sent that very little cheque. We know, of
course, having taken the trouble to ascertain, that
£5 is a very small fraction of the sum Government
House has sent up to Lithgow. Government
House, so far as giving money is concerned, has
done its duty very well Indeed. But Government
House should have set itself ere this to have
learned a little more of the ways of Sydney people,
and particularly of Sydney people of means.
Government House and Governor Carington
should have understood that a donation of £5 to a
certain fund for a certain purpose would be,
pretty sure to make £5 the limit of individual
gifts. £5l says Plutos:— “ I could well afford to
give £5OO, but who am I that I should set myself
before the Governor ? That public gift of £5
gives excuse to the enemies of all true liberality
for meanness. Look into the heart of it, your
Excellency, follow out its farthest consequences,
and you will see that instead of relieving it robs
the widow and the orphan. Your name to a lump
sum of £soo—far be it from us to say that you who
are always giving should have contributed £soo—
probably have meant a total of £5000; your
advertised £5, only a fraction of your total, as we
have said, means, probably, something under
£lOOO. You didn’t know that; yeu don’t believe it*
Just wait a little and you will see it. You will see,
dear lord of good intent but small experience, that
j ou have got into the meanest set of the wealthy
lower orders the Southern Cross ever shone upon.
But you don’t, you can’t, believe it, of course.
Well, wait, wait, wait. And you dtcline to court
publicity. Fou are not going to blazon abroad
your charity or to distribute your cheques as the
big bookmaker discharges his debts on the public
footpath. That is quite right so long as you do
not sacrifice the well-being of a score of poor
sufferers to your own finer feelings.
■ * *
But, your Excellencies, with all courtesy, with
even a little humility, may we ask you what is the
meaning of this ?
“ We learn that his Excsllency the Governor and
Lady Carington have sent a most kindly-worded
letter of sympathy to Mr. W. R. T. Passmore, con-
doling with him on the Joss of his son Dy the late
tramway accident.”
Yes, it is just a paragraph clipped from a daily
paper. We know you did not put it there. We
know that you did not desire that it should appear
there. We know the little deed of graceful cour-
tesy sprang direct from natural and honourable
impulse. Your hearts are kind, your instincts
are right. You deemed that it would soothe that
poor lady to know that she had your sympathy.
Your letter was simply as pity’s tear. It fell, it
had its effect. It may have been refreshing as a dew-
drop; it should, like a dewdrop, have passed away.
But it got into print. Your Excellencies, how came
that matter to get into print? You did not desire
it to be conveyed to the papers that you had graci.
ously condescended to sympathise with sorrow.
And God forbid that any true mother’s son should
so wrong that poor suffering mother as to imagine
that she would advertise her grief or the consola-
tion she had found. Then what lackey, what
toady, what brainless, chinless dolt, contrived to
meet the waiting reporter, and say to him: “I
thought, haw, you would be glad to know, haw I
that his lordship, haw I—with, haw, her ladyship
thought it welt, aw, to write to the woman, you
know, whoso son was killed in that howid affair?’*
Exert yourself to be rid of him, and don’t spare
your boot-toe in the matter, most excellent Go.
vernor, and we shall have the satisfaction of
knowing that we have not made our visit to Court
in vain.
The Seal of Lagdom on the Brow of Law.
The New South Wales Press is much obliged to
Mr. G. H. Held for his good intentions In intro-
ducing to Parliament a Bill providing that costs
shall not accompany nominal verdicts in libel and
Blander cases. But the Press, while thanking Mr.
Reid for a proposed instalment of justice, sees
that he is only half-hearted in the matter. Mr.
Reid says, for instance (we quote theS.M. Herald
report) :
“ The law might also be amended by abolishing
imprisonment for debt, but he considered that
that would be throwing the door open to men who
might take advantage of their own poverty to
level most atrocious slanders against others. If
such men could not be punished by their pockets
being reached, they should be punished by im-
prisonment. He had no desire to see imprison-
ment abolished in such cases. He thought the Bill
he had to submit embodied a moderate reform. It
did not go too far. In a case where the jury re-
turned a verdict of 40s. the plaintiff should not be
awarded costs He was sensible of the
fact that most of the provision of the law had
been wisely framed, and that, upon the whole, the
law worked well,”
* * *
The Press—let us for the hundredth time and in
the same words go over this matter—the Press
denies that “ upon the whole the law works well,”
except for the lawyers in general, and speculative
legal blacklegs in particular. In Victoria the
jibel-law has been closely assimilated to the pre-
sent English law; in New South Wales the jour-
nalist and the public are still beneath the lash of
the British law of 1780-the very Statute which
sent to gaol Andrew Bent, the manly old printer
of Van Diemen’s Land, and which was so vigor-
ously enforced in Sydney in the happy days when
the adulterine children of Royal bastards and the
profligate irresponsible penny Nbros who ruled
with cat and gallows la the name of their relative,
His Glorious Majesty the Defender of the Faith,
found it necessary to have ample means at their
disposal for protecting themselves from the awk-
ward effects of the truth being told.
« * ♦
Mr. Reid s Bill does not make truth an absolute
defence as in England; nor would it enable a de-
fendant in a libel or slander action to absolve him-
self (as in England or Victoria) from indebtedness
as regards costs by surrendering his estate. Mr.
Reid’s Bill does not remove the “Heads I win,
tails you lose” state of things, which, in New
South Wales, prompts all sorts of enterprising
scoundrels, egged on by legal pettifoggers, to em-
bark in actions for the recovery on technicalities
Of costs and damages for alleged libel or slander.
Mr. Bead's Bill does not propose to remove the
barbarous anomaly by which in New South Wales
—in New South Wales alone—a libel or slander
plaintiff, when he loses his ease, need pay nothing,
for he can become insolvent and laugh at the de-
fendant, and he cannot be sent to gaol. On the
other hand, even should Mr. Reid’s Bill become
law, any scoundrel who on a mere technicality
gains a libel verdict for 415., not only has the body
of the defendant delivered over to him for 13
months, but is thereafter, as now, allowed to
follow him up In insolvency to the day that the
defendant is screwed down in his coffin, on which
article he is permitted to levy an attachment.
♦ * *
In other words, suppose a man is found guilty,
on indictment, of a criminal libel in the Supreme
Court of New South Wales, he may be sentenced
to (say) six, three, or two months’ imprisonment,
loss or more, or he may be merely fined; but should
he, in a civil action with regard to the same alleged
libel, be mulct in 41s. damages and some costa
which he cannot pay, then he goes to gaol for 1 2
months and become a bondsman for ever, as in-
solvency will not relieve him from liability. Thus,
the Judge, who, in the name of society at large
condemns a man for libelling your fellow-citizen,
may only put him in gaol: but the gainer of the
civil verdict, who puts him into gaol, not impar-
tially and on public grounds, as in the case of the
Judge, but merely for the purposes of his private
vengeance, is allowed to incarcerate him for 12
months, to say nothing of the legal powers which
he subsequently exercises over him and any pro-
perty he may acquire thereafter. In one case, the
defendant presumably goes to prison because the
Court has not thought that his case can be met by
a fine; in the other, he goes to Darlingburst be-
cause he is poor. His revengeful j adgment credi-
tor can send him to gaol for a year in a case in
which, were he tried criminally before a Judge, he
would perhaps, on conviction, be sentenced to no
more than a week’s imprisonment.

This state of things, which the Reid Bill does
not propose to remedy, Is worthy ©f Abyssinia,
where they cut steaks from living cattle; it also
reminds one of the Chinese system, under which
a pauperised debtor is handed over, not to justice,
but to his creditors, who are allowed to “ take it
out” of him by plucking off his finger-nails or
gouging out his eyes. It is a state of things ad-
mirably characteristic of the legal system which
practically allowed no counsel to a Frenchman
who could speak no English, and was on trial for
his life; and which hanged him in the face of a
formidable doubt as to his guilt. As the New South
Wales Attorney-General rarely or ever grants his
fiat for a criminal prosecution In any case where
the defendant is worth legal powder and shot, a
rich and pecuniarily responsible defendant
has an advantage as compared with a de-
fendant who is notoriously moneyless. A libel
for which a man is put in gaol, civilly, for a year,
may not be worth an hour’s Imprisonment. On
the other hand, it may be deserving of five years.
Should not the power of imprisoning be in the
hands of the Judges alone, as in other English-
speaking countries, and not in the hands of the
prosecutor, who is sworn to vengeance ?

No libel-law, we repeat, will evereatlsfy the New
South Wales Press which, while it enables an un-
successful man-of-straw plaintiff to swindle a
defendant newspaper out of its costs, at the same
time allows a successful plaintiff to put into gaol
for a year an unsuccessful defendant who does
not pay on the nail costs and verdict to the utter-
most farthing. No libel law will ever satisfy the
New South Wales Press which allows a journalist
to be sent to gaol on civil process, and by a side-
wind; the Press holds that if one man wants to
send another to gaol for libel, he (the plaintiff)
should be unable to do so unless he takes the re-
sponsibility of putting the defendant into the dock
and openly prosecuting him on a criminal infor-
mation. In the words of Mr. O’Sullivan: "Jus-
tice does not in all oases want man and money.”
If it does, let it get them by separate means.

A Chance for the Protectionists.
There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken
at the flood, leads on to fortune, but if neglected
we all know what happens. There is a similar tide
in the affairs of nations and of classes which, if
neglected, will certainly bring a like result—and
surely the present state of affairs in New South
Wales is a full spring-tide to the Protectionist
party. They must not let it pass unimproved-no
one can say when such another opportunity ns®?
arise if this one be neglected. New taxation,
direct or indirect, is admitted on all sides to he
necessary to meet a financial deficit, so that oW
great weapon of the enemies of Protectlon-the
cry of “ unnecessary taxation for party purposes ’
is placed out of their reach. Then our deficit
admitted to be only a temporary one arising P ftrt ’
from extravagant expenditure, and partly fr°
the long-continued drought, and Protective dutie
must, from their very nature, bring in the l ftr * e
revenue at first which will gradually diminish
local manufactures increase. It is not to
capitalists or the politicians that this matter mu
be left, but to the industrial classes whose h
ness it is to secure a sure market for their s
and labour—which are their only capital.
• m ♦ .
As population increases every country wit
sources such as ours must and will have nasnu
tures, but the great point is under what e »
shall we have them—under the “ live and I o * l ~
theory of Protection, or under the “swea 1
doctrines of Freetrade. The following * ro . jjjiy
SM. Herald will serve to show how lu3CU *? _
the labourers of Freetrade England live un jß g
latter. This is taken from an account of »®, geBl
of the Local Government Board at Ba
England: -
“Mr Mount said if a man had awn brean-
children, an they could give him now t
mg 10 oushels of stone was 81b. of broad
money. He could not to.: uiiurtunatein 0


like that, whilst, If they were to offer even 3a. 6d-
a day they would be swamped by thousands of
applicants. After some farther discussion a sub-
committee was formed for the purpose of arrang-
ing a scale of pay, getting the necessary plant, &c.
It was agreed to ask the Local Government Board
to allow the present payment to be increased by
gome 25 per cent, for this special labour. A man
with a wife and child will thus receive 4d. in
money, Bd, of grocery, and slb. of bread. It is ex-
pected that this employment will be eagerly ac-
cepted.”
• • «
If we give our manufacturers no protection
against this semi-pauper labour of England and
Belgium they must in time, as an act of self-pre-
servation, import cheap labour. If the working
men in New South Wales will not move in this
matter, if they continue to leave the local manu-
facturer to be swamped with cheap European
goods Imported— free - then they must not grumble
if at any time those manufacturers, in self-de-
fence, should import free coolie labour to work
their factories, and thus put themselves on a level
footing with the European manufacturers against
whom they are compelled to compete in the open
market. Machinery has now become so perfect
that Indian coolies or Chinamen, who will work
for 3s. 6d. a day, are quite capable of using the
most complicated.
« ♦ *
We are far from advocating any importation of
coolie labour, but It is evident that it would be
perfectly just and consistent with a Freetrade
policy. If a man may start, say, a rope factory in
Hong Kong, where he can get labourers for Is.
a day, and swamp our markets with his goods,
why may he not transplant his machinery, coolies
and all, to the banks of the Parramatta ? On what
logical grounds could the working-men of Sydney
interfere under our present Freetrade system ?
Surely, if the local manufacturer’s goods be not
protected from competition with the products of
this coolie labour, our labourers cannot, with
fairness, insist that they shall be protected from
competition with the coolie labourer himself.
• • ■
It is an invariable custom for the Sydney
Freetrader to point out that in Protectionist
Victoria wages are no higher than in Free-
trade New South Wales. We are prepared
to admit that Protection will not raise wages
beyond the point at which it will pay to
manufacture—but we claim for Protection that
it keeps wages up. In Victoria, with one-third of
our area, with no land to sell, with no navigable
rivers, with no coal, and with a larger population,
wages are as high, and employment at least as
plentiful as in New South Wales. What more
could be said in favour of Protection ? One very
noticeable effect of Freetrade with us—the com-
plete dependence of the labouring classes on two
or three staple industries—is not met with in Vic-
toria, for Protection necessitates multiplicity of
resources and modes of employment. A drought
on the Darling fills Sydney with unemployed, and
were it not that our city is at the present
time practically being rebuilt, the condition of our
labouring classes would just now be miserable
indeed. Whereas Victoria has been for the last
18 months quietly absorbing large draughts of men
from South Australia without showing any signs
Of overcrowding the labour market.
• • •
It is an old stock Freetrade argument that Fro.
teotlon falls heavily on the farmer who, as Spencer
says, “feeds all.” This, we would point out, is
not the experience of America or Victoria; on the
contrary, Victoria owes her agricultural supre-
macy in no small degree to the superiority of her
locally-manufactured farming implements. In
New South Wales farmers have to work with im-
plements manufactured in England or America,
and a plough, however well adapted to the
wants of an English farmer, may be|f quite
unsuitable to a Goulburn wheat-raiser, or
even the same plough that would suit the
latter may be by no means the one most
useful on a Clarence Elver maize-farm. In
Victoria, if a Gippsland or a Loddon farmer wants
an implement made to suit some peculiarity In his
land, he can simply send instructions to any of the
groat Melbourne or Ballarat makers, and in a week
can get what he requires; but how is a Hunter
Kiver farmer to get a barrow or a grubber pecu-
liarly made to suit him at the great Birmingham
factory, where lmplements he buys in Sydney
are manufactured ?
» ♦ »
Then, again, It is always assumed that Protection
permanently increases the cost of the articles
produced, but in this case as well, experience
denies the assumption, for Protection induces so
much enterprise and capital to be embarked in
manufacturing, that local competition very soon
outs down the prices to the mere cost of produc-
tion, plus the smallest margin of profit at which
the manufacturer can continue to produce.
American machinery, paper, carriages, small-
arms, watches, sewing-machines, furniture,
leatherware, and a thousand other articles of
commerce, compete successfully with English
goods, not only in Canada, but in India, China,
Australia, and even in England itself—while, as
anyone connected with Australian trade must
know, our young sister, Victoria, has already
established a very considerable intercolonial ex-
port-trade in manufactured goods; for, though
labour is dearer than in Europe, raw material is
usually cheaper. Judging, therefore, the future
by the past, it is only logical to assume that after a
few years of Protection it will be found that
almost its only result will bo to keep our own
money circulating among our own people instead
of going into the pockets of men at the other end
of the world. When experience proves that local
competition insures to the consumer a good and
cheap article, what is the sense of sending our raw
material to be made up and mixed with “shoddy”
and then brought across the world to us again?
♦ ♦ ♦
And further, as the wealth of a nation consists
largely in the amount it owns of useful and pro-
ductive property—(we use the word property in
its economic sense—) the enormous quantity of
machinery sure to be imported under a system
which promotes and protects manufactures is a
potent argument in favour of this Protective
policy which we have for so long advocated.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tortured Texts.
As Scripture-texts taken by halves in the manner
of Cardinal Mokan, or only quoted when favour-
able, as is the custom of Bishop Barry, are
affirmed to be binding upon this present genera-
tion, it is interesting to notice what results were
attained when the Jews, as a nation, were entirely
guided by the texts which these two fine old
crusted Theocrats would now use to defeat the
present efforts to reform the marriage law. As
the prelates say these dry bones of Scripture are
a national law to us, they should surely desire also
to bring back the degradation of women which
disgraced the Scriptural times. Under the Jews
to whom these much debated verses were meant
to apply, a woman; was a mere chattel: was
not asked in marriage, but was bought by
labour or money, and could be divorced by the
mere writing of her master. She was lower than
an American negro slave. Marriage under such
circumstances was mere concubinage. It was not
even a civil contract, for the woman had no civil
status, and therefore could not make a contract.
Womanly virtue was only valued because of its
market price. Nor is it strange that it should
have been so. The people who believed David to
have been “a man after God’s heart,” read of
his Don Juanesqdb adventures, and of the solace
which the first chapter of the first Book of Kings
announces him to have received in his old age,
and they naturally did likewise. Solomon was
the “ wisest man ” the world had known, yet his
lust required the degradation of 700 princesses and
300 concubines. And most of the patriarchs in
like manner degraded womanhood by indulging
in polygamy. It is inconsistency on the part of
the monogamous Barry, or the celibate Moran,
to try to foist one part of ancient law upon New
South Wales, while they do not try to bring back
the complete system. Let them come forward
and try to initiate legislation to make the
woman of this colony a congregation of
concubines, as the Jewish women were, when
i these much-quoted words were spoken, with no
rights or status whatever, and subject to be stoned
to death by anyone who had a fancy for that
amusement if caught offending against their
“ protector.” Let these political bishops move to
abolish the Divorce Courts, and allow a man to
dismiss his wife with or without a character if she
puts too much salt in the soup, forJtheMews could
do this. Let them petition the Home Government
to send out a Governor with as many wives as
Solomon had. Sir Charles Fitzroy was the best
colonial imitation we have ever had in Sydney,
and, strangely enough, he was as much courted
and flattered by the prelates of the day as any of
his successors have been. In fine, if these bishops
resurrect the dry-bones of a marriage system
which died with the elevation of women, let them
bring back also the complete body of the
system and set it up as an object of human
respect. It is no use to expect a nation
of virtuous women to bind themselves to
commands given to a generation of harlots,
nor to expect men to limit their ideas on mar-
riage to the rules in force before marriage was
in existence. Unless these bishops can show that
marriage was known among the Jews their grandi-
loquent oratory can only Interest those couples
among us whose union is unrecorded in the mar-
riage-register. Dr. Barry’s texts apply to jump,
across-the-broomstick unions, but not to any of a
more formal character.

Political Prelates.
“I am desired to inform you, beloved beretheren,
that by the desire of the Primate the petition
against the passing of the Extension of Divorce
Bill will be at the doors as you pass out, and I im-
plore you all to sign it, to the end that this wicked
attempt to legislate in defiance of God’s Word
may be brought to nothing.” This was the kind of
stuff that came last Sunday from a hundred Angli-
can pulpits. And the righteous worshippers of
the Deity and Bishop Barry signed the petition
accordingly. Mr. John Bdggins, senr., did it be-
cause “he thought as how he ought,” and Mrs.
Bug gins signed for the same sufficient reason-
Then John Bdggins, junr., aged 10, followed in
the way of his pious progenitors by scrawling his
cognomen, and Matilda Bdggins, aged 6,
practised round-hand to the admiration of
her enraptured parent?, and Bartholomew
Bdggins, aged 5, was also allowed to sign
because it was apparent that he did not want to
lose either of his parents by Divorce, and when
some one had written the name of Baby Bdggins,
the generation of Bugginses trooped out to slow
music. And thus the signatures are mounting up
to the total of 100,000 desired by the political
Primate.

Paries and the Yokels.
Sir Henry Parkes has described the constituents
of Mr. O Sullivan as those “yokels,” or, as
another authority has it, “ yahoos down at Quean-
beyan.” Why the veteran threw aside his dignity
to abuse a whole constituency is not very clear,
but, replete with indignation against the Protec-
tionist champion, he probably thought it would
assist Freetrade if he blackguarded the men who
had returned one of the most vehement opponents
of the system. There is, as far as we know,
nothing to show that the electors of Quean-
beyan are less enlightened than those in
other parts of the country, and the contemptu-
ous term used by Sir Henry was probably in-
tended by him to apply to all rural voters.
Considering that he has often been glad to go to a
country electorate when “the door of political
life has been shut against him for ever” in
Sydney, this abuse is as ungrateful as it is libel-
lous. Far from believing that country electors
are less intelligent them those of cities, we are
persuaded that originality and clearness of thought
and mental vision, are more the attributes .of
yokels ” than of cockneys. English history shows
that it is from the agriculturalists that the most
able reformers have come, and it is in the country
that social revolutions have been Initiated and
carried out. The despised yokel Cromwell up-
set English monarchy, and at the present moment
another yokel. Joseph Arch, is working the en-
franchisement of his fellow-clodhoppers. The
English boroughs are nearly always under the
thumb of Toryism. Liberals and Radicals are
bred in the freer and clearer air of the
country. And it is the same in New South Wales.
A mom? the yokels the chief supporters of
Protection are found and the most liberal members
in the House are returned by “ yahoo ” and
“yokel” electorates. Prom among the Inland
dwellers of New South Wales will come the poli-
tical reformers of the colony. It is by no m oans
certain that the land-tax does not in some degree
owe its origin to the efforts of Murrumbldgee
electors who argued with Mr. Dibbs urging it up-
on him as an improvement upon the property-tax
which he was then understood to favour. Follow-
ing up the idea, it is proposed to form a species of
land tax league at Wagga, which will probably be
the prolific parent of other “yokel” associations.
The Sydney Land Nationalisation League has done
good work, but it is upon the shoulders of the
country residents that the chief burden of the
task of re-adjusting the incidence of taxation will
fall. Probably Sir Henry is growing Conserva-
tive in his old age, and dreads the power of the
yokels whom he affects to despise.
The dear, good Bishop of Madagascar wants to
know why the people of Australasia should not aid
him in the mission to the Malagasies—a people
who, we understand, have plenty to eat and don’t
work much, and do no harm to anybody. We’ll
tell the Bishop why Australia should emphatically
object to help in the so-called “ conversion ” of any
niggers, even at the risk of letting the whole
black population of the world tumble into the Pit
and be grilled for all eternity, Australians want
more mission money yet to save the hundreds who
live in squalor in the back slums of Melbourne
and Sydney, and who will be found to be our
brothers and white, once they are scraped and
placed under the tap. The widows and children
of the Llthgow miners who were killed the other
day, are still unprovided for, and even were all
want banished from the land we should still object,
even with our dying breath, to help a set of parsons
who are too weak-minded for any really intellec-
tual occupation, in introducing to blackfellows a
system of civilisation which, while it gives good
billets to the clergy, murders the niggers physi-
cally, whatever It may do for those much-talked-
of abstractions that the missionaries glibly call
their “souls.”

The Sydney D.T. “ acknowledges the very friendly
reference to the influence of the Press, and to the
way in which the Press does its work, which wa 8
made in such cordial terms on Sunday by Rev.
Dr. Jeffbbis.” No wonder. One good turn de-
serves another. Dr. Jeffbbis, who gets his long,
dull, washy, weak, maundering inconsequential
weekly yarns fully reported in a couple of Sydney
daily papers edited by clergymen, would have very
little notice taken of him by an impartial Press.
How many papers are there that would buy as
articles the Sunday night addresses of this shining
light of Congregationalism? The Press Is the
breath of life to Dr. Jeffbbis and to a lot of
other clerical word-spouters. The Press is a good
horse for pious twaddlers to ride. The S.M. Herald
proudly stated the other day that it was bigger
than any London daily paper. There’s not much
to marvel at In that. No London paper gives four-
column reports of the miserable rant cackled by a
set of half-imbecile old women at sixpenny tea-
meetings. The galimatias of the fourth-rate Dis-
senting parsons who are eternally allowed to hold
forth, per medium of the Herald and D.T. re-
ports, would be treated in a very summary way
by any level-headed secular editor: he, finding no
juice in their jeremiads, would flip them into the
dust-bin. As things stand in Sydney, one parson is
edited by another parson, the unhappy result being
that our milk is soured and our breakfast tab le
made generally desolate by the morning paper,
with its gloomy, never-ending columns of witless
'clerical hogwash.
Mobs law and, as a natural result, less justice.
The other day, a young gentleman named “ Fran-
cis Piper, English, 26, and an architect,” stood
behind the spikes and faced the music at Sydney
Water Police Court, and was found well and truly
guilty of stealing—we beg the distinguished pri-
soner’s pardon—of conveying, a £3O gold watch
and trinkets from the fob of a fellow lodger into
his own. Six months’ retirement from the vulgar
public gaze were accorded Mr. Piper, who, while
the sentence was being passed, naively observed:
“ Excuse me, your worship, but before you go any
further might I request you not to give me hard
labour, as I have really never done any in all my
life.” The coolness of the request seems to have
“knocked ” the stipendiary silly, for he omitted the
much-dreaded clause, and so, when Francis—
whose crime was very likely the result of laziness
—returns to the madding crowd, he will have
the supreme satisfaction of being able to hold up
his head In the best society and proudly boast that,
although convicted of being a “ hotel barber,” and
a sneak thief, still he never demeaned himself, or
raised a cloud on his fair escutcheon by doing a
single turn of hard, honest labour. Next case:

haps he-lllls his Pontifical head with the idea that
an organ is an instrument that is banged like a big
drum, oris played by the mouth, after the jew ’s-
harp fashion. If an orchestra is allowed in a choir
at all it should be a full one, not the mongrel thing
his Imminence suggests, tor some of the moat
beautiful portions of the music-scores are written
for the wind and brass instruments. If he really
wishes to abolish s .me of the most objectionable
wind organs in his churches he should do awav
with some of his emi<ty-headed, leather-lunged
preachers. D’ye moind that, now ?
it is evident that the powers that rule the
Australian Mutual Provident Society, hitherto the
safest of Australian companies, have determined
to stretch a point or two in order to the establish-
ment of an English branch. When they proposed
to do so, a three-fourths majority of the member*
present decided against it, whereupon the direc-
tors, refusing to be bound by this division, pro-
cured what was meant to be a vote of the policy
holders'. To each of these latter a proxy form is to
be sent, but the absent voter cannot by this means
notify his decision. It merely empowers him to
authorise some person named to vote, as that
second person may choose. The will of the vroxu
sender avails nothing, it is the person who re-
ceives the warrant who decides the question.
Thus if ten thousand votes be sent by proxy to
anyone, say a director, that director will have
so many votes at his disposal. Against this sys-
tem of disfranchisement of voters, discarded
years ago in the election of directors as being
liable to abuse and corruption, a protest signed by
some 80 of the chiefest men in Sydney has Deeu
handed in, and efforts have been made to obtain a
plebiscite. There seems to have been some irre-
gularity, to use a very mild term, in the tcrutlnls-
Ing of votes for the recent election of olrectors,
put, as it is stated on very good authority that the
Law Courts will be asked to turn their attention
to the matter, it is not. perhaps, wise to discuss
tne proceedings now. The ‘ chestnuts ” must be
tempting when such efforts are made to annex
them. By “chestnuts'’' we mean, of course,
, policies to be obtained in England. We don’t at
all llfce the present attitude of the directors of the

Charles Rivers, the last Waterloo veteran
resident in Ireland has just died, cefc. 103, according
to his own account. Charles claimed to have fought
under Wellington at Salamanca, Orthes and Vlt-

at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. We cannot vouch
for the correctness of the old blood-eater’s list,
with the exception of the item of Salamanca,
where we ourselves received a severe wound in
the veracity. We knew a man of the same name
at the battle of Marathon, but that was before his
time—one of his grandfathers, likely. They were
all good lighting-men, and liked their whisky.
The hoary saying that the devil looks well
after his own has received further confirmation
in the wreck of the steamer Taiaroa off the N Z.
coast. She left Wellington on Sunday morning
with 50 souls on board, some of them Salvation
Army people, and that same day she was wrecked
on the east coast, and only 14 of the passengers and
crew escaped to tell the tale- Several bookmakers
who attended the Island Bay races a few days
before intended to take passages in her. Before
doing so, however, they consulted their oracle by
tossing a coin, and finding that it came down a
“ woman ” they concluded to wait for the next
boat.
Mr. R. H. Yallance, who was drowned in
the wreck of the Taiaroa, was a prominent racing
man in N.Z., and was well known in Australia.
He landed in Canterbury (N.Z.) when a boy, and at
an early age was with Mr. H, Redwood, ®f Marl-
borough, and afterwards with Mr. R. Ray. A few
years ago he joined Mr. Mason, and during their
partnership owned and raced some crack horses.
Mr. Yallance’s body was recovered and buried at
Flaxbourne, near Blenheim, where the racing
brotherhood propose to erect a handsome monu-
ment to his memory. At the Wellington and
Canterbury autumn races everybody wore mourn-
ing in his memory.
The distress in South Australia must be
universal. It has extended from the working
classes to the classes that never work at all. The
Civil servants are to suffer a reduction of 30 per
cent, on their salaries after June 30th, and the
Governor has been reluctantly compelled to dis-
charge his French cook. This last piece of economy
was a bitter trial for Sir William Robinson, but
there was no help for it. Sweeping reductions in
the gubernatorial bill of fare led to strained rela-
tions between Sir William and his chef. Eventu-
ally, M. de Liurnel (that’s the cook} received his
congi, and the modest “ sausage and mashed ” of
Government House is now dished up by a red-
armed Bridget.
Apropos of the alleged embezzlement of
£l3OO by Walker, the great Mokanna of the Ade-
laide Young Men’s Christian Association, the
Kapunda Herald says:—“ The man who goes to
reclaim others, when his own hands are red with
guilt, plays the part of the hypocrite, and when
he falls drags down with him Into the mire the re-
ligion of which he has been the professed ex-
ponent. That convert must be well grounded in
the faith who remains true to his religion when
he makes the horrible discovery that the person
by whom he was guided and instructed is a crimi-
nal.” If these words be true it strikes us that a
whole heap of converts in Australia “ must be
well grounded in the faith,” or else fall from
grace in the most distressing manner.
Mr. Robert Ballard, engineer-in- chief of
N.Q. railways, who has departed from the service
after having been requested by the Minister to
explain an allegation that he had lent to Bourke
and !M‘Bharry, a firm of railway contractors, the
sum of £5OOO at 35 per shent per annum, is the
same gentleman who, a few years since, was given
by the Queensland Parliament a handsome grant
—of some thousands—in recognition of savings
effected in railway construction through his in-
strumentality. Mr. Ballard will now have an op-
portunity of permanently devoting himself to his
favourite hobby—the elucidation of the mystery
surrounding the construction of Egyptian Pyra-
mids, on which he has, we believe, written a book;
and the public will devote itself to elucidating the
still greater mystery attendant on Mr. Ballard’s
little 35 per cent, transaction.
A worse puzzle than that old Scriptural
one of the woman whose seven husbands should
turn up on the Last Day comes down from Towns-
ville (Q.), and, says be who tells the yarn: “I don’t
care to ask whose children they will be in the
Resurrection, but I snould like to know whose
children they are just now. These are the facts.
On Alligator Creek, two men. Love and Dove,
married and settled down. In four years, at the
end of which they had each become responsible
for the parentage of three children, they
found it impossible to agree any longer with their
respective wives. The male Love longed for the
female Dove, the female Love hankered after the
male Dove. They agreed to txchange. Doves
and Loves shifted right about, and since then there
are six more children. My puzzle is; How are
they related to the former broods ?”
The!late Emperor Napoleon, “the man of
Sedan/’ was not generally regarded as a humorist,
although he could occasionally throw off a little
sardonic pleasantry. There has just come to
light a letter written by poor Nap. to Queen Vic-
toria, in December, 1856, which was evidently com-
posed in one of his merriest moods. The Emperor,
in speaking of the engagement between the Crown
Prince of Prussia and the Queen’s eldest daughter,
says:—“l do not doubt that he will make the
Princess Royal happy, for he seems to be possessed
of every virtue befitting his age and rank.” The
sly joker evidently intended the Queen to infer
that her prospective son-in-law was naturally
fond of the ladles. The same criticism would
have applied with even greater force to Brigham
Young in the days of his youth. Brigham
possessed a rare stock of princely virtue.
Mr. Purves, the Melbourne barrister,
famous for his forensic ferocity, had an oppor-
tunity of distinguishing himself in the manner he
loves the other day. He was counsel for the de-
fendant in the libel case Gannon v. Nlnd. Gan-
non is connected with the Gippsland Indepen-
dent, Nlnd with the Warragul Guardian. In
hia cross-examination of the plaintiff, Mr. Purves
caused Mr. Gannon to “ burst into a flood of
tears.” The man who could make a country
editor do this—without filling him up with rum
till he began to talk about his dead grandmother-
must be a being of extraordinary gifts- We would
like to have him over here to cross-examine Mr.
Barnet about the Post Office carvings for an hour
or two. It is time he was made to mourn. The
carvings ho loves so much have made everybody
else (except Signor Sani) weep bitter tears often
enough.
Rev. Jesse Carey, of Ballarat, being dis-
satisfied with the position assigned him as Wes-
leyan minister, has resigned. For weeks past the

of.the Ballarat ministers as to who 1s to have the
largest salary and the most dignified position.

There is something ludicrously ghastly,
remarks an English paper, in the methods adopted
97 crowned heads, and their sycophantic courtiers,
so Conceal and disguise the ailments and inflrmi-
wes under which these royal persons suffer. The
•wttperor of Germany, now 90, is subject to fre-
TJ®ht fits, and falls down head-over-heels. Forth-
«*P n the Court papers are commanded to assure
Public that his imperial Majesty has merely
™et with some trifling accident, such, for example,
stumbling over his sword, which irreverently
intruded itself between the imperial knees. Here,
in England, whenever the Queen shows her-
self to her subjects, the Court flunkeys take
good care that those papers immediately under
their control shall assure the public that she never
looked better in her life I Whilst the truth is, the
Queen has become very infirm, and can scarcely
hobble about, even with the assistance of a thick
stick, upon which she leans heavily.
The Christianity of a Young Men’s Chris-
tian Association is sometimes put to a practical
test. Mr. Alexander Walker, the defaulting Ade-
laide secretary, gave his particular Association an
opportunity to exercise the divine quality of
mercy. However, the members have decided to
prosecute misguided Alexander for the glory of
God and the “sake of example.” That human
charity which the Y.M.C.A.’s so proudly profess
might have prevailed in this matter, save for one
unfortunate suggestion. At a special meeting of
the Association, one of the ex-Presidents proposed
that their establishment should be closed for two
years as a sign of contrition and humiliation for
the backslidings of the late secretary. ’Twas a
beautiful and scriptural sort of notion. But a
funny flinty-hearted Christian knocked it on the
head by insinuating that it would be better to shut
up Mr. Walker for two years, and give him a
chance to express humiliation and contrition.
Verily, verily, it were better to rob a burglar than
to embezzle the funds of the Lord’s elect. The
one may have mercy, but the others—none.
A truly melancholy document is the
affidavit of Mr. Henry Henty in support of his ap-
plication for a certificate of discharge in the Mel-
bourne Insolvency Court. No Australian can
read it without giving a sigh of sympathy
for the honoured bearer of an honoured name. It
appears that in March. 1883, when Mr. Henry
Henty set out on an unlucky trip to Europe he
was worth, in round figures, £90.000. He laid the
strictest Injunctions upon his brother Herbert not
to enter into any doubtful speculations on behalf
of their joint firm. Henry Henty’s words are:—
“ I impressed upon him (Herbert) that at our ages
we required a cessation from dally work, and as
we had enough for own requirements there was no
need to run any risk in our business.” In the face
of these entreaties, the managing partner made
advances and endorsed bills without security to
such a tuno that when Henry Henty returned to
Melbourne in March, 1881, he was a ruined man.
Judge Noel feelingly observed that the affidavit
read almost like a romance. As illustrating the
culpable recklessness of brother Herbert, we may
quote a paragraph relating to that mercurial
“ speculator,” H. Mortimer Franklyn. Mr. Henry
Henty declares:—“ Prior to my departure for
England, Franklyn, whose name I did not then
know, several times called at my office touting for
advertisements, and endeavoured to persuade me
to subscribe or insert an advertisement in some
SHE KNEW HIM.
SARCASTIC WIFE: ‘COMING HOME AS USUAL, I SUPPOSE?”
FOND OF STAYING OUT LATE HUSBAND: “YES, CERTAINLY.”
SARCASTIC WIFE: “ WELL, PUT THIS LETTER IN THE FIRST MAIL IN THE MORNING,
AND IF YOD MEET THE MILKMAN TELL HIM TO LEAVE TWO QUARTS.”
Australian handbook he proposed publishing
(‘ Australia in 1880,’} He became so annoying,
that, I having heard at last
peremptorily ordered him out of the office.”
Yet, on his return from England, Mr. Henty
was amazed to discover that the company
engineered by the same Mortimer was the debtor
of his firm to the extent of oyer £13,000, That
must have been the bitterest pill of ail for this
unfortunate victim of a partner’s folly.
The Maharajah Dhuleep Singh asseverates
that he will go back to India and raise Cain if the
British Government will not give him more cash
to spend. He draws at the present time in lieu of
his claims upon Indian territory, over which our
gracious Queen is now Empress, £35,000 per annum,
but being a man of a reflective turn of mind, and
believing himself entitled to certain reversions, he
does not see why, if he can get more, he should
live contentedly on such a plebeian pittance. The
present writer has an interest in the Maharajah. It
is not much more than a decade now since, not far
from the heavy-browed Wrekin, in the fertile
county of Shropshire, where we were tutoring in
a couple of dead languages a youngster of the
Cholmondeley brood, we happened to be thrown
into personal contact with the princely exile. Of
the big crowd in Squire Cholmondeley’s
the two faces that come oltenest up through
the mist of waters are those of Dhuleep
Singh and Mark Twain. Cholmondeley was
a rare old connoisseur of merit literary,
artistic, scientific, and social. In the shooting
seasons especially, his grounds in Shropshire were
a notable centre of representative people. On the
occasion we refer to Mark did not come up to
anticipations we had formed of him. He was too
well-behaved, too orthodox, too conventional.
On the Sunday of the week he spent there,
he occupied a pew in the little church of
which Cholmondeley was patron, and conducted
himself as regularly as the old Duke of West-
minster who shared the cushion wlta him, or
as the squire who answered to the prayers of the
little Ipaie-faoed parson, and hobbled round with
the plate at the offertory. But the Maharajah—well,
the Maharajah was above anticipations. Aswarthv,
stout, low-sized man, with his veins full of blood,
and his motions full of energy, he had little of the
look of an exile. He was a man one would in-
stinctively trus t. Far away from his own country
as he was he appeared to carry about no memories
that were painful. He was, by much, the best
shot in the grounds. He was, by much, the most
taking man every way. He was the soul of direct-
ness and frankness. He represents now that the
British Government in negotiating about the
value of the rights surrendered by him, in effect,
wheedled him. This we think not at all improbable.
Dhuleep (and Dhuleep’s father is said to nave had
the same qualities) possesses just the character
“ good business men ” like to deal with. Twenty-
five thousand pounds is a highly substantial sum,
and, in the abstract, we know of no sovereign
rights over any people that one payment of the
amount should not be an acquittance in full for;
yet it must be remembered that the Maharajah is
looking at it from a Prince’s point of view, and is
discussing it with others who regard statements
from such a view as evidence. The present state
of the controversy is, that the Maharajah is in-
formed that if he go to India the British Govern-
ment will arrest him, expel him, and stop his screw
altogether.
A Mr. C. B. Deeley, of Derby, is per-
mitted to state in the S.M. Herald that the Kim-
berley (W.A.) goldfield is “going to be the biggest
field in Australia.” He says:-“I bought Bioz.
from two men yesterday, 23az. from another, lloz.
from another, and 7oz. from another. We hear of
another party close to here who have 310 oz. with
them, one piece weighing 19 ounces. It is a beau-
tiful sample of gold, quite as good as the Palmer
gold. What we have purchased runs from soz. to
loz., the pieces being all waterworn, except one
parcel, which was evidently got on the surface
from a rough leader. All I am afraid of is a big
rush of men with no money. This is the nearest
port, and the best road is from here; but the field
is 30D miles inland at least, and poor men cannot
get there. It never will be a poor man’s diggings.
They must have horses.” Diggers who feel in-
clined to “ rush ” will please remember that Mr.
Deeley Is a storekeeper and writes from a land of
alligators, niggers, mosquitoes, dust-storms, and
various other things.
Law laughs at everything in the way of
justice. A few days ago a one-armed man who
had stayed too long quaffing koko at the Japanese
village rolled into Sydney Domain and fell asleep.
Presently the ever watchful park-thief came
along, and was “ going throughhis prey, when
a detective arrived and caught his man in the
very act—in fact, he had to help him to haul his
hand out of the sleeper’s pocket. Nevertheless,
Judge Wilkinson acquitted the prisoner, and, as
the law reads, justly too. It appears that the one-
armed man had his money in his right-hand
trousers pocket, and the thief was found with his
hand in the left. As there was nothing but a heap
of emptiness in the left-hand pocket, the Judge
told the jury to acquit the mas, because he could
not be convicted of attempting to take property
from a place when there was not any there to
take. Then the prisoner stepped down and shook
the one-armed prosecutor by the hand while the
dumb-founded D. went out, stole his own boots,
and then arrested himself for highway robbery.
A story comes from America, where all
good stories come from, of a wealthy teetotaller
who died at sea. He was not doubled up in a
gunny-bag and yanked overboard, as a newspaper
man would have been, but was coiled comfort-
ably Inside a cask full of Jamaica rum and shipped
off to bis folks In Chicago. It was tne first time he
ever came home in liquor, and being strict tem-
perance people his family were greatly annoyed,
and, as often happens in such cases, they didn’t
know exactly what to do with him. Ultimately,
however, they solved the difficulty, and lessened
the funeral costs by having him burled as he was—
rum, cask, and all:
Extract from a private letter received in
Sydney from the “ New El Dorado,” Western Aus-
tralia. We don’t vouch for Its accuracy, but
print it for what it is worth, and in the hope that
people, before leaving the older colony, will make
proper enquiries as to the real prospects of the
new:—“Fremantle and Perth, and the country
within 100 miles, are little else but an ocean of sand.
Nothing will grow. People and animals alike all
have a starvation look. Fremantle has a popu-
lation of about 0000, Perth about 8000, and hun-
dreds of people who drifted here on false repre-
sentations would willingly return home it they
had anything to go with. Town lots are held at
Sydney and Melbourne prices. Not a shilling can
be obtained from the banks. Taking things all in
all, this place is no good, and the best thing you
or any other man can do is to stay away from it.
Carpenters receive 7s. 6d. per day of 9)4 hours*
work; board, 30s. per week. Everything that
people live on has to be shipped here from Mel-
bourne; not even a potato is raised here. The
few contracts that are let are manipulated by a
clique composed of Government officials. A new
man has no chance unless he will work for 7s. 6d.
per day and starve. Tne town has no water, or
at least what little they have is bad. I would not
stay here if they were to give me half the sand-
banks in Perth. I will return to Melbourne on
the next steamer. I say, place no confidence
whatever in anyone who will speak to you in
favour of this God-forsaken country.” We may
add that the writer of the letter is an American,
by trade a carpenter and builder. He went to
West Australia some months ago intending to
establish himself in business as a builder, if pos-
sible. He was prepared to work pjs a journeyman
carpenter until such timo as' an opportunity
offered to invest his capital.
OAT EPITAPH FOR HIM.

Who wore the blue and lectured some
To save his fellow creatures from

He lies preserved in good old rum

Appears and makes a mighty hum,
And wakes him up to Kingdom Come.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From Lloyd’s Weekly of March 13th
‘Mr. Wyatt held an Inquest at Camberwell, on
Monday, on the body of John Ranee, aged 13 years,
son of a sawyer, residing at 10 Toulon-street, Cam-
berwell. The parents of the deceased were very
poor, and had seven other children. Occasionally
they had food at home, but more frequently the
children went to a local soup-kitchen, and with
what they obtained there and at a ragged school,
they managed to exist. According to his mother’s
evidence, deceased had a great craving for food,
and because he could not get any on Saturday he got
into a violent passion and threw himself against
the wall, which he struck and kicked. A moment
or two later he was seized with a fit, and expired
before medical aid arrived. The privation which
the deceased had undergone was shown by the
medical evidence. Dr. Gallic stated that the body
was terribly emaciated and the organs congested, g

To joy eternal come ?
Who knows but he may have a chance to poor
(Who sees another’s pain his own bliss relish es
The more) into the grisly realms of fear
Where torture hellish is ?
Who knows but, as he sits with folded wings
And looks upon the scene with interest, add
leisurely.
With piteous voice the bishops, peers, and kings.
Whose paths through pleasure lay
On earth, will cry to him, “ Good angel I fly
•®or water; hasten for a billy-can—away!” ?
Who knows but he will cheerfully reply,
“ My troubles I anyway.’’

There was a change from grave to gay
at Sydney Royal on Saturday night. The blood-
curdling horrors of Merritt and Conquest gave
place to the slender funnlments of A. W. Pinero.
R rphe Magistrate,” which is the title of the play in
nuestion, is a farcical comedy of nearly two years
standing, with a reputation that is good, and no
doubt, honestly acquired. It Is very light, it asks
no thinking. It does not want much acting. A
widow, Mrs. Farringdon, marries a magistrate,
Mr Posset. This widow has a son by her former
marriage, and to make herself in the eyes of her
husband younger than she really is. she
has to make her boy, Cis. 14, instead of li) years of
ave. Cis, while looked upon as a child, acts as a
sprightly youth of 19, and succeeds in involving
his stepfather in indecorous, and from a magis-
terial point of view, ludicrously pathetic scrapes.
• • •
Mr. Anson played the part of Mr. Posset.
It appears to be the fate of .this actor while in
Sydney to keep on demonstrating that he is fit for
much better business than that which engages
Mm. The talent he displayed in “Grimaldi” when
he first arrived here belonged to a high order. In
Its line tangible triumphs were attainable. His
voice possessed that sympathy of tone which adds
so much to the value of the author s words. But
instead of working through the emotional schoifi,
where opportunities would be given for the d is-
nlav of such qualities, Mr. Anson spends his time
on parts that any moderately good all-round man
could fill. Miss Watt-Tanner, as Mrs. Posset, does
her work with energy. The way she runs about
and finally creeps under the table when the police
enter the Hotel des Princes show that she Is a per-
son on whom a hint is not thrown away.
• • •
Mr. Posset’s intoxication is a strong point
with the audience. He takes too much cham-
pagne or spirit of some kind and carouses wildly.
The semi-inebriate’s attempt to chorus a song or
piaculate some of the inaptitudes of the situation
is the signal for applause. When he appears all
What They Landed For.
Recent Victorian newspapers have been in a state of double-leaded agitation over a Russian Man-of-war which
anchored off the coast, and sent a detachment of men on shore for some mysterious purpose. On cabling to the Russian
Government for an explanation, we find that the men were sent ashore to boil the billy, and not to rob the Cabbage
Garden, or make secret surveys.
drabbled and spattered*With mud. and holding his
sick head between his hands, the house is ravished.
It is in these things the fun is. There is no wit in
the dialogue. It is supposed to be wholly trans-
muted into situation. That shows how much
alike we are now to what our ancestors were when
Fielding and Smollet wrote for them. A good
drinking-bout made an interesting s'jene in those
days. A couple of policemen, a fight with single-
sticks, and a heip of broken furniture, with
drunkards littered about, made a line spectacle.
But Fielding and his friends put a little fancy into
their lines. There was a gleam of wit frequently
let in upon the narrative. Mr. Pinero, noticing
that the resemblance between us and our ances-
tors was one wholly of affection for situation,
treated the wit and humour of language as super-
fluities. Consequently, his Cis Farringdon is a
Tom Jones with the head off He will be liked
better for that. It would unsteady the comedy if
any character in it showed he had any head. That
is why we began by saying that the reputation
“ The Magistrate” has achieved was, in all proba-
bility, honestly come by.
* * *
As placed on the boards, the play has
every chance. The parts are all ably filled. The
movements are smooth. From beginning to end
laughter is spontaneous.

At Sydney Opera House the much-dis-
cussed and considerably-anticipated “Fantine”
was produced on Saturday last. Like a number
of other operas intended to be comic and other-
wise, its chief figure Is a street-singer, who passes
through manifold and much tribulation, from
which she ascends to a lofty position and lives
happily ever after. The English version is by
B.E. Woolf, and from the occasional leyelness of
the dialogue, we are rather inclined to post him as
a sheep in Weolt’s clothing. But as if to atone for
this flatness of parts of the libretto, there are some
quips and cranks which, like the fire at Fletcher ’s
Photographic saloon, are instrumental in bringing
down the house. The music is brisk, bright, and
bubbling, occasionally reminiscent of amither
operetta, but only very sightly so. Miss Plaisted,
AS Fantine, of course has the big end of the work,
and it is such as suits her a meroeil, which, for the
benefit of the uninitiated, we may explain, means
right down to the ground. Her writing-lesson
-duet with Charles Harding in the first act la a
-Simple daisy; of course the lesson ends with some
kissing business. It always does when a pretty
woman and a lovely youth are educating together,
wears ago, when we.were workingi’at the front
- end of our mental training we had a pretty mis-
tress, and with all due modesty, we may mention
that we were a lovely youth. Every day it hap-
pened that some error required that we should
ne kept in, and the punishment was summarily
concluded by osculation. Ah, us I those were
happy days, although the school-marm was not
half so pretty as Grade Plaisted, and was not fit
to sing in the same paddock with ner. Miss Plaisted
also has another song which is likely to be banged
out of half the time-payment pianos in the
suburbs during the next six months; it relates the
wonderful luck of a little sailor who made his
pile in a foreign land.
* • •
Of the cake appurtenant to “ Fantine,” a
remarkably large section goes to Miss Lambert.
Her singing and acting throughout are a heap
better than anything one could expect to see for
three bob circle. Whatever she dots is carefully
done, and whatever she does carefully is worth
watching. Miss Nelly Coates, the wife of Kirsoh-
wasser, shows a decided inclination to wear an-
other—divided-article of attire, but her per-
formance was not exasperatingly humorous. Mr.
Carey acted well throughout, and knocked out his
song, “It’s Perplexing,” so neatly in three rounds
that the referees of the circle made it stand up to
him for two rounds more, when it was again tiat-
tened.withlequal celerity. Kirsohwasser comported
himself artistically, and seemed perfectly at ease
except when in command of his ” Swiss Guards.”
Their performance was provocative of a simple
and unrestrained howl. It was not that they
meant to be comic, far from it, but in an ill-ad-
vised moment Kirschwasser tried to drill them,
and that was the cause of the trouble. “ Present
arms ” was interpreted by one to mean “ fix bayo-
nets,” another obeyed by jobbing a fat chorus-
man in the turn, a third slowly and solemnly
dropped his rifle on to his favourite corn, while
the fourth pointed his piece towards the flies as
though he intended to have a plug atTeboutt’s
new comet, and then a universal yell of “ Why
don’t you go to the Soudan?” hurtled from the
hilarious pit. This noble army of four has repre-
sented half the armies of Europe in their time,
but they hardly seem to have learnt which is the
business end of a gun yet.
♦ * *
We have so far overlooked Charles Hard-
ing, but that is a thing which no one who saw the
opera can do. Which is as neat a compliment as
we can spare him this issue. Taken all through,
“ Fantine ” is a merry and joyous production, and
should become as popular as a money-lender's
murder. When the choruses improve considerably
they will be much better.

The programme at Sydney Alhambra
changes as often ss a country member’s principles,
but with this difference in favour of the Alham-
bra, its chang is always an Improvement. The
new bill, although it contains some relics of the
Middle Ages in the shape of ballads, &c., is 80 de-
grees better than the last, and ought to fetch the
public tor a month to come. Lucy Frazer’s vocal-
ity, Minnie Hope’s figure, Shipp’s feet, and Ida
Francis’ ravishing loveliness combine to make the
show hum.

The struggle which has been raging for the
last month at Sydney Olympic, between the Vital
Spark and grim Adversity, is over, and gloom now
reigns where bottled beer, ham sandwiches, and
varie y business in vain tried to allure the great
unwashed. „

Last week we were saying that colonial
pilgrims to the London Exhibition would be able
to renew acquaintance with ancient “stars” of
Italian opera at Her Majesty’s Theatre. We see,
however, that the season at that house has come
to an abrupt finale. It died from natural causes.
The band and stage carpenters had been worki ig
for “love,” until they wearied of the labour, and
struck for good during a performance of “ Faust.’’
When the manager made his distressing announce-
ment of the situation, certain wags among the
audience pitched coppers upon the stage after
the fashion that prevails at Hallelujah-meetings.
Some of the others went for the furniture, and
carried off nieces of the pit in their outraged
pockets. We are dwelling warningly upon these
details because there is an Italian Opera scheme
afoot in Melbourne. A few well-meaning people
are persuaded that the Australian public is yearn-
ing lor a resurrection of this defunct English fad,
and that a form of entertainment which Is fairly
played out in conservative London, is eminently
adapted to young civilisation in the South. Now
may Heaven forbid that wo should decry the
beauties of Italian operas—such things must be
full of interest, for such as know what they are
all about. We were never far enough advanced
in the language ourselves. In vain have we
attempted to follow Patti, Marie Roze, poor Tiet-
jpns. or M. Faur© with the “ book.” We were a
page behind or a page in front, except at the times
when somebody was shot. Then, looking up,
(falls dead ) in the book, we could get a fresh start.
Taking ail these troubles into consideration, and
speaking as one of the uncultured crowd, we
think that Melbourne and Sydney will be bad
havens of refuge for poor old hunted Grand
Opera, Gilbert and Sullivan, and legs, are what
we can do with at present. Yes.
Beneath the sable folds of the Datnpierian
dramatic banner, a stream of hilarious humanity
has nooturnally swirled, and a generous tribute
has consequently accrued to all concerned in the
uplifting of the murky standard. All of which
means that the “Black Flag” at the Sydney
Gaiety has landed the oof to a moderate extent
during its run. On Friday, Mr. Dampler will trot
out “ Hamlet,” and next day will trot out himself
and take up his quarters at the Royal Standard
Theatre a few blocks lower down, where the
“ Phantom Ship ” will drop her mlzen halyards,
close-reef the booby-hatch, set the sheet-anchor,
and cruise round for a season.

We are delighted to hear by wire that the
production at Brisbane by MacMahon and Leitch’s
Company of a dramatised version of Marcus
Clarke’s “ His Natural Life ” has been “ a remark-
able success,” and has “attracted immense
audiences,” and that “ the Courier has devoted a
three-column notice to the new play.” As we
haven’t yet had time to read the critiques, we are
wondering what the piece is like—whether it con-
veys a really good impression of the book. If it
does, then it should admirably suit the aristocrats
in authority at the old Moreton Bay convict estab-
lishment. Slaughter-house drama, love and mur-
der run riot, ought to be exactly their metier.
Prom the time that Maurice Prere is intoxicated
with the cow-like breath of the languorous Sara
Purfoy up to the very last torture-scene
in the volume, the play should hold like
glue. The telegram sent us opens up a 610-acre
area of the most fascinating Who
plays Mr. Gabbett, and does that gentleman chop
down and gobble up on the stag© one after an-
other his five pals? Does he cook them au gratin,
or eat 'em raw? Does the colossal “State Scourger
and Executioner” of whom Bobby Byrne and the
Brisbane people in general seem so proud, oblige
by enacting the part of Warder Troke,—and is
Carmichael, the man whom the Brisbane authori-
ties apparently flog every day in the week except
Sunday?-is he let out of gaol by virtue of a habeas
corpus under the hand and seal of Charley Lilley,
1.0. G. r., C.J,, to impersonate Rufus Dawes?—and,
if so, do they carry away Mr. Dawes’ cuticle in a
dustpan? We have long yearned for the advent
of the Cannibal Drama, and on the enterprising
firm of Mae Mahon and Leitch rests our hope of
happiness. Upon them depends our only present
chance of wallowing for three or four solid hours
In Man-Spinning and Anthropophagy.
• * *
In one thing, the advertising, the managers
of this interesting production show a heap of
genius. Dally they send an amateur chain-gang
to march all over Brisbane, and the dress and
general appearance of the hireling convicts is a
magnificent draw.

George Darrell was doing good business
in New Zealand at latest advices. G.D. went in for
singing some of Rickards’ songs, who threatened
George with pains and penalties, but that bump-
tious Individual defied the comic singer and
wanted to see hla powers of attorney, rights, &o.
Eventually matters were amicably adjusted
Harry Rickards and the Rayner Bros. Co. have
not struck oil in NZ. Harry Rayner has been
very ill, and the Wellington critics scarified some
of Rickards’ performances, notably a sketch en-
titled, “ I’m & married man myself,” saying that it
was a “low tap-room performance.” Rickards,
indignant, made an ad misericordiam plaint to the
public. Liddy, his agent, withdrew the ads. from
the offending paper. Bhv biz. prevailed-hence
a peck of trouble.... John E. Sheridan, the “Widow
O'Brien,” has a host of novelties in store for his
patrons. It is his intention to remain in Sydney,
and with his experience and repertoire he should
be able to succeed in keeping the ball of amuse-
ment rolling for an indefinite time The Grenfell-

YE TERRIBLE TALE OF YE SHOPGIRL, AND
YE CHURCH SOPRANO.
Belinda Brown was her name, and she was a
bride of 12 months and a day. We wish to be par-
ticular with this chunk of imformatlon, because,
as Garden Honey would say, Tempos fugit, and
moment by moment tne days grow shorter with
us all. The trutn of this assertion may not burst
on our readers in full bloom at once, but it will
gradually grow upon them in a style that cannot
be torgotten. To return to our mutton, however,
Belinda Brown had a voice that could bore a hole
In a seven-inch plank, and snorted louder than the
snore of a Ministerial stonewaller when an Oppo-
sition member is doing a spell of “ stonewalling.”
Selina Smith was the shop-girl’s name, and she
sang in the same choir as the blastiferous Brown,
but she had an organ so sweet that she could coax
down sparrows off a telegraph line to listen to .it.
Consequently theie was a North Pole coolness be-
tween the pair. By some strange, and wholly un-
accountable means, it came to Belinda's 6x4 ears
that the summer shopping season had “ arrove.”
It was the festive season when nothing but the
bob-tali top knot of the calico elerkess Is seen
above the festive shop-keeper’s board, and tower-
ing pile of mousseline de lalnes, and pates-de-foie-
gias, and the like, cause the millinery counters to
groan beneath thoir jackass loads, when Belinda
trooped into the emporium In which Selina was
engaged, and after giving her silvery-throated
rival a ton of trouble looking for something ‘'just
a shade lighter,” was hauled up short by Selina’s
delicate hint: “ I would try this remnant If I were
you, Mrs. Brown—it hides the dirt so admirably.”
“ Ba«e wretch thou diest m one act to hurdy-gurdy

seven or eight years ago I sprained my back in lift-

you for a Belt, I never was well. Excruciating
pains in the back and muscles used to attack me
with alarming persistency until really I could never
depend on freedom for a single day. Having tried
so many things ineffectually, you cannot wonder
that I purchased your Dr. Scott’s Electric Belt

you that since commencing to wear it I have been
entirely relieved and have not suffered from any
of my old symptoms since. lam now completely

—“I cannot speak tod highly of your Dr. Scott’s

of relieving pain. For a very long period I suffered
from acute backache—one of the most distressing

ever, and as a last resort I tried your Dr. Scott’S
Electric Belt. The effect was almost magical. The
pain seemed to leave me instantly, and I have never
felt the slightest inconvenience from it. I have
recommended your Belt to scores of my friends,

BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
The N.S.W. Baseball Association held its
first match last Saturday, when the Sydney beat
the Union Club. There was a banquet afterwards,
whica was intended to be a big affair; but nearly
all the eloquent notabilities sent apologies. Mr.
Sam Cook, doss ot the B.M. Herald, proposed the
toast of “The Baseball Association," and Consul
Griffin, who presided, artfully began his reply by
referring to Mr. Sam Cook aforesaid as “a distin-
guished Journal ! stl” Barrii g Samuel’s historic
effort as a Darlinghurst interviewer, we have never
known him to perform miracles in the distin-
guished journalist line. However, Mr. Griffin’s
compliment had its effect, for in M inday’s Herald
do we not find the proceedings, including Mr. Sam
Cook s dismal oration, reported in full, and do we
not find it recorded, upon the authority of Mr,
Consul Griffin, that Mr. Sam Cook, of the 8 M.
Herald, is a distinguished journalist ? The
illustrious Consul, who has apparently come all the
way from America only to sit at the feet of the
Jay nil and llloquent One, Informed the afflicted
feeders that “ tue game of baseball, although of
modern origin, is a marvellous improvement on
the ordinary game of ball which the Spartan
youths took such extraordinary delight in. It is
also superior to the style of play which afforded
such amusement to the Athenians that they erected
a statue to Aristonious for the great skill he dis-
played in the game. In America, wa have not
gone quite so far as the cultured Athenians, but
there are many who believe that such veteran
nlayers as John Kelly, G. A. Woods, and Zaoh
Phelps, the last of whom is a native ot my own
town, deserve the highest honours appropriate to
the field of sports.’’ Aristonious and—John Kelly I
Ye gods! Any man who talks to a company after
a good meal about Spartans, Athenians, Aristonl-
cus, and Zaoh Phelps, deserves—well, what new
punishment can be provided for such a man ?
Baseball is only “ rounders,” after all, and ten
columns in the Herald won’t wipe out that fact.

Sydney bicyclists may sigh for another
metropolitan track, as the Association Ground
trustees have thus early commenced to grind
them down. Last year the Sydney Bicycle Club
gave the trustees a quarter of the takings, and in
the matter of complimentary tickets ware limited
to 500 single and a certain number of “ party ”
tickets. This year the ground authorities ass a
quarter of the takings, will allow 500 singles, but
have stopped the “party” tickets altogether.
Last year the trustees received £3OO for the use of
the grouno |for Saturday afternoon, and over
the four meetings held during three years the
Sydney Cmb have put £5OO into the hands of the
ground people. The senior bicycle club runs all
the risk over these meetings, the item of advertis-
ing alone totalling £350. Should the afternoon
turn out wet, the club would be n-ined financially,
and as they run all the they naturally object
to putting a clear £3OO into the hands of tne
money-grubbers, and then be restricted as to
complimentary tickets, more especially as they
lose 3s. 31 to the ground’s 9d. over each “com-
plimentary” admission. The old days of compli-
mentary meetings, when bicyclists ran for ibu iun
of tbe game, have given way to quasi-professional
and big-prize meetings held with the object of
drawing big gate-mouey, and believers in bona~
fide amateur sport may taank the trustees of the
Association Cricket Ground for the signing of its
death-warrant They certainly were never ap-
pointed with that object in view.

There is a diversity of opinion amongst
those “ who ought to know, you know,” over me
defeat ot the rn.S.W. crew in the international
eight-oar race. One party puts it down to the
fittings, and the other to the scratchy stroke with
which Bros took his men away. Until toe men
are thoroughly used to the long slide and swivels,
and a tau trial given, we cannot see how the new
fittings can be condemned. Tuat they did not get
a fair trial in the late race, in more ways than
one, there cannot be a doubt. The men had not
sufficient time to become • at home,” and had
Bros intention been to damn the new fixtures, he
oouid not have gone about it in a better way than
to start away at a stroke bordering on the fifties,
the distressing nature of wnich may be gatnerea
from the fact that George Seale, with his acknow-
ledged wonderful staying power, fell to pieces
eany in tne race. A trial of the two styles will
prouably take place first time the M.RC. and
S R.O. meet in an eight-oar, for, no doubt, the
M.R.C will adhere to Brett’s belief in the long
slide and swivel. Of one thing we reel pretty
sure, that if the new fittings are to become a suc-
cess, 38 lifting strokes will be the maximum at
which pace will be got out of the boat. At the
first we objected to Brett coaching the crew; and
had another ooaoh been selected, and the veteran
stroked the splendid stuff he could have placed
behind him, the Welshmen would, in all proba-
bility, not have made quite such a “ holy show” of
themselves and the new fixings.

ing the running for the Steeplechase without

ning a de.it heat for first place, the owners very
sensibly agreed to divide. The A.J.C. Plate fell a

The principal attraction at Foley’s Hall
on Saturday night was the meeting of Mick

four-round Queensberry encounter. Duffy was
outfought in every particular, and pretty well
knocked to a standstill in the third round, but
with great pluck he stood before Dooley till the
finish of the fourth round, when Jack Thompson
decided the match in Dooley's favour. Several
other sets-to were gone through, the best being
four rounds between the bantams. Waller and
Harrigan, who showed excellent science and hit-
ting power with both hands, Waller, if anything,
proving the better of the two. Murphy, the New

“ Hogsheads ” and “glasses ” were at it on
the Association Ground on Thursday in the shape
of a brewers' and hotel-keepers’ cricket match.
As the latter had included in their eleven several

sion that the perfume of swipes and fusil oil has
a tendency to create obesity, it may be said that
they were fairly represented. But the brewers’
team waajmostly composed of clerks, who were,

While in Melbourne the “hatful of
cricket ” was deputationised by about 30 ladles
with reference to the introduction of muscular
development amongst the feminine portion of the
Cabbage Garden. It is said that there is every
possibility of a ladles’ intercolonial cricket match
being played either la Sydney or Melbourne next
year, the proceeds to be offered to the gay and
festive promoters of this novelty.
* * ♦
The first innings in the Intercolonial
Junlor match was remarkable for the fact that 10
men scored 31 runs between them, without a
single “ duck " being recorded. The whole day s
play—producing a total of 140 runs from both
sides—was about as dreary an exhibition as the
most ardent admirer of “ careful cricket ” could
wish for. N.B.W. made things more lively on the
Monday, but the chief entertainment was pro*
vided by the holiday gentry assembled round the
rails, who roasted O’Hanlon so unmercifully for
his blunders In the field that the poor fellow ap-
peared to lose his presence of mind altogether.

The Duke of Westminster’s unbeaten eolt
Ormond won the Two Thousand Guineas Stakes,
defeating Minting and Mephisto. Ormond is a son
of the Duke’s sensational Derby winner. Bend Or,
and Mephisto, rather singularly, is sired by Robert
the Devil, who ran Bend Or to a head in the Derby
and subsequently defeated him over longer dis-
tances. It remains to be seen whether history
will repeat itself in the Epsom event, and the
descendants of the celebrated rivals run first and
second. Minting, by the way, is the son of Lord
Lyon, the Derby winner of 1866.
* ♦ ♦
The intercolonial boat-race provoked very
little wagering in Melbourne, and though the local
men were favourites for choice, public opinion
inclined rather to the chances of N.B.W. In a few
years time, when those contests have gained in
interest and the public find more opportunity for
criticising the practice of the rival crews, we may
expect the result of the intercolonial race to be
foreshadowed by the “market” with as much
certainty as is the Oxford v. Cambridge event.
Only twice within the last 10 years has the betting
at the start of the University race been at evens.
On the first occasion the crews rowed a dead-heat
and on the second (this year) Cambridge won by
6ft. only. On y once or twice in 20 years have odds
been laid on the losing crew, and then the market

down Sturt-street, Ballarat, one day last week.
The fat and pursy sharebrokers on the Corner im-
mediately tore after him. They thought that he
had come into town with the view of turning
broker. Yet, from what we know of them, they
need not have been afraid. If he had done so, he
very quiet on the subject of his little trip to Eng-
land. By cable we learn he saved the life of a
little boy who fell into the Thames, and he has
been matched to row Bubear on the 3rd June.
Bubear is the man in whom the English papers, a
short time back, said they had a second Uanian.
What a come down, to row a colonial fourth-class

From the brilliant brevities of the
Nooze;-“ Cerise and Biue yesterday; many sports
look rather blue to-day.” Tnat’s so. And they

Alfred’s tipster, and backing Brown and Rose.

The awarding of ihe trophy for the best
fielding on the siae of t he N.S. W. Eleven in the re-
cent intercolonial match has given anything but
general satisfaction. It was almost unanimously
thought that Toby was entitled to the distinction.

In the out-of-the-way township of Dun-
gog is a batsman (Bignell), who could knock
splinters off most of our crack batsmen of Sydnoy
in a big bitting contest. During a match on Easter
Monday against the Conservative (Sydney) Club
this Dungog “ Bannor ” knocked up a score of
103 by as fine an exhibition of full and clean hit-
ting as could be desired.

Here’s a wrinkle for the Never-Touch-Its.
The chairman of the Brisbane Blue Ribbon Gospel
squad suggests that ail the temperance bodies
should combine and purchase the right of selling
refreshments at the booths during the races, and
then provide nothing stronger than raspberry
balm; and soda-water. Let us consider the effects.
Firstly, a lot of people would stay away from the
races; secondly, nobody would drink raspberry-
balm; thirdly, the teetotallers would lose a thou-
sand or so on their deal; fourthly, if the saints ran
up the price of the booths, the wicked race-club
would profit exceedingly, and the publican would
reimburse himself for his extra outlay by charging
a shilling for all drinks. We have looked all
round tha matter and see no way out of it for the
men of soda-and-milk.

At the fruit-scramble given by Boyle and
Scott, in honour of the visit to Melbourne of the
N.S.W. junior eleven, the sportive Scott orated
thus:—“lam glad tojnotlce that, at last, Royalty
will patronise cricket, as one of Her Majesty’s
grandsons will very likely take a part in the next
Oxford and Cambridge match. I think cricket will
go ahead when patronised by royalty.” Yerral
yerral these are glad tidings, indeed. The princely
cricketer will have a big batting average, we
swear; for any bowler would rather die than send
a scion of royalty to the pavilion without double
figures opposite his number. No prince of the
House of Brunswick will ever be stumped while
there is a British tax-payer to bleed.

The Sandhurst bowlers beat the Balmain
bowlers on Saturday, and within 24 hours a new
comet appeared in the west, Just under Orion
—which reminds us. “ Did you ever read R. H.
Horae’s 4 Orion ? ’” we once.asked an editor for
whom we dished up copy. “ Don’t think I have,”
would have left that town without hi« brush and
with very little skin to apeak of. The iEsop of the
future will take as his type of cunning, not the
fox, but the Ballarat sharebroker.

In connection with Mr. D. Scott’s little
groVel) a correspondent writes us:—“lt may be
fdmarked that royalty has not usually exercised a
very elevating influence upon any sport it has
been graciously pleased to patronise The conneo-
tlda of George IY. and his brother William with
the English turf did much to bring races into dis-
repute. Odckflghtlng and the prize-ring were
comparatively decent sports until kings smiled
upon them. If a prince of the blood (God bless
Itl) is really going to the wickets in a University
match, we suppose a sort of court etiquette will
be introduced into the hitherto respectable game
of cricket. His Royal Highness will be favoured
With slow full pitches, and it he gets bowled by
accident, the umpire will fall on his face and cry,
•No ball.’ None of the royal hits will be run out
and they will all count as sixers.”

A Melbourne parson complains that “ the
smile of young girlish beauty is bestowed upon
men whose hearts are as corrupt as human hearts
well can be, and tender white fingers lingeringly
clasp the hands that I, for one, would not willingly
touch ” Humph I how innocently this parson
shows his hand. One of those corrupt ruffians has
evidently cut him out. ’Tis a bad Job, but he must
make the best of it. We’ll endeavour to soothe
his wounded feelings with a song.—
An Adelaide telegram advises us that
"Mrs. Macdonald has just died at Truro,aged 107.”
What sad experiences were hers I Pass the jews-
harp
We know what is the matter—
Once you wooed a simple maid,
But some masher, skilled to flatter,
Cast his sinful sheep’s eyes at her.
And his dandy talk and chatter
In her bosom havoc made;
So, although you see her danger.
We are very much afraid
You have little show to change her
Young affections and estrange her
Prom that nicely-tailored stranger,
In his raiment rare arrayed.
You must find it very “riling,”
It must horrify you much
When you see the masher smiling
At the damsel so beguiling.
Or his guilty hand defiling
Her small fingers with its clutch,
And she too that paw caressing
Which you would never touch;
But, though shocking and distressing,
’Tis a wrong there’s no redressing—
She prefers his style of dressing,
And his toothpick and his crutch.
Sir, there’s little sense in railing
At a thing you cannot mend;
All your weeping and your walling
Will be worse than unavailing:
Mashers are the women’s failing—
Beauty’s Don Giovanni’s friend;
’Tis a strange infatuation,
But on this you can depend:
Though you threaten with damnation
Every masher in creation,
Quite unchanged the situation
Will remain until the end.
THEN AND NOW.
Mm. Macdonald’s in Heaven,
She’s taken her leave of our stage,
Her years were one hundred and seven
(A very respectable age).
We guess she died happy, because
She’d little occasion to mourn,
For the world’s not the place that it was
When Mrs. Macdonald was born.
In seventeen seventy-nine
(That was just the year of her birth)
Men drank their six bottles of wine,
And gave themselves over to mirth,
Arm-in-arm the good roysterers rolled
Home with the milk in the morn,
And were lavish and free with their gold
When Mrs. Macdonald was born.
Cant hadn’t come into vogue
As a thing on which hypocrites trade;
A man who did wrong was a rogue,
No matter how often he prayed;
A judge in those Jovial days
Would have laughed a blue ribbon to scorn—
Oh I we’ve altered a lot of our ways
Since Mrs. Macdonald was born.
It makes us unhappy to think—
Now snivel in pulpits abounds—
That parsons would formerly wink
At swearing, and followed the hounds;
The "cloth ” to good cheer was inclined,
Nor sought to look lean and forlorn,
And it had the respect of mankind
When Mrs. Macdcnald was born.
Independence has gone out of date
And grovel is rife in the land*
They only are reckoned as great
Whom royalty takes by the hand,‘
Poverty is looked on as crime—
’Tis money alone can adorn
A mortal and make him sublime
Since Mrs. Macdonald was born.
So, since seventeen seventy-nine—
The year of our heroine’s birth—
She noted the steady decline
Of manners and men upon earth;
Indeed, it had been very well
If the Archangel Gabriel’s horn
Had sounded Society’s knell
When Mrs. Macdonald was born.
Political
Points
Newcastle Herald on Parkes’ present in-
fluence: “Heean only be compared now to the
old giants In Banyan’s Immortal allegory, who
roared and gnashed their teeth at the passers-by,
but ooulddo no more.”
Hamilton (Vie.) Spectator prophesies
that “ one of the results of the return to power of
Mr. Gladstone will be, in all probability, a great
European war. It is by Russia that the lighted
match will be applied.”
Ireland’s population is 5,160,000, whereof
the Roman Catholics number 4,010,000. A fraction
of the remaining 1,500,000 Protestants are being
egged on by raving Orangemen and howling Tories
to take up arms to oppose the Home Rulers.
The point secured by Gladstone seems to
be that if his Irish proposals are rejected he carries
away with him sufficient support to compel any
incoming party to take up the work, advance a
more acceptable measure, or be turned out.
Burns, the London Socialist, thinks that
exportation of the peers is the best remedy for
English remedy. This shows how selfish Socialists
are. They don’t care what country the aristo-
cracy are turned loo c e upon so long as England is
freed of them.
Cardinal Moran says the Catholic Church
does not recognise any authority on the part of
the Civil state to dissolve the marriage bonds.
Very good. The Civil state dissolves them and
does not recognise any civil rights of the church
in dealing with people so separated.
As a proof of the depression existing in I
England we see that in ’B5 40,000 men joined the
Regular Army, an increase ol over 4300 on 'B4. It
is the largest enlistment since '5B. The total num-
ber of applicants was 69.000 ; 514 out of every
thousand were physically disqualified 1
Dr. O’Doherty, of Queensland, who now
sits in the Commons, said at the Bt. Patrick’s ban-
quet at Westminster that “Irishmen would not be
true to their country and their name it they did
not make Ireland rather a weakness than a
strength to the empire until justice was done.”
In the debate re Disestablishing the An-
glican Church In Wales, it transpired that the
total population of Wales (1881) was 1,343,237. Of
these, only 217,400, “ a miserable minority,” belong
to the Church, the remainder being what they call
in England "Nonconformists”—people who con-
form to what they please instead of to what the
“ miserable minority ” please.
The Duchess of Marlborough (bless her
heart I)—not the Dilchess who divorced the Duke
for kicking her while she was in an interesting
condition, but a new, and so farunklcaed, Duchess
of Marlborough—lent her presence to the opening
of the Richmond “Dames’ ” Habitation of the Pri-
mrose League. In her speech (hats off, please) the
Duchess lent herself to say:-“If Mr. Gladstone
succeeded in handing the government of Ireland
over to agitators and rebels, it would not only be
finally ruining Ireland, but striously endangering
the welfare of the Empire.” (Cheers,) Dear, dear,
what must Gladstone think of himself after that ?
Our long-headed friend, the Russian, who
breakfasts off a jump of black bread, and washes
it down with a shiver, is by means of v irriga-
tion, making oases along the desert route to the
Indian frontier. One of these artificial oases is
already completed and will support 250,000 persons.
We want a few Russian regiments to make oases
in the N.B.W, back-blocks. Viewed in that light,
the much-dreaded Cossack Invasion would by no
means be an unmixed evil. If we could only get
an army-corps of these bear-skinned ruffians at
work in this much-governed country, they’d fore-
stall the water commission by at least two cen-
turies. \ \
N.S.W., which “helped the mother
country in her hour of nedd ” by sending troops at
ss. a day to aid the red-coats in slaughtering nig-
gers, has given the Hawkesbury bridge contract
to a Yankee firm at ±327,000. “ Australians,” says
the British Australasian “ would have very
much preferred to see a British name re-
corded on the Hawkesbury bridge.” Bosh I Aus-
tralians want to get as much as they can for their
money. Politically speaking, they would pasture
the Soudan donkey and the Soudan goat on the
graves of their grandmothers If there happened to
be money, in the transaction. It is this deliberate
letting to foreigners of a big bridge contract that
assays all the blather of the Jingo “ patriots,”
“ Pikkax,” in the Sydney Evening News
oa Thursday, put a 7in. knite under Sir Henry
Parkes’ fifth rib thus“ Sir denry (in his speech
on Wednesday’s motion of adjournment) began
with an agreeable anecdote illustrative of the evil
effects or spasmodic or accidental legislation
which told how, in ooasequenoe of a silly person
from California having presented a pistol at a
member of the Australian Club, a law had been
passed In N.B.W. making It Illegal for anyone to
carry arms. This anecdote he related with a fine
forgetfulness of the Treason Felony Bill, of what
ho and a now eminent (in his own eyes) Journalist
did when the lunatic O’Farrell was in gaol, and of
that remarkable apparition, the Kiama ghost.”
At a recent sitting of the Commons it was
resolved, on . the motion of Sir W. Haroourt,
that “ Wednesday next, being Ash Wednesday,
the House should meet at 2 Instead of 12.” Omy
one member, Sir Peter Pease, objected to this, on
the ground that there was urgent business to be
done, but the House solemnly carried the motion
by a large majority of 74. It shows what a grip
the Establishment still has on the upper ten in
England when the country’s business can be de-
layed over such an affair. Ask the next 12 Aus-
tralians you meet what Ash Wednesday is all
about, and nine out of 10 of them will only thins,
of hash as pronounced by so many English provin-
cials. As well ask them what Tripe Tuesday is.
In England the land-tax contributes little
more th n £1,000,000 out of the taxation total of
±85,000,000. It is less than one-tenth of the Inc >me-
tax, and Is not equal to one-twentieth of Customs
and Excise duties. Further, it is estimated bv Mr. F.
Harrison to be .only one-two hundred and sixtieth
yearly value of agricultural produce in Eng-
land. In every other country in Europe land Is
the basis of taxation, but the English landholders
in the reign of Charles 11. managed to shift their
just burden on to the shoulders of whole popula-
tion of the country, and land which up to that time
was the chief contributor to the National Trea-
sury, has been practically exempted from taxa-
tion ever since. Australia in this respect has oare-
tully followed suit.
“It is notorious,” says Vanity Fair,
“ that at least two-thirds of the British so-called
ships of war are almost worse than useless; and
this is true of every class, from the largest to the
smallest. 1 have in the course of the last, few
years seen a great deal of tae Mediterranean
Squadron, which is generally supposed to be made
up of our crack ships. On one occasion I went on
a short cruise in one of the smaller vessels, which
was occasionally used as a despatch-boat. On
account ol the defective condition of her boilers,
her maximum speed had been officially out down
to seven knots an hour ; and then, to save coal, we
being a thrifty people, her commander had In*
structlons not to exceed five knots, except under
special circumstances. This was at a time when
our relations with the neighbouring Republic
were by no means of the most friendly kind.”
This hypothetical case, which may soon
become real, was recently communicated to Mr.
John Bright by a respected Liberal and Freetrader
in the North of England, for his opinion in the
following words:—‘‘ln the event of the imports
or American cotton goods becoming so great and
of such low price as to cripple the English manu-
hJGturer Q f such goods, causing a general closing
of English cotton factories and throwing out of
employment some 3,000,000 of workpeople, will it
be better that these people should lounge about
the streets idle, dependent upon the rates for the
support of themselves and their families, or that a
small duty should be put upon imported cotton
goods, and these 3,000.000 workpeople remain oc-
cupied at their looms?” This swamping of the
English market has already happened in many
branches of trade, and the fact is, more and more,
forcing on the protectionist agitation in England.
In an article on hereditary legislation,
Reynolds goes so far as to assert that the wisest
fathers have the silliest sons. The late Lord Cairns
was an able man; his son Gumboil is the laughing-
stock of England. The peerage bristles with nin-
compoops and noodles, “ the tenth transmitters of
a foolish face,” whose fathers were superb
thinkers, doughty warriors, students of science,
and statesmen of renown. But a generation
elapses, and the once honoured named is hawked
round at the heels of a concert-hall chorus, or
goes to add another to the silly conquests of a
common trull. Even the Titanic Cromwell failed
to beget sons with anything like his iron stamina
and grip; the Duke of Wellington’s successor was
an idiotic sot; and if the Lords were polled
through it would be very generally found that the
man whose intellect won the title, had left behind
him nothing but addle-pated incapacity to in-
herit it.
Election address from the Brisbane
Courier:— “ To the Independent Electors of
Fortitude Valley,—At the request of my fellow
men and women, I place myself before you not for
any pride or honour, but simply to do my best to
bring toe colony of Queensland to perfection as a
nation, so as that Britons shall not be blotted out
for ever. lam a white man with red hair. I can-
not see or understand why I should try to make
laws for coloured men, when one of them said the
other night that he knew as much as me and more.
I have nothing against him, but let him build a
colony for himself and glory in his colour, be good
to his people, and also to his wife. I advocate good
wafted, say .-7s. per day for labouring men, 10s. for
tradesmen, and more for men who is the guides of
trade. I will sit with Samuel Walker Griffith, and
do my best to assist him in every way, but if he
tries to reduce the good things that God intended
for man and women, I shall oppose him. lam an
employer of labour. I challenge any man or
woman to prove that for the last twelve years in
Queensland that I did not pay the wages, I referred
to above. Gentlemen, if you vote lor me, I will

on, and I will explain my views in person. John !
Cusack, Ann-street, Valley. 33rd April.”
The three looked big with fate
as they sat on board H.M.S. Nelson during the I
gala days of last week. They were the flowers of
the legislative systems of three colonies. It was
natural that they should issue an ordinance for-
bidding approach to them during their delibera-
tions. Even Premiers sometimes advance foolish
notions, and in an informal Ute-a-tete buttress
them with still more foolish reasons. It was
prudent, therefore, to keep the man with a note-
book off. It may appear that Admiral Tryon was
the inspiring cause of the deliberations taking
place at sea. But if there had been no Admiral,
this might have happened. The Queensland
Premier has acquired a settled taste for exer-
cising his qualities of statesmanship on board
a boat. Wnen signs of a political tangle show
themselves up at Brisbane the Premier rounds up
his Ministers, drives them down to the ferry, and
if the Government schooner, Kate, is not handy,
pushes them into something with two sides and a
keel, and proceeds to sea. Experience goes to
show that the method has something to reeom-
iinendit. The Ministers—every man snarling at
another when in the heart of Brisbane— return
leaning on one another’s arms, and smiling be-
nignly. There was a time when people said Mr.
Griffith liked to take his Ministers across the
harbour to keep them from another bar Jfnr

Its populace—the populace that dared to dictate,
through the chosen tools of its arrogance, what
licence water carts should pay, is composed of
yokels. “ The bright sun rises to his course, and
lights a race of yokels—he sets, and his last beam
falls on a yokell” Yokels administer law in its
courts, yokels appear before them for judgment,
yokels head ’em, and “ring in the tail-grey ” round
corners, yokels pervade the whole place; female
yokels, in the brazen disguise of ladles, go forth
shopping, young yokels play •‘tip-oat” in the
chief squares; the community 1s swathed in a fog-
like pail of yokelarity. There is no defence
offered. The eye that discerned the Kiama
Ghost has pierced through the veil; the hand that
penned the “ Murmurs ” has given the overwhelm-
ing town this appalling knock-back. Sir Henry
Farkes has spoken, and not all the tears of Quean-
beyan will wash out that sentence. “ Yokels of
Queanbeyan” will, like “savages of Bungaree,”
be incorporated in the language, and live for ever.

Lord Denbigh still wants to knock money-
out of the Queensland Government for the ex-
pense his company went to over what was balled
the Transcontinental Railway scheme. To High-
lander M'llwraith this scheme was as inexpugn-
able as the positive injunctions in the Ten Com-
mandments. The present writer has a pathetic
interest in Lord Denbigh’s post mortem inquiries,
for from a country paper which our brain was
then wont to illumine M'llwraith admitted he had
drawn the first hint to build Queensland railways
with p.ivate capital on a basis of land-grants.
Mac invited over the Duke of Manchester, and a
long queerly-conatructed engineer called Feilding
—Feildlng fought with Chanzy in the army of
the Loire—and the whole thing looked smooth
Griffith was in Opposition then, but although he
snarled and growled like a dog with a sore foot the
play went on. Mac’s manner of referring to
Griffith was at that present essentially con-
temptuous. He would turn about to Fend-
ing or Manchester and ejaculate “ That boy I
that boy I” Whereat the amused company
laughed. It is those who win, however, who nave
the last laugh. Mr. Griffith does not hold his sides
while oaochinating. He is too dry by nature for
that. But in his own way he now laughs with
superlative zest. Lord Denbigh, as the telegram
has it, petitions the Government for compensation
for expense incurred in survey and other work,
and knowing the fate of former applications in
these terms, proposes that the Queensland Govern-
ment should give a piece of land to the company
if they won’t give cash. "That boy” instantly
mails a letter to Lord Denbigh, stating “ that the
G vernment dot 8 not see any need for further dis-
cussion of the subject, and begs him to con-
sider the correspondence as closed.” When the
letter reaches home, and General Feildlng, the
Duke of Manchester. Lord Denbigh, and thereat
of the syndicate come to the end or it, the expres-
sion they are likely to use will probably be the one

Henri Kowalski’s first concert on Monday
last may be regarded as the most noteworthy
musical event Sydney has had to place on Its
annals *or many a long day. Some people will
argue that the Salvation Army band and the
Service of Song ” at Bethesda chapel were not
easily surpassed, and that give ’em a good rousing
howl at Sankey’s hymns and they’re satisfied. But
not everyone Is educated upto that lofty standard.
For eur own part, a programme of 12 moroeaux,
of which six are either olayed or conducted by
the composer, and that composer one of our own
citizens, strikes us as something notable. We
knew Kowalski tolerably well before this
concert, but to us, in common doubtless with
most of the audience, the quality and scope
of the compositions presented on Monday were
somewhat of a revelation. The interest of the
concert, in fact, centred on Kowalski’s own work.
Mr. Hallewell is a fine artist, but he has repeatedly
been heard to infinitely greater advantage than at
this concert. Miss Francis Sayllle gave a rendering
of Koberto.tu che adoro,” which is more aptly
described as neat than as satisfactory, and in
selecting Braga’s Serenata for her second song,
she tested the endurance of an audience largely
composed of connoisseurs to whom that liquid
melody must have been utterly and wearisomely
stale. Mrs, Atkinson was too ambitious in tackling
an aria by Mozart. For a voice which is really a
small edition, and not of the highest cultivated,
although of pleasant quality, simpler themes
would bo more appropriate. In ballad music or
limpid oantabile compositions, Mrs. Atkinson
would always be an attraction. The nearer
her choice apnroaohes to bizarre style the less
effect she is likely to make upon her audiences. '
The most important and interesting feature of
the concert Weis Kowalski's concerto for p ano
forte and orchestra, an elaborate work 1 1 four
movements. Upon this we will not presume to
offer a detailed opinion after a single hearing. It
would require a musical training and organisation
of a very high order indeed to carry away an
analytical comprehension and appreciation of all
the characteristics of a composition of this kind
all at once. Broadly speaking, we can only inti-
mate that each movement struck us as tall of
thought, Ideality, and distinctiveness The orches-
tration appeared—allowing for the material
available on this ocosislon—felicitous in the
extreme. The “ Scherzo ” lingers most in our ear,
owing chiefly to the humorously grotesque use
made of the bassoon in its retorts to the piano.
Extensive and very effective use was made of this
invaluable instrument in the concert, which we
are sorry to observe Is not in the programme for
the next concert on Hriday. It is certainly the
most important work of a classical cast ever pre-
sented to a Sydney audience by a resident com-
poser. Of very high interest, ees regards executive
effect, was also the concertante duet by Thulberg
and De Berlot, played by Kowalski and Alpress
on pianoforte and violin. Mr. Alpress im-
proves every day, and is fast climbing to a
high niche among violinists. He sustained
his share in the duet admirably. We can’t
enter into further detail beyond noticing
the two valses chantants, in which chorus,
orchestra, and the great pianlste combined.
Of these, one “ Une Unit Australienne ” isKowal
ski's own, and is remarkable for one of the love-
liest conceivable introductions—a very mid-
summer’s night's dream iu tone-painting, suc-
ceeded, however, to our thinking, in tne valse
proper by a rather common place honey-pot
sickly-sentimental theme. This is the sort of
theme which pervades all the popular waltzes of
the day, however; and to the composer and exe-
cutant of the paraphrase on “Faust,” an occa-
sional unbending to deal in the lolly-pop business
may be forgiven. On Friday the programme in-
cludes Kowalski’s arrangement of “ Martha.” We
have heard the composer play this composition. It
is a concert in itself, an orchestra in one act.

About 200 accepted Dr. and Mrs. Harman
Tarrant’s invitation to tbelr dance in the new
Masonic Hall, on the 27th ult The catering, floor,
and music were all that could be desired, and the
room was tastefully decorated. Particularly Ohio
costumes were not in an absolute majority, but it is
more than probable that in view of the semi-public
School of Industry ball, the bulk of the guests
had saved their forces for that occasion. Mrs.
Tarrant wore a pale-blue silk, richly set off with
cream lace; Mrs. Andrews wore a perfectly fitting
pale-blue satin; and Mrs. Flatau, a stylish
black velvet ornate, with heliotrope plumes. An
atrocious gown was a flerce-looking crushed
strawberry, which was sufficiently short to show
a pairiof elastic-side iwhite kid boots, and a few
inches of black hose; Mrs. Purves wore a cream
satin and laoe dress, touched with cardinal plush.
It was a delightful night for dancing purposes,
and the company made the most of it till the early
morning hours.

Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,—The summer has died ex-
tremely hard this year, and even now I am not
quite so sure that we have had the final flicker, for
try as I will I can’t quite satisfy myself that it is
cool enough to wear my lovely new plush mantle
this afternoon. I am much afraid these same
plush mantles will be done to death, for they are
very :showy for the money, and becoming to
everybody, old and young. I don’t think the real
seal-skins will keep in favour much longer, for we
have oome to the conclusion at last that although
costly and rich-looking they make the figure look
decidedly clumsy; even Signora Majeroni’s fault-
less form loses half its grace under one of these
mantles. Uut the plush visiles are quite charming,
though some of the colours are a little too start-
ling -a bright yellow I saw yesterday nearly suffi-
cing to turn my affections from them altogether,
worn as it%as in the blazing sun-light. Such ex-
treme popularity as these lovely things obtain can
only result In making their reign but a brief one,
I fear.
Just after I posted my letter to you, last Wed-
nesday, Ned came home from the encampment in
hot haste, and persuaded me to lay aside my hook-
nnd accompany him to the raoes.it being Cup day.
Well, it was pretty late in the day to put in an
appearance at Randwiok, and my eyes grew so
daz»d with the brief contemolatlon of the gay and
giddy throng that I can recall but little to tell you
concerning'it We saw men looking glum over
their losses, and others unwholesomely excited

A pastor of a Sydney Church, on diamissaing his congregation, requested them to
sign a protest against the Divoree Extension Bill, which protest they would find in the
Vestibule as they passed out.
over their gains, whilst iadios (?), who had taken
more champagne than was good for them, were
talking almost as noisily as the men. It positively
made me shiver and wish myself at home again
when I first saw them, but I soon forgot all these
disagreeables In noting the really lovely gowns
which were to be seen on the lawn. I don’t much
wonder at people comparing this with the Mel-
bourne Cup day, for It was indeed a brilliant
gathering. Some outre costumes there certainly
were, but In the main they were as tasteful as
they were rich. As we drove home Ned gave me
a fragmentary account of Tuesday's doings at
Port Hacking. The Governor and Lady Carington
went up and witnessed the sham-fight, and they,
with the members of the Ministry and their wives,
took luncheon together. He tells me soma of the
ladles took their babies with them, and as these
little things have no more relish for speeches than
most of their elders, but haven’t the manners
to hide their objections, they lifted up their little
voices la the most determined manner each time
the Governor essayed to speak. Ned says he half
expected to see Mr. Harnett get up and turn them
out as be does members of the House occa-
sionally, but as the Governor is extremely good-
natured he bore the interruptions with the greatest
patience. I hear Lady Carington looked charming
on horseback, and the men are absolutely raving
about the beauty of her riding-boots Her rldlng-
hablts, you know, are made so shert that when she
mounts and alights these much admired boots are
in full view. 1 think, by all accounts, the soldiers
must have had a very gay time out camping, what
with their amateur minstrel entertainments aqd
so forth, bat they iqoked terribly used up, poor
fellows, as they trooped through the city on Wed-
nesday afternoon.
The Japanerles are still attracting large crowds
at the Exhibition building. It is one of the
pleasantest novelties we have had for a very long
time, and I really hope these quaint people will
stay a long time with us. Just to show you how
very courteous the Japanese are, I must tell you
that whenever the officers of the Japanese man-
of-war were Invited to a luncheon or dinner here
In Sydney, they almost Invariably ate roast beef
Just out of compliment to us English. That's
carrying courtesy ratuer to an extreme, don’t you
think so?
Not a great many people patronised the first
baseball match on Saturday, perhaps be that
was more due to the many counter attractions
than lack of Interest In the sport. We were quite
agreeably surprised in the game which, to my
mind at least, is a great deat more interesting
than cricket. It seems to me to be more exciting,
and keeps everybody more constantly on the
move. The players wore very picturesque cos-
tumes—the Sydney being blue caps and hose and
white jackets; whilst the Union chose maroon (at
least they call it maroon, but in reality it was
bright crimson) caps and hose, and white Jackets.
The banquet—held in West s rooms the same
evening—was, I hear, a great success, although
Mr. Dailey was unable to attend in consequence
of illness. He must indeed have been very 111
to be obliged to deny himself the pleasure of
delivering the nice speech which I feel sure he had
prepared, and your IrleUd Monsieur Deoourt was
also absent, as he had gone up to the mountains
the day before m search of health. Nevertheless,
those who were present said many nloe things to
eaeh other, and parted in the highest of spirits
about midnight. I think when we come to know
more about] baseball it will be just as popular as
cricket. ; f
If the following advertisements which I have
just out out of the Ladt, an English paper, give
fair indication of the wages earned by domestics
in England, there is little wonder that good ser-
vants refuse to emigrate to the colonies:—“Gan

Induce a woman who is used to the comforts of an
English kitchen or nursery with under-sorvants
to wait upon her to try her chance in a strange
world.
I am sorry to tell you, dear, that the use of
enamel, in society, is becoming more common
every day. Once upon a time it was only the
ancient and ugly dames who used it on their faces,
but now, yeung girls enamel not only their faces,
but also their neCks and arms. A sort of enamel
powder is used which is rubbed on to the skin and
polished until the flesh glows like polished wax.
The illusion is all very flue if a girl has a good
round form, but on the scraggy variety, all angles
and no curves, the effect is horrid.
As two young ladies were sitting eating ices at
Baumann’s, in Brisbane, one day last week, they
saw several prisoners with their legs chained to-
gether marching down Queen-street, looking
pictures of misery. Ihe ladles were full of pity
for the poor fellows, and were staring at them
with tears in their eyes, when some one exclaimed,
“ Don’t they look real?” You know, of course,
they are the advertisement of “ His Natural Life.”
But even men are taken in sometimes by this
parading advertisement, and have often been seen
to slip cakes of tobacco into the fellows’ hands.
I often wonder how people would get along with-
out advertising. I expect the world would stop
" moving on ” altogether. I once heard an
American say that the reason Job was so poor was
simply because he didn’t advertise, and a news-
paper man who was present at the time said,
“ Why, cert’nly.”
I had nearly forgotten to tell you what a plea-
sant evening we spent at Kowalski’s concert last
Monday night. Lady Carington and the Hon.
Judith Harbord were each presented with a most
exquisite bouquet as soon ns they entered the hail
Lady Carington wore black and Miss Harbord
white tambour muslin and nun’s veiling: Mrs.
Atkinson looked pretty in a beautiful gown of
crimson plusb, with crystal-beaded front over
crimson satin; Miss Seville wore white satin, with
a side panier filled with flowers—one of the latest
ideas. The audience was a very critical one, and
the concert was one of the best I have listened to
fgr a long time.
. I am so glad to see the members of the Metro-
politan Liedertafel have had the good sense to
include ladies in their invitations for their moon-
light serenade, which is to eventuate, I think,
about the 19th of this month. What possible enjoy-
ment they could expect to get, boxed up in a
steamer without any of us with them, I am at a
loss to conceive. So it is just as well that they
have thought better of their former intention to
exclude us, and now I am certain they will have
quite a nice time. Indeed, J hope they will.
It has just occurred to me: I have said never a
word about the School of Industry ball of last
night] Can’t be helped; my gossiping vein has
fled for the nonce, so now adieu.—Ev6r yours.

Victoria”: Your letter is only one among dozens
written to thank us for advocating the extension
of divorce. In most cases, though, correspond-
ents give neither name nor nom-de-plume. —
“Morality”: What matter if, as you say, in some
States of America divorces are to marriages as 1
to 8 ? If they were as 3 to [3 this would prove
nothing. It is the greatest good to the greatest
number that should bo considered. It would be a
wise thing to dissolve 19 marriages out of 3), If

decline your social items. The first reads well
enough just this far:—" She was neatly dressed in
two bootlaces that were holding up about half a
square foot of satin above the waist.” The rest of
the paragraphs are awful “ J.F.”: Ypur verses,
“ A Night with Sciatica,” can hardly be consi-
dered a success. You ungrammatically say :

When the whole of your body is glum.
You cannot stand up, sit, lay down, or kneel,
From the tip of your thighs to the point of your
heel r a
Your legs are cold, rigid, and numb.”
From this statement we diagnose that you aren’t
suffering from sciatica at all. There’s plenty of
rigidity in that complaint, but neither coldness
nor numbness. Ask the doctor whether you
haven’t paralysis. If he says yps, please write in
four cantos an ode to hemiplegia, accompanied, if
you like, by a sonnet to locomotive ataxy “ R.

Mr. John Farrell, of Queanbeyan, whose
poems published in The Bulletin have been
freely scissored into the columns of judiciously-
edited papers all over the world, has at length
determined to collect the best of his productions
and publish them, together with some that have
never yet been printed, in book form, at popular
prices. The work of revision is now proceeding,
and the selected pieces will very shortly be in the
publisher’s hands. From the popularity already
gained by Mr. Farrell’s work there is every reason
for believing that Australians will trample over
one another in their rush for the book. As tne
Yasa Tribune remarks, with that pleasing eleg-
ance of expression so characteristic of the country
Press:—“The volume will be a poetic oasis in a
desert of execrable verse created by the efforts of
the Sladen-cum-Allen school, and which caccathes
scribendi— peculiar to these bar 's—is fast making
limitless. Mr Farrell’s new book should be a pro-
nounced success, as several competent authorities
consider its author a formidable rival of ‘ Austral s
noetic trio.’” We are not at all sure that Mr.
Farrell will not eome out a little bit ahead of some
of the trio. Nom verrons.

A defeated candidate for the (West Mel-
bourne electorate has presented a petition to the
Speaker against the return of the other candidate
on the ground that he “ treated the voters.” It is
pleasing to know that the petitioner—Langton by
name—was defeated. Four lines to him:—
What I rob a voter of his beerl
Much meanness this denotes;
For if no beer flows -look you here—
What use is there in votes ?
A Collingwood Salvation A rmy “ Capting,”

But this captain only brays.
And hallelujah! he gets Hayes.
Specimen of yokel literature. Says the
Queanbeyan Times, of Sir ’Bnery: “ Itwould little
matter to us what opinion this exploded old
political sky-rocket entertains of our intellectu-
ality, only that in bis fall he lets a little light upon
the feeling of the Sydney people towards the
country population.” W© would ask thelQ.T, man
if he ever noticed an exploded sky-rocket snedding
ligbt in its fall ? But we are glad to to see some
one come forward to vindicate the intellectuality
of the crushed place.
The Yic f orian Easter manoeuvres lacked
not in brilliant and exciting adventures. Daring
deeds and general indifference to death and danger
were the order of the day and night. Men in
whose business veins the blood runs sluggishly
enough in a general way, became hot and eager
for martial distinction. Mr. Lorimer, the dauntless
Minister of Defence (successor to Colonel Soft-
goods Sargood) sought the bubble reputation, even
at the muzzle of a sentry’s musket. After night
had flung her inky shroud upon the dewy earth
and the brave defenders of Queenseliff fort, obli-
vious of their perilous position, were thinking
sadly of the mothers and sweethearts they might
ne’er behold again, Mr. Lorimer, assisted by Major-
General Downes, climbed unobserved over the
parapet wall of the fort. So deeply lost in reverie
were the sentries that the intrepid Lorimer had
some trouble in finding one, but when he did he
despatched the cowering wretch to the officer in
charge, and demonstrated how the fort could be
captured by adventurers like himself this,
Mr. Lorimer and the Major-General crawled
through some lines and surprised a camp in a
manner strongly suggestive of Frederick the
Great, spying round for himself. True, the
Minister of Defence was eventually taken pri-
soner, but not before he had clearly proved that
one half of the Victorian army could be speedily
destroyed by a hostile force composed entirely of
wily Lorlmers. For not all of that gallant host
slumbered, slept, or played euchre during the
night watches. Point Franklin fort was happy in
the possession of a sentry whose eagle eye not a
mosquito could escape. Mr. Lorimer would have
stood no chance of getting into that fort under
the friendly cover of night. This sentry erred on
the side of over-alertness. Once during the small
hours he called the garrison to arms by firing his
rifle. The men rushed out in answer to the signal,
and the sentry pointed to a dark spot in the dis-
tance. In an Instant 30 of the boldest spirits were
in hot pursuit. Madly they rushed through the
scrub, rifles in hand, until the enemy, fairly ex-
hausted by the chase, lay down and calmly
awaited death. The enemy was a cow, and when
the adventurous 30 returned panting to camp they
solemnly eursod their lynx-eyed sentinel. As a
trophy of war a Queenseliff cow is but a poor
tnlng compared with the Soudan goat.
Woman Items
Constable to cautious witness at Sydney
Central Court: “Do you know what this woman
does when she’s out 7 ” Witness: “Do you know
what your wife does when she’s out—or for that
matter when she’s in either ? ” The retort ambigu-
ous always rankles.
A widow in Japan who is willing to think
of matrimony wears her hair tied and twisted
round a long shell hair-pin placed horizontally
across the back of the head. If the same custom
obtained in Australia, journalism should know us
no more. We would start a shop for the sale
long shell hair-pins.
Japanese etiquette requires that the lady
shall give the signal for the termination of a visit
from a gentleman. Japanese customs are singularly
like our own. In this country the lady gives the
signal for the termination of a visit, and the
is; “ George, I think I hear papa out iu the back-
yard untying the dog.”
At Melbourne, Joseph Todd was sued for
maintenance by his wife. The bench said he’d
have to pay or “ go in.” “ How long will you give
me, your worship ?” asked Joseph. “ You’ll re-
main in gaol till you part the coin, Mr. Todd,”
answered the bench. Then Joseph assumed a
thoughtful attitude and murmured, “ Perhaps if I
go to gaol they’ll cure my gout.” And he went.
Gaol-fare isn’t gouty.
“ During the stay of the Princess of Wales
and her daughters at Torquay the three Princesses
turned up one day at a boot shop with a pieee of
wood, and requested to be supplied with a pair of
goloshes the length of the stick. On being fur-
nished with the articles they paid for and had
them wrapped up, and carried them home through
the streets. Even to suggest such a proceed-
ing to some Australian girls would cause them to
faint. But now that royalty does it we may ex-
pect an outbreak of brown paper parcels. In fact
it will come ta be looked on as had form to be
without one.” This is from the Australasian.
It is well that the forests in the Cape Otway
ranges contain the longest trees in the world, else
the Victorian girl wouldn’t be able to get a stick
big enough to measure her feet with.
Every landlady her own bailiff. We sug-
gest this as a title for a book to the N.Z. lady—wife
of a settler at Kunlpuni (wherever In thunder that
may be)-whose husband having failed repeatedly
in his efforts to eject a tenant who would not
“ part ” the rent of a cottage he occupied, which
cottage belonged to—but this sentence is getting
too mixed. The fact is that she took the law into
her own hands one day, when her husband was
absent, and marched over to the cottage. The
male tenant was out. His wife, however, was in.
Unto her the landlady—“ Have you got that rent 7”
“No—1-.” “Then out you go. Pack up. I’ll
give you a hand.” In the course of 40 minutes the
whole Pantheon of household gods belonging to
that tenant were piled under the canopy of
heaven, the front door was locked, and the back
door, having no lock on it. was nailed up. If all
landladies were as smart as this one, it would be—
well, it would be a poor time for current literature.
She had the style of a good cash-customer
about her, and as she sailed into the Pitt-street
shop the carpet-trotter washed his hands in invisi-
ble water, and, bowing and backing, left her to
the tender mercy of the gabbiest shopman he had.
This party was a hurricane at talking, bat in his
anxiety to pull down half the shop and expatiate
on the good qualities of his wares he got a trifle
mixed. The lady wanted a parasol, and was rum-
maging through a 4ft. heap when Mr. Tapejostler
suddenly picked one up, opened it, and exclaimed:
“Now, madamel there’s a beauty. Ours is the
only place in the colony where such an article as
that can be had for either love or money. Isn’t It
charming ? Look at that silk. Particularly hob-
serve the quality, the finish, and the general toot
dissemblaye of the whole. Peel of It. Pass your
hand over It. Ain’t it a pufflot artistic creation ? ”
“Yes,” she replied, as she olutoaed the creation;
“ that’s my old ’un. I gave 7s. fid. for it in Mudgee,
and just laid it on the counter.”
Whazzher matter wi’ thish ? An ad. in the
Brisbane Courier reads: “Gentleman engaged a
bedroom at an hotei yesterday, and left his lug-
gage there. Has forgotten the address of the
hotel, and would like to ascertain the whereabouts
of the same. E. 8—. office of this paper,” Public-
house must have drunk its own grog, and then
cleared into the bush to hide from the snakes that
came out of the luggage.
From the Melbourne Agb, which is gene-
rally supposed to be strongly in favour of Tem-
perance:—“ The following persons, acoidentally
injured, were treated yesterday at the Melbourne
Hospital. Jeremiah Donovan, suffering from
delirium tremens. John Larkins, with contusions
resulting from being assaulted by a woman with a
bottle.” If this be accidents then our shares in
the Accident Insurance Society are for immediate
sale.
Here is a grisly item. We take it from
the telegraphic columns of the Melbourne Argus:
—“ A man named James Key was lost from Win-
ton (Q.) last Saturday, and yesterday his dead
body was found after having been tracked 70
miles.” The dead body that could travel 70 miles
must be a caution among corpses. But why could
it not have travelled the other way and given
Itself In charge of the Coroner ? Why did it not
also write a diary, or engage itself to produce a
series of sketches entitled (say) “Picturesque
Queensland ” for the Argus ?
The following Municipal by-law gem
polished up by the Waverley (Sydney) Council has
been confirmed by his Excellency Baron Caring-
ton, with the usual sapient advice of the Execu-
tive Council:—“Any person or persons loitering
in or obstructing any street, lane, or pathway in
the borough of Waverley, by standing or congre-
gating thereon, and refusing to move or disperse
when requested so to do by any member of the
police force or an authorised officer of the council,
shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £2." How
a person can “disperse ” can only be explained by
the astute mimbir av th’ fooroe who swore he
“surrounded th’ prlshoner with much sarcum-
specahin.”
He kissed her I
Not with the loud, explosive smack
He kissed her;
But with a tender laying-on of lips.
As gently as the stars lie on the blue
He touched the sweet, uncertain mouth,
In doubt to meet his kiss half way.
In doubt if it would come unsought,
Delicious doubt, dear hesitant 1
It came as come those organ-notes
In music, welling from the heart,
Deep, tremulous, and yearning* full
Of ecstasy prolonged, prolonged, prolonged.
He kissed her.
Yes, he did,
And put It there to aoak,

THE BARON AND THE BLACK.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ When his Excellency Lord Carington
was introduced to the stalwart aboriginal, he
grasped Charley by the hand and said, ‘ How are
you ? * The aboriginal replied, ‘I very glad to see
you, Mr. Gubernor, in my country and Mudgee.’
The baron and the black gripped each other by
the hand. 'Which felt the happier—the black or
the baron ? ”—Westebn Post (Mudgee, N.S.W.)
“ Which was the happier then ? ” you ask us—
The Baron or the Black ? ” Well, let us think I
This task you’ve set us, not an easy task is,
And needs considering (the violet ink I
Thanks I Here we’d best explain. Harsh colours
jar on
High natures, and, of course, we do not lack
Eor loyalty. With this we’ll treat the Baron,
And afterwards, with common black, the
Black),
Which was the happier (this in violet) ?
The Baron or the Black (this is in both) ?
This is not, as we’ve said, a task to smile at,
It has about it quite a forest growth
Of pros and cons. The Baron may have truly
Known much of happiness, e’en long before
He left his land for this obsequious Thule,
And set his foot upon its curtseying shore.
Elch, kindly, healthful, not much over 80,
And sent to govern New South Wales—is much
Towards happiness. The chosen friend of Bertie 1
This gave felicity its final touch,
Or would have given it, if he had rested
In his own land, and been contented with
A goodly lot, but as ho since has breasted
The raging sea, and gazed on Bardett Smith—
As, since the days when Beauty, In a flatter
Beheld him caracole down Rotten Row,
He probably has heard John Cash Neild utter
the sheeted ghosts of jokes of long ago,
br read the “ Oratory” of Buchanan,
Or stood with dauntless front, while ceaselessly,
With unrelenting heart and glib tongue ran on
The frind of Daniel Hinry Dinihey.
Or seen the letters of Fonetic Francis,
Or marked, a serried rank of helm and spear,
tn the broad light of day the Sydney Linceahs
tlrge their fleet chargers in a wild career,
Or run his eye o’er waggon-loads of grovel
Produced to order by the hands of men,
Who better far could use a pick and shovel
Than fashion an Address, or wield a pen—
As he has certainly been asked, quite often,
His views about our Harbour, and, no doubt,
His sense of exile to appease and soften,
Had the Post Office Carvings pointed out,
As be has been to Bathurst and to Mudgee
And seen the aldermen those parts produce,
As far as we, by our own hearts, can judge, he
Must have been in Heav'n. (Now we will use
The black ink, solely, for awhile) The nigger
(Or Black) has had his joys, though not thesame:
When long ago, a youthful, dusky figure
Through the wild woods he chased the bounding
game,
(Game always bounds, you know,) his life was joy-
ous.
He, fettered by no civilising rules,
Had not the sorrows that the Christian boy has;
No grammar lessons and no Sunday schools
Have his soul misery—no application
Of cane bade aches explore his boyish bones;
In those fair days his usual occupation
Was bathing publicly, and throwing stones;
No father, if he stayed out late, would pull a
Grim face, and to the wood-shed hail him in—
An odd remonstrance with a nulla-nulla
Made his skull stable, and but made him grin.
In the warm sunshine, ’mid the wattles’ blossom
With other piccaninnies would he fight,
Or, from the hollow gum-tree drag the ’possum
Half dead, and dazzled by the sudden light,
Or, with his tomahawk of stone, the waddy
Shape from the hardest, most reluctant wood,
And, watched by doting parents, from the body
Of some more youthful Black, with it draw
blood.
And later, as his klrghood drew on nearer,
The Heir Apparent showed fit warlike skill.
No other Black with a fourteen-foot spear, or
A boomerang, could at such distance kill
His foes. At night, ’mid fires and many a gunyah
Who could moan forth such doleful notes as he?
In Government House (violet) no such fun you
Have as a (black again) Corrobboree.
Yet still a fuller meed of bliss awaited
This sable lord—he took himself a bride,
With whom no household matters were debated
Save with a sapling on her sounding hide,
Who humped the swag along, and boiled the billy*
While he strode on in front, a warrior-king—
Less glorious life in (violet) Piccadilly
Where males are Helots of the marriaga-ring 1
Then full felicity (In black ink this lot)
Found him at last. The Christian Pioneer
Determined in Australia to cast his lot
And in his wake, of course, came rum, and beer
And clergymen. The shy untutored savage

STRAIGHT TIPS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
, Now is the season when “Augur,’
* Vafces,” “ Censor,” “ Nemo,” “ Yorkshireman,’
et tout genus omne (N.B.—Subtle Franco-Litln-
English quotation), will give you winners who do
not win, and eauss you to back horses ridden by
the celebrated Johnny Armstrong. I shall tell you
of some real tips I have had and backed, and I be-
lieve such eccentric and extraneous information
is as reliable as that of any sporting prophet.
• * *
My first extraordinary “ office” was when
I was being shown over the Essex County Lunatic
Asylum by Dr. Campbell. On approaching his
own part of the establishment, he said: “I shall
now show you a man who’ll Interest you. He is,
like you, fond of betting, and now he is allowed to
bet to his heart’s content.” The patient was a
gentleman of income who had gone mad on racing,
and whose friends had put him under restraint. He
was quite happy, had a comfortable office, all the
sporting papers, and no end of betting-book?, and
received and paid cheques for fabulous sums. He
tipped me General Peel for the Two Thousand
Guineas, and he won.
* *
Another time I was introduced to a brother
of the highest legal functionary in Sc itland. He
was suffering from the morbus cocruleus, or blue
disease, and his heart had been in such a delicate
state for 10 or 13 years that he had never walked
beyond the garden gate. He had never seen a
race, perhaps not even a racehorse, but he read
the papers and made hi? own handicaps. He gave
me Casse-TSte for the Grand National? and Cra-
morne for the Derby-both winners.
•• * -
Next: At Croydon. The races had all
been run, barring one, and the grand stand was
positively empty except lor one lady In a corner.
I could not resist going up to see who this devotee
could be and with the cheek engendered by youth
and soldiering I addressed her. She told me that
Johnny Goodwin was her “ chap ” and that she bad
come to see him win on Perfume. That decided
me. Johnny won, Perfume won, I won, and the
lady went away with the promise of a silk dreis
which I sent her next day. I backed Henry for
the Ascot Cup, because one of my names is Henry,
and none of the papers tipped him. He won.
♦ * *
Lastly: At the Alexandra Park races, 1
had lost money, and was sick from drinking an
abomination called “Eobur” or the “tea-spirit.”
I was sitting on the bottom step of the grand-stand
when a girl with golden hair took up uer position
in front of me. 1 tapped her (very rude, I daresay)
on the back, and told her, “You should back
Auricomus, because it means golden hair.” The
smile she gave me makes me jump even
now, and when she pulled out a purse the
size of a watch and offered me a sovereign to take
into the ring, I sprang up, for there was little time
to lose, and promising her to be back soon I was
just in time to get 8 to lin tenners. When I
returned alter the race and gave her £8 she would
hardly take it, as I had not taken her sov., but she
being fickle, and line, and French took a lift back
to town in my cab, leaving her former escort. She
and I were for a long time (three weeks) on nodding
terms until I found that she could drink absinthe
like beer.
• e e
The above were my non-professional tips,
and if the Sydney Lancers have not won to a man
on the Hawkesbury they are nearly as big duffers
as I imagine them to be, bar the Baron, who used to
be of my mind in the matter of Hock still Hook.

Extract from the notice-book of the

A Scotch meenister was seriously castigat-
ing a stray ram of his flock for some misdemeanor
not unconnected with the census returns. He re-
minded him for his edification and example, of the
case of the virtuous Joseph who fled and left his

probably right.
Marrickville merely wants from the Trea-
sury a new post, telegraph, and money-order
office; a courthouse, a watohhouse (very badly),
and new town hall; a tramway station; and at a
public meeting, held in that horse leech’s
daughter’s suburb, the residents were implored
not to confine their views to the present needs of
the borough, but to agitate with a duo regard to
the requirements of the future, so that posterity
would go down on its knees 77 times a day, and
bless them all back as far as the 133 ad generation.

It is remarked that though heavy supplies
of Tumut-grown tobacco are sent to Sydney, ‘ no
one can tell where it goes. No tobacconist admits
selling the fine-out Tumut.” But you can buy any
quantity of flne-out stringy-bark, willow-leaf, tar,
llquoriee-chips, hemp, and treacle, though. Ann
if you go in for plug, any number of Sydney
tobacconists can supply you with plugs containing
a cord of wood each. Indeed it is quite common
now for a man to ask the tobacconist for the loan
of his crosscut-saw and maul and wedges every
time he buys a plug. It may be a loss in tobacco,
but it’s a great saving in fuel.
The Pall Mall recently caused a house
to house enquiry to be made in a certain London
street in order to ascertain the true condition of
the poorer classes in that city. The first 16 houses
visited had 153 inhabitants, whoso collective e<s.n -
Ings for the previous three months amounted to
£465 KB. After deducting rent from this sum
there remained just 6J. a day for each man,
woman, and child to live upon. Yet the t enants of
these houses were labourers, machinists, bakers
seamen, ironworkers, and so on. Nor was this
street the worst that could be found -in fact, it is
said to have been above the average of the side-
streets of the parish.
“ Turabarumba is a native word that
beautifully express* s its own meaning, the sound
being married to the sense. It means in English
* Sounding Ground,’ and is dcr.ved from a hill near
the town, the remains of an extinct volcano,
which is probably hollow and certainly sonorous
under foot. If you were to roll a large stone (•‘own
this hill, and wished to convee an idea of ihe
sound made to anyone, *Tumb.rumba’ would
serve your purpose better than any other word ’’

Rider Cook, M.P., of the English Com-
mons, was “got at” very neatty lately. He had
Introduced a Bill which members were extremely
anxious to shelve. Suddenly, however, he found
during- his speech that a keen curiosity was
aroused, and, as he spoke, he was pressed to read
his voluminous quotations, and even to repeat
huge columns of figures. Eager to oblige, he elo-
quently spouted until the fatal hour struck when
business on Wednesdays must cease, and then it
dawned upon him that he had talked his own Bill
out of existence. Would that some N B.W. repre-
sentatives wrpuld go one better, and talk themselves
out, and vanish in vapour through the roof. We
don t refer to you, Daniel, or to Frawreis the
Fonatio either.
xt Y olunteer Corporal Bludge, of Dubbo,
N.S.W., has expressed the opinion that war be-
tween Russia and Austria Is not, as General Tg-
oatleff says. Inevitable. The corporal has arrived
at this conclusion, after a prolonged study of tne
probable influences at work in the minds of the
three Emperors at their meeting last year. He Is
of opinion that there was some reserve manifested
on the part of all three monarchs, and, judging
from his own experience in ihe Duobo district, no
three men can be got together to act unreservedly,
or trust one another. He thinks that a permanent
peace can best ba conserved by playing off one
against another. All in the bar welcomed him
baok from the encampment, and as the weary
veteran blew off the froth, he nodded assent to
the cabling his views home to the Duke of Cam-
bridge. Tne corporal nodded, but did not commit
himself to any statement.
The crumbs which fall from Dives’ table
In London are now being systematically collected
by the Baroness Burdetc-Cautts and Lady Woles-
ley, who employ carts to gather up the frag-
ments, which are then cooked and turned out as
soups, stews, or puddings to be sold to the poor at
a penny a dish. This commendable system of
charity is being rapidly extended throughout
London. The amount of distress IntheEsglish
metropolis is assuming fearful dimensions. The
other side of th© story is supplied by the state-
ment that the London ground rents of the Duke
of Westminster are worth £150,000 a year at least,
with a reversion to an Income of, not lees than
£1,500,000 a year; the Duke of Bedford's amount
to £lOO 000, with a reversion of £750,000 ; and the
Portland family diaw £BO,OOO now, with a rever-
sion to £700,000. The starving poor may console
themselves with these figures. England's old
nobility suffer no diminution of wealth.
“Editor Bulletin.—Sir,—That doctor of
yours who asked his patient how to spell hia name
(having forgotten it) could have learned some-
thing from old T n, of glorious
memory. His bones are whitening at Hell's Gates,
between the Normanby and the Palmer. These
are his exact words to me, Scotty the Wrinkler: -
“Isay, Paul (he called me Phul Instead of Phil,
in delerence to my nationality), isn't it the devil
when you meet a man who knows you, and all
about you, and yet you can’t call him to mind?
Of course, you know, you've been on the spring
when you met him, but in what pub. or company
the Lord only knows, and he won’t tell under
drinks all round. I have a nearly certain dodge
for discovering his identity, I call him ‘ old fel-
low,’ and ask ‘ Where have you been ever sinse ? ’
To gigantic Intellects like ours the answer will ,
furnish the clue—and, by the way, Phql, the latest '
telegram from Melbourne is ‘Long time between (
drinks.’ ”
The great Romeike, of London, who sup-
plies newspaper-extracts from all parts of the
globs to order, has been commissioned by a client
to discover the causes of failure in life. With a
view to this end, Romeike has sent out circulars
to all curates of more than 40 years of age, to all
unknown barristers and journalists, and to a host
of members of Parliament and nubile men.” The
enquiry-form to be filled in is as followsTo
what causes do you attribute your failure in life ?
I, (name) of (profession) .attribute my
failure in life to the following causes:—!, drink
(say what drink); 3, gambling (turf, cards, or
what?); 3, dishonesty; 4, unfortunate acquaint-
ances; 5, marriage; 6, single life; 7, disinclination
to work; 8, lending or borrowing (say which); 9,
unpopular views (political and religious) ; 10,
tobacoo (in what form); 11, general Incapacity;
13, other causes, general remarks.” We would
like to know from Mr. Romeike how many of
those whom he brands as failures give "dishonesty”
as the cause, and how many more allege “ disin-
clination to work ” and general “ incapacity” as the
reason of their non-success. Farther, we would
like to know how many men are seeking for
Romeike to thank him with a shot-gun or crowbar
for the keen interest he takes in their history, and
the estimate he forms of their position in life.
Romeike should, it he be permitted to live, circular-
ise the Australian nobility In London—beginning
with Salmon Wilson and Heaton—and ask them to
what causes they attribute their “ success.”
A romance of rum. A navvy lately up
North got howllngly drunk, and " kept it up ” for
nearly a month, finishing, as might be expected, by
having a visit from the pink-eyed snake. He
dived into the bush, and kept on diving until,
early one morning, he struck the tent of a swag-
man pitched on the bank of a creek. After sur-
veying the surroundings, and taking a peep at the
sleeper in the tent, he possessed himself of a
butcher’s knife which was sticking in a gum-tree
close by, and determined to amuse himself by re-
ducing the surplus population. He crawled
stealthily up to the tent, cut the rope which held
the flies, and then crept in and up beside the
sleeper. For one moment the knife was held
aloft, the next it was sticking in the swagman’s
aide. With a shriek the wounded man arose, and,
drawing the knife from his body, closed with the
madman. A fight lor life then began. All round
the floor they fought, the swagman stabbing at
the madman whenever he got an opportunity, the
madman, in his turn, pulling the hair and beard
off his antagonist, and scratching, tearing, and
biting his flesh like a dog. In the fight the tent
was torn down, and presently the two, locked to-
gether, started to roll towards the bank of the
creek In a few minutes more they were rolling
down it. In the roll they became parted, and both
now stood at the bottom bleeding, maimed, and
glaring. For fully five minutes thus they stood,
and the swagman. letting the knife fail, uttered
one word, "Dickl” " Harry 1” came huskily from
the stranger, as the fire of madness laded from his
eyes, and big tears rolled down his furrowed
cheeks. And then those two wrecks of tneir former
selves feebly stepped forward to shake hands.
They were brothers I
The news cabled to the Australian dailies
that Greece his been forced by the Powers to dis-
arm, has a large significance. The stubbornness
of the attitude of the present Greek Government,
and the issur s depending on war, or no war, may
justify us in recallinga few particulars. The Greek
army and navy are being largely increased, and a
loan of 33 millions is called for, which can only be
for warlike purposes against their old enemy the
Turk. If there is war. It will be the third attempt
within the past GO years to recover their ancient
provinces. Canning was the only English states-
man who has shown any real desire to assist the
Greeks in restoring freedom to their country.
All statesmen since have aimed to strengthen
Tm key—not that they love the Turk, but because
he is handy as a buffer to block the Russian in
the South. For that purposa the Turk has never
been allowed to be crushed, however much his
rule has been detested. In 1833 the British as dated
with Russia and France to give Greece a king.
They gave them Otho—a Bavarian nonentity who
livi din grandeur—ln Munich. But they com-
pelled Greece to go on paying a lerge annual sum to
the Sultan. Otho was got rid of m 1863, after 80
years of tyranny and civil war. Prince George of
Denmark, brother of the Princess of Wales, was
sent next. Tie British discouraged all attempts
at independence, and during the Crimean war,
when the Greeks were about to strike a blow the
English fleet blocked them. Again, In the Russo-
Turkiah war, the Greeks were compelled to stay
their hand under a vague promise that their rights
should be oorst’ered after the war was over. No-
thing has ever been done for them, however. Qf
late years another powerful reason why the com-
bined Powers try to keep back Q eece Is thet the
Turk is overhead and ears in debt everywhere,
and the bondholders want their interest, which
they could never get if Turkey were crushed.
Nothing could so clearly bring out 'he enormous
power of the money-bag in shaping modern
diplomacy as the steady and persistent way In
wnleh statesmen, while theoretically praising
liberty and pretending a sort of worship for old
Heilas and her glorious Marathon still muzzle the
Ureek people eyery time they make a move to get
their fangs into their brutal old foe. It is believed
that trreece will not be held back much longer ex-
cept by actual force.
According to the Pall Mall, as quoted
b ?*.t he iW n 2 y *£ oao * Sir John Lubbock came out
with a list of 100 authors whom he thought the
best a man could read. Letters were sent to
many eminent living writers asking them to draw
up a similar list, and John Ruskin Instead of giv-
ing a list, scored out sundry names from Sir John’s
.V’o5 1V A in,f bis reasons for doing so. For Instance
ot. Augustine's Confessions”—because people
would do better to study other saints than them-
selves. He recommends St. Patrick wid yer lave.
John Stuart Mill—because “bis day is over.”
Kingsley—because his sentiment is false, and hla
tragedy frightful. Darwin—beeau?e he has a
mortal fascination for all vainly curious and Idly
speculative persons, and has collected, in the train
of him, every Impudent imbecility la Europe, like
a dim comet wagging Its useless tall of phosphor-
escent nothing across tbe steadfast stars. And so
on, drawing his pen through works which com-
pared with John's writings as regards their effect
on modern thought are as the turning of the
tide to the sweeping-back of vain drippings
under the door. His last remark shows how
thoroughly he has failed to grip the great
movements of modern science. He can’t
get Intelligible books on natural history ; “ I
chanced at breakfast the other day to wish I
*new something of the biography of a shrimp, the
rather that T was under the impression of having
seen jumping shrimps on a sandy shore express
great satisfaction in their life. My shelves are
loaded with books on natural history, but I could
had nothing about shrimps except that ‘they
swim in tue water or lie upon the sand In shoals,
and are taken in multitudes for the table.’” Just
so. Rut if John had read another “ dim comet
wagging his phosphorescent tail of nothing across
the steadfast stars” (which are not steadfast, but
moving a hundred times faster than we are), ho
would have found that Huxley selected the
shrimp s big uncle, the Crayfish, as the subject of a
whole standard treatise on the development of
animal life, and If John wanted to know why tho
shrimp wagged'his tail, Huxley would he the man
to tell him, unless, indeed, which is likely enough;
he wants somebody to ascertain for him the dpfrhS
tual cravings after art of that delectable little
supoer-bird. Take half a pint with a cruet, John,
ai d you will know all you aye lively to know
about the soul of the shrimp.
WILLIAM BEACH,
The champion oarsmen of the world, who has re-
cently left our shores to visit England and America
to maintain and emphasize his claims against all
comers, was born at Aider ton, in Surrey, England,
in 1851, and when two years of age emigrated to
Dapto, Lake Illawarra, N.S.W. He was brought
up to his father’s trade, and while toiling like a
young Vulcan in the smithy, unconsciously deve-
loped that magnificent physique which has since
brought him world-wide distinction. When about
23 years of age. Beach commenced rowing on the
Illawarra leaked against local competitors; from
the outest he kept winning, until gradually handi-
capped out of all races.
Briefly stated, his professional career is as
follows:—Made his advent in 1880 in a handicap
skiff race, at Woolloomooioo, and won, defeating
P. Ward and J. M'Clerkln; rowed second to H-
Pearce at Pyrmont Regatta three weeks later j de«
feated by Neil M'Donald at Anniversary Regatta
in 1883, but afterwards turned the tables on McDon-
ald; Gascoigne beat him; defeated Charles Rey-
nolds, the light skiff rower* of Australia, in a splen-
did race on the Parramatta, Reynolds dropping out
of his boat exhausted; Solomon and other scullers
acknowledged his prowess; on the 7th March, 1883.
first public appearance of the champion in an om-i
rigger in race for Punch Trophy, and finished
second to Rush, both Trickett and Laycoek being
in the rear; defeated T. Clifford in light skiff races
beat Trickett five times out of six matches; in 1883
was defeated by Trickett for Hunt Trophy, to
decide who should meet Hanlan in place of Lay-
cock (who waa disabled) ; Lav cock, however,
covered, and was beaten by Hanlan on 31th May,
1881; Beach defeated Hanlan on Ifith August, 1884,
greatly to the astonishment of all; defeated Hanlan
again on the 38r,h March, 1885, rowing him down in
the earlier part of the race; just previously he had!
defeated Clifford; defeated Nell Matterson on 10th
December, 1885, with greatest of ease. A man in-
dulging in such struggles must, of necessity, feel
the want of an aid to nature in keeping his physical
condition up to the highest attainable point, and
it is not surprising to us that Mr. Beach candidly
states that during bis training, prevoua to meetng
Edward Hanlan the second time tor the world s
championship, his trainer procured for him War-
ners safe cure, and Beach also took a supply with
him on board the Cuzco, that he might have it
constantly by him. His system of training involves
a run of two or three mi es before breakfast, a
walk of six or seven miles afterwards, and a pull
over the course. After dinner comes another two-
mile walk and a second pull over the course, dur-
ing which he rows himself right out, eases off, aud
then pulls again. A long walk concludes the day,
and he goes to bed at 9 o’clock. Beach carefully
avoids spirits, and does not smo&e while training.
If he feels a bit oat of scirts, a resort to Warner’s
safe cure soon puts him all right again. He rows
with sculls having blades of great width, those
used by him in the matches with Hanlan being
inches wide, 9 feet 6 incaes long, and 3 feetB inches
inboard, and he tows his stroke clean out to the
end.
The champion carries with him the heartiest
wishes tor his success from a federated Australia,
and the sincere belief that he will be equal to the
task of accomplishing all that his most ardent ad-
mirers hope for.
