IRISHMEN DEFIED INVADING DANES FROM ROUND TOWERS SUCH AS THESE
FLIGHT miles from Dublin, near
Malahide, is Swords, originally a
place of great importance. It was
here that St. Columba founded a
church and monastery in 550 for St.
Finian the Leper. The foundation
became so rich that it was known as
the “Golden Prebend,” and in 1366
it was held by William of Wykeham,
The ancient buildings of Swords
include the fourteenth-century tower
of the Abbey Church and the ruins
of the twelfth-century Archbishop’s
Castle. This fortress has had a stormy
past, as it was captured on several
occasions by the raiding Danes, who
sacked the Monastery and destroyed
its precious store of books. The power
of the Danes was finally broken in
1014 at' the Battle of Clontarf, when
they were defeated by the Irish under
Brian Boru, who was mortally
wounded. His body and that of his
son rested for one night in the castle
at Swords on their journey to
Armagh for burial.
Here also is one of the famous
Round Towers, 74ft. high, of the
earliest type with a restored cap and
a modern entrance at ground-level.
These Round Towers were built at
many points in Ireland when the
Danes began their raiding, as they
served as a watchtower, as a belfry
and, if necessary, as a refuge.
Entrance was gained through a door-
way high above ground-level, which
could be reached only by ladder, and,
when attacked, this could be drawn
inside, and the marauders could
make no impression on the strong
masonry that has stood for over a
thousand years.

AUSTRALIAN ROUNDABOUT
On the whole the reader will fare pretty
well with George Farwell in The
Outside Track (Melbourne University
Press), a set of travel articles ranging
from Hobart to the Gulf country, with
excursions to Alice Springs, the Murray
valley and the Eyre Peninsula.
One or two of the articles, particularly
those on the Murray, are rather statistical.
Sometimes it is a mistake for an author
to know too much about his subject, as
it would be for an artist to know the
number of rivets in the Harbor Bridge;
and Mr. Farwell is impressive and
earnest, rather than vivid, when he
relates such facts as that, “The com-
mission was to be the controlling
authority, allotting a definite amount of
water for diversion: to New South Wales
1,957,000 acre-feet (one acre-foot is the
volume of water covering an acre to the
depth of one foot), 2,219,000 acre-feet
to Victoria,” etc.
Other articles, again, notably the one
on Tasmania, are hardly more than
guide-book stuff —“Soon the bitumen
highway runs freely between emerald
paddocks where fine Merinos and fat
Devon cattle graze ...” This is not the
living Tasmanian earth as you find it in
such a book as R. H. Wigram’s The
Uncertain Trout.
Still, there may be people who really
want to know the cubic content —if that
is the correct term—of the Hume Dam ;
there will certainly be an audience for a
tourist’s trip to Tasmania ; Mr. Farwell
does mix some good Murray scenery and
Murray life with his statistics; and he
gets some feeling into his account of old
convict days in Tasmania, particularly
when he is following Marcus Clarke
around the Devil’s Blowhole, which he
says is quite a dramatic a bit of coastline
in actuality as in For the Term of His
Natural Life.
The best of the essays is the first, “Gold
in the Hills,” which goes deep into the
New England bush, where the author
once worked in a goldmine:
Truly it was magnificent country. Five
years earlier some timbermen had roughly
blazed a track for twenty miles beyond the
township. It was just as well they had
marked an occasional tree, for the bush
immediately pressed in again, and in places
it was hard to distinguish the track from
brush, bracken and tall rank grass. Nature
swiftly claims her own out here, obliterating
the traces of man’s passing. Mile after
silent mile we rode between those grand
. and soaring trees. They rose up with the
smoothness and solidity of Roman columns,
perhaps twenty or more feet in girth. The
gullies into which we descended were so
densely overgrown that it was virtually
impossible to ride off the track. On each
side scrub rose thick as a wall, a fantastic
tangle of lawyer-vine, stinging trees, stag-
horns, treefern and huge parasitic growths
that reduced the sunlight to a shadowy green
comparable to the ocean’s bed. One night,
overtaken by dark, I had allowed my horse
to wander off the track. He penetrated that
scrub no more than ten yards. But, so
entangling were those dense festoons of
lawyer-vine, each as thick as a man’s fore-
arm, that it took me thirty minutes to
lead him out again.
This is not quite first-class writing.
There are cliches such as “We dig this
gold up out of the ground. Then we give
it to the banks, and they bury it in
another hole again,” and references to
“the university of the bush” (though not,
fortunately, hard knocks). Many of the
phrases, if not hackneyed enough to be
called cliches, are a little blunted with
familiarity, and Mr. Farwell uses them
awkwardly—“A shadowy green compar-
able to the ocean’s bed,” and “These
great boulders had the appearance of
having been flung down by some giant
hand.” But “Gold in the Hills” is, all
the same, very close to an essay of the
highest quality.
It is full of deep feeling; the earth
comes to life in it; and, like the best of
Hazlitt’s essays, it has a story running
through it, therefore a theme, therefore
movement, therefore drama: its great
moment is when a wandering fossicker,
old and near his death, comes out of the
thick bush into the miners’ camp, stays
a night, and goes on his way again, “his
slight limping figure, bent over the long
stick, burdened by his swag, moving
slowly under the shadow of the great
trees,”
The other articles, journalistic assign-
ments rather than personal reminiscences,
cannot be expected to have this depth
of feeling, but nearly all are good of
their kind: a survey of “the town under
the waters,” Tallangatta, which is doomed
to drown m the Hufne Reservoir ; a yarn
with Bill Harney of the North on “his
long, white uninhabited beach, a mere
twenty, miles from Darwin” which “looks
across the green Timor Sea, cooled by
the trade-winds. It is perennially sunny,
with a light surf washing on the rocky
reef where fishing is good. Painted a
cool white, his bungalow is set back a
little from the shore, amid pandanus and
poinciana-trees . . > ”
A picture of Burketown, the non-
existent Floraville, and Normanton in
the Gulf country—“ But the big old
wharf, once alive with industry, is
stripped and rotten ; its warehouses in
ruin”; a remarkably interesting article
on the flying-beef venture in the
Kimberleys ; and another equally good
account of shark-fishing off Ceduna and
Smoky Bay in the Great Australian
Bight.
A Benchley Book .
The “Reel” Benchley (Heinemann) is
reminiscent of the mess a French actor
made of a play written entirely without
the letter A by beginning “Ah, Monsieur,
vous voild!” instead of “Eh, Monsieur,
vous void!” For observe the pun in the
title of Benchley’s book, the kind of dead
dog in the street which Benchley was
born to ignore ; and then the quotes, those
horrible nudges with which the older
journalism drew attention to a bad smell.
As Howard Dietz says in his foreword:
His wit was never thrown at you, and
the many passed-up opportunities for
obvious jokes reflected his impeccable taste
and self-editorship.
This magazine-style book prints the
text and some stills from six of Bench-
ley’s film-lectures. Although the many
stills must comprise most of his reper-
toire of expressions, the book proves that
Benchley the dramatist left half the work
for Benchley the actor. It is true that
he never was a very good actor ; but the
awkwardness which was his necessity
was half his charm; it suited his role of
the incompetent lecturing the credulous ;
and it is unlikely that anyone who had
not seen his films would get his full
flavor from these pages.
For a great many Americans, to appre-
ciate Benchley was to join the company
of those who realise that the ultimate of
sophistication is to know that one is a
sucker. If his lectures were satires on
the American way of life, they were also
admissions of his part in it: the public
travesty of scientific method, as in “How
to Sleep,” “The Romance of Digestion,’
and “The Courtship of the Newt,” the
self-admiration at the base of the Ameri-
can’s affection for dogs (“How to Train
a Dog”); the American radio news-com-
mentator’s manner of dealing-out news as
though he had arranged for it ail to
happen (“No News Is Good News”)
and the feeling of evety American that,
at heart, he is a tough guy (“How to
Be a Detective”).
In the films, so much of the wit was in
the inflexion, the candor and air of quiet
authority with which he put over some
outrageous platitude or inanity ; in cold
print the lectures might pass for the
pseudo-scientific magazine-writing they
imitate so deceptively, except that here
and there Benchley lets the mask slip a
little:
Now you see the food enters here and
Easses these little white sentinels which we
ave learned to call the teeth.
You can’t photograph a real dollar bill
for fear of its having a bad moral effect
on children under twelve. So this is a
stage dollar bill, as you will see, and a
very punk imitation, too. However, it will
do for the purposes of this explanation
because this is going to be a very punk
explanation also.
And, for Benchley, the opening of this
treatise on news-commentating is some-
thing of an open thrust, where the com-
mentator is discovered studying a crystal
ball:
Oh, hello there. Just doing a little
homework. We news-commentators have
to cheat a little, you know....
About the most effective still is from
“How to Be a Detective,” where Benchley
as the private dick stays alone to meet
the crooks while his clients go for the
police. When the clients return, the room
is empty ; they go out, shutting the door ;
and, suspended by ropes from clothes-
hooks on the back of the door, Benchley
is discovered bound, gagged, a flower-
pot of rare plants forced into each hand,
and one of his shoulder-holster revolvers
thrust, pirate-style, into the waistband
of his trousers. The curious thing about
this picture is Benchley’s extraordinary
facial resemblance, in this pose, to the
Australian poet, Kenneth Slessor. Of
course, the test would be whether Slessor,
similarly posed, would resemble Bench-
ley ; but this is probably something we
shall never know.

A Word with Partridge .
Mr. Eric Partridge is a most enter-
taining writer about words and a good
friend, incidentally, to Australia: but his
chapter on the Australian language in
British and American English Since 1900
(Dakers) would have been much better
unwritten.
True, as Mr. Partridge confesses in a
postscript, it was done to fill a gap.
Mr. A. K. Thomson, senior lecturer in
English at the University of Queensland,
was to have written the Australian con-
tribution to this general survey of
developments in the English language;
his essay did not arrive in time to be
printed in the body of the book (it is in
as a supplement), so Mr. Partridge flew
to the rescue. But why print an article
which serves no useful purpose except
the melancholy one of showing that Mr.
Partridge has lost touch with Australian
literature?
A case against his article could begin
with his observation that “How strong
the Cockney influence still was in 1916
: • • - can be perceived by a careful read-
ing of C. J. Dennis’s poem The Senti-
mental Bloke” ; for it has been argued, of
course, that much of the slang in The
Sentimental Bloke was never in common
use in Australia, but was brought in by
Dennis, from Cockney sources and from
his imagination, for the purposes of his
poem. But the weakness chiefly to be
noted here is in the paragraph:
Australian writers have retained all
except the subtleties of English syntax and
all except a few superfine points of acci-
dence; mostly they have learnt to fuse the
specifically Australian vocabulary with the
general vocabulary of the language, instead
of plastering the general vocabulary with as
many Australianisms (few of them known
outside Australia) as they could lay avid,
sometimes rather indiscriminate, bands upon.
If the reputable writers employ more slang
and colloquialism than do their English
compeers, the proportion is still reassur-
ingly small. The English of such post-1914
Australian writers as Leon Gellert, Jack
Lindsay, Brian Penton, Godfrey Blunden,
Leonard Mann, James Aldridge, differs only
slightly from that of their English con-
temporaries. They have been influenced
far more by English than by American
writers, whether novelists or poets.... The
sii-Jiotable writers mentioned show only a
slight American influence; the most notable
of these influences would seem to be that
of John Steinbeck.
Now, in the first place, this looks like
a plea from Mr. Partridge for Australian
writers not to bother him with Aus-
tralianisms—“few of them known out-
side Australia”—which might disturb
overseas readers: one hopes he wouldn’t
go so far as the “Argosy,” which
changed banksias and tea-trees in Cecil
Mann’s “The Pelican” into “gum-trees”
and “wattle” for the readier comprehen-
sion of English readers. But one can
hardly imagine Mr. Partridge being as
drastic as that.
In the second place, none of the writers
he mentions shows the influence of
Steinbeck.
And in the third place, these names,
the only contemporary Australian writers
mentioned, are an extraordinarily hap-
hazard and unrepresentative collection,
three of whom live abroad and not
one of whom, with the possible exception
of Leonard Mann, could be classed as
an “indigenous” writer, springing from
the soil and habitually using an Aus-
tralian turn of speech.
Leon Gellert wrote his poems of the
Great War mostly in standard English ;
Jack Lindsay uses a jargon of his own
invention, with many echoes from his
wide reading ; Brian Penton derived from
Marcus Clarke (a colonial) and Henry
Handel Richardson (an expatriate), with
Dostoevsky in the background ; Godfrey
Blunden’s two novels, written in standard
English, were modelled on Faulkner and
John Dos Passes; Aldridge derives from
Hemingway.
Surely if you are going to discuss the
development of Australian English since
Lawson, Paterson and Furphy you must
go to such indigenous writers as Miles
Franklin, Louis Stone, Eve Langley,
Katharine Prichard, Norman Lindsay
( Saturdee ), Brian James, Judith Wright,
David Campbell and (in spite of some
American influence) Kylie Tennant and
Gavin Casey. And others.
Mr. Thomson’s supplement does some-
thing to rectify the remoteness of Mr.
Partridge’s Australian venture; Arnold
Wall and Harold Orsman have something
useful to say about New Zealand
developments; but all the contributors
are hampered by lack of space.* Scrappy
generalisations and crumbs of informa-
tion are a poor substitute for the dic-
tionaries and long scholarly analyses
which the subject requires.
FOREBEARS.
I. BEGINNING.
• Elizabeth Riddell
0 search the heart and belly, you will find
The map of blood, and it may have some
meaning
But as for me when spring burns into summer
and the blind
Suns follow each other to indifferent dark
1 will embrace my other cousin, death,
Who long ago lay with my ancestors.
II. THE REVEREND EDWARD SMITH.
By wagon MU he went
Forgiving his parish,
His left and right neighbors,
His wife in her narrow bed
The sheets to her chin,
The keeper of the inn,
The blind man in the watchhouse,
His cook and acquaintance,
Squire Rat in his Mgh boots,
And Lord and Lady Mouse.
But they, not so lavish
With tender excuses
Refused to condone
His meagre black legs,
His long cold fingers,
The sighing of his prayers
On light bright mornings,
His hauntings and warnings,
And now he is dead
They avoid the stone
And the thin rim of grass
On his pious bone.
III. JOHN TEAGUE.
He twined the country like a briar in the fair
weather
But when the autumn gales
Tore at the stubborn roots of rocks and trees
Who lit his lamp?
For other men leave home to live like saints or
die like dogs
But he to practise divination.
The old woman would pay him a penny to
twitch
The bowels with fear
(Somewhat better than a witch
Because at least a man)
But the farmer would not hear
111 omen of the harvest till it failed
And then would set the louts, the priest, and
fire
And girls crying and horses and men, the bishop
in red
With hounds and prayer to run and read him
out.
The village shuddered back into its dust
And he with blood about his head
Threaded the country like a briar;
But when the gales of autumn shook the world
Who lit his lamp?
He could endure the rods across his back
But not the woman and child beside the hearth.
He was John Teague who left his cobbler’s shop
To practise divination.
IV. MONTFORT LEE AND PETER GOCKERILL
When the ships Nimbus and Pacific Fortune
Slid under the southing star
To Hobart Town came I in the blood
Of Montfort Lee and Peter Cockerill
(Of Bankbourne in this parish, deeply mourned)
Came I in their round pale eyes and pale
smooth hair
And with them planted quinces, pears and wheat
And with them rose at dawn to be a farmer
And with them drank
(Gentry’s white cutis below the jacket sleeves)
The wine at Norfolk,
And later drank the cider and the ale
But never said with them, What news of home?
I was the seed they sowed when nothing stirred
Across the river but a kingfisher
Abreast of morning;
Who laid the hophelds wide and planted vines
And built a house of stone and sailed a boat
And went to marriages and funerals
And matched each other’s daughters with their
sons
And rode their horses by the willow trees
And read few books, and seldom sang a song.
V. MARY LOMAX.
Here is the woman with the face of pearl and
rose,
The vast madonna of misunderstanding, she
With laces at her wrist, and the unearthly glow
Of ritual in her evening’s arbor pose.
My mother’s mother’s mother, she in paint
And gilt by secondary artists set
Upon the wall; and all her axioms lie
Like shattered china round her, and the faint
Tinkle of teacups dies and dies away.
Nothing is left of all she had to say.
VI. THE MAN FROM RICHMOND.
The man from Richmond ran before
The lads upon his stumbling heel
Past the church and past the store
Past the smith and the millwheel
Past the rhododendrons drowned
Pale pale under the rain
Ran ran until he found
Shelter where the hawthorned lane
Turned to the meadow. There he lay
Put his face to the earth and wept;
As cries of idiot died away
The man slept.
He the father, he the fool
Caught between the hill and stream,
Between the cliff and the shallow pool,
The people and the dream.
He the zany, he the clod
Lying under the hawthorn tree
Wept because he was not God.
He was I and I am he.

1951 AND ALL THAT.
Australia’s Jubilee year is about to pass
away without much evidence recorded of
a popular sen s 6 of Jubilee. Climatically
the cycle is near complete, for one cele-
bration omitted nothing in the display.
J, this year 1951 has smitten
he land with drought, in eastern parts a
worse drought and accompanied by more
destructive fires throughout the country
areas. J
The Commonwealth, surveying the
years, could plume itself on having
grown enormously in stature, politically,
industrially and in prestige among the
nations. But at no time since Federa-
tion has there been any real satisfaction
in Commonwealth Parliaments and Gov-
ernments with the adequacy of the
constitutional powers, and in the Jubilee
year least of all. In his study of
Napoleon 111 and the later career of
Bonapartism, Philip Guedalla remarked
of the first Napoleon’s father that his
abiding interest was “a constant expec-
tation of judgment in an action in which
he cited as respondents the Order of
Jesus and the French Crown. Such
judgments are rarely delivered in the
lifetime of the parties.” Any summing-up
of experiences in trying to alter the Aus-
tralian Federal Constitution by referen-
dum will be not greatly different.
Original States, resisting tooth and
nail every effort to break up their large
domains into smaller and more conveni-
ent State areas, have, during the conclud-
ing decade of the Commonwealth’s first
half-century, become equally discon-
tented with a major constitutional change
affecting their financial independence,
brought about not by any of the con-
stitutional means provided but by an
artful assertion against the States,
sanctioned by the High Court, of the
Commonwealth’s supremacy in the field
of direct income taxation. This was
astounding, indeed, as a complete rever-
sal of practice with which the Common-
wealth Parliament began life, namely,
that the Commonwealth would levy no
income tax at all; and it became the
more astonishing in the Jubilee year
when a baffled Commonwealth Govern-
ment, obliged to undertake preparations
to meet threatened world war, found on
submission the same High Court ruling
that the Commonwealth’s defence powers
—supposed to be full and unquestionable
whatever others in the Constitution
might be doubtful —were not enough to
allow the Commonwealth executive and
Parliament the discretion of deciding
when a state of war-emergency was to
be deemed imminent.
Thus Australia entered her second
half-century as a federation with both
States and Commonwealth convinced
that the division between them of
sovereign powers must be radically
reviewed, and convinced also that the
referendum as an expedient for solving
such conflict is wellnigh useless. The
intense party-allegiances of politicians,
both Commonwealth and State, have
made it so. At the conclusion of the
year of organised Jubilee celebrations —
which somehow went a little lame—a
citizen was writing to the Melbourne
Press to protest that in the referendum of
1901, which accepted the Commonwealth
Constitution, many people voted “Yes”
under “the mistaken impression that all
the State Parliaments were to be
abolished.” This belated comment, may-
be valid enough both 50 years ago and
today, might stand as a finishing-touch
in condemnation of the whole referen-
dum method of repairing constitutional
defects.
The Commonwealth was born under
the influence of Mars, and that influence
was dominant also in the Jubilee year,
as during two notable decades of the past
half-century. Of Australia, “beautiful,
bold and browned” at her inauguration
in nationhood, Kipling’s saluting paean
opened:—
Her hand was still on her sword-hilt, the
spur was still on her heel,
She had not cast her harness of grey, war-
dinted steel....
and her silver Jubilee year found her
fighting in ’a strange, fierce, half-
recognised war in Korea, a war sus-
tained by international democracy to
prevent war and pursued in the desperate
hope that if it be contained in that
quarter it may not spread elsewhere. This
conflict and the universal summons to
rearmament against a reincarnation of
Hitler in Moscow obscured the Jubilee
for most Australians; and the obscurity
deepened as the year rolled on with the
same baleful influence animating civil
wars (similarly inconclusive) in Malaya
and Indo-China, with armies in India and
Pakistan concentrated against each other
in Kashmir, with insurrections raised, on
formidable anti-British violence in
Persia and Egypt, and with Red armies
ready to plunge the Balkans into war
for the obliteration of the last State
unsubjugated to the Soviet in the Danube
valley.
Despite this unhappy preoccupation,
the Australian people felt themselves in
1951 to be emerging in chrysalis-fashion
from something more than a formal
half-century of nationhood. The enor-
mous industrial development of the recent
war years was continued apace in the
later ’forties of so-called peace, and for
the first time in the Commonwealth’s
history all political parties were agreed
on the necessity for rapid increase of
the population by immigrant settlement,
especially of displaced workers from
central Europe. During the past year
also the Australian electorate emerged,
after a second general election on the
subject, from an experiment in socialisa-
tion under “Labor” which benefited only
the Communists and had so ingrafted
them into the “Labor” party, politically
and industrially, as to split it from top
to bottom. As the year closed a grow-
ing proportion of the people, with eyes
opened at last to the pretences of politi-
cal quackery, began to recognise the real
cause of inflation in the lowered rate of
man-hour production, especially in the
basic industries.
Although the Menzies Government’s
referendum seeking powers to legislate
against Communism in the unions was
defeated, the margin against its proposals
was very narrow, and great numbers of
Australian trade - unionists obviously
voted for the Government’s proposals.
The reaction was entirely healthy in
certain notoriously Communist-controlled
unions. Two of them, the ironworkers
and the clerks, reached out eagerly for
the Government’s new legislation em-
powering the Arbitration Court, on
request, to conduct secret ballots for
union executive offices —a further blow
to the political “Labor” party, which had
strenuously opposed this reform as
“interfering with the unions.” A third,
the Miners’ Federation, finished the
year with ballots expected to remove
the long dominance of leading Com-
munists on the miners’ executive. The
realisation thus betokened that the only
effective means of defeating inflation,
shortage of commodities and Communist
sabotage in the unions lies in the hands
of the people themselves was the most
hopeful sign as the year closed. If that
development prospers the loss of the anti-
communist referendum could prove a
signal gain after all.
Outstanding political achievement of
the year, again in the teeth of “Labor”
opposition, was the adroit way in which
the Government, and even more the
Army training staff, popularised the
revival, over a much extended period, of
compulsory military training. In no
fashion could the Jubilee year have been
more fittingly celebrated. An older
generation which had learnt its lesson the
hard way and at heavy cost has hailed
with enthusiasm the quality of the pre-
sent young Australian soldier turned out
by this training at home, and the proof
of it is in Korea. Here also is a sign of
an awakening from the slack years which
distinguishes 1951 at once in its own
right and as a Jubilee year in Australia’s
history.
"No Santa Claus!"
Dr. Evatt chose the beginning of the
week before Christmas, the season of
goodwill and co-operation, to issue his
latest jeremiad against the Federal Gov-
ernment, which, as a representative of
Western civilisation vis-a-vis Russian
totalitarian aggression, has its hands full
at the moment.
The two years of the Menzies-Fadden
Administration, declared the Doctor, had
meant a steady decline in the internal and
external stability of Australia. Aus-
tralia’s overseas funds had been “steadily
drained away by steadily increasing
imports and falling exports.” Meanwhile,
in Australia, there was “an utter disregard
of the gradual destruction of the value
of the pound by inflation”:
The Federal Budget, with its increased
direct taxation and its burden of sales
tax, was adding to this destruction of
monetary values while prices showed no
tendency to drop.
And it went on —all the old stuff from
the Old Firm which rose to office in the
war by stealing the Communist policy
of whining their opponents to ruin, of
riding high with class-hatred and greed as
their mounts and a moan for their battle-
cry. “Discredited banking policies
reminiscent of the 1930’s with the un-
employed armies” . . . “disastrous concep-
tion of an economy based on a percentage
of unemployed”—these are the basic
phrases of Dr. Evatt’s uncheery Christmas
message. Not a word of rejoicing or a
comment on the great prospects ahead
of Australia if we only work and forget
class and party for a while.
The Evatt theory, like that of his party
and of the Kremlin, is that everything
springs from the Government in power ;
that no good can come out of personal
and private initiative ; that until Capi-
talism is destroyed and (in Mr. Cal well’s
graphic words) the “fowl is plucked” for
the benefit of what are called the
“workers,” no quarter must be shown in
the class-war. While it remains possible
for the electors to put a Liberal Govern-
ment into power there can be no well-
being in the community.
When “Labor” is permanently in power
everything will be just as permanently
lovely. The birds will sing, the flowers
will grow, the wheat will spring and world
markets will keep at boom levels. All
will be achieved for us for ever by
the magic of the Dan Curtins, the Dan
Mulcahys, the Dan Minogues and the
McGirrs, not to mention the Clive
Evatts and the Fergusons. “Labor” can
do everything and anything. Menzies can
do nothing but destroy the economy of
the country. And this would be the
stand of Dr. Evatt and his followers,
Communist and otherwise, even though
Mr. Fadden were to find a way of making
gold grow like grass and work do itself.
About the most sinister feature of the
diatribes of Dr. Evatt and his fol-
lowers is that the utterers of them
have an air of hoping that what they
prophesy will happen. And why
shouldn’t they hope that way? Many
of them would be still doing honest
toil as laborers if it had not been for
the great depression, which has been their
finest political asset for 20 years. But
the old cry of hunger and want needs
refurbishing by a little new experience
of misery to remind the country of its
past sufferings, real and imagined.
“The depression” has been a cherished
catchcry of “Labor” even though it was
a period of “Labor’s” most disastrous
debacles. It is a weakness of Liberal
strategy that it fails to counter
“Labor’s” claim to have the only panaceas
for preventing and dealing with depres-
sion by bringing it home that when de-
pression did come it hit Australia harder
under “Labor” than it did most other
British countries, and that “Labor”
promptly cracked under the strain as it
always does in crisis. It was then that it
abrogated its industrial leadership to the
Communists and their fellow-travellers
and other wreckers, and, having nearly
brought about revolution in N. S. Wales,
was chucked out ignominiously in Can-
berra and N. S. Wales by an overwhelm-
ingly hostile vote, and kept out of office
for a decade.
It returned even then in the
Federal sphere only by accident
through the temporary demoralisation of
the Government party as the result of
the inopportune death of the Prime
Minister (on the verge of war) and the
loss of three of Mr. Menzies’s ablest and
most trusted Ministers in an aircraft
accident. And it survived while there
was anything to give, but was thrown out
when it tried to undermine the very
foundations of the free-enterprise system
by a plan of which the destruction of
the trading banks was to be only one item.
“Labor’s” present propaganda is, of
course, having an effect, and that is to
be expected in a land which has been
taught officially for nearly 10 years that it
is meritorious to be selfish and that a fair
thing is what you can squeeze by union
blackmail or political pressure out of
somebody else. That it has had effect
is not entirely owing to the power of
“Labor’s” own publicity, but to the sup-
port of newspaper (chiefly Sydney) and
other interests, which have added their
authority to Dr. Evatt’s groaning. In
certain quarters there is a tendency to
play “Labor’s” game and make the most
of every straw in the wind to help prove
its case in return for favors unblushingly
promised. Let some industry which has
been engaged in a riot of profiteering
luxury trading show signs of coming down
to solid earth and there is a loud shriek
about “the slump.” Let the price of
wool fall and the wheat crop be short and
cries are heard about the dreadful deple-
tion of our overseas balances —a condi-
tion of affairs which too much internal
spending would only aggravate, anyway,
but which is laid right on the doorstep

A Tip for New Year.
A lot of people indulge in a sort of
personal stocktaking at the end of a year,
survey the mistakes and achievements of
the past twelve months, and look forward
to the new year with an inner resolution
not to be such darned fools again. There
is, most of us hope, also a sort of national
stocktaking which inspires somewhat
similar resolutions.
If there is, it wouldn’t be a bad idea
for Australia to consider the remarks of
Sir Douglas Copland, made a few
weeks ago in a general statement on
the deterioration of the national trade
balance:
It will be necessary for Australia to free
itself from the mentality of the depression.
Step by step all our exports, except wool
and metals, are being drawn permanently
into a net of controls and restrictive agree-
ments of some kind. It is true that these
are designed to shelter the producer from
the rigors of the world market, but for a
young country this search for security can
be carried too far.
The “depression mentality” is all too
evident in politics. It is also responsible
for the fall in manpower output in
industry—“ Hey, slow down, Jack, or
you’ll work yourself out of a job”—and,
to their everlasting disgrace, many poli-
ticians encourage it.
The “search for security” has already
been carried too far. It has reduced the
hitherto adventurous land industries to a
dependence on Government management
of their affairs which would have been
incredible and sickening to the previous
generation of farmers. Where once it
was common to hear a farmer say, “I
wouldn’t take a bob of Government
money,” now the common thing is,
“When is the Government going to do
something about us?”
This attitude is by no means peculiar
to farmers. It has only infected them
after debilitating pretty well every other
section of a community which was filled
up with “new-order” pap in war-time and,
until quite recently, was taught that it
was about to inherit a Golden Age on
earth designed and managed by Socialists.
The year is closing with the “depression
mentality” manifest in the mild panic
among some workers and some em-
ployers. It finds its spokesmen in poli-
ticians like Dr. Evatt, with his “pool of
unemployed,” and Mr. McGirr, with his
vision of “a vast army of unemployed
next year.” Both speak from ignorance
or hypocrisy, or both, for the simple
truth is that there is more real work
waiting in Australia than hands to do it.
If the inflation picnic is over—and some
people thereby compelled to turn to really
important work —so much the better.
As for the “net of controls and restric-
tive agreements,” it must be broken as
soon as possible, and men of inventive-
ness and enterprise freed from its mad-
dening and expensive toils. For, until
they are free, to talk of a happy New
Year for Australia is cant.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Forty-hour Talks.
After three weeks’ consideration of the
questions put to them, employers’ and
unions’ representatives again met Mr.
Justice Kelly of the Arbitration Court
and agreed to a conference on the 40-hour
week on February 11.
The move arose from claims by certain
unions for a 36-hour week and by certain
employers for a return to 44 hours. The
unions’ claim, if granted, would clearly
wreck all State railways and transport
services, crippled enough already by the
effect of reduction of working hours from
44 to 40. N.S.W. and Victorian railways,
especially, have never been able to make
up the staff shortage and the financial
losses resulting from the cutting of weekly
hours four years ago.
The employers have prime facie an
indisputable case for a review by the
court of the effects of its 40-hour award,
expressly stated in the terms of the deci-
sion as being “an experiment” which, if
shown to be a mistake, could be revised.
This case is reinforced, too, with recent
statements from the Arbitration Court
bench that even the 40-hour week is not
being worked (Kelly, J.) and that one of
the factors maintaining high prices is the
court’s standard-hours decision (Foster,
J.).
Mr. Justice Kelly is pursuing the correct
course in trying to bring the parties to
agreement, using the court’s conciliation
equipment, before allowing a dog-
fight to be launched on a question which
wifi set industry generally by the ears.
It is something that the A.C.T.U. state-
ment to the court last week should have
admitted the need for employer-employee
collaboration to increase production by
eliminating waste, assuring continuity of
work and cessation of job-control stop-
pages, and closer consultation in the con-
duct of industries as a matter of practice.
But the effects of reduced working hours
upon the costs of basic services (especially
transport) have been so injurious that the
February conference cannot hope to get
anywhere unless there is placed promin-
ently on the agenda the subject of a fac-
tual review of the 40-hour week during
its four years’ operation.
To talk about a further five years’ trial
of the “experiment” at this stage begs the
whole question now listed for considera-
tion. , .
If the Governments of the chief indus-
trial States are not represented, as lead-
ing employers, to demonstrate the effect
on State railway services, then employers
should prepare a statement of their own
on recent experience of shortcomings and
delays in those services, the rise in
freights and the widespread thieving—all
traceable to inadequate staff for operation
and maintenance, and for protection of
customers’ goods. It should not be beyond
their competence by such evidence to
compel State Governments to offer their
own testimony, a matter of first-class
public interest. It would be fascinating,
for instance, to hear Premier McGirr,
of N. S. Wales, giving as evidence on
oath some of the statements he has made
on economic conditions over the past
four years. __
Mr. Casey on Inflation.
Mr. R G. Casey, Minister for External
Affairs, has returned home after a
two-months trip abroad to the U.N.O.
Assembly and America. He has done a
good job for Australia, and has per-
formed the astonishing feat, for an Aus-
tralian External Affairs Minister, of
having behaved like an adult instead of
like a 15-year-old playing the combined
roles of Julius Caesar, Disraeli and the
Oracle of Delphi.
Mr. Casey has come back with a con-
ception of the world position which is
clear and logical. He showed the same
faculty for observation when he visited
Southern Asia earlier in his term of office,
and his ideas about the importance of the
neglected Indo-China area are now
coming to be shared by everyone who
studies the situation.
Mr. Casey has now characterised in-
flation as the secret weapon of the Com-
munists, and declared that it was the
plan of international aggressive Com-
munism to force the democracies to arm,
thus reducing the volume of consumer
goods and raising prices in a ruinously
inflationary way:
I believe that the Russians are well
aware of this process and that the arro-
gant and abusive speeches of Vlshinsky and
other Russian spokesmen are probably de-
signed to Increase international tension
and to encourage the democracies to put
an Increasingly great strain on their eco-
nomies through rearmament. There is a
saying in the Middle East, “You don’t
try to cut a man’s throat when you have
already put poison in his soup.” The
poison of inflation is working everywhere,
and no doubt the Russians are counting
on the economy of one or other of the
democracies crashing under the increas-
ing strain.
He said that by this process, opening the
way for fifth-columns, the Communists
believed that there was a good chance
to communise the world without fighting,
or at least provoking a world war.
This is true, though there is little doubt
in Mr. Casey’s or any other mind that
the Russian bloc will not shrink from
large-scale aggression if it pays or if its
other insidious plan fails.
The statement should serve as a salutary
warning for “Labor,” since on the ques-
tion of inflation it is pursuing the same
course as the Communists, stating the
same views and putting forward the same
“remedies.” Both parties, hand-in-glove
in a United Front to destroy the Liberal
Government, hold that inflation is a local
phenomenon which could be cured by the
present Government and will be cured
immediately with a few magic regulations
if that Government is defeated and “sane
government”—i.e., government by a
“Labor” party honeycombed from the
neck downwards with Communists —is
restored.
That is a cynically dishonest propa-
ganda, a fellow-traveller propaganda
giving aid and comfort to a dangerous
enemy.
That "Used-car" Racket.
One good thing the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment’s credit-restrictions have done is
to be seen in what the daily Press refers
to as “the slump in the used-car trade.”
“S. M. Herald” published in its story this
sweet bit:
The Australian car trade was more than
buoyant up to June this year. It was
possible then to take delivery of a new
vehicle and resell it at hundreds of pounds
above the new price.
And how! The procedure described
was “possible” chiefly for second-hand
dealers, and the racket that was created
in Sydney smelt to high heaven. But
did anyone in the McGirr Cabinet, those
single-minded administrators for the
public good, those “Labor” peddlers of
price-control as an inflation-killer, stop
to ask who got the difference between
the listed price of a new car delivered to
trade-distributors and that charged by
second-hand car dealers, who got “hun-
dreds of pounds” more for the same
vehicle after five miles or so had been
registered on its speedometer? Is it on
record that any “Labor” member wanted
to know in the N.S.W. Parliament what
their Prices Minister, with his famous
“blankef’-control on all prices, or those
Galahads in the list sagainst profiteering,
the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-
General, were doing about it?
What The Bulletin’s N.Z. cor-
respondent wrote last week will do for
the condition of affairs that under States’
price-control was tolerated in Australia,
He said:
Car-salesmen are Maoriland’s new rich,
and until recently dealing in cars was the
biggest racket. While Maorilanders waited
for new cars, brand-new models were
spirited away to used-car salesrooms
almost before their speedometers started
to tick, and their price jumped hundreds.
The credit-restriction has damped down
the racket for the moment.. ..The casy-
money gentry are also champion tax-
dodgers....
Along with numerous bona-fide con-
tractors to purchase new imported cars,
some astute ones, who put their names
and deposits down for several makes in
order to resell their options on a margin,
are also getting their fingers burnt. In
Melbourne some dealers say “the reces-
sion in second-hand sales is only tempo-
rary” and that they are “buying while
the market is easier.”
The Press.
“H.H.L.”: In 30 years as a journalist on
Australian metropolitan dailies, news-
papers have undergone great changes, not
all to the good. I have seen the emerg-
ence of the “technicians” —the presenta-
tion and layout experts, the window-
dressers of the profession, the men who,
by skilful use of type-faces, pictures and
other artifices, strive for what they believe
to be the well-balanced, attractively
dressed-up page. Even if, in the final
result, it is sometimes difficult to decide
where a story begins and ends, they do
as good a job as is done anywhere else
in the world. They have nothing to learn
from the newspapers of Fleet-street and
New York, which count their circula-
tions in millions.
But I fear that I have also seen the
gradual disappearance of something even
more important than the architecture of
a news-page, something that might be
summed-up briefly as a sense of respon-
sibility to readers. Thirty years ago there
were newspapers in Australia which had
nation-wide, in some cases Empire-wide,
reputations for sanity, balance, judg-
ment and, above all, accuracy. This last
was their lodestar. What people read in
those newspapers they accepted as
fact
Accuracy was the ruling passion of the
editors, sub-editors and chiefs-of-staff of
those journals ; inaccuracy the unpardon-
able crime. Jn appearance they were
deadly dull, judged by present-day
standards, but they performed faithfully
and honestly what they still regarded as
the prime function of a newspaper —the
publication of news. “When in doubt,
leave out” was the axiom ground into
cub reporters.
If, as a political correspondent in those
days, I wrote a story forecasting, say, the
downfall of a Government, I knew that
within half an hour of my filing it I
would be summoned to the editorial
presence and thoroughly questioned. The
editor always had to be well satisfied
that his paper was putting out no half-
baked tale to its readers.
On the evidence of the papers I read
I doubt whether such scrupulous care is
taken these days. I am afraid that the
deciding test applied now is “Is it a good
story?” If it is, then it gets the page-one
streamer. It is “given a fly” on the
assumption that if it doesn’t come off it
doesn’t matter. “Readers have short
memories.” It will be a bad day for
newspapers when readers start to show
that they haven’t got such short memories
after all.
The “laying-out” of pages has become
almost a religious rite in some newspaper
offices. Highly-paid men do little else
but decide how each page will look.
Hours before the paper goes to press they
decide on its typographical content. The
stories that come later to the subs’ table
are trimmed and headed to fit into certain
pages and columns previously allotted to
them —probably before the events hap-
pened. In other days the news-value of
the stories dictated the nature of the lay-
out. If it was a big story it was treated
accordingly. Stories were given what they
were worth and were not assessed by
some arbitrary yardstick predetermined
by the layout experts.
Maybe* all this skilful throwing-about
of type has some psychological effect on
the reader. Maybe it is necessary to
scream your wares in a highly competi-
tive world. All I know is that outside a
newspaper office I have never heard any
frenzied discussion on the relative merits
or demerits of Bodoni, Cheltenham,
Caslon or any other of the endless range
of type-faces. In fact, I have never
heard any ordinary newspaper-reader
make the slightest comment on that
presentation which is now so much the
fetish of the newspaper people. I have
a feeling that they would still read every-
thing that interested them if no heading
in the paper went over 10-point type.
Education By Lottery.
It was a pity Mr. Heffron, the N.S.W.
Minister for Education, had to echo his
leader and blame the Menzies Govern-
ment for the financial obstacles in the
way of a full education programme in
Mr. Heffron’s State. There never was —
whatever the color of the State or Federal
Governments enough money for
education.
As Mr. Heffron points out, whereas a
child could be put through school in
1939 at a cost to the State of
£l6 10s. a year, it now costs just on £4O,
and will be close to £6O within the next
five years. Just on 339.000 pupils attended
public schools in N.S.W. in 1945 ; this
year the number is just on 410,000 ; the
estimate for 1957 is 544,000,
Comparable figures undoubtedly exist
in the other States, and they, like N.S.W.,
face the same problems of finance. When
to these figures of primary and secondary
State schools are added the figures of
non-State schools, agricultural colleges,
universities and so forth, some idea of
the problem of national education is
formed. The cost of building more
accommodation for the rapidly-growing
number of pupils becomes an imposing
figure on its own.
On the day that Mr. Heffron’s remarks
were published, Sydney University said it
would have to increase students’ fees by
50 p.c. at once, it had a deficit of £365,562,
and even with the increased fees would
still be about £200,000 behind. Mr. Abe
Landa, M.L.A., whose Alma Mater it is,
and who is a member of its senate, was
outraged by the decision, firmly opposed
it, said “somebody would have to do
something” about the deficit, and pro-
posed a special State lottery at a quid a
ticket.
After which Mr. Landa went off to
enjoy Christmas with an extra £5OO a
year added to his Parliamentary salary.
The underpaid university professors and
tutors, for their part, contemplate another
year of trying to supplement their
salaries with hack work in editing and
reviewing books, Press and radio articles,
and by other uncertain means.
N.S.W. claims to be the biggest and
wealthiest of the States, yet its university
is nowhere near as well off financially as
those of most other States. As a general
rule its people are not as well educated
as those of other States, and, to judge
by superficial appearances at least,
N.S.W. pays nothing for brains in com-
parison with what it pays for jockeys,
quizmasters, comic-strips, beer-barons
and building laborers.
In an era when even suburban councils
consider that it pays to put neon signs
on their offices, what education generally
and the university in particular lacks is
good and persistent publicity. A well-
conducted public-relations office would
certainly do more for both than Mr.
Landa’s lottery idea.
Competition from Overseas.
From Auckland: A tough nut that
Maoriland’s young Board of Trade hasn’t
been able to crack yet, although it has
Australia’s experience to guide it, is how
to throw open the door to imports which
compete with local output without ex-
posing New Zealand manufacturers to
threats of dumping and cut-price wars.
Every concern that must court the
smiles or endure the frowns of Dame
Fashion has been harping on the risk,
through trade groups, or in direct
approaches to the B. of T., whenever it
has had a chance, for months past.
Whether the dumping danger has been
overrated or not, it is clear that this is,
potentially, the thorniest of all problems
for the inexperienced board. Australia’s
case is not a perfect parallel, partly be-
cause of the difference in industrial
advancement, also because of the in-
tricacies of the tariff, which would tax
the skill of a team of experts to analyse
and compare, and to no small degree be-
cause of the 20 per cent, difference be-
tween the £A and the £NZ.
For nearly 13 years New Zealand in-
dustries have been sheltered, pampered
or nurtured in a field that has been
almost a close preserve, and have grown
to regard monopoly conditions as a
normal form of life. It won’t be easy
to get them out of this way of thinking,
and the B. of T. so far hasn’t been able
to make up its mind whether there should
be some form of modified import-control
to reinforce tariff protection, or whether
a “floor-price” for imports or some other
device should be invented to put local
industry on competitive terms with over-
seas suppliers.
Meanwhile, impatient Maoriland
traders and uneasy manufacturers aren't
finding things easy waiting on the board's
doorstep. With hopes of more plentiful
supplies before long and a considerable
volume of mainly non-competitive goods
already flowing in, retailers are showing
a spirit of independence which has shaken
industry out of its complacent mood.
It is a buyer’s market now to a great
extent, in striking contrast to conditions
during the strike last autumn and after-
wards until trade got into its stride. Now
the advantage lies with retailers in a battle
of wits, whereas nearly all the cards were
held by manufacturers before the Board
of Trade got into harness and began to
free trade from the worst of its shackles.
This has made manufacturers a lot
more touchy over price-control than they
were, and they’re kicking. They’ve
branded control as “inefficient, discrimin-
atory, unjust and intolerable,” and de-
manded at their annual conference that
the Government abolish it, except where
subsidies are involved. Under the guise
of “profit-control”-—and M.L. officialdom
hasn’t been able to think of a better yard-
stick for fixing prices—it penalises
efficient firms and helps the laggards, or
makes liars of manufacturers, with the
biggest liar getting the biggest profit.
Reds Up Against It.
As a sequel to the long-drawn-out pro-
ceedings which resulted in the 1949 elec-
tions of the Ironworkers’ Association
being upset by the Arbitration Court, Mr.
Justice Dunphy last week said that he
was referring the forged ballot-papers to
the Federal Attorney-General so that the
legal position could be examined. Saying
that certain persons had obtained offices
of profit or power in the union “through
a cynical and totalitarian disregard of
the hard-won rights of organised labor
and by means that would not be tolerated
in Parliamentary elections,” the judge
argued that “all possible legislative safe-
guards” should be created to secure the
validity and integrity of union elections.
In referring the papers to the Attorney-
General he felt that if the forging of

J
union ballot-papers constituted a crime
and the criminal could be discovered he
should be brought to trial. If it were
held not to be a crime Parliament should
remedy the situation.
The chief beneficiary of the 1961
forged papers produced in court, Ernest
(“Balance-sheet”) Thornton, of whom the
judge said “it would be stretching one’s
credulity beyond all limits even to attempt
to believe” that the faking was done with-
out his knowledge, is at present beyond
the reach of extradition—he’s in Peking,
serving his Soviet masters more openly
than when he held the secretaryship of
the ironworkers on votes “from a tainted
source and by foul means” —but the
lesser beneficiaries are still about the
place. They are, in fact, still holding on
to power and doing their damnedest to
frustrate the court’s intention of giving
the rank-and-file of the union the chance
to pass an honest judgment on them.
Although the court’s verdict has not
completed the task of freeing the iron-
workers from Communist domination,
the end seems to be in sight, and there
appears little doubt that it has
strengthened the resolve of anti-Com-
munist members of other unions in the
Red grip.
The annual conference of the N. S.
Wales Teachers’ Federation is one
example of this. It passed a resolution
deciding that the three senior positions
on the executive of the union will in
future be decided by secret postal ballot
—in the past they have been chosen by
the Federal council —and it knocked back
an attempt by its Red president, S. P.
Lewis, to have the ballot postponed till
1953. Secondly, the conference rebuked
the executive for using union funds to
support the “No” case at the referendum.
Another union in which feeling against
the Communist-dominated executive has
become more vocal since the iron-
workers boilover is the Federated Clerks’
Union —chief commissar, J. Hughes.
Last Wednesday an argument at the
annual meeting ended in the moderates
moving a motion of no-confidence in the
chairman and marching out of the meet-
ing. About two-thirds of those present
walked out.
The Comrades have had their hand on
too many trade-unions for too long.
“Labor,” while claiming that the best
way to deal with Communism is to fight
it inside the unions, has done little to
help those unionists who really want to
get rid of their Red riders. The legisla-
tion which made the ironworkers’ inquiry
possible was opposed by Dr. Evatt and
his party, and they have never given
more than token assistance to the
industrial groups. And it is guineas to
gooseberries that if the Attorney-General
finds it necessary to bring in legislation
on the lines suggested by Dunphy, J.,
Federal “Labor” will oppose it as
another interference with civil liberties.
POLITICAL POINTS
The A.B.C. may have killed Santa
Claus, but it’ll be hard to persuade N. S.
Wales Parliamentarians, their stockings
bulging with a £lO-a-week salary-rise, that
the old gentleman is dead.
Scorfield’s cartoon of the phony
Korean Santa Claus came true almost
before the presses finished printing it.
Last week it was reported that enemy
troops, slipping through the U.N. lines
in the dark, left Christmas-cards and
small gifts in the Canadian positions.
Cards were inscribed “Greetings from
the Chinese People’s Volunteers, Korea,
1951.” With armistice-talks in their sixth
month and with Communist leaders
apparently determined to drag negotia-
tions on till doomsday, the Canucks felt
much the same about the Red Santas as
did Scorfield’s Diggers.
While Mr. Chifley lived his colleagues,
with minor and occasional exceptions,
were satisfied to leave the party’s state-
ments on finance and economics to him,
contenting themselves with chiming-in
whenever the spirit moved them with
diatribes against “the banks,” recollec-
tions of the last depression and
prophecies of another one if “Labor”
should ever be removed from the Trea-
sury benches. Doc. Evatt, in assuming
the leadership of the Opposition, has also
taken over the post of spokesman for the
party on finance, and so far he is not
making much of a fist of the job. His
pre-Christmas utterances on the subject
brought from the Prime Minister the
comment that “Dr. Evatt has never
shown much understanding of the eco-
nomic problem, but his recent statements
are baffling.”
Menzies went on to say that the Doc.
professed concern at the prospect of
increased inflation, yet criticised every
move the Government made to combat
it, without putting forward any alterna-
tive scheme himself. He had raised the
old bogy of unemployment when it was
obvious that there were thousands more
jobs than men ; although he had been
a member of a Government which im-
posed control of capital and credit in
the interests of war-time stability he now
opposed such controls when the Com-
monwealth had on its hands “a war of
a different kind against a less tangible
enemy”; he urged the reduction of im-
ports to conserve London funds, yet
unless there was a remarkable increase in
local production reduction of imports, by
reducing the total volume of goods avail-
able for sale here, “would aggravate the
inflation he professed to condemn.”
If the Doc. continues to propound his
self - contradictory prescription for
national recovery, Jock Garden will be
justified in issuing a public denial that
he ever attempted to teach the Opposi-
tion-leader the elements of economics.
Because of “dissatisfaction with
award marginal rates,” the Plumbers’
Union executive in Victoria has decided
to call a slopwork meeting in the new
year on all Melbourne jobs, and to ask
it to ban overtime and approve of “roll-
ing” strikes against building jobs through-
out the State in order to blackmail em-
ployers into granting increases outside the
Arbitration Court’s rates. The Painters’
Union has intimated that it will do like-
wise, and the idea is expected to spread
throughout the Communist-run amal-
gation of building trades. Dr. Evatt
should now be due to deliver another
spruik against somebody’s deliberate
organising of a depression in industry.
It’s odds on he won’t observe this example
of it.
In the argument over one-man buses
which left Sydney without trams and
buses for 24 hours at the height of the
Christmas shopping rush, each side blamed
the other for the showdown happening
at that particular lime, but the weakness
of the union case is shown by the fact
that it allows its members to work one-
man buses on privately-run services while
opposing the Government’s attempt to
introduce them. Even on busless Thurs-
day the private buses were manned by
members of the striking union.
One-man buses? A one-man service
runs from the big square in the centre of
Los Angeles (U.S.A.) to Hollywood. The
driver opens and shuts the door with a
lever, gives change to passengers where
required, operates a machine that sorts
out the nickels, dimes and quarters, wraps
’em up, drives the bus and fills in a form
giving details of the takings of his shift.
In addition, he usually finds time to
whistle while he works.
While bushfires raged on the Blue
Mountains, across the Emu Plains and
in sundry other parts, a Sydney news-
paper published this advice to holiday
hikers: “If lost do not panic but sit
down and plan logically. Light a smoky
fire to attract attention.” It would
certainly attract attention,
Bumie (Tas.) has just welcomed its
biggest batch of migrants, and instead of
adding to the town’s housing problem
the newcomers are going to do something
towards solving it. There are 71 in the
party, including women and children, and
the dads are all employees of the build-
ing firm, Lunnicks, which, in accepting
contracts to build homes in Burnie, de-
cided to move from England to Tassie
lock, stock and barrel. The staff agreed—
in the words of the founder of the firm,
“Everybody from the blacksmith to the
accountant” —and they’ll start their new
life in the New Year.
Industrial-groupers in S.A. unions
aren’t giving up their fight against the
Reds, despite the ban put on them by
the State convention of the A.L.P.
According to the “Advertiser” they are
forming a S.A. Industries Committee with
the object of restoring democratic con-
ditions in Communist-dominated unions.
Sydney “Tribune” gives “the simple
truth” about the ransom money being
extorted from Chinese residents of Aus-
tralia, America and other countries;
As an instalment of land reform, land-
lords in China have been required to return
25 per cent, of the rent collected since the
areas were liberated. Rents under the
Chiang Kai-shek regime were notoriously
high.... A large number of overseas
Chinese have been sending money back to
their families in China for years. Much of
this has been invested in land, from which,
in accordance with the ruling level of rents,
an extortionate return has been drawn.
Their families are now asking for the
money with which to make the repayment.
Quite simple—when looked at through
Red spectacles.
Presented with an address of loyalty
by New Australians from Estonia, Prim©
Minister Menzies told them that some
day a son or grandson of Estonians might
sit in his chair. It’s nothing to be dis-
turbed about. The chair has been
occupied by one of the Cymry people,
by the sons of Caledonians and Eireans —
and Dr. Evatt hasn’t yet given up hope.
The friendliness of those in or on the
fringe of the beer trade, which has been
a notable feature of the evidence before
the royal commission on liquor, was
again demonstrated before the Licensing
Court when transfer of the licence of
the Mortdale Hotel —licensee Mrs. Beryl
Frack, sister of and self-admitted dummy
for Abe Saffron—to Belus Bamford was
refused on the grounds that the court
did not regard him as a fit and proper
person to hold a licence. After explain-
ing that most of the money with which
he proposed to pay for the licence came
from gambling, that he never kept books
and did not have a banking account until
he decided to buy the hotel, Bamford
said that a cheque for £3021 which was
put through his account had nothing to
do with his own finances. He had done
it for a friend. Asked why the friend
wanted him to do this he replied “Pre-
sumably to avoid taxation,” and added
that “frankly” one of the reasons he had
held his own money in cash was that
he did not want the Taxation Department
to become interested in it.
A.B.C.’s attempt to kill Santa Claus
doesn’t seem to fit in with the ideas of
some of its speakers who opposed the
Commonwealth Government bill to ban
the Communists. They held firmly that
you can’t kill an idea.
McGrrrrr and Co. are trying to blame
Menzies for an alleged cut in loan-money
allocated for housing. Whom do they
blame for last year’s performance? In
the 12 months to June 30 there were
19,771 houses erected in New South
Wales; Victoria, with only two-thirds of
the population of the McGrrrrr State,
built 21,025.
Melbourne police carried their blitz on
private-car parking a bit too far when
they made a descent on Medical-street —
the upper end of Collins-street —and
booked dozens of doctors. The medicoes
were indignant, and one leading gynaeco-
logist related how he arrived 10 minutes
late at the operating-table and asserted
that if he had been delayed another couple
of minutes he would have been too late
to save either the mother or the baby.
The City Fathers’ answer is a proposed
by-law to make it obligatory on owners of
buildings to make their basements avail-
able as garages. Under present conditions
it would take about 10 years to make
this effective.
By an Arbitration Court order issued
last week it is illegal for a union to
insist that candidates for union offices
should belong to any particular political
party. G. V. Little, a member of the
Victorian branch of the Printing Industry
Employees’ Union, made the application
after he had been refused nomination
because he would not sign a declaration
that he was not “identified with any poli-
tical body opposed to the platform of
the Australian Labor party.” In declar-
ing the union-rule unlawful the court
said it “imposed an unreasonable restric-
tion on candidates.”
It was a teen-age session on a Sydney
radio-station, and the compere, by way of
a change from pop tunes, asked the
youngsters to name the Federal Minister
for Health. They were given a minute to
ponder on the answer, but no one seemed
in a hurry. At the fifty-ninth second one
brave soul took the plunge with “Mr,
Healy.”
Warren Bonython, of Adelaide, who
led a scientific expedition to Lake Eyre,
doesn’t think much of the often-advanced
theory that a canal connecting Spencer’s
Gulf with the lake would increase the
rainfall and improve climatic conditions
of the Dead Heart. His party found that
the presence of water in the usually dry
lake affected temperature and humidity
for only about a mile from the edge of
the lake. Evaporation is rapidly bring-
ing Lake Eyre back to its former con-
dition of arid salt-patch ; its 3000 square
miles of water have already shrunk to
500, and Bonython expects it to be
completely dry by March.
A little while ago the Victorian State
Electricity Commission asked the public
for the loan of £6,000,000 at 3i per cent.
It got only half the money. The other
day it asked for the loan of £3,000,000
at 4| per cent, and got the amount and
£1,900,000 more. Whereupon the chair-
man spoke delightedly about the “magni-
ficent people of Victoria,” “a tonic to
the loan market,” “a landmark in restor-
ing confidence,” and so forth, and up in
Brisbane the papers saw “new hope for
local-authority finances.” All that had
happened was that the lenders had been
offered another 12s. 6d. a year for the
hire of their hundred quid.

Credit and Re-employment
Effects of the Federal Gov-
ernment’s credit - restriction
policy continue to spread. Over-
extended industries are curtail-
ing production and putting off
staff, and retailers are still find-
ing buyer-resistance a consider-
able factor. Essential industries,
on the other hand, find it
much easier to pick up the staff
they have been requiring for
years.
A great deal will now depend
upon how soon the benefit of
manpower diversion will spread
to the coal and steel industries.
The McGirr “Labor” Govern-
ment in N. S. Wales will no
doubt do its utmost to prevent
the Federal Government’s plan
to counter inflation and stimu-
late essential production achiev-
ing its best results. State
“Labor” Governments at present
seem to be acting under direc-
tions from the big Communist-
dominated unions; but there
has been a change for the better
in control both of the Federated
Ironworkers and the Miners’
Federation. This has been
assisted by the operation of
the secret-ballot legislation in
respect of trade-union elections.
The textile trade has been ad-
versely affected by the change in
trading conditions; York-street
and Flinders-lane are feeling the
pinch. The drying-up of terms-
finance has also hit the motor
trade badly. Prompt delivery of
many makes of new English cars
is now offered in Sydney, and
the market for secondhand cars
has slumped. The real-estate
business has quietened a great
deal, and lack of finance has
slowed-up the building trade,
where housing loans were previ-
ously very liberal.
But, as in the case of any re-
verse in trade and financial con-
ditions, early effects are likely
to exaggerate the real position.
The policy of the Govern-
ment is to kill inflation and
increase essential production, not
to impede real industry. The
Bulletin is all in favor of some
determined action to end infla-
tion so long as it is wisely and
firmly administered.
Speaking at the annual meet-
ing of the Jason Investment
Company in Melbourne, Mr.
Staniforth Ricketson (of J. B.
Were and Son) said, in regard
to the Government’s policy;
As time goes on we are all hearing
more and more about the effects of
the so-called “credit squeeze.” Every
one of us has this question brought
to our notice daily, and, although
some of the reports and comments
are undoubtedly exaggerated, there is
sufficient evidence to conclude that
the Government’s policy in this regard
is bringing results. These effects are
being accentuated by the rigorous
limitations of new capital issues, and
also by the development of a more
cautious sentiment in , trade and
industry and, indeed, throughout the
whole community. The deduction to
be drawn from statements by Govern-
ment leaders is that these credit
restrictions were imposed with a three-
fold motive —(1) to compel trade and
industry to revise their plans and
methods; (2) to induce psychological
reactions which would operate to-
wards greater caution and efficiency
and a general reduction in spending;
and (3) to divert manpower and vital
materials into channels of the greatest
significance from the point of view of
defence and civilian maintenance....
In broad terms, these provisions
are designed primarily to ensure that
capital, manpower and vital materials
are diverted to essential industries and
services. Moreover, apart from this
selective control, the Government has
apparently also imposed rigid limits
on the total amount of capital which
can be raised in a given period by
trade and industry generally.
Unpleasant as are many of the
effects of Government policy, it seems
certain that the restrictions imposed
on credit and new capital issues will
be beneficial to the national economy
as a whole. They have already com-
pelled those in control of business and
industry to put on their considering-
caps, review their operations and
methods and, in particular, revise
their expansion plans. As a result
there are doubtless quite a few who
have concluded that the Government
has done them a good turn by prevent-
ing them from embarking on hastily-
designed programmes of development.
Many more may live to bless the day
when they were denied the right to
overextend their financial structures.
Already cases have arisen in which
companies which a few months ago
feil that a large amount of new capital
was required are now most relieved
because they were refused permission
to obtain it.
One important aspect of the
cumulative effects of all these controls
and factors relates to the employment
situation. Through the curtailment of
public-works plans initiated in anticipa-
tion of loan moneys being available,
and also because a number of com-
panies, have deemed it necessary or
prudent to shorten sail, the labor
position has entered a new phase.
This does not presage the return of
an era of pitiful unemployment;
rather could it be termed a period
of “re-employment.” No person with
humanitarian instincts could regard
with anything but abhorrence the
thought of even a moderate propor-
tion of the working population being
deprived of employment. We have,
I hope, advanced far beyond the stage
when such a condition of affairs
would be regarded as permissible or
even desirable from an economic point
of view.
A period of re-employment such
as that which now appears to be
developing is, however, a totally
different thing. It simply means the
transfer of labor from non-essential
activities, or at least from those which
have no special urgency, to industries
which are vital to national security
and development. This process has
already begun. Much as all must
deplore the discomforts and anxieties
to which displaced workers are tem-
porarily subjected, such re-employment
will obviously add greatly to their
permanence of employment and the
security of themselves and their
families.
The broad outline of the Gov-
ernment’s Budget and credit
policy is sound. Ministerial con-
trol of departments, however,
will need to be stronger than
hitherto. Some of our civil ser-
vants are still socialistically
minded, and they may not yet
be able to distinguish economic
necessity from Socialist doctrine.
The whole basis of Government
policy in this emergency should
be made to make private
industry strong by being firm
with it.
London Funds and Trade
Australia’s record trade deficit
of £166 million for the four
months to the end of October
was accompanied by a drop of
£133.8 million in the holding of
gold and balances abroad by the
Commonwealth Bank.
In the following six weeks, for
which no trade figures are yet
available, the fall in London
funds was greater still —£135.5
million. On December 12 they
stood at £450.2 million, com-
pared with £719.5 million on
June 27, which was about their
peak.
The drop in the six weeks to
December 12 could be the result
of still-heavier imports in rela-
tion to exports, or of a delayed
action in payment for the im-
ports of the previous period. Or,
again, it could be partly the
result of the withdrawal of over-
seas capital from Australia.
The Australian sharemarket
started to slump in the first half
of November, and that happens
to coincide with the beginning
of the heavy drain on London
funds. It also coincides, of
course, with the sudden contrac-
tion in general business activity
in Australia.
It has been suggested by some
sharemarket observers that the
projected denationalisation of
steel in Britain has resulted in
the return of some former steel
capital, temporarily invested in
8.H.P., to Britain. But any real
idea of the extent of capital
withdrawal from Australia will
not be gained until figures for
at least six months’ trading are
available.
Imports are still coming to
Australia at a high rate. The
waterfront is choked with them,
and so are the bonds and stores,
many people holding back from
paying for shipments as long as
possible. On the other hand,
wool shipments did not com-
mence in volume until the
second quarter of the financial
year. The fact that export values
were probably at a high rate
during the six weeks from
October 31 to December 12 sug-
gests that the heavy fall of
£135.5 million in our London
funds during that period was
partly due to an accelerated out-
flow of capital.
The contraction in our Lon-
don funds means an automatic
restriction of credit facilities in
Australia. But it also means an
automatic curbing of the desire
and means to import, so that a
self-correcting influence starts
to work. Imports that stay away
from Australian shores because
of external finance problems
mean a greater field for the Aus-
tralian manufacturer in the long
run. An expanding economy
like Australia’s must have its
supply of essential goods, and
local production will be in
greater demand if imported sup-
plies fall. Hence the urgent
need to divert manpower and
materials to really essential
purposes.
“Free” Sterling
Except that it gives the pri-
vate banks greater scope and
more direct dealings with their
customers, the move by the
Bank of England whereby those
using, or dealing in, foreign ex-
change may buy or sell sterling
“forward” within specified limits
means very little.
The limits set by the Bank of
England are (for U.S. dollars)
sellers $2.78, buyers $2.82. The
spot price is $2.80, and it will
have a strong regulating effect
on the forward price.
Usually a forward price which
differs considerably from the
spot price means that the spot
price is judged to be moving to-
wards the forward price; but in
the present case a fixed spot
price rules that market charac-
teristic out.
Sterling is still very much a
pegged currency, and, in view
of the difficult trading position
of Britain at the present time,
currency movements remain
likely to be subject to severe
controls. It has recently become
more difficult for Britons to take
a holiday abroad because of
currency controls.
Gold-sales Premium
On November 20 the Prime
Minister, Mr. Menzies,
announced that Australian gold-
producers would be permitted to
sell their current output of
newly-mined gold on open over-
seas markets, provided that such
sales were made for industrial
purposes and for payment in
United States dollars.
Dollar proceeds of the sales
would have to be sold to the
Commonwealth Bank at the
ruling rate of exchange. Previ-
ously the bank bought the gold
at the equivalent of the official
world price of 35 United State
dollars per fine ounce. (Actual!
it works out at £l5 10s. per fin-
ounce.)
On December 14 Mr. Menzies
elaborated on the premium-sales
scheme. It provided that the
present procedure whereby all
newly-mined gold must be de-
livered to the Commonwealth
Bank or to approved refiners and
payment accepted at the bank’s
official price must continue.
Gold for export would then
be made available for sale at the
bank’s official price only to an
association of producers, which
would arrange for the gold to
be processed into an industrial
form and then exported. The
association of producers to
handle the sales of gold had been
incorporated as Gold Producers’
Association, Ltd. Membership
would be open to all producers
in Australia and New Guinea.
The “industrial processing” of
the gold is being done to con-
form with the agreement reached
at the Bretton Woods confer-
ence. Some countries are re-
puted to be doing the processing
in a token form only—casting
fine gold in the shape of door-
knobs or something of the kind.
Though not as high as it was,
the open-market “premium”
over $35 an ounce is still con-
siderable.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Controls and Competition
There’s nothing Maoriland
traders would be more ready to
shoot at the moment than the
Price Tribunal, which has been
whipping up feeling in all direc-
tions since the spring and
summer slump made things hard
for business.
Traders had been led to ex-
pect decontrol of prices as com-
petition got into the saddle
again, but officialdom is still
pulling back on the reins,
although there has been a
buyer’s market in most lines of
consumer goods for months
past. This makes the cost-price
squeeze the worst it has ever
been, and a good deal of profit-
slimming has resulted.
Nothing nettles hard-pressed
traders more than to have to
wait weeks for price-control to
move after materials or wages
have advanced. This isn’t a new
complaint, but it’s a new experi-
ence to have to contend with
price-fixing and keen competi-
tion at the same time, while
buyers are on holiday and banks
are pushing to get overdrafts
down.
Retailers and manufacturers
are feeling the pinch, and are
all asking how much longer
price-control is going to be
allowed to put the screw on.
There was a lot of sales-pushing
before Christmas, and some
sacrificing of overstocked goods
at auction in the effort to get
out of the jam, but the public,
once again on the box-seat,
after years of scarcity and rising
prices, was unresponsive, except
when prices were cut to bargain
levels, and traders were left with
a loss.
Inertia has afflicted the ad-
ministrative machine like a
form of chronic paralysis,
strangely in contrast with the de-
clared policy of the Holland
Government to encourage free
enterprise. The truth is that
price-control is still dominated
by Socialist doctrines and teach-
ings, acquired in earlier years,
which run athwart the business
stream and are unworkable in a
world of changing costs and
prices.
No one knows how much
longer trade will continue to be
held in a straitjacket, but things
seem to be shaping for a show-
down. Last autumn’s crisis on
Maoriland’s waterfront can be
credited with contributing to the
trouble, because it gave inflation
an extra lease of life, boosted
costs and struck a blow at
spending-power.
A. M. Seaman, chairman of
Reid Rubber, one of New Zea-
land’s three millionaire tyre-
manufacturing plants, said a
week before Christmas: “There
can be no doubt that the direct
and indirect losses arising from
the strike have caused a sub-
stantial reduction in the buying-
power of the community, and
the effect is still being felt by
trading organisations.” There’s
not the easy money around that
there was. In the long run this
will be a good thing, but at this
stage New Zealand, like Aus-
tralia, though not to the same
extent, is in the throes of a
difficult adjustment.
N.Z. Forest Products
New Zealand’s young forestry
giant, N.Z. Forest Products,
Ltd., has passed the 100 million
super.-feet mark for yearly log-
ging output, and should double
the figure in the next few years
as new mills lift capacity. It’s
now a long way ahead of the
peak for any other concern on
either side of the Tasman, and,
without any rival in its field, it
is its own pacemaker.
The growth of the trees and
demands for timber, pulp and
paper products on all sides are
incentives enough to keep it on
its toes. Chairman David Henry
told shareholders at the annual
meeting in Auckland that the
co. could supply all the
timber needed to build homes
in New Zealand, and all it
asked for was reasonable
support and encouragement
from the Government, by fairer
price-control and tax relief.
There was something wrong
when Maoriland, with all this
material within arm’s reach, was
importing plywood, building
board and prefabricated houses.
Said Henry: Importation of
building materials at premium
prices was justified only as a
stop-gap policy, to make up the
deficiency in output of New
Zealand manufacturing plants.
This policy of relying on out-
side suppliers for materials tern-
porarily short could become a
menace to full employment of
manpower and resources. The
State should take active steps to
help concerns with abundant
supplies of raw material to
expand to the utmost.
Until lately forestry has been
a glaring instance of an industry
held back when it should be
pushed ahead, and the brakes
haven’t been fully released yet,
although the present Govern-
ment is more sympathetic than
its Socialistic predecessor. What
with price-control still in force
for the whole range of the pro-
ducts from N.Z. forests, and
income tax bleeding Forest
Products, Ltd., to the tune of
£158,000 annually on the latest
basis (net profit £167,027), while
shareholders are still waiting for
their first divs., there’s plenty of
room for improvement in
national vision.
If the co. could sell locally
for prices approaching those it
gets for the small proportion of
its output it’s able to export, it
would be doing well, but local
users get the benefit. Profits are
still going to pad reserves, which
are now holding £702,316 of
earnings accumulated over eight
years, and the directors look on
the rise in the shares over the
past twelvemonth to nearly
double their late 1950 value as
endorsement of this policy for
the duration of the “establish-
ment stage.”
Since New Zealand stretched
its wool subsidy last season to
absorb the shock of boom
prices, the cost on taxpayers has
settled back to £3.3 million
annually, on a basis of 60d. a
pound for wool, and woollen-
manufacturing cos. are thank-
ing their lucky stars that they
weren’t hurt by the tidal-wave.
What Maorilanders pay in
subsidy they escape as con-
sumers, and they like the subsidy
because of its steadying influ-
ence. But for this clothing,
blankets and other woollens
would have been so dear in 1951
that many Maorilanders would
have been frightened off buying,
and mills would have been hit
by the boomerang. As it was,
all cos. did well, and some
netted peak profits. James W.
Tattersfield, of Auckland, a
veteran in the industry, said
“violent fluctuations in wool
prices” were the “worst possible
thing” that could happen all
round, with the added risk to-
day of helping synthetic substi-
tutes. The cos. don’t expect
profits to regain the peak in the
current prosperity cycle, now
very much on the wane. Buyer-
resistance has sharpened the
edge of competition, while cos.
have to reckon with restricted
bank credit, capital-issues con-
trol and, if they want to re-
place or increase plant or extend
premises, inflated capital costs.
As most woollen cos. have
known ups and downs in the
past, they’re inclined to mark-
time for a while until costs come
down, and are planning to con-
solidate in 1952.

“Bo”: I have received the usual Christ-
mas greetings, in verse, from the Garbage
Man. I will pass over its general literary
merits except to quote one noble stanza:
For service is his watchword
As he goes with vim and glee
To assist the clean-up movement
Which keeps our race healthy.
Now, there is something in the highest
realms of poesy which must ever strike
a responsive chord in us. I have there-
fore considered it would be mixing poetic
justice with my natural leaning to philan-
thropy to refrain from leaving on the
can at his next call the couple of packets
of cigarettes or the bottle of the best for
which he is, with supreme optimism,
hoping. Instead he will find tied neatly
to what is left of the handle of what is
left of the lid of what is left of the
garbage-can the following equally noble
poem:
You scangy cow! Of all the blasted hide!
To try and bum a gift this Christmas-tide,
When every week during the year just gone
You’ve concertina’d, bashed and jumped
upon
The garbage-can for which I paid a quid,
And rendered quite unfittable the lid.
Remember, too, that early morning when
1 lugged the can round to the front, and
then
With brazen arrogance you wouldn’t slop,
But grinned and sang out: “Take it next
week. Pop”?
And now you want to put the nips in—
well,
May I suggest that you can hop to hell.

“Ex-gunner”: I was not at all sur-
prised when the cables told of a plane
and 33 passengers being lost for two
hours after landing at London airport in
dense fog. I remember an army convoy
4V| A
“He’s laying a foundation-stone tomorrow."
of eight guns and a score of trucks being
lost on a New Guinea airfield —and
there was no fog, either. We were return-
ing to Moresby after a practice shoot at
Boera village, and it was getting towards
evening when our convoy struck Ward’s
’drome. Following our leader, we moved
smartly across the strip and along a bush
track. The truck I was in was about half-
way back in the column and we weren’t
taking much notice of the scenery until
someone pointed out that we were
approaching the ’drome again. We
weren’t much concerned —when a junior
lieutenant is leadings convoy there’s no
telling what route it will take —but when,
a quarter of an hour later, we hit the
’drome a third time we felt it .was get-
ting past a joke. Just at that moment the
b.s.m. dashed past on his motor-bike;
he reached the head of the column just as
the leading truck was about to take the
wrong turning for the fourth time. He
really deserved a decoration ; if it hadn’t
been for him we’d still be trying to get
away from Ward’s ’drome.

“Billy S.”: When the boss told us that
the office would be open on Christmas
Eve but closed on New Year’s Eve there
was much discussion, as many of the staff
would have preferred Christmas Eve as
a further day of rest or what-have-you.
One who didn’t object was the office
cadet —in these days of staff shortages
there are no office-boys. He proclaimed
himself well pleased because, if the office
shut down on Christmas Eve, he would
“miss out on his Christmas shopping.”

“Clooter”: The female mind being
what it is, I’m not astonished to read that
a psychologist considers that fashionable
colors can create mental tension in some
women. The gentleman suggests that
women “who have not led spotless lives”
may be dreadfully upset if fashion decrees
white frocks, his theory being that even
the gayest of the dears has not yet
escaped from tradition and religious
customs of dead ages. His theory that
fat and uncomely women detest red
because it attracts attention seems fair
enough as a theory, but he should have
asked himself how many fat and
uncomely women are shrinking violets.
What really stirs me is the man’s courage
in trespassing on territory where few
men would be game to go—for the plain
and simple truth is that every woman
worth her salt knows what colors suit or
don’t suit her, and fashion can decree
itself black in the face before she’ll wear
a color that doesn’t suit.

“Villefair”: It is to be hoped most
sincerely that Australian songwriters take
heed of the advice given by one Geraldo,
who, my daily tells me, is a “famous
British bandleader” and was judge in the
A.B.C. Jubilee Song Contest. Quoting
Mr. G.: “Not one of the songs is likely
to be a world hit. The lyrics are par-
ticularly bad,” Not being an authority
on popular music and not having heard
the winning songs, I’m in no position to
question the opinions of the expert. And
I can certainly see his point as regards
Australian lyrics. Still, one day a genius
may arise in Australia who will really
“wow” ’em on the Hit Parade with the
kind of lyrics the Big Time songwriters
can achieve. Who knows—he might even
produce another “Rag Mop,” “Shotgun
Boogie” or “You Wuz”!
“Bosun’s Mate”; Reported in Sydney
dailies that a crewman of a Sydney-
Hobart yacht-race entrant claimed she
had met an 80 m.p.h. wind off Wilson’s
Promontory en route from Adelaide.
Both Press-boys and enthusiastic yachts-
men have misconceptions on the force of
ocean winds. My seamanship-manual
(Royal Navy) gives a gale-force blow as
34-47 knots ; a storm as 48-65 knots ; and.
“Where Was the bushfire?"
above 65, a hurricane. So what sort of
a walloper that 52ft. schooner rode out,
at 80 m.p.h., defies imagination—and ex-
perience.

Henry G. Lamond: “Warenda took in
more than 600 square miles” (B.
5/12/’51)? When I sat behind the
cheque-book on that station it had an
area more like 5000 square miles. That
was in 1913, and the exact figure was
491*0, of which a quarter was due for
resumption. That would leave about
3600 square miles. Six hundred square
miles wouldn’t be a station in that
country: it would only be a horse-
paddock. Warenda was the station from
which Kidman was supposed to have
done his record lift and great droving
feat —shifted all the cattle within a stipu-
lated time. I know, and I speak from
experience, that Kidman didn’t shift them
in twice the time allowed ; he got many
concessions which were not in the sale
contract.

“Den”: Australians cannot claim to be
“unchallengeably the world’s greatest tea

tea-drinking nations. Britain and Ireland

“Harold Hardupp”; An ancient who
has closed his book on the 86th chapter
was a lamplighter in his younger days;
he must have been the last of the members
of what was once an important muni-
cipal calling. Although he must have
shared the bitterness of his cult to the
coming of electric lighting, he passed
over to the enemy and had a long and
honorable life in its service. The old
chap remembered a protest meeting the
lamplighters of Sydney held in Belmore
Park, when the Redfern Council decided
to electric-light its thoroughfares. The
derision about the new 1 idea at the lamp-
lighters’ meeting was justified by the many
sudden blackouts when power failed in
the early experimental days. A notice
erected by the Redfern Council at street-
corners read like a part of the derision.
It ran: “All vehicles must carry lights
when darkness commences. Darkness
commences when the street-lamps are
lighted.”

“Kal”; One gets used to the radio-
play convention whereby a few bars of
music are played to denote the passage
of time; but it doesn’t always work. In
a recent show the story dealt with a
really nasty character who had killed
someone and was endeavoring to do the
same again, but came to a sticky finish by
falling off a,cliff while being chased by
one who sought revenge. A brief snatch
of music followed his falling-off, then the
action was resumed, with these words,
uttered by one of the surviving char-
acters: “Let’s go into the living-room.”

“Spokeshave”: Some bright boy on
Melbourne “Herald” offered that paper’s
readers the trickiest headline of the year.
The news-item was a dispatch from
Miami, Florida, stating that a chemist
and his wife laughed so much at a police-
man who was trying to entice a monkey
from a tree by dancing round it with a
bunch of bananas that they didn’t notice
that their two-year-old son had sat on
an ant’s-nest. Junior’s screams were
quenched when his father ducked him in
a tub of water just as the house caught
fire when a pan of grease that had been
left on the stove boiled over. Just
when the fire had been put out
by Father, another of his kids
opened the door of a washing-machine
and flooded the dwelling. The headline
was “Odtaa,” which is the title of a novel
by Masefield. Its plot was set in a South
American State where one damned thing
after another happened.

“Wusslean”: Regulars on our local bus
know that the rule about smoking being
strictly prohibited is disregarded by
passengers and drivers alike. The lady
on the 8.15 last Thursday was a stranger,
and when, after
pausing to allow
some of the
occupants to
alight, the driver
rolled a cigarette,
she pointed to the
“No Smoking”
notice and asked,
in a tone of mild
rebuke: “Does
this notice mean
anything?” “Well,
m a ’ a m,” h e
replied, “I’d say
it means about as much as that one.”
The card he indicated with a thrust of
the thumb over his shoulder read:
“Passengers must not converse with the

“Waddlin’ Willie”: So the R.A.A.F. is
saying goodbye to the old Tiger Moth.
S’pose you can’t stop progress, but the
memory of these faithful fuUy-aerobatic
De Havilland kites will live on in the
minds of the war-time airmen who
learned to fly in them. One such, a pal
of mine, used to drop his letters of love
to a squatter’s daughter, coming down
just over the homestead to wave a greet-
ing as he dropped his mail. The lass
loved it, but she also loved to talk to the
neighbors, and one day she proudly told
a family friend of her airman friend who
came down “real low” to drop his letters.
The neighbor was not impressed. An old
airman from the A.F.C., he had donned
uniform for- the second time and,
unknown to the girl, was the boy-friend’s
C.O. The boy-friend copped a month's
orderly-officer duties, and all his subse-
quent mail went via the P.M.G. Another
airman, now a grouper with a chest-full
of gongs gained in the Battle of Britain,
was flying so low one day that one of
his lady-love’s fowls, perched in a
peppercorn-tree, got mixed up in the old
Tiger’s struts. He staged a forced landing,
discarded the dead bird, flew back to
base and shut up. Then there were the
two old Geelong Grammarians who de-
cided to “burn-up” their old school.
They came so close to the deck that the
boys playing football had to run for
shelter. The headmaster rang the C. 0.,
and these boys were grounded—in a
military prison for three months. Both
made amends and were decorated in the
Pacific.

“Emm”: The way they do things in
Melbourne. Man parks his car outside
hotel in Lonsdale-street, and, after care-
fully locking it, goes in to dinner, leaving
a case on the back-seat. This looks
interesting to a bystander, so, in broad
daylight, he cuts the canvas hood of car,
unloads case —it contains whisky—and
hails passing taxi. Taxi-driver is
suspicious and answers: “You don’t get
me into this,” and, unlike the good
Samaritan, he keeps going. Well, that’s
the tale the taxi-man told.
A NEW YEAR’S LITANY.
Dear Reader, may the New Year be
A better one for You and Me,
For none deserves it more than We.
And let us not by name condemn
Tom, Dick or Harry, Jim or Clem,
But hope it won’t be good for Them.
For They drove cars, and They lived high,
And filled themselves with pork and pie.
While We were standing hungry by.
They toiled not, neither did They spin.
But gathered the same income in
As We, work-worn to bone and skin.
Their jig is up. Their ship’s a wreck,
And in the New Year, We expeck
That They will get it in the neck.
But let us pray to Fortune, thus:
“Please, this time, be fastidious —
Distinguish between Them and Us!”
And, Reader, may the New Year be
A better one for You and Me,
For none deserves it more than We.

“F.S.”: The King is reported to be
lending the greatest treasures of the Royal
collection —the Leonardo drawings —for
exhibition at the R.A. next year, 1952
being the fifth centenary of one of the
most remarkable men who ever lived.
Leonardo was the supreme example
of the Renaissance artist. In those
days artists weren’t specialists as
they are now. A complete list of Leon-
ardo’s accomplishments would fill a couple
of pages of Who’s Who. He was not
only a painter, sculptor and architect,
but a first-class engineer who produced
plans for the canalisation of the Amo;
in the year that he began the famous
“Last Supper” he made plans for a com-
plete system of irrigation and waterways
for the whole Lombard plain, and he
designed an aeroplane which would have
flown if it had had a petrol-engine,
anticipated steam in designs for paddle-
wheels, even made drawings of breech-
loader cannon, originated the science
of hydraulics, and discovered the camera
obscura and the molecular structure of
water. As a writer he helped to mould
Italian prose, he was a musician and com-
"With these dreadful prices we'd never manage if we didn't visit
friends for dinner."
poser, and wrote scientific notebooks
which, if they had been published, would
have saved subsequent scientists centuries
of labor. He was also a philosopher,
mathematician, geographer, cartographer
and theorist on art whom modern theorists
haven’t yet caught up on. He designed
a submarine but gave an example to the
atom scientists by burning the plans be-
cause he thought human beings were too
barbarous to have in their hands such
an engine of destruction. He died at 67
bitterly lamenting his lazy habits.
* * * *
“C.A.L.”: A special feature of the
new diesel Trans trains is the coach-
springing, which ensures a smooth ride
over the roughest of rail-beds, even at
speed. Rather a change from the con-
verted cattle-trucks in which many of
us did the same trip in the war years. On
one Nullarbor crossing we had in our
wagon a real moaner, and for two days
and nights as the train rocked and swayed
on its way westward his howls and com-
plaints were unceasing. Kalgoorlie
reached, the O.C. train asked members
of the draft how they had fared on the
journey, and among those quizzed was
our wingeing travelling companion. “It
wouldn’t have been so bad,” he reported,
“if the wheels had hit the rails every foot,
but when the whole bogie used to make
leaps of three feet in the air I got to
thinking we were airborne.”
* * * *
“Doric”: We all have our pet aver-
sions among picture-show audiences. My
list is particularly long—there is the
sniffler, the man with a hollow tooth, the
snorer, the arm-rest hog, the fat woman
in the next seat who overflows into yours,
the flapper who keeps saying, “Oo —isn’t
he gorgeous! ”, the woman who has seen
it before, the seat-kicker, the loving
couple in front who will put their heads
together, the deep - breather, the
cellophane-rattler and the potato-crisp
eater. But a new horror has arisen. I
refer to the New Australian who brings
a friend along to interpret for him!

“Croid”: How long is “temporary”?
Happening to be at the comer of Bridge-
ami Phillip-streets, Sydney, I recalled the
fuss that arose when the corrugated-iron
Government building was first erected
there. The excuse was that it was only
a temporary structure, but the little seed-
lings planted outside, presumably to hide
the monstrosity, have now become tall
gum-trees. I suppose eventually, when
the time comes to pull the place down,
there will be another uproar because of
its historical value. The irony of the
matter is that the building houses the
Government Architect.

“Pontius Penwiper”: The story about
the Spanish gosler (which is the correct
name for a goose-breeder or -tender) who
killed a goose which laid eggs containing
gold coins (B. 5/12/’5l) recalls a N.S.W.
sensation of 20 years ago when gold
was found in the crops of fowls killed
and sent to market. The breeder of the
fowls received an offer for his poultry-
run on the day that the news of
the incident appeared ; he turned it down,
but later came at a really high offer.
Gold was later found in the crops of
fowls on other runs; at least three
changed hands at high—in short, gold-
mine—prices. There was a lot of digging
on the various poultry-runs, but no find
of gold was reported. The painful con-
clusion was reached that some smart Alec
had “salted” the crops of the poultry.

“M.G.S.”: Modern artists seem to me
to be making a merit of incompetence,
judging by their pictures and by what
they say about them. A Melbourne critic
recently said of an exhibition “Rough-
hewn genius,” and when I read it I
couldn’t help thinking of my grandson,
aged eight, who made a box all by him-
self, using my tools. Everybody praised
it, and so they should have—it was a re-
markable achievement for a boy of eight,
Judging by what the critics say about
modern painting, however, if he sent it
to an exhibition and put it up alongside
a beautiful piece of furniture the critics
would say: “How beautiful it is! It’s
all crooked. Look at those joints —none
of them fit. It looks as if it would fall
to pieces if you touched it. A touch of
genius! ”

“Percy Pawnticket” on a Christmas
mystery:
Conscious of a habitual inclination to mislay
himself on festive occasions, my friend Potts
set out for town last Christmas Eve determined
to keep sober and meet his wife in the after-
noon. They were to go to his brother’s home
"Is me hat on straight, love?"
at Castle Hill, having decided on that in prefer-
ence to the home of his other brother at
Cronulla, who also wanted to have them. But,
of course, there was the usual meeting withhold
friends who knew where they could go for “just
one drink”; after that there was the pal who
had a bottle of Scotch in his case and led the
way into a soft-drink bar, where drinks that
could be fortified were ordered. After the
fourth or fifth of these concoctions life became
fuzzy, though splendid; then Potts woke up with
a sense of shock to find that he was, in fact,
in his brother’s home at Cronulla; he didn’t
know whether the day was Tuesday or the
year after last, but he had an awful conscious-
ness of having missed the appointment with his
wife and family and come to the wrong address.
His brother entered, zipped up the blind, reveal-
ing broad morning sunshine, and brought him
a drink with the remark that that would fix
him up for the feast, which was about due, and
a further one that “You seemed tired, so we
let you sleep on while we had a swim.” The
arrival, quite happy, unresentful and wet from
the surf, of his wife, with the kids and several
other people, including the Castle Hill brother,
filled him with a dazed feeling of unreality: he
could remember nothing of what had happened
after the laced drinks. An uncomfortable feel-
ing that he would wake up to a bitter reality
hung over him until he heard his wife boasting
joyfully, “This is the best Christmas I’ve had
for years. John usually gets blind on Christmas
Eve, but this time he met me right on time,
he was bright and lively at Castle Hill, and
look how well he was able to manage the car
when we all decided to come to Cronulla!
The darling has learnt sense at last.” Potts
still wonders how he managed it. He thinks
there must have been magic in that whisky.

“Sing 9”: A Sydney Beak, clapping a
fine on a motorist for some breach or
other, remarked “Pedestrians had use of
the road thousands of years before
motor-cars were thought of.” This sort
of thing is not only historically
inaccurate: it could lead to a lot of people
imagining that roads are built to walk on.
Roads were built in the first place for
the use of wheeled vehicles —had they
never been invented the world’s thorough-
fares would still consist of packhorse-
and camel-tracks. The modern road is
built for the motor-vehicle, and it is
motorists, not pedestrians, who are taxed
to pay for them. This doesn’t mean that
pedestrians haven’t the right to cross or
walk along roads on foot, but the
magistrate’s remark suggests that cars
have no business on them at all. In 20-
odd years of motoring I’ve found the
pedestrian generally ignores safety-rules
far more than the motorist.

“Pat”: Sydney Town was deserted, as
it usually is on Saturday afternoons, and
the five youths had plenty of pavement-
room for their game of kicking the square
of wood. It was a singles-match; first
man to kick it past the pub at the Quay
took the kitty. I was at their heels all the
way down Pitt-street and can vouch for
their absorbed interest in the sport.
Down at the Quay the spotty redhead
who h£d collected the stake demanded, in
high-pitched grievance, “What are we
gonner do now? There’s over an hour
to kill.” The adenoidal youth with the
lairy tie came to the rescue. “How about
a doubles-match back as far as Market-
street? Monty can score.” The sugges-
tion was unanimously popular, and off
they went.

“Tarry Rope”: “Born within sound of
Bow Bells” used to be the boast of the
man who claimed to be a Cockney;
“bred in the Bowery” was the claim of
the man fond of belonging to little old
Noo Yahk. Every city had some centre
which double-branded as a citizen the
person born there. With the old-time
Sydneyite it used to be “born and bred
in the ’Loo.” When a prosperous-looking
neighbor at the cricket-match gave him-
self that certificate of citizenship he
admitted that he had not seen the ’Loo
recently, and was advised to have another
look at it before making the boast again.
There is now no more alien-looking
quarter of Sydney than the place once
regarded as typical of the Sydneian.

“Edx”: Not owning a car, I didn’t
appreciate the magnitude of Melbourne’s
parking problem until, on my way into
town in the tram, X saw a car-owner
acquaintance from an outer suburb
apparently walking to work. As I was
running late myself I got off the tram
and walked with him. “Car not work-
ing?” I asked. “Oh, yes,” he replied,
“I’ve just parked it. Got a good possie,
too, nearly half-way in. That’s the best
I’ve done for weeks.”

“Ymar”: Australian barrackers have
a reputation for hurling abuse at an
unsatisfactory umpire and on occasion
even roughly handling him ; but by way of
Scotland (in the “Glasgow Weekly
News”) comes the story of two foot-
ballers who rolled the referee in the mud
and then chased him off the field when
they disagreed with his decision. And
this was in a women’s football-match in
Sydney!

“PipTok”: “Pig Bites Man!” Is that
news? The Westralian Royal Agricul-
tural Society has been faced with the
problem of deciding who pays the com-
pensation when a pig bites one of the
show judges. It happened at a country
show; medical attention and further
treatment were necessary, and the show
people sent the Mil to the insurance
company which had issued a public-risk
policy. The company denied liability
because the judge, in terms of the policy,
was not a member of the public.
Further, he was not a paid employee of
the agricultural society, and, therefore,
was not entitled to workers’ compensa-
tion. Appropriately, the show at which
the headache - provoking incident
occurred was held at Donnybrook.

“Ek D.”: In speaking politely of their
masters as “Sir” (B, 5/12/’5l), N. S.
Wales school-youngsters are following
very ancient usage which has been kept
up mainly in regimental military schools.
It probably derives f r om the old English
habit of designating degree-holders in
arts in some ancient colleges as “Sirs,” a
translation of the Latin word dominus,
master. This custom also applied to the
clergy until the prefix “reverend” became
fashionable. The “Sir” lingers in some
universities where it is still custom to
enter members on the rolls as “Sir Jones,”
i.e., “Dominus or Master Jones.” In
these entries the Christian-name is never
used.
“Loulalo”: Twelve years ago, when
my young son entered the prep, school
of a Victorian public school, I encoun-
tered the use of the third-person “Sir.”
The head was “Sir,” the lesser lights
“Sir Smith,” “Sir Jones,” etc. My first
reaction was one of amusement, and
when I met the head I said as much. He,
looking down his nose at my inadequate
education, told me that the idea was to
keep the young mind from becoming
confused by giving too many persons too
many names. The idea seems to have
spread ; my youngest daughter, attending
a tiny one-teacher State school in the
Victorian outback, uses the “feir” idiom.
AN OLD FALLACY.
"The large, heavy-voiced woman is usually por-
trayed as the shrewish, dominating type on stage
and screen. This is contrary to real life, in which
the large woman is more often motherly and bene-
volent and mostly good-humored. It is the small,
thin one who is the virago.” —From a broadcast talk.
The woman built on comfortable lines,
Above the normal weight by several stone,
Possessor of a voice that one inclines
To classify as heavy baritone—
That-Voice she’d never use to roar
Whene’er her spouse came in the door
Seeking his own to get above;
She’ll modulate it, you will find,
Until it’s almost of a kind
With that used by the amorous dove.
What though her mate be skinny, small and
meek,
A typical apologetic cove,
He never need be bluffed by her physique;
He can defy her if he wants to rove.
For years he may have been deceived,
Having erroneously believed
Her bulk inexorably meant
That had he spoken out of turn
There would have fallen on him stern
And rather painful punishment.
But, on the other hand, you take the wife
Who barely tips the beam at seven stone;
She’s not afraid to start domestic strife,
And in a shindy more than holds her own.
She very wisely will eschew
Close-quarter fray. Yet she’ll subdue
Her better half, you may be sure.
In these two assets she’ll rejoice:
Determined will and piercing voice—
A solid victory they’ll secure.
Why, then, do those whose job it is to cast
For plays, whether of film or on the stage,
Use outsize women when they want a blast
Of virulent and matriarchal rage?
Perhaps tradition pins it down
That beef must go with beetling frown,
Or else a danger there may be
Viragos of the other sort
May raise from audiences a snort
Of anger and perplexity.
Yet who could claim, with any certitude,
Xantippe, who gave poor old Socrates
The kitchen-rounds, was of much amplitude.
Bulging beneath her O.S. milanese?
And Kate, Will Shakspeare’s classic shrew—
That she’d have gone some two-feet through
I’m very much inclined to doubt.
In fact, most evidence will support,
She, too, was of the scrawny sort,
Yet managed weight to throw about!

The Letters of Rachel Henning
Mount Vernon,
December 1, 1872.
My Dearest Etta,
Now I suppose you will like
to hear about the wedding, that
great event having come off on
the 26th of November. I came
up from Wollongong, and Amy
from Bathurst to be present at
the ceremony. Neither Mr.
Taylor nor Mr. Sloman could
come. The 26th turned out a
beautiful day contrary to our
fears and expectations, for it had
been cloudy and rainy for some
time before.
We were very busy all the
morning packing Biddulph’s
things and getting all ready, and
at last he drove us into Sydney
in the buggy—that is, Annie,
Mr. Hedgeland, “Little Teddy”
and myself. Biddulph went off
to join his “best man,” and we
proceeded to Amy’s lodgings,
where we found her ready
dressed and “Little Annie” also
waiting for us. She had some
views of taking the nurse and
baby to the wedding, but this
we providentially overruled.
Mr. Hedgeland had ordered a
close carriage, and we all—that
is, Annie, Amy, “Little Annie,”
Mr. Hedgeland and I—drove
down to the Circular Quay and
crossed, carriage and all, in the
Transit, a large steamer that
takes vehicles over to the North
Shore. Biddulph was in the
same boat in a carriage with a
pair of grey horses.
We drove straight to the
church* where the James
Tuckers, Hirsts,t Thorntons,t
etc., were also assembled. It
was the first wedding at the new
church, and the building was
dressed with flowers for the
occasion, the altar with white
lilies alone, and very pretty it
looked.
The church was quite full of
spectators, but the choristers’
stalls were reserved for the
guests, so we were close to the
communion rails. The brides-
maids were ranged by the door
waiting for the bride, and I
ne ver saw a handsomer set of
girls. There was not one who
was not above the average in
appearance, while four at least
are extremely handsome,
There were eight of them,
Fanny Tucker (Emily’s sister),
three James Tuckers, three
Hirsts and Constance Sloman.
They were dressed in clouds of
tarletan, with ribbons of the
new sea-green, and tulle veils in
their hair and bouquets of
double scarlet pomegranate and
white jessamine.
Biddulph came up to the rails
soon after we took our places
with Mr. Walker, who was his
best man. He looked so well
and was not at all nervous.
Then the bride came in with her
father. She was magnificently
dressed in white satin trimmed
with Maltese lace and wreaths
of clematis, a wreath of clematis
and orange-blossom and a tulle
veil. She is a tall, stately-
looking girl and looked
extremely well,
There were two clergymen,
who gave us the benefit of the
whole service. Everybody be-
haved very well. There was no
crying, and the responses were
distinctly audible. When we
went into the vestry afterwards
the clergyman of the new church
presented Biddulph and Emily
with a Bible and prayer-book,
theirs being the first wedding
there. Then we all drove down
to Clifton, Mr. W. Tucker’s
place, where we found Mr. and
Mrs. Henning standing in the
large drawing-room and looking
very happy and comfortable,
There was no sitting-down
breakfast, but sandwiches, ices,
etc., handed round, and un-
limited champagne. They had
invited no one beyond the
respective families, but these
made a very large party, and
very well dressed,
Mrs. W. Tucker, Emily’s
mother, wore a beautiful violet
moire and violet-and-white
bonnet. Aunt Emily a sort of
pearl-grey silk with white bonnet
and pink roses. Annie wore a
white-and-mauve dress trimmed
with mauve silk ruchings and a
white bonnet with feathers
tipped with mauve. Amy a
stone-colored silk trimmed with
fringe of another shade and a
white bonnet with pink flowers.
I a sort of thin mohair of the
lightest grey all but white
trimmed with green satin and a
white bonnet trimmed with
green and white.
Curiously enough, there was
no blue costume in the whole
party except Teddy’s dress,
which was blue poplin with one
of the new broad sailor’s hats
with a blue ribbon.
Annie Sloman went with us
to the wedding, but was not one
of the bridesmaids. She looked
very nice in white book-muslin
with any amount of frills and
pink ribbons in her hair; but
perhaps you have had enough
of millinery! About four
o’clock Emily went up to change
her dress, and came down in a
grey Japanese silk trimmed with
satin of a darker shade and a
hat trimmed with blue. The
carriage came to the door, and
off they went amid a shower of
white shoes and cheers from the
gentlemen.
They drove to the station and
took the train for Bowral, a
place among the hills near
Picton. We heard from Bid-
dulph yesterday. He said they
were very well and very happy.
We left soon after the bride
and bridegroom, drove back to
Amy’s lodgings, where we left
her, and then Mr. Hedgeland,
Annie, Teddy and myself
returned in the buggy to Mt.
Vernon, all very tired and glad
to go to bed early.
There was a dance at Clifton
for the young people, and Annie
and Constance Sloman stayed
for it under the care of Aunt
Emily; she is a sort of general
aunt to all the rising generation
out here. She went over to
Clifton the first thing in the
morning to dress the brides-
maids, and very well she did it,
too.
I only came up for a fort-
night, as Mr. Taylor could not
accompany me, and we neither
of us like being apart. Igo
home on Wednesday by the
steamer, and as soon as I get
back I expect we shall begin
building. The new house ought
to be up in about three months,
and I hope it will be a very
pretty and comfortable one.
I wish you could come out
and see us all in our new habi-
tations. I suppose you and your
children are all looking forward
to the Christmas holidays now.
It seems quite strange to us now
to associate Christmas with cold
and frost and snow. Here it
brings the idea of intense heat,
and we are always glad when it
is over.
Believe me, my dearest Etta,
your very affectionate sister,
Rachel Taylor.
p.S. I forgot to say that Bid-
dulph bought a very handsome
family Bible partly with the
money you so kindly sent him.
He was well off for presents. A
dinner - service, three plated
salvers of three sizes, a silver
kettle, teapot, two plated butter-
dishes, eggstand, pair of small
breakfast cruet-stands, silver
napkin-rings, fish-rings, were
among the principal. He gave
broaches or earrings to all the
bridesmaids and a magnificent
broach to Emily as a wedding-
present.
“Springfield,”
Wollongong,
N. S. Wales,
June 11, 1 873.
My Dearest Etta,
Now I must tell you about
our visit to Sydney, Biddulph
and Annie both asked us to stay
with them, so we went to Linton
first and paid our first visit to
Biddulph and Emily in their new
home, Biddulph seems exceed-
ingly happy and fond of his wife,
and, though he had a bad cold
when we were there, and was
generally obliged to go indoors
as soon as he returned from the
town instead of taking a drive,
or gardening (as he likes to do),
he was always cheerful and full
of fun. He reminds me more
and more of what I remember
of our father in his home ways.
Emily certainly has drawn a
prize, and I think she knows it,
for she is wrapt up in her
husband. She is a most kind
and pleasant hostess, and has
everything in her house in such
beautiful order. You seldom
find in Australia or even
England a house so thoroughly
furnished and appointed as
Linton is. They have two good
indoor servants and a man who
gardens and looks after the horse
and carriage. The garden is
new-looking at present, but both
Emily and Biddulph are so fond
of gardening that they will soon
improve it.
While we were there we drove
out to Baptist’s nursery and
ordered a quantity of pines and
cypresses and other shelter trees.
Biddulph also has bought about
half an acre of land adjoining
to enlarge his garden, and a
most picturesque bit it is, with
masses of grey rock and groups
of gum-trees. When it is planted
and laid out it will be beautiful.
I envy them the rocks. We have
none here.
We spent a pleasant week at
Linton, and then Mr. Taylor
left me and went to Milleewah
for one night and thence home,
as he did not like to leave his
beloved farm any longer. I
remained a few days longer at
Linton, and then went on to stay
with Annie and Mr. Hedgeland.
I went by train to Ashfield,
which is about twenty minutes’
journey from Sydney. Annie
and Teddy met me at the station,
and a quarter of an hour’s easy
walk brought us to Milleewah,
which, in spite of its outlandish
name, is a charming place. It
took my fancy exceedingly.
It is a large old-fashioned
house with large lofty rooms,
windows down to the ground
and a wide veranda on three
sides, and it stands in about
forty acres of bushland, sur-
rounded by fine old trees, so
that though it is so near Sydney
it is as much in the country as
we are. There are fields all
round, or, as we call them here,
“paddocks.” There is a flower-
garden in front of the house and
stabling, etc., at the back. The
house is so large that they do
not occupy more than half the
rooms, and Teddy makes rail-
ways and builds Exhibition
buildings in the empty ones. It
is altogether the most delightful
place for a child with such
abundant space out of doors
and in. The rooms they use are
very comfortably furnished,
though not exactly in the style
of Linton (where the drawing-
room is in walnut and satin
damask), but they have good
dark carpets and respectable
cedar, so that Teddy can
rampage without fear of much
damage.
They are very comfortably
off, for the Government are pay-
ing Mr. Hedgeland at the rate
of two guineas per day. He has
the “alignment” of all Petersham
and Ashfield, which sort of
surveying requires most accurate
work and calculation, and all
surveyors cannot do it, so that
he is well paid. He is looking
very well. Annie, I thought,
looking thin, but that she always
does. She seemed well when I
was there, and we used to take
pleasant walks together.
On May 6 I put myself on
board the steamer and came
home, leaving dear Annie, who
insisted on coming to see me
off, apparently quite well, and it
was that very day a few hours
afterwards that she was taken ill.
I was very glad to be at home
again, for it is lonely for Mr.
Taylor when I am away, and I
do not half enjoy myself with-
out him.
I found all well at home ; the
servants had managed very
fairly in my absence, and
“Springfield” looked prettier
than ever. The timber for the
house is nearly all come and
lying in piles upon the site. The
garden has been fenced round,
and now we are only waiting
for fine weather to begin the
house and to plant the garden.
I do not suppose the dwelling
will be finished before the end
of the year, as while we are
about it we think it is best to
build a comfortably large house,
for we hope to spend the rest
of our, lives there.
We hope to make the garden
very pretty by and by. There
is every advantage of soil and
situation and the best climate in
Australia, but it will take time,
of course, and patience. Mr.
Taylor thoroughly likes farming,
and I think the farm will in time
pay us very well.
Ever your affectionate sister,
Rachel Taylor.

it did not pay because of trans-
port difficulties. Biddulph married
Emily Tucker on Nov. 26, 1872.
[The foregoing were the chUdren

acceptable, for the expenses of
a new farm are considerable, to
say nothing of the house, which
has cost nearly £3OO.
So much for business. As for
pleasure, we are having lovely
weather now after three
months of such rainy skies as
would not have disgraced
England. However, though it
was unpleasant at the time it
has made the country look
beautiful. The grass so green
and the garden so fuff of flowers,
When fine, the Australian
autumn is the Perfection of
weather; cool and bright, and
with a clear atmosphere that
makes the distant hills and
woods and farms stand out
nearly as clear as if you saw
them through a glass.
Our house is very comfort-
able. We have just had the
sitting-room papered and the
ceiling whitewashed, and yester-
day it was cleaned out pre-
paratory to the furniture being
moved in. It is a large, pleasant
room with three French windows
and a lovely view therefrom.
We are at present using the
spare bedroom as a sitting-room,
but now that we are going t
a.fd
to ask Biddulph and Emily to
come down and pay us their
promised visit before the cold
weather comes on. The bed-
rooms are rather rough yet,
being unpapered, but they will
not mind that.
Biddulph is very fond of
Illawarra, and will enjoy the
rides and drives here Emily
has never seen the district yet.
They talk of driving down in
their own buggy, as neither of
them likes the steamers, and the
coach is often so crowded. lam
expecting to hear every day
when they will come.
I have the house all to myself
this morning, with the exception
of a few cats and a couple of
dogs! Mr. Taylor is down in
the lucerne paddock, turning
over some hay. I can see him
from the window, a white spot
in the distance. Both the
servants are gone to a school
feast and picnic up the moun-
tain, which they preferred by
way of an Easter holiday. You
are obliged to give your servants
a great many holidays here, to
keep them at all, and I do not
think they are any the worse for
them, nor are we. I have dinner
cooked the day before, and it is
not much trouble to boil the
potatoes and lay the table and
to get the tea.
The “upper ten” (leaving out
the thousands) of Wollongong
never think of going out on any
of the people’s holidays; they
generally have to take care of
their houses and take their own
pleasure at other times. It is
curious that in these republican
countries where “Jack is as good
as his master,” and much better
in his own estimation, there is a
much wider gap between class
and class than there is in
England. There, at least in the
old times, you would go and see
your poorer neighbors and
rather enjoy a talk with them,
especially in the country. Here
if you did anything of the kind
they would return your call and
bring their
children to tea.
The conse-
quence is that,
though we are
surrounded b y
little farms, I do
not know one of
the farmers’
wives, even by
sight/ except an
old lady, whose
milking -yard
borders the road

have seen her in
passing.

with land

which Mr.’
Hedgeland
wants for his horses. He is
making a great deal of money
by his profession, but the draw-
back to it is the frequent moving
that it entails, unless he took a
permanent residence and
“camped out” for weeks to-
gether, as some surveyors do,
and this neither he nor Annie
likes, and I am sure I do not
wonder at it. I should go and
camp out, too, Annie is better,
but not very strong. I think
she does too much. She is one
of those active people who are
always moving about, and will
not sit down till she is thoroughly
tired out and is obliged to. I am
about quite as much or perhaps
more, but then I am stronger.
I think I have gained strength
as I have got older, while both
Annie and Amy have done the
reverse, I hope you have
followed my example, not theirs.
I often hear from Biddulph,
and Mr. Taylor was staying with
them about a fortnight ago,
when he went to Sydney on some
business, Biddulph and Emily
seem very happy and flourishing.
Mr. Taylor says Linton is look-
ing beautiful. It is the prettiest
and best-kept place on the North
Shore. I wish we could emulate
it, but a farm to look after does
not admit of the lawn being
mown every day. Biddulph’s
man has nothing to do but
garden and look after the horse
and carriage.
I am busy making some
curtains for the sitting-room.
We had some green moreen
curtains at the Peach Trees, and
I have had them dyed and am
putting some new binding on
them which will make them look
quite respectable again. We have
also invested in a new table-
cloth and hearth-rug, but just yet
we cannot afford a great deal in
the way of furniture: the cottage
has cost so much. However, I
think Mr. Taylor was wise to
build' it of a good size, because
we could never have enlarged
the rooms, and all accessories
can be added hereafter, when
we are better off. The farm is
so good it only requires time to
pay well, but the great drawback
is the difficulty of getting labor.
Since X have been writing, a
ragged and barelegged appari-
tion invaded the lawn and threw
“Jip” into paroxysms of bark-
ing, and this proved to be a
small boy come to be engaged.
Mr. Taylor has been inquiring
for one for the last six months.
This urchin is not eleven years
old and does not know how to
drive bullocks, but Deighton
was only too glad to engage him
at 4s. a week, to be increased to
ss. when he has learned the
abovementioned art. He will
run away before that. David,
our factotum, has 14s. a week,
and Maggie, the general servant,
Bs. Wages are getting enormous
out here. In Sydney a thoroughly
good cook and laundress gets
20s. a week. Annie is giving a
very indifferent one 12s.
Now I must end this long
letter. Give my love to Aunt
and Uncle when you write to
Taunton, and with much to Mr.
Boyce, yourself and the
“children.”
Believe me, my dearest Etta,
ever your affectionate sister,
Rachel Taylor.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Sack”; I had dropped in to see Old
Chick, and as usual he marched me
down to view his poultry-farm—a motley
collection of black-speckled Leghorns
and white-feathered Orpingtons, with a
crossbred Indian Game rooster to make
up the two dozen. It was a scorcher of
a day, and as I tried to avoid looking
bored to the weeping point, while
manoeuvring to keep in the shade of a
4in. post, it occurred to me that the
chocks were famishing for the want of
a drink. “Thirsty,” scoffed Chick. “Why,
I filled up their” He broke off.
“Funny. Where’s it gone, then? Them
blasted kids —that’s what it is. Strike me
roan, nothin’s safe from ’em. Johnno!
Johnno, come here! What’d’yer take
that china-basin out of the fowlyard for?
Mum didn’t take it. Don’t start tellin’
me lies or I’ll flatten yer. Where is it?”
Suddenly he broke off and a sheepish
grin spread over his rugged face. “Aw,
cripes, I forgot,” he mumbled. “The
missus only uses it one day a year,” he
explained to me. “It’ll be back to-
s
IAB-101
'N
morrow.” It was—and the feathered
connoisseurs seemed to appreciate the bits
of Christmas pud. adhering to its
sides.
* ♦ * *
“Abdul”; It was the largest station in
the district, and as such was to be honored
by a visit from a very important person-
age. The lavish entertainment arranged
for his amusement included a rodeo. Ail
the champion hoops and all the wildest
jumpers in the locality were roped in a
couple of weeks before the event was
held, but the piece de resistance was to
be an outlaw whose reputation was
notorious from the Diamantina to the
Snowy. Stationed as he was up on the
border about 100-odd miles away, the
snag was to fetch him down, for, at best,
he was a rare packet of trouble. Old
Jack the drover, a noted handler of bit-
chewers in his day, offered to ride up
and lead him back, but, as it was gener-
ally conceded that Old Jack’s day had
long since passed, the management
decided to get someone else. No one
else was anxious to go, so Jack saddled
his prad and departed with the boss’s
blessing. Ten days later he stumped into
the hut about midnight, informed a few
sleepy inquirers that the outlaw was in
the yards, rolled out his nap and turned
in. Next morning after breakfast the
boss and most of the hands went down
to the yards to give the famous prad the
once-over. A big black, he stood in a
corner of the enclosure and submitted
without rancor to inspection from the
top rails, “Hey, Jack!” yelled the boss.
“What’s this? He’s got saddle-marks on
him!” “Yairs,” replied the old drover
defensively. “My horse knocked up ten
miles out of Mungindi, so I rode this ’un
in. Fair blank he was, too,”
* * ■* *
“Chuck”; About daylight Ned dropped
in at Charlie’s shack and found the latter
feeding himself. “G’ day,” greeted Ned.
“Thought I might catch you still here.
Had my feed just before I came over.”
Charlie speared a couple of small quarters
on to his plate and grimaced at them.
“Rabbit,” he said. “Yair. Heard you’re
digging out the far paddock now,” Ned
remarked. “You’ll probably get another
seven thousand there.” He paused as a
scuffle sounded under the hut. It was
followed by a growl, and then a squeal.
“Rabbit,” said Charlie. “Yair. Well, I
just come over to see if I could borrow
a few lengths of fuse,” Ned explained,
sniffing suspiciously. “Got to blow out a
dam, and knew you had fuse here.” He
sniffed again in several directions before
he located the piled pelts in the corner.
“Rabbit,” said Charlie. “Yair. Sure make
’emselves felt, don’t they?” the caller
grinned. “Awright. I’ll take some of this
fuse here, if you don’t mind. Thought I
might scoop out this dam, but cripes she’s
hard. Fact, if you ask me, all this flamin’
country round here seems to be made up
of is rock an’ ” “Rabbit,” said
Charlie.
4> * * *
“M.S.”; When Stan bought his hill
block it was alive with rabbits,
and after putting up a hut for
himself he got to work on the
pests. All through the winter he dug
out, then the ground hardened, his hands
became more blistered, and still there
seemed no end to the giant burrows. With
spring, the rabbits began breeding. For
every grown one he caught there now
seemed to be half-a-dozen kittens run-
ning around, and though Stan tried to
persuade himself he was holding the lee-
way he’d gained during the winter, it was
slowly forced upon him that he was losing
ground. But the summer crept on, and
still he stuck to the job. “Man can’t make
any profit off this place till he cleans it
up,” he told himself, making a swipe
with the mattock, waiting for the dust to
clear, then making another. “Got to get
some stock on.” Finishing that burrow
he took a walk back over the country he
had worked, thinking to find it clean.
Instead, he discovered the rabbits had
dug in behind him, and the area would
have to be done all over again.
There were thousands of the pests.
Disgust and a great hopelessness
settled over him, and, leaning against
the road-fence, he was surveying
the paddock with dull eyes when Cockie
Dale rode up. “Gripes, you’ll never get
rid of ’em standing there, Stan,” he
greeted. “They’ll starve y’ out if y’ don’t
stick at it.” Then, catching the look on
the other’s face, he grinned sympatheti-
cally, “Yair, I know,” he sighed. “Still,
them things ain’t as bad as the Gover’-
ment, Stan. Soon’s y’ get on t’ makin’ a
few bob y’ll find the Guwo’s worse.”
#- x
Stan moved bis head wearily, “Worse ?”
“Yair,” Cockie assured him. “Worse.
Dammit, at least when a bloke catches
one o’ them rabbits he can kill ’im.”
* * * *
“Swelpme”: Big Tony had found a
hive of bees in a “verra big of the tree,”
and proposed, with the help of his com-
patriot Angelo, to add honey to his menu.
“Kelly” Hackitt willingly lent him veils
and smoker, but his axes were poems in
honed steel, and no first-class axeman
will lend his blade to mugs. However,
the pair of New Australians were quite
understanding; they “gotta da axe,” they
assured him, and departed, with a promise
to bring some honey when they returned
the borrowed gear. Some time later
hollow, jarring thumps began to ring from
the bush down in the gully. “Kelly”
squirmed mentally ; those measured thuds
told a disquieting story of heartbreaking,
ineffectual labor with a blunt instrument
that wouldn’t cut a watermelon. He dis-
missed the nagging thought and went on
with his work. Nearly an hour later the
thumpings were still echoing from the
bush. The axeman’s conscience refused
to be stalled any longer. With his favorite
Kelly in his hand he strode down the
gully. The trunk of the dead box looked
as though rats had been chewing at it,
but it was nearly through. “Kell” waved
the sweating pair aside, placed a few cuts
with a master’s touch, and the tree fell.
Immediately the veiled pair rushed for-
ward with their smoker. It wasn’t neces-
sary. Still, I suppose an Old Aussie could
have made the same mistake —if he’d
seen blowflies coming out of a hollow in
which reposed, as it turned out, a very
dead possum.
* ♦ • *
“Taswegian”: I doubt whether those
straw-necked ibis which follow the plough
in Queensland (B. 28/11/’sl) were as
daring as the silver gulls on wind-swept
King Island, in Bass Strait. Sometimes
they are half-buried by the turning sod.
* * * *
“Edx” tells of an experiment in physics:
Back in the days when gold was spoken of as
being worth £4 4s. 1 lid. sterling an ounce, and
not 35 foreign dollars, old George had a small
show somewhere out from Sandstone (W.A.).
He was down to a fairly respectable depth, and
at one stage had a couple of “boys” on the
windlass, but, coming to life one morning, he
found that the blacks had vanished, and he
was faced with the tiresome necessity of climb-
ing up and down the ladder. George decided
he could use the windlass single-handed, and
after a few trials he arrived at a wprking
arrangement. Using one bucket to ride in, he
put a quantity of stone into the other (on the
other end of the windlass rope), so that when
he stepped into his bucket with his crib in the
morning he just outweighed the stone, and so
sank slowly and comfortably to the bottom,
where, after anchoring the bucket, he could
get out and start work for the day. At knock-
off George, having eaten his crib, was, of course,
lighter than the counterbalance, and, stepping
into his bucket and casting off, was at once
drawn up to the surface. This worked well
for a while until he noticed that the journeys
up and down the shaft were getting slower and
slower, and he found it necessary to take
larger and larger lunches down with him in
order to get sufficient weight-difference. Not
wanting to have the shaft full of stale food, he
of course had to eat it all, and this was taking
about half the day, quite apart from the time
he took preparing it. Then one morning, as
he contemplated the enormous sack of food
with which he was about to stagger into the
bucket, George suddenly realised what was
wrong. He had never greased the windlass;
the thing was rusting up and getting stiff. He
soon had it apart, cleaned up, and lavishly
greased. After putting it together again and
re-fixihg the buckets, he stepped into the empty
one, and through force of habit reached out
and dragged the crib-bag aboard. It was a
second or two before George, who was used
to a slow trip, realised as he whistled down
the shaft what had happened, and had the
presence of mind to jettison the crib. It stayed
level for a short while, but he had greased the
windlass well, and because of the slightly stream-
lined shape of the bucket he soon gained on
the bag. He could tell by the rising tempera-
ture in the shaft when be was nearing the
bottom, and was able to brace himself for the
shock, so that apart from being knocked out,
a fraction of a second after he struck, by the
bag of food, all he suffered was barked hips,
caused by his belt shooting down to his ankles
when the kibble hit the bottom. He came to
just in time to go out again under a glancing
blow from the counterbalance, which had,
naturally, begun to descend as soon as he had
been knocked out of the passenger bucket.
After recovering from this George began the
long climb up the ladder, only to find that the
empty bucket in its wild swinging ascent had
ripped a section of the ladder out, and he was
a prisoner. It was then that George became
convinced that the East Murchison was
dangerous country, and when, three weeks later,
and almost at the end of the tucker, he was
rescued by a ’Ghan teamster, he lost no time in
packing his gear and moving to a safer district.

“Mat’s Mate”: Christmas, ourselves,
and the man from the Marthaguy
occurred simultaneously to Narromine,
ourselves possessing two-bob and the m.
from the M. some hope. He was long
and lean and predaceous, this Marthaguy
man, and, having used some of our two-
bob to wash the dust of the Trangie road
from his throat, swore eternal gratitude,
and, with sundry significant winks and
whispers, informed us that he would be
having poultry for Christmas dinner and
would be honored if we would join him.
We accepted this invitation with reserve,
for we believed something might turn
up. It didn’t, and on Christmas morning
we searched the river-bank until we
located our host, who indicated a heap
of feathers some distance away and a
half-kero.-tin boiling on the fire. We
sat down and contemplated the lazy Mac-
quarie, discussing art, literature and
sundry other topics with our host, who
now and then tested the contents of his
kero.-tin and announced each time “She
won’t be long now.” About 2 p.m. famine
had reduced Mat and me to silence and
the man from the Marthaguy to bad
language. The bird had been boiled for
2\ hours and was tougher than when it
began. “Must ha’ bin about ten year
old,” said our host with profanity. “It
was so ruddy dark, an’ the flamin’ chooks
was squawkin’, an’ I hadda grab the first
one I could an’ do a bunk.” Mat got up
and inspected the bird, then he strolled
up to the pumping-station, found the dis-
carded iron weight from a safety-valve,
carted it back and dropped it into the
kero.-tin. “Me an’ me mate,” he said to
the wondering host, “will go up the town.
Soon’s y’ can stick a fork in that weight
you’ll know the bird’s cooked an’ y’ can
come up an’ call us.” We haven’t seen
him since; though that kero.-tin still
stands above its dead ashes, inside it the
long mummified remains of a fowl. It
is—or was—one of the scenic features of
Narromine.
BOY AND HORSE.
Stock-still in the paddock,
Half-thistle and half-moonlight,
The old racehorse is foxing
The moonstruck boy tonight.
The lagoon is a pot of silver
Buried in darkest sleep:
The mustering clouds are cattle
And the dry, sharp scent is sheep.
The river sings in the willows,
Sobs as it spins on stone:
A dog barks once in the distance.
Boy and horse are alone.
Staring one at the other
In a dream of enchanted fears:,
Softly as any lover
Bridle slips over ears.
Gripping the mane with the fingers,
Up on the high, thin back;
Night-air and starlight flowing,
Cantering up the track.
Galloping oh so finely,
Safe from the face of the sun,
The soft earth thuds beneath them;
Boy and horse are one.
Bare legs whipped by thistles,
A little out of breath;
The tall horse shies at a rabbit —
Clutch his mane like death.
Charging a world of shadows,
Moon-lance splinters and jars
In the calm, dark heart of the river:
They thunder among the stars.

“Solitude”: We’d hitched our hacks
and were mooching across to the sale-
yards when a bloke spotted Seventyfiver.
“ ’Day,” he grinned agreeably. “How’s
things?” “ ’Day,” replied the old bloke.
“Good-oh.” His face screwed into a
puzzled scowl as we passed. “Who’s that,
Sol?” “Stranger to me.” “Well, ’e
seemed t’ know me, didn’t he?” pondered
Seventyfiver. “ ’Less he thought I was
somebody else.” “Y’ don’t look like
somebody else —not ever. Y’ must have
met him somewhere.” “Don’t think so.”
He shook his head thoughtfully, and we
passed on down the long line of Here-
fords in the saleyards, looking them over.
Opposite the second-last pen Seventyfiver
stopped suddenly. “Gripes, them cattle’s
done well,” he exclaimed. “They was
pretty poor last time I seen ’em.” “Who
owns them?” I asked. “Dunno,” he
replied. “Struck that mob over near the
border, nine or ten months back. That
big bally in front there was pretty lame
at the time, an’ that ’n with the turned
horns looked like she was gonna chuck
it. Yair, they’ve done well awright. Look
quite diff’rent.” He paused a minute, and
a light dawned on his mug, “Gripes, Sol,
that must be who that bloke is,” he
decided. “Must’ve been with these cattle.
I ’member now I et me dinner with some
coot, an’ yarned for a hour or so while
our mobs spelled off.”
* # * *
“Old-timer”: Long Lane’s saddle-
horse picked up lice somewhere in the
town, but L.L. didn’t know until the pests
were pretty thick, the nag irritable and
bare patches showing on him here and
there from the rubbing. So Long Lane
rang up the stock-inspector, who told him
to wash the neddy with a mixture of a
couple of teaspoonfuls of carbolic-acid
in a gallon of water. This seemed to do
the trick, and Long Lane was happy. But
a couple of days later he was discovered
frowning over a letter. It was from the
stock-inspector, and said “I forgot to
"Wrong chimney !”
tell you the carbolic isn’t an ovicide, so
you had better re-treat the horse again in
about three weeks to kill any lice hatched
out in the interim.” “Well,” Long’un said,
“I reckoned I knew every part of a horse,
but I’m damned if I know where t’ look
for old Barney’s interim.”
* * * *
“Macquarie”: If we must start this
argument again as to whether a tree will
carry an object upwards as it grows,
here’s a Roland for “Loulalo’s” Oliver (B.
5/12/’5l). When I first saw the seaside
township of Austinmer (N.S.W.), well
over 20 years ago, an avenue of com-
paratively young trees brinked the main
road. Close to the trunks of several were
built long wooden seats facing the beach
and surf. The back rails of these
thoughtfully-provided conveniences were
of Sin. x 2in. hardwood ; and on one seat
the rail touched the bark of the tree
which shaded it. Just before World War
II I revisited the pretty little holiday
resort and was amazed to notice that one
of the hardwood backs had been bent
with the outward growth of the tree until,
the solid timber being unable to camber
any further, it had cracked and splintered.
But, although the outward bow looked
to be fully 6in., the rail had not lifted
upwards a quarter of an inch.
* * * *
“Brink”: Here in this Burnett (Q.)
district we have been buying baled
lucerne-hay to feed what starving stock
a 10-months drought and the worst bush-
fires in living memory have left us. On
opening one bale we found pieces of
wool, hooves and leg-bones of a sheep
in among it. The wool had been badly
singed by fire. The only conclusion we
could come to was that a poor sheep,
badly burned by the recent fires, had
taken refuge in the green lucerne patch,
and, dying there, was later mown and
baled up in the hay. The modern method
of machine-baling would account for the
farmer’s not noticing it.
* * * *
“W.”: Looking around at the
particularly large mob of lories that sud-
denly sprinkled themselves over the
garden, I at once spotted the stranger.
He was larger than the lories; larger
than a king-parrot. Green head, back,
wings and tail, a duskier green throat
and part way down the breast, the rest of
his underneath, including leg-feathers,
was a bright orange. Beak also was
bright orange On the top of each wing,
showing evenly when folded, and flash-
ing as he flew, was an inch or so mottled
chain of a lighter, shining green, A
quiet-dispositioned bird, much like the
lories, and I walked to within five yards
without concerning him overmuch.
Feeding on the ground, the big parrot
appeared all green, and scarcely dis-
cernible in the grass, till a step revealed
a leg of orange pants. That he is a
stranger is evidenced by his adoption of
the lories, but I would say he has not
been tamed, and if he escaped from a
zoo or any known collection, has had to
fly several hundred miles. Anyone
help?
« * * *
“O. K. Lee”: Met a goanna on the
Maranoa (s.-w. Q.). His sudden ascent
of the tree so startled my mare that she
Lao. nearly wiped me off in her sudden
jump. In resentment I cut at the go. with
my whip, thereby stampeding him along
a branch from which he took off in a
desperate leap to another tree. He made
it all right, but the branch on which he
alighted broke. He did not hit the deck.
With a spasmodic leap he covered a
horizontal distance of at least sft. and
gained the trunk. In his aerial progress
he resembled, with outspread legs and
elevated tail-unit, an aeroplane in a
gliding descent, and I’m wondering if the
ability to glide is a little-known attribute
of the go.
SPEAK TO STRANGERS.
Say something before we go. Interest’s a key
To unlock the cell of self so we can walk
In the air a while. We are all prisoned, then why
Be so aloof? Talk kindles a glow
To see by. Even a shout may crack the roof,
Let in a star . . . Say something before we go.
Strange that I know the dead better than you,
Closed in your tower of silence. Do vultures
prey
There too? Architecturally, I think
Babel outshines Bombay. It’s true
We dislike being neon-lit, but would you wait
For a dumb stone Boswell to speak for you?
You’re going my way. Step through the gate
and see
My collection of illusions. My grandfather’s
name
Was Adam. We may discover a thing or two
In common, tastes the same. This your place?
I’d not pick your purse or kinsey at the keyhole,
But merely borrow a match to see your face.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
EUROPEAN (Not British) FEDERATION.
“Far from being a vague idea
which everyone approves but no
one does anything about, the
political unification of a large
part of democratic. Continental
Europe is moving ahead toward
accomplishment with increasing
momentum and with elemental
force.”
This arresting finding by
“New York Times” has very
widespread American and
certainly highly influential Con-
tinental European endorsement.
New York “Herald Tribune”
provides another f.a.q. sample
of high-flown American opti-
mism:
“There is the faith of millions
in this country [U.S.A.] and
abroad that Europe can unite
for its own salvation and peace.
There is, in an even deeper way,
a fate that seems to be driving
Europe toward an ultimate
federation, regardless of the
obstacles and even of the desires
of men.”
Despite Mr, Churchill’s
original sponsorship of the
idea, it has nothing like the same
support in Britain.
France all along has been the
main mover —first proposing
the Schuman Plan, then the plan
for a European Army with
German contingents. Actual
political federation of Europe
would dwarf even those very
venturesome moves. It would
mean nothing less than a United
States of Europe, which may be
one reason why it has strong
official and sentimental support
in America.
This infinitely bigger step is
precisely what France now pro-
poses: federated Europe. And
France seeks immediate positive
action.
FINE WORDS!
In some forthright comment
on Britain’s position in general,
and Mr. Churchill’s in particular,
“Washington Post” has stated:
“Now we shall see to what
extent Winston Churchill really
means the fine, brave words he
has uttered about the unity of
Europe. Five years ago he made
a memorable speech in Zurich
in which he pictured the ruin of
a prostrate continent. He
talked of a ‘remedy’ that would
make ‘Europe, or the greater
part of it, as free and happy as
Switzerland is today.’ ‘What is
this sovereign remedy?’ he
asked. ‘lt is to recreate the
European family, or as much of
it as we can, and to provide it
with a structure under which it
can dwell in peace, in safety and
in freedom. We must build
something like a United States
of Europe.’
“Unless Mr. Churchill is false
to his own high ideals, he and
his colleagues will [now] talk
and act like good Europeans.
From the very first days of the
Marshall Plan, Congress clearly
saw an American interest in
European unity. The return of
Mr. Churchill to leadership can
be a mighty help toward making
this American dream come
true.”
GRANDEUR, BUT—
Evidently the American Press
is a shade optimistic on that
score —overlooking how Britain’s
national interests must influence
British Governments.
The British caution —to per-
haps understate it —is fairly re-
flected in a number of London
“Times” leaders on the latest
French proposals. “Some form
of federation,” it comments in
one, “may indeed be the ulti-
mate goal to which the Western
nations should strive, but to
pretend that it can be accom-
plished overnight, either in
Europe or in the Atlantic com-
munity as a whole, is to ignore
political realities,”
In another editorial: “The
position of this country [Britain]
is indeed delicate. There is no
wish to underestimate the
grandeur of the French concep-
tion of a united Europe, though
there may be a tendency to
doubt its immediate practica-
bility.”
ATLANTIC AXIS
Though “axis” might be
frowned on as a name for it,
that is what Britain’s choice
amounts to.
The “Times” calls it “a wider
Atlantic community,” to be
based on “the three pillars of
the United States and Canada,
the British Commonwealth, and
a united Europe, rather than on
a federal union of Europe.”
But “Atlantic community” is
not to be read as meaning
“Atlantic federation.” The
Churchill Government is flat
against that, too. As reported by
London “Observer,” Home Sec-
retary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe
made it clear to Europeans that
Britain, when speaking of
Atlantic union or the Atlantic
community, was not thinking of
a federation.
That, said the Home Secre-
tary, was “an unrealistic idea.”

Secretary, Foreign Office) m
these terms:-
“The position of Britain is
unique, because we are an
essential part of what the
Foreign Secretary [Mr. Eden]
has called the three great unities
of the world; the unity across
the Atlantic, the unity within the
British Commonwealth and
Empire and the unity with
Western Europe. We cannot,
therefore, devote ourselves
exclusively to any one of these
three groups, because it is
through our playing our part in
each of them that the greater
unity of all the three unities can
be knit and welded into one.”
J. BULL’S NO
Also speaking for the
Churchill Government, Mr.
Boothby, M.P., told the Council
of Europe at Strasbourg that,
while Britain might become the
linchpin of a democratic union
embracing “Europe, the Com-
monwealth and the English-
speaking fellowship of the
Atlantic community,” it could
not join a purely European poli-
tical federation.
Considerations of defence,
Commonwealth ties, and the
economic implications of the
sterling area, he said, prevented
this. If it came to a choice be-
tween Europe and the Common-
wealth, more than 90 per cent,
of the British people would not
hesitate to choose the Common-
wealth, But there was no reason
why such a choice would ever
have to be made. The two must
run together.
“Although it is our ultimate
aim to foster the idea of the
Atlantic, rather than a purely
European, community,” Mr.
Boothby added, giving what
can be taken as Britain’s final
word, “we believe that European
arrangements on a supra-
national basis can exist and
function within the larger
entity; and we are prepared to
associate ourselves with such
arrangements.”
A “Times” correspondent has
dryly commented: “Continental
Europeans are no longer com-
forted by assurances of Britain’s
‘close association’ or ‘warm wel-
come’ or by other euphemisms
for no direct participation.”
Edinburgh “Scotsman” antici-
pates that “Mr. Churchill may
have some explaining to do when
he meets Mr. Truman,” while
widespread American reactions
are fairly represented by Mil-
waukee “Journal’s” comment
that the Churchill Government
stand is “as astounding as it is
discouraging,” and:
“The new Conservative leader-
ship under Winston Churchill
has thus far proved as lacking
in vision as the Labor Govern-
ment of Clement Attlee.”
Of the Europeans themselves,
M. Reynaud, for France, Jias
openly accused Britain of “re-
pudiation.” Which may be
modern diplomatese for
“perfidious Albion” and
would have as many echoers.
Dragnet Digest.
Court News. —Opening of a
London “Times” special article
on Siam; “King Phumiphol
Aduldej of Siam is soon to re-
turn to his country from Europe
with Queen Siriket and their
baby daughter, and there is great
rejoicing throughout the nation.
His last brief visit to his country
in March, 1950, was for the
cremation of his brother, King
Ananda Mahidol, who was
assassinated in 1946....
Example in Manners. —Com-
menting that “The conduct of
foreign policy by Mr. Churchill
and Mr. Eden has begun well,”
London “Economist” scores up
to their record; (1) Taking wise
decisions; (2) adopting “a style
of public address that is a
rebuke to the bad manners of
current diplomacy.”
The Eden Touch. —On Mr.
Eden’s appearance as Foreign
Minister at U.N.0., “New York
Times’s” noted woman corres-
pondent, Anne O’Hare Mc-
Cormick, commented that
“Actually what the audience
heard in Mr. Eden’s address was
the almost forgotten voice of
diplomacy. It is,” she added,
“significant that Eden made an
impression because he used the
classic, comparatively pale
language of diplomacy rather
than the new and lurid lingo of
propaganda,”
Churchill-Truman Prelude. —
Another fed-up with diplomacy
by diatribe, London “Daily Ex-
press” thinks the Churchill-
Truman meeting may prelude an
end to “this mad post-war era
in which top statesmen have only
met to hurl insults and affronts”
in U.N.0.: “There has been too
much so-called open diplomacy.
The time has come for the top
men —Stalin included —to get to-
gether behind closed doors and
to discuss fully the problems
which confront the world.”
Kremlin Aim. —Terse assess-
ment by London “Economist”:
“The Russians have a long-term
aim—equality with an America
isolated from its allies —and they
have a political strategy to
achieve it. They assume that
the West also has an aim and a
political plan, but it has not.”
Britain’s Crisis. London
“Observer’s” economic corres-
pondent makes the point (with
“special emphasis”) that Britain’s
latest crisis is not the result of
the rearmament effort: “The
latest trade figures show clearly
that defence orders have not yet
begun to interfere with exports ;
if exports of manufactured
goods have recently fallen it is
because they are meeting both
consumer resistance and increas-
ing competition from Germany
and Japan.”
Com.-held P.-0.-W —One of
the things insisted on by the
U.N.O. side in the Korean peace
palavers has been a guarantee
on the welfare of p.-0.-w. The
special reason, as London
“Economist” points out, is
that, Russia and its stooges
not being parties to International
Red Cross humanitarianism,
“Prisoners-of-war in a conflict
with a Communist State are not
protected by any general inter-
national agreement, and if any-
thing can be done for them it
can only be as part of the terms
of an armistice.”
Unde Sam, Pardner. —Point-
ing to “the financial help on a
hitherto unimagined scale—help
coming ultimately not from the
United States Treasury but from
the individual taxpayer’s
pocket,” London “Spectator”
adds: “There could be no better
testimony to the soundness of
Anglo-American relations than
that such altruism has in fact
created no sense of domination
on the one side or of subservi-
ence on the other.”

SUNDRY SHOWS
A.B.C. on Rostrum
and Mat.
“F.S.”; Alceo Galliera’s last
—given at the Town Hall, Mel-
bourne—was the finest concert
of his Australian sojourn. The
music of the first part was all
first - performance - in-Australia.
Leading his orchestra back to
the 17 th century and early
Italian music, he introduced his
audience to Vivaldi, Benedetto
Marcello and Monteverde. More
complex music may have been
written since, but none more
fresh and lovely than the glorias
and the salmos written for the
old cathedral organs; and
choirs, represented in this case
by local singers like Betty Fret-
well, Muriel Luyk and Alan
Eddy and the Royal Philhar-
monics. The ordered tempest
of the first part merged in the
second into the shadowy, haunt-
ing tone-painting of Debussy.
The “La Mer” suite, with its
images of lapping waves, shin-
ing seas and murmuring breezes,
concluded the proceedings; the
audience stamped and shouted,
Mr. Galliera was presented with
a genuine boomerang straight
from and started
off for his homeland, no doubt
with the comforting conviction
that he had brought peace and
harmony into the music-loving
soul of Melbourne.
The pandemonium broke out
at the Nicholas Hall a few nights
later, where 300 of the 9000
subscribers to the season met to
discuss things with the A.8.C.,
represented by Mr. Boyer and
Mr. Moses. Really cruel things
were said about them, poor fel-
lows ; and Mr. Colin Badger,
director of the Council of Adult
Education, told them straight
that they ought to get out of
the concert-giving business. At
times the meeting sounded like
a modern symphony written for
a brass foundry and three loco-
motives. No gratitude on the
part of the 9000 whatsoever.
It just shows how impossible it
is to give people art as a sort of
handout. People have to make
it themselves if they are to get
any satisfaction out of it. Giv-
ing a lot of people almost for
nothing 30 or 40 magnificent
concerts a year performed by
the finest players and conducted
by great conductors has only
gained for the A.B.C. almost
universal hatred and resentment.
To listeners it has given dissatis-
faction and boredom. Art
should always be made harder,
not easier, for people. Listening
to or looking at it, even if it is
the very finest, isn’t of much
benefit to them.
Mississippi Mooncalf.
From London:
Tennessee Williams’s play
“Summer and Smoke,” now to
be seen at the Lyric, Hammer-
smith, is a more convincing play
than “A Streetcar Named
Desire”, probably because it is
both less violent and less squalid.
Instead of a tenement in New
Orleans the scene is a middle-
class suburb in Glorious Hill,
Mississippi, which, by means of
a skeleton set, also takes in a
clergyman’s sitting-room and a
doctor’s surgery. Otherwise the
technique and style are identical:
sharply-pointed lines, highly
“theatrical” situations often
crudely melodramatic, crackling
pace, ostinato themes, an entire
absence of literary subtlety, and
an insistent background of
canned music so varyingly atmos-
pheric as to include “The Voice
that Breathed O’er Eden,”
flamenco guitaring and Dixie-
land jazz.
It amounts to a duologue be-
tween the parson’s daughter and
the boy next door, with inter-
ruptions from families, friends
and seducers, and requires a
prologue and 12 scenes to enact
a double transfiguration. Girl
pines for boy, but she is up in
the clouds while he is very much
down to earth. Her idea of
love is wordily and prosaically
spiritual while he takes a more
single-minded view. When
debauchery leads to degradation,
professional negligence (he is a
doctor) and the murder of his
father, he checks himself and
abruptly leads a new life. The
girl, who meanwhile has thrown
off her repressions, offers her-
self to him but is refused. She
then turns pick-up.
Several grand actors are
wasted in conventionally
theatrical parts. Will ia m
Sylvester, as the young doctor,
has a supporting part that is
exacting enough to qualify for
higher status. He is equal to it
in every respect.
Australian Margaret Johnston,
whose rising reputation has been
marred by illness, has deservedly
won acclamation in the part of
the frustrated girl, whose
awkward movement, gushing
manner, prim voice and school-
marmy pedantry are also touch-
ingly real.
"The Messiah."
Quite a spate of “Messiahs”
hit Sydney in the pre-Christmas
days. Of the two noteworthy
performances, that under the
direction of J. Lyndon Jones, in
which his own St. George Choir
combined with that of Central
Methodist Mission, was quite
competent, with a respectable
voice-weight and an injection of
true fervor in such full-blooded
numbers as “For Unto Us.”
The “attack,” too, reflected good
discipline at rehearsal.
The soloists were Marjorie
Conley, making her debut in the
work —her soprano is true and
sweet without being saccharine,
and though rather light has
good penetrative power—con-
tralto Florence Taylor, her voice
always dependable and strong;
Ronald Dowd, whose tenor
always “gets there,” but at
times only just; and basso Noel
Melvin, who seemed able to
rise against the at-times too-
heavy organ work of Leonard
Bell only in “Why Do the
Nations?”
In the performance a few
nights later Norman Chinner,
of Adelaide, wielded the baton
over the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra and the big Hurlstone
choir. The only change in the
four soloists was Elsie Findlay
in place of Marjorie Conley.
Mr. Chinner is a conductor
who knows what he wants and
sets about getting it in a deter-
mined manner, but with a
minimum of fuss. He is also
very obviously not content to
“coast” through a work in which
familiarity often dulls the edge
of conducting. He succeeded in
bringing a freshness to it, and
his patent enthusiasm flowed
out to his combined forces,
resulting in some splendid play-
ing and choral singing. Elsie
Findlay, a seasoned singer of
oratorio, raised her powerful
soprano to good effect through-
out, and both tenor and bass
seemed to appreciate the change
from organ to orchestral back-
ground for their solos. John
Robertson’s trumpet-work in
“The Trumpet Shall Sound”
demonstrated his complete
mastery over his instrument.
Musica Viva.
For what was to have been
the swan-song of this fine
chamber-music ensemble —if the
financial executioner’s axe has
been temporarily stayed, it is
apparently to be kept sharp in
case public support fails—the
players selected three works,
which are all products of the
classico-romantic school and all
of which feature melodic inven-
tion and strong architecture.
Certainly a happy choice was the
Schumann String Quartet in A
Major, No. 3 of Opus 41. If
Schumann’s voice in this is a
little less forthright and aggres-
sive than that of Brahms in his
Quartet which followed (the C
Minor), it has at least a mel-
lowness, with the softer pas-
sages of exquisite workmanship.
The massive Brahms work
found the players at their top—
a fine exposition of free bowing
and effortless integration, com-
bined with a lively appreciation
of both its profundities and its
simplicities. There was an
authoritative account of the
Bohemian peasantries and
pleasantries of Dvorak’s Piano
Quintet in A Major—a lighter
work than the others but one in
which the lyrical thread is strong
but fine.
The works of still another
Melbourne composer, Linda
Phillips, were given an outing at
the Assembly Hall the other
evening under the auspices of
the University Conservatorium
of Music and with the assistance
of soprano Kathleen Goodall,
baritone Arthur Little, Charles
McPhee, oboist, flautist Richard
Chugg, Hyman Lenzer and Don
Howley. Miss Phillips has a
flair for melody, and some of
her vocal numbers were delight-
ful. An Elizabethan air, “Tell
Me, Thou Soul of Love,” gave
the baritone of Arthur Little no
trouble. There were echoes of
other composers in her music—
she is Melbourne “Sun” critic
and must have done a tremen-
dous amount of listening. But in
much of it there was a vivacity
and freshness which was all her
own,
Ernest Buckmaster, showing at
Melbourne Athenaeum, can
claim what is possibly an Aus-
tralian record inasmuch as this
is his 25th one-man show —the
figure may have been beaten
by Arthur Streeton. Buck-
master both paints like and sells
like that master. Also, he tackles
with superb assurance subjects
as vast —as in “Morning, Near
Walwa, Murray Valley,” with
its expanse of enamelled water,
its distant blue hills and its gum-
trees. “Along the Great Ocean
Road” is another. There is a
lack of sensitiveness in these
larger pictures which is not so
apparent in the smaller, and in
his portraits, notably “H. A.
Pitt,” he tends towards the
photographic, the very thing he
deplores in his catalogue fore-
word.
Two of the three exhibitors
showing at the last hanging at
George’s Gallery, Melbourne—
the gallery is to close —belong to
what is called advanced art; the
other, George Scott Brown,
appears to be a follower of
Albert Namatjira. At any rate,
his “Haast Bluff,” “Alumbaura,”
“Painted Canyon,” “Ghost
Gum,” “Corkwood Tree,” “Mt,
Dashwood” and “Rounded
Hills” were momentarily
mistaken on a first view by the
present commentator as works
by Namatjira. The other two
exhibitors are Kenneth Hood
and Erica McGilchrist. Miss
McGilchrist divides her canvas
up into squares and oblongs, fills
the spaces with brilliant blues,
reds and yellows and calls the
result “Landscape with Trees
and Pond” or “Three Static
Figures.” Mr. Hood’s pictures
belong to much the same class.

Post-war exchange, economic and
other difficulties stood in the way of a
revival of the import trade in light
chemicals, drugs, perfumes and cosmetics
that used to come from Britain, U.S.,
France and Germany, and local demand,
stimulated by inflation, immigration and
“full” employment at high and rising
wage-rates, has increased considerably,
D.H.A. and its group of 10 operating
subsidiaries lost no time in taking
advantage of the new opportunities. The
operating units, which are scattered
throughout the Commonwealth, now
comprise:
Elliotts and Australian Drug Pty., Ltd.,
Sydney and Newcastle; Felton, Grimwade
and Duerdins Pty., Ltd., Melbourne;
Felton, Grimwade Dental Co. Pty., Ltd.,
Melbourne; A. M- Bickford and Sons, Ltd.,
Adelaide and Brisbane; Felton, Grimwade
and Bickford, Ltd., Perth, Fremantle and
Kalgoorlie; Taylors, Elliotts Pty., Ltd.,
Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville;
L. Fairthorne and Son Pty., Ltd., Laun-
ceston and Hobart; Hudson’s Eumenthol
Chemical Co. Pty.; Sandos Pty.; Tas-
manian Oil and Drug Pty.
Last term the issued capital in Tas-
manian Oil and Drug Pty. was bought
at an unstated figure. The co. also
became interested, with J, T. Jennings
and Co., in a new concern formed to
cater for the dental trade in Queensland.
And since the close of accounts the shares
in J. Bosisto and Co. Pty., refiners of
eucalyptus oil, have been bought. Also,
when money can be raised for the
purpose, new and enlarged pharma-
ceutical factories are to be built in
Adelaide and Perth.
The policy has been to finance expan-
sion by bank advances, consolidating the
position from time to time by new issues
of share capital as earning capacity
became established. Since 1946
£1,399,353 (it brought with it £712,246
of share premiums) has been added to
issued capital, raising the figure to
£3,974,597 in 100,000 6 p.c. prefs. and
3,874,597 ords. at June 30 last. There was
then £272,432 of capital and £138,000-
odd of share premiums still to come on
554,955 £1 ords. put out at a premium
of 15s, each in March last.
Originally it was not intended to call
for the final 15s. on each of these shares
(10s. capital and ss. premium) before
June 30 next, but shareholders have been
asked to pay on or before Dec. 30, 1951.
Reasons are: (1) that calls on new share-
issues authorised between Jan., 1950, and
end Feb., 1951, cannot be made without
official consent after Dec. 31, 1951 ; (2)
restriction of bank credit; (3) official
refusal of the board’s request to raise
funds “outside the banking system”;
(4) rejection of the co.’s application last
month to make a further issue of new
ord. shares. The board’s programme of
development has been thus halted for
the moment. What effect this will have
upon turnover, against which spiralling
costs will press more heavily, and there-
fore upon net earnings remains to be
seen. To provide for the issue of further
shares when present restrictions (which
the board regards as temporary) are
relaxed, nominal capital has been
doubled, raising it to £10,000,000.
Last term turnover of the group
(amount not stated) increased by 33.5 p.c.,
and “aggregate gross profits increased at a
somewhat higher rate.” Net earnings
shot up by £85,939, reaching a record
£443,629. That was after eliminating out-
side shareholders’ interests, allowing
£100,152 (up £10,183) for depreciation,
a generous £525,443 (up £298,017) for
taxation, £25,000 for research and some-
thing to “offset a collapse of overseas
markets.” The £443,629 of profit claimed
covered the pref. div, and 13 p.c. on
average ord. capital as against 10.6, 7.2,
8.8, 8.1 and 7.2 p.c. back to 1946. The
div., lifted from 7 p.c. to 8 p.c. in 1950,
was raised to 8i p.c. The £2,201,588 of
reserves is subject to £322,310 of good-
will, etc. Most of the £812,413 by which
the price paid for shares in subsidiaries
exceeded their face-value is now
represented by tangible assets.
To help meet net additions of
£1,315,574 to stocks and £645,332 to book
debts the amount coming to outsiders was
increased by £1,137,578:

There was an improvement of £587,186
in the more-or-less liquid surplus
(£3,648,147), due mainly to introduction
of fresh share capital (up £297,258) and
to the growth in the tax reserve (up

Last term the co.’s freeholds at Marrick-
ville (N.S.W.), Thomastown (Vic.) and
Alderley (Q.) were independently re-
valued at £275,446 more than their aggre-
gate book-value. They were written up
by that amount and a like sum was
credited to assets-revaluation reserve.
Also £130,000 was transferred from “pro-
vision for depreciation,” deducted from
the book-value of fixed assets in the pub-
lished accounts, to the general reserve,
making it £230,000. “Having regard to
present-day, cost of replacement of kilns,
stacks, plant, etc.,” the board decided
that the £130,000 was in excess of current
requirements. That reduced total pro-
vision for depreciation at Sept. 30, 1951,
to £54,125—£3099 buildings and £51,026
plant, etc.
This writing-up and writing-back were
book adjustments which do not affect
actual earning-power one way or the
other, except that they may increase the
future annual depreciation charge.
The net effect has been to increase
the figure representing fixed assets
on the one hand and reserves on the other
by £405,446. Excluding provision for
depreciation, reserves now stand at
£522,155, and paid capital at £190,000,
of which £40,000 carries a cumulative
7 p.c. with the right to advance with the
ords. beyond that rate.
The question thus arises as to the pos-
sibility of a bonus-share issue. The
board gives no hint as to what its inten-
tions are in this respect, nor do the pub-
lished accounts of the parent disclose
the earning-power of four subsidiaries, in
which it has £110,302 invested —£60,658
shareholdings and £49,644 advances.
After allowing £20,070 (up £7266) for
depreciation and something for taxa-
tion, the parent’s own profit increased by
£6423, reaching a record £28,473 last
term. That was 15 p.c. on capital as
against 11.6, 8,4, 9.6, 8.7 and 7.4 p.c.
back to 1946. On shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined) as at
Sept. 30 last, the year’s profit was
approximately 4 p.c. The div, was lifted
from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c., leaving one-third
of the year’s net earnings to plough back
into the business.
The offshoots are R. Fowler Vianini,
Ltd., which has been manufacturing con-
crete pipes at Marrickville (N.S.W.) since
the 1920’5, another trading co., an in-
vestment concern, and a new Adelaide
subsidiary, whose pottery at Cudmore
Park came into production during the
1950 term. During the 12 months covered
by the latest accounts all subsidiaries
operated at a profit, of which no account
was taken in the parent’s books. Upon
the size of the aggregate net earnings
of these offshoots largely depend the
prospects of shareholders in the parent
co. All that can be said definitely is
that the present position is better than
the parent’s own accounts suggest.
In the early 1930’s Bs. a share (£100,000)
was slashed off ord. capital, but the posi-
tion, financially and otherwise, was tidied
up well before the war, and the policy
since has been one of consolidation. The
co.’s principal works at Marrickville turn
out drainage and sewerage pipes, house-
hold and other earthenware, floor and
other tiles, and insulators, etc., while the
factories at Melbourne and Brisbane, as
well as the Adelaide offshoot, concentrate
mainly on sanitary ware and household
crockery. Although present plant capa-
city in the industry is now well able to
look after demand, and costs are rising,
the board expresses every confidence in
the co.’s future.
Balance-sheet figures mainly reflect the

The growth in the book-value of fixed
assets was £401,935. The improvement
in the more-or-less liquid surplus
(£130,343) was £12,984.
The market, which expects no further
benefits at an early date, prices the £1
ords. at 30s. (325. 6d. six months ago) to
return 6.6 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.
On the same basis, the prefs. at 31s. 6d,

A surprisingly good result, all things
considered. The co. used to trade
largely on its own account in the wool,
hides and furred-skins markets. It is
still a large buyer in these markets, but
most of its purchases are now on a firm
contract basis, thus eliminating some of
the major risks associated with falling
markets.
And over the last five years the co. has
considerably widened the spread of its
interests. A stock-foods and -medicine
factory was set up at Botany (N.S.W.),
near the tannery, to which additions were
made, a new store, with 60,000 sq. ft. of
floor-space, was erected in Melbourne,
and a subsidiary, French Import Co.
Pty., was formed to handle tractors,
trucks, etc., imported from France. And
early in the last term two subsidiaries
were formed in New Zealand —Wilcox
Mofflin (N.Z.), Ltd., and Power Equip-
ment (N.Z.) Pty., which handles the
tractor business, etc., in the Dominion —
and a controlling interest was bought in
Govan Industries Pty., a Melbourne
concern which makes agricultural equip-
ment and veterinary instruments.
To help finance the growth £330,000 of
share capital was gathered over the six
years to June 30, 1951—the last £137,500
was a par issue in Sept., 1950. Expand-
ing profits were won during the first half
of the 12 months covered by the latest
accounts, but the “reverse occurred”
during the second half, when the sharp
decline in wool and sheepskin prices
“considerably affected” export trading.
Wool fell from an average of approxi-
mately £250 a bale for March to £lOO for
June. It has dropped to lower levels
since, and export demand is not yet
normal. Still, the tannery operated at a
profit, turnover in the stockowners’-
service and agricultural departments
expanded considerably, the tractor
offshoot made marked progress, and
Govan Industries showed satisfactory
improvement.
Altogether the year’s profit was £3830
better at £71,091. That was after allowing
£37,046 (up £5212) for depreciation and
something for taxation and other con-
tingencies. The £71,091 was 12.9 p.c. on
capital as against 16.3, 15.6, 20.4, 19.4
and 14.6 p.c. back to 1946. The 1\ p.c.
bonus sent out with the 10 p.c, div. in
the previous year was not repeated, and
the 10 p.c. is by no means secure. Still,
the business is not subject to the same
degree of risk as it was pre-war, and the
new subsidiary interests promise to be a
stabilising factor.
The new capital, together with an extra
£141,624 from the bank and £313,645
from reduction of stocks, went mainly
into book debts, up £506,316:

REMARKABLE PROGRESS
At the 75th Annual Meeting held on Wednesday, 19th December, at the Society’s Head
Office, the Chairman, Mr. J. T. Thompson, said:—
NEW BUSINESS
“I am pleased to announce that the New
Business completed in the Life Departments,
assuring £33,885,683 under 114,662 policies,
exceeded the previous year’s record total by
£2,373,747. In the Accident Department 17,204
policies were issued assuring £5,411,760 and
Accident Benefits assuring £9,42 5,986 were added
to 28,083 Life Policies. All of the New Business
was derived from Australia and New Zealand.
The steadiness of the rate of expansion of the
Society’s New Business is very gratifying and is
to be preferred to fluctuations.
Group Assurance operations were again highly
successful and this form of Assurance is more in
demand than ever before. Employers realise that
it provides the best possible means of establishing
a Staff Retirement Fund or other scheme of
Superannuation. No employer who values good-
will and the maintenance of happy relations with
his employees can afford to be without some
satisfactory Staff Superannuation scheme. Em-
ployers contemplating one would be well-advised
to consult the Society before formulating any
plan. Officers of the Society have had wide
experience in establishing many of the largest
schemes in Australia and New Zealand and are
always ready and willing to give employers the
benefit of their special knowledge.
INCOME AND ASSURANCE FUNDS
The increase of £1,097,297 in the Society’s
income, to £13,503,836, was the highest ever
recorded. Payments to Policyholders amounted
to £5,025,226, bringing the total in the last ten
years to over £38,000,000 These payments in-
cluded very substantial bonus additions to the
sums assured.
Expenses have increased unavoidably, mainly
due to exceptional increases in wages awards
and in the cost of essential services and com-
modities. These rising costs are beyond our
control and will affect other Life Societies,
Trading Companies and other employers of
labour. The Expense Rates, comparing Total
Expenses (excluding Taxes) with Total Income,
increased by 1.35% to 13.5 7% in the Ordinary
Department and by 1.84% to 26.9% in the
Industrial Department.
The Funds increased by £5,530,944 to
£74,470,368. This huge total represents the net
savings of the Policyholders from premiums both
large and small, and interest earnings. As your
Society is conducted on the mutual principle and
there are no shareholders to participate, these
Funds are held solely for the benefit of Policy-
holders to meet claims under policies as they
arise. In conserving the Funds large sums be-
come available for public works of benefit to the
whole community, as well as for expansion of
industry. Loan Money can also be provided for
mortgage of business premises, housing and other
purposes. The result is a diversification of in-
vestments which has special advantages.
ASSETS
The Board contributed substantially to Security
Loans raised by the Commonwealth Government
and granted many loans to semi-Government and
local authorities. So extensive is the Society’s
connection with Local Body finance that annual
repayments now amount to a very large total.
Even after allowing for these repayments, Gov-
ernment and Public Body Securities increased
by £2,236,369 and now amount to 74.6% of the
Assets now totalling £78,110,999. Advances
were made to a large number of home buyers
under the Society’s Home Purchase system.
Building costs have reached such a high level that
many home seekers appear less willing to enter
into building contracts, and the demand for loan
money for this purpose may be expected to ease.
Company Mortgage Debentures increased from
£446,543 to £1,221,435. There was a small re-
duction in the interest rate earned on the Funds,
partly due to the large number of semi-Govern-
ment and Local Body Loans redeemed. How-
ever, the rate obtainable is dependent upon the
class of investment; and, as mentioned, nearly
75% of the Society’s Assets are in securities of
the highest grade. In the selection of investments
the safety of the Policyholders’ Funds must be
the paramount consideration. Freehold Premises
Account has been written down as usual. As the
majority of our buildings were erected when
costs were less than one-half to-day’s cost, the
Society has a valuable reserve in the excess of
the present-day value over the value appearing
in the Balance Sheet.
REPORT OF THE ACTUARIES
The same conservative bases of valuation have
been adopted and a surplus of £1,432,314 was
disclosed. Bonus allotments provide for a slightly
reduced scale in the Ordinary Department and
for a continuance of the present scale in the
Industrial Department.
The Accident Department continues to make
rapid progress, the premium revenue having in-
creased by £36,155 to £328,435. A large
number of Policyholders in the Life Department
have taken advantage of the benefits available
to them in the Accident Department. The two
departments are closely linked with mutual advan-
tages, and this has enabled £30,000 to be trans-
ferred from the Accident Department to the Life
Department Reserve Fund.
ADVANTAGES OF MUTUAL ASSURANCE
The large number of policies issued during the
year, of which approximately one-third were
taken out by existing members, is a demon-
stration of faith in the mutual system as well
as satisfaction with the Society’s administration.
It is important that progress should be maintained,
as the value of this service to the community
cannot be over-estimated. If you consider how
much spending power has been diverted to
savings in recent years through the Life Offices
you will realise its value in assisting to restrain
inflation. Unfortunately, other opposing forces
have so strained the national economy that the
Government has found it necessary to introduce
severe measures to counteract the drift. The
Society will continue to encourage thrift and self-
denial, which are necessary to provide security
for old age and a measure of protection against
the uncertainties of life. At a time of dis-
turbed economic conditions the special value
of a Life Assurance Policy stands out in bold
relief. Bearing in mind the increased amount
allowed in Income Tax Assessments, there are
very few investments which are superior to a
Life Assurance Policy, which combines an excel-
lent return with absolute safety.
STAFF
The splendid results of the past year were
in no small measure due to the loyal efforts of
the Staff. I cannot adequately express, on behalf
of the Board and myself, our real sense of grati-
tude and appreciation of the excellent service
rendered by all members of the Indoor and Field
Staffs.
Retiring Directors, Messrs. A. R. Stewart and
R. A. Rowe, and retiring Auditors, Messrs.
J. M. F. Relph and W. M. Scott, were re-elected.
13s. to 7s. 2d. in the market. At
the lower figure the return is 7
p.c. so long as the 10 p.c. distri-
bution continues. Net tangible
cover is approximately 7s. per
share.

During the 12 months covered
by the latest accounts, this big
Queensland gold-copper pro-
ducer greatly lengthened the life
of its mine, of which more will
be said presently, handled
bigger tonnages of both over-
burden and ore, with a con-
sequent better outturn of blister
and metals, but earned less
profit, owing to the steep rise in
costs. However, the forward-
looking board is adding another
string to the co.’s bow by pro-
duction of pyritic concentrates,
and the possibility of turning out
elemental sulphur is being closely
investigated.
Income and surplus for 1950
were inflated by a windfall profit
of £210,000 (which was tossed
into reserves) from gold unsold
when the price of the metal was
lifted in Sept., 1949. Leaving
this windfall out of the reckon-
ing, the increase in last term’s
income was £125,473. Includ-
ing £40,709 (down £2270) spent
on drilling and investigations
and £87,920 (up £16,352) allowed
for depreciation, exes, were
£146,213 heavier, due mainly to
wage-lifts. The surplus was thus
down £20,740 at £370,707, of
which £20,000 was placed to
capital redemption reserve,
£21,000 was passed to the staff
fund and £301,000 (same as
previous year) was distributed in
dividends (7 p.c. to the prefs.
and 80 p.c. to the ords.), leaving
£28,707 to carry forward.
Total material mined was
2,302,754 tons (up 254,148 tons),
of which 1,402,131 tons (up
247,057 tons) was waste over-
burden and 900,823 tons (up
15,019 tons) ore. There was
little change in the grade, and
the mills treated 864,900 tons (up
15,400 tons):

The ratio of overburden dumped

1.37 to one in 1950. Later on
the ratio is expected to rise to
two and a quarter to one, which
means the use of more shovels,
etc. two new ones are
scheduled to come into opera-
tion before June next.
From mill concentrates, etc.,
the smelter produced the follow-
ing results:

The blister is shipped to Port
Kembla for refining and treat-
ment.
Costs, with previous year’s
figures in parenthesis, were
mining ss. 6d, (ss. 4.3 d.) per ton,
milling 9s. 9.4 d. (7s. 6d.) per ton
and smelting £4B 2s. 7d.
(£39 18s. 2d.) per ton. The
incidence of labor costs falls
more heavily on the mills and
smelter because of weekend
penalty-rates ; the mine operates
on a five-day week basis.
The most important develop-
ment was virtual completion of
the testing of the Sugarloaf area,
and recalculation of total ore
reserves, now conservatively
shown at over double the figure
of a year or so ago. Here are
the details:
Cop-
Gold, per.

Sub-total ~ 8,464,000 2,79 1.21
Sugarloaf .. 6,850,000 2.60 1.02
Total .. ..15,314,000 2.70 1.02
Reserve ore is the balance
of the original 7,000,000 tons
which the co. set out to treat.
The filling and low-grade figures
are additional material which
has to be mined and which is
more economical to treat than
to discard. The Sugarloaf
tonnage excludes some
5.000. tons of pyritic
material on which no value can
be placed at the moment.
The Sugarloaf deposit is a
quartz - pyritic body about
1000 ft. long, 300 ft. wide and
400 ft. deep. The drill disclosed
9.000. tons assaying 2.3dwt.
gold, 0.6 p.c. copper and 12 p.c.
sulphur, and 3,000,000 tons
assaying o.3dwt. gold, 0.1 p.c.
copper and 12 p.c. sulphur. To
recover the 12,000,000 tons by
opencut would also entail
removal of 22,000,000 tons of
overburden. Exactly how much
overburden and ore can be re-
moved and treated at a profit
will finally depend upon metal
and sulphur prices and costs.
The locally-controlled price of
copper, which rose from £lBO to
£230 per ton during the 12
months covered by last accounts,
was recently lifted to £285 per
ton, and some benefit is expected
from sale of gold on the “free”
market, but costs threaten to
gobble most of the gains.
If the Queensland Government
goes ahead with its intention to
set up ammonium sulphate
works, large tonnages of pyritic
concentrates —now produced on
a small scale and sold to fertiliser
interests—will be called for.
The problem of producing
elemental sulphur is still being
examined, and so is the question
of additional capital for this and
other purposes, including the
overburden problem.
When the books closed current
assets totalled £1,258,850,
excluding provision for capital
redemption (£140,008), and
current liabilities amounted
to £468,201. The price of
the f.-p. 2s. 6d. ords. dropped
from 255. 9d, in June, 1951,
to 235. last week. At the
lower figure the return is 9.5 p.c.
on an 80 p.c. div, basis. At
20s. 6d. the £1 redeemable 7 p.c.
prefs. yield 6.8 p.c.
Western Queen (1936), N.L., a
small Perth concern which lost
most of its £30,000 of capital in
an unsuccessful hunt for payable
gold and other prospects in the
West, has been offered an option
over 574 acres, containing tin
and tantalite deposits, at Green-
bushes (W.A.) by the Green-
bushes Mineral Syndicate. The
purchase-price is £lO,OOO, to be
paid out of any profits won from
working the claims. A condi-
tion of the proposed option
agreement is that the co. raise
enough capital to equip and
work the property. So share-
holders are asked to increase
nominal capital to £60,000 by
creation of 600,000 new Is.
shares, of whch 300,000 are to
be offered at 3d. a nibble, and
the balance as required. The
chairman says geologist F. G.
Forman has reported favorably
on the proposition, which he
considers should be “highly
payable.” In the past, one of
the troubles on this field has
been the clayey nature of the
alluvium, which has given
rise to recovery problems.


Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Well, Christmas 1951 has come in with
the unique distinction that thousands of
youngsters all over the Commonwealth
have been told collectively and distinctly
that Father Christmas is only pretend.
The Kindergarten of the Air believes in
the truth, as we see it, and the author
of the devastating broadcast, Joan Len-
nartz, said that Christmas had become
too commercialised. All very laudable,
but how we are to put the wonder back
into the season by disillusioning those
who feel it most purely is somewhat
puzzling.
In “The Holly and the Ivy,” the play
by Wynyard Browne which the Metro-
politan players read at their Christmas-
party, one of the characters says that
Christmas means to most people that
“everything’s different, special,” and
another character says that Christmas
customs go back to the time when they
were making the calendar and stuck in
some extra days to fill up the gap be-
tween the lunar and the solar year—queer
sort of days, that shouldn’t really exist,
days on which anything might happen.
It is this magic quality that makes
Christmas what it is. To those who still
feel it and have kept it alive for the
youngsters, this Letter wishes a happy
Christmas with confidence.
The Metropolitan Players, by the way,
whose work has been most stimulating
during the year, kept up this spirit at
their party, despite the convergence of the
bus-and-tram strike and a thunderstorm.
Gwen Meredith compered the entertain-
ment, and the readers of the play
were Graham McDonald (who used
to be associated with the Rock-
hampton repertory theatre), Marcia
Hathaway, just returned from N.Z.,
where she has been acting with the
Commonwealth Players, Fernand Glynn,
Ken Hamman, Pat Schumann, Bea Wen-
ban, James Pratt and John Unicombe.
The party was also a farewell to clever
young Robin Lovejoy, who plans to take
his talents to England early in the New
Year.
During this Jubilee Year of 1951,
awards of all kinds have been made; —
for music, for art, for poetry, for radio-
plays, for billycart-racing, for play-
atting, for scene-setting, etc. But no
one has said a word about those skilled
in actual jubilation, the party-makers, the
socially competent, the entertainers. This
Letter here and now supplies the defi-
ciency—making awards for the best this
and that (strictly awards of honor, of
course, nothing so sordid as an actual
prize being considered).
The award for the best all-round ball
goes to the Naughty ’Nineties, because
the fun never flagged for a moment —
the floor-show was excellent, rapid and
proficient, decorations and dressing were
lively and the party-spirit was abroad.
The Black and White Ball gets the
award for having made the most money
and being the best-dressed in a special
way. It missed the top award because it
was 100 crowded.
Best-dressed in a general way was the
Medical Ball. Award for gathering to-
gether the greatest number of beautiful
young girls, beautifully-dressed, is won
by the Golden Ball.
Best floral arrangements were seen at
the Lady Mayoress’s Ball, with its banks
whereon the apple-blossom grew.
Most beautifully decorated table noted
during the year was Lady Stanham’s at
the Red Cross Ball, arranged, one
believes, by Mrs. Jocelyn Browne.
No award can be made for the best
supper at a ball as none of them reached
the required standard. For a dance, how-
ever, the spread put on by the Wine
Producers on the Kalang would be hard
to excel, and for a reception there was
nothing to equal the quality and presen-
tation of the food at the University
Women’s Union party in the Great Hall,
where 750 guests were catered for; a
special handclap goes to those who
prepared the feast.
For pageantry efficiently presented, the
Royal Empire Ball wins the award. The
colorful display at the International Ball
was a competitor, but it was rather
uneven, and prolonged a little beyond
the point of enjoyment. Most people go
to dances to dance. A floor-show has to
be something extra-special to distract
them for long, which is something that
committees might remember.
The most brilliantly-dressed first-night
audiences were those at the National
Opera. The greatest treat in the theatrical
line was the long season of the
Borovansky Ballet. The outstanding play
was “King Lear.” The best official
entertainment for the Jubilee was the
fireworks, although some people said they
couldn’t make out what the procession of
boats was all about.
The Royal Empire Society wins a
second award with its reception to the
Lord Mayor of London, whose magni-
ficence was rivalled only by those
“tremendous swells,” the legal delegates.
Silliest display of the year was put on
(it is said with shame) by the Press when
the Caronia berthed in Sydney.
Cutest money-raising project was the
exhibition of rejects from the Archibald
Prize competition. It pleased the painters,
gave some entertainment and made
money for Wybalena.
There were several good mannequin-
parades during the year, the best being
the Sydney Day Nurseries show at the
A.C.I. ballroom, when really, truly
French models were seen along with the
clothes of Germaine Rocher and
Henriette Lamotte. The most entertain-
ing parade was staged by the girls of
Sancta Sophia College, and featured
fashions from 1926 to the present day.
There were many distinguished women
visitors during the year: Dr. Jeanne Eder
from Switzerland, Lady Cooper for the
Girl Guides, Marjorie Lawrence, Lady
Stratheden and Campbell, the Countess
of Albemarle, Mrs, Fisher, wife of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Mrs.
Raymond Sayre for the C.W.A., Dr.
Margaret Mead, Lady Hermione Cobbold
(whose husband is governor of the Bank
of England), Ngaio Marsh (what hap-
pened to her projected season of plays,
by the way?) and Madge Elliott.
Mrs. Raymond Sayre was the most
pungent speaker heard during the year.
The Countess of Albemarle and Mrs.
Fisher are also remembered with admira-
tion. The most entertaining speaker was
Dr. Margaret Mead.

Nivison. June has just announced
her engagement to Evan Barnet, who is
the son of Mrs. Gladys Barnet, of Burren
Junction. June comes from Mirani,

To toast the health of all the year’s
award-winners this Letter suggests some
New Year noggins. The first is a charm-
ing concoction: Mint moselle. You
bruise a sizeable sprig of mint in the
bottom of the biggest tumbler money
can buy, add two or three tablespoons of
crushed ice and fill up with equal parts
of well-chilled Australian moselle and
equally well-chilled sodawater. It is
stimulating, either dry or with a little
sugar or maraschino added.
A champagne cup is an attractive
alternative. It is made by adding a
liqueur-glass of brandy or Curasao to the
juice of a small lemon, half-filling a jug
with ice-blocks and adding a bottle of
Australian champagne and a few slices of
orange, lemon or peaches.
Or perhaps a wine syllabub? This is
an old-fashioned mixture with quite
modern effects, and it consists of a quart
of cream, three cups of white wine (such
as Australian sauterne, chablis or hock),
the juice of two large oranges, the juice
of one lemon, and sugar to taste. The
mixture is beaten, the froth skimmed off
as it rises, and then it’s put into glasses.
Whether you call it King’s Peg or
Rajah’s Peg, a large glass of champagne
—chilled —laced with a liqueur-glass of
brandy makes a nectar for the most
discegiing.
“Thunder and Lightning” by name, but
not necessarily in effect, is the combina-
tion of a glass of brandy, an egg-yolk,
and a teaspoonful of powdered sugar,
shaken, poured out and served with a
dash of Cayenne-pepper on top.
From Melbourne
Some say that ever ’gainst that season
comes
Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night
long;
And then they say, no spirit can walk
abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no
. planets strike.
No fairy takes, no witch hath power to
charm ;
So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.
—Shakspeare.
Workers and shoppers wending their
way home at the end of a day were
cheered with Christmas carols which
floated over the city from a Collins-
street church. Another innovation was
the large gaily-decked Christmas-tree
which stood in the grounds of another
Collins-street church. Passers-by were
asked to leave a small gift at the foot of
the tree for those whose Yuletide festi-
vities were dependent upon the generosity
of others.
The very attractive subject of this
Athol Shmith study is Jill Daveron,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. J. Tredin-
nick, of St. Kilda. Jill, who reigns over
a smart boutique in Collins-street, was,
before graduating into the fashion world,
assistant to the Public Relations Officer
and also to the Advertising Director
of A.N.A. During the war years
she also found time to work on several
committees assisting servicemen and
-women. First-nights at theatre and the
celebrity concerts are Jill’s favorite form
of relaxation.
Cards this year have been of good
artistic standard. A lovely replica of a
Conrad Martens painting of Sydney
Harbor in the middle of last century
decorated the card sent out by
Sir Leslie and Lady McConnan,
the Town Hall’s exterior and interior
were pictured on the Lord Mayor’s
card, A.N.A. used the ruins and
surroundings of Port Arthur for its
beautiful greeting-card. An etching of
Prince’s Bridge and the city skyline
embellished the card sent out by Mr. and
Mrs. Les Coleman, whilst Councillor and
Mrs. Gordon Coulter’s original card
pictured their lovely garden with the
Yarra flowing in the background.
When guests arrived at the Toorak
home of Colonel Rufus Ramey, U.S.
Military Attache, and Mrs. Ramey they
were greeted with a red-ribbon-tied
holly-wreath on the front-door. Inside,
the reception-rooms repeated the holly
motif, whilst large bowls of red gladioli
and white Christmas-lilies were set about.
Receiving her guests, who included Sir
John and Lady Latham and Sir Charles
and Lady Lowe, Mrs. Ramey wore a
silk frock of pastel-green patterned in
light-brown etchings of skyscrapers. Her
daughter Miriam’s wide-skirted frock was
of jade-green taffeta, Mrs. Richard
Denbo chose a slim-fitting frock of black
crepe. Mrs. James Clarke’s unusual black
satin frock featured a blouse and over-
skirt of black tulle. Black organza was
the choice of Mrs, George Uhrich. Mrs.
Bruce Rose’s frock was of scarlet velvet.
Mrs. Graham Egerton’s dove-grey
chiffons had a swirling pleated skirt. Mrs.
Les Edwards topped her navy faille
jacket-suit with a picture-hat of grey
straw, the edge of the brim being out-
lined with a pleated tulle frill.
At the pre-Christmas buffet-luncheon
which Mrs. Saul Aarons gave at her
Caulfield home to about 30 friends fare-
wells were said to the guest-of-honor,
Mrs. Alan Bernaldo, who, with her artist
husband, leaves early in the year in the
Roma for a visit to Italy, Spain and
Portugal, where Alan intends to paint
extensively. The hostess wore a black crepe
frock unadorned save for one sapphire
clip. Black was also chosen by Mrs.
Bernaldo, but was contrasted with a
cloche of grey-and-white-striped taffeta.
A large emerald shiny straw hat was worn
by Mrs. Norman Lynch with a slim-
fitting black satin frock. Mrs. J. Lang-
ley’s grey frock was patterned in citron-
yellow brocade. Lattice-work embellished
the short sleeves of the black frock worn
by Mrs. D. Harlem with an upturned
black hat. Mrs. W. McDermott’s jacket-
suit was mist-blue. Mrs. George Haines’s
French beige frock had collar and pockets
of matching guipure lace ; her large hat
of scarlet straw carried navy veiling. Mrs.
H. Silk wore a green-straw coolie hat
with her black-silk frock.
Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Buxton, of
Armadale, and their daughters Beverley
and Carolyn are home again after a
seven-months’ trip overseas. While in
Rome they attended an open-air perform-
ance of “La Traviata” ; in England they
watched the running of the Royal Ascot
Gold Cup. They flew home through
Canada and the U.S. With daughter and
son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Ross Batten,
and their children, Kristen, Mary, John
and Damien, the entire Buxton family
will spend the Christmas holidays at
Glynt, their Mt. Martha home.
An invitation in humorous verse came
from the directors of the Little Theatre,
Brett and Peter Randall, and the Theatre
Players’ Club, of which Les Phillips is
president, for the party they threw.
There were guests from all the current
shows, the ballet and radio, and practi-
cally everyone who has trodden the
boards of the Little Theatre in produc-
tions this year turned up and had a super
time.
When the Strathaird sails on Christ-
mas Eve, among the passengers will be
Dr. and Mrs. Ivan Maxwell, who are
going to England for the marriage of
their daughter Rosemary at the Savoy
Chapel on February 22 to Max Henry
Fisher, an Oxford graduate. Rosemary
has been in England for two and a half
years studying art, and has qualified for
a London County Council Diploma.
Matron-of-honor will be Mrs. Patrick
Holmes, for whom Rosemary was brides-
maid when she married in England.
Early in the new year a small selection-
committee will begin a drive to collect
antique furniture, china, glass and silver
from the homes of their friends for the
exhibition which will be held in the Town
Hall from March 14 to 25. Funds raised
will support the British Memorial Fund
and the Y.W.C.A. Plans for this were
made at a meeting at the Toorak home
of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Nelken. Lady
Brooks, who is patroness of the function,
was accompanied by Betty Everard.
Louis Nelken is president and chairman
of the committee and office-bearers in-
clude Lady Brookes, Lady Gullett, Lady
Murdoch, Lady Knox, Mrs. Essington
Lewis, Sir Norman Mighell, Sir Keith
Murdoch, Prof. J. Burke and the Hon.
Simon Warrender. Mrs. Arnold Isaacson
and Joyce Truelove are joint hon. secre-
taries and the joint hon. treasurers are
Brigadier H. C. Bundock and Mrs. Jim
Fitzgerald. To make the exhibition one
of the best ever to be seen in this city,
the committee decided at the meeting to
write to Queen Mary, Countess Mount-
batten, Lady Gowrie, Lady Dugan and
Lord Huntingfield, asking that something
from their collection of treasures be
loaned for the occasion.
Claridge’s, in South Yarra, was filled
with pretty little girls in fluffy party-
frocks and little boys scrubbed and
polished when Walter Ebstein was host
at his annual Christmas-party. Father
Christmas and Charlie Chaplin shared
entertainment honors, and the youngsters
and their parents had a wonderful time.
Mrs. Andrew Manifold, with daughters
Elizabeth and Prudence, shared a table
with Major and Mrs. Dick Noone and
their tiny daughter Anne, and the
Russell Coldhams, who brought daughters
Catherine and Rosemary. With Dr. and
Mrs. J. Buchanan were daughters Rosslyn
and Rowena. Colonel and Mrs. Frank
Gillespie had their sons Jamie, Michael
and Frankie to cope with. So that small
Michael would not be trodden on in the
dance, Mrs. Ebstein carried him, while
his small twin sister Mary Louise danced
with father. A very excited Levida was
with her mother, Mrs. Norman Lynch,
while Mrs. Jack Lynch was accompanied
by her two, Denise and Robin. Neville
Day, a young Scotch Collegian, danced
with his mother, Mrs. Constance Day,
and sister Deanna, while John Curtain
shared his favors with his mother, Mrs.
C. Curtain, and the girls in the party.
Peter and Mary Jane Gebhart, with
Charles McMillan, enjoyed the fun and
games, while Louis Mendes, a young
barrister, played host to Anne Freedman,
Edwina Avery and Lyn Graham.

PERSONAL ITEMS
The strafing attentions of a Fritz air-
man in War I decided the career of
Frank Penny, Shell’s assistant chief
aviation officer for Australia, now due
for slippered ease. A foot-slogger
in the old 38th Battalion, Penny decided
after the strafing that life might be better
upstairs, and transferred to the R.F.C.
He returned the earlier strafing with
interest, tackling a Zeppelin and later
successfully bombing a surfaced U-boat,
After the Armistice Penny got into Shell,
at a time when a couple of four-gallon
drums would service all the aircraft on
Essendon aerodrome. Now the monsters
drink about 400,000 gallons a month. An
athlete of mark in his youth, Penny in
1919 represented the R.A.F. at the inter-
services championships sports-meeting at
Stamford Bridge, winning the high-jump
with a leap of sft. llin. His son was
in the R.A.F. in Hitler’s show.

rifle-shot in his youth, he was in the team
which twice won the Empire Shooting
Match, He’s usually to be found these
days operating his motorboat on Moreton
Bay.
After half a century with Adelaide
Steam, g.-m. Guy Packard reckons he’s
had a long enough trick at the wheel.
Son of a solicitor at Kooringa, in South
Australia’s mid-north, young Packard
looked like soliciting as well, but after a
brief term in an Adelaide legal firm he
decided, in 1901, on setting his course
with the yellow-and-black funnel. He’s
been with the co. ever since, except for
a break with the old 50th Battalion in
Wilhelm’s war. A golfer of class in his
day—first champion of Adelaide’s
Kooyonga Club —he makes a science of
bridge.
“M.”; Britain lost one of its most read-
able war-historians when Hilary St.
George Saunders reached the Last Page
at Nassau, in the Bahamas. Under the
pen-names Francis Beeding and David
Pilgrim he had hidden his authorship of
a dozen or so well-known whodunits,
and it was not till after Hitler’s war that
the anonymity of the author of the
world-famed official publications on the
Island’s war effort was broken. Saunders
used a restrained, ironically humorous
style, peculiarly suited to the airmen,
sailors and commandos whose valiant
deeds he recorded. The Battle of Britain,
East of Malta, West of Suez (the Navy’s
doings in the Mediterranean, including
Australian destroyer Stuart’s hefty effort
at Matapan), and Combined Operations
were some of the war-time writings par-
ticularly appreciated by servicemen for
their factual accuracy and lack of bally-
hoo. After the war Saunders put very
readably between covers the history of
the paratroopers ( The Red Beret) and of
the commandos ( The Green Beret), this
time both under his own name. Apart
from literary ability he was well-fitted for
war-writing, having served in the Welsh
Guards in War 1, winning M.C., and
having been, after the following scrap,
librarian of the House of Commons, with
all the access to battle-reports that implies.
He was 53.
Arthur M. Loew, on a flying visit to
Melbourne, has two interests —the cinema
and tennis. As the power behind Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer and president of Loew’s
International Corporation, he is an old
hand at the films game; and as a one-
time champion American tennis-player
he knows one end of a racquet from the
other. While in Melbourne he arranged
a doubles challenge-match through Frank
Shields, American Davis Cup team man-
ager, with three other businessmen—all
one-time tennis stars.
“Trinco”: Humor, like genius, is nine-
tenths hard work. Even his most virulent
critics—and he had plenty—conceded that
“New Yorker” editor Harold Ross’s
energy was in the explosive class. The
creator of America’s most brilliantly and
subtly humorous magazine—“use the
rapier, not the bludgeon,” was his
favorite advice to his writers—was born
at Aspen, Colorado, with, as his grocer-
uncle told him, little else but a talent for
breaking things. This ability was so
marked in the grocery-shop that his
uncle suggested he get a job in the mines
as a dynamiter. Ross went to work
instead for the Salt Lake City “Tribune,”
and by 1917, when Uncle Sam came in,
he had worked his way through
uncounted newspaper-offices as far west
as California. While in an officers’ train-
ing school in France Ross heard of plans
to start the “Stars and Stripes”; he
rapidly worked himself down to a private
and got himself transferred to its office
in Paris. Here he met Sergeant Alexander
Woollcott, who had also just joined the
staff. Managing-editor at the Armistice,
Ross returned to the States to edit three
short-lived magazines; his fourth, the
“New Yorker,” hit the stands on
February 12, 1925. Though there was
much in the early issues which struggled
and groaned to be funny, under Ross’s
driving competence, and such writers as
Alice Duer Miller (of White Cliffs),
Dorothy Parker and Woollcott, the
magazine began to click and all the pain
was over. Ross died in Boston, aged 59.
Back in Melbourne after an adven-
turous 5000-mile small-boat voyage, Tony
Pratt, the 38-year-old commander of the
crash-launch he took from Sydney to
Cocos Island in October. The coral atoll,
whose only communication with the out-
side world, apart from cables, used to
be the barrel of fresh food and letters
that P. and O. captains dropped for the
cablemen to pick up, will soon have a
fortnightly courier air-mail service from
Fremantle. Hundreds of men are turning
the coral into an efficient air-port, and in
six months’ time it will be first stop on
the Australia-South Africa air-service.
Pratt is an ex-submariner of the Royal
Navy.
Boss of Schute Bell Badgery Lumby,
Ltd., K. P, Badgery, who has been in
the wool and stock game for 50 years, is
calling it a day. An old Homebush
(Sydney) selling-man, and Glebe Island
before that, he will remain on the firm’s
directorate, where his advice is rated true
Merino. His father, the late Henry
Badgery, prominent in the wool trade
of the ’eighties, was a foundation partner
of the present firm of Pitt Son and
Badgery. Mick’s colleagues have presented
to him the gavel with which Schute Bells
have knocked down clients’ wool to the
value of more than £6O million.
After 53 years in Queensland —inter-
rupted by three years abroad on
Wilhelm’s business —Ted Smout, Pruden-
tial's State manager for the past 13 years,
comes south to Sydney, agency-manager
for Australia and New Zealand, Widely-
known and liked in Brisbane Rotary and
Legacy circles, Smout has held down two
vice-presidencies—Brisbane Chamber of
Commerce and Queensland Game Fishing
Association. He qualified for the latter
post with numerous sojourns to the Reef,
and at the flick of a line will launch into
enthusiastic acclaim of its attractions. In
Hitler’s war he did an energetic job of
chairing the Red Cross publicity-
campaign.
Westralia’s Rhodes Scholar, J. R. Hall,
has only just qualified as a voter. Six
distinctions in the leaving from Perth
Modern School gained him a Government
Exhibition, which he took out in the
Science School of the University, special-
ising in chemistry. Outside the labora-
tory, he represented Westralia in the inter-
Varsity hockey team in 1948. His chief
academic achievement, besides taking his
B.Sc. degree, was the winning, this year,
of the Masson Memorial Scholarship,
awarded annually by the Royal Australian
Chemical Institute for competition among

known as the Gouy diffusiometer, claimed
to be one of the few in the world. It is
used in the study of diffusion of

Coventrated hereunder, Edgar Clynton
Spooner, dark, dapper and with enough
energy to turn a spark-plug green, is
more like a successful salesman than what
he is—Adelaide University’s Professor of
Mining and Metallurgy. His liveliness
accounted for a Tasmanian Rhodes
Scholarship (1931), doctorates of Science
and Philosophy, and a Bachelorship of
Engineering. Leaving Oxford, Spooner
worked in England, Spain and America
as technical adviser and researcher for
several big metal industries, and was, for
a time, consultant for a Jewish banker in
London. Recently appointed to the
Adelaide ’Varsity Council, he is vice-

“Macnell”: Dubois has limned to the life
the quizzical casualness characterising Lt.-
Commander Alan Swanton, of carrier Glory,
soon to be Korea-bound. Casual only in
appearance, Swanton leads Glory’s Firefly
squadron, and is up to his neck in training,
for grimmer work, the new batch of Firefliers
sent to him from the Old Dart. The replace-
ments could not be better serviced in their
trainer —Swanton having had a sizeable share
in establishing the sortie-records Glory left
behind for Sydney to tackle over Korea. He’d
already done his share in the recent war. 1
FIREFLIER.
mentioned, in passing, The Bulletin’s recording
of the Bismarck hunt; Swanton showed interest.
“Why?” “Oh, nothing particular,” he grinned.
“Except that I managed to get rather a good
look at her.” “How was that?” “I happened
to be in the Swordfish team which torpedoed
her.” After that effort Swanton had two years
of night-bombing over the Western Desert, then
shipped in carrier Implacable. Here he had a
rather good look at another German battleship
—from one of the Navy’s Barracfidas which
bombed Tirpitz in her Norwegian fjord hideout.
Still in Implacable, he came to Australia to
join the British Pacific Fleet based on the
Admiralties. While on a strike at Japan
Swanton had an experience he’s not likely to
forget. He took off in his bombed-up Avenger,
failed to rise, and plunged into the sea ahead
of Implacable. Struggling from the cockpit he
watched the carrier’s towering bow drive down
upon him. It struck the Avenger and clove it
in two. With all his experience, Swanton
reckons he’s never worked so hard in his life
as he did in Korea. In War II a naval pilot’s
average was one sortie a month; up there, in
59 flying days, each averaged 70 sorties.
The interests of consuls usually centre
on exchange of goods and trade-relations;
with F. J. Berger, recently appointed
honorary consul for Austria in Mel-
bourne—the first since War ll—it’s
different. He wants to see an exchange
of artists and musicians, and even
visualises the Vienna Philharmonic and
Opera giving an Australian season while
their Australian opposite-numbers per-
form in the waltz city. A manufacturer,
Berger came to Australia before the late
war, and was naturalised in 1943.
Into the Silence:

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Multiplication.
“Loulalo”: The idea of
making two blades of grass grow
where one grew before has been
applied to the poor old sheep.
Scientists at Rothamsted Re-
search Station (Eng.) have built
up a crop of crossbred ewes that
can mother four lambs at once.
It is not clear whether the ewes’
udders have four teats or exactly
how the mothering is done. One
often finds a ewe with a couple
of rudimentary teats, so I sup-
pose it could be achieved. We
had an old cow some years ago
with six quarters. The two hind-
most quarters (or should it be
sixths?) were very small, but
they did yield milk, and prob-
ably constant manipulation
would have developed them had
anyone the patience to do it.
A Cambridge expert. Dr. Neil
Yeates, has been conducting
experiments to speed up breed-
ing. He evolved the theory that
light is the chief factor regulat-
ing lambing. Herding a flock
of ewes in a special pen he be-
gan decreasing the light in
spring until, by midsummer, his
day was as short as in mid-
winter. Then he began to
lengthen out the light until by
autumn the days were equal in
light value to those of spring
and the e\ves were in lamb. The
Iambs produced were smaller
and less frisky than the spring-
time ones, but rapidly develop
to normal.
As experiments go, it is
interesting but not very practical.
And the report 1 read did not
make it clear whether the rams
were kept with the ewes or if
artificial insemination was used.
I’d imagine the sire was
important, too.
Anyway, every flock has its
freaks, and some ewes are
naturally more prolific than
others. We have one who has
mothered three lambs in 18
months. We are keeping an eye
on her and on the females
among her progeny in the hope
that they inherit her profitable
tendency. She gets no more light
or diet than her sisters. I’d say
it’s some chance combination of
genes. The experts may know
better.
How Times Change.
“Merv”: Methods of rabbit-
control advocated by “Ngaduri”
(B. 28/ll/’51) are mainly good,
but his plea to “allow no
trappers” will fall on deaf ears
at present.
While rabbitskin prices were
booming many trappers were put
off from their usual runs here
in Victoria, and it was amazing
how many “hard - worked”
farmers found time to trap their
own properties.
Even men with 4000 or 5000
sheep found it easy to get rid
of their own rabbits without out-
side help. Many farmers openly
claimed all rabbits on their own
land and took care that no one
else caught any. Even the kids
with a pet foxy and a couple of
ferrets were kicked out.
How things have changed
now! The farmer is looking for
the trapper. He no longer
claims the rabbits. Now it’s
“come and trap all my paddocks.
Smith’s rabbits are eating me
out.”
The all-out myxo campaign
has been (at least in this district)
a failure. Here it failed to
account for even one rabbit.
The only property free from
rabbits here is owned by a
grazier who became scared stiff
over the myxo and thoroughly
fumigated his land before the
disease could possibly have
reached it.
Foul-brood in Bees.
“F.A.S.”; This extract from
an American book on bees (the
disease is called American foul-
brood) may assist “Soc’s” bee-
herders (B. 5/12/’51):
Foul-brood is a contagious
disease caused by bacteria. Its
presence is shown by the bees
becoming languid, by dark,
stringy and elastic masses found
“Very refined type of bullock—pulls better with
ear-mufflers.”
in the bottom of the cells, the
cell-caps sunken or irregularly
punctured. Frequently there is
a peculiar offensive odor.
Prompt removal of diseased
colonies, their transfer to clean
and thoroughly disinfected hives
and feeding on antiseptically-
treated honey or syrup are
means for prevention and cure.
The antiseptics used are sali-
cylic acid, carbolic acid or
formic acid. Spraying the brood
with any one of these in a solu-
tion and feeding with a honey
or syrup medicated with them
will usually be all that is
required by way of treatment.
It is said that access to salt
water is important for the health
of bees.
Botulism.
“A-Jay”: The symptoms vary
greatly in sheep. In mild cases
a sheep will leave the remainder
of the flock and lie down; it
may recover in a few days. In
more severe cases, if left undis-
turbed, it may die from 24
hours upwards. If disturbed
and able to rise it will be
noticed that it moves with an
irregular, unsteady, stiff gait, the
head appears to wobble uncon-
trollably and it runs into things
as if blind. Treatment of
affected sheep is not advised, but
if desired would consist of an
effective purgative followed by
stimulants and careful nursing.
In cattle bone-chewing is a
predisposing factor. The aver-
age case may last from three to
five days after first symptoms.
Lassitude, drowsiness and slob-
bering are first noticed. More
acute cases may die in a few
hours.
First consideration is a quick-
acting purgative. A hypodermic
injection of a solution contain-
ing one to two grains of areco-
line hydrobromide is usually
effective. Following this a suit-
able stimulant is necessary, and
for this 2drms. of nux vomica
and 2drms. of ammonium car-
bonate mixed with treacle and
pasted on the back of the tongue
two or three times daily is
recommended.
The most important factor in
preventing botulism is provi-
sion of adequate and properly-
balance food-supplies through-
out the year. All bones and por-
tions of carcasses should be
burnt. Where bone-chewing is
common a lick consisting of 70
to 80 p.c. of common salt and
20 to 30 p.c. of bonemeal is use-
ful. Fodder damaged by mice,
moulds or moisture should not
be fed to stock. Botulism is not
contagious.
Preserving Fence-posts.
“Sundowner”: Tests by the
C.5.1.R.0. prove that a mixture
of creosote and crude oil is still
the most effective and easiest
preservative for, fence-posts.
However, the slight advantage
the creosote combination has
over zinc chloride-arsenic is
nearly balanced by the difference
in price. Experiments revealed
that only 1 p.c. of creosote-
treated posts failed while 3 p.c.
were badly attacked. The
respective figures for zinc were
3 and 4 p.c.
Research indicated that the
presence of seasoned sapwood
in round posts is essential to
success. With sawn or split posts
sapwood is partly or wholly
eliminated and the heartwood of
Australian timbers will then only
absorb preservative if treatment
is carried out with expensive
high-pressure plants.
In using creosote, place butts
of posts downward in a 44-
gallon drum and treat in a mix-
ture of two parts creosote and
one part crude oil up to 30 in.
of butt length. Mixture should
be heated for two to four hours
at a temperature of 200 degrees
Fahrenheit and then posts
allowed to cool down in the
drum or transferred to a second
drum containing the same height
of cold preservative.
Breeding Better Bees.
“Drone B.”: The bee-breeder
has a very nebulous idea of
what he should aim at. The
term high productivity is used
by some to cover the multitude
of factors involved, many of
which are little known and even
less understood. Desirable fac-
tors are docility, laying capacity
of queen and swarming tend-
ency.
It is obvious that the more
tractable the bees the more eco-
nomically and efficiently can the
apiarist perform his duties. One
strong colony of bees is worth
more than two weak ones.
Strength of the colony depends
to a large extent on the laying
capacity of the queen. The
tendency of bees to swarm is
a hereditary trait which
apiarists can only try to mini-
mise by wise management, but
which at the present time cannot
be eliminated. These three
points are relatively easily
assessed in a hive, and the most
desirable types can be selected
out for breeding for these
points.
Of the genetic factors which
affect the actual honey-gather-
ing activities of bees practically
nothing is known. No out-
wardly obvious characteristics
(with the exception, perhaps, of
tongue length) will give any
indication of the ability of a
worker bee to gather nectar or
pollen. Even if such character-
istics were available they could
be completely masked by even
slight environmental vagaries
( e.g weather conditions during
a honey-flow).
Again, the bee-breeder’s raw
material is of an entirely dif-
ferent nature from that en-
countered in everyday animal
production. The cattle-breeder,
for instance, can select indi-
viduals on their merits and
breed from them. The bee-
breeder, on the other hand, has
been unable to do this with
any certainty. Until the advent
of instrumental insemination
techniques breeding of bees was
quite promiscuous. Isolation
was the only means of retaining
any degree of purity in a line
of bees, and even then a large
element of doubt as to absolute
isolation existed. Instrumental
insemination has proved to be
a big step forward, and has
opened the door for scientists
to enter the field of bee genetics
in earnest.
Another complication is the
fact that the queen is the mother
of all the bees in the hive, and
the merest trace of crossbreed-
ing will produce a large amount
of variation in the worker and
drone progeny. Again the
female bees (queens and
workers) are diploid individuals,
i.e., they have the double set of
body chromosomes, whilst the
male (drones), being haploid
individuals, have only a single
set of body chromosomes, and
may be considered as living
germ cells. This arises from
the fact that the drone is pro-
duced from an unfertilised egg.
This phenomenon is known as
parthenogenesis, and is found in
other insects.
Where a queen is actually
pure-bred all her drone progeny
should be pure as their
hereditary factors are derived
from the queen alone (i.e., they
have no father). The workers,
on the other hand, derive their
heredity from the queen and
from one or more drones (i.e.,
they have maternal and paternal
factors mixed). This applies
also to queens, and leads to the
result that, given a pure-bred
queen mated to one of her own
drones, the chances are that she
will produce a pure-bred
daughter queen. The progeny
from this queen will then depend
on how she is mated.
Under the conditions experi-
enced by commercial apiarists
in this country the possibility of
obtaining such purity is rather
remote. This is where the value
of instrumental insemination is
felt, and without it the chances
of producing improved strains
of bees are very remote.
The commercial apiarist is not
able to indulge to any extent in
such breeding programmes, nor
is he likely to obtain the neces-
sary skill to operate in the field
of instrumental insemination.
This must be left to agriculture
departments, universities and
similar bodies. This work is
important not only from the
apiarist’s point of view, but, in
so far as pollination is con-
cerned, that of every other
farmer. Apiarists should urge
upon their agriculture depart-
ments the necessity and import-
ance of this work and try to
induce them to initiate such
programmes of breeding and
genetic research with co-opera-
tion and co-ordination between
the States.
Breeding Pure Polls.
“O utb a c k”: Dr. John
Hammond, C.8.E., outlining the
history of polled cattle, contends
that, using our knowledge of the
Mendelian laws of inheritance,
it should be possible to produce
pure polled strains of any breed
of cattle without losing the
characteristics of the breed.
Describing methods of pro-
ducing polled types by cross-
breeding with a polled breed
and then grading-up back to the
original breed, Hammond states
that polled and horned charac-
teristics were inherited without
blending, but the commercial
qualities were inherited in a
blending fashion.
In the first cross between a
Red Poll and an Ayrshire, 100
per cent, of progeny were
polled, and offspring were 50
per cent. Ayrshire type; the
polled offspring mated back to
the Ayrshire would be 50 per
cent, polled and 75 per cent.
Ayrshire type; when the polled
offspring of this cross were
mated back to the Ayrshire
again, 50 per cent would still
be polled, but they would be
87| per cent. Ayrshire type.
By mating the polled offspring
back to the Ayrshire for two
more generations, the result
would be offspring which were
97i per cent. Ayrshire type and
half of them would be polled.
When a high percentage of the
true breed characters had been
attained in this way the next
problem was getting the polled
offspring to breed true for
polledness. This was done by
mating bulls and cows of the
polled grades together, when one
in three of the polled offspring
would breed true to this
character. To obtain true breed-
ing it was quickest and most
economical to pick out the one
in three of the polled bulls which
would breed true. Some indica-
tion of whether or not they were
likely to breed true would be
found (in the bulls, but not in
the cows) by the absence of
scurs, as bulls which were
heterozygous for horned (or not
breeding true for polled) would
have scurs.
After selection of the bulls on

this basis, it was advisable to
make quite certain by doing a
progeny test on the bulls betore
they were used for pure breed-
ing. The young bull was mated
to five or 10 horned cows, and
if, without exception, all the off-
spring were polled, then the bull
would breed true, but if even
only one horned calf was found
among the offspring, the bull
should be rejected for further
pure breeding.
Farm Fish-ponds.
“Piscator”: A fish-pond on a
U.S.A. farm is not a muddy
waterhole defiled by the tramp-
ling and fouling of stock. Such
a “pond” may not even be suit-
able for frogs. Even where a
pond of somewhat clearer water
could be provided by the ex-
clusion of stock, and by grassy
slopes or waterways as the catch-
ment or intake, with overhang-
ing trees for some shade, there
are many other requirements for
even elementary fish-farming.
Fish production, like any other
form of wild life, depends
largely upon greater eats smaller,
and a range of such fish life is
required if much fish food is to
be obtained from a pond. Such
a range of worth-while edible
fish, suitable for still water, does
not exist in Australia.
Coming to the somewhat more
hopeful prospect of fish-farming
in a dam in a perpetually-
running stream, in better-watered
country, the stocking with baby
fish is the difficult problem. At
the present time, there are not
even enough fish being hatched
and supplied regularly to our
main river systems to keep them
in good condition in this regard.
Transplanting Seedlings.
“Myrrhee”: Use only well-
developed seedlings and plant in
the cool of evening with as much
soil as possible about the roots.
For convenience in planting,
arrange tall seedlings such as
cabbage, cauliflower and onion,
in a bundle so that the bases of
their stems are level. Then,
with one cut of a sharp knife,
trim the roots to a uniform
length.
Correct depth of planting is
important; too deep or too
shallow is equally undesirable.
For most seedlings the stem of
the lowest leaf should be at
ground-level. Firm soil around
the plants, and water with a
solution of \oz. sulphate of
ammonia or nitrate of soda and
loz. superphosphate to the
gallon of water. In hot weather
provide some shelter for the
transplants until they have taken
root.
Plugging In Stone.
“Mulho”: In brick walls put
small plugs in the mortar. Drill
the hole to take the plug with a
small cold-chisel or stone-bit and
cut the plug square and about an
inch longer than required, to
allow for bruising when it is
driven in. Pare off the comers
of the front end, drive in and
then saw off flush with the wall.
Larger plugs should go as near
the centre of a brick as possible.
Drill the hole with a downward
cant and slightly larger towards
the back. Cut the plug round
and drill a hole down its centre.
Drive it in, and then drive in a
second “spreader” plug to firm
it into the back of the hole.
In concrete or stone walls
cementing-in plugs makes a
better job. In this case the plug
should be cut square. Chop off
two adjacent corners to give it
a semi-triangular shape. The
inside of the hole should be
roughed, washed out and dusted
with raw cement. Cement the
plug in with the T-shaped end
innermost.
When plugging a wall or
floor to take a partition, see that
each plug goes right through
one of the bearers or the sole-
plate of the partition. After
each plug has been firmed with
a spreader-plug or two or three
nails, which will serve the same
purpose, screw or tack a thin
piece of wood or hoop-iron over
it to prevent its being worked
loose by vibration.
Drought and Sheep.
“Rom Ney”: After a study of ■
50 years of rain and general
weather records in Queensland
sheep country, G. R. Moule
offers this plan for handling
sheep in dry seasons:
In northern sheep areas, if
effective rains have not fallen
by April, graziers should sell to
reduce numbers before prices
fall, seek agistment and buy feed
before fodder prices rise. Past
experience indicates that it is not
worth continuing to feed later
than March of the following
year.
In southern areas, where
winter rainfall is much more
reliable than in the north, the
position is not so clear. When
effective rains have not fallen by
April the grazier must decide
whether he will sell or gamble
on the chance of winter rain.
He must also decide whether he
is going to breed or not, but in
any case he would be wise to
buy feed and prepare for scrub-
cutting.
Hints for the Farm.
“Hortus”: When selecting
potato sets see that they are free
from “blisters” or galls. These
may contain female eel-worms
in cystic form.
“C.A.A.”: It is better to feed
calves something you produce
yourself than to buy foodstuffs.
They will do well and keep free
from disease if fed simply with
fresh milk diluted with slightly
warm water. Follow up with a
helping of chaff. This method
also saves mixing of foods,
“Broomstick”: When erecting
platforms for water-tanks site
the stand to allow 2ft. of clear-
ance from the nearest wall.
Tanks put within 6in., which
seems to be the usual thing, are
a curse to the painter, and when
leaks occur in the tank it is im-
possible to make a satisfactory
repair. Have just finished the
third country house-painting
job, and it took longer to pat and
stroke the paint behind the tank
than to do all the rest of that
wall.
“Rooster”; Eczema in dogs
may be confused with mange.
The latter usually has scurf or
scales, whereas eczema is indi-
cated by scabs. Wash the dog
first with strong Condy’s fluid
solution and smear with paste of
equal proportions of sulphur
and lard mixed with kerosene.
Apply twice a day. Clean the
residue off every day or two

THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
There has just appeared a new sunspot group which
will probably give the cyclical scattered storms due in
Christmas week, though up to then further heat is likely.
The Bruckner cycle shows rain over the greater part of
eastern Australia in January, which should be heavy in
the Tropic, but becoming moderate as it moves south, and
light in South Australia and West Australia. In W.A.
about the third week of January a “willy-willy” may appear
in the far north, near Onslow.

COLLEGE EDUCATION AND
SPECIAL TRAINING WITHOUT
COST TO PARENTS
Each year a considerable number of
boys and youths in their ’teens is
selected from applicants all over
Australia for education and training
to fit them for careers as Officers
in the Navy, the Army, or the Air
Force.
Every lad who is a British subject,
substantially of European descent
and domiciled in Australia, has, with
his parents’ consent, the right to
apply for entry into one of the great
Service Training Colleges the
Royal Australian Naval College,
Flinders Naval Depot, Victoria;
the Royal Military College, Dun-
troon, A.C.T.; or the Royal Aus-
tralian Air Force College, Point
Cook, Victoria.
They must qualify educationally
and medically. Selection is made
with regard to character, intelli-
gence, initiative, personality and
other attributes indicating that they
possess the necessary qualifications
for success as Officers in His
Majesty’s Forces. Those chosen
come from schools throughout the
Commonwealth both Government
and Private.
No parent or guardian can enter a
boy at any of these Colleges by
paying fees. Every boy admitted
to the College wins his place in
competition against other applicants
by intelligence, initiative, physique
and outstanding ability. The entire
education, training and upkeep of
these young men is undertaken by
the Commonwealth Government at
no cost whatever to parents. A
cash allowance or pocket money is
paid to all trainees and during leave
periods return fares arc provided
and living out allowances paid.
Opportunities for entry into the
Service Colleges occur at various
times throughout the year. The
ages for entry are:—
Navy 13 to 16J years. Army
and Air Force 16 to 19 years.

of money, and, anyway, who
would want to change an eco-
nomically valuable vegetable
into a silly old coach? And
how could anyone get six horses
all exactly alike? Have you
ever seen six horses all the
same? Of course you haven’t!
The whole thing is so silly. And
all of this was supposed to have
been made possible by a fairy
godmother just waving a wand.
“Now, I’m going to get you all
to make a test. Go and get a
pumpkin from Daddy’s garden,
or wait till the next time
Mummy buys one from a shop.
In a pre-Christmas session of the
A.B.C.’s Kindergarten of the Air
small children were told there was no
Father Christmas and that it was
mothers and fathers who hid toys for
children to find.”
“Well, chickabiddies, this is
Auntie Jane once more to tell
you a weeny story. But before I
start I want to ask you all just
one little question: Were you
able to spot Daddy’s face under
all that white woolly stuff yester-
day morning when he sneaked in
to fill your stocking like I said
he would? I think it’s so silly,
don’t you, keeping up this
Father Christmas bunk. Uncle
Joe killed him off a long time
ago, and I’m sure the children
in Russia are no worse off for
it.
“And you know the song,
kiddies, about Good King
Wenceslaus? Well, forget it!
There never way a King Wences-
laus, and if there had been he
wouldn’t have been good but a
horrible old man.
“Now, I want to talk to you
this morning, duckies, about
story-books. You wouldn’t want
to hear about silly stories, I
know. There are lots of those,
of course, and I want to warn
you about listening to some of
them.
“If your Mummy sits you on
her lap one night before you go
off to byezey and starts to tell
you the story of Jack and the
Beanstalk, tell her to can it. In-
tellectual children don’t need to
be fed on such idiotic pap, do
you? Only a half-wit would be-
lieve that a bean-plant could
grow so big it would stand the
weight of a full-grown boy.
You’ve seen Daddy up in the
garden picking beans. Have you
ever seen him reach up to pick
them? Of course you haven’t—
he has to bend down, for that’s
as high as they grow. And
there’s no scientific basis for the
belief that magic can make them
grow up into the sky.
“And if Jack could have
climbed up a bean-tree out of
sight, what did he run along up
in the sky so he could get to the
giant’s castle? There’s nothing
up there but rarefied air—you’ll
have that proved to you one day
when you are able to read big
science books. And how could
a castle keep up with no founda-
tions into the earth? You see,
it’s all so silly. So as, soon as
Mummy starts on it tell her it’s
an insult to your intelligence.
“And it’s almost certain some
foolish person will try to tell you
about fairies being at the bottom
of the garden. Have you ever
seen any there with your own
eyes? If you have you’ve got
the rats, dearies, because there
aren’t any such things as fairies.
Remember, you must get used
to living only in a world of strict
realities, for that is the only
world there is. The idea of
fairies was thought up by a
greedy man who wanted to make
money out of a book and to
make fools of little children by
getting them to believe what he
wrote. Isn’t it silly believing in
fairies? And to prove what I
say is right, all of you go down
to the bottom of the garden
after this session is over, and if
you see anything but Daddy’s
compost-pit or some old tins tell
Mummy to take you to an
alienist.
“Another story, chickies, they
may try to put over you is the
one about Cinderella going to
the ball in the coach made from
a pumpkin. Now, it’s a wicked
lie to say a coach could be made
from a vegetable. You must
learn to be practical. Mummy
pays one and fourpence a pound
now for pumpkin, and a big
pumpkin would be worth a lot
“I just killed a black snake that Was headed your Way.”
and get a wand, which is only a
piece of stick with silver paint
on it, wave it over the pumpkin
and say ‘Let a coach and six
appear!’ You’ll simply be wast-
ing your breath ; for nothing will
happen. That will prove to you
that the story of Cinderella, like
that of Father Christmas, is all
hooey.
“Now let us turn, children, to
the moronic story of the Sleep-
ing Beauty. Let us analyse it in
the light of cold logic. An
alleged fairy godmother, en-
raged at not having been invited
to a princess’s christening-party,
causes the princess, when she is
a young lady, to prick her finger
on a spindle, at which the
princess falls asleep and stays so
for one hundred years. Now,
apart from the fact that medi-
cal science knows of no case
where anybody has slept con-
tinuously for more than a few
months, isn’t it absurd to be-
lieve that when the prince’s kiss
eventually wakes her up she is
just as young and beautiful as
when she first went to sleep!
That is biologically impossible,
chickies- —even if she hadn’t
rotted in the meantime she’d
have been a toothless, revolting-
looking old hag. So you see,
whichever way you look at it,
it simply couldn’t happen.
“Now, darlings, if any of your
uncles or aunts or grannies give
you a book such as Grimm’s
Fairy Tales or Hans Andersen,
or if Mummy or Daddy or big
sister attempts to read out to
you silly stories like The
Gingerbread Man, Beauty and
the Beast, Aladdin, Hansel and
Gretel, Puss in Boots, Peter Pan
in Kensington Gardens or any-
thing as utterly impossible—as
impossible as Father Christmas
coming down chimneys with a
sack of toys —you know most
chimneys now in modern houses
are only dummies, and how
could any fat man get down one
of those, or even the real chim-
neys?—say you don’t want to
have such tripe read to you.
“Instead, prove how practical
and intelligent you are by asking
them instead to read to you
something which will benefit
your minds and fit you to take
your place in the big world of
realities; I suggest you insist,
say, on Tolstoy’s War and Peace,
Burton’s Anatomy of Melan-
choly, Gibbon’s Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire,
Galley’s Law of Libel, Practical
Metallurgy, and James Joyce’s
Ulysses. Bye-bye for now,
chicks.”

And where blackmarketeers
abound.
Yet though at Socialists’ behest
They have consented to divest
Their Empire of its former state
And patiently accept the fate
Of backing out of Hindustan
And walking off from Abadan.
Their patience spent, they stand

And draw the line at being

THE OTHER
A Bad Programme
N.S.W. Education Department sets a
bad example with Intermediate-certificate
exams. These exams are held on
November 1. When they are completed
the candidates are not required to finish
their school year.
Those who are leaving go straight into
jobs, falsifying their age when necessary.
The remainder have no place at school.
No teachers are free to teach them, as
the staff has to correct their papers and
attend to the other school exams.
Third-year ends for these pupils in the
first Week of November, and the new
term begins in January, Long holidays
are not good for girls and boys at the
“restless age.” There *s so much of real
educational value they could be taught
after the necessary evil of exams is over
A worse feature is that this premature
ending of the school year affects the
whole school. Pupils in fourth-year have
their exams early, too. They are expected
to remain at school, and are threatened
that they will have to repeat their year if
they fail to do so. Various “play-days”
are arranged to keep their interest from
flagging for the last five weeks. In
reality, absenteeism is rife. “Days off”
are taken for Christmas shopping, for
seeing Test matches, for imaginary sore
throats. In one girls’ school of 700 only
68 attended every day during the year.
It seems that, except for the few who
are really interested in educating them-
selves in the best sense of the word, the
schools virtually close for pupils up to
fourth year after the Intermediate. Thus
practically three months are lost at the
most important time in an adolescent’s
life. — Sarpedon (N.S.W.).
Sacrifices?
The claim by Parliamentarians, when
seeking to justify increases in their re-
muneration, that they make “very real
financial sacrifices in carrying out the
duties of their office” is doubtful.
Few professional men find Parlia-
mentary membership an obstacle to the
continuance of their civil calling. Dr.
Evatt has taken important briefs, and
what other of the many legal men in
politics has given up practice?
Owners of businesses and country pro-
perties can employ managers. Some
N.S.W. Labor M.L.Cs. are trade-union
secretaries, draw their pay in that capa-
city, their allowances as M.L.Cs. and
other benefits derived from Legislative
Council membership. Where is the
sacrifice?
If the average Parliamentarian is so
public-spirited as to prefer a seat in
Parliament, though capable of earning
more outside, it is surprising that there is
so little independence of character among
them. Rarely is one prepared to risk ex-
pulsion from his party by voting accord-
ing to conviction. Oh the contrary, there
ha T, e been examples of members prefer-
ring to humiliate themselves rather than
risk the loss of party endorsement. —
Economist (N.S.W.),
Employer Offenders
The squatters of 1946-51 have been
outbidding each other to get shearers
and stationhands, and the blackmarket
rates paid have led, more than any other
factor, to award rates being increased by
more than 300 per cent, in the last five
years. In democratic countries a sales-
resistance has now set in. Prices will
have to come down to meet the market,
and costs of production will have to fall
into line.
The first move should be to make
award wages the maximum wage, and to
impose severe penalties on black-
marketeers of labor. If workers want
something better than award wages, then
let them have it per medium of incentive
payments for higher production.— Graz
(N.S.W.).
Municipal Councils
What is needed in most municipalities
is a revaluation of all rateable property.
In some of the better Melbourne suburbs
five-roomed brick houses are selling for
“ Isn't he the cutest little chaperon ?”
£4OOO or so, though many are valued for
rating at about half that figure. It’s
the same through the whole range of
real estate. Property-owners are only too
willing to accept the present high market-
values, but are, apparently, not agreeable
that similar figures be adopted for rating.
Admittedly, where a property is let at
the 1940 pegged rental, lower prices may
have to be accepted where vacant posses-
sion is not available, but that point can
easily be overcome by making the
municipal valuation on either a “V.P. or
occupied-by-tenant” basis, as the case
may be.
If inflation is hitting council costs in all
other directions, then it follows that
inflated values must be accepted for
rating. Property-owners can’t have it
both ways. The position is absurd when
applied to the “unimproved” basis of
valuation and farcical when the rating is
on the improved basis.
It is to cover just such fluctuations in
property values that the Vic. Local Gov-
ernment Act provides that a revaluation
must be made every six years, with dis-
cretion to a council to extend that term
by not more than four years. There
are councils which have not revalued since
1941, and we all know what has happened
to values in that term. Small wonder
the councils are in a mess.
Another factor which adds hugely to
costs is duplication and triplication in
administration. I know of one smallish
length of road which is the responsibility
of three suburban councils. When it has
to be regraded or sealed the equipment
and staff of three councils are all engaged
on it, instead of one doing the lot at
half the cost to the ratepayers.
The suggestion for a Greater Melbourne
Council is political dynamite (like so
many other pressing problems), and as a
result nothing is done. With a Greater
Melbourne Council and adoption of
reasonable valuations, somewhere near
real values, the trouble which “P.A.” (B.
5/12/’5l) complains of would disappear.
It’s high time the collection of suburban
Pooh-Bahs and their retinues were fare-
welled. — Ceg (Vic.).
Pilot- and Tug-boat Service
Manning of pilot- and tug-boats by
R.A.N. crews might solve the problem
of recurring strikes (B. 5/12/’5l) —and it
might not. Probably it would merely
aggravate the position.
Ships assisted by tug or pilot services
so manned would in all probability be
declared “black” by the maritime unions
in general, and thus bring about a com-
plete stoppage. Anyhow, why keep fall-
ing back on the Services? Why should
they have to dig coal, drive trams or fill
the place of any other unionist who has
some grievance to air, real or imagined?
The real remedy is in the hands of the
unionists themselves. When they awaken
and take some interest in their affairs we
may have some peace in industry.—
X. M.N. (Tas.).
Practical Research
Funds granted to universities for teach-
ing and research should carry a stipula-
tion on the kind of research.
With their cloistered training, the
research which professors, lecturers, raw
graduates and undergraduates can under-
take best is that of the basic or funda-
mental type, the results of which do not
need to have a direct practical, applica-
tion.
Some of the best work of this kind,
for instance, has been done by Sydney
University on wheat rust. But for some
reason the university became dis-
contented with this kind of research
only, and decided to engage in breeding
commercial varieties of wheat. This
work is very ably done by the State
Department of Agriculture, with its
trained graduates, helped by years of
practical experience.
The university succeeded in producing
wheats resistant to stem-rust, but, with
its lack of practical knowledge and ex-
perience, did not pay attention to other
essential elements. One of its wheats,
Fedweb, had to be withdrawn from culti-
vation because of the very low baking-
quality of its flour, and its most recent
production, Gabo, spreads about the
country a variety highly susceptible to
flag-smut.
It was never suggested that the State
Department’s wheat-breeding work was
in any way inadequate, and there was
never the slightest need for Sydney Uni-
versity to enter this practical field of
research. It was only through obtaining
funds from apparently improperly in-
formed bodies such as banks, financial
sections of Governments and private
enterprise that it was able to do so.
It behoves Governments at least to
make themselves well informed in these
matters, and to make a stipulation that
financial grants should not be used by the
universities in duplicating practical re-
search already being efficiently done by
State Departments. Agriculturist
(N.S.W.).
Why Wire-netting Is Scarce
Usually when a commodity is scarce
storekeepers dole it out in small quan-
tities. But not wire-netting. When I asked
for netting my hardware store told me 1
could have the choice of Australian or
imported at so much a 50yd. roll. When
I pointed out that I needed only half a
dozen yards, the blunt reply was that
they didn’t cut rolls—the margin of profit
was so small it didn’t pay them.
The salesman admitted that many
people asked for small lengths for home
use, and occasionally a customer who
wanted it very badly would buy the
whole roll and sell what he didn t want
to friends and neighbors. Why couldn’t
I do the same?
I pointed out that I wasn’t in the retail
business —was merely a home-gardener
and had no wish to buy more than I
needed, leaving the balance for others
with similar needs. Another store which
wanted 10s. more for a roll of the same
netting told me they had adopted the
“no-cutting” policy. “We can sell all
we get in rolls, so why go to all the
trouble of cutting and wrapping?” Even
an offer to cut off my own requirements,
under supervision, and do my own wrap-
ping, left him unmoved.
I am now growing my beans on the
remnants of an old camouflage-net, and
feeling sore at the lack of service shown
by some storekeepers. Their time will
come; by thunder, their time will come.

Softening the Bird
With Christmas at hand, there’ll no
doubt be reason for many people to wish
that poultry-owners had resorted to a
method developed in the U.S.A.
The toughest old rooster can be made
tender by being treated to a pellet of a
synthetic chemical compound called
diethystilbestrol. The tablet is inserted
under the skin of the bird .six weeks
before killing, and its action causes fat
to form in the muscles. —D.F. (Vic.).
