WHO IS

g
■ Nervous & Debilitated
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Gcnito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY'S success, which has
become so firm!)* established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts : —lst. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactlv adapted to suit the case, and arc compounded
from the purest, freshest, and retined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
'and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINEIVA T. who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION :-Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting; fullness of blood in the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject ? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
,'our health or future happiness, when by a single con •
sulfation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour?
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £x, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may be, call or write—l will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay !My vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-
TATIONS FREE. Medicines sent secure
from observation to any part of A ustralasia.

READ THIS
Western Australia is a ranch richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
rhe important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.
“ History repeats itself,” and as surely as Sydney and
Melbourne have made lightning-like progress, so will

Late House Surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, Caledonian Road. London.
SPECIALIST in the Treatment of Diseases of the
Reproductive Organs and Nervous Complaints .
Dk. PERRY was induced to publicly advertise himself as a
Specialist in this branch of the profession in consequence of the number
of persons suffering from diseases of this nature remaining uncured ; and
this is not surprising, when it is remembered, ip consequence of the
general dislike of the profession to undertake these cases, the public
health has suffered, because the majority of persons advertising to treat
these diseases, and calling themselves Doctors, Professors, etc.,
Are Neither the One nor the Other,
and exist chiefly because DULY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRAC-
TITION ERS have not occupied the field.
Patients can. therefore’ readily see the advantage of being-treated
bv a practitioner whrt'has, gd|M* through a thorough Medical, Surgical arid
Anatomical Training in thd best hospitals ; and the Doctor argues that,
; h bough it may be considered contrary to antiquated medical etiquette
to so advertise, yet he is promoting the usefulness! AND.. THE,ryqjiiTy. of

SATURDAY, AUGUST 16, 1890.
The Approrching Struggle.
There is reason to apprehend that before
these lines are published another serious
struggle between Labour and Capital in Aus-
tralia will have been commenced. The most
threatening cause is a repetition in New South
Wales of what has already occasioned a short
but sharp contest in Queensland. The re-
fusal by certain squatters to recognise the
Shearer s Union has made the wool, shorn by
non-union labour, practically a contraband
of war. Nearly simultaneously a dispute
has arisen in another quarter. The dismissal
of a fireman from the steamship Corinna has
been resented by the men us an attempt at
intimidation, and in consequence all hands
have come ashore and the vessel has been
laid up. There are mutterings of coining
storms also in other directions, and altogether
the air is in a highly-charged condition of
electricity. But the circumstances which
seem most emphatically to foreshadow a
convulsion are the undisguised rallying and
mustering of forces on both sides. For a
considerable time past, iu New South Wales,
affiliations of trades societies with the central
body, the Trades and Labour Council, have
been proceeding in a constantly progressive
ratio. There are more workmen combined
to-day in an apparently solid Union than
ever was before the case iu the pro-
vince ; and, avg believe, more in proportion
to the gross number of workers than ever
Avere similarly handed together in any com-
munity in the Avorld. In addition to that
the central bodies in the different Australa-
sian capitals have succeeded in organising
an .amalgamated federation, which pro-
mises to bo thoroughly effective when set in
motion. Moreover, relations have been
established Avith the wharf-labourers in the
chief commercial city in the Old World,
which must in some degree strengthen the
hands of Australasian Trades-Unionism.
* # o
Taking the two subjects of dispute
separately, the shearers’ case appears indis-
putably good. The fact that the great
majority of sheds have been occupied by
Union shearers, and that it is only in
isolated cases that squatters have insisted on
ignoring the Union and employing “black-
leg ’ labour amply testifies that the stipula-
tions of the Shearers' Union are not iu-
i oiu'-able .or oppressiA e. There have been
no complaints on the part of those squatters
alto availed themselves of Union labour that
’ their Avork has not been efficiently executed
or that the rate of remuneration demanded
has been excessive. It would appear rather
as’ though the employers of non-union
labour, had been trying to gain a point
on those who employed Union , hands.
But there is - little room for doubt,
that both dieses rtf employers cherish a
sentiment of resentment towards the Union.
Accustomed to be arbitrary masters of the
situation and to make with individual appli-
cants for work, or with isolated bodies of
men, the most advantageous terms for them-
selves—that is to say the most disadvan-
tageous terms for the men —which particular
local conditions might warrant, they regard
with repugnance the changed conditions
which place the men in as strong a position
for securing a good bargain as they occupy
Besides this, there exists a
feeling of apprehension lest, if the men are
permitted to consolidate their position, the
limit of their demands may lie extended.
The organisations of labour, for the avowed
purpose of securing progressive improvement
in the rate of their remuneration, is about
to be confronted by an organisation of em-
ployers and capitalists for the equally avowed
purpose of resisting the progressive claims
of labour, and for the less openly-confessed
purpose of wresting from labour some, if not
all, of the concessions which it has of late been
powerful enough to exact. In Queensland
the squatters have at last inaugurated a Pro-
perty Defence League. In New South Wales
a similar organisation is projected. It has
been boasted that a fund of £50,000 will be
speedily collected as a military chest, to be
employed in a tierce campaign against labour.
We do not consider the boast an empty
one. Although it may not be correct
that, as has been alleged in print, one
man has promised £5OOO as his single
contribution, or that five more have
guaranteed collectively to subscribe £5OOO,
there is reason to believe that not merely
£50,000, but £lOO,OOO might be forthcoming
were capitalists in general to league together
to do battle with the forces of Union Labour.
* * *
It is difficult to estimate with any preten-
sion to accuracy the forces which may be
arranged on each side in the apparently in-
evitable and proximate contest. In the test
place, the material k of war is not of a single
kind. It consists of men, of money, and
of property of divers descriptions. The
Trades and Labour Council of New South
Wales declares, if we recollect aright, that it
represents 50,000 working men who will
take from it the order of the day. The
different societies affiliated in the Union
have each some funds available in the case of
a strike. In some cases the amounts are
considerable. In the majority of instances,
however, we believe these' resources to be
trifling compared with the drain to which
they would be subjected. Moreover,/ the
wider the area of the actual strike the
weaker will be the resources of the strikers,
because the f ewer will be the Unionists in
employment capable of contributing to
the support of the active combatants.
And, inversely, the greater the pro-
portion of Unionists whtr are not
called out, the less effective the strike.
These conditions are thoroughly understood
by Capitalists, who stand on at least
an equal footing of vantage with respect to
limiting or contracting the number of hands
to be “out,” with the Trades and Labour
Council. If the. Council thought it advan-
tageous to have a large proportion of its men
at work, with the view of contributing funds
for the support of the actual strikers, the
employers might see the matter in the same
light, and counteract the manoeuvre of the
Council by instituting a far-reaching lock-out
of unionists.
* * *
Strategy of- this description, exercised by
each side, would give advantages to the more
skilful in its employment. Capitalists are
generally regarded as weak on one point.
Their property, which they fight to secure
from diminution by sharing, is perishable,
and if not used, is liable to decay. More-
over, mere suspension of operations is ruinous
to many—perhaps a majority —of the em-
ployer class in Australia, who are not really
capitalists, but middlemen and brokers,
depending for a living upon small margins,
upon constant transactions on a more or less
considerable scale. Wool and metals, how-
ever, hides and and tallow, which constitute
much the larger proportion of the articles of
Australian export trade, are not perishable
in the sense of decaying if retained in ware-
houses a few weeks, months, or even years.
The chances of unstable markets might even
render a few months’ delay of sales a
source of profit, even allowing for loss < f
interest. A casual rise in the markets of the
world might make the delay in realising,
due to a strike, a positive gain to the owner
of any of the staples we have mentioned.
# # #
With respect to Labour, its pecuniary
resources could not very long sustain the
drain of a strike anything like general.
Once these are exhausted the contest be-
comes a very peculiar one. It resolves
itself into a competition of endurance be-
tween property and the nerve of the
Capitalist on one side, and the bodily
tissues of the men upon strike on the
other. And not of the men alone, but of
the women and children dependent upon
them for food. Contributions of money
from extra-Australian sources cannot be
relied upon. The London Dock-labourers
are not in a position to return the substantial
compliment rendered them by Australian
labour. And, moreover, it was not Aus-
tralian labour alone which furnished the
funds which sustained the Lomb n Dockers
and broke the spirits of their oppressors.
A great part of the money came out of capi-
talistic pockets, which would be tightly but-
t6ned against Australian strikers, and pos-
sibly bo opened I" assist the employers.
If, therefore, the issue of the struggle
depended merely upon the conditions which
we have mentioned, it would be a doubtful
one, as matters stand. But there are other,
and very important, factors. Labour is still
far from completely unified. Even supposing
that the Trades-unions in New South Wales
count more, as is asserted, than 50,000 men,
that is but a feeble proportion of the wage-
earning male population. According to the
statistical return relative to employment dur-
ing the year 1889, justissued by Mr. Coghlan,
there are engaged in what are termed pro-
ductive occupations alone over one hundred
and eighty-three thousand persons, chiefly
males. The return above referred to affords
no information as to the numbers of persons
engaged in other occupations, but on referring
to the figures given in “The Wealth and
Progress of New South Wales,” and calcu-
lating on the proportion there stated, it
appears that there are engaged at the present
time in pursuits coming under the head of
trade and commerce about 31,000 persons ;
in maritime pursuits, about 14,000 ; in the
building trades, about 27,000; and as un-
skilled labourers, about 02,000 men—making
a total of 134,000, exclusive of professional
men, persons in Government and municipal
employment, and military and police.
Thus it would seem that the male
industrial army of New South Wales consists,
roughly speaking, of 317,000 rank-and-flle,
of whom but 60,000 at most are in the ranks
of the Labour Unions. Doubtless a con-
siderable contingent of the unenrolled is
sympathetic. But unfortunately there exists
a proportion who have not yet learned to
appreciate the identity of interests among all
sorts and conditions of wage-earners. This
ignorance prevails especially among the pro-
fessedly genteel classes of wage-slaves. Mer-
cantile clerks, a proportion of shopmen, civil
servants, bank-clerks, and such small-beer
gentry, are but too prone to fancy that their
case is different from that of manual labourers.
In reality, such differences as there have been
is rapidly disappearing. In consequence of
the educational facilities of recent times, and
of the too prevalent craving for “genteel”
positions, the ranks of the competitors for
clerical employments become yearly in-
creasingly congested, with the inevitable
result of diminishing wages and augment-
ing tasks and hours. The clerical
class is rapidly becoming the most put-
upon of any. The clerk has to submit
to more arrogance than any mechanic would
endure. If he be so unfortunate as to lose
one billet, he has infinite difficulty in finding
another. Overtime work without extra pay
lie is constantly called upon to perform. Yet
it is ho who, in the case of a strike, strips oft’
his coat, and handles crates and bales, loads
ships, and helps to defeat, while he joins his
master in reviling, the “common men” on
strike. It will take some time before such
persons will discover that the shabby-genteel
is the most miserable of all conditions.
Meanwhile, this class and the ignorant ruck
of unskilled labour are amongst the most
formidable instruments at the command of
capital for the quelling of labour revolts.
* * *
But there exists a more form dable resource
still. The starveling superfluous labour of
the Mother Country and of the Old World
generally constitutes a stupendous reserve
corps from which, under existing conditions,
employers can always draw detachments if
unable to overcome Australian labour on
strike, with local resources. It is freely
affirmed that it is contemplated at this junc-
ture, should occasion arise, to defeat any
serious labour revolt by the introduction
of ample contingents of European pauper
labourers, and it is asserted that already
£6OOO has been subscribed in sums of £lOOO
each as a nucleus of the fund for importing
labour. If this blow cannot be averted or
parried, it must, we conceive, be decisive.
No combination of Australian workers, how-
ever comprehensive, and however skilfully
led, could stand against such an introduction
of foreign troops into a domestic conflict.
The matter should, consequently, be con-
sidered and faced forthwith. The existing
law, framed by and for the purposes of the
capitalistic class, facilitates such invasions.
It is useless to pretend that the united exer-
tions of workers arc adequate to prevail, inde-
pendent of legislative interference, while the
weight and influence of existing enactments is
soadjusted as to give thisdecisiveadvantage to
Capital. The Labour question is really the
greatest problem of the day, and legislators
will simply be shutting their eyes and ears
to the most obvious facts if they conceive
that they can stand aloof. The workers of
New South Wales must call upon the alleged
representatives of the people to stand and
deliver their intentions with respect to this
subject. The teetotal party is a compara-
tively insignificant one, but already by sheer
pertinacity and aggressiveness it has, accord-
ing to its own statements, compelled about
half the members of theN.S.W. Assembly to
consent to doits bidding. Let United Labour
take a leaf out of the Local Optionists’
book and demand from every member of Par
liaineut a decisive enunciation of intentions
with respect to the law which enables
an employer having a difference with his
hands to emulate Sir Hknry Pakkks, or
those with whom he was formerly associated,
by importing a swarm of cheap, and even
coloured, labourers to accomplish, for a
starvation wage, the functions which the
Australian workman has refused to execute
for a less rewin d than will suffice to keep
himself and fan. in decency and comfort,
with some margin towards making provision
for old age, amt on conditions which involve
no sacrifice of his personal self-respect as a
free man acknowledging no obligation of
servility as part of the consideration for the
wage which his labour has fully earned.
The Price of a Cheap Loaf.
Ever since the great Foreign-trade movement
began in England the glib and illogical orators
of Cobuen’s school have dilated on the beauties
of that “ cheap loaf,” which was to lie laid on,
like gas, in the homes of the British proletariat;
and the party is gladdened to-day by the fact
that the humble victual in question is still there,
and apparently has come to stay. It is a very
small loaf in many cases, and a very hard one,
and there is often a serious difficulty in raising
the money to pay for it 1 ; and it is adulterated
to a considerable extent, and is generally under-
weight ; also one cheap loaf is but a small-sized
blessing when it is divided among a hungry
family of ten residing in a fireless attic, when
the winter is cold and clothing is scarce and
boots are an unattainable quantity ; but the
country has made gigantic sacrifices for that
loaf, and the unobtrusive article of diet has not
entirely gone back on her. How much the
Foreign-trade loaf has involved no one has ever
been able to estimate, for the price is too great
to be recorded in figures. But, on a rough
estimate, it has cost nearly two-thirds of the
agricultural population, and has been bought
by the sacrifice of the bone and sinew of Great
Britain—the men who built the Empire and
fought the Empire’s battles, and made Britain
what she was before Freetrade was invented,
and what she never will be again. The best
part of the nation has been given in exchange
for it, and the more intelligent of political
economists begin at last to realise that no more
ruinous article ever existed than that tough and
tasteless mass of food which has undermined
three kingdoms and demoralised the .Anglo-
Saxon race.
# * *
The era of Britain’s cheap loaf began when
the abolition of the corn dirties enable the
importers of foreign grain to practically kill the
agricultural industry of the country, and then
the hardy Englishman of the fields and the hills
commenced that process of decay which pro-
mise's to end in his utter extinction. Between
the years 1861 and 1881 one-third of the rural
population of England disappeared, and in
Scotland and Ireland the loss was even more
considerable. The results of the last nine years
cannot be accurately estimated, but, judging
from external evidences, the census of 181)1 will
show that another 30 per cent, of the tillers of
the soil have abandoned the hopeless, effort to
wring a subsistence out of the fields of the
Mother Country, and have gone to build up new
nations beyond the seas. In the "ceaseless
struggle to produce that cheap loaf, which so
few are able to pay for, despite its cheapness,
the British farmer cannot compete with the
producers of more favoured climates, and, con-
sequently, he has all but vanished, to make
room for the knock-kneed, stunted operative
who grinds out his master’s golden affluence in
the unwholesome factories of the great cities.
The increase of Britain’s population is now
merely the ceaseless growth of huge manufac-
turing centres, where the air is thick and foul
with smoke and unwholesome vapours, and
where the new generation grows up amid
clanking wheels and jarring' engines, and
drags out a consumptive existence in
bines and slums and dismal alleys and
malarious by-ways; and while the factories
multiply, and the red-brick tenements crowd
each other in more and more closely, the sturdy
race that built up the (State is not only dying
but all but forgotten. It was sacrificed, in order
that a broken-down nation might eke out its
miserable existence on a cheap loaf, for the
benefit of the millionaires of Manchester and
Birmingham and London ; and some day, when
the very existence of the country is at stake,
and its only defenders are the men who have
been reared among the mould and ooze and
slime of the murky lanes, the full measure of
this sacrifice will begin to be appreciated.
# * *
It is the common explanation of this dismal
state of things that the agricultural population
of Britain was crushed out by the rapacity of
the Tory landlord, arid this is so far true, for the
landlord has habitually taken all he could get
—which, of late, has been comparatively little.
The enormous increase in the value of land
is entirely confined to the great cities, and
purely agricultural property to-day is, in most
cases, a minus quantity. The landlord is as
rapacious as ever, but circumstances are against
him, and from sheer pressure of necessity he
would gladly lease great tracts of arable soil at
a rental which would pay 3 per cent, on the
cost of improvements, the land itself being
thrown in free of cost. But even on such terms
as these it is impossible to compete against (lie
curse of that, cheap loaf made from imported
produce, and the great axiom that it is better
to he a mere animal living on a low-priced crust
in a slum than to lie a human being at a slightly
higher rate, has eaten so hopelessly into the
vitals of the nation that there is no present
prospect of any change for the- better. Land
nationalisation alone is useless in such a case.
In the towns and cities, from which the bulk of
the landlord’s wealth is now derived, ii would
enormously ease the public; burdens, but the
essential feature of the doctrine consists in the
annexation by t he State of the unimproved value
of the country, and in the agricultural districts
of Knglaml the unimproved value has pra< ti-
.rally ceased to exist-. F\ it since Fr“elrad<- was
inaugurated it has been a. steadily diminu-hing 1
quantity, and now apparently it is gone for
good. The confiscation of a non-existent tiling
is impossible, and unless some measure of Pro-
tection makes it possible for an agricultural class
to exist iu England, there is nothing orit side He
tori ns to confiscate.
# # ,
It is the men who are akin to the cart-horse
and nearly related to the plough who are the
strength and defence of a nation, and all the
millions, which England accumulates annually
and lends out to the busted republics of South-
America, or speculates in the wild cut mines of


the Transvaal or Mysore, are only as small dust
iu the balance by comparison with what she lias
lost. A nation of shopkeepers is an ephemeral
thing tit the best. In the great wars which
opened this century the Highlands of Scotland
supplied more soldiers than the whole able-
bodied male population of these regions to-day,
and the i ural districts of England and Ireland
furnished the balance of that great army, but
for which Napoleon would have been crowned
iu London ami the dense and imbecile George
consigned to the Tower. It was the agricul-
tural regions of South-western France which
built up, almost iu a day, the host with which
Ohanzy all but crushed the German legions out-
side beleaguered Paris, and which defeated
Prince Frederick Charles in the face of
terrible odds before Laval, and it is the daunt-
less peasantry l of the Ottoman Empire
which has supported the doomed cause
of the Sultans for two long centuries
against all the Christian powers of Eastern
Europe. And not only the muscle, but the brain
of the nation is recruited almost exclusively
from the pure air of the plains and hills. The
men who have left a large-sized footprint on
the sands of time had their origin, as a rule,
under a clearer sky than that of the stifling city,
and the whirring looms and wheels and
thunderous engines which bang and clatter in
an atmosphere of smoke and steam and fluff may
grind out gold in millions, but they never yet
produced the basis of national greatness.
The race which lives' from generation to genera-
tion under the dismal shadow of huge brick
walls and grime-encrusted smoke-stacks is a
soulless, petrified thing, with neither strength
nor courage nor energy to enable it to
hold its place in the ranks of humanity—an
aggregation of mere animals whose weary lives
are spent in ceaselessly turning the crank of
the huge machine whose products arc cents, and
dollars —dollars and cents, till oven their
thoughts and their dreams keep time to the
gruesome rhythm of pistons and levers and un-
greased cog-wheels; and a nation which had
abandoned every healthier industry than the
dismal routine of the murky manufacturing city
would be a hideous anomaly dying even in life
through the maddening monotony of its own un-
natural existence. Yet such an anomaly England
promises to become through the operation of
that Freetrade system which is fast sacrificing
every healthful and invigorating pursuit to the
fetich of the cheap loaf.
# # #
And, after all, the sacrifice is made for a mere
shadow, and the country is relatively poorer
than she was in the old days of Protection. In
actual resources no doubt she has advanced, for
all the world is advancing more or less, but her
Protectionist rivals—America, France, Ger-
many, even Spain—whose percentage of accumu-
lated wealth mounts every year, are steadily
wresting from her the advantages she acquired
in the past. Even the sacrifices on the altars of
Moloch and Baal were not more utterly wasted
than that which England has made in ex-
tinguishing the vigour and energy of the nation
in order that her sons-may grow wretched and
hopeless and hungry in the slums of her murky
cities amid an atmosphere of dust and misery,
and all manner of uncleanness.
# # *
It is a common theory that nations decay and
die through wealth and excess of luxury, though
no more glaring lie was ever written in the
pages of history. They have died, it is true,
through the luxury of one man out of a thou-
sand, and through the abject misery of the
other nine-hundred and ninety-nine, and the
dreary, soulless indifference born of the know-
ledge that they had nothing- to defend or to
lose ; but to ascribe their fall to blind profusion
is an insult to truth and to common-sense. The
world never contained enough luxury to de-
moralise its inhabitants, but of misery and
injustice there has always been enough and
to spare. When a nation has tacitly resolved,
in the apathy born of hopeless toil and weari-
ness, that its country is of so little use to it as
to be no longer worth saving, then extinction is
very close at hand. And the patriotic fervour
which is the strength of a great people has only
a feeble existence in the gloomy, noisome alleys
and courts where the toilers of the cities drag
out their cheerless existence. The patriot may
tight with unreasoning enthusiasm for the
mountains and plains of his native land, but the
patriot who will shed his blood for the brick-
factory opposite and the gigantic smoke-stack
iu the next street is not yet born. Each the
least heroic of nations have seldom failed to
produce, some fiery soldier who would make a
gallant light in defence of the forests under
whose shadow his life was spent, but. what
nation ev cr lived which could be roused to war-
like fervour by the cry that its undrained
shun was endangered by foreign aggression ?
The. poets of Germany;; Poland, and Greece did
much to rouse the fainting spirits of I heir country-
men in the darkest hour of their fortunes, but
poetry falls dead when its subject is an
infected.byeway, infested by old meat-tins and
broken hats and fried-fish barrows, and smells of
dead cat and old stale bones and that eternal
washing-day which has neither beginning nor
end. The toiler of the . cities cares compara-
tively little for his country, because his country,
so far as he knows it, is hounded by the dead
wall opposite, and there is nothing in that dull
and lifeless object to arouse his nobler aspira-
tions. Neither does he value his nation to any
great extent, for his nation consists of his
employer—and as regards him it is a matter of
comparative indifference whether he is killed-off'
by some foreign invader or not—his fellow-
workers, who, like himself, have nothing
to lose : and, moreover, the nation has never
placed him under any* obligation which
demands a sacrifice in return. His whole exist -
once is weary and sordid ami depressing, and
if he is lacking iu enthusiasm ii burst, be remem-
bered that Ms surroundings arc of a kind which
it is hard to be enthusiastic about And even
if he is asked to rise up in defence of that cheap
loaf which a Freetrade Government has so
generously bestowed, upon him, he may reply
with some show of reason that the loaf is hard
and tasteless, and difficult to obtain despite its
cheapness, and that at the best dry bread is not
a subject which tends to awaken the fires of
patriotism to any appreciable extent.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Totalisator.
The V.R.C., naturally anxious to give sup-
porters an opportunity to back horses upon the
least disadvantageous terms, has carried a reso-
lution in favour of establishing the Totalisator
at Flemington, and at an early date the Vic-
torian Parliament will be asked to decide
whether the rapacious bookmaker, together
with his first cousin, the welsher, shall longer
be protected against honest competition. People
have come to accept, as something of a great
truth, the theory that betting constitutes the
backbone of all race-meeting business, by which
is meant the business of giving away handsome
stakes that will attract large fields of horses and
consequently a profitable attendance of gate-
paying public. In accepting wagering as the
germ of Turf life sporting writers have chosen
to regard bookmakers, especially the cash-men
in gaudy raiment, as necessary to a race-meet -
ing’s success. Yet the ready-money Moseses,
who absorb such an undue proportion of the
public coin, arc the very creatures that a
practical racing-club would prefer to wipe out
with the totalisator. For advertisement
purposes the “ leviathan ” credit book-
maker possesses, it must be sorrowfully
admitted, a certain value. He lays the big,
early wagers which supply the Press with a
“Betting Market,” and attract attention to
those important coming events in which good
horses and a respectable proportion of. “ triers ”
compete. The influence exercised by the pub-
lication of “ odds ” in daily papers is consider-*
able, and in that direction bookinaking benefits
the principal meetings held at Flemington,
Randwick, and other headquarters. Having
got punters upon the course, however, it is the
policy of a racing-club to provide for them the
least ruinous system of gambling possible.
Horse-owners, being professional backers, can
be trusted to take care of themselves- —between
them and the bookmakers the light is fair.
Many intelligent old-hands affirm that the
owner who can’t make money by the backing
of his own horses is a simpleton, because
he should be able to get the best of
the market when he stands a fair chance
to win. The expenses of a stud un-
fortunate investments in animals that break
down, or never give him encouragement to
invest his money-may smash Tip the
‘‘ cleverest ” of owners, but his betting transac-
tions in hi* on} 11 stock should at least yield a
profit—taking one year with another. With
outside punters supporting their “ fancy,” or
“something they were told about” for the
sake of indulging the gambling weakness that
most flesh is heir to—with these the case is dif-
ferent. Very few of them get even the longest
odds actually procurable from cash book-
makers, and if they have the cuteness or luck to
succeed in doing so, even then the books', take
an inordinately large discount off their (the
punters’) occasional winnings. The prices laid
are never liberal enough. A whole army of
bejewelled “fielders” eat, drink, and buy rows
of houses out of the difference between what
punters ought to get when they win, and what
they actually receive. One totalisator can
do the work of many bookmakers. It
is a frugal living machine, content to
support an unsullied career upon 5 per
cent, of its gross receipts, and ready to
give away a portion of that percentage to
public charities, if the law so ‘desires. It
doesn’t ‘ ‘ milk ” horses for dishonest owners,
and the money it receives on account of non-
triers goes to swell the odds returned against
the winner. It never gets a “skinner.” If
4999 out of 5000 investors in the totalisator
drop their money, the fortunate odd unit picks
it all up again, less 5 per cent. How much
Letter for thy. 95 per cent, of “ oof " to benefit
only one “producer” than for a swarm of evil-
looking middlemen to divide the whole lot !
Finally, the V.R.C. has another powerful, but
generally overlooked, reason for wishing to
establish the machine. Of late there has sprung
up the system of backing horses at starting
(which generally means the shortest) price.
Punters don’t even have an afternoon’s sport in
the open air, but wait to hear their fate in
billiard-rooms. If the totalisator does no more
than kill starting-price betting, by inducing in-
fatuated youths to seek the racecourse in
search of longer odds and fresh air, it will
benefit humanity and the racing clubs at the
expense of a turkey-and-chanipagne-fod coterie
of lazy Hebrews.
A Common Case.
Till-; aged whec'.c about the property which is
• ‘ reasonably supposed to lie stolen " w as narrated
over again al one of the police courts las)
•week, and the customary result was arrived al
in the usual way. Two men were found
attempting to make a humble livelihood by
trading in poultry and. run in along with their
stock-in-trade, on the ground that the latter
was assumed, without any evidence, to have
been unlawfully acquired. Nobody turned up
to put in a claim to the property, however,
neither could the sleepless eye of the law dis-
cover anybody who seemed to have lost it, or
anything at all resembling it ; and at length the
prisoners were discharged after a severe ad-
monition concerning the sinfulness of being
supposed to have stolen something, and the
stock-in-trade was confiscated. The case
differed from the ordinary run of its species
merely because there was not sufficient ground-
less supposition to send the accused to gaol for
three months, and yet there was enough suppo-
sition to allow the court to grab everything
they had got, and throw them out into the
street in a penniless condition, and leave them
there to be arrested again in a day or two on a
charge of having no visible,pieans of support
the la\V having carefully taken nil visible sup-
port from tin in. and cursed them uphill and
down for possessing such a thing. Such good
fortune as this, however, is the exception rat' - ;
than the rule ; in the ordinary course of t
the accused is -sent to pound road-metal for
Government during the space of 13 weeks or
thereabouts, and if, despite this warning, he is
again found owning any tiling that belongs to him,
but which an unreasoning policeman declares as
reasonably supposed not to belong to him, he is
set down as an incorrigible criminal and some-
thing worse happens. In such eases the con-
stable is not expected to offer any tangible
reason for the faith that is in him; he merely
shuffles his gigantic feet in the witness-box and
states that, according to his intelligent eye, there
appears to he an incongruity between the pro-
perty and the person in the dock, and that he
doesn’t look like the sort of person who ought
to be in possession of that kind of property.
He is never expected to define what kind of
person ought to own • property of that descrip-
tion, or what sort of property might be ex-
pected to be in the lawful possession of an
individual similar to the prisoner ; the only
evidence he offers amounts to no more than a
bald statement that lie saw the accused, and
that a sort of instinct arose in his capacious
frame which made him think that the said
accused looked like an individual who might be
assumed, without any proof, to have stolen
something that nobody reported himself to have
lost, and thereupon he clutched him and
brought him “ forninst the coprt. ” And, as a
rule, the prisoner is a seedy-looking person who
is out of work, and he hasn’t enough money in
his possession to raise an action for illegal
arrest, and for embezzlement of his property ;
and if he lias enough money to hire a lawyer
and blow the whole case into dust, the coin
has been seized on the ground that it is
“ reasonably supposed to lie stolen,” and
he can take his choice between being sent up
as a vagrant for not owing any money, or being
sent up on general principles because be did
own it, with the additional chance, of being re-
arrested When he comes out because he hadn’t
got the money that was taken from him, and is
consequently without any “ visible means of
support.” And When the unshaven accused
leans over the spikes of the dock and thinks
over these complicated circumstances he gene-
rally presents a melancholy and dishevelled
aspect, which is partly owing to the fact that
he was mauled and dragged about by an officer
the day before, and partly to the circumstance
that he spent the night in a stuffy cell along
with two men who were in for assault and two
more who are drunk and malodorous ; and when
the law views him through its spectacles it con-
cludes that the old prejudice against punishing
any British subject on an unproved charge can
)>e suspended in the case of an unwashed in-
dividual With his hair standing up like a dog’s
tail ; and accordingly he gets three months or
so for no specified offence, but for being supposed
to have committed an offence. After which the
court proceeds to express its sympathy for the
next offender, who has annexed £2OOO in a re-
spectable way, and promptly lets him out on bail.

Parsons versus Pictures.
The Lord’s Day Observance Society, of Mel-
bourne, has issued a circular with the alleged
design of exposing those moral dangers that
threaten any country where public books and
pictures, can be studied on the day set apart, by
a benign Providence, for the Society aforesaid.
With the drivelling idiocy characteristic of
modern Puritans the compilers of this tract
have collected statistics showing the amount
of Sunday labour which goes on in France,
a tolerably prosperous region, ■ as civilisa-
tion now goes, that is continually being in-
stanced as a shocking example for the Chris-
tian world. The inevitable “eye-witness”
supplies a most unnecessary narrative of how
be saw large slops open, and a row of houses in
course of construction, in Paris, on the day
when, as everybody knows, the volatile
Frenchman affects race-meetings, theatres,
or weak adaptations of bull-fights. But
as the Society cannot establish any lucid con-
nection between reading a book and building a
house, or between the contemplation of a paint-
ing and the sale of a French roll, this factful
yarn from the gay. capital seems apropos of
nothing at all. The old “ Continental Sunday ”,
shriek is wasted on the invigorative atmosphere
of provinces that are worked by an Eight Hours’
movement, and a very casual acquaintance with
the Australian artisan is sufficient to convince
anyone, save born lunatics,, that he wouldn’t
build anything but his own fowl-house on the
Sabbath. No, nor on Saturday afternoon. It
is a lamentable fact, however, that Nxcodemus
devotes his undoubted talents to the discovery
of some mischief still for idle hands to do.
The labouring Victorian, who cannot play poker
at the Melbourne Club, lawn-tennis at Toorak,
billiards in St. Kilda villas, and so forth, puts
in such a lazy Sunday that he niay soon want to
seek some rational relaxation in toil unless the
heel* of tlfe L.D.O. Society be removed from bis
braAMty. k. Some Fi-oni.-limen work llm week
through, because otherwise they couldn't <llll
enough wages, whereas most Australians knock
off at 12 o'chick on Sc turds v because they bar e
earned enough; and arc anxious to enjoy them
selves tor ;i v irile. Put mild recreation within
I heir reach ami they seize the opportunity I"
benefit mind and body. Than in the
throwing open of libraries and picture-
galleries t here is no surer .safeguard against,
the undesirable introduction of that “Con-
tinental Sunday ” which is the stock-in-trade of
Maw worm. Ghadband, Stiggins, and Co.
And if the Victorians are too apathetic to
insist upon their just rights, if the Trades Hall
Council make no vigorous move, they may ulti-
mately find labour extending over Sunday and
wages coming down accordingly. Which is
probably the reason why Capital regards the
antics of rain'd Sabbatarians with a pompous,
patronising smile.

A Phai’isee's Lament.
The South Australian Government has offered,
in the interests of the shareholders who were
ruined and beggared by the Commercial Bank
failure, to pass a Bill legalising the disposal by
lottery of the remaining assets of t he comem :
amt the South Australian clergy ha,ve pul dished
their.boiling-hot curse on tipis unholy proposal.
By means of the lottery scheme it is possible to
disc at once properties which arc otherwise
, ilost unsaleable, to obtain for them a higher
priye than they would cvei fetch in the open
market, and to stop the perpetual calls which
hafe. left many qt the proprietors of the dead-
ami-gone bank absolutely penniless; but the
hide-boujul, withered slump of dogma and in*
tolerance which calls itself the Church considers
it better that somebody else should starve than
that its prejudices should be injured. At the
present moment there are about fourteen lot-
teries, art unions, and similar swindles in full
blast in Adelaide and its immediate vicinity,
and everyone of them is for Church pur-
poses, but the holy men who scoop the pool
have a monopoly of this species of wickedness
and object to any other sinner getting in. Most
of them are for the “building fund,” for the
surest road to heaven in the City of Saints is
to aid in the erection of another cold, hollow-
sounding tabernacle, with a vociferous rioter
within to tell about an everlasting hell, and a
worn-out devil who drags his nerveless tail
through the wastes of a dried-up creed. Pos-
sibly it is because the devil is so plentiful that
charity has become so miserably scarce, or
possibly the everlasting perdition has crowded -
out all the rest of the ancient faith ; at all
events the Church seems to be unanimous that
the broken shareholders of the Commercial
Bank must remain hungry on a Christian basis
rather than be relieved by the cash of the un-
godly speculator who doesn’t build churches,
and who isn’t solid on the subject of Gehennas.
The Church itself has done nothing in particular
to relieve the sufferers, beyond proving to them
that the men who cleared them out will
probably fry everlastingly if they don't repent;
and. meanwhile, the winter is cold and cheer-
less, and the prospect of a lost manager or a
doomed accountant in Hades is but an inferior
substitute for dinner and boots. Also, it has
been revealed to these ruined shareholders that
they should be cheerful under affliction, but
cheerfulness in an attic, when coals are scarce,
is difficult of attainment; and somebody has
proposed a subscription Which hasn’t been sub-
scribed to ; and somebody else has suggested
that prayer is an article which might go high at
the present crisis. But nobody except the sin-
laden creature with the lottery-scheme, and the
spectre of wrath who backed him up in that
nefarious object, has offered any thing resembling
relief or assistance, and the Church denounces
this carnal undertaking as “a measure of
hideous mien,” and is grieved to think where
the originator of it will go to when he dies.
The dignity of a lawyer is larger than the
mammoth. A little wlule ago one Gardiner
turned up in the dock at Benalla (Vic.) and in-
cautiously trod on the tremendous majesty of
this overwhelming 1 icing. There was no barris-
ter in Benalla, for that little one-horse, town
can’t support that ravening animal ; and
(I.VKIUNKU was too poor to hire a guy dressed in
horsehair and lied-'furniture from Melbourne
and pay his fee and his travelling expenses, and
then have the pleasure of going to gaol because
his advocate hadn’t even looked at the- cafe and
wasn’t there into the bargain. Accordingly be
asked the Court, in the usual way, to permit his
solicitor to appear for him. and the Court en-
quired whether that lofty and refulgent being, the
Crown Prosecutor, would stoop from his elevated
sphere to meet an ordinary low, cheap, common
solicitor, and the Crown Prosecutor rose with
carnage in his eye, and refused to associate with
the ignominious branch of the profession.. Con-
sequently Ga run n er was hauled,away to wait
till next assizes, and if he can’t hire a barrister
when that time comes he will probably be again
remanded, or else he will have to do without a
defence of any kind. But it is better that an
inconsiderable human being, without any capital
worth speaking of, should go to gaol undefended
than that a shining barrister should be tarnished,
and interfered with, and contradicted, by a
mere grovelling solicitor who never owned a
misfit wig in his life or fell over the tails of that
extraordinary garment which makes the ex-
ponent of the law look like a sack of potatoes in
disguise. »
The Orange delegation of Abigail, M.L.A.,
has burst, and lie is now negotiating with the
tail-end of .the Stupid Party to try and get
another one together. The prospects, at latest
advices, were far from brilliant, for it is no use
bringing out a Tory without brains to lecture
about the beauties of the Coercion Act in Aus-
tralia, and a Tory with brains is so scarce that he
can’t lie spared. Moreover, even supposing all
other difficulties were surmounted, Abigail is
in an awkward position. He and the Pope are
hollering now for the same cause ; for poor old
Leo is Salisbury’s friend and supporter, and
lie has put his limp and foundered ban on the
Home Rule cause, in exchange for some shadowy
measure of recognition ; in other words, Salis-
bury has taken him in. Therefore it is-ho Use
for Abigail to curse the Pope any longer, for
he .is cursing Ids ow u friend and supporter, and
it is sheer lunacy for him to complain,.even it
things arc “ more popery than Fiscal, so long
as he and the Head, of the Church are in the
same camp. And as for the suggestion that
Fuam’is should bring out-a party of politician
who are labouring under the Papal blessing,
and should help them (o prop up a 'cause
which Leo is actually bursting to assist and
accelerate, such an example •of a post my is
enough to make any true Orangeman's hair stand
up. At this rate Abigail will end by becoming
a miserably ungrammatical Cardinal.
Sin George Grey bids fair to score another
important victory this session with his Law
Practitioners’ Bill, which has been before the
New Zealand Parliament session after session
unsuccessfully for.several years past. The Bill
proposes to admit persons to practise at the Bar
who have passed an examination in legal know-
ledge and to dispense w ith the general-know-
ledge examination, which includes them lead

[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 14, 1890.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
I am told a cruel story about a lady in a western
K.S.VV. town who went to a local ball in purple and fine
linen, and next day sent a detailed account of her frills,
even to the colour of her stockings, to the “leading”
fcheet which printed it all in extenso. But the rival paper
over the way somehow discovered that the lady had in-
dexed her own wardrobe for local reference, and then the
trouble began. Every time she appears in public a
fiendish reporter sharpens his pencil and notes: “ Mrs. B.
was in town to-day. The gowning was in washed sateen,”
&c., or, “Mrs. B. was on the verandah this morning
Wearing' ” —&o., &c,, and so .on, until life is a mocking
burden to the persecuted woman, and she is almost
tempted to go out without any clothes.. Wherever she
is her attire is commented upon, but the climax was
reached the other day when the fiend elaborately re-
marked: “ Mrs. B. was observed taking the milk yester-
day. We note that the gown was in coffee-colour, acci-
dently deepened in the front breadth.” The next scene
in the comedy will probably have cowhide in it.
One of H.M.S. Curacoa’s officers tells a mildly-amusing
Story about what happened to a teetotal British Consul in
some savage land or other, who never looked on the
whisky unless he had a toothache. The gentleman was
attacked, simultaneously with the sighting of an impor-
tant mail-steamer, with some dire complaint which he
Usually cured alooholically, and to effect a recovery before
the excitement set in he took an overdose of his treacher-
ous tonic. The result is best expressed in hiccoughs—
While the entire Bulletin isn’t large enough to describe
the feelings of the pilgrims who came off the ship and
found Her Britannic Majesty’s consul crawling round on
all-fours with his uniform on back-to-front.
Apropos to the Carayoa, the names of the “staff” are
like unto a chapter out of “ Ouida.” They are all the
sort of name that the fickle Potts-Pointer likes to scrawl
all over her monogrammed note-paper with the prefix of
“Mrs.” when nobody’s looking, just for fun, but the
laurel wreath is seized by Vernon Maud Albert S. Lafone.
Imposing at one sip, isn’t it ? Only that untranslated S.
Spoils one’s enjoyment of the perspective, as it were. Can
It stand for Smith or Simpson or Sandy and thus burst up
the harmonious whole ?
Quite the newest idea in ball-skirts is the semi-circular
hern —in which the floor-end of the garment is cut in a
bold scoop frontally, rising about four inches on each side
just at the ankles—for the purpose of displaying the same
to public criticism, I suppose, though no doubt Mary tells
mamma that the dressmaker says it makes the gown hang
better. A lady wore one at Tempe ball. The gown was
ecru tulle and emerald-green velvet, and the scoop re-
vealed a pair of tiny white satin shoes, producing a
charming effect, even if you did think that the wearer
had her petticoats clutched in both hands, under the
delusion that she was hopping over a mud-puddle. But
the skirtal scoop should he adopted lingeringly. Decol-
lete commenced with a little two-inch snip in a high-
necked gown, and if skirts begin to get. hitched up at the
Bides, the modest young man of the future will have to go
round in a mask. No girl who possessed a special pair of
garters would he satisfied to show only to the tops of her
boots.
You won’t he shocked when I modestly admit that I
don’t like “ Our Morgan ” very much. Of course the im-
ported “ Johnny Morgan,” who hung like a speck on the
face of the vast gold-and-silver-and-white-coloured instru-
ment and see-sawed on the largest pedals in the world,
and essayed marvels in the way of tremolo shakes on the
big top stop, rose to the occasion nobly, hut the stiffness
of the key-board seemed to be a great handicap all
through. The No. 4 Mendelssohn Sonata was my favourite
item on the bill of seven numbers, but I didn’t like the
opening “National Anthem,” when everybody who didn’t
wish to look conspicuous was compelled to stand, no
matter how small their boots were, while the organist
hanged through the entire trouble, first plain, and lastly
with aggravated trimmings, until the corn-growing section
of the audience got openly disloyal and sat down all over
the place. There was an awful throng in the hall, some
late-comers sitting on the steps in front of the organ with,
no doubt, a deep, intense yearning in their hearts for
ear-wool and a far-back seat, especially when the
“ great pedal reed of 64 feet sounding - length ”
boomed forth with a sound like 400 empty tanks
tailing on to a zinc roof. Lord and Lady Carington f
with the Mayor and Mayoress of Sydney (the host and
hostess of the occasion), were seated in front of the
eastern gallery ; the parliamentary contingent having the
southern gallery, and the artistic and musical professions
and the press the northern; while the ground-floor was
dedicated to the unable-to-be-catalogued guests. There
was nothing very special in ’tiring. In the eastern balcony
Lady Carington wore dark cashmere with loose fronts,
adorned with drab guipure over a vest of pale-pink chiffon,
bonnet in gold straw brown velvet strings and blush-pink
roses, and brown fur tippet, and Mrs. Burdekin a Worth
ronfeciion in fawn-and-pink-and-bluc-checked silk with
iridescent bead trimming, and passementerie in blne-and-
lawn-attd-pink, toque in small cream flowers, diamond
brooches and posy of violets.
A “ dark’’—probably very “ dark young gentle-
man” in a “good position,” who concludes an extra-
appealing daily newspaper matrimonial ad. with “ only
huna-fi(h‘ ladies need apply,” is still advertising. What
rise could he expect? The “ bona-fide ladies” won’t
answer and the other kind of lady doesn’t answer
either, but “ Dark Young GentlemaH ” keeps on throwing
one shilling’s-worth of print after another with the reck-
lessness of despair. The idea of a hona-fide lady keeping
a “matrimonial ” appointment and sneaking round a lamp-
post or a back-lane with a red rose in her hat and a parti.'
oular sort of scent on her handkerchief so that she may be
recognised by the advertiser ! Also the simple suggestion
of a bona-fide lady sitting down to her desk and stating
in a dainty, fashionable fist that “lam 24 years of age
and thoroughly healthy, with a slight squint, about five
feet six inches high and nineteen at the waist, fond of
children, and wouldn't object to red hair and large feet
on the part of the advertiser is sufficient to show
“Bark Young Gentleman” how useless is his expendi-
ture, and that his best plan is to join a Sunday-school or
a skating-rink in search of a guiding angel for his heart.
l.ord and Lady Carington were present at the meeting
of the supporters of Lewisham Children’s Home on 6th
instant, when 11. E. made his little “ spache” and Lady
Carington. received a charming bouquet. In the course
of an artfully neat oration Cardinal Moran remarked that
“As the people of Australia were beginning to claim a
voice la the election of their Governor, and as we hoped
to have a dominion here, perhaps the voice of the Austra-
lian people might summon back Lord Carington.” At
which 11 is Excellency looked delighted. Which reminds
me that somebody was sympathising recently over the
horrors of N.S.W. Governorships in the presence of Lord
Carington, who remarked, “Don’t think a fellah’s much
to be pitied out here ;I am sorry enough to go.” Upon
winch the first speaker said, “And did you try to get
your term of office renewed, melud?” A better courtier
here changed the subject in a hurry.
Almost frostily cold weather prevailed on the occasion
of the Tempe ball, held this year in Darlinghurst Hall, on
sth inst., but lam glad to say that the frost was strictly
outside, as the reunion itself was one of the successes of
the season. The dresses collectively were very good, for
nobody expects to see new gowns so low down in the
festive year. Precedent must be given the vice-regal
attire on account of the “ augusticity ”of the wearer,
but the carrots-and-company sugar-coloured silk and
brocade and net, standing out all round like a diving-bell
and out trainless, wasn’t quite the loveliest frock on the
floor, though Lady Oarington’s diamonds struggled hard
to redeem the ensemble. Mrs. Burdekin wore yellow
silk and tulle and diamonds ; Mrs. O’Connor, black
lace and moire; Mrs. Carson (one of the indus-
trious hon. secretaries), a handsome gown in heliotrope
silk and armure with a spray of lilac in her hair ; Carrie
Swain, blue satin and pearls; Miss Slattery, pink-and-
green striped silk and white jet lace ; and dozens of others
‘in sanctified raiment, though the preponderance of jaun-
diced “ yaller ” satin rather spoilt the whole and suggested
the idea that people were in quarantine. As is the incon-
gruous custom at charity halls, the refreshments were
especially well done, the table decorations—flat mirrors
with banks of snowdrops and violets and a huge central
hedge of camellias, maidenhair, and crocus eliciting much
admiration, and I was sorry to see several ill-regulated
females denuding the decorations at an early hour of
violets and ferns for the adornment of their persons, re-
gardless of the waiters’ dumb protesting eye. Apropos
to decorations, when somebody remarked that the little
lamps high up in the roof were not alight, an Amurikart
athlete observed sententiously :“ I expect they’re a-
savin’ of the ile.”
Several Sydney philanthropists, captained by Lady
Barley, are endeavouring to organise a Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, urged thereto, I believe,
by the course of action pursued by a country magistrate
in a suit brought against a teacher for “ whackery.” I
hope if the Society gets its sea-legs, so to speak, that it
will devote some of its energies to ameliorating the con-
ditions of the fashionable baby-sriiis done up in whalebone
and bustles, and the “ toff” baby-boys in tight collars and
tighter gloves, who certainly should come well within the
scope of such an organisation.

The only advantage to be derived from such a numerous
sort of union is that you could bluff even a honeymoon
hotel-keeper if you included the amalgamated offspring
in the preliminary canter, so to speak. And it would be
very soothing to range the little darlings on the seat
ahead of you in the railway-car and see the old maid
across the aisle—the vigilant despair of honeymoonists—
commence to doze unsuspiciously even in the jaws of a
tunnel.
Referring to the great event of last week—after all the
criticisms of Mayor Burdekin’s action in singling-out a
favoured four thousand odd to sample the organ, instead
of allowing everybody in as at a free fight, it now tran-
spires (as was calmly understood all along in certain
circles) that the expenses incident to the inaugural cere-
mony—from Mr. Best’s fee down to postage-stamps—were
met hy the Mayor himself. The Sydney public keeps a
keen eye on its officials. Witness the newspaper-war over
the upholstering of the Mayoress’ suite in the Town Hall
recently, for which the Mayor himself was pecuniarily
responsible.
But she daubed paint and gold-wash over ’em all,
And the gridiron she trimmed with ribbons of rose,
Then hung 'em all up on the drawing-room wall.
Moral:
And the young man didn’t propose.
A Wellington (N.Z.) domestic employed by a friend of
mine, takes the cake for style. Her mistress complained
of the number of glasses broken while passing through
her hands. The breakages were peculiar, and at first
incomprehensible. It appeared as if the glasses had been
cut. The maid at last discovered the cause of the state
of matters. “ You see, mum,” she explained, “ when I
put my hand in the glass with a towel to dry it and turn
it round quick, like this, me diamond ring cuts it.” She
broke another showing her mistress how the thing was
done.
They say that an “engaged” vice-regal aide doesn’t
simply dance—he sprints. Somebody timed him round a
big ball-room recently and he did it in one twenty-two-
and-a-half seconds to a tick, and kept on doing it, too
So fleet-footed a fiance ought to be kept on a chain just as
a guarantee of good faith, as it were.
That incident of the satin shoe a-top of Mrs. Mary
Anderson Navarro’s honeymoon chariot recalls a tableau
that happened at Spencer-street (Melbourne) station not
ten years ago. Out of a cab, with that disastrous attempt
at aplomb which gives the honeymoon away in one scene,
got a bride and groom and then fourteen valises, while the
gamins stood around sizing them up. As the last bright-
yellow bonnet-box Was dumped on the kerb, and Torvald
handed Nora out, a voice full of scornful triumph inter-
jected : “ Wot did I betcher ? Look at the rice in ’er ’at!”
The express didn’t leave a minute too soon that day, any-
how.
A full house,* led I|»y Governor and Lady Carington,
graced Sydney Uni versify Dramatic Society’s inaugural per-
formance in the Great Hall of the University on nth inst.,
when the vindictive old snag, “ Blow for Blow,” was very
fairly rendered under very awkward circumstances. The
dual heroine was played by a young lady with “B.A.’
after her name, and a cynical man who sat near averred
that it stood for “ Bad Actress,” and I hadn’t the energy
to contradict him ; but the Kitty of Miss Marks was a
charming effort and audible even at the end of the hall.
A noticeable thing about this performance was that when
a man was supposed to represent a gentleman he looked
like one, besides which the prompter could have gone to
sleep had he liked, and the curtain didn’t stick. On
dit that the next production of the Society will bo even a
greater dramatic antique that “ Blow for Blow.”
Speaking of the ’Varsity, anew and happy feature in
the December examination ordoal is that students can
matriculate at the same time. Hitherto the matriculation
was a March orgy only, hut now the gushing graduate
can get plucked and Hayed over the same lire. Quite
an economy of mental stretch, isn't it ?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The marriage of Miss Laura Sandeman with Mr. John
Tindale, of Nantygellian, N.S.W., was intoned through by
Rev. A. W. Pain, at St. John’s, Darlinglmrst, on Bth inst.,
in the presence of a crowded house, including several
nurses from the hospital where Miss Sandeman had been
a ministering angel. The wedding itself was very quiet,
the bride wearing a demi-trained gown in white nainsook,
with Medici collar and puffed sleeves, and the invariable
mandarin blossoms, and bouquet of violets, camellias and
oaladium leaves; her one bridesmaid (Miss Sandeman)
wearing a grey cashmere gown over a vest of white silk
and floral toque, and carrying a similar bouquet to that of
the bride.

At Christ Church, Berwick (Vic.), on 6th instant,
occurred a somewhat fashionable wedding, the con-
tracting parties being Miss Janet Craik, of Kinoraik,
Beaeonsfield, and Mr. David M’Culloch, of Berwick. The
bride wore ecru cashmere with revers of cloth-of-gold,
bouquet of orange-blossoms, camellias, and snowdrops,
while the five bridesmaids were dressed in French grey
silk and armure with mother-o’-pearl ornaments, grey felt
hats and feathers, and gold cable bracelets, the gift of the
bridegroom. The presents, including a drawing-room
suite and several cheques, were multifarious and costly.
The dance given by Lady Charles Scott at Admiralty
House on 6th inst. was a great success, though the evening
was intensely cold. The grounds were prettily decorated,
but were treated as a spectacle only by the assembled
guests, owing to the crude weather, and dancing was the
amusement of the evening.
“ A wedding was quietly celebrated last Tuesday morn-

The couple took t’:c morning train for San Francisco.
Mr. Mills is a prosperous farmer and also a fruit-grower,
and with his respected bride has the best wishes of a large
number of friends.” This, from a late Californian paper,
refers to the wedding of a former accountant at The
Bulletin office, whose numerous Australian friends will
join in wishing him all health and prosperity.

The observations of Rev. Dr. Hyde, Pres-
byterian clergyman of San Francisco, on Robert
Louis Stevenson’s absurd Damien hysterics are
beautifully easy-going. The atmosphere of
Yankeeland apparently attenuates the virus of
Oalvinistic bile. “ What I said about the late
Father Damien,” remarks the good-humoured
Parson Hyde, “was perfectly true, but you must
remember that I said it in a private conversation,
and without any idea that it would, or desire that
it should, be given to the world. I always liked
Stevenson well enough, and we seemed always to
be good friends, though I regarded him as a bit of
a crank. Even now I don’t think he has any
particular hatred against me, or any specially
enthusiastic admiration of Father Damien. The
main object of his letter, I take it, was to get a
big advertisement.” Parson Hyde is evidently a
strong and philosophic man of business. Throwing
bricks at him is like pouring water on a duck’s
back. The novelist returned to Sydney the other
day from the Islands.
A lady-writer thus describes Marie Bash-
kirtseff in the Woman's World
She appeared one morning at the studio, in the autumn
of 1880, dressed in a white cotton blouse shirt, a dark
skirt, and with her hair twisted carelessly in a knot. At
that time she had lost some of her first beauty, but she
was still a most intellectual and remarkable-looking girl.
Not above the middle height, she had a finely-moulded,
rather plump figure; her hands, wrists, and feet were
admirable. Her hair was fair—a peculiar shade of warm
flaxen —her complexion an opaque white, while the ex-
pression of her fine grey eyes was haunting. One of the
first things Marie said on entering the dingy atelier that
morning was that she was painting the portrait of a
“ jeune homme du monde” in her own studio, a state-
ment which sent a pious thrill of horror through the
ranks of the French pupils. The next day the simple
student in the blouse had disappeared, and Mdlle. Bash-
kirtseff, dressed in a Worth gown and priceless Russian
sables, stepped in on her road to some private view or
afternoon party. That was her way; one day the most
Bohemian of Bohemians, with her lunch in a basket, her
hair twisted in a knot, and a joke for everybody that she
liked in the atelier; the next, as an exquisitely-dressed
lady whose conversation was of balls and parties.
We notice with pleasure that the Equitable
Mortgage, Discount, and Deposit Bank, of 4
Moore-street, Sydney, has recently been incor-
porated, and is now opened for business. This
bank has been formed for the purpose of assisting
those who may at any time be in pecuniary diffi-
culties and wish to avoid paying the excessive in-
terest which is too often charged. The bank has
secured the able services of Mr. Henry A. Birk-
myre, which should be a guarantee that clients will
be fairly dealt with. In these days of extortion, the
above institution should about fill a long-felt
want. *

Her Majesty's “ Meg, or the Castaway."
Criterion “Fedora.”

MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's “Frou-Frou.”

Opera Hoi’sk “ Fun on the Bristol.”
At Her Majesty’s business has been so-so
with “After Dark.' 1 M agg i( i Moore having quite
recovered. “Meg” will be restored on Saturday
for a fortnight only. Then Rignold will stagger the
Sydney public with a Shakespearian play—-some-
what hastily prepared —in the hands of, perhaps,
the strongest east over got together at this house.
This will be followed, mayhap, by “ Masks and
Faces,” with Maggie Moore as Peg Woffington, a
character in which her late display of rapidly-
succeeding emotional, comedy and tragic touches
ensures success, but more probably by “ The Cor-
sican Brothers,” with some entirely new and
highly-sensational stage effects.

At Sydney Criterion bouses have been
payable, during the past week, but “Frou-Frou ”
has by no means caught on as it deserves. It will
be replaced after a three-weeks’ run by “Fedora,”
represented by a very strong cast. The name
part in this play—written by Sardou for Bern-
hardt—has been enacted in Australia previously
by Mine. Majeroni and Miss Jeffreys-Lewis, so
playgoers will have sonic standard by which to
measure the impersonation of Miss Achuroh. B.
and B.'s Melbourne contingent return shortly and
re-open in “A Fool’s Paradise,” on the 29th ; but
at present we arc not at liberty to reveal the
Oharringtonian destination.

“Paul Jones,” now about to enter on its
sixth week at Sydney Royal, shows little signs of
a falling off in public favour. Much of the success
is due to the sweet, clear, full, not to say plump
tone of the chorus and the fine orchestration that
has latterly prevailed. We are somewhat weary
of the two mariners, but, as the public welcomes
them to its loving arms every evening, that doesn’t
go for much.

hissed loudly with charming unanimity. No doubt
someone should have been hissed, but certainly
not Air. Clark, who didn’t make the arrangements,
and was not responsible for the breach of faith.
The collection drew £ll5 for the charities. The
public having strongly objected to pay ss. and 3s.
for admittance to the organ recitals, prices were
lowered after the first one to 2s. and Is.

Rev. Charles Clark has been attracting
largo audiences to Sydney Centenary Hall, and
we strongly suspect that he is netting more money
than any individual performer now in Australia.
By the way, he might with advantage reconstruct
some of his perorations. That of the Oliver
Goldsmith lecture has a slightly now-my-dear-
young-Ohristian-friends smack about it ; and
Ids story of another Oliver—a widely different
spirit—yclept Cromwell, is wound up in
a way that would appeal more favourably
to a British audience. Half his listeners here are
native-born, perhaps a third of the remainder are
Americans, Continentals, or Republicans who
have no particular reason to admire England so
fervently, have no faith in her Greatness—with a
very large (1 - and are perfectly confident that she
doesn’t just now lead the world in anything but
shoddy-making and nigger-slaying. Thursday
night’s lecture will be on Thackeray, and the
season will conclude on Friday night with Dickens’
Christmas Carol. Then the lecturer skips off to
Brisbane.

At Bondi Aquarium a dry Sunday has
shown that rain and not religious fervour is the
most powerful advocate for Sabbath observance.
As dry Sundays empty the city, and consequently
the city's “pubs,” the publicans are thinking of
petitioning Parliament for continuous wet on the
Day of Rest, or the sudden stoppage of musical
entertainments given by free ticket or otherwise
on that day.
The carnage at the Gettysburg Cyclorania
is now being symbolised in Sydney streets by
death on a pale horse personified by a large, florid,
red-haired person mounted on a whitey-grey steed
with a red tail—understood to signify the warmth
of the hereafter—and large feet. Both are alleged
to be hired by the directorate.

The performance of “ Blow for Blow ” by
Sydney University Dramatic Society, was chiefly
remarkable for the absence of hitches. Everyone
seemed letter-perfect and fully cognisant of when
to come on, where to stand, and how to move
about, though some of the exits were the reverse
of impressive. For this result Mr. Fred. B.
Norton, the professional coach, is presum-
ably responsible. It is impossible other-
wise to speak very highly of the perform-
ance, for the building conveys sound badly,
and except from the Misses Marks and Studdy
and Messrs. Lopez, J. A. Wood, and Mackay,
scarcely a word reached the lower end of the hall,
where, during four weary acts, people sat in patient
contemplation. Josiah Craddock was played by
an imposing person at least five feet in height,
whose meekness would discount that of Job.
Charley Sprags was noisy enough, but through
defective enunciation failed to make the most of a
very “ fat ” part. Possibly, however, he was dis-
concerted by the fierce glare that a rival amachure
exponent of the part levelled at him whenever he

t-eurs forcibly reminded us of our triumphs with
our first paint-box. The act-drop, a view of the
University on a blue ground, was apparently well
uainted, but so small that it resembled one of those
views that occupy the centre of large cotton hand-
kerchiefs- The audience was chiefly composed of
ladies mostly young and attractive, and their
generous applause will doubtless nerve the
students to nobler efforts.

The Bdisonian phonograph, shown privately
hv Mr. 0. L. Garland to a representative audience
the other day in Sydney, is similar in construction
to that now exhibited by Professor Archibald in
Melbourne, and both will shortly bo shown
jointly in the former city. Judging from what
wo heard, the human voice has not the metallic
distinctness and power necessary to trace an
impression on the cylinder that will after-
wards return a loud, clear imitation. The
voices of those who spoke into the phonograph
in our presence, afterwards were emitted in a
somewhat Punch-and-Judyish, here-I-am-down-
the-well manner, while the notes of the cornet
solo, deposited in its receptive bosom by one of
Godfrey’s band in London six months ago, were
dashed off with all the brilliancy and a large share
of the power that characterised the original effort,
oven to the triple-tongueing. Perhaps, however,
the speakers were to blame, or perchance the
machine sulked a little on local option grounds.

“ The Lucky Lot,” a play with which the
inextinguishable Darrell has already stormed
other puds of Australasia, was produced at Mel-
bourne Royal, on Saturday night. Handsomely
staged and supplied with several live horses and a
specially imbecile ballet, “The Lucky Lot ” is
hardly the kind of entertainment to be dismissed
from memory with a hasty curse. It is a work of
e ven merit, disfigured by no streaks of nature or
I catches of common sense. Every now and then
the leading lady slings in a ballad, while her male
accessory is understood to be chortling “seconds,
and the struggles between them and the orchestra
are not lacking in interest. Moreover, the pre-
sence of an aged parent, impersonated by a fax
simile of Sir Henry Parkes, gives something of
Australian colour to all parts of the agony
wherein this weird ancient shakes his snowy
mane. Parkes is the whole beginning and
end of the plot, so far as can be made out. Many
years ago he was robbed of his Stella and certain
papers by a ruthless “ betrayer,” and now in the
drama the betrayer is continually swooping-down
upon his victim’s dejected poverty with a band of
sheriff’s officers, whose determination to put poor,
broken-down Parkes into prison is arrested by the
resolute behaviour of George Darrell. It is during
(,ue of these periodical descents upon Parkes that
Darrell takes the daughter of Stella away with
him on a fiery steed, leaping a five-barred gate and
ambling round to the back of the scenes before the
sheriffs can follow suit. There is_ no sane reason
for whisking off the girl and lea\ ing the old man
to his cruel fate, but the heroic behaviour of
Darrell enables the curtain to descend upon
a situation almost as powerful as any to
be met with outside a circus. Ultimately
the betrayer is denuded of his ill-gotten papers,
and the play closes upon a vision of ’Enry
restored to prosperity. This grand old man is
capably represented by J. H. Clyndes, and the
betrayer, who has to sit and stand about a good
deal in order that George Darrell may jaw at him
and threaten him with firearms, is solemnly per-
petrated by Captain de Burgh. A young lady in
fancy dress (Parkes’s daughter) is exhorted to
shoot the betrayer through the heart quite easy in
the story, but she disappoints expectation by
dropping her gun and observing that she intends
to deal with him otherwise —a puerile line of con-
duct which is in harmony with the rest of the pro-
ceedings. Edith Blande assists Geo. Walton in a
little pantomime business, and sundry other
artists, including Royce, are deputed to form
rings round the distinguished author-actor-
manager while he strikes approved dancing posi-
tions and attempts to further justify his fatal
propensity for playing the hero in top-boots and a
red shirt. Although he has the assistance of a
small armoury concealed about his person, George
Darrell is not more impressive than he has ever
been in such parts. He walks in semi-circles as of
yore and attitudinises on the lines of a shop-
walker. Christine Darrell, who shares large capi-
tals with her husband, improves apace and wears
a variety of costumes with good effect, but her
singing on the first night was not sufficiently
charming to establish the artistic success of ‘ 1 The
Lucky Lot ” as a comic opera.

At the Melbourne Bijou there have been
good houses for “ The Balloon ” and “ Kerry,” yet
not sufficiently great to encourage the prolonging
of this bright bill over another week. For
Saturday, the B. and B. management announces
“The Glass of Fashion,” a comedy not seen in
Melbourne for some years past. On Saturday,
too, the Widow O’Brien begins another season at
the Opera House, where “ Held by the Enemy ”
is bringing William Rignold’s unfortunate run to
a fairly vigorous conclusion.

“ Frou-Frou,” at Melbourne Princess’, is
quite likely to find favour with the local aris-
tocracy, to" whom a study of sickly naughtiness
and costumes by W orth (of Paris) are matters of
enthralling interest. In such characters as Frou-
Frou, the glamour of Mrs. Potter makes itself most
felt. When she rustles into the domestic circle
cn route to marble halls, one finds no difficulty in
believing that the lady is really about to plunge
into the vortex of polite'dissipation and flash her
jewels at her guilty lover, and when the scene is
laid in Paris those ball-dresses by Worth are like
so many yards of realism. Since her first appear-
ance in “ Camille ” Mrs. Potter has not seemed so
much to the manner born as she does in the un-
healthy name part of Meilhac and Halcvy’s so-
called comedy. She possesses all the necessary
manner and millinery to represent Frou-
Frou up to a certain point, > and even
in the passages which demand artistic talent of
the actress, Mrs. Potter makes a picturesque,
eccentric pretence of getting there all the same.
Bellew is a subdued dream of beauty as Mona de
Sartorys, and Valreas is depicted in easy, Sass-
like stylo-albeit the indisposition of that young
man to tie Mrs. Potter into a true-lover’s knot
appears to be growing on him. Sass doesn’t even
clutch hold of Mrs. Potter’s arm, when she bids
him leave her in the virtuous custody of tier child.
Now, the lover who accepts notice to quit without
trying the effect of one electric grab, is a disgrace
to his country and an insult to the memory of Don
Juan. Such a man would never be able to celebrate
his 100th conquest with a supper like that more
experienced sinner over in Adelaide Miss Jenny
Watt-Tanner scarcely looks like FTou-Frou’s
sister, but otherwise she is estimable as usual.
The male parent, impersonated by E. Palmer, is
likewise acceptable to all who can appreciate a
joke. There is n" necessity for Bellew to ask
Mrs. P. it she found her'father “amusing,”
because the ludicrous old geezer has just been
sending the whole house into convulsions of
laughter. Unfortunately, he isn’t allowed to
black his face.

Another big event on Saturday was “The
Golden Ladder,” put up in place of “ Master and
Man,” at the Alexandra. The moving spirit in
this elaborate show is a parson, who keeps on es-
caping from destruction in various parts of the
earth. He gets nearest to sudden death in
Madagascar, but in London and suburbs the
assassins are considerably on his track. A
better-hated curate never taught the Word to
pore heathen, or wandered along green pastures in
pursuit of some mysterious title-deeds. And yet
he never gets killed once. J. A. Rosier made as
little as possible of this big part on Saturday, but
may be expected to wake up and show fight
shortly. Walter Howe, Albert Norman, Leake,
Glover, and others of a long, strong company
encompass the parson's death with commend-
able energy while Bland Holt passes a
cheerful time in manufacturing acid-drops and
responding to the cry of “shop !” Sometimes a
small boy lands him in the eye with a snowball for
adulterating the barley-sugar, or something, in
which case he retreats to his own fireside and says
funny things to his young family. _ Miss Virginia
Vivienne, in very short frocks, is an interesting
item of the family aforesaid, and Miss Merton
manages the business when the old man goes forth
to get snowballed. Take it altogether, “The
Golden Ladder ” is a loose-jointed affair, contain-
ing two or three original ideas and some literary
merit.

The Madagascar act, daringly conceived,
beautifully mounted, well played down to several
very minor parts, and worked up to a startling
Rule Britannia climax, is certain to be talked
about as a new departure in dramatic “ sensation ”
which at no point outrages probability. Mrs.
Bland Holt, as a Malagasy servant, gets a small
opportunity in this scene, the parson’s wife, as we
were nearly forgetting to mention, being nicely
played throughout by Maggie Knight.

Why don’t Australian theatrical managers
have a date, even if only the date of a first per-
formance, printed upon their programmes ?
Brough and Boucicault supply a decent, adver-

undone the thing they ought to do, and there is no

Melbourne theatrical managers have lately
been weeping over the awful fall of their Satur-
day night receipts, without seeming to understand
that the emblem of their despair is a football. The
“ national game” absorbs the nimble shilling, to a
somewhat deplorable extent, at this season of the
year. On a recent Saturday 32,000 men, women,
and boys stood around and howled while “ Sowth ”
Melbourne accomplished the muddy feat of doing
another glorious team. Elsewhere, mobs
watched minor struggles in the expectation of
hearing an occasional human leg break off at the
roots. Such a condition of affairs must militate
against evening shows. Not only do football en-
thusiasts lay out their silver prematurely—they
return home too late, and too exhausted by bar-
racking, to think, in most cases, of making a
further excursion into town. It is useless for
managers to draw up a petition against their
winter enemy. They had better try the effect of
religious influence by devoutly praying for wet
Saturday afternoons, followed by a beautiful
clearing-up of the weather at 0.30 p.in.

A London paper comments on the boon-
like quality of matinees for pros, out of work, who
can roll up and “depreciate their brothers and
sisters on the salaried side of the footlights with
that open-hearted candour peculiar to the dramatic
dead-head.” The writer also points out how care-
fully anything in the shape of new wheezes, or
business, is carried away by the professional por-
tion of the audience, and ultimately reproduced
by them as entirely original. However, the
number of original actors, like authors, is neces-
sarily limited.

Williamson and Garner’s Comic Opera
Company have made a capital start with their
season at the Adelaide Royal, although “The
Yeomen of the Guard” has not, judging from
outside comments, been particularly appreciated.
Clara Merivale has caught her first Australian
cold (so she informed an interviewer), and in con-
sequence has had little show of distinguishing
herself, so far. Fanny Liddiard, after a brilliant
reception, has had to retire into private life on
account of illness, and Billy Elton has not quite
recovered from the effects of his accident in New
Zealand. Imano has been well received, while
the old favourites—Vernon, Leumane, and Grundy
—get there all the same. “ The Mikado ” follows.

John Haynes’ theatrical “cricket” pro-

a boil ” ?

Wilson Barrett opens the new London Theatre on the

Miss Mauola, opera-boufle prima donna, the Marian
Burton of New York, obstinately refused the managerial
request for her to be photoed in tights as Paul Jones, or
one of those things—whereupon the manager got a sur-

box, and Hanoi a has t hrown up her engagement. Marian
Burton is understood to have the same objection, nor can
Nellie Stewart bear to be taken thus depicted.

Mrs. Potter has been writing to friends in New York,
who have rushed to the papers with this valuable copy.
She shows how her excellent friend, a certain Dr. Neild, has
lost his billet as critic for daring to write in her favour, but,
never mind, the doctor is rich and snaps his fingers at
’em. Truly does the Lady Potter write, in other graceful
words, that she has thrust herself down the throat of
the Great Public. But she doesn’t give quite enough
credit to Bellew, who has done something. .
Gus. Harris, the lessee of the Drury Lane Theatre, has

There have been merchant sheriffs, who took work girls,

not forgetting to draw the blinds down. The Bulletin
hopes that Augustus will not lower the dignity of his
office by giving ladies of the ballet a fly round.
Bland Holt is hoping to make a splash at Melbourne
with the new drama “ Pleasure,” one of Augustus Harris’
Drury Lane successes. The sensational scene is the
carnival of flowers at Nice. Percy Lyndall is helping to
work up the “business.” He played the hero in England,
Maud Williamson being the heroine, and Sass the villain.

The most lucky Australian theatrical who ever went to
England is Charley Wilmot, who will be remembered both
in Melbourne and N.Z. holding rather humble utility
positions, through he wrought up in the Southern Britain,
and got a nest-egg for London. Now he owns Terry’s
Theatre and the New Olympic, and leases the Grand and
Sadlers’ Wells. Hi* s old mate, Charley Walsh, meanwhile

A Melbourne illustrated paper depicts all the old
theatres of that city—Queen’s, Princess, Salle de Valentino,
Iron Pot, Olympic, Comique, Haymarket, but there were
also the Varieties, Pavilion (very ancient), and one at the
Criterion, while the Prince of Wales, also known as the
American Hippodrome, and Marsh’s Lyceum, Lonsdale-
street, are likewise overlooked. The Pavilion was in
Bourke-street, somewhere about Cole’s Book Arcade. The
Queen’s is the only old one that remains—being now a
coach-warehouse. You can look in and see where Brooke
made his memorable first appearance, as Othello, with
Fanny Cathcart and Dick Younge. The front elevation
of the building remains unchanged, with the lion and
unicorn, and entrances of the dress circle, pit and
gallery. There were no stalls then.

Edwin Booth’s representation of “Hamlet” at Water-
bury (U.S.), where they make the watches, was very
peculiar, for the wardrobe cars; with all the luggage, were
left behind, and a full performance of “Hamlet” was
given in tilth Century costume. Booth wore a tweed
walking suit, with a piece of string round his waist, to
which was suspended an old sword. People had come 40
miles to see the show and insisted on its proceeding.
In the English cities they are making bye-laws to
compel theatrical managers to drop a fire-proof curtain at
least once in the course of every performance. Such
tilings, like escape - doors, never wor£. When Drury
Lane theatre was re-built, after burning, the public were
edified with the sight of a man rowing a boat in a monster
tank on top of the theatre. Yet the place was burnt down
again. At a place in Melbourne —a very long time ago—
the Board of Health visitors found an escape-door locked
on the outside. You never can persuade a manager there
is ever going to be a fire in his theatre. All the other
matchboxes will be burnt down, of course.
Rev. Charles Clark leaves Sydney, per Birksgate, on

Rev. Charles Clark, when he comes back from Queens,
land, must give two or three lectures in the Centennial
Hall. When he preached his Hospital Sermon, last Sun-
day, at least 5000 deadheads could not obtain admission.
But that was a sermon. If he announces a couple of lec-
tures —one of them should be “ Oliver Cromwell; or,
Bible and Sword”—sooo people would willingly pay a
shilling to hear the “King of Lecturers”on the “Greatest
Prince that ever ruled England.”

Droll reminiscence of Billy O’Neill, Irish comedian of
yore, husband.of Anna Maria Quinn, the child-wonder,
and not the steady O’Neil more recently familiar in Aus-
tralia. Billy acted Ragged Pat, in “Ireland as it AVas,”
at Melbourne Royal, and was in a very how-came-you-so
condition. The audience hissed furiously. Billy laid his
hand on his heart, wobbled to the footlights, and ex-
claimed: “La-a-dies and gintlemin, Open coufission is
good for the sowl. I will confiss. Dhrink is the cause of
it.” Which recalls'again that amazing night when Emmet
was drunk, after “Fritz” had run about 10 nights, in
Melbourne. The Governor and Co. were there, and fit to
roll off their seats at J.K. Poor Blanche Stammers, act-
ing on the stage with him, first blushed with shame, and
then had to run off laughing. Strange to say, Emmet’s
success began with that night. The bhoys took him up.
Mrs. Bancroft has tried her hand at an original play,
and has made—especially when her practical knowledge
of the tricks of the trade is considered—a hideous mess of
it. Mrs. B. occasionally writes short lengths of wishy-

sion as to set one wondering how much natural talent
and poetic mind can be required of a brilliant stage-per-
former.

Toole was one of the first to give imitations of popular
actors from the stage. As a mimic, however, he had
presently several superiors, the best of all being, perhaps,
Herbert Standing, who seems to have given up acting for
the management of a new Pelican Club. It was a treat
to hear Standing reproduce the voice and manner of old
Buokstone, an unctuous comedian, in passages from
“ Richard the Third.”
“ Play Mozart; 1 can listen to no other music now,”
said the composer Chopin, when peacefully engaged in
expiring. After all, musicians are more appreciative of
opposition genius than actors. A dying tragedian would
want to hear one of his own longest soliloquies turned on
by a phonograph, we guess.
A correspondent reminds us that on one occasion during
Clarence Holt’s Australian tour he was unable to appear,
through illness, at a premUre at a Melbourne theatre
which, in consequence, remained closed. The Age, never-
theless, came out with a scarifying critique next morning
in which the play, the star, and the scenery got Sheol.
Now we may inform our correspondent that, history re-
pealing itself, a certain critic lately followed closely in the
footsteps of his Melbourne progenitor and lustily abused
“ A Doll’s House ” and everything therein without placing
foot inside the theatre's door. Fortunately for him, in
this case the show came off.
Says New York Mirror But there is no more reason
in compelling the theatres to close up on Sunday in
Cincinnati (where the people desire them open) than
there is in barring the doors of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York. Both provisions are opposed to the
needs, the desires, and the comfort and happiness of the
people in the two cities.
A London writer speaks of Ada Rehan, the American
actress, as “ the indescribable and irresistibly fascinating
example of female humanity, who bewilders sober London
audiences, and upsets all conventional notions of good
acting by the freedom, boldness, and complete originality
of her method. Criticism is dumb when she appears,
simply because its ordinary canons cannot apply to her.
She is something wholly apart, and the spectator recog-
nises a new charm, and does not care to inquire how it all
comes about.”
Here is a genuine specimen of the letters the London
manager is deluged with from the Dutch-built, stage-
struck village girls in the vicinity of the great metropolis :

Dear Bulletin,— Did you ever see a theatrical manager
blush ? I doubt it. But if so, you have probably struck
a record. Surely, however, were suclr a freak of nature
possible, it would happen when one of these gentlemen
chanced to look over one of his own advertisements in the
Melbourne dailies. Taking one consideration with
another, they have lately, in their way, become unique,
and the enterprising Yankee may henceforth take a very
back seat indeed. The Messrs. MacMahon have not only
managed to produce the “ absolutely best, most original,
and newest play ever seen in Melbourne,” but have also
managed to get it witnessed by absolutely “ the largest
and most discriminating audience ever assembled within

Another eminent manager's “ hundreds-turned away

the piece in an-inverse ratio to the length of the adver-

I have seen at least ten plays produced this year in Mel-
bourne for each of which a long and prosperous career
was foretold by the professional judges; and yet to the
habitual first-nighter it was plain that each would shuffle
off its mortal coil so soon as a new piece could be got
ready. The palace of truth in matters theatrical lias yet
to be erected out here. Or perhaps they actually do not
know.

entrusting this part to a woman. It would be an experi-
ment worth making, and probably come nearer Shake-
speare’s ideal than any masculine lump of clay is likely to
do. I asked before how it was “the firm” had not a
single good soubrette. I might also ask how it is they

“The Premier Permanent Building Society
cases sustained their reputation yesterday by
commencing the week with an adjournment.
When the names of the defendants were called,
Mr. R. .1. Murphy (who had on a previous occa-
sion made himself a “shocking example” in

until he sobored-np. Eo. B.) failed to appeal-,

AMbourne Age.
If Lord Jersey wishes his reign in New
South Wales to be a conspicuous social success,
we would strongly urge him to keep his eye on the
food department at Government House ; for after
a careful study of the question we have come to
the conclusion that the invisible “ bond which
is declared to unite Australia with the beloved
mother country consists chiefly of victuals. This
is a material age, and even the noblest instincts of
tradition would fail to bear up against a pound of
tripe. Loyalty, so far as we can see, is the ex-
clusive virtue of the gorged section of the com-
munity, and when Governor Jersey stands in the
refreshment-room of the vice-regal residence on
those festive occasions when the perspiring multi
tude pounds around in the joyous dance, and sees
some prominent supporter of the Crown clutch-
ing blindly at the tarts with his hands and
feet and tail, and putting the blanc-mango
in his hat, and the jelly in his hinder
pocket, and concealing the cold meat down
his back, we trust we will find consolation
in the fact that the cause of Imperial unity is
looking up. No doubt he may reflect at such a
moment that the individual who props up the
state looks a good deal like a gorilla shovelling-
pastry down a drain-pipe, and may wish that he
wouldn’t gnash his teeth to such an extent when
lie snaps at the cold fowl, but will do well to
smother these reflections, for that person without
an “ h ” who gallops at the victuals as if he were
rushing on a flying enemy, is the standing emblem
of these “ bonds ” which are always being “ drawn
closer,” and without him all would be a blank.
Lor though tarts are a sticky thing and have a
tendency to lie like an undigested tombstone on
the stomach, and confectionery in general is
clammy and sodden and tough,-and is like unto
the cold, damp nose of an infant elephant, and pu-
is liable to sit up suddenly and bark if it hasn’t
been sufficiently killed before being put on the
table, and cold foivl is an object that suggests
a thorny ostrich boiled in cactus, yet it is of such
things that loyalty is chiefly constructed. Also
the pancake is a solemn and unreliable nourish-
ment, and when it is thrown up in the air with a
view to cooking the other side of it the chances
are that it flies right out at the chimney top and
speeds over the roof, and falls with a sickening-
sound in the front garden, but still when it is
picked up and the grit blown off it, it will do
more, if eaten by a retired publican at Govern-
ment House, to promote a feeling of reverence for
monarchical institutions, than two barrow-
loads of noble sentiment and lofty inspira-
tion. Military pomp may be a good enough
tiling to keep up the sentiment of loyal
fervour, but even the sight of a Governor
inspecting an awkward-squad armed with a rusted
stove-pipe apiece has a tendency to pale, and the
glamour of a big gun that looks like a rusted
steamboat-boiler quickly fades away. But hash
is immortal, and soup is an end iring thing, and
the halo round the oily ham is an undying
radiance, and pigs’ feet are generally a, more power-
ful influence than patriotism, and it the victuals
show no falling-off, Governor Jersey may live out
his term in peace, and report, when lie goes home
again, that he left a loyal community behind him,
and that the gladsome “ bond ” is still Holding but.
The band will now strike up “God save the
Queen !”

A torn and blighted thing that used to he
a bailiff is sitting up in a bed at a, Southern
hospital as a, living commentary on - the enipti-
ness of human dignity in general. About;
a week ago this obnoxious ruin went forth
in all his glory to seize the goods of a woman in a
suburban cottage, and, like the Assyrian in front
of Jerusalem, he knew not the fate that was in
store for him. The only occupant of the .house
was a lone female, who was cooking some dinner,
and when he explained that he had come to remove
all the property, she fainted backward -. into (he
hash without offering any resistance. Then the
minion of the law proceeded to load up a cart with
the chairs and table.---, and (he sewing-machine,
and the eradle and other things ; and lie had got
the house pretty nearly empty, and was just
throwing himself gleefully outside the door with
a carpet on his back, when a large, coarse
man appeared at the back entrance. He
appears to have been an excitable individual,
with no tendency to calm, dispassionate analysis
of character, for when he found the house cleaned
out and his wife fainting- in the hash, he instantly
mobilised himself and declared war. The scene
which followed is described as being of an
invigorating character. The bailiff heard some-

and dropped the carpet, and then the two men
revolved in a cloud of dust, and whirled round and
round in a rushing cataract of legs and hair and
damaged ears, and flew about in a shapeless pile
of unhinged limbs and ravening ferocity. 1 hey
were kicking and cursing under the grate one
moment, clawing on top of the cartload of furni-
ture the next. Then they would be seen falling
unexpectedly out of a top window, and in another
minute they were pounding the cellar to frag-
ments with their feet. It was estimated by com-
petent witnesses that they jumped over each other
eighteen hundred times, and they looked so
numerous that the officer on the beat telegraphed
for assistance, stating that dangerous
maniacs were at war in the street. W hen at last
they were pulled asunder it was found that the
bailiff had nothing.left on him but one boot, and
he had also swallowed a dishcloth and was bruised
and shattered all over, and nearly half a hundred-
weight of coal had been driven into his back. His
antagonist had his eye full of hash, and most ot
his hair was gone, and all his clothes had vanished
except a shirt-stud and a. box of matches. Then
it was discovered that the bailiff had seized the
wrong woman's chattels by mistake, and all the
trouble might have been averted if both parties
had viewed the matter on a philosophic basis,
instead of acting like a sackful of wild cats. I lie
chief offender has since been fined one shilling,
bailiffs being comparatively cheap this year; and
his victim is in the hospital where all sorts ot
foreign’bodies are being picked out of him with ’
pair of tongs.

As a rule, when the gruff but honourable
stage parent, or the dramatic uncle with the coal-
scuttle full of diamonds, departs this life, his last
act is to bequeath a gigantic sum tied up in a bag
to his'nearest relative, the same being a lovely,
kittenish head of hair, on condition that she
marries within twelve months, and that her
husband is anybody on earth except an individual
named Napoleon Fitzgerald, or words to that
Also, it invariably happens—on the stage
,—that Napoleon is the only man on earth whom
the girl will marry, and, consequently, the stu-
pendous -amount in the bag falls through, and the
property, which has been meanwhile held in trust
by the dishonest solicitor round the corner, goes
i o the nearest villain. But the story ot a British
testator who tried this sort of thing in real life
seems to throw a shadow of doubt on the old
dramatic proceeding. This ferocious patriarch lott
his ill-gotten pile to his daughter, on condition
that she didn’t marry the only man she ever cared
for; and to make things certain, he further pro-
vided that the money was not to be paid over till
she had married somebody else. Then that artless
maiden rose up calmly, and cheated the dead
millionaire, and sold the lawyers, and trod on the
old man’s last will and testament, and left the
nearest villain, who had been confidently reckon-
ing on the money, lamenting over his down-
fall. She hunted up a blear-eyed, bottle-nosed
pariah of 02. who lived on borrowed gin, and
cigar-stumps picked up in the street —an offensive
driveller who was always begging for crusts and
snuff —and proposed to him, the conditions being
that after marriage he was to have a cottage to
himself and an allowance of £1 per week, so that
he could drink and snuff himself to death with all
reasonable despatch. On these terms he promptly
shambled before a clergyman, and that astounded
gentleman, finding there was no lawful cause or
impediment, forthwith attached an attractive girl
of 20 summers to a disgusting bundle of old rags,
which couldn't even write its own plebeian name,
and which smelt like a damp umbrella and a
tenth*rati! public-house. Then the happy bride
collected the fortune, and when, some eight
months later, her toothless proprietor was found
dead, but still clutching an empty bottle, it is
presumed that she married her old lover and lived
happily ever afterwards—at any rate, she kept
the money. The truth of this story is vouched
for by an auctioneer and a building society, and is
backed up by the affidavits of a morphia-fiend
and the proprietor of an immoral publication, and
further attested by the solemn declaration of a
syndicate, two Social Purists, and a number of
hangmen.
Deibler, the French executioner, avers
that the guillotine is the least painful way of
killing criminals. “As to the notion of there
being any after-life,” he adds, “I can only say
that I have seen nearly 300 heads fall under the
knife, and I do not believe a word of it.
Walter Besant, in a pamphlet, wants to
know how the Society for the Promotion of
Christian Knowledge can reconcile their sweating
practices with that communism of goods preached
by the founder of the faith they profess to up-
hold. He accuses this “ Christian Society ot
grasping, ungenerous treatment of the authors
—especially women-writers —whose books arc
the source of its tremendous revenues, and
general beating down of all its employe
under the plea,' of course, that the work is the

ing concern is no more “Christian than is

The trump-card of Stanley’s journey, as

Ids tent, and whenever the doctor had to absent himseh
for his duties she crouched at tire door, faithful as a
spaniel, and would permit no intruder to approach the door-
way. She performed her work in the most unobtrusive
manner, and she was the only one of her sex who did not
abuse the privileges we generally concede to women in
the camp. On the road she carried the doctor s satchel,
and on nearing the resting-place she was as industrious as
a bee in collecting fuel, and preparing the surgeons

Confidence.
Confidence in one’s sell goes far towards suc-
cess. The man who is able to tackle an ugly job,
fully sure that he can devise the ways and means
of successfully completing the work, is the man
valuable to an employer, and the one of most
value to the community. All men are not, how-
cver, gifted alike in this respect; one man has the
capacity to think the matter out and reason with
himself how he can best overcome the difficulties
before him, while another will be overwhelmed
with the trouble. This latter kind is frequently
met with in this life, men who have not the force
of character to fight their way through difficulties,
nor the energy to carry their undertakings to a
successful issue. They are mostly thin, nervous
creatures, with a slow pulse and a weak heart.
They are physiologically constructed the same as
the robust and persistently energetic men. Such
men should take good exercise and generous food,
abstain from excitement, and where indigestion
and sallow or pale complexion, indicates antenna
and sluggish liver, a proper course of Clements
Tonic will do much good. It will invigorate the
stomach and bowels, quicken the pulse, and revive
the depleted strength of the heart, aid digestion
and strengthi-n the nerves and promote the action
of the skin, liver and kidneys. Clements Tonic
has been used with such satisfactory results, that
wo have great pleasure in submitting the follow-
ing evidence for perusal by our readers. The Rev.
R.Laverty, Port Macquarie, N.S.AY., writes:
“1 have much pleasure in bearing my testimony
to the efficacy of Clements Tonic. I was
promptly cured of facial neuralgia by the use ol
Ot emknts Tonic, experiencing relief in a few hours,
it is the best tonic I know.” Miss Emily Thorman. .
95 Wilson-street, (iolden drove, A. BAY.. says : ‘‘ 1
suffered with liver complaint and indigestion for
two years and could neither eat nor sleep, and was
reduced to almost a shadow. 1 tried all the reme-
dies I could think of. Reading of Clements
Tonic I resolved to try a bottle, and am thankful
to say it has made anew woman of me, and lam
only too thankful to be able to add my grateful
testimony.” H- F. Neale, Esq., Eoco. Depart-
ment, Wellington, N.S.W., writes:-“My
daughter has for the past seven months been suffer-
ing excruciating agony from neuralgia and also
extreme nervousness. I obtained for her several
so-called specifics but without avail. She had no
appetite and could scarcely eat a particle of food,
and was almost reduced to a skeleton from want ot
food and loss of sleep. I saw Clements Tonic
iiiffiily spoken of, I determined to try it and after
she had taken six doses the pain left, and she at
once commenced to improve. She has taken two
bottles and is quite herself again. I shall always
recommend Clements Tonic.”
A Broken Hill (N.S.W.) resident having
viewed a piece of ground with an £80 three-roomed
iron house on it, bought the land soon after. Going
to view his purchase, he found it w ith difficulty, foi
the house had gone, and then, brimfull of curse-
words, he went for the vendor, who coolly said:

Judge Docker, of N.S.W., recently awarded
a man seven years’ hard labour and 30 lashes for
a certain unmentionable offence. 1 lie equivalent
punishment under the present English code is, it
will interest people to know, twelve months im-
prisonment. Either the moral natures of the
English are so utterly perverted that they regard
bestiality with complacency, and even admiration,
or else the Botany Bay lawmakers are an out-of-
date lot of images who should have lived m the
time of Nero. \\ hich can it be, The Bulletin

Gospel Army Ardill denies that he is in
any way responsible for the notorious Joe Bragg’s

South Australian record, it would appear that he
is by no means bald inside.
“ It is known perhaps to very few,” says

Spain simmers. Sagasta, the great Liberal

Last year France produced from grapes
23,000,000 hectolitres of wine, and herself con-
sumed 45,000,000 hectolitres, to say nothing of the
exportations. In other words, she “faked,” from
more or loss base material, 40 or 50 millions of

Now chat a Census Bill is upon the N-.S. W.

“ Read Samuel, chap. 24, Book II.” David hav-

Lord became angry, and sent forth a pestilence

ought to be a solemn warning to Barkes.
When the English telegraph-operators
threatened to strike the authorities took steps to
obtain the assistance of former female tele-
graphists, who had given up their situations to
get married. What is the moral here ? Than
women should be excluded from any avenue of
labour in which they aspire to work side-by-side
with men?—or that they should be educated iu
trades-unionism and trained to join their male
fellow-workers in resitting the encroachments of
capital upon the reward of hitman labour ?
The Argentine revolution has shut down
for the time being, and the President has pardoned
all the insurgents. If he had refused to pardon
them, they would probably have hung him up to a
tree or tired buckshot into him. so lie wisely
assumed a forgiving attitude. And, besides, if he
gets the chance, he will probably blow the whole
lot of them at the stars with gun-cotton just the
same as if they hadn’t been pardoned, and if they
get a favourable opportunity they will crowd the
kind-hearted President into a bag along with a
large grindstone, and drop him into the River
Plate.
Dibbs was wrong in accepting Shepherd's
amendment on the N. S. -W. llttpr-abolition-of-
imprisonraent-for-debt Bill, to the effect that in
cases of libel the judge should have the power of
sentencing a defendant, against whom a verdict
had been given, to six months’imprisonment, if he
(the judge) thought tit. This is utterly undemo-
cratic. It is as undemocratic as the proposal to
retain in the hands of the N.S.W. Ministry the
power of saying whether a fine imposed by the
Supreme Court for breaches of the Sunday lav
shall be remitted. Dernocmcy Insists that ike jury

The “ Freetrade Democratic ” Association
of Victoria is sending round the customary cir-
cular to the effect that leading articles, constructed
on sound Foreign-trade principles, will be supplied

evident that the Association knows that no editor
would pay for such gruesome bosh, even at waste-

One of the newspapers published by the
Interesting- Bennett family, of Sydney, describes
the j ust-aeparted (via America) Mr. Abraham
Hoffnung as “ A modern Maecenas,” and speaks
of him as—
The wealthy Hawaiian ambassador, who enjoys the
proud distinction of having been lire first member of the
diplomatic corps to visit Australia. By a member of the
diplomatic corps, 1 may explain, I do not mean a common
or ordinary consul, such as we have amongst us in plenty
and who are to he found in every large town on the face of
the globe. No ; the consul is as far beneath the ambassa-
dor as the corporal is beneath the general; and Mr. Hoff-
nung, as the duly accredited representative at the court
of St. James of the Hawaiian Kingdom, is a fully-fledged
ambassador There are only about S(f real
member? of the diplomatic corps in London, and they
enjoy many special advantages, such as exemption from
taxes, entrde to the London clubs.
This is really delicious, and quite typical of the
sort of thing by which so many of the nouveaux-
richee delight to be preceded on their European
tours. Thy American and German and French Con-
suls-General and the rest of the trash located in
Australia as representatives of foreign powers will
now thoroughly understand how mean and in-
glorious are their positions compared with that
magnificent representative of the quarter-acre king-
dom of niggers and leprosy. “Mr. Hoffnung,”
at whose residence all histrions, painters and
musicians who could afford to dress decently—
the ,upper-crust, in short, of the Bohemian world—
were always welcome, we are further informed,
“Is a Knight Companion of the Order of Kalakaua»
Knight Commander of the Crown of Hawaii, etc., Chevalier
of the Portuguese Kingdom, and a Knight of the Order of
Jesus Christ.”
What queer things do happen in this world ?
* * *
Speaking of ambassadorships, the present
writer once had an opportunity of becoming an
ambassador. He once enjoyed the honour of a
somewhat lengthy conference with his Majesty
the King of Brooker Island, up alonga New
Guinea, allee same place where blackpfeller bin
kill Mistah Ingham, The King, never having
made the acquaintance of many, whites to speak
of, barring those whom he had had the privilege of
eating, was a rather indifferent English scholar,
but we chose to interpret his remarks as meaning
that we could go and represent him at the Court
of St. Petersburg or Timbuctoo. Brooker Island
and its dependencies are pretty nearly as big as
the potato-patch kingdom of Hawaii,’ and so it
may yet happen that we will ambassadorially
arrive in London with a stern resolve to take the
official starch out of Abraham Hoffnung, Esq.
By the way, King Kalakaua, of Hawaii, is
lo visit London in October. According to this he
may be a fellow-passenger to the Big Smoke with
his ambassador aforesaid. In the interest of the
prestige of the Hawaiian monarchy, Ambassador
Hoffnung had better wear the crown and the rest
of the royal rig himself and allow the King to
“ stay home at the ho-tel ” —as His Majesty, most
of whose English comes from American sources,
pronounces it. It is arranged that Kalakaua is,
while in England, to reside not in London, but in
Bournemouth. This is excellent'strategy, but The
Bulletin will be sorry for the numerous consump-
tives who haunt that sleepy town, should they
happen to get to leeward of of His Majesty’s
dusky staff.

A person who calls himself “an ex-
colonial Governor, ” and who, even if he is only
“ poking borak,” has evidently “been there,” writes
to an English paper:—
The matter of speeches is not of great importance, and
may be left, if convenient, to the composition of the
private secretary. It is always safe to say that a charity
bazaar, or the first stone of a lunatic asylum, marks aii
era in the history of the colony ; that such things are the
product of the highest civilisation that ttie world has
ever seen ; that “we” are becoming a nation ; that, we
must keep our place in the front rank ; that the colony is
the finest country in the world, its climate tlie most
salubrious, its scenery the most magnificent, and last,
but not least, its people the most ineffably superior and
sublime.
Poor old blighted “ex-colonial Governor! Un-
happy pile of unhinged intellect and shrieking
incapacity! Vision of shattered ambition, ami
dislocated hopes, and grammar that is rent
asunder —you have struck a patch ! It is “always
safe ” to make these observations, for the public
expects nothing better from any person sent out
by.the Colonial Office to “govern.”

Avery interesting Sydney socio-religious
development is the formation of a band of Metho-
dist Sisters of Mercy,. “ whose costume will consist
of a well-fitting black dress with large white collar
aud cuffs, and black and neatly-trimmed straw
hat. Though distinctive, it is not conspicuous,
and is in every way becoming,” say the Church
authorities, evidently wishing to disclaim imita-
tion of Romish methods. We notice that a most
essential question has been omitted from the list of
tests demanded from the lady-applicants for
admission to the new order. It is this —Will you
solemnly promise to for ever give up mashing?
Will you wear thick boots like the nuns, and
abstain from trying to marry the first sick squatter
who comes along?
# * #
The Weekly Advocate, a Sydney clerical
organ, says that the “ Methodist Sisterhood differs
in almost every way from those Romish organisa-
tions which have caused Christendom to feel nu-
mixed repugnance for their very name. The
women who attach themselves to Methodist
Sisterhoods will have no unnatural vows imposed
upon them. We believe as little in women celi-
bates as wo do in celibates of the sterner sex.
They will be under no life-long obligations to an
Order. Their work will not be to mope in pious
seclusion or to pretend to do so” —and so on, &c.
The cause of the Wesleyan Sisterhood won’t be
much advanced by the ill-mannered sneers of some
mean anonymous cleric at the R.C. Sisters of
Mercy, ever foremost in charity, bravery,
purity and self-sacrifice in the hospitals, con-
demned-cells, leprosy-stations, fever-dens, and
bloody battle-fields of the world.

Owing to some shocking misunders'ancling
Lady Hopetoun was last week allowed to accom-

bones without dying at all. It was her duty to
bear up and she bore up. At latest dates the
Countess, we are glad to learn, “showed no signs
of what she had gone through, beyond a slight
paleness.” Which reminds us that other influen-
tial persons, of the male sex, often go through
with undertakings which smell worse than bones.

Hint for the ladies’ clubs. In frisky, not
to say giddy Simla, India, they lately got up an
amazing tableau of “Bluebeard’s Chamber.” On
the curtain rising, the polite audience was aghast.
Tin- heads of eleven of the finest women in Simla
hung round the white walls of the chamber, sus-
pended by their long tresses fixed to pegs above,
while the blood streamed from their throats. Of
course, they had only thrust their crania through
the canvas, and some of the nice young officers
had had the job of tying-np their hair.

A much-needed reform (this The Bulle-

There was some talk in Adelaide over the
questionable taste of Governor Kintore in connec-
tion with the late railway smash. Kintore wrote a
letter of sympathy to the widow of the wealthy
M.B. (Cowan) and also sent his carriage to list
funeral. Mrs. Bullimore, who was poor and in v
private hospital, received no letter of condolence,
and Government House stayed away from tin

out nature the female is less reliable than the old

Kintore, on 19th inst,, promises to be a very suc-

North Adelaide have, been asked to make up sets
for lancers, and they are to represent Peasants,
Flowers, and the Kitchen. The only squares on
the programme will be danced exclusively by the
guests representing the above and they will adopt
a system, started in London some six or seven
years ago, of waltzing most of the figures, which
is a decided improvement as it is much better
than walking.

Striking testimony to the. emptiness of
land-boom speculation is furnished by the insolvent
story of Laoaton, of the Maison Doree, Melbourne.
This shorn lamb states that on his £9OOO share in

was changed into a fools’ paradise.

commenced and was kept up till 3 a.m.

In endeavouring to kill the imiukrti
Kemmler by electricity, the N.Y. authorities at
the first attempt stunned the poor wretcli, at the
second burnt his flesh, and at the third- kill* d him
From a logical standpoint no fault can be found
with a system leading to such results. The main
plea for capital punishment, we have always un-
derstood, is that it is a deterrent. The more tor-
ture, tlie greater the deterrent. Anyhow, Kemmler
is dead at last, and the American nation lias had
its feast of blood and burnt flesh and sensational
headlines.
Dr. L. L. Smith, of Melbourne, rises up
like a midnight spectre otit of an ash-barrel to '
state that unhappy marriages in most cases arise
from the parties being too young,” We endorse
this statement cheerfully. We were acquainted ■
once with a toothless goblin of 78, a gibbering
thing all feet and ears and unintelligible observa-
tions, who was badly in want of a wife to cheer
his declining years. So he offered his wealth and
his framework to all sorts of girls long girls
short girls, pretty girls, skinny girls, dark mrls’
and girls that.were fair, and girls that were°get-
ting up in years, and he had bad hick ail round
But at last he acquired a kissable little creature
with starry eyes and purls of gold, who thought
she could endure his society till he died and left
her all the money. But his hard, indigestible-
looking eye didn’t close in death for 22 years • he
hung out till he finished his century. And ’just
when he was getting over his 99th birthday his
wife concluded that he was immortal, and accord-
ingly she eloped with a person who played the
trombone in a band; and the patriarch left his
wealth to somebody else. She had married him
r.'hen he was 20 years too young.

Coroner Youl, of Melbourne, while sitting
on the unbeliever who was accidentally shot in
•Joe bymes’ tabernacle, rushed into some rather
unfortunate observations. “ You cannot,” he said
shoot a burglar who is coming in at your bedroom
window, for a man might shoot his own son or the
’over of his own daughter.” With regard to the
son comment is possibly superfluous, though we
know at least one father Who wouldn't mind much
if his son was shot, and we are acquainted with
eight sons who would cheerfully go out gunning
for the old man, and we can point to a family not
far from this office where both the father and son
are badly in want of being shot a little for the good
of humanity at large. But the other part of the
remark should serve as a warning to coroners not
to fool with illustrations or figures of speech.
When the lover of anybody’s daughter gets into a
habit of climbing in at bedroom windows it is a
that that young man needs demolition, and
if pr* oul would not shoot him if he saw him
shinning into a bedroom window in his house
then »ho or what, in the name of all that is
astonishing, would he shoot ?

Of the latest Melbourne railway accident
it is noteworthy that the persons shaken up, being
mostly second-class passengers, took their concus-
sion quietly and smiled at the notion of going for
heavy damages against the Government. One
man, when asked by a reporter if he intended to
putin a claim, said : “Wouldn’t that be rather

city men have not been so scrupulous, but tried

An interesting but tough statement from
sultry Townsville (Q.) casts a lurid light on the
morals of a locality where, in our time up North,
morality was scarce. Some two or three years ago
a gentleman of that region grew weary of coping
with the boot industry, so he took the loan of a
female who didn’t belong to him, and started for
the South. Consequently, when the lawful pro-
prietor of the borowed lady came home that even-
ing he found an extinguished fire, and a hungry
an d vociferous cat, and a smudged note hidden un-
derneath the china-dog on the mantelpiece which
explained that the writer had fled. Then he con-
cluded that he would walk over and console the
vanished deceiver’s wife in her misery, and lift her
up m a general way, and endeavour to lighten the
gloom, so to speak; and he went over and found
that afflicted widow just trading off her cow at a
large profit. He had expected to discover her in-
sensible on the .floor and so. damp with weeping
that the children would have taken cold from
associating with her, and he had intended to prop

a happy and prosp rous family until some two
months ago, when, in the course of a. visit to Mel-

and the female, he had vanished with. It was
rather an awkward meeting. The two men shuf-
fled their feet about on the pavement, and looked
aimlessly round a lamp post for a minute or so,
and then they shook hands and made some fierce
allusion to'the weather, and fell back - and looked
at Ihe two women, and wondered if there was

been re-established on an honourable basis, and

The Tablet, leading London li.C. organ,

Tablet says it is all a mistake to represent the
priest “as saying" that the seal of Confession is on
ins lips about a matter, for a priest absolutely
denies all knowledge of what is revealed him in
Confession. Wo never saw it put bluntly in this
way before, but it is obvious that the least stutter

“And the Stranger.”
A Sermon preached to the more respectable of the
Murrumhidijee Squatters, in the New Brick-
and-lron Church at Yallabriyurxj, oh the Hirer.
My friends, the importance of little words is
sadly neglected in the study of our Moral Law.
You who are Scotch and those who come from the
Far-down never know well wherein that guide is
summarily comprehended. Take, for instance,
the auxiliary “ Shalt.!’ Six days shall thou labour ;
there is no shuffling or begging the question. You
may be rich and have the means, or jioor and the
inclination, to loaf ; but the command is there all
the same. Yon must work if you would attain
happiness in this world and a chance of joy in the
next. This absolute necessity is what the late
Norman MvLeod called the “ Sacredness of the
secular calling.” But with many of you the case
occurs that you cannot obtain that work which
nearly everyone desires. Therefore you travel, or,
in the words of the Scripture, “ Take up your
beds and walk,” and that fulfils the six days’
labour. What shall I say to such of you
who can tarry on the Sabbath and yet take
not the Lord’s appointed rest? And how shall
I denounce the patriarchal dwellers in the abiding
cities of this hush, who refuse to the wayfarer and
the stranger the means of carrying out the Divine
command? Havel come to the little copulative
“ ark/?” The word implies that the stranger is a
fact, a necessity, a sine qua non. Y”ou who have
travelled in the East have seen the pilgrim with
his mat and brass pot (dhurre and ibtah) wander-
ing to the shrine of his religion or the place of his
annual labour. The co-religionists of this traveller
never refuse to take him in. In this Christian
country do we do the same? The oriental’s bed
and lotah are one swag. So long as labour is en-
couraged to deport itself to the door of the
Riverina employer, so long will there he swagmen
PERQUISITES.
CUSTOMER : “That dog of yours seems to take a very
intelligent interest in all that’s going on. He’s
been watching very intently ever since you
began.”
BARBER : “Why, yes, sir, occasionally my hand
slips, and I am unfortunate enough to snip off a
bit of an ear.”
CUSTOMER : “Eh! What then?”
PARBER: “Well, then, that’s where he comes in.
and daily rations. Most of you knew that paragon
of squatters who on Saturday evenings gave a
double portion of food to the stranger within bis
gates, and an invitation to rest on the morrow.
You also know the lady who pursues the same
plan. They, at least, recognise the fact that even
a swagman may wish for rest and a chance of
worship, instead of a dusty or muddy tramp and
an oath or two scattered at squatters in general,
and De last in particular. If there is an eternal
joy and sempiternal concert of bliss the departed
.qentle man, whom I have mentioned, is now one
of the orchestra, and the lady has her place pre-
pared for her in the house of many mansions.
Here a strange, and yet not strange, circum-
stance comes to light. Those who give the least
out of their abundance are, as a general rule, the
novi homines, who came to this great country as
pilgrims and strangers. Let me, without en-
couraging the perpetrators of the iniquitous
criminal libel law, instance a few in a general way.
Pre-eminently comes the Highlander who gives
“ naething for naething,” hut who started his
Australian career as a shepherd and journeyman
butcher. He has refused assistance to the man
who paid his passage out.
We are no\V within the gates of a hod-carrier
and navvy, and what did he dole out to some of
your poor nomads last night? One pint of flour,
the top scraped off, and bad at that. But he is
excusable :he has had his troubles. Scandal has
been busy with him, and a swagman had to belt
his hatter.
A little lower down this river is a young native
who issues half-measures of food, but makes it up
with a bushel of sneers and incivility. I was
working with him less than two years ago when he
was wood-and-water “ joey,” and that only as a
favour to himself and family. Let him pass, he is
chalking out for himself the road on which the
proverbial beggar rides.
Up the stream by a very few- bends, where we
saw the hushfire, some men have given place to
some things. You say they are from the Black
North. I deny it. I recognise the twang of my
country. I smell' the parritch.
It is the same here as in the army. TJrfc rankers
are the greatest bullies and most hated. I know
of one notable exception. He owns the most ex-
travagantly conducted station in Australia. But
he fed 150 men for three months'before shearing
atid has just given handsome presents to iiis em-
ploy, s. What must the profits he op an econo-
mical run'! What a comfoit the story of Dives is
to us of the Lazarus breed ! There 'won’tyeyen he
an eyehole in the needles prepared for some I
know.
Now, Christian friends, I enjoin you not to
bear malice against those lucky men to whom you
look for work. But Ido not conns-1 you to be too
lenient. Arrest not the work of nature by killing
rabbits, unless, indeed, you are paid for it. Do
not shut the gates on our broad highway, for do
not boxed sheep require hands to draft them ?
But do no damage, and do not swear. Keep
your breath for argument, useful disputation on
the rights of man. And if you are told to take up
your bed and walk, do so without murmur. Fin'd"
out the nearest Crown lands and camp on them.
It would also be well for you to notice if sheep are
depastured on reserves from the neighbouring
holdings. Such a crime it is your duty to report
(well authenticated) to the nearest Inspector of
Stock. Is is also your duty to make a feasible-
roadway into illegally fenced reserve". The
majesty of the law must be upheld. You must
also discourage the infidel interloper with the un-
godly tail. The law does so. Follow the law.
And do not be extravagant. If asked to help at a
bush-fire make a sound agreement that you be
provided with clothes to replace such as are
scorched. Where the evil man of wrath holds the
land perhaps it would be better to let the fire as
well as tin- heathen rage. It is kindness to do so,
and thus prepare or warn a sinner by allowing
him to smell Slieol.
Lastly, make homes for yourselves. Be no longer
pilgrims and pariahs. Give up the whisky that
starts you on the down-river road. (Mine’s beer).
You will then be able to shake off the dust from
your feet and despise the owner of the gates that
afford not protection to the necessary stranger.
I shall now read you a word or two from an old
English poet ;
Go, captain I tell the king
They who are sad on earth
In heaven shall sing.
We shall now sing—
I’m but a strayer here—
Heaven is my home.
Earth is a desert drear—
Heaven is my home.
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.
Walter Besant, in re John Morley’s asser-
tion that there are not 50, nor even 20, English
men and women living by authorship only, asserts
that by the writing of novels alone there are at
least 50 who make over a thousand a year, let
alone a vast number, especially ladies, who live on
incomes of a hundred or two made by authorship.
The new guns imported for the defence of
Melbourne can only be fired at the rate of £4O a
shot, and every time they go off the public debt
can he heard accumulating. When that invisible,
but long-anticipated, enemy comes along, and the
Defence Force rouses his angry passions and bank-
rupts the country by aiming £50,000 worth of
ammunition at him, and never hits anything
except the spectators at the other side of the bay,
and then £120,000 of gun bursts in pieces, and
kills six generals whose widows will all have to be
pensioned, and the proceedings close by the sack
of Melbourne and a heavy bill for carting away
the debris of the artillery and fortifications, the'
total outlay will be too awful to think of.
Chief Justice Wrenfordsley, in far West
Australia, wants all the globe to know he has
been called “a Journeyman Judge,” and “goes
for ” a poor little Western paper for only echoing
the now venerable jibe of the big Eastern ones.
One Dogberry said : “ And, masters, though it be
not written down (as in this case) yet forget nob
that 1 am an ass.”
A prisoner sentenced at Sydney last week
prophesied that by the time he had done his five
years tlie judge would, be dead. Which recalls
Ned Kelly’s celebrated prophecy, foretelling that
the judge who .sentenced him to death “would
soon follow him.” Judge Barry, who seemed
greatly impressed by the prediction, only lived a
week or two after Kelly’s execution.
Ex-Premier Dibits' stretch in gaol is be-
ginning to go round the American press, and will
stretch out to twelve years tty the time it is across
continent. The ’Frisco press will find he was the
original Old Prisoner of La Perichole. “For
twelve long, weary years, with this little pen-
knife, I have bored through the stones of my dun-
geon, and in twelve more years I shall be free.
Ha, ha ! Free 1”
Reprieved.
It is a subject of history that on a certain
occasion a poor wretch was lying under sentence
of death for a crime of which he had been con-
victed upon evidence exelusirehi circumstantial.
Fortunately, just as the law was about to take its
course, through the intervention of facts brought
to light apparently by miraculous interposition, a
reprieve was obtained, and the real criminal after
wards clearly convicted and executed.
Happily such an event is not of frequent occur-
ence, hut in a few instances the danger of relying
upon circumstantial evidence atone, has been
demonstrated where the victims have lost what is
most dear to them —their lives —in a way which
has been properly designated judicial murder.
The mind instinctively shrinks with undisguised
horror from the contemplation of such a catas-
trophe. Better to let a hundred guilty individuals
live, although it may be to suffer the pangs of. a
conscience burthened by the frightful incubus of
their cranes, than fo deprive one innocent person
of his life, which once taken is lost for ever. Pity,
too, that all the actors in the tragedy should, by
too great a reliance in the infallibility of their
judgment based on indirect testimony and their
self-assumed discriminating powers, suffer the
subsequent torture of the reflections which must
inevitably follow their participation in the events
attending the calamity. The converse of such a
case is happily a matter for hearty congratulation.
For instance, when a fellow-creature, long time a
sufferer from pain and wasting sickness, falls
under all the darkness and paralysing influence
of a sentence of death prematurely pronounced
upon him by those whose superior reputation
should qualify them to determine, but is relieved
from the dire dilemma by recourse to some com-
paratively simple expedient hitherto withheld,
either from ignorance of its value or prejudice,
and a fatal obstinate adherence to conventional
usage. Such a result has times without number
been achieved by Waimer’s safe cure, in some
instances when life has evidently trembled in the
balance, and it looked like a toss-up whether - the
flickering taper of existence was to he maintained
or not, and that, in spite of all the Sympathy,
skill, and experience of honest and kind-hearted
physicians arid attendants.
Examples such as the following can be adduced
ad infinitum. “To Messrs. H. H. Warner & Cos.
Cobbin Station, Jindalyhe Monaro, N. S. Wales,
June 10th, 1890.—About eight months ago my
stomach became terribly swollen, and I became
very weak and could scarcely stand. I put myself
under the treatment of two doctors in C , but
after a few months they both told me they could
do nothing for me, but gave me up, saying, I
could not live a week. I think myself it was the
liver out of order. I happened to hear of \V aimer s
safe cure and gave it a trial, but at the same time
had not much faith in it. To my utter astonish-
ment before a-week passed my appetite returned,
and 1 gradually regained my strength. Now I
feel quite strong and active, having taken in all
15 bottles of the safe cure and 2 phials of safe
pills. My age is 65 years. I think it my duty to
write about my wonderful recovery, and would
like it to be known about my own neighbourhood
particularly, as 1 think many poor creatures would
be benefited by it. If you wish to have further
particulars there are several prominent people
rhont who can testify to tire truth of my
statement.” — ( Signed) Margaret Thompson.

ANCIENT ADVERTISING.
It is affirmed that the first advertisement that
ever appeared was one upon the face of the moon
intimating “lights out,” and that instantly it was
seen by Adam.
That certainly was before LAW-
LER’S, of Brickfield Hill, adver-
tised their celebrated and justly
famed pure bedding.
During the reign of one DANIEL—he of many
dens, and shades of Demosthenes —advertisements
were printed upon the back or brain-portion of the
Queen’s skull. There were other DANIELS
about seeking whom they could devour, and
SOVEREIGNS were, of course, in it, or thought
to be in it, but as it was found that “ Sovereigns ”
like “mugs ” were not very plentiful just then in
that country of “ wattle-bark ” and “ five-
corners ” that mode of advertising didn't come off.
In Greece it was the PUBLIC CRIER who
announced “booms ” or bade the people “come”
like Bret Harte’s poem of,the “Drum” saying
“come”—to hear our Town Hall organ at its
“ best,” whilst our own neglected talent cries
’twere better “ best ” were left alone. And the
crier, with his pipe and drum, sang out “Gome ”
Come and see our dusty streets and our dirty
lanes, and our gimlet-holed cigar-saloons, and all
other sights worthy of notice in Ancient Greece,
Mem : There were no PRIVATE BARS in those
days.
In New South Wales (a spot that’s in Australia)
The Bulletin acts as public crier for LAWLER
and SONS, whose Illustrated Burnishing Catalogue
admits of people in the country buying Furniture,
Bedsteads, Bedding, Carpets, and Furnishing
Ironmongery as cheaply as those in George-strcet,
Sydney.
In mediaeval times it was the public crier who
went abroad enumerating the goods that a certain
merchant had for sale. JUST FANCY !
Waal, we reckon we’ve improved a bit mighty
upon the days of the leather lunged “Greek,” as
a visit to our Legislative Assembly and its
corollary, the Doinain, will darned soon prove.
Houp-la ? Are you there, Billy ?
Yes; and a visit to LAWLER’S Warehouse.
008 Geoi’ge-street, will prove how the mediaeval
old paillasse has had to give way to their double
WOVEN WIRE MATTRESSES, at prices
ranging from 12s. 6d. to 25s.; and that Camp
Stretchers, with Wire Mattress combined are only
20s. Who, in the bush, would be without one?
CAMP STRETCHERS, with springy Woven
Wire Mattress, at 20s. Just think of it!
Have you “ snakes ?” You know —not blues. If
so, the Stretchers will make them turn green with
envy and disappointment at being baulked in
their playful little effort of twisting for you a
CRAVAT that might just as well have been
“ hempen ” as “ snake.”
In England, the first printed advertisement was
got up by Caxtoii, the celebrated printer, who
announced the completion of LAWLER and
SONS’ First Bedding Price List, and a book
called “The Pyes of Salisbury,” a holy and most
religious book, compiled for the guidance of “ sky-
pilots ” at Easter time.
In Australia, the first printed advertisement
w as one calling for tendersfor PURE, HEALTHY
and SUITABLE BEDDING by Governor
Phillip. LAWLER and SONS promptly secured
that order, and at A PRICE that makes us long
for a RETURN of the “Old Days.” Are you
anywhere about with your “History of Botany
Bay,” Mr. A., of B. ? If so, note LAWLER’S
LONGING DESIRE for the “old days.”
We long for the price that Avas got in a trice,
When each of us had of the pelf,
Quite more than enough of the blessed old stuff
To play little Hades with ourself.
In Ireland the first advertisement appeared
during the times of the melodious “ Curfew ”
chimes calling upon the innocents to hammock-up

Those who didn’t hear the Curfew-bell either lived
at a distance or were—Avell, deaf. Deaf to the
CurfeAv alarm, but not to the tick of the Peep-o’-
Day clock. In those days the Peep o-Dayf,TIM E-
keepers were not exactly as true as they should
have been, so the loyal members of the Irish
nation had to plant a “ sun-dial ” in front of theii
houses with which, and the light of a candle, they
whiled away the dull night-hours reading the su
amusing paper-and-paste combinations known as
Government proclamations. But LAWLER’S

proclamations and knoAv that its nine o’clock toAvn

IMPROVED PEEP-O’-DAY
clock, viz., 5s 6d.
Ye gaze—ah, ah ! —your Avonder grows
At FIVE-AND-SIX such clocks as those !
Why barely the figure of one day’s doze —
Or at sixpenny bars, just sixty goes—
My frame doth itch, my very nose
Doth tAvitch and tingle, aye, e’en my toes
Proclaimeth freedom from drear morning woes.
No QUARTERS lose I—ye gods, my foes
At FIVE-AND-SIX I prompt dispose.
(Pcep-o'-Day Ballad.)
In Scotland the first advertisement was one
Avritten by BURNS, the poet, regarding “ Cruse,”
the antiquarian. It Avas to the folloAving effect
The devil got notice that “Grose” Avas a-dying,
So whoop at the summons auld Satan came flying,
But when at the BEDSIDE Avhar puir Francis lay
moaning,
And the deil saw ilk BEDPOST Avi’ its burden
a-groaning;
Confounded, astonished, cried Satan, “By G- d
I’ll want ere I tak sic a damnable load.”
Major Grose was no doubt devilish heavy, as
“ Burns” told us one day when we were having a
bit of a crack with him over a social tot; but all
the “Groses” that ever breathed could not bear
down the posts, or bedsides, or angles, or any part
of LAWLER’S “ iron” bedsteads, the strength of
Avhich is limitless as the rotatory motion of the
planets.

ture is Lawler’s Bedstead Show-Room ON THE

In N. S. Wales, Australia, the first hot tem-
perance advertisement appeared during the reign
of KING BRUCE, who, having NO public works,
railways, bridges, or buildings to occupy his
gigantic intellect (although provided Avith ample
funds most liberally contributed by the great
temperance portion of the community in the shape
of taxes) hit upon the objectionable TRAM-
TICKET ADVERTISEMENT, av here by all and
sundry Avere informed of the superior qualities of
Aarious brands of FIRE-WATER, Avarranted
strong and deep—deep enough to drown you, and
guaranteed to keep—yes, keep you down, Avhilst

The advertising card is of entirely modern
origin, although the Egyptians, Greeks, and
Romans kneAv something about advertising. They
accomplished the desired results through the
medium of posters, as several bills painted in black
and red were discovered on the Avails of the
Pompeiian d wellings. But papers Avere not very
plentiful just then. Give LAWLER and SON’S
the newspapers, and to heaven in the safe keeping
of the old Pompeites, Avith the old yaller and red
and black and tan posters of the Pompeiian age.

The reason w hy the Rothschilds broke up
their system of intermarriages was from a visible
physical family deterioration. One was alarmed
by obtaining naught but a large family of
daughters, like Mirabeau’s relative, who had an
infallible recipe for sons. The daughters have
made no more difficulty than the Disraelis about
changing their faith when it was politic and
peerages loomed up.
The professors houses in the yard of Mel-
bourne University, or what they call the Park,
are already half-a-dozen, and three more are to be
built. The Council wants to get its pro-
fessors properly in the Kraal, as a Boer would say,
properly yarded up—all chained to the shop-
counter. It can’t bear the idea of a professor with
a snug little home of his own, out of sight of the
show. He gets seditious and free-Sundayish.
Paddy M‘Mahon Glynn, the democratic
Adelaide political barrister, had a narrow escape
from a big smash the other day in an Adelaide
suburb. He was riding a hunter across country
and, jumping into a roadway, a waggonette
crossed his track. To avoid a general smash-up
he imitated Charles O’Malley by setting his horse
to jump over the vehicle, which was not quite
cleared. A woman-passenger was kicked on the'
leg, and Glynn had his head rubbed among the
road-metal.
Hon. Stuart Erskine and Mr.
Vivian, two very young and good-looking swells>
who have started in London a paper called
the Whirlwind, and have the from to publish
their own portraits in its first number, offer a
prize of two guineas for a really apt quotation
referring to the Whirlwind. After attentively
perusing the Whirlwind aforesaid, we send along
the prize quotation. It is taken from early
Chinese literature —the 4th Epistle of Confucius,
we believe—and is self-explanatory, brief, and to
the point : “ Mukkee-ilo.”
That* poor, old battered Aunt Sally, the
cx-Cracious Isabella of Spain, appears to have
made a somewhat unhappy sensation in the halls
of British royalty. When she was invited to
shine for a time in Britain’s Imperial palace the un-
happy private secretary, or other head flunkey,
had no idea that he was inviting a perfectly bald
monarch with a glaring wig that looked like a
flamingo standing up in a dish of tomatoes ;
neither did lie know that her Spanish majesty had
grown to be larger than a bank safe and that she
weighed more than a moderate sized pyramid.
Therefore when a mountain of hoarse, vulgar,
good-humoured flesh came along and revealed
eight square yards of back when got up in evening
dress, and the ancient harridan displayed a
hideous contempt for morals of all kinds, and
leered insanely at respectable dukes and earls, and
showed an undisguised tendency to fly with Bat-
tenberg, it was felt that monarchical institutions
had suffered a severe shock.
Details of the circumstances under which
the London telegraphists refused to cheer Queen
Victoria are now to hand by mail. “The
staff on duty at the Central Telegraph Office,
which numbered upwards of 400, assembled in the
central gallery at 10 o’clock, awaiting the signal
for cheering the Queen, which was to be received
from South Kensington. On the signal being
received, the superintendent in charge called foi
three cheers for the Queen. Silence was stead-
fastly maintained for some moments, and then the
whole staff of clerks burst-out into a groan. Three
cheers for Mr. Raikes were then asked for, and
this was also met by groans, still louder than
before.” In other words, 400 British Civ
servants were yarded-up like a mob of sheep in
order that they might, at a signal from the authori-
ties, by whom they were confined, burst into a
mechanical cheer!

Long has now between 20 and 30 horses in training
on his private course at I'hipping Norton, many of them
untried two-year-olds ; and if breeding in the horses and
astuteness in their owner go for anything, they should be
heard.from in the course of the season. Mr. Long, at
Warwick Farm, showed how good is Town Talk, the
three-year-old, by Epigram from Olive, own brother to
the aristocratic My Lord. Mr. Mount-Morgan Millionaire
Waiter Hall, whose stable is as closely allied to Mr. Long’s
as it possibly can be without an actual partnership, is
also very strong in prospective, and with ordinary luck
the pair should have a good show of sweeping the

Twice during last week-was an individual in-
nings of 100 runs and upwards (one of them a “ not out”)
scored against the Australians, the batsman in each in-
stance being a young amateur. Meanwhile an unheard-of
bowler, named Doffen, took four Australian wickets for
five runs—a feat which if performed by cur side would
cause the daily papers to break out into ten-inch capitals
of jubilation. For an explanation of all thil we must
await the return.of Billy Murdoch, who of all “Our Boys”
is the most competent to explain the sweeping change in
cricket relations between Hingland and Horstralia since
he last went “ home” in 1884.

Young Mitchell, the Yankee fighter, who is now
anxious to fight Jack Dempsey, must have improved
vastly, for when in Sydney he was no match for the light-
weight, Jack Hall. When they met at Foley’s, young
Mitchell weighed fully a stone more than Hall, but Hall
drubbed him unmercifully. Hall’s hands smashed up,
however, and he was unable to finish Mitchell off, so after
fighting some hours a draw was declared. Perhaps
staying is Mitchell’s forte. .

Given “ Billy ” Murphy in good health, the writer does
pot think “ Griffo ” has a hundred to one show of beating
him in their coming encounter at the Sydney Amateur
Gymnastic Club. Griffo is without doubt a very clever
lad, but he is a bit too fond of “making the play.” Griffo
may get all over Murphy in the prettiest style imaginable
for two or three rounds and William may appear as the
lamb for the slaughter, but Murphy may then go in for
his “hurricane act,”as they termed it in America, and if
Griffo stands up and “mixes it” with him, then Griffo
must go under, for so far as one can make out the feather-
weight never lived who could stand up to Murphy and
give and take with his right handers. By the way, the
“Rocks” boy lately had his finger badly bitter v v a

cipal fixtures at Caulfield in semi-state. Semi-state means
a barouche and two fat horses, one of which is bestridden

The young Australians —Burston and Stokes—
who went “ round the world on a bicycle,” are now pre-
senting their friends with the cloth-bound narrative of
how they accomplished that apparently impracticable
feat. A spirit of Stanleyish heroism pervades this thril-
ling history, and the authors are earnestly recommended
to trundle their machines through Darkest Africa, and
shoot a few niggers. Then they will be able to sell their
literary effort at ten guineas a time, instead of strewing it
about gratis.

British boxing, says an English writer, has de-
teriorated with British rowing, and although some
writers of repute profess not to comprehend the origin
of what they are pleased to call the decadence, still
the cause is very simple, and lies on the surface. It is
simply that other sports have taken the place in public
favour once held by boxing and rowing. Cycling is now
the chief snort of the English lower classes, and there it
must be confessed that England holds all the records.
Football, too, has made vasfstrides in popular favour in
the last decade, and among the upper classes lawn-tennis
holds the allegiance of thousands of youths. I regard
the change of taste with satisfaction. It is surely bettc.r
for a poor boy to go forty or fifty miles into the country
on his cycle on Sunday than it is to spend his time in
watching a prize-fight.

A Sydney Sunday paper, whose sporting writer
hews out his rugged’ similes with a loaded whip in his
left hand and a revolver behind each long ear, asserts that
Patterson, a Sydney pugilist of little note, “ will make a
niche for himself in the fistic scroll,” “A niche in the
fistic scroll” is good, but “ Patterson will punch for him-
self a perforation in the pugilistic passport that will bear
his famedown through the portals of the present to a palpi- i
fating posterity” would have been much better. If you
are going to mix your metaphors, why, mix ’em.

Almost every English writer except Bendragon
acknowledges that the black bantam Dixon beat Nunc
Wallace at all points. He asserts that only the Britisher’s
cowardice lost the fight. One papersays of Dixon that no
English hoy in the last ten years would have a, chance with
him, also that he had never seen anyone in better condi-
tion, and that a better-made boy has seldom appeared
anywhere. “As he stood lie reminded me of a perfect
model of a Tanagra statuette. He was as fine-drawn as a
greyhound, and the beautiful modelling of the back and
chest and thighs would have delighted a sculptor.”
Another writer points out that “We, Britishers, have a
terrible habit nowadays of putting people on pedestals
for the most ordinary performances, and if our idols are
always being toppled over, it is our own fault and we
deserve to look silly. Truly Nunc Wallace did not cut
such a ridiculous figure as Jem Smith, for instance, but
that he deserved the gush wasted on him any time these
six months past will now be claimed by nobody of ordinary
sense.”

The Melbourne coursing community intends
getting up a benefit meeting for Mr. W. S. Cox, who has

Many N.S.W. coursing men have lucrative recollections of

A convict confined in Yatala Labour Prison

tured.
London Figaro — a paper which devotes
the better part of its feeble existence to saying
greasy nothings about the Queen—now observes
that the gracious lady is “thoughtful in small
matters.” Which is quite true. Battenberg and
the foot-warmer (without which she never travels)
are small matters. So was John Brown, in nearly
all respects. Cold-blooded critics have even
asserted that Albert the Good was not a large
matter, when you once caine to kno ir him.
A Chinaman recently crossed a Niagara
bridge, intending to settle in Canada. He was
stopped at the Canadian end of the bridge by a
Customs’ official, who demanded 50 dols. tax.
The Chiukie couldn’t pay, and decided to go back
to the States. On reaching the bridge-end from,
whence he started, however, he, was met by a
11. S. Customs official who refused to let him off
the bridge unless he paid the American poll-tax.
By latest accounts he was roosting on the bridge.
According to London Daily Telegraph,
a curious incident occurred at the Royal Military
Exhibition, where an automatic photographing
machine stands in close proximity to one which,
in return for “a penny in the slot,” furnishes pic-
tures of celebrities and classic figures. A stout,
country person, interviewing the latter machine
in mistake for the former, was much staggered
when she received from the instrument’s drawer
the photograph of a lady with “nodings on,” and
was .for some time in doubt as to whether the
machine had taken a great liberty, or merely
passed to her the picture of an earlier customer.
Charity begins at home, and stops there,
as a rule. It is wonderful how business-like some
men are. The treasurer of one of the Sydney
hospitals has written to the Rev. Charles Clark
requesting him to forward at once the proportion
of the collection made last Sunday that falls to that
institution. He must think the preacher carried
home the collection in his hat, whereas he had
nothing to do with it. Surely it would have been
better for Mr. Treasurer to have been present to
claim the swag at the end of the service. We
wonder if the committees have been as prompt in
thanking Mr. Clark foi’ his services ? Was Shake-
speare right in saying, “Mercy is twice Vilest ? ”
Somebody has published a book professing
to deal with the Cockney language, in which the
author asserts that born Londoners invariably say
“ piper” for paper. The Bulletin would like to
hear this statement endorsed by any Cockney now
in Australia, or by any Australian who has heard
the word “piper” applied as above mentioned.
There is little difference, to our way of thinking,
between the dialect of the local larrikin and that
of the Whitechapel “boy,” save in so far that
the latter never fails to clip certain words. The
London urchin, if we remember rightly, shrieks
out “ Evenin’paper.” It is up in the North of
.England that one hears the language altered
almost beyond recognition, “express” being a
word in point. Boys rush about selling—or they
used to—the “Leeds Axprass.”

votes—just as the best way to sw’im a stream is to go as
far as you can in the first plunge. When women get votes
they will gradually learn how’ to use them properly and
will ultimately use the hulk of their power in a democratic
way.
A gentleman very well-known in southern
musical ranks booked for Bombay some mon'thg
ago, but why' on earth he wanted to go there
I nobody could make out, especially as he had only
| been married a month and was leaving his better,
half behind him. A lady preceded him by a
month or two, bound for England, and her lady
companion—a friend —accompanied her as far as
I Bombay. The musical man duly appeared on the
I scene, and—well, the lady-companion has been
returned to Australia, and brings a nice story with
her. The eloping pair had an attachment for each
other long before they left Australia, but the
parents of the lady—who is not good-looking, but
is wealthy, in the shape of mining-stock—
objected, and the disappointed suitor promptly
got marr ed to another girl. As matters now
stand, there is an abandoned wife, a happy pair
doing Switzerland on silver-stock, two parents
j longing for revenge, and society thirsting for a
| bigamy or divorce case.
THE CABMAN WHO HAD TO BUY
HIS WIFE A NEW FROCK.
From the WOLVERHAMPTON CHRONICLE
We have but just learned of the thrilling experi-
ence of the well-known cabman, Charles Green,
who for many years has been employed by the
Wilson Cab Company. His experience, as re-
lated below, is as interesting as it is extraordinary.
It appears that Mr. Green had occasion recently
to go out of town, remaining overnight, and was
obliged to sleep in a damp bed, and thereby con,
tracted rheumatism in the. most severe form. It
seemed to settle all over him ; he was brought
home, put to bed, and for more than eight weeks
could not move hand or foot. His agony was
such that he would scream if anyone came into
the room for fear they would touch him. His
knees were swollen to three times their natural
size. He was as near crazy as man could be, but
at the same time retained his faculties. Every -
thing was tried without benefit. In despair he
was taken to the Wolverhampton Hospital, where
he remained four weeks, at the end of which time
he was even worse than when admitted, and the
medical gentlemen who attended him at the
hospital told him that they could do nothing more
for him, that his case was hopeless, and he was
discharged as incurable. He was taken home,
where his wife persuaded him, as a last resort, to
try St. Jacob’s oil, which was procured from
Weaver, chemist, 42 Dudley-road, Green remark-
ing at the same time, in a joking way, to his wife,
‘“that if St. Jacobs oil cured him he would buy
her a new frock,” little expecting, however, that
he would have that pleasure. His wife then had
a double interest in curing her husband. She
applied half the contents of one bottle to his
knees, rubbing the parts vigorously for half an
hour when she left the room for a few minutes.
On returning she was surprised to hear Green say,
“ I shall have to buy a new frock, for I can turn
myself and move my legs.” Continuing to use
this famous oil, Green commenced to improve,
and after using the contents of four bottles he was
out and on his cab in all weathers, and as well and
hearty as ever ho was in his life. He was laid up
four months altogether, perfectly helpless, could
not move hand or foot. This was such an extra-
ordinary and almost unheard of cure, we deter-
mined to ascertain, if possible, what sort of thing
this St. Jacobs oil really was. We, therefore,
called upon Mr. Weaver, the chemist above
referred to, who stated at once what he knew of
! Green’s case, and personally vouched .for the above
statement, and stated further that, while Green’s
cure was perhaps the most remarkable, he knew
of numerous other extraordinary cases which had
come under his immediate attention where St.
Jacobs oil had cured people of rheumatism and
neuralgia after every other' means had been re-
sorted to without avail. Mr. Weaver said the
sales of St, Jacobs oil were enormous; people
invariably speak in the highest terms of its power
to conquer pain.
IF YOU WISH
To be worried into an early grave by the petty
inconveniences of this paradoxical sublunary—if
you wish to lose your trains, your trains, your
temper —if you wish to arrive at your business
premises in the morning disposed to quarrel with
everyone you come in contact with, and to arrive
home of an evening in a fit mood to abuse your
wife, baste the baby, kick the cat, or, indeed, for
the matter of that to “kick the bucket,*' in a
sudden fit of splenic apoplexy, why, buy one of
those cheap, trashy, tnade-up-to-gull Swiss atroci-

ing, the reputation of which is unrivalled, the
durability of which is assured, the construction of

order, and, in the event of accident, can be re-

ceived his medical education in the leading college s
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
Ho has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi j
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-

i quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case,, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed

pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by lire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
neaidy 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

Chinamen can reason and feel injustice, and it is
exceptional with them to be vituperative. Let us
look back a few years and imagine ourselves near
Yallabillirig, at a sheep-yard belonging to a
mutton-magnate. The tucker is scant and bad,
the wages are bad, and the new overseer acting as
manager wants to make them worse. The Chows
have given a week’s «arning. They have been
shepherding for ten shillings a week, and it is pro-
posed to reduce that amount to eight. At sun-
down the overseer will count their flocks into the
yard and stay all night, and to-morrow some station-
hands will come out. on horseback and take the
sheep till new slaves have been persuaded to toil
and moil in the room of the Chows for the mag-
nate aforesaid. There are three Mongolians, each
having a flock, and the overseer counts each of
them twenty or thirty sheep short, and says
they’ll have to pay. If he had ridden away he
might now be alive. If he had ridden away there
would have been one murder the less in murder-
land, and the Lord might not have been entreated
to have mercy on a yellow soul. But he stopped
to watch the sheep, and next morning could not
be found. The Chinamen were there, however,
and got cursed by the stockmen who had
to watch their sheep. They even got a crack or
two with the whip, and quietly said “ Wha foh ?”
But the overseer had no final kick at the depart-
ing Chinkies. Where was he? “Nosavee. Last
night count ’em ship. This morning take um
walk. Plenty look sheep. Get um chick ? ” So
they went and got their “ chicks full amount
too—but the overseer was not to be found. For
weeks they hunted, black-trackers traced him
round the yard and round the hut, and he was
given up for lost, when the three Chinamen quar-
relled over a game of fan-tan. One of them
quickly walked into the police-camp and gave him-
self and his mates away as murderers, but until
he got a guarantee of being taken as Queen’s
evidence he would not tell the manner of
the deed or the disposal of the corpse.
The other two heard of his treachery anU took to
the bush; one to hide and die in a dog-trap, for
he con'd not get out after lowering himself into
the pit, the other to be caught starving near his
old hut. Then the two vied with each other in
giving evidence. The first! informer had
done the deed with a fire-shovel. One blow
on the back of the head “and then the
deed was done.’ Then they buried their
victim in the middle of the sheep-yard, and ran
the sheep over and over, and thus destroyed all
trace. They even let out some sheep over the
tracks to the hut, outside of-which the deed was
done. Did the informer escape ? Not he. He
was hanged. Promises to Chinamen are “No
savee.” The other got fifteen years and laughs
now at overseers, for he has now a pak-a-pu bank
in—never min'd.— Hiram Abiff.

“ Girl of the Future ’ in the street to-day, with
the Universal Review under her arm. Allen
and Tolstoi',! Kreutzer Sonata and—whatever are
we to call Alienism ? Allen talks about George
Sand, as the Beauty, but another writer asks
whether George Sand went in to improve the
species or merely to satisfy what Madame Roland
called “the necessities of a fine organisation'’—
though the latter would not desert her middle-aged,
uncongenial husband for the gay Girondin Buzot,
fervently as she loved him. Otherwise Madame
Roland would not—now—loom up so big.
A memory of Tom O’Brien, the veteran
and esteemed attorney, who handed in his checks
a week or two ago. Tom had a knotty case over
the Commodore Nutt Hotel,-Melbourne, where the
disputants were all Hibernians, and, of course, the
legal shillalegh flourished. Tom cleverly fished a
witness—say Parthrick Flarnagan—out of the
enemy’s camp, and got him in the box. “ Wlio’ll
be reshponshible for me ixpinsiz, plaze?” “Oh,
Mr. O’Brien will, that’s all right.” “Misther
Aw’Brine is a very good mahn, but I prefer the
money in me hand.” Five shillings was hoisted
up, “ Fwhat’s this ? This won’t do me. I’m in
the Government empli, Twilve-and-sixpence is
me day’s wurruk.” Tom handed up 12s (Id, and
all he could get from the witness was—“I dish-

A first-rate test for a fresh arrival in a
N.S.W. country township to discover the number
of inhabitants, is the following :—
If it has a tannery .. .. the population is 1000

,, brick-yard .... ,, 1500
„ cordial-factory .. ... w . -4«2oi0
„ flour-mill .. .. „ 2500
„ brewery .... „ 3000
„ 2 breweries .... „ 5000
,, 3 breweries, 2 cordial-factories ,, 7000
Public-houses are not to be relied on, as pastoral
towns support more; than mining centres. For in-
stance, Dubbo, with 3000 inhabitants, possesses 35
pubs, whilst Wollongong, with more than double
the inhabitants, only has seven. Churches are
equally misleading—as a rule the smallest places
have a representative preacher for pretty nearly
every creed under Heaven.

Cornwall, January, 1890.
Dear Six 1 , —I write to inform you'that your
“ Allcook’s Porous Plasters ” ai’e excellent—a real
blessing. Whatever I may say, I feel I cannot
praise them sufficiently. I have given away
hundreds amongst the poor and suffering, and I
cannot recall a single instance where they failed
to give relief. They have been used by me for
complaints in the chest, livin’, kidneys, and spine,
with marked results, in fact, I know of -three
special cases out of many (one of chest, one of
liver, one of kidneys) where the sufferers had been
to the infirmary, tried many doctors, without axxy
benefit, and were fold that nothing more could be
done. I gave them your plasters, and after a fair
trial of them the result was really wonderful.
The sufferer in the chest no longer complains of
weakness, has lost all distressing cough, and is
quite strong. The sufferer from liver complaint
ixo longer colffplains of indigestion and pains in
the side and between the shoulders, but is quite a
different person. The sufferer from kidney com-
plaint no longer lies in bed nine months in the
year in agonies, but is able to get out of doors
every day, and is free from bain. I shall recom-
mend these plasters wherever I go.—With all
good wishes for the New Year, yours very grate-
fully, _

DANIEL O’CONNOR.
The Sydney Centennial Organ.
Proceedings at the inauguration of Sydney Cen-
tennial organ last Saturday commenced with
Mayor Burdekin’s brief and somewhat halting
introduction of Mr. W. T. Best; and that eminent
organist, merely bowing in response to the
thoroughly Sydney welcome accorded him, at once
proceeded to usher the then entering Governor to
his seat with that harmonic and worm-eaten
chestnut, “God save the Queen.” -Seated while
playing fwith his back to the auditorium, the
organist has little opportunity of either “put-
ting on frills” or of making a personal impression
on his audience, while so close to the instrument
as to have no definite idea of the full effect of
the work he is doing. Therefore an organist
can scarcely attain the magnetic influence
imparted by the personality of great artistes
in other musical walks. This was made so
apparent to the writer on Saturday that should
ever he become Mayor of’a big city about to erect
a new Town Hall, he would eschew organs and hire
a big band.
* * ■ #
Looking round, the catholicity of the assem-
blage, estimated from the issue of tickets at 4000
(when the galleries are seated with benches the
capacity of the building will be greatly increased),
was revealed at a glance. In the east gallery,
Lord and Lady Carington were sandwiched by
Mayor and Mrs. Burdekin ; Sir John Robertson,
who always reminds us of Professor Blackie, not
only physically but from bis gallantry to the
ladies, sat near Sir Alfred Stephen, still dark if
thin on top. On the other side of the vice-regal
party Cardinal Moran sat grimly between Post-
master O’Connor, who, not being afforded any op-
portunity for making a “ spaicli,” folded his arms
and almost succeeded in looking like Parkes, and
Treasurer M'Millan, whose thoughts, seemingly,
were not of the pleasantest -he has a tough
financial statement ahead. This gallery was
fully filled by members of both Houses,
military, legaland naval functionaries,consuls(Am-
bassador Abraham Hoffnung was sadly missed),
aldermen, and other distinguished deadheads.
The rest of the building was given up to the
general public, interspersed in the north gallery
by members of the theatrical and musical pro-
fession and pressmen. There sat Lecturer Clark,
with his sturdy henchman, the Rev. R. S. Smythe,
both looking as if it were somewhat of a bore to
rise so hurriedly from lunch.
* * *
The organ is of the wedding-cake order, con-
sidered both architecturally and as a piece of
colouring; in fact, the walls and ceiling of the
building suggest a huge piece of frosted-sugar-
work, white and pure from the confectioner’s
hands. As for its power, though it did not break
any windows, it is evidently too potent for the
building. It is impossible to get far enough away
to hear it to the best advantage ; and, as its vibra-
tions brought showers of the white coating from
the ceiling, it is fortunate that the inside roof-
covering is of zinc and not of plaster. Seated
on the timbers of the gallery, this vibration
so keenly affected people’s nerves that one official
said it made his knees jig, while a well-known
medico declared that it would vie with railway-
collisions in the production of spinal shock and
locomotor-ataxy. One could not help thinking it
a pity, in the interests of the evening press, that
John M‘El hone bad overlaid bare the scamping
of those foundations. What a holocaust there
might have been just as “our organ” blared its
loudest! Four thousand of the flower of Sydney
hidden by the ruins of her mighty Town Hall, at
once their executioner, their tomb, and monument J
# * *
On the whole, we are inclined to think that the
Mayor’s generosity has lost him a lot of good cus-
tomers, for at least a-third of Saturday’s audience
won’t hanker much after organ-recitals for some
time. The most popular number was, probably,
Guilmant’s “Allegretto,” a graceful and tender
thing, in which the “celestial voice” did great
execution; after that, the overture to “ Guillaume
Tell,” and Mr. Best’s own fantasia may be ranked.
Throughout, however, a predominance of what in
a singer we should call faulty enunciation, pre-
vailed ; sometimes the notes, in what, with a desire
to avoid technicalities, we may call the middle re-
gister, were “woolly” and the melody occasionally
seemed tangled beyond extrication with the linger-
ing sounds of preceding notes. However, the
organ had some grand moments, when melody
poured from it with fine flntings and gentle
pleadings in molten, golden notes, and anon, as
from a storm that rages ’mong thunder-topped
peaks down mountain gorges and through pine
woods, it burst forth into Titanic harmonies.
# * *
The organ, on the whole, may be regarded as a
municipal white elephant. The comparatively
high-fee series of opening recitals will doubtless
continue to draw greater or smaller crowds, but
inside three months even at million prices—say six-
pence—the attendance won’t bulge the walls out
on the side-walk. The genesis of the great Sydney
organ, and of the great Centennial Hall, which
will now almost rank with “Our Beautiful Har-
bour” among the local lions, was, in all human
probability, a desire to humble Melbourne. Un-
happily, however, the biggest organ in the world
has not been placed in the biggest hall in the
world. Actuated no doubt by the very best of
intentions, the aldermen have unsuccessfully (this
graceful simile will appeal to the professional in-
stincts of more than one city father) endeavoured
to crowd six pounds of sausage-meat into a two-
pound skin. But no matter.

Salisbury, from 1886 to . The papers already
discuss the question whether the Cabinet is shaky,

ceeding ss. per hundredweight for each and every hundred-
weight of wool the property of such owner or owners who
have resisted the principles of the federated unions of
Australasia, and that all moneys collected by such means
he placed to the credit of the Federated Trades and
Labour Council of Australasia as a compensation-fund for
the purpose of supporting the federal trade societies of
Australasia in the event of any future strike.

most of the Sydney papers.

will tell you. At any rate, you have had a good
opportunity of advertising your book, which ought
to have a good sale, if you do not delay its publi-
cation. Your greatest danger is Prince Bismarck’s
proposed visit to London, after which I hope we
shall hear no more about you. I fancy you are
just a Yankee journalist, with a taste for high-
falutin well above the average. Yon certainly
have shown no sign of genius, except in the art of
advertising yourself and your book. You
are a very dull public speaker, and your
manners are uncouth ; your literary style
is hoplessly involved; and I don’t suppose
you ever made an epigram in your life. But

and you shall have sole charge of the advertising
department of the Whirlwind, and I will give
you a bigger salary than that which Mr. Jennings
refused you. lam really anxious to join the circle
of your admirers, but you must first tell me what
it is you have done to deserve all this adulation.
I know you took a great deal of trouble to rescue
a German gentleman against his will, and that, as
soon as yon had brought him to the coast and
could no more intimidate him, he scampered back
again to the work you had disturbed. But there
is nothing wonderful in travelling about Africa
at the head of an army, with tents and
flags and gatling guns. The difficulties of
travel in those regions have been greatly-
exaggerated, and as far as I can see it is merely a
question of money and medicine. You are the
fortunate possessor, like many other unintellectual
men, of a sturdy constitution, and it has enabled
you to brave malaria. Is that your title to fame
and adulation? Then how can we sufficiently
honour those other explorers, who have travelled
alone and almost unarmed across far more perilous
tracts than any you have ever traversed ? How
can anything you have ever done be compared,
even for an instant, with the pluck and enterprise
displayed by such men as Mr, Paul duChaillu?
Years ago he went all over this forest that you now
fancy you have discovered. And how different Xvas
his mode of travelling from yours ? He made friends
with the natives and they helped him on from
tribe to tribe out of sheer good will ; you come
as a cannonading conqueror, and if they do not
welcome you, you shoot them down. His was a
mission of love, in the interests of humanity and
science ; yours is a campaign in furtherance of
trading companies and that blighting curse which
is called civilisation. Yes, I know you boast in
your usual modest way that you have unfolded a
new and glorious dawn for the people of Africa.
At one of your recent banquets you drew what
was meant for a harrowing picture of that-unfor-
tunate country, which had no policemen, no
)lost-office, and was three months away from the
Foreign Office. Are those the needs of Africa
that you propose to supply, when your trading
companies begin to ship their loads of Bibles and
brandy-bott’es?
True and bona-fide. Topsawyer, a wealthy
Australian newspaper-proprietor, had the top of
his office burnt up, with much of the plant, but
quickly plucked up, and was rubbing his hands
about the office, talking about making money.

Kidglove and Prunella remarked what a pity it

When the information was conveyed to
Kemmler by his gaoler, Daniels, that the law, in
spite of delays, must take its course, the prisoner
was dining. After he had eaten the last morsel of
the liberally-provided meal (so says the report)
Kemmler turned to Daniel and said ‘‘Well, old
man, von seem to take it harder than I do. bee

his chest —“ lam not nervous or downcast, arid I
know by your solemn way how my case has ended,
and learned my fate from your actions. But it
will be all right, Daniel. Don’t feel bad. I knew
all along we would have to part, and I was i*eady
to hear what your good old heart dreaded to re-
veal to me.” “The court simply affirmed the de-
cision of the lower court,” was the reply. “ And
that is,” said Kemmler, “that I’ve got to be
touched off .by this electric machine; Well, the
sooner it’s over with now the better. I’m tired of
this monkeying, for I guess the law’s all right. ’
“Three shocks had to he administered
before Kemmler was killed. After each shock
the body was greatly convulsed, and smoke arose
from the back of the victim at one of the points of
cintact with the wires. The results were generally
regarded as very unsatisfactory, and it is probable
that the system of execution by electricity will be
abandoned. ” — -Cable.

A Comparative Failure.
In olden times they used to chop
Off any guilty head,
Then folks were put upon the drop
And swung till they were dead ;
The hempen rope and gory block
Were failures, we confess—
But O ! the new electric shock
Is not a big success.
The shock was tried the other day
And didn’t do it slick ;
The victim failed to pass away
Till lookers-on were sick ;
Though Kemmler’s spirit petered out
In half-an-hour, or less,
His shocking death, without a doubt,
Was scarcely a success.
The current set him kicking thrice
Before he could expire,
And then, of course, it wasn’t nice
To see his spine afire.
How long the chap remained in pain
’Twere difficult to guess ;
One fact alone is very plain—
He wasn’t a success.
But though the Yankee novel-ty
Is not without a flaw,
Religion sees no reason why
The good, old-fashioned law
Should spare the lives of wicked men
Who die to please the Press.
(Which loves an execution when
’Tis not a big success.)
No, no, there are a dozen ways
Of passing in the checks ;
Although the law at last displays
Distaste for broken necks,
In time some scientific plan
Humanity will bless,
For working-off our fellow-man
With wonderful success.

The Brotherhood of Man.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Power that rules revolving spheres and guides
this whirling ball,
Whose hand is in the lightning’s flash —whose eye
is over all;
That Spirit of the Unknown Vast, since time its
course began,
Has taught in every pulsing throb the Brother-
hood of Man.
The prophets of the olden days—those poets of the
past,
Have sung in many a chant, sublime how it will
come at last;
How men shall all he comrades true and none live
under ban,
For then shall dawn on earth below the Golden
Age of Man.
With cloven tongue of living fire they speed it far
and Avide,
From torrid zone to Arctic seas—far o’er the
heaving tide,
And martyrs gaA’c their lives for it while flames
around them ran — •
They sowed the seed that bringeth forth the
j Brotherhood of Man.
And He who died on Calvary two thousand years
ago,
He Avore a cruel croAvn of thorns upon his bleeding
brow
Because his tongue denounced the proud and
urged this noble plan
To heal the Avounds of social life —the Brotherhood
of Man.
He preached it unto rich and poor ’mid scoffing,
scorn and hate,
And so they hung Him on a tree to please the
Proud and Great;
Let those who “ wear His mantle ” hoav —they fear
the rich man’s ban,
And hide the Truth He died to teach —the
Brotherhood of Man,
Go forth and preach the good nows now as once
the Master taught,
And strive to touch the rich man’s heart to ease
the toilers’ lot;
Go preach on highAvay and in town —to every race
and clan—
The noblest thought that e’er Avas taught—the
Brotherhood of Man.
For it have thinkers torture borne, and died un-
known to fame;
For it historic heroes bled in war’s grim iron game;
For it our fathers sternly trod the battle’s blood -
red van,
And preached to kings (with sword in hand) the
Brotherhood of Man.
Their words are knelling in our ears, their blood is
in our veins!
Fhall avc submit, as base-born thralls, to meekly
clank our chains ?
No ! Duty calls to do our share in life’s sad, nar-
row span,
The Golden Age on earth to bring—the Brother-
hood of Man.

The Gippsland (Vic. ) brown coal turns out
to be a dismal failure. Two tons of it go no fur-
ther than one ton of Newcastle, and the clerks in
the Melbourne Government offices, where the local
article is supported, are dropping into early grayes
through continuous shovelling on of coals and
poking of the fire.
Antarctic Exploration is to be discussed
at a Melbourne Town Hall meeting, but the
Mayor refuses the Hall to the Unemployed on the
ground that it would injure Australian credit in
London. What a powerful argument to a hungry
man! If the Mayor had simply said “No” he
would have been safer', but his argument virtually
amounted to this: “Our poverty mustn’t be
known—drive the ulcer inwards. It’s all right as
long as London (whence come the Mayoral Knight-
hoods) is ignorant.”
A lady armed with an infant was walking
down Pitt-street, Sydney, last Saturday, and.
another lady— a stout individual in gorgeous at-
tire-walked close behind her. The infant was
looking backwards over its owner’s shoulder, and
it carried a biscuit in its hand. Presently the
lady in the rear observed th s food supply, and
peacefully taking possession of it, she swallowed
it at one bite, and pursued her way with a calm,
oblivious look on her countenance. The astounded
offspring glared with a wild, sticky expression
after its vanished nourishment, but it was too
much taken aback to howl, and so the stout person
went off unmolested to search for more provendor
on the public highways.
Henniker Heaton and Harold Finch-
Hatton are lifting up two cracked voices and a
burst of murderous indignation in the British
Press. Each one says that he was the giant
intellect that first struck the idea of a Pacific
cable, and each one insinuates that the other
fellow has risen up secretly in the night to rend
his glory from him. But Henniker gets ahead
this time, for he manages to insert a long paren-
thesis, apropos of nothing in heaven or earth, in
which ho describes a banquet that was given
him in Sydney, and mentions that all the leading
men of the o >lony were there, and also gives a
fleeting side-glance at the victuals. Mr. Finch-
Hatton, on the other hand, seems to have had to
pay for his own grub, or else he didn't know how
to drag a banrjuet into his literary effort, and
unless he can show that he also had a public feed
he had better take a back seat.
Signor Simonetti, of Sydney, has modelled
in clay, for Syd ney Centennial Park, a colossal statue
of Governor Phillip, that grand old pioneer of the
good old Botany Bay convict system. The figure
is that of a dignified and majestic man, clothed in
the naval dress of the period, who holds in his
right hand the usual scroll, while the left rests on
the staff of a flag whose folds fall, with easy grace,
on the pedestal. The statue is in height about
fifteen feet, and at the base of its pedestal four
figures, representing Commerce, Mining, Agricul-
ture, and Navigation, will recline, butall suggestions
of the triangle and the gallows will be carefully
omitted. Signor Simonetti (for once the work has
been entrusted to an Australian resident) will take
plaster casts from his model, which will be for-
warded to England, where the bronze-casting will
be done. He is also at work on statues of the late
Mr. Challis, who bequeathed £IOO,OOO to Sydney
University, and the late Bishop Quinn, of Bris-
bane.
Two Sydney pressmen have just stepped
into billets, away from the smell of printers' ink.
and that will bring them more than two-pun-ten a
week reg’lar. Mr. .1. Whitely King, late acting-
manager of N.Z. Press Association, has been ap-
pointed secretary to the N.S.W. Pastoral Associa-
tion, and Mr. Coburn, Sydney correspondent of
the Arc,us, has been selected for a similar appoint-
ment in connection with the Steamship Owners'
Associations. This is an evidence that the_ capi-
talists are loading for b’ar. The conferring of
these appointments on journalists shows that there
are no flies on the capitalistic organisations when
they are in deadly earnest.
On the literary staff of a big Southern
daily is a stammering sub-editor of the blue-r.ibbon-
twice-to-church-on-Sunday order of architecture,
and an unregenerate reporter who has the good
fortune to be the son of a director in the concern.
The other night, so the story goes, the sub-editor
was horrified to hear the strains of “ We won’t
come home till morning,” or some still more pro-
fane ditty, trimmed with bibulous hiccoughs, pro-
ceeding from the reporters' room. Summoning the
leader of the staff he said : “ Sus-sus-send in the
mum-mum-man who is making that disturbance
to explain his conduct! ”• The delinquent entered,
but, horrible to relate, it was the director’s son
just “tonic’d ” enough to brazen out his faux-pas :
“ Fact of the matter, Mr. (hie)— I am a bit
souped-up. Is my explanation satisfactory ? ”
“ Qni-qm-quite sus-sus-satisfactory,” said the sub-
editor.
Mrs. Meinders, the heroine of .the schooner
Johanna (and widow of the captain of that vessel),
has been presented by the Melbourne Merchant
Shipping and Underwriters’ Association with a
gold watch and purse of 50 sovereigns in recogni-
tion of her bravery during.the voyage. Heigen,
the Johanna’s mate, has been given 25 sovereigns
on similar grounds. Mauritius fever had attacked
all hands. 'J he most pitiful thing of all was the
burial of the dead at sea. The mate would go into
the men’s quarters and find that one was dead.
He would then sew the body up in canvas. Mrs.
Meinders being at the wheel, and perhaps with a
heavy sea running, he would, weakened with
disease and hard work, drag the corpse as he
staggered along the deck. Having got it to the
side, he took out a prayer-book and read a few
prayers from it, only heard by himself. Then he
struggled with the corpse to get it on to the rail,
from which he rolled it into the sea without
further ceremony. Four times he had to do this
ere reaching Western Australia, where the vessel
put in, A pair of true heroes were Mrs. Meinders
and Heigen.

Charles Dudley Warner says that 1 he
“mind cure doesn’t require any faith, and the

We hear of a D.T. patient who lately out
off his big toe, under the impression that he was
cutting his throat. This outrageously funny man
reminds one of the crank who cut his throat with
a pound of pickled salmon. When the D.T. man
wants to sharpen his nails, he saws at his
weasand.
The Mount Athos monkeries have all been
burnt, damage one milion, says the cable. How
estimated ? One-relic was probably worth half-a-
million. A phial of St.* Slawkenbergiusls blood
was lost, worth £100,000. As for the wisdom-
tooth of St. Dusenbury, what ever value can we
place on that ?
President Kruger, of the Transvaal, said
at a banquet that those who blame him for the
deterioration of the local gold-mining industry
remind him of his monkey : “ The other day a
five was kindled in my yard, and you must know
that my monkey is very fond of mo. So, when 1
stood near the tiro, my monkey clung to my leg.
Presently, in twisting himself round he got his
tail into the lire. Well, and what do you think he
did? Why, instead of blaming _ the fire, he
actually turned sharply round and bit me. Yes,
the people who blame me about the depression in
gold-mining in the Transvaal are like my
monkey.”
Dear Bulletin, —This is the logical way
of looking at the Bill to re-impose the newspaper-
postage at present before M.S.W. Parliament.
Postage is practically a tax, and in accordance
with the law regulating the incidence of taxation,
must eventually fall upon the consumer— i,c,, the
newspaper reader. The imposition of postage,
therefore, merely means that the newspaper reader
will be specially taxed for a privilege which is now
paid for out of the general taxation of the country.
If it be urged that free-postage of newspapers is an
injustice to those who do not read them, the re-
sponse is that the educated and law-abiding part
of the community are newspaper readers to a man,
and if they are unduly benefited under this head
it is but a small return for what they have to pay
in general taxation for the benefit of the ignorant
who do not subscribe to newspapers.—Yours, J.P.

Her L[?]! Letter.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I THOUGHT to take the step between existence and
nothingness as silently as surely, but with your
face always before me, your eyes burning into
mine with rapture. Weak with the weakness that
came upon me that June night when I first met
you, I have not the strength to carry out that
intention. I cannot give up my life without one
word of farewell to you who turned a brief dream
of Heaven to a foretaste of Hell!
It is three years to-night since we first met. Do
you remember Mrs. Benson saying she wanted to
introduce you to her new governess, a girl of
decided opinions and peculiar ideas, and how you
said you liked women to differ from most of their
sex ? As she brought you to me I thought—“ too
young and too good-looking to be interesting,”
and then I irlet your eyes and changed my verdict.
I divined that you were prepared to dislike
me, and, partly because of that and partly
because I saw that in your face which in-
terested me, I resolved that you should
not have your way. So I talked to you a s
it seldom pleased me to talk to anyone, till your
indifference became attention, and attention grew
into acknowledged interest, and you looked into
my eyes with that intent and concentrated gaze
which in after days I gloried in being able to bring
into your face. When you had gone, I thought
“ If one could but sweep away the prejudices he
unconsciously possesses, and broaden many of the
opinions that have been so carefully narrowed by
his people and his class, that would be one of the
grandest men on earth.” And with this thought
there came unto me a half-formed wish that I
might be the one to give the character on which X
pondered, the finishing touches that would make
it a great one. I went to sleep then, and dreamt
of a pair of eyes that changed from blue to black
and then to grey. I cannot remember a day since
when I have not been haunted by those same eyes.
You came often after that evening, and oftener
s till, and at last made no secret that you came to
■see me. Oh, God ! the joy and the misery that
filled my heart when I awoke to the fact that you
meant to ask me to be your wife. “ Will that
which I have to tell him make any difference?” I
asked myself a thousand times an hour. “Tell
him and see ere he commits himself,” urged
honour. At last came the opportunity I sought:
fve were alone, and, fearing what I so well knew
you would say, I abruptly said, “I have some-
thing to tell you. ” Ere I could say more we were
interrupted. You whispered as you were leaving,
“ I am coming to-morrow to hear what you have
to say. I have something to tell you, too.”
A mad, tortured night followed, and the next
morning Mrs. Benson, aghast at my appearance,
would, not allow me to take the children into
school, but sent me into town to execute some
little commissions for her instead. As I passed
the post-office I saw you, and in conversation with
you, the one man in Sydney who knew my history.
I noted his surprised look as he saw us exchange
reqognitions, and I saw nothing else during my
outing. You did not come to see me that evening
or the next, and then I knew that the story that I
had meant to tell you had been told by other lips.
A week passed—a week that seemed to me the
length of 50 years. Again I met you in the
street. The sudden flush upon your cheek told me
you saw me though you did not seem to bestow
even a glance upon me. Deep and bitter was the
’Corn of the thought that scorched my brain —
‘Daughter of the notorious gambler and swindler
chough I be, lam still that man’s superior!” But
my disdain lived too short a time to stifle my love.
It passed from you, for whom I coined every ex'
cuse a woman ever dreamt of, to those who had
laboured to instill into your mind from your
cradle the false doctrine that men and women
should be valued, not by the true standard of in-
born worth or intellectual greatness but by the
base and artificial one of “ good ” birth.
Some of those who hear of my fate will chatter
about hell. I know this, if their idea of hell be
the right one, I shall think I have made a good
move when I get there out of the hell I have lived
dn since that day, you passed me so disdainfully.
I left Sydney a month after that unacknow-
ledged meeting with you and, by chance, took an
engagement in the remotest and hottest part of
Northern Queensland, where I worked, mentally
and physically, as one only works in the endea.
(vour to forget. But neither bodily discomfort nor
formidable brain-tasks could make me forget you.
Nearly two years elapsed, and then, yielding to a
desire I could govern no longer—the ever-present,
unconquerable desire to see you once more —1
returned to Sydney. And the day I arrived there
.was your wedding-day !
Drawn thither by an attraction I was powerless
to resist, I found myself among the crowd that
crammed the church to sec the “fashionable
marriage.” And so I beheld you again. I dared
not lift my veil, but through its blackness I
devoured you with my eyes, which left you but
for a moment to survey the woman at your side.
The women round me whispered : “ It’s a splendid
match on both sides,” and the men, with one
accord, said: “ What a lucky fellow 1” I saw
every glance you bestowed upon your bride’s
beautiful face, and a thrill of rapture shot through
me as I thought—“ ho has not unee looked at her
as he used to look at me.” The ceremony ended-
What was it that caused you, the moment you
turned round, to look at me? In spite of my
changed form, and my veiled face, you recognised
me. As one in a dream I heard a woman near me
whisper to another : “The bridegroom looks as if
be has seen a ghost.” She little guessed that you
had done so in truth.
I stayed in Sydney, for I khew I should see you
sometimes. I wanted to see if you were happy.
How often have I watched you when you knew it
not, and how much of a story you thought hidden
did I read? You returned from your wedding-
tour with another sorrow to bear —your marriage
had been a mistake. As the months passed your
face grew sterner and colder, and I looked in vain
for the impetuous flashes that once had been so
frequent.
At last—only yesterday, though to me it seems
months ago—we met face to face once more in that
deserted, out-of-the-way street, and neither scorn
nor pride, nor anything but love unutterable came
to my assistance when I heard your low uttered
“For God’s sake speak to me!” That meeting
was madness, to arrange another was worse. How
can I remember reason, prudence, right or wrong
when your eyes look into mine and make me
drunk with joy? There could be but one end to
the reconciliation of hearts like ours—an end in
which the innocent must suffer with the guilty. I,
wanting but your love, would be happy ; but you
(ab, my beloved !), you would have to pay too
great a penalty. I have no longer the strength to
tear myself away from you, and to remain here is
to see you. There is but one way out of it all.
My death will be a painless one, and it is so easy,
so beautiful to die knowing you still love me*
Nothing can destroy the rapture-of that thought.
It was worth going through the tortures of hell
to hear you .say what you said yesterday— aye
even tho’ hell eternal be the penalty. With the joy
born of your words thrilling every chord of my
heart there is little room for the bitterness of death,
I feel none of it, oh, my beloved, oven though I
write you—good-bye.

Sydney E. News praises Mrs. Mary

Adam Lindsay Gordon was a merit,ber of
S.A. Parliament from 1805 to 1800. He was
chosen to second the motion for the adoption of
fhe address-in-reply of tire Reynolds Ministry in
1800, and broke down. Here is his speech, as re-
ported in Hansard :
Mr Gordon seconded the adoption of the address. He
was not aware that he could offer anything additional to
the very full remarks of the hon. mover, who had, in his
opinion, said enough for them both. (A laugh.) lie did
not feel capable of speaking upon tire policy of the
copntry at large, and quite agreed that they wanted no
taxation except perhaps a tax on wire-fencing. (A laugh.)
Despite this ignominious failure, Gordon made a
very clever speech three months later, but he never
became a conspicuous Parliamentary figure.
A pathetic incident in the Premier Build-
ing Society ease was the statement made in court
by Mr. Chas. Smith, solicitor, who deposed that
after giving his evidence on the previous day, he
had been complimented by Mr. Nimmo. The ey-
chairman of directors, now figuring as a defendant,
said, “Mr. Smith, you spoke God’s honest truth.’’
The pathos of. that incident lies in the application
of it. We can see a long sermon upon human
nature in Nimmo’s words of gratitude. And in a
low, reverent voice let us sing
Oh, lawyer Smith, wo stand amazed,
Yes, quite amazed, forsooth,
To find that decent folks are praised
Who “speak God’s honest truth 1”
For what are they supposed to speak
That could be otherwise ?
Oh, tell us not that flesh is weak,
And any witness quite unique.
Unless he swears to lies.
Say, did your bosom swell with pride,
And did the blush of youth
Flame in your face as Nimmo cried,
“ You spoke God’s honest fflSith ?”
Say, did you (being nothing loath)
Put on a lot of jam,
Or marmalade, or lots of both,
And answer, “ Though upon my oath,
I would nut tell a cram ?”
Heigho ! in boyhood’s happy time,
Before wo’d lost a tooth,
We thought it was a sin—a crime
To hide God’s honest truth ;
But now that wo are losing touch
Of youthful joys, wc fetch
A pompous-breath when people clutch
Our paw, exclaiming, “Thanks, so much,
You’re not a perjured wretch.”
•'Tis odd, that when a stupid lout,
Shy, awkward, and uncouth,
Has kissed the Book, we seldom doubt
He speaks God’s honest truth :
But when, a man of cultured mind
d ust like a Christian acts,
A lot of people then we find
Who cry aloud, “ How good, how kind !
He stated simple facts /”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Ah, we’re just too late, Mrs. Browning,
for this trip. We shall have to wait half-an-hoar,”
said Surgeon Grocott. “ It’ll take that time for
the team to come back.”
“ Oh, it doesn’t matter, Doctor,” good-
humouredly replied the lady addressed. “ Nell
and I will be glad of the chance to rest after our
journey.”
“Yes, our State coach is rather trying on a first
experience,” rejoined the doctor, “ Indeed, a trip
at any time in it is a' bone-shaking ordeal. But
really, you know, if the Establishment is to be
frequently honoured in the way it has been this
in rning, we shall have to requisition a more com
fortable vehicle ! ” The doctor bowed as he spoke.
“ Doctor, you’re a flatterer,” said the lady.
“ But truly if this is the only conveyance you can
boast of, I shall not trouble you or it often. I
think I shall walk back to the Settlement.”
“ That’s not to be thought of, ray dear lady;
the road is too rough,” replied the gallant practi-
tioner. “ Rather than that we’ll harness up some
of the animals in the barracks yonder. They will
take you home more comfortably than you came.”
“ Well, doctor, they certainly could not jolt us
worse than your four-footed beast of draught there;
so if we are not to walk back we may as well have
the—the animals, as you call them.” She tittered,
and continued : “ I suppose they won’t bolt.”
“ Oh, you have no idea how smoothly and
surely they will go under the whip,” laughed the
doctor in reply. “They will drop into a nice,
easy swinging trot at the start, and will keep it
up all the way. ”
“ R-ally ? How funny!” The lady chorused
the doctor’s merriment. “ Then, suppose. Doctor,
we start homewards at three o’clock ? Will that
suit you?”
“ Yoiir wish is law, madam,” was the polite
doctor's response, accentuated by a courteous sweep
of the hand which held his hat, removed for a
moment to let the Cascades breeze fan his face un.
restrained. “ I will finish my rounds long before
that, and will be at your service to show you and
Miss Nellie all that is to be seen on the Ridge.
Meantime, I’ll send Mike back with the horse, as
wo won’t want it again.”
The horse and carriage which had been so dis-
respectfully alluded to in the foregoing conversa-
tion composed the State-equipage of tin? Norfolk
Island Government. The turnout was drawn up
a score of yards distant from where the party had
alighted. A convict in grey stood by the head of
the animal, and touched his cap as the doctor
went up to him.
“Take the rugs out, Mike,” ordered the sur-
geon ; “unharness the horse, and take it back at
once to the Settlement. ”
“Take it back, sir?” returned the prisoner-
groom. “Won’t you want it later on?”
“No,” said Dr. Grocott. We’ll be driven back
by horses of another colour.”
- The fellow grinned. “ The mag.pies, sir?”
The doctor nodded affirmatively.
Perhaps it is not necessary at this period of
colonial history to remark that “magpies” were
the worst class of convicts, the term having
reference to their “yellow and black ” clothing.
# * *
Mrs. - Browning, wife of an officer of the
“Fighting Half-hundred,” whose company
formed part of the Norfolk Island detachment,
had not accompanied her spouse from Hobart
Town, but had delayed her “exile,” as she called
it, till her husband had got their quarters com-
fortably arranged. Thus, while the 50th had been
on the island for some months, Mrs. Browning and
her little daughter, Nellie, aged nine years, had
been residents but a week when our story opens.
Brief though her domicile was, it had sufficed to
make the lady acquainted with —and tired of—
the monotonous characteristics of the Settlement,
as the headquarters of the Civil and Military
E tablishments was styled. She had accordingly
accepted with pleasure the invitation of Dr.
Grocott, senior-surgeon of the Civil side, that
she, with the child, should accompany him on his
next duty-visit to Longridge and the Cascades.
He would promise them, he said, some magnifi-
cent views of landscape and seascape, and at
least one “ novel sensation.”
* * *
Longridge and the Cascades -divided witli
the Settlement proper the infamous distinction of
sheltering, at this period, a greater number of
scoundrels “meriting hanging” (vide an official
report of the day) “ than were included in
all the prisons of the continent of Europe.”
Only by a process of the most systematic
selection could so complete and numerous a popu-
lation of criminal proficients have been formed.
Macquarie Harbour had owned the sway of
monarchs of outrage; Port Arthur might still
register on her muster-rolls scores of names which
served to distinguish “princes of the damned a
, Probation Gang here and there contained a spirit
which was, doubtless, permitted to remain incar-
nate only because Pluto feared its arrival in his
realms would ruin Tartarus, But, as a rule, the
wretches who thronged these institutions were
mere squires, mere commons in vice, compared
with the Baronage of Norfolk Island. The prison
population of the beautiful spot where Alcyone
might have nested was a very aristocracy of crime
—a perfectly-organised Order of the Gallows
Unto this end had Orders-in-Oounoil, Acts of
Parliament, Acts of Colonial Councils, and Kings’
and Queen’s Regulations contributed. Never
before had the world seen so awful a society;
never since has the world seen one like it. Never-
theless, the world may see one such again : When
the Acts of the Council of the Governor-General
of India relating to Port Blair, in the Andaman
Islands, reach their fruition. And the tree is
ripening. Undeterred by the dreadful results of
the Australian experiment, the Imperial authori-
ties are repeating it with respect to Indian con-
victs.
* # #
For Mrs. Browning’s trip to the outposts,
the doctor had obtained the use of the “ State
coach and horse.” For the animal alive, a White-
chapel knacker might have offered three shillings,
with the intention of forthwith poll-axeing it.
Dead, the knacker would want half-a-crown to
remove it. It was the most miserable and gauntest
of “screws.” Nevertheless, it served a distiuetlv
useful function in the economy of the British
Empire, as it was utilised to extract from the
British taxpayers’ pockets an annual allowance for
forage, by which the. horse didn’t benefit, while an
Official Somebody did. The carriage was in keep-
ing with the horse. It was a despicable and crazy
four-wheeler, superannuated, years previously,
from a Sydney vice-regal stable, but which had
been charged, superannuation and despicableness
notwithstanding, to the British taxpayers afore-
said, at the price of a new vehicle. The chief
purpose of the turn-out was to add eclat to the pro-
cession necessitated by the visits of the Special
Commission. This was a “ body’’—usually that
of a briefless barrister—which was annually sent
up from Hobart Town to try—and hang—capital
offenders.
In Hobart Town Mrs. Browning had been
accustomed to some degree of vehicular comfort
and elegance. Needless to say, therefore, she had
not enjoyed her drive from the Settlement to
Longridge, and it was with undisguised relief
that she alighted at the ledge overhanging the
Longridge quarry, preparatory to ascending to
the barracks on the crest of the hill by means of
the tramway used for the conveyance of stone
from the quarry to the site of some new buildings
at the Ridge.
Little Nellie, on the other hand, had greatly
delighted in her outing. Even the bumping and
shaking of the rattletrap vehicle and the eccen-
tricities of the spavined beast which drew it, gave
her entertainment. The symmetrical grandeur of
the pines, the feathery grace of the fern-fronds,
the frequent glimpses of a sapphire sea, the rhyth-
mic surge of the surf on the reefs, the screech of
parroquets—all had interested her. She was too
young yet to understand that upon the scenes that
charmed her with their native beauty man had
stamped an indelible impress of shame. The
clank of irons, the hoarse commands, the yellow-
and-black-garbed workers at the roadside who
raised their dull eyes for a moment as the carriage
passed them, were sights and sounds that she was
accustomed to. There was nothing novel in them
to attract her.
One glance at the quarry-gang, too, satisfied
her. She had seen such men working in the
Domain at Hobart Town and on the New Wharf.
But the island spice-plant, with its pungent frag-
rance, was new to her, and she must have a bunch
of it. So she ran down and pulled some from a
root growing in a crevice close to where a convict
was wielding a spall-hammer. The root was a
firm growth and resisted her effort to displace it.
The convict bent down and released it for her.
She smiled brightly and thanked him. Ho felt
the happier for rendering her the trifling service-
his load of remorse and vain regret was lightened
by her smile. He was an ex-Mayor of an English
city, transported for forgery. In his days of free-
dom and happiness he had dabbled amateurishly
in philosophical experiments. It must have been
some reminiscence of those old-time pursuits that
made him mutter: “The dynamics of a child’s
laughter have yet to be investigated.” The gang-
constable on duty did not catch the phrase, con-
cluded it was a remark made to the child, and re-
ported it accordingly. Next day the ex-Mayor was
ordered a week's “ cells,” with a ration of 12oz.
bread and a half-pint of water daily, for making a
philosophical observation. Gf course that was not
the offence as it appeared in the records. The
entry in the Punishment Book is to the effect that
the ex-Mayor was awarded “cells” for “asking
the child of a visitor to procure him tobacco. ”
* * *
While the little girl was playing about, gather-
ing spice-plant here and maiden-hair there, now
swinging herself at the bottom-most shoot of a
giant pine, and now stripping a sapling swamp-oak
of its blue-blossomed-creeper, her mother had
seated herself on rugs taken from the carriage, to
wait for the return of the team which was to haul
herself and escort to the Ridge, and the doctor
performed part of his duty. This consisted in a
formal inquiry or two from the gang-constables
and soldiers’ guard as to their health, and in as-
certaining how many prisoners were waiting his
inspection at the barracks. In reply to the latter
interrogatory, he was informed that there were
only a dozen “shamming Abraham.” It was a
cardinal point of faith with every constable that
no convict was ever really ill, and that every man
reporting himself sick was necessarily a malingerer.
More than one poor devil in the very throes of
death had been denounced as “shamming” by the
prison-officers who had charge of him, and there
is official evidence extant that one Norfolk Island
constable swore, at an inquiry into a prisoner’s
death, that “deceased ‘slipped his wind’ just to
spite him” —him, the deponent constable! The grim
humour of this functionary must have been ap-
preciated by the Civil Commandment, who con-
ducted the investigation, inasmuch as he accepted
the explanation as “sufficient.”
* * *
Malingerers or not, the men in the barracks who
had “asked to see the doctor,” and who had
consequently not been sent out to gang-work
pending his visit, were not inspected by
Dr. Grocott that day. Nor did Mrs. Browning
get her ride to the Ridge. She experienced, how-
ever, a “novel sensation,” and if it were not
exactly the one promised by the medical man—
well, the latter was only held in reserve,
“P’raps the lady would like to see us blast,
doctor?” said the overseer of the gang.
“Oh, indeed I should,” exclaimed Mrs. Brown-
ing. “ I suppose there’s no danger ?”
“ None whatever, madam,” replied the foreman.
“ We’ll put you in a safe place, you may be sure.”
With that, he put his whistle to his lips, and
blew the “ Prepare for blasting” signal.
The preparations were in greater part similar in
character to those which would have been put in
force in a quarry worked by free men. But as
the workers were “ bond-slaves,” and desperate
slaves at that, a few additional precautions were
necessary.
Following the general rule of convict manage-
ment, the men of the armed quarry-guard—mili-
tary and civil—were usually placed at some dis-
tance from the prisoners under control. By this
means, in the event of a concerted “ rush” —always
a likely contingency—the guards could bring their
weapons into use before the convicts could come
up to them. Were the guards in close proxirairy
to the prisoners, it would be a comparatively easy
matter for desperate fellows, acting in concert, to
disarm their watchers. When a blast was about
to be let Off, however, the disposition of the sol-
diery and constables had necessarily to be altered,
for it was impossible to allow them to remain in
extended order on ground over which might sweep
masses and fragments of rook. The convicts were
then ordered to pass round a projecting rock
abutting on the sea-beach, and forming one
side of a shallow cave-like indentation in the
overhanging sea-wall. The soldiers, number-
ing fourteen, with two non-commsssioned officers,
were then marched, shoulder to shoulder, into
the narrow opening between the quarry-bed
and the shelving shingle where the men stood. At
the word of command, they brought their shotted
muskets to the “present,” ready to pour out a
volley on the huddled “magpies” before them
at the faintest symptom of revolt. This was
a formality never neglected when a blast bad to be
fired : and as that was done at least twice daily, it
will be readily understood that the platooningwas
a proceeding which had within it something of
tragic possibility. A twitching of a soldier’s
nerves ; a too-keen suspiciousness of a “ rush ” on
the part of a timid constable; or, one of those
inspirations to deeds of devilry which may momen-
tarily afflict even a well-ordered mind—and a
bullet might speed on its way to a billet in a
“ magpie’s ” cropped skull or corrupted heart.
Behind the military guard were ranged on this
day the constables, and behind these again, and
immediately protected by the jutting angle of the
rock, s f ood Dr. Grocott, with Mrs. Brown-
ing and her daughter. The overseer saw that the
several groups were in position and went back to
hoist the red flag to warn the tramway team, and
to fire the fuse.
“ Look out to sea, Missie. Some stone is sure
to fall there. I have put in a double charge,” he
said when he returned to shelter.
Nellie turned to look, but at the moment the
blast exploded. A brief tumble was followed by a
terrific report, and by the shaking of the earth
beneath their feet. Startled by the loud and sud-
den noise and by the trembling of the rock, the
child cried out, and instinctively fell back against
one of the constables. The man turned at the
contact, and the movement jostled the soldier in
his front. It would have been marvellous, indeed,
bad what now happened failed to come to pass.
Widi finger on trigger, and with nerves at extreme
tension, a jostle of his arm had the natural result
of causing the explosion of the man’s musket.
Convict Martin’s breast, ten paces distant, had re-
ceived the charge.
This man was one of the most desperate of the
quarry-gang. It was, indeed, a rather singular
circumstance that he was in the gang at all. and
not in double-irons in the Settlement gaol, so
heinous was his record. He had, however, won,
a month before, the concession of out door em-
ployment at Longridge by protecting a warder
from the sudden outburst of rage of another con-
vict. Not that the act which procured him the
privilege indicated any softening of his nature.
Not a bit of it. His temporary alliance
with Law and Order was not attributable
to remorse, or good feeling towards the
warder, or ill-feeling against the convict who
had attacked the officer. His motive —as ho ex-
plained to his fellow-ruffians who otherwise might
have resented his interference on behalf of
authority —was due to the simple fact that he was
going to kill the officer himself at the first con-
venient opportunity ! But, of course, the Civil
Commandment did not learn this, and in the
blissfulness of his ignorance transferred Martin to
Longridge-quarry gang—where an accidental shot
had just given him his death-wound.
» # *
The roar of the blast, the hurtling through
the air of showers of stony fragments, and the
thud of heavier blocks as they fell to the surface,
drowned the report of the musket, and some
moments elapsed before either the doctor’s party
or the overseer understood what had happened.
The soldiers, stupefied by their comrade’s mis-
hap (which might so easily have been theirs)
lowered their muskets, and thus gave the convicts
an opportunity to overpower them. But the
prisoners let it pass. For they, to a man, had
their attention attracted by their gang-fellow,
and several of the parti-coloured figures were
already bending over him. All of them clearly
apprehended that the discharge of the weapon
had been purely accidental, but, nevertheless,
murmurs and cries significant of revenge soon
arose from the felon throng. In their blasphemous
phrasing, these exclamations echoed the impreca-
tions of the dying man. From his mouth blood
welled, but not more copiously than horrid oaths.
What would have been the upshot it is impos-
sible to conjecture. Perhaps an erncutc , which
would have wrested Norfolk Island from the pos-
session of the legal authorities and given it over,
for a few weeks at least, to the rule of the
prisoner. An outbreak with that intention had
been more than once planned by this very quarry-
gang, and the project was feasible. The gang had
but to overpower its guard- the odds were about
sixty or seventy to twenty—and then Longridge,
with its three hundred convicts, would be gained
ovei% With such a diabolical reinforcement, the
release of the two hundred and forty demons at the
Cascades would be as easy as “ cracking a nut ” or
fracturing a leg-iron. Than the latter, nothing
was easier to an experienced Islander—unless
it was the nut-cracking—by which the reader will
please understand the breaking of a warder’s
bead. And the united devilry of the Cascades
and the Ridge could subjugate the Settlement
without much difficulty.
The gang, lashed by the passion for revenge,
might have been stirred up to the desperate
attempt, had not the innocent cause of the catas-
trophe intervened to prevent further disaster.
Nellie, her first alarm over, perceived the group
around Martin. By one of those flashes of intuition
which sometimes enable a child to put to shame
the reasoning intelligence of an adult, she grasped
her responsibility for the whole incident, She
broke through the line of guards and rushed to the
wounded convict.
“Oh, poor man, poor man," she exclaimed
piteously, “it’s my fault. I pushed the soldier,
but I didn’t —I didn’t mean to—l am so sorry,
so—” Her own sobs interrupted her speech ; she
tried to restrain them, and failed; the fruitless
tears rolled down her cheeks.
Fruitless? Well, perhaps not! Perhaps the
dew of her great pity was more potent for good
over these desperate natures, each ear-marked by
Satan himself, than chaplains’ exhortations, and
judicial rebuke, and scar of fetters, and cut of
. “ cat,” and prod of bayonet.
The ruffians fell back and looked at each other
wonderingly. Could miracles take place in Hell ?
Evidently so, if a child of the accursed official brood
could weep over that commonest of things a
wounded “magpie.”
If there had been any thought of rushing the
guard it was forthwith abandoned.
“Don’ —cry, little —’un,” gasped Martin : “ yer
c’u’dn t—help it. Don’ —yer cry—l'm orl—orl—A
He could not finish the sentence. He had tried
to say “ all right.”
Dr. Grocott “ had pulled himself together,” as
he afterwards expressed it, and proceeded to
examine the dying wretch. Mrs. Browning, who
would have liked to go into hysterics had
she felt sure she would have received proper atten-
tion, called the girl to her side, Nellie apparently
did not hear her mother’s voice. Her heart, as
yet uncontaminated by the System, pulsed with
wild, inarticulate sympathy and self-smiting sor-
row. How could site, a simple child, understand
that were she to live for four score years and
employ each moment in active beneficence, she
would never do a kindlier act than when she
caused the fatal shot?
Martin, brought back to consciousness by the
pain of the doctor’s probing, tried to make the
girl see this.
In the feeblest of tones, and punctuating his
words with spurts of blood, he said :
“Look ’ere —missie, yer did—th’ kin’est thin’—
pos’ble—in joggin’—thet lobster’s* elbow an’
makin’ him flipf his gun
“ You mustn’t talk, man !” said Grocott.
“ Will—silence —save me, sir?” queried Martin.
“It might!” replied Grocott. But ho knew
better.
“Then I’ll—talk 1” said Martin. But he couldn’t
—a rush of blood stopped him.
•&'
“ Come away, Nell,” repeated Mrs.
Browning.
Nellie paid no heed, and the lady was compelled
to approach the group. A ery gingerly she walked,
you may be sure. Sixty scoundrels in front of
her, and behind her the rank of soldiers with
levelled muskets, for once more had the firelocks
been brought to the “ present. ’ But then sh<3
must get her child away from that dreadful con-
tact with the prisoner
“ Come away, Nell!” exclaimed the delicate lady
again.
For answer Nellie took up Martin’s head ten-
derly ah, so tenderly—and drew it on her lap,
and said :
“ He’s dying, mamma—and I killed him. I
will not leave him, mamma.”
This was not the first time the feeble, frivolous
character of the mother had given way before the
pure strength of her little daughter.
“Oh, but, dear, you’re soiling your pretty dress!”
was all Mrs. Browning could say. Huge drops of
the convict’s blood were indeed staining the white
skirt,
“Better —go—missie,” muttered Martin. Per-
haps the doomed wretch, through the death-film
of his eyes, saw his boyhood home once more, and
recalled that the severance of the ties, which had
once knitted him to that English cottage-circle,
had been preceded by disobedience to a parent.
As tenderly as she had lifted his head, Nellie
lowered it into the hands of a kneeling convict.
“Will —you —kiss—me, —Missie?” asked Mar-
tin. The sentence, long-drawn through agony,
was not completed before Nellie bent down and
kissed him on his reddened lips and pallid fore-
head.

They sent to the Settlement for Protestant
Chaplain Taylor. “Wherever practicable,” so
ran a regulation of the System, “ a prisoner sup-
posed to be in extremis is to be granted the spiri-
tual consolations of his persuasion.” It was
practicable on this occasion.
* ‘ I don’ want —no—comm’nion —parson, ” Martin
said, as Taylor prayed him to accept that Gracious
Memorial which was withheld from the convicted
when “under bond,” but was tendered to them
when they were about to pass into the Valley of
the Shadow.
The good man, pained, tried to alter the dying
felon’s resolve.
“ No,” persisted Martin. “ I’ve had—all—th’
saeermunt—l'want, sir!” he gasped.
“ I don’t understand you, my poor fellow. Let
me beseech you

a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
strengthening the Nerves'Brain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.

Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Ulcers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Paver and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Pits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
of the-Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost,
every form of Aches and Pains.
