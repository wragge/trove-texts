Thiebault’s Memoirs.
General Thffibault was one of the brilliant
soldiers who fought for France in the Napoleonic
era. Born in 1769 at Berlin, where his father
was French envoy, he came to Paris at 15; com-
manded a company of the National Guard at the
Revolution, saved his neck in the Terror, adopted
the profession of arms, and rose gradually under
Napoleon to the rank of general of division. He
fought the lazzaroni at Naples, was with Massena
at Genoa, received a severe wound at Austerlitz,
went with Junot to the Peninsula and fought long
against Wellington, then, returning to Germany,
was inactive under Davout when Leipsig came.
He ’verted to royalty at the Restoration and
back to Napoleon during the Hundred Days, but
did not fight ab Waterloo. Making peace with
the Bourbqns, he passed the rest of his life quietly
at Paris, and died in 1846.
Thi6baulb was a handsome, clever, courageous
fellow, with a line talent for war, who should
have been marshal. Bub he lacked tact, missed
opportunities of advancement through pride or
folly, and spoiled his career at the outset by
offending Berthier and Napoleon. His rank as
general was a grudging homage to achievements
which had earned him a much higher position.
As his life wore on, disappointment soured him,
and he shone less and less.
His memoirs are charming reading. The recent
English translation represents only a portion of
the French original, which seems to hold high
place among its famous kindred. Thiebault had
a good literary faculty ; he was acquainted with
many of the personages who in his day made his-
tory for France; and he mingles the personal
element with the historical as interestingly as all
his countrymen. Anecdotes and impressions,
estimates and pictures, give a lively gloss on the
standard conclusions as to the facts and people of
the epooh.
Thiebault gives some idea of the prodigious
effect produced upon the cultured youth of his
day by Rousseau’s “Nouvelle Heloi'se ”
I do not know under what circumstance or with what
idea I opened this dangerous work, but before I had read
more than the first pages I was in a delirium. In truth,
I did not read, I devoured. The days were not sufficient.
I employed my nights in reading ; and passing from one
emotion, one catastrophe, to another, I arrived at St.
Preux’s last letter, no longer weeping, but shrieking and
howling like a wild animal. I still remember it. Ic was
three o’olock in the morning when, in the middle of one
of these fits, I came to myself. I was terrified at the con-
dition I was in ; I threw away the book, I put out my
candle and tried to go to sleep, but could not. I was in
a violent fever, and when day came I tried to piok myself
up by going to breathe the morning air in the Champs
Elys6es. It was a week before I ventured to go on with
the last volume of the story, and I could finish it only by
reading half a page or a quarter of a page at a time.
Thus I was more than another week getting to the end
of that letter, and in spite of these scrappy readings,
often interrupted in the middle of a sentence, I got ill
and nearly went out of my mind. The impression which
the novel left on me is more than I could say ; from that
day I have never ventured to try another reading of it,
nor should I venture even now, though many years of
trials have weakened or destroyed, if not my power of
feeling, at least my imagination.
There is a picture of that remarkable person-
ality, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, in the last
days of the Monarchy:—
La Boessifere’s fencing-school was the meeting-place of
the best fencers in France—Fabien, Lebrun, Leprince,
Lamotte, and several others, who formed the escort, one
might almost say the court, of the Chevalier de Saint-
Georges, a very king of arms, and the first man in the
world at anything requiring activity, strength or skill.
The effect which he produced on me, who yielded to no
one in the way of admiration and enthusiasm, may be
Imagined. In truth, I saw him do most extraordinary
things: he would put his baoa against the edge of a door,
seize the top with both hands, double himself upwards,
passing his feet, legs, and loins over his head until he sat
astride the door. Similarly I have seen him jump up and
seize a beam in the ceiling between his fiat hands, remain
hanging, and touoh the beam with his two feet. Though
a big man, and already portly, he was still a perfect
dancer, a wonderful rider, and a first-class skater. He
played the violin like an artist, and composed concertos
which were long performed by amateurs. But all his
talents, however great, seemed to disappear before the
incalculable advantage which he always had with the foil
over the strongest fencers in the world. All were
ambitious to fence with him, not with any idea of dis-
puting his supremacy, but simply for the sake of saying,
“I have fenced or am fencing with Saint-Georges.” A
simple fact will give an idea of the inconceivable rapidity
and accuracy of his movements. I have seen him more
than once win a bet, from the masters whom I have
named, that he would engage their sword in tieroe, dis-
engage, tap the ground with the point of his foil, touch
them with a chalked button, and meet their sword again
in carte before they could make a movement to parry.
That was to make at least three movements before these
strong and clever fencers could make one.
Here is the evidence of Louis Sixteenth’s bruta-
lity which shocked London Spectator, a loyal
animal-loving paper which refuses to believe that
a king can do wrong to a dog. Thi4bault’s
story, however, is naturally told, and is probably
Srue enough.
As we drew near the terraoe on the river-side, the king
oame out of the small gate near the Pavilion of Flora
accompanied only by two gentlemen. Just then a lady
came through the gate. She had a pretty little spaniel
with her, which, before she noticed it, ran close up to the
king. Making a low courtesy, she called the dog hack in
haste ; but, as the animal turned to run to its mistress
the king, who had a large cane in his hand, broke its
back with a blow of his cudgel. Then, amid the screams
and tears of the lady, and as the poor little beast was
breathing its last, the king, delighted with his exploit,
continued his walk, slouching rather more than usual
and laughing like any lout of a peasant.
Thiebault, by no means an adulator of Bona-
parte, gives many instances of his irresistible
energy, his genius for war, his wonderful power
over the soldiery. And he lays stress on his good
fortune, particularly at the outset—
Jt was undoubtedly a great piece of luck for Bonaparte
that his first oommand was with the Army of Italy and not
with that of the Rhine. As yet he had little or no know-
ledge of taotics, he could not even have handled a regi-
ment, and war in Germany was essentially a matter of
tactics and prompt manoeuvring under fire. In the
mountainous country of Lombardy and Piedmont, on the
other hand, where the main object was to mass superior
forces on one part of the enemy’s lines, to cut his com-
munications, to attack his rear, able strategy was wanted •
individual courage and intelligence went for a great deal,’
and the valor of the humblest soldier might be an impor-
tant aid to the ability of his chiefs. This, rather than the
other, was the kind of warfare suited to the age and the
nature of the new commander-in-chief, and at the outset
his genius was favored by opportunity.
Attention, indeed, is rarely directed to the ticklish
episodes in Bonaparte’s early career. When he
drove out the Council of the Five Hundred it was
touch-and-go with the First Consul. But for
brother Lucien, as President, and Lucien’s address
to the wavering soldiers, the event might easily
have been otherwise; and, given a Danton or a
Mirabeau among the Councillors, Bonaparte could
have been executed for treason at the beginning of
his ambition. Or, later, had he failed at Marengo
—as he was so near failing—it might well have
been all over with his prospects. Between Massena
and Desaix, he was saved for St. Helena.
Thi4bault didn’t like Berthier, Napoleon’s
right-hand man, and says he was “never anything
more than a good man to convey orders.” Duhesme
pleased him better, though not on first acquaint-
ance. There is a story of Duhesme in the Italian
campaign of 1799 :
General Duhesme took up the conversation with Girard
as follows: “ Who commands at Precara?” “There are
two commanders.” “ What is the rank of the one in
superior authority?" “Brigadier.” “His name?”
“Marquis of Pietramaggiore.” “How old is he?”
“Nearly seventy.” “Stout? High coloured?” “No;
thin and pale.” “Sonorous voice?” “No; weak, and
he isdeaf.” “How does he wear his hair?” “In little
curls, with a great deal of powder.” “ Has he boots and
spurs?” “No; silk stockings and shoes with large
buckles” “Large buckles!” cried General Duhesme;
“advance the artillery and commenoe firing. The plaoe
is mine.”
It would be easy to quote similar good things ad
infinitum ; but with an extract introducing Thie-
bault himself leave must be taken of his most
readable volumes:—
The amount of thrashing I did in the Austrian cam-
paign of 1305 is incredible, and it must be admitted that
I did not go at it with a slack hand, for I broke two canes.
The incident that cost me the second is one that depicts
our French soldier admirably, and in a sense does him
honor. I had let my brigade go forward, I think, while I
stopped to breakfast; several other corps had passed me,
and I was trotting on to rejoin it, when I heard fearful
shrieks coming from a solitary house a few vards to the
left of the road. _ I dismounted at once and ran to the
house. I found it full of soldiers, rummaging in all the
cupboards, even in the drawers, to see, as one of th6m
had the impudence to say, that there were no Austrians
hidden there ; others had got very tight hold of the wife
and daughter of the house. Using my cane freely, I made
them bolt out of door and window. . . . On resuming my
road Isaw that it made alongcircuit round a hillock, on the
other side of which was some level ground, which seemed
to offer a short cut. I urged my horse that way, but he had
gone only a few steps when his hoofs sunk in ;
he tried to back, I spurred him ; then he leapt forward,
and gave a great many bounds as though paddling
through water ; at last he was right in the mud, and, as
it were, floating on his stomach. I was in one of those
abominable swamps, frequent enough in Germany, which
there is nothing on the surface to show, while they often
cover a wide space, and in some cases are bottomless. I
soon saw that I could look for no support save from my
horse ; but he sank imperceptibly, and the least effort
that he made to get out involved him further. Riche-
bourg and my orderly were in despair, not knowing how
to help me, and we were getting very uneasy when the
same soldiers whom I had just been whacking and who
had sworn to kill me, but who at bottom knew quite well
that I had done my duty, and in this case, at all events,
made no mistake as to theirs, having reached the point
where the road looked down from the hill, saw
the danger I was in. With a spontaneous move-
ment they sorambled down the steep side, threw
down their knapsacks and arms, ran to the wooden fence
round the house from which I had just driven them,
broke it up and returned each with his load of planks to
the edge of the quagmire. Making a floating floor on
this, they suoeeeded in reaching and saving me; and not
oontent with their first exploit, they pushed their planks
ail round my horse, and then, by the help of cords, lever
and girths, they lifted him and dragged him by his head
and tail out of the horrible mud, and brought him back
to me. “ Come,” I said, patting one of them on the
shoulder, “ there is a bit of devil about you sometimes,
but you are good fellows all the same. Here,” I added,
pulling out two napoleons, “take this to drink the
Emperor’s health with.” “We have drunk that quite
often enough,” said one of them, and they went off laugh-
ing, but nothing would they take.
The translation, by A. J. Butler (translator of
Marbot’s Memoirs), seems to be very capably
done.
Contributors’ Commentary.
One of the Rear-Guard : “ Lawson’s verses
on “The Men Who Come Behind ” seem to me to
arrogate leadership, to assume a sort of don’t-get-
m-my-way-or-I’ll kick-you-out-of-it air that ‘ rubs
every hair on my back the wrong way.’ The
poet denounces competition and imitation. But
everybody imitates, everybody competes. Law-
son didn't start the first oyster-shop. Even if he
started the first in his little district he competed
with the butcher. The man who does not imitate
does nothing and is an embodiment of human
stagnation, and he who does not compete is a
nerveless slouch. Nowadays the non-competitor
is chiefly lying in the Domain, where perhaps
Mr. Dawson visits him and encourages him in the
pursuit of his calling, viz., Not ‘starting oyster-
saloons where be might get a little of the trade.’
What is the difference between ‘Faces in the
street , and that old song called ‘London
Bridge ? Give the palm to which you will, they
have precisely the same idea, and I am certain
that neither H. Lawson nor the other man in-
vented it. It came aeons upon aeons back, out of
the brain of the first man who felt sorry for
some other man who wasn’t as well off as he was.”
Maxillus : “A part of Olive Schreiner’s
parable on the pursuit of truth (in the impressive
‘The Hunter ’) seems merely an amplification of
Pope’s lines :
So pleased at first the towering Alps we try,
Mount o’er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,
Th’ eternal snows appear already past,
And the first clouds and mountains seem the last:
But, those attained, we tremble to survey
The growing labors of the lengthened way,
The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes,
Hills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise.
H.F. : “Be your formula for creating
genius: ‘You want from one parent a good-
quality blood with plenty of red corpuscles;
from the other a good-quality brain and a touch
of nervous disease.’ Are you not attempting the
difficult feat of seeking a simple answer for a
complex problem ; a formula that may be true in
some instances, but, unless you narrow down the
definition of genius to arbitrary limits, not true in
all. There are authorities who have traced genius
to a fortunate blend in parentage—the happy
mixing of Saxon, Celtic, Norman or Gallic blood,
and have raked up the ancestry of great minds
in corroboration. These gentlemen would pro-
duce you a poet, painter, or whatnot, as Derby
winners are bred at Hobartville, by the study of
pedigree. The writer has another theory to add.
It is, that the exceptional product known as
genius is often the result of favoring influences
received by the mother and impressed
through her on the embryo, and further,
that in embryology we shall find one of the miss-
ing links of evolution; which rests ab present on
' chance ’ variation producing the fittest. Bub
‘ chance ’ is not scientific ; there must be law, even
for variation. Your date, a.h. 250,000, for a sen-
sational development of human brains, appears
premature and likely to raise up vain hopes, Two
thousand years ago the Greeks showed an all-
round brain-power in arts, philosophy, and
imagination which, in mere power, we have nob
yet passed. The Book of Job, dating back, say,
4000 years, shows the highest intellect (conditions
considered), and the ancient writing of other lands
would seem to bear out the contention that
—historically—we have no evidence that in 6000
years the quality of the human brain has percept-
ibly improved. Types as low as the cave-dwellers
are found on the earth to-day, and some unre-
corded Homer may have chanted the slaughter of
mastodons. Nor do the' races of mankind of
whom we have any knowledge help the theory of
brain evolution. The Hebrews, Chinese, and
Arabs appear to have preserved their mental
qualities and limitations unvaried through the
ages.” [Man has been on this planet, say, 200,000
years. He discovered iron and alphabets, com-
paratively speaking, only the other day. Now he
is commencing to forge ahead. His own records
cover too small a space to permit deductions, but
the records of the rocks are conclusive as to his
skull-development in, say, 50,000 years. By
anno hominis 250,000 he wifi assuredly have
developed much further.]
W.E.S. : “Be genius and disease, and the
comment to ‘C.’ (17/10/96) to effect that the peou-
liar intensity of genius on any line is due to
hypertrophy of some part of the brain con-
cerned. When sheep first get fluke, they
increase in weight immensely, owing to the
greater activity of the liver in trying to ejeot
the fluke—which creates more blood, and induces
a far livelier habit in the sheep. Then comes the
reaction on the other organs, and final break-
down. Doesn’t the analogy hold ? ” It does, and
there is a still more familiar domestic illustra-
tion. Any mother of any child : “Jimmy’s too
lively : he musb be getting a cold.” And why
lively ? Because Jimmy’s heart is pulsing away
at its hardest, endeavoring to revivify the morbid
cells in the lungs or air-passages, and his brain is
temporarily congested with blood —as genius’s all
the time.

The Portrait.
The man who told this tale is not
Hither you- , or I, dear friend ;
Who may therefore, glad of our better lot,
Hear his story told to the end.
Midnight past! Not a sound of aught
Thro’ the silent house, but the wind at his prayers.
I sat by the dying fire, and thought
Of the dear dead woman upstairs.
A night of tears ! for the gusty rain
Had ceased, but the eaves dripping yet;
And the moon look’d forth as tho' in pain,
With her face all white and wet:
Nobody with me, my watch to keep,
But the friend of my bosom, the man I love ;
And grief had sent him fast to sleep
In the chamber up above.
Nobody else, in the country place
All round, that knew of my loss beside,
But the good young Priest with the Raphael-faoe
Who confess’d her when she died.
That good young Priest is of gentle nerve,
And my grief had moved him beyond controul;
For his lip grew white, as I could observe,
When he speeded her parting soul.
I sat by the dreamy hearth alone:
I thought of the pleasant days of yore:
I said—“ The staff of my life is gone:
The woman I love is no more.
“ Gem-ciasp’d, on her bosom my portrait lies,
Which next to her heart she used to wear—
It is steep’d in the light of her loving eyes,
And the sweets of her bosom and hair."
And I said—“ The thing is precious to me:
They will bury her soon in the ohurchyard clay;
It lies on her heart, and lost must be,
If I do not take it away.”
I lighted ray lamp at the dying flame,
And crept up the stairs that creak’d for fright,
Till into the chamber of death I oame,
Whore she lay all in white.
The moon shone over her winding-sheet
There, stark she lay on her oarven bed;
Seven burning tapers about her feet,
And seven about her head.
As I stretch'd my hand, I held my breath ;
I turned as I drew the curtains apart:
I dared not look on the face of death:
I knew where to find her heart.
I thought, at first, as my touch fell there,
It had warmed that heart to life, with love j
For the thing I touch’d was warm, I swear,
And I could feel it move.
’Twas the hand of a man, that was moving slow
O’er the heart of the dead,—from the other side 1
And at once the sweat broke over my brow—
“ Who is robbing the corpse?” I cried.
Opposite me, by the tapers’ light,
The friend of my bosom, the man I loved,
Stood by the corpse, and all as white,
And neither of us moved,
“ What do you here, my friend ? ” . . . The mao
Looked first at me, and then at the dead.
“ There is a portrait here . . . "he began ;
“ There is. It is mine,” I said.
Said the friend of my bosom, “Yours, no doubt,
The portrait was, till a month ago,
When this suffering angel took that out
And placed mine there, I know.”
“This woman she loved me well,” said I.
“ A month ago,” said my friend to me:
‘ And in your throat,” I groan'd, “ you He i **
He answer’d . . , “ Let us see."
“ Enough 1 ” I return’d, “ let the dead deoidei
And whose soever the portrait prove,
His shall it be, when the cause is tried,
Where Death is arraign’d by Love."
We found the portrait, there in its places
We open’d it by the tapers’ shine:
The gems were all unchanged: the face
Was—neither his nor mine.
“ One nail drives out another, at least!
The portrait is not ours,” I cried,
“ But our friSnd’s, the Raphael-faced young Priest,
Who confess’d her when she died,”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON
CHITJS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronohitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Suffering from NERVOUSNESS' and EXHAUSTION
should try Dr. SPEER'S celebrated Remedies,
which strike at the root of the disease. The
symptoms gradually disappear, nervousness and timidity
vanish, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
ALL CONSULTATIONS FREE.
Persons residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of
treatment will not in any way interfere with their
business.
Every person applying to the Doctor will receive a
straightforward and candid opinion of the case, and the
possibility of a cure. If the patient is curable, he will tell
him so ; if not, he will also tell him. He undertakes no
case which he cannot cure.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS, of
Sept. 28, 1895, says :
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion, of all
others, 1 should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.” t -

Did you ever read about OLD SCROOGE and
the XMAS CAROL?
What was OLD SCROOGE like before he saw
MARLEY’S GHOST? A miserable wretch,
begrudging a starving cur a lick out of the gutter,
the children their Xmas feast, and all mankind its
Xmas enjoyment.
What would you be like if you didn’t see
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
XMAS SHOW.
Not so bad as OLD SCROOGE, surely, for he
was a bad case indeed. But you would not, nay,
could not, be happy. Your heart would yearn
for something, and you wouldn’t know what. You
would be low-spirited, snappish, and bilious. There
would be no brightness in your eye, no elasticity
in your step, your weary feet would be heavy as
lead, your flesh would fall away, and instead of
the sleek, WELL-GROOMED CITIZEN, a lean,
woebegone, CADAVEROUS PANTALOON
would OCCUPY YOUR, PANTS and wear your
skin. Friend, don’t risk it, make a point of seeing

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOTHER BED AND MR. SLEEP.
In the hours of evening—sleepy hours
When a glamor, resting on the flowers,
Dreams from out the twilight to the dusk —*
Dreams and dies—
The playing children’s poppy-tinted faces,
Full of weariness, of gambols, and of races,
Turn-unto the ever-welcome shaded places
For tired eyes.
No more tiring with the lessons, nor with playing,
The moon sends just one argent beam a-raying—
A sleepful beam that never tires staying
On a baby’s head ;
And weary worn by days of careful scheming,
I stood outside the track of the moon’s gleaming,
And heard the children praying, half a-dreaming—
A-praying from the bed—
“ Oh, Mother Bed ”
The children said
In the light of the argent beams),
“ Show us the house of Mr. Sleep,
Who lives in the Town of Dreams ! ”
And Mother Bed told the way so lowly
That none could hear but the young and holy—
For the man of cares they always keep
From the Town of Dreams and the Street of Sleep.
In the hours of evening—waking hours —
Wakeful devils lurk among the flowers,
Active thoughts that swing and sway like fiends
Make light my eyes !
Active thoughts within my brain are swinging,
The curse of commerce unto me is clinging,
New schemes spring off from old, and still are
springing,
And not one dies !
The loud, loud clock-ticks hammer through the
curtain,
Nothing is dim, nor blessedly uncertain—
The world is plain—
Clearly the eye takes toll of glass and casement,
No shock—no calm—no fear—and no amazement;
No joy—no grief—no pride—and no abasement !
Only the accurate arithmetic working
Of the tense brain,
And so worn out with ravelled night and day
I long for that good time when I shall say—
“ Oh, Mother Bed !
When I am dead
And safe from my plans and schemes;
Show me the house of Mr. Sleep
In the Town of the Children’s Dreams ! ”
And Mother Bed shall whisper lowly,
Of the track so clean, of the road so holy,
And I shall go and drink long and deep
In the Town of Dreams—at the house of Sleep !
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
WHEN THE COLD WINDS BLOW.
“ I tell you it’s true,” said the city tramp,
At the bitter birth of a wintry day,
As hunger and thirst and ague and cramp
Drove him abroad on the street to pray
To the passers-by who might chance his way.
“It’s here in the town that the wi. d< play queer ;
Out on the plains they are straight and fair;
They blast you in front or sc mr you in rear,
But a man can make re; dy to face them thei e
For he knows where he are, though ever so bare.
“ But here in the city they crawl and sneak
By gable and gate, till a victim nears,
And before he can tuck in his head or speak
They’re down on the back of his neck or ears, /
Or are pinching his eyelids into tears.
“ I’ve stood on the blacksoil plain and said
‘ Come on ! ’ and marched in their teeth all day,
And the heat of my body was fanned and fed,
As the racing blood through my veins made way,
By the vigorous, open, straightforward fray.
“ But here in the city you never can say :
One minute it’s coijy as on you go,
And next through some-.ehink or right-of-way
Sneaks the sinister breath of the South Pole
snow ;
Oh, gimme the plains when the cold winds
blow ! ”

Down at Warrnambool (Vic.) there is a
chance of -£2O reward for anybody who cares to
excavate an alleged Portuguese galleon, which is
said to have been last seen burying itself in the
sandy sea-shore about 50 years ago. The mythical
vessel is believed to have been wrecked half-a-
century previous to its final disappearance, and
according to aboriginal tradition the crew were
“yellow skinned.” Under these circumstances,
Warrnambool feels convinced that they were
pirates conveying great masses of treasure from a
distant land, and the oldest local inhabitant has a
dim suspicion that the ghost of a desperado with
two unwieldy pistols in his belt will be found
jjacing the main deck when the missing galleon
comes to light.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Pri.C6 HitllGrtO TJll-
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d. !!— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done
''A': i'
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note-— Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to, any
address on receipt of 10s. while this advertisement appears. -

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
The Kanakaland Stumbling-block.
The failure of Premier Reid’s “ mission ”
to Queensland on the Federation question is
not a matter of much surprise to anybody—
save, possibly, to Premier Reid himself. It
was a small, cheap, common, ordinary
failure with no noticeable features about it,
and it was the natural result of a half-hearted
apostle preaching the gospel he only half-
believed in to a blankly indifferent assem-
blage which was too little interested either to
believe at all or to disbelieve at all. A whole
combination of circumstances led up to this
mission and its failure. The present Govern-
ment in Brisbane is undoubtedly opposed to
Federation, but in the passive, inert fashion
of one who yawns and says that it really
doesn’t matter. Premier Nelson introduced
the Enabling Bill, remarking, in almost so
many words, that it was a small affair which
made him feel tired, and that he didn’t care
what became of it. He roused, in a small
way, the hostility of the masses and of the
Labor members by refusing to entrust the
people with the right to elect the Convention
delegates, and, having arrogated the right to
Parliament, he carefully created a quarrel
with the Council by refusing that half of
Parliament any share in the election. He
aggravated the quarrel thus created by re-
fusing to entertain any scheme of com-
promise, and when the Enabling Bill was
lost, as it was obviously intended to be, the
Government merely yawned among the
ruins and said again that it didn’t matter.
* * * *
There was no necessity after this for any
“ mission,” or any fatted ambassador, or any
fuss whatever. The other five provinces of
Australia and Tasmania were all in line,
having been got there with much difficulty.
They represented four-fifths of the area and
six-sevenths of the population, which was a
sufficiently good basis to start with. No
reasonable person ever counted with any
certainty on starting the Federation with all
the provinces at once. The Canadian and
United States Federations began with a very
few provinces, and grewincour.se of years. The
Swiss Confederation began in a still smaller
way and took centuries to reach its present
dimensions. If a Federation of five pro-
vinces could be started, with a uniform tariff,
railway system, military, postal, telegraph
and other departments, a consolidated debt,
a Federal judiciary, and with no internal
customs barriers, the advantages of the
system would be so great that the adhesion
of Queensland later on is a matter of abso-
lute certainty. To get five provinces in line
at once was so much more than could reason-
ably have been expected that it was a sheer
tempting of Providence to waste time wait-
ing for the one that stood out, with a fair
chance that two or three of the others might
grow cool and fall away in the interim. But
Premier Reid, the lukewarm Federationist
whose mission it is to create imaginary
obstacles and then show his zeal by laboring
ponderously to overcome them, stood in the
way of this very simple and rational view of
the case.
* * * *
Premier Reid, first of all, created the idea
that the adhesion of Queensland was essen-
tial, which it certainly was not. Then he
showed his useless enthusiasm by going on a
mission to overcome the obstacle he had
created, and practically guaranteed the failure
of his mission by professing to speak in the
name of the five provinces without obtaining
any form of authority from any of them.
And, when his mission met with the antici-
pated failure, he commenced to throw cold
water on the movement by vague statements
to the effect that it was necessary to seriously
consider the position before anything further
could be done. This was the first definite
suggestion that the defection of Queensland
should be assigned as a reason for dropping
the whole movement, whereas in reality it
was the best of all reasons for urging it on
with increased energy. The Queensland
Government, in the days of the ’9l Conven-
tion, was seemingly in earnest (the fact that
its earnestness was probably owing in the
main to the private ambitions of Samuel
Griffith makes no difference), but five years
delay gave it, or its Griffith, time to grow
indifferent. The suggestion that this state of
things should be remedied by giving the other
provinces more time to fall away also is the
most inverted Federalism on record. Finally
the Reid Government decided to fix the
Federal Convention for next April, which is
a moderately remote date with no unseemly
haste about it.
* * * *
The various informal suggestions put for-
ward as to the terms on which Queensland
might be willing to come in are so grotesque
that the hopelessness of waiting for the
Kanaka province, in its present frame of
mind, is obvious. One informal demand was
that some arrangement (of what kind does
not appear) should be made to prevent the
trade of Brisbane being drawn away to other
ports. As one great object of Federation is
to destroy internal barriers, and let trade go
to the most convenient port, and as Sydney,
Melbourne, Newcastle, Adelaide, and Perth
all agree to take their chance, and as Bris-
bane will be at full liberty to annex their
trade if it can be got, this one-sided demand
was hopeless and impossible. Another plaint
was that, if the Customs were taken over by
the Federal Treasury, Queensland, which
has a Customs revenue of £2 16s. per head
against £1 Bs. per head in N.S.W. and £1
9s. in Victoria, would be giving more than
her fair share, and therefore that each pro-
vince should maintain its separate tariff and
retain its Customs revenue for its own pro-
vincial purposes. There was really nothing
in the complaint, for Queensland collects a
large Customs revenue merely by levying
heavy revenue duties on herself, and if her
tariff was made uniform with that of the
other provinces her contributions would
gradually decline to about their level ; but
the proposal was a fine instance of grotesque
selfishness. The Northern province is
quite willing to put into the common stock
the biggest debt per head in Australia, and
to federate her interest bill of £2 16s. per
head per annum, the largest in Australia,
with Victoria’s bill of £1 14s. per head, also
to throw in the worst-paying railways (except
Tasmania’s only)and aboutthe most expensive
post and telegraph system, but while hand-
ing over all these debit items she seriously
demanded that her Customs revenue—the
only counterbalancing item in the list—
should not go with them. Also it was
seriously proposed up North that there
should be special conditions made for Queens-
land’s special benefit in the matter of colored
labor. Then a fui’ther proposal was to the
effect that instead of creating an “ artificial ”
constitution Australia should preserve the
existing Federal Council and let it gradu-
ally develop into a complete Federation.
This last idea is just as hopeless as
waiting till a cow grows into a prize
ram or a camel. Things that are dis-
similar by nature can’t develop into each
other. The Federal Council has no autho-
rity, no representative basis, no finances, no
credit, no executive or legislative powers, and
it can’t grow any of these things ; they must
be given to it by provincial enactments, and
to give them would be going back to artificial
constitution-making once more. Moreover,
the Federal Council is withering, not grow-
ing.
* .* * *
The inflated value which Premier Reid
insisted on attaching to Queensland as a
member of the proposed league, has pro-
bably done something to fill that province
with an erroneous belief in its power to make
conditions. Yet Federation can go on per-
fectly well without the assistance of the
Kanaka province, because circumstances
would make its adhesion later on a matter
of almost absolute certainty. A combination
of the other five provinces, as already men-
tioned,. would include four-fifths of the area
and six-sevenths of the population of Aus-
tralia and Tasmania. By leaving Queensland
out the Federal debt would be about £4B
per head, whereas by taking in the Northern
province it would be something like £5O 10s.;
also the interest bill would be reduced by
the defection of Queensland by about 2s. per
head per annum. The Federal railway
revenue would be improved by leaving
out the Queensland system, which is much
less profitable than the average of the other
provinces, and in all these respects the
Federation would be a direct gainer
and Queensland a direct loser. In-
directly, however, the Kanaka country
would lose much more, and in many
ways. First of all it would lose its chance,
whatever that may amount to, of having the
c ipital located in its territory. Its vote in
the Commonwealth Parliament might turn
the scale and locate the Federal city either
within its borders, or so near them as to bring
much wealth and population to Queensland,
and by maintaining its policy of isolation
this chance is necessarily lost. It would not
only lose the opportunity to pass part of its
debt and interest burden on its neighbors,
but would also lose the advantages to be
gained by a consolidation of the public debt
at a reduced rate. Its future loans would
have to carry a higher rate of interest than
those guaranteed by the superior credit of
the Commonwealth, which means an addi-
tional loss. It would miss the further saving
to be effected by a consolidation of the mili-
tary, railway, postal and other departments
—a small item, possibly, but still one that
helps to make up a large and solid considera-
tion.
* * * *
Further, the Commonwealth tariff would
seriously injure its commerce. Its exports
would only have a look-in, so far as the rest
of Australia was concerned, when the other
five provinces were unable to supply each
other, and if. the southern beet industry
ever readies the dimensions expected of it
the surplus of Queensland’s nigger-grown
product will be in much want of a market.
If there was a Federation of all Australia,
and border tariffs and differential railway
rates were abolished, the South Queensland
railways would be in a position to draw some
of the trade of Northern N.S.W. to Bris-
bane, which trade the isolated province
will probably lose. Again, the Federal
Government, when it comes to consolidate
and unite the scattered railway systems of
Australia, must some day face the problem
of building a transcontinental line to open
up Australia from north to south. If Queens-
land joins the Commonwealth that line may
go through her territory, to her great ad-
vantage, and connect her three long
straggling railways, and make the first great
northern port on the shores of the Gulf. If
Queensland stands out, then the only pos-
sible transcontinental line is across South
Australia, and the outlet will be at Port
Darwin. Reckoning in the assured losses
and the ones that are only possible—the
direct losses which Queensland will sustain
now by staying out, and the future ones
which will keep impelling her to come in—
considering how well the other provinces can
do without Queensland and how ill Queens-
land can do without the other provinces,
provided only that they are united, the
future adhesion of the isolated North may
be regarded as an absolute certainty. There-
fore, Queensland’s present defection is
rather a reason why Federation should be
pushed on than a cause for further delay.
Judicially Exonerated.
Some months ago, in the N.S.W. Leg. Assem-
bly, Varney Parkes charged N.S. VV. Public
Works Department with having such friendly
relations with a chameleonic firm of contractors
—mostly known as Carter, Gummow & Co.—
that the interests of the country suffered badly,
while the interests of certain individuals em-
ployed in the Dept, did not suffer badly.
District Court Judge Murray was appointed a
Commissioner to investigate the matter, and he
has reported wholly in favor of the Works
Dept. Nevertheless, although it doubtless had
every confidence in Judge Murray, it must
have been an anxious time for the Works
Dept. It seemed to be the general opinion of
contractors that Carter, Gummow’s connection
with the Dept, had been exceptionally for-
tunate; and Carter, Gummow had given em-
ployment to the son of the Dept.’s engineer-in-
chief, who generally superintended their
contracts; while Mr. Carter had borrowed
£2OOO at 6 per cent, from one of the Dept.’s
engineers, who had occasionally superintended
one or other of their contracts; had lent
£250 without interest to another of the
Dept.’s engineers, who had also occasionally
superintended one or other of their contracts ;
and had lent £6OO without interest to a third
of the Dept.’s engineers, who had also occasion-
ally superintended one or other of their con-
tracts. It must be very satisfactory to these
officers that Judge Murray finds that, “Mr.
Hickson and the other responsible officers of
the Works Dept, stand exonerated from all
suspicion of improper conduct in the matter ”of
enquiry. Then there was the matter of the
bluestone pitchers. Bluestoue pitchers are
handy little stones used as a border for man-
holes in the street sewers, and 255. per cubic
yard is a good price for them. The Works
Dept, wanted about 38yds., but by a little
mistake it only set down 12yds. as wanted.
Carter, Gummow and Co. tendered at
,£5O per yard, and the Dept, accepted the
tender and allowed them to execute the work
and charge some £l3OO more than its value.
One of the officials of the Dept., an objection-
able person named Bagge, seems to have
pointed out that according to clause 16 of the
contract-specifications the Dept! had “full
power” to “order material or work of a dif-
ferent description to that specified ... or
to substitute one class of work for another ; ”
and under clause 17 it had power “ to direct
the omission of the carrying out of any part of
the said works; ” but the Dept, generously
decided to bust the specifications, and the
objectionable person named Bagge was sat
upon with great despatch.
* * * *
It was also suggested that the Dept, might
stop short at the 12yds. which it specified as
wanted, but no ! the Dept, resolved to go the
whole animal, and another 25yds. or so of blue-
stone pitchers worth 255. a yard were duly
supplied and charged and paid for at £5O a
yard. This little transaction might seem at
first blush not wholly creditable to the Works
Dept., but Judge Murray puts it in its true
light:—
The excavation quantities stood in the final voucher as
Nature had arranged them; it was no action, no mani-
pulation, of the department, but it was Mr. Snodgrass’s
perception that resulted in the coincidence of that
arrangement with the contractors’ interest.
The Bulletin hereby passes a stern vote of
censure on “ Nature” for buying blue-metal at
£5O a yard. Then there was the matter of
Bond and Hudson’s contract. Bond and
Hudson tendered successfully for a contract
which Carter and Co. were very anxious to
get. Bond and Hudson’s tender price was
£36,900 ; Carter and Co’s was £2990 higher.
Bond and Hudson’s tender, however, was not
accepted, because the Works Dept. “ found
that it had not enough funds to go on
with the work.” Still, their tender was
recommended for acceptance, and it was
recognised that they had first claim on
the Dept, when the work should be car-
ried out. Mr. Hudson came continually to
know when the Dept, intended proceeding with
the work, and was told it was not likely to
be going on with it for two years. Then Mr.
Carter offered Bond and Hudson £750 cash
to withdraw their tender, and £750 more if his
firm got the contract. Bond and Hudson ac-
cepted; and three months afterwards the Works
Dept, proceeded with the work, and, without
calling for fresh tenders, gave Carter and Co.
the contract at a price £2900 above Bond and
Hudson’s figures. Varney Parkes suggested
that this looked as if the Works Dept, was
privy to the little transaction between Carter
and Bond and Hudson—with a bias in favor of
Carter. But Judge Murray’s luminous de-
cision goes to the root of the matter. He says :
If what honestly appeared to be the best course to adopt
under the circumstances was taken, then no blame
attaches to any officer of the Department.
* * * *
Precisely. If what honestly appeared to be
the best course to adopt under the circumstances
was taken by Butler, then Captain Lee
Weller has only himself to thank for being
revolvered and jammed into a tight-fitting
grave at Glenbrook. Then there were other
matters—the matter of the partners in the
Carter firm whom the Works Dept, accepted
as independent bondsmen for the firm’s stability;
the interesting matter of the Monier arch ; the
matter of that other objectionable person,
Inspector Reid, who was bounced from Car-
ter’s contract apparently because he made
himself a nuisance in prying into the proceed-
ings of Carter’s workmen; the matter of
the cavity 7ft. 6in. long, 3ft. wide, and Ift.
deep—supposed to be packed with cement
at 10s. per cask—and the other cavities, or sus-
pected cavities, found in Carter, Gummow’s
North Shore sewer-contract; and a host of other
matters which there is no space to elucidate.
Some of these matters had certainly a queer
appearance ; but Judge Murray conclusively
showed that the charges based upon them had
very little in them. The Bulletin willingly
subscribes Is. 6d. in order that Judge Murray’s
bumps may be felt by a competent phrenologist.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Maoriland Referendum.
The national vote on Prohibition, which was
taken a few days ago along with Maoriland
general election, was the second instance within
recent times when the Referendum has been
adopted in Australasia. The other occasion
was in S.A., a few months back, when the
Bible-in-Schools issue was submitted to the
electors in exactly the same fashion. In each
instance the Referendum distinctly refuted all
the prophecies which Australian Toryism lias
made concerning it. There was nothing dis-
tinctively “ un-English ” about it, or if there
was, the un-English characteristics didn’t come
to the surface, and for that matter it would
have made very little difference if they had.
It didn’t lead to any revolutionary upheaval,
or result in any rash or “ experimental ” legis-
lation, or shake the pillars of the constitution,
or place the power in the hands of the lowest
elements of society, or do anything else that it
ought to have done, according to the frequent
jeremiads of the Eat Man. On each occasion
the popular vote was distinctly a Conservative
force ; in went in the main for keeping things as
they are, which is the principal feature of the
Tory policy. Also, it tended to preserve the
greatest and most beautiful feature of the Con-
stitution—Government by the majority—which
was otherwise in danger of being lost, and,
therefore, it would seem that the Referendum
is more strictly constitutional than the
Constitution itself. In S.A. the Bible-in-
schools party, by sheer vociferation, almost
managed to pass itself off for a majority, or, at
least, a very powerful and increasing minority.
Parliament might in time have given way to
it under the impression that it really was a
majority, it being impossible, under the ordin-
ary electoral system, to sort out the issues, if
the Referendum had not put the matter to a
definite test and shown what a small and cheeky
fragment the Scriptural crowd really was. In
Maoriland the Prohibition party was also, by


sheer assurance and noise and self-assertion,
getting on well towards passing itself off as a
majority till the Referendum put it in its right
place. The Bulletin advocates the Referen-
dum because it believes that the majority should
prevail; that if the majority votes for, or is
too tired to vote against, a bad system
it ought to get that system, and that
it should have every facility for making
its political circumstances just as bad or as
good as it deserves they should be. And
at the same time it believes that the Fat Man,
who regards the popular vote as a scheme of
red revolution, is suffering from visions. The
mass of the community is probably more apa-
thetic than the Fat Person gives it credit for.
It doesn’t want change for the mere sake of
change ; it isn’t absolutely crying for new fads
simply because they are new ; in some respects
it moves a great deal more slowly than its Par-
liamentary representatives, and the Referendum
would probably be a brake upon the Legisla-
ture quite as often as it would be a motive
force. At all events the experiments that have
been made in these provinces go to show that
the Referendum is quite safe—it is a perfectly
peaceful and rational affair, which goes to work
methodically, and does none of the dreadful
acts of smash and Vandalism ascribed to it.
And curiously enough the Fat Person is never
tired of pointing out, and truly enough, that in
Switzerland, the home of the Referendum, it
lias been quite as often a conservative influence
than any other kind. And then having thus
demonstrated that it is perfectly safe, and that
it doesn’t result in a general rush after every
new delusion, he denounces it furiously on the
ground that it would lead to general upheaval
and break the Constitution into small dust.
The Fat Man is a sadly illogical person in many
ways. ' /

To the Fat Men of Australia. /
The Australian Fat Man and the National Ass
and the Patriotic League and the Leg. Councils
and all the other property-representatives of
this great country are a tolerably comprehen-
sive fool, looking neither before nor after. The
Fat Man crowd has one big chance now if it
could only realise the fact and grab its oppor-
tunity with both hands. Its chance lies in
becoming the Anti-borrowing party. The
weak point of the Democrats in several of the
provinces is that they are content, in too many
cases, to drift along with the old borrowing
disease and let the consequences take care of
themselves. The Fat Man crowd arouses no
public sympathy when it wails about the
wrongs of Proputty, but if it piedged itself up
to the hilt that, when it came into power, it
would do no borrowing whatever except for the
renewal of old loans, it would attract the votes
of almost everybody who has any definite
idea as to where Australasia is going
to. Also, it would have a tangible policy
which it much wants ; it would attack
its enemy on his weakest point and make a bad
exhibition of him ; and it would be working for
its own interests—if it was only capable of
realising the fact. It is the interest bill on
borrowed money which creates the difficulty of
making ends meet ; and it is this dif-
ficulty which causes Parliament to levy
land and income taxes and other things
that make the Fat Man have bad dreams at
night. Further, the more money is spent now
for non-productive works the bigger the interest
bill to be met out of taxation in the future, and
the more land and income tax will follow. If
the Upper Houses of Australasia would re-
morselessly throw out every item of every
Loan Bill which provided for expenditure
on works not yielding direct revenue, they
would furnish good reason for their con-
tinued existence as a cheek on the foolish-
ness of the people’s representatives, and would
do a great deal to avert their approaching ex-
tinction. Also, they would make it possible
for the era of Fat Man Government to come
back again ; in fact, they would make many in-
telligent Democrats feel inclined to try a spell
of Fat Man administration as an experiment.
It is a lamentable essay on the Conservative in-
telligence that it can’t see the weak point in its
enemy’s administration and avail itself thereof.
Every other party except the absolute anti-bor-
rowing party has been tried already ; this is the
one chance for a new crowd to start with a new
battle-cry, and, if a really strong leader arose,
and opened his mouth to a diameter of eight
feet, and let out the whoop of the new party in
accents that would rend the heavens, it ought
to be the beginning of a political revolution.
«.
Anothur Public Complication.
The N.S. Wales Civil Service law has got still
further tangled up. Under the old system a
retiring civil servant was entitled to a gratuity
of a month’s salary for every year’s service;
this was part of his recognised contract with
the Government. When the new C.S. Bill was
introduced in the Assembly Premier Reid drew
special attention to the fact that this right was
carefully preserved ; the only difference was
that it was no longer compulsory to contribute
to the Superannuation Fund. As the Superan-
nuation arrangement simply means that a C.S.
buys a certain alleged benefit for his own old
age with his own money, the refusal to contri-
bute to the Fund should certainly not carry
with it any penalty, and Premier Reid ex-
pressly stated that it didn’t. Later on
he moved, without assigning any reason,
to omit certain words, and the obedi-
ent Assembly omitted them without asking
the reason or the probable result. Later still,
after the Bill was passed, the same Premier
Reid announced that, in the opinion of some
legal authorities whose names were not given,
the Act was so fixed that every civil servant
who ceased contributing to the Superannuation
Fund thereby forfeited absolutely his right to a
retiring allowance. If this is true, many people
who ceased contributing to the Fund on Pre-
mier Reid’s assurance that they could do so
without any loss have thereby been entrapped
into sacrificing retiring allowances worth, in
some cases, hundreds of pounds. But every-
thing is nebulous and uncertain, and the service
is in blank ignorance of its own whereabouts.
The questions it wants answered are seven
ia number—(l) Was it the omission by
Premier Reid of that one clause from
the Bill which cancelled the retiring allow-
ances ? (2) Was it omitted with that end
in view ? (3) If the clause did not
make the difference, then the Bill itself was
never what Premier Reid claimed that it was,
and in that case was it misrepresented by sheer
stupidity, or how ? (4) Who are the legal
authorities who say that the retiring allow-
ances are forfeited ? (5) If they really are for-
feited, does the Govt, mean to take a mean
advantage of this accidental injury (it must
have been accidental after Premier Reid’s
assurances), or will it put the matter right ?
(6) Is there any intention in the matter to bull-
doze civil servants into further contributions to
the Superannuation Fund by thus penalising
those who withdraw, and thereby to keep the
Fund on its staggery legs a little longer ? (7)
Supposing a C.S. keeps on contributing to
the Fund so as to preserve his compen-
sation rights in case of retirement, and
instead of retiring he hangs on until he is
superannuated in the regular course, and
then his pension goes bung through the insol-
vency of the Superannuation Fund, and he is
left with neither compensation nor pension,
how will that pan out ? (8) And, in the face of
all this, wouldn’t it be best to wind up the
miserable Fund as quickly and equitably as
possible, and abolish all retiring allowances so
far as concerns future members of the service so
as to make the allowance difficulty as short as
possible, and simply make every public servant
insure his life in a State Insurance Department,
so that he will have some chance of knowing
his own whereabouts more or less ? These
questions are all the more pertinent inas-
much as the Government has just taken
two eminent legal opinions (apparently not
' the same opinions alluded to above) as to what
it means by its own enactment; and one emin-
ent legal authority says it means one thing
while the other says it means almost the exact
opposite. Also, each says that the Act is so
hopelessl) r confused and stupid and muddle-
headed that his opinion is practically worthless,
one view of the case being about as probable as
the other. And this is how lawyers make law.

Dibbs, ex-Republican.
Dear old George Dibbs arose the other day at
a meeting of the N.S. W. Bankers’ Institute,
and inside balf-an-hour furnished all manner of
good reasons why no constituency in Austra-
lasia should ever again send that lengthy poli-
tician to Parliament. There was a time when
a man named Dibbs used to declare that he was
a Republican. This is a sample of what a man
named Dibbs, K. C. M. G., declares to-day :
Were they prepared to make the huge sacrifices which
would be necessary for the benefit of the other colonies?
At the time of the original convention the people boasted
what a glorious thing it would be to have a flag of our
own. Such a thing would be impossible. Our flag must
be the British ensign. (Hear, hear.) The desire under-
Ivin i the question of federation was eventually to cut the
painter. (Cries of “ No, no.”) He had no hesitation in
saying that what was wanted by most of those who advo-
cated federation was at once to set up a kingdom of our
own. (Cries of “ No, no.”) That a population of four
millions of people not one million of bread-winners—•
should have the audacity to propose to set up a flag of
their own and become an independent nation was too
ridiculous to be seriously entertained. They would
be the sport of other nations within comparatively
a few hours. ... In these colonies they were
over legislated for and over governed over legis-
lated for because they had the curse of payment
of members. By the creation of the Federal Par-
liament as proposed by the Commonwealth scheme they
would be creating another set of hungry political loafers
to be provided for by the working bees of this country.
As long as they had payment of members they wouid
have confusion and dilliculty. . . In any case, New
South Wales, the wealthiest and soundest of the colonies,
would have to make the greatest sacrifices. He felt that
New South Wales would be able to borrow as advan-
tageously as federated Australia. The combined colonies
wouid only be able to borrow more cheaply because the
loan would be endorsed by New South Wales. What
Queensland would like to destroy was the enormous in-
fluence which the Labor-party exercised over her politics.
By creating a sentimental union to-day they would be
taking a step which in the end would bring about a
general break up and general bloodshed.
This is the new Dibbs —the parochial, conser-
vative, imperialistic Dibbs, K.C.M.G. And
the logic of the new Dibbs, K.G.M.G., is
pitiable reading. There is nothing wrong with
payment of members, save that it helped to
bring about the downfall of Dibbs, whose ser-
vices the people apparently regarded as good
enough to be accepted gratis, but not good
enough to be worth paying for. There is no-
thing wildly absurd about Australia starting as
a nation with a population of four million souls ;
about half the independent states of the world
contrive to struggle through under much the
same circumstances, and unless the Australian
is a very poor, mean creature, and there is no
fight at all in G. Dibbs’ National Guard, this
country might do the same. The idea that all
the nations of the earth are hungering to possess
this plain, ordinary, drought-cursed land and
to annex Jamberoo and Booligal is probably
quite erroneous. Also there- doesn’t seem to be
much in Dibbs’ tale of the special glories of
N.S. Wales. That province may be able to
borrow as cheaply as a Commonwealth would,
but, so far, it hasn’t been able to borrow even as
cheaply as Westralia. There is nothing behind
the theory that N.S.W. would have to
make “great sacrifices” for federation; at
least, no one has ever shown what these
sacrifices are. There is nothing, save the
assertion of that Dibbs, who used to be a repub-
lican, behind the statement that Federationists
are necessarily disloyal and want to up-end the
blessed Throne ; loyalty or disloyalty has
nothing to do with the matter. Anyhow, no
Australian disloyalist ever proposed founding
a “ Kingdom ” of our own, and Dibbs the
First, as a prospective monarch, is yet un-
dreamt of. There is no evidence, save
the unsupported statement of the man who
says he didn’t damn Chicago, to show
that Federation must lead to disaster and
the shedding of nose-blood. The declaration
that Queensland yearns to get rid of the incubus
of the Labor-party rests on the ipse dixit of
the long, splashy orator, and on nothing else.
The new Dibbs, K.C.M.G., is a truly awful
example of the decadence which comes of sell-
ing one’s soul for a gewgaw and a big cigar.
Other K.C.M.G.’s have “ decaded ” likewise,
but none of them have done it so frankly and
openly and shamelessly and suddenly as G.
Dibbs, who now advocates disunion on the
ground that it will keep Australia weak
and dependent on England. And yet Dibbs
was, or thought he was, some kind of a genuine
republican—at least this paper believes so—
until the big cigar tempted him and he fell, and
what a fall it was !
♦
A Lost Opportunity.
The Board appointed to inquire into the disor-
ganisation of Melbourne Post and Telegraph
Department, and the alleged orgies and high-
kicking carnivals which went on there, and the
general aspect of wassail which pervaded the
place, has presented a report of weak white-
wash. It suggests feebly that the official
engine-driver should be a man with the “ same
qualifications which are necessary for the same
position outside the service.” In other words,
the Government shouldn’t break its own laws
by employing an uncertificated man, and
thereby run needless risk of the boiler bursting
and lifting the building into the air. The Board
also says that there is an “ atmosphere of dis-
loyalty ” about the establishment, but doesn’t
saddle the responsibility upon any one ; and
it is “surprised ” that the Deputy Postmaster
didn’t know of the drunks and the high-kicking
and the general atmosphere of Flossie which
filled the department. It doesn’t go so far as
to hint that if the D.P.G. had been reasonably
competent lie would have known about these
matters, and that the State ought to get a man
who would know ; it is only “ surprised.” The
wine and woman aspect of the case, the awful
frauds which seem to have been perpetrated on
the Government, the wholesale disappearance
of property, the system of giving most of the
orders to one favored firm at apparently about
three times what the work was worth, the
stealing, swindling, back-biting, “tip” and
general incompetence, the leaving of important
work to casual laborers while the bosses leaned
up against bars, the system by which no one
even knew what stores were on hand, the irre-
sponsible way valuable State property was
habitually “ chucked down ” in a yard or any-
where and left to rot and be forgotten—all
these things are left out. They always are
in Melbourne. And in hushing up the ugly
scandal the Board lost its chance of pro-
ducing a really interesting document. Its
report, if written by a man of real literary
capacity, should have been a bacchanalian docu-
ment with vine leaves in its hair—a publication
with wine and song and love and Tottie in it,
and stories of ankles and high-kicks and stock-
ings and silver-buckled shoes and warm, round,
white arms hugging the postal official during
office hours. And in the background of the
picture should have appeared the grim, metho-
dical German contractor pegging away at
charging three times as much as the work was
worth, and the doubtful engine-driver sitting
on the safety-valve in the basement. There
were great possibilities about that report, and
it panned out for nothing but weak apology.
Epileptics in Insane Asylums.
With reference to the horrible mediaeval prac-
tice in N.S. Wales and some other provinces
of shutting up epileptics in lunatic asylums—
without occupation, without amusement,
without distraction, though perfectly sane
and rarely dangerous even in their occa-
sional paroxysms The Bulletin has re-
ceived this letter from the mother of an
epileptic patient now in an asylum near Sydney.
The case will easily be recognised by many,
and the lady’s name will be made known to the
Col. Secretary if desired :
Editor Bulletin, —The statement of “ Medicus,” in your
issue of Oct. 31, that it is “ an accursed outrage ” to im-
mure epileptic persons in insane asylums is full of bitter
truth for me. My son, when four years old, was kicked
behind the ear by a horse ; he lay unconscious for some
time, but, under medical care, recovered. In time, he
went to school, and grew up very smart, healthy, and
very strong. When he left school he was employed as
invoice-clerk in a very well-known wool-store at the Cir-
cular Quay, for over four years ; he was a member of the
School of Arts, and received a first prize for shorthand at
the age of 15. Was clever in all gymnastic exercises, and
a good swimmer and diver, having, before many on-
lookers at Circular Quay, jumped in and rescued a
drowning girl.
When between 16 and 17 he had his first epileptic
attack, and for some years they always came in the night,
and he would be quite right all day. First I took him to
Dr. Sydney Jones, who said the injury to the head was
the cause, and recommended three courses of treatment—
the last being an operation to remove the depression of
the skull. I asked why the fits did not come on before ;
the reply was the brain had not grown sufficiently to
come in contact with the skull. In course of time it was
found necessary for my son to resign his position as clerk,
following the advice of Drs. Jones, Manning, the late Dr.
Fortescue, and two others, mental work not being con-
considered good for him. His employer regretted his
resignation, and gave him a cheque, with good wishes for
his future career.
Some time was spent in medical treatment, until it was
decided to send him to Alfred Hospital for the operation.
After 13 weeks as an inmate, the doctors thought the case
not bad enough to risk his life for ; so, with the advice of
Dr. Manning and others, he was kept to assist Mr. Jesse,
who I think at that time was secretary in the hospital.
There he remained, being also employed in the dis-
pensing at times. Then the hospital was found to be
heavily in debt; expenses had to be lessened, and a
great many of the employes were discharged—among the
rest, my son. Next year, he again went to be operated
on, but the operation did not stop the fits.
Since then he has gradually got worse, and has been
supported by his family, who have done all they possibly
could to keep him. He was twice in the asylum, and with
great effort, his brothers obtained his release; and for
nearly four years we kept him as happy as we could, until
one day he took a fit in William-street, Darlinghurst. A
crowd soon gathered, and the police dragged him to the
watchhouse, thinking he was drunk. On finding himself
in a strange place he became violent, and made desperate
efforts to escape. ■ Next morning, being Saturday, he was
remanded until Monday, then again brought up before
the Court, where it is the custom to have two doctors to
certify as to insanity. One of them, Dr. Goode, recog-
nised him as “a fine, smart young fellow,” He was sent
to the asylum.
He is quite sane between the fits ; in the prime of life,
and willing to work, yet he has nothing to do from one
week’s end to another. If in the well-swept yard he can
pick up a bit'of anything to pick his nails with that is his
life's occupation. Could any sane man stand such a life ?
He has said to me, “Will the gate ever open for me,
mother?” What could I answer? There are notices
hungup: “ You are required to look cheerful ” —which I
try to do, though my heart is torn. He told the doctor
he wanted to earn his own living, and I have politely
asked on many occasions might he have some work to
relieve the monotony of his existence. The answer is :
“He is subject to fits.” Then might he have a little
weeding in the garden ;he would want no tools. Reply :
“He would want tools for that.” Then might he
paint? He can do that very well, and used to work
with his brother, who is' in the building trade.
Answer, “ No.” Might he have a game of cricket ? “ No,
he takes fits.” Yet he always played at home, and loves
it, and I say it would not make'the fits come on any
oftener. lam told I must not interfere. There are a
favored few who go into the cricket-ground, hut he never.
His hands and arms are becoming weak for want of exer-
cise, yet he must never hold a bat. As “ Medicos ”
says, as I say : “ Far better kill him than put him
where he is to fret away his existence.”
When first I had occasion to go to the asylum I met a
very old lady who said she had come to see her boy. “ I
call him my boy,” she said, “for is what he was
when he came here, though now he is 45 ; and how
thankful I would be if some one would give him a dose of
poison, that I might know the end of him.” A shudder
passed through me, but I was not long until I thought
the same. I would be glad to go and see my son hung
so that his hopeless life might be ended. He is worse oft
than the prisoners in the gaols, and the others are like
him, for no fault of their own—with nothing to employ
their minds. Many years ago, as a child, I remember
prisoners working on the roads, and on their heads
they would have six or seven cabbage-tree hats,
which, if they could sell, would buy them some
little luxury. Why is some similar occupation noj
found for epileptics? My son can make door-mats ; he
used to make children’s barrows and a lot of other things,
and he is only one out of a great number similarly miser-
able.
His fate is far worse than death. I have been keeping
hot a grown-up son’s dinner, awaiting his home-coming,
and received a telegram to say he was drowned ; but that
grief has passed away. This is the worm that never dies.
I lie down in tears, and get up in tears. I know a great
many suffer as I do, and if only someone would take the
matter up, what an everlasting blessing he would have
from us !— An Unfortunate! Mother.
The statement that Queensland requires special
consideration in the matter of nigger-labor—
that her climatic conditions make the cheap
heathen a necessity, and she can’t be expected
to federate unless there is some special guaran-
tee that the Commonwealth Government will
not interfere with her particular Kanaka—
has been made so often that through sheer
iteration it is beginning to find acceptance.
Yet it is a poor, thin, transparent excuse at the
best. The Northern Territory is equally in
want of a guarantee that the Commonwealth
won’t expel Chinamen ; if it did the Territory
would be practically depopulated. Also the
Territory and the northern part of Westralia
have practically the same climate as North
Queensland, and are just as much or as little
in want of nigger-labor to give their industries
a start. The summer climate of N.Q.,
again, is very little more dreadful than that of
north-western N.S.W. Moreover, if Queensland
requires special concessions because it is hot,
S.A. and Westralia are equally entitled to ,
them because they are dry ; these two are the
most droughty provinces of this continent,
and their right to demand special guarantees in
the matter of irrigation works is quite as good
as Queensland’s to demand assurances as to the
continuance of its Kanaka. In reality there is
nothing special in the situation of Queensland,
and there are no special points about its nigger
question, even assuming that the Kanaka is
necessary (which he isn’t) to the Queensland
sugar-industry. As things now stand, Federa-
tion offers very fair terms to the Northern
planter. First, it might not abolish the
Kanaka at all. Secondly, it certainly would
abolish the interprovincial sugar duties, and
give Queensland the free run of Southern mar-
kets, and this item should be worth all the
Kanaka labor in the north. As Queensland
would go into the Federation with a possibility
of keeping her Kanakas as well as a certainty
of getting the markets of the other Australias
opened to her, and gaining a valuable prefer-
ence over foreign competitors, it is a very fair
gamble. The demand of the North that it
should get the run of the Southern markets and
receive special cheap labor concessions as well
is a huge aggressive grab which is beyond all
reason.
Last week Vic. Leg. Assembly concluded its
enquiry into the reconstruction of the Com-
panies Act Amendment Bill by Sargood’s
special committee, and the Bill w r ent back to
the Council for further insult. All, or nearly
all, of the alterations inflicted upon the original
measure in the Upper House were “disagreed
with.” The political stomach of the Lower
House (and the L.H. in this matter represents
the stomach of bank depositors and shareholders
generally) seems to revolt against the “ whole-
some legislation ” which Sargood’s committee
recommended. On the other hand, the Sargood
and his following are unanimously resolved to
block financial reform wherever it threatens
danger to their private interests—especially
W’liere it interferes with the right of directors
to lend themselves the shareholders’ and
depositors’ money. Therefore the Companies
Act Amendment Bill is not worth talking
of again, except as a casus belli. It cannot
be passed in a respectable form ; it never was
expected to pass, and unless Premier Turner
intends to use it for lighting a constitutional
fire the document is merely a record of idle
debate and wasted time. Victorians have suf-
fered much under the bad company-management
which this Bill would preserve them from in
the future, but up to now there is no indication,
outside Parliament, of the victims caring a
button whether they get preserved or pickled.
Change the scene to England—imagine the
House of Peers fighting on behalf of financial
jobbery and corruption, whilst the community
was still suffering the after-effects of a crisis !
The community would at least amuse itself by
making a noise, especially on Sundays.
Dear the youth of 19 and the
girl of 16 who became the possessors of an un-
welcome infant, the boy repudiating responsi-
bility by urging age of consent and his parents’
veto. Doubtless in this, as in most cases of
the sort, the real issue was, “ Shall the boy’s or
the girl’s parents support said infant, the young
people themselves being out of the question? ”
Now, marriage would throw the onus on the
boy’s parents, non-marriage on those of the
girl. Nature takes car e that the female, married
or unmarried, shall do her share towards
the reproduction and preservation of the race.
This share frequently prevents her in a civilised
state of society from supporting herself or her
infant. Society has decreed in marriage that
the husband and father shall provide. Why
not the same when there is no marriage ? If it
is no hardship for a married man to suppoi t
his children, it is surely none for an unmarried
man ’—provided, of course, that his fatherhood
is proved. In the case on hand, it was no more
unfair for the boy’s than the girl’s parents to
lift the heavy end of the log, but the former
escaped through the gate of the marriage “ age
of consent,” while the other side tried to get
even by means of the W.C.T.U. “age of con
sent.” The social question will never be fairly
settled till every child is legitimate and able to
demand a father’s support.— Warra.

Dr. Gressyvell, Chairman

Lew Din, of Melbourne, a heathen laundry-
man, fined for washing and ironing when he ought
to have been in bed, or for some other such offence
against the Factories Act, would seem to be a
quite up-to-date person. He cursed the “lallikin
Parliament ” for making a “ lallikin bye-law,’’and
was ultimately led out of court shouting—“Me
pay fine? No damfear ! Take it out in plison.”
This is civilisation, or next door to it.
The N.S.W. National Shipwreck Relief
Society is working on wrong principles altogether.
At the annual meeting last week Gov. Hampden
was put up to complain that big merchants and
others didn’t come forward with subscriptions as
they ought to. Who is going to subscribe to
swell a fixed deposit of =815,000, which is what the
Society now boasts of ? President Storey seems
to think it is the Society’s business to accumulate
large funds and dole out small charities. Last
year the Society could only find ,£705 worth of
distress to relieve, though, as Gov. Hampden
said, 078,824 seamen passed in and out of Sydney
alone in ’94. It may have been that there was
wonderfully little distress, or it may have been
that the Society didn’t want to relieve distress if
it had to break into its precious .£15,000 at fixed
deposit. The President says the Society is saving
up for a big disaster. But the public can always
be relied upon to subscribe liberally for a big
disaster, which hits its emotions hard; it is the
little, every-day, one-man disasters which the
public doesn’t care about that the Society should
relieve—and apparently doesn’t. The Govt, is
still contributing £250 a year to this institution,
though a Society with £15,000 at fixed deposit can
very well do without a subsidy.

r lhe difficulty between the two stout
gentlemen re the new Palace Theatre raged more
or less intermittently right up to the opening
night. The larger and more commodious of the
two was last seen advertising that the newly-im-
ported co. would appear on Saturday under his
management at Sydney Opera House. But when
Saturday came the Palace opened in due course,
and the dingy temple in King-street, above the
public-house and adjacent to the cheap banana-
shop, remained as usual, deserted and given up to
the ghosts and the echoes and the casual rat sit-
ting in the moonbeam. Also, Arthur Garner’s
advt. disappeared about this time from the papers,
and it is understood that the future combat, what-
ever it is about, will rage in the law-courts per
medium of the usual 6s. «d.
« » * *
The Palace Theatre opened with a loud
bang. It is a small place, but it is probably the
most gorgeous theatre on earth, or thereabouts.
There is such a vast mass of decoration about it
that only a very bloated capitalist will be able to
keep it in complete repair. If it is ever allowed to
grow old and run to seed, there is so much color
to fade, and so much glitter to fall into disrepair,
and such a lot of art and loveliness to drop into
the sere and yellow leaf that it will be suggestive
of the painted wreck that one meets at the
street-corner after dark, with the grease-mark
on her satin dress and the broken ostrich-
feather in her smashed bonnet. To “do
up” the Palace, when it wants to be done up,
would cripple the fortune of an ordinary capi-
talist. George Adams will probably die of a
broken heart by-and-bye through the effort to
preserve his little bit of Paradise in its original
freshness and glitter—he will die struggling with
a paint-pot to the bitter end in the effort to keep
the moth and the dust and the blow-fly off 14,000
square-yards of fresco and other artistic beauty.
The Palace is very beautiful indeed, but the pre-
sent writer wouldn’t have such a place on his
hands for a great deal.
* * * *
The co. isn’t up to the magnificent charac-
ter of the theatre ; the one is extraordinary, while
the other is, on the average, only respectable.
Some of the performers are brilliant and
unique, but a lot of decent mediocrity
weighs them down. Mademoiselle Clotilde
Antonio is one of the most remarkable acro-
bats The Bulletin ever saw. She only does a
few acts, but they are unusually clever, they are
done smartly and neatly ; there is no needless
delay or padding ; and the performer is a pretty
little woman whose grace doesn’t desert her even
when she is standing on her head and playing a
violin solo at the same time. Knowles is a
comedian who is also far above the average. His
alphabetical joke was done here nine years ago by
that beloved humorist Frank Lincoln, and there
is a misguided tendency to say “ damn ” in quite a
number of his stories, and his condensed state-
ment in verse about a model with nothing on being
found sitting on the artist’s knee is more coarse
than funny. Still there is a vast amount of real
humor about Knowles, and he promises to boom
exceedingly. The three Helevines are also excel-
lent comedians, and the rest of the show is nothing
in particular. Syd. Deane and Henry Weir are
two pleasant singers in evening dress. Miss Lottie
Moore (who should stick to the nigger items and
eschew the serious) is most vivacious and charm-
ing, and her somersault is hereby strongly re-
commended. The Winterton sisters are pretty
and graceful, and dance a nice, ordinary dance
in a nice, ordinary way. Another lady has a
banjo solo and a short frock to her credit,
and about the female tenor the less said the
better. Henry Lee’s personations of great
men are very clever indeed, but it is impos-
sible to extract much soul-thrill from this sort
of thing. Two of the people, by the way, sing
melancholy songs about “ mother. ” Taking every-
thing into account, the Palace co. is a very good
ordinary co. ; it has some extraordinary people in
it, and some others who are so very ordinary that
the general average is one of respectable ordinari-
ness. Some of the ordinary people, however, are
pretty enough to be put in’a picture, which is at
least something in their favor.

The Potter-Bellew Co. made its last Aus-
tralian appearance on Saturday night in “ Fran-
cillon.” This is the drama in which Mrs. Potter
claims untruly to have gone away in a cab late at
night with a strange male person, and sinned after
an oyster supper ; and it suits her, partly because
there are dukes and other noblemen in it, and
partly because it is the lowest - necked evening-
frock piece in her repertoire. The last recollec-
tion which Australia retains of Mrs. Potter is a
vision of two white shoulders and an alarming
quantity of back appearing from out of a garment
that had no visible means of support, unless the
top of it was attached by some unseen agency to
a balloon in the flies. About 38cwt. of legitimate
vegetables were passed over the footlights on
Saturday, and a much larger audience than
usual applauded vociferously, and insisted on
the curtain being hauled up fifteen times in
all. Apparently Mrs. Potter departs just as
her popularity is really setting in—as for
Bellew, he has been popular all along, and his
vanishment creates a soulful void among the
jewelled dames and demoiselles in the d.c. The
second Potter season at Sydney Lyceum was cer-
tainly much better than the first, inasmuch as the
star didn’t paint herself with such a reckless flush,
and didn’t writhe half so much. In her first
season she ranged from bad to awful ; in her
second she began by being from bad to medium,
and gave signs of further improvement, until, as
Therese Raquin, she surprised everybody by being
really admirable. This was her very best per-
formance, and Tosca, with the vegetable hat and
the bait hanging all round it and the violent
jumps and wriggles, was probably her very worst.
The Bulletin knows of no other actress whose
best and worst are so very far apart, and it bids
Mrs. Potter a regretful farewell as an interesting
gamble, whose uncertainty left the stiffened horse
and the faked bicycle-race absolutely nowhere.

This week, a Christian community cele-
brates the greatest episode in religious history by
eating and drinking more than it can comfortably
accommodate, and leaving an unusual amount of
banana-peel on the pavement, and swearing witli
more than its wonted fluency, and having many
free fights, and appearing at the police court in
the morning with a blackened eye and a shock-
ingly depraved hat. During all this week the
Drunks’ Train will be more than usually crowded,
and the last man will fall overboard more regularly
than usual while jumping for three ferry-boats at
once and not knowing which is the real one.
Therefore, this beinsr a great and holy festival as
aforementioned, all the theatres break out in an
unwonted blaze of glory. Westmacott’s panto-
mime of “ Sinbad the Sailor,” alleged to be a
specially brilliant production with an enormous
cast, starts at Her Majesty’s to-night (Thursday).
Geo. Rignold’s military drama, “Tommy Atkins,”
erupts at the Royal same night. The Brough
Comedy Co., with two new men, H. R. Roberts
and Percy Perris, and one new lady, Miss Hope
Mayne, of whom many good things are prophesied,
opens Sydney Cri. on Saturday with “Nancy and
C 0.,” a comedy which is wholly new to Sydney.
Charles McCarthy, the American Irish comedian,
makes his advent at the Lyceum also on Saturday;
and J. Cosgrove begins a season of melodrama at
the Gaiety. Altogether there will be seven
theatres and various other casual shows raging in
Sydney simultaneously, and something must
break.

Jimmy M‘Mahon, the “Mighty Atom,”
has laid in a series of new cinematograph pictures
for his Xmas outbreak, a needless extravagance,
partly because the old pictures were good efiough
to satisfy anybody, and partly because the average
Xmas patron is too much of a wreck to trouble
about details. Sestier and Barnett’s “Cin.” also
announces a special effort, and Sydney Tivoli pro-
poses to do something more than usually extra-
ordinary in the variety way with the great Chirg-
win in the cast for the first time in Sydney ; and
in fact the lurid glare of Krishmish and the foot-
prints of the Xmas turkey are over everything.

All the Melbourne playhouses intend to
hang out a banner this Xmas, and the fear that
one or more of them will suffer a bad time is
haunting The Bulletin’s breast like a piece of
pudding. Nobody asked for a re-opening of five
theatres on Boxing Night. Of late the city has
been fully satisfied with three, hence the awful
sadness of the coming situation. Pive showmen
are about to draw lots, and he who draws the
smallest lot must expect to go under.

“Matsa, Queen of Fire : or, the Apples of
Isis,” &c., &e., is the pantomime extravaganza
arranged by Bert Royle and manager Williamson
for the Princess’. This vast undertaking opens in
a Mist of Past Ages and concludes with a Flying
Ballet. Incidentally it will illustrate the return
of Rameses 111. to Memphis on a P. and O.
steamer ; also the Nile will rise during the even-
ing in honor of Leoni Clarke, who conducts an
exhibition of trained cats. The “ Djin-Djin ”
company, supported by the Royal Ballerinas, have
been rehearsing “ Matsa ” for many weeks, and
rumors of impending splendour are in the air.

Bland Holt, at the Royal, will produce
“ For England,” a melodrama with much horse
and British valor crammed into ten tableaux.
Bland Holt’s army has of late been spoiling for a
fight, so this Yuletide opportunity to rally round
the dear old Flag on the stage will answer the
same purpose as a seasonable assault upon a police-
man in private life. “For England” is due on
Boxing Night.

A rival melodrama, “ The Serpent’s Coil,”
will happen at the Alexandra on Xmas Eve. The
Alexandra, by the way, has renounced its old, un-
lucky title and become born again under the style
of Her Majesty’s. A new name, together with a
redecorated interior and a new manager (William
Cosgrove), may change the fortunes of the Haleck.
Anyway, the creepy drama from Sydney ought to
appeal to the neighborhood, seeing' that a number
of serpents recently broke loose at the top of
Bourke-street, and are now understood to be
chasing rats around the northern suburbs.

The Opera House bill for Saturday next
includes Coleman, Alice Leamar, the Vaidis

Frank Thornton, who has brought several
new faces out with him, will start his fourth Aus-
tralian campaign at Melbourne Bijou on Boxing
Night. “ Charley’s Aunt ” was the particular suc-
cess of Thornton’s last visit, and “The Strange
Adventures of Miss Brown,” with himself in the
name-part, promises to be joyfully reminiscent of
the elderly female from Brazil. At all events,
Thornton is a reminiscence that never fails to
raise a profitable laugh.

Adelina Antonio, who lately renewed her
engagement with the Fitzgeralds’, appears to be
somewhat of a martyr to art on the high trapeze.
The graceful lady lives a life of severe self-denial
that she may not come to sudden death in the net
when she makes her unique back-fall. Rising at
seven o’clock Madame Adelina goes for a brisk
walk, followed by a light breakfast of fish and
fruit at about 8.30. Five hours later she makes an
athletic dinner—a well-cooked steak, fruit, and a
glass of claret—and at 4.30 she drinks a cup of
very strong tea by way of stimulant for the nerves.
From then until the time of her appearance, about
9.15 usually, the artist puts nothing into her mouth,
nor allows many words to come from it. Perhaps
she! takes a turn on the trapeze a while after
breakfast or during the afternoon. If she
be giving two performances a day her
dinner arrangements are altered and modified
accordingly, but, anyhow, on the completion of her
evening task Madame sups, by rule, and goes to
bed always on the safe side of midnight. There is
no joyous lingering into the small hours, no cham-
pagne festivity, for the trapeziste. Off duty
Madame is a sad-looking woman, and if perchance
a friend comments on her seriousness she points
upwards and says, “My smiles are for ze audi-
ence.’’ Performing in mid-air she appears light-
hearted. She is proud of her work, and the
smiles come easy to her until at last she stands
white and weary upon the highest bar. When the
drop to come is much more than 30 yards, as at
Melb. Exhibition Building, her face is a shade
paler than usual. She places her feet together
with careful exactness, stiffens herself, leans
backward as far as her arms will stretch—
and drops. The revolution in the air is cal-
culated to a nicety, with a regard for grace that
testifies eloquently to presence of mind in the
falling body. Madame’s existence depends upon
the timing and management of that somersault,
but she studies effect, like the artist she is, even
at the dread moment. A wonderful woman,
truly. Her performance is most admired by those
who see it oftenest, not by the ordinary unenthusi-
astic Australian who, after seeing it once, blames
himself for having been surprised into applause.
An average visitor seems loth to acknowledge the
full extent of the difference between a second-class

Mrs. Potter knows all the tricks. A very big crowd
assembled at Sydney wharf to see her off, and she took
care to arrive very late, thus saving herself a heap of
worry.
A Hobart tram-conductor named Yallance has succeeded
to an English title and a fortune, and has signalised the
occasion by marrying a local damsel of very humble
parentage who used to be on the stage.
Falk’s plans for cinematographing Gov. Brassey and
party in the act of marching up the Lawn at Flemington
were ingeniously laid. Escape was impossible for the
noble baron, so when he found himself roped into taking
a certain course, with the eye of the apparatus gazing
straight at him, he accepted the situation and walked
along somewhat like a cat upon hot bricks, as shown in
the picture.
Regina Nagel has gone on tour in Westralia. She was
strongly advised to stay in Melb. and follow up her
success, while her singing of “Ben Bolt” in “Trilby”
was fresh in the public mind. But a tempting offer was
too much for Regina’s strength of mind. The unwise
virgin is now doing her utmost to ruin a good voice by
singing to barbaric audiences in an open rotunda, which
is darkly alleged to be run in connection with a pub.
Melbourne Opera House is under condemnation again,
unluckily for Rickards. Eight years ago, or more, the
building was said to be in urgent need of reform, but
many tenants have come and gone since then without
exciting wild alarms among the “ authorities.” Probably
it is as sound and safe for crowding purposes as the
average theatre. This time the Board of Health talks of
closing the gallery forthwith, and insisting upon imme-
diate alterations and improvements elsewhere. Yet
Rickards was lately allowed to spend money in “ doing
up” the interior, when he might have been told to post
pone operations until the other job was ordered.
R. : “ Willie Cosgrove, much daring, tackles the awful
Aleck, on a 12 months’ lease, hoping- bv re-christening it
Her Majesty’s to exorcise its Jonahesque spirit. No good.
Boomed. Firstly, the Aleck building is not theatric in
plan, but barn-like, incompact, and apparently specially
designed for the convenience of gallery humorists desirous
of dropping pea-nuts on d.c. bare necks and bald heads.
Secondly, it struggles vainly against the reminiscent
smellfulness of old Stephen-street, into which its stalls
and d.c. entrances open, against the present evilness of
Lilly Boulke-street, which accommodates the other doors,
against the awful scarlet-womanliness of present Lons-
dale-street, which east and west suburbanites must
traverse to reach it. Thirdly, it has no bars. Its only
chance is to heave all seats out of its basement on to the
stage, tier them there as a d.c., turn the well into a per-
manent circus-ring, and run circus and variety all the
year round.”
White-Eyed Kaffir Chirgwin angles enthusiastically off
St. Kilda pier. His haul to date consists of one ancient
bell-topper, one long-dead dog, one defunct dog-fish, a
nail-keg, two boots (odd), three squid, one pair of
trousers, and one 3oz. mullet, over which latter he grows
quite enthusiastic.
Tiie Bulletin is incredibly assured that the wife of an
East Melb. divine called upon Mrs. Bland Holt and im-
plored her to try to induce her misguided husband to
abandon the stage and take to preaching at large. Mrs.
Holt refused this request, on the ground that she pre-
ferred her sinful lord in his original capacity.
A certain actor, who has been missed of late years, is
said to contemplate an early return to Australia and the
flesh-pots of the South. Should he carry out his inten-
tion, a society scandal which has lain in its peaceful grave
for quite a iong time will probably upset its tombstone
and climb out to meet him on arrival. It is rather a de-
cayed scandal now, but still quite good enough to do a
lot of service. The beginning of it was a swell supper ;
and an infuriated chorus-lady who burst in and banged
the provender and the wines about considerably with her
umbrella, and made revelations before she could be sup-
pressed which caused all the adjacent hair to stand on end.
Do Clement Scott’s theatrical criticisms carry weight
with the Hinglish public? The exalted Clement was
loud in praise of “ The Duchess of Coolgardie,” at Drury
Lane, an absurd drama which ran a month or so to pro-
fusely “ papered ” houses. He wrote : “ ‘ The Duchess of
Coolgardie ’ is a success, John Coleman was rewarded with
a triumph.” The play was a palpable failure on the first
night, a free and independent gallery “guyed ” it. Which
fact must be considered to discount the value of the
critic’s assurance that Hilda Spong, in the name-part, was
likewise a triumphant success.
It is part of the perversity of the theatrically-interested
public that it betrays no desire to be informed upon the
matrimonial (and other, if any) relationships existing in a
score of visiting “ co’s,” of even the most stellar brilliancy.
It is only when a Gaiety troupe comes along that it pro-
jects an eager ear in the direction of the gossiperwho can
tell it “ who is married to whom,” and who isn’t married
to—hm ! Is this due to the natural depravity of the
species, or is it that legs and gauze being one pole
(mentally) and lawn-sleeves and orange-blossoms being
the other, a contact in thought is the electrical resultant ?
Following up the success of “ Never introduce youi
Jonah to a whale,” the Salvation Army might do worst
than try the recent Sydney Tivoli success, “ I ain’t agoin’

Critic (referring to local amateur) : “ But is he such a

his voice singing ‘ Let me like a soldier fall ’! ”
Bland Holt’s most ticklish property to cart about is his

Albani is announced to sail from Vancouver for Sydney
about the end of Feb. Sims Reeves (who, by the way, is

When a show has perambulated Sydney and Melb. for
five years and has begun to develop sore feet and become
a chronic nuisance, it sails for the saintly city in a cheap
and nasty form.
A great London success is the dramatisation of Wey-

Melb. : “ Quite a magnificent blind basso sings on the
Block kerb. The most powerful voice ever I heard was
that of a woman. She used to sing al fresco in the
gardens of the wealthy at night, accompanied by two
men on the cornet and brass euphonium pompom. I have
heard her a mile off on a still evening.”
H. R. Harwood once quaintly rebuked a coterie of chat-,
terers at the old Ballarat Academy of Music, by hailing
them from the footlights with “It won’t be your fault,
young men, if you don’t find yourselves in the Victorian
Parliament one of these fine days.”
The Brassey yacht, Sunbeam, is now a recognised Melb.
side-show. The money taken at the gangway for admis-
sion is, of course, handed over to local charities.
The record charity theatrical performance in Australia
was Genevieve Ward’s production of “ Antigone,” at Melb.
Town Hall, in ’B9, in aid of the maternitv ward of the
local Women’s Hospital. It realised ±2521'145. 9d.
Narandera Ensign says that during R. D. Meagher’s

This is evidently the New Man.
Haresfoot: “Alma Grey is the brightest little child I

Williamson is largely responsible for the training of the
various bright youngsters connected with his companies
at one time or another. J.C. is fond of children, and
when he strikes a promising specimen the small aspirant

If there is anything in omens, G. Rignold has plai n I
“ Henry V.” for the last time in Sydney. On the i: .-it.
night of the season Henry fell over a property rock as lie
rushed on to the battlefield, and came down like a crate
of fenders and fire-irons on the stage, full-length. The
audience guffawed, and Henry arose with an unpublish-
able look on his countenance, and gnashed his teeth in
Agincourt. It will be interesting to note how the omen
pans out.
Melb. demise : William South, a player for whom the
times had long been out of joint. The London thirst for
romantic dramas such as the “ Prisoner of Zenda,” “ For
the Crown,” and “Under the Red Robe,” suggests that
utilities of South’s calibre will again become truly such,
but while the grass grows ! He was a truculent.
villain on the boards, while off them a.benevolent gentle-
man, somewhat reminiscent of Irving’s Vicar of Wake-
field. South was sometimes known as Montague on the

in-law, and the husband of clever Fanny Wiseman.
R. S. Smythe is taking a Christmas holiday in Sydney,

There has been so much indefinite wail about
the sacrifices Queensland and New South Wales must
make if they federate with the other provinces that it is
. worth while to put the sacrifice in plain figures and see
what it amounts to. As the Federal Government will
levy similar customs and excise duties all over Australia
there is no sacrifice under that head ; if one man or pro-
vince chooses to contribute more customs revenue than
another by using more foreign goods it is inflicting the
loss on itself by its own deliberate choice, and has no
special claim for consideration. In any case, a uniform
tariff will presently bring imports down to about the
same level all over Australia. But, considering the
revenues and charges which each province would put into
the common heap, things are as follows, according to
Coghlan’s latest figures -
Provincial Expenditure Charged to Federal
Government.
The income which each province supplies to
partly counterbalance these outlays is as follows :
Consequently the totals work out thus: —
The deficit to be made good out of general taxa-
tion is, therefore, over £3,932,000. N.S.W., which makes
so much lamentation about its “sacrifices,” supplies the
biggest deficit on the list. Queensland, which feels the
sacrifice so badly that it won’t come in at all, would sup-
ply the biggest shortage per head of the lot; in fact, its
deficit would be almost twice as large per head as the
average. As Queensland stands out, the combined
shortage of the five remaining provinces to be
made good out of the Federal Customs revenue
will be just about £3,000,000, or about £1 per
head of the population. Of the five provinces, Tas-
mania supplies the largest deficit in proportion to popu-
lation ; S. A. the second largest: N.S. Wales (which is
making the most row about the losses it will incur) the
third largest; and Victoria and Westralia the smallest.
In other words, on the present basis of things Westralia
will make the largest cash sacrifice for Australian unity ;
Victoria the next largest; N.S.W. will make the smallest;
while S.A. and Tasmania will make no sacrifice at all, but
will make a profit out of their neighbors. In the end, all
the provinces will no doubt make a profit by economy of
administration through the consolidation of departments
and by reduction of the interest on the aggregate debt,
but taking things as they are just now the above repre-
sents the situation.
* • * •
Last financial year, according to Coghlan
(“Seven Colonies,” page 363), New South Wales had the
biggest deficit (£634,000) in all Australasia, also it had
ten times as big a deficit as the other six provinces put
together. For the same year, also according to Coghlan
(page 409), it spent £559,000 of loan money on unpro-
ductive works which should have been paid for out of
current revenue, a far larger sum than was spent by any
other province. Between the two, N.S.W., in one year of
Premier Reid’s finance, went nearly £1,200,000 to the bad 1
Also it spent nearly twice as much loan money in all as
Westralia, over twice as much as S.A., Queensland, or
M.L., and six times as much as Victoria. And it is just
here that the blessed Freetrade boom comes in.
* * * »
For its last financial year Tasmania pub up a
borrowing record. It spent £113,278 of loan moneys, of
which £2318 went in revenue - producing works and
£110,960 was spent on works which yield no revenue—in
other words, it went to pay expenses which should, by
any system of honest finance, have been defrayed out of
current revenue.

Vic. municipal authorities are apparently try-
ing to straighten up and be decently honest. The total
bank overdrafts of Vic. local government bodies in ’93
were £174,000. Now the lean times have made them
swear off building beautiful shire halls, and the aggregate
overdraft is only £73,000.
• * • *
Vic. Upper House has a tenderness for the
insolvent. According to its latest amendment in the
Insolvency Bill the bankrupt is in future to rank as one
of his own creditors, and is to get a percentage, from 6d.
to 2s. in the £, of the dividend. Suppose there is another
land-boom, and a boomer starts, as many of the last lot
did, with £lOO and unlimited cheek, and land-booms on
credit till his liabilities are £40,000, and assets £20,000, he
having blewed or lost the other £20,000. And suppose he
gets 6d. in the £ on the dividend, then he will come out
with £5OO, and thus get a clear £4OO as his reward for
doing his creditors out of £20,000. The small bankrupt
who goes broke through sickness and want of employ-
ment will just get about the price of a beer out of his
dividend, but the stupendous boomer will make a very
respectable thing of it.
* * •
A reason assigned by Vic. Leg. Council for
refusing to pass the clause in the Companies Bill pro-
hibiting directors from lending themselves the share-
holders’ and depositors’ money is that one bank has one
director who does a large business with it, and if the
clause was passed he must either resign or take his busi-
ness elsewhere. Six years ago there was much better
reason to show, for then about 40 directors were doing
a large business with their own banks. But, as the other
39 have since mostly gone smash and smashed their banks
also, the above survivor is now quoted as a lonesome ex-
ample of the advantages of the system whereby the board
lends itself money on its own security approved by itself.
* * * *
The latest income-tax trouble is the demand of
the N.S.W. Commissioners that municipal councils shall
pay income-tax on their debenture interest and deduct it
from the debenture-holders. The councils curse on the
ground that it is none of their business. Also, a lot of
their debenture-holders haven’t sufficient income to bring
them under the tax, therefore the councils will be paying
a lot of taxation which isn’t legally chargeable. Then
either they will have to deduct the illegal tax from the
debenture-holder, and let him prove that he isn’t legally
chargeable and go through the slow process of recovering
the money ; or else the council must recover the money
itself. The Commissioners have made the various coun-
cil clerks responsible for the payment of the tax; if the
council won’t vote the amount, the clerk will either have
to pay it on his own responsibility by misappropriating
the funds and get into trouble, or else be liable to heavy
fine for failing in his duty as an unsalaried tax-collector.
Further, the councils want to know if they can’t be com-
pelled to pay their debenture-interest in full, especially
in cases where the debenture-holder doesn’t come under
the income-tax provisions? and if the case won’t be an
ordinary default, ending in a receiver being put in ?

It is practically decided that the long-postponed
Melb.-Collingwood railway will at last be built. The old
railway-builders brought lines from Heidelberg, Preston,
Whittfesea, and Shenley as far as Collingwood, and then,
instead of finishing the remaining two miles into Flinders-
street, they connected them via the dreadful Outer Circle
line with Spencer-street, a distance of about a dozen miles.
And ever since they have been wondering why these lines
didn’t pay. The only way to make them pay is obviously
to complete them, and Commissioner Mathieson has
harried the authorities about it till at last the experiment
is apparently to be tried. Another stump of a railway
breaks off ■short at Fitzroy, and the necessity of either
completing it or tearing it up and selling it for old iron
also sticks out conspicuously.

The Fourth Victoria Permanent Building Society
(Melbourne) shows a profit of t'3520 for the past year;
pays a 2 per cent, dividend (£1917), and adds £1603 to
reserve-fund, making it £4314. Last year the profits were
£2711, and there was no dividend. The year before, the
Fourth Victoria wrote off £28,113 of capital (equal to one-
fourth of the whole), and £5262 of reserves to cover depre-
ciation, therefore the present report shows a great
improvement.

The situation of the other banks and financial
institutions in Queensland with regard to the Q.N.
is peculiar. They want it to close that they may secure
its business—its Government business especially, the
Q.N. having little of any other kind that anybody would
envy. They don’t want it to close, for if its vast mass of
properties was put in the market it would make a slump
which would depreciate their securities and everything
else besides. They would like the State to prop it up to
avert the slump ; yet they wouldn’t like the State to do
so, for State interference means State audit more or less,
and the State audit system might spread. There is no
knowing what might happen if the State audit system
once got fairly started. The situation, in fact, is tied in
a hard knot every way.

That large and once-prosperous concern, the
Haymarket Building Society (Sydney) reports that things
are so far looking up that it has earned a net profit of £B6
for the past year. This represents about 3s. per cent,
per annum on capital, so it isn’t a very large affair to feel
glad about—at least, to feel unreasonably glad about.

The amalgamation of the National Mutual Life
Society and the Mutual of Victoria has been endorsed by
the policy-holders of both societies, and is now practically
accomplished. Now that this good work has been done,
the present should be as good a time as any for the
National Mutual to swear off that dubious item in its
balance-sheet, “ Deferred Instalments of Annual Pre-
miums on Policies in Force, £44,985.” There is room for
a whole lot of discussion about this item, and anyhow,
even supposing the balance of opinion to be that it is
allowable, it isn’t a very realisable asset, or one to be
specially proud of.

An Anglo-French syndicate offers to complete
the S.A. transcontinental railway, on condition it gets a
99 years’lease of an immense area of land —S.A. Parlia-
ment having definitely refused to part with the freehold.
It also proposes to employ white labor, to make its rails
at Port Augusta, and to extract the iron from the Flinders
Range. It sounds very well, but, judging by past sad ex-
periences, this is about how it would pan out: The co.
would raise the requisite money on debentures, and, so
long as its directors could have good times with the
debenture-money, it wouldn’t matter to them whether
the railway was built or not. Possibly there is no inten-
tion of building the line, but there must be a scheme of
some kind to furnish excuse for selling debentures. A lot
of local M’sP. would be appointed directors, so that they
would worry Parliament for “ concessions ” to keep the co.
and their salaries going. There would be a constant
demand for concessions. The work would either crawl
along slowly or not at all. There would be costly law-
proceedings and arbitrations, and rows in England about
the brutal injustice of the S.A. Parliament. If the line
was finished the State must buy it some day, after more
law-suits and arbitrations. Long before the 99 years was
up the co., by judicious squeezing of its tenants, would
raise a popular demand that the State should buy back its
lease, in order to release them from its tyranny. If the
year 1996 did find the lease and the syndicate still alive,
it would probably by that time have bought up the Legis-
lature, and would get a renewal till 2095. The land-grant-
foreign-syndicate-raihvay business, every time it has
been tried in Australia, has been a hopeless failure and a
disastrous loss inside of 12 years, and it should be left
alone always, under all circumstances.

The Sydney Harbour Collieries Co. has bought
land at Balmain, facing Iron Cove, and has let a contract
to sink two shafts to a depth of 2960 feet in search of coal.
There is reason to believe that coal will be found 2700 feet
down. The work of turning Sydney into a coal city and
disfiguring the beautiful harbor with coal and dross and
ashes and black dust and mullock-heaps starts immediately.
At present the N.S.W. coal-supply so far exceeds the
demand that coal is selling at the lowest prices on record,
and dividends are scarce, and wages are simply abject—
consequently the present is regarded as a good time for
tearing out more coal and making things still worse.
Private enterprise can’t sleep at night for fear it should
fail to tear all the coal out of the earth at once and sell it
for a song in a glutted market, and be thus betrayed into
leaving some of it for the use of future generations. The
new enterprise is mainly English, so that J. Bull’s mort-
gage on Australia still keeps moving. But no one expects
the cornstalk to dig even a decent-sized post-hole without
the assistance of British capital.

The Federal Building Society reports that it
has got on so far with its liquidation that the unpaid lia-
bilities now stand at only £144,000, while the book-value
of the remaining assets is £373,000. The society has now
paid 7s. in the it', and another Is. dividend is declared.
The final result may not reach 20s. in the £, but on the
figures it certainly ought to. Year before last the appar-
ent surplus of assets over liabilities was £253,000. Last
year it was £232,000. This year it is £229,000, so the
paper value of things still keeps up remarkably well. If
the surplus means anything at all, the Federal ought
never to have gone into liquidation, and only the most
execrable management could have sent it there.
The once prosperous Sydney Omnibus Co. goes
out of business at the end of this year. It has paid no
dividends since April, ’95, and its shares (15s. paid up) are
unsaleable at 3s. Five years ago they stood at 225., but
the depression killed them, and the proposed electric-tram
system in George-street caused rapid decomposition to
set in.

The Pinnacles (near Broken Hill), in which so
much cash has been lost, is to be started once more in
January if nothing goes wrong. Half-a-dozen men are at
present engaged cleaning the machinery, pumping plant,

nacles, is, at the expiration of labor suspension, to be
worked again with London capital. Poor capital!

The trials of the relative merits of the Hancock,
or percussion, and the May or plunge-action jigs, at
Broken Hill, have resulted in the compilation of figures
favorable to the plunger. Whereupon Captain Hancock
objects, and his barrackers object even more strenuously,
that the trial was not a fair one. The principal conten-
tion is that the British-mine people, on whose Hancock
mill the trial of the percussion-principle was made, would
not allow the sieves to be altered. Some time ago it was
stated in this column that the May plant was prepared
bv the B.H. Proprietary officers ; that was before the
trials took place. Fact probably is that professional
jealousy has a little to do with the matter. The Mays
are engineers, not metallurgists. Hancock and his
right-hand man, Greenway, are metallurgists. Conse-
quently, if the Hancock machine was adopted by the Pro-
prietary-well, Greenway would probably have been put
in to build and for a time run the machinery, which
would have hurt some people's feelings. This possibly
did not affect the result of the trials at all; it certainly,
however, gives the Hancock peoples complaints more
weight than they would have otherwise had. The
present writer said in the par. before alluded to that
May’s jigs would probably be found to do the cleaner
work, Hancock’s the more rapid. But on these trials
May’s are said to have excelled in both. Anyway, it is
not a very conclusive test of concentrating machines’
capacity to run them on one particular class of ore only.
Wallaroo and Moonta copper people have begun
work on the Balaclava copper-mine on the outskirts of
the B.H. district, with men imported from the Peninsula
mines.
B.H. South is getting in funds again, and once
more a div. is talked about—whether to induce share-
holders to hang on and resist the offers of the Howell
(Illawarra) people or not this writer doesn’t know. He
used to write with a lot of confidence about the South,
but is tired now ; hardly less tired than the shareholders.
The British is working in from the Junction
North on a good concentrating sulphide body. No mines,
bar the Junction and Junction North, have had better
recent developments.
Chairman Home tells Adelaide shareholders
in the Junction that they have entered into contracts for
the sale of ore which it is estimated will yield a profit of
±172,800 during the next nine months. A shilling monthly
div. will absorb t'45,000, and £17,500 will, it is proposed,
be put into machinery extensions. Concerning this
policy, consider Block 10. It tore out its richer ores in
just the same way, intending to devote some of the pro-
fits to the erection of machinery for the future treatment
of its poor stuff. But when the rich stuff was all gone
shareholders became utterly demoralised, and the com-
pany has had about the worst three years of any big
mine at Broken Hill. In fact, in the end it took a lot of
scraping and the sacrifice of an enormous dump of sul-
phides to furnish the moderate-sized plant which is now
running with only fair success. It’s like a man with a
pot of beef extract, a dry crust, and a tough job, who
spoons out the extract first on the plea that then he'll be
so strong that he will easily be able to get through on the
dry crust afterwards.

Corainba, N.S.W. : “ The manager of Taylor’s
Reward mine has been instructed to give no information
to the press either with regard to the working of the
mine or the return from the battery.” The public were
not long in finding out the various sums paid for this
mine, and will be sure to know how the present co. own-
ing it pull out on the deal.

The Homeward Bound case goes badly for
the jumpers, the N.S.W. Full Court ruling that two of
them had been guilty of misrepresentation, and had
fraudulently become possessed of the ground, and that
the others had participated in the fruits of that misrepre-
sentation. All the jumpers were declared trustees of the
co. to the full extent of their interests, and the co. is en-
titled to a reference to the Master-in-Equity to ascertain
the amount of damage it has suffered by reason of the
stoppage of the mine. The bad time of the co. extends
over three years. It paid £19,000 for the mine, spent
£16,000 in machinery, and all this trouble arose simply
because its agent, one F. De Courcy Browne, an ex-
warden and M.P. and now a mining expert in Westralia,
omitted to pay £5 rent, causing the lease to be cancelled.
Yet, in face of such cases as this, no attempt is ever made
to reform the law to make such jumping an impossibility.
Stated that there is to be a Privy Council appeal.

John Howell and Munday have both written
encouraging, but by no means sensational, reports of the
Overflow gold, silver, lead, and copper-mine. Some very
heavy talk has been done, chiefly by squatters, who sel-
dom interest themselves in mining save in an antagonistic
way, but when they do enthuse it is on the top note. The
mine wants plenty development to ascertain what is in it.
The squatters want water-jackets and lots of other plant.
Water-jackets are very fashionable, all on account of the
Cobar tributors. They will make a big spoon or spoil a
big horn with the Overflow.

A man on the spot asks some pertinent questions
re the over-boomed General Gordon mine, W.A. :
“Where is crushing No. 2 coming from? Why are they
giving £lOOO a year to Professor Krause instead of £5OO to
one of the most reliable mining managers of Australia?
How much of the working capital has gone down the
shafts? When are they going to crush ?’’ Why is it they
never publish reports from the manager ?
* * * *
Another big English co., with nearly .£200,000
capital, working an alleged gold-mine in Westralia, has
had a horrible night-mare—the Hit or Miss Proprietary,
near White Feather, formerly known as Hayes’ Find.
When some £35,009 of the working capital had been spent
the battery started to tell its story : 891 tons returned
BS9oz.—and the rest was as usual declared to be in the
tailings. Pro. Nicholas was cabled to report. Since that
clean-up another 300 tons have been crushed for less than
50oz. Not a word has been said about this. Perhaps
time is given Jay Bull to recover from the first shock.
The manager, a well-known Bendigo man, has resigned,
and if the directors act on his recommendation, they will
be satisfied with the first loss and shut up shop.

A well-known barracker for the General Gordon
swears that a first crushing, at the end of January, will
yield 2000 oz. from 400 tons. But why only 400 tons,
anyhow ?

The manager of the Boulder explains that the
rich assays of sulphides recently wired east were from
isolated patches of ore. The mines around the Boulder

the newspapers out there to lying about mines that good
shows continue the victims of it.

Over two years ago a strong syndicate was
formed at Broken Hill to find and work mines in Westra-
lia. One show at the Ninety-Mile was considered the
“daddy" of the lot prospected, and the Bushman's
United Co. was the result. The mine could not be sold,
and the effect of working the mine is the winding up of
the co.

Whispered by men having authority, and not
yet shrieked by W.A. wire-hummers, that a big develop-
ment for the better has taken place in Brown Hill mine.
When it is known to them it will be put as if no change
had occurred—that the mine was always rich, and that it
did not come on an almost barren ore body at 180 ft.
* * * *
“ The rich developments in the Queen Margaret
South mme, W.A., are so sensational that the ropes and
ladders are taken up every night.” The inference is that
the boss doesn’t want anyone to walk off with the mine.
If so, would it not be better and easier to put an iron door
on the shaft? However, this precaution will do for the
next sensational newspaper wire.

All the way from London—Bayley’s No. 2
South—“ Crushed 100 tons ; 290 z. of gold recovered,

tory milling.” Bayley’s shares are quoted in London at
2s. Never quoted here. Bull carries the child. London-
derries seem to have dropped right out of the market,
but Wealth of Nations are quoted at £l, and there are
only 200,000 of them.

From Kalgoorlie: “ Rumored that the Per-
severance mine is unable to declare all the gold turned
out in the lirst crushing, owing to the return being sensa-
tionally high.” How very considerate of the feelings of
shareholders ! So many poor returns from first crushings
in Westralia are concealed and manipulated, and share-
holders have survived the shock, that it is a pity the full
result of this one was not declared, if only to see how
shareholders would stand it.
* * * *
Let us all hope the manager of Queensland
Menzies’ mine, W.A., will try and keep a little ice under
his head. His last wire, posted on all the eastern ex-
changes, reads : “ Had to rough-clean boxes, which were
getting choked with amalgam.” But was the amalgam
itself clean ? If so, then he should have many thousand
ounces before the boxes showed signs of choking. If the
amalgam was dirty—and such are the chances—it should
have been so stated. It is not uncommon in Westralia,
what with manganese in the ore and manganese in the
water, to get ten times as much amalgam as gold.

S. F. Van Oss, in the course of a Nineteenth
Century article on Westralia, says the gold-mines are a
palpably unreliable investment. ' The formations are un-
certain and erratic, water and labor are scarce and ex-
pensive, the yields are spasmodic and can never be
depended upon. There are not ten reefs developed to a
depth of 200 ft., yet 70 millions have been sunk, whereof
the promoters have taken about 60 millions. When this
is all realised a collapse is inevitable in this region of
pocketty mines. By-the-bye, is not this the man who had
so much to do with the buying of thousands of Ivanhoe
shares, long before the richness of the mine was generally
known ?

Dr. Holtze, it is wired, has declared that the

The partial destruction OI Judge -Hodges,
through colliding with another cyclist at St.
Kilda (Melb.), raises the question whether
weighty,, elderly public servants should be allowed
to pedal into danger. A bikist is bound to come
croppers more or less otten, and his risk ot serious
injury is great or small, according to his age and
weight. The Governmant, paying its Judges a
handsome salary whether they work or lie dor-
mant in bandages, and, furthermore, being liable
for a huge pension in the event of a Judge being
permanently disabled, surely should have some
voice in this matter. Justice on wheels is one thing:
a nine-stone boy “scorcher” is another. The heavy
citizen is ten times more likely to break his leg
or neck than the lightweight with the bicycle
face (whose decease would, in most cases, be a
gain to humanity at large) therefore the Hodges
class of acrobat might fairly be brought within
the Act of Parliament which regulates public per-
formances.

Loch of yore had no right to accept a =£3ooo neck-

Dunoan, a Warrnambool young lady (Heaven for-
give her !) wished to bestow “ a screen of unique
design ” upon Lady Brassey, but this very
uncalled-for offering was checked by news that
“it is against the regulations for the Governor’s
wife to accept any presents.” Perhaps the regu-
lation means “any ordinary presents.” The
Bulletin hopes that Lady Brassey will not be
tempted with a coil of brilliants in a gorgeous
morocco case, such as dear Lady Loch carried

One of the Adelaide hospital doctors had a
bad experience in the witness-box. After telling
about the death of a patient from a certain opera-
tion, the case-book was placed before him ; it
showed four operations of that kind for the year
in question —all successful. Being asked where
the dead man came in, he admitted that he couldn’t
tell. Then, after another tale of a corpse, it tran-
spired that the report showed five cases of his
complaint in that particular corpse's year, all five
cured. Invited to locate this remains also, he stated
that it seemed likewise to be missing. Then,
being further invited to state the value of these old
hospital statistics which were used so freely to dis-
credit the new management, he said in effect that
he“dunno.” The inquiry adjourned just then,
and he walked out like a doctor in a dream.

which will probably be left unfinished. Tasmania

What the daily papers are pleased to call a
“ love romance ” was lately fished out of a creek
at Mordiallac (Vic.). The romance was quite
dead and very muddy, and there were 300 love-
letters, all from the same girl, in its pockets. It
seems that it left Scotland about 1873 to seek its
fortune in Australia, and promised to send for its

best girl and get married as soon as there was a
home ready. Then the poor, beery romance drank
steadily for 23 years, and in between its drunks it
wrote letters to the girl in Scotland, in which it
swore-off the drink with painful regularity. And
every month, or oftener, for three-and-twenty
years the girl in Scotland wrote back saying how
glad she was that her lover had at last given up
the drink, and pointing out that if he only kept
straight the long-expected home would soon be
ready and they might be happy after all. Finally
the romance, in his usual state of beer, wobbled
one night into a creek, and probably the dead
weight of the faithful girl’s letters helped to drown
it. As the home was no nearer being ready than
it was in ’73, this was, perhaps, as good a way out
of the difficulty as any other.

almost all policemen, when laying the old, stereo-
typed trap, mark coins in almost the same way,
and that not one or two but scores of such coins
are at present in innocent circulation. The
danger of this is obvious. If Ann Smith or Bill
Jones falls within police purview and be found in
possession of one of these coins the weaving of a
police web around her or him will be a work of
little trouble. When such coins are used to sheet
home a case, the court should satisfy itself that
the marked coin was marked for use on that par-
ticular occasion, and was not one of the fugitive
marked coins which come to the trader in the

in Melbourne. There was no-

hugged by a nice girl was beyond all the bench’s
experience ; in fact, the bench looked as if it
wouldn’t mind having been there itself.

(Sydney Address)—OXFOßD STREET, or GEORGE and MARKET STREETS,
peared in The Bulletin over the name of
“Sappho Smith” was written by the wife of a
Sydney doctor—the number of persons who, at
different times, obtained credit for part or the
whole of the late Miss Wildman’s clever letters
was legion. Miss Wildman was not alone in this
respect. The lady who now writes over the pen-
name of “ Cleo,” though her advent on this paper
is very recent, has already had her identity
jumped by a somewhat well-known Sydney woman
—possibly by half-a-dozen, but The Bulletin
knows of one, at all events. The occasion that
brought her to the surface was a death. A very
few hours after it occurred the aggressive female
in question arrived with that huge note-book
which marks the person whose contributions are
never inserted, and demanded to “ see the body ”
for purposes of society journalism. The Bulletin
regrets to hear that she was permitted to see the
body. And, in case she should be again heard of,
this paper hereby gives notice that no one con-
nected with it is in the habit of viewing bodies,
and any alleged Bulletin pressman or press-
woman who uses the name of this paper as a
means towards inspecting anybody’s deceased
relative had better be treated with ignominy or
any other article that may be handy.

(N.S.W.) :
And now, sir, you assure the committee on your oath
that you are Consul for Chili ?
Yes.
And you are Consul for six other countries ?
Yes.
And now, Mr. Consul, on the solemn obligation of an
oath, is it part of your duty as Consul to report to your
Governments on the magnificent, boundless resources that
Almighty God has vouchsafed to this colony?
Yes.
And do you think, from our great possibilities as a coal-
producing country second to none in the world, that we
shall be able to hold our own in the markets of the East if
sufficient facilities are afforded ?
Yes.
And then the Universe didn’t crack after all.

Dear Bulletin, —The public is repeatedly
bamboozled when its servants fall into disrepute.
Not many months back a Sydney policeman was
proved in court to have severely “dealt with” a
drunken person and fractured one of his limbs.
That trap’s old haunts knew him no more, and
you will excuse me for supposing that he obtained
a merited sack. A couple of days back I bumped
up against him, still in blue, and he explained
that after his trouble he had been quietly trans-
ferred to his present district. In this connection
it is interesting to note that several of the recently-
retired civil servants have already crept back to
Govt, positions, vide that most reliable authority,
the Government Gazette.— T.W.

In each of the three Govt, pilot schooners
in Port Phillip Bay there is a preponderance of
Scandinavians in the crew, while the galley is
managed by a Chinese cook. The preference of
the pilots for the yellow variety of Soyer is in one
or two cases attributed to the fact that the Cau-
casian “ doctor ” takes care to do the work he is
paid for and no more, whilst a Chow can be taken
ashore while the boat is berthed and made useful
privately at Govt, expense. Only one Govt,
billet in the land should be open to Chinamen—
the hangman’s—and that shouldn’t exist.

Melbourne is
the paradise of cy-
clists,from a Sydney
point of view.
Broad,' smooth
streets, almost level,
no loose metal, no
killing hills, and a
cooler climate make
it perfect both for
the machines and
the riders thereof.
Standing onPrince’s
Bridge on a recent
Sunday morning,
the writer saw what
he believes to be
thousands of bi-
cycles speeding
along in the direc-
tion of St. Kilda and
Brighton men,
women, boys and
girls, buoyant youth
and “wizened,
hoary age,” petti-
coats and pants, cor-
pulence and lean-
ness, on every con-
ceivable type of
machine, cutting
along as if several
devils were after
them on pacing
tandems or fours.
But one thing
struck our Sydney man as the height of gross in-
congruity, viz., an elderly gentleman pedalling
along in a very shiny top-hat. This must be one
of those hats which survived the “boom time.”
The man vyho goes out cycling in a top-hat pro-
bably has but one hat.
“ My invariable rule,” said a too-talkative
damsel in the precincts of Divorce Judge Simp-
son’s court the other day, “is to keep whatever
presents gentlemen make me under engagement.
A lady is legally entitled to retain them, and is
morally obliged to punish a gentleman in this
way. I’ve done so in four cases.”
J * * * ♦
A lady, just returned from Westralia, ex-
plains how it is that Sydney wives receive such
EXPLOSION .
DEJECTED ARTIST : “ I wonder which magazine I had better take these
sketches to? ”
HIS CHEERFUL FRIEND : “The powder magazine !”
pessimistic accounts from their husbands absent in
the Land of the Golden Fleece :
Why I know two different men —now in Perth—with
whose wives and families in Sydney I am well acquainted.
Both have married again, and living in tip-top style. One
of these husbands has been away nine months, and all he
has sent his wife here is £2. The other party hasn’t re-
ceived even that yet. Will I show them up ? It isn’t
worthwhile. When they get tired of their Coolgardie
ladies they will be sure to come back.
When a man has two wives dependent on him you
can’t improve things by sending him to gaol and
leaving them both out in the cold.
Any ardent Tottie who hankers after the
clingsome hug of salvation, likewise the kiss of
peace, might do worse than throw in her lot with the
Melb. Christian Assembly. The C.A. is a
quite old-fashioned sect, comprising a hundred
souls and a small mob of “adherents,” under the
guidance of Pastor X. All was going well
within this religious circle until lately, when
Brother Z. was found guilty of too much
Christian behaviour, and suspended from practice.
This Brother, according to the pastor, “ has a law-
ful wife and family living in Victoria, and he does
not keep her, but all the time he is running after
another woman, a single girl, kissing her and
hugging her in pretty well every corner.”
Smarting under a sense of having been thrown
out, Brother Z. recently convened a meet-
ing to enquire into Pastor X. and his
alleged larks. Various charges were hurled at the
boss saint. It was declared in open tabernacle
that a small boy had seen pastor kissing a
“ sister ” under dim religious circumstances. Fur-
thermore, the brother accused his shepherd,
firstly, of grabbing a small handbag from off a
“ sister’s ” lap in a railway-carriage, and, secondly,
of taking therefrom a piece of preserved ginger,
which he held up to view, crying “ Ginger for
pluck ! ” On top of this revelation he produced
two letters “ supposed ” to have been written by
other sisters who wanted to love their pastor
violently. Then some more brother rose, and
started to reveal domestic details, until several
ladies retired blushingly from the fray. Finally,
the enquiry broke up into fragments, and pastor
X. went home triumphant, with several devoted
spinsters in attendance.
Anyway, Pastor X. is an improvement upon
a previous leader of the sect, who was driven
out of the pulpit on a charge of not being
able to produce a marriage-certificate when called
upon. The evidence of the small boy is unreli-
able, and the letters said to have been written by
the two sisters are wrapped in doubt. Also the
significance of “ Ginger for pluck ” is question-
able. Therefore, The Bulletin advises Pastor
X. to continue his ministry as before, paying
particular attention to the welfare of the single
girl whom Brother Z. is alleged to have kissed
and hugged in pretty well every corner. Probably
there are still a few corners where she hasn’t been
hugged up to the present, and it seems to be some-
body’s duty to see that these corners are duly
attended to.
The pastor, by the way, says that he
forgives Brother Z. everything. “As for that
poor deluded implement of the arch-enemy
of souls, he (X.) feels that the Almighty love,
which will enable Judas to eventually be saved,
will also enfold the present mischief-maker.”
How comforting. The brother, of course, can’t
expect immediate salvation. As an implement of
the Old ’Un he will be required to wriggle on the
grill Below for a few million years or so. But
eventually, O eventually, even Brother Z. may
be brought back. How these Christians tempo-
rarily damn one another!
AT THE CROSSING OF WARRIGAL
CREEK.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Through the ranges an echo in vain you may
seek
That can rival the echo on Warrigal Creek,
Where the swart basalt mountain frowns rugged
and still
O’er the Crossing—where Warrigal Creek skirts
the hill.
There the sad mopokes wait till the evening stars
blink ;
There the little rock-wallabies hop for their
drink;
And there, whisper or warble whatever you may,
The Crossing re-echoes each word that you say.
But when stars shine above and the world is at
rest,
Folk will tell you the echo sounds loudest and
best;
So it fell yesternight that my sweetheart and I
Wandered off in the moonlight the echo to try.
When we reached the still Crossing, distinctly
each word
That we whispered each other re-echoed was heard;
’Twas a spot where we knew that no listeners
were nigh—
There were only the echo and Nelly and I.
That echo repeated : “ the — sweetest — and — best: '*
That echo bore witness : “ far — more — than — the —
rest! ”
Yet again—although never a word did we speak—
There was heard a faint echo on Warrigal Creek.
And the modest moon dropp’d ’neath the rim of
the sky,
And the leaves of the currajong stirr’d with a
sigh,
Whilst the darkening night hid the blush on
Nell’s cheek
As a kiss was re-echoed on Warrigal Creek !

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Dec. 22, 1896.
Mr Dear Myee—
Weekly shivoos have been held at the Victoria
Club in Phillip-street until last Friday, which was
the end of the season, and the club goes into
seclusion for the summer months. The entertain-
ments have been of the mildly-musical order, songs
and recitations. There was also an evening re-
union last week, when lightning-sketches were a
feature ; a lady artist fondly traced the manly
beauty of Kyrle Bellew—not including his bandy
legs—on the blackboard, and observers sighed in
admiration. Two hostesses provide refreshments,
and there is always a disposition on the part of
guests to be stand-offish and refuse to drink tea
supplied by a hostess with whom they are not on
calling terms. With these little thorns of etiquette
some women love to stuff the cushion of life. All
members dress ceremoniously for the function.
The club wants some strong, vulgar person to get
in and make a startling speech and shake the
whole thing up into more life. Like the guests at
David Copperfield s first dinner-party, “ they
would all get on a great deal better if they were
not so genteel.”
The Town Hall was lively-looking on Wednes-
day evening when the Liedertafel concert was
given. The “Revenge Cantata” was very well
sung, and the man at the big-drum banged for all
he was worth. It’s rather a mistake to print
words of part songs on the programme, because the
absurdity of a body of about 100 men, most of
them bald and married, chanting passionate
strains to some “little youthful maiden” and
beseeching her to come into its collective “great
heart,” is glaringly apparent. Miss E. King, in
a pink dress, sang charmingly. The audience was
the average prosaic Liedertafel one which always
looks as if it had risen hastily from a meat-tea in
the remoter suburbs,__ wrapped its head in a
woollen “cloud,” and come forth with the firm
determination of getting its money’s worth out of
the annual subscription.
The Palace Theatre opening on Saturday night
was attended by that wild and frantic demand for
seats and scampering up and down of distracted
ushers which mark a popular boom. Full dress
decorated the stalls as well as the dress circle,
which has a well-like depth from back to front,
and the gallery is lost somewhere in the heights of
the “mooned dome aloft.” The little building is
so Oriental that it is like the “ Thousand and One
Nights” condensed into a single paragraph.
There are effects of “ fretted gold ” and “ broad-
based flights of marble stairs ” and all the splen-
dor and havoc of the East, and if you saw houris
and caliphs and hookahs and agas among the
audience it would seem quite natural. Above the
proscenium there is a brazen image of Buddha
sitting holding the sacred lotus, which flower is
used as a pattern for much of the glittering deco-
ration. For its size it is, I should think, just
about the prettiest music-hall in the world.
The curtain, said to have cost hundreds, deserves
a par. to itself. Peacock-blue plush is the ground-
work, glorified with much embroidery of gold and
silver braid worked into the lotus pattern. A
first-night audience applauded in a puzzled sort of
way at each turn of an average music-hall pro-
gramme. Australian audiences haven’t yet got
accustomed to that type of entertainment where
nobody is expected to sit primly from beginning
to end of the show and criticise each item
seriously. Knowles, Harry Lee and his large
spotty dog were the stars of the evening.
More and more one notices at the Xmas break-
ing-up parties how beautifully Australian girls
dance. I don’t mean the grown-ups, for they
sometimes get lazy and lose their spring, but the
little fairies of 10 or 12—clad in snowy-white frocks,
with long, thin legs in white silk stockings and
satin shoes—who clasp each other and spin round
in innocent gyrations, “ Betsy Jane with Betsy
Ann.” They do “butterfly” dances and “fan”
dances and “minuets” and “cotillions,” with a
sweet seriousness on their little faces as if their
steps were the most momentous they were ever to
take. They have very proper and correct ideas of
ball-room manners, too, and only dance with boys
who have been introduced. The well-meaning
but mistaken adult invited to help make the party
“go off,” is often reduced to limp flabbiness after
being chillingly snubbed by one tiny mite after
another whom he has dared to approach without
a formal presentation.
A mild flare-up occurred in military circles in a
sea port lately owing to the captain’s wife sending
out the orderly to the local chemist’s for three-
penn’orth of rouge to enable her to “make up”
for a toney ball, whereby the manly dignity of
the soldier was outraged, and he used bad lan-
guage and was consequently reproved from head-
quarters. Which reminds me that Australian
women are putting up a world’s record for “ mak-
ing-up,” and badly at that. Globe-trotting
Englishmen invariably notice the brightening in
color of hair with decreasing latitude overland
from Melbourne to Sydney. Waitresses on the
Vic. side are brown-haired, occasionally bronzed
with a little peroxide perhaps. On the Murray
the golden-haired zone is entered. Albury waitress
girls’ heads positively glitter, and nearly every
girl in Sydney sports straw-colored locks. Arti-
ficial bleaching produces a deadly pallid effect
which must be rectified with dabs of rouge. “If
they would only do it intelligently,” wailed a
fashionable hairdresser from whom I sought infor-
mation on this subject, “they would be improved
20 percent., but they don’t apply the powder-puff
and haresfoot with any discrimination.”
A high-toned Anglican church in a far-away
city burst forth into alleged “frolics” early this
month, with, of course, the usual eye to. the
“ gate.” Some of the revels were mildly hilarious,
including a tall and much-worshipped curate
giving threepenny donkey-rides to the children
inside the Sunday-school, and much afternoon
tea-drinking; all the doings were freely snap-
shotted with the same cleric well in the picture
every time. But a daring innovation on
the part of a well-known doctor’s daughter, assisted
by a youth of original ideas, was hiring an ice-
cream cart and doing a roaring trade as they drove
through the streets on the way to the orgies.
Some of the best-dressed women are lamenting
the departure of their favorite clothes-artist.
Tempted by filthy lucre, she has left for another
city and a higher-salaried appointment. And her
clients mourn that her hand and brain will no
longer plan for them sensational confections. The
modiste is a tall, showy woman herself, and,
dressed up to fashion-plate ideals, has always
been much observed at Randwick and other dress
parades.
An out-of-the-common wedding happened at
Parramatta on Wednesday last in St. John’s
Church, when Mr. Cecil Champion, of Harris
Park, wedded Miss E. Byrnes. In the gaslight
the bridal smiles and tears were artistically toned
down, and the dresses showed up twice as well as
in the garish glare of day. Rose-petals were sent
fluttering down from the gallery upon the heads
of the intrepid couple, and by way of a brilliant
novelty the choir sang the “ Voice that Breathed ”
as the knot was tying.
A concert was given on Monday night by pupils
of Mine. Charbonnet - Kellermann, and the
Y.M.C.A. hall was crowded. Children’s music
has been the subject of some interest lately, as
some of the infant performers are so brainy that
they had to be classed as seniors in the recent
exams., although their tiny fists can’t yet grapple
with an octave. It is quite astounding to see these
babies, their leglets yards too short for pedal-
reach, and hardly long enough to reach the floor
when the infant stands on its feet, rattling up and
down the keyboard in sonatas, and fugues,
and ops., or struggling valiantly with misfit
violins several sizes too large for them. A
son of H. Poussard glided easily over the difficul-
ties of a “Gondolied.” Otto Phillip, a tough
veteran of ten or eleven, repeated one of his many
Serformances of a classical violin piece. Frieda
Idler was the star pianist, and baby M‘Bride,
who had to be lifted on to the stool, played a per-
fect staggerer of difficulty. A child in blue
paniers and powdered hair acted Lady Teazle
most quaintly, and managed her fan and train
adroitly to a pink-clad Sir Peter with a childish
treble.
As the folks from wayback stroll along the
Block, at this holiday season, their fashions are
reminiscent and bring back modes of the year
before last. Innocent of “ godets ” or “fibre
chamois,” skirts cling to their wearers’ forms as in
the days of “sheaths”; and the most casual glance
at the style of hair-dressing shows that the netted-
“ bun ” is dying hard, and still lingers in Thargo-
mindah and Tumbulgum, and maintains a pre-
carious existence at Gobarralong. The men “do
the toff,” and a clean shave reveals a vast patch of
white skin against the sunburnt surrounding
expanse of face, and they curtail their already
curtailed pants by turning them up at the hem
unconvincingly.
The recent exhibition of children’s needlework,
at Govt. House, was rather a frost from the exhi-
bition point of view. Invited by Lady Hamp-
den to show samples of sewing, the children put
forth their best efforts, and the teachers had to go
to some trouble and expense to get the work ready
for show. They received a vice-regal command to
attend at Govt. House and hear the report of the
exam., when they were consolingly till, per
imported representative of the Needlework Guild,
that the “colonial ” work very nearly approached
in excellence that done by English children. Also
if they continued in the right path and didn’t
grow weary in well-doing, the young exhibitors
might expect some prizes next year. No gifts
this time ; the delirious joy of being considered
nearly as good as ’Ome needleworkers is quite
enough for one year.
A small boy had a little adventure one night re-
cently in a stuccoed Toorak mans''on, of which he
has the run. Bribed by the eldest girl’s young
man to place a letter under her pillow, the minute
go-between got into the wrong bedroom, and put
the tender document under the wrong pillow.
Then he just managed to hide under the bed in
time to escape the watchful eye of Ma, who went
innocently to sleep and snored above the mis-
placed document and the equally misplaced mes-
senger. The plucky little chap waited all night
until the room was vacant next morning, and then
he recovered the missive and delivered it all right.
It resulted in an elopement, and nobody except the
principals suspected the small friend of any part in
it.
A fashionable charity confab was lately broken
up by an open quarrel between two of the Nicest.
One lady refused to sit on the committee because
another not in No. l’s “ set ” had been appointed
a member. Then the two belligerent dames, with
great heat and excitement, proceeded to turn over
each other’s antecedents with a muck-rake, only
stopping short of actual blows. Judging by each
one’s description of the other, that charity organi-
sation is a very bad lot indeed.
Sydney Rowing Club gave a moonlight concert
at the branch - shed at Abbotsford on Thurs-
day night. The “ Lady Manning ” was
crowded with the party, which was enlivened
by a persevering band not to be daunted by the
hooting steam whistle yelling for the bridge to be
opened. The president gave the prizes won at the
last regatta, then some ballads warbled, and one
performer came out strong and gave several comic
songs. There were also refreshments and every-
body seemed to have a good time.
The largest Xmas tree ever shown here was
exhibited at the German church in Goulburn-
street on Sunday night, where wildly-hilarious
revels were held and worship in an up-to-date
form was celebrated, including the distribution of
presents “ made in Germany,” songs, recitations,
and other worries. The Teuton’s idea of keeping
up Xmas is to get as far away from Germany as
ever he can—the farther the better—surround him-
self with old-world associations, and talk much
sentiment about the Dear Old Fatherland, to
which he never wants to go back. The gift-dis-
tribution idea is a good one to keep up a failing
congregation.
The school-concert pianist, much in evidence
just now, is often a study in ungracefulness. As
she trots blushingly to the piano and nervously
tucks her skirts under her, she dives sideways at
the audience and clutches at the piano-stool,
which action pulls her dress tight on that side,
and, as she works the pedal, makes her look like
a bicycliste in bloomers. If she were a little
more self-possessed she would glide gracefully to
the instrument and, grabbing the stool on the
off-side, present a full sweep of skirt to the eyes of
the onlookers.
Paling and Co. have bestowed a boon on a
public which is haunted by the new melody
ground out by the automatic nigger at the steam
riding-gallery at Manly, by publishing it as “ The
Washington Post ” waltz in their Xmas annual*
It is one of those tunes as catching as an epidemic,
which stage it has already reached in Amurka.
“ Banjo ” Paterson and R. Goring-Thomas per-
petuate the historic “Nicest People ” phrase m a
song in the same up-to-date collection, and several
other lively songs and dances adorn the book.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ A point that amused many at the Melbourne
children’s dancing-shows—that dreary carnival of
Whirling Skirts which comes with every Xmas—
was the eagerness to play ‘ God Save the Queen ’
for the arri val of the Govt. House party. In one
instance it was started about half-a-dozen times—
false alarms, all of them. There is no imperial
authority for hailing Lady B. with the National
Anthem, but the heartrending melody gets there
all the same.
“ The best amateur violinist in Melb. is Dr.
Lazarus, who was a favorite pupil of the great
Johannes Woolfe. Dr. L.’s wife, formerly a Miss
Gollan, divides the honor of being the handsomest
Jewess in Melb. with Mrs. Isaacs. She is of a
very fine Oriental type, with splendid coloring.
Dr. and Mrs. L. leave their gorgeous stucco man-
sion on the Orrong Road early next month to re-
side permanently in the fog and grey atmosphere
of the Big Smoke. Melb. sassiety folk lose thereby
a couple of their most generous entertainers.
“The conversazione given by the trustees of the
National Gallery on Friday evening eventuated
very brilliantly. The occasion was the exhibition
of students’ work for the year and the awarding of
the prizes. This function has, up to now, always
taken place drearily in the afternoon, and tne
change to the evening was a distinct success.
Melb. smart folk, who always rush a free show
eagerly, turned up festively attired in the
now rather damaged finery of a declining
season. Lady Brassey, in black moirt an-
tique, wore some magnificent jewellery. Be-
sides embellishing her well-accentuated neck
with a collar of large diamonds, she further
added a gold serpent studded with turquoises and
diamonds, and the front ot her gown was like to a
jeweller’s show-case. The petite wife of a gaunt
professor displayed much white shoulder and arm
in a bodice built on Potteresque lines. Mrs. Ber-
nard Hall was in black, and the wife of a gallery
instructor attired herself weirdly in one of those
shapeless, colorless velvet gowns in which would-
be aesthetic folk love to upholster themselves to
the utter bewilderment of the average Philistine.
There are some amongst the female students this
year who have pretensions to beauty, generally a
rare gift among women artists. One girl with
Rubens-red hair and a rose-leaf complexion is
called ‘ Venus ’ by her fellow-students, who love
to try to catch her tints on canvas ; and a tall,
graceful, grey-eyed girl, known as ‘ Trilby,’ is
perhaps the handsomest of the lot.
“ Coates’success was most popular ‘ up at the
gallery,’ and his was a sort of Newhaven victory
over other competitors for the scholarship, though
the youth whom the body of students believe to
be the cleverest artist among them did not com-
pete. Becoming impatient at the repeated criti-
cism of the instructors, the student blocked out
the whole of his picture at the last moment. The
work of a lady student who has since gained a
South Kensington prize supplied the comedy
element to the exhibition, the weird perspective
and strange arrangement of light making the
picture a wholly original outbreak of unconscious
humor.
“Melb. women, it would seem, are the most
superstitious and gullible in Australia. In Melb.
flourish more ‘palmists,’ ‘futurists’ and
‘spirit mediums’ than anywhere else in these
provinces, though Sydney conies in a good second.
And the gulls who enrich these sharks are women
who belong to the so-called ‘higher-class.’ One
suburban medium, whose crude methods of decep-
tion have been exposed over and over again, cannot
give ‘sittings’ to more than half the enquirers
who would gain revelations from the ‘Seven
Heavens ’ which this astute woman has invented
on her own, for the accommodation of the spirits
of her clients’ relatives. This ‘ medium ’ sits from
9 a.m. till midnight, and, though her charges are
as high as half-a-guinea, she is besieged at all
hours by women who eagerly swallow the absurd
clap-trap she ladles out to them. A half-crown
‘ palmist ’ is shortly to retire from the business,
having accumulated a fortune after a few years’
practice up a back-street in a squalid neighbor-
hood.”
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
Probably the most grotesque of all the
grotesque magisterial exhibitions in the matter of
suicide was open at a Sydney police-court one
day last week. A silly woman was brought up
charged with drinking poison. She had quar-
relled with her husband and wanted to scare him,
and the husband kindly stood up and said he had
a quarrelsome nature and he wanted to take the
blame on himself. Then the Bench, in the person
of Addison, S.M., said that “suicides were be-
coming far too frequent,” and the silly woman
must do seven days’ imprisonment—Addison being
apparently an ignorant person who doesn’t know
that suicide is a matter of statistics; and de-
pends, not on the individual, but on race, and
age, and climate, and crops, and a lot of other
things ; and that it is about as sensible to sentence
silly women to seven days for attempted suicide
as it would be to sentence Addison to seven years
for softening of the brain—supposing he had
softening of the brain. Anyhow, the silly woman
got seven days. Then a solicitor named Gannon
begged to interpose, and suggested that a fine
would meet the case, and the Bench acknowledged
itself an ass by altering its decision to a fine of
£2. Then another solicitor named Abigail begged
to interpose some more, and suggested that “ in
view of the presence of the Christmas season ” (!)
a still lighter penalty would do, and the Bench
decided that suicide was partially allowable at
Christmas, and wrote itself down some more
of an ass by altering its decision again—
this time to six hours’ imprisonment. The Bench,
it will be observed, knows its own mind so
admirably that it complacently alters its dole of
alleged justice twice at the bidding of a senti-
mental attorney. Why not have sentences drawn
from a barrel, same as Tattersall’s sweeps ?
During the year 1896 three successive
doctors to the Leichhardt Female Rechabite Tent,
Sydney, died.
Wellington (M.L.) has at present a larger
wholesale and retail shop than usual, and is calling
it an Exhibition. There is no more in the exhibi-
tion than can be-seen in the business places of the
town, and not as much as can be seen in some big
emporiums in Sydney any day of the week. How-
ever, the inhabitants of Wellington have by hard
thinking come to persuade themselves that it is a
great sight entirely, and crowd the building on the
reclaimed land night after night, and concerts
given with more or less success—especially less—
help people to forget remote troubles in the pre-
sence of those which are immediate.
Time deals gently with the woman who
uses “ Babeskin ” soap. It softly removes the
tell-tale lines of the years, and renews the delicate
bloom of youth. One shilling packages of two
cakes. All chemists.*
I Brisbane (Q.) is now “ expecting another
flood in January or February, the superstition
being that the big floods come every three years,
and “time’s up.” The impressions of the last
one are still visible in numbers of empty shops
and houses in the parts subject to inundation,
especially in South Brisbane. Yet no one ever
hears any talk now about a high-level or a suspen-
sion bridge. The new bridge, half completed (half
in width) is a gorgeous-looking affair, tied to-
gether overhead and underway with almost a
filagree of iron or steel trusses, but it's only a foot
or so higher than the last, and when the houses
and the floating forests come down against it
again, it will go, as sure as Death.
The private enterprise railway of Nathaniel
Levi, M.L.C. (Vic.), has gone bung. Many years
ago Levi obtained permission to build a line from
Kilcunda to Cape Patterson in order to develop
certain coal deposits, and open up the country,
and do other beautiful things. The term expired
without Levi doing anything, and the concession
was renewed. It was renewed five times in all,
and each time Levi was just about to commence.
It expired again the other day, and member T.
Smith started to introduce the customary Bill,
but this time the House rose up in its long-bottled
wrath and said, in effect, that Levi, M.L.C., was
an old, unpractical bore, so Nathaniel’s railway is
gone.
The Q. pearlshell fishery law (at the time
of writing in process of amendment), whether
amended or not is a fine illustration of legislative
wisdom. The law says that the inner measure-
ment of each shell removed must not be less than
so much (it was six inches, and it is now proposed
to make it five inches). Now, some shells are
thicker than others, just as some men’s skulls are
thicker than others. A shell not measuring so
much is not to be removed. But, in order to
measure it, to see whether it is within the limit or
not, it has not only to be removed, but opened.
Being opened, if it is under the limit, it is contra-
band. Being opened, it is also dead and useless.
The law requires the pearlfisher, then, to throw it
away. Not being a fool, he naturally doesn’t.
At Carlton (Melb.) court the other week,
an indignant honorary magistrate recorded a
solemn protest agai nst the leniency of his worship-
ful brethren. They had let off the culprit in an
“indecency” case with a mere 18 months’hard
labor, whereas the dissenting justice—Councillor
levers —thought that the miserable sinner “ ought
to have been flogged.” A Bulletin correspondent
instances the protest aforesaid as proof that the
Lormer Board’s provisions for the regulation of
the Vic. honorary magistracy are totally in-
adequate “on the showing of one of their own
number.” He (the correspondent) expects this
truculent journal to shriek for an enquiry into the
scandalous conduct of the man who voted for a
sentence of 18 months’ hard labor. In the mean-
time, however, The Bulletin prefers to snort at
the would-be flogger.
It is alleged by a daily paper that “it has
not yet been decided whether there shall be a
formal unveiling” of Governor Phillip’s statue in
the Sydney Garden Palace Grounds. A splendid
opportunity will be missed if this is true. There
are several gentlemen who are admirably adapted
by nature and temperament to make appropriate
remarks on the occasion of the unveiling of the
statue of “our first gaoler.’ For instance,
Minister for Justice Gould has super-eminent
claims ; and ex-Minister for Justice Heydon is a
strong runner up. A slight postponement would
enable ex-Judge Windeyer to return for the
occasion; G. Republican Dibbs might do in the
intervals of presenting addresses at theatrical
benefits ; and, as a last resource, ex-Sheriff
Cowper might be prevailed upon to make a few
well-chosen remarks while Nosey Bob pulls the
official string and unveils the figure.
Melbourne supplies a quaint tale of a
family quarrel. Thomas Hannen and the woman
that he was not married to disagreed about a £5
note which he was unable to return because part
of it had gone in drink. Thomas went to sleep on
the sofa, but presently woke to find himself
covered with kerosene and blazing cheerfully. He
rose and extinguished himself, and then philoso-
phically went to sleep again. Some little time
afterwards he woke to find that he had been kero-
sened again, and that his head and beard were
flaring up vigorously. This time he grew irritated
and after extinguishing himself a second time he
went out and complained to the police, who
arrested the lady on suspicion. As he hasn’t
blazed up in his sleep since she was locked up, tue
presumption is that she did it, and that she in-
tended to consume. Thomas to ashes on the sofa.
Anyhow, the event is regarded locally as an affect-
ing episode.

Melb. : ‘ ‘ The actual firm of Dombey and
Son has just established a branch here.”
A son of a prominent Australian baronet
is employed cleaning bicycles in a Melb. cycle
shop.
“ The Vagabond’s ” grave is to have a
monument, from Victorian admirers of his pen-
work.
Archbishop Carr is said, in high R.C.
circles, to be on the imminent edge of a car-
dmalate.
In the light of recent criticisms and de-
velopments a certain Q. politician now at ’Ome
intends to get well very slowly indeed.
The late general manager of a very sick
institution left his widow an annuity of £BOO a
year. And, ye gods, what did he leave the bank !
Louis Becke’s projected South Pacific
trading enterprise has received a check by the
Phillippines revolutionary affair. At latest lie was
working with his pen at Deal, “ spending his spare
time fishing and swearing at the climate.”
Q. Governor Lamington has confessed
publicly that it is for him “almost an impossi-
bility ” to concentrate what he thinks is his mind
on any one subject at one time. His intellect, it
seems, scatters all over the place and is never
there when it is wanted.
An Australian dentist is noted for his phiz.
At an inland town, professionally visited, one of
the local dead-beats, after lengthened glances, said
to him confidentially: “By Jove, old man, no
offence, but I’ve seen faces like yours after taking
blue-gum mixture for a week.”
A. Catt, Chairman of Committees in the
S.A. Assembly, will be 63 on Monday (Dec. 19).
He was elected to Parliament in 1881, and since
then has drawn .£lOOO a year as Minister of the
Crown for five years, and £4OO per annum as
Chairman of Committees for seven years.
The fact that Vic. Attorney-General
Isaacs drafted and introduced the Usury Bill,
under which the maximum interest is 10 per cent.,
makes the Melb. synagogue rave exceedingly.
The spectacle of Isaac thus rounding on Moses is
a painful instance of dissension among brethren.
Alfred Saunders, the alleged Nestor of
Maori I and House of Reps., was among the lost at
the late election. Old, well-meaning Saunders
was called a Nestor so often that at last lie began
to live up to the character, and habitually stalked
about the precincts of the House absorbed in
alleged thought, with his head bowed down, and
his hands clasped behind his back, and his over-
whelming white beard surging over his chest. The
patriarch was ejected chiefly for looking so muoh
wiser than any one man really could be that the
country could li t stand his overwhelmingness any
longer. J
Poor old Thomas
M ‘ll wraith, according
the cablegrammer, is
“slowly improving.”
He has been slowly
improving, according
to the same authority,
for two years past, and
apparently he is only
improving into his
grave. He can hard-
ly walk at all, and
the cable-man states
that he “wishes to re-
cover the use of his
hands.” This fact was
probably sent out lest
Australians should
th ink that he didn’t
want to recover the
use of his hands ; the
cable person is dread-
fully particular about
details. M‘llwraith,
however, isn’t much
of a news subject now-
adays ; the pathetic
wreck of what used
to be Queensland’s
Strong Man hardly
casts a shadow on
local politics these
times.
The return of H.
Smith Fish to M.L.
Parliament is a proof
that virtue is reward-
ed in the long run.
The first blood of the
political campaign was
shed from Fish’s nose
on Fish’s own door-
step, a too-enthusias-
tic * democrat having
called round and
whacked the violent
old man in the centre
of the countenance.
Now the blood of the
martyr has risen up
from Fish’s doorstep and extinguished his oppo-
nents hopelessly at the polls. Years ago Minister
Mackenzie missed Fish with a pickle-bottle in a
hotel, and now that these two enemies—both hard
men with long memories—are going to meet again
in the Parliamentary refreshment-room, the bill
for broken crockery should be interesting reading.
Working at White Feather (W.A.) is an
old German miner locally known as Charley.
Twelve months ago Charley travelled overland
from Norinanton (North Queensland) via Fowler’s
Bay and Eucla to Coolgardie. From Fowler’s
Bay (S. A.) the journey was performed on foot and
alone, the ancient Teuton’s equipment consisting
of a two-gallon water-bag and such tucker as he
could carry in his swag. When he arrived at
Panton’s station on the Bight Charley ravenously
devoured a leg of mutton which was being cooked
for dinner. Next morning he walked back 30
miles for his swag which he had left on the track.
And the unobtrusive, guttural wanderer has never
once been mentioned as a “ Great Australian ex-
plorer.”
How the family names run ! Extract from
a report of a Brisbane (Q.) Full Court case last
week : —“ Mr. Edouin Lilley, with him Mr.
Arthur Lilley (instructed by Mr. Charles Lilley,
as agent for Mr. A. M. Lilley, of Toowoomba),
appeared for the applicant.” All relatives of the
ex-Chief-Justice.
Nearly all the old Sydney identities—
“ Abby Dabby,” “ Garden Honey,” “Paddy the
Ram, ” Parkes and the rest--have been taken by
death within the last half-dozen years. In accor-
dance with the fitness of things in Botany Bay
“Nosey Bob” is about the only really notable
character who survives.
American papers report that Sankey, the
man who used to grind out the hymn for the old
firm of Moody and Sankey, having gone broko in
his old age, has gone back to revivalism and isn’t
making expenses at the game. Moody bought
land with his share of the loot, and is booming.
Also the two old partners have established a life-
long feud, and hate each other just like two
hardened sinners.
It is a small matter, but it is just as well
to state, in reference to a paragraph in the Free-
man’s Journal, that the first woman’s letter in
The Bulletin signed “Sappho Smith” was not
“ written by a young lady, now the wife of a Sydney
doctor.” The late Miss Wildman was the only
lady who ever wrote for The Bulletin under the
pen-name of “ Sappho Smith.”
One of the pioneers of the Zeehan
mines, aged 00, rheumatic and generally frozen
out, is now alleged to lead a precarious exist-
ence in boilers and other makeshift residences
close to the scene of his great silver find. There
is much sameness about the story of the pioneer.
He makes the find. Then one Cohen comes along
and exploits it. Then the old explorer is run in
for sleeping in a tank on Cohen’s allotment.
Melbourne now has an undertaker who is
an ordained minister, and on occasion reads the
burial service over his corpses. Also, it would
strike a corpseing person of any imagination that
when the Rev. Crape called in to administer reli-
gious consolation he could hardly help running
liis eye over the about-to-be-deceased to size up
the material needed for his wooden overcoat.
Beautiful stories of a Southern softgoods
magnate, recently burnt out ; are going the rounds
again. The magnate, as a pietist, looks for ardent
Kerristianity from his employes, and a man seek-
ing admission to the “slops” fold muoh betters
his chances by playing the religious ticket. Some
years ago an applicant for the billet of traveller
was adopting quite an ordinary, worldly tone,
until the softgoodsman took exception to his lack
of size. He didn’t carry a sufficiently important
appearance, the boss thought. Then the billet-
seeker had a Scriptural inspiration, as it were.
“Mr. ,” he said, “my height is not a real
objection. St. Paul was only a little man, but he
was a great power for good. ” The admiring slops
manufacturer engaged Paul secundus without
more ado.
BROTHERS IN MISFORTUNE.
FIRST : “ Say. old man, lend me a couple of quid till to-morrow."
SECOND : “ Can't, old man—the wife’s just touched me for a fiver to get me
a Christmas-box.”
FIRST : “ Great Scott! so's mine!”
Mr. Tom Roberts has resigned the presi-
dentship of N.S.W. Society of Artists—owing to
Mr. Julian Ashton, a member of N.S. Wales
National Gallery trust, having been elected to a
seat on the committee of the society named. Mr.
Roberts is quite right in contending that the
positions of National Gallery trustee (in which
the holder takes part in buying pictures
for the State) and Art Society commit-
teeman (in which the same person takes part
in selling and promoting the sale of pictures
to the State) are quite irreconcilable ; also that
“ the difficulty is increased when the same gentle-
man is head of a considerable school for the train-
ing of artists, and still further by the fact that
there exists another body—the Art Society of
N.S.W.—which also holds classes and exhibitions,
and makes its very proper claim upon the atten-
tion of the National Gallery trustees, who are
almost the only purchasers of Australian works of
art in the province.” These things were urged by
The Bulletin long ago ; why they haven’t more
forcibly struck the community is a mystery.
Q. Speaker Cowley is an insignificant
shrimp of a man, as seen outside in his store
clothes. No one would look twioe at him for
“prospects.” But, in the chair, with robes on,
and so long as he remains seated, he looks bigger.
Which would seem to indicate that his back is
longer than his legs, and that nature intended him
for lumping bags of potatoes. His face, in profile,
is singularly attractive and indicative of bright
talent, while his enunciation is clear and distinct
—although he does call the sea-slug “ beach-de-
nier.”
A VICTIM OF DISASTER.
PURCHASER : “ You said this horse had no faults — why, he’s blind!"
VENDOR : “ That’s not his fault; it’s his misfortune.”
A W.A. mining expert, accused of
drought, obtains the following certificate from
publicans in outlying districts to satisfy his
clients they have had a run for their money :
This is to certify that Mr. has not taken a drink of
anything stronger than soda at my hotel for one month.
It is a lithographed document, and the publican,
having signed it and filled in the date, it is pinned
on to the report as a proof that the latter is eon-
cei ved in a strictly sober spirit.
John Hutcheson, the ship-rigger and ex-
sailor who headed the poll for Wellington City
(M.L.) with Robert Stout a bad second, didn’t
give way to undue inflation over his new glory.
Three days after the election the new M.H.R.
tramped down Wellington’s principal street in his
working clothes, with half a bale of rope over his
shoulder, on his way to do some rigging. There
isn’t much of the triumphal-arch business about
Hutcheson.
“ Harwood,” suspected of the murders of
Lee Weller and Preston, was indeed most unhappy
in his choice of aliases. The sinister associations
of the name “ Butler” have already been pointed
out, but what shall be said of “Burgess,” another
name of his? Burgess, it will be remembered,
was the M.L. criminal hanged with Levy and
Kelly for the series of Maungatapu murders, in
their way as cold-blooded and mercenary as those
of Glenbrook.
This is how the Nocent Waterspout of
N.S.W. oommenced his famous Trafalgar-day
letter to London Telegraph :
A native of England, but for over 40 years a citizen of
“ Greater Britain,” I write to thank you for the golden
eloquence of your noble article on the “ mighty seadord,”
and “ that splendid fatal day,” which, with “ justified
patriotism,” is now commemorated.
Then about two dozen more adjectives follow, and
all these garish figures of speech rush down a
■teep place until they bring up with a shock against
the signature : “ J. C. Neild, Major, commanding
St. George’s Rifles, New South Wales, 74 St.
Ermin’s-Mansions, Westminster.”
Armand Jerome, the Sydney disappearance
man, sentenced to three years for forgery, alleged,
in his plea for mercy, that the beginning of his
troubles was a desire to make a name for himself
in literature. Jerome oertainly had the literary
yearning very badly—a misplaced ambition, for he
had not a speck of the literary faculty. He might
easily have made an ideal canvasser, bagman, in-
surance agent, patent agent, company promoter,
perpetrator of boom prospectuses —in fact, he could
have shone in quite a number of the more gaudy
forms of commercial razzle-dazzle—and his desire
to be some kind of a man of letters only led to
pathetic failure.
Barwon Murray writes to The Bulletin :
The other day, there died on the Barwon, at Mogil
Mogil, one of its oldest identities, the aboriginal king
“ Gobbler,” reputed to be aged over 100 years. “Gobbler”
was unique in this —that he never drank spirits, or even
“ soft stuff,” having an abhorrenoe of any liquor tendered
him by the whites. The story goes that he was
“ hocussed ” in his youth, and had never tasted liquor
sinoe. I have often heard people ask him at the local
pub. to have a drink, and his reply was invariably, “Me
no drink; you gib it the sixpence." It was usual for
“ Gobbler,” as the oldest representative of the Barwon
aborigines, to wire to the Sydney authorities when any of
the blacks were in need of clothing, eta, and, upon his
taking ill recently, the poor old fellow got another blaok-
fellow to send the following wire to the N.S.W. Governor :
“King Gobbler, oldest Murray on the Barwon, dying;
please send it medicine. (Signed) Jimmy Dool.” And
“Cobbler” got the medicine and necessary meat-extract
up to his death, refusing brandy and other stimulants to
the last.
Ewan M‘Pherson, who died the other day,
aged 75, and who, with Lord Wolverhampton,
owned the greater part of Queensland Diamantine
country, was accidentally the means of ending
bushranger Morgan’s villainous career. Acciden-
tally, because Morgan did what he pleased with
Ewan, and would have got away all right but that
a servant girl had managed to give the word to i
neighbor. Anyway, Morgan was trapped and
shot. The details of the subsequent fight over th«
reward for the killing of Morgan make an ugly
page of police history. Quinlan, the shooter, was
merely a laboring man who, though accompanied
by police, worked wholly on his own hook and,
anticipating the police manoeuvre, felled the out-
law and claimed the booty. The police disgust at
Quinlan’s action was only equalled by Morgan’s,
who asseverated before dying that he bad not
been allowed a dingo’s chance.
King O’Malley, M.P. (S.A.), lately made a
few remarks about his enemies :
. . . diabolical rapscallions . . . carrion vul-
tures . . . blacklegs, bluelegs, and redlegs of swiping
vulgarity . . . social rats and crawling reptiles of
city slums . . . trail buzzards of death . . . im-
moral human skunks . . . that manure wrapper
called the Country . . . hypnotised, tattooed tool of
vulgar plutocracy . . . hungry mob of jackals and
leeches who lived by sucking the sores on the dying Con-
servative tiger ....
An Inspector’s Happy New Year.
Walked 30 miles to wish his Wife “ Happy
New Year.”
New Year’s Day. What happiness it brings to
the sacred family circle. What bright, happy
faces one meets in this yearly reunion of hearts
and voices, which makes it the first endeavour of
everyone to spend this day as a happy reunion
with wife, children, family and friends. Nothing
so interferes with the joy of New Year’s Day more
than if one of the family circle is stricken down
with disease, and recovery to health for that dear
one would occasion the most sincere and purest
joy.
Inspector Robt. Mackay, of Echuca, knew this,
and that is why he walked 30 miles to surprise and
gladden his wife with a new year greeting. This
page of romance from the book of life appeals te
us all, for we never know how soon we or some of
our dear ones may suffer as he did. He writes
“It is about ten years ago that I commenced to
suffer from stone in the bladder, also gravel, the
pain from which was most excruciating. I suffered
so much that I often wished I should die. There-
fore it gives me great pleasure to give this testi-
monial, not only to let my fellow sufferers know,
but to show what a benefit Warner’s Safe Cure is
to all mankind. I consulted every doctor in the
town, and was under their treatment for some
considerable time but without being cured. I
then sent to Kerang for a doctor who was con-
sidered to be well versed in complaints of my
nature, and as he had to come a great many miles
the expenses were heavy This I would not have
minded had he cured me. I must say, however,
that he relieved me temporarily ; but it camo on
again as bad as ever. I tried several other treat-
ments, but all failed, and, as a last resort (as most
people do) I tried Warner’s Safe Cure and Pills
(the latter I can speak very highly of as they are
of great assistance to the Safe Cure), and after I
had taken four bottles I experienced great relief,
and I kept on, keeping strictly to the directions,
with a result that it removed a stone twice as
large pea. Warner’s Safe Cure either softened
or dissolved it till it became small enough to pass.
Some days before this I was in such agony that I
thought I should faint, and I left instructions to
not allow any doctor to touch me, as I knew the
Safe Cure was doing me good. When this stone
passed a quantity of urine and blood passed away;
also close on 60 little stones or gravel, which
greatly resembled pearl barley. I can scarcely ex- *
press in words my gratification when this was
over. I went to bed and slept for about 24 hours
—a pleasure I had not known for some time.
When I got up I walked over thirty miles to wish
my wife a happy new year it being New Year s
Eve.

“ The Patents, Trade Marks and Copyright
Laws form one of the most complicated branches
of legal science.” This is true, and it is practi-

their technicalities to draw specifications and

Hitherto expert Patent agents have made charges
simply prohibitive to most inventors, but Mr.
Arthur Griffith, M.L.A., of 39 Castlereagh-
street (next Hotel Australia), Sydney, and Bolton-
street, Newcastle, having established reciprocal
arrangement with leading Patent agents in all the
principal countries in the world is now prepared
to do the work accurately and effectively at rates
that will place a patent within reach of the poorest
inventor. For the sum of £2O (exclusive of cost of
drawings) he will obtain a certificate of Provisional
Protection (in the first instance) for any invention
in the seven Australasian colonies and Great
Britain, and full Patents all over the world at
similarly reasonable rates. Mr. Griffith also
makes a specialty of designing and registering

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Govt, of S.A. expects to have to
advance about <£25,000 to farmers in droughty
districts for the purchase of seed-wheat for next
year’s sowing.
At recent S.A. election the one vote cast
at Braemar, an outlying polling-place, was that of
the assistant returning-officer. And he received
£5 ss. as salary and travelling expenses for count-
ing his own ballot-paper.
Wilson, one of the defeated candidates for
Wellington (M.L.), defined his successful rival,
Stout: “ Robert Stout is an agnostic. An agnos-
tic is a gentleman who spells God with a small ‘ g ’
and Stout with a big ‘S’.”
It is already reported in Melbourne that
the Toorak seat is being got ready for Duncan
Gillies on his return. Yet surely old Talking
Duncan’s many years of earnest and continuous
uselessness entitle him to a rest now.
Attorney-General Isaacs enjoys one con-
stant compliment in Vic. Assembly —viz. , the bitter
animosity of squatter Staughton. Staughton is
the unthinking capitalist who lately classified him-
self and friends as “ the respectable people.”
Jules Joubert is still struggling with his
Queensland exhibition project, but the public,
generally speaking, look upon his invitation to
subscribe with a lacklustre eye. They can go up
to Parliament House free of cost and hear Bat-
tersby any night through the session.
As generally foreseen, the Queensland
National Bank Ministry now laments that it was
the cussedness of the Labor-party which wrecked
Federation. But then, everything that goes
wrong up North, even the ticks and the drought,
is owing to the cussedness of the Labor-party.
The biggest political failure in the new
S.A. Assembly is Opposition Leader Copley, once
a Democrat and until lately the darling of the
Tory party. Copley grows weaker and more pur-
poseless every day, and the Tory crowd will
almost certainly drop its idol next session for
John Darling, jun. Poor old “ Turncoat Bill ” !
Gilhooley, from the backblocks :
In Queensland, there are some 18,000 unmarried colored
men, which means, in plain English, that the white popula-
tion has to supply women tor this crowd. Is this the destiny
of our country—breeding prostitutes for colored Asiatics,
while the noble Australian spends his time at cricket?
The colored men have lately been encroaching on the em-
ployers’ female relations. This is why the Bundaburghers
are howling for female-servant immigration.
The two Melbourne “ great ” dailies seem
equally anxious for a lessening of the Vic. Legis-
lature, and the Age goes so far as to publish the
names of democratic members who broke their
promises to vote for the alleged reform. If the
men thus held up to reprobation are well-advised
they will take an early opportunity to teach their
constituents what the Reduction of Members Bill
really means, and why the Age ought to be
against, rather than in favor of, a scheme
fashioned after Fat Man’s own heart. As for
having broken their pledges, they can plead that
it’s never too late to abandon a bad theory.
A great cold blast of explanation has
already set in among the defeated Cold Tea and
Tory parties in M.L. Each party says the trouble
was largely owing to the other splitting the vote,
and putting up unsuitable candidates. Also, the
defeat is owing to wholesale bribery, corruption,
roll-stuffing, and mis-counting of the ballot by a
“ k’rupt Guv’ment ” and its hangers on; to
bribery, corruption, personation, roll-stuffing and
the working of the dead-man vote by the publi-
cans, to woman-suffrage, trades-unionism, godless
education, and the machinations of the devil.
Further, it isn’t a defeat at all, but a “ moral
victory.” Also, neither party wanted to win, and
preferred giving the democratic Government
enough rope to hang itself with. Also 2827 other
things.
Melbourne Paunch :
The placing of this £3,500,000 with the Queensland
National Bank appears to be most reprehensible, whether
it was done in a light or careless fashion, or especially for
the purpose of bolstering up the balance-sheet of the
bank. The Turner Ministry proposed in their crude State
Bank Bill, which they so hastily dropped, to take power
to come to the assistance of any bank in difficulties. We
should imagine from the exposures which have taken
place in connection with the Queensland National Bank
and the Bank of New Zealand, also of several Victorian
banks which were not assisted, that no Ministry will ever
he so foolhardy or financially wicked in the future as to
propose to come to the help of any weak or struggling
ooncern.
Good old Paunch ! The B.N.Z. and the “ several
Victorian banks ” went wrong under private man-
agement, therefore State management is wrong.
The Queensland Government poured about
into the Q.N.B. without security,
therefore the Turner Government’s proposal to
advance money temporarily to private banks at a
crisis on the deposit of sufficient secui'ty is
“ foolish ” and “ wicked.” Beautiful logic !
Premier Reid: “All Australia under an
improved Federal Council with a scope to develope
gradually into a more complete form of federation
might be a wiser consummation than part of Aus-
tralia welded together in a final form of union.”
In other words, a large thing half-done might be
better than a smaller thing completed. And Reid
prefers six provinces under a useless and impo-
tent Federal Council to five with a solid Central
Government. Reid believes in size more than
quality, and, considering his corporation, who oan
say that he doesn’t live up to his faith ?
Maoriland Par-
liament has legalised
marriage with a
deceased wife’s sis-
ter, but when it was
invited last session
to pass a Deceased
Husband’s Brother
Bill it rejected the
measure with scorn.
This was done, too,
by a legislature
largely elected by
women. Evidently
the Maoriland
woman, after due
consideration of the
brother she is already
married to, doesn’t
want any more like
him.
At Govt, land-
sales of township lots
in W.A. some Govt,
hanger-on generally
gets the valuing, and
some other g.h.o. the
selling. These two
collude. The valuer
often proceeds sim-
ply and openly to
collect bribes. He
interviews the occu-
pier of an improved
lot; if the occupier
does not “ act sensi-
bly,” the valuation
of his improvements
is so low that any
outsider is likely to
out-bid him when
the lot is auctioned.
If, on the other hand,
he greases the
valuer’s palm hand-
somely, <£soo worth
of improvements go
down as <£lsoo, and
this is so obviously
outrageous that no one will bid for the section, and
the occupier gets it at upset price. If any fool
does buy the lot the occupier makes £lOOO, for
the buyer has to pay for the improvements at the
official appraisement.
In Maoriland, under the merciful Legiti-
mation Act, an unlawful child can be made legiti-
mate and so registered if the parents afterwards
marry, providing there was no obstacle to their
marriage at the time of its birth. The law has
been in force 15 months, and under it 79 children
have already been relieved of the stigma of
illegitimacy- equal to one-tenth of the whole
number of illegitimate births.
A CASH DEAL.
SHE : “ Can you explain how that handsome man
came to marry such an ugly woman? ”
HE: “ Cheque-mated, probably.”
S.A. has in force a Lapsed Bills Continu-
ance Act, and under this Kingston’s Land Re-
form Bill, the Municipal Single Vote Bill, and
Land Values Assessment Bill and some other
radical measures which had to be dropped this
session will be revived next June where, they left
off. The old practice was to start all the weary
argument afresh from the beginning, and hardened
Tories still assert that the present time-saving
device is “ un-English ” and “ unconstitutional.”
That brilliant Maoriland Oppositionist,
Mitchelson, who went down badly at Auckland,
fooled away his chances just as Parkes did when
he lost the leadership of the N.S.W. Foreign-
trade party. He refused to stand, and waited to
be duly grovelled to by the party and implored to
come forward. But the party didn’t understand
the situation and ran another candidate for
Mitchelson’s intended safe seat at Eden, and then
the great man with difficulty induced himself to
come forward at Auckland where he wasn’t
wanted, and the thud with which he fell to the
bottom of the poll was heard as far off as Samoa.
Vic. Constitution Act Amendment Bill
was thrown out by the Upper House at sight. It
would have been thrown out anyway, but appar-
ently the Turner Government itself supplied a
handy excuse. A Constitution Amendment Bill
must be passed by a two-thirds majority. This
wasn’t one—it was merely a measure establishing
adult suffrage and abolishing the property vote ;
but the Government called it a Constitution
Amendment Bill, and the Council promptly re-
fused to look at it because it hadn’t secured the
needful two-thirds majority in the Assembly.
PAT’S IMPRESSION.
MARY : “ Just look, asthore. She’s a foine ladyloik person .”
PAT: “Faith, that’s more than I can say for him.”
Premier Seddon, in the last few days of
the M.L. election campaign, put in a tremendous
amount of work. Leaving his wife to suppress
the Opposition candidate in his own Westland
electorate, he addressed meetings at Christchurch,
Dunedin, and all the important towns in between,
addressed three meetings in Wellington, delivered
addresses at Stratford and Eltharn- in Taranaki,
then another at Otaki, and finally addressed three
meetings at Wellington in one night. And all
this was crowded into seven days. For that last
week Kumara Dick averaged about two hours
sleep a night; all the rest was travelling and
speech-making.
In Melbourne they accept
financial smells philosophically;
in Brisbane they love them.
When the Bill authorising the
Government to reduce interest
on its Q.N. Bank deposit and
give more time for repayment
was going through Parliament,
it was suggested as an amend-
ment that the Government
should require the bank to elect
new directors before it entered
into any agreement. Rejected
with scorn and a large majo-
rity. It doesn’t seem very much
to ask—the peaceful resignation
of the directors who wrecked
the bank and issued the dread-
fully-unreliable balance-sheets,
and otherwise proved their
hopeless incapacity. But
Queensland Parliament would-
n’t hurt the feelings of its re-
presentative fat men for the
world, and is quite willing to
leave the State’s millions still
in their charge.
George Thorn, M.P. (Q.), once known as
the “boy Premier”: “If Australian Federation
is accomplished, Brisbane will be wiped off the
face of the earth or words to that effect.
Federation will abolish border tariffs and ex-
tinguish the preferential railway rates which force
business where it wouldn’t otherwise go. There-
fore any city that Australia has no use for will
naturally be obliterated.
In the last days of the session just closed,
the Tas. House of Landlords rejected Attorney-
General Clark’s pet electoral scheme—the Hare
system modified by compelling electors to vote
for at least three candidates out of six. But the
clause was rejected by one vote only. Clark
fairly clung to the buttonhole of the recalcitrant
one until he got the clause recommitted and
passed ; then he invited the old gentlemen to
“ try sumthin’. ”
The Jap. is coming with a vengeance ! At
a mill on the Lower Burdekin (Q.), 150 Japs, are em-
ployed with about half-a-dozen whites. It is not
pretended, by the way. that white men cannot do
the work, for not only white men but even white
women can be seen doing field work in the same
district. Japanese auction sales of Japanese
goods are becoming common in Townsville, and
the Yamashiro Maru is in evidence along the
coast— the forerunner of a foreign fleet and per-
haps a foreign supplanter.
The second Maoriland election under
woman’s suffrage goes to further dispel four old-
established theories : (1) Women in general don’t
(in M.L. at all events) refuse to use the suffrage ;
(2) they don’t always vote the Tory ticket; (3) the
most beautiful candidate doesn’t invariably get the
solid woman vote —in fact, the ugly politician with
shabby clothes and bow legs got as much support
as usual; (4) The baby doesn’t fall into the fire
while its mother is away voting any more than
when she is away doing anything else.
Seventeen Chinamen left Brisbane for
Hongkong last week, each taking with him a per-
mit to return. It was well-known that half of
them purposed never to return hence the
anxiety they displayed to secure the valuable per-
mit. In time a trade in permits will in China be
as vigorously carried on as the sale of return boat
and railway tickets in Australia.
“ Yooey ” Taylor, who, by his raucous
“object”—it was the only thing he said and he
pronounced it “bjk”—blocked more N.S.W.
Bills than any other Parliamentarian of his time,
announces that he is still “a Freetrader to the
backbone but a Protectionist against the world.”
And this is the sort of man who holds a seat in
Parliament longer than any other.
Recently the Tas. Government sent a
number of unemployed to do track-cutting for
about nothing a week in the Dundas district, and,
with the good old Vandemonian instinct, it had
them escorted by police lest the recipients of
relief should desert by the way. Which is vaguely
reminiscent of a certain Mexican general who was
famous for his success in beating up recruits for
the Juarist army in the days of the Anglo-French
invasion. One of his letters read :“ I send you 24
volunteers, all young men and filled with an
ardent desire to fight for the Republic. The
guard has orders to shoot any who attempt to
escape. I could have sent you more only I had no
more handcuffs.”
Theo. Fink (brother to B.J. of the almighty
ha’penny) was returned to Yic. Parliament on the
broad Liberal ticket at last election. Festive
Theodore misrepresents Jolimont and West Rich-
mond. He has devoted his legislative time to
hedging, bucking and jumping on every important
Liberal measure brought up for consideration.
Lacking the courage to vote, he paired against a
vital principle of the Suffrage Bill; he played his
party false on the tariff issues, and now joins with
shifty Shiels in thwarting the passage of the State
Bank Bill. There is said to be a rod in pickle for
Fink, who—like Alfred Deakin —figures as a legal
champion of shady balance-sheets and directors
in distress.
Vic. Council is subject to childish huffs
when its dignity is trodden on. When the
Factories Bill came before it first it agreed to the
clause providing that the weekly half-holiday
should be fixed by a bare majority of shopkeepers
in any locality, but insisted that the board to fix
wages in any trade should be elected by members
of that trade only. Then the Assembly pointed
out that’this would practically leave the fixing of
wages in the furniture trade to the Chinese, so the
Council reluctantly altered this item. Then, being
huffed at having its mistake pointed out, it pro-
ceeded to blast the shopkeepers’ half-holiday by
requiring the date thereof to be fixed by a two-
thirds majority. There was no earthly connection
between the two matters, but the Council was
mad and had to kick something.
N.S.W. ex-Premier Dibbs, doing the usual
whoop about the “resources of this great country,”
says that Australia could wipe off its entire public
debt any day by selling its railways in London.
This is another feature of the delusion about the
wonderful wealth of Australia. The debt is
<£180,000,000. The railways yield enough to
pay <£l 17s. per cent, on this amount. If J.
Bull will deliberately swap debentures which
bring in a sure <£3 15s. or more per cent,
all round, for the worry of owning and work-
ing a railway system which will give less
than half as much, then he is a stupendous ass.
The railways might fetch their cost —about 112
millions —but even that isn’t likely. When will
the Australian cease to talk gorgeous lunacy about
the wealth of his dry, parched, ordinary continent?
The M.L. Cold Tea party was a dejected
and none too affable crowd the morning after the
elections. It went down heavily in the National
Option poll; instead of sweeping the board, the
teetotallers, so far as the first count shows, failed
to carry Prohibition anywhere, and only carried a
vote for a reduction in the number of licensed
houses in one town, and not much of a town at
that. There were 23 more or less virulent teeto-
tallers in last Parliament; in this one they number
only 12 so far as is known at present. Moreover,
Robert Stout, the great high-priest of the party,
only struggled into second place for Wellington
City, 105 votes behind that objectionable ship-
rigger and ex-sailor, John Hutcheson; and if he
had been a little further down the list he would
have been out altogether. Yet the sun rose next
morning just as usual, and looked down on the
wreck of the Cold Tea party as if nothing had
happened.

Extraordinary Cure in
Sydney .
RECOVERY AFTER ALMOST EVERY
KNOWN REMEDY HAD
BEEN TRIED.
DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS FOR PALE
PEOPLE ACHIEVE A GREAT
VICTORY IN OUR MIDST.
INSOMNIA, DEBILITY, EXHAUSTION,
DYSPEPSIA, INDIGESTION,
PALPITATION OF THE HEART, &c., &c.
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION BY A
NEWSPAPER REPORTER.
(From the Australian Courier).
Hearing of a remarkable cure in the suburbs of
Sydney, and being anxious to verify the report,
we despatched a representative to the residence of
the lady in question—Mrs. Margaret Layfield, 69
Surrey-street, Darlinghurst—who, in response to
a request for a history of her sickness and re-
covery, told the following story, which is given in
her own words :
“ Up to the spring of 1894 I was always com-
paratively healthy, and could carry out my house-
hold duties without feeling in the slightest degree
fatigued, and would enjoy a sound and restful
night’s sleep. Then I began to suffer from weak-
ness, and a feeling of depression. I had a fulness
and pain at the chest and round the sides ; I was
also troubled with palpitation of the heart and a
sense of overbearing exhaustion, lost a great deal
of sleep ; in fact, I kept tossing about the beu all
night. In the morning I woke unrefreshed, and
looked at the day before me as one of positive
torture. Frequently I had to remain in bed all
day, and call in the assistance of a neighbor,
being really too weak to do anything; I also had a
terribly languid feeling. Having inherited a good
constitution, and being always averse to calling in
a medical man, I endeavored to battle through
my troubles, trusting that a certain amount of
determination would assist me to throw off this
terrible nausea. Exhausted nature, however, at last
gave way, and I was on the eve of sending for a
doctor, when a friend drew my attention to a re-
markable cure of dyspepsia and nervous debility
effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People. I got some of the Pills as an experiment,
and at once proceeded to take them in accordance
with the printed instructions. After a few days,
and before I had completed the first box, I felt a
visible improvement, my appetite returned, and
once more food agreed with me. I continued
taking the Pills, and am now happy to relate that
I seem as well and strong as ever, and have suffered
no more from that terrible indigestion. I feel
deeply grateful that chance threw in my way Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, as I tell everyone ; in fact, I
should consider myself a heartless woman if I did
not make this matter public, and endeavor to alle-
viate the troubles of my suffering sisters.
“ I now feel happy and contented, being restored
to health, and can fully appreciate those beautiful
lines of the poet Thomson, ‘ Health is the vital
principle of bliss.’ ”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are
not a patent medicine, but are a thoroughly
scientific preparation, the result of years of careful
study on the part of an eminent Edinburgh Uni-
versity physician, and they were successfully used
by him in his every-day practice for years before
being offered for general sale. They positively
cure Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lumbago, and Neu-
ralgia, and are a specific for all diseases of women,
such as anaemia, poor and watery blood, female
irregularities, nervous headache and hysteria.
They are not a purgative medicine, but brace up
and permanently strengthen the whole system.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from
all leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will
forward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post
order, 1 box for 2s. 9d., or J-dozen for 14s. 9d.

Public Notices.
pUBLIC SERVICE BOARD.
50 Young Street, Sydney,
17th December, 1896.
The Public Service Board hereby notify that the first
general competitive examination for admission to the
Public Service of the colony of New South Wales will be
held on the 27th, 28th, and 29th days of JANUARY, 1897,
at various centres, which will be fixed to suit the conveni-
ence of candidates. The number of appointments to be
made is 20, all of which will be in a junior capacity. Can-
didates must be over sixteen and under twenty-one years
of age on the first day of examination ; be of good moral
character, and in sound health, and have resided in the
colony for at least three years at date of application.
Every person who desires to submit himself to examina-
tion must forward to the Secretary to the Board, to reach
him not later than the 12th JANUARY, 1897, a statement,
in his own handwriting, giving his full name and address,
and his age, and notifying in which of the principal
towns of the colony he wishes to be examined. He must
also submit with his application an extract from the
register in which his birth is recorded, or other satisfac-
tory evidence of his age ; a certificate to the effect that
he is of good moral character, signed by the headmaster
or teacher, if he is attending school, or has ceased to
attend school for a shorter period than six months, by his
employer if he is at present engaged in business duties, or
by a clergyman or justice of the peace if it is more than
six months since he left school and he is not in employ-
ment ; and a certificate from a reputable person to the
effect that the applicant has resided in the colony for at
least three years.
Every candidate whose name is not registered by the
Board will be so informed, with the reason why registra-
tion was refused. A list of registered candidates will be
advertised, with the times and places of examination ;
and, in addition, every registered candidate will be per-
sonally notified of the time and place when and where he
must present himself.
The subjects in which candidates will be examined are
Handwriting; English (dictation, grammar, and composi-
tion) ; Arithmetic (full course) and Euclid (first book)
Elementary Bookkeeping and Accounts ; Outlines of
Physical and Political Geography, and the Geography of
the Australasian colonies, particularly of New South
Wales; and English History from the middle of the
Eighteenth Century to the present time, especially with
reference to the Colonies and Dependencies. As an extra
subject, candidates will be allowed to take Mathematics,
Latin, French, German, Elementary Chemistry, or Ele-
mentary Geology and Mineralogy ; and they may also
elect to be examined in Shorthand. Every candidate
who wishes to be examined in a special subject or in
Shorthand must give notice of his desire in his application.
The fee for examination will be 10s., which must be paid
to a Clerk of Petty Sessions or into the Treasury, and the
receipt lodged with the Secretary of the Board prior to
the date of examination. A successful candidate must
produce a medical certificate to the effect that he is in
sound health and free from physical defects before he will
be allowed to begin his duties.
The regulations governing the examinations will appear
in a special issue of the Government Gazette.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A farcical prologue to the Martin-Parsons match
was perpetrated on a gullible public earlier in the week,
when “ the crack Victorian cyclist ” went through a form
of beating the mile record in a trial spin. Something had
to be done to excite interest in the coming gate-money
struggle, so Parsons ran a mile in the alleged time of
lmin. 53sec. The time may have been correctly taken, or
otherwise. Some people made it very much otherwise.
Anyhow, this “splendid performance” wasduly chronicled
by the little fraternity of bike reporters, and the public
were warmly exhorted to roll up and see the wondrous
record-breaker smash Bihnartin. Oddly enough, no
stories of gentle William’s prowess on the track found
their way into print. It was enough that the Victorian
had achieved his mile in lmin. 53sec.
The Melbourne public swallowed the bait
greedily, and a great crowd lined the St. Kilda ground
last Saturday. Parsons and Martin were once again to
meet in three races of 1,5, and 10 miles. 20,000 people,
or so, turned pale as the record-breaker and the Yank
came forth to test their rival powers of speed and endur-
ance over the mile course. Hero Parsons dashed away at
a funereal pace, and hero Martin crawled after him for
about five-sixths of the allotted distance. Then the
leader cycled his hardest, and the Yank, following suit,
pipped him on the post by twelve inches. Martin had
shown himself slightly faster than Parsons in a short
sprint, and the board showed 3min. 23 3-ssee., exactly a
minute and a-half slower than the aforesaid record which
had been put up for advt. purposes.
Presently the adversaries came out to race the
five-mile event, or, rather, sundry tandems, triplets, and
“quads” came out to pace, whilst Martin and Parsons
prepared themselves to follow their respective leaders.
The five-mile performance was a success. Martin’s
changing triplets want faster than Parsons’s “quads”
until the American hanger-on was a quarter of a mile in
front of the Victorian hanger-on, after which the latter
ceased from pedalling. Martin, preceded and supported
on the right hand by pacemakers, won the race and the
rubber in lOmiti. 23sec., beating the previous Australian
record by 2sec. He shook hands with Parsons, who con-
soled himself by explaining that his defeat was more or
less due to his pacemakers. They had taken him too far
out on the newly-laid asphalt, he said (which was quite
true). Also, he expressed his readiness to meet Martin
again at any time in three 1-mile heats, for Parsons, as a
popular idol, is loth to expire. Nevertheless, he may,
the present scribe sadly fears, consider himself dead and
gone forever, like many another fiction “champion.”
Parsons was a Victorian newspaper fiction from the first.
The five-mile was a pathetic, almost a brutal,
exhibition, and was reminiscent of the few fistic battles
when hopelessly inferior men get pounded round the ring
by merciful bruisers who vainly try for the point to “ put
the poor blanker asleep.” After a mile and a-half, Par-
sons showed signs of weakening ; and at three miles
hopelessly collapsed Thence out, he followed hopelessly,
pale and open-mouthed, and lost ground at every turn of
the pedal.
The fact, is that nobody is really aware of Mar-
tin’s capabilities. At present Bill is anxiously looking
for a “ mug” who will bet hi n that he can’t do five miles
under lOmin., or 10 miles under 21min., and when he has
cleaned out that incredulous person, Martin will probably
take down some simpleton who thinks he can’t do a mile
in a minute or ride up a church-spire in 39sec. It’s only
a matter of dollars.
According to the look «.,f things, Australia should
be holding some world’s records at no distant date. With
improved tracks and such pacing as was given Martin on
Saturday, it shouldn’t bustle the Yankee very badly to
cut down Michael’s 9min. 13sec. for the five miles.
In addition to his jaw, Martin rnust possess an
iron constitution, iron muscles, and an iron heart. After
lowering the Australian 10-mile record, Bill didn’t trouble
to get off his machine, but simply plugged it slowly
round to the start of the 5-Mile Scratch and had a go
at that. Nearly everybody was sorry he didn’t win it,
too, for he rode strongly and gamely and was only beaten
when the sprint came.
In this event Kellow, who finished third, backed
himself for a big amount, but his work seemed so heavy
that he couldn’t get in his customary sprint. Dismount-
ing, he found that his back wheel required to be dragged
to move, and, investigating further, he discovered a long
length of copper wire twisted round his hub. In case this
wasn’t enough to block him, the gentle “stiffener” had
provided for a fall by unscrewing the cotter-pins of his
pedal.
* * * *
Martin, having beaten Parsons in the one and
five mile fixtures, completed his contract by beating the
10-mile record handsomely. That is to say, the pace-
makers beat the record, and the man with the iron jaw
hung on to a steady succession of triplet wheels with in-
domitable pluck. The race against Time was rather
wearisome, but it had redeeming points about it. The
pacers were neatly and decently arrayed in pale blue, and
they took up the running, turn and turn about, as though
the glory of Biljmartin were their own. Pacemakers
somehow remind one of the Church of England burial
service. They bring everything into the world of bicycle
sport, yet they carry nothing worth mentioning out of it.
The triplets make the cause, while Bilmartin accom-
plishes the effect.
* * * *
The foreigners, Porta and Martin, remain boss
favorites with the multitudes. Porta, particularly, is the
beloved of their soul. His two victories in the St. Kilda
Wheel and International Scratch were probably the most
popular results of honest plugging that have happened in
Melbourne up to date. Twice during the handicap final
the Italian seemed to be in a hopelessly bad position, but
each time he managed to get through and placp himself
in front again, with a vigorous outside rush. The second
of these semi-circular efforts carried the toiler home
amidst shouts of “ He deserved it.” That’s the point.
Porta and Martin are the men who give the most strikirg
exhibitions of work for their prize-money. They supply
the sensation scenes, and a bike-race, as a rule, is a dull
affair without them. Of Australian riders Walne is about
the best entertainment at present.
* * * *
The tower of a church overlooking the St.
Kilda ground was crowded with a select coterie, who saw
Bilmartin beat Parsons for nothing. Trust a church for
getting a deadhead show.
* * * *
Five serious accidents (three fatal) to more or
less eminent persons were reported locally or per cable
one day last week in the Sydney papers.
* * * *
In his match with Martin, Parsons was foolish
enough to ride with a 92 gear, and that after just having
left the doctor’s hands. J.W. should remember the
advice of Zimmerman, who knows more than he does —
“ Stick to the low gear—flash, don’t plug.”

The League of Yic. Wheelmen numbers now
2144 members—l 667 of whom come from clubs, while 467
are unattached. The League has a credit balance of
£628.

A Southern cycling sheet, which is evidently
touting for the support of the Very Nicest people, spreads
itself out into a fulsome glorification of the amateur
cycling men, the lily-white youths who shave their legs
before appearing on the track being carefully dubbed
“ Mr.” while the common professional has to wander
through the columns as “J. W. Parsons” or merely
“Martin.” In a recent issue appears a horrified wail for
fear “ Mr. Berry, the son of the Speaker,” should carry
out his threat to turn pro., and concluding, “after all,
Mr. Berry will find more advantage and respect by re-
maining with his own people.” And yet that paper is
the official organ of the (professional) L.V.A. !
* * * *
Bicycle training-tracks about Melbourne are
haunted by a few bold-faced damsels, who stand around
in perfect composure watching the parade of scantily-clad
scorchers. Sometimes an accident or a displacement of
his small handful of clothes causes a rider to precipitately
dive for the dressing-room, in which case the female
visitors are the only persons present who seem disinclined
to blush.
* * * *
“ What strikes the visiting cyclist about Aus-
tralians,” remarked a big wheelman, the other day, “ is
the personal interest manifested by the crowd for the
trier. The Australians make gods of big athletes. The
Parisians want to see races and men. The Australians
want the men and races.”
* * » *
At all the Melb. cycling meetings so far held
this season, the reserves have been overrun by book-
makers yelling their prices. And the very worst meeting
yet in this respect was the amateurs’ gathering at St.
Hilda.
» * * »
“Many wom-n would never have fallen had
they not mounted the bicycle,” howls the humorless
Women’s Rescue League. Very likely, since to fall off
anything, even a pulpit or a pinnacie of stupidity, vou
must first get on it.
» * * *
Three months ago it was widely paragraphed
that the Melb. Austral wheel race would include' Michael,
the two Lintons, Huret, Jaequeldi, and almost every
English and continental cyclist of whom Australia has
heard. On his return from America, too, Parsons was
reported to have stated that John S. Johnson was follow-
ing per next boat. But not one of the men mentioned
has touched Australian shores, and apparently none of
them ever intended to, unless it was the Linton who died.
* * * *
A cycling marriage, the second in Vic., took
place at Violet Town on Monday week, the happy couple
mounting their wheels at the church door and pedalling
off on their honeymoon. The first marriage took place at
Bacchus Marsh, and next day the local rag, chronicling
the arrival of the pair at Ballarat, remarked expressively
that “making due allowance for stoppages, six hours was
very fair time.”
» * • *
Bilmartin, whose simple and serviceable suit of
blue serge with which he landed in Australia will be well
remembered by many, has begun to blossom out into
something of a dude. Bill now puts up at a swagger
hotel, and strolls out on St. Hilda Esplanade on Sundays
in tan boots, a straw decker and a tail-coat. A few more
big handicaps, and the iron-jawed one will swell it in
frock-coat, spats and belltopper. Australia is verily a
fine country for the working man.
’* * " * *
The bun for cheek is awarded to the message
sent by the N.S.W. League of Wheelmen (Mr. Percy
Hunter) to Justice Hodges on the occasion of his cycling
smash-up : —“ League of N.S. Wales Wheelmen expresses
deep sympathy with your Honor in painful accident, and
records its disapprobation of the reprehensible practice of
coasting in inhabited centres.” “ Reprehensible habit of
coasting ” is delicious. What does the League say about
the criminal practice of scorching in metropolitan
thoroughfares ?
* » * *
The re-appearance of Bilmartin from his forced
retirement may give a fillip to public interest, but pre-
sently sporting folks will grow very weary of witnessing
“ all the champions ” in perpetual competition. If they
ran straight and up to “ form ” every time they would
soon be a monotonous show. On the other hand, incon-
sistent performances, apart from pacing considerations,
make the sport too farcical for serious discussion among
men, and so, in either case, crowds at bike races are
bound to diminish as the season advances. Women up
to now have been mainly accountable for splendid gate
receipts, but even the fair sex must tire after a while of
gloating upon naked legs.
* * * *
A golden-haired damsel of West Melb. is wanted
on a charge of stealing 15 sovereigns from the pocket of
William Martin. There was no necessity for l’lugger Bill
to arise the following day and advertise that “ he was not
the William Martin,” &e. Everybody who has ever heard
of Bill knows well enough that, even if any fluffy-headed
girl did manage to get within a yard of his manly bosom,
she would stand a better chance of taking Tatt.’s big
sweep than of easing the gentle William of 15 of his hard-
won sovereigns.
* * » »
Cyclist Porta, coming from W.A. to Melb. re-
cently, was very seasick. The second day he observed
pathetically to a fellow-passenger : “ Ven I sprint on land
I do vin someding, but ven I sprint on my stomach I lose
everytings ! ”
* * * *
The N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union had the second day
of its lame and impotent meeting last Saturday. The
Sydney public stayed away comprehensively ; only some
2000 people had nothing better to do than come to the
Sydney Cricket Ground. Clearly, the sweat of death is
upon the brow of the lily-white amateur cyclist, who can’t
cycle.
The least curseable part of the programme was
the lap scratch-races ; and the final of these was won by
Cameron, who, riding with no judgment and little pace,
naturally beat the others, who rode with bad judgment
and no pace. Cameron, by the way, seems to have a
tendency to bore his competitors into the rails.
Has the Union no eyes that it could not see the
barefaced pacing in the Union Wheel race?
M. M. Roseingrave, the Irish athlete and
pigeon-shot, had some more pole-jumping exercise, and
raised the stature, of his former pole-jump by a liair’s-
breadth. It was advertised in the programme that M. M.
R. pole-jumped by special request, but nobody except
Roseingrave seemed to take any special interest in the
pole-jump proceedings.
» » * *
Kellow -will be prepared to tackle Bilmartin,
Lewis, Parsons, or anybody else, in a match for the cham-
pionship as soon as he can see a sufficiently fat stake
hanging to the “ honor.” If the M.H.C. were game to put
up 4:50 i for a two-mile scratch-race Australia would pro-
bably discover a real local champion.
» * * *
The amount netted by each member of the Aus-
tralian Eleven, over and above ordinary hotel exes., was
t (>3IJ. Yet one of them had the nerve to tell a Maoriland
press interviewer that anybody would be welcome to do
his share of the work on the same terms next time a team
goes to England. They rate themselves at full value,
these young professors of an easy “ science.” A capacity
for devoting a simple mind and a commonplace body to
the game, the whole game, and nothing but the game, is
the chief essential for a good cricketer.
• • * *
Cabled that H. H. Stephenson, captain of the
first team of English cricketers to visit Australia (1862),
has died, aged Oil. Stephenson's team was a private spec,
of Spiers and Pond, of the Caf<s de Paris, Melb., who
thereby obtained their first big leg-up. They sent their
manager, Mallam, to England to negotiate. One of the
team, Charles Lawrence (now a State pensioner), remained
in Australia and for years held an appointment on the
railways at Newcastle.

An infantile ad. from last week's journals:
“ Racing men are hereby notified that the Patronage of
the L.V.W. has Not yet been granted to the Melbourne
Bicycle Club for their race-meeting on Ist and 2nd
January, 1897.” Wrangles between the League and the
Club merely expose the trumpery character of both insti-
tutions. If the St. Hilda Cricket Club, with its asphalted
track, had a mind to become the supreme power in bike-
racing by arranging a series of substantial prize-meetings,
the L.V.W. and M.B.C. couldn’t make the least difference
one way or other. If the quadrangle and track at the
Exhibition Building were bigger, J. C. Williamson, or any
other showman who could make arrangements to lease
the ground and run an attractive show every Saturday,
might crown himself king of the sport. And the fact that
nobody launches out in this way directly indicates a want
of faith in the stability of bike-racing as a draw. Public
taste is likely to turn against it pretty soon.
* * * *
The interprovincial cricket match N.S.W. v. S.
Aus. rather points the moral that the accumulation of fat
is death to the accumulation of runs. Iredale, who
weighs some two stone more than he did on leaving Aus.,
was bowled first ball first innings, and took one hour and
31 minutes to score 21 second innings. Gregory, who also
weighs considerably more, got 0 and 3. Kelly, who turns
the scale at 13st. odd, was, of course, run out for 3 second
innings. And the only man to distinguish himself in
batting on the N.S.W. side was the colt Noble, who made
in his second innings 69.
For S. Aus., Blondin Lyons, who didn’t go to
England, made top score, first innings, with 78, chiefly
because M’Kibbin was laboring under a two stone handi-
cap on a hot day. Giffen, also much heavier than
formerly, couldn’t scrape up more than 3 on his first

1 Eldon Chambers, 16 Elizabeth-st., Hobart, Tasmania,
fnnings. While Hill, who scored 49, had a bit more than
even a fat man’s share of luck.
The composition of the N.S.W. team is open to
very much question. Garrett is captain because he can
win the match for his side when his side wins the match
for him. Coningham is in because his legs have grown
no shorter, despite continual chasing of the ball. And
Turner is in because he has consistently failed in club
matches all the present season.

When last in Tasmania tenor Newbury played
two single-wicket matches. In the first match, at Zeehan,
Newbury won the toes, went in, and was bowled first
ball. Opponent folio s -lit. Newbury goes in again—is
bowled first ball. Ne b .y fields for a second time, and
his opponent is once more bowled first ball!—a record.
In Hobart the vocalist loses the toss and goes into the
field, and remains there —for one ball. He then goes to
bat, and remains there —also for one ball. Newbury fields
and bowls again. His first ball is played, likewise his
second ; but the third—a combination of Jones, Richard-
son, M‘Kibbin, and one or two others—takes the wicket.
Capt. Newbury’s side goes to bat again—gracefully mows
the first ball to square-leg, and wins the match by one
wioket and four runs.

It is about time that the V.R.C. handicapper
reduced his opinion of chairman Miller’s decent little horse,
Preston, who has scored only one win out of many attempts
since he had the misfortune to dead-heat with Quiver (for
2nd place) in the Veteran Stakes at Flemington, thirteen
months ago. Legitimate handicapping seems bound to be
rough on any good goer that lacks brilliancy.

Sam Cook, apparently, had an idea of finding a
Westralian purchaser for The Merry Boy. The nuggety
son of Trenton was entered, and duly scratched last week,
for Perth Cup. Last week he was entered, along with

Never Mind, by Van Cleve, the sire of Fritz,
made an easy win of the Australian Trotting Association
Cup at Richmond, Vic. Strange it is Van Cleve never
turned out a trotter whilst at Hobartville. Childe Harold
and Van Cleve were at Hobartville together, and many trot-
ting men believe that numbers of horses credited with
being Childe Harold stock are really Van Cleve’s. Certain
it is that many of the so-called Childe Harold get show a
remarkable likeness to the Van Cleves in conformation and
gait.

To-day (Saturday), at Randwick, a field of high-
class two-year-olds will contest the valuable December
Stakes. Fleet Admiral (own brother to the Admiral) has
journeyed all the way from Adelaide to run, but in Patriot
he will find a formidable foe. Phillip, a Cranbrook colt
that will do big things later on ; Amberite, a smart son of
Carbine; and the recent winner, The Tola, make up a
powerful opposition, but the result will probably lie be-
tween Fleet Admiral and Patriot, of whom the latter may
just prove the better. A whispered dangerous outsider
is Burleigh, a staunch staying son of Lochiel.

Handicappers are prone to underrate horses that
have been, for some reason or another, “on the shelf”
for some time. The scratching of Projectile and Ronda
has probably extricated the A.J.C. and Tatt.’s handi-
cappers from an awkward predicament, but in giving the
erstwhile champion sprinter Whakawatea only Bst. 71b.
the weight-adjuster has done his best to make a present
of the Carrington Stakes to this horse’s owner, provided
that the animal be all right, which is reported to be the
case.
* * * •
In the event of Cartridge and The Chief being
absentees for Villiers Stakes this rich prize looks like fall-
ing to the two-year-old Syerla, who is very well and
nicely treated in the way of weight. The Summer Cup
should fall to Sabretache, Fort or Cravat, whilst Whaka-
watea, Astronomer and The Chief have excellent chances
in the Carrington. There are also some prospects for
Akarini, who may just about win if Whakawatea has lost
all form. Should Fort miss the Summer Cup he should
carry off Tatt.’s trophy, as he is one of the few genuine
stayers at present in training.

Joe Donnelly’s latest effort, the 22-footer Effie,
built to the order of Mr. M'Murtrie, showed what a flyer
she must be by donning sail first time the other Saturday,
and fairly running away from the 22-foqt fleet. Donnelly
is the genius who first left the beaten track of narrow-
gutted, narrow-tucked boats in vogue a score or more
years ago, and launched forth with his broad-tucked,
beamy, flange-bowed boats, since copied by all our
builders. Donnelly has now built the four best boats of
their class in the harbor —the Ida, 24ft.; Effie, 22ft.; Aus-
tralian 111., 18ft.; and the Wanda, 14ft.

The treatment of A. W. Eales by the N.S.W.
Gun Club is one of the many unsportsmanlike acts per-
petrated in the name of Australian sport. The Club has
made a new mark, 34yds., for Eales only, and although it
may start him on 32yds. or 31yds. any quarter, he is
promptly shunted back on the first reasonable oppor-
tunity. Eales is quite willing to always stay on 32yds.,
the limit for such world-famous shots as Carver and
Brewer, and points out that, unlike these, he is a mere
amateur who does not live on the game. The unfair
treatment of Eales is brought about by those amateurs of
the N.S.W. Gun Club who do live on the game as much
as they can.

The Sydney Enterprise Swimming Club put on
a good bill at the Natatorium last Wednesday week ; most
interest, of course, was in the meeting of Jack Hellings
and Percy Cavill in the 440vds. N.S.W. Championship.
Some seven men started, but Hellings and Cavill almost
at once got away from the others, and a grand struggle
ensued. The two raced neck and neck, down and up, up
and down : beginning the last lap Cavill by accident
kicked Hellings in the wind. This sad event settled
Hellings’ chance ; he struggled with all his wonted game-
ness, but was beaten by a couple of yards. He was so
done up that he had to be lifted out of the water. The
only lady-performer was “Connie” Stennett, infant
daughter of R. A. Stennett, of sporting name. The baby
did many clever feats ; one was rescuing her burly parent
from drowning; it was a practical illustration of the
mouse rescuing the lion.

Harry Lindgren, the sturdy No. 7 of several
Vic. interprovincial eights, is the latest oarsman to aban-
don amateurism and go over to the cash cyclists. If the
rule debarring cash cyclists is insisted upon, the cream of
Vic. rowing will soon be the spindle-shanked harrier
crowd who now hang round waiting for emergency seats
in maiden eights.

At Murchison (W.A.) part of the racecourse has
been taken up by a local gold-mining co., and the racing-
club applied to the manager thereof for permission to
hold the meeting as usual. The co.’s manager received
the application in a frame of mind that was partly festive
and partly grumpy, and consented on these terms :
T. That a sum of » 500 be forthwith paid to me.
2. That a screen 100 ft. high, formed of galvanized-iron
and impervious to sound, be erected across the company’s
property.
3. That a grand-stand be erected of stone, to contain
billiard-room, swimming-bath, and orchid-house, design
to be approved of by me and the same to become the pro-
perty of the company.
4. That a fence be erected round the property, to be
composed of round timber not less than 14ft. long and not
less than Bin. at the thin end ; to be connected with Bulli-
vant’s steel mining rope.
5. That a sum of £250 be paid to this company’s officers
for loss of time.
6. That free drinks and banquets be allowed officials of
the company and their friends during the carnival and
until further notice.
7. That no horse run without having his boiler tested.
8. That no yacht racing be permitted and that steam
launches do not exceed 20 miles an hour.
9. That no barges be moored in front of the company’s
residence.
10. That the officials be allowed to bet on any race after
the event.
11. That the monopoly of the three-card trick and
thimble-rig be exclusively the property of the officials of
the company.
12. That no clothes or towel-horse be allowed to run
under any circumstances whatever.
13. That all willy-willies, false starts, and scratchings
become the absolute property of the company.
14. That no “ jumping ” be allowed, and that as the
company holds the surface rights, no racing be allowed
above ground, as the company’s levels are most suitable
for flat racing.
15. That the club use their best endeavors to obtain the
discharge of all drunks, pickpockets, Ms.L.A., and others
arrested during the carnival.

A very quiet old Vic. civil-servant had a bull-
pup that he wanted to back for a chewing-match against
anything for any money. A well-known horse-trainer,
who thought he was simply picking up money, looked
round and found just the very thing. Dogs were brought
to him and his new purchase chewed them all up—neither
weight nor size could stop him. Money came like water,
and, in “Banjo’s” immortal words, that sport had
“ plenty of milk in his tea.” But when the dogs faced
each other the trainer’s pup simply wouldn’t show fight.
The secret was that he had been beaten by that same dog
three times running. The cunning crowd lost more than
£lOO over the deal.

The Walker’s Whisky Trophy, value 50 guineas,
is for 22-foot sailing-boats. The conditions are that it is
to be won first at Sydney in the Intercolonial Sailing Car-
nival, Jan. 23 ; secondly, at Brisbane in ’9B. Should a
different boat win on these occasions, the final is to be
sailed at Sydney in ’99. The winner in '97 will also secure
the Queen’s Ale Prize of 10 guineas.

The State Legislature of Indiana (U.S.A.) has
prohibited horse-racing for five months in the year.
Dear Bulletin, —In issue Oct. 17, “A.”
gives, as an instance of the late Julian Thomas’s
inaccuracy, his statement that the Liverpool to
London express stopped at Shrewsbury, and adds
“ that the absurdity of the yarn is heightened by
the fact that the express train had no lus ness
near Shrewsbury at all.” For some jea.-s I
travelled from Liverpool to London and invari-
ably called at Birkenhead, Chaster, Shrewsbury,
Wolverhampton, Birmingham and Oxford —in
fact, these stations must be passed by those using
the Great Western railway, as Beac-onsfield
usually did. Of course, travellers by the Great
Northern, Midland, or London and North-Western
lines would not go near Shrewsbury.—Salopian,
Fremantle.
Brisbane Magistrate Pinnock’s favorite
sentences are : for drunkenness, £2 or 48 hours ;
for drunk and disorderly, ss. or six hours ; aggra-
vated language, £3 or one month ; plain language,
£2 or 14 days. Most other magistrates are equally
erratic. A few sentences passed in Sydney last
week panned out as follows : £1 or seven days ; £1
or 14 days ; ss. or 21 days ; 255. or 21 days ; £2 or
two months; .£3 or two months; ,£5 or one
month; £5 or two months ; £2 or two months.
Why not pass a law setting forth exactly how
much imprisonment is equal to how much fine, so
that when the alternative is given it will be some-
thing like the same alternative every time?
Twenty-one days can’t be worth 255. in one case
and only ss. in the other.
Mr. Frank Farnell, M.L.A. of N.S.W.,
when interviewed at Sydney on his return from
London, apparently was most anxious to convey
that he was a modest man who loathed self-advt.
“While travelling,” he said, “several papers
asked me for interviews —in America they called
me a capitalist and a Minister of the Crown —and
at last 1 gave one to a weekly called the British
Australasian.” At last is good. The Bulletin
has been sent a card allegedly handed by this
shrinking violet of a politician to a business man
who met him at ’Ome. Here is a verbatim copy :

V.P.H.S., V.P.A.S., X.P.R.C.F., X.D.C.C.L.A.,
etc., says it is a lie that he ever expressed strong
Republican views. In England they offered him
a seat in the Commons, but who “ they ” were, or
which seat it was, Mr. Farnell doesn’t say.
His pet hobby is the Australian fishing industry,
to promote which, it appears, a .£200,000 com-
pany, with Mr. F. as managing director at £2OOO
a year, is or was on the tapis ; but the project
drags a little owing to the outrageous «ay in
which the promoter has been deceived by the
N.S.W. Govt. To continue supporting that
Government, which has so often deceived him,
says Mr. Farnell, would be foreign to his nature.
So he contemplates retiring from politics and
going into the fish business—oysters, he explains,
were worth 4s. 6d. a dozen when he was in Lon-
don, and prawns 3s. Gd. On the whole, The Bul-
letin congratulates the anti-Republican Farnell
on his determination to abandon politics and trade
in prawns.
Rumor hath it that Cartridge is to be reserved
for Summer Cup. This would seemingly prove a costly
experiment, as he appears to hold a mortgage on the
Villiers Stakes, whereas he has never shown any ability to
compass a mile and three-quarters. The public take
eight to one about this horse for the sprint race, and
won’t they just howl if they don’t get a run for their
money.

Melbourne Presbyterians contemplate

The night-train had stopped for a few
moments at a way-station, when a gawky

pipe, “That’s luck—ain’t out.” Somebody re-
marked, “You might have lost your life.” “Yes,
but I might have lost the pipe, and I only bor-
rowed it—see ! ” and he smiled and puffed away, a
hero in a small way.

measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection

Writes “ Nothing ” to The Bulletin :
I am told it is easily possible to ascertain the fate and
find the remains of the missing Lamont Young and party, |
and solve the “Bermagui Mystery.” The searchers
hitherto made the most “nohow” enquiries and were
easily put off the scent. The fact is that, just after the
disappearance of Young, the Bermagui camp and all the
surrounding district were in a state of terrorism in respect
of the crime, for crime it was and no mistake. Whenever
any digger, in his cups, hinted that he “ could speak more
if he liked ” —you know the sort of thing I mean—that
digger would be himself “missing” in a day or two.
Several cases like that occurred, and men became wise.
There was much gold being got, but men kept their
mouths shut as to how much. Young courted his fate by
always being too ready to flash his gold, he being a large
gold-buyer. To-day, Bermagui field is practically
deserted, and, at any rate, the district is “safe.” Were
any keen-brained man to go up there along with one of the
old residents who remembered all about everything—
there must be many, since I, a stranger to Bermagui,
know several —he might “ find out.” Is there still out the
Government reward of £2OO ? If so, that fact should in-
duce someone to follow up this hint. Further, for any
guidance :It was murder. The murder was committed
on one side of the river; the boat was taken out and
beached far away on the other side of the river—bottomed
up, and rifle-bullet holes shot in the ribs. That simple
manoeuvre seems to have fooled all the sleuth-hounds !
For the rest, terrorism kept the local residents and diggers
reticent, for there was evidently an unknown gang to fear.
The actual murderer was known right enough.—P.S.—No
fuss was made about the loose-tongued diggers who went
“missing” (by the way, the ferryman also); they were
nobodies and were simply “counted out” of the few
thousands of folk on the rush.

A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been "'ceived, and maybe seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for thtse health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his, own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W, A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common?” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and
Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
course of your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, 1 consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you. —Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus; To Herr Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir, —1 think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKIIAM.

To Herb R'SSMUSSEn,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform you that
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. hUTTON
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness: A. F. Fekkr, Manager, Grand Hotel, Spring-

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Testimonial.
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that your
celebrated Alfaline Pills cured me, when all other reme-
dies and doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of
18 years’ standing. Dear Sir, I shall recommend your
Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I come across. Anyone

To Herr Rassmussen.
I am jubilant to inform you that your wonderful Alfa-

plaint,; and that, although lam now over 70 years of age,
1 feel as strong as any young man, and shall always be

Skin and Blood Cured.
Canning Mills, Canning, Western Australia.
To Herr Wasmussbn.
I am pleased to inform you that vour Alfaline Blood
Pills completely cured me. Previous to taking your
Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trving your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can
testify to. I have recommended your Alfaline Herbal
Remedies to several of my friends, who have reason to be
very grateful for it. —Yours gratefully, J. NERYIN.
Blood Cured.
Parkes Range, Southern Cross, W.A.
I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Blood Pills completely cured me of a serious blood affec-
tion of three years’ standing. I shall always be glad to
recommend your Alfaline Remedies to my friends.—Yours
gratefully, JAMES NELSON WILLIAMS.
A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney T had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.

A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled wit h them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who hiess the day I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave tne from continuous
suffering. J- KILLERIDGE,
Lucsnow, N.S.W.
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal V ind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.
—Yours truly,
WILLIAM HANSON,

HERS EASSMUSSEN’S
PR€SS : OPINIONS
referring to
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
Sydney Bulletin.— “ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of pertormin„
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
livening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has
shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-
fying to important cures effected by his remedies.

wonderful Herbal Alfaline Remedies have done more good
than all other known remedies put together.
N.Z. Times, Wellington.— “ Herr Rassmussen manu-
factures some excellent Blood and Nerve Remedies.
Unity Telegraph, Launceston, Tas.— “Herr Rass-
mussen is a clever botanist."
S.A. Register, Adelaide, S.A.—“Herr Rassmussen’s

botanist, and the bona fides of his testimonials appear to
be well established.”
Cooktown Courier, Queensland. — “ Herr Rassmus-

colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”
Flashes (Society Paper), Brisbane, Q.— “ Herr Rass-
mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-
cognitions of the most important scientific authorities.
Chemist ami llrugitfst Journal* Melbourne.—
“Herr Rassmussen has opened a branch depot at lou
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and his Alfaline Pills will pro-
bably become as well known in Viotoria as they are in
New South Wales.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanical remedies.”
Sydney Trnf* . — “ Herr Rassmussen is sufficiently well
known not to r quire any additionally praise from Truth.
His remedies are simply wonderful.”
Sunday Times. Sydney.—“lt may not be out of
place to mention that Herr Rassmussen has now been be-
fore the public for over ten years.”
N.Z. Mail, Wellington.— “ We have among us at the
present time one of Australia's foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney.”
The Australian Workman, Sydney.—“ Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the world, we
are assured that Herr Rassmussen’s Alfaline Remedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Word Anstralisclic Zeitung, Brisbane.—“We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-
amined letters from all parts of the world, we are satisfied
that he is deserving of universal thanks.”
Australian Star, Sydney— “ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales and Australia.

to show the esteem Herr Rassmussen is held in by those
who have the best opportunity to watch his career.

A. J. Compton’s “ Malays, Game Fowls,
and Bantams,’’ just issued, with many illustra-
txons, by Geo. Robertson and Co., is the standard
Australian book on the subject.
A backblocks (Q.) town which had suffered
from a three months’ drought was proposing to
pray for rain. A local farmer, hearing of the pro-
position, wrote indignantly to the Bugaboo Star
m protest. “Why, Mr. Editor,” he wrote, “I
got an acre and a-half of wheat in just now, and if
there was rain for the next few days through
them 1 harisees a-praying the whole blame crop
would be spoiled ! ”
A Recommendation. —Medical men throughout
the world are extolling the merits of Frossard’s
Cavour Cigars, a mild, fragrant, and delicious
smoke, free from nicotine, and retaining all the
fragranoH of the leaf ; being obtainable in packets
or o tor Is, they are within the reach of all.*
The N.S. W. “ Mountain Mystery,” if pro-
ductive of no other result, will be of great assist-
ance to the Government Statistician, as proving
the large number of people who go prospecting.
So far, just about 153 persons had entered into
negotiations with Butler, but something prevented
them going, which only shows what a beastly
adventurous and speculative people we are. Of
the number who went, no reliable figures can be
quoted the returns are coming in slowly.
Some fine shipments of the well-known
Rambler bicycles have just reached N.S.W. and
Queensland. The Rambler is one of the most
serviceable and reliable cycles on the market, and
the man or woman who wants to buy a wheel for
speed and safety should not make a purchase until
he or she has examined a Rambler.*
Visitors to Sydney, who desire all the
comforts and good feelings of a home, should stay
at the Hotel Australia. This is the finest hotel
in the .Southern Hemisphere, not because its
appointments are the best, its position the best,
its lighting, baths, &c., &c., the most modern, but
because the charge, 12s. 6d. per day upwards, is
within reach of everybody possessing reasonable
means A good holiday can be ruined by a bad
hotel, but a good hotel makes a good holiday all
the more enjoyable.*

Union exhibition is open to the publio at the

Tke sterling merits of the Yost typewriter,
and the magnitude of its sales, place this machine
first, and the rest nowhere. The public through-
out the five Australian provinces are adopting it
and all the experts speak of the “beautiful work
of the Yost.’’ It has no troublesome ink-ribbon •
its type strike the paper direct, producing the
cleanest and sharpest of impressions. The United
Typewriter and Supplies Co., sole agents for
Sydney Melb. and Perth, have furnished Yosts
to the Westralian Governor, the various colonial
Govt. Depts., newspaper offices, leading banks
insurance co’s, commercial firms, &c., &c.*
The triennial travelling scholarship offered
to students at Melb. National Gallery falls this
time to George Coates, for a picture somewhat
reminiscent-of Longstaff’s “Breaking the News.”
Coates gives a gloomy treatment of the prize
subject At Last. A stockman, badly injured
by a fall from his horse, lies upon a mattress in
his hut. bully dressed in moleskins, Crimean
shirt, leggings, etc., the sufferer, with one leg
drawn up convulsively, has a death-tinted face
Anxious wife in the background, and elderly male
friend holding the groaner’s wrist. Doctor hust-
ling through the doorway. A strong work at the
most important points, faulty in the background
scheme, but fairly entitled to the prize. Miss
Dora Meeson’s cheerful picture of a miner bursting
into his domestic circle with a nugget which he
has just struck, takes second place from only three
other competitors.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.

pimples, blotches, roughness, redness, and all dis-
figurements. Sulpholine developes a lovelv skin.

One Gunther, of Melbourne, has given the
world an antidote to those wearisome young men
who get invariably kicked off the premises by
their best girls’ papas. The other night, when
Gunther brought Miss Maud Lobb home from a
moonlight ramble to the parental roof, he was
more or less insulted and assaulted by the “old
man.” Whereupon he pasted Lobb pttre (under
the patronage of all the lady members of the
family) until his father-in-law-elect streamed with
gore. Also a charge of “unlawfully wounding ”
brought by Lobb against his daughter’s admirer
resulted in a moral victory for the accused. This
is rather hard upon , the everlasting music-hall
ditty, in which Augustus always comes to grief
and woe. The bull-dawg that lurks on the other
side of the wall, waiting to seize ’Gustus by the
seat of his pants, is under a cloud in Melbourne
for the present.
The controversy about the danger to health
of some of the sewer-ventilators of Svdney sug-
gests the question of legal liability in the event of
proved'injury. Recently, at Birmingham (Eng.)
Assizes the executors of one Thomas Smith sued
the District Council for £lO,OOO damages in re
his death, which resulted from blood-poisoning,
the alleged consequence of a defective sewer-
ventilator. The jury returned a verdict for £3500.

One day last week a baby was left on the
doorstep of the W.C.T.U. building, Melbourne.
Pinned to the bundle was a piece of paper in-
scribed : “ Please take care of my child, because
I cannot find a home for it. Good-bye. I am a
poor girl of 16, who has fallen.” Women
Christians and social purists in general may as
well wait for further evidence re the age and
history of this baby-depositor, ere taking the
above statement for granted. The “girl of 16 ”
is perhaps a respectable middle-aged matron or
widow, who loved not wisely in a moment of weak-
ness caused by too much reading of Eamily
Herald supplements.

“Papa’s Hair.”
A
A gentleman has sent us the following :—“ A few
weeks ago I bought a bottle of your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’
and it has acted with the most satisfactory results.
Previous to doing so, my hair had a mousey color
streaked with grey. The dear children would try
to count papa’s grey hairs, but, because of the
number, could not succeed. Being only 44 years
of age, I determined to improve my hair, and tried
your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’ and am pleased to write that,
though at first there seemed little difference, gradu-
ally the hair regained its original color (there was
no dyeing whatever) and it is now strong and glossy.
I asked my little daughter this morning to count
my grey hairs, hut when looking for them she cried
ou t —‘ Why, papa, there are no white hairs; mamma
must have pulled them all out.’ ”
rg" This Preparation is not a Dye, but acts gradu-
ally on the Roots of the Hair, and restores Grey
Hair to its natural color and lustre.
No preparation will make hair grow better than
“Papa’s Hair.”
It effectually prevents the formation of Dandriff,
as it is called,'the presence of which always denotes
diseased action in the cuticle of the scalp, causing
premature baldness, or a falling off of the hair.
DIRECTIONS.—WeII shake the bottle, and with
a small piece of sponge rub into the roots of the
hair ni'dit and morning, till the hair is restored to
its natural color ; aftervi ards apply twice a week.

the miserable, sinful comp, dropped “ years’ ex-
perience ”on the floor. Anyhow, what the advt.
says is simply that the lady has had 20.

They are telling a story in London of a
South African diamond merchant who, after
struggling to get into the social swim, was at last
rewarded with a card to a very swell function.
Before the shivoo came off, however, the invitee
got mixed up with a discreditable police-court
matter, and when he was told that there was a
possibility of his invitation being withdrawn, he
remarked “ Dey can’t do it; dey can’t do it. I
haf send it to Zomerzet House and got it stambed,
und it is now a gontract.”
The second chapter of the story of that
British major who died fighting against big odds
in Matabelelarid (vide “Cheer, Boys, Cheers ”),
the time when they started singing the Gnashional
Anthem after the ammunition gave out, is now
published. A scout found the remains of the
major, dead and full of spears arid glory and bits
of unfinished anthem, and when he returned to
England he called on the dead officer’s fiancee
and told the story with such pathos that
he and the bereaved lady were married the
other day in Scotland. The local paper said the
event was surrounded by “ a halo of romance.” If
you can’t marry the man of your choice, the next
best thing is to marry the man who found his
body. That’s romance, and the halo comes in
just there.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman', the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extendi rig over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guararitee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
That long, gushful weakling, ex-Premier
Shiels, lately poured himself forth for over four
hours in Vic. Assembly, the State Bank Bill
being what was the matter with him. He was
very ill at the time, and had to discourse sitting
down; if he had been in good health the general
impression is that he wouldn’t have left off till he
uttered all his vitals and left them on the table.
In a general way, he was against everything, not
wholly on Conservative grounds, but maiuly be-
cause Shiels is a fluent, nervous, shattered man, j
too badly scared to attempt anything new for fear
it is loaded and may go off unexpectedly. Also,
he has a habit of seeing simultaneously all the 74
ways of doing anything, and the 92 ways of
leaving it undone, and the 1187 dangers that may
arise if it is done in any of these 74 ways; and
when he has explained all these things at full
length he invariably advises that it be left a little
longer, and shudders himself away into the corner
where he and his shadow keep each other com-
pany. Poor William Shiels is a walking streak of
fluency and nerves and indecision and wasted
learning, with a vast amount of natural goodness
washing about loose in a sea of eloquence, and a
shaky cough on top of all. Shiels is too good in
many ways for this world, but he ought to make a
very excellent, but undecided, angel in a better
sphere.

Mining yarn from W.A. A shaft was
going down vertically, and above it a whip was
rigged to do the hoisting per horse. Bill was
down below filling dirt (it is so obvious that the
man below must be Bill that this fact is hardly
worth mentioning), and his mate, Jim, was on top
—otherwise the story wouldn’t be complete. Sud-
denly something went wrong with the works, and
the iron-bound tub and 100 feet of rope dived
down the shaft with a crash. It was so sudden
that Jim didn’t even manage to call out the usual
“look out,” and the death of Bill seemed for a
moment too obvious to be worth talking about.
Then suddenly there rose from below a calm,
blasphemous voice—the voice of Bill —and the
words it used were: “ Say, throw down the
blessed horse too, when you’re at it.”
A German surgeon the other day removed
for cancer seven-eighths of the stomach of a
woman 58 years old, and sewed the two ends
together to form a new stomach the size of a hen’s
egg. The same evening the woman actually swal-
lowed and digested some milk and egg, took
a deal of milk food next day, and in a few
weeks left the hospital 221 b. heavier than she
entered it. This is the stomach-cutting record.
Lord Kenyon wound up his sentence on a
butler, convicted of stealing his master’s wine, in
the following unapproachable strain :
Dead to every claim of natural affection, and blind to
your own real interest, you burst through all the re-
straints of religion and morality, and have for many
years been feathering your nest with your master’s
bottles.
About 200 aboriginals recently had a battle
near Kalgoorlie. -They represented two hostile
tribes, almost equal in number. The fight lasted
two hours, during which period the air was thick
with waddies, boomerangs, and spears, and the
slaughter consisted of two men slightly damaged.
Like the Chinaman, the Australian aboriginal is
pretty harmless when he fights ; his most danger-
ous aspect is when he is at peace and gets to
windward, so that the germs blow off him.
A little romance comes from an inebriate
retreat down South. There are two people at
least in every romance ; one of them, in the pre-
sent instance, was a drinky capitalist—a young
man who inherited the pile and the family thirst
together, and who, in a moment of unusual bril-
liance, decided to winter in the retreat, with a
view to sobering up. There he met the other
party to the romance ; she was 27, golden-haired,
and beautiful, barring a transient flush about the
nose, and she was also sobering up. They fell in
love, and resisted their thirst together, and
exchanged experiences, and swore-off for each
other’s sake, and it was agreed that, when they
had kept off long enough to acquire confidence in
themselves, they would marry. The flush disap-
peared off her nose and his beer-pimples faded
away, and they both grew young again. Then
they quitted the institution, married, and started
on their honeymoon. The trouble which naturally
ensued began just 10 days later, at a certain
fashionable hotel. The bridegroom was out one
evening, and the bride was restless, and wandered
about the establishment as if she was looking for
something. This was at 8 p.m., and about
midnight the waiter laboriously carried upstairs to
her bedroom an armful of soft flounces and an in-
sensible bride with the flush returned to her nose.
She had been found lying in a passage with a bottle
in her hand and her head hanging downstairs.
The landlady and other sympathetic females
gathered round and wondered how they would
break the news to her poor husband. Somebody
with great presence of mind went out to look for
the poor husband and tell him about it, but as he
rushed down the front steps he fell over a heap of
something, and came down whack. The heap was
trying to unlock the pavement with its hat and
singing softly to itself. It was the bridegroom, of
course. With the beautiful unity of two lovin’
souls they had got the old thirst simultaneously,
and had fallen at the same time, and in beer they
were not divided.

W. J. DOUGLAS, Manager.
Business, Bobbery, &c.
Mr. G. E. Ardill forwards the balance-sheets of
the hydra-headed Sydney charitable society of which he
is director; and, though the charity seems to be plentiful,
the balance-sheets leave a good deal to be desired. Occa-
sionally some of them skip a year, and two years’ accounts
are rolled into one ; and occasionally one pops up at only a
six-months interval. Further, in some 14 years, during
which Mr. Ardill has been running the show, there seems
only to have been one definite attempt to sum up assets
and liabilities, and that was when the original Ardill
enterprise was, as it were, floated into a co. six years
ago. The “ balance-sheets ” consist merely of a state-
ment of receipts and expenditure; and exactly how
the society, or any of it, stands in the matter of sol-
vency doesn’t appear. No less than eight charity agencies
apparently flourish or otherwise under one management:
the Home of Hope, Open All-Night Refuge, Woman’s
Crusade, Jubilee Home, Discharged Prisoners’ Mission,
Babies’ Home, Liverpool Home for Orphans, and Camden
Home for Boys, and the funds of the first five are all
lumped together in an indistinguishable heap. The last
two apparently issue a cash account of their own, and it
is vaguely understood that the Babies’ Home is lumped
with one section or the other, but after painstaking search
this paper can’t say decisively where the infants’ cash re-
poses. According to the report of the main batch of societies
to 31st Aug., 1895, which is the last to hand, Government
contributed, between Ist March, ’94, and 31st Aug., ’95,
£1734 in subsidy ; but it does not appear that Govt,
exercises any supervision over expenditure, or is repre-
sented on the committee, or audits the cash-account, or
endeavors to sort the funds out of the heap, or does any-
thing else which might reasonably be hoped for. Director-
of-Oharities Maxted, however, reported on most of the
charities in March, ’93, and found things fairly satisfac-
tory ; and at Aug., ’95, the society was still printing
favorable extracts from his report (without any date
attached), as an evidence of good faith.
The Sydney Rescue Work Society, which is
vaguely understood to run the whole heap of institutions,
took over Ardill’s charitable work in March, 1890. Mr.
Ardill’s zeal was partly demonstrated by the fact that
there had accumulated a large quantity of debts, and he
even seems to have owed himself £507 for money
advanced during seven years. Why the Sydney Rescue
Work Society should have taken over the debts as well as
Ardill doesn’t appear, but it did take over a considerable
quantity of them, and up to the date of last report it
seems to ’ have labored with one eye to charity
and the other to working off the dead horse.
So late as Feb., ’95, a Govt, grant is announced as being
devoted to the payment of “ old debts ” —presumably
those incurred before 1890.
Altogether, there are quite a lot of interesting
points about the Ardill institutions—one of them being
that Mr. George Verey, a member of committee of the
Society for Providing Homes for Neglected Children, is
seemingly identical with a Mr. George Verey who con-
sistently audits the committee’s own balance-sheet.

Writes “Snapshot’ from Tasmania: “We are
on the eve of a mining boom—we always are. Almost in
every newspaper we hear of some new find. It is really
very easy to find reefs in Tasmania —easier than at Cool-
gardie, where nine out of ten are blows. In our reefs you
invariably find colors. There is consequently great ex-
citement. All the surrounding country is immediately
pegged out. As a rule it remains pegged out for months
and even years, till the pegs become old and rotten and
the notices are washed away. Then some poor fellow,
prospecting in what he considers eligible country, on
finding a color and applying for a lease is confronted by
a yawning apparition who sternly says “It’s my lease. 5 ’
Then the apparition goes to bed after seeing his notice
renovated. A lease once pegged out in Tasmania remains
more or less pegged out practically for ever, whether it is
worked or not. Consequently, in this Land of Sleep-a-
Lot, the real boom is a long while coming. I never yet
saw a properly-equipped prospecting party in Tasmania,
or one which seemed in real earnest.”
* * * *
How some English co’s are managed in Wes-
tralia. One 40-acre lease, writes a Bulletin correspon-
dent, has two shafts down, one working—three shifts of
four men each. It has a whim-boy and (don’t laugh) a
groom. There are also in course of erection a 10-head
battery of obsolete pattern and a toy winding-gear about
the size of a little steamer’s crab winch, but as the
machinery is being erected by contract the manager is
not called upon to exercise his vast brain on anything but
the mine. To manage this great concern there is a
manager at £l5OO a year, appointed in England (by the
way - ; the battery and toy winch were also appointed in
England, probably from some junk yard); a clerk at £6
a week, appointed by the manager, who had no trouble
in picking him, as he is the manager’s cousin ; and a
mining manager at £7 or £8 a week. All these get, in
addition, water and quarters. The £l5OO a year manager
uses hair-oil, keeps a black servant, and has nothing to do
except steady his hand once a fortnight to write his
report and sign the pay-sheet. Why does not mining in
W.A. pay?

Sharebroking— lts Abuses and their Cure,”
by J. Wilson Reid, of Melbourne, is a treatise with many
amusing assumptions popping up in its midst. For
instance—“ The scale of charges, as commission, for buy-
ing and selling shares is not loyally adhered to, and con-
sequently the dishonest jobbing broker takes advantage
of his fellow members to gain and keep business by
cutting rates.” This strikes one as an Abuse which the
public would prefer to see stalking along its wicked way,
un-cured and unmolested. And, by the way, J. Wilson
Reid asks in a loud tone of voice—“ Why should a man
who advertises himself as a broker not give a guarantee
as well as an auctioneer ? The two positions are not dis-
similar.” What guarantee does an auctioneer give that
he will not settle his liabilities with Id. in the £ ? Vide
recent remarks in The Bulletin.

A correspondent sends along a circular purport-
ing to be issued by a firm of London sharebrokers who are
apparently looking for flats in this guileless country. It
invites all manner of people to forward any amount of
money for the firm to speculate with on the stock ex-
change, the profits being remitted regularly. The profits
for September alone, it ’seems, were 5 per cent., and for
the first nine months of the year 56 per cent. The firm
expects that the profits for the whole year will be about
92 per cent., the same as last year. The firm never makes
lossesj apparently, and investors can rely on about
doubling their money every year. It could, of course,
swindle them if it liked ; no one knows what the money
is invested in, and ail it need do is to annex the remit-
tance, and write back that the coin was unfortunately
lost, or not write back at all; but it never does such
things. Why a firm should waste its life making 90 per
cent, profits for other people instead of for itself is a
question which the average flat seldom considers. The
discretionary investment business is a very old and
idiotic and transparent affair, but considering the
success of a man who went round Australia a few years
ago getting payment in advance for alleged Servian bonds
it ought to pay well in this new and fresh country.

A well-known Sydney commercial man has a
terrace of houses, let at £1 19s. lid. each. If they were
let at £2 a 2d. stamp would have to be put on each
receipt; by reducing a penny, he saves stamp-duty. Also,
if a tenant pays two weeks’ rent at once, he will get two
separate receipts, the landlord candidly admitting that
two receipt-forms are cheaper than a 2d. stamp.
* * * *
It has leaked out that one man has been the cause
of numerous retail failures in one Australian city for some
years past. He and his nominees have long been playing
a most flourishing long-firm game, but this promises to
be stopped. He is a man of good means and in business.
He would fix upon his nominee, and advance him, say,
£5O to start with. The latter would magnify this into
£l5O. Credit was easily obtainable in consequence of the
cut-throat competition amongst the wholesalers. Pay-
ments would continue prompt for a few months and pur-
chases would steadily increase. Gradually the account
would get further and further behind, and then the crash;
liabilities about £BOO ; assets —stock not more than £75 —
div. next to nothing. The small stock is easily accounted
for, as the chief robber used to buy goods at half cost
from the nominee. These would go to stock the next ven-
ture. And so the game went on. Emboldened by success,
a more daring game was played. The chief robber would
buy out the nominee at a pre-arranged price, and
creditors simply had to take whatever was offered. The
frequency of these sales aroused the ire of the whole-
salers, who at last refused to accept the composition, but
forced the defaulter into insolvency. The proceedings
there gave the game away, but there being no direct
evidence to incriminate the chief culprit, he goes on his
way untouched.
* * * *
Pritchard Morgan, once a Q’sland lawyer, who
has long adventured in mining, goes to boom China at
the invitation of Li Hung Chang. The game has been
played before. Some years ago a Chinese Commission
with a big retinue of servants travelled through the U.S.
to pick up mining men, plant, and some money. An ex-
pedition went out, had a good time, spent a barrel of
money, but found no payable gold. It strikes one that
John, who can be found on more than half the tailings-
heaps and old alluvial fields of Australasia, working other
people’s leavings, is quite up to working gold in his own
country.
* * * *
One John J. Horrocks, to satisfy “numerous
applications,” has given his observations of the Westra-
lian goldfields. He is surprised that people 3000 miles
away should “glibly talk pessimistically with an assump-
tion of knowledge of the present condition and future
prospects of W.A.” He has seen the most perfect bat-
teries and ore-reduction plants being taken piecemeal by
camel and horse-teams through the desert—machinery
which, in the majority of cases, never would have been
shipped at the enormous expense had not preliminary
trials of the mines to which it was consigned justified the
expenditure. “At the present time 20,000 tons of
machinery is on its way to the Kalgoorlie district for the
proprietary claims alone.” These two “observations”
are quite enough to squelch Horrocks. Yet it is “ yab-
ber” like this, made at the right time and printed in the
right place, which makes a boom. All the machinery on
all the mines at Charters Towers would not amount to
the quantity which, according to Horrocks, is on the way
to one oo.’s mines. Had Horrocks contented himself by
saying Westralia was a great place for the tin-meat man
he would have been less laughed at.

“Anxious ” is told by the Sabbath tipster that
the General Gordon is a remarkably good mine, having an
immense body of ore which will go 2oz. to 3oz. to the ton,
and all the disparaging reports are mere idle rumor. The
same paper says the ore body is 43ft. wide and it will
average 3oz. That is the Boulder average with a much
smaller lode ! Ninety per cent, at least of the great
things said of new mines are false, and-more than 90 per
cent, of the bad things said of any undeveloped mine are
as true as gospel. All unprejudiced people who have seen
this over-boomed mine tell the same story to the writer.
It is time the directors had the General Gordon examined
by some expert in W.A. in whom the public have con-
fidence.

A North-West Queensland town. In the main
street stands a wretched specimen of a bush pub.—iron
walls, iron roof, and hardly a dray-load of sawn timber in
the whole concern. If sold to-morrow the shanty
wouldn’t realise £l5O. Yet on this wretched tin-pot
caboose a certain bank advanced something like £lBOO
some few years ago, and it is still owing.
• * * *
The sulphuric acid contained in the fumes from
Mt. Lyell smelting works is already killing the timber in
the vicinity. It is also eating holes in galvanized-iron
roofing, and otherwise making the place a desirable resort
to stay away from. In view of the number of “ leaded ”
miners likely to be sent hopelessly adrift during the next
few years from this mine ajone, shareholders should make
a name for their “ good thing ’’ by subsidising a big in-
surance fund for the benefit of their incapacitated em-
ployes. Failing this, Govt, should impose a dividend tax
for the purpose.

Oh, the crash that must come ! In Broad Arrow
the other day, Govt, sold 84 town sections for a total of
£12,500. Within a radius of 10 miles of Broad Arrow
there has not been an ounce of reef gold got for the last
year, and, at the wildest computation, not lOOoz. of allu-
vial. Yet shops and hotels are being built wholesale,
and the local paper has lately teemed with applications
for licenses. Certainly there are four batteries going up
which may turn out gold, but

Lowles, English M.P. and boomer of Imperial
Federation, is booming Westralia in London. (Lowles,
who was accurately sized-up as a pompous windbag by
Australians during his visit here, has, since his return to
England, brought down the utmost ridicule upon himself
by professing to be the personal confidant of Lord Salis-
bury re the Eastern question.) There isany amount of gold,
he says ; the problem is to save it. “ I saw myself a bat-
tery made by an eminent firm of engineers,'with great
raw plates ” (they are usually cooked) “ without ripples or
any other extra appliance for catching the gold, which
was for all practical purposes positively worthless. It did
not give the ore a chance, and saved perhaps only a fifth
or sixth of the gold. Of course, the density of the water,
some containing 33 per cent, of salt, accounts for a deal
of trouble.” Lowles is a useful person in a boom, Ripples
are no part of plates, and can be added to a battery for
10 bob each. Water cannot hold 33 per cent, of salt. Pure
brine contains less salt.

Dept, to applications for Govt, stamp mills : “ There is a

used for public crushing is contemplated by private enter-
prise.”

“Refractory ores” have hitherto been the explanation

dividends resulting. Disappointed new chunis have had
to leave upon the field thousands of tons of mining
machinery to be sacrificed. Now two banks, seven hotels,

other storekeepers are left to compete for what could be

Dad and the Two Donovans .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A sweltering summer’s afternoon. A heat that
curled and withered the very weeds. The corn-
blades drooping, sulking still. Mother and Sal
ironing, mopping their faces with a towel and
telling each other how hot it was. The dog
stretched across the door-way. A child’s bonnet
on the floor—the child out in the sun. Two horse-
men approaching the slip-rails.
Dad had gone down the gully to Farmer, who
had been sick for four days. The ploughing was
at a stand still in consequence, as we had only two
draught-horses. Dad erected a shelter over him,
made of boughs, to keep the sun off. Two or
three times a day he cut green stuff for him—
which the cows ate. He humped water to him
which he sullenly refused to drink ; and did all in
his power to persuade Farmer to get up and go on
with the ploughing. I don’t know if Dad knew
anything of mesmerism, but he used to stand for
long intervals dumbly staring the old horse full in
the eyes till in a commanding voice he would bid
him “Getup!” But Farmer lacked the patriotism
of the backblock poets. He was obdurate, and
not once did he even awake, not to mention
“ arise.”
This afternoon as Dad approached his dumb
patient he suddenly put down the bucket of
water which he was carrying and ran, shouting
angrily. A flock of crows flew away from Farmer
and “ cawed ” from a tree close by. Dad was ex-
cited, and when he saw that one of the animal’s
eyes was gone and a stream of blood trickled over
its nose he sat down and hid his face in his big
rough hands.
“ Caw, caw,” came from the tree.
Dad rose and looked up.
you ! ” he hissed—“you black wretches
of hell!”
“ Caw, caw, caw.”
He ran towards the tree as though he would
hurl it to the ground, and away flew the crows.
Joe arrived.
“ W-w-wuz they at him, Dad ? ”
Dad turned on him, trembling with rage.
Oh, you son of the Devil ! ” he commenced.
You worthless pup, you. Look there ! Do you
sec that? ” (He pointed to the horse.) Didn’t I
tell you to mind him? Didn .”
“Yes, but s-s-someone’s dog had a k-k-k-an-
geroo bailed up.”
“ Damn you, be off out of this!” And Dad
aimed a block of wood at Joe which struck him on
the back as he made away. But nothing short of
two broken legs would stop Joe, who the next
instant had dashed among the corn like an emu
into a scrub.
Dad returned to the house, foaming and vowing
to take the gun and shoot Joe down like a waf-
Jaby. But when he saw two horses hanging up
he hesitated and would have gone away again had
mother not called out that he was wanted. He
went in reluctantly.
Red Donovan and his son, Mick, were there.
Donovan was the publican, butcher, and horse-
dealer at the Overhaul. He was reputed to be
well-in, though some said that if everybody had
their own he wouldn’t be worth much. He was a
glib-tongued Irishman who knew everything—or
fondly imagined he did—from the law to horse-
surgery. There was money to be made out of
selections, he reckoned, if selectors only knew how
to make it—the majority, he proclaimed, didn’t
know enough to get under a tree when it rained.
Asa dealer, he was a hard nut, never giving more
than a “ tenner ” for a ,£2O beast, or selling a £lO
one for less than £2O. And few knew Donovan
better than did Dad, or had been taken in by him
oftener ; but on this occasion Dad was in no easy
or benevolent frame of mind.
He sat down, and they talked of crops and the
weather, and beat about the bush until Donovan
said:—
«‘‘ Ha ye y° u any fat Steers to sell? ” Dad hadn’t.
But, ’he added, “ I can sell you a horse.”
Which one ? asked Donovan, for he knew the
horses as well as Dad did—perhaps better.
“ The bay—Farmer.”
“ How much ? ”
“Seven pounds.” Now, Farmer was worth
£ll, if worth a shilling—f.e., before he took sick—
and Donovan knew it well.
. “ Seven,”he repeated, ponderingly. “ Give you
six.”
Never before did Dad show himself such an
expert in dissimulation. He shook his head
knowingly, and enquired of Donovan if he would
take the horse for nothing.
“ Split the difference, then—make it six-ten ? ”
Dad rose and looked out the window.
“ There he is now,” he remarked, sadly, “in the
gully there.”
“Well, what’s it to be—six-ten or nothing?”
renewed Donovan.
“All right, then,” Dad replied, demurely,
take him.”
The money was paid there and then and re-
ceipts drawn up. Then saying that Mick would
come for the horse on the day following, and after
offering a little gratuitous advice on seed-wheat
and pig-sticking, the Donovans left.
* * * *
Mick came the next day, and Dad showed
him Farmer, under the bushes. He wasn’t dead,
because when Joe sat on him he moved. “ There
he is,” said Dad, grinning.
Mick remained seated on his horse, bewildered-
looking, staring first at Farmer, then at Dad.
“ Well ? ” Dad remarked, still grinning. Then
Mick spoke feelingly.
“You swindling old crawler!” he said, and
galloped away. It was well for him he got a good
start.
* * * *
For long after that we turned the horses
and cows into the little paddock at night, and if
ever the dog barked Dad would jump up and go
out in his shirt.
We put them back into the big paddock again,
and the first night they were there two cows and a
four-year-old bullock got out and went away, tak-
ing with them the chain that fastened the slip-
rails. We have never seen or heard of them since.

The novelist Tschernischeffsky has been
in prison at Astrachan for over 40 years because
he wrote two romances in the year ’5O. There was
nothing particularly objectionable about them,

up until he found out what he was driving at.
Jben he got tired and forgot all about him, and
Ischernischeffsky'has stayed in gaol ever since.
N. : “ Thy gold perish with thee ! ” Thus
said the indignant apostle to Simon Magus, but it
is not a way they have in the Salvation Army,
they freeze on to the gold. Melb. has the law-
case of Buntine v. the Army. Here a “pro-
moted ” member, known as Holy Bob, diverted
away £2OOO by will from his children to this
religious organisation. One might think it would
refuse to take the money. But, no. The Devil’s
brigade is summoned up for real fighting. No
hallelujahs, but the cold, cruel steel of the legal
bayonet. Ho not to law before the unbelievers.”
Oh, pooh ! Two thousand quid. Yet they will
lose double as much through giving rope for
Purves to charge women-officers and other women
of the organisation specifically with immorality,
while the Judge contemptuously says the question
is not whether Holy Bob was moral, but whether
he was sane.
Jacob Lichtscheindl, of Pfahlert’s Hotel,
gives tne most recklessly-prodigal free-luncli show
ill bydney. With its sixpenn’orth of beer on
baturday mornings the crowd puts away (among
dozens of other items) as many as 20 large boiled
turkeys. The other day a free-luncher pounced
on one of these fat and helpless birds and com-
placently hacked off the breast and a leg, which he
was complacently carrying to a table, when some-
body jolted his elbow and the delicious morsels
fell to the floor, where they were, amidst the jeers
of the assemblage, instantly grabbed by a large
dog. ihe jaw of that free-luncher fell so far that
a gloom settled on the assemblage until a man
came in and, after viewing the wild turkey-rush,
• L j - y ’ haven>t you any soup ? ” He wasn’t
satisfied with the prospect of getting a turkey, a
1-nnt of beer, a table-full of other provender, a knife
and fork and plate, and a place to sit down in—
all for sixpence. Which shows how much grati-
tude there is in the world. Also, when a free-
feeder proceeded to wipe his hands on a snowy
tablecloth and was expostulated with by a waiter
he exclaimed: “ Well, why don’t you provide
serviettes ! ”
A Dissolution of Partnership.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They were old trackers. In Tasmania there are
no “swagmen” or “travellers” —they are all.
“ trackers,” whether male or female, old or young.
A windfall in the guise of a broken wheelman
had given them the necessary price of two beers,
and a ten-mile tramp supplied the unnecessary
thirst. The beers and old identities were being
discussed in the verandah of the pub. at The Dive
Corners.
Derwent Nugget and Barracouta had been mates
for two years. The former had “tracked” the
main road before, aye, hundreds of times. Barra-
couta was a comparative stranger in parts there-
abouts. Half-a-mile back they had passed the
ruins of a public-house, where, in a paddock ad-
joining, a weary-looking man was desultorily
looking for hens’-nests among the briar bushes.
The Nugget took a long drink, and tenderly
set his pint-pot down on the seat beside him.
“ That old bloke back yonder could tell a proper
yarn about the old days,” he said.
“Dessay he could, ” remarked Barracouta, lazily.
“Looks a bit of a case.”
“ Bum things happened in his family.”
( Barracouta was not an enthusiastic listener.
“ Speo so,” was all the encouragement he gave his
mate.
Nugget continued : “ A brother of his went
mad. His mother locked him up in the cellar for
cheeking her and forgot all about him for half a
day. When they opened the cellar-door the boy
was off his chump.”
‘ ‘ Booze ? ” queried Barracouta.
“Booze be hanged,” began Nugget. “No,
fright.”
Barracouta was growing interested, but silently
took another pull at his beer. Nugget did ditto,
very solemnly, then said : “ How’s that for mater-
nal forgetfulness, ’Couta ? ”
Barracouta agreed it was a “rum go.”
Nugget lit his pipe with a slow sulphur match
and smoked for a minute or two before proceeding
with his yarn.
The boy grew up, but never got over it. He
was always mad. One day he went out and sat
on a log and burnt himself to death. How’s that
for warm, ’Couta?”
Barracouta agreed that it was “red ’ot.”
That bloke in the briars did four years for a
bit of cattle-duffing before he was 20. It was his
father s ole the bullock, but the youngster swore
he did, and took the sentence. How’s that for
filial affection, ’Couta ? ”
‘My oath,” said Barracouta, carelessly. He
didn t seem to think much of the filial affection,
but said “ My oath ” from sheer politeness.
Nugget went on : “ They were going to make
the railway junction down there, and the Govern-
ment offered the old man a lump of money for the
bit of land they wanted ; but the old chap would
neither sell, rent, nor lend a single acre for a station
yard. That’s why the junction was made here.
In six months the grass grew up through the floor
of the bar down yonder, and blue ruin roosted in
the deserted skittle-alley.”
He wouldn t sell ? ” ejaculated Barracouta.
Not a foot. ”
Barracouta finished his beer.' Then he slowly
shouldered his swag 1 and reached for his billy.
“ Nugget,” he said reproachfully, “I do like a
liar ; but you suit me too bianky well.’ 5 With that
he marched off up the road, and the partnership
was irrevocably dissolved.
Nugget’s face wore a look of quiet surprise as he
-.watched his mate tramp out of sight along the
metal road. Then he cadged a pipeful of tobacco
from a railway fettler and went off up the branch
line.
“ ’Couta wasn't much of a tracker,” he said to
nobody in particular; “too touchy about old
tunes.
“That Derwent Nugget is a fearful liar,” said
Barracouta to some hop-pickers next day. “I
could stand his filial affection yarn, and the old
woman s forgetfulness, and the man sitting on a
log fire to burn himself to death ; but when it came
to a cattle-duffing publican refusing a railway
junction at his door, it filled me up altogether. So
I slung him.”
* * » *
I, who witnessed the falling-out of the Derwent
Nugget and Barracouta, made it my business to
have a yarn with the weary-looking man among
the briar-bushes down by the deserted pub. He
proved a by-no-means unintelligent though some-
what hopeless person. Heassured me that Nugget’s
yarn was absolutely true.

JOHN DRAYMAN.
Ashore and Afloat, an English teetotal
lie-jerker, tells how, at the inquest recently on a
noted drunkard, “ on the skull being opem d, the
odor of alcohol was sickening. One of the sur-
geons then struck a match, and held it close to
the head. Immediately a blue flame enveloped
the whole of the exposed brain.” The writer
regrets he wasn’t present at that spirit stance,
owing to a prior engagement at the inquest on a
noted teetotal orator, at which, on the skull being
opened, a huge torrent of water belched forth with
such violence as to break a half-inch plate-glass
window, and drown every soul in a juvenile
Rechabite procession which was passing at the
time. The corpse was finally arrested on a charge
of murder by two policemen who only reached it
after three hours’ battling with the flood. The
poor children were not insured.
Dear Bulletin,—-This is Bourke. I met
Bob the other day. Knew him at once. He was
foaming at the mouth, his eyes were red and
glaring, and the hair was all burnt off his back by
the sun. He knew me, too, for as soon as he came
into the bar he said, “ Hullo, Tremens ; hot, isn’t
it?” “Yes,”lsaid —“ hot even for Bourke ; you
don’t get 112' in the shade every day for eight
days, and I haven’t been out of this bar now for
eleven days for more than two hours at a time.”
He looked at me sharply and said, “Drinking?”
“ No, killing snakes,” I answered. “ The blanky
place swarms with them. There’s one on you
now.” I thought I heard him laugh, but it was
only a fellow in the corner whom I didn’t know.
He’d been sitting there for a week knocking snakes
off the counter with a stick. This fellow now
offered to shout, but Bob said he’d sing first. They
argued it out, and I must have fallen asleep, for I
woke up with a start and heard Bob singing “ Oh !
don’t you remember Sweet Alice, Ben ” He
stopped suddenly, with his eyes fixed, and staring
with horror at the counter. We all looked. Sure
enough, there was the biggest snake I ever saw in
my life, lying full length along the bar-counter.
The fellow in the corner was up in a moment, and
made a terrific whack at him with his stick. But
Bob was quicker. Seizing the snake in his mouth
like a flash, he had him on the floor in an instant.
Then took place one of the strangest and fiercest
fights I ever witnessed. With one savage snap
Bob would bite the head clean off the snake, but
immediately another head would appear at the
other end. As fast as Bob bit one head off
another would come, only at the other end, and
all the time they were rolling over each other,
snapping and hissing like demons. The row
brought in the landlord, who, seeing the trouble
and seeming to be used to such scenes, seized a
bottle of whisky, dropped five drops into the
snake’s mouth, killing him instantly. This ended
the trouble, but it set the fellow in the corner
going for the rest of the day. Being so impressed
by what he had seen, he would do nothing else but
kill snakes by dropping whisky into their mouths.
This went on till all of a sudden a death-adder put
his head out of the bottle and stared into his face.
Hurriedly placing the bottle on the floor, he re-
sumed his seat in the corner, but never for one in-
stant did he take his eyes off the bottle again.
Bob and I leave here to-morrow for the Never-
Never.—D. Tremens.

“For

that I, of course, think there is 1

I what it did for me.”—Mrs. L. A.

WEIGHTY WORDS
FOR
P
V
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
The above are indeed weighty words, of great import and value to
thousands of pale-faced, languid men and women, now tired and worn out
with worry, overwork, and disease, and who would be made well and strong
by the use of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Read also the following interesting
testimony of a prominent athlete :
627 Bourke St., Surry Hints, Sydney,
New South Wales, June 21, 1895.
“After being a victim to Typhoid, Brain, and Rheumatic fevers, in 1892, my
system was left in a terrible condition. Besides being very weak, I had numerous
abscesses on the lower part of my back and spine, from which a great number of
pieces of bone were taken. As fast as an abscess would appear and was lanced
another would form. I was treated at two different hospitals without success. The
surgeons in attendance informed me that I was suffering from blood poison. The
abscesses continued to appear, and I was never without pain, till six months ago I
was induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. When I had taken the first bottle I found
an improvement, and after finishing twelve bottles to-day I feel as well as ever I did
in my life; the abscesses have ceased to come, the old ones are all healed, and my
health is splendid. Before I used the Sarsaparilla I weighed 154 lbs., and now, after
using a dozen bottles, my weight is 200 lbs., which is a sure sign that I have been
taking the Champion Blood-Purifier of the world.”— George W. Walker, “Jumbo,”
Champion Foot-baller of New So. Wales.
