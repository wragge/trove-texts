SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Some Pre-Election Stocks
week I learnt of the derivation
of the word broker. It comes from
the Anglo-Saxon “brucan”, meaning to
use, possess and enjoy. If this be the
case, then the Yuletide season offers a
wonderful opportunity for brokers to
share their riches with others less for-
tunate.
It looks as though the Labor Party
wants everyone in the community to be
a “broker”. Its policy covers one from
the stage of being born into the world
right through to the stage of being borne
out. So much goodness is there in the
Labor proposals that one wonders how
inflation can be avoided. But Mr Calwell
is emphatic that this cannot happen
under his rule.
If the Labor Government does win
the elections the stockmarket will be
temporarily confused. Some panic sell-
ing, a weak December market and then
a boisterious 1964—especially for those
companies in retailing, building or ex-
porting—is probably to be the order.
Investing before the elections becomes
a case of selecting special situation
stocks. One is Tableland Tin. Earning
rate fell from a peak of 54 p.c. in 1961
down to 10 p.c. in 1962, and disappeared
altogether in 1963. It was during this
time that the dredge was moved from
the southern end of the Smith’s Creek
property back to the Finches area.
Profits since the beginning of this
financial year have shown an accelerating
upward trend. Of course, this year will
be helped along by the very high world
tin price, a price which is expected to
be maintained for some years. If not this
year, then by next year, profits should
be back in the vicinity of 50 p.c. again.
Not bad for a share now selling at par.
I bought 400 at 20s.
Perhaps not a special situation to
everyone but certainly to me is Hanimex
Corporation. Over a period of 18
months the share price has shown close
to a 150 p.c. rise.
It has not been a steady course. This
year alone the pessimistic interim report,
the fine for a Customs offence that
occurred in 1954 and the issue of
options to employees all sent more than
a ripple through the ranks of share-
holders.
The interim report is nullified by the
excellent final result. The Customs
offence was committed a decade ago and
has no bearing on current or future
operations. As for the issue of options
to employees only (not directors) based
on the existing market price at the time
of the issue, this is a well known and
thoroughly acceptable practice in the
US.
It might be argued that the market
price has risen too much. The still high
earnings yield of 12 p.c. is surely the
answer to such a criticism.
This earnings yield will be most
prominent when the stock is listed in
London shortly. One fact not generally
realised is that earnings yields for
English stocks are based on pre-tax
earnings. Thus, in English eyes, Hanimex
has a 16 p.c. earnings yield—just twice
that of the comparable English company,
Dixon’s.
The shares being cum the 74d. divi-
dend till November 13 was what gave
me the final prod into buying another
1000.
I seem to be continually cleaning up
the portfolio. This week United Tele-
casters and Pacific Island options were
sold. The former never got off the
starting blocks, while the latter after a
fine burst seems to be petering out.
Profits respectively were £lO7 and £3B.
Transactions for this week were:

National Notebook
Loud Report
lAne of our financial writers was
" browsing through some of the mass
of material which arrives each day when
she came to the quarterly report of the
Pato Consolidated Gold Dredging
Limited, of Colombia. The report reads
more like a script for an adventure film
than a company document and makes
one realise that, in spite of credit squeezes
and takeovers, we lead a pretty quiet life
financially in this country.
The report announced a trading profit
then went on to say that the union had
instituted a surprise strike (not entirely
unknown in these parts) and rejected
arbitration. The report then says: “After
all efforts at settlement were exhausted
the Government ordered the Army to
take control and return the assets to the
company which was done on August 3.
. . . Several attempts were made to have
national strikes during this period with
the downfall of the Government being
the principal objective. . . . Finally in
early September the Army
brought in reinforcements
to patrol the entire power
line and started gaoling
all suspects. Since then
there has been no further
sabotage. . . . The most
regrettable incident dur-
ing the strike occurred five days
before it was finally over when one
of the strikers who had been fired
attacked managing director Benjamin
Barraza and shot him three times.
Fortunately the wounds were not
critical.”
Against the Dollar
A cloud no bigger than a man's ready
reckoner is gathering on the Mel-
bourne horizon over Cardigan Street,
Carlton. It may develop into a storm
of controversy. No. 50, a tree-shaded
terraced house decorated with iron lace-
work, is the headquarters of the Aus-
tralian Currency Defence Association, a
looselv-knit group dedicated to thwarting
the proposed decimal currency reforms.
It is also the home and office of its
founder, Mr Bob Boase, a public
accountant.
Mr Boase has a coldly passionate
attachment to figures. No sentiment
weakens his belief that the currency
should not be tampered with. The wild
notion that 50 Cardigan Street is a
little piece of Tunbridge Wells, full of
pictures of the Queen and laments about
the loosening of bonds of Empire, is
soon dispelled. His case against the dol-
lar is simply this: It’s not worth it.
ACDA fired the first shot of its cam-
paign with a two-column ad in “The
Age”, headed THIS IS WHAT THE
CHANGE OF CURRENCY MEANS
TO YOU. It ended with a voting form
asking the reader to state whether he
favored a change of currency or not.
“The Government did all the right
things,” said Mr Boase in an interview.
“They appointed a committee you
know what took place and the com-
mittee recommended decimals. But they
got the wrong answers. The committee
took evidence from a large number of
people all of whom said, ‘lt stands to
reason that with a simpler currency
unit all calculations will be simpler,
which will lead to vast savings of time,
thus justifying the cost.’
“I appeared before the committee. I
told them that I had studied the sums
we do involving money. There are 14
different kinds of sums based on addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication and
division.
“I examined these sums
to find out if it made any
difference whether the
basic unit had 240 units
or 100. I found that some
calculations are simpler
when the unit has 100
parts, some are simpler
when the unit has 240 parts, and in many
calculations it makes no difference. My
main conclusion was that the promise
of vast savings of time with decimal cur-
rency was a false one.”
What was the response to the adver-
tisement? The day after it appeared,
there were six letters, all against deci-
mal currency; the next day, five against
and two for. Mr Boase opened nine
letters on his desk. Seven were against
and two undecided. “A very gratifying
response,” said Mr Boase.
Elbow Room
ITow big should a building-block be?
The Australian wide-open-spaces tra-
dition has set a quarter-acre standard.
But this must change according to two
powerful views put to Western Australia,
the widest-open State of them all.
First Premier David Brand came home
with the inevitable Observations of
Overseas Trends. Blocks overseas are
smaller than they used to be, he said.
You can't expect a quarter-acre any
more. Then Perth's Lord Mayor, Sir
Harry Howard, added endorsement, fol-
lowing a civic conference in Hobart.
In fact, the city of Perth has thrown
over the tradition long ago, and its town
planners maintain one-sixth of an acre
is enough for a working man to look

after. They can point to telling aerial
pictures of the elbow-room suburbs, with
two-thirds of the blocks carefully tended
and the rest havens for Perth’s king-
sized insects.
Last word on the quarter-acre contro-
versy came from Professor Gordon Ste-
phenson, whose Stephenson Plan is re-
arranging the city’s arteries. The big
Canadian says Perth’s suburbia is still
a long way from feeling the squeeze.
His advice: A quarter-acre, don’t settle
for less.
From Warragul to Whitehall
Tt seems that only a lunatic spasm of
disunity can now prevent the
British Labor Party being returned to
power at the next General Election. It
is unlikely, however, that the shadow
Prime Minister, Mr Harold Wilson, and
his followers will oblige the Conserva-
tive Central Office. In the English
manner, they have merely decided to
form a queue until they get on the bus.
Only one seat has been allocated the
driver’s—but that opens up the interest-
ing question of who, if anyone, is telling
Mr Wilson which direction he should
take.
The answer takes you a long way from
Whitehall, to Warragul, Victoria. It was
there on March 26, 1907, that Kenneth
Clinton Wheare was born, the eldest son
of Eustace Leonard Wheare and Kath-
leen Kinahan. It is this Kenneth
Wheare, now Professor Wheare, Rector
of Exeter College, who is being cast by
the experts as Mr Wilson’s eminence
grise.
Professor Wheare, of course, laughs
at the idea. “Can’t imagine where it
began and I certainly don’t want to talk
about it,” he says. Just as amiably and
as firmly, he refuses to discuss his long
association with Mr Wilson.
But he and Mr Wilson are academi-
cally almost Siamese twins. Both took
first-class honors in Philosophy, Politics
and Economics at Oxford, both are
fellows of University College and both
lectured on economics at Oxford. Both
were scholarship boys; Mr Wilson from
the Wirral Grammar School, Cheshire,
which (pace the Greater Public Schools
of Australia) is about on a par with
Scotch College, Melbourne, where Pro-
fessor Wheare was educated before
passing to the University of Melbourne
and a Rhodes Scholarship in 1929. At
56, the insiders claim, Professor Wheare
is just the right age to be the confidant
of the 47-year-old Mr Wilson. They
have even gone so far as to point out
that both men have Abraham Lincoln
for a hero-figure.
Perhaps the most cogent point made
to support the view that Professor
Wheare will be high in the councils of
the Labor leader is the fact that changes
in the Labor Party’s programme, mooted
at its Scarborough conference, including
a plan for a new economic control
organisation with power over the
Treasury, are likely to run against that
iceberg entity, the British Constitution.
Undoubtedly in any such difficulty,
Professor Wheare’s advice would be
highly valued by Mr Wilson.
Academic Expansion
plans announced for the
University of Adelaide recently will
make it the country’s biggest city univer-
sity in size. The university is to'build a
“branch office” on the site of an old
tuberculosis sanatorium in the foothills
at Bedford Park, seven miles south-west
of the city. The site has an area of 370
acres.
The present size of the Adelaide Uni-
versity is 30 acres, with 27 acres of park-
lands playing fields. There is no room
to expand. The inadequacy of these 30
acres is shown in comparison to Perth’s
165 acres, Sydney’s 117 and Melbourne’s
100. In 1948, Adelaide University had
4900 students. This year there are 7300.

The Economics Behind
Mr Calwell’s Policies
T ABOR’S promised spending bon-
anza is no substitute for a re-
sponsible economic policy. If Mr
Calwell fails to recognise this he
has learnt nothing in his long poli-
tical life. Time and again since the
days of Chifley the electorate has
refused to be hoodwinked by an
inflated spending list put out by the
ALP in the guise of an enlightened
economic policy. So why has it
chosen this route again and chal-
lenged the Government to fight the
election on economic issues alone?
Having come so near to success
by adopting this tack in 1961 it
has obviously convinced itself that
one more economic push will top-
ple the Government despite the fact
that its spending proposals are
blatantly inflationary and that by
every rule in the book the current
economic position is highly satis-
factory and getting better every day.
It is very odd indeed that at one
moment Mr Calwell argues that the
economy will be dangerously buoy-
ant next year to the point where
Mr Holt will put on a credit squeeze
and, at the next, comes up with
proposals of his own for adding new
layers of Government and other ex-
penditure to induce a five and a half
per cent growth rate in an economy
which was hardly pressed to achieve
four per cent without endangering
the price level during the last de-
cade and is now short of skilled
labor.
In going for stability and a less
ambitious rate of growth the Gov-
ernment has learnt a sound political
lesson namely, that stop-and-go
policies are highly unpopular and
that inflation as well as recession is
wasteful of resources It has thus
chosen to keep the economy on a
buoyant though even keel, not pres-
sing its economic luck too hard but
trying to keep a little up its sleeve
for unpalatable contingencies. That
is just as much the essence of poli-
tical, as it is of business, responsibi-
lity.
Many of Mr Calwell’s proposals
dealing with education, housing,
scientific research and economic
planning were imaginative and bold
and he and his advisers should be
given full credit for them. Neverthe-
less, the nagging question of who
pays for what and how remains. The
money can only come from the
taxpayer. Mr Holt has estimated
that the cost of Mr Calwell’s
proposals at £336,000,000
£136,000,000 more than Mr Cal-
well’s own estimates. Allowing even
for exaggerations of electioneering it
is probable that Mr Holt’s own
estimates are on the conservative
side. And yet Mr Calwell advocates
this increased expenditure while
criticising the Government for a
stop-and-go economic policy which,
he says, his own party if returned
to power can avoid. This seems
a specious argument.
If Labor has learnt any new les-
sons in economic management which
will obviate recourse to stop-and-
go policies in the event of inflation
and balance of payments crises it
is keeping very dark about them.
It should be carefully noted in this
connection that in his policy speech
Mr Calwell was insistent that he
could maintain full employment all
the time come economic weather
foul or fair.
The truth is that the only alter-
native to the monetary and fiscal
devices we are accustomed to use
for adjusting the economy is rigid
government control of investment
and spending, the sort of para-
phernalia with which Labor control-
led the economy during and after
the war until the public rebelled
against it. With nothing else up its
sleeve to control the inflation which
its heightened spending targets
would surely induce, a Labor Gov-
ernment would not hesitate to put
the economy in a straitjacket of
physical controls again.
The tools for this have been rust-
ing in Labor lockers since 1949 but
Mr Calwell made it perfectly clear
that one of his first acts in office
would be to set up committees of
economic planners in Canberra to
guide the Government. It would be
a short step from these to restore
some of the old devices such as
capital issues and price control to
their former inglorious roles in
economic regulation, but naturally
the less Labor says about them the
better for its election chances.
But before Labor flung such con-
trols in the face of public opinion
it would doubtless use taxation to
the limit to impose its economic will
on the community. In any case, as
Sir Robert has correctly demon-
strated, increased taxation would be
necessary to find the money for
the £200,000,000 or more addition-
al to normal expenditure entailed by
the ALP’s proposals. As he said:
“You can’t spend money twice and
the annual increase in revenue from
existing tax rates deriving from
rising national incomes would be
absorbed in the normal growth of
expenditure.”
While it is probably of no great
moment to the Labor Caucus (which
will tell Mr Calwell how to run
the economy anyway) that higher
taxation would stifle the private
sector of the economy, it is some-
thing which should be weighed
carefully because not only is pri-
vate enterprise still the mainspring
of employment in this country but
high taxation is in itself inflationary.
Overall, the ALP’s economic pro-
posals are open to the charge that
although the desire to press eco-
nomic growth and increase social
benefits is well intentioned they at-
tempt to do far too much too quick-
ly. Putting too great a strain on
available economic resources would
lead the economy into a new bout
of inflation. Eschewing stop-and-go
measures, proposals like these would
entail a steep increase in taxation
rates which would militate against
employment in the private sector
and open the path to physical con-
trols.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ELECTIONS —I
The Key Electorate
An Australian Cross-Section
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
JEFF BATE
challenged
Tn the early days of the Federal cam-
■*" paign in New South Wales one of
the main talking points has been the con-
fidential report by Hansen Rubensohn-
McCann Erickson, prepared for the ALP
on prospects in NSW.
The report, based, it was said, on ex-
tensive surveys, listed the following four
seats in NSW as wins in this order of
possibility: Robertson, Parramatta, Lowe
and Macarthur.
The report assumed its importance in
the light of the estimates of ALP chances
in Queensland. Last week realists in
the ALP were conceding behind-the-
scenes the loss of three seats in Queens-
land, including the two metropolitan
seats of Petrie and Lillie.
So the weight of Opposition hopes
rested on the imponderable of Victoria
and most vitally on the four NSW seats
with Macarthur, the fulcrum for office,
as the key fourth seat.
Macarthur, a seat which swings in
an arc from the western outskirts of
Sydney south to the coast on the edge of
Jervis Bay, is an unusual seat which
is a virtual sample of Australia, lacking
only a Nolan desert. The occupations of
the 62,000-odd electors read like a slab
of verse from Whitman or Sandburg.
On the north in suburban St. Marys there
are city commuters and munitions work-
ers, then the near subsistence migrant
market gardeners of Austral, the poultry
farmers, tomato growers and mushroom
cultivators of Leppington, the commuters
and small businessmen of Campbelltown.
Camden, one of the oldest centres of
settlement, has old families (the Mac-
Arthur - Onslows), dairy farmers and, to
the west, apple growers and coal miners.
The heart of the electorate is in the
Southern Highlands, with more old fami-
lies (the Throsbys and the Oxleys), the
wealthy, retired graziers, sheep and
beef cattle stations in the rougher
country. As the electorate shifts to the
coast there are the potato growers of
Robertson. On the coast, suburban Wol-
longong has spilt over the countryside,
with cheaper housing around Oak Flats
but with some middle-class executive
homes in Dapto. The electorate finally
takes in the major south coast town of
Nowra, centre for dairy farmers, with
a paper mill.
Fishing boats operate out of the Shoal-
haven and there are oyster farmers in the
estuary. The service vote is a factor with
soldiers at Ingleburn to the north and a
Navy base near Nowra.
The electorate, created in 1948, was
won easily a year later by Jeff (short for
Jefferson) Bate, a sixth generation Aus-
tralian and farmer, holding a local State
seat. It was then a rural seat and Jeff
Bate held it as such. He became chair-
man of the Government members’ Food
and Agriculture Committee, worked on
the NSW Flood Relief Committee. In
1958 his majority was over 8,000. But
in 1961 a new Labor candidate, Don
Nilon, took him down to 3,000. Since
then another 6,500-odd electors have
gone on to the rolls, mostly in the new
suburban areas.
If, as Nilon estimates, the new votes
go slightly better than two-to-one his
way, then the veteran politician Bate has
his majority almost eliminated. But the
election this time will be complicated by
the presence of a third candidate, Albert
Perish (pronounced Parish), a keen 31-
year-old DLP candidate with a name and
following among poultry farmers in the
north of the electorate. On the face of
it, his preferences seem certain to be-
come a vital issue. But, then, Leppington,
his home area, is a strong Bate area so
the danger for the member is that Perish
may take as many votes from him as
from Nilon. Preferences have never been
as firm with NSW DLP voters and Nilon
is known as a Catholic, which should help
attract drifters.
Nilon, a 32-year-old public servant, is
something of a new-look type Labor
candidate. Son of, as he stresses in Mac-
arthur, a farmer and himself a beef
classer, Nilon has campaigned to build
on his base of suburban support backing
from the small-town businessmen and
farmers emphasising country issues.
But in a roused Jeff Bate, the challeng-
er has a difficult member to overthrow.
Bate has built a sound electioneering ap-
paratus in the area. Indeed a few years
ago two political scientists referred with
admiration to the “Bate-Beale” machine
which had controlled politics on the
South Coast and Southern Highlands for
generations. When a party branch chal-
lenged him over parliamentary increases,
Bate rolled them 53-1 at a Federal elec-
toral council meeting. Locals agree that
he did not campaign flat out last time,
but this time he has 167 meetings sched-
uled, reaching a peak cf ten a day. His
party apparatus has 23 branches with
1700 paid-up members.
The ALP has 18 branches with 600
members, but the DLP has no branches.
The test will be how far Bate can hold
his rural base and pick up his quota of
votes in the newer areas and how far
Nilon, with a more confident organis-
ation than last time, can raid Bate’s rural
voters for conversions.
But for both parties the preferences of
Mr Perish remain the nagging question
and in the week after the elections the
question might be interesting a large
proportion of the Australian population.
NEW ZEALAND
No Angles for Politicians
“Uniform greyness ”
FROM RON TAYLOR IN AUCKLAND
VTew Zealand’s state-owned Broadcast-
ing Corporation, which holds the
monopoly on radio and television, has
decided to turn its political masters into
proverbial wooden Indians.
For with the most fatuous bureau-
cratic decision in years, NZBC’s director
of sound broadcasting, Lionel Sceats, has
announced that all telecasts during the
general election campaign will have the
same presentation.
There will be one fixed camera staring
candidates full in the face, with no angle
shots and no close-ups. And, as if this


were not enough, someone has arranged
with supreme, if unconscious, irony
that every speaker will have a back-
drop of “uniform greyness.”
It is the first time television has been
available in New Zealand for election-
eering. It is likely to be the last when
hapless politicians see their five-minute
canned image on the screen. What makes
it even worse is that at times three can-
didates will appear one after the other.
And heaven help the last man!
Object of the presentation, according
to director Sceats, is to “ensure, as far
as humanly possible, equality of treat-
ment, equality of presentation, and so
on, for all.”
THE ELECTIONS—II
The DLP Without
Dr Mannix
The Angel of Death
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
B. A. SANTAMARIA
with God’s help
HThe Victorian ALP handled their prob-
lem of the death of Archbishop
Mannix with decency and dignity. They
could have chosen to ignore his death.
But they apparently decided that to
ignore a legend is not to destroy it, only
to affront those for whom it has meaning
and significance.
Mr R. Holt, Victorian ALP President,
who has been a devoted political
opponent of Archbishop Mannix over
recent years and who has resisted im-
placably both the things for which the
dead prelate fought and the extension of
his political influence, made a short
speech. He confined himself to paying
tribute to the dead Archbishop’s strong,
fearless and effective personality.
Then without reference to Archbishop
Mannix’s political views, Holt asked the
meeting to stand for a moment in silence
as the acknowledgment of the passing
of a man whose impact upon public life
and public affairs in Victoria and Aus-
tralia over the past half century is part
of the nation's history.
If there was a political flavor (and
there undoubtedly was) to the way Holt
and the Labor Party handled the prob-
lem created for the Victorian ALP by
Dr Mannix’s death, Mr B. A. Santa-
maria, who drew much of his strength
in his crusade against the ALP from
Dr Mannix, was even more political
in his tribute.
“Nothing has changed,” he said.
“Those of us who were Archbishop
Mannix’s faithful friends and followers
in life remain his friends and followers
now. The last conversation I had
with him only two days ago left no
doubt in my mind that he wanted the
work continued. That is what we propose
to do. With God’s help we will not fail
him.”
I think it is not unfair to say that
what Santamaria is trying to convey
there (as delicately as he can for it is
difficult to be blunt in such circum-
stances) is that as recently as two days
before Dr Mannix’s death Dr Mannix
advised him that he still wanted those
among his Victorian co-religionists who
accepted his political guidance to vote
against the Labor Party.
It is impossible to assess the effect
that the visitation of Mr Calwell’s
declared political ally the Angel of Death
to the Archbishop's palace of Raheen
on Wednesday last will have upon the
short-term fortunes of the Labor Party
and the DLP. I would not even attempt
to guess how it will reflect itself in the
votes on November 30. But in the long-
term, Dr. Mannix’s absence from the Vic-
torian political scene must help the
Labor Party and possibly result in the
elimination from the Australian political
scene of the DLP, a party which in
Victoria has tenaciously and surprisingly
survived.
Dr Mannix’s successor is 73-year-old
Coadjutor Archbishop Justin Daniel Sim-
onds who did not see eye to eye poli-
tically with Dr Mannix. He is credited
with either being a “neutralist” in
politics something Dr Mannix never
was or inclining towards the NSW
Hierarchy’s policy of preserving the
historical links with the ALP.
The likelihood is that even if Arch-
bishop Simonds does not display open
hostility to Mr Santamaria and the
DLP, he will certainly ban in his diocese
the rendering of public and quasi-
official Roman Catholic support to those
campaigning publicly against the Labor
Party because of pro-Communist aspects.
Once Raheen support vanishes, the DLP
claims that it is not primarily a Roman
Catholic party will be tested fully.
But these are the long-term possi-
bilities. It is the short-term political
effects of Dr Mannix’s death that the
politicians are interested in, though they
admit that they will be able to gauge
the worth of Mr Calwell’s Angel of
Death as a political campaign ally only
when the election results are posted on
polling day, November 30.
LAW
The Press, Sex and Tipsters
Reform in Victoria
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
JThiE mixed bag of over 200 clauses in
the Victorian Police Offences Act has
been under scrutiny of the Parliamentary
Statute Law Revision Committee, which
has now recommended a series of
changes. Most are along the lines of
bringing the law up to date. One ex-
ample was the fine gaol ratio of £1 or
three days which is used in the present
Act. The Committee considered that in
view of current wage rates this should
be stood on its head as £3 or one day.
The Committee pointed out that the
widespread flouting of the law banning
the sale of newspapers on Sundays was
merely bringing the law into disrepute.
It accordingly suggested that the law be
repealed.
The Committee could not go along
with a proposal to ban the sale of con-
traceptives to persons under 18 for the
reason that this would in some cases
deny them to married persons under this
age. It took the view that it was a com-
mendable aim to restrict premarital inter-
course, but did not think that such a
ban was the right way to go about it.
It noted a case where contraceptives
had been on sale at a school tuckshop
and went on to suggest that the law


should restrict their sale to pharmacists.
It also proposed a ban on advertise-
ments by racing tipsters offering to pro-
vide winners for a fee.
Early next year the Committee will
probe into the need or otherwise for
appeals against the growing power of
the executive Government. Announcing
the inquiry, the Chairman, Mr Manson
(LCP Member for Ringwood), said his
Committee felt that Ministers and other
Government Councils, now had so many
discretionary powers that some check
might be found necessary to protect the
rights of citizens against arbitrary de-
cisions. Mr Manson said the Victorian
section of the International Commission
of Jurists had submitted data. Later, Mr
Ashkanasy, QC, who is Chairman of the
I.C.J. outlined its plan for a tribunal to
hear appeals against administrative deci-
sions.
He said the proposed tribunal would
consist of a Supreme Court Judge with
a panel of about a dozen experts in ad-
ministration, business, government and
related fields. It would have authority to
hear appeals against a variety of admini-
strative rulings and in issuing its deci-
sion would set out the reasons
Mr Ashkanasy said an Ombudsman
would be a useful adjunct to an Admini-
strative Appeals Tribunal, but would be
useless in a situation where a Municipal
Council run by a political party caucus
had acted unjustly.
Full details of the plan would go before
Mr Manson's Committee next year.
THE KANAKAS
ffif&ulletCn
80 Years Ago: November 17, 1883
'C'leven Kanakas ran away from a
'Queensland plantation lately, and
made for their native isles. Their
idea seems to have been that they
could swim there. They got some
miles cut to sea before they turned
back. When they reached the beach
..
they were captured by the police
■■after a desperate struggle”. It must
have been a desperate struggle to
overcome a few poor devils who had
hardly strength enough to reach the
shore. But have we not seen a police-
man complimented in the public
prints on his gallant conduct in
capturing a blood-thirsty desperado
of ten years old whom he had caught
in the act of rifling a pea-nut stall?
Certainly we have; and proud we are
to have such defenders. But, return-
ing to the Kanakas, we should be
interested—if anything could interest
us now —to know why so many of
them run away from plantations.
Perhaps they have too little to do, or
too much to eat. Perhaps their wages
are too high. Perhaps they are
treated too kindly by their masters,
and their feelings of gratitude so out-
pace their knowledge of English that
they run away from sheer shame.
Evidently, at any rate, a plantation
life is too much of joy for them. One
of these days, when an overdose of
joy causes a few more to hang and
drown themselves, there will be a
little inquiry and we shall find out.
Till then we shall wait with philo-
sophic calm. We have no Kanaka
relatives ourselves, so we can afford
to be resigned.

The Inspector Calls
The Testro Report
FROM J. C. HoRSFALL IN MELBOURNE
A. RYLAH
Early action.. .
jyjß Rex Testro came in for a rough
drubbing from Sir James Tait, QC,
Inspector into the Testro group of com-
panies in his official report last week.
Attorney-General A. Rylah intimated
that early action would be taken on the
report which recommended that con-
sideration be given to whether any (and
if so, what) proceedings should be taken
against one or more of the directors for
breaches of the Companies Act. It also
recommended the winding up of both
Testro Bros Consolidated and its sub-
sidiary, Surfers Paradise Land Develop-
ment, through a liquidator rather than a
receiver and official manager.
On the crucial matter of Testro’s lost
investment of £235,000 in Garrison In-
dustries, the Inspector said, “In making
this disastrous investment Mr R. C.
Testro must be regarded either as a fool
or as being recklessly improvident, and
in either case unfit to be entrusted with
large sums of money subscribed by the
public.”
More specifically Sir James criticised
Rex Testro’s statement in a prospectus,
issued by Testro Bros Consolidated on
November 20 last year, for the issue of
£300.000 mortgage debenture stock, in
which was written: “The year 1962 has
been one of considerable progress in-
cluding the purchase of a substantial
stock exchange listed shareholding in
Garrison Industries.”
“I can find nothing in the prospectus,”
stated the Inspector, “to indicate to the
reader that by the date of the prospectus
the Garrison shares purchased had
turned out or were even suspected to be
of little or no value.” He went on to
say that in this respect the prospectus
was deceptive and concealed a material
fact, because on the evidence he had
obtained the Garrison shares had become
known to be valueless in October, 1962,
four months after purchase.
The Receiver and Official Manager of
the group, Mr Lewis Luckins, went
immediately into attack, saying that, “It
seems most unfair and unjust that a man
who conducts an inquiry and to whom
formal representations cannot be made
should have his findings and opinions
published prior to any judicial hearing.”
In the meantime he intends to carry on
with the Receivership in what he con-
siders to be the best interests of deben-
ture holders.
In recommending a Liquidator be
appointed Sir James stated that as large
sums would have to be found for con-
tinuing the group’s Suncoast Develop-
ment project, on which about £300,000
has already been expended, he was not
confident that a proper and wise decision
as to whether the project should be
proceeded with would be made if the
company were carried on under the
present Receiver and official manager,
who continued to employ Mr Rex Testro
in the company.

MALAYSIA
The Bulletin’s “Reckless”
Article
The Row Upstairs
TUNKU RAHMAN
approached ...
Singapore, November 2: Reprinted from
“The Straits Times”.
A n approach has been made to the
Government to deny the freelance
journalist, Mr Alex Josey, all Press
facilities “as a proper rebuff” for the
article he wrote in the Australian news
magazine, The Bulletin (October 19,
1963) on Lee Kuan Yew.
The chairman of the National Council
ot the Malay Language Congress, Syed
Nasir bin Ismail, who is the Director of
the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, made
the approach today after Mr Josey had
“unreservedly” apologised for having un-
wittingly given offence to Malays.
Two organisations the National
Writers' Association and the Federation
of Malay Students’ Unions yesterday
urged I'unku Abdul Rahman to declare
Mr Josey persona non grata.
Mr Josey said today “I am most
upset about all this and hasten unre-
servedly to apologise if my remark gives
offence. No insult was intended.”
Later Syed Nasir issued a statement
saying. “His half-hearted apology is no
compensation for the insult he or those
behind him have heaped on us.
“The damage he has caused, not only
internally but abroad as well, by his subtle
insinuation and insult to the Malays
should not be taken lightly.
“It is most unfortunate for a person
of Mr Josey’s standing, a person who
has spent a considerable time in this
country, enjoying the hospitality and
kindness shown to him, to make such
a sweeping and untruthful statement re-
garding the Malays in a journal pub-
lished outside Malaysia.
“I wish particularly to comment on
his statement which refers to the Malays
as a race with no literature, culture or
history except piracy.
“For a person like Mr Josey of Bri-
tish origin, this statement of his is most
unpardonable.
“It was his country of origin which
colonised and exploited our motherland
and along with this system of colonial
rule came Mr Josey.
“Let me remind Mr Josey that it was
one of his countrymen, Stamford Raf-
ties, who took away hundreds of Malay
literary works from this country and
which unfortunately perished in the ship
called Fame in the middle of the nine-
teenth century.
“Otherwise, I am sure people like
Mr Josey or his type will have the op-
portunity to acquaint himself with Malay
history, literature and culture.
“Perhaps I may help Mr Josey if I
illustrate a little of Malay historical
works of the past.
“As far back as in the fifteenth cen-
tury, the Malays in Malaya alone had
written Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals).
“The Malays in the neighbouring is-
lands, particularly Acheh and Pasai, al-
ready had Malay historical works at a
much earlier date.
“It may be his ignorance of the his-
tory of the Malays that has led him to
make such an uncalled-for, reckless, ir-
responsible and thoroughly offensive
statement.
“Judging from the whole tenor of his
statement in the magazine, there seems
to be an attempt on the part of Mr
Josey or those behind him to create a
cleavage and dissensions between the
two major communities in Malaysia.”
Syed Nasir added that Mr Josey had
forfeited his right to remain as a guest
of the people and the Government of
this country.
“1 have no doubt that the Govern-
ment will take a serious view of Mr
Josey’s activities and cut them short
forthwith.
“I strongly urge the Government and
all its agencies to withdraw all Press
facilities normally extended to a journal-
ist in this country as a proper rebuff.
“Until the Government can fully
establish the real status of Mr Josey
as a journalist, it is right that Press facili-
ties granted to him should be withdrawn
immediately,” the statement added.

A Shake-up in Hospital
Administration ?
“Overlapping and Duplication ”
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
T ike Topsy, hospitals in Australia for
one hundred and fitty-odd years just
growed—going their own way, raising
their own funds, determining their own
charges and cherishing their independ-
ence. But the post-war years have seen
vast changes in hospital financing and
administration and last week in Sydney
the holder of the only Australian Chair
in Hospital Administration, Professor
John Griffith of the University of New
South Wales, asked whether the future
would bring charges on the same scale.
The Professor told a conference of
hospital administrators that Australia
was spending about £.330 million a
year on hospitals and health services.
This was more than the money spent
on education and nearly half as much
again as the defence bill. Converted into
English terms it amounted to £264 mil-
lion sterling compared with the £9OO
million sterling spent in England and
Wales on hospital and health services,
with four times Australia’s population
“In short then,” Professor Griffith said,
“we are spending nearly a third as much
on a less comprehensive service for a
population which is less than a quarter
of theirs.”
The Professor, who spent 25-odd years
in hospital administration before becom-
ing head of the Nuffield Centre of Hos-
pital and Health services at Leeds Uni-
versity, told the administrators that be-
fore the hospitals demanded more money
they had to review their use of resources
and “there is room for improvement.”
Firstly, the cost of the administration
of 115 hospital benefits and 83 medical
benefits funds was being sliced out of
income, and “each fund can retain up
to fifteen per cent of the money it
handles”.
Then there was “the very considerable
proportion” that went to professional
fund raisers. Small hospitals with low
bed occupancy came in for criticism.
The Professor skittered away from query-
ing the basic structure of honoraries but


diJ speak generally of “losses attribut-
able to overlapping and duplication of
staffing”.
He also spoke in a guarded way of
hospital rivalries where administrators
and doctors in different hospitals com-
pete to duplicate expensive equipment
in a spirit of competition, but going on
to admit that such statements would be
hotly disputed.
THE POLICE
Frank Bischof Under Fire
A Hotel Call-Girl Service?
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
Q’LD’S COMMISSIONER
a 9 day wonder?
TV/S'r Colin Bennett, the outspoken
ALP member for South Brisbane,
who is also a barrister, started all the
fuss when he said in the House that
Police Commissioner Frank Bischof and
his colleagues frequented a hotel en-
couraging and condoning “a call-girl
service that goes on there”.
The new Minister in charge of Police,
Mr Alex Dewar, replied he had taken
this matter up with the Commissioner
and he was satisfied that the statement
was a figment of “Mr Bennett’s infan-
tile imagination.” Mr Bennett also said
that Mr Bischof and two police inspec-
tors were in “close collaboration” to
obtain the Government’s return at the
last election. Mr Dewar replied that three
per cent of the police force had a per-
sonal grudge against the world, the
Government, and themselves. These men
had an ear that would listen to them in
Mr Bennett. Mr Dewar denied that any
Government member knew of any police
force member having assisted them.
Last week, Premier Frank Nicklin
and Mr Dewar rejected requests for an
investigation into Mr Bennett’s allega-
tions unless specific charges were made.
Mr. Nicklin told Parliament that the
Government took a very serious view of
the claims, but an examination of Mr.
Bennett’s speech showed that it was diffi-
cult to discern where comment and in-
ference ended and allegations of fact
began. He invited Mr Bennett to give
the names of credible witnesses prepared
to give first-hand evidence. Mr. Bennett
said he W'ould reply in writing to Mr
Nicklin. On the same day Mr Dewar
rejected the Queensland Police Union’s
request for an inquiry. At the week’s
end, State Cabinet was understood to
be divided on whether an inquiry should
be held whether specific charges were
made or not. A clear Government hope
was that the matter would soon blow
over as a nine-days’ wonder.
TRANSPORT
111 Hobart, a Grievance
Smouldering north-south rivalry
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
sudden stab of realisation that the
Empress of Australia might make
two trips from Sydney to the Tamar for
every trip to the Derwent sparked Tas-
mania’s smouldering North-South rivalry
into a new blaze. This time Hobart has
the hot sense of grievance which norm-
ally afflicts Launceston.
‘The Hobart Meicury” has become
the vehement mouthpiece of Southern
anger. “It is ironic,” it said editorially,
“that the only two Tasmanian elector-
ates which have been consistently loyal
to the Federal Government should now
be threatened with shabby treatment.”
Last week, more pointedly still, an
editorial concluded: ‘The Federal Gov-
ernment should give a clear undertaking
that the original assurances about the
ferry should be kept faithfully. If the
Prime Minister does not feel disposed to
give an assurance perhaps the Leader of
the Opposition will.”
In February, 1961, Hobart was named
as “the terminal port” for the proposed
ferry. Only later was the northern port
of Bell Bay announced as the terminal
for alternate trips.
The Hobart Marine Board insists that
the Empress was intended for passenger
service, but her profitability will depend
on cargo.
Tourists with cars and semi-trailer
transports might be indifferent to the
port of entry, but Bell Bay is the cargo
magnet. Smelters there will soon be
producing 1000 tons of aluminium ingots
a week, mostly destined for Sydney.
The Tasmanian Government remains
neutral. It burned its fingers when
Devon port was chosen as the Princess’
terminal. Launceston showed its dis-
pleasure by casting out a couple of
Labor members at the next election
though the Government pleaded that
the ANL made the decision.
The Commonwealth meanwhile, with
November 30 in mind, is playing for
time. Shipping Minister Opperman has
said that the Empress’ schedules are be-
ing studied in the light of cargo offering.
COMMUNISTS
A Russian Visit?
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
failure of the wheat crop and the
consequent dust-storms in the Soviet
Union may well be causing great concern
to Mr. Khrushchev, but they have given
a fillip to the first stage of a grandiose
plan of the Australia-Soviet Friendship
Society. Part one of the plan is for a
delegation of Soviet primary production
experts to visit Australia in September,
1964. Tentative proposals have been
made for the co-operation and backing
of Australian primary producers in
sponsoring the delegation.
The response had been anything but
heartening until the first big sales of
Australian wheat to the Soviet when, by
astutely showing that such sales were but
a fraction of what could be sold to this
particular market, the discreet organisers
began to find people willing to lend
their names as sponsors to the delegation.
The next step to win friends and
influence people after this planned visit
will be something in the form of a
bumper Australia-Soviet Friendship
Society festival in Australia during the
next year or so.
Great secrecy surrounds the planning
of the proposed festival. Actually a simi-
lar festival had been planned for this
year in a tentative way, but in the in-
ternal CP flurry, together with the act-
ivities of Mr Skripov, the vision splendid
was lost.
First step in the planning is the pro-
jected establishment of sponsorship com-
mittees, with suitable top citizens and the
Australia-Soviet Friendship Society well
in the dim background.
Some optimists hope for a visit by an
astronaut or possibly a great figure like
the composer Shostakovich.

A Visit to India
One year after the Emergency
By PETER COLEMAN
The obvious signs are still there: No
photography in the airports. A
nightly anti-Chinese radio session
called “India and the Dragon”. Rising
prices. Recruiting for the Army. Pep
talks from Mr Nehru. But a visitor
to India, one year after the Chinese
invasion, could easily assume the
Emergency was more or less over and
that the country had returned to what
must be something like “normal”.
By “normal” I don’t mean the old
tourists’ India I expected to see the
sacred cows, bullocks and buffaloes,
estimated at 225 million, blocking the
traffic and competing with hungry
humans for food; or the famous matri-
monial columns in the newspapers
(“Wanted Brahmin virgin. Beauty main
consideration. Any sub-sect. Reply
with horoscope”); or passengers having
to get out and push the rattle-trap taxis;
or the bootleg liquor. I mean rather the
unending and, for a visitor, irresistible
talk about Government corruption, com-
mercial inefficiency, Congress Party
hypocrisy, caste prejudice, poverty, com-
munalism, the language question—all the
complaints that a free people lavishly
endowed with the gift of free speech can
put tongue to when not going to war.
Many people come away from a first
visit to India with the strongest impres-
sion of—what?—the stench of Bombay
harbor; the countless people sleeping in
the streets (officially estimated at over
62,000 in Bombay alone, not to mention
another 77,000 who live in cattle-sheds
or under staircases); the horrible diseases;
people’s irritating obsequiousness to the
superiors in the hierarchy. I don’t think
I am particularly callous, but these ter-
rible sights, smells and the rest did not
make me want to leave the country in
disgust—as seems to be the reaction of
many foreigners. (Though, no doubt with
a warped sense of values, I can't forget
the 5 a.m. ride to Bombay airport in a
taxi smelling of incense—stuck on the
dashboard to get the day off to a sacred
start —and the driver suddenly accelerat-
ing viciously at a dog in the gutter and
leaving it thrashing and yelping to death.
But that was only a dog, so who cares?,
even if Indians, they tell you, hate killing
any living thing.)
In fact the strongest impression
Indians made on me, despite their aware-
ness of their colossal problems, was of
their unrestrained pleasure in talk
whether it be a Harijan room-boy, a
politician, a lawyer, a journalist, a film
man. They are a nation of uninhibited
talkers free - wheeling, critical, witty,
curious. It may seem a frivolous im-
pression to bring back from such a
troubled country, but at least on the
inevitable question of the prospect of
Communism in India, one finds it hard
to imagine such a free and outspoken
people ever putting up with it —unless a
catastrophe happens first.
In any case, despite an apparent air
of “normalcy”, one quickly realises the
F.mereency has caused extremely radical

changes, even if it will take some time
for them to work themselves out. For
the foreigner perhaps the most striking
fact is that Mr Nehru’s name almost
completely seems to have lost its magic.
There is certainly no criticism made
of him outside India that is not
made more emphatically inside. His
tiredness has been legendary for years,
but now there is a general assumption
that he is an exhausted if not a broken
man. People talk lightly of how even
Eartha Kitt was unable to extract a
word from her hero, and more seriously
no one was the least surprised when I
referred to a letter from Lord Attlee to
an Indian friend of his, which I had been
shown, saying how shocked he was by
Mr Nehru’s wandering mind, his in-
ability to keep to the point, and how
convinced he was that Nehru should
resign.
The End of Secession
T>ut the effect of the Emergency runs
down to more provincial details. One
can, for example, throw away most of
the old books on India which stress the
impending break-up of India as the
various linguistic and racial States
secede from the Union. The Emergency
did in a few days what all the portentous
committees on National Integration and
Emotional Integration had failed to do; it
showed the real unity of the country.
Faced with a common threat the old
separatist slogans of various regions
were quickly dropped, secession is now a
dead issue, and some of the latest books
already out of date.
This was particularly clear in Madras,
in the south-east of India, which was my
first stop and which has been the centre
of one of the main secessionist parties,
little known outside India but notorious
inside the DMK (Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam), which has 25 per cent of
the seats in the State Legislature and
controls Madras city. According to its
propaganda, confirmed with angry
passion by a young DMK politician
whom I met in an office decorated with
paintings of Indian heroes and Mrs Annie
Besant, the southerners are a different
race and civilisation from the north-
erners. “We are Tamil-speaking Dravi-
diens. We were conquered by northern
Hindi-speaking Aryans who put the
Brahmin caste in charge here as their
gauleiters.” The DMK has therefore
been anti - Brahmin, anti - North, anti-
Hindi, and has demanded an indepen-
dent Republic of South India within the
British Commonwealth. (Some of them
are also against religion in general and
go around smashing Hindu statues and
organising non-Hindu secular marriages,
but when I asked about this the DMK
representative said they now left this

which means “Big Brother” has to be
seen and heard to be believed.
But in the week I arrived in Madras,
the DMK officially abandoned the
secessionist plank in its platform which
it had already suspended for the duration
of the Emergency. The congratulations
it received from all over India are one
indication of the sigh of relief many
northerners felt that secession is no
longer an issue.
In future the DMK will confine itself
to attacking the Brahmins, the North-
erners, and the proposal to make Hindi
a national language. Each week from
now on one of its leaders will publicly
burn that chapter of the Indian constitu-
tion and then be arrested as a martyr
of the Tamil - speaking lower castes
victimised by the stooges of the Aryans
from the North. Absurd as this may
sound, the rage with which one DMK
officer flung on to the table an official
post-card from Delhi written in Hindi,
“when I wrote to them in English, not
Tamil”, was a private indication of the
passion the issue can arouse.
Rajagopalachari
Tn Madras the DMK has, on this
A language issue, the unexpected
support of one of the elder statesmen
of India—the last Governor-General and
a former Chief Minister in Madras and
founder of the anti-Congress Swatantra
(Freedom) Party—C. R. Rajagopalachari
(“Rajaji” as he is known and even listed
in the phone book). “Why all this talk
of making Hindi a national language
in the name of unity,” he asks,
“when its most obvious effect is
to provoke violent disunity? In any
case English is established on the soil
of India, it is an international language,
and by having two official languages
in New Delhi, each office will be
divided with two linguistic factions.”
Now 84—in better health than 10
years ago—he meets visitors in his Party
office after 6 p.m. I was taken to meet
him by his friend and biographer, the
English writer Monica Felton who has
settled in Madras. Witty, far more
mentally alert than most of his visitors,
boasting of being a man of the nine-
teenth century, still a messianic figure,
he is now the most powerful voice for
conservative liberalism in India.
Thriving on controversy, whether
joining in Gandhi’s non - co-operation
movement before the war, or supporting
the British when all Congress opposed
them, or attacking Nehru when all
Indians seemed to adore him, he re-
minded me of a sort of mixture of the
late Dr D. Mannix and the late Professor
J. Anderson —with the additional element
of the practical politician. (One of his
books is a translation of Plato’s “Trial
of Socrates” into Tamil.)
In an unending stream of articles in
his Party newspaper, “Swarajya”, he
describes the Indian people as demoral-
ised by Congress Party corruption, the
civil service reduced to spineless flat-
terers, traditional Indian values under-
mined by the State. There is too much
emphasis on quick industrialisation
(“Occident-mania misleads our dictator
and the fawning crowd around him eggs
him on”), too much emphasis on national
unification, too much central planning,
too many controls. He stands for com-
mercial freedom, traditional Indian
values, and is one of the few to support
the right of minorities whether
Muslims, Christians or castes —to organ-
ise. “Must the Hindus be free to use their
majority strength in India and call
Muslim self-defence communal, while
their own communal activities go by the
grand name of secular democracy? When
Communists can walk, heads erect, to the
polling booth in a democracy, must a
Muslim or Catholic or Brahmin or Sikh
be prevented because he believes in his
scriptures?”
Some of his critics, having no answer
to his questions, mock this old friend of
Gandhi's as “too logical” or as an
“ex-patriot” (ex-patriate). But although
his Swatantra Party only won 18 out of
494 seats in the last election, he has
succeeded in emphatically reviving
liberal ideas in Indian politics.
The Castes
Tt does not take long in any part of
India to be involved in a discussion
of the caste question. In national
politics the multiplicity of castes means
that to some extent each cancels the
other out, but in State politics all
parties exploit caste loyalties and pre-
judices: the caste system is to this extent
being intensified rather than eliminated.
In Madras the caste war is especially
strong.
I got the Brahmin view from a pro-
fessor in Presidency College. “There is,”
he said, “persecution of the Brahmins
now. They are becoming the Harijans
(untouchables) of India. Perhaps one
can understand why, but the price of it
all is declining standards wherever you
look. Take the universities, for example.
It is Government policy, in the name of
justice and equality, that a quota of the
lower castes must be admitted to the
university. All right. But the educa-
tional level of many of the castes is low
and many of them can barely understand
English which is the medium of instruc-
tion.
“Then Government policy goes
further still. A quota of these lower
castes must also ‘pass’ the examinations,
whatever the marks. For them the 50
per cent mark, which all Brahmins must
get and which a few of the others will
get anyhow, is reduced to 33 per cent, or
lower. They go out as doctors or
engineers when they are not qualified for
anything. Also by Government policy
a quota of them has to be admitted to
the civil service. So naturally standards
are declining in every possible field. The
worst of them become schoolteachers,
who are shockingly paid in India. Barely
able to speak English, they teach it to
others who in time come here to study
in English to get their degrees. Of
course many of them get no jobs at all
and are easy material for Hindu
nationalists, Tamil nationalists or Com-
munists to work on.”
I asked an upper-caste non-Brahmin
financier about this, who agreed that
standards were falling but thought it
was a price worth paying for the time
being if India is ever to get equality.
“Of course there should be more allow-
ance for merit, regardless of caste, but
without an official anti-Brahmin crash
programme, the Brahmins Would never
give up their privileges. Remember they
had a political and commercial strangle-
hold on this region, even though they
are only 3 per cent of the people. They
still have top jobs in all departments out
of all proportion to their numbers. And
whatever they say, they simply will not
recognise merit outside their own caste.

dians and Aryans was actually in-
vented by the Brahmins to justify their
feelings of superiority. They speak a
Sanskritised Tamil to separate them-
selves from the rest of the people, they
regard all non-Brahmins as Sudras, they
emphasise different aspects of Hinduism
from the rest of us with more emphasis
on certain rituals than on ethics, and
they, do or did, regard themselves as
Aryans, not Dravidians. They invented
the DMK's ideas and provoked the party
into existence.
“Anyhow, do you think that examina-
tion marks at the university are the only
way to test ability? If they are, then the
Brahmins with their long family tradi-
tions of study and memorising will
always do better. Yes, standards may be
falling a little, but not as much as the
Brahmins say, and in any case, what else
can be done?”
Several Brahmins spoke in the same
vein. As one put it: “I’m a non-
practising Brahmin. It’s like being a
Jew in Europe. I was born that way,
I can’t help it. But I don’t believe in it.”
The Plan
T was in Delhi at the time of the mid-
-*■ term analysis of the Third Five-Year
Plan (and coincidentally of the dedication
of one of the world’s great dams, the
Bhakra, which promises prosperity to
the Punjab and adjoining regions). The
three plans to date claim many successes:
between 1951 and 1961, national income
went up 42 per cent, agricultural pro-
duction up 41 per cent, industrial pro-
duction 94 per cent, there were 4000
new hospitals built, four million acres of
waste-land reclaimed and colonised, and
so on.
But the Press and public opinion
generally is critical of the Plans. Business
attacks the planners’ control of com-
mercial decisions, landowners attack the
upheavals caused by ineffective land-
reforms (as once in NSW, landowners
break up their properties by “selling”
to dummies), and the ordinary peasant,
whose standard of living in most parts
of India has not risen since Indepen-
dence, remains indifferent.
A controversial book has recently
appeared “Blossoms in the Dust”, by
Kusum Nair which attacks the basic
assumptions of the Plans. One of these
is that all peasants (82 per cent of the
population in India’s 550,000 villages)
are undergoing the world-wide revolution
of rising expectations. Show them, the
Plan assumes on a pilot farm, how to
increase production and how to make
more money, and they will rush to follow
suit. Kusum Nair, who began touring
India for the Government but resigned
to make an independent study, visited
hundreds of villages and concluded that
the problem with the peasants is not
rising expectations, but no expectations.
You can show them how to increase
production, but they do not want to.
You can point to a sick or hungry
family and ask, “But don't you need
more money”, and the answer will be,
“God will provide”. Alternatively, some
will use the techniques of increasing
production in one half of the year—in
order not to work at all in the other half.
The Plan in other words does not
interest the ordinary person. It is
for those hypocritical Congress Party
wallahs, for the protected business
monopolies and the labor unions in
them, not for the peasant. (I was re-
minded of the fine blocks of flats I saw
in Madras, built for the fishermen.
When they were finished the fishermen
refused to vacate their villages. No one
had asked them if they wanted flats.)
There is an almost universal criticism
now of the Government’s emphasis, par-
ticularly during the Second Plan,
possibly under Peking influence, on
speedy industrialisation. The ideal that
torments Indian planners is the economic
takeoff. It would have been better, and
would still be better, one hears repeated
across India, to concentrate more on
increasing the production of consumer
goods so that Indians would feel their
standards of living rising and gradually-
become more prepared for “basic” pro-
ductivity, and less on costly heavy
industry that may not pay off for many
years. If the planners argue that India
has no choice but to strengthen itself
industrially as quick as possible in view
of China’s strength, the answer is that
in any case India will not be industrially
powerful for some generations yet and
must depend on the West in a crisis.
So why make the people suffer unneces-
sarily in the meantime?
One answer of course is that the Left-
wing of the Congress Government
simply believes in planning—inspired in
many cases by Russia and formerly by
China, and blessed by Mr Nehru whose
ideas were formed in the 1920 s and
19305.
The Muslims
“ F ° r the first time in my life,” the
Muslim writer told me, “I’ve been
made to feel a Muslim. This is only in
the last year or so. It’s so ridiculous.
I’m an Indian. Hell, who would want to
live in Pakistan? Ask the Kashmiris.”
Almost every Hindu outside the
fanatical sects tells you at first that
there is no problem. “This is a secular
State, unlike Pakistan. We are all
Indians.” But every now and then
someone will refer to fears that Pakistan
would never settle just for Kashmir, even
if it would get it; it wants Delhi! “They
remember the Moghul conquest and
want to reconquer us.” Whether or not
you take that seriously, its being said at
all is alarming. And every now and
then there is a Muslim riot and someone
puts up the Muslim League flag of
Pakistan, or a Muslim is arrested for
spying for Pakistan. It is admitted that
no Muslim can get ahead in the Indian
Army, and in some big businesses
there is also a prejudice against them.
(The Government is more meticulous,
and Muslims occupy important positions
in the civil service.)
I asked the Vice-President of India,
Dr Zakir Hussein, a Muslim and a dis-
tinguished scholar, about it. Without
conceding there was a real problem, he
blamed Pakistan for whatever there was.
“If the Pakistanis once recognised and
admitted that Muslims are not persecuted
in India, they would lose their whole
raison d’etre. They exist to protect
Muslims —who do not need protection.
So they have to whip up issues all the
time. Radio Pakistan will not leave
Indian Muslims alone, and Pakistan’s
flirtation with China when she is occupy-
ing our territory does not help.”
I asked him about the usual panacea,
a confederation of the two countries.
“Not in my life-time, but ultimately,
yes. We share the same culture, the
same languages, and will have the same
enemies. Time will heal the wounds.”
As for Kashmir, it is insoluble. India
has invested heavily in Kashmir and
the Muslims on the Indian side are better
off than on the Pakistani side. But if
there were a plebiscite, Muslim revival-
ists would come down from Pakistan and

offer the choice: “Hindu gold on the one
hand, God and his poor Prophet on the
other.” The Kashmiris would vote for
Pakistan, and all Muslims in India would
immediately become suspect; there would
be communal riots and mass killings.
India will never run that risk.
Prohibition
Tn some parts of India it takes about
"*■ half the day to get your “alcoholics’
permit” which allows you nine bottles
of beer or a bottle of spirits per month.
(It’s no use claiming you’re more than
an alcoholic, that you’re a dipsomaniac
—you get no more liquor.) An army of
clerks looks over your papers when
they haven’t disappeared for tea and
another army of policemen enforces pro-
hibition. Such a huge waste of public
money, in such a poor country, for the
sake of an absurd policy that is a com-
plete failure is really disheartening.
And it is a failure. In cosmopolitan
Bombay, especially in the art - film-
journalistic - advertising cocktail circuit,
the city sometimes seems awash with
liquor—Scotch (£l2 a bottle or more,
black-market) for show, bootleg moon-
shine for oneself and one’s close friends.
The bootleg stuff, of quite good quality,
is called “country” (where it is made)
and it is brought into Bombay through
the police barriers in all the usual ways:
in the false bottoms of vases women
carry on their heads, in half a dozen hot-
water bottles (one for each client)
strapped around the waste, in milk
trucks. (The sensational Press had
alleged some lepers carry it in because
the police are scared to search them.)
It is cheap and can be supplemented by
the legal quota —which any Indian can
get by knowing the right doctor to
certify you an “alcoholic”. In addition
Services are all “wet” and there are
plenty of associate members.
The Press
A s well as moonshine, Bombay pro-
duces the famous and controversial
Indian weekly “Blitz”—famous because
it introduced “yellow journalism” into
the fairly staid Press world of India,
controversial because of the question
whether it sells for its scandal or for its
violently anti - American, pro - Soviet
political line; if it sells for its politics it
may be the most sinister publication in
India. Launched on a shoe-string by a
Parsee of genius, R. K. Karanjia, in 1941
as a pro-British sheet during Congress’s
“Quit India” campaign, it now outsells
all the daily papers. Plausibly rumored
to be financed by the Russians, it runs,
along with some excellent features and
useful disclosures, a number of Soviet
propaganda hand-outs the dailies won’t
touch and anti - American smears


which protocol prevents the Russians
publishing openly in India.
Now in his fifties, Koranjia sits
behind a boomerang-shaped desk in a
small office surrounded by pictures of
himself with Nehru, with Khrushchev,
with Nasser, with Kassem and with
Fredrick, March (“He’s some film star
I met in Hollywood, I’ve forgotten his
name”).
“They can call it yellow journalism,”
he told me. “But my models of yellow
journalism are the Sermon on the Mount
and the Ten Commandments. They were
great yellow journalism. They got
through to the people.
“We have no trouble getting stories.
We get a lot from journalists on the
dailies stories the dailies won’t run.
Look up a copy of our story about the
Press baron caught smuggling foreign
exchange. Not one daily mentioned it.
“Indian editors are just PR touts for
their bosses. I’ve seen famous editors
running around trying to get prominent
people to their boss’s parties. The Press
is just a subsidiary of other business
interests —jute or cement —and they use
the papers to force licences out of the
Government.”
This is the standard Left criticism of
the Press in India. In fact the Indian
Press is too dull, does not do enough
investigating, disclosure or reporting—
but it is generally critical of the central
Government which is by far the most
dangerous influence on the Press. The
Press depends largely on newsprint
rations allotted by the Government and
on advertisements from Government
enterprises. Any editor tells of stories
of how such and such an editorial
criticising Nehru provoked phone calls
of warning from Government officials.
Yet it is clear from the wide variety of
Left, Right, and Centre publications that
the habit of free speech is established
in India, and as the Press will expand
with increasing literacy, its history has
only just begun—unless a “Blitz” type
Communism takes over the whole Press.
The Communists
TAne of the most extraordinary things
in -India today is the speed with
which the Communist Party of India has
re-established itself as a patriotic party.
At the time of the Chinese invasion, the
party seemed in ruins. Its offices were
wrecked, its leaders arrested, its great
Government patron, Khrisna Menon,
dismissed from Cabinet. Since then it
has officially adopted a strong pro-
Soviet line, its great pro-Peking leaders
such as A. K. Gopalan, MP, has been
censured by the dominant faction.
Some of this new respectability may
be attributed to the influence Mr Nehru:
the Communist leader, S. A. Dange,
has been his emissary to Moscow, and
at the time of his Parliamentary censure
motion, Mr Nehru greeted the Com-
munist crowd that demonstrated in his
support outside his office. He may be
disillusioned with China but still sees
Russia through the eyes of a 1920’s and
1930's Left intellectual. More important,
Russia by not supporting China and
giving some small aid to India has
improved its image, and its agents now
have new and subtler opportunities for
subversion and for influence on the
Government.
In fact the Communists of India seem
actually to have profited from the
Chinese invasion.
After Nehru
HThe range and severity of criticism
A of Nehru that one hears all over
India makes it impossible to believe
that he still commands anything like the
loyalty he once held. Assuming it is
true that he is still a hero to the
peasants more so even than Gandhi
ever was, according to some —he is all-
too-human in the eyes of, say, the
newspaper-reading public. Sometimes
the criticism is tempered by re-
marks like: “He got us into this mess
•—all that Hindi-Chini bai-bai stuff
but he’s getting us out,” or “You’ve got
to admire him as a blackmailer, getting
aid from the Russians as well as the
West.”
But no one seems alarmed at the
thought of his leaving Indian politics.
It is almost impossible to predict his
replacement—though L. B. Shastri seems
the favored guess—and in any case India
is not short of political talent.
Yet one thing seems clear: the
age of Nehru has passed and
with it the simple faith in the economic
magic of Planning and the moral magic
of Non-alignment. (India remains un-
committed to either Russia or the West
as military blocs, but with Russia sharing
a border with her this is a matter of
national interest, not morals.) Perhaps
the biggest result of the Emergency is
that the old-style moral non-aligners
who saw no difference between Russia
and the West, except that the West was
a greater danger to freedom and peace,
are now the freaks and fossils of India.
As Nehru, the greatest of the old non-
aligners said, “We have been living in
a dream-world.”
What seems to be happening now is
an increasingly emphatic division be-
tween liberal pro-Western Indians and
committed pro-Communists. The Leftists
have the advantage of fifteen years of
Government propaganda in favor of
State Socialism and in defence of Com-
munist goodwill: they know what they
want to do and have an ideology pre-
pared for them. The liberals are more
confused and are uncertain how to
translate their best asset traditional
Indian ideals into modern progressive
language. But whether or not the
common prediction is true that after
Nehru the Congress Party will split into
separate Right and Left wing parties, it
seems clear that Indians themselves are
bound to become more divided with
.the lifting of the fog of fifteen years of
“Socialism” in a country less planned
than Australia or even America, and of
non-alignment in a dream world with-
out power politics.
It will sound an absurd thing to say
of a country so ancient and civilised as
India, but Indians often seemed in the
past to have lacked a sense of history
and real politics. The Chinese invasion
brought them into reality.

OUT AND ABOUT
John Gielgud
“I’m not a modern-looking man ..."
By DAVID GREEN
Oir John Gielgud was tired. In two
days he had travelled from New York
to Adelaide and in an hour he would
start another 1500-mile flight to Perth.
He was glad to settle into an airport
chair, to stretch his legs, to sip a scotch
and soda, to smoke an elegant oval
cigarette.
For a while his fluent hands were
almost silent. But his voice was strong,
rich and English. Its pitch was neither
high nor low, its volume neither loud
nor soft, its speech neither slow nor
fast. . . .
After his body had rid itself of the
deafness and tremblings of air travel,
his hands began to talk. They spoke
with a man’s voice, forcefully but grace-
fully. His face is, in the main, refined,
strengthened by the high cheekbones of
his Polish ancestors and made more mas-
culine by his eagle-like nose.
He is sft llin. tall but looks taller.
He is lean but says he puts on weight
easily, particularly if he drinks beer. “I
can’t make up my mind whether it is
better to be fat or scrawny in old age,”
he said. He does no exercise except that
which comes through acting. “I don’t
play cards, cricket, golf or billiards. I
can’t swim or ride or even drive a car.
I used to play the piano a bit but not
now. Apart from travel and reading I’m
interested in nothing but the theatre and,
to a lesser extent, films, painting and
music.”
It was as a joking aside that Sir John
mentioned that recently he had been
called “the father of the British theatre”.
Chronologically this might be nonsense.
But at 59 Gielgud has become the spirit-
ual father of the British stage, and like
a father of 59 he has come to the point
in his life at which he is content to give
up most of the spotlight himself and re-
tire behind the scenes to control and
direct.
“I’ve passed the age at which I want
to get up on a stage and show myself
off to people,” he said. “Acting means
six days work a week, eight performances
a week, every week of the year and after
30 or 40 years this gets a little irksome.
At my age there aren’t many Shake-
spearean roles left to play, except perhaps
Prospero. I’d prefer now to direct most
of the time, and to act every now and
again.”
“Ages of Man”, the name of the recital
performances he is giving round Austra-
lia is a mixture of the two. “I could
never play Romeo or Hamlet in costume
in a full-scale performance, but in a recital
I can show how I would play the scene,”
he said. “It is like a director showing
an actor how he wants him to perform.
“It’s very difficult really. All my life
I’ve taken refuge behind grease-paint
and make-up. In this, without the bene-
fit of sets or players around me I feel
frightfully exposed. I find it takes a lot
of courage to overcome this. One is
terrified that the audience will see one
as mutton dressed as lamb, which I
really am. Making love on a balcony
dressed in a dinner suit ... it can make
one feel a little ridiculous. But one must
let the poetry speak for itself. I talk a
little about Shakespeare because I’ve
learnt quite a bit about him over all

“One must let the poetry speak. It will
depend on my mood as to how I will
play a scene, and also, of course, on the
mood of the audience. 1 never play the
same scene twice the same way.
“The one thing that worries me is
that I might fail one night. There is
such a responsibility doing a one-man
recital. In a company you can have an
off night and you can sit back and let
someone else carry the show while you
think what you’re going to have for
dinner or add up a few accounts. . . .”
Sir John has been playing “Ages of
Man” since he did it at an Edinburgh
festival five years ago. “I’d never con-
sidered doing it as a full-scale perform-
ance but it had such a success that I’ve
played it in London, New York, in
Israel and even in Europe when the
audience didn’t understand the langu-

memory in the foyer of the Opera House.

of seven, and later he was taken to
many of the plays in which his Terry

brother Val (now head of the BBC’s
sound drama department) played with a
model theatre. John painted the back-
drops and Val wrote the mystery melo-
dramas they performed. John was head
boy at his preparatory school, excelling
at English and religious studies, and was
awarded a non-residential scholarship to
Westminster School.
At the age of 16 he decided that he
wanted to become a stage designer. His
family protested, his father, a prosper-
ous stockbroker, wanted him to become
an architect. He, therefore, made a
bargain with his family. If he had not
made a success of the stage by the time
that he was 25 he would turn to archi-
tecture.
For a year he studied for the stage
at Lady Benson’s school and durine this
time he worked as an unpaid extra at
the Old Vic. It was as a herald in
Henry V that he spoke his first line:
“Here is the number of the slaughter’d
French.”
From this point his ideas changed from
set designing to acting. Aged 17, he won
a scholarship to the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art where he came under the
influence of Claude Rains. He worked
for two years in J. B. Fagan’s repertory
company until, at the age of 19, he
played Romeo in Sir Barry Jackson’s
London production. Gielgud’s career
after this had some ups and downs but
the general trend was a steady upward
progress. It reached its youthful peak
in 1937 when he played Hamlet in New
York with Lillian Gish as Ophelia and
Judith Anderson as Gertrude.
“I was lucky in a way,” he said. “I
was young and because of the staid Vic-
torian attitude to Shakespeare audiences
had become used to maturer actors play-
ing the part. I saw John Barrymore
playing it when he was 47 ... he was
the oldest I’ve seen.” Next year Gielgud
will direct Richard Burton as Hamlet
in New York.
“I was doing some rehearsals before
I came to Australia without Burton be-
cause he is still involved in a film. I
saw him play Hamlet at the Old Vic. I
didn’t like it much and I was rather
pleased when he asked if I’d direct him
ifr Nev,' — ~ * .
“Godot” still baffles
has had most of his successes
in Shakespeare although he has
interspersed this work with modern plays.
“Perhaps I should have done more
modern stuff when I was young but I
didn’t want to play Shaw or Ibsen. I
didn’t like their work. I liked Chekhov
but not many other people did then.
Perhaps it was just that they were new
and I wasn’t used to them. Today, for
example, I much prefer Shaw to Becket.
I’ve read and seen ‘Waiting For Godot’
several times and I still can’t under-
stand it.”
Gielgud must understand a play be-
fore it satisfies him. His understanding
must be complete. He is frequently dis-
satisfied with Shakespeare. Two years
ago he was about to play Othello. He
wrote to one of his old directors, George
Rylands, to ask whether Rylands thought
Desdemona was still a virgin when she
arrived in Cyprus. He said that it was
very important that he should know this
if he were to play Othello,
i Gielgud said he thought there were
two lines in the play which suggested
that Desdefnona was a virgin and that
Othello did not consummate the marri-
age before leaving Venice. If this were
so and their marriage night did not
take place until they arrived in Cyprus,
would that not suggest that Othello was
something more than the impulsive ani-
mal he is generally supposed to be,
reasoned Gielgud.
He is dissatisfied with modern play-
wrights for other reasons. “I thought Os-
borne was excellent in ‘Look Back In
Anger’ but he’s done nothing since. So
many modern writers show off their
democracy and their smuttiness these
days. Shake?oaaf« -Was ..broad-minded
but he was never dirty merely to shock.
So many have chips on their shoulders.
I think it’s something that came out of
the war. They think I’m Establishment
and probably they think that I’m a snob,
too, because I only play kings and prin-
ces. But I would like to play in a modern
play again if a good part turned up.
They’re very hard to find and last year
both Olivier and Redgrave were in
modern plays which failed.
“I’m so terribly difficult to cast in
modern plays. I’m not a modern-looking
man and I couldn’t play low-life parts
or anything in dialect.”
"Just watch where you're aiming that damn thing!"

Australia’s Nuclear Migrants
Mostly from America
By PATRICIA ROLFE
One of the most heartening, but
from some points of view in-
explicable, successes the Immigra-
tion Department has had in the past
year or two has been the increased num-
ber of Americans who have come here.
The department does not actively can-
vass for people in the United States, al-
though it offers assisted passages, and
expresses itself “surprised” that the num-
ber of Americans coming here to live
permanently is slowly growing.
In 1961-62 1050 migrants, 455 of
them on assisted passages, came here
from the United States. This was an
increase on the previous year and a
higher figure is expected for 1962-63.
Most of them announced their reasons
for coming as “better opportunities” or
the hope that their children won’t grow
up so quickly here, or because they re-
gard Australia as the “last frontier.”
These are all the right reasons as far as
the Immigration Department is con-
cerned. However, there is one group of
Americans whose reason for leaving
home is more succinct. They call them-
selves “nuclear migrants.”
They believe, one of them said, “that
the statistical odds for a nuclear war
are so great that it is neither safe nor
sane to remain in the vicinity of what
will be an area of war.”
The avowed nuclear migrants in Aus-
tralia are linked only in a loose sort of
freemasonry and none of them, appar-
ently, knew each other before leaving
home. One of them totted up about 50
people in Sydney who share the same
grim belief and the same determination
to cut themselves off from their own
country. He said there was a group,
probably smaller, in Melbourne, and that
most of those who came to Australia
chose the larger cities because they be-
lieved it was easier to get work there. He
said that many had gone to New Zealand
(600 Americans entered New Zealand on
permanent visas last year) but that it
was harder to get a permanent visa for
New Zealand.
The strenuous nuclear migrant believes
that the reasons most Americans give for
coming here the last frontier, and so
on are, either consciously or uncon-
sciously, only a blind. “Lack of oppor-
tunities in America —that's perfectly
ridiculous,” one of them said. “There are
still plenty of opportunities in America.”
These people call themselves nuclear
migrants, but only at times. They have
learnt not to at other, times, because it
simply means being branded as some
sort of oddball. “If I go to a party and
some girl asks me why did I come to
Australia and I tell her the real reason,
the next thing is I see her disappearing
to the other side of the room with a
funny look on her face,” a nuclear
migrant said.
“In America if we told someone that
we were going to Australia as nuclear
migrants, they thought we were mad. But
at least they knew what we were talking
about, even if they thought it was danger-
ous nonsense. But if you say something
like that to an Australian, in most cases
he thinks it is just plain nonsense.”
Some of the nuclear migrants admit
to another fear, deportation. In some
cases, and one hopes, groundlessly, they
believe that any nonconformist view or
conduct may mean deportation. “While
another American, such as, perhaps,
Harold Orr, the schoolteacher who was
deported, might regard it as an incon-
venience or disappointment, we regard
deportation as the equivalent of a death
sentence,” he said.
It is partly because of this that most
of the nuclear migrants wish to preserve
what they call anonymity. This means
that they wish to fit as inconspicuously
as possible into Australian life, to forget
where they came from and why.
Recently five of them overcame their
passion for anonymity to compile a series
of articles for the Left-wing magazine
“Outlook,” entitled “These United
States.” Most of these covered fairly old
ground. Mrs Irene Summy compared the
success of a neighbor's campaign for
cleaner city streets in Boston with the
failure of her own campaign against
nuclear weapons; Mr Ron Richter sug-
gested that recent American novels often
dealt with the inability of the protagon-
ist to face up to the demands of the
world in which he lived, and suggested
that the solution was to “Run, Rabbit,
Run”; Mr Ron Smith wrote about “The
Ugly American.” All this, “Outlook” said,
added up to the fractured American
dream.
In spite of the wish for anonymity,
a picture of the nuclear migrant does
emerge. The group in Sydney is remark-
ably homogeneous. They are:
• Aged between 20 and 40.
• Almost invariably married.
• Often Quakers. Some attend the
Society of Friends house in Sydney.
• Mainly teachers. About 70 per
cent of the Sydney group had worked
as teachers at some level and are teaching
here. The other occupational group was
missile workers, some of whom have
switched to teaching here as readily
available work.
These migrants do not come from any
one part of the United States. None
knew each other before coming, nor were
any of them persuaded by anyone to
come. In each case it was an individual,
isolated decision.
The motives of these nuclear migrants
are not entirely simple. Some come here
because they believe there will be a nu-
clear war and they have a better chance
of surviving here. Others say they don’t
want to live in a country which makes
nuclear weapons. Others are absorbed,
or obsessed, with fallout. With some of
the more sophisticated these issues are
extended to condemnation of the crude
commercialism of the 20th century,
heavy industrialisation, “Hollywood”
civilisation, and even juvenile delin-
quency.
Then they open a map and look at
the Southern Hemisphere. South America
is generally ruled out because of the
language difficulty and South Africa be-
cause of its racial policies.
The first choice of many is New Zea-
land, which to most Americans conjure
up a picture of a green, lush land. Aus-
tralia, on the other hand, is thought of
as a dry, yellow country. The green, lush
land is tied up with the idea of a return
to the simple life. The more sophisticated
and practical of the nuclear migrants
think in terms of jobs or in terms of
living a life as close as possible to the
one they have left. These choose Aus-
tralia.
Members of the Sydney group do not
feel that they are expatriates in the
classic American sense, although some
of them feel they recognise signs of this
in their fellows. “Most of us had good
jobs at home and were happy there,” one
said. “We had no great loathing of
America, only a sadness about the way
things are going there. We also have no
great ideas that any country is basically
different from another.”
These migrants say they are here for
life. They haven't come just in sudden
panic. “None of us feel that nuclear war
is going to come right away. Some of us
may think five years. Some of us may
even think 20 years.”
And, of course, it may never come, a
possibility the nuclear migrants must face
with, let us say, mixed feelings.

Squeeze bottles with “muscles’
Perhaps you have noticed the big difference
in squeeze bottles? Some rely on the weight of
the contents to push them back into shape
after you squeeze. Others bounce back under
the power of muscles which are all their own.
Most often the bouncier bottles are made
from a special type of polyethylene resin made
in Australia by UNION CARBIDE. It was devel-
oped to meet awkward needs in packaging
medicines and cosmetics where squeeze
bottles must be soft and pliable, yet particu-
larly resilient and strong.
Polyethylene resins have been specially
developed for other purposes, too: pipe, pack-
aging film, and cable coatings, for example.
Polyethylene is one of many products made
better through UNION CARBIDE research.
Others include chemicals, industrial products,
and EVEREADY batteries and flashlights.

Two Impressions
1. Archbishop Mannix
“And I never owned a motor car ...”
By PETER HASTINGS
[These are impressions of two great Australian figures, Archbishop Mannix and
Professor Griffith Taylor. Neither was born here. Each was radically different
from the other. Both, in different ways, made Australian history .]
T met Archbishop Mannix once and
A that was on a grey, dripping,
winter’s afternoon several years ago when
I went out to visit him at Raheen with
Bob Santamaria..
Raheen itself was enormously impres-
sive.
Two handsome wrought-iron gates
superimposed with the Archbishop’s arms
guarded the doorway, beyond which was
the enormous entrance hall with a mas-
sive staircase leading to the second storey.
“See that staircase?” said Santamaria, “he
climbs up that every day to go to bed..
We've begged him to make a bedroom
downstairs so he can conserve his energy.
But he insists on climbing those stairs.
At his age! Last year, you know, he had
a very bad fall, broke his nose and two
fingers of one hand. He was in consider-
able pain when I saw him later, but he
smiled and said, ‘Well, I’m not destined
to die young.’ He's nearly 97, you know.”
Raheen’s housekeeper led us down a
long corridor through a small courtyard
and into another corridor hung with pic-
tures of unexpected variety, including a
dim painting of Westminster, Big Ben
gleaming faintly in the night sky an
unlikely subject for such a place, but for
that, too, there was an explanation. She
asked us to wait while she went into
the study to tell Dr Mannix we had
arrived and to take away his luncheon-
tray. “He hardly eats a thing,” Santa-
maria said. “He hasn’t for years. He
seems to thrive on it, though.” The
housekeeper emerged. “You may go in
now.” Santamaria turned to me. “Let
me go in first and then you follow me,
and I’ll introduce you. I'll seat you close
to him so that he hears you. Actually
his hearing is remarkable for one of
his age, but it will be more comfortable
for you both if you are seated near to
each other.”
I followed him into the room. Like
all of Raheen’s rooms it was huge. Large
bay-windows gave a view of green lawns
and a distant rust-red brick fence. The
lofty ceiling seemed dim even in the
light from the end windows. A couch
was on one side, a huge bookcase
stretched along one wall. A table was
covered in a profusion of books and
papers. An air-conditioner hummed near
one window and a large log fire blazed
from a grate. Near it, in an armchair,
shading his eyes from the light of a table
lamp, sat Dr Mannix, his biretta a vivid
splash of purple amid the sombre furnish-
ings. As my companion made his way
around the table Dr Mannix heard him
and with little apparent effort stood up.
Bob dropped to one knee and kissed his
ring. To me the Archbishop offered a
frail, dry hand to shake. He was taller
than 1 had expected, thin and erect. His
hair sprouted in silver tufts from under
his biretta. His eyes were dim with age
but his gaze was steady and impersonal.
TTe was an immensely old man in whom
there was miraculously little de-
terioration of physical function and men-
tal alertness, although he himself hinted,
a little ironically, that he thought there
had been. He was courteous, shy and
reserved. Asking me to sit down, peril-
ously close to the fire, he folded his
arms, hands under armpits, and waited
for me to begin. I began by saying how
much I appreciated his seeing me, that
he was to me, as to thousands of Aus-
tralians, an almost legendary figure, and
then I stopped, because you cannot talk
to the living as if they are a monument
of history. A slow smile crept across the
fine mouth, obliterating for a moment
the deep lines which run down beside his
jaw. “All this,” he said, “is very alarming
to me,” and waited for me to continue.
His voice was that of an old man, but
there was no hesitation. The purpose of
my visit was to discuss the controversy
between himself and Dr Rumble. We
discussed it at some length. He was not,

together
as I had thought he m ght be, scornful,
but incisive and definite. He was right in
his interpretation of the 1959 Papal de-
cree and Sydney was wrong. If there
was any contention it was between Syd-
ney and Rome, not between Sydney and
Melbourne. As he talked he leaned for-
ward to make his point just as he leant
forward in a nervous, courteous gesture
perhaps to make sure of the question
when he was addressed. Now and then
he clapped both hands together before
returning them to a folded position. He
spoke with a faint Irish accent of “the
aut’orities” and of “t'eology.”
The “hard-bargaining” Irish
T pointed to the immense bookcase
which stretched to the ceiling. Had he
chosen that? “No,” he said. “When we
bought the place in 1918 it had belonged
to a doctor. That bookcase was filled
with books.” He smiled slowly. “Not
those books, of course. And all the
furniture you see belonged to the house.
You see, we Irish drive a hard bargain.
After, you must see the place if you
wish. Through there” he pointed to
a pair of curiously Byzantine windows,
leadlighted in colored glass, on the op-
posite wall - “was the ballroom. I
turned it into a library.” And could he
tell me what that little Japanese doll was
in a little glass case on the lower shelf
of the bookcase? “It was a present given
to me by a Japanese bishop who visited
me.” He neither elaborated nor attempted
to keep a conversation going. He was
precise, interested, and that, perhaps, was
enough.
Near the bookcase, almost lost in the
enormous room, was a television set. Was
His Grace a TV fan? Again the little
movement forward from his chair, a little
clapping of the hands. “Am 1a...?”
Did he like television? “Well, now, I
do not see so very much of it. I watch
the news at night, and that is perhaps
all.” My companion interposed. “Your
Grace sometimes watches football.” “Ah,
yes. The football. But I find it hard to
distinguish which side is which, you
know. I am supposed to be a barracker
for Collingwood. I suppose because Col-
lingwood is in the vicinity. But the truth
of it is that I have never seen a football
match in my life.” He gestured humor-
ously. “So you see . . . ” Another silence
settled on the room. He was reclining in
his chair, his eyes were half closed, and
I thought it was time that we spared
him further strain. Would His Grace
permit us to leave? The eyes flew open.
“I am never tired. I am too old to get
tired.” We spoke of Ireland and how it
was changing. (“It needed to change.”)
Had he felt expatriated in coming to
this country all those years ago? “Not
at all. I really settled in very well. You
see, I spent most of my life at Maynooth.
I was a seminarist there, later a Professor
of Philosophy, and ultimately President.
I was 49 when I came to Australia. I re-
member Adelaide and how hot it w>as; the
heat seemed to rise off the pavement and
hit me in the face. 1 thought: ‘This is
intolerable. I will not live very long in
this.’ And then I found Melbourne differ-
ent. I still did not expect to live to a great
age in those days, and as I did not play
tennis or cricket or football I decided that
I would walk every day until I was
ninety, if I lived to be ninety.
“And so I walked every day from
Raheen to St Patrick’s, the better part
of four miles in and four miles out. It
did me good.”
How did It feel, I asked, at the end of a
long life to look back on so many events
and so many achievements? “Achieve-
ments? There are many, things I have
not achieved. I have not baptised a per-
son, I have never married anyone, I have
never given the Last Rites or adminis-
tered Extreme Unction.” Santamaria
broke in. “Your Grace has baptised at
least one person. My second child.” The
Archbishop looked up sharply and sighed.
“That is so.. I had forgotten that.” He
leant back in his chair and stared into
the fire. The smile that changed his face
returned. “And I never owned a motor
• car.” And why was that? “I never saw the
need for one. I walked where 1 wanted
to go and I did not want to be encum-
bered by the need to look after a motor
car. Besides, when I needed to be, there
was always someone to drive me. Many
years ago 1 knew a man who owned one
of those very good motor cars. What are
they now? Ah . . . Rolls Royces. He
sometimes used to take me for a drive
on Sunday afternoons. One afternoon we
had one of those things, what do you
call them with the tyre? Ah, yes, a punc-
ture. 1 turned to him and said, ‘You know
if you had said your prayers this morn-
ing this would not have happened.’ Some
weeks later he came to drive me out
again one Sunday afternoon and I said
to him ‘Did you say your prayers this
morning?’ ‘No,’ he replied, but I brought
a spare wheel.”’
My companion nodded to me. It really
was time to go. I thanked the Archbishop
for his kindness. With the same uncanny
ease of movement he stood up to escort
us to the door. Santamaria dropped on
one knee and kissed his ring in farewell.
The Archbishop then held out his hand
to me to shake. I bowed slightly as I took
it and believing that I was trying to kiss
his ring he seized me with his other hand.
“No, no,” he said. “No, no.” In a ges-
ture of great courtesy he raised his biretta
and the oaken door closed behind us.

2. Griffith Taylor
"Don't listen to idle boosters ”
It was entirely due to the late Professor
Griffith Taylor that some years ago I
made a 50 miles detour by car in
order to visit Wilmington, North Caro-
lina, which enjoys the distinction of being
a homoclime of Sydney—that is, a place
whose annual average rainfall and tem-
perature approximates Sydney’s. Wil-
mington proved a small, dull town in
which a small, dull shopkeeper finding
out that I came from Australia said that
he had heard it was the biggest county
in England. I don’t think he was pulling
my leg either. Wilmington was a rather
dismal experience but a tribute, in its
way, to a man who had a profound in-
fluence on many members of my genera-
tion although I'm not sure that the rea-
sons didn’t go deeper than the fact that
Taylor was one of the world’s great geo-
graphers, with a capacity for marshalling
facts with rare precision and possessing
an exciting approach to the study of
geography and an original outlook. In my
own case I’m sure that my initial delight
on reading his “Australia” and other early
studies had a great deal to do with his
relish in debunking that expansive, mind-
less nationalism which pervaded Australia
right up to the war. Forsyth’s “Myth of
Open Spaces” had a similar effect. At all
events apart from its scientific value one
enjoyed Taylor’s ingenuity in inventing
the climograph and hythergraph by
which he severely charted the limits to
Australia’s population and economic
development. In the scientific field he
was antidote to the euphoria of Australia
Unlimited. Primarily a geologist, Taylor
became a geographer and meteorologist
and even something of an ethnologist—
he started anthropological studies at Syd-
ney University before Professor Radcliffe
Brown organised the department and
it seems a pity that he should be so widely
thought of now as being merely some
freakishly erudite recorder of rocks. The
range of his activities was enormous.
I finally met him in Toronto in the
winter of 1951 in his last year there as
Professor of Geography. I had heard he
was attending a Geographers’ Convention
in New York where I was then working
and wrote to him that if he were coming
to New York I’d like to interview him
since it was many years since he had
been in Australia. He wrote back with
brusque humour that he had not heard
of such a convention, had not been in-
vited to it, had no intention of attending
it in any case but that I could visit him
in Toronto if I wished. I did.
The Taylors lived in a pleasant, roomy
house and I remember it contained some
very large, very clear photographs of the
ice walls of Antarctica’s shores taken on
the Scott Expedition. “A special process,”
he said as he pointed them out. “Last
forever.” He was a spry, bespectacled,
elderly man with a certain joie de vivre
about him. Fie asked me to sit down and
I explained why I had come. I also ex-
plained hastily that I had read his books,
or some of them, and that they had in-
fluenced me. “But you’re a journalist,”
he expostulated, looking at me. “I didn't
think journalists were influenced by any-
thing or anybody much. Mother,” he
called out to his wife, “this man has read
my books. He’s enlightened.” I was in
and I hastened to say that the principal
reason why I had come to see him was
to asked him whether the post-war scene
in Australia had changed his mind about
his earlier predictions that Australia
simply wouldn't amount to much as a
centre of white civilisation.
He snapped his head erect and his eyes
gleamed. “Why should it? 1 can see
you've fallen for all this post-war in-
dustrial expansion talk. You should re-
read my books. It’s all there. All this talk
of industrial expansion makes me tired.”
He warmed up to his subject with prac-
tised enthusiasm. “Australia has little
hydro-electric power and insufficient rain-
fall to develop it. Even its coal seams like
the Newcastle-Bulli veins rank only 14th
in the world. Canada produces four times
as much gold as Australia, nearly twice
as much coal, 17 times more copper,
more silver and lead in addition to hav-
ing vast oil deposits. Australia doesn’t
even rank as high as Roumania in re-
sources.” He laughed delightedly. “You
musn’t listen to the idle boosters. I’ve
fought them all my life.” He told me the
now famous story of how the West Aus-
tralian Government banned his early
book on the economic geography of Aus-
tralia. “It had a map,” he beamed, “which
showed most of Western Australia mark-
ed USELESS. The Education Department
in Perth simply refused to recommend
the book for schools. I was on the black
list. Years later the Member for the
Northern Territory. actually asked the
Prime Minister in the House that I be
prevented from running down Australia.
Idle boosters. I take no notice of them.”
An intellectual pugnacity
TTe was a delight to talk to —dogmatic,
■ a ‘ A informed, enquiring, vain and imag-
inative. He was also a breath of fresh air,
a true Australian patriot (“I can’t wait
to get back to Australia. It’s the most
delightful country in the world.”) who
saw Australia with a particular cast of
mind backed by a particular scholastic
discipline. From his own standpoint he
also saw it whole and clear. It is remark-
able that his economic-geographical
vision of Australia dating from the early
1900 s should have proved so consistent
with the facts of Australian development
for so long. In the world scene Australia
was rather “small potatoes” and he in-
sisted throughout his long life that it
would remain so. His iconoclasm, his
debunking, his intellectual pugnacity
were not merely refreshing in argument
but the natural concomitants of his view
that nothing but the truth about a situa-
tion was worth finding out. He was not
very interested in personalities so far as
I could gather, except in so far as they
offered a chance for argument or refuta-
tion, although he had a high regard for
any man who had what he regarded as
scientific objectivity. He talked at some
length about the Scott Expedition and his
formidable travelling in Australia, the
South Seas, Malaya, the Indonesian
Archipelago and elsewhere. Few per-
sonalities emerged from his reminiscences
but people did how and where they
lived and what they might expect from
the earth which gave them sustenance.
He had some hard and fast notions
on physical anthropology. He had kept
up with literature on the subject but
seemed rather disdainful of social anthro-
pology. He had been involved frequently
in what he called “amusing” White Aus-
tralia arguments and had thoroughly en-
joyed demolishing what he termed his
opponents' unscientific theories. He had
written an ethnological study, “Zones
and Strata”, in 1919, in which he had
attempted to distribute the races of man
based on the mammalian distribution of
Matthews. “I came to the conclusion,”


he said, “that on the basis of Matthews’
theories the Nordics were only variants
of the Mediterranean races -which spread
through Indonesia and Melanesia to New
Zealand. 1 believe the Maoris resemble
the English because they are blood kins-
men. Both are Caspian types. I don’t
think Australians, you know, relish the
idea that the Japanese are a later evolved
stock than the Nordics. But I believe it
is scientifically true.”
What was his general conclusion from
all this? “I have always said,” he replied,
that “race prejudice is only a matter of
ethnological ignorance. Racial problems
are temporary man-made difficulties.
Don't look at the Southern US. Look at
Brazil where racial fusion has been suc-
cessful.” His head erect, his eyes gleam-
ing, he seemed very happy with this con-
clusion. He also had a sense of humour.
“You have been a geography student,”
he said as I warily nodded assent. “And
you lived in Manly, in Sydney. You must
be familiar with North Head?” I told
him that I knew every inch of it. “How
high is it?” he asked quietly. About 300
feet I answered carelessly. “It is not,” he
snorted, “it's not an inch over 150 feet
high.” 1 still haven’t checked that
fact. He was once very funny but I
never knew whether he meant to be or
not. We were drinking coffee and looking
out at the frozen street in front of the
house. Banks of half-melted snow and
slush lay about. Ice was thick, violet-
colored and treacherous in the shaded
parts of the sidewalks. “It’s warmer to-
day,” he said happily. “Oh, surely not,”
his wife replied. “Oh, yes,” Taylor re-
plied, “today’s the 20th of February. The
average temperature goes up a degree
and a half.” The following day I went
back to New York. He accompanied me
to the front door and shook my hand.
“Beware of the idle boosters in our
country,” he said. “A geographer’s life
is a hard one, even a journlist’s. Re-
member of Australia:
“Be to her real resources very kind
And to her empty spaces very blind!”
I never did find out whether it was his
own.
Big Al Moves In
Oil search in the gibber country
By S. STEPHENS
After church these Sunday mornings,
the people of Adelaide tend to
cast contented eyes north-east with
their ordained beliefs in the unlimited
resources of their State undisturbed, for
“Big Al” Jergins came to town last
month. That in itself was a fair portent
that things were bound to happen on a
large scale.
And happen they did. Before his 10-
day visit had ended, the State was more
deeply involved in the oil search business
with an office sign reading “Outback Oil
(N.L.)” in a down-town Adelaide build-
ing, and a 49.000 square mile parcel of
country awaiting the drill out near the
South and Western Australian borders.
It was, indeed, a big deal, and only an
oil millionaire from Texas, like “Big Al,”
could make it. “Big Al” is not the small
deal type. For a start, his physique is
against it. He stands six feet four inches
high and weighs 22 stone, so that almost
everything he does must be done on the
grand scale. He is a geologist by pro-
fession and a wild-catter by choice.
Under pressure, he admits to owning
an oil field or two himself and a modest
ranch in San Antonio and that he has
connections with about eight banking and
finance companies. Then there is his home
in Old Mexico, a few hours’ drive from
San Antonio, which is “about the size of
one of those city blocks of yours in
Sydney.” Pressed for more specific details,
he admits the house is 133 feet long
and takes 23 servants to run it, including
guards. Anchored in a nearby bay, “Big
Al's” 100-feet-long, £660,000 yacht, com-
plete with captain and crew, stands by
to take him fishing, although, at the
moment, he is trying to sell it. He would
like to build another one.
So, what with one thing and another,
“Big Al” seems quite a lump of man. But
how did a Texan of these dimensions
become interested in an oil lease in the
gibber country?
“Wahl,” says Al, “that house of mine
in Old Mexico has got a swimmin’ pool,
and around about last Christmas, Cy
Rubel, of Union Oil, stayed with me
for a week. All the time he was sittin’
around that pool of mine, he did nothing
but talk of oil in Australia. He's a real
nice feller, Rubel, but he sure talked a
lot of oil. I had that there boat of mine
all set up to take me fishin’ off the
Mexico coast for a couple of months,
but Cy kept talking about oil in Aus-
tralia. You know, I've seen the sea
around those parts red with schnapper,
and I thought I might catch me a few,
but Cy kept talkin’ about oil. So I told
him, why, I’ll go see for myself. I can-
celled the fishin’ trip and caught the
next jet out. When I got here I spoke to
some of your boys in the Commonwealth
Bureau of Mineral Resources, and they
said, why the best place for oil might be
the Eucla Basin in South Australia, so
that’s where I went.
“Sure enough, the place looked good
for oil, but it didn't look much good for
anything else. There wasn't even a tree
or a bush on it, but underneath there’s
a shallow water board and the water’s
under pressure. It has everything needed
for finding oil. This trip is my third to
this country of yours, and I reckon now
there's as good a chance of finding oil
here as there is anywhere else.
“ A nyway, I'm bettin’ on it, and so is
my partner in Texas, a fella named
Win, and we aim to start drilling early
next year. They’ll be shallow bore holes
down to about 2000 feet and, over a
period, I guess we will have 17 holes or
more drilled.
“This is goin’ to cost me and my
partner about £600,000, and that’s why
we aren’t going to let any Australians
take out shares in Outback.
“You know, when the public buys oil
search shares they think it's an invest-
ment. Wahl, it’s nothing of the kind.
It's pure wild-cattin’ and a straight
gamble, and you don’t ask people to
invest in a gamble. It's not right, and
we just don’t aim to do it. Wild-cattin’
of this kind should only be done by
fellers who know the risks and who can
afford to lose a lot of money. Now me
and my partner know the risks, and we
can afford to lose, but no one in this
country of yours will be losing money on
our account.
“Why, if we do find oil, then we will
let Australians have a fair percentage
of shares, for that's only right, and if
we make a profit from this oil which
isn't found yet, why, I guess, I’ll invest
it all in this country.”
And we think the big man might.

“ Airlines? As I said, I’ve travelled all over the world, and I’ve flown a lot of airlines. One airline

My Affair
with Lady Chatterley
“Now Take Notice ...”
By GORDON HAWKINS
(Senior Lecturer in Criminology, University of Sydney)
In my opinion “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover” is a bad novel and an ex-
tremely boring one. And it was en-
couraging to read recently that a similar
view is held by the eminent literary
critic F. R. Leavis, to whom contemporary
recognition of D. H. Lawrence’s genius
is largely due. It is perhaps of no great
significance that this also happens to
be the opinion of my eldest daughter
who read it a couple of years ago at the
age of sixteen. She survived the experi-
ence without apparent moral dissolution,
but she was bored. “The Trial of Lady
Chatterley” on the other hand is far
from boring. It is an account of Regina
v. Penguin Books Ltd, the proceedings
in the 1960 English prosecution of the
publishers for the publication of a paper-
backed edition of the unexpurgated
“Lady Chatterley’s Lover.” An edited
transcript of the trial with a commentary,
it belongs in the first class of this literary
genre by virtue of the fact that the
editorial work has been done with wit
and discretion; and the appearance for
the defence of such distinguished literary
persons as E. M. Forster and Rebecca
West help to make the book a fascinating
as well as an historic document.
Now “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” ap-
pears in the gazetted list of works which
are deemed to be prohibited imports in
terms of regulation 4A of the Customs
(Prohibited Imports) Regulations; and in
view of the fact that Australia has a
reputation for being one of the most
censor-ridden countries in the English-
speaking world that is not really very
surprising.
“The Trial of Lady Chatterley”, how-
ever, does not appear on the gazetted
list. I took the trouble to check this up
some months ago. As a matter of fact
I wrote to the Minister for Customs,
Senator Henty, last June requesting a list
of all the books which are now classified
as prohibited imports. I didn’t get that,
but I read what “The Sydney Morning
Herald” described as the “full list of
banned books” in their issue of August
2, 1963; and I checked with the list pub-
lished on the previous day in the Com-
monwealth Gazette. In short, to repeat,
it doesn’t appear on the list.
And that is what I said to the Customs
Officer at Mascot when he removed it
from my brief case on my return from
New Zealand last August. He was very
polite about it but firm. I was polite and
firm too. I registered a protest and de-
manded a receipt. He gave me one and
obligingly told me where to write if I
wanted to take my complaint further.
Another official even went so far as to
point out to me in the text what are
sometimes described as “good old Anglo-
Saxon words.” “That's the reason for it”,
he said. I doubt whether he had any
authority for that, but the explanation
was offered in a friendly spirit. In fact
they couldn’t have been nicer about it.
As I left I was heartened to hear the
officer who had confiscated the book
saying to his colleague, “Hey, don’t take
that away. I want to have a look at it.”
I must say I hope he did read it right
through.
A few days later I wrote, as instructed,
to the Collector of Customs for NSW at
Sydney, complaining that the book seized
was not on the gazetted list and couldn’t
by the wildest stretch of imagination be
described as either indecent, obscene or
pornographic. I added that if books of
this character were being treated as pro-
hibited imports it was grossly misleading
the public to omit them from the pub-
lished list, thus giving a totally false im-
pression of the nature of works to which
objection was taken and entailing un-
necessary expense and loss.
Two weeks later I received a formal
Notice of Seizure and was informed that
my letter of complaint had been for-
warded to the Comptroller-General of
Customs at Canberra. I replied to the
Notice with a letter to the effect that
under Section 205 of the Customs Act
I “claimed” the book. This was necessary
because unless one claims any goods
seized within a month of the date of
seizure they “shall be deemed to be con-
demned and may be sold by the Col-
lector.” I had toyed momentarily with
the idea of letting the month go by and
offering to buy the book. However, after
another fortnight had elapsed the Col-
lector brought our exchange of pleasan-
tries to an end with a document saying
“NOW TAKE NOTICE that ... you are
hereby required to enter an action against
me for the recovery of the said publica-
tion, AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE
that if you do not within four months
after the date of this Notice enter such
action the said publication shall be
deemed to be condemned without further
proceedings.”
HThis somewhat disconcerting note ef-
A fectively punctured all my pretensions
The prospect of spending several hun-
dred pounds to secure a book which had
only cost me 7s. 6d. was rendered even
less appealing by the distinct possibility
that any such action might fail and land
me not only with my own costs but also
the Commonwealth costs. In the mean-
time, however, the Comptroller-General
of Customs at Canberra, or rather his
"Do you keep 'The Christian Science Monitor'?"

First Assistant, after giving me six weeks
to cool my heels had got around to reply-
ing to my original letter of complaint. He
informed me that “The Trial of Lady
Chatterley” is prohibited under regula-
tion 4A but was not included in the
gazetted list “because it was not con-
sidered to be a work of literary or artistic
merit” and that the published list only
includes “works of some literary merit.”
He added that, although the book could
not be released to me, “an application
on behalf of the library of the University
of Sydney to import a copy of this work
would receive consideration.”
Two weeks after this I received a
letter dated October 29 from Senator
Henty containing his final word on my
request of June 20, stating that he was
“unable to comply with your request
for a list of all the publications deemed
to be prohibited imports in terms of the
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regula-
tions.” He added, however, that should
I wish “to obtain information concerning
any particular book not appearing on the
Gazetted List I suggest that you contact
the Collector of Customs at Sydney be-
fore making any arrangements for its
importation.” The only trouble with this,
no doubt well meant, advice is that as
the list of prohibited works not included
in the gazetted list is apparently a closely
guarded secret one has no means of tel-
ling which books it would be necessary
to obtain information about. The only
definite known criterion appears to be
that they should be works of no literary
merit whatever; and I’m not interested
in importing books in that category
anyway.
There for the moment the matter rests.
My attempt to obtain a complete list of
the prohibited books has come to nothing,
and in the circumstances it seems ex-
tremely unlil ely that court action, even
if I could afford it, would recover for
me my copy of "The Trial.” If, however,
I could persuade the University librarian
to make application to import another
copy of the book which I have already
imported this "would receive considera-
tion.” Now 1 know that, as was pointed
out in this journal some weeks ago,
attacking Customs has “become a favor-
ite sport with some intellectuals” and I
have no wish to be stigmatised as an in-
tellectual. But it does seem to me that,
as Lord Chesterfield remarked in another
context, the position is ridiculous; and
moreover that a number of questions
need to be asked and answered.
Thus, in the first place, if it is in-
tended eventually to allow me to read
the book surely this could be achieved
with a great saving of time and money
to all concerned by releasing the copy
seized? If, on the other hand, it is not
so intended, what purpose is served by
asking the University librarian to make
application to import it?
Secondly, how does it come about
that a book which is generally ack-
nowledged to be of considerable literary
merit is not included in the published list
on the ground that “it was not con-
sidered to be a work of literary or art-
istic merit”?
Thirdly, even admitting (which I do
not) that Australians are so immature that
they need to be protected from works
which New Zealanders, Englishmen and
Americans can purchase quite freely,
what grounds are there for refusing to tell
them what they are being protected
from?
Fourthly, on what grounds is the book
prohibited? The editor, C. H. Rolph, who
happens to be a good friend of mine, was,
before he became a full-time writer, a
Chief Inspector in the City of London
Police. He is about as likely to perpetrate
pornography as an archbishop. It is
true that “four-letter words” are quoted
in the evidence here and there, but they
have appeared in other works which
are not prohibited. And it seems unlikely
that the appearance in print, in such an
antiseptic context, of words which are
at least as freely used in Australia as
any other English-speaking country can
be “the reason for it.”
I have left to the last what seems to
me the most extraordinary feature of
the whole affair. It is possible to purchase
without difficulty in Sydney a recorded
reconstruction of the “Lady Chatterley
Trial” edited from the official transcripts
by the same C. H. Rolph. This is issued
by Nonesuch Records on two LP records
(PPLD2O6/1 and 2). It has an intro-
duction spoken by the late Lord Birkett,
PC, and is ably performed by a cast of
well-known English players. As for those
good old Anglo-Saxon four-letter words,
they are spoken clearly and, as the nar-
rator points out, “with emphatic delibera-
tion,” by Maurice Denham who plays
Counsel for the Prosecution, in his open-
ing speech. Is there really any point in
attempting to obstruct the reading of
something to which an unrestricted
audience can listen?

HOLD THESE PAPERS UP TO THE LIGHT
and this is what you’ll see the individual marks of the finest bond papers in Australia.
And all specially made at Burnie —in eight white sheets and surface-sized for the best in
letterheads and stationery.

Around Melbourne
THE GIRLS IN THE GOLDEN FRAMES
VS/henever the old-timers get to
talking about the glories of Old
Melbourne it never takes more than
25 seconds to get on to the subject of
free counter-lunches. Back at the turn
of the century Melbourne was literally
clinking with hotels, and the popula-
tion had to do a very decent beer-
drinking job to support them. So com-
petition was tremendous. The free
counter-lunch came into being, and
it blossomed and blossomed.
If the memories of the old-timers
are correct they would start about
11 a.m. with biscuits and cheese, cold
sausages, corned beef, salads, pickles,
black puddings and savory snacks.
At noon there would be gorgeous
aromas in the bar as the hot joints
came in. There would be pigs’ cheeks,
piping hot, trestle tables covered with
roasts of pork, lamb, beef, corned
beef with steaming carrots, spuds, the
lot.
Naturally before he partook of these
things a gentleman was expected to do
the right thing and buy himself a
threepenny beer. Indeed, some unco-
operative eaters bought themselves
only one beer and stocked up with
enough food for a day or two. In the
language of the day he was called
“a bar sparrer,” and he was not en-
couraged to come again.
Alas, rising costs and a war ruined
this beautiful era. The counter-lunch
has made many, many reappearances,
with a notable return in 1949, but its
boom right now is starting to savor
of the Edwardian era. What with ever-
rising city values, pubs are going
out of existence one by one. As in
1910, we can only keep them going
by doing the decent thing drinking
a devil of a lot of beer. Regrettably,
the publicans have ignored the rich
tradition that the counter-lunch should
be free, but they are certainly laying
on the food spatchcock, beef Strog-
anoff, grilled snapper, paprika goulash.
But now, shall we say, a third di-
mension has been added to the coun-
ter-lunch business. It began with the
cigarette girls. Now you see them in
half a dozen pubs. They come around
at the rush hours. Usually they wear a
tiny single-piece or two-piece costume
and black net stockings.
But that’s not all. The other morn-
ing I was reading my paper and I
noted an ad which showed a picture
of a pretty girl. It said: “Come to the
Hotel Britannia and bring 20-20
vision.” Well, a man’s got to eat, so
I grabbed my reading glasses and
hurried there at once. I bought my
hamburger steak and onions, 2s. 6d.,
wandered into the saloon bar, bought
a beer, then looked up. Bless my soul!
Up above the bar there was a plat-
form and a huge gold leaf frame.
Seated inside the frame, dressed in
not very much at all, was a very nice
brunette. I almost dropped my ham-
burger.
Then, for the first time, I realised
the bar was indeed most remarkably
crowded; everybody was beaming
more than usual, and all staring in the
same direction. The girl sat bolt up-
right; she didn’t smile and she had
that part-sad, part-bored look girls
have on such occasions. She was wear-
ing a cloak on her shoulders, pink
tulle on her head, pink tulle bunched
on her hips, a small silver bra and
something perhaps a trifle larger than
a G-string.
I>eing a modest gentleman, I care-
fully averted my gaze, then bolted
next door to see what was doing in
the public bar. If the saloon bar was
crowded, this was like a Bourke Street
tram. You couldn’t budge. Most of
the bar was oriented in the one di-
rection. Above the main entrance
there was an even larger frame around
a floodlit box, and there sat a blonde
in a black and white striped bikini.
Occasionally she turned her head
slightly, but she acknowledged no
waves or greetings from the crowd.
There was no inside entrance to the
box. Unless someone brought a ladder
she could get neither up nor down.
I finished my hamburger, met the
accountant of the Britannia Hotel,
Mr Jan Teska, and waited an oppor-
tunity to meet the girls. Mr Teska was
proud of the hotel’s policy. He said
it was the first to introduce the floor
show three years ago, and this week
they were putting on Susan Lamarr,
an English stripper.
They were the first to introduce
cigarette girls to the bar trade and
now, three weeks ago, they were the
first to provide ‘‘living pictures.” They
had been a big success. “Oh, yes,” he
said, “I admit they are a gimmick to
help boost the bar trade.
“When this is no longer new we
will try something else.” He said the
idea of cigarette girls had been bor-
rowed from overseas, but the living
pictures were entirely original, the in-
vention of Mr Milton Kruger, the
licensee. Mr Kruger was a man full
of ideas. The girls took up their
positions from 12 to 2.15 p.m. and
from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day.
Now, let it be admitted, your cor-
respondent is always completely over-
come by a pretty face. But both girls
were remarkably nice, well-spoken and
intelligent. Jenny, the brunette, said
she was a Tivoli girl, and she found
sitting on a stool up aloft in a bar
for 2t hours a day was unbelievably
hard work . . .
“I do it for one reason; the Bri-
tannia pays us very well to do it, and
I’m saving up to buy a small car.
But it’s a success. Of course, it is. I
think the bar trade has increased
three times since we have been up
there. I see the same faces coming
back again and again.
“They stare, but I don’t take any
notice. Lately I have tried putting ear
plugs in my ears, so I cut myself off
completely. And I think, you know,
about things at home, how much
money I'm making.”
Sally was rather more of an effer-
vescent type. She is not entirely aloof
in the bar. “Of course, if anyone calls
out I don’t take any notice, but if I
see anyone I know I give a smile
or a nod. But it’s an awfully long
time up there. Finally I try to mes-
merise myself so that I don’t think,
hear or see anything.”
Competition is also strong in bank-
ing and the oil industry. Maybe they
will come to our service stations.
Perhaps our private banks are al-
ready thinking of this idea for pep-
ping up trade. Pretty girls poised in
boxes above the teller’s window would
be an undoubted attraction.

OVERSEAS
The TSR-2 Fuss
Britain’s £1,000,000,000 albatross?
From ROBERT HELLER in London
r A RMS races between West and East
J\ are bad enough; an arms race
between West and West makes
nonsense. Yet this is the unhappy result
of going ahead with the TSR-2 aircraft,
the latest, possibly the most expensive,
project to emerge from Britain s erratic
search for a defence policy ,n the missile
age-
The impassioned sales talk with which
the Air Staff last week unveiled the
TSR-2 was oddly timed. The super-sales-
manship came after, not before, Aus-
tralia, the most promising customer, had
turned down the plane. The Australians
chose the TFX, the American project
whose specifications, in many respects,
are expected to be identical with those
of TSR-2.
The unveiling ceremony also placed
far more emphasis on the TSR-2’s as-
tonishing military and aerodynamic
talents than on its equally startling
expense-up to £SOO million on the
quasi-official figures. In fact, TSR-2 is
likely to cost a great deal more. Getting
50 planes into squadron service might
mean a bill of £I,OOO million or so. This
does not count the cost—'akn no mean
does not count tne cost—also no mean
figure of developing the guided nuclear
bomb which TSR-2 will deliver in its
strategic capacity.
The programme will cost two to four
times as much as all Government pro-
jects cancelled since the war, all the way
from the Bristol Brabazon to Skybolt.
This trail of doom cost the taxpayer a
total of £239,400,000. Blue Streak,
Britain’s very own ballistic missile, was
the prize item, eating up £B4 million
before cancellation in favor of Skybolt,
the American air-to-ground missile. But
TSR-2 was never intended originally to
latch on to the Blue Streak-Skybolt pro-
gression.
The nam e states the aircraft's original
purpose: Tactical Strike Reconnaissance.

complexities that sur-
™ undthe ,nde P endent nuclear deterrent.
The Governm ent has still to settle on a
clear-cut solution to the problem of re-
placing the obsolescent V-bombers.
Blue Streak, the first stab at solving
the difficulty, had obvious defects. It
duplicated American projects; Britain is
much too small a launching pad for
liquid-fuelled, fixed-base rockets, and
Blue Streak was much too expensive. The
missile would have cost £SOO-600 million
(or not fa, above the conservative esti-
mate for the TSR-2). Its replacement.
Skybolt, at least took advantage of
American development spending; it also
gratified the formidable air lobby by keep-
in § Bomber Command indefinitely in the
manned strategic bombing business.
° °
The V-bombers would have launched
-*■ Skybolt. Like their American counter-
parts, our airmen do not fancy being
reduced merely to watching buttons in
underground silos. But the collapse of
Skybolt, on economic, technical and mili-
tary grounds, eliminated even this dismal
prospect. Skybolt’s substitute, the Polaris
submarine, will be the Navy’s property;
and, if one is to have an independent
deterrent at all, Polaris offers every ad-
vantage to an island Power with limited
financial resources. It has minimum vul-
nerability, no fixed base and is a proven
system with established costs.
Against this, Polaris has three draw-
backs, of widely varying importance. It
is American, it abolishes the RAF’s
strategic role, and it will not be available
in time to prevent a nasty gap appearing
in Britain's deterrent capacity. Some time
after 1965, the V-bombers, even with an
improved stand-off bomb, will cease en-
tirely to be a convincing deterrent. And
at that point the Polaris may not be in
service.
This is where TSR-2 has been flown
in as a strategic nuclear bomber. It
suffers from serious defects—operation
from vulnerable fixed bases and inability
to cruise about safely in the air, in
Strategic Air Command style, while
awaiting the order to strike. But TSR-2,
if it comes up to specification, would
pierce existing Russian defences. Thus
it is a means (home-made at that) of
plugging the deterrent gap, while meeting
the air lobby's fervent objections to the
Polaris deal.
But this does not make TSR-2 Britain's
deterrent for the 19705; that is unequivo-
cally the Polaris role. And £I,OOO million
(or £SOO million, for that matter) is an
awesome price to pay for a two- or three-
year reinforcement of a deterrent policy
that, by 1965, may itself be ruled obsolete.
Making the most favorable assumptions
about technical progress and perform-
ance, the TSR-2 is hardly justifiable on
deterrent grounds alone.
If the plane is justified in its original
Tactical Strike Reconnaissance role, then
the strategic capacity is a valuable, pos-
sibly even an economic, bonus. But TSR-2
remains easily the most expensive of
three major RAF projects. The other two
are the AW6BI transport, which will


take off or land on a short airstrip and
cost some £2OO million for 100 planes,
and the Hawker P. 1154 supersonic
vertical take-off fighter.
Both these planes are made by the
Hawker-Siddeley group. But when the
production of Lightning fighters runs
down shortly, TSR-2 will be the only
major manned fighting aircraft in the
hangars of the mighty British Aircraft
Corporation. Completion of the pro-
gramme will, of course, provide many
thousands of jobs over several years. But
£I,OOO million cannot really be justified
as outdoor relief for the aircraft industry.
True, the TSR-2 will be a supersonic
package of electronic marvels, some of
which might find civilian uses.
This, however, would be a hideously
expensive and wasteful way of carrying
out civil aeronautical research. There is,
in fact, a link between the TSR-2 and
the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic
airliner—they share the Bristol-Siddeley
Olympus engine. But the Concorde should
stand (or fall) on its own, and so should
the TSR-2. It is obvious that a civil jet
produced solely for the British market
will lose a packet; large export sales are
essential. Translated into military terms,
this means that an aircraft produced
solely for RAF use will, in “bang-per-
buck” terms, be wildly uneconomic.
This is doubly true when the plane is
complex (and thus expensive to develop)
and when the number of aircraft needed
is relatively small. Only 50 TSR-2s are
currently on order; a squadron comple-
ment of 100 would still be dwarfed by
the 1700 orders projected for the rival
American TFX. Even a gross disparity
in development costs between TSR-2 and
TFX could not outweigh this difference
in sheer numbers. It would be astonishing
if the United States could not offer Aus-
tralia the TFX on cheaper terms than
we can manage for the TSR-2.
Criticism of the US for her tactics in
selling the TFX and other armaments
abroad is beside the point. The Americans
have a severe balance-of-payments sick-
ness to nurse. It would be quixotic of
them to hold back from selling military
aircraft abroad simply so that Britain
could recoup some of the alarming costs
of ambitious projects that happen to
duplicate American programmes.
The hope, optimistic on the grand
scale, was that the Americans would buy
the TSR-2, accepting the RAF’s case
that this is the finest, most versatile air-
craft available. (“The RAF is now the
envy of the air forces of the world,” wrote
one rhapsodic commentator last week.)
It would have made more sense to tackle
the project on a joint basis from the
start. If the Atlantic alliance means any-
thing, excited enthusiasm about “Made
In Britain” labels is peculiarly pointless.

Greece’s “Papadzis”
A veteran campaigner
By CHARLES SRIBER
¥X/hatever may be said about Greece’s
” new Prime Minister, George Papan-
dreou, he is no newcomer to the some-
times frenetic Hellenic political scene. I
met him during the Cyprus trouble when
he was the only prominent politician to
urge moderation and realism at a time
when anti-British feeling had reached
fever pitch. Mobs were roaming the
streets of Athens chanting “Death to
the British!” The Union Jack was publicly
burned about twice a week and barbed-
wire entanglements surrounded the British
Embassy.
One had to be courageous in thosevlays
to say a kind word for the British. Yet
Papandreou told me he had confidence in
British public opinion. “The fact that
both the Liberal and Labor parties have
come out for self-determination of the
Cypriot people is a
title of honor for the
people of Great Brit-
ain,” he said. “Our
dispute is only with
the Conservative
Government.”
When I arrived in
Greece in 1955, the
Liberal parties were
riding high. There
were two of them,
led by Sophocles
Venezilos and Pap-
andreou. They co-
operated sporadi-
cally but later split
up, and Liberal for-
tunes were eclipsed
in subsequent Kara-
manlis victories.
The emphasis at that time was on
Cyprus, where Eoka partisans were harry-
ing the British and hangings and burnings
were the, order of the day.
I sought an interview with Papandreou
to get his opinions for an article I was
preparing. His party rooms arranged an
appointment with him at Parliament
House and there, after presenting cre-
dentials, I was directed to the vast, ugly
room where the Leader of the Opposi-
tion received visitors. The House was
built during the reign of the first Otto as
a royal palace. It was so uncomfortable
that the royal family settled for a com-
paratively modest home nearby and
Parliament took over the old palace.
The room was vast and hot. A key
symbol frieze ran along the top of the
high walls. Furnishings were limited to
a few benches, millet seat chairs and a
table. In one corner a group of obviously
disgruntled constituents were also await-
ing their leader. They were rehearsing
what they should say to him and it was
obvious that their cause was a passion-
ate one virtually unanswerable. They
practised in turn what sounded like the
delivery of a stinging ultimatum. I saw
that Papandreou was in for a hot time.
When he got to me he would be in a
pretty foul mood.
After a long wait the doors at the end
of the room were thrown open and a
secretary dramatically announced, “Mr
George Papandreou”. He strode in, tall
and elegant in a cream silk suit, his white
shirt gleaming, a tuberose in his button-
hole, his grey mane streaming untidily
above the aquiline face. The delegation
was ready for him.
There were no smiles
responding to his
broad beam. They
had their hands
ready in expostula-
tion.
He swept down on
them like a schooner
close hauled heading
confidently for a
group of fishing
boats. His hands
reached out and fell
upon the shoulders
of the two ringlead-
ers. Then he began
talking. I couldn’t
hear what he was
saying and at that
time my Greek
wasn’t good enough
to get much of it anyway. But he talked
and talked. He gesticulated expressively.
Their case was balanced on an upturned
fingertip, rolled into a ball, kneaded into
a shapeless mass of no consequence and
tossed lightly into the hot air of the room.
They watched, glum-faced at first. He
pivoted on his heels and demanded the
attention of each one of them. They
shuffled uneasily and a few hunched
shoulders conceded that he had some
element of reason on his side.
There, in very little time, the situation
was solved. His outthrust hands, palms
up to demonstrate the obviousness of it
all, disposed of the issue. He called for
coffee, and a white-aproned waiter who
might have been waiting in the wings
strode in with a tray of minute cups.
When they left each one pumped his

“Side-tripping” to South Africa, on your way to (or
from) Europe/U.K., is a very logical thing to do. Firstly,
it enables you to investigate personally today’s excel-
lent export opportunities in South Africa and her
northern neighbours. Secondly, it offers wondrous
sight-seeing opportunities (such as Kruger National
Park) —a welcome break from the beaten tracks of
traditional routes. And finally, it costs as little as
£15.10.0* in extra air fares, including S.A.A.’s Boeing

hand in gratitude. He was, they obviously
agreed, a man who could solve the most
complex problem.
He came across to me smiling, shook
hands and called for more coffee. Papan-
dreou preferred to speak in French and
outlined the attitude of his party to the
Cyprus issue. It was not so different from
the prevailing attitudes in Greece at that
time. Cyprus comprised a predominantly
Greek population. Enosis was the answer
But he carefully stressed that the issue
was one between Greece and the British
Government, and not the people.
In his many years of political activity.
Papandreou has been termed many
things. Some Greeks refer to him as the
“Papadzis.” In the market area of Athens
some swivel-eyed characters set up trays
and indulge in the Greek version of the
three-card trick, known there as “Chase
the Pappas”. It's as difficult to pin down
Papandreou as it is to find the Pappas,
some say. He has also been called “The
Windmill.” This might be because of his
political origins on the island of Myteline
which has many windmills. But it also
refers to the revolving sails.
There might be something in these
allegations. Papandreou first came to
prominence in the Venizelos Government
when, as Minister for Education, he
built a number of schools and reorganised
the education system.
Under the Metaxas dictatorship he was
placed under house arrest. When the war
came, ? nd the dictator died, he remained
in Greece, refusing an offer by the Left-
wing EAM to lead their shadow govern-
ment of resistance groups.
In 1943 he managed to escape to
Egypt where he was elected leader of
the Government in exile. After the war
he returnea to Greek soil as Prime
Minister and leader of the now defunct
Democratic Socialist Party, which was
only mildly socialist in character.
It was against Papandreou that the
EAM revolted in the upsurge which led
to the civil war. Taking a consistent
stand against their demands, he later
claimed: “I saved Greece from the EAM
and the Communists.”
Most historians would probably place
credit for this at the door of the allied
military forces, but Papandreou did take
a consistently anti-Communist attitude
and his name headed the list of those to
be executed in the event of a Left-wing
victory.
He supported Field Marshal Papagos’
Rally of the Greek People Government
until the 1953 municipal elections in-
dicated a move away from the rightist
party. Papandreou urged King Paul to
dismiss Papagos and, when the King
refused, pledged himself to oppose the
Government and that of Karamanlis
which succeeded it.
As a Liberal leader he has had his ups
and downs. In the 1961 elections his party
was reduced to negligible proportions and
many thought his star had faded.
He is a keen writer, poet and a student
of international politics. He wrote a thesis
which was taken very seriously in Greece
(although probably not elsewhere) in
which he suggested that the progressive
forces arising in the Soviet Union would
one day merge with the liberal groupings
naissant in the United States. This, he
suggested, would make mincemeat of the
power politicians.
This role he assigned to the youth of
both nations, and saw the young people
of Europe joining in.
Whatever the soundness of these views
it is encouraging that a 75-year-old
Prime Minister can see the future as
belonging to youth.

MALAY LITERATURE
Sir,
I notice that the name of Alex Josey
is beginning to appear quite regularly in
your pages. This is a good sign, for
Mr Josey, as we all know, has long
established himself as one of the most
illuminating commentators on the South-
East Asian scene.
But, like most foreign correspondents,
he can be too illuminating sometimes,
and consequently very irritating. Dis-
tortions and false generalisations are
inevitable journalistic vices which we
have learnt to put up with. But Mr
Josey’s particular crime is too obnoxious
to pass without comment. lam referring
to a remark he made in his recent pro-
file-article on Mr Lee Kuan Yew
In his enthusiasm for the Singapore
Premier and the Chinese cultural heritage
he contemptuously dismissed the Malays
as having “no literature, no history
except piracy”. This is not the sort of
comment one expects a man of Mr
Josey’s intelligence and experience to
make.
The Malays, for Mr Josey’s informa-
tion, do have a literature. It is not com-
parable to Chinese literature, of course,
but it is not totally insignificant. And
our history surely it is more than a
mere case of “piracy”?

APOLOGY
Sir,
My article about Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
which you published on October 19, con-
tained remarks which gave offence to
Malays. I would be grateful if you would
please give publicity to my sincere

intended.
I hasten to apologise, sincerely, whole-
heartedly and unreservedly for these
remarks.

CHRISTIANS AND JEWS
Sir,
In my article on “Christians and
Jews” (26/10/63) I referred to recent
overseas studies which concluded that
catechisms still convey to young child-
ren a belief that the Jews, by killing
Christ, are cursed and damned.
Through the courtesy of Father Smith
SJ, of the Institute for Social Order, I
was shown a series of catechisms and
supplementary teacher manuals at pre-
sent utilised throughout the Australian
Catholic educational network. These
show clearly that within the context of
Catholic religious instruction in Austra-
lia every effort is made to avoid incul-
cating hatred or prejudice against any
other religious or ethnic group. It is
quite clear that in this regard the Aus-
tralian pattern does not conform to the
overseas studies referred to in my origi-
nal article.

THE REPUBLICANS
Sir,
Your correspondent Mr R. Mullins,
president of the Australian Republican
Party (26/10/63), has alleged inconsis-
tency in the application of the electoral
law in regard to two matters arising from
the Legislative Council by-election on
the Melbourne West Province, held on
10th August, 1963, in that (a) I “refused
to hand back” the deposit of £5O for-
feited by his party’s candidate; but (b)
action was not taken to enforce the
compulsory voting provisions of the law
against the 20,000 electors who failed to
vote at the by-election.
As to item (a) the Chief Secretary has
no discretionary power, and this already
has been clearly explained to Mr Mullins.
However, with regard to item (b), this
is a matter where the Minister may exer-
cise his discretion. It was obvious to me
that, for a variety of reasons, a large
proportion of the electors were unaware
of the by-election and, consequently, it
was decided that the time and expense
that would be involved in seeking ex-
planations from such a large number of
non-voters would not be justified.
Apart from the fact that many people
had obviously confused the Legislative
Council by-election with the annual
municipal council elections to be held
14 days later, other factors which con-
tributed to the low polling figures in-
cluded the absence of big issues to pub-
licise the by-election and the almost
negligible amount of canvassing.

FLUORIDE TABLETS
Sir,
Without shouting “To the walls,
men!” I would like to make a com-
ment on your article regarding fluoride
tablets (19/10/63). To state that the
pharmacists’ mark-up is 42,000 per
cent is, to put it mildly, rubbish. By
selling 100 fluoride tablets the chemist
makes, at 8/6 a 100, a gross profit of
33i per cent on his cost. (The “his” is
important.) From the gross profit an
average of 14 per cent is deducted for
overheads. This then leaves a net profit
of about 20 per cent, on which income
tax is paid.
Moreover, it should be pointed out
that the chemist doesn’t make his own
tablets. This is done by the manu-
facturer, and it is on his price to the
chemist that the retail cost is determined.

ABORTION
Sir,
The three letters so far published in
The Bulletin against the NSW Human-
ist Society’s recommendations on the law
relating to abortion (5/10/63) show the
writers’ failure to appreciate the coher-
ence of humanist arguments, which they
reject for reasons that are either irrele-
vant or peripheral. Thus Michael O'Daly
(26/10/63), with literal inaccuracy, says
that abortionists are “guilty of murder”.
Evidently he regards the legislature as
the arm of God for the better temporal
protection of “souls”, but he is not even
disputing in the same language as the
humanists.
Where a law imposing heavy punish-
ment does no demonstrable or probable
good, but makes criminals of thousands
of people who regard it as morally right
to contravene that law then it is time
it was abolished. When the laudable
purpose of preventing abortions by un-
qualified persons can only be achieved
by abolition of the present law the case
is strong indeed.

DEVELOPING THE NORTH
Sir,
The question of populating and devel-
oping the vast empty north of Australia
has been a constant topic for Press and
debate. Where does the answer lie
with the building of a few scattered
“giant” projects? Or with an invasion
by Indonesia or China that will most
likely solve the problem for all time?
There is one country in this world
Israel that has tackled a similar prob-
lem. With patriotism, hard work, and
in constant danger, they have created
from the ruined land of Palestine a
flourishing, up-and-coming State. “Kib-
butzeem” were the answer to their prob-
lem communal farms and settlements,
worked by immigrants, border farms
worked by young men and women of the
Army as part of their two years’ service.
Could we apply this system, with vari-
ations, to solve our problem of the North?
I think we could, but would old and new
Australians alike rise to the need? Is
our pioneering spirit dead with our so-
called “security” and high living stand-
ards?

“A NATION IN DOUBT"
Sir,
With due respect to such a noted his-
torian as Mr Alan Taylor (“A Nation in
Doubt”, 5/10/63), some things must be
said about his article. One cannot quar-
rel with his facts; they are well establish-
ed. He says we are morally no worse
than the last century, and that the real
wickedness is “the way in which govern-
ments are preparing the destruction of all
mankind with nuclear weapons”.
But because of the very existence of
nuclear weapons, any comparison with
the standards of the last century is en-
tirely inadequate. Because man has these
weapons at his disposal, and a few can,
if they decide, wipe out half humanity
at a stroke, this age demands more moral
passion, a clearer view of right and
wrong, and higher character than any
other.
The real wickedness, I venture to sug-
gest, and the other thing that differenti-
ates this age from the last, is that now
we have intellectuals, ecclesiastics, poli-
ticians and civil servants using all the
means of twentieth-century mass media
to bombard us with the idea that moral-
ity is irrelevant, even dangerous. Earlier
on men broke the rules, but they knew
when they broke them, and they did not
try to change the rules to suit them-
selves.

ELECTRONIC SPEED COP
Sir,
Your report from Adelaide on “The
Electronic Speed Cop” (26/10/63) con-
tains a striking example of the shift in
meaning which can result from the care-
less choice of one word.
In his evidence the expert witness
called by the Police Prosecutor stated that
when two objects pass through the beam
of the radar simultaneously the speed
recorded by the instrument is that of
the object reflecting the larger signal
back into the radar aerial, i.e., it is
generally the speed of the larger or
nearer object, not the faster of the two,
which is recorded.
In his judgment Mr Redman, sum-
marising this evidence, said that if two
objects pass through the beam at the
same time, the “higher” (meaning the
larger) of the two signals is recorded.
Reporting the case the following morn-
ing the Adelaide “Advertiser” changed
“higher” to “faster”, thus introducing a
vital shift in meaning which has been
repeated by your reporter.

Wielding the Scissors
Japan’s film censorship: a lesson to Mr Campbell?
By BILL BEECHAM
Australian film censorship has
matured considerably in recent
years —to a point where it is,
occasionally, even lauded by the local
motion picture industry. “We in film
censorship have tried to move with the
times and be as consistently fair as
possible both to exhibitors and the
public,” explains Chief Commonwealth
Film Censor Colin Campbell. “We do
not deny adult Australians the right to
see films which examine the problems of
everyday life, provided they are not
presented indecently and that they do
not encourage imitation of some of the
practices they portray.”
New horror films are out of course.
So, too, are “nudies” or anything “likely
to be offensive to the people of a friendly
nation” or any film which the Censorship
Board holds is “undesirable in the public
interest.”
Fair enough, you might say. But our
censorship outlook takes on a much
more restricted view when one compares
it with the realistic and certainly more
adult approach adopted by Japan.
There, the film industry’s own censor-
ship authority, Eiga Rinri Kitei (which
very roughly translates as Motion Picture
Code of Ethics, or Eirin) is responsible
for all film censorship and is generally
regarded as one of the most exemplary
administrations in the world. Its
decisions are usually hailed by both
public and industry alike, and while
Japanese law provides for an Appeals
Board (similar to that of Australia) such
has never been necessary.
The views of minority groups are
considered, of course, but there is less
regard for them than is the case here.
Japan’s censors, in fact, govern their
entire approach to the subject by the
intention to allow all but the obscene
or very harmful. One could not imagine,
for example, a Japanese censor ordering
the deletion of a word which is in every-
day usage, though this has often
happened here.
This same liberal treatment, is
accorded posters and daybills, with the
result that what is taboo here is
commonplace outside the typical Japan-
ese theatre. And though this causes
something of a shock at first, one soon
comes to accept it and there is little if
any evidence of delinquency, either
juvenile or otherwise, as a result.
This censorship approach is reflected
in current Japanese film production. And
the maturity of Nipponese motion
pictures is all the more remarkable
when one remembers that as late as the
1940 s one set a monumental precedent
by showing a boy and girl “kissing”
through the glass of a closed window.
VTow, as might be expected in a
1 nation where billboards shriek the
certainty of cures for venereal disease
and the English language daily news-
papers carry advertisements proclaiming
the wares of such establishments as “the
only sex drug store in Yokohama”, they
run the gamut from wholesome family
and teenage fare through Samurai
costume spectaculars to such worldly
offerings as Shochiku’s “The Body”, a
bitter-sweet story of a young girl seduced
by her employer and set off on a pave-
ment-pounding circle of lust.
“Bushido A Story of Cruelty”
(Bushido Zankoku Monogatari) is an-
other recent example of Japanese movie-
making which reflects both mature
handling ol its subject and the Japanese
audience’s love for action. Filmed by
Toei and ballyhooed as “the cruellest,
story in Japan film history”, it tells of
the leaders of one family through seven
generations. One commits hara-kiri to
save his master from disgrace and so
gains a few additional pounds of rice
for those he leaves behind; a second also
disembowels himself. This one so that
he can be with his dead Shogun. From
here on the story really becomes adult
as the subsequent hero attracts the
attention of his boy-loving master, sleep-
ing with both the boss and the latter’s
mistress, then making the mistake of
falling in love with the girl. His reward:
on-screen emasculation that would have
the local censors running for their
scissors.
The Cannes Award-winner “Harakiri”
(Seppuku) is another Japanese film
which would, presumably, never get past
our censors. It’s gory. Yes, “Films and
Filming” editor Peter Baker saw it at
Cannes and later said. “I confess that
after a good dinner the sight of the
hapless youth trying time and time again
to take his life ceremoniously with only
a sharpened piece of bamboo cane all
but made me vomit”), but it’s still the
finest Japanese film of the year and one
of the best made anywhere.
Of course, the fact that the Japanese
industry is making these films and movie-
goers are accepting them does not mean
that public opinion is not playing a
growing role in the everyday activities
of Eirin. In fact, recent developments
indicate the board may sometimes in
future scissor some sequences featuring
nudes or “excessive sex”, rather than
continue the present method of labelling
the pictures in which they appear “For
Adults Only”.
Then too, in Japan, as in Australia,
there’s growing agitation in some areas
for the application of local censorship
standards by municipal governments.
Currently, some 22 Japanese prefectures
have a second look at all pictures to
comply with demands by pressure
groups. In most cases, this re-censoring
is followed by a ban on young patrons,
but does not prevent adults from seeing
the films. In Australia, such pictures
would either be banned outright—plenty
have been in the past, including some
pretty innocuous ones —or so badly cut
they would make little sense to any
audience, adult or otherwise.
Not that there is any likelihood of
a flood of Japanese pictures on the Aus-
tralian market, despite the fact that
Nippon still produces more features
than any other single country (and I’m
not forgetting the prolific producers of
India, who continue to announce more
pictures than they ever make, and some-
times take as long as 10 years to get a
single film in the can). For although
such Japanese classics as “Rashomon”
and “Gate of Hell” were successful com-
mercial releases in local art houses, it
takes a courageous distributor to con-
template the release of any except the
most artistic of Nipponese productions.
One New Zealand showman recently
announced plans to distribute a flock of
Japanese attractions here, including
Daiei’s “Buddha” and “The Great Wall”,
neither of which busted any blocks in
Japan, but there’s a vast difference
between announcing pictures for release
and actually securing playing time.
The fact is, there is little commercial

potential for most Japanese pictures out-
side Nippon. There are a number of
reasons for this, apart from the obvious
one of language. In Japan, often re-
ferred to as the land of the status quo,
five major companies (Daiei, Toho,
Toei, Shochiku and Nikkatsu) own or
control all the studios and most of the
theatres. In keeping with traditional
practice, they regard company image as
every bit important as quality. Thus,
through the years, each major has con-
centrated much of its attention on what
was regarded as its own single segment
of the mammoth Japanese audience.
Toei, for example, made pictures with
appeal for patrons who, literally, saw
only Toei products. Nikkatsu’s patrons,
by tradition, were seen as boys and girls
who almost always flocked to see the
boys and girls of Nikkatsu productions.
Daiei, alone of the majors, changed
its profile as the mood suited. Headed
by Masaichi Nagata, Daiei’s productions
range from the aforementioned block-
busters to the delightful Asian Festival
award winner “Being Two Isn’t Easy”,
a look at the world through the eyes of
a Tokyo tot.
Nagata was, grudgingly, responsible
for “Rashomon”, walked out on its first
screening and later relegated showing
of his world-acclaimed co-production
“Hiroshima Mon Amour” to the lower
half of Japanese suburban double-bills
because of his fear of its “political
implications”.
It is pictures like “Rashomon” and
“Harakiri” that cause people outside
Nippon to acclaim all Japanese produc-
tions as masterpieces. Few of them are,
and with good reason. Japanese pro-
ducers know they cannot only cover
their production costs but also make a
healthy profit from the home market;
therefore they need not conform to any
recognised outside standards of excel-
lence. Thus they feel free to underwrite
production schedules which would be
the envy of any production company in
the heyday of Hollywood.
And this is where one notices the
greatest difference between Australia
and Japan. Both began producing
movies at about the same time. Indeed
J. H. Perry and his brothers were grind-
ing away with primitive cameras for
the Salvation Army before Tsuekichi
Shibata, head of Mitsukoshi department
store’s photographic department, started
on Japan’s first films scenes of the
Ginza and Geisha areas of Shimbashi,
Yanagibashi, Yoshicho and Gion.
Today, however, Japan’s movie in-
dustry is a mighty one, while feature-
film making here is almost non-existent.
In Japan, despite television, declining
audiences and increasing competition
from imported films, production con-
tinues at an amazing rate (375 features
completed in calendar 1962), while our
own, once productive industry has
ground slowly to a halt. It might be
too early to say feature-film production
is dead in Australia, but certainly the
coffin has been ordered.
THEATRE
Golden Cuckoo
Ages of Man. Sir John Gielgud. His
Majesty’s Theatre. Perth.
Oir John Gielgud is about the last of
the English theatrical knights to
make it to Australia. No doubt, he will
survive the ordeal of the bush barbe-
cued chop, pick up the canvases, or at
least, the names of a few Australian
artists and beat it back to London hardly
the worse for wear.
He is too old for Romeo and Juliet
and, let’s be charitable, too young for
Lear or Prospero. He wears a black din-
ner suit which would win him no ovation
from Savile Row. In this he occasionally
merges with the dusty black backdrop.
He is bald-headed in a curiously naked
and vulnerable way, big-nosed in a
parrot-like rather than an imposing
fashion. He smiles to disclose bad teeth.
His good hands are marred by a dis-
tracting signet ring.
The scene isn’t even set properly.
There is in one corner a self-conscious
sort of reading stand with what looks
like a copy of an afternoon paper on it.
He goes and refers to this once or
twice, although this bit of business will
convince no one that he is not entirely
word-perfect.
And Shakespeare did not write with
the monologist in view. Most of the
speeches are short, the longest being
Richard the Second confronting Boling-
broke. Most of time Gielgud springs in
and out of character like a cuckoo in a
clock.
Yet the whole performance is a mir-
acle, most moving and most satisfying.
The voice, which apparently breaks off
in laughter at the sound of an Australian
accent, is entirely free of the unpleasing
characteristics of so many English
voices. It is perfection.

may not be all the go way
up in Ironbark, but he has certainly
and quickly become a darling of the
international theatre. The reasons, in-
terestingly enough, are mostly old-
fashioned ones: he produces a wrought-
iron plot, he picks it out in melodramatic
colors, he gives plenty of acting op-
portunities, and, above all, he provides
the final dignified rub of morality.
In “The Physicists” there is much of
that glossy polemic which is the mark
of Shaw's didacticism, shiny and appeal-
ing despite the fact that it is shot full
of logical holes; there is some of the
Wellsian pleading for the special role
and responsibility of the scientist; and
there are bizarre murders and personal
tangles of cruelty that would do well in
Strindberg or Wedekind.
The sanitarium in which three insane
physicists of this play live (one dresses
and talks as if he is Newton, another as
Einstein, another as if he is a genius
far greater than either) is no ordinary
sanitarium. Each of the physicists in turn
kills the nurse he loves, and at the end
they decide to kill the knowledge they
love.
The genius, Mobius, gets into some
very high-flown and beautifully developed
arguments about the human status of the
physicist, and these have enough moral

guts in them to carry any four run-of-
the-mill plays of the day. Even so, one
is not left in a position of certainty by
the playwright. He seems to proffer three
or four points of view: that knowledge
sometimes runs ahead of man's ability
to use it well—and therefore should be
kept secret; that some knowledge is
better destroyed altogether; that an idea
one thought cannot be un-thought;
that Solomon (who plays ghostly calls
on Mobius) was brought low by his own
wisdom.
Each one of these is a simple and telling
thing to think about and Durrenmatt
puts their cases well. You may think,
though, that he has not successfully
thought through the internal contradic-
tions of his intellectual burden. Dramati-
cally, he does very well, and thanks to
a superb performance by Don Reid as
Mobius, the audience is taken right into
the Arctic loneliness and rigor of the
physicist whose mind is struggling with
knowledge and its fearful possibilities.
Hayes Gordon’s direction, though
somewhat uneasy in the first act, managed
the power of the second half with flaw-
less control and perspective. Zika Nester,
in the important role of the doctor/pro-
prietor of the sanitarium, came through
in the second act with a flash of integ-
rity and acting quality that one would
not have anticipated from her work in
the first half.
Several other players in the cast,
honorably excepting James Scullin as
Isaac Newton and John Denison as In-
spector Voss, were well below the
Ensemble’s usual standard of playing.
At the Palace Theatre, the remarkably
happy experiment of lunch-time theatre
goes on well with the new play, John
Mortimer's brief comedy of a lunch-hour
seduction that misfires. Ron Haddrick as
a middle-aged textile buyer, who is also
a wordy would-be lover, is excellent.
KEVON KEMP
TELEVISION
In Camera
Consider Your Verdict. Channel 7.
Sydney.
Otaring glumly at an episode of “The
Defenders” recently, I wondered
what had happened to Australian tele-
vision drama. An expected answer would
be that the horrible critics had killed it,
with their wicked slings and poisonous
arrows. But some further thought sug-
gests that it has not been born yet.
The Americans have solved their TV
drama problems by standardising the pro-
duct and mass-producing it, canned, in
three grades. And sometimes, like “The
Defenders,” it runs the gamut from A to
C in a short time, I suppose, thanks to
the whims of a sponsor. The Lawrence
Preston formulated by Reginald Rose
was a man, but nowadays he’s a legal
beagle. I’m waiting to see whether the
same fate hits the newest and best of
TV’s brief-toting lawmen, Sam Benedict,
who looks and acts as though propelled
by diesel-powered ulcers.
Contrary as ever, the British tried Z-
grade drama first and have worked back
to the Ds and Cs, with occasional Bs
in which they make actors resemble
people as closely as possible. That is fine,
but it is still a formula, and may lead the
medium’s drama into a cul-de-sac.
Australian television drama has the
great advantage of having tried to pro-
duce a little of everything, American
and British, and failed in most directions.
It has no hide to bound it, and its fluid
possibilities may have been helped by
Rod Serling’s visit to lecture on television
writing. The cautionary “may” is
necessary because we could have an
early crop of duds if his ideas happen
to grow strangely in this soil, coming
as they do from a richer one.
My guess is that our television drama’s
beginnings are less in the recent com-
paratively lavish production of “The
Right Thing” than in the bare boards
of “Consider Your Verdict”, an unexcit-
ing but workmanlike affair which started
life many moons ago as a series of
simulated court cases, and has progress-
ed to the point where it includes scenes
of the crime, clashes out of court as
well as in, and other attempts to round
out the principals.
Rarely mentioned critically, “Consider
Your Verdict” ambles on forever. It has
a great virtue in its homely message that
very ordinary people can be dramatically
interesting on television, and another in
that it satisfies one’s craving for the pre-
sence of real Australian characters.
If this could be the point of departure,
we might find that the multi-camera tech-
niques being used mostly in variety
shows can be put to better uses. What
is called drama does not have to be
“dramatic” on television. It can be
simple. It can begin with a story out-
line, a set, a few people, and be better
television than “Man and Superman”,
“Medea” and “Hedda Gabler” put to-
gether. Human hopes, fears, passions
and confusions can be experienced in a
shabby room where someone lies listen-
ing, thinking, waiting. It can be a girl
choosing a party dress and dreaming
backward and forward in time. It can
be someone coming home after a stun-
ning loss or a magnificent gain.
A good producer with a camera crew
and a handful of actors could make such
things as lively as “An Age of Kings”.
Television drama would be something
to experience, not just to watch. Even
Senator Gorton might find it preferable
to Matt Dillon.

Victim of the Purge
The masterpiece of a hunted man

great books are inevitably recal-
A led by these wonderful memoirs:
Zola’s “Germinal,” Reed’s “Ten Days
that Shook the World” and Malraux’s
“Man’s Estate.” It combines their power
and takes its place with them. What a
pity that five years elapsed before Peter
Sedgwick’s masterly annotated transla-
tion from the French appeared! It would
have been even more useful in 1957.
Books on the Russian Revolution and
its aftermath run into thousands; a glance
at the reviews shows that, even now, no
other event is given so much space. I
know of no account that surpasses this
one in truthfulness and passion. It is so
crammed with detail that Serge has had
to invent a new style, terse to the point
of being telegrammatic but vivid and
moving. He was a poet, a novelist and a
journalist in Russian and in French. His
qualities have come together to make a
masterpiece, and because his roots are in
two worlds, his testimony, tragic but
hopeful, gains greater force. He not only
knew the men but was steeled in their
fire.
Son of a political refugee and searingly
poor, Serge grew up in Belgium. His
recreation of a childhood before the first
World War is splendid, as are the por-
traits of Walloon workers and artisans
that shaped his outlook towards liber-
tarian socialism. As a youth he went to
Paris to be a non-terrorist militant in the
Anarchist movement, from which many
Communists developed. He became a
Marxist, on the whole orthodox but never
doctrinaire, and to the bitter end re-
mained faithful to his humanist vision.
He had his first of a long series of prison
experiences and then took part in the
Barcelona uprising of 1918. He reached
Petrograd only a few weeks after Trotsky.
With regret one refrains from quoting
from his descriptions of the city at this
time; they are among the best that exist.
He turned soldier and organiser, did in-
telligence work and was on intimate
terms with most of the leaders. He came
to admire Gorky, watched Yessenin’s rise
and fall and was put in charge of prepara-
tions for the first congress of the Comin-
tern. He formed friendships with Western
Leftists like Nin, Vaillant Couturier,
Souvarine and Henrietta Roland-Holst
and, later, Barbusse, Gide and Rolland.
He worked with Bukharin and Radek,
and, to a lesser degree, with Lenin him-
self. He was attached to the Cheka in
1920, the year the death penalty was
abolished ... In Leningrad he lived
through the Kronstadt Rebellion, worried
and cautiously at odds with Trotsky. The
treatment of Makhno’s peasant army dis-
turbed him as an opportunity lost for the
party. Some time after he began to
wonder whether war, counter-revolution
and famine would not prove too much for
Soviet democracy, but fought against de-
featism.
/Gradually a new theme enters: the
land question and the state apparatus.
Already it began to look as if the pro-
letarian dictatorship was to be built on
the backs of the peasantry, one of the
two fundamental issues (“Revolution in
One Country” being the other) to which
most problems and splits, down to the
present one with China, would be trace-
able. While the peasants were hostile
there could be no “base of abundance,”
and every division of opinion could be-
come a dangerous focus. This streng-
thened the bureaucracy and intensified
the internal class struggle, but not accord-
ing to Stalin’s dictum.
Serge was sent to Berlin to help launch
a revolution which never took place
(October, 1923); thence to Austria. Back
in Moscow, he found the stage set for
battle. After Lenin’s death, with the
party swamped by careerists and in the
wake of the New Economic Policy
critically supported by Serge the cli-
mate deteriorated quickly. The author
follows the fortunes of the factions, but
even more interesting are the human
sidelights: Joffe’s suicide and macabre
funeral; Zinoviev clearing out his Kremlin
room with Lenin’s death mask on his
couch; the silencing of great minds like
Boris Pilnyak’s, against which no protest
is raised anywhere; Kamenev howled
down at the XVth Congress; Trotsky
being carried bodily to the car for the
train into banishment. Some grow braver,
many grow afraid. The full tragedy did
not unfold until after 1928: there was a
twilight.
Victor Serge went unfalteringly
through the first waves of terror, now
covered by history’s craziest misnomer,
the Cult of the Individual. A cat-and-
mouse game: isolation, interrogation, un-
employment. He still differentiates be-
tween adherents of the general line from
conviction and men without honor, ideo-
logical bullies. By degrees the latter
emerge victors. Scores, then hundreds,
finally thousands are crushed, to no pur-
pose. Some one tells Panait Istrati: “To
make an omelette, eggs are broken.”
He replies: “I see the shells. Where is
the omelette?” Serge’s questioning before
imprisonment gives an enormously in-
structive picture of the methods that
explain the Purge Trials. His wife is
driven out of her mind. With his young
son he is sent to Orenburg and a Gogol-
ian exile, and a campaign is mounted for
him in France. In 1936 he is allowed to
go proof, if needed, that protests have
value.
The years to his death would demand
a separate review. Ever hunted, defamed
by his former comrades, he struggled
and wrote on. “For this age must be
witnessed.” Escape from Vichy France;
Mexico . . . This is the reverse of a
Koestler-type polemic: nothing neurotic,
no self-induced guilt but humility and a
level gaze.
Days before he died he sent six lines
to Malraux, seemingly backing his stand
for De Gaulle. They are the sole smudge
on his page, if that. Men who dip their
arms in filth are free to condemn him
for it.

I have considerable sympathy for Mrs

solids melting when I read Muriel Spark.
I can think of few novelists who so
consistently demand from their readers a
willing suspension of disbelief. Indeed
suspension seems to me a word peculiarly
appropriate to Miss Spark’s work. She
forces her reader to suspend all the
ordinary tests that can be applied to fic-
tion. If you ask her for a story, you will
be fobbed off with a few “incidents,” a
few tentative movements which hardly
begin, and which certainly do not end in
any final and definite sense. If you ask
for characters, you get a few brush

marks, cartoon figures seen from the
side; or you get a burst of inconsequen-
tial conversation, interrupted by wild
poses and gestures, as in this scene from
“The Ballad of Peckham Rye”:
“Totally,” Dougal said, “lacking in
vision. It is his fatal flaw. Otherwise
quite sane.” He bore on his uneven
shoulders all the learning and experi-
ence of the world as he said it. Mr
Druce looked away, looked again at
Dougal, and looked away.
“Vision,” said Mr Druce.
“Vision,” Dougal said, and he was
a confessor in his box, leaning forward
with his insidious advice through the
grille, “is the first requisite of sanity.”
“Sanity,” Mr Druce said.
Dougal closed his eyes and slowly
smiled with his wide mouth. Dougal
nodded his head twice and slowly, as
one who understands all. Mr Druce
was moved to confess, “Sometimes I
wonder if I’m sane myself, what with
one thing and another.”
And so on. There is no reason why it
should ever end.
Then if you ask for theme, you get
“Realism is very flimsy,” and feel, mo-
mentarily, that you are on the trail. Or
you get an exercise in Diabolonian ethics
in “The Ballad of Peckham Rye,” with
Dougal as the devil, Nelly the lunatic
seer, and a touch of “Brighton Rock”
violence in the form of a youthful gang
of blackmailers. Or you get the “voices”
of Caroline Rose in “The Comforters”;
and now martyrdom in Haiti and “The
Wreck of the Deutschland” in “The Girls
of Slender Means.” None of these is
more than a hint, an elusive wisp of
theme, an intimidation so slight that it
does no more than stir softly in the mind,
leaving behind a faint sense of uneasi-
ness, of dislocation.
But there is suspension in another
sense too. Not only does Mrs Spark
disallow the questions we normally put
to fiction, but she refuses to satisfy even
those tastes she herself creates. Suppose
that you accept Leonora’s unusual talent
for shifting walls and ceilings; Dougal’s
shattering diabolism; and now Nicholas
Farringdon, missionary, martyr, former
poet, author of “The Sabbath Note-
books.” You allow Mrs Spark’s appar-
ently disorganised whimsy to take hold
upon you; you submit to the inconse-
quential chatter of her cartoon figures;
you inspect (though not too closely) her
thematic clues. In a word, you agree that
realism is flimsy, and you embrace sur-
realism or anti-realism or whatever you
like to call it instead, only to find that
Mrs Spark, like one of her own will-o’-
the-wisp creations, has led you into the
middle of a mirage, pulled your nose
and gone off, leaving you to find your
own way home.
In short, and to come to the point,
Mrs Spark is a reviewer’s nightmare. She
refuses to be labelled; in a very real
sense she refuses to be judged, since a
sense of humor is so personal a matter
that no critic in his right mind would
dare say that a certain joke is or is not
funny. And infuriatingly, Mrs Spark, like
Dougal Douglas, makes one want to
confess. I confess that I like whimsy,
but that I find her only patchily funny.
Occasionally I find her very funny in-
deed, to the point where I want every-
body who happens to be about to share
the joke. But (and this confession is
sotto voce ) I don’t think that she is
really a comic writer at all. Only the
surface of her novels is funny; and the
surface is made of very thin ice, full of
cracks, even dark holes. Beneath it are
curious shadows, strange shapes which
threaten, and mock. And sometimes a
subterranean explosion rocks her world.
In “The Ballad of Peckham Rye” Mr
Druce, after years of Saturday night
service from his mistress (described with
macabre humor), stabs her nine times
in the neck with a corkscrew.
“The Girls of Slender Means” pays
even more spectacular tribute to violence.
It ends, literally, with a bang. The scene
is the May of Teck Club, a hostel
for young gentlewomen of modest means.
In creating its inmates, Mrs Spark has
mated (alarmingly) the girls of St Trini-
an’s and the inhabitants of Nancy Mit-
ford’s Hons, cupboard. The atmosphere
is boarding-school-cum-women’s college.
The title has more than financial signifi-
cance. Some of the girls (those with
36} inch hips or less) are able to stand
on a lavatory seat and wriggle through
a slit window onto a flat roof, where,
when opportunity and Nicholas coincide,
one of the more enterprising spends many
loving nights. (The others content them-
selves with sunbathing.)
T>ut why go on. One cannot talk as
though there is a story. There are
conversations. There is some satire on
publishers and literary agents. A young
woman called Joanna, direct descendant
of Nelly the lunatic seer, teaches elocu-
tion, and punctuates the novel with sig-
nificant quotations. And there is violence.
The May of Teck Club is reduced to
rubble by an undetected war-time bomb.
As the flames lick round the ruins and
the girls of 36} and less escape through
the slit window, Joanna goes down with
the building, intoning the litany for Day
27, “Except the Lord build the house
their labor is but lost that build it . . .
Out of the deep have I called.”
Mrs Spark’s formula from farce to
the psalms, from diabolism to prophecy
is a teasing one, but in “The Girls of
Slender Means” it seems to me to be
wearing a bit thin. Yet this book makes
very plain what I believe to be her real
preoccupation disruption and disinte-
gration. As in earlier books she describes
the reduction of apparent order to real
chaos through the agency of a destruc-
tive personality. When the May of Teck
Club blows up, it takes with it the easy
platitudes of a philosophy of success:
‘‘Poise is perfect balance, an equani-
mity of body and mind, complete com-
posure whatever the social scene.” But
we are reminded, too, that a tape contain-
ing Joanna’s recording of “The Wreck of
the Deutschland” is wiped in the interests
of war-time economy. “After such know-
ledge, what forgiveness?” To say even so
much is to tempt providence. Nothing
would please Mrs Spark more, I suspect,
than to have us all peering between the
lines in search of Meaning. One should
be content to say that in “The Girls of
Slender Means” she is less funny than
usual, less sinister than usual, and as tan-
talisingly elusive as ever.
LEONIE KRAMER
Mystic
Memories, Dreams, Reflections. C. G.
Jung. Collins. 555. 9d.
is a wonderful, discursive, mystical
work; and one might as well try
to review the Book of Revelations. Artists
and the religious should enjoy it as much
as scientists will be exasperated by its
verbal woolliness.
Not far under the surface of Jung’s
mind he began to find forms without con-
tent, irrational symbols. As he dredged
them up they obviously carried with them
that curious conviction of being “right”
that sends the minds of artists and
pyramidologists careering like space
vehicles. Deeper and deeper he dug, each
layer of his mind giving up artefacts,
echidnas, coelocanths, and fossils, each
offering comments on the previous layers
above, until he reached the Devonian,
rock-bottom. His collection was enor-
mous. Numbers, shapes, figures, qualities,
colors, gods, the lot. Some of these
images he also found in the minds of
his patients. Then he sought to confirm
their universality by examining the total
recorded cultural and religious dream
of mankind.
He found that many of the primal
images of his own unconscious mind had
already been known to the Gnostics,
but the paucity and remoteness of their
accounts, which anyway stemmed mostly
from their opponents, the Church
Fathers, left him with a great gap to
fill between past and present. For many
years he failed to complete the parallel
between the psychological equivalents of
the ontogeny and phylogeny of a bio-


logical species. Then he discovered al-
chemy, and so far as the European
psyche was concerned, its symbols filled
in all the missing links.
Both Carl Gustav Jung and Philip
Aureole Theophrast Bombast von Hohen-
heim spent important parts of their lives
around Basle, 400 years apart. Jung was
very sensitive to atmosphere, and if he
felt a nuance in his surroundings he used
all sorts of tricks to intensify it and bring
it into consciousness, like deliberately re-
peating, for weeks on end, some remem-
bered piece of childhood play. Perhaps
yon Hohenheim, who called himself
Paracelsus, became recreated in the later
Jung, who relied on him greatly for the
mystical interpretation of alchemy. Para-
celsus occupies one of those somewhat
nutty places in medical history between
medieval and modern times, like Sir
Thomas Browne. He wanted to be every-
body’s friendly chemist and physician,
but in the end attracted only a few fol-
lowers who felt they really understood.
He called himself, magnificently, “Doctor
of Both Medicines,” and did not deign
to specify either; but it was a charming
title. In the same way Jung will not be
grasped.
take a small example, his best known
A symbol, the mandala, is for him
an archetype of spiritual unity, and is
“ultimate self,” after which I take it
there are no more words. Yet any medi-
cal student might guess that a mandala
looks so like a migraine aura that its
universality is probably related to the
anatomy of the human brain, and not
very importantly. Again, any linguistic
philosopher could surely relate the cul-
tural recurrence of many of Jung’s
images and symbols to the continuity of
certain verbal habits. Because something
can regularly spring from some dark
corner of the unconscious, it is not trans-
cendent and significant for that reason
alone.
Jung’s virtue is that he pursued his
vocation seriously and with professional
Germanic thoroughness. He searched his
mind with tricks which would have re-
duced an English intellectual to helpless
giggles. His book is Wagnerian, soft,
regularly producing in the reader a curi-
ous mixture of agreement and annoy-
ance. This is because it is both the ac-
count of a grand internal struggle and
the fiddling of an old maid as she re-
arranges the ornaments on the dressing
table of her mind. Nevertheless it is
honest and humane, and part of the
tradition in which nature is reverenced
and trusted. If you fear the development
of a technology of the heart and soul,
you need not fear Jung and his fol-
lowers.
EARLE HACKETT
As The
Crow Flies
Feathers From The Green Crow. Sean
O’Casey. Ed. Robert Hogan. Mac-
millan. 375. 3d.
Tn this volume Robert Hogan has
brought together representative se-
lections from O’Casey’s writing of the
20-year period (1905-1925) which pre-
ceded his emergence as a major drama-
tist. The various pieces, grouped together
by subject matter, are given coherence
and narrative continuity by an unobtru-
sive editorial apparatus. Most of them
are prose works, many of them were con-
tributions to newspapers, few of them
retain much literary interest independent
of their now famous author. However,
O'Casey has by now attained that stature
where it becomes proper to collect every
available scrap of his writing. To that
extent, Mr Hogan deserves our thanks;
in “Feathers from the Green Crow” he
has made a necessary contribution to the
historical record.
It is as the record of a history wider
than O’Casey’s own life that the book
most immediately grips the mind. Many
of these pieces, precisely by virtue of
their on-the-spot topicality, vividly re-
create the rise of Irish Nationalism and
Irish Labor. But his work was never pure
reportage. It was a committed prose,
arguing from rather than towards given
positions; it was hard-hitting, deliberately
polemical in tone.
The process of O’Casey’s personal his-
tory in those years was a movement away
from Irish Nationalism towards Inter-
national Socialism, away from advocacy
of an Irish National Language to a de-
mand for better wages and conditions for
the Irish workers. The development of
such attitudes is in itself important for
understanding O'Casey’s later career.
Of equal interest is the search, revealed
in retrospect in his volume, for a suitable
tone of voice in which to express them.
The earliest piece printed in “Feathers
from the Green Crow” “The Soul of
Man,” a poem first published in 1905
is a colorlessly anonymous piece of verse.
But the fiery strength of O’Casey’s be-
liefs soon led him to a remarkably out-
spoken prose, a prose which depended
on a mixture of blunt sarcasm, direct
invective, and wild flashes of emotional
rhetoric.
Not surprisingly, such a manner em-
broiled O’Casey in a number of journal-
istic controversies, several of which are
recorded in this book. It may be that
the sense of futility engendered by these
encounters drove O Casey to seek a more
lastingly satisfying outlet for his ideas
in literary statement. Certainly an essay
like “The Sacrifice of Thomas Ashe” is
controlled by a rhetoric whose emotion
is not merely spurious or manufactured
for the occasion. And the book con-
cludes with six pieces four stories
and two short plays whose primary
motivation seems literary rather than
political. Only one piece, the play “Nan-
nie’s Night Out,” has any real intrinsic
merit.
One may not go so far as Mr Hogan,
who claims that “It is one of the superb
one-act plays of the modern stage, and
it must take its place next to the great
one-acts of O’Casey’s colleagues —-
Strindberg, Synge, and Shaw.” Never-
theless, it does reveal something of
O’Casey’s tragi-comic power, and stands
as a fitting conclusion to a book whose
contents essentially represent a prologue
to his great achievement.

Bare Knuckles
Captain Of The Push. Kenneth Rob-
erts. Lansdowne Press.
Tn his novice excursion into biographical
research Kenneth Roberts has
brought back from the tangled jungle of
old iron and rotting brick and clothes-
lines which Sydney used to call “The
Rocks” a portrait of Larry Foley, “Cap-
tain of the Push,” the greatest bare-
knuckle fighter of his day, the founder
of scientific boxing in Australia, Mine
Host of the popular White Horse Hotel
and master of the Iron Pot, one of the
most famous boxing academies of all
time.
Larry flourished at a period when gold
was coming out of Gulgong and Hill End
in slabs that needed a dray to carry them
literally, in the case of the Holterman
nugget and he won a lot of it which
had been dug out of the ground with
picks by the popular use of his fists on
the goldfields.
Mr Roberts has given us an effer-
vescent and readable picture of sporting
life in Sydney and the goldfields in the
days of the “pushes” and rushes and
later of the golden age of boxing on a
world scale when every schoolchild
knew the names of Foley, the almost
undefeated Bob Fitzsimmons, Slavin,
Griffo, Jem Mace and the rest. The
copious and well-chosen illustrations are
an unusually attractive feature of a read-
able book.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Some Local Promotion Needed
Three representatives of France Technique, a French
research organisation, have been doing an on-the-spot
research survey of Queensland at the invitation of the
Queensland Government. Their report on Queensland’s invest-
ment prospects, after presentation to the Queensland Govern-
ment, will be circulated to all member organisations of France
Technique.
The visiting researchers are experts in engineering, chemicals
and heavy industry as well as being clued up on the economics
side, so their report should make interesting reading.
It is extremely irritating to observe that Australians are
showing little interest in developing their own resources, but
are striving mightily to interest overseas groups. All this at
a time when everyone is shedding tears about excess liquidity
in the economy.
Overseas industrialists are not slow to recognise Australia’s
potential and they readily put up risk money to explore and
develop our resources. Evi-
dence of this is the heavy
capital investment by overseas
groups in oil, bauxite, iron
ore, etc. But if a few Aus-
tralians got together and
formed a company to develop
local resources, local share-
brokers would laugh haughtily
when asked to do some real
underwriting. “Take it away
and come back with five years’
audited figures,” they would
say.
Obviously, we have no faith
in our own ability. Or we sus-
pect that anyone who forms
a company without owning an
established profitable business
Free Market Raw Sugar Price
is necessarily a confidence man. Invariably, the prerequisite
of any company flotation based on developing local resources
is some overseas backing from a prominent company. Many
Australian companies have entered into joint ventures with
overseas groups. But there is a paucity of local effort in
floating an all-Australian show and surely it can’t be on the
grounds that there is a shortage of know-how and money in
this country.
Seems like the overseas groups have no difficulty in employ-
ing know-how, whether they import the specialist from London,
Timbuctoo or the depths of Arabia. Seems like a few Australian
specialists get jobs overseas, too. Maybe it’s an inferiority com-
plex of Australians, or we’ve fallen into a financial rut. But
it does appear as if we are not doing enough to develop our
own resources with our own money. If overseas companies can
take the risk (obviously with an eye to future profits), why can’t
we?
If Australia has £7som. in undrawn bank overdrafts,
£2ooom. in savings banks and many more millions in surplus
cash held by institutions and the public, there must be a pro-
portion of this available as “risk” capital. Local companies,
with a little initiative, could father the flotation of new enter-
prises without leaving the job to fly-by-night promoters. If they
do nothing, however, they can’t complain if overseas interests
skim the cream.
Free Sugar’s Hectic
Ups and Downs
fFHE giddy peaks of the world free sugar price are being
strikingly maintained by the past few days’ dealings on
the London Terminal Sugar Market. They have produced a
43-year top at £stglos a ton.
Prevailing sentiment certainly does not indicate that these
hectic levels arise solely from speculation, though this, as
might be expected, has played a continuous part in all the
recent fluctuations. A genuine
supply problem seems, how-
ever, to be growing more acute
and the situation is scarcely
susceptible to sudden relief.
Most observers cannot see
sugar’s statistical position im-
proving radically during the
next year, perhaps even until
1965. Some consumers are
tending to stockpile against
prolonged shortages, with an
inevitable influence on price.
An accompanying graph
shows the considerable price
variations from mid-1962 to
date. The latest upswing has
suffered very little interruption
since August this year.
It must be constantly kept in mind that only about 10 p.c.
of the entire world output finds its way on to the free market.
Almost 80 p.c. is consumed in producer countries. Of the
rest nearly half gets sold through special arrangements like
the British Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.
Thus the present price outlook hardly constitutes all
encouragement to the plans for massive Australian expansion
set out in the report of the Sugar Industry Inquiry Committee,
whose conclusions were summarised in The Bulletin last
week.
The element of gamble remains, for other producers are
just as liable to attempt a speedy lift in output under the
instigation of the immediate pricing scene. A few sources
predict a possibility of high surplus supplies in as short a
period as three years.
Much of the existing abnormalities stem straight from the
Cuban crop failures, where hurricanes have tragically
emphasised the effects of post-Castro inefficiencies. Those,
and poor European beet harvests, won’t go on forever, though
again it must be remembered that Cuba’s production, if


increased, will probably pass to Russia and China in accord
with long-term agreements.
So it appears probably true that the same kind of bilateral
arrangements may equally underpin Australia’s proposed out-
put extensions. Of late years Australian exports have moved
ahead of world net exports and of the free market also.
Nevertheless, as Mr G. R. Jackson of CSR suggests, any
“expanded sugar industry will be more sensitive to ‘free
market’ price instability than previously” and less of its
production might be protected by fixed price arrangements.
Free market oscillations, therefore, possess constant implica-
tions for future trading, however bilaterally assured part of
this may look. Governmental and international bodies, too,
could be paying them some attention, lest a sudden upsurge
in production, with a concomitant price drop, unduly harm
the less-developed countries.
Favorable Markets for
Base Metals
An the verge of the international Lead-Zinc Study Group’s
report of its Geneva deliberations, spot prices of the two
metals appeared a trifle nervous on the London Metal
Exchange. Nevertheless the ob-
vious recovery which has gone
on all this year is unlikely to
be arrested in any real way.
The other base metal, cop-
per, as the accompanying
graph displays, has been held
remarkably steady since early
1962 by nicely calculated pro-
ducer support.
With lead at above £stg67
a ton and zinc close to £Bl,
the combined price still does
not touch the best 1960 levels
but is beginning to look much
more rewarding for producers.
Certainly Australia’s Barrier
mines and Mount Isa have had
little to complain about lately.
Both metals continue to re-
flect a better demand situa-
tion arising from British and
US industrial liveliness. Gener-
ally, producers’ and consumers’
stocks are also running down.
A positive shortage of zinc may soon become visible in
America. Domestic mine production is not expected to be
lifted, so that some fairly small releases from the Govern-
ment's stock could well be supported by the Study Group.
New production from Canada is not expected to enter the
market until next year at the earliest.
The short-term position for lead and zinc seems reasonably
settled. Over the longer term most experts believe zinc
possesses the better price prospects.
Cautionary Tale of a
Business Error
/Connoisseurs of major business miscalculations or disasters
should find a great deal to delight them in “The Fate of
the Edsel and Other Business Adventures”, by John Brooks
(publisher Victor Gollancz Ltd). Mr Brooks is laden with ex-
perience of Wall Street and the American industrial world. He
turns his knowledge to entertaining, if not semi-cynical, account.
It may perhaps sound all too frivolous to laugh at some
commercial failures well after they have happened. Yet it can
be edifying, as well as amusing, to be occasionally reminded
how finance and business frequently engineer tremendous errors
quite apart from those which may later be blamed on the male-
volence of governments.
Mr Brooks’ main cautionary story concerns the designing,
launching and marketing by the Ford Motor Company in 1957
of a grandiloquent new model for the medium-priced range —•
the Edsel. Not to put too fine a word on it, he has to describe
the whole process as a gigantic flop. All the premeditation and
ballyhoo had suggested something far, far different.
The end result w’as disastrous, though it leaves only a dis-
tant echo in these days of booming car markets and dramatic-
ally successful launches.
Even before the first Edsel was unveiled to its host of vigor-
ously drummed-up and temporarily exclusive dealers, a quarter
of a billion dollars had gone. The budget demanded 200,000
sales in the initial year. After two years, to November 19, 1959,
when the make was “discontinued,” 110,810 Edsels had been
produced and 109,466 sold.
The loss is succinctly summed up: “Financial buffs estimate
that the company lost something like $2OO million on the Edsel
after it appeared; add to this the officially announced expendi-
ture of $250 million before it
appeared, subtract about a
hundred million invested in
plant and equipment that were
salvageable for other uses, and
the net loss is $350 million.”
All the rich, variegated re-
sources of motivational re-
search and advertising played
their allegedly scientific parts.
A personality, a buyer-type and
a name were to be indelibly
and accurately fixed by these
prior surveys.
Almost in desperation, at one
stage, an advanced and esoteric
American poet, Miss Marianne
Moore, was invited to bend her
talents to suggesting a name.
The efforts of genius included
Intelligent Bullet, Utopian Tur-
tletop, Pastelogram, Mongoose
Civique, Andante con Moto.
They were rejected, with dig-
nity.
Everything in the end turned out to be wrong gadgetry,
design, reception by the motoring editors. “A layman cannot
help wondering how the Ford Company, in all its power and
glory, could have been guilty of such a Mack Sennett routine
of build-up and anti-climax,” Mr Brooks muses.
He pays his final respects in terms of Elizabethan drama
“failure can have a certain grandeur that success never knows.”
Japanese Discuss Planning,
Foreign Trade
T ike Australia, Japan is now in the throes of a general
election. Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda and his Liberal-
Democrats face the country on November 21.
All three principal parties (the other two being the
Democratic Socialist and the Socialist) are giving considerable
attention to Ikeda’s famous 10-year plan, initiated in 1960
and which aims at doubling Japan’s national income by 1970.


Adjustments must be made because of the plan’s somewhat
one-sided success in favoring larger businesses.
No one doubts its basic effectiveness. For instance, one
commentator waxes almost ecstatic: “Under the Government’s
overall income doubling plan which snowballed at a pace even
exceeding the fondest expectations of its sponsors, the Japanese
economy surged ahead and upward to great heights.”
A certain imbalance has, however, been introduced by the
very triumphs of major industries such as steel, machinery and
chemicals. Finance has poured in their direction and
productivity has leapt.
Without radically revising the original plan, the Economic
Planning Agency suggests an extension of loans to small
businesses especially to help them purchase modern machinery.
The economy’s weaker sectors will be channelled into the
overall growth scheme. Agriculture is to get more Govern-
ment attention as well.
Japan's balance-of-payments position also receives plenty
of examination. For the first half of the current financial
year the overall balance was favorable, chiefly owing to inflow
of long-term capital.
In a speech to the Diet, Mr Ikeda had to admit a lift in
imports “due to the high level of mining and manufacturing”,
yet at the same time could point to a great expansion in
exports.
So far as Australia is concerned, the latest figures show
that Japan slightly lowered its adverse balance during 1962-63.
Australia’s surplus went back from 1961-62’s £137.4 million
to £108.3 million. Japan pushed exports up from £49.5 to
£64.7 million and bought from Australia goods valued at
£173 million against £186.9 million in 1961-62.
Disparity in European
Investment Tastes
A nother interesting development on Wall Street is the influx
of British capital as UK investors seek a hedge against
the election of a Labor Government. Despite the recent signs
of an encouraging uplift in British industrial production, many
British institutions are displaying a greater inclination to spread
their risks. It is now claimed that prominent British investment
trusts are putting about 40 p.c. of their money into US
securities.
This is in marked contrast to investors in Continental Europe.
Following the drain on US dollars and the claim that America
must cut back its expenses in Europe to help close the dollar
gap, European investors feel there is greater stability in keeping
investment close to home, where it can be watched closely
and may be less likely to violent market fluctuation.
US insistence on a 15 p.c. interest equalisation tax on new
fund raising in America also has soured some European finance
groups who find there is an increasing demand for their funds in
Europe.
More Pressure on
Gold Price
A T the time the Soviet was selling large quantities of gold on
the European market to finance grain purchases, US
authorities suggested it was costing Russia 60 dollars an ounce
to produce gold which sold at around the official market price
of 35 US dollars an ounce.
Subsequently, when US gold producers were seeking assist-
ance, it was claimed that the production cost for one leading
producer in the US was as high as 90 dollars an ounce. Natur-
ally, the company which made this claim announced it was
closing down until a payable price was obtained.
Pressure is growing in the US for government assistance to
gold producers, based on compensating them for the rise in
production costs since 1940. The Administration has set its face
against any direct increase in the price of gold, although it could
give further assistance to marginal producers, particularly as
current annual production of H million ounces is less than a
third of the amount produced in 1940.
One section of Congress, however, believes it is preferable
to buy gold from overseas producers rather than pay unjusti-
fiably high prices in the US, even by way of indirect subsidy.
Decimals: The Chinese Answer
to Calculating
The Victorian Employers’ Federation is always coming up
with bright ideas. Its latest is that the Victorian Government
should set up a pilot school for teaching the abacus, which they
say beats everything, electronic computers included, for sim-
plicity and efficiency in calculating and is ideally suited for
decimals, either for handling money or metric weights and
measures.
The Chinese and Japanese have been using the abacus for
centuries and local Chinese have expressed to the VEF their
willingness to teach the art to other Melburnians, saying that
an adult can learn to add on the machine in half an hour,
multiplying and dividing a little longer but with small effort
other than practice. The best age to learn it apparently is
between nine and ten.
With the thumb and first two forefingers of the same hand
flicking the counters with lightning speed, an abacus operator
can do for himself what today’s Western-style businessman
usually calls on others to do for him —in much longer time.
With an abacus he could make his own calculations —even
make them as he walked around his office —and not have to
spend precious time getting someone else to bring the answers
to him.
The abacus is cheap, it costs about 305., and can add and
subtract as fast as as an adding machine, and is nearly as fast
doing multiplication and division.
Few Western countries have given much thought to adopting
the abacus. They have instead continued with their own age-
old systems of arithmetic, and Australia is one of them.
Australians remain content with the long-tried present
methods, yet the Chinese and Japanese are continuing to use
a system in the most modern offices that in many ways would
save our industries millions of pounds, no matter how fancy
the machines get.
Tighter Credit on
Wall Street
A fter 15 months of being able to buy shares on a 50 p.c.
margin, Wall Street investors now must put up 70 p.c.
of the cash price. They can obtain credit for the remaining
30 p.c. from their broker or banker.
The latest move is taken as a sign that the Federal Reserve
Board, which fixes these margins, does not want to see prices
pushed too high by credit purchases. Doubtless, after witnessing
an all-time high this year, and taking into consideration the
Kennedy Administration’s warning that 1964 could see a re-
cession unless tax cuts are approved, the authorities want to
avoid any possible violent fluctuations. When credit purchasers
are sold out, price slides can be startling.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Economics and the Elections
How much need voters know to cast an intelligent vote?
Tn the next three weeks candidates from
all political parties will be attempting
to sway the electors with their various
brands of economic artistry. So how
much economics do voters need to know
to feel reasonably sure they are doing the
right thing on polling day?
Naturally, voters are most interested
in the prospects for full employment, and
it is understandable that Opposition
parties will tell them that they can do a
lot better than the Government in sec-
uring this.
On full employment, the first point to
bear in mind is that there is a unique
relationship between the level of employ-
ment and the availability of overseas re-
sources. Any Government which pushes
its economic activisation measures with-
out full recognition of that relationship
may well get full employment for a short
time, but courts the danger of having
high unemployment before long.
The essence of this relationship is that
80 p.c. of Australia's imports are raw
materials, commodities and other goods
used in the manufacturing operations of
Australian industry. If overseas resources
are insufficient to sustain imports of these
things at the rate required for full em-
ployment, then by one means or another
imports have to be reduced with the
possibility that industrial activity will
suffer and unemployment result.
JFrue, even in 1961, when the measures
taken in November of the previous
.year to cut back demand for imports to
.safeguard the balance of payments were
having their effect on industrial employ-
ment, it could have been argued that
this left a lot of internal resources un-
employed that could well have been
accommodated by concentrating demand
on sheltered industries that put little
strain on imports, which in turn could
have been restricted by direct controls
rather than an overall assault on spend-
ing power.
But this policy of putting the economy
in a strait - jacket of import controls,
which certainly worked well enough
when, during most of the 19505, in-
dustrial expansion was bigger than at
any other time in Australian history,
violates the whole principle of GATT
under whose rules Australia has elected
to live. If electors want to return to
import controls in periods when Aus-
tralia is not in the throes of a balance-of-
payments crisis, that is up to them. But
if they so decide, Australia will be put
on the outer in world economic relation-
ships on which, as a country uniquely
dependent on overseas trade, she is highly
obligated.
Given import controls, which ensure
that the country lives within its inter-
national means, this still means that full
employment for a rising work force in
conditions of price stability cannot be
guaranteed for very long if a Government
is determined to jack up internal economy
activity to the hilt. This follows from
the fact that, being denied necessary
imports, secondary industry is more likely
to contract rather than expand employ-
ment, which must therefore be concen-
trated on tertiary and high-cost import
replacement industries. Primary industry
cannot be relied on to absorb much more
of the labor force, and in any case could
be under strain from rising costs.
rjlHis is not to say that, especially in these
days when economies the world
over must be prepared to take risks, eco-
nomic policies aimed to achieve the maxi-
mum employment of internal resources
( even in face of balance-of-payments
uncertainties) should be eschewed in
favor of those which seek at the expense
of high unemployment to achieve price
stability. The danger in the latter is
that they bespeak stagnation and that is
something an under-developed country
such as Australia cannot afford at this
stage of world history.
What it does mean, however, is that
a balance must be struck. So long as
governments recognise the dangers, there
is no need to assume that one political
party would be more liable than another
to neglect the inflationary possibilities of
pushing its own income generation too
far in its attempt to maintain full employ-
ment in the face of balance-of-payments
stringency.
Happily, this question is largely an
academic one for electors this time, be-
cause although many will have been
disconcerted by the relatively slow im-
provement in the unemployment figures
over the last two or more years, the job
of restoring full employment has at last
been done and in any case overseas re-
serves are at near-record levels. Indeed,
economically speaking, the fact that it
has been done without pushing up prices
justifies in some measure the moderate
pace at which it has been accomplished.
It is easy to be wise after the event and
to point to the continuing build-up of
overseas reserves over the last two years
as evidence that more vigorous re-
employment policies were justified. A
more useful exercise for electors would
be to estimate whether the Government
or the Opposition would be the more
likely to be successful in maintaining
full employment in the future without
prejudicing price stability.
Tn this play the Government has its
sco e in the book and, as the Budget
showed, it is fully conscious of the in-
flationary potential lying idle in savings
bank deposits, the possibility of an
increase in the prosperity to spend and
the possible dangers from an uninhibited
revival in private investment. For the
Opposition’s part, there is talk of new
channels of spending to be opened up and
old ones to be refreshed, but, of course,
this is no reason to expect a superfluity
should it come to power. A party has to
be imaginative on the hustings.
A warning may be apposite at this
stage that in any event the danger appears
to be more one of over-full employment
being on the horizon, especially if econo-
mic policies which overstress the need
for more vigorous growth are put into
motion after the election. These are
superficially attractive at election times,
but in hard economic terms as everybody
in the country should know from the 1960
experience, they can lead to economic
disruption.
A critical consideration now is that
whereas up to this point since the reces-
sion the Government has had to take the
lead in very much more active income
generation simply because the private
sector has been dragging its feet, particu-
larly on the investment side, from now
on one would expect much more action
from the private sector. As at long last
the private sector seems to have taken
up the running, it will be necessary for
the Government to taper off its excep-
tional expenditure in order to make addi-
tional resources available to the private
sector. This places strict limitations on
the extent to which any party could
honor a promise to step up Government
investment or spending after the elec-
tions.
The best economic tag for electors to
take to the polling booths is that you can’t
get a quart out of a pint pot, at least
not without inflation.


NEW YORK COMMENT
The US Business Image of Australia
No worries about population growth as an economic problem
While many countries worry about
population growth as an economic
problem, the Commonwealth of
Australia continues to encourage immi-
gration as a key element in its programme
of economic development. Official policy
presently aims at attracting 135,000
newcomers a year.
With an area almost as large as the
United States, vast natural resources, and
not quite 11 million people, Australia’s
wish to increase its numbers is easy to
understand. More people mean a bigger
market base for large-scale industry,
desired not only for itself but also as a
means of diversifying exports, which are
still predominantly agricultural. Addi-
tions from outside have been sought also
as insurance against possible shortage in
the work force as a result of low birth
rates in the 1930-45 period.
The Commonwealth's recruiting efforts
have been concentrated on young people
and on selected occupational skills, draw-
ing principally from the United Kingdom
and some of the European continental
countries. Using generous financial in-
ducements, the immigration authorities
feel they can go some way toward tailor-
ing the population structure to the needs
of the growing economy.
This demographer’s delight, con-
versely, puts certain demands on the
economy’s performance. Even momen-
tary falterings in employment, for in-
stance, tend to slow the stream of arri-
vals. In the year ending June 30, 1962,
when the economy was still feeling the
effects of restraint put on to protect the
country’s reserves of gold and foreign
exchange, the net gain from immigration
was only 48,000. The year before it
had been 85,000; the following year it
was about 100,000.
for the slowdown induced by
that dose of austerity (applied in
1960-61) and for a recession in 1953, the
Australian economy has barreled along in
high gear for the past dozen years. Even
with the lulls, the estimated gross national
product in real terms has averaged an
annual increase of about 4.4 p.c. during
that time. The per capita level of GNP,
727 Australian pounds ($1,628 at the
official rate of £A = $2.24), is one of the
higher standard-of-living statistics in the
world. Prices rose rather insistently
through most of the 1950 s but have
steadied of late. Illiteracy hardly exists,
the average life expectancy is higher than
for the US population, and there is a

motor vehicle for every 3.3 persons in
the country.
There are reasons for expecting the
good things to get better. A big reason
is the recent rich discoveries of bauxite
and iron ore, along with potentially
rich finds of oil. These newly found
resources will reduce the need for
mineral imports, and the bauxite and iron
ore hold definite promise of importantly
increasing export earnings.
bauxite deposits are the largest
known in the world. They are located
around the country’s north-east tip in the
State of Queensland, and across the Gulf
of Carpentaria in the Northern Terri-
tory. Estimates of the size of the re-
serves run above 3 billion tons.
New facilities being completed this year
are giving Australia aluminium smelling
capacity well above the needs of domes-
tic consumption, so that refined alu-
minium as well as bauxite and alumina
will be looking for export channels By
contrast, as recently as last year alu-
minium was an import item of rising
volume.
The new iron ore discoveries are in
Western Australia. Some calculations
put them as high as 8 billion tons. With
bountiful supplies of coal, sulphur, and
limestone, Australia is a price-competi-
tive steel producer in many lines, includ-
ing some of the more specialised grades
and shapes. Output nearly tripled dur-
ing the 1950 s and continues to grow.
At the most important centre, Port
Kembla, construction is under way to
expand capacity for stainless steel and tin-
plate and improve shipping facilities for
export. Other capital improvements in
the industry include installation of new
oxygen furnaces.
Australian hopes are high over the
discovery, late in 1961, of commercial
quantities of oil in the new Moonie field,
in southern Queensland. The find came
after many years of disappointing drill-
ing in many parts of the country.
Moonie field now has some 15 producing
wells, and construction recently began
on a 200-mile pipeline to carry the oil to
the port of Brisbane.
Since the hit, the oil hunt has gone
forward with new intensity, spurred by
Government subsidy that last year
amounted to some $9 million and by
the rapid growth of domestic consump-
tion. Gasoline alone is used at the rate
of some 128 gallons (imperial) a year for
each man, woman, and child a rate
exceeded only in the US, Canada, and
New Zealand.
Imports of crude for processing at
Australian refineries, and other petroleum
products, have been accounting for about
13 p.c. of the total import bill, not count-
ing heavy shipping expenses. Moonie’s
10,000 barrels a day are only a small
fraction of the total need.
While the current excitement over
Australia’s mineral prospects centres
mostly on the future hopes for bauxite,
iron ore, and oil, the old reliables of
volume continue, for the present, to be
lead, zinc, copper and coal. The Com-
monwealth is the free world’s largest pro-
ducer of lead; last year’s tonnage was
370,000, almost one-fifth of the recorded
world total. Output of zinc rose to some
338,000 tons in 1962, ranking third in
world production outside the Communist
bloc.
Australia’s extensive coal reserves are
found mostly in the eastern States. A
sizeable market for coking coal has been
developed among Japanese steelmakers,
and substantial orders for the next seven
years are on the books from that group
of users.
A lthough diversification of exports has
been substantial and promises to in-
crease, wool firmly holds its traditional
place as Australia’s chief outgoing pro-
duct and, indeed, the chief prop of the
economy. From a sheep and lamb popu-
lation believed to have hit a new high
recently, near 159 million, the country
takes an annual clip now running near
1.7 billion pounds 3O p.c. of the world
total and expected to go even higher
in the current growing year.
As much as 95 p.c. of it goes abroad.
The bales clearing through Sydney and
11 other auction centres account for
about 40 p.c. of Australia’s foreign-
exchange earnings. The biggest custo-
mer is Japan, which recently displaced
the UK as chief taker.
Meat, wheat, sugar and dairy products
also are major export items. Between
agriculture and mining, primary products
account for the dominant share of all
sales made abroad, exposing Australia’s


trading position to the sometimes violent
swings that occur in world commodity
prices. Lately the trend has improved
from its generally unfavorable direc-
tion during the latter 19505. In the past
two fiscal years there has been a net
surplus on merchandise trade.
Australia consistently runs a net deficit,
however, on such “invisibles” as transpor-
tation, travel and investment income.
This drain and the increase in imports
prompted by domestic prosperity have
kept the current-account sector of the
Commonwealth's balance of payments in
the red.
Financing this deficit is normally not a
problem. The exciting potential opened
by Australia’s new mineral discoveries
and the generally favorable climate
it provides for business enterprise are as
effective at attracting foreign private
capital as the immigration programme is
at drawing needed people. In fact, the
infusions of capital from abroad
equivalent to some $4 billion (including
reinvested earnings) since World War II
and estimated at more than SSOO million
this year alone not only have covered
the minus figures of the current account
but by last June 30 had helped build
Australia’s reserves of gold and foreign
exchange to a record dollar equivalent
of $1.4 billion.
That figure represented a gain during
fiscal 1963 of some $145 million, over
and above transfer of $26 million to the
International Monetary Fund to complete
Australia’s pay-up of its 25 p.c. “gold”
subscription.
HThe influx of alien funds, supplement-
ing a high rate of internal savings,
has enabled capital formation to reach a
level of 28 p.c. of gross national pro-
duct a high figure even when allow-
ance is made for the unusual practice in
Australian income accounting of con-
sidering private automobiles a form of
fixed capital. The bulk of capital inflow
from overseas has been in the form of
direct investment from the United
Kingdom and the United States. Besides
helping to develop the mineral industries,
foreign money and the technology ac-
companying it have spurred growth in
such manufacturing lines as chemicals,
motor vehicles, and electrical equipment,
which Australia hopes will leaven its
heavy dependence on primary commodi-
ties as a source of export earnings.
Within the domestic economy, the
secondary industries have been growing
much faster than farming and the extrac-
tive lines; but, except for steel and motor
vehicles, progress in building foreign
markets for manufactures has been im-
pressive chiefly in relation to the very
modest starting base.
Until growth of the whole economy
affords Australian manufacturing indus-
try more of the efficiencies of large-scale
operation, it will be hard for most of
the country’s finished and semi-finished
goods to meet price competition in
foreign markets, especially where sub-
stantial transportation costs are involved.
The Government is trying to offset this
disadvantage, at least in part, by grant-
ing generous tax incentives to exporting
companies. Firms that increase foreign
sales by a specified percentage above a
base period are excused in part or even
in full from the 2i p.c. payroll tax. Also,
a special income-tax allowance, amount-
ing to a double deduction, is granted for
expenses which companies incur in pro-
moting overseas sales.
HPhe drive to export more manufactures
is throwing a few burrs into the
basically smooth relationship between
domestic authority and foreign capital.
Australia would like to see local enter-
prises go after exports aggressively wher-
ever possible. Foreign parents, however,
in some cases restrict the marketing scope
of their Australian subsidiaries —for in-
stance, in the matter of selling to coun-
tries in the Communist bloc. Rancor
over this kind of cross-purpose has not
reached the proportions in Australia that
it has in Canada, but it looks like a
coming problem. Some discontent also
has been voiced over the size of the
foreign stake in mining enterprises, rela-
tive to local ownership.
That the Commonwealth is disposed to
take a reasonable line in resolving any
such areas of difficulty is evident from a
passage in the Government’s latest an-
nual economic survey: “Anything done
to discourage forms of investment hav-
ing no particular value to us is apt to
involve the risk of discouraging other
investments, some of which we may very
much need.”
Both in investment and in trade, a
decided shift has been occurring in the
pattern of Australia’s external relation-
ships. The United Kingdom is still the
principal outside stakeholder and the
chief trading partner, but its margin of
leadership in both capacities is narrow-
ing. The United States is putting in in-
vestment money at a faster rate and also
is increasing its percentage share in Aus-
tralia’s total trade imports and ex-
ports while the UK’s share has de-
clined.
In terms of exports alone, Australia’s
fastest-growing trade has been with
Japan, which now ranks second only to
the UK as a customer. Other major
buyers are neighbor New Zealand and
Communist China, which has purchased
some 100 million bushels of wheat
during the past year. Sale of 58.5 mil-
lion bushels to the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was announced last
month.
Perhaps a symbol of the gradual
thinning of commercial links with the
British Commonwealth can be read into
the choice of the name to be given the
new Australian unit of currency when
a decimal system of denomination is put
into effect probably early in 1966.
The new unit, equal to half the present
pound in value, will be the Australian
dollar (SA). The Government originally
had proposed to call it the “Royal”, but
public reaction caused a switch.
One Australian dollar will equal 100
cents (one cent Australian=l.l2 cents
US), and there will be a number of in-
termediate coins. The Government has
pledged “reasonable compensation” to
owners of “monetary machines” (e.g.,
cash registers, accounting machines)
needing conversion.
This official attentiveness to the house-
keeping needs of the private economy is
not surprising in the country that was
first in the world to produce government
statistics on national income. But,
while the Federal Administration at Can-
berra and its counterparts in the six
sovereign States keep careful watch on
economic activity, they are also careful
not to suffocate it.
country's pioneering, land-taming
history has begotten both a rugged
spirit of enterprise and a broad stripe of
collectivist tendency. With its single-vote
margin in the Elouse of Representatives,
Prime Minister Menzies’ Liberal-
Country Party coalition must steer care-
fully between the coexistent traditions.
Subsidy is known to a number of in-
dustries although not to the largest
branch of agriculture, wool. Railroads,
telephone, telegraph, and most electric
power generating facilities are Govern-
ment-owned and operated. A national
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission
and corresponding State authorities
largely determine wages and a number of
other labor-management questions.
Ever since the squeak-through elec-
tion that barely returned it to office in late
•1961, the Federal Government has
applied monetary and fiscal stimulus to
sthe economy. Restraints had been put on
in 1960 to check price inflation and halt
an imports binge that was threatening to
run down the reserves of foreign ex-
change. The domestic curbs, selected in
preference to trade restrictions such as
had been used to regulate imports in
earlier periods of stress, did their work
but cost votes by slowing business activity
and running up unemployment.
The Menzies medicine for recovery has
included a boost in unemployment bene-
fits, investment allowances for new
manufacturing plant, tax reduction, and


enlarged public works. Meanwhile,
Government borrowing (both at home
and abroad) and the rebuilding of offi-
cial reserves have provided the base for
monetary expansion. The banks have
been encouraged to go in for longer-term
lending by creation of special facilities
in the Reserve Bank.
Under the prod of official stimulus,
economic activity has resumed momen-
tum to the point where the Government
could say, in its report last June: “Most
of the reasons for doubt which prevailed
a year or more ago have since cleared up
and our underlying situation is un-
doubtedly sound”. Figures subsequently
released indicate that estimated gross
national product for the year ended June
30, at £A7.9 billion, was up 9 p.c. over
the previous year.
The official appraisal of underlying
soundness is supported by the fact that,
over the past two years, the cost-of-
living index has held steady and whole-
sale prices collectiyely have dropped.
The Government is aware, however, of
the danger of renewed inflation, which
could bring back balance-of-payments
trouble and wreck efforts to push Austra-
lian manufactures in foreign markets.
The June White Paper on economic
affairs noted:
“Official monetary policy has
sought to keep the situation liquid
... At the same time, of course, it
has been necessary to keep a cau-
tious eye on the possibilities that
could arise if the public and the
business world began to use more
actively the great supply of money
actually or potentially at their dis-
posal”.
fjPHE prevailing optimism both offi-
-*■ cial and private—over Australia’s
economic prospects is properly tempered
by awareness that nature, which has en-
dowed the continent so richly, also has
imposed some formidable difficulties.
The very vastness of the land creates pro-
blems of transportation and communi-
cation. The population is mainly
pocketed in a few patches of coastal area.
In the central and western portions is
the great, barren “dead heart”. The
promising new mineral discoveries are
chiefly in remote, forbidding regions
where development will offer stern
challenge to both spirit and substance.
Perhaps the greatest problem, ironic-
ally for a country that is a huge island
as well as a continent, is water. Rain-
fall is hopelessly inadequate over much
of the land. Artesian pools lie under the
eastern desert and make irrigation pos-
sible, but only at considerable price in
exploration and construction.
A sector in the south-eastern States of
New South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia is being claimed for agricul-
ture as a by-product of the $9OO-million
Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project,
already well advanced. But much of the
inland region, on the basis of any present
assessment, must be written off as un-
usable.
The Australians spend little time de-
ploring difficulties. In this they follow
the lead of Captain Arthur Phillip,
founder of the British settlement at Syd-
ney in 1788. “No other country offers
less assistance to first settlers”, he wrote
home, but hastened to add his prediction
that the land would prove the most
valuable of all on which British settlers
had landed.
In that no-nonsense spirit, the Austra-
lians have the water problem under
systematic attack, even while realising
it may never be fully solved. A conti-
nent-wide survey is under way to learn
more about both surface and subter-
ranean supply. Conservation and supply
projects are going forward at a number
of locations. Australian scientists are
preparing a national symposium on
water resources. And, as if to put the
whole matter in perspective with a splurge
of disdain, Canberra this month started
filling an ornamental lake, built to com-
plete the design laid out for the Federal
capital by the American architect, Walter
Burley Griffin.
Flying Australia’s Food Flag
You don’t have to be a follower of Zig
A and Zag to appreciate the fact that
the Peters flag is flying high on the food
mast in Victoria. From Mr Emil Chris-
tensen’s remarks at the recent annual
meeting of the company —oddly enough
named Peters Ice Cream (Vic.) any re-
maining doubts that it will yield to take-
over pressures from overseas concerns
can be set aside at once.
Since its takeovers of interstate com-
panies like Edgells, Peters is no longer,
of course, to be considered merelv a
Victorian concern, but rather one which
is the mainstay of the rearguard forces
still battling to stop the onslaught of
overseas interests attempting to cut out
larger slices of the whole Australian food
industry.
Mr Christensen, who has been manag-
ing director of Peters since 1939 and its
chairman since 1942, is determined to
hold these overseas forces at bay. saving
at the meeting that “we don’t want Aus-
tralia to get into the same position as
Canada which is now dominated by over-
seas capital.” He said it was his and the
company’s ardent hope that Peters would
remain a wholly Australian-owned com-
pany whose profits were retained here
where they rightly belonged.
Peters is, in fact, Mr Christensen’s life
work. He has been with the company
for 33 years, starting as a chemist in
charge of the laboratory in 1929, the
year the company was formed in Victoria
by Mr A. B. Peters to make ice-cream.
Promotion came rapidly and in 1931
Christensen was made manager, two
years later a director and. just before the
war started, managing director.
When Mr Christensen started at Peters
the company employed about 50. Today
it has more than 3000 on the payroll in
five States. Apart from the parent, there
are 31 companies in the group, the big-
gest of these being Gordon Edgell, Inter-
national Canners, Holdenson & Nielson,
Four’n Twenty Pies, Gourlay Cabinet
and J. Hargreaves & Sons.
The acquisition in 1961 of Holdenson
and Nielson allowed for the integration
of the existing Peters butter organisation,
and made the combined group the largest
butter producer in Victoria, with butter
factories located at strategic points
throughout the State. The company’s
purchase of Four’n Twenty Pies gave it
the largest manufacturer of meat and
fruit pies in Melbourne, and also a sig-
nificant counter-balance to the seasonal
ice-cream sales peak.
In 1961 it acquired the long established
canning and food processing assets of
Gordon Edgell in NSW and Tasmania
which still markets under the internation-
ally known Bird's-Eye and Gerber brands,
the latter in association with Gerber (US).
J. Hargreaves & Son Pty Ltd, manufac-
turers of the Hargreaves and Gold Coas-
ter range of food products, joined the
group last year. As well as extending its
interests and range of products in ice-
cream (Tasmanian Ice Cream and But-
tercup ice-cream group in Victoria were
acquired 1962-63), and other fields most
recent takeovers were R. E. Cann and
Sons and the Buttercup group.
Probably because Mr Christensen has
been Danish Consul in Victoria since
1946, many people think he is actually a
Dane and therefore are rather amazed
at his dedication to the principle of Aus-
tralian control. The facts are, however,
that he was born in Brisbane of Danish
parents (his grandfather was a judge in
Denmark), and graduated as a chemist
there.
Like Kielburg. another famous Dane
who was head of the big United Molasses

French Exports and American
Trading Barriers
Agreement, between Common Market and America hard
By LUCIEN BOZ
The French Government has been
attacked more than once for its
uncompromising stand to preserve
the constitution of the Common Market
as defined by the Treaty of Rome. Great
Britain would now be a member of the
Common Market but for the de Gaulle
veto.
I took the opportunity of a trip to
France to try to find out other reasons
for Great Britain’s exclusion than those
already advanced in statements to the
Press and in Press commentaries. I was
fortunate to meet and discuss this matter
of French policy with a French
economist in a high official position
dealing with Common Market problems.
First of all France, he told me, will
accept Great Britain into the EEC but
not for 12 or 15 years. Before acceptance
Britain must clear up most of her obliga-
tions towards the member-nations of the
Commonwealth. She cannot ask for
special treatment while still endeavoring
to put her own house in order. She
must accept the letter and the spirit of
the Treaty of Rome.
But besides Britain’s commitments to
her Commonwealth partners, another
reason lies behind the staunch French
opposition. This is the fear that England,
already heavily committed diplomatically
and militarily to the USA, will help the
United States to come to a position of
influencing future decisions of the
Common Market.
To prove that the policy of the USA
towards France is a discriminatory one,
the economist gave me a few striking
examples of tariff attitudes on a Federal
as well as a State level which closely
protect the USA producer.
rFAKE steel, for instance, which he gave
me as a star example of how the
US protects her own industry against
European imports. The principal pro-
tective measures derive from the anti-
dumping laws, the escape clause of the
amended Trade Agreements Extension
Act of 1951, the Buy American Act of
1933, customs formalities, the slow
assessment of customs duties in various
American ports (which may, in the case
of New Orleans, take from eight months
to two years for steel products), dis-
crimination against Thomas steel, and
clauses in schedules of customs charges
that can be used to prohibit entry of
European steel products.
It is worth looking closely at the dis-
crimination against Thomas steel as a
specific example. American standards,
as laid down by the American Society
for Testing Materials (ASTM), provide
for the use of steels made only by the
Martin, Acid Bessemer or LD processes.
The basic Bessemer or Thomas pro-
cesses are excluded from these standards.
Consequently, it is only necessary for
the Federal Administration, one or other
of the States or countries to specify
application of ASTM standards for
Thomas steels, which form almost all
of the steel products imported from
European factories, to be excluded from
contracts signed by these authorities even
if Thomas steels meet the requirements
otherwise specified in the project under
consideration.
T>esides all the general obstacles just
mentioned, there are the regulations
of the different States which may some-
times even go contrary to the obligations
of the USA towards GATT. For
example, imported steels for road and
bridge building have been prohibited by
decisions of States such as Alabama
(domestic steels must be used), Cali-
fornia (domestic materials, preferably
Californian, must be used exclusively),
Maryland (reinforcing rods must be of
domestic origin), New Jersey (only
domestic material must be used), New
York (imported steel prohibited unless
specifically authorised), Pennsylvania
(imported material prohibited) etc.
The effect of these measures is
accentuated by the fact that the Federal
authorities have little influence over
local bodies in such matters and can only
break down trade barriers after long and
difficult legal proceedings.
The US Trade Expansion Act of 1962
contains clauses that could have a
serious effect on international trade.
Paragraph 252, for instance, requires
the President, in certain circumstances,
to make reprisals in such cases as other
countries enacting “unjustifiable” re-
strictions against imports from the USA.
The President is empowered to fix very
high customs duties on imports from the
offending countries.
A further example is the amendment
to Article VII of the Trade Agreements
Extension Act of 1955 and repeated in
the Trade Expansion Act. This gives to
the Director of the Office of Civil and
Defence Mobilisation the power to
examine whether a product is being
imported into the USA in such
quantities that it jeopardises “national
security”. If such is the case, the Buy
American Act can be invoked. Reasons
of “national interest” (a vague criterion)
can also be used by the Office of Civil
and Defence Mobilisation for the same
purpose —as happened recently when
imports of knitted woollen gloves were
restricted.
HThese discriminatory measures taken by
the USA, on both Federal and State
levels in order to protect local American
producers against European imports and
to encourage exports, apply not only to
steel and gloves but to many other
products.
An amusing example but not so
amusing for the French exporter in-
volved —is the following. A manu-
facturer of sausages in France sent a
big consignment of the best of his
products to the USA. Unloading of the
goods was refused and they were sent
back to France because the label on the
tins of sausages showed the sausages
giving off smoke and steam as they
appear when being prepared in the
factory. However, regulations in the
particular American State where they
were to be unloaded prohibit such food
products being illustrated on a label in
any other way than as they appear in
the tin.
Many other examples were given to
me by the French economist. I think the
facts of steel imports into the USA speak
for themselves. Although the general
public may not read of this struggle by
European exporters to obtain an entry
for their products into the USA, it is
an everyday battle and a very real one
for businessmen of the Common Market
countries.
President Kennedy has idealistic plans
for the United States in relation to
international trade. The facts of the
present trade position between the USA
and Common Market countries show
how many barriers exist between the
European exporter, in particular the
French exporter, and the market for his
goods in the US. Until these restrictions
are removed or lessened, the prospects
of having Great Britain in the Common
Market, and by the same token a general
agreement between the USA and the
Common Market countries, will scarcely
be possible.


Finance Cos. Enjoy Car Boom
Release of Pent-up Demand Claimed as a Prime Cause
With plenty of money about,
more people are paying cash when
they buy a car. The car boom is
still providing a rising trend of busi-
ness for the finance companies,
although they claim the reposses-
sion rate is rising. Competition is
permitting easier credit terms and
this is causing some purchasers to
fall behind in their payments, lead-
ing finance executives told The
Bulletin last week.
Tncreased new car registrations and a
larger turnover in used cars have
benefited not only the car dealers them-
selves but the giants behind them the
finance houses.
Many car dealers feel that the hire
purchase companies have been partly
responsible for their increased trade, and,
conversely, some of the finance com-
panies give credit to the dealers for their
higher figures. Although the financiers
will not give actual figures indicating
an increase in the vehicle section of their
business, their answer is a simple “yes”
to the question: “Are your figures up?”
The higher figures are not confined
solely to vehicle finance all sections
of financing, apparently, are running
ahead of the figures for the correspond-
ing period last year.
Reasons for the larger vol-
ume of business written are
claimed to be the release of a
pent-up demand, more attract-
ive terms to the purchaser, and
a greater public awareness of
hire purchase.
General manager of Aus-
tralian Guarantee Corporation,
Mr G. L. Carter, non-commit-
ally says business is “a bit
higher. But then September,
October and November are all
peak months.” For competitive
reasons, Mr Carter would not
say what percentage of AGC’s
business the new and used veh-
icle section now occupies, but
said that it finances new and
used vehicles in equal propor-
tions.
As with most finance com-
panies, AGC’s finance is available to all
car dealers, big or small. Mr Carter said
the repossession rate was showing a tend-
ency to rise.
■•Repossession is a bad thing. The
dealer loses a customer, we lose a custo-
mer and "; e '° se m ° ne , y 0n the re ? os -
session, Mr Carter said.
Competition in the industry is very
strong. There is a tendency to easier
terms and it is thus easier for the pur-
chaser to fall behind on payments.”
Mr Carter would not indicate the rate
of repossession.
While there is an increase in hire
purchase, Mr Carter feels there is also
an increase in cash sales. “There are
more cars sold for cash than hire pur-
chase. About 30 p.c. of new cars and
60 p.c. of used cars are financed.”
In the highly competitive hire pur-
chase industry, Mr Carter finds one big
city account equal to ten small subur-
ban accounts.
Finance of agricultural implements is
another field AGC finds lucrative. “We
do a lot of agricultural finance. We
claim to be the biggest financiers of farm
machinery We do most of the finance
for Fer°uson and Ford
®
AGCs ba | ance sheet at June 30
showed outstandings of £67.5 million -
.... . ,
a £6.2 million increase over the previous
year’s figure of £61.3 million. Directors
expected an increase in profit for the
current year “reflecting the return to
buoyant economic conditions”, they said
in the annual report.
Dealing solely in new car finance, Car
Credits Pty Ltd, an offshoot of the
National Roads and Motorists’ Associa-
tion (NRMA), currently is enjoying
increased business, a spokesman said.
Facilities of Car Credits, available only
to NRMA members, include a mandatory
50 p.c. deposit on the vehicle to be
financed.
Also offered by Car Credits is possibly
the lowest interest rate offered by any
sizeable car financier 6 p.c. The
spokesman said Car Credits required
the 50 p.c. deposit to give purchasers a
greater equity in the car.
“It also reduces repayments and en-
ables us to offer a low interest rate. We
have also found that the incidence of
insurance claims on cars with a lower
deposit is higher than when the owner
has a greater interest. And our repos-
session rate, because the owner has so
much more to lose if he falls behind on
payments, is only a fraction of one p.c.
—almost non-existent.”
Because Car Credits is open only to
NRMA members it does not
advertise anywhere but in the
association’s journal “Open
Road”. Here, again, Car Cre-
dits’ finance extends to all deal-
ers. But it will finance only
new vehicles.
The spokesman said the in-
crease in business was due, in
part, to the large amount of
money readily available. “You
only have to look at the sav-
ings bank deposits to see just
how much money there is.” At
the end of September deposits
in all savings banks in Aus-
tralia stood at £2,042,760,000
—£18,440,000 higher than the
August figure, £2,024,320,000.
The spokesman said Car
Credits was experiencing good
business, partially due to the
release of new model cars. Not a member
of the Hire Purchase and Finance Con-
ference, Car Credits was established in
1933, ceased operations at the out-
break of World War 1, and resumed in

which deals mainly in real estate finance,
finances second-hand cars to the tune
G f about £25.000-£30,000 a week,
says managing director ’Mr R. E. m!
Hutcheson.
Cambridge Credit does not finance
new cars and only finances second-hand
cars i n Newcastle and Adelaide. On
the second-hand cars it charges between
25 p.c. and 33 1-3 p.c. deposit and 9 p.c.
at rate interest.
Mr Hutcheson said the company’s
figures were about 20 pc. higher than
for last year. “But car finance is a


specialist’s game we don’t do it in
Sydney or Melbourne. We specialise in
mortgage and real estate finance. The
mortgage and real estate finance section
is moving up. Our outstandings now
total about £l7 million compared with
£16.7 million at June 30.
“Of this £l7 million, about £l4 mil-
lion is tied up in mortgages and real
estate and the other £3 million in other
hire purchase. About £1.4 million is tied
up in car finance. Mortgages take about
65 p.c. of the business, real estate about
10 p.c., consumer goods 121 p.c. and
others 124 p.c.
“There is a greater volume of cars
being sold at the moment. I put it down
to the Big Wet we had earlier this year.
From October on business should move
quicker because the warmer weather
does have an effect.”
Cambridge Credit confines its busi-
ness in second-hand cars mainly to the
purely second-hand car dealer, although
it does occasionally finance second-hand
cars for new-car dealers.
Used and new vehicle finance com-
prises about 70 p.c. of Custom Credit
Corporation Ltd’s business, said Mr
E. A. Edwards, general manager. Con-
sumer goods take 3 p.c., mortgages 17
p.c., and other finance 10 p.c.
Mr Edwards said Custom Credit had
experienced higher figures for the last
quarter compared with the correspond-
ing quarter last year. “We recorded
higher figures in the vehicle finance sec-
tion than in the others,” he said. “And
the increase we recorded is greater than
the increases in other sections of the
business.
“Custom Credit finances vehicles in the
ratio of 40 p.c. new to 60 p.c. used. That
ratio has remained fairly static.”
11/Ir Edwards said more and more
people were seeking finance for
motor vehicles—probably because current
deposits being offered are so low. “The
smaller deposit is directing a trend
towards the new car,” Mr Edwards said.
Custom Credit’s outstandings at June
30 stood at £85,313,416, slightly up on
the figure for the previous year
£84,669,100. But the group’s profit
declined sharply by £222,629 to give a
1962-63 profit of £1,050,547. It main-
tained its 15 p.c. dividend.
An executive of Alliance Holdings Ltd
thinks there are greater cash sales today
than ever before. “Hire purchase is
higher this year than last year,” he said.
“But since then we have opened two
more branches. Business this year has
generally been at a higher level all
sections of the business are at a higher
level.
“There has been a trend among the
finance companies to diversification. Five
years ago Alliance was solely hire pur-
chase, now it is everything.” The execu-
tive said the increase in motor vehicle
sales was brought about by the drop of
sales during the credit squeeze.
“People found it hard to buy then,
but they can buy now quite easily. And
during the credit squeeze a lot of com-
panies did not replace their fleets of
vehicles. Now they are doing so. There
are a lot more vehicles being sold for
cash, too, than before.”
Australia’s largest finance house, In-
dustrial Acceptance Corporation Ltd,
has the bulk of its outstandings of
£96,013,999 tied up in vehicle finance.
Managing director Mr W. M. Edmends
said lAC financed used and new vehicles
in the ratio of six-to-four. “We must
always keep funds available for the
motor trade. We do a reasonable amount
of mortgage and an infinitesimal amount
of household appliance finance. We are
basically a motor car house.”
lAC also finances tractors and farm
implements. Mr Edmends said the re-
possession rate was “going up. It is
running at a higher rate than last year,
but fortunately not too high.” Mr
Edmends added that lAC’s figures for
the last quarter showed an increase over
the corresponding period last year.
Collective voice for the major finance
companies is the Elire Purchase and
Finance Conference. It has 24 mem-
bers.
Chairman this year of the Conference
is Mr J. H. Partridge, managing director
of Alliance Holdings Ltd. The confer-
ence held its bi-monthly meeting in Syd-
ney last week.
Mr Partridge said the Conference had
“always liked to see” hire purchasers
offering a larger deposit than asked on
goods. “This gives them some equity
in what they are buying and reduces the
payments,” Mr Partridge said. “And it
also reduces the rate of repossession
where the hirer has more to lose if he
lets payments lapse.”
One of the finance companies’ big-
gest bugbears is State-imposed stamp
duty on hire purchase transactions. Mr
Partridge said the hire purchase business
in Victoria, where stamp duty is 2 p.c.,
was “not very profitable at all”. In Vic-
toria and Tasmania, stamp duty is 2 p.c.,
14 p.c. in Western Australia and 1 p.c.
in South Australia, New South Wales
and Queensland.
“If all the States levied a 2 p.c. stamp
duty on transactions there would be no
hire purchase in Australia,” he claimed.
“And the cost of the stamp duty must be
borne by the hire purchase company
... it cannot be passed on to the con-
sumer. Stamp duty has cut into the busi-
ness so much that companies are showing
only about 2 p.c. profit on every £lOO
employed.
“We are challenging the validity of the
Victorian Government in levying stamp
duty on hire purchase transactions. It
is a test case but if we win I think other
States may drop it too.”
Mr Partridge said hire purchase was
becoming more and more popular with
the Australian public. “Many people,
even though they have the money in the
bank, would rather buy on terms and
leave their money where it is.. They
know that if they draw on their savings
they don’t have to pay the bank back.
But they know they have to pay the fin-
ance company.
“They’d rather keep their money for
a rainy day.”
Although the Conference would pre-
fer people signing agreements to pay
a larger deposit than required, it does
not wish to raise deposits beyond their
current level.
“If we raised the minimum deposit
on a new car from 20 p.c. to 50 p.c. it
would cut business back. If it was raised
from 20 p.c. to 25 p.c. it would not have
much effect. If it was cut from 20 p.c.
to 15 p.c. it would not make any differ-
ence.”
Tn NSW the minimum deposit on a
A new car is 20 p.c., and on a used car
25 p.c. In Victoria and WA no deposit
is required and in South Australia and
Queensland it is 10 p.c. In Tasmania
it is 20 p.c. on new and used cars.
The finance companies can and do ask
for larger deposits on used cars. Depend-
ing on the age of the car the deposit can
go to one-third for a 1955-57 model and
a half for 1953-54 models. Most of the
companies too charge the maximum per-
missible interest rates of 7 p.c. per
annum flat for new cars and 9 p.c. per
annum flat for used cars.
Mr Partridge said the hire purchase
industry had only started to grow rapidly
in the ’sos. “Before the war outstand-
ings totalled only £2O million. In 1945
they had fallen to £6 million and didn’t
pick up again until 1947-48 when they
went back to about £2O million.
“In 1960 the figure stood at £438 mil-
lion until the credit squeeze cut it back
by £46 million. It continued to fall
until June, 1962, when the outstandings
showed a slight rise from £370.7 million
to £373.5 million. Since June, 1962,
they have been rising. They now stand
at £430 million.”


“CROESUS”
No Time for Father Christmas
What Mr Colwell would do to the Economy
A fter listening to Mr Calwell at the
Royal Ballroom last Wednesday,
thoughtful electors may well wonder what
will happen in the economy next year
if he gets the chance to load it with all
the additional Government expenditure
he proposed.
The danger is that the ALP has hand-
picked its handouts to please the ordinary
voter, who could be taken in by them.
Indeed, few people will find the spread-
ing of largesse in so many worthwhile
directions unacceptable, provided, of
course, these are within the country’s
capacity to finance. That is the main
point. More particularly the urgent tag
of about £l3O million on some of the
proposals immediately raises the question
whether the economy would be able to
accomodate such an increase in Gov-
ernment outlay in 1964 without a revival
of inflation.
At one stage Mr Calwell started to
add up the sum, but presumably, having
spoken of £75 million for additional child
allowances, he thought better of it. In
round figures, you could easily get the
total up to £250 million. With the
multiplier working, this would amount to
an increase of about £750 million in
effective demand induced by additional
Government spending alone.
At the present juncture, as The
Bulletin demonstrated last week, all
income generators, except perhaps private
investment, are operating strongly and
even now are inducing sufficient effective
demand to hold down unemployment to
near hardcore proportion. Moreover,
there is every sign that income generation
from exports is heading for considerably
greater heights, not only through the
accretion of record export income but
also as a result of the recent Budget's
incentives to spending in the rural sector.
In these circumstances the need next
year may well be to taper off Government
spending in the interests of making more
room for private spending and invest-
ment, whereas to honor its election
promises the ALP would be obliged to
increase it.
Apart from the strongly rising move-
ment in income generation, a crucial
factor in fitting in additional Government
spending next year will be the trend of
the propensity to spend, which, even
with the present low level of unemploy-
ment, has risen very slowly this year
when prices have been relatively stable.
Sir lan Potter has already warned that
this is an unpredictable danger, which
makes it all the more important to allow
for it in calculating Government ex-
penditure. Not to do so would be to
court price increases.
With a further substantial increase in
Government expenditure on top of the
big rise budgeted for in prospect, it would
be a moral certainty that both private
spending and investment would rise sub-
stantially. The closest comparison in the
present situation is with the end of 1949,
when not only was the economy in the
process of adjusting itself to the devalua-
tion in September that year, but the
propensity to spend was increasing
strongly in anticipation of the lifting of
Government restrictions by the incoming
Menzies-Fadden Administration. When
the new Government came in, the lid was
taken off private spending.
Now an increase in the propensity to
spend might come well before prices
showed a strong tendency to rise as a
result of additional Government spending
and could prove to be the main initial
cause of them rising. That danger has
been present all through 1963, but, thanks
partly to the Government’s caution, it has
so far been averted. It is also true to
say that any increase in the propensity
to spend in the last 18 months has been
on motor vehicles, though, going by the
slow rise in other retail sales, the
mammoth build-up of savings and the
success of Government loans the upward
movement has been very marginal.
Nor could it be simply a question of
fitting in more Government spending in
conditions where other sources of income
generation are going strongly and the
propensity to spend is rising. There is
the further stimulation to incomes (and
costs) which many confidently expect to
see result from the basic wage case in
February. It could hardly be envisaged
that a Labor Government would advise
the Arbitration Commission not to
increase wages.
In looking coldly at Mr Calwell's
spending proposals, these are the essential
factors to consider —not whether he will
have any difficulty in finding the money
to spend. He expects, as he said in his
speech, to get the money from the buoy-
ancy of revenue at existing rates of
taxation. If he gets a really good inflation
going, the current level of taxation will
be high enough to bring the money in,
though on that point the bigger the
inflation the higher the cost of implement-
ing some of his proposals such as those
on education, defence, the development
of the north and so on.
The country is familiar with that sort
of spiral. But Mr Calwell has stated
before that he has no inhibitions about
increasing taxation, nor, no doubt if he
follows the theories of his predecessor,
Dr H. V. Evatt, would he be shy in
asking Dr Coombs for a liberal supply
of Treasury bills money if need be.
Mr Calwell did not canvass a Labor
Government's prospects in the loan
market, but an inflation would soon turn
people away from bonds and other fixed
interest securities. Given a strong rise
in the propensity to spend, the counter-
part of which is, of course, a drop in
the propensity to save, a Labor Federal
Treasurer could well find himself in
difficulties there.
However, even in a perfectly stable
economy Mr Holt was not without his
troubles in this direction. His last two
Budgets have been uniquely dependent
on the response of the capital market.
If this dried up on his successor, the
routes to funds through higher taxation
or Treasury bills to finance Mr Calwell’s
spending proposals would be the only
alternatives —that is, apart from putting
the economy in the straitjacket of con-
trols.
Indeed, the real sting in Mr Calwell’s
speech may lie in the ALP's deter-
mination to control the economy with the
guidance of planning boards in Canberra,
with the idea of sustaining a steady
growth rate of 54 p.c. a year through
thick and thin.
So if, as might be expected with such
a high target, prices got out of control,
doubtless they would soon be brought
into line by a new Prices Commission.
That is the logical inference which
followed the fanciful Father Christmas
line of all Labor leaders’ policy orations
since Chifley.

produced in the latest year to June its
smallest profit since going public three
years ago.
Profit fell from £29,220 to £22,106

statement that contracts in hand, valued
at £600,000, are considerably higher
than in any previous year, may not there-
fore mean very much.

pared with 16.1 p.c. in 1961-62. The 5s.

The boom in life assurance
T ife assurance offices continue to
enjoy the fruits of the high liquidity
in the economy and the rather cautious
attitude of the public about investing.
Like savings bank deposits, a life policy
becomes attractive in the type of climate
Australia is enjoying currently. And
like savings deposits, more and more
public funds are being invested in life
policies.
The figures for life assurance during
1962-63 and up to August, 1963, have
come to hand this week and give splendid
evidence that the individual life offices
in most cases will show record figures
for their respective years.
Last week the Sydney group Pro-
ducers and Citizens’ Assurance (the life
office of the United Holdings group)
reported that in the year to June 30 it
wrote policies assuring £11.47 million.
This is not remarkable in itself except
that it is a cool 35 p.c. more than the
office’s 1961-62 achievement.
Figures presented to the Life Insur-
ance Commissioner show that in 1962-
63, the 41 companies within the industry
wrote new policies assuring a record
£935.6 million —compared with £900.9
million in 1961-62, and £848.6 million
in 1960-61.
The latest record included a monthly
average of £85,684,000 new assurances
written in the first two months of the
year —July and August. Indicative of
the continuing growth of life protection
being sought by the public is the monthly
average for the first two months of the
current 1963-64 year.
The monthly average for these months,
has grown to £96,467,000 — 12i p.c. up
on the 1962-63 comparative figure.
Despite the intensive (and expensive)
efforts by the “assurance salesmen” of
the fiercely competing offices, there is
not much improvement in the spread of
life assurance throughout the com-
munity. This could well be a legacy of
the 2s. a week touch of the mass in-
dustrial policies written in the ’thirties
and early post-war years. However, it
is very noticeable that better protection
is being sought over fewer policies than
beforehand.
The figures covering total life cover in
force tend to belie that suggestion. For,
in fact, there are still something in the
order of 5,170,000 policies still current
in Australia.
The growth in the amount of cover
per policy proves one thing, however.
More people are taking greater advantage
of the taxation allowance on premiums
paid on policies (£4OO a year maximum
currently). Nonetheless the average
annual premium per head of income
earning population is still not much
above £5O, well below the full limit
allowed by the Government.
The lifeblood of the life office is, of
course, premium. And here, too, the
industry continues to enjoy a remark-
able run of records.
Premium income in 1962-63 totalled
£158,899,00 an average of
£13,242,000 every month.
In July and August this year (the only
months for which figures are available),
premiums totalling £29,801,000 were
paid on policies compared with
£26,656,000 in the same two months
of last year. So, the rich assurance
offices (mutual and otherwise) are getting
fatter at a faster rate.

Still More Bad Debts
ISTTth most of the good company
" results out of the way, the losses
now make their appearance. Many of
them were anticipated, but some are
worse than expected.
Apart from the losses in profits, the
bad debt provisions of various finance
groups now receive closer scrutiny,
particularly after the setbacks by some
of the newer factoring groups.
DEPOSIT AND INVESTMENT CO.
LTD, a financier with an excellent
record in handling its debts, caused
some surprise with the “unexpected”
need to make another large provision
for doubtful debts.
Although bad debts were reported as
written off, the “ample” provision of
£410,000 for doubtful debts at June 30
was found to be insufficient and, after
an investigation in October, directors
decided to transfer a further £187,000
from reserves to cover doubtful debts.
As a result, the current year’s dividend
will be cut from 15 p.c. to 10 p.c.
These hidden gremlins in the debtors’
ledger keep bobbing up to embarrass
even the most solid-looking financiers.
It tends to cast doubt on published
results and causes speculation on
whether further discoveries will be made
by companies which already claim to
have cut out all the dead wood.
■k -k M
Primer (Consolidated) Ltd,
Sydney-based distributor of build-
ing materials, machinery, etc., with a
clutch of subsidiaries heavily engaged
in the television servicing industry, was
forced to slice its dividend from 15 p.c.
to 13 p.c. after a drop in earning rate
from 20.1 p.c. to 15.6 p.c.
A slightly higher profit for the year
was achieved only after cutting both
depreciation and tax provisions.
This company a few years ago was
solidly recommended by security
analysts, chartists and other prognostica-
tors of growth stocks.
It continued its capital growth last
year with a one-for-four issue, but is
suffering from indigestion.
At prices down near 9s. for the ss.
shares, however, the company possibly
could be regarded as a recovery pros-
pect, assuming the bad debts position
causes no unexpected problems.
★ ★ -fc
/\nce you are down, it's hard to get a
helping hand.
A. J. BENJAMIN LTD, the Ryde
and Chatswood retailer with a sub-
sidiary at Broken Hill (NSW), has been
seeking a cashed-up marriage partner
for some years now. A few tentative
approaches were made, but the suitors
shied off.
The company —in the hands of the
Receiver since April has run up losses
of more than £600,000 for the past two
years to August and the losses are
continuing. The Receiver made an
extra provision of £175,000 for bad
debts and is budgeting for a £75,000
loss for six months to February 28.
Any prospective suitor calculating
that he would like to get the enterprise
as cheaply as possible might assume that
the longer the losses continue, the
stronger bargaining weapon he can
employ. This applies particularly if he
is interested in accumulated losses as
well as the property.
It is known, unofficially, that several
groups looked at the properties to see
if they were suitable. But there were
various problems, including one com-
ment from a property developer that
he thought Benjamin’s were competing
in an “over-shopped” area.
A. J. Benjamin shareholders, anxious
for succour, have been forced to endure
wild rumors on takeovers, but nothing
ever happened.
Interest charges on loan moneys of
more than £1 million also complicate
the situation. In the event of a forced
sale and this seems likely ordinary
shareholders would be lucky to get any-
thing out of it.
Main reason for the ss. shares holding
a price of around Is. in the market
is the hope of some takeover by ex-
change of share scrip. Anyone interested
in such a deal has had plenty of oppor-
tunity up to now, with no takers.

JJirectors of JOHN VICARS & CO.
LTD shook up their shareholders
when they reported that since July sales
and margins available to all Australian
producers of wool textiles were in-
sufficient to maintain full production.
They expect costs to rise and profit
margins to fall.
Forewarned is forearmed. But direc-
tors then say they have seen similar
conditions before and they do not view
the future with undue concern.
This seems too much of a contradic-
tion and shareholders doubtless would
like a more detailed explanation. For
example, is it going to affect the dividend
this year?
The 20s. shares are selling only
slightly above par and the directors’
candour certainly must be appreciated
by anyone who is thinking of buying the
shares.
To existing shareholders, however, the
report would encourage a sustained fit
of nail-biting .

OIL CORNER
Dragons or Oil?
T>ecause of the heavy costs involved
in planning, testing and assessing
geological and drilling information, oil
exploration of necessity must follow a
definite pattern, usually decided by over-
seas experts who fit all the information
together and examine the cores taken
out of the ground.
This explains the bald announcement
from UNION - KERN - AOG when it
abandoned the Wunger No. 1 well and
transferred to a new site, St George
No. 1, 42 miles south-west of Wunger
and five miles north of the town of St
George.
Even the phlegmatic dragons around
St George, possibly apprehensive of a
US - type investigation into fossils, are
asking why Union Oil Development
(the drilling company) didn’t stick to
Wunger instead of invading their
territory.
-After, all; Wunger had located some
oil and it is logical to conclude tfr&t
further drilling and testing would be
justified. Pondering on this, we mounted
our charger and fronted Union-Kern-
AOG’s PR man, Lindsay Campbell, and
demanded to know if his company were
searching for dragons or oil.
We also informed him testily that the
dragons’ union of St George resented
this untimely interruption at the height
of the maiden-chasing season.
He explained, patiently, that the drill-
ing programme had been planned for
months ahead and St George was the
next on the list. The fact that Wunger
had been abandoned did not mean that
the company would not go back there at
some later date. But this would be done
only after examining all the information
from the drilling programme, which in-
volves all nearby areas. It would take a
couple of months to examine all the
cores and samples sent to the USA for
analysis.
Details of stratigraphy, etc.,-had to be
pieced together painstakingly and the
clues from this jigsaw puzzle would
decide future drilling operations.
Thoroughly impressed, we went back
to our parked charger in George St.
But we wished Mr Campbell had used
shorter words. The parking meter had
expired.
★ ★ *
11/foONiE oilfield in Queensland still
seems to follow the outline origin-
ally suggested by early drilling. Three
limits have now been fairly well defined
without finding an extension of the field.
So, at this stage, it looks as if UNION-
KERN-AOG would like to find another
field to feed its newly-completed pipe-
line.
★ ★ ■K
TJlanet Oil, which made a big splash
when it came on the market with
a healthy premium for its nine million
contributing shares, is another explora-
tion company going through a quiet
period.
It may have been pleasant for “oil
millionaire” Mr John G. Fuller to have
achieved another nice little deal with
Pacific Island Mines, but Planet share-
holders are not doing so well.
It was reported recently that Mr Fuller
received 80,000 fully-paid shares and
160,000 options in satisfaction of his
£lO,OOO loan to Pacific Island Mines.
Both the shares and the options have
been selling at nice premiums.
But it’s not much help to Planet share-
Naturally, they would like to
see some action with Planet.
Much fuss was made of the big
reservoir of gas at Planet’s Warrinilla
structure in Queensland but, after sink-
ing two wells, the company’s drilling
programme is halted until studies of the
drill cores have been completed.
While Planet is “undertaking a com-
prehensive well evaluation programme
at Warrinilla North No. 1”, shareholders’
attention is diverted by the statement
that Planet will drill a well in the Otway
Basin in south-west Victoria early in
1964, either on its own account or as
a joint venture. After talk of the big
dome in Queensland, shareholders hope
this does not mean that drilling in the
Warrinilla area will be dropped.
Obviously this is unlikely at this stage.
Meanwhile, 10,000 forfeited shares
were sold at auction recently at 3s. Id.
And there is no truth in the rumor that
Planet shareholders will receive an
allocation of options in Pacific Island
Mines.
★ ★ M
T>eports that Shell and Burmah Oil
will participate in extensive off-
shore oil exploration in areas held by
WOOD SIDE and MID-EASTERN is
good news, particularly as Shell has
built up a strong reputation in recent
years for under-water drilling techniques.
Oil wells drilled into the ocean floor
now can be operated rol
and there is a growing weight of opinion
that many future oilfields will be found
offshore.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Removing Blots on Company Law
Directors are Placed on the Spot
T>y far the most important set of new
safeguards for investors in the series
of bills brought before Australian legis-
latures this year were introduced in the
Victorian Legislative Assembly. They
follow the lines of the reform proposals
agreed to by the Attorneys-General of all
States at their recent Adelaide meeting,
after close consultation with the stock
exchanges and other interested profes-
sional bodies. Similar legislation will be
introduced in other States.
While this is the most comprehensive
instalment of amendments to the Com-
panies Act so far this year, there is cer-
tainly more to come because this lot
doesn’t completely close the most dan-
gerous gap in the present Act; that is, the
absence of watertight safeguards against
the “on lending” of loan funds secured
on the assets of the borrowing com-
panies to subsidiaries and associated
companies where they may become vir-
tually unsecured.
However, the present Bill does tackle
this problem indirectly and in a number
of ways. For instance, it puts directors
on the spot in making their personal
assets subject to lien without any limi-
tation in certain circumstances, such as
when convicted of their companies
obtaining funds without reasonable
chance of repayment.
In introducing the legislation, the
Assistant Attorney-General (Mr. R. J.
Hamer) said that directors running down
companies without any prospect of
meeting their obligations had been a blot
on company law. Too often directors
had been drawing big salaries and allow-
ances up to the eve of a company’s
liquidation.
Trustees are also to be bound tighter
as well as being given wider powers for
surveillance of companies with borrow-
ings on trust.
In future, a trustee will not be able to
retire from his position unless a suitable
replacement is available. Also, borrow-
ing companies will now have to file half-
yearly audited accounts with the Regis-
trar-General, and also make direct
quarterly reports to trustees. If the
latter are not satisfied that the assets of
a borrowing company are sufficient to
discharge its debts, they may apply to the
Minister to impose on the company
restrictions such as on advertising for
deposits or loans.
The Bill also places restrictions on
“guarantor corporations” to reduce the
possibility of links in the lender’s chain
of security.
The Bill defines a guarantor corpora-
tion as one that has guaranteed or agreed
to guarantee the repayment Qf monay-
received by borrowing companies in
response to an invitation to the public.
Again, the term “mortgage debenture”
cannot be used to describe a security
unless it is secured over real estate to
not more than three-fifths of a recent
valuation, while any loan that is not a
debenture or a mortgage as strictly de-
fined will have to be classed as “unse-
cured”.
One of the main purposes of this
legislature is to ensure strict vigilance
over the destination of company bor-
rowings. If a company raises money for
a particular purpose and uses it for
something else, it will be required to
repay it.
This may be difficult enough to detect,
but even with the new safeguards in the
Bill it will be even trickier to ensure that
money spent on authorised purposes will
produce the desired result for lenders.
Honest Retailer
candid tone of Marcus Clark’s
A annual report embraces a fairly
broad range of group operations. Share-
holders should be gratified at the display
of directoral openness.
With mounting evidence also of a new-
found managerial competence there need
be no hesitation in believing that the
next five years should see “considerable
growth”. A discerning examination of
resources doubtless really discloses that
earnings are at present far below true
capacity.
At any rate, there does not appear to
be any reluctance to tackle necessary

branch reorganisation and that bugbear
of so much recent finance and retail
dealings, bad debts. It is unfortunate the
required write-off had almost to double
from £53,771 to £102;216, for the year
to August 3. Yet a ready admission, and
reform, of poor credit issue and inade-
quate collection methods promise a
thorough improvement.
Directors do not predict miracles.
They sound reliably hopeful in fore-
casting only a moderate increase in 1963-
64 profits.
Their whole attitude, however, can
compensate for the £29,706 drop in
earnings, to £167,190, in 1962-63. After
all, group sales seem to be on an upswing
despite so much structural alteration in
both main store and some branches.
Indeed, the principal (Railway Square)
shop achieved peak sales and the most
decided advance in the group, with its
modernisation programme not quite
finished.
Capital expenditure is to go on, assisted
in the current year by a forthcoming
redeemable preference issue, as well as
by long-term secured and unsecured
borrowings.
This steady attack may not sound
terribly exciting, but in the context of
the medium-sized retailers, as distinct
from the giants, it augurs a solid pro-
gress.
In the face of directors’ expectations
the markets are right in holding the ss.
shares close to 135., where they yield
3.9 p.c. with earnings yield at 6.6 p.c.
Prices have not been below 11s. 3d. this
year and their top so far is 13s. 10d.,
significantly above 1962’s 12s.
Open To Offers
Oydney retailer A. J. Benjamin Ltd,
now in receivership, incurred a
trading loss of £287,924 for the eight
months to April 30, to which the
Receiver has added extra provisions of
£209,925.
Together with an estimated group net
loss of £llO,OOO for the remaining four
months of the financial year to August
31, and the debit balance carried for-
ward from September 1, 1962, this
would make a total accumulated deficit
at balance date of £764,000.
The Receiver (Mr D. G. Davidson)
saw fit to make additional provisions
(included in the above) for long-service
leave, holiday pay, bad and doubtful
debts (£175,000) and liabilities yet to
be determined.
Based on maintenance of 1962-63
sales and the recently improved profit
margins, the Receiver estimates a net
loss of perhaps £75,000 for the six
months to February 28, 1964.
In a comprehensive report released
last week to the secured creditors (Bank
of NSW, Commonwealth Trading Bank,
AMP Society, AGC, Direct Acceptance
and Martin Acceptance), to 2200
trade creditors, 1250 7 p.c. registered
noteholders and 500 depositors, the
Receiver detailed the company’s position.
Land and buildings at Chatswood,
Broken Hill and Blakehurst were in-
dependently valued on a going concern
basis at about the same as book values,
and the stores were considered to be
mostly well equipped. But on a forced
sale, the land and buildings would not
necessarily bring book values, and the
plant and equipment would probably
involve substantial losses, said the
Receiver.
The Receiver invites proposals to
take over the group with provision to
pay all liabilities and perhaps make an
offer to shareholders, or to take over
either the assets or shares of a sub-
sidiary. This would avoid the losses of
a forced realisation.
The company ran into trouble in
1961- partly as a result of the inability
of builders to pay their hardware
accounts after the credit restrictions
were imposed, and partly due to the in-
ability of management to handle the
diversified merchandise in the face of
opposition from resourceful retailers.

£182,613, by mentioning “the lower
value of the ore mined and treated
during the year, the higher gold grade
being more than offset by the lower
grade in copper”. Income slipped from
£3,821,959 to £3,365,322.
They had earlier expected an overall
grade improvement to give a correspond-
ing increase in profitability. “However,
the expected improvement was not
realised and it is in order to meet such
conditions of low grade that the tonnage
of ore mined and treated is to be in-
creased substantially.”
Ordinary dividend has come back
from Is. to 6d. a 10s. share. As recently
as 1959 and 1960 profits in each year
exceeded £400,000 and dividends of 2s.
were paid. A decline has been very
marked from 1961 onwards.
The latest year’s payment was made
as interim only, for “having regard to
all the circumstances, it was considered
prudent to omit the dividend on ordinary
stock usually declared after the close of
the financial year.”
Recent extension of the Australian
copper bounty does not confer any
additional assistance on the larger
producers.
Mount Morgan’s shares now hover

A Healthier Ferris
HThe sharemarkets have brought Ferris
Industries’ ss. shares mildly up from
4s. 2d. to ss. 6d. this year. Present
levels represent a 1963 peak and are
actually the best for more than two years.
Prices are truly a far call from 1962’s
low at 2s. sd. The company seems
well on the path to a proper rehabilita-
tion.
For 1962-63 a 6 p.c. dividend was
paid in one amount, after a profit lift
from £26,331 to £34,289. The yield on
ruling prices is 5.4 p.c., while earnings
yield comes out at 11.7 p.c.
Directors now anticipate an interim
payment in April next. Following
1962-63’s increase in turnover by 21.5
p.c., the first quarter of the current year
has seen sales moving well above a more
optimistic budget.
The accounts are gradually getting into
better shape, though there is still a
necessary reliance upon term deposits.
Ferris has now acquired all minority
holdings in subsidiary companies.

after providing £100,292 more for tax
at £402,882, and £75,693 more for
depreciation at £326,163. The profit
was after providing £50,000 (last year
nil) for contingencies, and did not
include a capital profit of £84,052.
Confidence is the keynote of the
directors’ report which announces £2m.
expenditure on new buildings and plant
over the next two years. Expenditure in
the latest June year was £220,000.
Production in all mills was at a high
level throughout the year, and the com-
pany is planning to increase output. The

level.
The shares at 71s. 3d. are still being

Financier’s Bad Debts Shock
Chock news from Deposit and Invest-
ment Co. Ltd was that intensive
investigation of sundry debtors’ accounts
revealed the necessity for a further
transfer of £187,000 from general
reserve to provision for doubtful debts.
The provision stood at £410,000 on
June 30, 1963, after a transfer of
£lOO,OOO from profit and loss appropria-
tion. (In 1961-62 a similar appropria-
tion had been made of £157,898.)
Shareholders were given early notice
that this year's dividend will be 10 p.c.
(5 p.c. interim and 5 p.c. final), com-
pared with the 15 p.c. rate paid in the
last seven years. The 1962-63 earning
rate of 15.6 p.c. had given little clear-
ance for the 15 p.c. dividend.
Directors admitted this debtors’ adjust-
ment was “occasioned by exceptional
circumstances”.
It is understood the bad debts were
incurred in financing small businesses.
Directors advised that the company was
now entering more satisfactory fields of
lending, including mortgages on free-
hold property and bridging finance.
The company was always highly
esteemed for its conservatism. Either
this was overestimated and the com-
pany was caught out by the stringencies
of the business recession, or the com-
pany just made mistakes in the last
couple of years.
Since the end of July, the ss. shares
have tumbled from 14s. 2d. to below
10s., and they look precarious at this
level, too.
Warringah Bricks Restored
Tt was with relief that shareholders of
Warringah Brick and Pipe Holdings
Ltd heard the Company had earned
£9761, 9.8 p.c. on capital, in the year to
June 30.
In May shareholders were told that
a profit had been earned in the first half,
but no dividend would be paid. Directors
were cautioned by the stockpiling of
bricks as a result of adverse weather and
severe competition.
The company is now paying a first
and final dividend of 6£ p.c. In 1961-
62 a loss of £3890 was incurred, and
the usual 12i p.c. dividend was chopped
back to 5 p.c.
The ss. shares now sell around 6s. 6d.
where the yield is 4.8 p.c. They were
below par earlier this year.

above the level enjoyed before the
recession, but lower margins demand a
higher turnover to reach a desirable
profit level.

Freighters Afloat Again
A fter the trials and tribulations of
Freighters Ltd, the Victorian based
transporter group, in the last two years,
spring cleaning of the board room and a
general tightening up in the administra-
tion, promise better things in the near
future despite the company continuing
to be in the red in the year to last June.
It is probably time now to close the
book on the sad story of losses which
took some of the company’s officials to
court but perhaps a final word is neces-
sary since the preliminary statement is
threaded with them. The company says
that last year's loss of £41,326 compares
with a trading loss of £303,946 in the
previous year. The latter figure is in-
clusive of the £lOO,OOO overstatement
of the value of stocks in that year but
does not include the sum of £232,362
written off for obsolete stock.
It would seem therefore that the
latter would have to be added in, mak-
ing a figure of £530,023 for the right
1961-62 comparison with last year’s loss
of £41,326, that is unless the company
has still to reveal its stock losses, if
any, for the latest year.
For a verdict on that one must await
the full accounts. In the meantime in-
vestors should be heartened by the news
that in the two months to August the
company made about £30,000 before
taxation and that turnover in those
months was in excess of last year’s
rate, which was 11 p.c. up on the pre-
vious year’s.
Naturally with the group still in the
red last year there is to be no dividend.
The last one shareholders saw was in
1960-61 when 10 p.c. was paid from
12.6 p.c. earnings. Judging by the mere
half crown- price of the ss. shares the
expectation is obviously that they won't
see another for some time yet, though
with the rot removed their chances look
a shade better than even a few months
ago.
The Old Order Changeth?
HHennison Textile is probably in pro-
cess of preparing itself to take every
advantage available from the recently
forged link with the huge Japanese Toyo
Rayon Co. After last year’s disappointing
result, and indeed the past few years’


Customize is increasing
this man’s life assurance policy
That’s what we mean by “Guaranteed Insurability”!
Four years ago, at age 36, this
man took out a Customlife policy,
with guaranteed insurability.
Today, although stricken with a
heart attack, he is exercising his
option to increase his cover by
£s,6oo —the amount of his
original insurance.
It is granted without question.
Without penalty rate.
This option, unique to Customlife
Assurance Limited, is possible
only through our “Guaranteed
Insurability.” Briefly, it guaran-
tees you the right to buy more life
assurance periodically without
the need for further medical
examination —regardless of your
state of health at the option dates.
Customlife realises that one cannot
depend on constant good health, and,
realising this, provides for your protection
in the event of any illness at any time.
Let’s look at specifics:
From birth to age 40, it is possible for
you to increase the cover on your life
five times. Option dates exist at ages 24,
28, 32, 36 and 40 to increase cover by
an amount not exceeding the original sum
assured . . . which can be up to £5,000.
Thus, taking advantage of all options,
you have a maximum amount purchas-
able of £30,000, with only the one
medical examination when the initial
policy is taken out.
Even if you should delay to, say, age 35,
you still have two further option dates.
Perhaps you are thirty now; you have a
young familj',and a responsibility for
their future and your own. You can
take out an initial policy for any amount
up to £5,000, and increase it as you will
at the option dates, with no fear of
refusal on medical grounds.
The coverage, of course, applies to
women, too. The same complete protec-
tion applies to you as a career woman,
or a young wife sharing family responsi-
bilities.
This is worry-free security, enabling you
to plan for the future with a new
confidence.
You can have more specific details of
this unique Life Assurance plan by con-
tacting your nearest Customlife office
(listed below). If you have delayed buy-
ing life assurance, this may be the wisest
time for you to move. Customlife will
tailor a policy to your requirements
immediately.

oscillation in earnings, shareholders must
be expecting something less erratic.
Not that they were too badly served
for the period ended June 30. Evidently
an 11 p.c dividend rate has been estab-
lished on capital reduced by the June,
1962, return of Is. 6d. a ss. share.
Though turnover was lifted, Tennyson
became a ‘‘substantial” victim to still
another bad-debt situation provoked by
the failure of a large retail organisation
and of several long-established clothing
manufacturers. The word several sounds
a little hard to swallow. Significantly,
stock depreciation in the merchandising
section was allowed more heavily than
for some time.
Land tax went up following revalua-
tion of land and buildings, while extra
long-service leave provisions, “to cover
possible commitments under the Act,”
added to directors’ worries.
Investors will be relieved to learn that
sales and profit margins have moved
upward during the first quarter of
1963-64. The 3s. 6d. shares now stand
around ss. 4d., after touching 6s. earlier
this year.
Toyo bought a 15 p.c. interest at a
price slightly above the then market value
in September. Tennyson plans to buy
raw materials and finished cloth from
Toyo, to sell some of its products in
Australia, and to interchange staff.
Alcoa in Stride
A lcoa of Australia's new extrusion
plant at Port Henry, Victoria will
shortly be brought into commission. This
is the first of two major fabricating plants
planned at the site and will produce a
variety of aluminium shapes for use in
building, construction, transport, and
appliances. Its 2750 ton press cost
£200,000. The second fabrication plant
which will be installed next year is a
rolling mill to produce aluminium sheet,
plate and foil.
Also due for commissioning soon is
the second half of the company’s 40,000
ton smelting plant at Port Henry, the
first 20,000 tons of which started pour-
ing metal in April this year, while over
at Kwinana in WA production of
alumina at the company’s 210,000 ton
refinery is expected to start any day.
The latter is well ahead of schedule.
Rootes Nearer Ground Level
As one of the big importers of motor
vehicle components Rootes (Austra-
lia) which assembles Humber, Hillman,
Singer and Commer vehicles at Port
Melbourne, will hardly welcome Mr Mc-
Ewen’s latest reference to the Tariff
Board for it to enquire into whether
bylaw admission of components for use
as original equipment in vehicles should
be discontinued.
Roote’s share of motor component
imports, which are now running at
about £llO million a year on the latest
official trade figures, must be quite con-
siderable and the company is looking
forward optimistically to the marketing
of the new Hillman Imp with a high
import content in the New Year. How-
ever the latter should be well established
by the time the Tariff Board makes its
recommendations because it is not expec-
ted to start its enquiry for about three
months.
In the meantime Rootes 10s. shares
have been looking up in the market
since the publication of the accounts
for the year to July 31 although by the
end of last week they were still a shilling
or more below par, a figure they haven’t
seen since the 1960 motor boom when
the highest they got was 13s. 3d. —their
best since being listed in 1954.
The strong recovery from £130,156
to £198,601 in net profits after tax last
year was a good effort proportionate-
wise and it lifted earnings from 5.2 to
9.1 p.c., the second best since consoli-
dated accounts were first published in
1957, the highest of course being 13.7
p.c. in 1959-60. Even so the group has
only managed to get about 3i p.c. of
the sedan car market this year and to
make the investment pay off it will
obviously have to do better than that.
It is hoping, that this can be done with
the aid of the Hillman Imp because
this light car has been singularly success-
ful in the UK in competition with the
BMC and Volkswagen products so suc-
cessful here.
Although Rootes increased its divi-
dend from 2i to 5 p.c. this is by no
means exciting even if the second high-
est paid in the last seven years, the
highest being 5.8 p.c. in 1959-60 One
would have to be looking forward to
another doubling in the dividend in the
next year or two to justify the present
price of the shares.,
Rootes is no longer the Cinderella
of Australian motor shares, it having
bequeathed that place to AMI, but in-
vestors will want this year’s performance
to sparkle more than last year's effort
before having a ball with the shares.
Early Profit from Fiji
"Thji Industries Ltd has been able to
announce a profit for the year to
June 30, after 14 months of operations.
Profit of £22,301 (Fijian currency) is
already an attractive 9.2 p.c. on capital.
It will be used first to reduce the bank
overdraft. An interim dividend can be
expected before the close of 1963-64,
directors say in a preliminary announce-
ment.
From a capital of £243,362 the com-
pany last year had only to deduct a
small loss of £2,669. Intangibles at June
30, 1962, were £17,687 for preliminary
expenses, £11,902 for establishment costs.
The company was sponsored by CSR,
Burns Philp (South Seas), W. R. Car-
penter, Dickson Primer. DFC and others
to make cement in Fiji. Fijian residents
held 30 p.c.. of the capital at the time
of flotation in June, 1960.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Intriguing Growth of Waltons
From Cash Orders and Finance Business to Retailing
By “ANALYST”
the last two months, the ordinary
shares of Walton’s Ltd have ranged
between 17s. and 18s., or in other words
they are selling at the same price as they
were before the l-for-6 par issue last
June. This means that they have shown
an increase in value of about Hi p.c. in
just over four months and over the last
12 months of about 30 p.c.
This suggests a firm and fairly steady
upward movement in price, and now that
the immediate dividend yield is less than
4 p.c., one wonders how much longer
this movement can continue.
In 1951 Mr J. R. Walton accepted the
position of managing director of Cash
Orders (Amalgamated) Ltd on the retire-
ment of his father, Mr J. T. Walton.
Just before this, the company published
a prospectus for an issue of 41 p.c. first
mortgage debenture stock and this
document contains some considerable
detail of past history.
This particular issLie had two peculiar-
ities. Lirst, the interest rate was in-
creased in 1954, three years after the
issue, from 41 to 51 p.c., and, secondly,
the issue was one of the few issues
underwritten by Mainguard (Australia)
Ltd, a forerunner of the Australian
merchant bankers and now “deceased”.
It seems that the company commenced
as a cash order and finance business in
1927, but a reconstruction was necessary
in 1930, involving the writing off of 40
p.c. of the capital. In 1937, the present
concept of credit retailing appeared, as
a small furniture business was purchased
in the Haymarket.
the intervention of World War
11, expansion appears to have been
fairly rapid, for by 1951 the company
operated 16 retail stores and had acquired
the sites for another ten. In that year it
acquired Murdochs Ltd, near the Town
Hall, Sydney, thus obtaining not only a
city retail store but also an administration
centre for the growing group.
It is interesting to note that in the
managing director’s report in this 1951
prospectus, he drew attention to the fact
that the company’s representatives were
in touch weekly or fortnightly with
approximately 250,000 homes and that
this had been the nucleus in building up
the furniture retailing activity. This
door-to-door selling organisation is still
the mainspring of the Walton’s opera-
tion, and the methods have been adopted
by other retailers in the Sydney city area.
This potential is evidenced in retro-
spect by the following figures of “Volume
of Business” and Profit after Taxation.
Year Volume of Business Net Profit
f.,000 Index £,OOO Index
1950 5,000 100 120 100
1951 6,500 130 207 172
1952 9,750 195 189 157
1953 11,250 225 272 226
1954 16,170 323 343 286
1955 17,300 346 434 362
1956 20,000 400 481 400
1957 24,000 480 580 484
The close correlation between volume
of business and net profit is interesting
because today it is quite unusual to see
profits expanding at precisely the same
rate as sales in this type of operation.
The association with Sears Roebuck
started in late 1955 and was terminated
four years later. During this period, per
share earnings declined by 9 p.c. .and
afterwards, even disregarding the imme-
diate lift from 7.8 pence per share to 9.6
pence per share which occurred from
1959 to 1960, earnings per share have
risen by 44 p.c. over a similar period of
time.
The main problem is to ascertain a
suitable measuring stick for the overall
profitability of a complex such as the
Walton’s group. In view of the fact that
the largest single asset is “Customers’
Accounts Receivable”, one feels that
“hire purchase” company measures could
be applied. Unfortunately, the amount
of interest which has been paid in each
year is only available for three years, but
at least some indication of trends can be
obtained.

Average total assets (£,000) A 29376 33890 40175

Interest paid (£,000) D 1092 1359 1708
D p.c. C 7.67 7.64 7.67
These figures indicate that overall pro-
fitability has tended to improve while
interest charges as a percentage of bor-
rowings have remained steady. The
capital and interest of convertible notes
have been excluded from the latter rates.
With current downward pressures on
interest rates, a lowering of the average
interest rate could be expected.
Judging by the latest balance sheet and
past prospectuses, the average rate of
interest on the debentures and notes due
for repayment during 1963/64 could be
above the average rate of 7.6 p.c. As
these redemptions total over £2.5 million,
or just over 12 p.c. of the total debentures
and notes on issue, the refunding of this
amount alone could produce a savings
in interest charges.
By July 31, 1966, all the convertible
notes will have become ordinary shares,
and assuming that no further issues are
made during that period, ordinary capi-
tal will stand at £9,050,000 approxi-
mately. The 12i p.c. dividend will then
require about £1,131,000. Even the
1962/63 profit would cover this amount
1.2 times, so maintenance of the dividend
rate seems assured on the capital as
increased by the new issue last June.
TlTith the likely continuance of improv-
' ing profitability, another bonus issue
after conversion of the notes seems quite
possible. On the other hand, with the
shares currently selling to show a divi-
dend yield of 3.7 p.c., investors are pre-
sumably expecting their dividend income
to increase at an average annual com-
pound rate of about 7 p.c. per annum
over the next ten years. As dividend
income (after making appropriate adjust-
ments for the latest issue and the earlier
convertible note issue) has only increased
over the last five years at a rate of 2 p.c.
per annum approximately, a fairly dra-
matic change in dividend policy seems
necessary. Within the next ten years
dividend payout would need to increase
by 100 p.c. without the investor increasing
his investment in the stock.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Building Group’s Expansion
T)resent price of 13s. 3d. for the ss.
shares of A. V. Jennings Industries
(Australia) Ltd is roughly double last
year’s low and 50 p.c. above the 1963
low.
Investors were cautious in their
appraisal until the company reported a
strong revival in profit to £280,608, a
clear record. Tax provided was
£139,689 (up £38,000), and depreciation
£67,247 (up £8000).
Recovery in the earning rate to 25.7
p.c. from the dangerously low level of
6.6 p.c. two years previously, is an indica-
tion of the company’s regained pros-
perity. A one p.c. addition to dividend
rate gave a total pay-out of 11 p.c. for
1962-63.
The company is Victoria’s biggest
home-builder, signing contracts during
1962-63 for the erection of 1254 homes.
Private housing operations were extended
during the year to West Australia and
South Australia.
Housing accounted for 28.1 p.c. of
the group business in the year under
review, manufacturing and supply from
the 20 acre mill at Springvale (Vic.)
another 20 p.c., and general contracting
on schools, churches and the Melbourne
Cultural Centre 51.9 p.c.
General contracting was extended to
NSW during the year, and £lm. in con-
tracts are in hand. Major contracts
successfully completed in 1962-63 in-
cluded Dalgety woolstores in Victoria,
housing units for the National Capital
Development Commission in ACT,
municipal chambers in Tasmania, a
cathedral in WA, and hospitals and
schools in SA.
The group has saw mills in Victoria,
and during the year the company con-
structed 18 miles of road into virgin
forest near Mt Buller to supply the
Wansfield mill.
The group had two bad years in 1952-
53 and 1953-54, and dividends were
omitted for three years, when the Vic-
torian Government suspended housing
contracts. Although still very much
tied to the economic cycle, Jennings has
broadened its field to embrace estate
development and private home construc-
tion and more general contracting.
An associate company was formed
with Australian United Corporation Ltd
and Email Ltd, to handle finance for
home building and furnishing.
Mr A. V. Jennings, the chairman and
founder, said at the annual meeting that
plentiful housing finance and current
research into home building techniques
made an unexcelled climate for the
building industry.
“Now is a rare opportunity to lower
housing and building costs, which were
6 p.c. higher than necessary,” he said.
The first quarter of the current year
brought a 25 p.c. lift in turnover. Con-
tracts were won worth £4.2 million,
making a total of £12.8m. of work now
under construction.
If the business continues to improve
at this rate not only will the profit show
a healthy up-trend, but the company
may be looking for additional capital
from shareholders.
In December, 1960, at the same time
as Jennings announced a split from 10s.
to ss. units, shareholders were offered
six ss. ordinary units at a premium of
2s. 6d. for each five 10s. ordinaries or
five 20s. preference shares held.
By this means reserves were built up,
as shown by the accompanying table.
Any new cash issue is likely to be at
a premium once more.
Although seasonal cold winds blow
under the door from time to time, A. V.
Jennings has mostly set its house in
order, and should prove hospitable to
investors while economic conditions re-
main as they are today.

by the one-for-five bonus made in April,
1962. The issue was made by capitalising
share premiums to the extent of
£127,812.
Freehold property is still shown in the
books at cost, £934,829, so the capacity
for more bonus distributions is not ex-
hausted.
The business was founded about 1935.
The holding company was formed in
1953 to acquire the share of companies
trading in various States under the
name of Optical Prescriptions Spectacle
Makers Pty Ltd.
Primary business is the dispensing of
spectacles to doctors’ prescriptions. In-
cidental to this is the manufacture of
lenses and spectacles, and the supply to
industry of contact lenses and safety eye
wear and devices.
Manufacturing companies are located
in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and SA.
OPSM branches are in NSW (44), ACT

(3) and WA (2).
In each year since listing, sound
advances have been made in declared
profit. The latest profit of £204,562 is
£17,223 ahead of its predecessor, after
providing £1 1,593 more for tax at
£122,123, and £2,963 more for depre-
ciation at £45,196. The earning rate is
an attractive 26.7 p.c.

Not all subsidiaries operated at a
profit in 1962-63; losses of £10,864
were incurred during the year, which
were absorbed by the overall profit.
Commitments for capital expenditure
on freehold property were estimated at
balance date (June 30) to be £27,180.
The 1962-63 accounts show £60,017
in interest-bearing deposits, £135,000 in
secured mortgage loans repayable within
one year, and £9,159 secured deben-
tures repayable within one year, amongst
current liabilities. Amongst current assets
were £49,575 in Commonwealth Govern-
ment Treasury notes. Investments in-
elude £29,100 in shares in other com-
panies, and £33,104 loans on mortgage.
In November last, directors were
cheered by a reduction in stocks, and
they said the cash balances were satis-
factory and were largely required to meet
capital expenditure currently being under-
taken. The present working capital
position, however, is, as shown by the
accompanying table, the weakest it has
been at any balance date for at least the
last five years.
A share placement, if not an issue to
shareholders within the next year or so,
might be a reasonable expectation.
However, the present price, admittedly
below this year’s peak of 445. 6d., gives
an earnings yield of 15.9 p.c., and looks
very vulnerable indeed.


DODGE CONSOL. IND. LTD
Rapid Growth with Takeovers
HThree and a half years ago Dodge
Consolidated Industries Ltd joined
the Sydney Stock Exchange lists after
placement of 21 1,200 ss. ordinary shares
with the public. Capital was then a mere
£105,000. Though still relatively small by
Stock Exchange standards, paid capital
is now £483,851 since the one-for-five
bonus of last month.
At 1963 balance date, June 30, Dodge’s
capital was £395,709 supported by re-
serves of £324,091. This rapid growth
was largely by judicious takeovers in
Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth for share
exchanges which involved considerable
premiums.
The company began in NSW as a
printer and maker of cardboard boxes
and novelties. In September, 1960, Dodge
took over Carlton Box Industries of Mel-
bourne, Adelaide Fibre Box Co., and
Perth Fibre Box Co., all of which made
fibre containers.
During 1960-61 Saf-Pak Boxes (Vic.)
Pty was taken over. In March, 1963,
Sherring and Co. Ltd, lithographic and
letterpress printers of Adelaide, were
acquired for cash, and in October, 1963,
Z. Nozek and Co. Pty and Nozek
Trading Pty, color printers and record
cover specialists of Sydney, were bought
out for cash.
After last balance date, and before
the bonus, capital was increased by
£7,500 on the conversion of 30,000 ss.
6 p.c. unsecured notes which had been
originally issued in 1960 in connection
with certain takeovers.
Profit in the year to June rose from
£97,378 to £120,914, equal to a very
satisfactory earning rate of 30.5 p.c. on
pre-bonus capital. The dividend was
raised from 15 to 17i p.c., and directors
are confident of paying at least 15 p.c.
on the watered capital.
Economic restrictions notwithstanding,
Dodge was able to show improvement
each year in earning rates as well as
absolute profit. The latest profit advance
(after tax reduced from £54,683 to
£44,496 as a result of the investment
allowance) was 24 p.c.
Though it would be over-ambitious to
expect continuation of the past rate of
"rowth. Dodge should continue to set an
attractive pace, and unless it grows
rapidly it could prove a temptation lor
other larger printers and box-makers who
may have lost their generating force.
This seems to be a convincing reason,
apart from Dodge’s inherent qualities,
for staying with the company, if already
a shareholder, and the earning rate puts
the company on a more attractive invest-
ment level than staider companies in
similar fields, for investors looking for
representation in this industry.
At 225. the ss. shares yield 4.0 p.c. in
income and 6.9 p.c. in earnings, and may
not be fully extended, although a rush
at this price would not be justified by
the present position.

WHAT A SPRINGTIME
IT’S BEEN FOR
THE NINES
CHANNELS
As the year closes, each of the Channel 9’s in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane
and Adelaide has established a clear leadership in their respective markets
audience measurement surveys have established that they command far
more television viewers than their competitor stations.
That’s a grand Springtime, a grand springboard, a grand foundation on which
to face 1964, the first year in which all television stations in the four markets
may face the threat, or the stimulus, of new competition.

The group, formerly known as Reich-
hold Chemical Industries (Aust.) Ltd,
was principally concerned with produc-
tion of synthetic resins and oils and
chemical colors, in Australia and New
Zealand, under licence from Reichhold
Chemicals of USA.
From industrial chemicals it has diver-
sified, not without problems, into hard-
ware and light engineering, by the take-
over of Frank G. Spurway in November,
1959, Die Casters two years later, and
Servus Forging Company Pty Ltd in
April, 1962.
The business of Servus is closely
allied to the fastener department of Spur-
ways.
Die Casters incurred a loss of
<£17,977 in the year under review, be-
cause of intense competition and the
extremely low margins on term con-
tracts undertaken during the credit
squeeze.
Diversification of interests has also
been pursued through associated com-
panies. Hercules Powder Co. (Aust.)
Pty (with Hercules Powder of the US)
supplies chemicals to the paper and syn-
thetic rubber industry.
During 1962-63, Australian Chemical
joined with Perkins-Goodwin Co. of
New York to import and supply pulp
and papermill supplies to the paper in-
dustry.
Another hew venture is with Pacific
Vegetable Oil Corporation of USA to
grow safflower seed to produce oils for
the industrial, chemical and edible oil
industries in Australia. Safflower oil is
widely used in the industrial field to
make synthetic resins, and is consid-
ered the best for this purpose. The seed
is now being grown in the Darling
Downs district, at Biloela, the Dawson
Callide area in the central highlands of
Queensland.

Sydney has a new hotel created for your delight in the
tradition of the world's “little" hotels. It is called The
Town House, scheduled to open in December.
Not really small—its 14 storeys contain 103 rooms-
with-a-view. Large enough to provide everything you
require, from spaciousness and charming, modern
decor to instant service; but small enough to be
concerned with the individual comforts and wishes of
every guest.
The appointments of The Town House are thoughtful,
impeccable, in the manner of a fine private home.
Every room has a beautifully appointed bathroom,
individually controllable and silent air-conditioning,
television, radio, mood-music, refrigerated cocktail unit.
Less tangible but equally important assets of this
distinguished hotel include an atmosphere of quiet,
good living and a staff dedicated to your comfort.
The Town House Restaurant will serve interesting
European-American foods at sensible prices. Car
parking? Three floors of it—complimentary to guests.
Because The Town House does not have costly conven-
tion and banqueting halls or nightclubs it is able to
provide all these facilities at very reasonable tariffs.

way. Three acres of land with buildings
have been acquired half-way between
Perth and Fremantle, at Melville, to re-
house this subsidiary.
No particular reference was made in
directors’ 1963 report to the two NZ
subsidiaries A. C. Hatrick (NZ) Ltd and
Morcom, Green and Edwards Ltd. The
latter makes chemical driers and fungi-
cides. (There is also an associated com-
pany, Nundex Aust. Pty', incorporated in
NSW, in that business.)
Extra finance totalling £664,959 was
raised during 1962-63 by the issue of
1% p.c. unsecured notes to institutional
lenders.
The company last raised money from
shareholders in 1959 by a convertible
note issue. Prior to that, there were con-
current par and bonus issues, ratio one-
for-two, in November, 1956.
The group has had to adjust to the
radically different climate of business
since momentous changes in February
and November, 1960. Without doubt it
has suffered severely. The stock has
been heavily down-graded on investment
markets.
But it appears that management has
sensibly tried to plug the leaks sprung
on the manufacturing side by removal of
import restrictions by moving into im-
ports of additional products (paper), and
by branching out into engineering and
allied lines.
The market used to hold the stock in
very high regard for its growth potential
and good management. The worst must
now be over, so that the company should
not be sold short.
The 10s. shares at 20s. 6d. or there-
abouts show an immediate income of
4.9 p.c.. The earnings yield of 6.5 p.c.
is on the low side, but barring unexpect-
ed difficulties within the group, the earn-
ing rate should build up to a more re-
spectable level this year.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Something to Beef About
A David and Goliath Situation
A highlight of Australia’s performance
on export markets in the past few
years has been the blossoming of a trade
in low-quality beef of the type that ends
up between slabs of bread-roll in Ameri-
can snack bars.
Of all the meat moving in world trade
today, the United States imports 25 p.c.,
and the beef producers of that country
are not happy about it. In 1962, the US
imported more than twice as much meat
as in the period from 1956 to 1960. Most
of it came from Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and South American countries.
The United Kingdom is still the world’s
largest meat importer, but its share of
world trade has dropped from 57 to
46 p.c. in recent years. As the economic
see-saw takes the US steadily towards
the British figure, agitation grows among
American cattlemen.
Most of the protest is directed at Aus-
tralia, which, with shipments last year
of 211,454 tons worth £67,265,000, has
not only established a sizeable foothold
on the American market but is known
to have barely scratched the surface of
its potential as a beef-producing country.
In Queensland recently for a confer-
ence between American, Australian and
New Zealand meat interests, Mr C. S.
Radebaugh, president of the American
National Cattlemen’s Association, said
the US beef market had just about
reached the stage where it could not ab-
sorb larger Australian and New Zealand
imports without breaking down. Pointing
out that the US meat industry was free of
Government controls, subsidies and
“other such ramifications,” Mr Rade-
baugh said the best way to preserve the
market was by self-imposed agreement
between producers, with the aim of sub-
stituting orderly marketing for the sud-
den dumping of beef in America.
Two other US delegates at the talks,
held at Surfers’ Paradise, were no less
melancholy in a report to the American
Hereford Association on their return to
the US. They said Australian beef on the
US market remained a serious threat to
their cattlemen, and that it had forced
some ranchers out of business in Hawaii.
The Hereford Association, at its annual
meeting, agreed to ask for quotas and
higher duties on imports of foreign beef.
Said Mr Frederick Dressier, of Nevada:
“We are going to be in serious trouble
unless we regulate this thing.”
What is not emphasised in the protests
is that the beef Australia is sending to the
US is all low-grade boneless cuts for
manufacturing. America itself could sup-
ply only a fraction of its needs in this
respect, because its cattle industry, rely-
ing largely on lot-feeding and other re-
finements, is geared to the production
of the best and'costliest beef.
Ironically, the situation at the moment
has been temporarily reversed. Drought
has forced thousands of cows on to the
markets and depressed prices to the point
where, despite the entreaties of Ameri-
can importers, Australian exporters have
suspended the flow because there would
be no profit in it for them.
Regardless of how valid the American
complaints might be, US anxiety has
infected the Australian industry. Last
year the Australian Meat Board, after
discussions with producers and the trade,
agreed to retain a firm of management
consultants to survey the position in
America. After studying the report, which
one of its spokesmen last week described
as “very comprehensive,” the board sent
copies to producer-organisations and rep-
resentatives of the meat industry to
examine and deliver back their conclu-
sions.
The Minister for Trade (Mr McEwen)
recently lent support to the findings when
he said there was nothing to suggest the
American Government believed Aus-
tralian and New Zealand frozen beef
was depressing its meat markets. The
Australian Government, he said, knew
of no American action, proposed or con-
templated, to restrict imports of Aus-
tralian beef and veal, although it was
much aware of the market’s sensitivity
and the need for marketing policies that
would avoid disturbing it.
For the time being, however, it looks
as though the US market will continue to
offer our producers hospitality. In reply
to a somewhat David-and-Goliath charge
from a spokesman of the American cattle-
men that “the whole United States is
being hurt” by Australian and New
Zealand meat shipments, the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture discounted the
impact of the imports, affirming that
they comprised mostly low-quality beef
that did not compete with home-grown
roasts, steaks and other high-quality cuts.
Meanwhile, if clouds are forming on
the American side of the Pacific, the
prospect in Japan is filled with sunshine.
More Vets for Victoria
University Revives a Dormant Course
"Oefore World War 11, Melbourne Uni-
versity had a school that turned out
young veterinarians, but like Vesuvius, it
went dormant.
Recently a donation of £5OOO to the
University’s Veterinary Research and
Building Fund served as a reminder that
Melbourne University, in the production
of veterinary graduates, is again to erupt.
The donation was the second of its
size to be made by a man whose name
is associated more with machinery than
animals Mr H. V. McKay, son of
the founder of the famous tractor firm.
Mr McKay’s gifts to Victoria are all
the more generous because he lives in
New South Wales.
Supporters of the new school are
watching with pride as the girders of a
seven-storey building in Parkville, not far
from the University proper, thicken into
masonry. Already a batch of 50 first-
year students who have begun their
course in the University’s main p'remises
are getting ready to initiate the new class-
rooms when the school is opened for
occupation next May. Four women are
among them.
Staff vacancies are gradually being
filled. The first appointment, perhaps
somewhat aptly, was that of Professor
D. C. Blood as Dean of the Faculty of
Veterinary Science. The professor of
Veterinary Pathology has been appointed
and a third chair, that of veterinary
physiology, is expected to be approved
soon.
The £200,000 being donated by pub-
lic supporters is being used in the building
of the pre-clinical Centre at Parkville,
and half will be spent on research and
the purchase of equipment.
Total cost of the Parkville pre-clinical
centre will be £450,000. The Austra-
lian Universities Commission grant of
£373,000 will be used to make up the
difference.
The second leg of the project will be

SOUTH AUSTRALIA
IN THE SUPREME COURT
No. 1039 of 1962
IN THE ESTATE OF BENJAMIN ROBERT
MARTIN, late of Mary Street, Glenelg, in the
State of South Australia, Carpenter and
Joiner, deceased. NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN
that RICHARD ROBERT ARTHUR MARTIN,
a son of the abovenamed Benjamin Robert
Martin deceased and all persons claiming to
be his issue or his legal personal representa-
tives are required before the expiration of
four calendar months from the date of pub-
lication of this Notice to send by pre-paid
post to Public Trustee of 49 Hinrtmarsh
Square, Adelaide, in the said State full par-
ticulars of their claims to share in the dis-
tribution of the estate of the said Benjamin
Robert Martin deceased otherwise they will
be excluded from the distribution of the
estate. L. T. OLSSON, Deputy Master of
the Supreme Court of South Australia
NOTE: Benjamin Robert Martin died intestate
on the 2nd September, 1931. The deceased
had two legitimate sons namely James
Patrick Martin born on the 10th April, 1889,
and Richard Robert Arthur Martin born on
the 12th August, 1892. It is now desired to
ascertain the whereabouts of the said Richard
Robert Arthur Martin or of persons claiming
to be his issue or legal personal representa-
tives. The said Richard Robert Arthur Martin
left his home in Fitzroy, Victoria, before
1914. He was last heard of in 1929 in London.
Prior to that date he had been a professional
boxer and also a sailor and soldier. He had
lived or travelled in many countries in North
and South America as well as in Eneland. He
hgd assumed the name of MARTIN D.
SMITH prior to 1929 and may also from time
to time have resumed other names.
the Veterinary Clinical Centre at Wer-
ribee, 20 miles from Melbourne. This
might eventually cost more than
£600,000 and will start a-building about
the time the Parkville premises are com-
pleted.
All-told, the project will cost a million,
and will result in the training of 50
veterinarians a year to augment the 140-
odd now emerging annually from the
only other two veterinary schools in
Australia Sydney and Brisbane.
The stream of qualified veterinarians
that will soon start flowing will bring
relief to a problem that for years has
frustrated farmers, vexed governments
and their departments and over-taxed
existing officers and private practitioners.
The shortage of vets is nation-wide. In
New South Wales recently, the deputy
chief of the Department of Agriculture’s
Division of Animal Husbandry, Mr Roy
Hall, deplored the fact that although
Australia’s economy rested mainly on
rural production, veterinary services
throughout the country had been unable
to carry out all that was expected of
them, and many important projects had
had to be shelved.
But in Victoria the position is worse.
The Director of the Veterinary Research
Institute in that State, Dr E. M. Pullar,
admits farmers are not getting their full
value from the Institute because of a
staff shortage. Twelve people try to cope
with work that requires 25. Research is
confined to projects that can be stopped
and started at will, and there is time
for only the practical rather than the
fundamental. “There is a chronic short-
age of veterinary pathologists,’' says Dr
Pullar. “It takes about 10 years to de-
velop one and the only way to get them
in Victoria is to train young men.”
Ever since the Melbourne University
veterinary school folded in the early
thirties, Victorian students have had to
go to New South Wales or Queensland
to do all but the first year of their course.
In time the inaccessibility of this teach-
ing caused numbers to dwindle. Recently
only a handful each year have felt im-
pelled to make the journey away from
home.
The dairy industry has been one of the
chief sufferers from the shortage of vets
both in private practice and in Govern-
ment service in the field and on research.
The Victorian Dairyfarmers’ Association
has grown tired of asking the Department
of Agriculture to conduct research on
this or that only to be told there are not
enough vets to do it.
The same organisation has taken the
lead in raising money for the new school.
It ran an appeal in which 10s. in each of
three years was deducted from the returns
of all dairyfarmers in the State who did
not object. Fewer than one per cent did.
Dairy factories co-operated by making
the deductions and handling the money
for the association. The sum raised by the
time the appeal closed totalled about
£25,000, and since then a further
£3500 trickled in. With it the associa-
tion hopes to endow a post-graduate
scholarship. Like Mr McKay, many
graziers have also given generously to the
cause.
Even with building, staff and equip-
ment in place and a full quota of stu-
dents enrolled, the result is not entirely
predictable, for veterinarians can use
their training for non-farming purposes
should they care to defect to the com-
fort of cat-and-dog practices in the sub-
urbs.
Professor Blood hopes the wastage
can be curbed. During the handing over
of the cheque that took the fund to
within a fraction of its target, he said
that every effort would be made through-
out the course to encourage students to
continue to treat farm animals after
graduation.

Channel Country Beef Road
By MICHAEL TERRY, F.R.G.S., F.R.G.S.A.
Tt is claimed, and I think rightly, that
A the Channel Country, in the ex-
treme southwest of Queensland, is “the
largest natural irrigation area in the
world.” This year it has received prob-
ably the greatest flooding in the history
of white settlement. I have heard that
recently the waters moving slowly to-
wards Lake Eyre were 85 miles wide.
In the absence of* further immediate
rains in the catchments of the rivers
traversing the Channel Country, by next
spring waters will be confined to the
beds of the three principal streams the
Georgina and Diamentina rivers, and
Cooper’s Creek formed of the Thomson
and Barcoo rivers. With the return of
summer heat an almost unbelievable
quantity of natural herbage will appear
throughout the flooded plains.
And most of it will go to waste
because there will be insufficient cattle
to graze it. In fact, under present cir-
cumstances, it is estimated that 90 p.c.
will wither and decay uneaten.
In Queensland there are 180,000
square miles of Channel Country carry-
ing about 353,00 cattle; in South Aus-
tralia 45,000 square miles carrying about
53,000 head. But it is the section in
Queensland which concerns us primarily
as it is the first to be flooded and has the
major flood plains. They total 15,000
square miles.
The annual turnoff of this valuable
territory, on the most expert information
available, could be increased from 65,000
head to 290,000. That is, it could be
multiplied about 4i times. In terms of
money this represents an income in-
crease from £2.6 million to £lO.B
million 'per annum.
Obviously, therefore, a quick all-
weather means of speeding cattle into the
Channel Country is needed when con-
ditions warrant heavy stocking. Also
means of getting them out when carrying
capacity eases off are required and at
all times rapid transport superior to
horse-droving so that fat beasts can be
delivered to markets.
Lately a new factor has entered cattle
transport beef roads for road trains.
With Commonwealth help they are being
established in the Kimberleys, the Nor-
thern Territory and in Western Queens-
land.
With full utilisation of the Channel
Country by access for road trains in view,
a group of SA, NT, NSW and Queens-
land graziers, supported by the Shires
Association of NSW and other bodies,
formed the Federal Inland Development
Organisation at Bourke three years ago.
FIDO, as it is called, had its third annual
meeting at Nyngan recently. One hun-
dred of the 1000 individual and cor-
porate members were present. They in-
cluded Senator McKellar (Country
Party) and Mr Calwell’s No. 2 in the
ALP (Mr E. G. Whitlam) who have
been behind the movement since its in-
ception.
The meeting expressed its determina-
tion to persevere with its primary ob-
jectives a beef road from Bourke to
Wyndham (WA) and water conserva-
tion, especially along streams flowing
into the Channel Country. Dams along
the river courses, on lines suggested by
the late Dr Bradfield, could regulate
flooding, especially during lean rainfall
times.
The first objective, however, is the
Pioneers Highway to link Bourke with
Camooweal through the Channel Coun-
try. On existing tracks the distance is
1032 miles.

Artificial pacemaker offers
new help in cardiac cases
V
LUCAS ARTIFICIAL CARDIAC PACEMAKER
The development of an artificial way of stimulating the ventricle of the heart, in patients suffering
low cardiac output, has been a challenging problem for medical research scientists.
One solution to the problem is the construction of a miniature electronic pulse generator, complete
with a sealed secondary cell, which can be inserted in the chest wall of the. patient. Subsequent
developments introduced by Lucas research engineers have improved the success of the system.
The choice of Lucas Electrical Equipment for use in this Artificial Cardiac Pacemaker is a new
tribute to its dependability in a service where performance is literally a matter of life or death.
This same quality and dependability has been demonstrated in a host of other Lucas products
in car batteries, generators, starters, ignition coils —in virtually every type of automotive electrical
equipment. Look to Lucas distributed throughout Australia.
