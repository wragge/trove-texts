The Humor of Mystery
“They did not laugh at the subtleties of Shaks-
Peai'e. —Georye Hookam on the Elizabethans.
He who wrote Macbeth
Heard the windy breath
Of the world’s applause—
Little reeds and straws
Little men would blow
Through the cheerless days—
“ See how much we know!
Cleverly we praise,
Read and mark and note
Everything he wrote.”
He who fashioned Lear
Saw the morning clear
Touch the oaks of Spring,
Heard the thrushes sing
Where the fields were wide;
And the greener wood
On the Surrey side
Cried of little good
For the new day born
In the old day’s scorn.
He who made Othello
Saw the sere and yellow
Of a world grown old.
Men were bought and sold.
Only mummers kept
Something of the truth,
While cold honor slept,
And, in fretful youth,
Trade with grasping hands
Narrowed seas and lands.
Not for him the praise
Of the little days.
Born an age too late,
What were small or great
To a will confined?
Surely did he jest
When he left behind
Doubts that cannot rest....
In the days thereafter
Let the gods have laughter.

The Art of Elioth Gruner
“I love the fields and the country air,
And the sunny sky and the starry.”
— Landor.
It is a good thing for Australian art, and
for Gruner, that the sum of his achievement
should be published before he leaves us.
Like Street on, he may return with a changed
point of view, for conversions are easy on
the “old parapets of Europe.” Let us hope
he will come back with fresh stimulus to
the landscape that made him an artist in his
passionate quest of beauty and the inherent
mystery of light.
Gruner is a delicate,,,a sensitive soul. There
is something of the poet, more of the musician
in his make-up. lie has neither the robustness
of I-leysen, nor the brilliant spontaneity of
Streeton; but he possesses his own origin-
ality, for he has been true to himself and
his ideals, and shaped his vision in unmis-
takable terms of art.
Here, in the quintessence of his work,
gathered into perhaps the most charming
volume yet issued by Akt in Austkalia,
we can follow’ the course of his progress
and enjoy the beauty of his discovery.
Light!—the god of all landscape-painters
and lovers of life. I believe if again a
temple were builded to Phoebus Apollo, good
landscape-painters would hang up for votive
offerings their canvases at his shrine, and
one of the first arrivals would be Elioth
Gruner. He has faced the light so long,
analysing its mystery, that his sight has
paid tribute to his devotion. Yet he found
his originality in that untiring effort to
suggest with pigments what, I believe, it
was Wordsworth foolishly called, “the com-
mon light of day.”
The problem has fascinated painters, since
Turner set the sun in the sky, how, with
a few colored earths and minerals, to cap-
ture the apocalyptic glories of the sunset, or
the splendid oppression of nature at noon.”
Two ways are open to the artist. The old
road of chiaroscuro or the new road of
color-reaction. The first is still the best,
for it contains the surest pictorial building
material.
Turner was unaware of the violet in light.
His opposition to the living hues of the
sunset was on the side of blue. The human
eye, always accommodating, keeps pace with
acquired knowledge ; and the spectral analysis
of light, which occupied so much the atten-
tion of 19th-century science, in turn affected
painters, who attempted the interpretation
of Nature with a palette based upon its
theories.
As a means of light-conveyance it failed,
for Western art, developed from the Greeks
upon the logic of form, demands more from
a picture than color-sensation. The impres-
sionists, dropping the weight of forms,
floated in a void of color-reactions; so that
their work holds the eye captive, but for so
long—a few minutes at most—as the color-
sensation lasts. Gruner discovered inde-
pendently the violet in light, in his daily
analysis of nature, and has used it with
masterly effect. It plays with extraordi-
nary subtlety through his shadow tones, and
greets its opposition of translucent greens
with admirable courtesy. He was never in-
terested in the structure, the anatomy of
things. Caught by the emotional signifi-
cance of an effect, he strives to render it
by forgetting the bones, analysing swiftly
its values and contrasts, its silhouette and
play of shadow, and rhapsodising upon his
theme like a musician, until he has set free
its melody.
I do not mean to say that Gruner does
not-study the general structure of his land-
scape, but that he has not the draughtsman’s
love of the absolute of form. He does not
love the thing in itself, but the effect it has
upon his emotional temperament. Not the
life of the farm —the labor of men and cattle
—but the trees and meadows that dream be-
neath the light, and the cattle with gilded
flanks, and the fences that stay by fhe
weight of their masses the atmospheric
spaces of plain and sky. Not the tree, but
its “cloud”—its general shape—mingling
With the sky, a color pattern, a translucency
subtle and exquisite. Given landscape
material of the simplest, an old shed, a few
trees and a broken fence, with the light as
its angle of revelation, and Gruner will
paint a little miracle of a landscape, charged
with atmosphere and the enchantment of
his emotion.
Gruner has lived with his work and fought
its problem alone and in the open. Upon
how many chill and comfortless mornings
has he risen to greet the mystery of waking
day before even the farm was stirring! How
he has thrilled to see, above the farmhouse
nestling amidst its break of trees and the
swathe of mists upon the fields, the first
flush of dawn tinge the uppermost clouds,
loosing the bauds of night! llow often has
he waited for that slant of light across the
plains, when the long grey shadows, thick
with frost, halt upon the revelation of their
local color, and the light, edges the grass
and trees with irradiant silver! It is
Gruner’s hour. I always think of him as
one confused and oppressed % the town and
eager to escape to the open breathing-spaces
of the country. Not a cowherd at Windsor
or Emu Plains but will say to the visit-
ing artist: “Do you know Gruner? My
word, he’s a white man!” Gruner’s sin-
cerity, his unaffected charm, has left its
impress upon the simplest.
Streeton by the magic of color in full
light, Ileysen by draughtsmanship and mas-
terly chiaroscuro —he alone has set the liv-
ing sun in the sky—Gruner painting against
its source; these are our masters of land-
scape who have caught and revealed the
rapture of light. They are the true conquis-
tadors of our Golden Land.
LIONEL LINDSAY.
Morons All
The police courts are familiar with a
pathetic, though exasperating, type, who is
usually a woman, and oftenest a very young
one. She has “got into trouble” —or,
rather, drifted into it. She directs neither
praise nor blame at the author of her mis-
fortune. Occasionally she doesn’t know
him, or has no more than a vague memory
of someone she met one night, whose name
might have been Bill or again Alf, and
who suggested the deed of sin in an off-
handed manner a few minutes later and was
at once accommodated. Bewilderment, by
Evelyn Scott (Duckworth and Co.), is about
such people. They are shadowy in their
persons and in their personalities, as morons
always are: there is not one character in
this book whom the reader sees clearly,
despite the elaborate descriptions that are
provided of them. The novel, which is
laid in a middle-class U.S. environment,
might be called a record of seductions;
if indeed such a term can be applied to the
oafish w r ooing of the males and the reluctant,
not to say revolted, though immediate, yield-
ing on the part of the females. In the open-
ing chapter Julia—who has recently been
married ; who “was very fine and dainty in
her toilet,” and who “when she sat before
the glass felt a thrill she could not analyse
in the sight of her long, white hands lying
useless in her lap”—is shown on her way to
be seduced by Dudley, an artist. Arrived at
Dudley’s studio there is a good deal of this
kind of stuff: —•
All the time she felt that she loved him because
they were both suffering, and in a kind of danger
from each other which he was unable to see. She
loved him because she was the only person who
could protect him from herself. She was oppressed
by her accurate awareness of him: of his hot, flushed
face close to hers, the shape of his nose, the pores
of his skin, the beard on his cheeks, the irregular
contour of his head, matted with dark curls, his
ears that she thought ugly with the tufts of hair
that grew above their lobes, his neck, which was
short and white and a little thick, and his hands,
hairy and at the same time womanish. Already she
knew him so intimately that it gave her a sense of
guilt toward him. Her recognition of him was so
cruel, and he seemed unmindful of it.
This dummy presently shows her some
drawings—“very delicate, indicated by a few
lines on what appeared to her a vast page.”
She is annoyed by a suspicion that they are
beyond her comprehension.
I’m only fit for one need, she said to herself.
Then, aloud, “They are very subtle and wonderful,
Dudley. Much too fine, I think, for me to appreci-
ate. I really don’t want any tea.” And she gazed
at him hatefully as though he had hurt her. Feel-
ing herself so much less than he, even in this one
thing, made her hard again. She stretched her hands
up to him. “Kiss me!” The frankness and kind-
ness were gone out of her eyes. He was startled by
the ugly and unexpected look, and his own eyes
grew seysual and moist as he sank beside her on
his knees. Each found at the moment something
loathsome in caressing the other; but it was only
when they despised each other that their emotions
were completely released.
Julia has a husbaucl with “an oldish,
oblivious face which she loved for its un-
awareness,” and in a very short time, being
a true moron, she decides, apropos of no-
thing, to tell him about Dudley.
Everything - that happened was deep inside her.
Neither Laurence nor Dudley had any relation to it.
She knew herself too deeply. It was the unknown
self from which gods were made. There was
nothing to tune to. There was nothing more
to know. She watched Laurence now and
felt a foolish smile on her lips. Her hard, con-
centrated gaze noted nothing about him. “I’ve
behaved disgustingly, Laurence.” Laurence watched
her. He let his hands fall away. He wanted never
to know what she was going to say. His eyes were
on the soft hair against her cheek. He had the
impulse to kiss her there. He hated her already
for the pain of what she was taking away from him.
Some helpless thing in him wanted her, and she was
killing it cruelly and senselessly. It was monstrous
to take her soft hair and her cheek away from him.
Laurence “moves his bed into a small, iso-
lated room at the back of the house”; Julia
“applies for employment with the City Board
of Health”; Laurence pays friendly calls at
Dudley’s studio, in which he refers to his
pipe as “my unfailing refuge,” and makes
such observations as: “I won’t subject your
pictures to my bromidic attempts at analy-
sis. My appreciation of Art is limited
by my training: I’m too factual in my
approach to follow the ebullitions of
the modern consciousness.” Then Laurence’s
15-year-old daughter May (“White little
May, white like a moon. Like snow and
silence finder the trees. Snow and silence
and rest for ever and ever. For ever and
ever. Rest! Rest!”) is seduced by her un-
pleasant friend Paul, aged IS. It is the
same joyless and inconsequent affair as that

of her stepmother with Dudley; and the
centre of interest shifts to one Charles Huis ,
a middle-aged business man, who drinks, ana
who decides to seduce Julia. . Of course he
succeeds. They go for a drive togethei.
“I think I could live in you— through you—if
you’d let me, Julia.”
“You don’t know me.”
“How can I if you won’t let me, Julia.
He drew the car nearly to a standstill. He grasped
her fingers with his free hand. “I’m going to kiss
you, dear.” It was lonely here. She felt his mouth
over her face, and was ashamed of her distaste for
him.
In the last chapter Julia seduces her
incredibly futile husband (“He was weeping
through his fingers. She pulled them apart,
and pressed her lips to his face and his closed
eyes”), and the reader is left with a vision
of him dragging his bed from the back of
the house to the front, and preparing to be
lacerated by more confessions, as the lady
presents herself to one detestable and de-
tested family friend after another. The
writer of this pretentious nonsense has been
compared by one London critic to Dorothy
Richardson, and by another to Zola. It is
a good example of the blasphemies which are
committed in the name of urbanity by Eng-
lishmen who are literate enough to know
better. A juster comparison would be with
one of those works of unveiled pornography
which are retailed in Paris for the benefit
of British tourists; only in the Parisian
works the English is usually better.
More Verse
The Leafy Bliss, by Robert Crawford
(“The Bookfellow,” Sydney), is a little book
of verse reflecting many moods and half-
moods of a man who has a feeling for simple,
natural things. That is not to say that he
himself is always simple and natural; but
in this collection of his work there is occa-
sionally found a grace of delicate expression
which charms by its freedom from all deli-
berate artifice. On the other hand, there
are a good many obvious attempts to secure
effects by creating an appearance of the fine,
careless rapture which is not there. It is
difficult to see why. anyone should give a
separate name to a single stanza like this: —•
On the sweet water’s breast
The fading hues of sunset sigh.
As might a bevy of bright nymphs addrest
To sleep in languor lie.
The distinction of separate space and title
thus given to a rather commonplace remark
stated with a certain metrical clumsiness is
characteristic of the book as a whole, and
shows the author’s limitations. Many of
the pages suggest a series of small flashlights
on scenes that are far too familiar for such
treatment. Where we have looked so often
through great windows in the sunlight it
seems hardly worth while to specially strike
matches that we may get an extra peep in
the hours of darkness. Take a few ex-
amples :
His body in the wind and wet,
Hers in a cosy-covered room— ■
To-night so far apart ; and yet
Their souls are one until the doom.

Who to Gallipoli bequeathed
The freedom of their clay.
* * *
As a star that burns to dust
Within the sky is tombed,
The loving heart unloved at last
Is self-consumed. .
* * *
The last spar dips—the ship is gone!
Only the ocean bare and wide:
So love in life’s oblivion
Dares to abide.

She loves him —love is in her eyes,
But he is blind, or will not see:
And all the songs of Paradise
Grow mute in her virginity.
All the stanzas quoted are printed as sepa-
rate poems—each with a title of its own.
But what is to be thought of another which
bears the name “Haikai”? —
Daffodils dancing
To the Dawn on the hilltops
O Vision of Spring!
Only that and nothing more! Robert Craw-
ford is not fair to himself when he does that
sort of thing; for, in spite of all affectations,
he has a good feeling for words, an ear for
rhythm and an occasional small song which
he sings trulv and well. Here, for instance,
is the piece entitled “Strange Eyes” :
Strange eyes that hurt my heart,
Ye sleep now, folded so.
Death has a curious art,
Strange eyes that hurt my heart!
The old, old love will smart,
The old, old tears will flow:
Strange eyes that hurt my heart,
Ye sleep now, folded so.
And again:—
Vine-shoots and honey.
Wild bees and thyme,
The poet’s money
Is a rose and a rhyme.
Whate’er with a rose
Or a rhyme he buys
Is a joy that grows
In a dream that dies.
His dream-day closes
Upon a rhyme,
The last of his roses
Fades with time.
And here is a sonnet which, if not all that
a sonnet might be, is exceedingly pleasing: —
My heart is singing, and my spirit sees
The towers of Heaven, the pinnacles of God. ...
O come up hither where but few have trod !
Stand with me on this height amid the trees
And listen how the leafy melodies
Enchant the morning! Angels may be here,
As they of old in vision did appear
And strangely spake with men in hours like these.
Joy of the heavens! and —0 human eyes
That through the greenery peer—on this new day
The rosy airs make music as they rise.
And the heart thrills, as if on fairy feet
It wandered from the world far, far away
Into a region where the dreamers meet.
That has the feeling in it and the music;
though “listen how” is not an attractive
phrase and three rhymes to the octave is
hardly fair when the prominent one of the
three’carries the weakest vowel sound. The
thought also appears to falter just at the
point where it should soar. The “region
where the dreamers meet” looks rather a
poor sort of place after the suggestion of
speaking with angels ; and the heart wander-
ing on “fairy feet” is a come-down from the
high singing heart among the “pinnacles of
God.” Still, Wordsworth often accomplished
just the same sort of descent without losing
the love of his readers; and it is possibly
justifiable as representing the fading ecstasy
of the singer who cannot stay in the high
places too long. Possibly, also, that sonnet
is the full measure of Robert Crawford. The
little hook contains nothing that is ignoble,
much good singing and an occasional glimpse
of the sky above the “leafy bliss.”
The Spirit of Matthew Arnold
In a letter to his sister, Matthew Arnold
recounts that Beaconsfield told him to his
face that he was the only living English-
man who had become a classic in his own
lifetime. It is interesting to see, at the
present moment, why he achieved such fame,
for a hundred years had passed last Christ-
mas Eve since Matthew Arnold was born to
his stern schoolmaster father at Laleham,
and learned fountain-pens are probably un-
screwing on the other side of the world to
assign him his rightful place among the
immortals. He will hardly go in the first
rank. Even his most ardent appreciators
and biographers hesitate to call him a genius,
in spite of occasional fine gleams of poetry.
To most of us he is remembered as the
writer of the now threadbare lines on Ox-
ford :
And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,
She needs not June for beauty’s heightening.
Here he was on his happiest ground. He
knew and loved the mellow English country-
side full well, and otherwise unremarkable
poems linger pleasantly, for such stanzas
as
Grossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,
Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet
As the slow punt swings round.
Emotionally, however, he fails almost
every time. He has a pathetic, haunting
cadence in “The Forsaken Merman’ which
clings to the memory :
Call her once before you go.
Call once yet,
In a voice that she will know,
Margaret 1 Margaret!
Children’s voices wild with pain.
Surely she will come again!
In “Thyrsis,” he challenges direct compari-
son with Shelley and Tennyson, but Ins
monody falls badly. Occasionally there is
a thin note of pathos: —
Next year he will return,
And we shall have him in the sweet Spring days.
But for the most part it is a respectable sor-
row, wildly foreign from the beating spirit
about which he wrote it. “Tristram and
Iseult” might be any suburban love affair.
When liustum weeps over the son whom
he has killed, he sighs:—
Oh, son, I weep thee not too sore;
For willingly, I know, thou met’st thy end.
Put this alongside David’s lament for Absa-
lom, and you will see when prose can be
poetry and poetry nothing at all. Again,
set; his “Requiescat” beside that of Oscar
Wilde, and see where lies the tragedy.
Arnold’s main fault was a too-senous
appreciation of his art and his purpose. He
did not pipe because he must, but because
he lived in a carolling ground. His own
definition of poetry precluded any spon-
taneoua song. “It deals with and describes
actions, the greater and nobler the actions
so much better the texts of the poems.” But
poetry is such a wanton minx that she will
not live up to these high principles, and pre-
fers to coo in the arms of less worthy
lovers. Arnold, however, soon permitted
himself to become dumb before the music
of Browning, Tennyson and Swinburne.
Criticism became his. new love, . and in it
he achieved a certain well-merited fame.
His knowledge of French and English litera-
ture was wide, and there was no one of his
own time of whom he did not treat. He. is
responsible for the most illuminating criti-
cism of Thomas Gray in the English lan-
guage, and Arnold’s own spiritual kinship
with Wordsworth makes him a keen and
kindly commentator. He is less fortunate,
however, in his dealings with the pure
romantics of his day. His own rigid moral
code made him disapprove strongly of Byron,
while of Shelley he writes: ‘All his per-
sonal charm cannot hinder us from at last
discovering in his poetry the incurable ivant
in general of a sound subject-matter and the
incurable fault in consequence of insubstan-
tiality,But then Arnold came of a
family of schoolmasters. It is hardly
worth while to speak of him as a
practical reformer, as an educationist or
as a religious teacher. The problems with
which he grappled have faded in the. last
five decades, and are no longer intelligible
to us. Similarly, the skill as a phrase-
maker which won him fame through two
continents has lost its. point with the death
of the subjects on which his caustic tongue
was used. He is to be remembered best as
critic and a little as poet, but principally
on his own conception of himself : “My poems
represent on the whole the main movements
of mind in the last quarter of a century.
It might be fairly urged that I have less
poetic sentiment than Tennyson and less
intellectual vigor and abundance than
Browning. Perhaps I have more of a fusion
of the two than either of them.”
Seldom has there been a writer so alive
to his own deficiencies and so just a critic of
himself.
G. A. COLLARD.
A Satchel of Books
To Tell You the Truth, by Leonard Merrick
(Hodder and Stoughton). Merrick, for years unde-
servedly neglected, was pushed into comparative
popularity by the brotherly act of a dozen of Eng-
land’s best-known writers, who contributed each a
preface to one volume in a uniform edition of his
novels. He repays them with a new hook of brilli-
ant short stories, which this page heartily recom-
mends. 7
Du-st of the Dawn, and Other Stories, by Gladys
St. John-Loe (Duckworth). Eleven short tales, most
of "them reprints from the Premier magazine. Bitter
little studies most of them, but some of the situa-
tions have a good deal of power, and at no point is
the reader’s interest likely to wander afield. In
the mass they show honest work, and the author
may be expected to develop well, provided her
cynicism doesn’t lead to literary dyspepsia.
Drawn at a Venture, by Fougasse (Methuen),
A big volume of characteristic pen-and-ink sketches
by this impish humorist, who has in the last few
years imported many chuckles into London Punch.
A. A. Milne in a foreword knocks on the head the
general idea that “Fougasse” is a Frenchman. He
is Kenneth Bird, of Inverness, and he took to draw-
ing for Punch in hospital alter being badly smashed
when a sapper subaltern on Gallipoli. Thus, Johnny
Turk’s bullet robbed the world of an ordinary
engineer, but that it gave in place a fine black-and-
white man is strikingly proved by the hundred or
so drawings in the present book.
With the 15th Australian XI, by Sydney Smith,
jun. (Kibblewhite and Co., Sydney). A long and
lavishly illustrated record of the Australians’ last
cricket tour of Britain and South Africa. Smith
writes, easily and interestingly, allotting much space
t,), the social side of the trip, and his yarn should
be read by everybody fascinated by the “grand old
game.’’ The scores and elaborate averages at the
end of the volume will be of enormous charm
to those who revel in the arithmetic of the sport.
The biggest drawback, however,' is that the format
is tpo small, thus severely reducing the size of the
illustrations, whilst the cover, showing a spray
of wattle around a silver cup, is suggestive of a
seedsman’s catalogue.
Hawaiki, the Original Home of the Maori, by S.
Percy Smith, F.R.G.S. (Whitcombe and Tombs). The
fourth edition, with much new matter added to what
was already a very formidable collection of material
concerning the history of the Polynesian race. The
author develops the theory that the Polynesians
sprang from India —the original Hawaiki —that there
were other Hawaikis, including Java, and that the
last of them was the groups of islands round Tahiti,
whence the colonisers of Maoriland sailed, some
of them calling in at Raratonga on the way. Mr.
Smith draws copiously upon legend, tradition and
the minds of ancient natives, whom he has sought
out in Maoriland and elsewhere, and as a result his
book, apart altogether from the question as to the
original home of Henare’s forefathers, becomes one
of fascinating interest.
Fought and, ]Von,‘ by John Lewis (W. K. Thomas
and Co.). When at 80 a hard-living, hard-working
pioneer of the back country sits down to reminisce
for the pleasure (and perhaps profit) of his chil-
dren and grandchildren, the critic is disarmed. Four-
fifths of the book is devoted to the writer’s wan-
derings in Australia, mostly with cattle and sheep,
prior to 1876 ; after that he married and settled
down near Adelaide, helped to build up the firm that
is now Bagot, Shakes and Lewis, became an M.L.C.,
and reared a useful family, which includes the
present general manager of the Broken Hill Prop.—-
that one was named Essington after his father’s
old camp on the northernmost point of the N.T.
The book has no literary graces, and a good deal of
it will be found rather tedious by those who have
no personal interest in the strenuous old pathfinder.
The Glimpses of the Moon, by Edith Wharton,
(Appleton). The story of a pair of “well-bred”
and moneyless young, Americans who, on her plan,
get married with the idea of enjoying life for a
year, on the definite understanding that whenever
either; gets the chance to do better he or she shall
be immediately released. She reckoned they could
live for the year on their wedding-present cheques-
and in houses that would surely! be lent them by
their friends. “People are always glad to lend
their house to a newly-married couple,” she says,
“Such fun to pop down and see them; makes one
feel romantic and jolly.” One place is placed at
their disposal by a lady who goes off on a holiday
with a tertium quid, and the “heroine” undertakes
to post a batch of letters, one at a time, to the
unsuspecting husband to make it look as though liis
errant spouse were still at home. This particular
episode proves too much even for the stomach of
the heroine’s husband and leads to the complications
that make up 4he story. The book is written with
all Edith Wharton’s skill and keen characterisation,
but they are an unedifying, over-sexed crowd she
depicts, and the whole thing leaves a nasty taste
in the mouth. The people, the story, the atmosphere
—none of it is worth the craftsmanship put into it.
In and Around Yunnan Fou, by Gabrielle M.
Vassal (Heinemann). Yunnan is Australia’s nearest
neighbor among the provinces of China. Occupying
the very mountainous country east of Burmah and
north of Tonquin, with Thibet to the north, its
population is a weird assembly of types, some of
them picturesquely primitive. For example, the
Kou Tsong, or, as the Chinese call them, “the
Stinking Barbarians”—people among whom the
Lrothers of a family all take the same wife, and
introduce No. 2 only when No. 1 proves barren or
has given the family six or seven children. Some
cf these tribes have been implacably hostile to the
Chinese, and have waged wars against them with all the
refinements of kultur. As late as 1873 “Fu Si had the
corpse lof the Mussulman rebel general] decapitated,
and sent the head, steeped in honey, to the Ministers
at Pekin. In order to get rid of the other chiefs
Fu Si invited them to a great banquet and at a
signal had them all decapitated. Then, to prevent
mischief, he ordered the extermination of the inhabi-
tants of Tati Fou. The number of the victims is
estimated at 30,000.” To prove Ins thoroughness
lie is said to have sent to the capital the heads of
17 of the most illustrious chiefs, and “24 large
baskets filled with human ears sewn together in
pairs.” The ear-lopping industry has flourished less
since the French, under agreement with the Govern-
ment, pushed up a very wonderful railway from
their thriving colonies in Indo-China; but commer-
cial progress is not rapid, and the mines have given
more promise than performance. There is much
interesting matter about the life and customs of this
almost unknown country ; but the pleasure of read-
ing it is marred by the atrocious printing —done in
Germany, evidently, by people who know little or
no English.
Cytlierea, by Joseph Hergesheimer (Heinemann).
Cytherea is the name given to a French doll, pur-
chased by Lee Randon, because it expresses some
indefinable quality of seduction that helps him to
forget the dulness of his wife, Fanny, and their
numerous, friends. Going on a delicate mission
to Savina Grove, who is bothered by a tame hus-
band, - Randon discovers that Savina is Cytherean
in quality, and in the delicate minuet style in which
Ilergesheimer’s types approach a passion, they slip
into a decorative adultery. After that they elope
to Cuba, where she dies in unconvincing circum-
stances, and Randon is left on a sugar plantation
reciting his attitude to life and women to a hard-
headed brother who appropriately falls asleep. The
story is not a success, but it is beautifully written,
and there is one passage telling how Savina visited
Randon in the middle of the night which is on a
higher literary plane than anything Robert Keable
has done. One extract: —
“There wasn’t a sound, a flicker of audible move-
ment, a break in the curtain of dark; yet he was
breathless in a strained, oppressive attention. It
was impossible to say whether his disturbance came
from within or without, whether it w <s& in his
pounding blood or in the room around him. Then
he heard a soft, thick, settling rustle, the sound that a
fur coat might make falling to the floor; and,
simultaneously, a vague, slender v'hiteness appeared
on the night. A swift conviction fastened on him
that here "he had been overtaken by fate; by what,
for so long, he had invited. Out of the insubstan-
tiality a whispering voice spoke to him. ‘Lee, where
are you ? It’s so cold.’ ”
“J.H.” (London) : The “Ulysses” of James Joyce,
possibly the most pornographic book in literature,
and so nakedly obscene that even its author wasn't
game to circulate it publicly., has just come in
for sonie scathing comment from Alfred Noyes, in
a paper published in the Transactions of the Royal
Society of Literature. “The ‘Ulysses,’ ” writes
Noyes' “I say without hesitation, and without the
slightest fear that anyone who haS seen it will dis-
agree with me, is the foulest hook that ever found
its way into print... .there is no foulness conceivable
to the mind of madman or ape that has not been
poured into its imbecile pages. In itself it can
do little harm because the police are, on the whole,
circumventing our pseudo-intellectuals; but what
concerns us all, and most urgently demands con-
sideration, is the appalling fact that our metropolitan
critics should have treated the works of Mr. Joyce
seriously as works of genius at the very time that
some of the noblest of our literature is being treated
with something like contempt.”

When the selection of a car is tempered with
logic the deciding factor is economy.
Chevrolet offers all that motoring enjoyment
calls for by way of dependability, perform-
ance and equipment. Chevrolet upkeep is
marked for its low costs in petrol, oil and
tyres. Chevrolet comes at a price exception-
ally low in comparison with its value.
It is only natural, therefore, that over three-
quarters of a million Chevrolets should have
been sold to date, and that it should be the
world’s most popular car in the “fully-
equipped” class.

What is the
the incomes
specialised
matter with
of men of
training ?
AT a convention of engineers this question was
asked very earnestly; and most of one session
was devoted to its discussion.
Confidential data had been secured for the
convention from 225 representative engineers; 18
of the 225 were in their first year of engineering
experience; 15 had had 2 years; 13 had had 24
years’ experience; one 27 years; one 30 years;
one 3 1 years. The others were distributed fairly
evenly from the standpoint of experience over the
intervening years.
And the problem that disturbed that confer-
ence was this:—
Why should the men of 1 0 years*
professional experience be earning
less than twice as much as the men
who had graduated only 12 months
ago?
Why should the men of 20 years’
professional experience be earning
less than twice as much as the men
with two years’ experience?
What is the matter, in a profes-
sion, when years of loyal service and
matured experience count for so little
in financial return?
Perhaps these 24,000 Managing Directors
Can Answer.
THE experience of the Alexander Hamilton
Institute may perhaps throw an interest-
ing light upon this problem.
The Institute was founded 1 3 years ago by a
group of business leaders, who recognised that
modern business was tending to develop specialists
rather than to train executives.
The Institute has only one Course; its appeal
has been always to mature men, busy men (more
than one-third of them college graduates), men
who had already made a favorable start in their
chosen field.
Of the 200,000 who have enrolled in its
Modern Business Course and Service, 24,000
have been heads of companies. In this fact lies
some part of the answer to the problem that has
puzzled many thoughtful technical men.
The man at the top must know something
of everything.
THESE 24,000 company directors have
reached the head of their companies in
various ways. Some were chemists, some
salesmen, some accountants, some engineers.
But each of them added to his knowledge of
the particular department of business in which he
had served, a working knowledge of all the other
departments.
Each of them has under him department
heads who are better specialists in their respective
lines than the managing director will ever be.
But the director knows enough of each depart-
ment to direct the head of that department, and
to correlate its efforts with the efforts of all the
others.
“The man at the top must know something
about everything”—so a successful executive has
expressed it. It is men of this type that the
Modern Business Course and Service is designed
to produce; and to such men (rather than to
departmental specialists) the highest salaries in
business are paid.
Will you spend an evening with the facts?
OF the men enrolled in the Alexander
Hamilton Institute, one in ten is a man of
technical training. The Institute likes to
direct its appeal to such men. They are trained
to think; they are not easily over-persuaded.
They like to get the facts, weigh them, and
decide for themselves.
To make the facts easily available the
Institute has attempted to answer all the ques-
tions which a thoughtful man would be likely to
raise, in a booklet entitled
“Forging Ahead in Business.”
JUST what the Modern Business Course and
Service is and does; just how other men in
hundreds of different businesses have used
it to promote their own advancement—this is
contained in “Forging Ahead in Business.” It is
a book worth adding to any business library.
For your convenience in sending for your copy
of the book a coupon is attached.

The Way of Salvation.
God sent four angels to uphold a man.
The first strode armed with lightning at his
side,
Pricking the point of honor in his pride;
The second nimbly in his pathway ran
Bearing a light that his swift eyes migh'
scan
The footprints of the years where roads
divide;
The third, behind him lingering, softly sighed
A caution to each step ere it began.
But the fourth angel went on outspread
wing,
Always, above his fellows, winnowing^air
Of easy laughter. So the man was whole
In spite of caution, knowledge and the sting
Of lightning in his blood that bade him dare.
A sense of humor saved his striving soul.

I found love in laughter
That ran through the flowers,
Though sorrow came after,
I found love in laughter,

And freighted bees winging
To honey-sweet towers!
Though sorrow came after,
One silver-shod morn,
I found love in laughter,
Though sorrow came after,
To the notes of a horn
A snail elf was twirling
While poppies were curling
Bed mists through the corn.
I found love in laughter.
With scarlet lips curled,
Though sorrow came after
I found love in laughter
That girdled the world.
The full earth in leisure
Lay pillowed in pleasure
Where lush grasses swirled !
I heard love in laughter,
Like some golden gong,
Though sorrow came -after, •
I knew love in laughter,
One starlit night long,
When blue waves were dancing
And beetles’ wings glancing
And the moon a white song!
Though sorrow came after,
I found love in laughter!

When night-time comes and baby is asleep
And memories their mystic fancies weave
About the hearth where now I sit alone,
I play an age-old game of make-believe.
I wear that primrose gown you alway#
loved,
That satin girdle. I take down my hair,
And try to picture you with pipe and book,
Deep in contentment in your easy-chair.
And when the lamp burns down and round
the room,
Only the flickers of the firelight play,
I tell you of each daytime happening,
And all the new words baby found to say.
Your slippers? They are at the fender-bars.
The supper-tray! Ah, it is set for two,
And I who nightly delve in make-believe
Grow hourly nearer God and nearer you.

The Wind in the Room.
Within a stately room I sat,
And they I thought loved me;
With talk of this and talk of that,
The hours sped carelessly.
Without the wind made woeful sound.
We heard but gave small heed,
For here were warmth and rosy lights,
And all that one might need.
Somebody asked dark Genevieve
To play; she struck a chord,
When all the air was drenched with sound.
Hark ! How the wild wind roared !
The music grew, the wild wind raged.
It burst into the room,
Enwrapping us and all therein
In folds of velvet gloom.
We shivered and the roses paled
And drooped. Ah, we were cold!
The icy wind blew over us
From places far and old.
Silent we stayed nor lifted voice,
Scarcely, in truth, drew breath.
It seemed that Life had passed and we
Dreamed in the Halls of Death.
Borne on the shoulders of the wind,
Darlc-shadowed with despair,
I saw young faces, weary, wan,
That once were deemed so fair.
So sad it was. Ah, me, too sad!
So chill it was, I prayed;
Not to a saint in Heaven, but
I knelt to her who played.
She heard, the music died away,
The wind dropt sobbingly.
I looked to those I loved, and they
Smiled as they turned to me.

THE TWILIGHT OF STATE SOSH.
When a member is elected, on>!sQme sec-
tarian ticket or other, by a dry-farming con-
stituency far inland, the fact doesn’t fit him
to manage the Commonwealth mercantile
fleet, in which some £14,000,000 of Aus-
tralia’s public loan money is said to be in-
vested, but the misfortune is that it legally
qualifies him .for the position. There is no
educational test for members, nor for Min-
isterial heads of Commonwealth fleets, what-
ever may be for the heads of private
fleets. The elector is forced to choose his
rulers from the mass of electors without
guidance, though he isn’t driven to select
his solicitor or barrister or dentist or priest
that way, nor is even his horse left wholly
without guidance in its choice of a vet. when
it throws out a splint. At one time,
despite this casual w r ay of doing things,
Public Enterprise was about the cleanest
affair Australia possessed, but that was be-
fore machine politics reached their present
stage of perfection. Now, in two States,
decent but' despondent ‘people regard it as
mouldy, foul and incux*able, and where it
hasn’t actually got down to the status of a
steady robbery it has become a steady dis-
appointment and an almost invariable loss.
This is because the sectarian politician from
the dry-farming country can’t ‘ manage ShipsJ 1
yet jt would be an outrage on the clumsy
constitution to appoint a real boss—not a
wort of head clerk under the politician—
whose sole qualification was that he knew
all about ships. Public ownership, excspt
possibly of utilities that are essential for
national defence, exists solely that the pro-
fits may go to the community. When there
are no profits, and not the least visible pros-
pect of any, the whole question is due to be
opened up afresh. It calls still more loudly
fpV re-consideration when the community
owns no Public Enterprise whatsoever save
by a lying and hypocritical fiction, every-
thing down to the last nail and splinter
being really the property of preference share-
holders, called bondholders, whose cumula-
tive preference dividend not only devours all
the earnings, but levies a heavy tribute on
the nation, just like an established church
or an old nobility or a royal family. Add
to this that the State loses very large
revenues in a way that is not apparent —its
enterprises, save an occasional honest speci-
men like the Maoriland Life Department,
being almost wholly exempt from, .taxation.
This fs on the specious plea that'it 'Would
be comic opera for a man to tax himself for
his own profit, but it gives a false view of
the situation, and puts a bogus halo round
the incompetent. Also, it establishes the
curious situation that, if everything was
nationalised in accordance with the pro-
gramme of our local 0.8. U. enthusiasts, there
would be nobody to pay taxes, and no revenue
at all —only losses. Add that the nominal
owners who don’t own—the public—have
no voice in the management of their banks
and ships and railways and docks, except
that they may, once in three years, vote for
O’Smitu because of his views on the Irish
question, or against McJones on account of
his anti-liquor crajfe, which isn’t a tithe of
the control that the owners of a private bank
or mutual assurance society possess. Add,
again, that they can often get no access to
the balance-sheet. Add, finally, the gang
of political hangers-on and parasites who
swarm round the minor State enterprises
nowadays like Hies round a carcase—in fact,
many of them were created solely for the
flies —and it is a dismal picture.
* * * *
Monarchies have gone, not because there
is anything inherently wrong in kingship,
for the perfect king is an ideal, but because
some line like the Roukbons or the Roman-
offs had made the situation impossible.
Republics have pegged out. as did those of
Rome and Roland, not because republicanism
had ceased to be the best form of govern-
ment, but because almost anything seemed
better than that incurable kind of republic.
Even cows have been shifted, not on the
ground that steak is bad, but because cer-
tain cows were worse. That is about
the situation as regards State Socialism in
Australia, or a great part of Australia, and
(of late years) in N. S. Wales particularly.
There is nothing amiss with the principle,
but the .practice is incurable and beastly,
likewise abominable. Between 30 and 40
years ago, -when State ownership was on a
very small scale even in the most advanced
States, and when it was still more of an
accidental habit than a fixed principle, quite
a fierce controversy arose re Public as against
Private Enterprise. On the evidence as it
was then the former won by a large majdS
l'ity. On the evidence as it is to-day it would
probably have been hanged out of hand. But
in those not-very-remote days:—
The people hadn’t realised that they were never
intended to really own a vestige of the works that
they called theirs. Taking things as they came
they failed to fully assimilate the -fact that the
assets were to belong in perpetuity to the cumula-
tive preference creditor or landlord. That person,
who has no responsibility for repairs, and who takes
none of the ordinary business risks, has lately been
charging as much as 64 per cent, on the value of
his property. The community isn’t so much his
tenant as his serf, having no legal right to quit. If
this is public ownership, then Uncle Tom owned
Legeee, and the Russian moujik possessed the Grand
Duke.
The people had yet to learn that State “pro-
prietorship,” or what went by that name, was to
be used, at a cost rising to 6J or more per cent.,
to prevent the progress, development and enrich-
ment which private ownership, costing the commu-
nity, perhaps, SJ or 4 per cent., has sedulously fos-
tered. In N. S. AVales especially the business of
State Socialism is to prevent Private Enterprise
making half-a-dozen good harbors accessible and use-
ful, and at the samo time to leave the work undone
itself.
The people hadn’t yet dropped to the fact that,
in the name of that outrageous lie, State Owner-
ship, they would lose the ownership of a multitude
of things which, in any ordinary, conservative, Pri-
vate Enterprise and Anti-Sosh country, would belong
to them as a matter of course. At first a decent
effort was made to borrow only for ‘‘permanent
and reproductive works.” But Mn the dayS. when
George Reid was Premier, N.SAV: led the way in
borrowing for bridges, -'roads, hedges, ditches,
crockery and such-like, These-things were
in among the railway loans, and in countries where'
Private Enterprise makes the railways .there are. no'
such loans to, disguise such- swindles with, . Aus-
tralia, with its inane-babble of Public '-‘Ownership,
doesn’t own i,ts railways, tramways, (barring, per-
haps, those otV Melbourne), telegraphs, .telephones,
ships, soldiers’ homes and the great, bulk of its
irrigation works, water-works, sewers, Darling Har-
bor resumptions, etc. The.cumulative preference land-
lord possesses them alb ' The- very limited morality
of these matters was used as-a cover for worse ones.
Australia pays rent to private capitalists, .who, are
mostly outsiders, for lighthouses, Government artesian
bores, bridges, punts, wire-netting,, abattoirs, schools,
trawlers, fish-shops, crockety and roads. It even
pays: a. jriost exorbitant rent for the surface of the
Parramatta (X.S. \V.) -road, which is foreign pro-
perty, though thigffeite owns .thg,,»nciqnt Underneath
part. The.; mosj;;.(graded Ministry the
State bbrrovVW'the skimpy surface
at a figut^ 1 which should have made as many miles
of new railway in tfie same kind of country. .
If only Australia didn’t go in so furiously'
tor Public Ownership- it might- own som>-
thing. There is no . knbwing^
Australia, can show the " world-sorSe-
rare specimens .of State Socialism, which,
of course, includes-:.the EederaL-artielo. It
owns a complete railway system of ~1-J33..
miles, not one item of which pays wdrkfnf'
expenses, let alone some trifle towards inter-
est. It can show two large enterprises, one
r-,F^^x sl ? ip Pi n f -concern, ip which.-ahopt
f 14.000,0011 xs> said:ta.he iifeojyied amfrwtfcff
owns some 40 vessels, and the other a large
■State shißbuildiAg tmsi-ile'St ‘ v ab(>H t' Which I't-ftg .
ostensible owners can get no more informa-
tion than if they were two conspiracies.
Then there is, in Queensland, a State lifh-
assurance office, which has half-a-dozen
other lines to share its expenses so that they
may be low, and on whicn a monopoly wa's-
conferred so that, not having to hustle hard
for business, they might be almost nil. Last
year it gathered m £148,201 of life premiums
at a cost of £51,304. or over £34 12s. per
cent. The Maonland State Life Office,
which has to tight all-coiners, has no side-
lines to share expenses, and gets no favors
in the way- of taxation, works on about
one-third that rate, and some big mutual
offices for even less. So State Socialism
is justified when there are neither knaves
nor fools behind it. The misfortune is that,
judging by results, there seem to be, over a
large part of Australia, no people in charge
except knaves or fools. There are hundreds
of other examples—mostly worse. It has
been suggested that Public Ownership might
have a chance if Australia adopted the
United State Federal system, whereby the
Prime- Minister .(President) is elected by the
people for-a fixed term, • and -appoints as his
Ministers men whom he considers qualified
from outside Parliament. Then' mafia'ger
Lines of the Bank of N.S.W., and Delprat
of the B. H. Prop., and" MOnash, civil
engineer and General, would be qualified to
hold the finance, works and railways port-
folios in lieu of Lambert, “Doc.” Maloney
and Joel Moses Gabb. whereas at present
Lambert, Maloney and Gabb are qualified
for everything and the three experts for
nothing. But State Socialism has reached
its present depth of degradation because it
now exists almost wholly to provide for men
of no greater cal bre than Lambert, Maloney
and Gabb. —-The..case of Russia, where, by
the decree-of. March, 1921, the system was
practically dismantled, and public enter-
prises were thrown on the market by thou-
sands, shows what may happen to Sosh when
the twilight becomes too deep.
THE RELATION OF THE PROFES-
SIONS TO THE PURLIC.
Tiib; great professions—medicine, advocacy
and the sort of legal work which is. done
. .by attorneys in offices—are often loosely
compared to unions. They are only unions
in the sense that they unite to fix minimum
wages, and here they have an advantage over
bricklayers, carpenters and the like: they
decide what themselves are worth, whereas
a Court does it for their humbler brethren.
A strike in any one department of indus-
trialism is a nuisance, and it may be worse;
but strikes are inevitable where men have
to accept the decisions of outsiders, however
well qualified and honest, as to the value of
their services. A general strike of, say,
doctors, would be such a tragedy that it is
almost unthinkable ; but then it is unthink-
able also because the doctors, and not their
patients, decide what doctors shall be paid,
and the same rule applies in the case of
barristers and solicitors. A doctor never
has to down tools for higher jvages. lie
only does it when, as in the recent case of
Dr. Thompson, of Sydney, he is asked to
work beside one whom his organisation has
barred. But the cardinal difference between
the relation of a professional man towards
the public and that of a tradesman has
nothing to do either with earning capacity
or the power to enforce adequate payment
for the same. The damage an unscrupulous
or predatory bricklayer or carpenter may do
is relatively slight; and, anyhow, the work
of these men is performed in company and
often under supervision. The potentialities
for harm which exist in the case of doctors,
barristers and solicitors are literally illimit-
able.
* * * *
Three examples of what may happen have
come before the N. S. Wales pubLc in the
last few months. In the first case a doctor
of repute, an honorary of a great hospital
and a member of the University Club, was
accused of extorting money from poor people
with whom he had got into touch in his
capacity of honorary; lie -\y;ts accused of
frightening them into paying 'him large sums
to be cured of T.B M ' knowing-in many cases
that they were not sufferers from this
dreadful disease. The attention of the
B.M.A. was drawn trffbim and ample proof
offered of his misdeeds.S.lts reply was that
it “could do nothin g,”.;br that it was “not
concerned with such matters,” or words to
that effect—though it had just expelled and
thereby half-ruined a\ suburban doctor for
writing strongly; about;; lunacy reform over
his own name iff'the lay press; As’it hap-
pened, "this was; one off. l those rare cases
where Parliament could he moved. -.The
doctor was brought before a Board con-
stituted under a special Act, ..and after in-
quiry he was convicted. The second examp’e
concerns the lower branch Of the legal pro-,
fession. At short intervals, during the past
couple of months,,. Dr. Gordon Bray, a weli-
. known Sydney- specialist, has been figuring
before, the Registrar in Bankruptcy. On
almpst every occasion he has sworn that
his wife originally named three co-respon-
dents in her divorce suit against him; that
her solicitor demanded £l5 a week alimony
for her and £3OO costs for himself to dis-
miss two of the ladies front the suit; that
other- .interested solicitors-urged him to agree
to this extraordinary scheme (though one
who is, incidentally;.--an ox-president of the
Law Institute .adyised him to “have no-
thing whatever to do with it”), and that
eventually he yielded. As this paper has
remarked before, the doctor’s story may be
capable of a perfectly innocent explanation.
Yet the fact remains that none of the solicit,
tors named,’ from the president of the ' Law
RCwnwards, ha§- made so much
as_ the shadow of an attempt to explain any-
thingr* ATnd, finally, an example offers from
the Bar. One of the scandals of modern advo-
cacy is the long-drawn-out lawsuit. It may
-be no mo.rffffhaff a coincidence that usually,
even ini 'the.'simplest nisi prius matter,
the- - hearing extends into several weeks—
always;- provided the parties .have, ample
means. But so 'it its. " Some of the Judges
have grown so used to this convention that
they accept it as a matter of course, while
others, are too weak. tp. check what they
mjigVJ&Dow to b.e a gross wrong to litigants
and to the public.’ The other day,"however,
.Ayneffcomerr Mr. ■ Justice. OAMPBELt, .spoke,
out in vigorous protest against what he called
“wasting the time of the Court.” But it
stopped there. The Bar Council did not
attempt to translate the Judge’s hint into
action. It would be ready enough, one rna?
assume, to inquire, into the case of a bar-
rister, more especially a junior barrister
who was accused -publicly of cutting his
fees or interviewing"u client without the
intermediation of an attorney; but for coun-
sel who are charged from the very Bench
with “wasting the time of the Court” (i e
the ruinously expensive time of the litigants’
the time of the jurors and the time of the’
public who pay for the machinery of Justice)
the Bar Council merely offers that silence
which presumably means approval.
There is a reason for the existence of the
tf.iU.A. the Bar Council and the Law Insti-
tute which is not fully understood by the
average layman. In the view of many people
they are there, like the executives of so many
unions to keep up fees and discipline black-
legs. In point of fact the governing bodies
of the professions have a far more important
function. Ihe public would have no cause to
worry if every industrial union in Australia
disbanded to-morrow. It is true the union
executives exact a certain standard of con-
duct from their members; but. if Bill
Brown, lumper, individually committed
every crime in the lexicon of the wharfside
the damage _ so done, even to his employer
would be slight. The great professions pos-
sess executives on whose fearless integrity
they constantly insist, because it is abso-
lutely essential for the public’s peace of mind
that professional men should be adequately
controlled; as individuals , or, anyhow that
an impression should exist that they are so
controlled. Suppose, for example, the public
had no guarantee against professional mis-
conduct on the part Of individual doctors.
Obviously, in that event, no one would be
sate from being fleeced on the ground that
he had an imaginary illness or from being
operated on for a non-existent internal
trouble. The B.M.A. is there chieflv, or
anyhow it claims to be there chiefly, to see
that the profession is not discredited by such
conduct. Suppose prominent solicitors were
in the habit of arranging the salient details
ot divorce suits out of court. Suppose they
arrogated to themselves the right, as is
alleged to have happened in Dr. Bray’s
suit, to dismiss co-respondents for financial
considerations. Plainly the next . step of less
prominent, and perhaps less scrupulous,
attorneys would be to advise that people
should be put into divorce suits as co-
respondents or respondents iff order that
they might pay to be taken out. The Law
Institute is supposed to stand between the
public and such highly dangerous potentiali-
ties. And suppose, finally, that barristers
were the only arbiters as regards their de-
meanor towards the public, and their treat-
ment of their clients, in court. If that were
so we would get the blackguardly -conduct
towards witnesses which Dickens lashed
b alf-a-centui'y ago, and we would have trivial
cases protracted by frivolous “objections”
and idiotic argumentsyand quarrels—all as
an ordinary matter course. The Bar
Louncil exists, in the eyes of the defenceless
public which is constantly liable to be
dragged to the courts in one capacity or
another, to prevent outrageous injustices of
the sort.
*•* * #
The question arises, anyhow in N. S.
Wales, whether the 8.M.A., the Bar Coun-
ml or the Law Institute is performing any
useful function, so far as the public is
concerned. It is essential, for obvious
reasons, that the public should have full
confidence in the integrity of its chartered
servants, who minister to its health and co-
operate in the dispensation of justice. There
was a time, in N. S. Wales, when the
leaders of the professions made it their
business to see that that confidence was
created and maintained. It is on record
that Alfred Stephen, (C.J;*: - committed
two K.L. s Who were his intimate personal
friends, to Darlinghurst Gaol for improper
conduct in his court, and the sentence im-
posed by him served. It is diffi-
cult to picture 'a modern M 8. Wales
Judge taking up such a\ stand, and the
result is a , vitiated morale -right ‘down
the legal scale. If,, as sebmi'-ffo be
the case, both in medfmne. ahd--.:the law
social influences; are too- strong for .those
who should l>e the guardians of the'profes-
sions reputations as professions, then-obvi-
ously the duty - of attending - .to this matter
should--be delegated to" special tribunals
appointed, by Parliament. The ..Medical
Board might serve as a mqdehlAjjut the
new organisations would have-to he i great
dead eas’er to stir into activity, than the
Medical Board has shown itself, to be in the
,^ le fcwt of a Judge’s public rebuke:
of- evidence which has gone unchallenged
in court,; or even of affidavits alleging pro-
fessional misconduct-sworn outside a court
ough.t to be sufficient to ensure at least an
inquiry. The present system is unjust botli
- to.. taose p rofessiona I. men , whose conduct i s
above susmfeioh—the;;: vast majority, of
course,, in all. the. professions—and even more
so to the public,, which has a right not only
to faithful, service from members of the
professions, bfit also to the knowledge that
no other sort of service can safely be given.
A COOL PROPOSAL FROM CANADA.
J. A. Robb, Canadian Minister of Trade and
Commerce, who came, to Australia Ti few
-weeks before; the general election to com-
plete the arrangements, begun, at Ottawa by
the expensive I’earce, for a reciprocal-.tariff,
lias gone home with his desire ungratified,
- but not 1 -without hope. Before his departure
lie confided to a \\ r EST Australian reporter
that his visit was made “at the invitation
of Mr. Hughes, and on his assurance that
the election would not interfere with’ our
negotiations.” Which shows how.verji.‘cock-
sure Mr. Hughes was in those days. Con-
tinuing, the gentleman said:— ’
On arrival here, I found Ministers busy in the
election campaign; but I had a conference with
Mb. Hughes,- three meetings 'with Mr. Kodgers,
Minister of Trade and Customs, and a three weeks’
session with tjie Tariff Board. The result of our
conference will be submitted to the Canadian and
Australian Governments. I leave Australia with
the hope that, before long, our sister Dominion will
be linked up with all others enjoying the benefits
.of., our British, preference, which is now 33J
'per cent., generally speaking, but, on some particu-
lar items, runs up to 40 per cent. The Canadian
Trade Commissioner in Australia has been author-
ised to continue the negotiations after the Federal


Ministers have settled down, rested from the effects
of the election, and had their Christmas holidays.
Unfortunately for the man from Toronto,
the Ministers haven’t been authorised to
continue the negotiations with his Commis-
sioner. Five of them, the Minister of Cus-
toms included, have been ordered to rest
for at least three years from the effects of
the election, and with the others it will pre-
sently be a case of settling up rather than
settling down. In v r iew of the Maoriland
arrangement, it seems probable that Hughes
and Rodgers have agreed to make conces-
sions at the expense of Australian industry,
but considering (1) that a question of
policy is involved, and (2) that the mori-
bund Government had no business to raise
the matter of reciprocity when its fate was
about to be decided in the constituencies,
such concessions will not be binding on the
next crowd. In any case, Parliament will
say the last word on the fruits of the nego-
tiations, should they reach fruition, and it
is not likely to be so complaisant as it was
when the M.L. schedules were sprung on it
and whisked through with a minimum of
debate.

For one thing, the circumstances are
different. Maoriland is 1200 miles away,
and a good customer; Canada, 7000 miles
aw’ay, and a bad customer. Of late years
the Canadians have bought less Australian
stuff than little Ceylon, which, in 1921, had
a total European population of 9329. A
detailed list , of the Australian exports to
Canada occupies a whole two inches of space
in the trade manual issued by the Common-
wealth Bureau of Statistics, wffiereas the
imports from Canada take up nearly 20
inches. The following shows what Mr.
Robb’s countrymen purchased from Aus-
tralia in the last two recorded years, and it
wasn’t all Australian produce at that: —

The comparison is instructive, and very
comforting-—to Canada. How the Ottawa
politicians must have chuckled when the
absurd Pearce arrived, spatted and silk-
hatted, with his fatuous suggestions for
closer fiscal union! After considering
Pearce from north to south and adjusting
the preliminaries by cable, the Canadian
Government, as Robb records, “authorised
me to proceed to Australia at once.”
Which suggests that the Canadians had
formed a shrewd judgment of the gentry
they were dealing with, and were not at
all confident that a people which had
stood Pearce in high office for 12 years
could be trusted to suffer him and his crowd
for another term. Their anxiety to improve
the shining hour is perfectly understandable,
but they didn’t reckon on the Priminister’s
hurry to go to the country once he had
assured himself of a safe seat.
* * * *
What the Canadians are after is an exten-
sion to their products of the preference
granted to Britain. Mr. Robb kindly sug-
gests that if they get the same tariff as the
Old Man in London, who is far and away
Australia’s best customer, and generally
buys a lot more than he sells, they
will sink their teeth in a few Aus-
tralian oranges and lemons and extend their
extremely small purchases of greasy wool.
“We need more wool for our own mills,” he
said in Westralia, a State which produced
46,000,000 pounds of greasy wool last year
and hasn’t a mill to its name. “We are
also prepared,” he added, “to-give Australia
a very substantial preference on dried fruits,
such as raisins and currants,” the value of
which concession, considering California’s
proximity to and stranglehold on the Cana-
dian market, would be precisely nil. In return
for these illusory benefits, the Australian
manufacturer is to have the joys of heavily-
increased Canadian competition in agricul-
tural implements, wearing apparel, corsets,
boots and shoes, confectionery, leather and
rubber goods, motor bodies, jewellery and
fancy goods, carbide and so on. This com-
petition is to be aided in every case by a
substantial reduction of duty. There is no
chance under the suggested arrangement of
Australian manufactures finding a market
in Canada. Boiled down, the proposal is
that Australia should expose numerous
struggling secondary industries to the danger
of being snuffed out by highly-organised
competitors, financed in many cases from
the U.S.A. and getting nearly all their raw
materials locally, whereas the British (as
is allowed for in the existing preferential
tariff) have to drag theirs from abroad.
In consideration of this stupendous
sacrifice Canada offers to buy a few
more bales of wool, and vasruely sug-
gests (1) that the growers of citrus fruits
may sell a few cases in Vancouver when the
Californian article is out of season, and (2)
that a bit of dried fruit may also be un-
loaded until the Americans regain then- con-
trol by dumping, or get a reciprocal
tariff themselves. It is an uninviting pros-
pect. Not yet is Australia reduced to mak-
ing enormous fiscal concessions on the
strength of hazy assurances that it will
thereby increase its sales of wool and fruit.
Nothing would please it more than to do an
extensive business with Canada on a fifty-
fifty basis, but seeing that the balance of
trade is so strongly in Canada’s favor, it is
for that country to show how the thing can
be done. The onus of nroof, in short, is on
the Canadians. At present it looks as if
they want Australia to accept an amplifica-
tion —injurious, if not ruinous, to the manu-
facturers concerned —of the arrangement
under which they sell the Commonwealth
£3l worth of manufactured goods and buy £1
worth of raw material in return.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shady Politics.
An ancient and fish-like suspicion continues
to pervade the doings of N. S. Wales Labor,
both State and municipal, and there is the
same show of virtuous fury when anyone
mentions the fact. In Sydney municipal
affairs some members of the crowd mani-
fested a craving to buy, for £75,000 or so of
the ratepayers’ money, something that was
valued by experts at £5OOO or thereabouts,
or else to pay £40,000 of good municipal loan
funds as wages to persons for whom they
had no legitimate employment that anybody
discovered. In State politics, and all within
a brief two years, a Labor Ministry and its
friends had a run of dubious events which,
for persistence, beat the plagues of Egypt
multiplied by the calamities and boils of
.Job. One was the commitment of the State
Trawling and Fish-hawking Department to
buying a vast quantity of coal—five years’
supply, in fact —at a high figure, from a
lucky individual who wasn’t bound to fur-
nish any coal if a rise in price spoiled his
profit, though the State Trawling Office was
bound to take the coal even if the pr.ce went
down so low that the fuel could be procured
for half the cost elsewhere. Also, the con-
tract —which was a quaint sort of marriage
in the sense that one party was
irretrievably wedded while the other
wasn’t —was apparently to hold °ood
even if the Trawling Bureau died and
had no more need of coal, and it con-
tained provision for the payment of a mag-
nificent commission to an outsider who
neither trawled nor coaled, and who seemed
to have no more place in the business than
the Queen of Sheba. Another row now
centres round one more of the late Govern-
ment’s contracts —a matter of £1,060,000
worth of cement, bought at £5 Bs. per ton
when a fair price is alleged to be £2 10s.
In this case also there appears to have been
the mysterious intermediary or earbiter —
the person who tells the flabbergasted Min-
ister or Department that there is such a
thing as coal or cement, and gets a big per-
centage for putting him or it on the trail of
the novel substance. A tale is in active
circulation that the recent N. S.. Wales Min-
istry 'schemed to buy from Private Enter-
prise the South Maitland Coalfields rail-
way at a price which worked out at about
£25,000 per mile, and the S.M.C. railway
isn’t exactly a spring chicken in the first
glow of youthful health and solvency.
The opposition of the Railway Corn
missioners is said to have spoiled the deal,
and it is certain that a certain Minister
was a very grumpy man about that time,
and spoke darkly of the sack, and of a new
set of Commissioners. In, or, rather, out
of, the State Timber Yard it was lately
reported that £35,000 worth of assets had
fled —taken up their bed and walked. The
Land Resumption scheme of the early days
of Dooleyism should have been worth mil-
lions of highway robbery, only the Govern-
ment was seized with innumerable cold feet
when an exposure of the business in London
was followed by a breakage in the loan
market. Under this scheme any large land-
owner, and many a moderate one, could
have his property seized at the Government’s
(or its nominees’) figure, against which there
would be no appeal, and paid for_ with low-
priced securities worth about 15s. in the
£, and redeemable the eternity after next.
Worse still, the property might be earmarked
for resumption, after which no private sale
would be allowed, yet not bought and not
paid for, even with the most valueless de-
bentures. And against these ruinous mis-
fortunes the Minister was to be able to grant
or sell immunity. The scandals in politics
—the vast majority of them in Labor poli-
tics—become a monotony, and remed.es
should be sought. Two may be suggested,
one based on law, and one on public opinion.
In the first place, any person, whether Min-
ister, mayor, alderman, departmental head or
departmental under-strapper, who is respon-
sible for a gross waste of public money by
buying or contracting for something at 50
or 100 per cent, above its market value, with
or without commish, to myster.ous out-
siders, should be respons'ble for the loss
with the last penny of his possessions, in-
cluding the amount he settled on his wife
immediately after the transaction. If there
were 12 persons in the deal so much the
better chance of recovering from one of them.
This would save the trouble of proving inten-
tional dishonesty, and would make ignorance,
real or assumed, a crime, as it ought to be.
Ignorant persons shouldn’t climb, by effront-
ery or corruption, into high and ex-
pensive places, and on this sound
principle the character called Ignorance.
in the great tinker’s “Pilgrim’s Progress,”
was rightly damned in the last act. The
remedy based on public opinion is that poli-
tical parties should drop and ban and throw
overboard the colleague to whom, or to whose
associates, being suspected has become, or
looks like becoming, a habit. Guilty or
not, they should go out for. being unlucky.
As the want of the necessary public opinion
is the cause of the whole trouble, this is
merely a pious aspiration, and is not put
forward seriously. Still, such a policy, even
if it was only a pose, would leave more room
for men who could perpetrate big frauds
without being suspected, thus affording a
proof presumptive of intelligence, if no more.
Some Musings on Murder.
“Clifford Snook” recalls the past:—
From the United States comes always something
new, and generally something with gore and scattered
brains and untidy bowels in it. The latest is the
revival of the Ku Klux Klan, which is waging gory
nocturnal war in a way that looks meaningless to U 3
at this distance but is probably intelligible enough to
those on the spot. The K.K.K. goes about in masks
and hoods, drops bodies into swamps at midnight’s
solemn hour, when churchyards yawn and graves
throw up their dead, and lets off dynamite. The
original K.K.K., which arose soon after Lincoln’s
time, was not wholly’ inexplicable and it is possible
that its successor will be explained in time.
Abraham Lincoln was made a great man in a
land where great men are scarce, though great
money-getters are not. Therefore its geese are
swans as a matter of necessity, and there is a tendency
for some of the w’orms which its geese eat to be
regarded as swans also. Lincoln is credited with
physical as well as moral courage; but his ardent
temperament didn’t bring him under fire. He was
moral, and no Flossies were ever charged against
him. Also he was religious, and no drinker or
guzzler. lie was patriotic, and a great platform
speaker. His contributions to literature, art, science,
invention or any other side-line of industry were nil.
Sagacity’ and steadfastness were his long suits,
yet he blundered into an unjust and foolish civil
war, and his capacity for selecting inferior men to
serve him amounted to genius. Few other rulers
could have dug out Ben Butler. On Lincoln’s
side were three-fourths of the white population,
practically all the money, coal and iron supplies
and factories, nearly all the ships, the possession
of the metropolis, and the recognition of foreign
nations. And it took him two years to score
his first respectable victory, and four years to drag
the business to a finish.
Abraham Lincoln w T on his first election as
President because his opponents, the Democratic,
pro-Southern and (more or less) pro-slavery party,
chose that time of all times to quarrel fiercely
among themselves, and nominated two candidates in
place of one. But for that rare event his defeat
would have been decisive. At his second election
the South, being still at war, had no vote at all,
and in the North (his own country) the candi-
date set up against him was the most discredited,
save two, of his long row of commanders-in-
chief, the other two being Pope, whose sanity
was suspected, and Halleck, who was charged
with concealment in a cellar when Lee’s army was
reported - in the offing. He beat the discredited
one on the popular vote in the moderate propor-
tion of 22 to 18.
A crazy Southerner shot Lincoln, just as a crazy
Frenchman shot Garfield and a crazy Slav of some
sort shot McKinley. His death was a boon and a
blessing to the party which wanted to lay the
South in- the dust. They decided to hold the entire
South responsible. To rouse the people Lincoln was
appointed to the job of national hero on the spot,
Washington moving up a little to make room. The
moving spirit in the vengeance was not the new
President, but Thaddeus Stevens, a politician
about whom there was serious speculation as to
whether he was Anti-Christ or a criminal lunatic.
The chief object of Stevens’s hatred was the universe,
but he boiled with indignation over a number of
other things as well, and he was abetted in his detes-
tations and other undesirable habits by the colored
lady of easy virtue who served him as a sort of
wife.
He, or the lady, or the two in collaboration, con-
ceived an ingenious scheme. The white majority’ in
the South, where there was one, was disfranchised
for serving in the war. The colored male population
was put on the roll solidly. Every seedy “organiser”
in the North packed his other shirt into his carpet-
bag (hence the term “carpet-bagger”) and sprinted
south for a billet at “organising” the new electors.
White officialdom almost vanished. There were black
police and militia; black postmasters who couldn’t
read; black Judges who couldn’t write; black legis-
lators who couldn’t spell, but who divided the taxes
and the loan money as readily as though they were
so many Daniel Websters. Some of these elements
made the mistake of proposing to divide the w’hite
girls.
7hen the Ku Klux Klan arose in its anger and
went forth by night, and slew carpet-baggers and
others, but principally carpet-baggers, with vast
energy. In recent times a theory has arisen that
the name derives from the Greek kuktos, a
circle. But there is no evidence that the original
Klansmen were circular or globular either, or that
they worried about Greek. In the days when the
Klan and the carpet-bagger made a procession of
two, with the carpet-bagger a trifle ahead, the term
was explained as simply derived from the “click-
click-click” made when one cocked the old-fashioned
muzzle-loader. The Federal Government “put down”
the K.K.K.: one authority 1 have before me says in
1867, while another suggests that the event hap-
pened in 1869. Yet another says the K.K.K. didn’t
start till 1868, and that it “was the subject of
legislation” in 1871. Apparently it was put down
just as Sinn Fein was, and is more or less up again, as
Sinn Fein is. Movements of this description bear a
sort of resemblance to the fabled phoenix: they die in
the reference books only to rise again, covered with
dripping blood and newly uprooted hair, in excitable
spots like Erin and the U.S.
The Eternal Quest.
Premier Fuller, of N. S. Wales, goes to
London, as Ms predecessor did, not exactly
to cadge a loan and bring the money away
with him, but to inspire confidence With
glozing words and dubious representations
—to be the confidence man, in short. Not
to put too fine a point on the matter, he
wants to pawn the infant, whom so many
cowardly swindlers and unmanly shirkers
have pawned, body and soul, so many times
already, for another £6,000,000. If he gets
the money, as his predecessor didn’t, that
will be no proof that the Private Enterprise
capitalists who undertake to produce it re-
regard N. S. Wales as other than rotten,
unprincipled and insolvent. It will merely
prove that they are confident of their ability
to peddle off to small and possibly over-
credulous investors any part of the loan they
happen to be “landed” with, and that they
have no idea of abandoning a profitable line
of business. A rather big man in London
recently cast reflections on N. S. Wales’s
finances, and with some reason. This State has
the record deficit of Australian history, also
the record debt and the record interest bill. It
holds the Australian record for shortness of
sinking fund, if about ss. per £IOO can be
called even a short sinking fund. Judging
by the increase in the rates of interest from
1913 to 1921, its credit has been going down
faster than that of any other State bar Tas-
mania, and is lower than that of Victoria,
Westralia or even Queensland. Judging by
the statement in the Railway Commission-
ers’ report that the N. S. Wales interest
rate for 1922 was per cent., it looks as
if the next complete batch of comparative
statistics will show Fuller’s State at the
very bottom of the solvency list. The Min-
istry has made no attempt either to provide
for'the deficit or to furnish a sinking fund.
The Premier addressed the press in a pained
voice at the close of the year about the
calumny that had been heaped on the head
of N. S. Wales’s financial status, and about
the value of its public lands, also its public
works, finished or in progress. As regards
the lands the press contained, the same day,
a statement about Government soil infested
with prickly-pear, which it wdll cost £S
per acre to clear, and which will be woldh
£3 per acre when cleared. That looks move
like a big liability than a security to borrow’
on, and the grief is that the liability must
be met one day, else it may grow so big as
to eat up the land asset in toto. In any
case the public estate is a delusive thing.
Almost every yard of it that will fetch any-
thing is leased for as much as it will fetch,
and the rental is all required, or, at least,
it is all used, as revenue. So, to all intents
and purposes, the security is used up
already. In the matter of public works, .the
3110 'miles of N. S. Wales loan railway
which lost £1,005,462 last year looks the
same sort of minus asset as the prickly-
pear. The railway asset was in a poor
way last year. The freight it carried was
1,030,320 tons less than the year before,
and in the struggle to make ends meet the
Department charged £747,454 more for
carrying it. Ends didn’t meet even then,
but the increased charges apparently made
an end of a good deal of business. If the
influential person in London who threw’ mud
at the State’s credit is aware of these and
other matters that are even worse, George
Fuller may have his holiday spoiled by too
much hard' explanation. Nothing is w’orse
for a holiday than to have its every waking
hour punctuated by savage criticism.
Thomas Atkins.
Dear Bulletin, —As one born and bred in
Australasia let me felicitate “R.S.W.” for
his article on the English soldier (B.
14/12/’22). i would also like to add one
or two facts. It was not the Canadian
or the Australian or the Maorilander
who bore the first shock of the offen-
sive of March, 1918. Conan Doyle (him-
self an Irishman, by the way) points
out in his history of the 1918 campaign that
of the British troops who broke the Hinden-
burg line in the last stages of the war, 70
per cent, were English—not merely British
from the British Isles —and that the English
percentage of casualties was even higher.
Speaking at a service gathering in London
the other day Haig said that the German
Von Ivluck, who commanded against the
British in 1914, had paid them this tribute
• —“that nothing which he had ever seen or
heard or read of was comparable to the
achievements of the Expeditionary Force
originally sent from England to the help of
France.” This force was predominantly
English. By the time the Anzacs reached
France a large proportion of the flower of
England’s manhood had already perished,
and naturally by the time the Fifth Army
was overwhelmed in 1918 things were in-
comparably worse. At this time Britain
was defending its possessions overseas with
half-a-dozen armies, and finally there was
the navy to be manned, afloat and ashore,
on all the seven seas. It would not be put-
ting it too strongly to say that towards the
end of the war the ordinary English line
regiment had to take the worst of the
national material —the leavings from the
rest; but it is by these regiments that the
Englishman’s fighting ability has been
mainly judged. Justice will be done to the
Fifth Army some day. Hitherto such repar-
ation has been prevented by the small-
mindedness of the politicians who were
responsible for nutting Gough into a hope-
less position. It is highly significant that
Gougii thought before the battle began that
the British might have to go back so far as
to lose Amiens. He told Philip Gibbs so.

“Mr. Doolev, who last week refused to attend
at Macdonell House to explain his connection with
the circular attacking the A.L.P., receives £5 a
week, in addition to his Parliamentary salary, as
leader of the N.S.W. Labor Party. For this, a
member of the A.L.F. executive declares, he merely
‘Smokes cigars and smiles and smiles and smiles.’ ”
—Sydney Sun.
The Labor “heads” with wrath are black,
The A.L.P. is wild;
It feels as one who fain would smack
A sorely fractious child.
Amd wouldn’t you be narked a bit
If one you hankered hard to hit
Another bunch of spinach lit
And tolerantly smiled*:
A peremptory summons came
To stand upon the mat
And please explain his little game,
And say what he was at
The day he signed the circular
That gave Macdonell House a jar.
He merely puffed at his cigar
And cynically spat.
Three gave the pompous Junta cheek,
And three were carpeted.
One came in self-defence to speak,
And one was sick abed;
The third, a more discerning bloke,
Who never fails to see a joke,
Laughed loud from out the cloud of smoke
That wreathed his jovial head.
Ah! blest, indeed, the statesman born
Beneath such lucky stars,
Who when his little world is torn
By fratricidal spars,
And street dogs bark, “What nrice cement?”
With brow unruffled, head unbent,
Can placidly extract content
From threepenny cigars.
Each week he draws a fiver more
Than what the rank and file’s
Allowance is. The legal lore
And Parliamentary wiles
Of Hughes he’s unendowed with. Nor,
Like Billy, does he rave and roar
In withering words that sear and score
When friends, turned foemen, seek his gore.
No, Dooley simply lights a Flor
De Poisongas—a bob for four—
And smiles and smiles and smiles.

Pacts like the above are apt to lie buried in
the vast mass of matter that the war
has produced. In particular, I advise
all who are jealous of the honor
of that gallant fellow, T. Atkins, to
paste the fact about the Hindenburg
line in their notebooks. Most people are
astonished when confronted with it. In con-
clusion here is an item worth quoting from
“The King’s Pilgrimage,” just issued in
London: “The total number of the dead of
the British Empire in the Great War was
recently officially stated in the House of
Commons to be 946,023, distributed as fol-
lows: Great Britain and Ireland, 743,702;
Canada, Australia, Maoriland. South

Nationalising the Obsolescent.
In accordance with an old ambition of the
Queensland Labor party, the Brisbane elec-
tric tramways have been “nationalised” and
placed under the control of a trust, composed
of two representatives of the Government
and six of the local bodies concerned. The
deed was done on New Year’s Day, and an
army of lawyers is getting ready to hurl
copious arguments at the Pull Court as to
the basis of compensation to which the com-
pany is entitled, it having been expropriated
without an understanding on that point.
The Government contends that it should pay
only for the physical value of the system,
parts of which are 26 years old ; the company
that it has a right to haif-a-million extra,
or as much more as may be reckoned a fair
thing, for goodwill. When the Pull Court
decides between them there will be an appeal
to the High Court, and thence to the Privy
Council (unless that tribunal decides that
enough has been said), so the proceedings
will be tedious to the taxpayers,
though joyous for the Bar. Much
simpler were the methods of the Westralian
Labor party in Jack Scaddan’s time. When
that hilarious statesman “nationalised” the
Perth tramways, in the process of nearly
doubling the W.A. debt in live years, he paid
the company its price without a murmur.
Taxed in Parliament with having given twice
as much as the outfit was worth, he silenced
the base traducer by producing a letter in
which the chairman of the company warmly
complimented him on the bargain he had
made for the State. So great a bargain
was it that the substantial profits earned
under the old regime became invisible under
Government ownership. In like manner the
service grew worse instead of better, the
building of_ promised extensions was post-
poned indefinitely, and the employees devel-
oped that chronic condition which is de-
scribed in the Labor papers as “seething with
discontent.” In 1919 they seethed so vio-
lently that the cars were held up for several
weeks. It is remotely possible that the
Brisbane experiment will have better luck.
But there is nothing cheering in the
announcement to the residents of the outer
suburbs that no money is available for
extensions. And, apart from the prospect
of the undertaking being over-capitalised
from the outset, danger is obviously coming
from the motor omnibus. In London, as
Theodore and his numerous Agents-General
should know very well, motor-’bus competi-
tion has imparted a sick appearance to the
14 millions invested in the County Council
trams. In Sydney, despite the horrible roads
and the handicaps imposed on them by the
ill-willed authorities, the ’buses are beating
the trams hollow. They are beginning to
make even old-established sections unprofit-
able for the clumsy contrivance that runs
on rails. Thus far the motor-’bus hasn’t
been much of a factor in the northern capital;
but, then, it wasn’t much of a factor in
Sydney until the last year or so. It will
probably arrive in Brisbane, as it did in
Sydney, with a rush. Indeed, the time may
come when the Queensland public will
morosely question the sanity of a Government
that “took over” a taxpaying tramway sys-
tem at a price that is sure to be heavy,
and may be quite prodigious, when the cheap
and agile motor-’bus was looming up on the
horizon. But by that time the fool-Adminis-
tration that has misruled Queensland for
seven years will be beyond the public’s reach.
The N.S.W. Law Against Lotteries.
Since January 1 it has been illegal to run
lotteries and art-unions in godly N. S.
Wales, the headquarters of the pony-racing
industry, unless a charter of immunity has
been issued by the Attorney-General. In
that case the parties behind the gamble—they
must have entered into a deed of partner-
ship or association —are obliged to produce
a balance-sheet on demand, and are for-
bidden to hawk tickets in streets, lanes or
doorways. Unclaimed nrizes are to be sold
by public auction, and fraud in the conduct
of lotteries, falsification of books or vouch-
ers and misappropriation of moneys are
punishable with imprisonment for five years.
Promoters of bazaars in aid of “eleemo-
synary or charitable institutions” are to be
permitted, as hitherto, to set the chocolate-
wheel whirring to the glory of God, and
raffle the sewing-machine that is nearly
always won by Father Cassidy for
the good of the Church, but they are
n - ”* to include tobacco among the prizes or
any lubricant with a kick in it. Also, an
interdict is laid on the sale of tickets in, and
the publication of any printed matter rela-
tive to foreign lotteries, specifically Hobart
Tattersall’s and the Queensland Golden
Casket. Like Bavin, its author, the new
law is a mixed blessing. Welcome is the
section which aims at ridding the Sydney
streets of the frowsy mob of ticket-hawkers,
who have hitherto infested it Salutary are
the provisions which are calculated to suike
the guns of such chevaliers d’lndustrie as
the gentlemen at Casino (N.S.W.), who
raked in £5151 by the disposal of 6s. tickets,
played up £4027 in expenses, distributed
£llOO in prizes and handed £23 Cs. Bd. to
the hospital on behalf of which the enter-
prise was alleged to have been launched. But
in other respects the measure is the expres-
sion of a dreary and futile wowserism. It
is a pathetically useless attempt to save the
souls of those who take a flutter in Tatt.’s
or the Golden Casket, and to save their
money for the State in which it is earned,
what time the devouring plague of pony-
racing leaves Bavin unmoved. The only
commonsense way of weaning the horse- and
sweep-gambler from his folly is to offer him
a safe alternative, namely, premium bonds.
By this sane device all the loans maturing
in N. S. Wales this year could be redeemed,
CONSERVING THE NATION'S STRENGTH.
“Mr. Hughes, Australia’s one strong man.” — Billy’s press.
“And would you rashly rob the nation of its one strong man?"
“Not at all. But for the Lord's sake go and be strong somewhere else —at Washing-
ton, say."
and a great part of the money would come
from the fund that feeds Tattersall’s, the
Golden Casket, proprietary racing clubs,
bookmakers and their attendant parasites.
But there would be furious opposition to
the undertaking, and the Government Would
have to take its courage in both hands. And
Bavin’s crowd isn’t that kind of Govern-
ment.
The Nark of the Family.
Dear Bulletin, — One Weekes, of Sydney,
returned from a visit to London, pours scorn
upon our costly sarcophagus, Australia
House —an institution which serves no vis-
ible purpose save as a last halting-place on
the road to the tomb for one used-up poli-
tician after another. The moribund one
mostly doesn’t care, or is too busy making
his peace with his Maker to worry about
visitors to his expensive haunt, and' is usu-
ally either absent, invisible or unapproach-
able. The ancient’s immense staff of Bar-
nacles, hired on the soot to save trouble,
knows little about this strange, remote
land. It can give no information about
the Australian tariff. It hasn’t a ghost
of an idea what is grown in Australia It
is even hazy as to the date when the next
shipload of convicts will leave. But Weekes
found one gleam of activity among the cob-
webs and the moths :
The chief use of our famous Australia House seems
to be its advertising activities for Victoria. The
impiession that a stranger receives when visiting
Australia House for information relative to Australia
is that Victoria is the Commonwealth. Coming down
fiom Charing Cross along the Strand one catches
the name “Victoria,” while the road immediately in
front of the building, made out of Commonwealth
property, is named “Melbourne-plaee.” One insigni-
ficant window is devoted to N.S.W., and when I
passed it all that it contained was two dusty bottles
of jam, the labels of which were covered with
solidified dirt.
Ireland used to be a wronged country, but
its troubles were nothing compared to
the wrongs of the Ma State when the local
old-style patriot gets Victoria on the brain.
Some people have suggested that the waste
and dust and incapacity of Australia House
lie in having too many New South Wales
incapables as High Corummissioners. When
there wasn’t a N.S.W. man in office there
was a Queenslander, with a peevish N.S.W.
politician as Prime Minister, either sending
him directions or rushing “Home” to direct
in person. The fact that, despite all this
muddle, Victoria makes a show at the big
Australian barn is easily explained. When
the barn was built it had space to spare,
and the States were asked to rent some of it,
thus reducing the loss and bringing all the
Commonwealth under one roof. Victoria
and others assented, and moved in sociably.
N.S.W. grumped as usual, just as it did
when it started the diverse railway gauges
and wben it refused to join in the scheme to
pool borrowings in war-time in order to
prevent reckless competition. It preferred
to pay rent to an English private landlord
rather than to the Commonwealth. It didn’t
want to be mistaken for part of Australia.
It wasn’t even officially aware that the Com-
monwealth existed. So Victoria, as the
Commonwealth’s tenant, hangs out its sign
on the building as tenants generally do,
while the State Government of N.S.W. has
no more rights there than Honduras or
Poland. And if people mistake Victoria for
the owner of the whole show, so much the
better for the Cabbage Garden. Being on
the spot, too, the Victorian A.-G. perhaps has
facilities for seeing that his State’s exhibits
are a little fresher than Methuselah. —
Yours, etc., Sol. M.
“El Verdugo’s” right cross:—
I hereby nominate “Politicus,” who says (B.
28/12/’22) that my recent estimate of Theodore and
Lane “excites the derision of those who know,’’
for the Ancient and Humorous Order of Mott and
Jeff. Lane’s reputation for originality does not
rest on his New Australia experience. It has a
sounder foundation in his publicity and organising
work, which shows him to have been the first man
of authority in the Queensland party to vision a
line of Labor development thoroughly adaptable to
the Australian mentalitv. I say this advisedly,
after having systematically read every scrap of Ms
writings identifiable in Brisbane, besides discussing
him fully with those of his leading contemporaries
who were alive within the past decade or so. The
South American travesty is something difficult to
explain in the face of his previous work. Whether
my estimate of Theodore is right or wrong time
alone will show, but he certainly does not knuckle
down to the “Trades Hall bosses,” whose conse-
quent sourness has apparently not yet seeped through
into my adversary’s inner circle of omniscience. 1
am not surprised at that when even a man like J.
H. C. Sleeman, who had been three years publicity
secretary of the Northern National Union, was appa-
rently in profound ignorance of the people with
whom he was dealing. However, the remark which
finally condemns “Politicos” to oblivion is his care-
less assertion that my reference to “the camp of
Liberalism wherein Kidston, Kerr, Airey, Holman
and Hughes eventually found themselves” is imagi-
native, and that Kerr and Airey were “fired out of
Parliament because they refused to go with Kid-
ston into the camp of Liberalism.” Since bo(th
Kerr and Airey were Ministers in Kidston’s most
famous Cabinet, along with such colleagues as
Denham and W. H. Barnes, the arch-exponents of
true-blue Liberalism, and remained so until T. J.
Ryan defeated the one and the electors of a South
Brisbane constituency scraped the other off his bench,
shouting that he was more Liberal than the oppo-
nent who defeated him, I think “Politicus” owes
me an apology.
“Tauwarra” : The 8.0. T. inquiry into
the Egypt disaster discloses an extra-
ordinary attitude of mind on the part of
British officialdom. The evidence was in-
disputable that the Lascar crew stampeded,
took complete charge of the boats, and could
not be ejected even at the point of the re-
volver. Yet, throughout the inquiry, the
master of the vessel —virtually on his
trial and faced with professional ruin—
stubbornly maintained that a crew composed
entirely of British seamen would not have
behaved i any better than his coolies did.
lhere is not much to choose between them,”
he said, “if the Lascars are properly led!”
.The verdict of the Court was, of course,
a foregone conclusion. Scapegoats had to
be found, and the master and chief officer
were crucified according to the best tradi-
tions of the Board of Trade; the haughty
Inchcape crowd was gently admonished to
be more careful in future, and the calami-
tous but inexpensive nigger, the immediate
cause of the appalling death-roll, was skil-
fully whitewashed. I am driven to the con-
clusion that Captain Collier spoke his piece
with one eye on the boss, and that the Court
was averse from recording its true opinion
for fear of stirring up further trouble for
the British Raj in India. In these days of
shrinking dividends and high operating costs,
the British shipowner has little use for
Merchant Jack, and the fact that 17,000
ot his mates lost their lives to keep Britain
in tucker, the Allied armies in supplies and
their owners in tat profits is conveniently
forgotten.
~e
An ambitious structure is going up in Mel-
bourne to house the note-printing depart-
ment of the Commonwealth Bank, and the
Age gave it a friendly mention the other
day:—
Some astonishment was caused during last session
by the disclosure that elaborate plans of the Federal
Department of Works for a building, provided after
the Public Works Committee had investigated and
reported upon the project, were scrapped and dis-
carded without a word of explanation from the
governor of the Commonwealth Bank, to which the
note-issuing activities had been transferred from the
Treasury. The building recommended by the Public
Works Committee was estimated to cost £44,200,
including engineering services, while other inciden-
tals brought the whole cost to £47,800. The work
was taken out of the hands of the Department of
Works and given to the Commonwealth Bank’s archi-
tects, Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Miller, the latter
being a son of the governor of the bank. Protests
against the wanton waste represented by scrapping
the official plans and the committee’s recommendation
only brought a plea of helplessness from the Gov-
ernment, since the governor of the bank was not
amenable to control like the head of an ordinary
department, but acted under powers conferred on him
by statute... .The edifice is estimated to cost about
£70,000.
Denison Miller, tbe perspicacious gentle-
man who took hold of the governorship of
the new Commonwealth Bank after half-a-
dozen or more bankers, less alive to life’s
possibilities, had refused it, has made an
easy reputation by earning handsome profits
out of an institution with a huge ready-made
business to start upon, no dividends to pay,
and a vast exemption from taxation. And some
of his relatives make something in an easy
fashion also. Whether the firm’s architec-
tural merits are such as to bring it any very
great business apart from what Miller
gives it at the country’s charge is not known
to the man in the street, but the bank owns
one dashed ugly building in Sydney anyhow.
Needless to say it was Hughes, who, as
Attorney-General and virtual Prime Minister,
made Manager Miller the amazing despot
he is, without any board of directors to super-
vise him, though all other banks think a
board absolutely necessary. And Hughes
was always too faint, or too flabbergasted, or
too much resolved never to own up to a mis-
take, to amend his own work, even when his
own department was treated with ground
and lofty and expensive contumely.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Now that the numbers are mostly up the
verdict is that the Hughes party would have
won a glorious victory if it hadn’t been for
Hughes.
“Bildad”: The New Year’s greeting of
the Irish Free State Government to its lov-
ing subjects was mainly a declaration of its
resolve to put down disorder with a hand
like a mastodon’s ear. The execution of re-
publicans and rebels and dynamiters and
gunmen goes on in a brisk fashion that
surprises those accustomed to the niggling,
half-hearted methods of the Saxon oppres-
sor. To be found in possession of arms is
a conviction in itself. I am not sure that
the same applies to being found on licensed
or unlicensed premises, or leaving the side
door open on Sunday, or throwing news-
papers and picture-show dodgers on to
people’s lawns, but I expect it does. And
as a result there hasn’t been one Free State
Minister shot for over a week.
In the maddening slowness of the Senate
count the rout of the llugheseliers in that
Chamber has, to some extent, been obscured.
Yet it was even more humiliating than the
fate of the ex-Labor rabble in the House of
Reps. Of that unhappy band, which three
months ago was composed of Burchell (re-
tired), Bamford, Blundell. Chanter, Foley,
Higgs, Lamond, Boynton, Story and Laird
Smith, one, at least (Bamford), was re-
turned by the skin of his teeth. But the
seven ex-Labor Senators who faced the elec-
tors were all beaten. Not only that, but
their poll of No. 1 votes was contemptible.
Thomas (N.S.W.) got 0062 out of 560.080
effectives; Plain (Yic.),9861 out of 458.176;
Senior (S.A.), 2426 out of 134,212; Earle
• (Tas.), 4116 out of 46,934; and the Westra-
lian three, Henderson, F*e Larsie and Buza-
cott, 1262, 2030 and 3778 respectively out of
70,936. If these figures don’t put the
Liberal-Nationalists wise to the ioke that has
been played at their expense since 1917
their case is hopeless, and they should imme-
diately consult a brain specialist.
Nearly every Sydney paper last week
whooped over the Statistician’s announce-
ment that the population of “Greater Syd-
ney,” which includes Parramatta, had
passed the million, and that the metropolis
proper now held 950,000 people. Not one
of them went into sackcloth and ashes; yet
they all might well have done it. For
whereas this overgrown wen holds almost
exactly half the population of the State,
London has but one-tenth of the population
of Biatain, Paris one-thirteenth of France's,
and Rome one-sixtieth of Italy’s. And the
position is not much, if any, better in the
rest of Australia. With a population which
has only just craw-led past 5,000,000 we
have 2,460,000 in the capitals, barely missing
a proportion of one in two, whereas the
European capitals hold less than one in 18,
and even then most of them reckon they are
horribly over-crowded—as in fact they are.
“Oscar O.’s” melancholy vision :—•
The surprise of the Vic. elections was Bendigo. A
week before polling-day Hurry’s chances were confi-
dently rated at about a hundred to one against.
Almost everybody expected it to be a straightout go
between Jude and Jowett. The tragic element was
supplied by the latter. He took his defeat gamely,
but on the result being made known he lost no time
in leaving the loathly place. So anxious was poor
Edmund to catch his train that he bundled his
luggage on the top of the nearest vehicle available,
which happened to be a butcher’s cart. Melancholy
was the vision of the best-dressed man in the House
sitting amongst the plucks and the pigs’ feet on his
dismal way to the station.
A sort of record capsized person was one
Withers (not “the individual Withers” of
“Locksley Hall,” but another), who made a
fitful appearance recently in the S. M.
Herald. He entered on his head with his
hat on both feet to denounce the New State
movement in the north of N.S.W. as the
tvicked work of disloyalists and Laborites.
'Why it should be disloyal to seek to add
another State and an up-to-date State
metropolis to his Gracious Majesty’s glorious
dominions on which the sun never sets only
an old-type Sydney geebung could tell. And
it was wild and nvoolly to blame the move-
ment on Labor —Labor which threatened
through the roar of Minister Estell to stop
all expenditure in the North and use the
place for tax-collecting purposes only if he
heard any more New State talk, and which
proposes to abolish the existing State Govern-
ments. that at Sydney included, instead of
founding fresh ones.
The demand of the Sydney tramw-ay con-
ductors that they should not be called on,
like other toilers of the Department, to
resume 48-hours-per-week service has some
reason. On cars with interior corridors 48
THE RESPITE.
“Thank heavens, that sort of Christmas comes hut once every three years!”
hours would be fair enough, but no humane
person would ask even a fly to hang on
to the footboard of a precipice for so long
as that.
By Cabinet direction, an award of the
Vic. Railway Wages Board, which knocks
sixpence a day off the pay of employees re-
ceiving under £460 a year, was made opera-
tive from New Year’s Day. What effect this
will have on other industries it is difficult at
present to say, but it has stilled the clamor
in other branches of the Vic. service for
“more.” The net saving, after allowing for
concessions granted, will be £65,000 for the
six months of the half-year to run.
If the advice given by manager Williams
is adopted by the Vic. Cabinet, the plant at
the State beet-sugar factory at Maffra will
be remodelled at a cost of between £75,000
and £lOO,OOO. The outlay is departmentally
considered justifiable because of the Mac-
allister irrigation scheme, which will make
beet-growing safe within easy distance of
the factory, irrespective of the rainfall. At
first the factory was a failure, and Allan
McLean and others who put money into it
went down, but the State, s ; nce 1913,
made an accumulated profit of £20,186. In
five of the 10 years there were losses aggre-
gating £21,640; and in the other five years
profits totalling £41,826. But what will
happen if there is a slump in sugar? Wil-
liams answers this question by pointing to
the success of beet production in parts of
the U.S.A.
“0.K.”: Before the blessed political par-
ties have settled the question of how Billy
is to be pushed from his perch I want to ask
again about that extra £300,000 on “im-
provements in the postal service.” What
are we getting for it? Postal service was
never so bad and so costly as it is to-day.
The reduction in the Saturday service has
practically put the lid on a pot of public
grievances—or what would be public griev-
ances if the pubhc took more interest in its
own business. Letter collections and de-
liveries are fewer than they were when each
State ran its own postal business. Dis-
appearances of valuables sent by mail are as
proportionately frequent as the theft of
goods in railway transit. And still Treasurer
Bruce had the face to allege that £300.000
of his alleged surplus was devoted to “im-
provements in the postal service!”
“Griffith Moses”: These United States
politicians are a queer lot. The war
found little Norway a neutral, the fourth
largest shipowner in the world. Foreign
countries borrowed its ships at times,
when found in their harbors, on the
plea of necessity, and Norway’s bill against
the U.S. was arbitrated on at the Hague in
the ordinary fashion, the U.S. being, of
course, a member of the court. When the
majority awarded the little Power between
two and three millions for vanished ships,
deterioration and loss of war earnings, there
was “considerable unpleasantness, due to
the American arbiter’s protests”—presum-
ably on the ground that the court existed to
give judgments in favor of Uncle Samuel.
“A delicate situation arose.” However,
after 82 days of tension, it was announced
that Norway wouldn’t be bashed on the ear
for winning the case. The U.S. “would
take its medicine like a good fellow,” and
pay the trifle. Plenty of quite ordinary
every-day fellows would have sent along the
cheque weeks ago, instead of beginning with
a wrangle and ending with a self-presented
bouquet.
Billy Hughes tells an Argus interviewer
he is in favor of the defid past burying its
dead:—
Dead pasts their dead may bury, yes,
But we’ve not seen as yet
A dead past which, poor man to bless,
Is burying its debt.
Quite a burst of excitement came to pass
in land-settlement and Million-farming
circles when it was reported that 1061 appli-
cations were made for a Government grazing
farm in the Armidale (N.S.W.) district, on
which £29 per year rental was payable for
the first 15 years. This doesn’t seem to
prove much except that there will always be
a rush of applicants, more or less speculative,
for a very cheap property in well-watered
country, especially if there is a prospect of
turning it into freehold at a not very distant
date. It may also suggest that people in
districts which are three times as far by rail
from an available port as they might be
prefer grazing on large areas to small farm-
ing. Then the usual wet blanket wrote to
the press to mention that the New England
tableland, on which Armidale stands, had
1193 fewer persons engaged in farming in
1922 than in 1912; that 287 small farmers
had apparently sold out to larger farmers:
and that 325,140 acres of State land had
gone out of use in nine years. Settlers with
gaunt land-famine written on their counte-
nances are always rushing on the soil at the
rate of 1061 applicants per cheap Govern-
ment farm, but, apparently, as soon as they
can make some sort of a deal, they rush oft
at the other side. Then they possibly come
round to the front and make another dash.
The tragedy of the unexpected;—
One or two fancy electoral devices for grappling
Hughesite Senators to their seats crashed horribly
last month. With the idea of discouraging Liberal
opposition to persons like De Largie, Henderson and
Buzacott, it was arranged that the names of these
and other dried-up old party hacks should be grouped
on the ballot-papers. The excuse was that “it would
simplify the voter’s task and reduce informal voting
to a lr imum.” But the grouping business failed
miserably to dissuade new men from taking a
chance; and the effect on the electors was such that
the proportion of informal votes (it amounted to
10 per cent, in N. S. Wales) was higher than ever
before. And the National Federation has a dreadful
impression that the bulk of the rejected votes were
anti-Labor. Another “improvement’’ allowed the
elector to cease Are when he had marked his seventh
preference. The result was that huge stacks of
Nationalist ballot-papers were cast out when the
need was greatest, and Labor candidates were enabled
to struggle home by narrow margins, or, as in the
case of Needham, in Westralia, by hundreds short
of a majority of the votes polled. The catch in
preferential voting is that unless it is made com-
pulsory all along the line the representative of a
minority may squeeze in. This was shown in West-
ralia when that country experimented with the
optional method, but when the Hugheseliers _ were
making their hurried arrangements they didn’t re-
member it.
As it seems to The Bulletin :
(1) Though there were several parties asking for
votes, those parties can be grouped under two heads
—Labor and Anti-Labor.
(2) Labor is in a distinct and definite minority.
No section of the Anti-Labor group is justified in
doing anything which would put the Labor party
in office.
(3) The Country party, though, like the Nation-
alists, elected by anti-Labor votes, is an entity, it
is not justified—at any rate, in the first resort
in merging itself in the Nationalist party, the com-
bination proceeding to choose a common leader, etc.,
by a majority vote. It has got to make terms —or
try to.
(4) It is doubtful whether the Nationalists are
a party at all. They were a war-time coalition
formed in desperation to meet the circumstances of
the moment.
(5) Hughes was the leader of one element in this
coalition. What the country thinks, rightly or
wrongly, of this element is shown by the defeat
of every member of it except Bamford and Hughes
himself; and Hughes only saved himself by flight.
(6) The first duty of the so-called National party
is to consider the question of leadership. And it
must consider whether it will have the man who
came into the coalition as the chief of a party
which the country has passed judgment on and wiped
out of existence.
(7) And as the country has charged the anti-
Labor forces to carry on, and as the co-operation of
the Country party is essential to that end, the
Nationalists are under an obligation to consult the
Country party in the matter of leadership.
(8) If Hughes is not acceptable to the Country
party it ought to formally say so.
The Priminister’s delay in meeting his party
is attributable to the desperate hone that he
might have the assistance in caucus of one
or two of the seven ex-Labor Senators who
ambled to their doom last month. That
resource having failed him, it is incumbent
on him to move without any more waste of
time. The Government is in ruins, the
Nationalists are without a majority, and
events cannot wait on his indecision in-
definitely.
The “Trade” has a skilful handler in ,T.
J. Liston, as was shown when the Liquor
Bill was before the Vic. Assembly. Though
never obtrusively in evidence, Liston played
off the Ministerialists against the Laborites,
and vice versa, with such adroitness that the
bill had a flying passage through both Houses.
Once, however, Liston pressed his advantage
almost too far, and had to retreat, but the
retreat was carried out with care. Having
secured the adoption of State-wide polls.
Prendergast moved to substitute a 10 years’
truce for the septennial period proposed in
the measure. The Government put its back
up. It was a ease of taking eight years or
having the bill thrown in the w.p.b. The
Liston party capitulated, and the alteration
was made, at the instance of Lawson him-
self. Apart from his job of warding off pro-
hibition Liston is Mayor of Williamstown.

he likes. He doesn’t like.

INTRICATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His mien suggested care, a heap,
As in he edged where we were drinking;
Beneath his eyes were hollows deep,
From insufficiency of sleep
Or, possibly, excess of thinking,
Or both. Quoth he: “It gets my goat,
The way they count the Senate vote.
“Yet in my youth—a whisky, please !
No rats were in my cranial attics.
Logarithms and indices,
Cube roots and surds and things like these
Were quite my favorite mathematics.
But now I have to own I can’t
Explain how Millen bested Grant,
“Or Grant Josiali Thomas pipped
With scarce three thousand votes to sunder ’em.”
A tear rolled down his cheek; he sipped
His forty drops like one who’s tripped
Over some intricate conundrum
And on his brow the furrowed lines
Stood out for mental torture’s signs.
“It beats,” he said, “the blooming maze
At Hampton Court. It puts it over
The Sphinx’s riddle, spare me days 1
And Browning’s poems and Ibsen’s plays
And puzzles such as ‘Pigs in Clover.’
The way our Senators are picked,
I’ll swear would have old Euclid licked.”
Oh, fearsome were the things he said,
Being now in grog a trifle far gone,
On pref’renees distributed,
Progressive totals, groups that led,
Quotas—and such appalling jargon.
Last, of exhausted ballots he
Was gibbering excitedly.
He seemed excessively distressed
Like one who tells some hideous dream.
I left him where the bar we breast,
And put our trilbies on the rest,
And still the burden of his theme
W’as: “S’truth, it gets a fellow’s goat,
The way they count the Senate vote!”

The Colonial Mutual is another Austra-
lian insurance co. which discovered that
marine underwriting in London was not all
it looked. The directors misjudged the risky
business: “they had been pressed to go in
for marine insurance in London... .the busi-
ness had been established at a wrong time,
and operations had, unfortunately, resulted
in a loss.” When the tide began to run
out rapidly, the directors hastened to steer
clear: they took steps “to discontinue or
cancel those risks which had proved unre-
munerative.” Consequently premium in-
come for the year showed a big decline, and
both loss and cost rates were abnormally
high:—

Claims and expenses together took 10S.1 p.e.
of net premiums, resulting in a loss of
£21,583. Interest contributed £23,295, so
the profit for the period was only £1712.
Twelve months ago The Bulletin re-
viewed the dividend distributions of eight
Australian insurance offices, and showed that
in only one other co. have shareholders taken
so large a proportion of profits. For 1921
the Colonial Mutual, in order to give its
proprietors 374 p.e. on their cash-paid capi-
tal, had paid away 77.3 p.e. of net earn-
ings, the whole of the net interest income
and £13,564 of the £24,560 underwriting sur-
plus having been absorbed. Since 1910
£200,003 of reserves have been capitalised,
increasing paid capital to £300,008. De-
spite the adverse run, shareholders have not
been denied a taste for the past year: profits
amounted to only £1712, nevertheless share-
holders received £22,501, £20,000 of it being
found by reducing the reserve for unexpired
risks from £50,000 to £30,000. That reserve
is now equivalent to only 11.3 p.e. of last
year’s net premium income, instead of the
40 p.e. customary among insurance offices.
In addition to that £30,000, however, is
£lOO,OOO in general reserves, the two to-
gether representing almost 50 p.e. of pre-
miums, which should mean that, assuming
the office ceased policy-writing, reserves
should be ample to cover claims which might
reasonably be expected from contracts wh eh
have not expired. The main point is that
the investor weighing the Colonial Mutual
assets, must not regard the whole of the
£30,000 of general reserves as the assured
property of proprietors.
The payment of divs. which were not
earned has reduced reserves below the level
of those held three years ago. The big dis-
tributions to shareholders and the recent set-
back have also resulted in only £62,823 hav-
ing been added to reserves in the abnor-
mally favorable underwriting period since
1914, compared with £157,568 of profit which
had been accumulated in the previous eight
years. So, one way and another, the Colonial
Mutual has not been developed to the extent
which might have been expected of a co.
which has been writing policies almost half-
a-century. Nevertheless, from the published
accounts it appears to be a thoroughly satis-
factory office from the point of view of policy-
holders. Its funds total £430,978, equal to
162 p.e. of net premium income, and 12
points higher than the standard generally
considered desirable. Put another way,
funds are sufficient to cover claims exceed-
ing 2$ times last year’s losses.
During, the year there have been some
changes in the investments: new premises
are in course of erection, and at September
30 £20,831 more was in property :•>—

The amount shown as written off each year
is the portion of the carry-forward which
disappears. For w'hat purpose these cuts
are made is not disclosed. Even assuming
that they are a genuine charge against earn-
ings, and not an addition to internal re-
serves, the co. is doing very well indeed.
Last year, for instance, interest contributed
£5680 and the safe-deposit earned £561. These
earnings together exceeded by £241 the amount
needed for the 12 p.e. div. That means
that whatever margin exists between earn-
ings from estates and expenses is available
for strengthening reserves. The outlook for
shareholders is, therefore, very bright, and
they can hope for even better returns later
on. There is nothing fat about the present
rate of div., as this co. adopted the unusual
practice of asking a substantial premium on
all new capital. On total shareholders’ funds
—capital, £50,000 ; reserves, £70,928 —the
£6OOO distributed represents a return of
approximately 5 p.e. By-and-bye the direc-
tors will no doubt follow the lead of other
trustee cos. and weld some of the savings
of 43 years to capital account.
Two other trustee cos*, .yvith influential
backing were established in Adelaide a few
years ago, but their operations have done no
harm to the E., T. and A. of S. Aus. Their
activity has popularised the trustee co., and
may possibly have indirectly assisted to
bring in new r business to the pioneer. Dur-
ing the past 12 months there was a net in-
crease in the value of estates of £399,292,
taking the total to £5.105,443. That is
slightly more than double the figures of nine
years ago, when the co. had been 34 years
at work. The funds which protect clients
against loss of principal are in the following
investments : public securities, £85,882 ; pro-
perty, etc., £22.358; book debts and cash,
£10,727; and the safe-deposit with a book
value of £2593.

The directors’ reports for the past two years
have announced their decision to pay 2| p.e.
discount on purchases by ordinary share-
holders. But the accounts do not reveal,
as they hitherto have done, the amounts
distributed. The co. appeared to have done
exceptionally well during the years of
rising values and war prosperity. The
directors were so confident that the war-
time winnings were the co.’s for keeps that
at the height of the boom they rushed
£59,000 of reserves into capital account. A
lot of new capital was also raised. For the
two years since values crashed, the manage-
ment has been able to dig out only £13,928
of profit after having written down stocks.
The cum. prefs. have had their 6 p.e. and
ordinaries an average of only 2% p.e. p.a..
but £24,602 has been extracted from re-
serves to make these distributions. The co.
is now. not nearly so well equipped to earn
good divs. as it used to be. It is carrying
more capital than the business at present
actually requires, and no less than £120,744
of funds are invested in 4£ p.c. Maoriland
War Loan and other investments, but what
comprises those “other investments” and
how much is represented by them is not
disclosed. Without that information no
satisfactory survey can be made of the busi-
ness. But, apparently, one-sixth of all
assets is earning a low rate of interest, and
under these circumstances the co. cannot be
expected to give shareholders handsome re-
turns under altered trading conditions. The
co.’s position would have been much snugger
if reserves had not been tapped to provide
bonus scrip. However, the U.I.C. survived
the period of slump much better than many
similar businesses.
This shows balance-sheet movements for
the past three years and since 1915:

The latest accounts disclose that of the lia-
bilities £48,000 represents mortgages on pre-
mises. Owing to the large volume of Gov-
ernment securities and “other investments”
the co.’s position from the point of view of
creditors is very comfortable. At the
August balance there were liquid assets with
a book value of £451,232 to back £97,597
of liabilities apart from mortgages. To pay
6 p.c. on prefs. and 8 p.c. on ordinaries now
requires almost £30,000 p.a., which is only
several thousands less than the average
profit of the two boom years. Of course,
the selling connection has been considerably
expanded since then.

Since 1915 capital has remained stationary
at £128,000, and on that divs. have gradu-
ally improved from 7 p.c. until for the past
year 10 p.c. was distributed. But, though
profits are better by about a thousand than
the average of a few years ago, the business
is no larger: advances at September 30 were
only a couple of hundred more than in 1914.
The society apparently found difficulty in
raising cheap funds during the war period,
and by 1920 deposits in the co.’s care had
been halved. A little extra has since been
added, but at the latest balance the manage-
ment had £36,791 fewer deposits than eight
years ago. Nevertheless, accumulated profits
and sale of old properties have enabled the
co. to restore its lending connection to pre-
war level. Here are balance-sheet compari-
sons for a number of years:—

Cash, etc. 8,006 3,523 10,163 3,763 1,354
The reserves of £70,189 are equal to £55
per £lOO of capital, and are responsible for
the good rate of div. paid. These reserves
are not wholly profits accumulated from
building-loan business. The Federal is a
reconstruction of a wreck of the ’nineties.
Capital was written down 18 years ago to
£26.488 below a valuation of assets at
that date. That amount was placed in re-
serve, presumably to cover any losses result-
ing from the sale of properties in possession,
which had a book value of £37,415 12 months
after the re-adjustment. Values recovered
so well that profits, instead of losses, re-
sulted, and these surpluses and the original
provision have assisted the accumulation of
large reserves. The Federal appears to be
comfortable from all points of view, and as
the major portion of the quarter-million-odd
of advances is business which has been on
the books for several years and more, during
which re-payment instalments have been
flowing in, the society has not been exposed
to any extent to whatever risks are attached
to loans granted on recent inflated values.
The concern is also in a sound position to en-
large its lending connection when the direc-
tors feel inclined to seek additional funds.
Further deposits can be invited with assur-
ance of sound security: at September 30
there were assets with a book value of
£253,210 to protect £48,071 of deposits—
five guineas worth for every £1 borrowed.

The directors offer no explanation of the
decline of profits since 1920: £6319 ta £4995
and now £3447. The advances business has
grown a. few hundreds, but evidently sales
of side-lines have been fewer, while exes,
have expanded. The ■ Australian Mont de
Piete is a curious business: paid capital is
only £31,210, and at the balance reserves
amounted to £5559, giving total funds of
£36,769. But in city and suburban proper-
ties alone £51,754 has been invested. To be
a lender the co. is itself necessarily a heavy
borrower. No less than £67,550 was owing
on various accounts at October 31, and this

Of the £11,346 “other liabilities” £8137 was
bank overdraft. Though it is apparently a
very comfortable business, the financing of
it is not so sound as it might be. Repay-
ments of loans are no doubt large in volume
over short periods, but unless deposits are
firmly tied to the business, the smooth-run-
ning of lending operations would appear
liable to disturbance should the bank not
oblige by stretching the overdraft. Besides
the £19,814 of deposits and £8137 overdraft
at October 31 —cash on hand amounted to
only £lO96 —the management had committed
itself to paying £1560 to shareholders on
December 19. The business could obviously
do with additional capital, and as profits
even on the recent reduced scale, together
with earnings of any new money, should
assure a good return, it is surprising that
the directors have not approached share-
holders for additional funds. On the pre-
sent basis of financing further extensive
lending is restricted. The N.S.W. Mont de
Piete leans very lightly on outsiders. At
.Tune 30 its paid capital was £175,080 and
reserves totalled £33.855. Liabilities
amounted to £17,815. Between 1915 and
1922 its “advances on mortgages, pledges anfi
other securities and other assets” were built
up from £149,515 to £226,041. The N. 8.
Wales concern is paying 124 p.c. regularly
on its capital, £28,125 of which is transferred
profit.

This modest little building society holds no
deposit moneys: it works on a little
of the National Bank’s deposits, and it is
unlikely that that loan is as cheap as money
borrowed direct from the public. At Sep-
tember 30 the bank overdraft amounted to
£1027, and with the exception of a few shill-
ings and £27 of office equipment the whole
of that overdraft, £10,676 of capital and
£566 of reserves had been advanced to
clients. Interest and other earnings gave
£948 last year, and £384 of that went in
exes., leaving just enough to pay 6 p.c. on
old paid-ups, 7 p.c. on a new issue, and 5
p.c. to investor members. They are poor
returns, but the best that can be expected
in a little co. which has not the command of
large cheap funds.

N. S. Wales Mines Department report
for 1922 states that the sold yield for the
year will show a decline on that of IJ2I
(£217,330), “but this branch of the mining
industry -is now much reduced in. import-.
ance, seeing that it only represents about 1£
p.c. of the value 6f all minerals produced.
The value of the mineral production gener-
ally will be about the same as that for
1921.

At the Barrier the year opened with all the
cos. doing some productive work, with the
exception of Block 10 and Block 14. Maxi-
mum production is being continued oy Norcn,
South, British and Central. The Prop, re-
mains closed underground, but is working on
its fast-disappearing dumps. Junction North
is installing new plant for treatment of oxi-
dised slimes. Junction is opening out car-
bonate ore in its upper levels. The dumps
of the Zinc Corp. are nearly exhausted, but
it is re-opening the South Bloqks mine.
George Klug returns shortly from England
and America, and it will be interesting to
hear what he has to say regarding the new
Elmore process in which the Zinc Gorp. is
interested. Amalgamated Zinc has a few
months’ work to finish up its old dumps, and
will run on South mine current-production
tailings until the latter’s new zinc plant is
ready.
* # *
The Chemical and Metallurgical Corp., the
English concern which is exploiting the
Elmore process, is preparing for large-scale
tests. Lately attention has been given to effect-
ing improvements in the experimental works,
to making the plant automatic in some of the
important stages of the process, and to in-
vestigating the possibility of utilising by-
products. The prolonged negotiations with
the Burma Corporation have been finalised,
and it and the Zinc Corporation have agreed
to give the process a trial on a commercial
scale. The experimental plant is capable of
treating about 51 tons per day; but works
to handle six or seven times that ciuan-
tity are going up at Stratford (Eng.)
and, under supervision of the two mining
cos., should commence treatment of hundreds
of tons of ore within a few months. The
technical staff of the Chemical and Metal-
lurgical Corp. is stated to have the “utmost
confidence” in success:—
We shall be enabled to carry out, on a commercial
scale, the production of several lead and zinc pro-
ducts that have great value by reason of the purity
with which they can be produced in the ordinary
operation of the process. Particularly is this so in
the case of the zinc residues remaining after we have
taken out the lead and silver.... Criticism of the
process has been most helpful. It drew attention to
the relative great importance in some cases of the
silver recovery, and lead our staff to the long re-
searches which ended in the highly satisfactory recov-
ery of the silver as a part of the main process. In
the same way the not quite so friendly criticism
which suggested as a serious defect the possible diffi-
culty of converting the lead sulphate, which is the
end product of the process, into metallic lead, was
the spur which brought out the method we have
devised for making our end product metallic lead, in-
stead of lead sulphate, with much less loss or cost
than can be claimed for any of the other methods at
present employed.

Mount Boppy, Canbelevo. (N.S.W.), has
been closed down finally. During the past
year the co. won £25,244 of gold from
accumulated slimes and “such portions of
the lode as could be profitably extracted,”
but where the profit comes in is not clear,
the expenditure for the term being £27,306.
The co. had investigated new properties, but
nothing important had been discovered. An
area of 25 acres had been acquired at Muriel
Tank, “but the directors do not attach any
importance to the claims.” The co.’s last
hope, as far as Australian investigations are
concerned, seems to lie in a Gundagai pro-
position, but it will be surprising if that field
of many disappointments provides a show
which will satisfy the cautious, experienced
Mount Boppy manager.
* • * * *
It is reported by the N. S. Wales Mines
Department that a “very promising” copper
lode has been discovered by H. B. Thomas
about half-a-mile south of the old Cadia
mine. The lode, which varies from 12in. to
2ft. wide, consists of high-grade sulphide.”
A co. has been formed to exercise a six-
months’ development option. If copper-
mining presented more attractive features
this is a field which might command atten-
tion, an important feature being that all the
ore carries gold in appreciable quantities.
* -* * *
The pertinacity with which the Coal Vend
fought against A. Holland’s intrusion oft
what they assumed to be their sacred pre-
serves on the Maitland field, is now readily
understandable. They must have known
more than the lessee-vendor did—that the
negotiations for the acquisition of 2360
acres surrounded by their best collieries were,
on behalf of a probable formidable rivals
the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. To avert,
this, if possible, they were almost reckless
in their expenditure on legal processes; every ,
trivial formality was contested in the War-
den’s Court, and it is estimated that not
less than £5OOO was spent on barristers’ fees
by both sides. The ownership of a big coal-
mine is essential to the B. fl. Prop, steel-
works, both as a convenience and an economy,
but this in itself would be a matter of small
concern to the Coal Vend. The factors winch
are disturbing them are the knowledge that
the co. is negotiating for other coal-areas
aggregating five figures, and that there has
been no contradiction of the published state-
ment that they contemplate carrying on a
coal-selling business irrespective of the Vend,
in which way it is obvious that they can
administer a nasty blow to them. This means
that, in the immediate future, there is to be
a battle of giants in the coal business —the
Vend, the B. H. Prop, and the Miners’ Asso-
ciation.

Westralia starts this year with better
prospects than it did the one just ended.
Twelve months ago Kalgoorlie was paralysed,
Hampton Plains almost deserted, and most
other fields dead or nearly so. Since then
several good strikes, including some which
have been kept dark, have been made on the
Boulder Golden Mile, new gold discoveries
have been reported in at least a dozen differ-
ent districts, a new mine of some^promise has
been opened up on Block 45, Hampton
Plains, and the Sons of Gwalia is about to
resume production and give the State’s gold
ouput a much-needed lift. Had the big cos.
continued work cheerfully under the much-
maligned Burnside award and the subse-
quent Draper award, instead of sulking
and going slow when the gold premium was
Substantially higher than it is to-day, every-
body would have been much better off.

North Fingall, which development work
years ago proved worthless and which an ill-
advised Melbourne co. took up last year, has
been closed, and the plant is for sale. Later-
on shareholders will be called together, and
something will probably be said about the
great uncertainty of mining. Had a proper
inquiry into the past history of the property
been made at the outset all the money spent
on development and plant would have been
saved.

The defunct Black Range Co.’s cast-off,
the Pinnacles, at Jasper Hill (W.A.), is
to be given another trial. Backed by
the late Hans Irvine and others, the Black
Range acquired the show in 1916, and drove
a level at 100 ft., where the shoot was offici-
ally reported to be nearly 800 ft. long, over
4ft. wide, and worth about 15dwt. per ton.
Later on, the profit in sight was estimated at
£lOO,OOO, but after a few thousand tons had
been crushed for a return much lower than
had been expected the mill was shut down
and the mine abandoned.

The accounts of Hampton Gold Mining
Areas, Ltd., which owns Block 48, on which
the Golden and White Hopes are situated,
showed a debit balance to March 31 last of
£16,959. At a shareholders’ meeting held in
London on November 27 it was decided to
write off this loss, together with preliminary
expenses and capital unrepresented by avail-
able assets, and to reduce the capital of the
co. from £500,000 to £300,000 (of which
£lOO.OOO will be unissued!. The £1 shares
are to be divided into 1,200,000 shares of ss.
each, and holders of the issued £1 shares will
receive 2s. 6d. in cash and two ss. shares.
After this return of capital the co. will have
about £20,000 on hand. A plebiscite taken
before the meeting showed that shareholders
almost unanimously favored the return of
capital.
Hampton Gold Mining Areas was an early
Hampton Plains float out of the office of
Lionel Robinson, Clark and Co. Once the
old Hampton Uraguay, it stood as a vener-
able relic of the Golden Mile boom until the
Celebration was opened up. The Celebra-
tion gave it second wind, and, incidentally,
provided the opening for a profitable recon-
struction for those who slid out on the boom.
The co. issued 400,000 £1 shares, more than
half of which went to the old Uraguay crowd.
White Hope and Golden Hope hold then-
leases from the Areas, but the gilt in them
is so tarnished that now they don’t qount
for much. .

From John H. Scotland, secretary of Ives
Reward (W.A.) :
In reply to “0.8.’5” criticism (B. 21/12/’22),
I would just like to draw your correspondent's
attention to the following statement made by Jno.
T. Lutey, M.L.A. for Brown Hill, Ivanhoe, in the
Legislative Assembly on November 22, 1922, during
the debate on the Estimates of the Mines Depart-
ment: . <" ........
regards the St. Ives field, ..where ~ I have been
'•underground, • I"'can say from personal knowledge
that Reward is going to''turn out one of
the best mines in Australia. ' There huge lode,
and 1000 toiis, the product of . deVelopiSert work,
have averaged 16dwt.~ Geologists~'are £&nfideht that
the lode will live :dbwij.'~'-It is regrettable-that the
co. has not the capital to equip-- the mine with com-
and,. .drills, permitting much faster develop-
ment th&rthaf Secured under present conditions.
‘-‘0.8..” who is one of the West’s best-
qualified mining critics, will doubtless be
thoroughly convinced by the private opinion
of Lutey, M.L.A.! “ ‘U
** * - *
Kalgurli Gold Mines (W.A.) has been
wound up and n-final distribution of about
2s. 9d. per share will be made shortly. Next
to the Oroya shoot the lvalgurii ore bulge
was probably one of Ivalgoorlie’s richest.
Unlike the Oroya bonanza, however, it was
very short. Nowadays the Kalgurli is the
property of Oroya Links Co., which expects
to make a good profit from the leavings in
the old workings.
Vic. Mines Minister Barnes states that
the outlook for gold-mining for the current
year is “distinctly bright.” He is particu-
larly hopeful that exploratory work at Wal-
halla wdl lead to the district “soon again
coming into prominence.”
* * * *
Hercules, the lyneh-pin of the new floats
of the Bendigo Amalgamated, has a good his-
tory. Up to the time Dyason took it over,
divs. were £181,394 against calls of £73,768.
Now it includes Victoria Consuls and the
Ironbark claims, which together to the same
date showed £233,000 of uivs. against £100,641
of calls. The Central Blue and Ironbark
runs of stone pitch through the claim at shal-
low depths, but the best stone was got out
long before the Dyason merger. For two
years work has been directed trying to knock
profits out of the run of stone between 1300
and 1500 feet. From a big formation that
makes up to 30ft. wide 6dwt. quartz has been
sent to the battery. Although this might
have about met exes, in the good old days, or
with a big premium on gold, it is nothing
now. The co.’s programme is to push along
with the 13S0ft. level, which has given some
7-ldwt. samples close to a fault. The axiom
in old Bendigo used to be to get out on any
share spurt when yields came from gold on a
fault. It may be well to recollect that bit
of wisdom whenever stone from the level is
being dumped into the mill. The north level
at 1520 ft. is now entering the formation on
its pitch. Here the real gamble lies, for
with good stone at depth Hercules may flatter
its followers.
• » * *
A most encouraging item of latest Ben-
digo news is that the new reef in the 600 ft.
south level of the Monument Hill mine is
“showing fair values.” The cap is disclosed
for 10ft. across the apex of the saddle, and
the stone has “an attractive appearance.”
Two reefs have been developed from this
level, and at intervals payable yields have
been obtained. The mine is on the Deborah
reef, which has had very little attention in
the past; it is practically a virgin line, con-
sequently importance attaches to the work
now being done by the Monument and
Deborah cos.
* * * *
“Beehive’s” reply to “Flatsheet” (B.
28/12/’22) :
No exception can be taken to the dictum that
reckless boosting of Bendigo’s prospects is undesir-
able, but 1 must protest against the depreciatory
spirit shown by my critic. Nothing could be more
unjust and ungenerous than his covert sneers at a
Diamond Hill proposition to which I referred. He
must know that the men. associated with this en-
terprise are practical worker's of high repute, whose
names have never been identified with any share-
gambling schemes; that before they sought
outside assistance they spent a considerable sum
on legitimate prospecting work with results, which,
though not sensational, indicate a probability of
fair success, and show a new feature which, on ex-
plorations further afield, may lead to “important”
developments. To assume that the mere statement
of these facts and points may not be “in the best
interests of the field,” smells very much like “stink-
ing fish.”
“Flatsheet” condemns “talking too much or too
loosely.” On the figures which he gives as to widths
and values of New Blue ground, the foot-tonnage
average works out at 18dwt. The battery cannot
be accused of being a lying prophet; last year,
operating on about 26,000 tons, it returned an aver-
age of 14dwt. If this year the mill shows that the
18dwt. prophecy is not “loose talk” shareholders
will have a good time.
It is a coincidence that the co.’s first crush-
ing this year yielded exactly iBdwt. per ton;
the return for four days’ milling last week
being 3650 z. from 406 tons.
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), starts
the New Year with a return of 560 z. from
four fathoms. The wash came from a drive
off No. 1 rise south. That is, it is a sample
from the face farthest down the lead away
from the big bump in the gutter round which
all the gold was washed by the force of the
ancient current. James Mackay pipes out
that the bottom is level and that develop-
ments are satisfactory. So they are, but
there needs to be many more of them: four
fathoms is very little--to chortle over in a
big'ga.mbie. It is possible for the gutter, in
the half-mile from this little patch to the
boundary, to do wonders and pay back a Jot
of the cash sunk in the show T but it isn’t
probable. _ • V

At Brookfield, near. Brisbane, A. syndicate
is still mining in the schist' formation for
gold, are down :35ft. and 20ft.
Sample crushings from each Lave been sent
to Gvmpie, the best of which was 3pz. The
parties are not satisfied, as they reckon some
of the fine gold has been lost in - the. battery
treatment, so another lot will be .sent io a
different centre. In the 35ft. shaft ;'there
has been up to 2ft. of stone, and the samples
obtained have shown probably the best gold
yet obtained from Brisbane schist, which
has never proved to be worth much so far as
a formation for carrying the yellow metal.

Two months ago Ipswich (Q.) coal in-
terests asked Premier Theodore for a re-
bate for vessels bunkering at Brisbane.
For the next 12 months a bait of 9d. per
ton has been held out to shipowners-taking
over 300 tons for bunkering purposes from
the Ipswich district. At first Theodore
jibbed, on the ground that the rebate might
be regarded as unconstitutional by the Fed-
eral authorities. Apparently he has satis
fied himself that it is O.K. Bunkering
at Woollongabba has fallen off 50 p.c. in
three years. The 9d. just about pays for
the difference in the ash content of Ipswich
and Greta run-of-mine coal.

Robinson Bros., of Irvinebank(N.Q.) , who
have the happy knack of dropping on to rich
patches of tip, have unearthed another near
the old Adventure, a good show of other days.
Robinson’s crushing gave 9] tons from
21 tons stone. Simultaneously, the old
Vulcan has .gladdened the hearts of the
syndicate by responding with
a good patch in one of the higher levels.
The Rainbow, a fashionable show of the
Herberton hills, has just cleaned up 101
tons concentrates from GO tons stone. Vigor-
ous prospecting is proceeding throughout the
district.
South Aus. Oil Wells Co. has issued a
balance-sheet showing £2036 spent in over-
head expenses during 12 months. Allowing
£5OO for field management, £695 went in
fees for five directors and for manager’s
salary, while general expenses mopped up
£557. The accounts do not show how much
was spent on boring at Moutajup and Angle-
sea. 11. C. Dod declares that “oil showed
definitely in four bores” at Moutajup. where
“several bottomed in blue shale.” The ter-
tiary series not being thick enough, the
drilling machine was shifted to Anglesea,
south-east of Torquay, where Dr. Pritchard
is boring for the Torquay co. The S.A.O.W.
directors “are thoroughly convinced that oil
docs exist in the Anglesea district, and they
hope a payable pool of oil will be pi’oved
in the near future.”

The bitter words of “Tin Hat” :
The other day, in accordance with Routine Orders,
published at breakfast by the wife, 1 wandered into
one of Melbourne’s biggest fish-a-da-game ware-
houses, arid apprised the descendant of Plato who
waylaid me that I wanted a rabbit. His black eye-
brows lifted in amazement. “ Vunf” he repeated. 1
intimated that one was my limit. Still registering
stupefaction he vanished into the mirk behind his
counter and emerged with an oyster. He was pre-
paring to wrap it up when I stopped him. “I don’t
want an oyster,” I explained fretfully. “I want a
rabbit.” “Arr, yess,” he said, “rai’ebcet,” and
waltzing to the window picked up a schnapper with
one hand and a flathead with the other and stood
holding them suspended by their tails, with
interrogation in his round, dog-like eyes and
the air of one who has solved an intricate
SOME BIBLICAL TRUTHS.
“And do you know your Bible, my child?”
“Oh, yes; an’ I know everything that’s in
it. Sister’s young man’s photo is in it,
an’ ma’s recipe for face-cream, an’ a
lock of my hair cut off when I was a
baby, and the ticket for pa’s watch.”
problem. Tiring of the fellow I, at this
stage, left his emporium rabbitless, and what I
now want to know is: Can’t we keep out some of
these illiterate blighters with the language test 5
A man has to pass an examination before he is
allowed to sell one law’, and in my opinion he
should at least be required, if only in the interests
of the community’s time, to know the English lan-
guage before undertaking to sell rabbits.

“Dial-Sight”: When I read of the desira-
bility of introducing more sensible summer
fashions for men, I cannot but recall the
recent experience of my young friend, Per-
cival. Like Major Hay. ex-M.H.R., Perci-
val wears “nighties.” But he moves in a
circle whose members regard day-shirts as
manly but night-shirts as effeminate. Illo-
gical, even idiotic, I grant you; but con-
ventions were ever like that. An lago-like
friend of Percival’a publ shed the latter's
shameful secret at a seaside boarding-house.
He pinched Percival’s nightie. Morning dis-
closed the errant raiment receiving the bois-
terous attention of the landlady’s two poodles
amid the scornful guffaws of the other board-
ers. Now, why should this derision be aimed
at the person who affects some slight diverg-
ence from normal in the. way of slumber-
wear or what not? Stimulated by a similar
spirit, the small boy yells “Ice-cream” at
the wearer of white ducks, and the unthink-
ing bloke with his hoofs encased in hob-
nailed bluchers pokes borak at the spats of
the Block exquisite. It is a senseless kink,
and my sympathy is all for the Percivals
of this world for their pluck in striking out
along a new sartorial line. And yet for my
own part I prefer to follow the mob; and
it is because there are more persons like
me than there are Percivals that there is a
mob; and the existence of the mob is the
best guarantee that male dress-reform will
never transpire on anything like a revolu-
tionary scale.
“Wilfrido”: The increase of 108 per cent,
in the bankruptcies iu M.L. in 1922 over
those in 1921 (669 cases against 347) is
an indication of the heavy trade depression
experienced in the Shivery Isles. Of last
year’s crop of insolvents, the farmers con-
tributed 193, or nearly 29 per cent., the
motor trade 54, laborers 51 and Maoris 35.
Every year Hori stands well in the fore-
ground in this competition one reason,
doubtless, is that he will do practically any-
thing for the sake of novelty. To most of
him the act of going bankrupt is merely a
new and pleasing sensation, like buying a
new car or getting married,
* * * *
“Widgee”: I rise disrespectfully to sug-
gest that a wet canteen he established at the
western camp, Yalloufn (Vic.), where the
Government pretends to be keeping its thou-
sand navvies “dry.” Yallourn itself may be,
as the Electricity Commissioners claim, “the
most moral village in the world”; but the
“village” is so far only occupied by a tew
dozen families who don't count in the general
scheme of virtue, being half-a-mile or so
from the confines of the big camp. There,
Authority turns a blind e,ve to the blind-
tigers which exist without interference from
the police. The minimum charge for liquors
is 100 per cent, in advance of pub rates,
and everybody in the place knows where to
get booze. Surely it would be better for the
administration to offer facilities for a cheap
“pot.” under proper supervision, than to
permit the prevailing conditions, with drunks
howling up and down the closely-packed
camp-lines at all hours of the day and night.

“M. Magee”: During the past 35 years I
have met many impersonators of Bulletin
contributors of more
or less repute, but
never one who cla'med
to be Henry Lawson,
and only one who
asserted that he was
A. B. Paterson. The
latter was a long,
thin, miserable-looking
Scottish - Australian,
and the most villain-
ous cook I ever knew.
W. H. Ogiivies were
fairly numerous, and
I recollect meeting
some of them long
after the original had
returned to Scotland.
Impostors who swore
they were “6 x 8”
were mostly drunken
hushmen, and the
same applies to the
down-and-outs w h o
sought to persuade the
world, and, inciden-
tally, themselves, that
they were poor old “Scotty the Wrinkler.”
The latter, by the way, were invariably
Scotchmen.

“Aroha Amati” fairly lets himself go:—
The cabled gibe of Sir Bryan Donkin, the great
London doctor, that Maoriland “may be pre-ordained
the last home of the final Puritan” is fairly close
to the bull’s-eye. Certainly Donkin’s bleak wonder
at the existence of a people capable of condemning
as indecent Ettie Rout’s book “Safe Marriage”
would be modified if be knew the Maorilander in
his native lair. The harsh, rigorous climate; the
sombre coloring of sky and land; the stark outline
of the everlasting hills; the squawking chorus of
hungry seabirds round the islands’ billowing rims;
the snow that never melts on the Alpine marches;
the muddy roads; the long, hideously dark nights;
tin damnable frequency of earthquakes; the original
clannish system of settlement; the large number of
imported persons named Tonald; the terrible Sun-
days—all these things have a demoralising influence
on the human soul. Just as the Polynesian viking
lost the gaiety of his tropic birth and evolved into
the Maori, forbidding in aspect, mind and aroma,
so the dour chilliness of European heredity becomes
intensified in that sour environment. The country
; imply swarms with smug, ill-paid, subscription-
cadging parsons. In many places the elders of the
kirk form a local tyranny as complete as that of
the Great Mogul. Scandal flies round the little
cities and towns on wings of wind. And, worst
calamity of all, the atmosphere makes rank the
growth of a particularly malignant and unclean
type of wowser. Than the Compleat Maoriland
Wowser the writer knows of nothing more revolt-
ing physically and morally. He exudes cant and
snuffle from every pore. This abominable creature
is not always a pillar of the conventicle. Sometimes
he is a politician, a business man, a professional prac-

titioner of some sort, a journalist, a farmer, always
with an aggressively glad hand, an abundant invita-
tion of what he calls “good fellowship,” a leering,
lecherous eye, an unctuous tongue, and a barrowful
of diffusive" cackle about his neighbor’s wickedness
or the delicts of the wife of his neighbor’s brother-
in-law. It is such frauds who skittle the
Ettie Routs of this life, and, posing as scandalised
right-thinkers, address mothers’ meetings on the
iniquity of purging marital relations of the “con-
sequences of sin.” I know regiments of them, and
have for years watched their influence working like
deadly bacteria on the community. And this I can
swear to, as a matter of personal knowledge, that one
of the most active wowsers enumerated in M.L.'s
last census has the largest repertoire of unfumigated
anecdotes kept in storage by any individual between
Riverton and the Hen and Chickens.

“Tuan”: Sex psychology is a remarkable
thing. I recently showed Tom Glover’s
“Under the Mistletoe” cartoon (B,
28/12/’22) to some 50 people. Of the
women 90 per cent, immediately focussed
their attention on the mistletoe, while the
other 10 per cent, became absorbed in the
figure of “Office.” But of the_ men every
single one concentrated on the £25,000 watch-
fob of Billy Hughes. Try it yourself.
* * * *
“Flicker” on Rome and Coueism: —
“T.W.” says (B. 28/12/’22) that Sybil Arundale
“must have jettisoned some stoutly-held Church
beliefs” in calling in Coueism to the aid of hei
brother, and he further states that “not a priest in
the Smoke would dare to countenance Coue’s
methods.” There are certainly many ways in which
the Church has opposed Science, from the Dark
Ages to the present day, but in this instance there
is no ground for the charge. Far from opposing
Cou£ism, Rome encourages it. Indeed, the practice
of Suggestion-Therapy was known and made use of
in the Church, before the present vogue for the doc-
trines of Coue. In 19Q3, a French Jesuit, Father
Eymieu, published a work entitled “Le Gouvernment
de Soi-meme,” which contains the following: “The
French Jesuits say, ‘Do not only say “Every day I
grow better and better” (Coup’s cri de cwur), but
act it, even though it may seem at the time to be
mere acting.’ This Is not nonsense, unreality t'.gv
self-deception.” I have never heard of a member
of the Catholic Church making any pronouncement
against Coueism —and in Adelaide I know oi at
least two Catholic doctors who encouvage the prac
tice, without having incurred any ecclesiastical dis-
pleasure.

“T.W.”: Few of us ever saw that 10 bob a
month “Regency money” allowed to British
officers for the i>ur-
pose of drinking the
Boy a 1 health (B.
JL4/12/’22), for the
reason that it was
tapped at the source
and diverted to the
mess fund. About
half-way through the
upheaval, the Drys,
who objected to their
10 bobs being collared
to pay for other
people’s port, got their
way, and the Army
Council instructed
that “Regency money”
should be paid direct
to individual officers.
Even then Drydom
failed to score, for in
every mess there was
an overwhelming majo-
rity of officers simply
thirsting to drink
George’s or anyone
else’s health. They
voted the dole back to
the funds and the
position was as you
were.

“Q uamb i” : The
Mal a p r opisms re-
cently quoted remind
me of an orehardists’
co-operative concern
here in Stanthorpe
(Q.). Two staunch
supporters of the eo.,
out canvassing for
share subscriptions,
were trying to do
business with a lady
of the district, when
it came on to rain.
Bhe asked them inside
out of the wet. “It’s
quite all right, thank
you,” said the spokes-
man, “we’re two very
affa b 1 e gentlemen.'
Stanthorpe is still
arguing about what
be was seeking to con-
vey. Later, when one
of the company’s
meetings were being
held, a grieved cocky
got up on his hind
legs and began to slirg
mud. He was inter-
rup t e d ha 1 f-w a y
through his harangue
by one of the directors, who said: “I
hope you are not casting aspersions on
our secretary.” “No,” said the irate cocky,
“I hain’t casting haspirations on no one.”

INSOMNIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lying awake, while deep the hemisphere
Dips to the gulf of darkness and of sleep,
Most utterly alone, strange friends appear,
Ghostly familiars with me vigil keep:
The slurring passage of belated cars,
A gust that jars the door against the lock,
The splendid night with all its falling stars,
And the loud, restless ticking of the clock.
The pause between the last train and the first,
Soft-brushing winds and pensive, sighing showers,
A little grief, an ache, a passing thirst —
These are the brief companions of the hours.
We wear them down together, Time and I,
In our long watch; we see them all go past;
Minutes and memories are marshalled by
Inexorably, neither slow nor fast.
Then comes the wind by which the leaves are
stirred,
Running before the dawn’s advancing line,
The first, far milkman and the eirliest bird—
The last of all these shadowy friends of mine.
The starry banners, one by one, are furled ;
Swiftly the darkness sickens into grey,
And sole survivor of a vanished world
1 am left stranded, blinking at the day.

“Chris” : In Maoriland there is that rare
being, a man with a perfect set of. natural
teeth. He has a partiality for hard tack
in the matter of nourishment, and has an
almost canine fondness for bones, which he
cracks between his powerful molars as if
they were nuts. After lining up for the
Big Scrap, he was peremptorily ordered one
morning to parade sick. He puzzled his
brains as to what his malady was, and was
mightily piqued to learn that it was merely
his bone-chewers which were to be paraded.
It seems that the military dentist concerned
couldn’t resist the chance of showing these
absolutely perfect rows of teeth to the other
dentists.
HIS EXTRAVAGANT WAYS.
“Can't you hurry a little, dear? You know we can't
afford to keep the taxi waiting.”
“Well, aren’t I always telling you you ought to buy a
car of our own?”
“Damien”: “The Cardinal’s Palace ’ at
Manly (N.S.W.) is to be shorn of a lot of
its glory. In addition to the loss of patron-
age the College will suffer when Victoria’s
priests in embryo begin to be trained at
Werribee, there will shortly be a further
falling off when Dr. Duhig has his own col-
lege in Brisbane. Then, instead of housing
between two and three hundred students,
Manly will have to accommodate only about
50 and the question will arise whether
better use can’t be made of the big place.
The change in the system of training has not
been given three cheers all round. The old
one didn’t get three cheers from everybody
either, because, though priests were trained
for all the dioceses, only the heads in Syd-
ney had a say in the conduct of the place.
Off and on it has been proposed to “nation-
alise” Manly, and take it out of local con-
trol But Rome (or somebody) saw difficul-
ties in the way, and adopted the “provincial
plan instead.

“Yelloc”: How’s this for a long-distance
trek to enlist? My entrant, now a Kan-
garoo Island publican, was contracting
200 miles from Hall’s Creek, W .A.,
when the Huns set about France. He threw
up the job, sold his plant; and with two
horses made a beeline for Wyndham, over
250 miles away. Finding there would be
no boats leaving for either Perth or Darwin
for seven or eight weeks, he shipped as cattle-
man on a steamer for Manila. Arrived
there, he jumped aboard a boat for Hong-
kong, which seemed to be the nearest Brit-
ish settlement. But there was no enlist-
ment going on at Hongkong, and it was five
weeks more before a chance presented or
shipping to Darwin. From thence to Adel-
aide, and the traveller was able to join up
on January 15. 1915. Incidentally, he went
through the whole of the scrap without a
day off duty through sickness or wounds
and was practically all the time a combatant.

“Randolph Rentless”: Countless people
regard beer as the root of all evil, yet in
the 522 deaths into which the Sydney City
Coroner had to inquire last year there were
only 74 for which intemperance was directly
or indirectly responsible. Which, if one
were to adopt the wowser’s line of argument,
might be taken to provide 448 proofs ol
the lamentable results of keening sober. How
many times liquor actually averted a tragedy
is not mentioned or discoverable; but 9110
instance at least has come under my notice.
In the closing days of the old year an agi-
tated female burst into a suburban police
court with the intimation that a certain
man had set out, dead sober, with a carving-
knife and a declared intention of slaying his
wife, from whom he was separated. The
police got busy, and the home where the
crime was to be staged was watched: but
there was no appearance of the husband
until late in the evening, and when he did
arrive he carried nothing more sinister than
a peace-offering of flowers and chocolates.
Diplomatic friends had lured him into a pub,
extracted the knife from his keeping, and
filled him up with booze and domestic affec-
tion.
* * * *
“Dido”: Can you imagine a man having
his life saved by a two-quart pot? No, it
was not full of beer. It was
owned by Ned Howard, _ and
Ned was paddocking a hill of
brown gravel on the Pinafore
lease, Lefroy, Tas. Cribtime
had struck, and Howard was
sitting with his back to the face
fie was working, when several
tons of stuff above him let go
all holds, and slid gently down
on the lone hand. Caber, pass-
ing a little later, noticed a boot
obtruding from the slide, and
in a short time three shovels
were at work. They got How-
ard, and they got him alive,
with his billy jambed over his
face. The lone-hand had been
in the act of drinking when the
fall caught him and held him
just in" that attitude. The
loose gravel would otherwise
have choked Ned, but the billy
acted as a sort of respirator,
a little air percolated through
the broken dirt, and so (God
forgive the lie, if lie it be —
but it was told me by a reput-
able Tasmaniac) Howard was
saved by his billy, which, highly
polished, he still keeps as an
heirloom on his parlor table.

“Stellsby”: Melbourne’s Black Maria has
accepted a new situation. She scours the
highways and byways of the city gathering
drunks to her maternal bosom. As a result of
her Christmastide ministrations all previous
records of registered guests at Russell-street
were broken. Cabmen and taxi-drivers are
despondent, and Bung has been heard com-
; plaining that the innovation will ruin the
beer industry. However, as Maria has signed
on for a long job. Bung may as well con-
serve his wind. Police-Chief Nicholson in-
tends to introduce the colored lady to the
. big football matches next winter.
A DEBATABLE
POINT.
"Why so pensive, little one?”
“Well, Em not quite sure whether to re-
main single and have an old 'young
man' or to marry and have a young 'old
man.'"
“Dial-Sight”: “Senojo’s” reference (B.
14/12/’22) to Melbourne’s dry area reminds
me that the pushing out of Bung and Co.
has given a big financial boost to some of the
chemist shops—the bloat in trade being re-
presented by the purchases of those who have
under-imported their beer, etc., for consump-
tion over the week-end. Tonic wines are
the goods inquired for, and the inquiries at
times are embarrassingly urgent. As one
druggist nut it to me: “It’s all right to a cer-
tain extent, but when they knock me up
after hours for another of McCarnish’s after
getting two bottles earlier in the afternoon
I begin to wonder if I belong to the Phar-
maceutical Society or the Licensed Victual-
lers’ Association.”

“Winkle”: On Christmas Day the Rev.
R. G. Nichols, vicar of St. Mark’s Church
of England, Fitzroy (Vic.), introduced to
his congregation the moving picture, “The
Birth and Main Features in the
Life of Jesus Christ,” as part of
the evening service, and an-
nounced that further suitable
films for the inculcation of reli-
gious truths would be screened
regularly cn Sunday evenings.
Of course, protests have been
voiced by envious clerics of many
denominations, but the Fitzroy
parson lightly bunches all their
outbursts together as “unctuous
sanctimoniousness,” pointing out
that moving pictures form part
of the service in many churches
in England and the United
States, and that, even in Mel-
bourne, no fuss is made when a
service is illustrated by lantern
slides. As the congregation of
St. Mark’s has already increased
from SO to 800, it is certain that
other bethels where there is a
chronic struggle to pay the par-
son will soon put on the same brand of
spiritual counter-lunch.

A large section of South Australian
opinion is angry over the reprieve of Cur-
now, the Maitland murderer. He was a
guest in a farmer’s house, when he entered
the room where one of the daughters was
sitting sewing with the rest, and shot her
dead with a gun, explaining afterwards that
jealousy was the cause, and that he had
meant to do it the day before. lie is only
18; the victim was a year younger. There
was only one possible verdict, but the jury
recommended him to mercy on account of
his age. The usual petition tor clemency
was got up, and the Executive has made it
“life.” Now the newspapers print savage
letters suggesting that, if a deliberate crime
like this does not carry a death penalty,
S.A. ought to apologise to the shade of any-
one it ever has hanged.
“Randolph Rentless”:
Two Sydney youngsters,
13 and 14 years old, who
will probably finish up as
commercial princes, hired
a spring-cart and spent
their Christmas holidays
gathering bottles in Bondi,
Coogee and other beer-
resorts. They carted their
daily harvests away to a
dump they had hired for
the occasion, pending the
re-opening, of the bottle-
yards. The venture came
to an end when their
parents, while motoring
to Cronulla, came unex-
pectedly upon the money-
spinners steering a _ full
cartload of dead marines.
As the parents are afflu-
ent citizens, while the
boys attend one of Syd-
n e y’s most refeened
schools, and as it was
supposed that each day
when they disappeared
they were going to pic-
nics with desirable
friends, the meeting was
intensely painful to all
concerned. But the fact
that the lads could show
a profit of nearly £6O on
their enterprise is be-
lieved to have partially
condoned their lapse into
sordid commercialism.
After all, the measure of
most offences, in a busi-
ness community like ours,
is the precise amount of
monetary disaster in-
volved, and when there is no disaster, but
rather a brilliant financial success, the thing
can hardly be called an offence at all.

“Mr. Ocky”: The boast that Flinders-
street station, Melbourne, is the busiest in
the world has been revived again. Clapp
and his harassed underlings are soon to
make a systematic check of the traffic over a
given period to establish the claim on a
definite footing. What a dreadful distinc-
tion it will be, supposing it is established!
Undoubtedly this monstrosity of a station
is something of a record-breaker in traffic,
but that is at the cost of dragging through
its barriers tens of thousands of people who
should never have to face them at all. It is
the cause, also, of the distressful chronic
tangle of traffic from Swanston-street and
Elizabeth-street. In other cities it is recog-
nised as a bad thing to have one big sta-
tion acting as a magnet for travellers from
north, south, east and west through already
crowded main streets. The sooner that
Flinders-street station and the ramshackle
Princes Bridge station across the road cease
to be record-breakers, if such they are, the
better it will be for the thousands whose
misfortune it is to use Clapp’s demented
suburban system.
A HOPELESS CASE.

THE INTERLOPER’S FATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Oh, murder!” cried the stricken spouse
When Bill was pounding her.
Ily dander such alarms arouse;
My very soul they stir.
I heal'd the sudden summons shrill
And answered quick as thought:
I reckoned it was wrong of Bill—
No husband should his missus kill,
Though he may think he ought.
“Oh, murder!” cried the wife again,
And not without a cause:
Bill’s thumps came down like heavy rain ;
For breath he did not pause ;
He held his victim by the hair,
He bent her on his knee:
The matron, forty, fat and fair,
Gave further vent to her despair;
I shouted, “Let her be!’’
At Bill, with eyes aflame, I flew,
Of reason half bereft:
One blow would knock me out, I knew,
From William’s dirty left.
But not from him I met disgrace,
For when his fist he swung
And drove my features out of place,
His missus rose and scratched my face,
And lashed me with her tongue.
Who interferes ’twixt man and wife
For trouble seems to ask:
To pacify domestic strife
Is no outsider’s task ;
With Bill I cannot fairly cope:
Let him his lady bang;
The Law will stand by her, I hope,
And should Bill dangle on a rope,
Well, I’ll not care a hang.

“Huffin-Guffin”: Who says there’s no-
thing in heredity? Le Souef, sen., was usher
of the Vic. Legislative Council. His sons
are all zoo-keepers.
“Morehead” glances down the list:—
In the new House of Reps, the Bills lick the
Jacks by 8 to 7, and the Jims, with 5, drop into
third place. The Biblical Davids number 4, as also
do the Teds, the two Rileys, father and son, being
among the latter. There are 8 Franks, 3 Georges
and 3 Freds—a pair each of Dicks, Arthurs, Charlies
and Percys, and then follow 30 singles, Tom, Bob
and Harry being amongst them. A knight, and a
Reginald Neville at that, displaced Tom Lavelle.
Dr. Page rejoices in the appellation of Earle
Christmas Grafton, while Bendigo supplies a Geof-
frey in lieu of a Bill. General Sir Granville de Laune
Ryrie fittingly occupies the N. S. Wales seat, War-
ringah: it is one of those constituencies which will
put up with any amount of neglect in consideration of
an ornate representative. Lucien Lawrence Cunning-
ham, Joel Moses Gabb and Parker Moloney are the
curiosities of the Labor party. Werriwa’s Lazzarini
has as his first names Hubert Peter. Josiah Francis
is a Bananaland Nationalist, and Joshua Thomas
Hoskins Whitsitt a Tasmanian Cocky. Eric, Stan-
ley and Austin are Nationalists, while Roland and
Victor are C.P. members. Two capital cities are
honored—Sydney is the first name of Gardner, who
outed W. M. Fleming from Robertson (N.S.W.), and
Melbourne "is the second name of Hughes’s erstwhile
offsider, Bruce.
Mrs. Mary Hardware, who passed out in
Melbourne the other day, was one of 500

Ticonderoga in 1852. The vessel arrived

“Gulmarrad”: David Storey, one of the
Ma State’s new knights, beat Edmund Barton
at an election for Randwick before Federa-
tion. Barton was sore about it, and, in
thanking his supporters, said: “When the
history of Australia comes to be written, the
name of only one of the candidates will be
mentioned, and it will not be the one who
was placed at the top of the poll to-day.”
Later Barton got a seat in the Assembly,
and once Storey interrupted him with the
remark, “That is a lawyer’s opinion.” “And
for that reason likely to be much better
than a hatter’s,” retorted Toby. This net-
tled David, who protested that he wasn’t a
hatter —he was a “merchant.” Whereupon
Barton apologised, and remarked with a
stinging inflection that he always understood
Randwick’s elect icas a hatter.
. “Dido”: Monty Grover has, in a compara-
tively short time, editorially launched and
piloted three big papers to a triumphant issue.
He is now about to take on his fourth, the suc-
cess of which is something the profession is
prepared to bet upon, if only because Grover
is behind it. This virtuoso in his chosen
line worked the Sydney Sun up with the
smallest staff ever associated with a
big metropolitan paper, and when success
dawned and he was in a position to hit out,
equipped his paper with the best collection
of pressmen attainable for love or money.
He saw the comic pictorial associated with
the Sydney publ.cation through to a triumph,
was materially responsible for the leaps and
bounds of the Sunday Sun when it kan-
garooed to signal success, and lately his
Melbourne Sun Pictoktal is boast.ng a cir-
culation approaching 80,000, attained in 15
weeks. The Melbourne Evening Sun is
expected to see the light in April.

CAMERON,

After 40 years’ solid work in the vineyard
Rev. George Hall died in Adelaide the other
day at 65. Coming from Yorkshire via
Maoriland, he had thumped most of the
Methody pulpits in S. Aus., and in 1914
got the top job of his denomination —Presi-
dent of tiie Conference. Brighton circuit
was in his charge when a sudden seizure
closed the book.
Francis Bell, of Maoriland, w r ho becomes
a Grand Cross instead of a mere Knight
Commander, has been the brains, wet-nurse,
guide, boss and chief-engineer of the Massey
Government ever since old Bill adventured
in the shoes of Seddon. He is 71, unctuous,
pompous, rich and capable, and for many
years had the largest practice at the M.L.
Bar. Bell was one of the earliest battlers
in favor of local-option polls in respect to
the sale of liquor over yonder.
“Flicker”: The Bulletin is quite right.
Newbolt’s verses about S. Aus.’s new Gover-
nor threaten to become an infliction. Already
the dailies have been at it. Since the
announcement of Bridges’ appointment to
the throne of the Holy City the Advertiser
has quoted the ballad seven times, the
Register eight, and the Daily Herald
twice. I have not yet heard it recited, but
look forward with dread to the winter.
“Wagtail”: “J.B.’s” nomination for the
Medical Stakes (B. 28/12/’22) —five doc-
tors out of a family of six—is surpassed by
a Bendigo record. The Deravin clan owned
seven doctors in a total of eight sons.
Harold Beauchamp, one of Maoriland’s
latest “knights,” is 64 and looks older. He
started learning the difference between the
debit and credit sides of a cashbook when
very young, but the real chance came when,
with Walter Nathan, he secured control of
the merchants’ business, with shorn r»g and
insurance side-lines, known in Wellington
as Bannatyne and Co.’s. From then he
never looked back, and in due time his large
presence pervaded the money-spinning indus-
try in nearly all its phases. Beauchamp
was a close friend of Dick Seddon, and
to that circumstance owed his appointment
as chairman of the Bank of New Zea-
land, in which, oddly enough, he was
not a shareholder. At that time he was
darkly suspected of a yearning for politics.
But the suspicion was unjust. Harold’s
main yearning has always been for ducats,
and being an astute campaigner the harvest
has been prolific. He can deliver himself
per pen or voice on financial and commercial
questions with a conciseness rivalled by
no other business man in these latitudes.
Among his earlier assets was an expansive
auburn ziff or beard, but in later days most
of the decoration was scrapped to profit
and loss.
Died at Braidwood (N.S.W.), in his 76th
year, Sergeant Charles Walter Brayne, who
in his younger days was known all over
the South Coast and was in the thick of the
bushranging episodes that culminated in the
swinging of Tommy and Johnny Clarke in
Sydney in ’67.
“T. 0.1.”: Theyre a’Beckett Weigall,
K.C., who gets the job of Acting-Supreme
Court Judge of Vic. for 12 months, is the
son of an early Curator of Intestate Estates
in Melbourne, and nephew of Henry Weigall,
artist, who married in 1566 Itose Sophie Mary,
daughter of the Earl of Westmoreland. One
of their sons was Sir Archibald Weigall,
who was recently Governor of S. A us. The
Weigalls have been prominent in other parts
of the Commonwealth. Thus Cecil Weigall,
the Parliamentary draftsman of N. S. Wales,
is a member of the same big family.
The allegations of “Zabut” :
Lawrence, the uncrowned king of Irak, who,
according to the cables, has joined the British Army
as a private, fell because he was too keenly pro-
Arab. One of the Feisal’s chiefs, armed with an order
signed by Lawrence, was stopped at Khan Huzerlain,
about 30 miles on the road to Beirut, by an Aus-
tralian L. H. Brigade, which had been told that any
bands of Arabs were to be confined to the Damascus
area. But Feisal’s emissary managed to convince
the 8.11. Q. Staff that he had a right to go on.
Had he been turned back Lawrence’s history might
have been different. At Damascus, Lawrence told
the most important of the correspondents that the
iledjaz flag would soon be flying at Beirut. The
correspondent pricked up his ears and informed
H.Q. Allenby arrived soon after and Lawrence was
sent for. After a savonard he left straightway for
Bigland. When our infantry got to Beirut, the
Hedjaz flag was flying over the city hall, and Feisal’s
emissary was told in very blunt language to haul
it down. On his return to England Lawrence refused
to accept his well-won honors as a protest against
the' “unjust treatment’’ of the Arabs. There is a
version that Lawrence was given carte blanche in his
negotiations with the Arabs so long as he kept
them on our side, and that he promised them much
more than either the French or the English Govern-
ment was ready to grant once the war was over.
For England to have backed Lawrence’s 'promises
would have meant a rupture with France, so Law-
rence was discredited. Diplomacy is a great game
of chess, and Lawrence turned out to be only a
pawn, although he certainly played a king’s part for
a whiio. , |
Joel Moses Gabb, who pushed Glynn out
of an apparently safe S. Aus. seat in the
Reps., and has just been sent in again by
a big majority over Treasurer George Rit-
chie, who resigned from the S.A. Government
to contest it, is the central figure of a
host of stories. His great political score
lies in having firmly declined to ioin in the
Federal grab, though he says, “with my Chris-
tian names I might have been excused.”
When someone asked him what his plans
were if Ritchie should oust him, he replied
cheerfully, “I can always go back to my
barrow” —meaning his vegetable cart. He
is a mighty local preacher, and when, in face
of a disturbance while he was holding forth,
he personally heaved the larrikin interrupter
out, his popularity in the district became
complete.
Probably no Federal Senator has ever
brought to his job a longer experience of
State politics and Parliaments than Walter
Kingsmill, one of W.A.’s new choices.
Kingsmill, who is a native of S. Aus.,
arrived iu the Groperland Assembly in
1897, when Forrest ruled the roost. ’ He
was. a Minister in the first post-Forrest
Cabinet, and when George Leate died, in
1902, tried to form a Ministry himself but
failed. Since 1903 up till last May—except
for a brief interlude in 1910, when he resigned
to contest a Senate seat unsuccessfully-<-he
has been a Leg. Councillor. But he drop-
ped out of the fighting rank, or was elbowed
out of it, at a comparatively early stage,
and found a steadier job in the chairman-
ship of committees, succeeding to the Presi-
dency a few years ago when Henry Briggs
died. 'He would have been President still
if his constituents hadn’t suddenly tired of
him this year. Doubtless his Senate vote
was materially helped by sympathy for a
man whom catastrophe overtakes ’after a
quarter of a century of public life. As a
speaker Kingsmill can hold his own any-
where.
“Gallery”: Arthur Rodgers, Hughes’s late
Customs Minister, parted with his seat very
sadly. He had done much for Wannon by
organising a private scheme of repatriation
before the Government’s proposals had been
worked out, and he thought this would hold
him high in the affections of his constitu-
ents; but his association with Hughes and
the unlucky legacy of the big Repatriation
muddle when the responsible Minister, Mil-
len. was in England, helped considerably to
seal his fate. Another thing the Cockies
remembered on polling-day was the imposi-
tion of the sulphur duties during his regime
at the Customs; and they weren’t forgetful
of his refusal to join their party, though a
substantial wheat-grower in the Horsham
district. Personally, I’m sorry he’s gone.
He was certainly much more approachable
than, say, Greene or Bruce, whose frosty
politeness to reporters always comically sug-
gested that the penmen were villeins in the
presence of their war-lords.
“T.P.”: Two youngsters, Stewart Mcßae
and Lindsay Ride, agonised in 1911 in Tal-
langatta (Vic.) school over scholarship
exam.-papers, and both scored. Mcßae ran
Chief Boy Scout

State Governor).
second for the
State, then topped
the poll for the
Scotch College
scholarship, and
finally led all Vic-
toria in the Aus-
tralian Health
Society’s Hygiene
Exam. Both boys
did well at Scotch
College and the
’Varsity. Ride
went to the war,
came back as cap-
tain, and is now
in England as
Rhodes scholar for
last year. Mcßae,
who was resident
surgeon at Mel-
bourne Hospital,
went west the
other day; and his
years were only 24.
Fremantle and Kalgoorlie (W.A.) send
two Victorians to the Federal Parliament—-
“Texas” Green, the new goldfields member,
and William Watson, the elect of the west-
ern port, who beat J. B. Holman, an ex-
Minister of Railways, by 2500 votes. Wat-
son formerly ran a store in Fitzroy (Vic.),
but he, like Green, was caught up in the
gold rush, though he eventually took to store-
keeping in Fremantle. He is now a man of
substance with a big farm and orchard at
Spearwood.
Tom Bavister, another of the early men
in the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor party,
has gone over the hill. The soap-box wasn’t
as frequent in those days as it is now, and
a swarm of those old hands climbed into
Parliament from the pulpit and the Cold
Tea platform. A few of them, like Cook,
McGowen, Cann and Thomas, were stayers;
but most of them, including Bavister, didn’t
last beyond two or three Parliaments. Like
Don, the Australian pioneer of them all,
Torn was a builder, and a friendly Govern-
ment made him an inspector of hods or
something such in his later days.
Josiah Thomas, who lost his Senate seat
in N. S. Wales, is out of Parliament for the
first time for nearly 30 years. His was a
tremendous run of luck. He was a mine-
manager in a small way when Broken Hill
had one of its early strikes, and he took the
side of the men. Sleath and Ferguson, who
were running the show, saw that the fact
of a manager being on their side could be
turned to advantage, so Thomas was sent
off as an apostle to the eastern States.
When the strike was over and he came back
there were no more mine-managing billets for
him, of course, so the local unions did what
they thought was a fair thing and gave him
a job—as M.L.A. for the solidest Labor dis-
trict in N. S. Wales.
“D. 8.”: If a man in the A.I.F. happened
ro be a Murphy, he was naturally called
“Spud” ; but the most famous of them all
was he who passed out at the Turramurra
(N.S.W.) Red Cross Hospital last week.
His real Christian names were Lewis Sal-
vatore, and., having enlisted in the original
First Battalion, he made history on Anzac
as a stretcher-bearer at the Landing, his
persistency and pluck earning him a reputa-
tion even in that place, where heroism was
common. After about three months of it
Murphy got a bad knock and his ticket to
Australia; and, back in Sydney, he was one
of the organisers of the Lone Pine Band.
Never fully recovered from his wounds,
consumption got him in the end. As brave
a man as ever put on a uniform, and one
who did much admirable work of a military
nature, he passed out undecorated. They
didn’t even sling him an 0.8. E.
HENRY LAWSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wind in the trees with their tall tassels swaying,
And the musical streams are still singing of one
Who sang of all these; and the words of his saying
Were the words a man dreams when his day-
thoughts are done.
When the heart of a man has but love for its
passion—■
The love that’s alight from the deeps to the sky—
Though his lines roughly scan, yet the songs that
they fashion
Will live in our hearts when the lesser songs die.
He was kin to the foam and the desert’s wide spaces,
He was kin to us all from the bush to the town.
And his songs took us home. Ah! those dream-homes
and faces,
Where the bush-shadows fall or the street wanders
down.
When we wake from our dreams and the vague skies
are streaking,
Where the dawn streamers run we will hear in
the trees
And the magical streams, many earth-voices speaking
And singing of one who was kin to all these.
MAORILAND.
WILL LAWSON.
HIS DEVIL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Devil found a man content
And happy in his little place,
A gladsome fellow, simply bent
On kindness to the breed and race.
The Devil took the loyal mind
And poisoned it with slow distrust,
Took the deep love of humankind,
And seared it in the fire of lust.
The Devil was a woman, so
Joy, peace and honor had to go.

“Owen Kimberley”: Re “Gouger” (B.
19/10/’22) on cane-cutting. After three years in the
cane I believe that three and a half tons in the leaf
is just about a fair
thing for the average
cutter. A great deal
depends on the variety
and acre-weight of
cane, and whether it
is plant or ratoon,
burnt or green. The
cutter gets 20 per
cent, less for burnt
cane, but can cut 50
p.c. more. As to
variety, a man who
can cut four tons of
Yuban would chop six
tons of Clark Seedling
with the same amount
of energy. Of course
many men can do a
great deal more. Last
season a cobber of
mine, chopping solo,
turned out 600 tons
in 16 weeks, and he is
prepared to stake a
tenner that he can cut
and load 10 tons of
30-ton-to-the-acre cane
in nine hours. Another
man in this district
(Mackay, Q.) is re-
puted to have cut in
one day (hours not
specified) 17 i tons and
to have loaded nine; while a bloke in Bundaberg,
Neske by name, is said to have loaded a two-ton
truck with 10 bundles.

“F.A.”: I can back up “Ned Kelly’s”
father (B. 28/12/’22) re albatrosses attacking men.
About 18 years ago the boatswain of the Moana,
a tough Irishman, fell overboard between Sydney
and Suva while painting the port lamp box under
the bridge. It was calm weather, but about 15
minutes elapsed before he was picked up. While
in the water he had shed his clothes as a matter
of comfort, and when he came on deck his back
was a mass of bloody holes and his head like a
crimson pudding depleted of surface plums. The
birds attacked him, he said, as soon as he rose to
the surface, and continued to do so each time he
came up for breath. They were mostly albatrosses,
but a few mcllyhawks took a hand as well. An-
other time, between the Bluff (M.L.) and Campbell
Islands, my old retriever dog made a false step
into the briny. We picked him up in 10 minutes,
but not before the big wind wizards had torn off a
fair poundage of his pelt.

“Bogan Bill”: An uncle of mine has two
“Dreadnought boys” on his station, and they’re
the joy and despair of his life. Recently they were
told to take about 50 valuable stud lambs, salt
them and put them in another paddock. When they
had been gone about two hours, Uncle went along
to see what was wrong. He found them catching
the lambs, one at a time, and rubbing rock salt
over their wool.
THE EXPERIMENTALIST.
“Good God! I thought you could shear?”
“ Cripes, loss, I thought so too until I tried."
“Poura” (Solomons) : A while back some-
one wrote of niggers looking upon certain alligators as
friendly. I have just come across an incident in point.
A white man was glancing along the sights of a .303
at a large alligator lying on a mudbank, when the
rigger at his side, who came from a near-by village,
remarked: “You no kill him this alligator, master;
he friend belong me. He look out good along this
feller place.” The white man smiled a superior smile,
said “Plurry fool you,” and pulled the trigger. Now
the coon’s logic is this: it’s a big alligator and has
been in the river for a long, long time, and has never
eaten any of the numerous men, women and children
who cross, bathe in or wash there daily; whereas in
the adjacent rivers it is a common thing for people
to be token. If a strange alligator comes into this
river the big cove will kill it or chase it out, there-
fore he is a friend and should not be harmed. Who’s
the plurry fool; and, incidentally, what would you
have done?
* * * *
“Pick”: “Murkak” (B. l/12/’22) is cor-
rect in saying that mongrels are often trained to be
good dogs; but I don’t share his doubts about
canine mental heredity. Greyhounds are trained for
coursing beside older dogs, because otherwise they
will adopt the natural bent of the pursuer, cut off
corners and otherwise; run cunning, and thus lose
points in a coursing trial. But let “Murkah” closely
observe the different methods of the mongrel and
of the blood sheep-collie and the young pure setter
or pointer. The sheep mong., well trained, may be
an excellently useful dog, but he will invariably
work close, bark and bite when handling a stubborn
mob. The well-bred always works wide silently and
never bites. Young setters or pointers commence
to work the first time they get among grass. They
are never trained to set a bird or to squat when a
gun is fired over them. They inherit all, and need
training only to restrain an over-eagerness that
flushes the game.

“Ned Kelly”: Among a crowd of us busy
knocking down our cheques at a bush shanty was
one who had just bought a new pair of boots, of
which he was inordinately proud. In due course
he got well sozzled, and went to sleep in the middle
of the road, whereupon, for a lark, someone pinched
his precious boots. A little later a neighboring
squatter tooted along, and had to either pull up or
run over the sleeper. He jambed on his brakes ard
angrily yelled at the drunk to “shift his dem’d feet
out of the way.” The sozzled one opened half a
beery eye and with it gazed stupidly at his socks
for a moment. “They ain’t mine,” he burbled,
rolling over to sleep again; “mine’s got boots on
’em.”

“Laulau” considers a poetic nigger:—
The Papuan has an abiding faith in the denizens of
the “Land of Shadows,” as he calls the place where
the spirits of the dead reside. He believes that every-
thing has a spirit—the jungle, mountains, rivers,
rocks, trees, plants, birds, fish, animals and clouds,
man-made implements—in fact, all things being pos-
sessed of a shadow. Some of his tales are built
around this theory. The Motu tribe, which holds
down the lands around Port Moresby, still accepts
the story of Devasi, the spirit or soul of the banana.
Devasi is an all-powerful spirit, for it has the
care of all garden produce, and can make or mar
the harvest, if proper respect is not continually
shown it. The banana corm in the hand of the
gardener is addressed as “my child,” and it is set
in the soil to the accompaniment of many expres-
sions of love and respect by the assembled family.
When the fruit is ripe the sharpest knife is used
to sever it from the parent palm, for no respectable
Motu would needlessly inflict pain on the spirit
Devasi. Be he ever so careful, however, the plant
will bleed “white tears of pain,” and the sym-
pathetic planter whispers words of encouragement
and hope to it. The fancy is a beautiful one, and
shows the prying white man one side of the brown
man’s complex nature. The crimson hibiscus, a

double variety of which is indigenous to Papua, is,
according to native belief, the living spirit of a
mythical lover, who was speared t.o death by his
rival. “Can’t you see the big splashes of blood
from the dead man?’’ asked my teacher of ancient
lore.

BILL BARBWIRE’S MURRAY COD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas at a place called Snooker’s Bend the creature
first was seen—
The biggest codfish ever known; the Murray’s banks
between.
The local liars all declared he weighed a ton (or
more),
And, by Ike Walton’s ghostly beard, Bill Barbwire
promptly swore
That, though it couldn’t p’raps be done by means of
line and rod,
By hook or crook, he’d find a means to land that
Murray cod.
A length of steel-wire cable Bill from Belcher’s
store procured,
And to a sapling on the bank ’twas very firmly
moored.
The hook, the local blacksmith made —a chicken
was the bait —•
And for a sinker Barbwire used an iron five-pound
weight;
for, though “fixed engines” are debarred, and merit
time in quod,
Bill took the risk and set his line to catch that
Murray cod.
'Twas Jimmy Dukes, of Boshterville, returning from
a dante,
Perhaps a few Sheets in the wind, who struck that
spot by chance.
He lingered there to light his pipe beneath that very
tree,
When suddenly there came a splash—ye gods 1 what
could it be?
The ground beneath his feet gave way, he tumbled
down the bank ;
And ’neath the Murray’s waters dark three fathoms
deep he sank.
THE REBUKE.
SECOND ( whose man is doing some ineffective poking with the
right ): “For Gated's sake, use yer left! It's a fight, not
a disarmament conference.”
He came up blowing like a whale-—the sight that
met his gaze
Will make his hair remain on end throughout his
mortal days.
The moonlight through the trees revealed a scene of
mad turmoil —-
That sapling and a tidy bit of good Australian soil
Were tearing madly down the stream. Jim bel-
lowed, “O my God!”
For he had caught one fleeting glimpse of Barbwire’s
Murray cod.
Far down the river went the fish, and with him went
the tree;
’Twas like some crazy living thing rejoicing to be
free.
It struck the bridge at Tocumwal, its trunk was
snapped in twain;
But, such is good Australian soil, it soon would sprout
again.
A brooding magpie had her nest among its branches
high;
And though the youngsters fell to earth, they man-
aged soon to fly
Upon the broken trunk again, and there they stuck
like glue,
While down the Murray’s seething stream that mighty
codfish flew.
Straight for the open sea, it sped. Beholders stood
aghast,
To see an island and a tree so wildly racing past.
Out, out, where giant breakers roll, and old tramp
steamers plod,
Like some grim spectre of the sea, went Barbwire’s
Murray cod.
The years sped on, the sapling grew till it became a
tree;
And still by that untiring fish ’twas towed about
the sea.
The magpies grew and multiplied; and sailors’
hearts were stirred
When, with the coming of the day, their cheery
notes were heard.
Then came the war, and with it came a German sub-
marine,
With Fritz beside the periscope, to see what could
be seen.
He got a shock. A frenzied gum, like some avenger
grim,
Full at the rate of ninety knots, was bearing down
on him.
“Mein Gott in Himmell!" cried the Hun, “vat gan
der tamn ting be?”
And, wild with terror, he submerged a mile beneath
the sea.
The good old gum that submarine had ridden down
roughshod ;
He’d done his bit to win the war, had Barbwire's
Murray cod.
And where in all its majesty the blue Pacific rolls
That bit of good old Aussie soil the seaway still
patrols;
Still at the dawn, and close of day, a burst of flute-
like notes
From somewhere in that spreading gum across the
ocean floats.
And when the elements enraged fling rollers moun-
tain high
The lightning flash will oft reveal a gum-tree tearing
by—
A ghostly gum that seems alive —a rover of the sea,
That left his bushland mates behind, and wanders
wild and free.
It augurs of a happy trip (so sailor-folk declare)
To meet that eucalypt by morn—but if at night,
beware!
’Twere better then that steamer’s deck your feet had
never trod,
For ill luck follows in the dark that fatal Murray
cod.
P.S. —’Twas Barbwire told me this. 1 know that it
is true;
For Barbwire always scorns a lie, as all brave bush-
men do.
VICTORIA.

this country. It was the “Dunlop” tyre that made motoring
possible—-and the same tyre to-day is rendering service—
dependable and economical—to tens of thousands of owners of
cars and motor cycles. It*s outstanding features are strength,
great mileage and ability to withstand hard driving over all
conditions of roads and tracks. For value and service it has
no equal—its popularity amongst motorists is evidence of that.

, “Widgee”: I have a pair of albino cats,
and a while ago the lady produced four kitten-,
which were promptly drowned. Two days later
Tom arrived home with a black kitten, which he
had commandeered from another cat 300yds. away.
The youngsteT was sent home, but Thomas brought it
back and persisted in his efforts to allay his
wife’s grief until the kitten became too heavy to
hump over the intervening back fences. Anyone
know of a similar case?

“Machete” : Not only quadrupeds, as cited
by “Ned Kelly” (B. 21/12/’22), can survive a broken
neck. More than one man would be encouraging
the cabbages to-day had not fractured vertebra left
the spinal cord uninjured. A standing Sydney case
is that of young Jennings, the Soccer footballer. He
had his spine fractured by a blow on the back of the
neck, and lay in hospital for many weeks cased in
plaster of Paris. The' break mended, and, after
playing in Sydney next season, apparently as good
as new, he went to England and was retained at
handsome rates by the famous Tottenham Hotspur
Club. It is an old dodge of the English hunting-
field to at once feel the neck vertebra: of anyone un-
conscious after a toss, with a view to at once pressing
in a dislocated joint. I never heard of a concrete
case of 'the'treatment succeeding-, but the legendary
ones are numerous.

“Double Disc”: The pepper-trees round
the house on my farm (Hawkesbury, N.S.W.) have
been fallen upon by millions of beetles, which are
rapidly stripping them of every vestige of foliage.
THE AMENDED REQUEST.
“Any beer-bottles to-day, mum?"
"Do I LOOK as if I drink BEER?”
”Any vinegar bottles, mum?"
They have been at work only for a week, and
already the finest and largest tree, over 30 years
old, is as bare as a willow in w-inter-time. The
beetles are small, with drab-colored, greenish backs,
and —what the deuce am I going to do about it?

“The Wanderer”: Talking of human pack'
horses, Ted. Fogarty, of the Upper Manning (N.S.W.),
one of the best-known buliockies between Walcha
and Mt. George, will at any time undertake to

100 yards—two coils round bis neck and two on
each shoulder.

“Gazeeka”: I was in a “Tin Lizzie” be-
tween Condobolin and Nvmagee (N.S.W.), when an emu
set out to pace us. We were
doing about 20 miles an hour
until the emu ahead oi us
reached a five-mile stretch of road
fenced on both side 3. I bet the
driver he couldn’t catch the bird.
The best the car could do, wav-
ered between 25 to 33 miles —
the road was a bit bumpy—but
we never got closer than 100
yards during the five-mile race.
As to winging it, the fastest flier
in the bush is a scared bronze-
wing pigeon. I was on the bank
of a dam one evening waiting for
bronzewings, when my mate, out
some distance, fired at a bird and
missed. The bronzewing came
across the bank in front of me
about 20ft. up, going like a wire-
less message. I just blindly fired
about 80ft. or so ahead of him
and, as luck had it, got the bird.
1 distinctly saw it crumple up,
then heard it fall. I found it,
dead, 83yds. from the point where
it had been shot. The speed of
the bird is indicated by the fact
that it was flyiqg about 20ft.
above the bank of the dam, and
the bank was Bft. high—total,
28ft. —yet it was picked up 83
yards away on practically flat
ground! I reckon that bronze-
wing was travelling 80 miles an
hour at least. Galahs do about
35 to 40 miles, magpies 80 and
parrpts 40. Crows and cockatoos
are slow birds and cranes about
the slowest. Incidentally, kan-
garoos are fairly lively for a
couple of miles and are pretty
good jumpers. I was after an
old man when he got away by
taking the gate in a boundary
fence, and from where he took
off to where he landed was 31ft.
An interesting thing about both kangaroo and
wallaby is that when travelling fast they clasp their
paws together.

“Girofia”: The N. Queensland ironwood-
tree (quite a different genus from the Eucalypt
ironbark) is a grim menace to stock. The young
plants, with soft, green, enticing ' (leaves, contain
the most deadly poison known to students of Queens-
land flora, except, perhaps, that ip some of the
native lilies with their high percentage of bella-
donna alkaloids. Research work in the Sydney
Medical School Pharmacological department shows
that in the ironwood are alkaloids identical with
those found in the once-used sassy-bark (Erythroph-
loeum guineense) of West Africa. Since these
alkaloids have an action on the diseased heart, simi-
lar to that of digitalis, they were used as a substi-
tute for the latter drug; but as a cardiac corrective
erythrophleine, and hence ironwood, are far less
certain than digitalis, and more dangerous. The
ironwood kills stock within one hour. Incidentally,
N. Queensland has also the Australian fever bark,
Alstonia constricta. In one district the Alstonioe
of adult growth all slant toward the west. Can
any Abo. say why?

“Trevdee”: “Pinnacle’s” story of drover
Bert Lawford (B. 21/12/’22) getting knocked out of
the saddle and returning to bunk while unconscious,
has an equal in the experience of Coventry, one of
Collingwood’s (Vic.) best footballers. Last winter,
when playing against Richmond, he had his head
knocked, and played through half the game without
knowing a thing about it. He didn’t wake up com-
pletely until the following morning, and was the most
surprised man in Melbourne to read in the papers
that he had played the best game on the ground.

“Dr. Nil” : “Jimmie the R.” on “the
bush submarine” (B. 14/12/’22) describes a diving
lizard which he calls a “goanna.” I take it he means
the Veranus varim, or lace monitor, but I’ve never
seen the Varanus varius take to w T ater for any length
of time-—though, of course, most reptiles can swim
and are hard to drow-n. But I confess to having
frequently mistaken the “eastern w'ater dragon”
{Physignathus lemeurii) for the varanus. The
Physignathus lemeurii is said in Lucas and Le
Souef’s “The Animals of Australia” to inhabit banks
of rivers from Queensland to Gippsland”; and to be
“our most distinctly aquatic lizard”—growing up to
3ft. long “or over.” “If disturbed they at once
take a header into water,” which I have seen them
do with such lightning rapidity that one might
easily be deceived as to the variety of lizard one
w r as looking at.

“Malokihi” : The other day I came across
an instance of how the Wabuda Island (Papua)
niggers stick to one another. A member of a local
crew having been arrested, the remaining five
Wabuda boys rolled up their blankets and stepped
ashore. Later they explained to the local beak
that they wanted to go to gaol with; their cobber.
The spokesman put it this way: “Supposin’ one
fellow belong we fellow find trouble, all fellow
want to find trouble-” What about a colored dele-
gate to the next 0.8. U. Conference?

“Kay”: When I had acquired a gadget
for making phonograph records, and a number of
blanks, I humped the machine to a blacks’ camp
with the idea of recording sounds equivalent to a
eorroboree. To a young buck whom I met on the
outskirts of the camp I explained the apparatus,
and outlined the scheme in connection therewith.
“But you can’t do that,” he rerriarked, “these
people are civilised; they can’t make a eorroboree.
But - I’ll tell you what,” he added after a pause,
“I’ll step dance In It if you like.” I found out
later that he’d been reared and schooled with a
white family, that he was something of an artist
at step-dancing, and played both violin and piano.

“M.E.9.”: Thq maternal instinct slips?
sometimes. My fox-terrier bitch the other day
whelped a litter of five pups, two of them being
dead. Yv hen the remaining three were about two
hours old she left the kennel, went to an old fowl-
eoop and scratched a hole large enough to bury
herself in. Then she carried the three puppies across
and put them in the hole. When she had the last
one in she pushed dirt over them with her nose (just
as she does when she hides a bone), until they were
completely covered. I unearthed the youngsters, but
she got quite excited, scooped out the hole and put
them in again. As they tried to wriggle out she
put her paw on them and held them in while she
covered them up. I rescued them once more, but
one puppy died the next day, probably through
getting too much dirt down its neck.

“H.V.E.”: Not only do the platypus and
native porcupine hibernate, as mentioned by “Old
Timer” (B. 21/12/’22), but so do the goanna and
snakes generally, though they are not “dead to the
world” in their sleep. The go. lies up in hollo"
logs, hollows of trees, under rocks and in holes in
the ground, and when unearthed during hibernation
is somewhat sluggish, but by no means somnolent.
About October the big lizard wanders forth seeking
what it may devour, and also, if a male, in search
of a partner of the other sex, over the possession o*
whom he may have to fight another gentleman to a
finish. The other day I surprised two huge Lotharios
on a bush road, following closely in the wake of a
lady go. of much smaller dimensions. One promptl>
scooted into the scrub, but the other and the lady
ascended a small guin-tree, and, from aloft, coughed
defiance at me. As regards snakes, I have unearthed
the black and brown while in winter quarters, anil
they were far from asleep, and full of fight over being
disturbed. Snakes often sun themselves just outside
their dormitories in June (midwinter). I have
seveval times observed the black devil thus taking
the air.

‘‘Pia Qara” ou some heady artistry:—
The Papuan head-hunters have various ways of
treating their trophies. The cheery folk who have
their stamping-ground on the headwaters of the
Striokland, Alice and Fiy rivers separate their vic-
tim from his top-piece with a sharpened bambpo
knife, the skin of the neck and chest being carefully
removed at the same time. The brains are picked
out through a hole in the base of the skull, and the
meat is also scraped off the bones, until the whole
skull is laid hare. Dry grass is then burnt and
thick smoke wafted into the drying cranium, and the
job is finished off when the trophy is stuffed with
teased fibre. The resulting ornament is like a bit
of oak-tanned leather, the hide tight-stretched on
the frame, eyes filled with clay, nose packed to
natural size with the same material, and the cheek 1
almost normal, though horrible to white eyes. Great
value is set on these trophies by the strenuous club-
men who spend their existence in pursuit of them—-
until some other connoisseur annexes their think-tanks
in turn. Further east, in the delta region of the
Gulf of Papua, the bowmen scoff the meaty parts,
and carefully boil out all grease and gravy for the
family soup tureen, only the cranium being added to
to the skull-boards in the Long House. The rudi-
ments of skull-decoration are found among these
peoples, rude attempts at carving on the bone, mostly
geometric designs, being occasionally observed; but
the general rule is to collect the plain skull. A
common plaything for the half-grown lads is an
enemy skull wrapped around with plaited rattan,
which the proud youths tote round as their proto-
types of Melbourne or Sydney do a walking-stick.
Along the Owen Stanley Range, and on the southern
coast, the collector hangs his skulls from the eaves
of his house, the gentle clink and rattle of the grin-

the whole face is roughly moulded and painted with

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The lonely she-oaks croon,
And gentle is the tune
The rippling waters make,
As evermore they break
Upon the circling shore
Of this seaside lagoon.
Birds sing among the trees
Their witching melodies—
Now butcher-bird, now thrush ;
While from the sun-drenched bush
A thousand scents are blown
Upon the noonday breeze.
By beauty washed away
The cares of yesterday,
That stab and wound and Sear,
All, all forgotten are,
And time turns young again—
Gold gilding all its grey.
Beside this lone lagoon
The brooding she-oaks croon,
While piping at their feet
The reed-bird, shy and sweet,
Among the swaying reeds,
Sings in the golden noon.

HOW MANY THOUSANDS ARE BEING WASTED IN AUSTRALIA ?
The corroded roofs and iron and steel work along the sea-shore, near chemical works, or in Mining Districts, tell
their own tale. Yet this tragic waste can be largely obviated by the use of:—
FERRODOR
ANTI - CORROSIVE PAINT
Ferrodor is a British Paint, and has been sold in Australia for 24 years, and is manufactured from a Natural Metallic
Powder, which contains up to 95 per cent, of rustless Peroxide of Iron. This Peroxide cannot absorb further oxygen, so that the
oil of the Paint is not destroyed as is ordinary red oxide, and thus the passage of oxygen from the air (or other sources) through
the Ferrodor Paint to the metal surface is rendered impossible.
USED BY BRITISH ADMIRALTY AT DOVER AND OTHER NAVAL BASES AND OIL TANKS AROUND GREAT BRITAIN.
NOW ON Quarantine Station roofs, North Head, Sydney; Sul-
phide Corporation roofs, Cockle Creek, N.S.W.; fortifications, South
and Middle Heads, Sydney; Hornby Lighthouse (caretaker’s quarters);
North Sydney Gas Co.’s holders; Dorman Long & Co,’3 works, Alexan-
dria, Sydney; Adelaide Steamship Co., for inside of vessels; FremanCle
Harbour Trust; Australian Agricultural Co.’s Colliery roofs, Weston,
N.S.W.; Colonial Sugar Co.’s buildings, Fiji, N.S.W., and Queensland;
Curnming Smith & Co., Chemical Manufacturers, Fremantle, W.A,;
Mt. Lyell Chemical Co., Fremantle, W.A.; Commonwealth Drill Halls,
NS.W.; Wallaroo, Mt. Lyell Fertilizer Co., Wallaroo, S.A.; Cresco Fer-
tilizer Co., Port Adelaide, S.A., etc.
Is “Ferrodor” Faint superior to other oxide paints?
Vcs. "Ferrodor” is an inert oxide, which cannot hurt the oil it is mixed with, nor can it act as a carrier of oxygen to metal, as many oxides
do, especially artificial ones, which are often found to contain FREE ACID.
Is “Ferrodor” Paint better than red lead for first coats on iron and steel, and if so, why?
“Ferrodor” is better than red lead for first coats, as it is more elastic, and does not form a flinty, unyielding coat that cracks with expansion
and vibration; moreover, it is a pure paint and perfect protection, while red lead is apt to be adulterated, when its acknowledged protective qualities
are greatly diminished. Another important item is cost of material. “FERRODOR” covers twice as much surface as genuine red lead.
Is “Ferrodor” Paint better than White Lead Paint for after-coats, and if so, for what reason?
“Ferrodor” is better than white lead for many reasons:—lt is non-poisonous. It keeps its colour in all situations. It is not destroyed by salt
air in seaside resorts, nor is it blackened by the sulphur gases in towns. It does not chalk off if exposed to rain and sun. It does not blister, crack,
chip, or scale off; and in addition to being more durable, it is cheaper in use, as weight for weight it covers more, while its durability gives it a much
longer life than white lead can claim.
Will “Ferrodor” Paint stand the sulphur gases in tozm air?
Yes. It is unaffected by Sulphur, Ammonia, and other gases, and stands well even in Gas and Chemical Works.
Will “Ferrodor” Paint stand the salt air at the seaside where so mlany paints fail?
Yes; “Ferrodor” stands sea air and sea spray. So well does it stand the latter that it has been selected by the Admiralty for work constantly
exposed ,t'o the sea spray. The Corporations 9'f seaside towns have used it successfully on their piers, and for general work, where it does better than
other paints . . . .
“Ferrodor” is an excellent Paint for Zinc. It is also a good Water proofer of Brick or Cement Walls, giving a .good thick skin, and owing to
the non-ccnducting qualities, it keeps an iron roof cool, and is excellent for homesteads. Natural Steel Grey coloured “Ferrodor” is largely used for
Accumulator Battery Rooms, as Sulphuric Acid, when even splashed on it has practically no effect.
The quantities given at side are for one good coat of Ferroder. The
areas are not faked, but are what are handed to us by well-known master
painters around Australia.
N.B. —I cwt, RED LEAD will only cover 336 sq. yds., as against 713
sq. yds. of Ferrodor.
Meggitt’s, Barnes’, or Blundell Spence’s Oil is recommended.

The Tom Hughes’s son Geoffrey, with the
help of three padres and a Nuptial Mass,
got married on Monday. His romance started
during a furlough in England, when he got
the “knock down,” as the Sentimental Bloke
calls it, to rose-cheeked Margaret Sealy
Vidal, and the final splice was given to the
true-lpvers’ knot at St. Canice’s in the midst
of Monday’s great heat and a cluster of the
Hughes relations and close friends. The
bride, who arrived from England last week,
is a pretty, slim girl with the traditional
English complexion, and carried her ivory
satin and laces in the happiest possible
manner. The wedding veil was a Hughes
family treasure of Carrickmacross, and was
moored by a wreath of white heather; but
the crowning glory of the outfit was a string
of pearls, the gift of the bridegroom. The
bride was supported by her sister, in
Dutch-blue silkiness with silver lace
illuminations, topped with a befeathered hat
of amethyst hues. Her job was a sinecure*,
owing to the activities of small Roger For-
rest Hughes, who paged it with an air of
great importance, and carried the pink-lined
brocaded ninon train with as much serious-
ness as though it were the world and he a
pink-linened Atlas. The wedding lunch was
at the Australia, where S’Tom and his lady,
she in handsome trappings of blue-and-grey
georgette, beamed happily on battalions of
Lane Mullinses and Hugheses, Barlows and
Mahers—half the brass-plates of Macquarie-
street, and law’n’order as represented by the
Justice Ferguson and Rolin couples. The
Henry Braddon knight, an old friend of the
family, proposed the toast of the two prin-
cipals. Geoffrey, who won an M.C. as a
flying-man, is now the only son of the
Hughes couple: Captain Roger Forrest
Hughes, father of the small page, was killed
on active service in France. The bride’s
father is rector of Barnsley in Gloucester-
shire.
Dr. Earle Page, who has just swept
through the Rivers district on the crest of
a political triumph, has nothing of your
claptrap vote-catcher about him. Smallish
and fair, he has a distinctly serious view
of life, but also a habit of finishing nearly
every sentence with a laugh of three notes.
His wildest booze is milk and soda, and his
favorite Sunday pastime is expounding the
gospel from his special brand of Noncon-
formist pulpit. That it is a gospel of
brotherly love can be guessed from the fact
that the doctor gave up a practice that
meant several thousands a year to devote
himself to the interests of the bloke on the
land, w'hom the little man reckoned was not
getting a fair deal. “Dash it all,” he re-
marked of his Grafton practice, “I bring
some of these girls and boys into the world;
I make them w r ell when they fall sick, and—-
what for? The same life of city oppression
and grinding toil that their fathers and
mothers are living through. Not if I know
it, during the next 10 years.” The doctor’s
favorite breakfast is bacon and eggs, fol-
lowed by bread and sugar! Mrs. Page is
tall, fair, hates politics, loves the Rivers
district and lives at Strathfield.
Social Sydney has stuck a tricolor over
her ear and jazzed through last w-eek to a
syncopated “Marseillaise.” All this ripping
up the carpet, in ’Loo language, was in honor
of the French war-boats, which are really
the ornamental gateway opening on to the
estate of Commerce, for the Jules Michelet

members of a Trade Mission, and on visi-
tors’ days the naval boats became a sort of
exhibition with the things France hopes to
trade to Australia on view. “Rather like
wrapping a pound of .tea infthe Union Jack,”
one bright Australian girl remarked. There
were heart-burnings, too, over the invitation
cards. The listing of guests fit and proper to
meet the Admiral and his officers had been
put into the hands of one of the city’s
chronic or habitual hostesses, and the ordi-
nary lass had as much likelihood of saying
“Je vous veux du bien,” or some such friend.’y
remark to the wdiite-coated lads as the
equator has of hobnobbing wdth the South
Pole. The Upper Crust srot their lassoing
in early, and had a little dance all to them-
selves on the Jules Michelet on Thursday,
the evening of the fleet’s arrival. Well, it’s
the early bird. ... !
The French Alliance and the French
Union broke into festivities on Fridaly at
Dixieland. The lights in the long dance.-room
had been heavily veiled in dull pink, and
the result was a light, dim if not religious.
The remainder of the decoration scheme was
left" to::the- ;of.
Australia and France. An outstanding
figure was General Brand, khaki-clad and
weighted down with a chest-protector of
medals and stars... He and his aide
arrived with military .precision for the kick-
off ; but the Admiral and-n:s party,'who had
""been dining on the Melbourne, didn’t appear
till supnor-time, when they were" accom-
panied by Commodore Addison, very like a
plump Eton boy in his white mess-jacket.
The Frenchmen’s jackets are as long as the
coat of an ordinary sac suit. They wear
very little gold braid, and the effect is cool
rather than dazzling. The whole of the
French colony apparently tried to squeeze
itself into the big room to do honor to its
country’s navy, and close beside the opal-
escent magnificence of a gown worn by some
rich woolbuyer’s wife would be seen a
homely, and sometimes pathetic concoction
of net and cheap satin. Men fluctuated be-
tween full dress-suits and dinner jackets,
and old George Collingridge, in his
tweeds, was an arresting figure. His blue
eves are still the eyes of youth, in suite of
the fact that their owner fought in defence
of the Papal States against Garibaldi. There
were handsomely-gowned Playousts, Drou-
lers, Doucets, Lamerands, Deszarnands and
Leverriers on every side, and the banking
Spitzer, and the many-tongued Waterhouse
couples were in the gathering. The Bel-
gian Consul broueht his daughter Henriette,
very sweet in white satin. The United States
was unobtrusively represented bv Mr. Mose-
ley. Mrs. Turck, wife of the French Vice-
Consul in Melbourne, .came ori with the Com-
modore Edwards cod pie; a 'young LanareS
girl was a picturesque interlude in a
hooped frock of rose taffetas, while Miss
Soubeiran, who is down from Bowral for the
gaieties, lived up to the flame-colored sleeves
of her black-satin frock. It was France’s
night, and the Admiral was nearly blown
away by the storm of applause that swept
through the long room like a sudden south-
erly as he entered.
The Playoust party at the Wentworth to
the Admiral and his officers was the
Saturday afternoon function to whieh Syd-
ney’s best millinery turned out. There was
jazz in the ballroom, and tea and ices 'in the
palm court —and in the Turkish-bath atmo-
sphere even the ices were melting. But
though clasping hands perspired and
handkerchiefs were unashamedly used like
mops, it was “On with the dance!” Mrs.
Playoust, in a soft black satin frock and an
ospreyed hat, presided over a table at
which the grizzled Admiral was the guest of
honor, and was otherwise the headquarters
of the circle within the circle. Miss Play-
oust wore pale pink with a shady Tuscan
hat. One of the smartest frocks was worn
by a Moreau girl—it wafted the new bat-
effect sleeves in georgette and was the tone
of brown sugar. Mrs. Turck added a soft
pink hat to sand-colored georgette froeking;
the Campana lady was prey clad ; Mrs. Spit-
zer stuck to the coolness of white, and an-
other cool-looking person was the Segaert
child. The McMillan lady wore grey and a
black-osprey hat, and Mrs. Rex-Nicholas
presented an artistic effect in a mixture of
green and black-and-white.
Herewith Mrs. J. A. Wilson, whose proud-
est title is the “Children’s Friend,” though
she can write J.P. after her name, and came
very close to adding M.P. at the last State
elections. With the New Year she has had
another inspiration with regard to lifting a
few of the profits that the rich business man
has left after the tax-collector’s visit. The
new scheme is a holiday home in the Blue
Mountains for the kiddies of hard-up Bill-
jims and the convalescent or pale-faced
youngsters of Sydney’s congested areas.
Arthur Rickard, like a lamb, handed over a
site at Warrimoo (the new station this side
of Valley Heights), and Theo Marks is
planning a house of beauty. Seven of the
one hundred beds are already endowed, and a
cow, some and a motor-car all claim
the new home as their
address, not to speak
of the most up-to-
da t e phonograph,
with a pile of fairy-
story records. Every
dormitory is to be
decorated with a
story" concerning
“Goldilocks” or “Cin-
derella” or “Jack V
the Beanstalk” for
those who like their
stories all bluggy.
(And tins is where
the artists can come
in with their offers
of service.) The
medical students are
going .to camp up
there week-ends till
the flower-garden
and the kitchen-garden are laid out. Age
limit for visitors will be between four and
ten, and even if. you are 11, but very sick
and-small, there’s a chance of your slipping
in.
Only the grace of God and a cool Breeze
saved the Entente from being smashed on
the spot at one of the Jules Michelet after-
-UQ.Qh_ parties last jveek, for the means of
transport to and from Fort Macquarie were
roughly be-planked barges, into which
georgettes and ninons, exquisite organ-
dies and silks had to crowd by the
dozens. However, in spite of this
and the fact that nearly all the heavily-
gilded ones appeared to be “not at home” the
TJarty~was a gay One. There was dancing,
and all sorts of nassages to be explored. The
illuminated photographs of the things France
can sell us—mostly heavenly jewellery and
frocking—proved irresistible to the women.
At unexpected doorways sailors with red
pom-pommed caps stood on guard clasping
something resembling the halberds once so
fashionable in the Tower of London. Cases of
what looked like ancient battle-axes stood in
close neighborhood to up-to-date gunnery.
The adorable Foch gazed squarely from one
wall of the Admiral’s room. The French
colony came in force to the party, and the
Alliance seemed to be there to a man. The
Soubeiran lady beamed under a shady black-
and-white hat. Beatrice Kelly had almost
extinguished her pretty hair under a tight-
fitting black hat that had a flyaway bow of
black tulle perched at the back. Tootles
Williamson was another who gladdened the
afternoon with her millinery—her lid was of
white .kid, made toque-wise and finished off
with a rabbit’s-ear bow. Skalski wandered
about, very slender and very remote. Mrs.
Clayton wgs in pink crgpe-de-chine, with the
deep sleeves of the moment in white geor-
gette ; while her sister, Rita Buckland, wore
the blue of the kingfisher’s wing, an intrigu-
ing hat and a beauty spot. Mrs. Verbrug-
giien sported a hat wreathed in yellow
feathers, and the Pirenne lady was a smart
exponent of ankle-length pink organdie fin-
ished off with a floppy white crinoline hat.
Another smart dresser was Mrs. Jacobs.
Mrs. Waterhouse demonstrated black and
white, and Mrs. Frank Wright wore apricot
georgette.
This is Aubrey Johnson, who, as Big Chief
of the New South Wales Bo.y Scours, has
just stormed Mel-
bourne at the head
of over a thousand
dauntless wolves and
cubs. A little while
back the Big Chief
was a mere indent-
merchant. Then the
call came, clarion-
clear, and he decided
to shut up shop and
give all his time to
Scouting. lie is
already a Silver
Wolf—the equiva-
-1 e n t, practically,
of a Brigadier
in the A.l.F.—and
the Lord only knows
where he will finish,
as one may remain
on the active list of
the Boy Scout Army up to the age of 95. An
old Newington boy, Aubrey Johnson was one
of the first to enlist in the Baden Powell
movement, and even gave up his only vice—-
lacrosse—to throw himself into the work.
He is the typical long, lean, fighting Aussie,
and has a wonderful Scout manner—which
is entirely different from a bedside manner.
On Monday night the Hotel Australia
burst into glad food in honor of Admiral
Ghilly and his officers at the instigation of
the French Consul-General. There was a
toast-list as long as the menu, starting with
“The King,” and “The French Republic.”
Of all- the Australian speeches Holman’s was
the most dignified and the most eloquent.
Rosenthal chucked in a word for the Aus-
tralian army; and Senator Gardiner and
Charlie Oakes were others who added to the
Tower of Babel. The French are an abstemi-
ous race, and three glasses of wine (one
white, one red and one champagne) sufficed
for them to see the toast-list through. Adrian
Knox finished off the proceedings by a neat
speech of thanksgiving for the opportunity of
meeting the Frenchmen, and proposed the
health of Consul Campana amidst an uproar
of applauding knife handles.
Catherine, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Charles
Mac-Laurin, is engaged to Allan Mackerras,
who has just passed his final in engineering.
It. is a romance of old standing, for they
were at Sydney University together—where
they both did brilliantly in the schools —
and had known each other for umpteen
years before. By the way, Dr. Mac-
Laurin’s forthcoming book, to which reference
was made in the Inky Way the other day,
should shortly be on sale in Sydney. “Post-
mortems, or Historical and Literary Essays,”
is the title of it, and it is to be published
next Month by Jonathan Cope, of Gower-
street, London —a firm which has made quite
a reputation of late years, by handling “ad-
vanced” stuff.
The Cavalier Club was treated to a party
the other night by mine host of the cara-
vanserai in which it lunches itself each
Wedhesday. Fejix Inaold turned on a dinner
of many courses, and somebody was all for
bringing the cook from the midst of Ms pot?
and pans to cheer his humble spirit by
drinking his health. But the cook of yester-
day is the chef ol to-day, and by the time
the nuts and wine gambolled down the board
the chef had departed and was probably on
his limousined way to his suburban home.
In the Belmore district, enjoying the
evening of life at 91, is Mrs. D’Arrietta.
widow of Walter d’Arrietta, who was over-
seer in the N.S.W. Government Printi.or
Office in the time that Tom Richards was
chief. D’Arrietta’s father, J.L., came to
Sydney 100 years ago with letters of intro-
duction to Samuel Marsden, and had a grant
of land—Moreton Park, Menangle.
From a Maunganui passenger at San
Francisco:—
When we left Sydney this vessel numbered
among her passengers an unassuming lad, whose
face seemed oddly familiar. He was down on the
passenger list as Mr. Doolittle, of Los Angeles. Then
one of the officers made a find. It was a small
leather pocket-book, with a photograph of a beau-
tiful girl on one side and, or the other, a visit-
ing-card bearing the simple legend: “Mr. Charles'
Chaplin, Hollywood.” Instantly all became clear.
For peace and quietness, the world-famous star
was travelling incognito! Fortunately the mate was
a man of the world. Realising the need for dis-
cretion, he did not post his find upon the notice
board, but returned it in person to Mr. Doolittle.
A liner is, however, no place for the keeping of
State secrets, and soon the ship was simmering
with excitement. It became known that the finder
of the pocket-book had been snapshotted with its
owner, and that the photograph had been signed
“Charlie.”
Shortly afterwards a lady of obviously psychic
personality told the young officer’s fortune. It
was predicted that he was to leave the sea, and to
enter upon a far more lucrative occupation. A fair
woman of astounding loveliness figured in his
future. She was to be his mascottel The fol-
lowing day a strange sight was to be seen in a
secluded corner of the upper deck. A new Mr.
Doolittle, a purposeful Mr. Doolittle, was directing
a professional-looking camera-man, who was taking
“close-ups” of his sailor friend. Every pose from
“persuasiveness” to “passion” and from “concen-
tration” to “command” was tried out, and as each
was “registered” Mr. Doolittle would order
“shoot.” The culmination of the test was reached
when the young sailor perched his cap at an angle
of 45 degrees, assumed an up-and-at-’em expression,
and was photographed as the living image of Lord
Beatty.
What is the meaning of it all? Is Charlie really
doing little, or is Doolittle doing Charlie? Has
Sydney missed a chance of movie-star sensation, or
has this ship starred a super-splendid hoax? That
is what the Maunganui, as one tripper, is asking
at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the prayers of
the ship’s congregation are with Mr. Doolittle. Next
to the joy of finding a tugfull of authentic film
cuties waiting for him at the Golden Gate, it hopes
to see him make his get-away up the wharf with a
wild-eyed Beatty in pursuit!
How is this for sticking it out? Sarah
Evans, who died at Castlereagh, in the
Nepean district, a few days ago, had spent
94 years without a break in that calm
locality where they measure everything in
pumpkins.
A Brisbane postcript:—
On the 3rd Sir Matt, celebrated his 61st birthday
in the atmosphere of youth and jollity which he loves.
One wouldn’t credit his Ex. with much more than
60 summers, yet no particular Margery seems to have
successfully declared it was “time he was settled in
life.” Government House was festive with the vice-
regal colors, red and white, and among those who
helped eat the be-eandled cake were Major-General
Bruehe and his wife, the Tullys and Cecil O’Beirnes,
Mrs. and Miss Hammond, from the Harbor City, pretty
Blanche McAulay, Drs. Glyn-Connolly and Jack
Thomson with their attractive spouses, and Dr. Power,
by himself, with Capt. Hammond keeping a general
eye on things. Mrs. and Miss Hammond are
staying at the vice-regal gunyah.
On New Year’s Day Sir Matt., fre3h from the
green fields of Bellevue station, dined the Longmans
and Dr. Francis Jupe. Mrs. Lumley Hill did escort
to her Christmas guests, and motored back to her
station on the same day.
Just before Christmas there died, in her 86th year,
at Folkestone, England, the widow of the late Bob
Little, one-time Crown Prosecutor here, who passed
out at Colombo in 1890. Mining-engineer Marcus,
their son, survives them.
Southport is about the fullest place in Q. just now.
A ball was given at the Pacific, where, with balloons
bobbing overhead, dancers bobbed wildly below to
the strains of Mrs. Barron’s jazz band. All the
rank and fashion at present dabbling its toes in the
Pacific tides were among the bobbers. The previous
night the Southport hotel had been' the scene of
action. One afternoon the Milmans presented tea
and cake to a number of guests, among whom were
the Fraser lady, from Melbourne, and Mrs. Joshua
Peter Bell. The Blundells and other yachters have
been sailing their craft in surrounding waters, and
all those who didn’t go to the Tweed or over-run
Coolangatta hied them to Southport, while the Koopa
on New Year’s Day, as at Christmas-tide, was
weighted down with the one-day-outers to Redcliffe.
His Majesty’s continues to present an inhospitable
front to Queen-street, and two city picture-shows are
closing. Colin Crane keeps his end up at the
Majestic, and the Theatre Royal booms along with
the suggestion that “It Pays to Advertise.” Charles
Dearden, son of “Kathleen Watson,” is in this com-
pany.

After no end of preparations Premier Law-
son, Mrs. Lawson and George Mac Lean, sec.
to the Premier’s Office, left on Saturday by
the Naldera. They will see France and as
much of the Continong as they can, and will
tour England and Scotland, the U.S.
and Canada. A few days should suffice for
the “mission” work with which Lawson has
been entrusted—loan conversion, immigra-
tion and shaking up the market for canned
fruits. The trip is to be mainly pleasure,
and he has earned the holiday.
Jim Fairbairn has placed an engagement-
ring on the finger of the Charles Forresters’
pretty daughter Peggy, and they are to be
married this year. He is Charles Fair-
bairn’s second hope; spent some unenviable
months as a Avounded airman in a Hun
prison camp, and got back to freedom with
an unskilfully-set arm-bone. The Blighty
surgeons later condemned the unruly member
to the knife, but the patient preferred to
give Nature a chance, and Nature turned
up trumps, though it took her fully four
years to complete her job. Like his comely
sister, Mrs. Wheatley, Jim Fairbairn has
a fine, upstanding presence, and the sort of
hair which one’s friends call “Titian” and
one’s enemies “sandy.”
Solicitor Henry Madden has sold the old
family home, Travancore, at Flemmgton,
where he and his brothers Frank and John
were raised, to a syndicate which proposes to
turn the homestead into a club-house and
the park lands into golf-links. But the
evacuation of the Madden family will not
take place till after the wedding of daughter
Ruth and Leo Duffy, early next month.
Henry Madden’s handsome wife, who was a
sister of Mrs. Sep Miller, passed out when
the children were still in the nursery. Since
then they have been mothered by their aunt
Minnie Madden.
Appraising masculine eyes linger longest
on Mamie Watson in Hugh Ward’s richly-
dressed show at the Princess’s. She is a
slim blonde, somewhat like Phyllis Dare,
and so tall that she has to wear flat shoes
to bring her within kissing reach of the
leading man. She dresses beautifully in the
early-18th-century effect of a tight-fitting
bodice emerging gracefully from a marquee-
shaped skirt. Her first frock is like the
blue of our summer sky, and she has silver
and white appointments later on. May
Beatty is decorated sumptuously, as befits a
predominant personality with a handy man
to sit on, and her dress goods, including the
black confection which permits a shapely
calf to peep out upon the world, turns the
feminine section of the house into a mental-
arithmetic class. Also, the dressmaker has
not been asked to spare the bill to spoil the
gladness of Minnie Hooper’s chorus girls.
The melee of colors in dainty exhibitions of
dancecraft is always absorbing.
Captain Russell Jackson, the bold sailor-
boy who married Kitty Boyes, of St. Ivilda,
is in port at Melbourne on a holiday, to
resume acquaintance with his wife and child
after a two-years’ absence. Captain .Tack-
son is a tried and trusted servant of the
Ellerman and Bucknell line, ivith Avhich he
has been associated for close upon 30 years.
He captained an Australian transport for
three years of the war, and took one of the first
loads of Anzacs to Gallipoli. He had several
brushes with submarines and a bookful of
moving experiences by flood and field, which
book, if filled, would make a stirring chron-
icle of what the men of the so-called mer-
cantile marine Avent through during the big
blow. Not the least rousing incident Avould
be the story of hoAV his wife chased him all
over creation, and after many vicissitudes
ran him to earth at Yladivostock Avhile the.
revolution Avas on, and suffered imprison-
ment there till she could satisfy the official
and officious ziffs that she Avas not a spy.
The Tallis lady had a rather Avorried home-
coming. The day of her arrival in Mel-
bourne, her son Jack (he is 11, and the
Tallis baby) developed appendicitis. He is
noAV out of hospital, but still \’ery ill —there-
fore the lady cut out her proposed trip to
Sydney for the opening night of “Sally.”
Her husband motored over to Sydney with
the John H. Taits. Movie-prince Thring and
his wife tumbled into their car and motored
along Avith the party. They are all putting
up at Bondi.
The new political knight, Arthur Robin-
son, State Attorney-General, is at Bar Avon
Heads getting used to the “S’rarthur,” of
the chatterers. Of course, she is delighted,
and has now the laugh over some of the
Primrose dames who tried to belittle her some
time ago in connection with the control of
the A.W.N.L. Why Robinson should have
been given preference over McPherson is a
puzzle to many inside and outside politics;
but, then, about 99 per cent, of these affairs
are puzzles as insoluble as the source of
Billy’s £25,000.
General Tivey collected his two chicks
from school and took them for a first-time
view of Sydney this New Year. In the
most devoted way he motored them to
hundreds of the beauty places, and forgot
that there was such a thing as a peace-
ful club in existence. The youngsters
are a daughter, already giving promise of her
late mother’s good looks, and a son, who is
climbing up to nearly six feet in height—-
which is good going for a 14-year-old. The
General is back in Melbourne now with the
modest look of a man who has done heroic
deeds.
The thoughts of John from China are not
always as sad as his countenance camou-
flages. He has his hidden sense of humor
and his transitory tendency to waggishness.
An opulent suburban matron tells of how
she chanced upon the velegatable John gaz-
ing on the French-bean plot in her apology
for a kitchen garden. She pleasantly re-
marked that the plants were an awful fail-
ure this year—all growth and no fruit. John,
stooped to examine an almost barren plant.
Then he took a handful of beans from his
basket and said gravely: “Me give you these
—to tie on.”
Mrs. Winifred Kiel?, 8.A., who is the wife
of the learned principal of Parkin College,
of Adela’de, at the recent Melbourne College
of Divinity examinations, passed in all sub-
jects for the final B.D. She is the first
woman in Australia to bag this degree.
Mothers and aunts are comparing notes
concerning Christmas in the home, Father
Christmas in the nursery, and the few
children who continue to accept Santa
Claus at his fabled valuation. One
little chap carefully hid all his toys
under his bed on Christmas Eve —his notion
being that Santa Claus nut toys only in the
stockings of those children who had none
already. An older urchin who got a toy
pistol among his presents was bent on using
it as a starting machine. So he fixed up a
bag of sweets as the orize for a footrace, in
which his little brother and sister started
(by pistol fire) from "scratch.” Of course
the brother won—and got the prize.
Then the inequality of the contestants’
chances was pointed out to Reginald. So he
generously donated another prize for a
handicap race, and he gave the girlie such
an accurately fair start that her former con-
queror barely succeeded in catching her on
the post. They finished a “dead heat.”
Reginald had made no provision for such a
result. There was only one bag of sweets,
and nobody had actually won it. There-
fore, in his Pooh, Bah capacity of starter,
judge, referee and committee, be decided
to avoid all disputes by eating the boiled
lollies himself.

brings pleasant
sounds into the lives
of the halt and the
maimed in various
hospitals and insti-
tutions, provide her with the opportunity,
seeing that she never lets her assistants go
unrewarded. Mrs. Robertson is still having
her own fine voice schooled by her former
teacher, Sobell; and one of her most trea-
sured possessions is the gold medals she
won as a school-of-music champion con-
tralto soloist. A scholarship came her way
at the same time, but, as she was not con-
tinuing her vocal career, she handed this on
to another student.
Eileen Fitzsimmons, our star equestrienne,
was married to Ernest Cudmore, of the old
South Australian squatting clan, in time for
a Christmas-season honeymoon. The wed-
ding took place under the eyes of a bare
handful of relations and extra-special inti-
mates, and the confetti-throwing act was
staged at the homestead of the bride’s
mother, Mrs. Buchanan, who is a sister of
Dr. Lilian Alexander. The pair w’ill settle
on the bridegroom’s natty little acreage,
Devon Park, which is within coo-ee of Dame
Nellie’s palatial Coombe Cottage. Ernie
Cudmore is the plucky Anzac birdman who,
although equipped with an artificial leg in
place of the one he lost as a boy in a riding
accident, did good work hovering over the
enemy lines before Fritz winged his machine
and took him and his observer prisoners.
Theyre Weigall, who has become an
Acting-Judge, has to worry along as a grass-
widower these days, as his musical wife and
her equally musical girl Nancy are cross-
ing to England with Theyre, jun., who is to
join the Ixmdon Daily Mail staff. The eldest
Weigall daughter, Marion, is troubled with
high-brow tendencies, and has been sta-
tioned for some time in England, so that,
besides the head of the family only little
Joan-Daryl Lindsay remains.
This is Esna Boyd, the least-photographed
of champion tennis-players. Still a mere
youngster—she won the Schoolgirls’ Singles
in Melbourne in 1918 —she has captured the
Ladies’ Singles three times in Melbourne, and
twice has come home
in the Ladi e s’
Doubles. Partnered
with Jack Hawkes
in the last Vic.
tournament, she just
dropped the Mixed
Doubles after a sen-
sational clash with
O’Hara Wood and
Mrs. Lister. More
recently in Sydney
she pushed the ex-
perienced Mrs. Moles-
worth for the cham-
pionship of Austra-
lia, though the ener-
getic young person
had to make three
appearances in other
battles on the same
day. Esna, who is
a daughter of the Jimmy Boyd, who bot-
tomed the poll for Henty in the Federal elec-
tions, owes her crisp style and strong de-
fence to the patient tutoring of Gerald Pat-
terson’s dad, who, although he never plaved
tennis until he was 40, knew enough about
the game to give his boy some valuable
advice. Miss Boyd, however, is not entirely
absorbed in tennis. She is a keen student
and reader, and is deeply interested in the
Repertory theatre.
There goes on the Naldera as far as
Colombo William Mcßeath, the State Sav-
ings Bank boss. Maj.-Gen. McKay, the
greatest job-securer of his generation, will
be deputy-chairman while S’William is away
for eight weeks. Others aboard the Naldera
include Hon. Minister Merritt, and Chandler,
a fellow member of the Uppah Chambah,
who are to tour Europe during the recess.
In the past an M.L.C, wasn’t missed if he
stayed away for a session or two; but now’

sibly the electors will be more wakeful to
their comings and goings.
A son of old Major Strong, of Mel-
bourne, and a brother of Doctor Bob, who,
these days, trades in Pap-wah, is down for
a trip, and is singing the island glories in a
loud and triumphant chant. One of his
boats, by the way, is the old Queenscliff
that used to dodge round the south ports of
Vic. and up into the Gippsland rivers.
John Lemmone is positively blushing with
pride. A friend sent a cutting from the
London Daily Mail which announced a
wireless concert one evening, and the chief
item promised on the programme was “ ‘The
Spinning Wheel,’ as played by John Lem-
mone.” The gramophone records of this
piece, by the way, have sold by tens of thou-
sands.
The sedate subbub of Malvern has taken
the initiative, and proposes sending abrawd
the locally-famous Malvern Tramway Brass
Band, which has drawn countless crowds to its
performances locally. Preparations are being
made for a world tour in 1924. Great Bri-
tain, France, Belgium, Canada and America
are on the itinerary. Gibson Young,
of community-singing fame, is organising the
Australian move, and up till the time of sail-
ing the band will send round the hat at its
concerts. It began the good work on January
7 at the Malvern Cricket Ground, and is to
collaborate in the popular community-singing
concerts every Sunday evening during the
summer.
George Dancey had been a sick man for
a long time before death overtook him, and
had been producing little, although what he
did was well up to his high standard. It was
found when his affairs were looked into that
he had left his family in a very precarious
position, and a movement is afoot to induce
Melbourne artists, and those among Sydney
painters who were his friends, to arrange a
gift exhibition on the lines of the Edward
Officer one. The artists make a gift of,
say, 200 pictures, and 200 tickets are sold
at two guineas apiece. Then the pictures
are drawn for, the first winner having his
pick of the whole collection. The second
winner has second choice, and so on till
every one of the subscribers has drawn a
picture. It is a raffle in which every ticket-
holder draws a prize, and which, at the
same time, guarantees the disposal of the
whole exhibition at a handsome profit.
Esther Paterson is working up this idea
for the benefit of the widow, and will be
grateful for any help brother- and sister-
brushes can extend her.
Franeoise de Castella, our Government
Viticulturist, is engaged to Miss Silvestre, a
daughter of a French medico, and the wed-
ding is to happen early in the year. He is
a son of Hubert de Castella, who, with
brother Paul, established the vineyards at
St. Hubert’s and Yering, in the Lilydale dis-
trict. The family is French-Swiss, and all
of it has an expert knowledge of the vine.
The De Castella place at St. Hubert’s, by
the way, was purchased some time ago by
railroad-contractor Timms, who uprooted the
old vines and turned the place into a dairy-
farm, and the hoof of Strawberry now
tramps where once flourished vines from
which came some of the finest clarets and
light wines ever grown in Australia. At a
Bordeaux (France! exhibition away back in
the ’sixties, St. Hubert clarets held their
own with the best French types.
A braw braid Scot hight Clarke (with
never a Mac to his name) is visiting Aus-
tralia. He is one of the directors of Vickers
—the firm which has just added a trifle of
a £10.000,000 job to its order-list from the
British Government. His heather accent is
a joy to exiled brither Scots, and he ate his
New Year haggis with a congenial crowd of
them in sweltering Sydney before coming on
to Melbourne.
Theatres will soon have to hoist a notice
to patrons to kindly remove their combs as
well as their hats. The Spanish species of
hair decoration is becoming vicious. Its high

or tufts of feathers with jewelled tips, or
yet again with huge blobs of jade. The glare

move her hat will be a sweet smile in com-
parison to that of a woman flourishing her

Melbourne, having looked upon Taronga
Park and seen that it is good, is now casting
about for a new site for its own ssoo. Things
are a bit too cramped at Royal Park for our
collection of dejected-looking animals. Sev-
eral places have been proposed—the favorite
being Yarra Bend, where there is space and
water added to ready-made pits left from
disused quarries.
Some new songs have just arrived in Aus-
tralia from May Brahe. One called “Red
Roofs” has a dainty Schumann-like accom-
paniment. The words “red roofs above the
peaceful quay” are suggestive of Sydney, but
were written by an Englishwoman, Helen
Taylor, lots of whose stuff gets set to Brahe
music. It is many years since May Brahe
was in her homeland, but she has several
relations living in Sydney. At latest she
was directing a good deal of energy towards
comic opera, and is reported to have been
offered a flattering sum for two lots of this
work.
The Benjy Benjamins, of Melbourne, are
involved in a general mourning along with
their relations, the Alfred Phillipses, of Syd-
ney. Eawrence Phillips, a brother of Alfred,
was killed by accidentally falling 20ft. or 30ft.
out of a window in England.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
With Commemoration Day thrown in between
Christmas and the New Year, this village indulges
in such an orgy of holidays at this time of year
that Society betakes itself to its seaside and moun-
tain coolnesses and turns a deaf ear to any attempts
to lure it forth. The Bridges did Glenelg thoroughly
on the 28th, beginning at the Old Gum Tree, where
Mayor Patterson was presented with a brand new
gold chain of office —each link a gift from one of
his predecessors—and ending with the pioneers’
luncheon at the Town Hall. From there they went
on to Cheltenham, in time to see Black Kogue annex
the Cup, and to tea with the committee and Dr.
and Mrs. Benson. They were at the S.A.J.C. meet-
ing on the following Monday, and on Tuesday his
Ex. departed on an “unofficial” tour of the
soldier settlements on the Murray.
From England comes news of the death of Miss
Isabella Short, the 82-year-old daughter of the bishop
who was in charge of the Anglican Church here
from ’47 onwards. Her only sister, Mrs. Glen,
lives at Mount Gambier.
Mrs. A. M. Cudmore and her daughters are off to
England in the Naldera. The doctor goes as far
as Colombo with them for a five weeks’ holiday.
We are threatened with two more musical pro-
digies. One is Helena Fisher, who put up a record
by being the youngest student to win the Elder
Scholarship (she is only 16) and appeared at her
first Con. concert when she was 10. The other is
Roma Jean Moller, aged four-and-a-bit, who has
just passed the Royal Academy and Royal College
of Music examination with 122 marks out of a
possible 150. The new Elder Scholar is said to be
the most promising violinist we’ve produced since
Daisy Kennedy. She is to go on to Germany and
Italy when she has finished her three years in London.
The Walter Smiths, cattle-king Kidman and
his daughter Mrs. Sydney Ayres are among the
homeward bound S. Australians. The Smiths broke
their voyage for a month in India, where Walter
has done a good deal of big-game shooting.

July 18 ,’7 7, EDISON
had a crazy idea
46 YEARS ago, as he worked in his laboratory, there came
to Thomas A. Edison an idea —a “crazy idea” his most
trusted assistant called it. But Edison had sufficient faith in
that idea to sketch a draft of the machine and to pencil on
it this prophetic declaration: —
“Just tried an experiment with a diaphragm having an embossing point, and
held against paraffin paper moving rapidly. The speaking vibrations are indented
nicely, and there’s no doubt I shall be able to store up and reproduce auto-
matically at any future time the human voice perfectly. ’
46 YEARS afterwards Edison was able to add another note
to his prophecy:—
“By constant experimenting we have got the phonograph to the point where an
audience CANNOT TELL WHETHER IT IS LISTENING TO AN
ARTIST’S OWN PERFORMANCE, OR OUR RE-CREATION OF IT.”
Tfc NEW EDISON
“The Phonograph with a Soul.”
“The New Edison” the great wizard calls his pet invention —and to-day you can
have an exact duplicate in your own home—to Re-Create (not merely imitate)
for you the performances of the world s leading artists.
Surely this phonograph—bearing the name of the world’s greatest inventor is
the one you want; write or call for Catalogues.

was resumed, and enabled Whitty and Morton to
improve their analysis a little. Hendry’s contribu-
tion was a sound 47. W’hitty bowled best, and, even
when the scoring was briskest, the batsmen showed
some respect for his leg deliveries. The fielding was
not first-class, though there were bright exceptions.
Faced with the formidable total of 455, the two
Richardsons began the uphill task. But the visitors
never looked like figuring creditably, and but for
ft undell s batting and some plucky hitting by the
tail, tile show would have been a sorry one. V.
Richardson got 20 before Mailey bowled him, but 5
wickets were down for 46. Rundell was playing cau-
lously and steadily, but no one did much to second
his efforts. He made 56 before he was caught in
the slips. Whitty brightened things up with a

South Australia missed a great chance of
defeating Victoria last week. Though, after the
downfall of the two Richardsons, the next few men
mowed poor form, the tail wagged cheerfully, and
the Vies, were only 71 ahead when the innings
closed Gould, a debutant in inter-State cricket,
>atted exeellently for 44. In Victoria’s second hits
, Australians had a real grip of the game
W“ e ” M ayne, Ryder, Hartkopf, Park, Ransford and
Willis started a shuddering collanse, and the board
read 6 for 84. Then the luck changed. Woodfull,
the awkward South Melbourne colt, who had been
poking about since the beginning of the trouble
was joined by Liddicut, whose treatment of the
mediocre bowling was as refreshingly contemptuous
as Ins previous colleagues’ manlier had been solemn
amt anxious. Liddicut banged awav merrily with-
out giving a chance,-until a highly-cut ball was
shot into the hands of Bridgeman, fielding substi-
tute for Gould, and a record partnership of 155
for the seventh wicket was established. Liddicut
knocked up 71, whilst Woodfull, who had wakened
no a trifle, was caught out a little later for 115
Lllis and Freemantle also had a whack at the
bowling, and Mayne’s team reached 287, the last
four wickets being responsible for 203. Faced with
the job of scoring 359 to get the verdict, the Grow-
eaters faded away like ice-cream in a stokehold
Vie. Richardson got 34, Townsend 16 and the
reliable Rundell 15, but these were the only double
figures, the whole side going for a miserable 90.
Hartkopf, who was turning- the ball well on a
good wicket, was the destroyer, and took 6 for 24
in eight overs. Liddieut had 2 fpr 9, and as his
batting yielded an aggregate of 108 with:, one not
out, he takes the pastry for all-round success.
Though Maoriland failed tragically in the
first Test against Maclaren’s team, it made a more
respectable showing in the second match, having
none the worse of the draw. The home team’s totals
were 375 and 8 for 270 (innings closed) ; and the
M.C.C. replied with 384 and 5 for 145. Collins got
a century for M.L., and Chapman’s 77 was the high-
est score on the English side.
* * * *
Lacking the help of Hartkopf, Northc-ote
had a busy time with Fitzroy on Saturday. Cody
smacked up 100, Liddieut was responsible for 74, and
’Boy knicked off with G for 284. Collingwood
totalled 213 against South Melbourne, Brown get-
ting 71 and Ryder 49, whilst South made a bad
start with 3 for 21. Carlton’s 209 (De Gruchy 66)
was not a striking effort against Hawthorn-East,
whose most successful bowler was Gamble (6 for
58). North Melbourne, who were keen for runs in
their argumert with University, lost three run out
in scoring 252. Bailey got the average for the
scholars with 3 for 37, whilst Freemantle, who has
just made an inter-State debut, had the modest
record of 2 for 85. Bartholomew, the Richmond
wicket-keep, rendered noble assistance in stumping
three and catening one of Essendon, who seoved 164.
Ellis, the inter-State stumper, was also in good
fettle for P’ran against St. Hilda, who were 8 fox
212 when this report closed. Grimmett was most
troublesome with the ball. Wallace, the fast bowler
who had a recent turn with the State eleven, lost
his length early, and was looking for it during most
of the afternoon.
* * * *
“Tren”: So successful was the country
cricket week held in Melbourne last year, when 32
teams played and Ballarat won after a close final
with Hamilton, that this year 70 associations want
to compete. As all matches must be played on turf
and as there are only 25 such wickets available the
number of teams competing is to be limited to 4S
by a grouping system. In last year’s competition
the star performer was J. Mathers, captain of the
champion XI, who scored in the six matches 156,
82, 11, 91, 90 not out, and 88 —an average of 103.6.
He then joined up with Norm Melbourne, and suc-
ceeded so well with them that he was picked to
represent Victoria in their second XI match against
N. S. Wales, in Sydney, and scored 36 and 59. Other
country players now prominent in Melbourne are
A. E. Liddieut, (Fitzroy), the present bowling star
of Victoria, who fii-st came under notice by scoring
a century for Geelong against Douglas’s Englishmen”
W. M. Woodfull (South Melbourne), Victoria’s open-
ing batsman, who made his name with Maryborough;
Colin McKenzie (Fitzroy), and W. McDonald (Mel-
bourne), who have both represented Victoria. Also, the
Caddy Brothers, of North Melb. —T. J. Caddy is in the
Colts and W. Caddy in the Vic. second Xl—-both learnt
the game at Ballarat; Herring (Melbourne), in the
Colts ’XI, comes from Maryborough; and Dunton
(St. Hilda), Street and House (Melbourne) also
came from the bush. If the Sydnev authorities en-
couraged country players as the Melbourne authori-
ties do, the condition of N.S.W. cricket would be
much healthier than it is.

E. V. Carroll: The writer of that
par. about the Vic.-N. S. Wales match (second
elevens) makes me a bit older than I am. 1 was
born 16/l/’B5 (“Wisden” has the year wrong), and
my brother, E.L., is 20 months younger. 1 don’t
mind a bit being classed as a veteran, but it is just
as well to have these little matters right.
TOMMY
ANDREWS,
who made the
highest score
for N.S.W.
against S.A.
Pommy Andrews’s 179 v. S. Aus. is the
highest knock in this season’s Sheffield Shield matches.
Alan Kippax’s 170 v. S. Aus., at Adelaide, was the
previous best. Andrews has beeii a prolific scorer
in inter-State cricket. In 1919-20 he banged 494
runs, averaging 123.50, making 247 against Vie-
tona and 103 v. S. Aus.; in 1920-21 he averaged
and last year he piled up 327, averaging
64.50 With Armstrong’s XI in England Andrews
scored 1358 runs, averaging 33.96. By trade he
is a monumental mason, and no cricketer is more
popular with the Sydney crowd.

J. M. Allan : “Abbott Park,” in hi 3 remarks
about Jack Blackham fB. 21/12/’22), betravs con-
siderable ignorance. Blackham has never contended
that he always stood up to fast bowling. What he
does sav and what is perfectly correct, is that he
habitually stood up to the fastest bowling unless it
wl „ deC J de j . as , a I ? a , tt ?r of tactics that he had
better stand back. I believe that he stumped men
off Ernie Jones, the fastest bowler the world has
ever seen. ‘‘A.P.’s” statement that my late .father,
Frank Allan, was a slow bowler is also wrong.
Although, like- Spofforth, he had a slow ball, he was
an extremely fast left-hander, and his fast stuff,
swinging in from the off, was awkward and often
dangerous for both batsman and keeper. If Allan
was slow, then McDonald and Gregory are googlies,
because Allan was, until middle age, faster than
either of them. In Blaekham’s day McDonald and
Gregory would have been regarded as fast mediums
only, and he would not have dreamed of going back
to them.

“Winkle”: Cricketers, in their endeavors
to cultivate what the papers now boom as a “won-
derful defence” —known of old as “stone-walling”
—made the recent inter-State matches at Melbourne
a weariness, with a hit to the fence an infrequent
and wonderful happenin'?. Supposedly first-class bats-
men refused to punish, not only all good-length
and rising stuff, -but .also the rubbish that was any-
thing from an inch to a foot away from the off-
s'tun ‘P- lor instance, among Mailey’s slows were a
goodly number of innocuous long-hops, but instead
of cutting these or slamming them through the 15-
yard gaps between point, cover and mid-off —an easy
matter in club cricket—they were left untouched, as
if full of hidden guile; and Freemantle’s nearly full-
tosses were, for the most part, gently patted back
to the bowler. The methods of Collins and Woodfull
e best examples of how mediocre bowling
should not be played, and my mind boggles at the
dreary thought of these two, and lielleway to follow,
pulling a Test match out of the fire.

w.3 laC /v% i To ? chin S the inclusion of
Wallace (N.S.W.) and Aitken (M.L.) in the Scot-
tish International Trials (15. 4/l/’23), a storm of
b * e . en ra P"S j n England on the inter-
national qualification ot colonials.” Several sport-
,wntei's sourly question the amateurism of the
K “ scholars, and Aitken was cross-examined as to
whether or not he had ever played Northern Union
football, a professional game. The joke is that any
member of an M.L. University (as Aitken was) has
as much chance of being allowed to play the League
game in M.L. as he has at Oxford itself. Only one
Rhodes scholar has played the League game, and he
has done that only for Queensland Uni., refusing all
otters to play with the inter-State team. That is
Lawton, representative at the Union game of Queens-
land, Sydney Uni., N.S.W., Oxford, Blaekheath, and
probably England this season.

“Centurion”; “F.A.” on A.I.F. Rugby
(B, 28/12/’22) recalls a game at El Arish. The
referee was a Light Horse Squadron leader, an old
rep. player who, in addition to being an exigent
horseniaster, was very keen on the “get up and
play the ball” rule. Both the teams, on the other
hand, believed in lying on it, to keep possession
and regain breath. At last the rep. varied his
Get up, get up,” with a “Dam’ and blast it, play
the ball, can t. you I” From the side lines came a
still, small voice: “Give th’ cows a coupler extra
orsepickets, Major.”

J. W. Merchant, one of the U.S.A. athletes
visiting Maoriland, contributed an item to the Austral-
asian record-book by throwing the 161 b. hammer
i 6 #*- 7i ‘i., an improvement of 7ft. Ijin. on J.
McHolms (M.L.) figures. Merchant also won the
broad jump (22ft. 9in.) and the javelin throw
(150 ft. 2in.) ; but Peter Munro was too good for
h >n> ln the discus (125 ft. llin.) and the 161 b. shot putt
(44ft. Sjhn.). H. E. Wilson (M.L.) accounted for
another of the visitors in G. C. Krogness, and estab-
lished new Australasian figures in the 120yds. hurdles
(losec.). Paddock didn’t accompany the party,
which doesn’t propose to visit Australia—for the
present, anyhow,
* * * *
“Mirza”: Apropos “O.Kj’s” opinion of
athletes who chew eoca-leaf (B. 28/12/’22), I am
convinced that chewing-gum has all the mystic effica-
cies or cocaine. Repeated American investigations
have demonstrated that stimulants do not increase
the sprinter s capabilities or powers of endurance ; and
\ J . s reasonable to conclude that continuous stimula-
tor* will not add one cubit to the stayer’s strides.
But the presence of the leaf excites the flow of
saliva, keeping the mouth cool and moist; and the
monotonous mastication so dulls the brain that it
does not rebel at the imbecility of tramping leagues
around an arena surrounded by admiring lunatics.
And both these benefits, with none of the attendant
dangers of cocamism, can be obtained from a thrip-
penny packet of “ehewie.” p

The weights for the Challenge Stakes and
the Anniversary Handicap, to be run at Randwick
on Jan. 20 andl 26 respectively, emphasise the futility
of double-betting on such puzzles. Seventv-two
™ e f S erC \ bp'dieapped for the sprint " and
76 for the Anniversary, and it is hard enough to
* s . t § r , tel |’, al ? n T e Plated horses. Duke Isin-
glass (Bst. 51b.) and Iraa’s Boy (Bst.) are a likely-
looking pair for the short race. For the 12-
furlong race Swift Shot (9st.) would read well if
he could be depended upon to do his best, but an
honester trio are (Iranian (Bst. 181 b.), Cymric (Bst.
i, 01 b) and Radiant Light (Bst. 91b.). Tom
McCarthy was weighted at 9st. 101 b„ but will not be
a Suarter. The Queenslander is a good horse, but
not many will agree with the handicapper that
he is within a pound of David, the best long-distance
animal m the Commonwealth now that Eurvthmie
is under a cloud.

“Stony”: Strolling over to the Fleming-
field races at mid-morning to avoid the crush, I met
up with a pleasant stranger and discussed various
horses. What chance did Blue Blazes have, did he
think? He smiled a quiet smile. “Well,” he said
j n -° fudge, y’ know.” Met the same chap after-
wards m his official capacity. He was the judge at
the course. J 6

“Toby 0.”: We were drinking at the bar
on one of the Queensland coastal steamers, when an
argument arose over the name of the Melbourne Cup
winner of ’B6. One chap was prepared to stake a
quia on his memory, and nominated Arsenal He
also offered to bet that he could name in correct
order the first, second and third horses in every
Melbourne Cup from ’B5 to ’2l. Several passengers
wagered dollars that he couldn’t. We couldn’t find
a Miller’s Guide on board when the list was ready
but it was agreed that the skipper should hold the
paper until we reached Townsville. Then it was found
that the fellow had every horse in the proper order.
He also gave the riders of 23 winners, the weights
•of 22 and the starting prices of-the last dozen.: We
all allowed that the walking encyclopedia of form-
at-a-glance had taken a keen interest in the turf.
That’s why he travelled stee'rage with the rest of us.

“K. Kurrajong”: At Bright (Vic.), the
other day, Phil Barlow, a youth of 70, rode two
horses, Stella and Gordon, over hurdles, and got
second place with Gordon, lie also won a hack
race on the mare, who is nearly old enough to have
qualified for the vote.

“0.K.”: Sunburst, the Bernard gelding with
which Eric Connolly won the chief sprint race jat Caul-
field on Boxing Day and the Standish at Flemington on
the following Monday, is bound to be fancied for
the Newmarket if he does well in the meantime.
“LES RAMSAY ”
(J. R. Corteen), a
Victorian racing
man.
Like his stable-com-
panion Rostrum, this
not-too-sound jilier has
been gently j treated
by his owner-trainer.
With Rostrum, Sun-
burst and Fleijriste the
astute Eric hasj a strong
team of speedy ones
that have nefer been
asked to go further
than a mile for money.
Nevertheless his chance
of winning the next
Newmarket looks hardlv
better than that of
McCracken, who has a
rare, sturdy sprinter in
Weedah, daughter of
St. Anton. Carrying
61b. more than the win-
ner the top weight ran
a great race, whilst an-
other mare in Sonora
came third. And one
mustn’t forget that
slick Soutstralian St.
Speed.
“Fez”: In damning the idea of Sabbath
tennis in the parks, the Vie. Lawson Govt, was at least
consistent. It held quite logically that, if
tennis were permitted, there should be no
embargo on football, which is just as much a
recreation to young people, whatever its social short-
comings in the eyes of the Melbourne aldermen, whose
alleged rationalism doesn’t go as far as allowing
the youth of the metropolis to kick a bag of wind
about. The city dads might well declare that the
yelling associated with football is a desecration of
the Sabbath, whilst tennis gives no offence in that
way, but ethically there is no difference, • and it is
mere prejudice and wrong thinking 'to pre-
tend that there is. And, anyhow, what
is all the row about? Cricket and golf
are already permitted on Sundays, but the amount
of tennis possible to each player wouldn’t amount in
the existing circumstances to more than one set.
There are four public courts in Fawkner Park, and
two in Richmond Park, near Cliveden, and as these
would only be open for two or three hours on the
Sunday afternoon, the likelihood is that much of
the surging population which would inevitably attend
wouldn’t get a game at all. It should be quite
time enough to talk of Sunday tennis when the Coun-
cil provides more courts. Early attention to that
practical demand would have given the fathers a
substantially stronger case against the Government.
* * * *
“Linesman”: Tennis students expect great
things front D. R. Meares, a small boy attending an
East Melbourne college. The youth won the school-
boys’ “championship” in the Sale tournament, but
what excited notice was his gallant tussle with
I. D. Mclnnes in the open singles, in which he
scored 3—6, 9—ll before throwing up the sponge.
Mclnnes is among Victoria’s first flight, and a youth
who can extend him in the manner mentioned must
be an uncommonly promising- player.
* * *
“Ashmead”: A glowing debut was made by
the old Launcestonian Rowing Club, formed of old boys
of the C. of E. Grammar School. Having accumulated
a membership of 60 it tried itself out at New
Norfolk on Boxing Day, and romped home in the
maiden fours, the junior fours and the junior-senior
fours. At Devonport on New Year’s Day it added
the senior and maiden eights to its collection of
victories, and it gained several places at both
regattas. The youthful club has dreams (if rival-
ling the proud exploits of Murray Bridge (S.A.).

The next motor-boat championship on the
Port Adelaide River (it is to be held on Feb. 24)
promises to be unusually strenuous. Major Donkin
took the Greyhound over last time to recapture the
title from the two Rymills, of Adelaide, but their
Tortoise was equal to keeping it, though she had
been spending a quiet time as a duck-shooting
craft. He has since had privately built a new
Meteor, of which great things are expected, while
they have fitted the Tortoise with an enormous new
engine. There are two other local entries, with
owners from Vic., N.S.W. and Brisbane.

George Mendies, the little Portugee, is
boxing so well these days that there is again talk of
sending him against Wilde. At Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night he settled Kid Raymond, the Vic-
torian, after six rounds of exciting boxing—the best
seen at Rushcutter’s Bay for quite a while. In the
first canto Raymond missed with a right swing, hut,
bringing the glove back, chipped Mendies on the
chin, dropping him. George was on his feet before
the count started, and they fought like fury until
the bell. Mendies did much the better work in the
second round, and the end loomed up iff the fifth,
when he put Raymond to the floor. Six seconds had
been counted when the gong came to the Kid’s
rescue, but Mendies knocked him kicking in the next
round. On this form the winner has no peer in
Australia at his weight, but Pancho Villa made short
work of him at Manilla.
A CRICKET QUALIFICATION.

“He can neither bat, bowl nor field well; neither
can he sing.”-— From a letter in the Australasian
protesting against Mayne’s continued captaincy of
the Victorian XI,
Though the rolling years have made your limbs less
limber,
And your wrists, so supple once, a trifle stifi,
Till you cannot whack the leather with the timber
As lustily as once you used to biff;
Though your average Iras sunk to six or seven,
And your old-time skill is plainly on the wing,
1 ou still may figure head, a State eleven
li .you can sing.
Though so slow and butter-fingered be your fielding
That the barrackers are prone to rudely hoot,
Don’t think you grow too old for Sheffield Shielding
And gloomily anticipate the boot;
bven if you’re never like to take a wicket,
Tour bowling having neither length nor sting,
Vou ve still a chance to stick in first-class cricket
If you can sing.
Though your power to punch the veriest tripe is
waning,
And a toss to leg is hard for you to hit,
In your locker there is still a shot remaining
If musical refrains you can emit.
Though all the strokes at which you were a clipper
Have vanished, to your notes be sure to cling •
Aye, warble like a blackbird, blithe and chipper’
It may save you from being jettisoned as skipper
H you can sing.

THE INKY WAY.
Captain Gwatkin-Williams, in “Under the Black
Ensign,’’ tells how the Kaiser once got applause
from the British Army. When Riga fell, the Bol-
sheviks not only surrendered without a struggle, but
handed over their officers, bound, to the German
commander, expecting to be rewarded for their
treachery.
“Such an example to his own troops, however,
did not suit the Kaiser, who happened to be present.
He forthwith caused the Russian officers to be re-
leased and honorably treated, whilst the men of
the mutinous regiments he ordered themselves to be
bound. This done, he had one out of every 50
publicly hanged, while, of the remainder, he caused
a large percentage to be flogged. On hearing this
story, and knowing the then state of Russia, 1 fear
we, with one accord, exclaimed, ‘Good old Bill I'"
“P.X.”: You remember the story of the man
who, when a sparrow had misbehaved while flying
immediately over him, thanked God that cows
didn’t fly. Perhaps to prepare readers for the
horrors to fallow, Constable’s cheap edition, of
“The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” makes the
bovine beasts do this very thing. “A drought sud-
denly strewed his plains with dead cattle. Every-
where great black hulks. In the air great spirals
of cows coming from leagues away.” In flights
of the imagination the linotype can beat Ibanez
hollow.
“Zanthus”: There is a heap of information about
Australia in a work called “The Australian Cap-
tive.’ It was edited by a parson and published
in New York in 1850, and purports to be the adven-
tures of one William Jackman, mariner. He alleges
that he was shipwrecked on the shores of the Bight.
500 miles east of King George’s Sound, in 1887.
Jackman seems to have been u sturdy liar, if less
fertile and picturesque than Dp Rougemont. He
says that he could not travel along the coast to get
away from the abos. who had taken him prisoner
because of the many large rivers in the way; that
18ft. snakes were common;,and that he spent many
years amongst the “cannibal inhabitants’' pf those
parts before he was taken off by a whaler. Is
there any evidence that our coastal abos. were ever
cannibals?
“E.": I blamed the reviewers for their dilatory
notices of Katharine Prichard’s novel “The Bla>-k
Opal,’ (its correct title is “Black Opal,” the
article being a wrong addition by the publishers),
but now find that the fault is not theirs, but Heine-
o'a nil’s, who have actually taken over a year to
dribble out a few review copies. An Australian
author, who is not on the spot, seldom gets a good
run from an English publisher-—even where such a
high-class firm as Heinemann’s is concerned. He or
she receives a smaller royalty for Australian than
English sales. Good Australian novels are not too
plentiful : and published locally “Black Opal,” which
is the best I know since Louis Stone’s “Jonah,”
would have had a considerable success. It is amaz-
ing that no local publisher will take a risk with
anything more serious than a shilling shocker!
“Wilfrido”: Heinemann’s “Atlantic Library” sup-
plies a long-felt want. Its aim is . stated to be a
desire to bring before British readers the best novels
of contemporary American literature, special atten-
tion being paid to the work of the younger writers.
Two books of note that have reached these parts are
Edna Ferber’s “The Girls” and Floyd Dell’s (no rela-
tion to the inimitable Ethel) “Moon Calf.” The
first is a surprisingly human document. The theme
is the life-history of the three Thrifts—grand-aunt,
aunt and niece, and the treatment bears comparison
with the best work of Clemence Dane and Edith
Wharton. The second deals with the ideals, ambi-
tions and achievements of a young journalist, Felix
Fay, who provides the masculine side to the picture
of American life. At times Felix is a little reminis-
cent of Jacob Stahl, but lie is clever enough to make
an interesting young revolutionary. The sequel, “The
Briary Bush,’’ is published in the Same library, but
is not yet to hand.
“Bret Vane”: In recent American fiction there are
some interesting remarks anent the contribution of
America to the quietening of William Hohenzollera.
Harold Bell Wright, in his “Helen of the Old House,”
has a Sammy making remarks like this:—
After all, old Iran, it wasn’t an officer’s war
and it wasn’t a private’s war any more than it was
the war of America, or England, or France, or Aus-
tralia, or Canada—it was our war.”
But a much more frank and candid story comes from
Peter Kyne’s “The Pride of Palomar.” A Sammy,
justifying his enlistment, has this to say:—
■‘. .. .for the protection of our comfort and our bank-
roll we declared war... .It wasn’t a war to make the
world safe for democracy That phrase was just a
slogan in a business campaign—the selling of stock
in a military enterprise to apathetic Americans.”
“P.”: The memoir habit is getting hold. Augustine
Birrell, who writes English better than any man
alive, is preparing his memoirs for the press, and
should have some interesting things to tell of Dublin’s
Black Easter. John Burns has at last emerged from
his retirement to write his reminiscences. The late
Lord Bertie, so long Ambassador at Paris, and before
that Under-Secretary at the F.O. and private secre-
tary to the great Marquis 0 f Salisbury, wrote his
before his death, but they have been deposited for
40 years, after which they will see the light
of day. Bertie was a great diplomatist. It is
a pity contemporary Europe will not know his un-
alloyed opinion of Sir Edward Grey’s policy, which,
in private conversation, he used to describe as
—y well asking for trouble!” The Haldane
Memoirs are also completed, and have been put in
cold storage until after the author’s death.
“Stellsby”: After an overtime stretch of hiberna-
tion, England’s Poet Laureate, Dr. Bridges, broke out
in a blank-verse tribute to the late Sir Hubert Parry,
musician. The verse, which is inscribed on a
recently unveiled memorial in Gloucester Cathedral,
labors thus: —
“From boyhood’s eager play called by the English
Muse
Her fine scholar to be, then her Master’s compeer
A spirit elect whom no unworthy 'Thought might
wrong
Nor any Fear touch thee, joyously o’er life’s waves
Navigating thy Soul into her holy Haven;
Long these familiar Walls shall re-echo thy Song,
And this stone remenfber thy bounteous gaiety,
Thy honor and thy grace and the love of thy
Friends.”
I’ve had better stuff rejected myself.
“Kip”: Here is a bit of information that may be
of value to the Australian free-lance who has
sufficient optimism to try his luck at short-story
writing for the American magazines. If, in Sub-
mitting his work to a Yankee mag., the author
wishes to reserve all rights of republication, he
should endorse his MS. “First American serial
rights only” ; it costs him nothing ; and the editor
then knows that he has no further claim on the
work other than publication in his particular
magazine. Indeed, largely owing to the persistent
efforts of the Authors’ League of America, the more
reputable American magazines now specifically state
that they buy from the author nothing more than
First American serial rights. Consequently, if any
further business results from the publication of the
story, it is done with the writer, not the publisher
—and business may come from many quarters. In
the States the newspapers frequently reprint in their
Sunday supplements yarns which have appeared in
the magazines; in doing so, they secure what are
known as, “Second American serial rights,” and
although the prices paid for these rights are not
very substantial, they are acceptable. It sometimes
happens, too. that an English magazine dishes up
a yarn already published in the U.S.A.; and for this
privilege it pays an amount not very far below
the price the author has received for the original
publication. Also, dramatists and “movie” directors
study the magazines closely; and should a yarn
possess dramatic qualities or be suitable for filming,
the author stands a further ehanee of raking in
the dollars —provided that he has taken the pre-
caution to protect his rights. Besides endorsing
his MS. as stated above, he should see that the
phrase “all rights of which are tut ;.rcrierty of
” appears on (he printed receipt form.


Just Charming.
By “PHLOX.”
k CAREER is all right, Audrey, as
far as it goes; but I don’t think
it is sufficient to satisfy the aver-
age woman’s heart.”
"I suppose. Aunt, that’s why you gave
up your medical practice and married Uncle
Edward.”
“Yes. I was getting on in years when I
married. I had begun to feel that want of
companionship with someone I could really
call my own—someone who was more to me
than a friend.”
"Those are my sentiments, Aunt. I feel
I have a more interesting career than most
women with a lectureship at the University
and my research work in archaeology, but
there’s something wanting.”
“And that something, my dear Audrey, is
a husband. I've been through the same thing
myself, and I know —it’s the same old story,
old yet ever new. I loved my profession as
you love yours, but alone it was unsatisfy-
ing.”
“Yes, Aunt. I realised that when I saw
Nita Anderson’s radiantly happy face as she
announced her engagement to be married :
then I realised that even a career does not
compensate for a life of single blessedness.
You remember that jolly girl who passed so
brilliantly in Arts! b'lie’s going to marry
Professor Butler.”
“And I think, Audrey, it’s about time
you looked around for a husband. You’re
not cut out for an old maid, though of late
you’ve acquired one or two little prim ways,
and the average man does like a little bit of
Huffiness about a woman.”
"What do you mean?”
"I mean that you want to take more pains
with your general appearance; fluff out your
hair a bit, and so on.”
"But 1 don’t happen to have fluffy hair.”
"Then you’ve got to fluff it; also to im-
prove your skin; in fact, where Nature has
been deficient, supply the deficiency with
art. That’s what I do. But I promised
to meet I’ncje at fi o'clock, and it’s nearly
that now—I must be goiug. Good-bye,
Audrey, and think over what I’ve told you.”
Audrey Johnson was thinking over what
her practical aunt had suggested when she
was interrupted by someone wrapping on her
study door.”
“Come in,” she called.
Professor Livingstone’s pretty wife
entered. She had come to ask Miss Johnson
to join in a send-off to Nita Anderson.
After this had been satisfactorily arranged
they talked of all kinds of things.
Audrey had often noticed what pretty,
fluffy hair Mrs. Livingstone had, and how
beautifully she dressed it. Why not ask
her for some hints on hairdressing?
Mrs. Livingstone felt quite flattered at be-
ing asked for advice by clever Miss Johnson.
“So much depends,” she told her, “on the
way the hair is shampooed as to whether
the hairdressing will be a success. Per-
sonally, I always use Stallax,” said Mrs.
invingstone, “and I find it makes the hair
beautifully glossy, fluffy and easy to dress.’’’
“And that’s jhst what I want,” replied
Miss Johnson.
"Dp you ever use a hair tonic?”
"No, I’m afraid I’ve never given much
thought to my appearance, but I intend to
turn over a new leaf in that respect.”
“I can give you a recipe for a simple,
home-made tonic. You buy a package of
boranium from the chemist, mix it with
a quarter of a pint of bay mm, auu rub into
the scalp occasionally.
“Do you know,” went on bright little
Mrs. Livingstone, “a little while ggo I wafj
getting quite grey, and I happened to hear
a woman in a chemist’s shop ask for two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite and three
ounces of bay rum to mix with it. She
then turned to her friend and said that there
was nothing like it for restoring grey hair to
its original color. I thereupon ordered the
same, and now I haven’t the sign of a grey
hair.”
“I’m glad to know of that, too, for I’m
continually pulling grey hairs out of my
head.”
“But, Miss Johnson, when you begin to
look after your hair you must also look
after your skin, and I find that there’s
nothing like mercolized wax for keeping the
skin soft, clear and free from blemishes.”
"My aunt was telling me that I badly need
a skin 'ood, but she didn’t tell me what to
use.”
“All the well-preserved women I know
seem to use mercolized wax. It contains
oxygen, and removes the old worp-out Skip
so imperceptibly and painlessly that you
don’t know the process is going on until
some fine day one of yOur friends will re-
mark, ‘I don’t know what you’ve been doing
to your skin, but it’s like a baby’s.’ ”
“Then, that’s certainly the cream for me.”
“Well, if you care to come round to my
place wfyrn you hive time I will show you
a pretty way of dressing your hair, relieve
me, my husband always keeps me up to the
mark, and is delighted to hear people whis-
per as we pass, ‘Look! isn’t she j isc charm-
ing?’”

♦
Such plot as “Sally,” the new musical
comedy at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, possesses
is agreeably absurd. Its central character
is a girl from a New York foundling home
(Josie Melville), who gets a job as dish-
washer at a pub of the Prohibition period,
where, of course, she encounters many
strange creatures, including a comic waiter
(George Lane), a comic theatrical agent
(George Gee), an impassioned young man
about town (George Baker) and numerous
well-nourished ladies in well-ventilated cloth-
ing. At the instance of the comic theatrical
agent' and his particular armful of charms
(Gracie Lavers), she impersonates a mis-
laid 'Russian dancer with a French accent
and an Oriental past at a garden-party given
by tpe man-about-town’s inevitable parent
(Gaston Mervale). There the gaff is blown by
her suddenly-arriving employer, frantic at the
loss, of his dish-washer, ail the regular dish-
washers having gone on the movies, and she
retires weeping on the arm of the comic
waiteir, who naturally turns out to be the
banished Duke of Czechogovinia, where the
Schnitza Komisski flows down to the sea.
Heroically resisting the temptation to
retprij to the dish-smearing profession, she
becomes a solo dancer at the Ziegfeld Follies,
an<J, After the fashion of Ziegfeld Folly girls,
marries the young man about' town in the
Litjtlel Church Rounds the Corner —-the
Divojrjpe Court being over the way. All this
make ; 4 a very lively show. The music is
pleasant, without being- particularly memor-
able, and the dancing is captivating. Some
of the scenery, moreover, is superb, and
stunning effects are produced by the flashing
of colored lights on gorgeously-attired girls,
and by rolling a platform, vv with bal-
lerinas, to within a few feet of the curates
and dither ecclesiastics in the front stalls.
Also, the comic stuff is moderately amusing
at its worst, and the librettist is not too
proud' to imitate Homer and Kipling, and
borrow from his forerunners, when his in-
vention flags. One of his smartest wheezes
appeared in all the newspaper biographies
of Gilbert when that impenitent sinner died
in 1911.
H## * *
Sally is largely a dancing part, and this
is doubtless the reason why Josie Melville
was cast for it, since there are girls in the
company with superior qualifications in
other respects. The Sydney girl dances
beautifully and is quite a promising actress.
She has a pleasant little speaking voice,
which she uses “with intelligence and
some feeling, and lacks, neither prettiness nor
—iwhat is better—charm. Judged on her vocal
contributions (qne a rather stupid and vulgar
ditty about Joaff of (i Arc) she isn’t much of
a singer, but she will improve in tbqt de-
partment as she gains cbundehce and selects,
a more alluring model than the. metal-voicec-
serio of American vaudeville. Altogether, the
winsome young woman does uncommonly
well, and it is to- be hoped, that the un-
reasoning adulatjpfl t).f newspapers on which
the press-agent ' has laid his-'baleful spell
won’t infect her with, the belief that she has
nothing more to learn. Her most capable
coadjutor among the ladies is the sprightly
and graceful Gracie Lavers, who flashes her
eyes at the audience with killing effect, and
has-a couple of capital duets with George
Gee. Another girl well in the picture is
Pixie Herbert, atY a settlement worker
who- "dabbles in Society. George Lane,
the new man from ' London, has an
easy style of comedy, and is ...,a sure-
footed dancer. Also, his singing voice is
agreeable, though by no means strong, and
in the scene where the bogus Madame Noo-
kerova is exposed Cn the C.I.D. sense) he
acts with quiet force and dignity,- as also
does Gaston Mervale. Gee’s best work is
done with his eloquent feet. His rapid-fire line
of talk grows increasingly indistinct. George
Baker sings admirably and acts woodenly,
Hugh Steyne briefly appears as. an ancient
and amorous noodle, who steps out of “May-
time,” and the nnhh'c eve rests annrovincly
on Billy Valentine, Charles Howard, Dorothy
Nelville and Gladys Hermes.

“Spangles,” at Fuller’s Theatre, Sydney,
is sparkling and jingling twice daily, at 2.15
and 8. It’s an excellent all-round medley of
melody and whimsicality, and while everyone
will regret Ada Reeve’s indisposition and
wish the old favorite a speedy return to
health, there is enough talent ana brightness
left in the combination to ensure patrons of
this clever show good value-for their money.

“Cinderella” is still-being whirled from
the scullery to the ball in a helicopter, vice
an out-of-date coach, at Sydney Theatre

principal girl, a scrumptious girl-boy, a
Dame of infinite spirit, and butterfly fairies
galore.

At Sydney Palace the Sentimental Bloke,
Ginger Mick and that highly desirable bit

it. In an age and a country that is getting

brow verse, the S;B. comes like a whiff of
fresh sea air into a musty library or a con-
servatory heavy with tropical perfumes.

THE SENTIMENTAL BILLY.
“The world 'as got me snouted jist a treat;

An' all them joys o’ life I 'eld so sweet
Is up the pole."
—“The Sentimental Bloke."
ciative eld. Amy - Rochelle and Eve
Gray are gladsome creatures, the humor
of the comedians is of a rollicking quality,
and the sylvan scenes and accessories are
the last word in pasteboard excellence.
Constance Talmadge is at the Lyceum as
a Chinese flapper in “East is West.” Jack
Bickford, at the same address, is “The Man
Who Had Everything,” the story being hung
on the threadbare moral that “spondulix
is not all.” At the Rialto Betty Compston
is pursuing an alcoholic mate with a view
to making a cold-teaite of him. The Strand
has “Nanook of the North,” which deals with
life among the Eskimos. Rodolph Valentino
continues in “Blood and Sand” at the Strand,
nor has the Crystal Palace yet found the
answer to its fortnight-old query: “What’s
Wrong with the Women?”
At Sydney Grand Opera House “Little
Bo Peep” goes on recalling one of those
shepherdesses in china that used to bring
a pastoral flavor into the drawing-rooms of
the Victorian era. What with the sheep and
the caper-cutting cow and other farmyard
features, or travesties, there’s an atmosphere
that dimly reminds one of M. Rostand’s nigh-
forgotten plays in Bo Peep, and even in
the songs “One grasshopper jumps over an-
other grasshopper’s back'’ with irrepressible
spirit.

At Sydney Tivoli the Monks of St. Bernard
are recruiting support from the two-up
schools and choir-lofts alike by their ren-
dering of old-time melodies; and the Ethel

admirable in their Dying Swan dance.

Melbourne, which is crowding to the
festive show at the New Princess’s, re-
joices in the assurance that Competition,
the soul of theatrical business, has made
a fine start with “The O’Brien Girl.”
Hugh Ward’s production has grace of
sentiment, in its musical-comedy way,
as well as charm of movement and color,
and touches of novelty in the effect. It vans
respect, on _ further acquaintance, for all
things except the. singing of the leading young
man (Arthur Lucas). He is otherwise a
good exponent of chivalry in tender passion,
notwithstanding bjs want of inches compared
with Mamie Watson, a heroine divinely tall
as well as quite lovely. One of the items
not _ mentioned last week fis the feathered
Indian (McPherson), who adds a little new-
ness and sentiment, and gives the key to a
rattling chorus number wherein Mel Ward
shakes a remarkably violent leg. Mel Ward
shakes his extremities in other dances, but,
like Hazel Harris, a soloist from America, he
helps fill the bill without supplying a want.
In a show where dancing talent abounds
among the principals there is no urgent de-
mand for specialists.
**4 4 .
At Melbourne Palace the career of Dick
Whittington is still influenced by the-un-
accountable machinations of Long Tom and
Little Billy, who conceal a gigantic jewel in
Dick's ridiculous swag what time the historic
young personage is swanking around his
master’s drapery emporium in velvet and
silk tights. The plot against Whittington
is due to a Demon King, who defies a foreign
princess whilst she is posing as Fairy Queen,
the disturbance being aggravated by their
want of harmony in a duet where the Demon
sings flat in a large manly voice, and the
orchestra sounds like a misunderstanding all
round. The human voice, however, plays a
less than ordinary part in the Fullers’ panto.
Hassan’s impersonation of the Cat is an im-
portant consideration, likewise the Stag Hunt
Ballet, where Verna Bain appears as a silent,
sportive fawn, under the mistaken impression
that fawns are hunted. And then there are
Odiva’s Seals.

The Forty Thieves continue to march with
an advance guard of drummers at Melbourne
King’s. It is an impressive sight when the
procession of lady Thieves, attired like a
bal masqnd body of brigands on the moun-
tains, follows a dozen or so beauteous drum-
mers into the Cave, after which George Wil-
loughby, disguised in a glaring yellow busby
and trimmings to match, commands the
Cave to close immediately, in order, as he
explains to the audience, that the where-
abouts of the famous Loot repository may
remain a dark secret. Thus it appears
that, in pantomime times, Robbers, who
made a secret of their movements, invari-
ably did it with their drums flying. Daisy
Yates, Mona Magnet, Brennan, Cannot.
Edgely and Da we, and the rest of them,
seem to be in for a good long period of daily
toil at the King’s, the panto, picking up
approbation from the infant population as it
proceeds. Nevertheless, it might be advis-
able for Cannot to substitute a more
catchy refrain song for the clumsy ditty
which he is struggling to boost into popu-
larity at present.

People remark of “Cairo,” at Melbourne
Majesty’s, that for artless candor in melo-
drama no part of the purpled story exceeds
the end of the first act, where the emissaries
of scowling Prince Hyphen put the head of
the Sultan’s bride in a bag and abduct her
in the careful absence of her groom and
suite. It is a Chinaman’s plot, and has a
true Mongolian antiquity in stage oppor-
tunism. Confucius must have thought of it.
and in the spacious days of Bland Holt the
same system of abduction —the false message
from a parent or other relative —brought
sorrow to many a household. Happily, in
this case, the bride’s despairing thrust at
the bare back of Abdullah enables that
sparsely-clad conspirator to retire dead from
the entertainment and get his clothes on.
This must be satisfactory to the actor
(Harold Franklin), when a cool change
has reduced the temperature to chilly.
Melbourne Royal announces the last nights
of “Maid of the Mountains” and promises an-
other comic opera, now in rehearsal by Oscar
Asche. All the same, the “Maid” remains a
thing of beauty and a joy for future revival.
Meanwhile, a rigid system of flesh-reduction
can be recommended to Chisholm. His
strong baritone warble has not lost any
quality to speak of since the opera came
first to Melbourne, and he talks and walks
considerably better, but his figure surely
whispers words of warning when he inter-
views it in a mirror. Already it weighs
about a stone too much for purposes of high
poetic expression on the stage.

Melbourne Tivoli seemingly wants some-
thing more pungently humorous than G. P.
Huntley’s sketches. After a week of “Wall-
papers” (which was mainly a monologue,
and a weariness to the amphitheatre’s flesh
when it lasted 45 minutes on the first night)
the bill was changed to “Selling a Pup” last
Saturday. Huntley’s large share in the new
sketch is excellent comedy of the sort he
specialises in; also the lady and the pup and
two other characters are satisfactorily
Splayed.". „ .

FIRESTONE
A MAGIC NAME
It is impossible to tell from outward appearance
what extent of mileage a tyre will deliver, but it
is sometimes quite practical to gauge it accurately
from the name on the sidewall.
FIRESTONE is a definite assurance of MOST
MILES PER SHILLING —an assurance that every
week is becoming more significant in the minds
of Australian Motorists. Firestone spells a double
saving few can afford to neglect. Not only does
it mean more miles than you have been able to
buy before, but it means, actually, the lowest price
at which high quality tyres can be legitimately
sold.
FIRESTONE 9 Sstaunchness is based upon absolutely
reliable construction —the double Gum-Dipped Cord
carcass reducing friction to a minimum , and the
air bag process of cure distributing evenly the
strain under load.
It will be of considerable profit to you to see that
your new tyre outfit consists of these SUPERB
VALUE CORDS.

“Dido” : Like most coons, especially coons
in vaudeville, the late Irving Sayles was
an inveterate gambler. He was very ill,
the finish, was supposed to be near at hand,
and the pale black, lying limp and emaciated
on his bed, opened a lack-lustre eye when the
doctor came, fished with a feeble hand under
his pillow, and produced a pound. “Doctor,”
he whispered, “I spose I ain’t gwine to las’
long, and’ there’s jist one thing I’d like you
to do for 'me afore I. done gone dead.” He
slipped the pound into the hand of the
medico. “Get the bes’ price yo’ can fo’ me
about Fay fo’ the handicap to-morrow.” Fay
won, but not before the popular nig. min-
strel had passed out.
“Thor”: How many Sistine Choirs are
there? At latest there were (1) a crowd
singing as usual at the old address; (2) the
organisation under Monsignor Casimiri,
which is still raking, in an honest shekel in
the Chilly land; and (.31 the lot that visited
Australia, the most- accomplished portion of
which is still smalls in Maoriland.
There'may be others. Is it the Sistine Choir
or the Sixteen Choirs?

“Gnarek”: I trust that when “Storky”
Adams held forth at the U.S. National Geo-
graphic he w*as spared the experience which
befell the lecturer who visited our hamlet
with the “Wild Nor’-West” film. When he
had finished spruiking, one of the local heads
solicited more information about the climate
and manners of the Derby hinterland.
“ ’Struth, don’t get too nosey,” was the en-
trepreneur’s reply. “This is me first trip out
of Melbun.”
“T. 0.1.”: A Boxing Day centenary was
that of Dion Boucicault, author and actor.
Of French Huguenot descent —a paternal
ancestor fled from Tours on the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes —he was born in
Lower Gardiner-street, Dublin, son of Samuel
S. Boursiquot, a Jervis-street merchant, who
married a beautiful member of the family
that gave N. S. Wales Chief Justice
1 barley. In 1841 Dion produced his
first ulay. “London Assurance,” at
Covent Garden Theatre. From 1853
to 1860 he was in the United States.
Returning to London he produced “The
Colleen Bawn” at the Adelphi, and “The
Octoroon,” with which plays he toured Aus-
tralia in the ’eighties. His first wife was
Agnes Kelly Robertson, actress and mother
of Dion, Aubrey and Nina ; his second was
Louisa Thorndyke. He died 32 years ago
in the U.S.A.
“Thor”: How
the dancers are
crowding out the
singers in mus'cal
comedy! In “The
O’Brien Girl”
there’s but one
character in the
piece who doesu t
toe-flutter most of
the time, and every
one of Hughie
Ward’s chorus,
even to the least
personable young-
old man who gets
shoved right up-
stage to rub shoul-
ders w.th the back-
cloth, has to show
agility which
would be sufficient
for a solo dancer
in some produc-
tions. Ward’s own
talent was pretty
evenly distributed
between his head
and his legs, and it
was a sure thing
that there would be
much pirouetting
in his in tial show.
He must have had
some agonising
moments during
his Williamson
career in observing
the painful gravity
of the male chor-
isters.

T.W.: Margaret Cooper spent several
years at the more serious side of her art,
and reached sub-professorial dignity in one
of the Smoke’s biggest music-foundries. She
told me at one time that she was making
£BOO a year before teaching nauseated her,
ahd she resolved to tread the sunnier path
of light song. Her nose-in-the-air and
almost contemptuous way of greeting audi-
ences was not a characteristic at the begin-
ning. She cultivated it by way of a pose,
and it was caught up by mimics like Cissie
Loftus and Australian Jimmy Watts.
“Orb”: According to the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, “touring the smalls is a
theatrical practice which deserves encour-
agement,” and it goes on to tell how the
enterprising J. C. W., Ltd., sent out Harry
Roberts and a dramatic co. to Armidale
(N.S.W,), and a few other towns on the
main track to Brisbane. But I can’t have
Armidale, etc., as “smalls.” Goat-and-Gallah,
Boggledoo and Mutton Creek claim that dis-
tinction, and most Australian mummers
know ’em well —Harry Roberts certainly
does —and not always to their sorrow. The
Firm has never been very successful with
country tours. It did “Sign of the Cross”
and such through the country towns more
than 20 years ago, but Dan Barry’s “The
Parson’s Oath” was much more popular.
Absolutely the best smalls tour was that
organised by George Musgrove, who success-
fully invaded the Outback with Nellie
Stewart in “Sweet Nell” and a strong co.
10 years ago. Every mummer in the gang
drew good money, and suffered no “lost time”
either. An orchestra of four, a business
manager, as well as two mechanists, two
property men, two electricians and a ward-
robe lady were non-playing passengers. Yet
G.M. made the tour pay handsomely. He
knew how, and the house was nearly always
sold out at top prices before the Sweet Nell
special train arrived at Bobbra VVobbra or
Sudden Jerk.
“Fax”: The reconstruction and refurnish-
ings of the new Princess’s in Melbourne
have already set the spirit of rivalry at
work. Bailey and Grant have done the
handsome thing by their King’s Theatre, and
the d.c. foyer, which was always effective, is
now outfitted in old gold and fresh glory.
The splendor of the Ward-Fuller establish-
ment is not to have everything its own way.
Why call it the new Princess’s, anyhow?
The Fuller house that Melbourne knew six
months ago was originally called the new
Princess’s, to distinguish it from the old
Princess’s where Genevieve Ward played
“Forget-me-not.” The theatre in its present
form ought to be known as the Renewed
Princess’s.
“Nero” : Dennis’s Malaprop brand of humor
in his stage version of “The Sentimental
Bloke” reminded me of an assistant-treasurer
we had when touring with the Knight-
Jeffries co. One day he informed us that “Miss
Jeffries would not play that night as she
was suffering from platonic poisoning.”
Later on, he gave me some special informa-
tion as to the co.’s movements (I had already
heard about them from the stage carpenter),
but insisted that his communication must
be regarded as infra dig. He it was who
figured in aii oft-told yarn. When the co.
was leaving Auckland one of the ladies was
unable to travel, an increase in the popula-
tion being imminent, so our obliging young
man left this note for her: —
Dear Mrs. Dash, when you are ready to travel, see
Mr. Brown of the Union Co., and he will fix you up
with a good birth.
“Snell”: Pigs had a strange fascination
for George Hackenschmidt, the hefty wrest-
ler, who was in Australia some years ago.
One day his friend, Marmaduke Percy
Adams, came upon him in the centre of a
wonder'ng and ever-increasing circle in
Elizabetli-street, Melbourne, near the station,
wall a plump and wed-grown, blonde p.g
in his arms. Hackie was seated on the
kerb, holding the pig fondly, much as if it
had been a babe, and murmuring soothing and
affectionate words to it. “Ach, but ain’dt he der
dear luldle feller?” said Hackenschmidt to
Adams, and there were tears of fondness in
the eyes of the athlete. “I loof him like my
brudder. Some day I grow a farmhouse,
and bring up plenty pig. Then I be happy
as the day is longest.” At this point a ram-
pant pig-dealer, with several hogs in his
waggon, descended on Hackie, demanding the
return of his pork. Hackie, it seemed, had
just lifted the object of his affection from
the vehicle while the hog expert was tak ; ng
refreshment at a neighboring bar. It called
for all Adams’s powers of persuasion to save
the wrestler from paying a fabulous price
for the pig, and keeping it as a friend.
“Norbell”: “Thor’s” mention of having en-
countered W. F. Grant at Bath interests me.
Grant was a capable actor, indeed, and a
good chap; but he didn’t play Taffy to Edith
Crane’s Trilby. He' played Sandy, the Laird
of Cockpen, and I well remember Hector
Macdonald (“Fighting coming behind
at the Princess’s, Melbourne, one night, and
congratulating his brother Scot on his accent.
Grant returned to Australia a few years
ago, and was Mr. Wu in the play of that
name, but it proved rather a dud.
“Norbell” on a great theatrical family:—
“The O'Brien Girl” recalls more or less success-
ful O’Brien plays of other days. First, of course,
comes Johnny Sheridan’s widow in “Fun on the
Bristol.” The little man unloosed this at the
Theatre Royal, Melbourne, on April 12, 1884,
under the Williamson, Garner and Musgrove flag,
and was promptly cut to pieces by the Argus. This
was no new reception for the widow, who began—
as Mrs. O’Shannessy—at Newport, R. 1., the swagger
Yankee watering-place, and crashed badly. She
—or he—tried again at the 14th-street Theatre,
N’Yark, in 1880, and then got set. Next, Johnny
took a full nasal co. to Manchester, England, open-
ing on May 15, 1882, and he won there all right.
A season of two weeks at the London Olympic fol-
lowed, which stretched to 14 weeks, partly because
the Prince of Wales and his wife came to see the
show. Another O’Brien was “Shamus,” of that ilk,
a play that has been cruelly overworked in the
smalls, through Hay, Hell and Booligal. Charles
Erin Verner introduced “Shamus O’Brien” here
at 11.M.T., Sydney, in May, 1895, when George
Rignold was bossing the show. Dan Barry, who
cheerfully tackled everything that came along, went
bush with “Shamus.” But Dan also did a five-act-
and-prologue bellow, “The O’Brien Family,” a griev-
ous outrage written by one John Walz, an other-
wise blameless Melbourne ratepayer. That ebulli-
tion had one outstanding merit —it was wholly Aus-
tralian.
“Stargazer”: Plain Bill Holloway,
although he appeared the most lvmnhatic
of actors on the boards, used to be
worked up to a high pitch before striding on
to slow music and the plaudits of an affec-
tionate gallery. One night at Melbourne
Royal, when playing a tough who had to
march straight on to the stage and out the
sub-hero with a brick, Bill had received his
cue and was about to start from the wings,
R.U.E., with the Brunswick bouquet in his
duke, when a stagehand hard by fell upon
him with undue violence, and the play was
held up at an important crisis while they
wrestled, half-visible to a shouting audience.
“Look at what you have, Mr. Holloway!”
gasped the employee. Plain William looked.
There were repairs going on behind at the
time, and William, in his natural profes-
sional stress, had caught up a real brick.
When the show was over William said to
the stagehand: “You saved me com-
mitting manslaughter; but seeing it was only
Blank I would have killed, I consider a drink
an adequate reward.” The drinks were
served.
“Orb”: The Playhouse or Little Theatre,
in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, is to come
down, as the Commonwealth Government
wants the site for an auto-’phone ex-

change. It was known originally as
the Royal Standard. Alfred Dampier had a
long run there in the ’eighties. lie did
Shakspeare, “Faust” and bellowdrama, his
most payable effort being "The World
Against Her,” one of Frank Harvey’s
spasms. Comedian John L. Hall had a go
also shortly before he died in the Melbourne
Hospital. Bob Henry ran cheap eurse-you-
die stuff there for some years. There were
sporadic outbreaks of vaudeville and nigger
minstrelsy from time to time, and the place
once flourished as a two-up joint till the
Law intervened. Hugh Buckler and Violet
Page d-d “The Man on the Box,” “Bobby
Burnit,” “Fanny’s First Play,” “The Great
Adventure” and such in 1913. Of late
Gregan McMahon has been producing his
repertory plays there. But mostly the Royal
Standard has waved over rather forlorn
Thespian hopes.
“0.K.” on an impersonator of silly asses:
When all has been said on behalf of G. P. Huntley
and his finished impersonation of the “silly ass’’
who has his headquarters in deah old London, the
large Australian public that loses patience with his
present vaudeville sketch is of much the same mind
as its fathers 18$ years ago. Huntley was the
“star” of the George Edwardes co. which the late
J.C.W. imported in 1904, and he left a name
behind him in Australia. Nevertheless, the venture
that began with “Three Little Maids’’ and ended
with “Kitty Grey” was not a popular success. As
the blase eyeglassed johnnie in those bright musical
comedies Huntley was admired as an artist, who
practically set the type for many imitators. But
the type was appreciated by only some of the audi-
ence, and the clever comedian was only a part of
the show, anyhow. To a lot of young Australians
he was caviare. To many older ones he was
rather tiring, if not irritating. Huntley made his
chief success as Max Hoggenheimer, the German mil-
lionaire in “The Girl from Kay’s,” a character new
to him and out of his line, but a broad caricature
with a wider appeal than the “silly-ass” type. All
the same “The Girl from Kays” ran only three
weeks, like the comedies staged before and after it.
Now that Huntley’s youngish, amiable, eyeglassed
johnnie has matured into an elderly, petulant and
intensely egotistical man about town, in the “Wall-
papers” sketch at Melbourne Tivoli, another public,
mostly children of his old acquaintances, complain
that he makes them , rather tired. He is almost the
whole of the performance, the whole meal, not the
joint with extras. His sketch is mainly a monologue,
all in one strain. The egotist whom the actor now
creates suggests a dismal future for the fiancee he
brings into the shop, and his selfish muddle-headed-
ness seems less forgivable than the traits of the young
lord and the earl he impersonated of old. Huntley pre-
sents a human English fact, or a slight exaggeration
of it, with which Australia is out of sympathy. Be-
sides, it.has lost force through the rough imitations
that have staled it in this country since the polished
original uttered his first unconscious absurdities in
1904.
“S.”: W. A. Robyns was in M.L. in search
of health when the end came, at Wellington,
a few days ago. He was born in N.S.W.
in 1876, and his voice was first heard as a
choirboy at St. John’s Church, Sydney.
Developing a fine bass, he toured with Lem-
rnone and others, and a public subscription
sent him to Europe to study. He played
for a season at Daly’s Theatre, but was
always at his best in classical and oratorio
work. One of his biggest chances was when
he toured with Melba. For the last few
years he had lived in Adelaide.
FILM-HAUNTED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The most amazing things he knows
Of famous picture folk,
Dark secrets of the studios,
And Charlie’s newest joke;
What scent or shaving-soap they use.
Their shape in hats, their size in shoes,
With other throbbing mysteries
Blown over from Los Angeles.
He reads the Sunday paper ads.,
And knows the devious course
Of all his heroes’ freaks and fads,
Each crime and each divorce.
Spurred to it by his strange, new creed,
He wears his hair fllce Wallace Reid;
And girls he takes to see a screeno
He thrills, like Rudolph Valentino.
He scorns an office-boy’s routine,
As something dull and gross, and so
He takes his models from the screen.
But life’s no picture-show.
A Tom Mix stunt he\ rashly tries.
His boss bursts in with angry eyes,
An unromantic, dull old man,
And fires that haunted picture fan.

Where the sun is hot and blazing
On a dreary out-back hell.
Then, in pensive mood, seemed thinking
Of the roaring days of old,
When our diggers holes were sinking,
And of those who missed the gold.
Or his mind may have been dwelling
On our buslimen and their toil.
And the yarns they would be telling
While the blackened billies boil.

This man has no cares!
He’s got the “Kruschen Habit.”
Half the troubles of life
never happen—and the
other half fade away be-
fore the healthy optimism
of the man or woman who
takes care to be healthy.
“Every morning Krus-
chen Salts make a million
optimists”—so the saying
goes. And no truer word
was ever spoken.
Why? Because Krus-
chen health is real health
—health of body and
health of mind.
Headaches, tiredness,
depression, need not exist
for anyone. They are the
result of not taking
enough care of the body’s
health.
The human body is
made up of millions of
cells. These cells should
normally extract what
they need from your food.
But owing to errors of
diet, overwork, anxiety,
worry, sedentary life, and
other causes, your system
does not extract from food
the correct proportions of
the essential life-giving
elements. Kruschen Salts
remedy this deficiency
and ensure abounding
health and energy.
No other salts can com-
pare with Kruschen Salts
for achieving their object,
because no single salt con-
tains the same properties.
There are six salts in
Kruschen, and every one
of them is necessary for
healthy life.
Further, they are present
in correct proportion to
perform their tonic and
eliminating action by re-
storing the liver and kid-
neys to proper activity.
The Kruschen habit of
health is easy to acquire.
Every morning in your
breakfast-cup of tea put in
enough Kruschen Salts to
cover a sixpence—that
much and no more. Taken
this way, Kruschen Salts
are tasteless, and in one
bottle there is enough to
last three months and
more: less than a farthing
a day for eager, strenuous,
optimistic health. Get a
bottle at any chemist’s to-
day and start at once.
r a
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will lie
on a sixpence. It’s the
little daily dose that does
it.
á
Good health for a farthing a day.
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
to be just the right amount for a
most invigorating daily tonic. The
medicinal dose for persons suffer-
ing from pains of Rheumatism and
Gout or habitual Constipation, with
inactive liver, etc., is half to one
teaspoonful in a tumbler of hot
water before breakfast. Every
Chemist sells Kruschen Salts—each
bottle contains 96 morning “six-
pencefuls ■—enough 'to last three
months. Get a bottle to-day.

“G.”: There is a mystery about Victorian
butter. The price varies with the locality,
the rule seeming to be the closer to Mel-
bourne the lower the price. It attains its
maximum at Colac, drops a point at Kyne-
ton, and passes, with diminished prestige,
through Geelong to its last stage, when it
is described merely as “cooking butter.”
* * * *
“Sucre”: In Sydney motor “carry-alls”
seem to have pushed Fraser’s trams practi-
cally off the suburbs of Rose Bay, Double
Bay and Darlinghurst. Every tram from
sunrise to the city is well filled with empty
seats these days. Fraser foolishly turned his
nose up at the competition when it first
appeared, and now his bottom lip hangs like
a home signal when the line is clear.
* * * *
“Min Yip”: “U.P.” (B. 14/12/’22)
needn’t lose sleep over the Japs buying stud
sheep. In Japan sheep are almost as rare as
elephants are in Australia. One reason is the
presence of a poisonous weed which is so
plentiful that, to keep sheep alive, their fod-
der has to be imported. In any case, if
“U.P.” paid a visit to Japan and saw the
local methods of cultivation, he would never
worry again about the Japs starting sheep-
stations. In fertile areas one to three
acres makes a holding; while the part which
is labelled “unfertile” won’t carry a goat to
10 acres.
* * * *
“Chris” : Unless the leviathans of the deep
which disport themselves off the Shivery
Isles coasts are protected by law, similarly to
the slithery seal, they will soon be as extinct
as is the high-stepping moa. A century ago
the oil and whalebone business in Maoriland
waters was a really good thing, as the yields
were large and so were the prices. Now, in
a twelvemonth, from 149 whales only £20,000
worth of products was secured, although the
most improved appliances were used by the
fishers. A fleet of well-equipped Norwegian
whaling craft, which specially visited the
Shaky Isles a few years ago, had a very
rough spin financially.
* * * #
“Te Babarantiko” : Passenger fares, on the
Australian-European overseas route eastward,
are coming down. The Orient line has re-
duced the first-class saloon fares from £l7O
to £134, and £l3O to £114; second saloon
from £lO5 to £B6 and £l2O to £9O, and third-
class in lesser ratio. The Italian Sabaudo
Lloyd line has followed suit. Trans-Pacific,
Sydney to ’Frisco fares remain at £6O, £4O
and £27 10s. From being as low as $3.75,
the quid has risen to $4.60 and over, so that,
without putting up the fares a penny, the
American and the Maoriland company are an
even £5 to the good on the first-class fare,
and proportionately on the second and third.
* * * *
“Parama”: There’s a valuable hardwood
growing throughout the western division of
Papua which only, needs to be known. It
resembles the “sneezewood” tree of Cape
Colony in many respects, and grows to
about the same height—looft. It is tough
and durable, takes a good polish, is
white-ant proof, and withstands the attacks
of the ship-worm no matter how long it is
submerged in sea water. So far this tree
seems to be unknown as a commercial asset.
Some tribes use it for arrowheads, but as
a rule the wood is too hard for the natives
to bother about. Yet the white man should
have no trouble in handling it with modern
tools and machinery.
* * * *
“Audio”: “Russ” (B. 7/12/’22) is a bit
misleading when he states that “Yankee-
land has been our main supplier of wireless
vacuum tubes, generally known as valves.”
They certainly come from there, and from
the U.K., too, but the Wireless Company has
been manufacturing them in Sydney for the
last three years. The writer has used the
local article, and it measures up well as a
serviceable valve, and is cheaper than the
imported. Coastal radio operators give
similar testimony, and it may be further cor-
roborated in the forthcoming Trans-Pacific
amateur tests. Importers of Japanese
valves may .find that in handling wireless
valves there are such things as other people’s
patent rights.
* * * *
“Ashmead” : Although the Speck has as much
fertile soil as any island of its size, there are
patches of very poor ground, particularly
where the tin-scatchers operate. About the
only useful vegetation that this gravelly-
sandy soil will support is the cygnet-pine.
Conservator-of-forests Irby has just done
a trip around the tin-fields in the north-east,
particularly at Gladstone and Pioneer, and is
convinced, from the thriving condition of the
trees already planted, that it will be worth
while to start nurseries of cygnet-pines on
selected patches. It is figured out that five
years after transplantation the trees will
make valuable many acres that are now waste
and barren.
* * * *
“Bozzer B.”: The death knell has been
rung of the little back room, with the well-
stocked cupboard, in Victorian hotels. It
was the resort of legitimate after-hours’ cus-
tomers. The amending bill recently passed,
however, declares that a “bar” is a “bar
room,” meaning “any room in which liquor
is kept, and in which, or through any open-
ing in which, liquor is directly served to cus-
tomers.” In future it will not be permis-
sible to stand before the cupboard and have
the last one before toddling off to bed. The
licensee must get it from somewhere else and
bring it to you. The trade has been warned
that adherence to the old order will entail
a penalty of £lO.
* * * *
“Prof.”: “Gin Sling” should put more
water with it. His suggestion that the
green pawpaw fruit is dangerous, on account
of the arsenic contained it it (B. 21/12/’22),
is absurd. The fruit in its unripe state is
commonly used in the place of vegetable
marrow, which it very closely resembles
when boiled. No ordinary process of cook-
ing would remove arsenic from food, nor
would ripening of the food have the slightest
effect on arsenic, if it were there. The plain
fact, of course, is that arsenic is a plant as
well as an animal poison, and never occurs
in any vegetable organism. Incidentally,
being so toxic to plant life, it is used as the
basis of chemical sprays for the eradication
of prickly-pear, lantana, etc.

Messrs Beale and Company Ltd.,

To find a piano of so sympathetic
and delightful a tone-quality as the New
Beale is a pleasure to any musician.
In the hands of a skillful accom-
panist it supports a violinist’s efforts on
a melody of perfect texture—inspiring
one to a degree of energy, fire and mag-
netism that can never he kindled by the
mediocre instrument.
I hope l shall always have the in-
spiration of a piano as good as the New
Beale.
Yours faithfully,
HENRY STAELL
Siaell JeliqhteS wH/Zj
y the yVewy3ealet^ia7io.
MR. STAELL, solo-violinist to the late State Conservatorium
Orchestra, finds in the New Beale a sympathetic friend.
Only recently he played "Hejre Kate”— that dazzlingly brilliant piece
of technique -to an accompaniment on the New Beale Piano and
his admiration for the tone-quality of the instrument took the form
of a letter which we print above.
To produce a concert instrument over which such a musician as
Mr. Staell will enthuse is a very great source of gratification to this
organisation. It encourages us to believe that a painstaking effort to
produce in Australia a piano of quality will be certain of ultimate
recognition.
The New Beale is sold on one, two, three or even four years terms.
Used instruments taken in part exchange. Furnished in walnut,

“Stellsby”: Add to “Sehnorrer’s” (B.
14/12/’22) list of the Chosen, whose names
are no guide to the faith of their fathers, the
citizen whose well-known establishments
(“Keith’s”) in Melbourne and P’ran are
women’s whole existence —in fashions and
flimsies. The Scotchbyterian Hebrew’s full
name is Keith Moses. Sounds doubly thrifty.
“Mujik” provides the requiem:—
Two conspicuous crashes in the Maoriland elec-
tions were the thuds registered by Tom Seddon in
Westland and Vigor Brown at Napier. Brown, who
bottomed the poll, is a brother of the one-time Vic.
celebrity, “Dry Dog.” He began with softgoods
and a hatred of Seddon. Later he acquired a brew-
ery and developed an ardent affection for the works
of J. Ward. Subsequently he went back on his
tracks and publicly worshipped at the . shrine of
Massey. An old man now, he finishes up with many
ducats and the bird. One wonders whether it was
ail worth while. Tom Seddon, while still studying
law, was dragged into the limelight on his father’s
death and hurried away to keep the old man’s seat
in the family. Of course, old Dick's mana was
great in the land, and the fair-haired, affable young
man, who bears no sort of resemblance to him, went
in with three cheers. But Time soon found Tom
out, and a generation of electors contracted the
franchise-exercising habit to whom the name Seddon
meant no more than a rumor. Tom served in the
war, and his elder brother was among the killed.
“Louis E.”: Bess Norriss, the Melbourne
artist, who has sold one of her miniatures
to the Toronto Art Gallery, has quite estab-
lished herself as the best miniature painter
in England. For years she has exhibited at the
Royal Academy, the International and other
shows, her work, which is full of personality
easily outshining that of any possible rival.
As Mrs. J. Tait, wife of the impresario, she
ifas a house in Chelsea, which has become
a regular beehive where swarm silvery
tenors, sculptors, portrait-painters, fiddlers,
music-hall stars and piano virtuosi, as well as
distinguished and undistinguished visitors.
Many a struggling Australian artist, painter
or musician, has owed a good deal to the
friendly help of the lively and unconven-
tional little lady who hates the bad as in-
tensely as she loves the good, and fre-
quently startles the natives by the wit and
freedom of her Australian speech.
“Wimrnen is rummy creatures,” remarked

with ye,’ she snorts, and turns her back, but
I could see she kept looking at me out of
the coiner of ’er eye, all the same. Well, 1
was just lettin’ some slack out o’ me braces,
when just then a race started. ‘They’re off.’
everyone yelled, and blime if the old woman
didn’t faint. Wot it is ter be r’espectabul!”
“Norbell”: That par., giving the Newtown
(Sydney) “bereavement notice” concerning
the demise of the “dear doggie, Ginger” (B.
28/12/’22), reminds me of an ad. in the
Auckland Herald a couple of months back.
It ran: “Mr. and Mrs. Zero desire to tender
their sincere thanks to the Children who
found their Ducks.”
“F.A.” : Re “M.P.A.’s” New York “Strong-
arms.” Australia’s nearest approach to that
organisation is, of course, the Police Patrol,
but in the days when “pushes” gave battle
to all and sundry, the police were called upon
to mop up, very often single-handed. One
outstanding cop in this line of business, 20
years ago, was Constable Michael Walsh, of
Melbourne, in the vernacular as “Mad
Mick.” Walsh was a man of nearly 50 when
he broke up the push that hung about the
railway viaduct in Flinders-street and the
freezing works on the wharf side of it. In
his more peaceful moments, Mick used to col-
lect truant firemen for the intercolonial ship-
masters, and it was no uncommon sight to
see him arrive at the gangway of an outward-
bound Maoriland mailboat with a brace of
shickered and struggling coal-pushers, one
under each arm. The injury which led to
his death was received during a “convivial”
evening at Footscray.
One of Australia’s historic rides was made
by Willie Horn, just dead in London. He
was a youngster on Wallaroo sheep-
station (S. Aus.) when the great copper-
mine was discovered there in 1861, and he
was sent to Adelaide in a hurry by Walter
Watson Hughes to register a mining lease.
A rival party had seven hours’ start, but
didn’t expect pursuit. Just back from a
40-mile ride, Horn started at 4 p.m., and
was in Adelaide at 8 in the morning. He
had made a detour to dodge the other party,
and always reckoned his ride as 164 miles in
22 hours. Somewhere in the night he must
have dozed from sheer fatigue, and the mare
lie was riding on that particular stage turned
and w r ent home to her foal, and presently
Horn found himself back at the farm where
he had borrowed her. His one companion
collapsed near Gawler, and his last horse
gave out at North Adelaide; so he had to do
the last bit of the journey on fdot.
“O. P. Hand” : Walter Madden, managing-
director of the National Trustees Co. (Vic.),
is the only survivor of the O’Loghlen Minis-
try (1881-1883). He was not an original
selection for that team. When David Gaun-
son crashed at Ararat, after taking office,
Madden came into the picture as Minister
for Lands, on Aug. 19, 1881. Horsham
dropped him in 1894, and he didn’t re-enter
Parliament. In 1893 he looked like a pos-
sible Premier, but he was not pushing enough
in his own interests. He did better outside
Parliament. H. R. Williams beats him by
a year for the honor of senior Executive
Councillor of Vic.
Christmas-tide saw the end of Charles
White, a lifelong Inky Wayfarer. He was
born at Bathurst (N.S.W.), his father being
the owner of the local Free Press, a paper
which Charles eventually edited. When the
Free Press and Bathurst Times amalga-
mated he came to Sydney and ran an agri-
cultural sheet. White will be best remem-
bered by his “History of Australian Bush-
rangers” and “Convict Chronicles,” pub-
lished some years ago and in several editions.

MISS EDITH DRAYSON,
A Beautiful Rexona Girl.
All Rexona Girls are Pretty,
Dainty and Attractive, and one of
the most beautiful is Miss Edith
Drayson, who appeared with great
success in 'Cairo, at Her Majesty s
Theatre, Sydney.
Miss Drayson thinks the world of
Rexona Soap, and writes us as fol-
lows:
“I find that Rexona Soap is by
far the best shampoo for the hair.
It is delightful to use, and excellent
for the skin. I shall always be a
Rexona Girl.”
Rexona Soap for Health
and Beauty.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can
be obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary
toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the
best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same
soothing, healing, antiseptic bal-
sams as Rexona, the Raph «.iealer,
the value of which in the treat-
ment of skin affections is known
throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once or
twice a day, and see if it does
not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, lessen the tendency to
pimples, and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

SOME DAY YOU’LL BE SORRY
that you cannot box. When you find
yourself facing the bully your size
and strength will not help you but
SCIENCE will. Don’t envy others
for their coolness and confidence in a
scrap. Be envied yourself. Think how
humiliating it would be to be beaten
by a man smaller than yourself;
think of the jeers of the onlookers
and the taunts of your pals. When
the day comes it will be too late for
regrets.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the long story of the British Army,
between Hastings and Mons, there
have existed, from time to time, many
remarkable corps, some of them merely tem-
porary and others more or less per-
manent. With hardly any exception, they
have always been fighters. That has been
a characteristic common to them all —or
nearly all.
But their other characteristics have been
as numerous and as varied as those which
distinguish the races of mankind. Compare
the cavalry of Edward I. with Cromwell’s
Ironsides, the bowmen of Crecy with
French’s riflemen in the “Old Contempt-
ibles,” the artillery that breached Plarfleur
with that which put down barrages in No
Man’s Land with 18-pounders and “Hows”
half-a-dozen years ago. Contrast, as a par-
ticular comparison, a battalion of the Guards
with one of the A.I.F.
There is this infinite variety throughout
all the history of British soldiering. In the
same army—as, for instance, the infantry—
there has ever been the utmost difference
between individual units. But never, in all
that long chronicle, has there been a body
of troops so entirely “different” as that one
which was specially raised to garrison New
South Wales in the last decade of the 18th
century. The New South Wales Corps, his
Majesty’s 102nd Regiment of Foot, was
unique. It was more remarkable than any
other regiment Fas ever been —-and this
despite the fact that it had an existence of
little more than 20 years, saw no active
service and was not deeply lamented when
it died. , ,
From its very birth, the N.S.W. Corps had
something of the characteristics of a com-
mercial enterprise. It was, as it were, put
on the market by a company-promoter.
The military force which accompanied
Captain Phillip, when he sailed from Ports-
mouth with the 11 ships of the First Fleet
to colonise Botany Bay, consisted of three
companies of the Royal Marine Light In-
fantry, who were selected to do temporary
garrison work in - New South Wales —prin-
cipally for the reason that the expedition
had been entrusted to the Admiralty, and
was more or less of a naval enterprise. The
Governor was a post-captain of the Royal
Navy, as was also his second-in-command,
Captain Hunter. But it was obvious, from
the beginning, that this detachment of the
Sea Regiment would have to be relieved by
some portion of the land forces of Great
Britain at the earliest opportunity. In
those troublous times —the French Revolu-
tion was rapidly approaching—the War
Office looked with little favor upon the
notion of employing a battalion of regular
troops of the line for the purpose of guard-
ing convicts in a new possession of Eng-
land that was far beyond the edge of the
World That Mattered. Such an idea seemed
equivalent to using trained troops to staff
Newgate or the county gaols, or to look
after the Bridewells and debtors’ prisons of
the metropolis. It was not to be thought
of. But something had to be thought of,
and at the Horse Guards, where the pro-
cess of thinking has always been difficult,
the problem was a little puzzling. To the
immense relief of everybody concerned, the
company-promoter came along.
Major Grose was an officer looking for
employment, and his was the bright idea of
raising a special body of troops to garrison
and do police work in New South Wales.
The officers of the Marine detachment at
Sydney had entered vigorous protest against
the employment of their men in the latter
capacity—so much so that Phillip had been
compelled to recruit his constabulary from
the ranks of the convicts themselves. What
was required was a body of men who would
do anything —even to the extent of becoming
hangmen if necessary. Grose proposed that,
for certain considerations not without
advantage to himself, he should be empow-
ered to raise a corps of this description-
officers and men, it was tacitly understood,
as to whose antecedents too strict inquiry
should not be made and who would be pre-
pared to do any dirty work required of
them on the further understanding that
thev’might be allowed to make what they
could in addition to receiving the usual
army’ rates of pay and allowances for foreign
service The War Office jumped at the idea,
welcomed it eagerly, almost shed tears of
gratitude upon its originator, and turned the
Major loose to do what he could. Thus this
nernarkable body came into being.
Its officers were not all scallywags and
blacklegs—though some of them were un-
doubtedly such. Its non-commissioned offi-
cers, in the first instance, were mostly _ old
soldiers who welcomed a chance of continu-
ing to practise the only trade .they knew,
even if it might be outside the world they
were familiar with. The private soldiers
who constituted its rank and file were such
as Major Grose could best get hold of.
Some were “King’s bad bargains,” whom
commanding officers of existing corps were
only too glad to be rid of, and only too
thankful to hand over to the Major upon a
guarantee that they would never be troubled
with them again. A great many were des-
perate, poverty-stricken men of the sort
whom Captain Kidd or William Morgan
would have welcomed as the makings of
thoroughly efficient pirates. A large propor-
tion were pure and simple gaolbirds, to
whom the opportunity of serving his Majesty
as soldiers in any outlandish quarter of the
globe came as a -welcome alternative to serv-
ing him m the hulks and the prisons of
Great Britain as convicts. Not a few re-
cognised that this was their one hope of
escaping the gallows. The Major had little
difficulty in filling up the nominal roll of
his picturesque battalion. A recruit might
be, or might have been, anything—so long
as he came up to the not very high physical
standard required. It was not necessary for
him to provide references as to character.
Of the commissioned ranks, it may be gen-
eralised that the type of officer who would
leave Europe and the chances of achieving
distinction in his profession which those
warlike times so freely offered, was not a
very keen soldier. On the face of things, so
much as that is evident. But some of them,
and the best —such as William Gox, John
Piper, William Paterson, Edward Abbott and
John Macarthur —were poor men who had
married early and were hard pushed to live
respectably at home. Others were officers
of the Militia who took this chance of en-
tering the regular army. A small propor-
tion were unqualified black sheep from other
regiments whose messes did not want them
and whose commanding officers had freely
hinted that by joining the new regiment they
might hope to avoid compulsory retirement
from the army. The alternative offered was
—“Go to Botany Bay or be cashiered.” So
they went to Botany Bay. One or two—•
notably George Johnston, the regiment’s
most famous second-in-command, who was
the military leader of the Bligh rebellion,
had been officers in the first garrison of
Marines. And this brings us to the fact
that the corps had a stiffening of some of
the best sort of soldiers that England pos-
sessed. When it relieved the Marines in
1792, such of the latter as were willing were
given the option of remaining in New South
Wales on condition that they should take
service in the corps, and a good many did so.
Thus, after a somewhat lengthy preamble,
designed to explain a little of his environ-
ment, do we arrive at Corporal Tiger, as
he was known in the corps in the year of
grace 1804, who was one of these Marines
who had elected to take a “shore job,” and
had remained in New South Wales when
the three companies went home in ’92. His
proper name was Bartholomew Bracegirdle.
Bracegirdle had landed in Sydney in
January, 1788, as a lad of 18 and a private
in Captain Meredith’s company of Marines.
Four years afterwards, when the detachment
went homfe, he had elected to remain here,
and had accordingly been drafted into the
N.S.W. Corps, when, as a youngster of 22,
he was probably—with the exception of that
giant of a man, Lieutenant and Quarter-
master Laycock—the best physical specimen
of manhood in the battalion. He was also
its very finest athlete —and even though this
might not have been a great thing in such
a debauched regiment as the Rum Corps
was, he was one who could have taken a
first place anywhere amongst men who excel
in feats of endurance and strength.
Fifty years after the period with which
this story has to do, that eccentric athlete,
the Flying Pieman, used to perform for
trifling wagers amazing feats of running
and walking in New South Wales—such as
beating the coach to Windsor on foot, carry-
ing a live sheep from Campbelltown to Syd-
ney, in almost incredibly brief time, or walk-
ing to Parramatta and back faster than a
horse could trot the distance. He would
have found a worthy rival in Bracegirdle—
perhaps the only rival that might have been
provided for him in the century in which
both of them spent the years of their splen-
did manhood. But Bracegirdle was dead
long before George King was wont to aston-
ish Australia with his performances.
A 60-mile walk on a Sunday was no un-
usual thing for the young soldier to under-
take. Once he had swum from Sydney Cove
to Manly Beach and back without a rest —
preceded and followed closely by two boats
to discount the danger of attack by sharks.
He was easily the best man with his fists
'’in the settlement, the best wrestler, the
best runner and the longest jumper. And
he was a quiet, good-natured, ruddy-cheeked
young fellow out of Devonshire, who was
possibly the steadiest soldier in the Corps—
which, however, is not to say very much.
But by reason of his athletic prowess he
had an influence for good in his company
that easily made it physically the fittest
in the regiment. He was, unofficially, its
physical culturist. As a whole, it drank
less rum and went in more for open-air
sports than any of the others, and the spirit
of emulation aroused in its individual mem-
bers by Bracegirdle’s prodigies of exercise
made it, perhaps, the only really sound and
fit unit in the battalion.
Governor Hunter, it was, who gave him
the name of “Tiger”—having witnessed some
astonishing feat of the sort the officers of
the Corps delighted in getting him to per-
form on high days and holidays.
“My dear Paterson,” the old sailor had
exclaimed enthusiastically in the presence
of everybody—“the man is a miracle —a per-
fect tiger, by George!” , And the name had
stuck. * - •
On the night of March 4, 1804, Brace-
girdle was corporal of the guard at the
old barracks in Sergeant-Major’s-row—
which became George-street in Macquarie’s
time. They were nearer the Cove than those

tells a Story 1
few of us realise how precious good health is until we
begin to lose it. To be well is to enjoy life and make
good times for those around us. To be constantly ailing
is to miss life’s pleasures and to look with envy upon our
robust friends and neighbors.
Are you one of the unfortunates?
Is your health slowly slipping away? It’s time, then, you
looked to your kidneys!
Much sickness of to-day is traceable to kidney weakness.
Its increase is alarming. That’s because it’s usually
unseen or neglected.
But it’s easy to tell if your kidneys are weak. You may
have only backache, dizzy spells, headaches, or annoying
bladder irregularities.
If you have these symptoms, suspect your kidneys! Remember that delay may result in serious
kidney sickness.
If you’ve reason to suspect your kidneys, read the story of these Sydney residents, who have won back
good health through Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the world’s best-recommended kidney remedy.
Doan’s have helped thousands. They should help you! Ask your neighbor!
TWO SYDNEY RESIDENTS SPEAK.
TWO YEARS CURED.
Mr. Geo. A. Skinner, 37 Goodhope Street, Paddington, says:—“As a
result of a bad cold which settled on my kidneys, I suffered agony from
backache and was often so bad that I had to lie up, not being able to move
without enduring torture. The kidney secretions were very much disordered,
being thick and cloudy, and I could not even turn in bed without ;» stab-like
pain striking me across the loins. I took all kinds of kidney medicines,
but nothing gave me any permanent relief, and I was at a loss to know what
to do for a cure. A friend, hearing how I was suffering, suggested I should
try. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I bought some at once, and after
taking them for a few days I was delighted to find they were doing me good.
In a week or so I felt ever so much better, and by the time I had used
five or six bottles I was completely cured. That was two years ago, and
I am still well, but I always keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house
ap d take them now and again, as a tonic for the kidneys.”
SEVEN YEARS CURED.
Mrs. H. Sturgeon, 70 Marlborough Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, says :
“It gives me great pleasure to say a few words in praise of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. For a good while I was a martyr to kidney trouble,
the symptoms being backache, urinary disorder and attacks. My
back ached fearfully and every movement was accompanied with a twinge
like the stab of a knife. The secretions were cloudv and scalded a good
deal in passing, this symptom clearly showing my kidneys were very much
out of order. I heard good reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so
decided to give them a trial. The first bottle gave me relief, and by the time
I had used three bottles I was cured, and I have been well ever since, a
period of over twelve months.”
Six years later Mrs. Sturgeon says:—“My cure still holds good, no
sign of kidney disorder having returned since I took Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills seven years ago.”

present Wynyard-square.
It had been a hot day, and the night was
warm and sultry. Just on midnight a man
came running up to the gates in a state of
hurry and excitement, and was challenged
and halted by the sentry.
“ ’Tis a note from th’ Gov’nor,” he ex-
claimed breathlessly—“for Major Johnston,
an’ I’m to see he gets it immediate,”
“Damme, man, th’ Major’s abed; ye’d not
be for wakin’ him oop this time o’ night!”
protested the sentry.
“I tell ’ee he must have it —to onct. ’Tis
Cap’n King’s own orders.”
"Corp’ral!” called the sentry, turning to-
wards the guard-room door. “Corp’ral
Tiger—l mean, Bracegirdle—plaize to step
out here.”
In a moment the tall form of the Corporal
of the guard appeared on the verandah,
the horn lantern that hung in the guard-
room in his hand.
“What’s th’ trouble, now?” he inquired,
holding up the light to see the messenger.
He recognised Captain King’s coxswain,
whose red face was further flushed with
excitement. “Why, ’tes Billy Arbuckle!
What’s ’mazin’ ’ee, Billy?”
“Corp’ral, ’tis a note for th’ Major from
Cap’n King, to be give him at onst. Man,
’tis a desprit business. Th’ dam’ Croppies
ha’ broke out at Castle Hill, an’ word’s just
come in from Par’matta. Ye must wake
the Major.”
Bracegirdle started.
“Th’ Croppies!” he whistled, to express
his astonishment, and turned to meet the
sergeant, stretching himself and yawning in
the doorway. “Did ’ee hear that, Sar’n’t?
The b—y Irish has broke loose at Parra-
matta, an’ here’s a note from th’ Gov’nor
for th’ Major!”
“Hell and damnation !” said the sergeant
thoroughly awake. “Send him along at
once. Do you go with him, Tiger, an’ rouse
th’ Major yourself. ’Tis, no doubt, impor-
tant. Hurry now!” be demanded.
So Major Johnston was roused from his
slumbers, and things began to happen imme-
diately. The bugles sounded the “Assembly”
in the square, and the sleepy, wondering
soldiers were speedily on parade. Whatever
was in the Governor’s note had electrified
the Major.
“Bless my soul!” he said to the adjutant,
Lieutenant Minchin. “We must start at
once —a company. Which one, Minchin ! Oh,
but there’s no question. It must be ‘C’—
they’re the best-conditioned lot of men in
the regiment. And Bbacegirdle, he’s on
guard—but have him relieved, and send him
with us. I’ll wmnt him to set the pace. His
Excellency says that at half-past 9, when
Abbott despatched his message from Parra-
matta, the rebels were approaching the town
and were expected to attack at any moment.
Fifty rounds of ball cartridge and a day’s
rations. And hurry! There’s no time to
waste. A tot of rum for the men before
they march. I’ll go with them myself. Good
God! Captain Abbott’s got but a half-com-
pany out there! I pray God we may be in
time. We must move off at 1 o’clock.”
It was just after the hour of one when
the little contingent marched through the
barrack gates and up Sydney’s main thor-
oughfare, on the road to Parramatta, which
was still but a track through the bush, with
one or two rough bridges thrown across the
deeper creeks. The most usual means of
communication between the two villages was
by water, but to Major Johnston, on this
occasion, there was but one route available.
Whatever stands to the discredit of the
Corps, there cannot be any possible doubt
that that night’s march, and the marching
of the day that followed, was an achieve-
ment of which any body of troops might
well be proud. There is not much that can
be said in favor of the regiment during its
brief and blackguardly career, but this per-
formance is worth considering, and even
marvelling at.
The distance to Parramatta is little short
of 15 miles. The company under Major
Johnston reached there in three hours —just
at 4 o’clock. They were in full marching
order, and the stiff leather stock that con-
fined their throats was in itself a handicap
that would have made three miles an hour
extremely good going. Yet they did five!
And on the following day, during their pur-
suit of the unfortunate Irish insurgents—
mostly prisoners transported over the ’9B
rebellion —-some of them, at least, must have
done very nearly 50 miles before sunset.
One doubts very much whether this record
has ever been beaten —even by the French
Foreign Legion in North Africa, whose pace
in the desert is 50 kilometres a day. And
all the rest they were allowed when they got
to Parramatta was 20 minutes !
That sad day’s dojngs are an old and almost
forgotten story now. It is most fully told in
Governor King’s dispatches to the Secretary
of State —though only, of course, from the
official point of view. He encloses Major
Johnston’s account of the day’s work done
by his soldiers and himself in the Parramatta
district, in which he tells how, after the 20
minutes’ rest at the barracks, he divided
his force and went in search of the rebels.
Martial law had been proclaimed in the
colony, and he was prepared to deal with
them to the full extent of the powers such
a proclamation conferred upon him. With
a small party of infantry and a few mounted
men he came up with the main body of the
ill-armed rabble in the afternoon at a point
between Castle Hill and Toongabbie. After
a brief parley the leaders were taken —the
principal one having been mortally wounded
by Quarter-master Laycock. In Johnston’s
terse phraseology, “we immediately hung
them up.” A general pursuit of the fleeing
convicts took place, which was freely punc-
tuated by shootings and bayonetings on the
part of the soldiers. The revolt was crushed
in 15 minutes, but the rebel-hunt continued
for the best part of two days—in a fashion
that was as thorough as it was merciless.
When the 400 convicts on the hill-crest
broke and fled, Corporal Tiger was standing
with the main body of the 30 rank and file,
whom Major Johnston had under his com-
mand. He looked the freshest and least
fatigued of any of them.
“Damme, Bracegirdle,” Mr. Laycock had
said to him, as they trudged up the hill,
“you look as if you were enjoying this walk
of ours! For my part, I’ve nearly had
•enough of it. I wish I had your condition.
’Tis small wonder they call you ‘Tiger’!”
The Corporal grinned cheerfully.
“Aw —’tes naught, y’r honor —’tes but a
bit of a stroll in the ) night. I could do
another like it this eve.’’
Mr. Laycock grunted, but said nothing. He
was a little jealous, perhaps, of his brother
giant’s prowess. Now, when the rebels
bolted, he looked round hastily, and bellowed
for Bracegirdle, who ran up beside him.
“See that big fellow, Corporal—him with
the yellow hair? lie fired a pistol at the
Major. I saw him. After him—you can
run him down. Look—there he goes! Past
that big tree with the black trunk. Quick,
or ye’ll lose him. Fetch him back here.
We’ll make an example of him. I’ve no
doubt he’s one of their leaders. Off with yop !”
The Tiger paused a moment, to make sure
of his man. He unfixed and sheathed his
bayonet, “trailed” his musket, and started
off; By this time the big fair-haired convict
had nearly a hundred yards start. He was
making down the slope to a gully with a
watercourse in it, beyond which lay a tall
forest of gum-trees, with dense scrub and
undergrowth covering the ground beneath
them. He had but fifty yards to go to gain
this cover.
It was after 5 o’clock, and the sun sent
slanting rays through the long grass on the
sparsely timbered hill that made it gleam
and shine and look as though the slope had
been polished and burnished. It was dried
up and withered by the hot days of the pass-
ing summer, and was slippery underfoot, so
that the Corporal found some difficulty in
keeping his feet as :he ran after his quarry
down towards the Fully. Presently, with a
rattle of accoutrements, he went down with
a crash full length upon his face. With a
brief curse, he picked himself up and re-
sumed the chase. But a yellow head was
across the gully, and had gained the shelter
of the big timber and the scrubby undergrowth.
“After him, Tiger!” he heard Mr. Lay-
cock’s great voice booming from the hill-
top, above the noise of the desultory musket-
firing that was going on, the howling of the
running rebels, and the yells of the excited
soldiers chasing them. “After him—catch
him !”
He took the little rivulet at the bottom of
gully in a flying leap, and dashed into the
scrub at the point where he had seen the
escaping convict enter it. It was still, and
cool and shady beneath the big trees, and he
could hear his man crashing through the
undergrowth ahead. His track through the
broken, parted bushes was easily to be fol-
lowed, and Bracegirdle knew from the sounds
that he was gaining on the convict, who had
the handicap of having to break through the
virgin scrub.
Well into the forest the chase led him.
Once, in an open glade, the sunlight flashed
for a moment on the hunted man’s blonde
hair, and the hunter caught a glimpse of
him stumbling forward through the bush as
if exhausted. He redoubled his own efforts
—and then lost sight of the other almost
immediately. Presently the ground dipped
again into a narrow creek —or it may have
been a bend of the watercourse on the edge
of the forest. The little ravine was full of
a dense growth of vines, some of which were
prickly and tore his clothing. But he forced
a way through, and clambered up the oppo-
site bank. Here he paused, to try and hear
which way his man was running.
But there was no sound of the crashing
through the scrub or the cracking of snapped
twigs, by which he had hitherto been able to
trace the other’s flight. Everything was
very still and hushed, and nothing but the
chirping of little birds sounded in the tim-
ber. Once, he heard a single distant musket
shot —but the firing seemed to have died
away, and he could hear no shouting. Every-
thing seemed to be quiet on the hill where
the troops and the insurgents had encoun-
tered one another. But which way was the
liill V It suddenly dawned upon the Tiger
that he was lost. Well, he would find him-
self again—but in the meantime he must
find the man whom Mr. Laycock had sent
him after. He pushed through the scrub on
the bank of the creek, and stepped out into
an opening in the.forest that was clear of
undergrowth.
There, on a fallen tree-trunk, sat the man
with yellow hair, his hands covering his face
—and he looked as if he was sobbing.
Raising his musket, the Corporal covered
the convict. “Stand up,” he commanded,
“and take y’r hands from y’r face !”
Slowly his prisoner rose to his feet, and
did as he was told.
“Great God A’mighty!” gasped Corporal
Tiger. “ ’Tes Bessie Cobley. I’ th’ name
o’ God, Bess, what do ’ee here?”
It was a woman who confronted him —a
magnificent specimen of a woman, only a
few inches shorter than he was himself. Her
golden hair was cut short, and she wore the
rough and tattered clothing of a male con-
vict—but at this close range there was no
mistaking her sex.
“What do ’ee here?” he repeated.
•‘Come, lass —I’ll do ’ee no harm. Where’s
Tom —where’s y’r man?”
Then she spoke.
“Tom was at th’ stockade at Castle Hill.
That lying Swine.y had him sent up
there from Parramatta, for insolence. I
walked out from Sydney for to see him, an’
was at th’ stockade yestereve, when th’ risin’
broke out. Tom went with ’em—so I went,
too. What be ye a-goin’ to do wi’ me, Tiger?”
For a few moments the Corporal was
silent. Then he put bis left hand in his
pocket, and pulled out three Spanish dollars.
“Take these, Bess, an’ try an’ make back
to Sydney. Give th’ troops a wide berth.
I don’t know what’s come o’ Tom —but
you’re a strong woman. Strong as meself.
You can get back down the river, somehow.
If I take ye back to Mr. Laycock, who sent
me after ye, ’tis like enough ye’ll swing.
Now, I must get back. Hide here till dark,
an’ then make y’r way towards Parramatta.
You’ll do it all right. I wish I was y’r
man, lass. Ye’d suit me.”
She smiled at him.
“Well, Tiger—so be if Tom’s daid, ye
mav be. I do hope he’s daid.”
“Where’s your prisoner, Corporal?”
asked Quarter-master Laycock, when at
length the Tiger rejoined the troops, march-
ing back to Parramatta with their prisoners.
“What did ye do with him?”
“I give him th’ bay’net, y’r honor,” said
Corporal Tiger unblushingly._
