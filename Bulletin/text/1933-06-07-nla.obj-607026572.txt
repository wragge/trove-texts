The Red Page
Anti-Semitism
A Sydney clergyman implied at a public
meeting recently that anti-Semitism was
only to be found in backward countries.
The truth is it flourishes even in tolerant
England. Yet Jews are the best of citizens
wherever they are given a chance to be.
England has many great charities which
are monuments to their generosity. One
explanation of the hatred which they inspire
in certain quarters may be jealousy. Noth-
ing exasperates like success, and Jews suc-
ceed in most directions, and particularly,
of course, in money-jnaking. There is an
instinctive disposition to keep such for-
midable competitors down, and the ten-
dency takes different forms with different
races. In one country Jews are murdered
and robbed, in another thrashed, gaoled
and robbed, in another merely insulted and
libelled. England and the U.S.A. arc
examples of countries in which anti-Semitic
propaganda, some of it camouflaged, much
of it outspoken, is constantly at work. In
novels and articles, on the stage and screen,
it is the Judas or Shylock Jew who is
shown; hardly ever the Christ-like Jew.
Jews themselves are often responsible. The
hero of “Jew Suss” was an impressive char-
acter, but he embodied many of the quali-
ties which commonplace Christians fear in
Jews. The “S. M. Herald” published an
article by an American the other day in
which an anonymous Jew was quoted on
the subject of Hollywood:—
When Hollywood was still in its infancy
I saw you Jews —my brothers-—creep forth
from the slums. What have you done with
this priceless heritage, the motion-picture?
I am a Jew, but I am ashamed of my kinship
with you Jews of Hollywood. You are
engaged in pandering to the worst instincts
of humanity.
So impressed was the “S. M. Herald” con-
tributor by this rubbish that he expressed
a hope that “Australia or some other major
country would absolutely outlaw all Ameri-
can films.” The utmost that can be said
of Hollywood is that it produces films
which, while as righteous as tracts, are
often as witless as old-time melodramas.
Similarly, though nobody has met, or known
anyone who has met, the wicked Hebrew
of romance, he is taken for granted by mil-
lions on the assumption that somebody
else had the bad luck to meet him.
A Monster
The attitude of a “S. M. Herald” re-
viewer towards Daphne du Maurier’s The
Progress of Julius (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.)
was characteristic.
There are times when the egomania and
greed of Julius seem to overstep the bounds
of probability.
Consider the career of this Jew, whose
actions only “seem to overstep the bounds
of probability” at times. Julius Levy was
born near Paris. “Something for nothing,
something for nothing,” the child muses
as he sells dead rats for 40 sous, apiece
during the siege of Paris. Later he catches
his mother in adultery, and looks on approv-
ingly while his father strangles, her. At
fifteen he is in Algiers stealing mules and
swindling his companions out of the pro-
ceeds. With the money he gets to London,
is employed by an old baker, soon owns
the business, and becomes rich. The girl
he is living with gets consumption. It
would take money to cure her, so he lets
her die.
He marries Rachel Dreyfus (her father is
ruined by the Boer War and shoots him-
self, having applied for help to Julius m
he continues to make money.
He is wearying of his dissolute life when
his daughter Gabriel comes home from a.
finishing school in Paris. His wife tells him
she has cancer.
“Cancer !” lie repeated. “How long d’you
suppose it's been going on ? Is it contagious ?”
She poisons herself—not because she has
cancer, but because “they [her husband and
daughter] were living their lives on another
plane; she was dead to them already,” He
sends for his, London doctor; the news is
given out that death was due to heart"'
failure, and he leaves on a yachting cruise
with Gabriel. The World War intervenes,
bevy’s Bully Beef, the Levy Army Boot
become known wherever British soldiers
fight. At the Armistice he is a baronet.
His private speculations in the markets 6f
the world had made him probably the
wealthiest man in England. The four years
that had passed bringing misery and horror
to most people had merely doubled his
success.
His punishment begins. It takes the form
of an insane jealousy of his daughter. His
agonies < are ana-
lysed with a kind
of ruthless zest.
“W a t c h him
suffer,” the novel-
ist seems to say,
“an and remember
that there can be no escape for him in this
world or the next.” The climax comes
when Gabriel tells him she has a lover.
(Incidentally, this is the only weak feature
of an admirably constructed story. He
would have known the moment she fell in
love.) He drowns her.
As he held her beneath the water her
frightened blue eyes flashed up at him in
a moment’s recognition. She looked like
his mother. He was thinking: “Pfere never
thought of a handkerchief, he must have
left his fingerprints on her throat.”
Of course, he gets away with it, and is
sympathised with by Society over her loss;
but his closing years are tragic. The bland
acceptance of such vile libels on the Hebrew
race by reputable newspapers must do much
to swell the tide of anti-Semitism in Eng-
land and the U.S.A., and it also plays into
the hands of critics of the capitalistic
system.
English Anti-Samitism
Those who imagine that Germany is the
only country where anti-Semitism exists
will be disillusioned by a study of Louis
Golding’s A Letter to Adolf Hitler
•(Hogarth Press; 2s.). Mr. Golding is one
of England’s most distinguished novelist-
critics. His Letter is not so much con-
cerned with Hitler as with the cosmopoli-
tan or instinctive anti-Semitism referred
to above. He uses one Hertha Grossman
as a symbol of what he calls “the pure
lust of Jew-hatred” (“She was serene in
her abomination as Ashtaroth, as precise
as a table of logarithms”) and he states
his case by reference to his own experiences.
He was brought up in Lancashire, and his
mother died there when he was fifteen.
The age of fifteen is perhaps of all ages
the one in which such a loss can least easily
be borne. It is not necessary, therefore, to
expatiate upon the condition of the forlorn
youth seated in the four-wheeler nearest to
the hearse.... Of a sudden three figures of
youths about his own age were substantiate
before his eyes on the rim of that loveless
field. They gesticulated, they leered, they
screamed.
“Smoggy van Jew! Sheeny! Sheeny!
Who killed Christ?”
They stuck their tongues out towards the
supine corpse as if there, in that gentle dust,
the criminal was at length apprehended.
At Oxford he encounters “a new type of
Antisemitics.” It was fashionable “to utter
scurrilities concerning Jews in general and
any Jew in particular who happened to be
at hand.” He makes the acquaintance of the
verb “to jew” (“sanctioned by the editors
of the 'Oxford Dictionary’”), meaning “to
.cheat.” His conclusion is that some
’bigotries are inborn. “Did a bristling mon-
ster,” he asks Hitler, “impend over vour
boyhood whose name was Semite as mine
was Antisemite?” Perhaps it did, and it
would no doubt impend over his manhood
if he allowed himself to be lured to, say,
Moscow. There are parts of Europe in
which Semites and anti-Semites will con-
tinue to persecute one another for genera-
tions. In British communities, however,
there are no militant Semites and there
should be no anti-Semites; meaning persons
who rage against Israel because they dis-
approve of the movies or have failed to
make money out of movies in competition
with Jews; or because they want sensa-
tional characters for novels; or just because
they must have somebody of another faith
to hate as a matter of Christian principle.
It is partly the fault of the Jews them-
selves that these menaces to the peace of
mind and dignity of members of their race
continue to flourish. If influential British
and American Jews took steps now to deal
with publications like The Progress of
Julius the lives of the Louis Goldings of
the future would be much happier.

Australian Critics
Rightly complaining that aesthetics is a
neglected science in Australia, “J.D.” (R.P,
J.7/5/-33). suggests that the remedy is to
hand art criticism over to experts. I am
sorry to disillusion “J.D.,” but the issue is
not so simple. He says that, while the
newspapers are careful to send cricketers to
report cricket matches, they send junior
reporters to report art shows. This may be
true of some Australian capitals: it is not
true of Melbourne. Mr. Streeton criticises
art for the “Argus,” Mr. Blamire Young for
the “Herald.” Mi-. George Bell for the
“Sun.” Mr. Harold Herbert for the “Aus-
tralasian” and Mr. A. Colquhoun for the
"“Age”; and all these gentlemen are
painters.
One might suppose, under this happy
state of affairs, that the public of Mel-

bourne would be better off than their fellow-
countrymen in cities where the art criticism
is done by junior reporters. When they go
to an art show they should know what to
look for; they should have an infallible
criterion—the judgment of all these learned
gentlemen. But no! Alas, no! All these
critics disagree with one another, just as
if they were so many junior reporters.
They not only differ as to the respective
merits of the various painters; they differ
as to the merits of the particular paintings
of particular painters. Thus one critic says
of a certain picture that “No. 6, 'Wisteria/
is a good subject well arranged, but the
brush strokes are so evident as painted
strokes that the illusion of nature is missed.”
Another says of the same work that
“in ‘Wisteria’ we see the artist beating in-
sistently on the chord of lilac and green,
and he beats hard enough to get all the
harmony out of it that it can give.” And
so on, ad infinitum. Moreover, these critics
differ, not only with regard to details, but
concerning the fundamental principles of
the art they adorn and about which they
are at such pains to instruct the public.
One believes that art should be Nature
unadulterated; another believes that it
should be adulterated with academic pre-
servative, to a degree not exceeding 2£ p.c.,
like tomato sauce; another believes that if
it is like Nature at all, then it isn’t art;
and so on. And even those who are in
agreement with the principle that art should
look like Nature, or more or less like
Nature, seldom agree as to whether a
specific picture is in accordance with this
principle. One will say that it looks exactly
like Nature; another will say that it doesn’t
look a bit like Nature, and that the
artist must have left his spectacles at home
when he went out to paint it. Most of
these critics are agreed, however, that art
should be harmonious, complete, rhythmic,
dynamic, refined, true, subtle, emotionally
satisfying, inspiring, spontaneous, pleasing,
spiritual, stimulating, masterly, in good
taste, well arranged, properly designed, cor-
rectly composed, and, above all, beautiful;
though, as they refrain for some reason from
defining the precise meaning of these terms,
the public isn’t a bit the wiser. However,
“J.D.” needn’t be despondent over this or
think that Australia is unlucky or even
unique in the quality of its art guidance.
It has been much the same in all ages.
When Constable’s pictures first made
their appearance in Paris it was a lay critic
who said, “What resemblance do you find
between these pictures and those of Pous-
sin, which we must always admire and take
as our models? Beware of this English-
man’s pictures; they will be the ruin of the
school. There is no beauty therein, nor
style nor tradition.” But it was the fears
of the academic painters he was voicing;
and he was quite right. Constable was the
ruin of the school, but he was also the
saviour of French landscape. It was a lay-
man who said of Corot that “his touch is
heavy and dull; the suppleness, the
humidity, the charm of Nature, he knows
nothing of.” But it was the Salon which
endorsed his judgment by treating the
greatest French landscape painter with
sullen indifference for fifteen years, stick-
ing his pictures in the darkest comers. It
was Diderot, a writer, who said of Chardin
that he was “ever a faithful imitator of
Nature in his own manner, which is rude and
abrupt—at Nature low, common and domes-
tic”; and it was only Sir Joshua Reynolds,
of the painters of his time, who did not
agree with him. Yet it was Sir Joshua
himself who wasted his time in Italy work-
ing out from a study of the Old Masters
his fatuous proposition that the proper for-
mula for a picture should be one-fourth
light and three-fourths darkness. It was
the painters of Florence who stigmatised
Titian, a Venetian, as a feeble draughts-
man, and Whistler wrote almost as much
nonsense as sense about the principles of
his profession. Ruskin was a Professor of
the Slade School and some sort of ai’tist,
but in the mountain of rubbish that he
wrote about painting there wei-e only a
few grains of sense, due to the fact that
he was a friend of Turner, who didn’t even
bother to read the books Ruskin wrote
about him.
In short, art criticism, whether of to-day
or yesterday, and whether it is written by
painters or reporters, is usually the expres-
sion of personal likes and dislikes. The
temple of Art will always be a Tower of
Babel.

Footnote to History
P.. S. Cleary’s Australia’s Debt to Irish
Nation-Builders (Angus and Robertson;
12s. 6d.) is, in a sense, an amplification of
Father Eris O’Brien’s classic “The Dawn of
Catholicism in Australia.” But Mr. Cleary
covers most of the period between the arri-
val of the First Fleet and the end of Mac-
quarie’s regime in his first chapter, and he
pays as much attention to Protestants as he
does to Catholics. There are only two
qualifications for a mention in his book—
something, achieved for the honor or profit
of Australia and Irish blood. He is editor
of the “Catholic Press,” and has the light,
cultivated style which distinguishes that jour-
nal. . Personalities interest him more than
political principles. There is an index of
over 1500 references, and most of them
relate to people. He has both wit and
humor, and they are racy of Ireland;
always restrained and literary in quality,
often with an acid undertone. It would be
easy to fill a page with his good stories,
old and new.
k- Curves, Madden’s great rival at the Bar,
possessed many rhetorical tricks. One was to imply
tnatthe Judge and he were on familiar terms. But
as ms practice was chiefly in criminal and common
lv, COU !?’ n °t often appear before Moles-
worth. On one unfortunate occasion he began, “Your
xionor, 1 have not had the privilege of frequent
contact with you, and I now feel like a helpless
orphan on a foreign shore.” “Put that down, Mr.
6 ’ t, remarked Molesworth to his associate,
shore >. Urves ee^s a helpless orphan on a foreign
He has no bigotries (many of his heroes
are Protestants like Wentworth and Higin-
botham), and his resentments are almost
entirely reserved for Irish natives, such as
James Martin, C.J., who, he considers, went
back on their race and faith. But for inex-
plicable omissions, the book would be of
great historical value. The A.I.F. is dis-
missed in a few lines; and none of the
front-line soldiers of Irish descent who did
so much for its fame is mentioned. There
is a reference to one T. H. Osborne
(a Presbyterian clergyman), but the Ulster
pastoralist family of that name whose
members have been making history as
woolgrowers in three States for nearly a
century are ignored. So are the members
of the Australian branch of the Lindsay
family, which has. been proliferating men
and women of high ability since it was
founded by ail Ulster doctor who married
a missionary’s daughter 60-odd years ago.
Nevertheless, Australia's Debt to Irish
Nation-Builders is enlightening as well as
delightfully easy to. read. If anything is
needed to make Irish-Australians prouder
of their origin than they already are this
book should do it.
J.D.
A Satchel of Books
,'j wo Minutes’ Silbnee, by Leslie Haylen
(Macquarie Head Press; 2s. 6d.). This is
a film version of the play of the same name
which was produced in Australia by the
McDonagh sisters. W. M. Hughes says of
it in a foreword: “It is vigorous with the
vigor of vital things. It lives.” And most
readers will agree. There are some excel-
lent reproductions of scenes from the
McDonagh' production.
Most novels that deal with man’s struggles
with the soil are sombre, and E. P. Grove’s
Fruits of the Earth (Dent; 7s. 6d.) is no
exception. The scene is Red River Valley,
Winnipeg. Abe Spalding battles against
droughts, floods and the rest and wins, only
to find that he has become estranged from
his family. Estranged, too, from his neigh-
bors. The betrayal of his daughter by a
married man brings him to his senses. He
doesn’t shoot the miscreant as he isi minded
to do at first; merely decides to take his
rightful place as head of the little com-
munity and drive such men as McCrae out.
The portraits of Abe and his distracted wife
arc drawn with power and understanding.
The Primary School Curriculum in Aus-
tralia (edited by Percival R. Cole and pub-
lished by the Melbourne University Press
at 10s.) is a noble work in its appearance
and in the comprehensiveness with which the
subject has been handled. Twelve of the
fourteen members of the committee on the
Primary School Curriculum have written or
collaborated in writing chapters on such sub-
jects as “The Theory of the Curriculum”
and “The Relation of the Curriculum to In-
dustrial and Social Needs,” and the editor
has supplied an enlightening introduction.
The Kennel Murder Case (Cassell; 7s. 6d.)
is strong on culture and weak in charac-
terisation, as in the case of most of S. S.
van Dine’s Philo Vance thrillers. Chinese
ceramics, early Marins, the principles of
Bernstein’s “Der Merkwiirdige Fall Konrad”
—these and many other subjects of the kind
are handled with impressive airiness. But
Mr. Vance—one of America’s many answers
to Sherlock Holmes —is as stupid and
schoolboyish in his speech as he is profound
as regards aesthetic matters. “I can’t go
in these togs,” he explains when they in-
vite him to view the corpse of Archer Coe;
•I’ll hop into appropriate integuments.” He
tries to be funny on such lines all through,
and thereby detracts from the interest o f
an exciting, though wildly improbable, yarn.
Allen and Unwin have published Carlyle,
by Emery Neff, at 10s. 6d. Mr. Neff covers
much of the ground that previous bio-
graphers have gone over, but he differs from
most of them, inasmuch as he has a judicial
mind. Carlyle’s irritating tricks of style,
his “catch phrases and comments repeated
to weariness,” his “Teutonic supercilious-
ness,” and his personal prejudices—particu-
larly his Calvinistic bias against Roman
Catholicism—are stressed. Nevertheless this
biographer is a worshipper, like almost every
other investigator of Carlyle’s tremendous
career. Carlyle typifies Victorianism, yet in
an age when most Victorian ideals are being
either derided or damned, his writings and
personality continue to fascinate thousands.
Mr. Neff’s “life” is the fifth that the Red
Page has reviewed in as many years.
George Cromw r ell, hero of Richard
Church’s latest novel The Prodigal Father
(Dent; 7s. 6d.), is almost as exasperating
to read about as lie would be to meet. The
most kickable kind of Beloved Vagabond.
Mary, whom he loves, is worthy of him.
While he is away, and she is hungering for
a letter, his son Rob, who loves her, calls.
He kisses her passionately, and she responds.
Eventually lie is so upset that he falls un-
conscious to the floor. He comes to and
finds his head on her lap. “You can’t go
back to-night, Rob. It’s eleven o’clock
already.” So she undresses him, and brings
him hot brandy and milk, and sits on the
bed watching him while he sips it, and
longs to take him in her arms like a sick
child. In short, they are movie characters
and the situations are movie situations. It
is one of those books in which the reader
finds himself instinctively turning to Holly-
wood for suitable people to cast for the
leading parts.

OUR “LEGALISTIC” SYSTEM.
Senator Hardy is out of favor with the
lions who I’oar in the Sydney headquarters
of the U.A.P. A bereavement kept him out
of the referendum campaign until it was
nearly over; when the result was known he
pointed out in his forthright fashion that
the Langsters would have won but for the
splendid country vote for reform, adding
that the city had “let us down, as usual.”
The U.A.P. secretary angrily replied that
Hardy had been “conspicuous by his
absence from the field”—it may be charit-
ably supposed that the gentleman spoke in
ignorance of the reason—and had then
“entered the lists with a statement which in
its qualifications and implications was but,
faint praise for the reform proposals,” being
forced into that declaration, such as it was,
by local enthusiasm for Premier Stevens.
Ex-Mayor Walder, who is one of the
Stevens M’s.L.C., took up the cudgels for
his patron: “Mr. Stevens’s part in the cam-
paign was colossal. He found it necessary
to go to Wagga to counteract the atmo-
sphere that was created by the Riverina
movement, of which Senator Hardy is the
leader.”
Mr. Stevens might have spared him-
self the trouble. Except in Bligh-street,
Sydney, there was never any doubt
about Wagga. It is one of 23 Assembly
electorates with straightout Country-party
members: with the solitary exception of
Cootamundra, where the Noes led by 240
votes in a poll of 12,644, they all declared
for reform, most of them by four-figure
majorities; with 12,081 electors voting,
Wagga’s was 2505. In the metropolis, on
the other hand, an alarming number of
electorates, eight with U.A.P. members,
sided with Mr. Lang. In U.A.P. Canter-
bury the No majority was 2956; in U.A.P.
Granville it was 2830; in Arncliffe it was
2365; in Kogarah, 1753 ; in Hqrstville, 1157;
in Petersham, 1142; in Concord, 713; in
Randwick, 580. Nobody questions the
Premier’s energy as a campaigned, but
results might have been more satisfactory
if he had left country electorates to the
Country party, and concentrated on Sydney,
where he has lived all his life.
Senator Hardy is perhaps too fond of
giving allies—if allies they are—licks with
the rough side of his tongue, but he sees
clearly essential things to which Bligh-street
is blind, and he looks much further ahead.
While these U.A.P. worthies are saying
that “the menace of Langism has been re-
moved” and the question of constitutional
reform decided by the result of the refer-
endum, and that the people of the Riverina
and northern N. S. Wales trust Stevens so
much that they don’t want new States any
more, Hardy declares that, though the
U.A.P. may be satisfied, the Riverina is
not.
We are not conscious of loyalty to the
State of which we happen to be a part. We
ore conscious only of loyalty to the nation,
and we shall continue to fight for true
national security. It is impossible to believe
that the reformed Upper House, this new
guardian of the people, will prove a hundred
per cent, efficient. Riverina demands the
right to govern itself. It advocates the
creation of new self-governing units from
predominantly rural areas, and redistribu-
tion of the powers of the State and Common-
wealth Parliaments. This will strike at the
root of small-State disabilities, of which no
attempt has been made to remove the cause,
and will rebalance the scales.
There is true political wisdom in that
utterance. Seeing that nearly 700,000 N. S.
Wales electors voted as Mr. Lang told them
to do, it is foolish and dangerous to con-
clude that “the menace of Langism has
been removed.” Blocked by the new Leg.
Council, if blocked they are, the Langsters
will transfer the fight to the larger battle-
ground of the Commonwealth Parliament.
There vaster spoils are to be won, and in
their plans for seizing and redistributing the
wealth of the nation by “nationalising” the
banks and “socialising” credit, they will
have the help of the Scullin group. It is
the programme of both factions, and even
Labor faction fights end (or are sus-
pended) some time. And if a Labor-
ridden Commonwealth Parliament passed
a measure placing the Government in con-
trol of the banks, their capital and de-
posits, and another taking 10 per cent, of
all the money out on mortgage, as Mr. Lang
tried to do within the boundaries of N. S.
Wales while exempting the kind of mort-
gage he had on the “Labor Daily,” Mr.
Stevens’s Upper House would be as power-
less to help the victims as the Danzig Diet.
Our sadly defective and out-of-date Com-
monwealth Constitution makes the estab-
lishment of new States difficult, and is not
even definite as to the procedure to be
adopted. Still, it does say, in sections 121
and 124, that “the Parliament may admit
to the Commonwealth or establish new
States,” and that “a new State may be
formed by separation of territory from a
State, but only with the consent of the
Parliament thereof.” In common justice to
the country people, who sent Lang about
his business, and, as many believe, saved
Australia from civil war, and whose vote
has now consigned the nominee Leg. Coun-
cil to limbo, that consent should be un-
grudgingly given by the Stevens Govern-
ment to dissatisfied parts of N. S. Wales
with sufficient population. Another section
(123) says: “The Parliament of the Com-
monwealth may, with the consent of the
Parliament of a State, and the appmval of
the majority of the electors of the State
voting upon the question, increase, diminish
or otherwise alter the limits of the State,
upon such terms and conditions as may be
agreed upon.” Does this mean that the
sanction of a majority of the electors of
N. S. Wales must be obtained before new
States can be formed out of N. S. Wales?
Quick and Garran are of opinion that it
does not; “it can hardly be contended that
section 123 operates as a restriction of or
condition on the exercise of the independent
powers conferred by section 111” (“The
Parliament of a State may surrender any
part of a State to the Commonwealth”)
“or by sections 121 and 124.” But will not
the granting of local self-government to
the Riverina and New England leave the
remaining parts of N. S. Wales at the
mercy of Inner Groups and the like at
Sydney Trades Hall? It need not, and it
will not if the creation of new States is
accompanied by measures designed to place
the Commonwealth in a position to protect
all its citizens against spoliation and to
effect a separation between Commonwealth
powers and taxes and State powers . and
taxes, once and for all. The strengthening
of the Senate by the addition of 12 or
more Senators from inland Australia will
be a safeguard in itself. With its great
block vote in the cities, the Labor party
very nearly captured that Chamber out-
right at the double dissolution in 1914.
In effect, our “legalistic system,” as
Attorney-General Latham calls it, is work-
ing badly, and is in danger of drifting to
a stage where it will not work at all. Who
wants a “legalistic system” anyway, except
lawyers and the like? The form of mis-
government so described has been a great
thing for barristers and solicitors, profes-
sional politicians, trade-union secretaries
and industrial-arbitration advocates, but it
has degenerated into a chaos of clashing
authorities, duplicated departments and
double taxes; and inefficiency has been
bought at a monstrous price. Partly be-
cause of constitutional limitations the cen-
tral Government has shown dangerous
weakness in national emergencies, and it
takes far too much from the people for the
functions it performs. The three small
States have chronic deficits, and two at
least, South Aus. and W T estralia, can see
no prospect of ever becoming solvent unless
the Commonwealth takes over their schools
or their ‘railways. Last year the Govern-
ment of the most populous State defaulted
to the Commonwealth and the Common-
wealth Bank and tried to wreck the
national finances by means of confiscatory
taxes, at the same time resisting an adverse
High Court judgment—and nearly got away
with it. Two months ago the people of
the State with the biggest area voted nearly
two to one for secession. It is doubtful
whether these Westralians, a handful of
fanatics excepted, really want to break
away from their countrymen. Like most
other Australians, they would probably
accept closer union in national matters, pro-
vided they were offered a greater measure
of self-government in local matters. To
that, great task the U.A.P. and the Coun-
try party should devote themselves, even
if the Labor party will not help. And
surely they can co-operate in it without
quarrelling.
THE JURY SYSTEM.
At Brisbane last week Justice Macrossan
discharged 12 jurymen from further attend-
ance at the criminal sittings of the Supreme
Court, and suggested that their names
should be excluded from future jury lists.
The 12 had acquitted a motor-driver, who,
according to positive evidence, unlaw-
fully wounded an acquaintance and threat-
ened to shoot two men who followed
him. The same Judge had previously
heard a case at Roma in which a man was
charged with unlawfully shooting a cow.
When the jury returned a verdict of not
guilty, his Honor said; —
Gentlemen, that is your verdict, not mine.
Apparently any tale will do in Roma.
This kind of thing has been going on for
years in all the States, and a hopelessly
tolerant stage has arrive,d when few but
Judges get restive about it. The venerable
palladium of British justice has come to
be widely regarded as a palladium of
crooks.
In the majority of cases, no doubt, the
juror who votes for acquittal in spite of the
evidence gets nothing out of it. He sur-
renders to a false sympathy for the man in
the dock. But jury-squaring is an old game,
and the technique has vastly improved since
the Bribery Prevention League was founded
at London in 1907. An Australian State,
Victoria, was actually the first part of the'
Empire to pass a Prevention of Corruption
Act; it became law in 1905 while the exist-
ing British Act was being debated in the
House of Commons. Yet jmy-squaring,
with all its consequences, has been rife in
Victoria from that day to this. Things got
so bad there a few years ago, disagree-
ments became so numerous and outrageous,
that it was proposed to introduce a bill pro-
viding for majority verdicts in criminal
cases. About the same time the N. S. Wales
Justices’ Association described the jury
system as “a travesty on the administration
of justice,” and suggested that it should be
abolished and replaced in criminal as well
as civil suits by trial by three Judges.
Since then conditions have changed for the
worse.
The improvement of the car-engine has
led to a prodigious increase in the number
of dangerous drivers. A bad or reckless or
partially or wholly sozzled driver tears by
night through a rainstorm, or along an ill-
lighted road, at 40 or 50 m.p.h. and kills
somebody. In law it is manslaughter if not
murder; under the jury system it is nearly
always a case for an acquittal. The accused
may not even have to requisition the ser-
vices of a jury-squarer. It is highly prob-
able that he will be tried by men whose
instinctive sympathies are with him and
against his victim. They find themselves
unable to look on a man as a criminal
who has had the bad luck to make a mis-
take which they themselves may make in
the future, and are perhaps lucky not to
have made in the past. The effect is to
keep bad or careless drivers out of gaol
and on the road, and the relatives of old,
deaf, short-sighted or crippled persons, and
above all of small children, in a constant
state of anxiety.
Another social change which the jury
system is failing to cope with is the recent
spread of half-baked political and economic
ideas which have deposed the ethical values
preached by the various Churches and put
nothing in their place. The talk is all of
plans for repudiating just debts, the national-
isation of trading banks (i.e., pinching
them in the name of the nation), and the
socialisation, or seizure, of any other kind of
property that appears worth seizing. The
capitalist being represented from a thousand
lorries and soap-boxes as a robber whom the
State would do well to strip of his illegally-
gained possessions, there is a natural ten-
dency to strip him on private-enterprise
lines. The strippers are generally normal
persons who might never figure in a court,
whether as attempted homicides, highway
robbers, car-thieves, petty larcenists or what
not, were they not satisfied that the chances
of finding sympathetic juries were vastly in
their favor.
There are many objections to majority
verdicts in criminal trials. The late Jus-
tice Cussen put a fatal one in three words :
If unanimity is not the rule, not merely
will there arise in the minds of the public
uncertainty and distrust of the law and its
administration, and of the accuracy and pro-
priety of a verdict of either acquittal or con-
viction, but what of the men who form the
jury? Is each one to be allowed to say what
his judgment was, and to state his reasons for
it. or must all stand mute and he regarded
as assenting to a verdict with which in
the juryroom they expressed vehement dis-
agreement?
The replacement of juries in criminal
cases by three Judges whose verdict would
need to be unanimous before a conviction
was registered would have none of the dis-
advantages mentioned by Justice Cussen.
An acquittal would be a real acquittal,
a testimonial to the complete blamelessness
of the accused, which acquittals in trials by
jury have long since ceased to be in this
country. Conversely, on a conviction the
public would have the salutary experience
of hearing how and why the trial Judges
arrived at their conclusions. The system
would admittedly be a bad one for the
guilty—it is likely, indeed, that, until the
full implications of the change had pene-
trated into the consciousness of the under-
world. the gaols would be overtaxed—but
it would be a boon to law-abiding folk, and
it would give the local Criminal Courts
a prestige in the eyes of the public which
they have not known for nearly 20 years.
It might well be tried in a few motor-car
manslaughter cases, for a start.
O! GRAVE NEW WORLD.
From a material standpoint, the depression
is probably the best thing that has ever
happened to civilisation. Actually, it will
bring real civilisation into being and lead to
the world casting overboard all the fake and
synthetic civilisation which for years it has
accepted as the genuine article.
It will do this by teaching humanity that
economics is nothing more than simple
arithmetic, and that if two and two do
make four it is a matter of comparative
ease to make everybody well-to-do. The
production of our present civilisation is
quite equal to supplying civilisation with
all its wants; the future production of a
regularised civilisation working steadfastly
towards the goal of efficiency should
put all of us then living in the class now
regarded as being on the fringe of the Idle
Rich. A much graver problem than making
everybody rich is making everybody good
—or just plain, decently-living citizens.
One of the New Economists has put for-
ward a scheme whereby he claims to be
able to multiply the earnings of everybody
by eight. Recently, I asked him what lie
intended to do about the boys and girls of
18 to 20 who are now receiving £2 a week
in offices, shops and factories. Was he
going to hand each of them £l6 on Saturday
mornings and tell them to be good and
come to work as usual on Monday ? That
New Economist looked solemn and didn t-
reply. I suggested that there would prob-
ably be a long row of wrecked cars along
the road to Sorrento, a morgue filled to
overflowing, hospitals working overtime to
catch up with the casualties and, for the
boys and girls who escaped damage,
moral damage of a more or less serious
nature. “I admit there would have to be
some regulation regarding the younger
people,” he replied.
But that menace was merely a menace
of too much money. Under the scheme
propounded by this economist, the youths
of both sexes would still be working their
eight or seven hours a day. And the demon
of idleness is a much more malignant demon
than the demon of money.
But let there be an alliance of the demon
of money and the demon of idleness and
you would have a combination against
which all but the very strongest characters
would be powerless. Possibly this is a pro-
vision of Nature to perpetuate the survival
of the fittest. Be that as it may, the possi-
bilities of comfort for all in the near future
carry with them the germs of a world
tragedy beside which the late war would
be a clean and innocent affair.
Neither this New Economist of mine nor
any of the other new economists who have
put forward schemes of financial regenera-
tion suggests that anything but good can
result. Some, indeed, Max eloquent over
the amount of leisure which will be avail-
able to humanity and anticipate that
humanity will rush to utilise it in attending
profound lectures on helpful subjects and
generally improving itself Till it reaches a
godlike level. I don’t regard humanity as
vicious, but I would hate to underwrite any
helpful lecturee on uplifting subjects while
there were tin hares about.
Lord Beaverbrook has estimated that, with
two hours’ work daily, England could main-
tain its present standard of living. That
isn’t much to crow about; but, if the new
Englishman were to work four hours daily,
he would double his present standard and
make himself very comfortable.
But the matter wouldn’t end there. The
continuous and certain demand for all
commodities would enable their cheaper
production and distribution, it would lead
to inventions now unpayable being brought
out of cold storage and pressed into the
work of production, it would so accelerate
the velocity of exchange that only three
hours’ work would shortly be required to
keep up the new standard of living.
Of course, it would be possible to have
six hours’ daily work and let everybody
live like fighting cocks. But in another
20 years inventions and the introduction
of new methods and the development oi
higher efficiency would find them living like
fighting cocks on a three-hour day.
There is, of course, a huge building
scheme to be put into operation in every
city in the world. Notone houses its people
in accordance with modern ideas of hygiene
and sanitation. One-third to one-halt
of Melbourne needs to be down
and rebuilt before it can boast. Sydney
requires three-quarters to be demolished,
London about ninety-nine hundredths, Paris
and New York about the same.
The work of rebuilding the cities will
occupy, say, 10 years. Then the controllers
will have to find some other way of using
up the labor. Beautification schemes, long
dreams of the artistic, may be entered upon.
We shall be able to realise the vision ot
the late E. W. O’Sullivan, who projected
a three-chain concrete road from Sydney
to the Gulf of Carpentaria, flanked by
flowering gums and parterres of rare blooms
and dotted with “statues of the illustrious
dead.” We can materialise the ideal of
the late Henry Parkes and erect a mighty
statue of Australia Facing the Dawn on
Pinchgut. We can have super-theatres and
super-restaurants and super-talkie houses
subsidised by the State.
But there must be an end to our magnifi-
cence. When we have made the late
Augustus of Rome look like a competitor
in a novice tournament we will wake up to
find that there is no more beautification to
be carried out and that, with the whole
population rich and well fed in healthy and
beautiful surroundings, it is only necessary
for them to toil for an hour or two each
day. How they will put in their time
during the other 22 or 23 hours will be the
facer for the politicians of the period.
Possibly the dangers may be minimised
by the granting of holidays so long that
the workers may spend them overseas.
This, in itself, will absorb a number in tin'
shipping and shipbuilding industries unheard
of in the old days. But six months hob-
day in every year would only bring about
a four-hour day for the worker during the
other six months. The gravest problem oi
that Grave New World to come is how
humanity is to be prevented from going to
the dogs during that free afternoon when
it is not sitting in the lecture-room at the
uplift classes. - *

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Still a Long Way to Go.
The prompt filling of two Australian
loans, each carrying less than 4 p.c. in the
country of flotation, is encouraging to those
who have stuck out for honoring our debts
and balancing the Budget. But there are
no grounds for whooping yet, or for “speak-
ing more firmly to the overseas bondholder,”
as Senator Barnes suggests. If Mr. Bruce
can continue the good work in London the
remaining £73,000,000 of expensive optional
loans may be converted to or p.c.’s.
On the £11,400,000 of 6i p.c.’s converted into
3} p.c.’s last week there will be a saving of
£396,000 p.a. in interest; on the £32,000.000
of 6 p.c.’s, £15,500,000 of s£/5$ p.c.’s and
£25,000,000 of 5 p.c.’s the benefit would not
be proportionately so great, but still would
total about £1,500,000 annually in Austra-
lian money.
The situation requires delicate handling.
Early improvement in our overseas trade
figures was taken as a signal for pulling
down tariffs, and the subsequent flood of
customs revenue was regarded by the Com-
monwealth Government with satisfaction
rather than apprehension. As a result we
are cutting very fine the means wherewith
to pay our overseas interest, and any short-
age will mean further borrowing, temporary
or fixed, overseas. We have still a long
way to go. The easing in the price we have
to pay overseas for accommodation should
not fill anybody with ideas of further new
loan programmes. Taking exchange into
account it is still not cheap money. The
£5,000,000 raised locally at 3f p.c. is being
used for public works, and the Government
will have to go easy on that market, too.

The Rulli Barney.
The Inner Group’s nominee, Sweeney, has
won the Bulli (N.S.W.) seat. Apart from
being championed by Lang and supplied
with Inner Group cars and canvassers re-
gardless of expense, he had certain advan-
tages over Willis, whom in the scramble for
the Labor vote he beat by nearly 2 to 1.
He was born in the district, has lived there
all his life and has a name for being a
benevolent old party. 'ln the political
geography of the coalmining belt, he is a
southerner and Willis is a northerner. That
gentleman, moreover, is associated in the
minds of the southern miners with levies
dragged from them for the support of New-
castle-Maitland strikes which cost a king’s
ransom, and with the subsidies their Federa-
tion has lavished on the “Labor Daily”; and
his excursions into the financial history of
that journal did him more harm than good
with them. There is a fair proportion of
Welshmen among the South Coast miners,
and evidently they supported their fellow-
Cambrian. The railwaymen’s vote, which is
considerable, went to Sweeney.
It was a sordid family quarrel, and But-
terell, the U.A.P. man, who got a trifle
more than half the total which Sydney
optimists had awarded him, did not make
it smell any sweeter by suggesting that if
Bulli obliged the Government by electing
him it might expect favors which it
wouldn’t get if it chose Sweeney or Willis.
But the miners were too intent on watching
the struggle and listening to the angry
cries of the combatants inside the ring to
pay any attention to Butterell spouting his
U.A.P. politics outside. How many thou-
sands of his own money did Willis put
into the “Labor Daily”? How many did
Lang? Did Willis draw £lOOO a year as
managing director, or did he take less? Did
he demand the return of the job and the
£lOOO a year when he came back from
London? Did Lang then offer him a more
lucrative post which his sensitive soul for-
bade him to accept? What sort of billet
was it?—something to do with fruit
or tin hares? And what was the
extent of Lang’s interest in the “Labor
Daily,” £13,000 or £14,000? Was it secured
or unsecured? Did he draw a steady 5 per
cent, on it, as Lowden of the Southern
Miners said, while the miners got nothing,
or did he let the interest pile up? And why
was the rate fixed at 5 per cent, when his
maximum rate for capitalists is 3 per cent?
With such questions and speculations vexing
their minds, the miners looked on while
the two old friends, now bitter enemies,
fought it out. “Coward!” shouted the one;
“Traitor!” the other. On the highest posts
above the battle sat the Labor members for
all the other coal-mining electorates, State
and Commonwealth. The Inner Group had
asked them to speak for Sweeney. The
Miners’ Federation had hissed that if they
did they would be opposed by “industrial”
candidates next time they stood. So these
judicious, these reflective politicians “de-
cided to remain neutral,” and this they did
until neutrality itself became dangerous.
Neutrals are not tolerated by Big Chief
Jack.
For it was Lang’s tomahawk that got
home. He struck down Willis as he struck
down Mutch. The scalp of another rival
who was his close companion till recently
hangs from his belt. But what sort of
Labor leaders are these, who vulgarly charge
one another with being well-to-do, greedy
and ungrateful, and with whom old friend-
ship and the memory of battles fought to-
gether count fox; nothing when each thinks
the other stands in his way? What sort
of a party is it that tolerates such leaders
and dutifully follows the winner after each
of these disgraceful brawls? If good temper
is a necessary ingredient of good govern-
ment, as the wise Jew said, how can N. S.
Wales ever get good government from
Lang? “The revolution is here,” he said,
in perhaps the most foolish of his speeches.
He should have added, as Vergniaud did,
that it is devouring its children.

Dictators and Dirt.
Dear Bulletin, —Mussolini’s admirer (B.
24/5/’33) takes exception to my reference
to dead. cats and dogs in the Arno, averring
that this must have been the sight of a
bygone day. It is just a little over three
years since I was in Florence. A young
Australian with me, bending over Dante’s
bridge, wanted to plunge headlong in the
tide, but I said that if she mixed up with
those carcases she might seek another hotel
from mine. I can well believe that the
great leader is doing his best to clean up
Italy. I particularly approved the injunc-
tions not to spit, not to swear, not to enter
churches immodestly clad, that were posted
up everywhere, even at the Lido, where
one is apt to think that immoralists are a
law unto themselves—but, believe me, there
is still a lot to be done. The dust of
poetic Fresole must be seen to be believed,
and of the smells in the grand archway
at Naples the less said the better.
However, the point of my little “travel
note” was lost on my critic. I did not
set out to depreciate Italy, - a country I
adore. I will easily endure the unattacked
dust and the decaying domestic pets for
the sake of the Pitti, the Uffizi, the Duomo
and the Della Robbias at Florence, the
slums at the back of Como and Bellagio
for the glorious beauty of the Lake, even
the smells of Naples for Pompeii, Posillipo,
Baige and the Aquarium. I would endure
all but the fever at Rome for St. Peter’s
and the Sistine Chapel, and practically any
ill for a week in Venice—that being the
only place in the world where I can manage
to shut my eyes to fruit and vegetable
refuse being cast unregarded into lovely
tracts of water. My object in writing the
little sketch on Berlin was to point out
that its excessive cleanliness, a delight to
my soul, was marred by its stupid mentality
in regard to such of its citizens as hap-
pened to be Jews.
I recognise, too, that a resident of Sydney
writes with diffidence of beauty and cleanli-
ness. Leaving back streets and slums out of
the question, may the Lord preserve travel-
lers with a standard who have come here to
admire from walking through certain of our
parks, whose names I won’t give for fear of
the resultant apoplexy among aldermen.—
Yours etc., Ada A. Holman.

Japan Underselling the World.
In evidence before the Arbitration Court in
Melbourne the secretary of the Yarra Falls
textile works stated that Japanese cotton
material was being sold over the counter
in Melbourne for lOid. a yard. A material
not unlike it, “though of definitely better
quality,” produced by his firm was sold for
9s. lid. “Even if you paid no wages at all
you couldn’t compete,” commented Judge
Beeby.
This astounding disparity is explained by
Europeans who have been visiting Japan.
They assert that Nippon is riddled through
and through with Communistic doctrines,
and that for three or four years the Gov-
ernment has been doing its utmost to stamp
these out by Mussolinistic methods. The
spread of Bolsh ideals is not surprising,
seeing the proximity of Siberia and the con-
ditions under which the Japanese toil in
their factories.
Most of the factory work is done by
women and children—small children at that.
There are 12-hour shifts, and the machines
never stop, except for oiling and repairs.
Under the industrial system which prevails
the workers are fed and housed by the em-
ployer, and there is only one set of beds.
When the day shift goes off duty it turns
into the beds just vacated by the night
shift.
Further, one of the things that Japan
learned from Europe is that the best way
to handle a revolutionary movement is to
create a diversion by. means of a foreign
war. But wars cost money, and Japan re-
membered that, in the last war with Russia,
it finished with a fine array of victories,
but not one yen to rap on a tombstone —
so stone-broke that, had Russia known, it
might have won by finance the war which
it lost by fighting. So Japan is taking no
chances this time. It depressed the yen
to finance the hostilities, and the depres-
sion of the yen is enabling it to sell
9s. lid. material for 10£d.
Even England, its old ally, is kicking.
“Japan.” a Federation of British Industries
report says, “is using every means in its
power to undersell its competitors, with
disastrous results to British and other
traders.” The President of the Board of
Trade has suggested to the Japanese ambas-
sador a conference “with a view to a
mutual allocation of markets.” Meantime
Japan is to be deprived of most-favored-
nation treatment in India and West Africa.

Oiling a Rusty Gun.
The N.S.W. zealots bent on blowing the
public-house out of existence have had shots
at it under two different systems, local-option
and State-wide prohibition, and missed with
both barrels. They are now putting out
feelers to discover if the Stevens Govern-
ment will allow them to load the local-
option gun once more.
N. S. Wales had its first local-option poll
in 1907. The voter was asked (1) whether
he was in favor of leaving all the pubs at
the old address, (2) whether the number in
his particular electorate should be reduced,
and (3) whether he favored no-license
in his district. Of course, the liquor issue
got mixed up with the general politics
of the election, which was held on the same
day as the local-option poll. So much was
this the case that the no-license party
ordered its army to vote only for those can-
didates who supported the new Liquor Act.
As a result, reduction was carried in 64
of the 90 electorates, continuance in 25;
in no instance was no-license carried. The
25 were, of course, in the most congested
and worst-conducted strongholds of John
Barleycorn. As in M.L., local-option
became a farce, something like the closing
of bars in a Sydney electorate when there
is a by-election on—one side of the street
is beerless, on the opposite side there are
queues outside the taverns. In the city of
Sydney the delicensing of pubs in 1907
under local-option was given effect to no-
where, and that would doubtless be the
result again if the scheme were allowed an-
other run. Even where reduction was car-
ried in suburban areas practically no real
value could be attached to'it.
This was shown time after time in M.L.
In a two-year test period in the town of
Invercargill 70 prohibition orders were
issued against drunkards in that no-license
district. Mac and Toflald, it seemed, voted
no-license on their local-option ticket be-
cause they couldn’t get enough whusky the
old way. Under local-option the anti-
liquor section, after years of organisation
and strenuous campaigns to raise funds, had
nothing to show but a growing figure majo-
rity on the voting tally and a long list
of nailed-up bars without any reliable list
of diminished grog. The leader of the
Auckland Temperance Crusaders said: "I
know that success under local-option, where
no-license is carried, prevents the sale of
liquor by the pint, but it does not prevent
the sale or purchase of it by the gallon, or
the hogshead or the shipload. In no-license
areas the consumption of liquor is not
prevented, and is, I think, scarcely dim-
inished.”
The Victorian system has given far and
away the best results. There a highly com-
petent board reduces the number of licenses
where it is satisfied they are excessive, and
has labored, with gratifying success, to
improve the general standard of Victorian
hotels. If the N.S.W. Government has a
notion of tinkering with the Liquor Act
again it had better communicate with Mel-
bourne and seek the advice of the able Barr.

Now It’s Dawson Valley.
The story of Government land-settlement
schemes has been an unfortunate one, and
the most recent examples are the worst.
Westralians don’t like to think how many
millions were thrown away on the south-west
group settlements, nor are their State poli-
ticians fond of referring to the subject, since
the Commonwealth Octopus cannot be
blamed. Now Queenslanders have been told
the cold truth, or portion of it, about the
Dawson Valley irrigation-settlement scheme
which was launched in a spirit of flamboy-
ant optimism about the same time.
“The Valley of Content” the Dawson
Valley was called by the Labor politicians
who set the thing going in 1920, and talked
boisterously about converting it into a
small-farm paradise. It lies roughly north
and south on the southern edge of Central
Queensland, and through it runs the Dawson
River, a considerable stream for inland
Queensland, to join the Fitzroy above
Rockhampton. A dam, “the second-largest
in the world,” was to hold back 2|- million
acre-feet of water with an area of 130
square miles, and from it the valley was to
be irrigated. The project provided for
5000 farms, which were to maintain 50,000
inhabitants. In 1927 an area of 3500 acres
was surveyed and thrown open to settlers.
It was divided into 264 irrigable farms,
averaging 13 acres, and 109 “dry” blocks,
averaging 211 acres.
The scheme was a failure from the start.
Conditions became so bad that the State
Land Administration Board was asked to
collect the dismal facts and make recom-
mendations, with the status of a Royal
Commission. It has presented a report
which is a devastating condemnation of
the whole affair. It found that, after six
years of settlement, during which com-
plaints of conditions and of the Administra-
tion were continuous, there were only 124
settlers out of the expected 5000, 111 of
these being huddled in the Theodore area,
named after the man responsible for it.
The State’s outlay on each of these settlers
amounts to £8492, total costs since the in-
ception of the scheme being £1,053,057.
The settlement on June 30, 1932, owed the
State £611,811, plus £92.687 unpaid interest.
A branch railway to Theodore from the
main line involved a capital cost of
£404,436. The Moore Government’s legisla-
tion reducing the capital of the State rail-
ways by 43.048 p.c. brought this down to
£230.244, but the people from whom the
money was borrowed will have to be re-
paid the full amount.
The scheme, the commission says, is 50
years before its time; and in formulating
it elementary economics were not observed.
“With sublime optimism and self-confi-
dence, the then Commissioner of Irrigation
made estimates of settlement which had no
possibility of being realised.” Moreover,
“knowledge of other Government depart-
ments that was available remained neglected
and unused.” In 1926, when over £BOO,OOO
had been spent, the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment was asked for a loan of £3,370,000
under the Development and Migration'plan.
After investigation, £lOO,OOO was offered;
it was refused. The commission aldo
finds that progress has been greatly ham-
pered by the refusal of the tiny handful of
settlers to co-operate among themselves or
with the Administration. They are broken
up into cliques and separate
each hostile to the other, the general atmo-
sphere of the settlement being one of
rabid ill-feeling.
The financial recommendations are
drastic. Capital expenditure must be
written off. The State will have to find
some £2OOO a year in continuing working
costs as well as to carry the loss on the
railway. Work on the ambitious Nathan
dam (as it was called, after the State
Governor of the day) must be postponed for
at least 25 years. Other recommendations
for making the best of a bad job include
the granting of larger areas to settlers and
an increase of those already acquired. Re-
duction of rents is also essential.
“The most expensive settlement project
in Queensland’s history,” is the commis-
sion’s summing up. The Forgan Srhith
Government is considering another gran-
diose enterprise of the kind in North
Queensland. It had better wait awhile and
devote the interval to reflection on the hor-
rible example of the Dawson Valley fantasy.

The Amended N.S.W. Constitution.
Dear Bulletin, —I notice that The Bulle-
tin, in common with almost the whole of
the N.S.W. press, contends that the
amended Constitution of the Leg. Council
ensures that a bill rejected by the Council
and insisted upon by the Assembly will
ultimately be submitted to a referendum
of the electors. If this were a fact I should
have been among its supporters, but it is
not a fact. [The Bulletin said: “When-
ever there is disagreement between the two
Houses, the matter can be settled by refer-
ence to the people,” and will let it go
at that.] The framers of the bill have,
inadvertently or otherwise, provided a
simple procedure by means of which the
Council can, whenever it chooses, short-
circuit an objectionable bill—say one for
its own abolition—and prevent it ever reach-
ing the referendum stage. The different
stages through which a measure must pass
constitute a chain of which each link is de-
pendent on the one preceding. One of these
steps is a conference between the Chambers,
the next a joint sitting, the final one a
resolution of the Assembly authorising the
taking of a referendum.
Section 5b (1) is very definite in its
wording
If, after a free conference between the
managers,, there is not agreement between the
Leg. Council and the Leg. Assembly, the
Governor may convene a joint sitting.
Clearly this means that the joint sitting
can be convened only after a free confer-
ence. Consequently, if there is no confer-
ence, there can be no joint sitting. Sub-
section 2 of the same section provides that
only after a joint sitting can the Assembly
order a referendum; ergo, no conference, no
referendum. The framers of the bill must
be fully aware that no machinery exists,
either in the old or the new Constitution,
to compel the members of the Council to
give an affirmative vote on a motion to
constitute a conference; in fact, no mach-
inery could be devised to compel the mem-
bers of any deliberative body to vote in
any particular direction on a motion sub-
mitted for their consideration. It follows
that to kill any bill which the Council
does not desire to have submitted to a vote
of the electors, all that will be necessary-
will be to negative a motion to constitute
a free conference with the Assembly.
I pointed all this out in a letter to the
“Sun” (the “Herald” would not publish it),
and the Attorney-General replied that “there
is no substance in Mr. Griffith’s point.”
That is the sort of reply which a Domain
orator gives to any question he is unable
to answer, but not what one might expect
from a K.C. holding the position of legal
adviser to the Government. It was a retort
quite safe to make, in view of the fact
that not one in ten thousand of the electors
had seen the bill, but was no answer to my
argument. As a matter of fact, there is no
answer.
The Minister for Justice stated during
the campaign that Standing Orders would
compel the Council to constitute a confer-
ence. He must surely be aware that Stand-
ing Orders are merely the machinery
adopted by the Council (or any other public
body) for carrying out, not for influencing
or compelling its decisions. The wording of
the Standing Order governing this particu-
lar issue (No. 152) is abundantly clear. It
commences with the words “If a free con-
ference be agreed to, the managers for the
Council shall,” etc. Clearly, no Standing
Order can operate until after the Council
has agreed to a motion authorising a con-
ference. —Yours etc., Arthur Griffith.

POLITICAL
POINTS
An Anti-Bribery League has been formed
in Sydney; and there is room for it. The
leading spirits propose, not only “to educate
public opinion and take an open stand
against corruption,” but “to prosecute or
assist in the prosecution of offenders.” Most
worthy objects ; but won’t they need to hook
on to the Millions Club?
South Africa, which is suffering from
drought as well as depression, ruefully re-
ports that its “accumulated” railway deficit
has reached £3,694,400. N. S. Wales lias
beaten that in a twelvemonth, without a
drought and without putting anything down
for depreciation. The admitted loss last
year was £4,555,600.
When Westralian Labor was last in office
long-service-leave pay was given to railway
and public-service employees, the 44-hour
week was introduced in Government depart-
ments, day-labor superseded tlie contract,
system, and men of 60 were retired on pen-
sions. It is all to be done over again by tlie
Collier Government, though circumstances
were never so unfavorable. When the
chickens come home to roost tlie Common-
wealth will be blamed, as usual.
The Willis imbroglio may force Lang into
declaring for the immediate Bolshevisation
of everything sooner than lie anticipated or
desired. So far his policy has been the Eng-
lish Labor one of “gradualism.” A politi-
cian’s policy. But leaders of his stamp are
forced to keep moving to tlie Left or give
way to wilder promisers. If Lang came
out to-morrow not only for the seizure of
the banks, but of all the vital controls, in-
cluding transport, food supplies, Ilawkesbury
estates and mortgages on newspapers, lie
would gain a reputation for sincerity of pur-
pose which would bo a deadly blow to the
Willis faction. As against which, of course,
it would open the eyes of his propertied and
employed supporters, and put his party in
tlie background for a generation.
“The Lang nominee defeated Mr. Willis decisively.”
“I’m out o’ condition, and I ’urt me ’and
in the first round, and ’e ’ad a norseshoe
in ’ees glove, an’ somebody ’it me over
the ’ead with a bottle. But w’en I
meet ’im again”
In spite of setbacks, there is again a move
“in certain circles” to have racing control in
Queensland placed in the hands of a State-
appointed board. It is, of course, supported
by “an influential section” of the Labor
party. The Moore Government confirmed by
statute the powers of supervision which the
Q.T.G. lias long exercised over racing in
Bananaland. The club is its own board, and
there arc no fat jobs going for political
heelers.
Downing-street is to be asked to appoint
a Governor of Victoria in succession to
Baron Somers, who retired two years ago;
Lieut.-Gov. Irvine’s term, which expires on
June 30, will be extended until the new
Cocked Hat arrives. It is intended to fur-
bish up Government House, St. Kilda-road,
especially as a royal prince is expected to
he a boarder during the centenary celebra-
tions next year.
What a godsend a nice fat gold-mining
industry is to an impoverished Government! In
the first coalition Budget, ITaveuga, the S’Afri-
can Minister of Finance, has swooped down
on the Johannesburg mining companies ; lie is
taking 10 per cent, of the difference between
the standard price of gold, 84s. 9d. per ounce,
and 120 s. fine. This is expected to bring-
in £6,000,000, and to wipe out the financial
deficit. Allowance is to be made for capital
expenditure; but that has not prevented
Jewburg from roaring “robbery.”
Mt. Lyell’s loss of £30,000 for the six months
to March 31 is making many Tasmanians
look serious, but not some Launceston people.
They are clamoring for another six miles of
road at a cost of some £25,000 to give them
a link with the somewhat tottery mining
community. The State lias already spent
£200,000 to make a motor road from Hobart
to Queenstown. Most of it would be a dead
loss if the mine closed down.
“Young couples wishing to marry are promised
subsidies by Hitler.”
“ Here’s a young woman who could do with
a dfowry. I’ve been trying to get her
off for 14 years.”
'Queensland’s Home Secretary Hanlon has
evolved a bright idea for children leaving the
primary schools. They leave at 14, and Han-
lon’s notion is that those who don’t get work
at once should he trained—boys in trades and
handicrafts, and girls in domestic science-
until they are 46. To extend the compul-
sory school age would penalise those who
had work waiting for them on leaving school;
hence Hanlon’s compromise.
The way of a man with a maid isn’t
nearly so mysterious as the way of a Lang-
planner with newspapers which lambast his
hero before every election and crack the
hero up to the skies when their approval is
of_ no tactical consequence. Some of the
toilers get almost beside themselves while
the lambasting is going on and talk boy-
cott. _ They soon resume their study of the
perfidious sheets. And then comes another
election, and they are stupefied all over
again to find the stark truth being told
about their idol.
Bulk handling of wheat will figure on the
Vic. Argyles’ programme for the session
beginning on June 28, unless the Loan Coun-
cil jibs. The job is estimated to cost two
millions, but if enough for the first year is
forthcoming Cabinet will go on with ii:. And
something will be done for farmers who are
facing ruin, whatever legal qualms Attorney-
General Menzies may have. The ease of
the 300-odd British settlers who, as the
Dethridge Commission reported, were let
down will also be considered. A Cabinet
sub-committee to. which the report was re-
ferred is taking its time, and Ministers will
not he bounced into paying compensation,
but they can’t refuse it altogether.
A Royal Commission has made some
severe remarks about the N.S.W. Metropoli-
tan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage,
now disbanded, the present board and cer-
tain of their employees. It finds that so
egregious a mess was made of the Potts
Hill-Waterloo pressure tunnel that the cost
of repairing the damage would work out
at £924,000. Moreover, “several regrettable
features of the Potts. ITill-Waterloo tunnel
were repeated in the Parramatta River
tunnel”; in that case part repairs only
would run away with £31,000. As' a member
of both boards old Tom ’Enley, M.L.A.,
criticised these and other delinquencies for
years. His reward was to he shot out at
the last election of members.
The fury of the Queensland railwaymen
at the refusal of the Foggy Smiths to return
their contributions to the Moore superannua-
tion fund, now under sentence of death, has
abated. When the Premier announced that
the money would be paid out to men leaving
the service, and that collection of contribu-
tions would go on till July 1, there were
mass meetings and threats of a strike. Foggy
told a deputation the other day that money
paid in after May I—tlie date cancellation
was decided on by Parliament— would be
diverted to a fund to be returned after July
1, when contributions would cease.
An Australian, born at Sydney 67 years
ago, is credited with being the most influen-
tial private citizen who goes to Geneva.
The “National Review,” which likes neither
him nor the League, says it was “to oblige”
this Australian that the British Government
put its luckless embargo on the export of
arms to the belligerents in China. He is
Gilbert Murray, the Oxford professor,
brother of Hubert Murray, Lieut.-Gov. of
Papua, and son of Terence Murray, once
President of the N.S.W. Leg. Council. The
Murrays arc immeasurably more important
than Lang and Willis, but those worthies
have probably got more space in “S. M.
Herald” for their vulgar quarrel than the
brothers have received for all their services
to their generation.
Unemployed-relief taxes bringing in three-
quarters of a million p.a. have hitherto been
used in tho Vic. metropolitan area for the
dole without work. The money is now to be
applied to financing rationed labor on “beau-
tification and improvement” projects—mak-
ing a public garden in the Government
House grounds, titivating tlie surroundings
of the war memorial shrine, brightening up
the Domain and extending the Yarra boule-
vard from Toorak to Ivew. It is expected
that these “improvements of permanent
value” will be completed by October next
year, when the centenary celebrations will be
in full swing. Meanwhile tlie “Produce, pro-
duce !” slogan is for sale, if anyone will
buy it.
During the week in which-all the dazzling
beautification schemes were decided upon, F.
O. Barnett published a report of bis
personal investigations into Melbourne slum
areas. In some of these house frontages of
10ft. to 12ft. are quite the usual thing, and
167 houses are crowded into a space where
12 would exceed the building restrictions in
the outer suburbs. It might be expected
that a community which has £400,000 to
spare on the building of a fancy boulevard
would have at least a similar amount for
the removal of these plague spots, but the
only proposal put forward is that £lO,OOO
should be collected from private subscribers
for the erection of a model suburb.
Bruce evidently regarded himself as shock-
ingly daring—a real devil of a fellow —when
ho told an English audience that Australia
was more insistent on its rights than the
American colonies were. But when the
colonies 'revolted. Democracy was only in
its infancy. Six-year-old children still
worked underground in British coalmines,
people were still living who had seen witches
burned in Massachusetts, slavery was going
strong in England as well as the colonies,
and rotten boroughs were sold to the highest
bidder. When Australia sends a contingent
to Circular Quay dressed as abos. to throw
the imports permitted by Bruce’s Govern-
ment into the harbor, it will be time to make
comparisons.
“The Commonwealth’s acquisition in the Antarctic,
although forbidding in climate, possesses distinct
economic possibilities.”
“But, of course, ladies and gentlemen, you’ll
need a new party. You form it and I’ll
lead it.”
Poor old Stuart-Robertsou, M.L.A. for
Annandale (N.S.W.), has gone where credi-
tors can’t pursue him. After 24 years as
an Assemblyman, he went bung in 1931, hut
lie was back in the House in a fortnight or
so, matters being so hurried for his benefit
that the by-election was held on Anzac Day.
It was then argued that he couldn’t be com-
pelled to pay portion of his salary to credi-
tors ; but Lukin, J., decided against him, so
another supposed Parliamentary privilege
went down tjie wind. The veteran sided with
Lang and Willis when those dear old pals
had their famous fight with Mutch, McTier-
nan, Flannery, Fitzgerald, Lazzarini (the
Carlo Camillo Lazz.), Dunn, Coates and
Gann, and was rewarded with a place in
the second Lang Ministry, which he held for
four months and three w r eeks. That was
his only taste of office, though for 15 months
(1920-22) he was Chairman of Committees.
Lang and Willis did not monopolise last
week the light that beats on political scrap-
pers, although they got most of it. Senator
Hardy and ex-Minister Gullett had a rare
old wrangle on their own account. Hardy
asserted that the Lyons Government had
gone back on its pre-election understanding
with the Cockies about its tariff policy.
What was more, Gullett had boasted about
its perfidy to a deputation of Senators, say-
ing that ‘*on the new programme we won
Maribyrnong and several other seats, and
were able to form a Government by our-
selves and leave tlie Country party out.”
Gullett replied that Hardy’s remarks were
“wild, wide and sheer invention.” Carroll,
the Westralian Senator, interposed that they
were nothing of the kind; he had been a
member of the deputation. Gullett came
back with a statutory declaration, in which
he admitted having made “a tactless, . and
perhaps offensive, observation” to the Sena-
tors touching the true-blue U.A.P. composi-
tion of the Cabinet, not knowing that there
were Cockies among them'; but he insisted
that the Government had been faithful to
its engagements regarding tariff policy.
“The Minister of Agriculture said there was a
general idea that Britain was nearly all one big
manufacturing town. As a fact, Britain employed
more men on the land than any Dominion, except
Canada."
CLARENCE FITZOLODHOPPER : “I can’t for the
bally life of me understand how they
overlooked me!”
The' U.A.P. canvassers in Bulli struck
some rough diamonds. “How about a vote
for Butterell?” one of them asked a North
of England coalie. “Nay,” replied the
coalie; “ma owd mon voted Labor, his owd
mon voted Labor, an’ All’ll vote. Labor."
“But, bang it,” the canvasser persisted, “if
your father had been a thief and his father
had been a thief, that doesn’t say you’d be a
thief.” Coalie: “Nay; happen Ah’d ’a’ been
a U.A.P.”
Wcstralia’s Collier Government did not
interfere with its predecessor’s nomina-
tion of IT. B. Collett as successor to Senator
Colebatch, and the A.I.F. colonel has taken
his seat. He is the twenty-seventh man to
enter the Senate without having had to face
the electors, and the second from the West.
South Aus. has had eight .nominee Senators :
N.S.W., seven; Victoria, five; Tasmania,
four; Queensland, one. Sitting Senators
who were nominated in other years include
two Ministers, Massy Greene (N.S-W-) and
McLachlan (S.A.) ; others are T. C
Brennan (Vic.), C. W. Grant (Tas.), J. V.
MacDonald (Q.) and W. Plain (Vic.).
Last financial year was the worst the
N.S.W. Government railways ever had, and
—partly owing to pleasure-cruise competi-
tion, which is increasing—last summer was
nearly the worst in history for the Sydney
watering-places, Manly perhaps excepted.
But Monro, the district M.L.A., is sure that
a railway would improve the situation for
Cronulla. It would only cost £250,000, he
says (Clyde-Carlingford cost £70,000, and
the losses average £17,500 a year), and the
Sutherland Shire Council would guarantee
the loss if the Government will guarantee
principal and interest. But who will guar-
antee tho Sutherland Shire Council?
From Federal Minister Marr, who has
been visiting New Guinea :
In a Bulletin paragraph referring to a deputation
of rubber-planters, it was said that “Marr promised
to make the usual representationsthe growers
would prefer a bit of the root of all evil.” The
deputation waited upon me at Port Moresby on
May 4% At the conclusion of the interview I imme-
diately dispatched a radiogram to the Prime
Minister, and in reply to my message I was advised
on May 9, not five days later, that an amount of
£4600 had been paid to the credit of the growers.
This was all, and more than, they expected.

HIG!
FRIEND: “It must be distressing for a man to admit he’s had no luck with his fishing.”
WIFE: “It is. My husband always speaks with a catch in his voice after a day’s fishing.”
FY7”: Ancient history was recalled
■when Macrossan, J., sitting at Roma (Q.),
remarked, after a local jury had acquitted a
citizen charged with killing a beast belong-
ing to some one else, “Apparently any tale
will do in Roma.” For years Roma was the
Australian metropolis of cattle-duffing. It
was there that the trial took place for the
cattle-stealing episode immortalised in “Rob-
bery TJpder Arms,” when the accused were
acquitted in the teeth of the deadliest
evidence. The comments of Judge Blake, a
fiery Irishman, on the jury, its antecedents
and its collective pedigree are still quoted
with admiring envy. The Government of
the. day promptly cut Roma off the list of
assize centres. Roma’s troubles! It carried
on, until the sittings of the Court were
restored to it in the reign of good King
Theodore.
“Purl Two”: Knitters may be found in
many unexpected quarters (B. 81/5/’&>).
European shepherds have followed the gentle
art. from time immemorial while watching
their sheep, and old Queensland liands have
left it on record that the Highland shepherds
of . the early Darling Downs brought their
knitting with them from the lone shieling
and the misty island. Writer, himself taught
to knit as a child, lias an out-of-work son
who, among other jobs, knits silk scarves and
other articles of the kind and finds a market
for them. In the old regular army, knitting
was often seen among troops, especially in
Scottish regiments. A memory that remains
is a Highland regiment marching from Mod-
der River to Paardebnrg to the tune of the
pipes, almost every other man, with slung
rifle, busy on a woollen sock.
“J. 8.”: I have just been listening to
“The Old Folks at Home,” sung over the
wireless, and it set me thinking of why
hangmen are on the dole when there are so
many persons worthy of their labors. I
regret that “Nosey Bob” Howard is dead,
for when the crime of a customer particu-
larly annoyed him he would charge nothing
for his services. What a patriot was there !
And what an asset with the wireless bunk
in full swing! Incidentally, it would be a
treat to listen-in to some of our out-of-work
hangmen. In the days when they flourished
in Melbourne they used to be dressed up
in fancy costume, with magenta wigs and
whiskers. It was to one of these guys
that Robert Rohan, who was invited to a
cravat party at Beechwortli (Vic.), made a
remark that must find an allied spot in all
our hearts: “Don’t worry, son. I didn’t com-
mit the murder, but I’ve done plenty of other
things for which I should have been hanged.”
He was the spokesman for mankind. Accord-
ing to a gaol official who ought to know,
the last words of Ned Kelly were, “Ah, well,
I suppose it has come to this.” Which was
about as obvious as the final delivery of
Patrick Geary to the congregation around
the scaffold at Melb, Gaol: “Arrah, me boys;
this is the last of poor Patrick.”
“Bordertown”: The last thing that anyone
would suspect of being liable to be fly-blown
is a telephone. Yet it is quite common for
a telephone mechanic in S.A. to be called out
to a farm during the summer to see what is
wrong with the ’phone, and as a rule it
is found that tiny maggots in millions are the
reason why the instrument is not working.
Cause? Lack of cleanliness. People spit
into the mouthpiece of a ’phone a good deal,
especially when shouting; the moisture
attracts flies, which keep on depositing mag-
gots until their numbers put the instrument
out of action. A daily wipe with a rag
dipped in disinfectant is a sure prophylactic.
“Ike Hollar” : Talking about the effect of
alcohol upon a man’s signature, a Sydney
branch bank has had a strange experience.
Cheques came in with signatures so erratic
that each had to be verified by reference to
the drawer’s office, practically next door.
Later the firm’s accountant arrived with the
wages cheque, and the manager had a word
with him. “This signature is even worse
than the others,” he said. “What’s wrong
with Beano? Has he gone on the spree?”
The accountant grinned. “No,” he retorted;
“for the first time since I’ve been there lie's
dead sober.”
“Aileron”: One of the early objections
to the practicability of the aeroplane was
its alleged liability to be shattered by light-
ning. In spite of the fact that thousands
of ’planes have been caught in and have
flown through violent electrical storms, there
is no recorded instance of destruction by
such an agency. Intensive experiments re-
cently carried out in the United States
show that the ’plane is practically im-
mune from lightning. Even when one
was struck purposely by heavy electrical

glamor attaching to its handle, but more
often it didn’t; the Newcastle (that was)
in Westralia came in the second category.
It was a peaceful pastoral hamlet known
by the native name of Toodyay when some
optimistic persons sought to make it a coal-
field by the nomenclatural method. Years
passed without the township acquiring any
coaliness beyond that suggested by its name,
and the postal authorities finally suggested
a change, as letters intended for Newcastle
(N.S.W.) too often reached the wrong des-
discharges the only damage done was the
making of a small hole in wing surfaces,
while, the metal parts, including the engines,
remained unaffected beyond a momentary
missing of the cylinders due to the interrup-
tion in firing. Theories that many of the
’pianes which have vanished without trace
were lost through lightning—the Southern
Cloud among them—will now have to be
revised.
“Tarry Rope”: The steamer Newcastle,
once the pride of the N.S.W. coast, was
scuttled off the Heads the other day. When
the Sydney-Newcastle railway was in
course of construction the old paddle-wheeler
was introduced to challenge the new com-
petition ; she could do 19 knots an hour, a
creditable speed in those days, and once did
the voyage in 4 hours 20 minutes. When it
was realised that speed competition was use-
less, two boilers were taken out to give more
cargo space and lessen fuel consumption, and
the vessel continued to earn her keep. She
was once on the M'elbourne-Launceston route
under charter to H'uddart Parker, and con-
tinued to make occasional trips to New-
castle up to two years ago. She was stripped
of all that was worth anything before the
mere shell of her old self was sent to the
bottom.
“Sixenate”: In Sydney the other day a
man was called upon to surrender the best
part of a quid in
queer circumstances.
In 1903 lie had been
fined 10s. (and costs)
for disorderly be-
havior and given time
to pay; but, having
nothing to keep him in
Sydney, he wandered
away. The warrant
issued in due course
for his arrest (one of
the officials who signed
it has since been an
S.M. and the other
Under-Secretary for
Justice) was allowed
to languish in a
pigeonhole, and it
might have stayed
there for good if the
now-elderly wanderer,
after having been all
over Australia and to
the war, had not de-
cided to take an alco-
holiday. That landed
him at the Central
Court, and a search
for his record brought
to light the ancient
document. The un-
lucky chap had the
consolation of reflect-
ing that he was paying
at the old rate for an
offence that would
cost twice as much to-
day, and that interest had not been charged.
:[i =:= * ❖
“Jungor”: The letter addressed to
“Blanks, Newcastle,” which went careering
about the globe (B. 31/5/’33), might have
had even a longer pilgrimage, for there are
over a score of Newcastle?! in the British
Empire. The reason for the popularity of
the name is fairly obvious. When coal or
traces of coal were found by early-day pros-
pectors, no name was better calculated to
encourage belief in the genuineness of the
discovery. Sometimes the place deserved the
tination. The suggestion was solemnly de-
bated by the local town council, when one
patriotic Bumble insisted that it was “the
other Newcastle” —of whose very existence
he professed himself to have been previously
unaware—which ought to be rechristened.
However he was overruled, and Newcastle
(W.A.) became Toodyay once more and re-
mains so, the word being locally pronounced
as if it rhymed with Coogee.
“Orwell”: He was a complete answer to
those critics who insist that Sydney men
are slovenly in their dress. He was beauti-
fully swathed in material of a striking and
exclusive pattern; his trousers had just the
requisite degree of sharpness in their
creases. He edged up to me in the crowd
gathered around the Empire Day speakers
in Martin-place and his conversation was
all sunshine—until he asked me for a bob
to buy a meal, because he hadn’t had one
for 24 hours. “Surely if you are as
hard up as that you could get something for
those clothes!” I protested. “But if I let
myself get shabby,” he explained, “I couldn’t
get close enough to anyone to nip him.”
* * *
“Elite”: The advent in Sydney of a child
pianist reminds me of a story Mark Hambourg
used to tell of himself in his unbuttoned
moments—and Mark, a ion viveur of the
best, could be unbuttoned when he liked.
In his Russian childhood lie, too, was a
prodigy, and the grown-ups were fond of
taking him round to the schools at prize-
giving ceremonies and the like to display
his talent to less accomplished kids. All
used to go well until the adults adjourned
for refreshments, leaving Mark alone with
the other youths. With remarks to the
effect that they would show him what they
thought of precocious genius, all and sundry
used to sail into him, with the result that
by the time the ciders came back the infant,
phenomenon was more or less a wreck. One
young devil is very much like another,
whether in Russia or elsewhere.
“Jeviel”: A N.S.W. bushman has good
reason to remember his first flight. He
went up with a barnstorming pilot in a war-
worn Avro, and a few minutes later the
engine cut out 800 feet over a stretch of
timbered country. They heard the under-
carriage ripping through the tips of the
stringybarks as the ’plane sideslipped into
a small clearing, where it straightened out
and bounced to a standstill. When the old
Le Rhone rotary was turning over smoothly
once more, Wings surveyed the clearing
with a practised eye and announced that
the run available was too short for a
normal take-off. But there was a way, he
said, w r hereby he could get out—without
his passenger. Taxi-ing to the leeward end
of the clearing, he produced a length of
thick rope and an axe from a pile of junk
stowed in the fuselage. One end of the
rope was hitched to the ’plane’s tail-skid,
the other to a tree. The pilot climbed
into his cockpit and pushed the throttle wide
open. With the engine running at full
revs, the ’plane strained on the rope like
a dog on a chain. Standing half-blinded in
a cloud of dusp raised by the propeller
backwash, the bushman swung his axe as
directed and cut through the rope where
it passed round the tree. Released, the
’plane hurtled across the clearing and
skimmed the surrounding timber with a
couple of feet to spare. The passenger
reached home in a buggy dispatched by the
airman on his arrival at the nearest land-
ing-ground.
MELEAGER RETIRES HURT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Meleager :
Let your hands meet
For a batsman half-dead,
One who sways on his feet
And whose heart is as lead !
My oath! but this bodyline-racket is rough
on the ribs and the head.
Chorus :
Not with skittling of stumps
In your ears as you ran,
By no fiat of umps.
Was it ended, your span.
Not much! You were beaten and broken
by a blighter who bowled at the man.
Meleager :
Unto each man his fate ;
Unto each, as they say,
Whose hands, shot up straight
None dare disobey.
Yet I would I had copped my quietus in
some less illegitimate way.
Chorus :
For life and for limb
Is new peril to face.
A mixture so grim
Of vonom and pace
Might have rattled redoubtable Ranji and
whitened the whiskers of Grace.
Meleager :
For the yorker that shot
Or the googlie that spun
I cared not a jot;
And I wasn’t the one
To risk my dismissal by trying to sneak
an impossible run.
Chorus :
Though the slips clustered thick
For a punch or a pat,
A cut or a snick
From the point of your bat,
Though lynx-like they crouched in the
gully, you never were bothered by that.
Meleager :
May he die in a ditch
His fast ones who thumps
Half-way down the pitch
To the starboard of stumps
And batters the boldest and bravest of bats-
men with bruises and bumps !
Chorus :
Will Lord’s hear our calls?
Will they ring out the toll
Of these bodyline balls
That so sadden the soul?
Well, here’s wishing old Marylebone reason
—and luck to the Board of Control!

“Ohattis Pultan”: If there are ’Varsity
graduates in the N.S.W. police force (B.
31/5/’33), I can’t help wishing they were
more numerous. A year or two back, com-
plaints of certain advertisements having been
aired in the Leg. Assembly, a circular went
the rounds of N.S.W. police stations, ask-
ing if there were any cases locally of the
Royal Arms being used improperly. Forth-
with came our local inspector round to me,
demauding to know if the rifles in our local
drill hall were safely under lock and key.
Twenty minutes of patient explanation and
ARCTIC GOSSIP.
MRS. PENGUIN : “I wonder how she got that coat on her salary!”
recourse to a dictionary having proved in-
effectual, I took him down to the Govern-
ment Savings Bank to show him what a
coat-of-arms looked like. He went off
grumbling and still a little doubtful.

“M. Burney” : The N.S.W. Bar Council has
decreed that gents, in wig and gown must
not smoke in public places. Possibly the
step has been taken out of regard for public
safety and inflammable horsehair rather than
for the dignity of the profession, for no
objection was ever raised to learned counsel
refreshing themselves with snuff in days
agone. not only between cases but while actu-
ally engaged therein. Even when the snuff-
taking habit was on the wane the practice
died hard in the courts ; Sir Charles Russell
was perhaps the last of the confirmed
addicts. Russell’s snuff-box and his huge red
and yellow bandana handkerchief were quite
as necessary to him as his briefs when he
was professionally engaged, and it was
alleged that on one occasion—during the
Parnell Commission of ’SB-’89 —when some
learned brother had mischievously purloined
his sedative or stimulant, he was unable to
do his duty by his clients till a fresh supply
had been hurriedly obtained for him. But
the Sydney K.C. or junior who has been
accustomed to snatch a few draws from pipe
or cigarette outside the court will have to
put up with the deprivation; it is unlikely
that he has ever learned to chew.

“Exdig”: German ironmongery is still
being dug out of Diggers. A man was taken
out of the line with what appeared to be a
clean bullet wound through liis leg. The wound
was dressed and healed, and no ill-effects
except slight lameness were discernible until
pains developed recently. X-rays showed a
bullet in situ, the only possible explanation
being that, defying the rule that no two
bullets hit precisely the same mark, one
must have followed the other into the wound
and the second one stayed.
“Peckliam”: One has to go back a good
many years to find the late Horatio Bottom-
ley’s appreciations of himself in books of
reference. It is interesting to read, how-
ever, that even in pre-war days lie scheduled
himself with conscious pride as being "gener-
ally regarded as the best: ‘lay lawyer’ in the
country.” It was no vain boast, either, but
a time was to come when neither his vigor
nor his eloquence as a pleader could save
him. There was a good deal of mystery
about this extraordinary man’s family ante-
cedents and parentage; it: is by no means
certain that his name was Bottomley at all.
Various origins were assigned to him, and
the fact that lie was closely associated with
some of the propagandist activities of Charles
Bradlaugh in the ’eighties caused it to be
whispered, years afterwards, that he was a
near relative of that eminent reformer. It
is exceedingly doubtful whether there was
the remotest ground for such a belief or sus-
picion.

“Amity” : A chase the like of which is the
delight of the small boy at the pitchers
occurred in a Ma State town the other day.
The 12-year-old son of the family was sent
on an errand, and seeing his elder brother’s
motor-cycle standing at the gate decided to
borrow it. He knew sufficient about it to
get the machine going, but when some slight
eccentricity in the steering rattled him he ran
it into a hedge, jumped off and rushed for
help. A passer-by happened to notice the
purring machine and went to investigate:
he was horrified when the thing leapt out: of
his grasp and started off along the main
street. Keeping an excellently straight
course it dashed merrily along; the spectacle
of a riderless motor-cycle careering madly
past brought the whole town to its front
doors. It was a telegraph pole that finally
intercepted the runaway.

“China” : All the world likes a resource-
ful rhymer; Unlcy (S. Aus.) has produced
the latest. A carillon was recently presented
to St. Augustine’s Church by a Mr. and Mrs.
Lindow. and a dedicatory ode was a feature
of the inauguratory service. Extracts:—
God, the Fatherly and Sonly,
Bless Thy faithful folk of Unley!
God, the Holy and the Ghostly,
Send them happy moments mostly.
Those who love this Church and serve it,
Grant them peace if they deserve it.
High above the western window
Call the singing bells of Lindow.
The apparent reservations in the opening
petition are clearly attributable to poetic
exigencies, but the prompt grasping of the
Heaven-sent rhyme to that awkward word
“window” compels one’s admiration.
“lan 0.” : Dr.-Charles Strong had an argu-
ment with the Vic. Kirk on the Atonement
iissue, but, unlike the meenistcr “Mac Man-
mus” (B. 24/5/’33) had in mind, he did not
fail to found a church of his own. Dr.
Strong and a number of lay folk who thought
with him established the Australian Church,
and it is still going. Its location is in
Russell-street. west side, between Flinders
and Little Flinders streets. It is half a
century since Dr. Strong relinquished the
kcots Church pulpit,
* * * *
“Hamer”: An attempt to “Brightonise” an
Australian beach lias resulted in a dismal
failure at Coogee (Sydney), where the Rand-
wick Council, which had to take over the
expensive pier owing to the non-payment of
dues, could get no better offer than £l2O p.a.,
with a lease of 28 years, when it sought for
a tenant the other day. The offer was re-
fused, and the council may have to dismantle
the structure—it is liable to become a dis-
figufement, if not an actual danger. There
is too much amusement on an Australian
surfing beach for an amusement pier to be
anything but a non-paying curiosity.
“Mark Time”: There are many customs in
the Military Forces that need scrapping, and
saluting is one of them. A soldier is required
to salute the officer three paces before reach-
ing him and three paces after passing him,
and he must look the officer full in the face
all the time. Exactly how he’s going to
manage that isn’t explained. The soldier is
required to do this, not as a mark of respect
to a “superior officer,” but to a “superior.”
The idea that he salutes the uniform
or the King’s commission is all astray. King
George himself is not entitled to a salute
on the grounds of bis kingship—only as an
honorary colonel.
EVERYTHING IN TURN.
THE WIFE: “You shouldn't have kissed me before everybody, dear.”
THE SINNER ( absent-mindedly ): “Good Lord, did you have your eye on me afterwards.’
“E.M.S.”: A small boy whom I met re-
cently in an outer London suburb professed
a strong dislike for the almost general adop-
tion of the closed-saloon type of automobile
with lockable doors, but for long he evaded
my efforts to find the reason. However, at
last he revealed how this development had
affected the private incomes of himself and
kindred spirits. When they found a motor-
car parked outside a house at night, one of
the gang would switch off the lights and
clear out. Shortly afterwards the others
Would arrive, knock at the house, ask for
the owner of the car and inform him that
liis lights were out and that they thought
the local policeman was in the offing. This
thoughtful action generally produced back-
sheesh from the victim. My query as to the
ethics of the affair brought the virtuous
reply “Oh, but we should never dream
of asking them for anything.”
“Orwell”: Girls will be girls, of
course, but those employed at the
Commonwealth Bank are required to
forget it during office hours. When
on duty, they must stifle their yearn-
ings for variegated finery under a coat
and skirt of black or
navy blue, and the
only color allowed on
cheeks and lips is that
provided by nature.
One of the duties of
a high feminine offi-
cial is to inspect the
girls and see that none
of their loveliness is
artificial. She has. on
occasions, ordered a
girl to wash her face
or do her hair differ-
ently, but it says much
for her tact that she
is universally liked.
Incidentally, the sys-
tem proves that vamp-
ish allurements are
really unnecessary in
the female of the
species. According to
the house magazine,
“Bank Notes,” which
spares a corner for
staff marriages and
engagements, a big
percentage of the girls meet their future hus-
bands as part of the day’s work.
“Bulimia”: One of the N.S.W. Equity
Judges so far departed from the grave tradi-
tions of his jurisdiction the other day as to
advise a solicitor appearing before him to
read Edgar Wallace “to improve his imagina-
tion.” Presumably ’Sonah .is himself a
student of the cliain-story writer, and if so
lie is far from being the only person of
weight and learning who likes his literature
served up in this' guise. The outstanding
example was Charles Darwin. Outside scien-
tific works. Charles never read anything but
detective stories, and those of the trashiest
and most lurid kind he could lay hands on,
which, in his day, was saying something.
“Centurion”: When it was recently
announced that there was only one donkey
on the strength of the British army there
was a wild surmise as to the location of the
soloist. Now it has been revealed that the
creature is in Ally Sloper’s Cavalry—other-
wise the A.S.C. —and is stationed at Gib-
raltar. H'is job is carrying wet clothes from
the military laundry to the drying ground
and back again ; his name is Billy Gibraltar.
Many members of other corps will envy him
for being in the A.S.C., for he can get a rum
issue whenever he feels like it, following on
the traditions of that distinguished corps.
* * * *
“X.S.”: Something unusual in conspira-
cies was unveiled in a Melbourne court
recently, the case resulting in two criminals,
one with six convictions against him and
the other with ten, getting two years apiece.
A brother of two young farmers is in gaol.
They received a letter from one of the
accused stating that he could arrange to get
the prisoner released. The two brothers
went to Melbourne, and the writer of the
letter introduced them to a man “in a high
position in the Treasury,” confidentially in-
forming them that lie himself had been let
out; by this same State philanthropist. The
high Treasury official informed them that
nothing was easier than to square Govern-
ment officials, though, as there were four
departments concerned, at least £lOO would
be required. The brothers handed over a
fiver on account and then went and inter-
viewed the police. At the next meeting with
the conspirators £3O was offered, but it was
regarded as insufficient. A police trap
closed the chapter. The brothers met the
alleged Treasury official again, and just
as that distinguished gentleman was putting
out his hand to take 45 notes he was
pounced on by two John Hops. In the
meantime, more police were interviewing his
helpful friend and an extraneous female in
a doorway in Collins-street.
“Adelaide”: A torn-up will has been
granted probate by the S. Aus. Supreme
Court. The wife is said to have done the
tearing 15 years ago. on reading that her
life-interest was to cease if she remarried.
Instead of copying it out afresh,' the tes-
tator husband just treasured the pieces, and
now that he is dead the Court has called
them “complete and clear.”
* * =s
“Exdig”: Thousands of British regulars
were expert with the knitting needles, and
could crochet too, but there were other “femi-
nine” industries learnt by some men with
the A.I.F. I know one man, a very gallant
soldier who won his commission, who supple-
ments substantially the very poor salary he
is able to earn in his post-war clerkship by
making artificial flowers. He is a real
artist at the game; but it always strikes
me as rather incongruous to. see the man who
won a captaincy and a string of medals en-
gaged in the finicky work. He learnt the art
whilst lying in hospital with head injuries
which put reading out of the question.
* * *
“Uwins”: As a curious by-product of the
anti-German boycott by London Jews the
cable mentions that a recent boxing-match
at the Albert Hall (where one of the con-
testants was a Teuton) was something of
a wash-out in the matter of attendance.
Jews, one learns from the same authority,
are among the most consistent patrons of
the noble art; they supply half the spec-
tators at London contests. This takes
some swallowing, but I have seen advertise-
ments and posters of boxing matches printed
in Yiddish, and there have been many fine
Jewish pugilists. In the palmy days of the
ring one of the first boxing schools in
London was opened by Mendoza, a famous
fighter of his time, in 1791.
♦
“Waranbini”: The proposal, to convert
the dry bed of Lake George (N.S.W.) into
a speed track recalls that Robert Cooper,
son of Pope Cooper, one-time Chief
Justice of Queensland, laid the foundations
of a big fortune on that ground. The
Coopers were the first whites to .settle at
Lake George, on the Crown grant Willeroo.
They got their first lift during a severe
drought, which enabled them to purchase
stock cheap from famished runs. The
cattle were fattened on the bed of Lake
George, where abundant herbage appeared
as the water dried up, and were afterwards
killed and boiled down for tallow, which was
sewn up in the skins of the beasts and con-
veyed by waggon to Sydney. The Lake has
filled and dried up several times since then,
wherefore old hands are dubious about it
being a permanent racing ground.
THE SOFT ANSWER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Stevens created great laughter at one of his
meetings in the Bulli election campaign when he
silenced a young l woman by assuring her that she
was too good-looking to hoot.”
You gents, on the hustings who thunder or

Don’t ever forget that it pays,
The gentle rejoinder that mitigates wrath,
The blandness that, anger allays.
And ’mong the soft words that placate or

When people to rudeness arc prone,
A sprightly allusion to feminine charm
Has a telling appeal of its own.

Don t bluster or put in the boot
When you face interruption acute
From a vehement skirt;
If you’re wise and alert,

PERSONAL
ITEMS
John T. Sweeney, of Bulli, enters Par-
liament at an exceptionally ripe age:
John was born at Campbelltown (N.S.W.)
67 years ago. He worked as a miner up till
50, when he exchanged underground activi-
ties for a union-secretary’s office chair, and
doubtless the vote he received (even as a
pawn for Lang) was largely a tribute to his
stauch trade-unionism and the regard in
which he is held locally.
Leo O’Connor, the new manager of the
Queensland Workers’ Dwellings and State
Advances Corporation, entered the State ser-
vice in 1912 when 22. His first job was in
the Government Savings Bank—lie had six
years’ previous banking experience with the
Commercial of Australia —and he was later
transferred to his present department, be-
coming senior clerk in 1924. He is well
known to Australia generally as an inter-
state cricketer, and is nowadays concerned
with the administrative side of the game as
a member of the Q.C.A. executive.
Sea dogs are a hardy race; at 79 Captain
Hunter has retired from bis command of the
N.S.W. coaster Wollongbar. He was allowed
to make his retirement synchronise with his
2000th time of taking his vessel in and out
of Byron Bay. The old salt has been on that
trip for 30 years; before that he had a world
experience of ships, including whalers.
After filling the billet provisionally for six
months, since the death of M. P. Hansen,
James Mcßae lias been appointed Yic.
Director of Education. Frank Tate, , a
former Director, took a fancy to (Mcßae
some years ago and helped him to gradually
work up to the job of chief inspector of
primary schools. Hansen, then chief inspec-
tor of secondary schools, beat Mcßae for
the directorship when Tate retired five years
ago. The new chief is in his 63rd year, so
he will only have a two and a half years’
run in the head job.
Walter Massy Greene, Assistant Treasurer
in the Lyons Ministry, who has just col-
lected a K.C.M.G., was born 58 years ago
in London, and came to Australia as a lad
of 16. The Bank of N. S. Wales was his
first employer, but the call of the land pre-
sently drew him away from ledgers. He
has liad 23 years in Federal politics, with
one brief interlude. Richmond sent him
there, and he had established such a reputa-
tion as Minister for Customs that he
Senator MASSY GREENE , K.C.M.G.
would almost certainly have succeeded
Hughes as Prime Minister if Richmond had
remained faithful to him. Unfortunately it
preferred another Green. Roland, at the
1922 election, and it was Stanley Bruce who
displaced Hughes as the head of the Govern-
ment. Massy Greene wasn’t out of Parlia-
mentary harness long; he was returned as
a Senator a few months later, and has re-
mained one ever since.
Robert James Stuart-Robinson, who passed
out at 59 last week, was one of the veterans
of the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor party.
He was returned for the Camperdown seat
in September, 1907, and held it until 1920,
when the adoption of the proportional
representation system caused a big shuffle
of electorates. For the next seven years
he was one of the five members for Balmain,
and since 1927 he had been the elect of
Annandale. Despite his long service and his
staunch trades-unionism, Stuart-Robinson
tasted the sweets of office rarely. Shop
assistants will gratefully remember him for
his efforts to improve their conditions.
Charles Gavan Duffy, who occupies the
vacancy on the Vic. Supreme Court Bench
caused by the death of Leo Oussen, is a son
of Frank Gavan Duffy, C.J. of the High
Court. The new incumbent was born in Mel-
bourne and educated at Riverview (Sydney),
Xavier (Melbourne) and the Melbourne
University. With his two brothers he served

Supreme Court Judge.
in the Great War and emerged with a
majority. He gives up one of the most
juicy Melbourne practices for the £2,500
p.a M less 25 per cent, economy cut, of his
new office. Duffy used to be an athlete and
an inveterate rider after the hounds, and liis
bluff, good-humored face bears a close resem-
blance to that of Police Commissioner,
Blarney.
Edward Mann Clarke, who died last week
iii Sydney at 72, held an Assembly seat for
16 years, and as a North Shore alderman
he was almost a fixture; he sat in the
North Shore Council for 38 years, putting-
in three mayoral terms. Clarke arrived in
the Assembly in 1891 in a fierce blaze of
flame, having defeated the ageing Henry
Parkes for St. Leonards. That was the end
of the veteran, whom Parliament was to
know no more, but Clarke never quite lived
up to his initial achievement; a pronounced
independence was part of his make-up, and
he chafed under party discipline. His muni-
cipal activities were more fruitful; he was
one of the original members of the Kuring-
gai Chase Trust, and he had much to do
with the establishment of the Taronga Park
Zoo.
Had an 80th birthday in Adelaide, W. G.
Torr, retired schoolmaster, Oxford-trained,
and a voluminous writer, mainly on reli-
gious subjects.
Captain E. H. Davey. who died at
Sydney last week, had his full share of
perilous adventures and hairbreadth ’scapes.
He was in charge of a troopship at the Gal-
lipoli landing; later he commanded mine-
sweepers, and was severely wounded and
all but drowned when one of these was
mined. Recovering, he served on submarines
in the Mediterranean; after that he trans-
ferred to Commander Locker-Lampson’s
armored-car section in Russia, was captured
by the Bolsheviks, escaped from gaol at
Odessa, and got out of the country in an
American ship. The captain, who came of
a. naval stock, was born at Devonpoit (Eng.)
60 years ago.
John Musgrave Harvey, the new N. 8.
Wales K. 8., who looks like succeeding Philip
Street as State Chief Justice, was born and
educated in England, but he learned his law
in Australia. The son of a Middlesex vicar,
he went from Marlborough to Iveble College,
Oxford, an institution which turns out more
parsons and schoolmasters than members of
other professions—E. M. Baker, the late
headmaster of The King’s School, was a
Iveble man. Harvey, who was a classical
scholar, would probably have become an
educationist, too, but for a visit to Sydney
after taking his degree, which decided him
to settle here and carve out a legal career
for himself. In this he was eminently suc-
cessful; called to the Bax* in 1892, lie soon
made a name on the Equity side. He
accepted a Supreme Court judgeship 29
years ago—like England’s late Justice
McCardie he never took silk —and became
the senior on the Bench a few weeks ago.
The new knight is an earnest churchman
as well as a sound lawyer.
Another reminiscence of the late Leo
Cussen, J. He consulted a Melbourne
specialist, and was told that he would have
to have part of his colon removed. ‘‘Will
I recover?” asked ’Sonah. “Oh, certainly,”
replied the sawbones. “Go ahead, then,” said
Cussen. “Better a semi-colon than a full-stop.”
Eric Chaseling, who has been appointed
instructor to the Victorian Aero Club in
place of Captain Eric Chater (off to New
Guinea Airways), gained his ticket from the
Sydney Aero Club in 1926. He went to the
TJ.S.A. a year later to study various types
of ’planes, and on his return was acquired
by Charles Ulm for Australian National Air-
ways ; Eric was mail pilot, on the Brisbane-
Sydney run before transferring to the
Sydney-Melbourne route. He holds two Aus-
tralian records, a flight from Melbourne to
Sydney in 2 hours 44 minutes and a Mel-
bourne-Launceston hop in 1 hour 58 minutes.
“Bay” Moulden, dead in Adelaide at close
on 80, was a fine old family solicitor, and
trustee in countless estates. The business
was founded by his father. Eldin, and is
carried on by his son Arnold. His •'partner
and nephew Frank, sevei'al times mayor of
the city, died last year.
The Legion of Frontiersmen lost a staunch
member when the Last Post sounded for
Captain John Stanley Hughes in London.
Educated at Charterhouse, lie came to Aus-
tralia and got his colonial experience on
sheep and cattle stations, with a turn at
prospecting and mining. His craving fox-
adventure took him to S’Africa, and in 1890-
91 he sex-ved with the B.S.A. Police in the
Mashonaland Expedition. Back to Australia,
he departed for the Boer War with the Ist
Queensland Mounted Contingent. After this
Hughes settled down to a quiet life of lit-
erary and newspaper work until 1914, when
the Great War gave him the chance to help
by enlisting men iix the Legion. Finally, he
managed to wangle his own enlistment and
spent two years in France attached to the
84th Battalion. On being invalided home
he resumed newspaper work. One of his
jobs was editor of the Dubbo “Liberal.” Cap-
tain Hughes was 69.
N.S.W. ex-Judge Backhouse, 82 last month,
is the exception that makes the District
Court Judges’ retiring-age rule look prema-
ture. In his spare time ’Sonah has always
been a patron of Australian literature, the
theatre, cricket and aquatics—he started to
be an official of the Anniversary Regatta in
1870. —and he still retains his alertness. He
is a walking library of anecdote and history
oil all his subjects. He was appointed a
District Court Judge in 1884 and retired 12
years ago.

Colonel Herbert Brayley Collett, who
stepped into Hal Colebatch’s shoes as a
Westralian Senator last April, was born in
Guernsey in 1577, and was brought to Perth
as a youngster. He joined the civil service
when fresh from school and rose to the posi-
tion of Assistant General Secretary and
Librarian of the Public Library, Museum
and Art Gallery. An ardent volunteer in
pre-war days, in 1914 he raised and com-

manded the 28tli Infantry Batt.. A.1.F., and
served in Gallipoli, Egypt and France, being
wounded at Pozieres in July, 1916. His
war services earned him a D.S.O. and C.M.G.
Since 1925 he has been State president of
the R.S.L. The new Senator has published
two books, “Infantry in Attack” (1906) and
“The 28th, a Record of War Service” (1922).
Thomas Kay Sidey, who passed out at the
70tli milestone in Dunedin the other day,
was a lawyer who represented Dunedin
South in Parliament from 1901 to 1928, and
was then translated to the Leg. Council as
its leader, with portfolio of Attorney-
General, in Baronet Ward’s last Adminis-
tration. Later, when Wilford went to Lou-
don, Sidey became Minister of Justice. A
staunch Seddonian Liberal and a good Pres-
byterian, Sidey. will have a niche in M.L.
political ■ history for his persistence in advo-
cating daylight saving. For 19 years, com-
mencing in 1908, he brought forward a bill
to make clock-alteration in summer time
compulsory every year. It was passed at
long last in 1927.
Dead in S.A., at 94, Ebenezer Donaldson,
Irish-born, but an Australian since 1853.
He could remember wheat being 225. a bushel

mouth.
Tom (Seymour) Buffett, who passed
away recently at sea, while voyaging from
Eromanga to Vila, was a Norfolk Islander
whose mother arrived as an infant in the
wholesale migration from Pitcairn in June,
1856. The mother is one of the four original
Pitcairners (two women and two men) still
left on Norfolk Island. Of her family of
12, seven have died away from the island.

Last year’s net premiums exceeded all visible
outgoings by £16,583, an improvement of
■£11, 027, due partly to alterations in the
method of book-keeping. Nevertheless, it was a
surprising performance. Rigid selection of
risks and yet lower expenditure were respons-
ible. The co. has followed a conservative
policy ever since it was formed under a deed
of settlement in 1872. The original cash-paid
capital of £6250 rose to £120,000 (its present
figure) by transfers from reserves. Good
divs. were paid all along. Previously semi-
mutual, the co. joined the tariff offices in
1920.
Last year’s underwriting surplus (13.8 p.c.
on capital) was exceptional. Slightly more
premiums were rejected, as the following
table shows: —
Loss. Expense.
Premiums. Claims. Expenses. Rate. Rate.
1900. . £33,888 £8,131 £13,765 24.0 p.c. 40.7 p.c.

1932.. 95,965 29,441 49,941 30.7 „ 52.0 „
Still, the management knew wffiat it was
doing; claims were £S7I lighter, making off
with 30.7 p.c. of the year’s premiums, as
against 30.9 and 37.8 p.c. in the two preced-
ing years. The apparent drop of £13,077
in expenses and of 12.3 p.c. in the expense rate
is not all it looks ; but there was a real saving
of a substantial amount. But the chief
source of divs. is returns from the invest-
ment of the co.’s capital and corpulent re-
serves. After charging a larger proportion
of exes, against income from investments,
there was a slip of £5304 in last year’s
interest, receipts, etc. (£21,799), which were
18.1 p.c. on capital. Still, the net return
from all sources was £5705 better at 32 p.c.
on capital, and the div. was lifted to 25 p.c.
again; though the 25 p.c. called for no more
than 8.9 p.c. on shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined), which have been
diligently built up over the last 60 years.
There are few, if any, offices doing similar
business which can show their policy-holders
a wider margin of protection. At the end
of 1932 net tangibles were equal to 450 p.c.
of the year’s net premiums, or sufficient to
cover the year’s claims more than 14 times
over. Assets are a solid lot, too:

Freeholds principally represent a property-
on the corner of King and Pitt streets, Syd-
ney. It is entirely a lettiug proposition, the
co. itself living in rented premises. Invest-
ments include £136,895 of Government stock,
£13,000 deposited with the Government.
£4OOO in the old Rural Bank loan, and
£35,592 of shares, debentures, etc. The cash
(£90,000) is mostly on fixed deposit.
The pound shares, which are tightly held,
of course, are covered by £3 12s. Id. in net
tangibles.
Toowoomba Permanent Building Society
This is a purely mutual concern which
makes advances on mortgage for 20 years or
more to enable borrowers to purchase, build
or improve their homes. No bonuses are
paid ; so profits are not aimed at, and little
or no income tax is payable. Further, the
business is conducted at small cost, thus
enabling a high rate of interest to be paid
to depositors, while borrowers of the society’s
funds have been able to get the money at a
bit less than the rate usually asked for first
mortgages in Queensland.
These and other things, including the long-
term nature of the loan, help to explain the
growth of the business since 1923, when the
bonus system was abandoned in favor of the
present plan:—

Last year there was a net shrinkage of
£5868 in deposits as against a growth of
£4443, £38,893 and £88,212 in each of the
three preceding years. New advances totalled
£45,233 (£5426 less than for the previous
year), and repayments amounted to £647
more than that. The charge to borrowers was
reduced by 1J p.c., leaving the rate at 6£ p.c.,
which brought in £44,622, or £BOl6 less than
in the previous term, while depositors received
6 p.c. as against 7 p.c. formerly. The J p.c.
margin, together with sundry receipts, cov-
ered the whole of the management charges,
etc. (£3947), and left £436 for reserves,
making them £17,214 at the end of February.
Balance-sheet figures compare as follows :
1924. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Deposits .. £257,012 £721,911 £726,354 £720,491
Other liabilities 9,449 131 96 123
Suspense account 9,040 4,550 4,115 7,212
Reserves .. 10,321 15,907 16,778 17,214
Advances .. 278,163 716,148 713,493 712,846
Premises and
fittings .. 2,309 2,148 2,079 2,040
Investments, etc. 7,090 24,953 32,771 31,155
Thus advances have stepped down from 108.2
p.c. of deposits in 1924 to 98.9 p.c. at the
close of last accounts. To represent the
other £14,980 then coming to depositors and
others, there were premises with a book
value of £2040 and investments, etc. (mainly
Government securities and cash), totalling
£31,155, equal to £4 ss. 7d. per £lOO of
liabilities. Including the tax reserve
(£1000), the visible protection against pos-
sible losses amounts to £15,214, or a little
over 6d. in the £ of advances. In order to
strengthen the protection, borrowers are to
be charged 61 p.c. and the rate to depositors
reduced to 5| p.c.

The March half includes the thirsty summer
months. The number of men engaged in gold-
mining in Westralia has more than doubled
over the last two years, and so has the value
of the output in Australian currency. Also,
in accordance with the Privy Council deci-
sion. the tributors’ share of the exchange
premium has been scattered since the begin-
ning of 1933.
So, despite the low’ level of pastoral and
agricultural incomes and stinging increases
in excise, etc., this co.’s admitted gross earn-
ings (£200,455) for the 12 months to the
end of March sprang £10,795. Including an
extra £5102 set aside for taxation (£22,8551
and an additional £4947 struck off for depre-
ciation (£36,302), exes. (£126,067) took only
£3039 of the increase. Thus, after taking
into the reckoning £13,470 dropped from
somewhere into reserves, and handing the
profs, their £2OOO, there was enough profit to
show 20.1 p.c. on ordinary capital as against
17.3, 21.5, 26.7. 29.2 and 27.3 p.c. back to
1928. So the div., which had dropped to 12
p.c. for the September half of the two pre-
ceding years, was lifted to 16 p.c. again.
The co. has a firm hold on the trade in
its ow’n State —has had ever since the dis-
coveries of Ford and Bayley started the first
rush of thirsty people to Coolgardie towards
the close of 1892. For nearly 20 years after-
wards Swan’s divs. ranged from 24 p.c. to
32 p.c. Following the transfer of £101.450
from reserves to capital the rate dropped to
16 p.c. in 1911; it remained steady, swefet-
ened with 4 p.c. bonuses in the fattest
periods, until the September half of 1931.
Impressed by the co.’s performances and
its prospects, the market has lengthened its
bid for the fully-paid 255. ords. from 555. to
755. over the last 18 months. The return at
755. is 5.3 p.c. on a 16 p.c. div.
basis. The net tangible backing is visibly
£3 3s. Id. per share. That is to say, the
pref. div. and 16 p.c. to the ords. call for 6.2
p.c. on capital and reserves combined.
Constant additions have been made to the
brewery, hotel freeholds, etc., and paid for
out of earnings ; then from the same source
these items have been written down, keeping
book values low in relation to their earning
capacity in the past. Here is the position as
the published figures show it: —

their net book value at £676,479. Altogether,
£11,540 more was written off than was spent
on fixed assets, and £16,159 was added to
the cash holding. Visibly, the more or less
liquid surplus (£92,576, excluding shares
in other cos.) sprang £36,833. That is
treating “accounts in credit,” which the
“Wild Cat” suspects are largely genuine
profit, as a liability.

After discussing the matter with the audi-
tors, the board has rearranged all existing
reserves, visible and internal, with the idea
of “earmarking appropriate amounts against
specific assets, including a substantial sum
for hire agreements under contract.” In-
cluding £7403 struck off the book value of
shares in the Concord Piano Co. (in liq.),
and £4263 transferred to the p. and 1.
account, the year’s visible unexplained addi-
tions to reserves were £44,439. But
£15,500 earmarked for bad and doubtful
debts at the close of accounts _ in 1932
is no longer visible; some or all of it appears
to have been deducted from the book value
of the assets concerned. A new item, labelled
“reserve in respect of real property, £43,728,”
has now appeared. The year’s net growth
in the book value of freeholds and mortgages
combined, was £61,189. It is quite probable,
therefore, that the book value of the free-
hold (now shown separately at £174,915 for
the first time) was written up by a lot more
than £43,728.
Before the close of accounts in 1930 the
co. sold its Pitt-street freehold and bought
another in George-street. The profit on the
deal was £75,689, which was tucked away
amongst inner reserves by striking that
amount off the book value of the new pre-
mises. Here is the position as the published
figures show it: —

Sundry assets 14,367 13,281 13,314, 6,644
Last year £24,516 was snipped off the over-
draft and £5OOO off the mortgage, and £2140
was added to the amount coming to sundry
creditors, making the net reduction in the total
debt £27,376. The reduction in the book
value of stocks, hire agreements, etc. —-an
untidy entry—was £49,864, and £61,159 was
added" to the book value of the freeholds and
mortgages, already referred to. The drop
of £6670 in sundry assets reflects the writ-
ing down of the Concord Co.’s shares, which
now figure at £4869. Excluding these, but
including mortgages (£70,000), the book
value of more or less liquids exceeded liabili-
ties by £98,373 at the end of March. The
£59,603 of nominal reserves then available
was equal to 7s. 9d. in the pound of the
figure at which stocks and book debts
appeared.
After transferring £4263 from reserves to
cover a loss on transactions entered into
prior to March, 1930, the loss on last year’s
trading was £llOB. For the four years to
the end of Sept.. 1916, divs. averaged 6.6
p.c., followed by a steady 10 p.c. for the next
decade. Then the co.’s outlook changed com-
pletely, and it may be a while before much
brightness comes into it again. Hence the
market prices the pound shares at ss. (Id.

In a going concern, plant is worth what it
can earn. Thus, although the co. had spent
an extra £300,000-odd on equipment for the
manufacture of turbo-alternators in 1921,
seven years later its Clyde works were
reckoned to be worth no more than £75,000.
That was because the Government failed to
give the support promised, despite the
efficiency of the co.’s product. So 7s. 9d.
per share was slashed off capital and £40,000
that had been put in the cupboard went
down the sink ; the debenture debt (£33,400)
was repaid and 2s. 3d. per share was
returned in cash.
After that two of the subsidiaries, Wey-
mouths and McCulla’s, went into liquidation.
Things looked black locally ; so the money was
invested in Wilson and Co.’s 7 p.c. pre-
ferreds, bought in New York at less than 50
dollars per 100-dollar share. The scrip
was transferred to a new subsidiary, Stan-
ways, Ltd. (paid capital £61,637), registered
in the F.M.S., and the parent returned a
further 6s. Bd. per share of its capital, re-
ducing it to its present figure, in Stanway
scrip.
There isn’t much demand for electric trans-
formers and switch-gear these days, so incu-
bators have been added to the list of manu-
factures. The call for these was late last
year, and only £396 of profit showed up, an
improvement of £4564.0n the previous year's
result.
The market sums up the co.’s prospects
by paying 3s. 3d. for the 13s. 4d. shares, thus
pricing the undertaking at £30,048, or
£110,580 less than its net book value at the
end of March.
There is nothing to worry about in the
finances:—

The co.’s store at Waterloo is vacant, and
thus far efforts to sell it have been unsuc-
cessful. Since the books closed £13,168 com-
ing to Stanways has been repaid, and the
investment in that concern (in at £15,601)
sold.
Hadfields ( Aust.), Ltd.
This co. proposes to take over the Sydney
and Bassendean (W.A.) business and works
of Hadfields (Australia), Ltd. (in liq.).
which a few years back had a turnovef of
between £150,000 and £200,000 p.a. in speci-
ally-processed and alloy steels. The old busi-
ness was started in 1916 as Australian Elec-
tric Steel, Ltd.; in 1920 Hadfields, of Shef-
field, sold the co. an exclusive license to
manufacture steel and steel products in Aus-
tralia and Maofiland under the Hadfield
system for shares, and the new title was
taken. The Australian co. failed to fulfil
its part of the contract in the matter of
raising fresh capital, and the agreement was
terminated; thereafter the two cos. were in
active competition in the Australian market.
There was a costly lack of co-ordination on
the Australian co.’s board, and it went into
liquidation a couple of years ago.
The present co. is acquiring the old assets
for an unspecified consideration, but it is
very much below former book values. The
promoters or their nominees propose to sub-
scribe £5OOO cash for 100,000 deferred shilling
shares; and the public is invited to take up
£lOO,OOO in 6 p.c. 10-year debentures of £lO
each, five free fully-paid ordinary shares going
out with each debenture'. The free scrip
will apparently be provided out of the esti-
mated under-valuation of the undertaking as
acquired from the liquidators. The object
of the debenture issue is to provide for the
consideration to the. liquidators and work-
ing capital. By the outlay of £6790 in addi-
tional equipment the co., it is reckoned, will

TO REAL ESTATE MEN AND
COMPANY PROMOTERS.
A small Queensland Syndicate has purchased
approximately 14,000 acres ot land in one block
within 14 miles of the G.P.0., Brisbane, and adjacent
to the Main Highway to Ipswich. This vast area
of land, practically in Brisbane, has been acquired
by the Syndicate for the ridiculous price of £1 per
acre, and it has been classified by one of Australia’s
acknowledged leading authorities in Tobacco as the
best Tobacco Land in every respect in Queensland.
Mr. C. J. Tregenna, Tobacco Expert of the New
South Wales Government, who inspected the property,
stated that the soils of this property are typical
of soils that produced the highest grade of leaf in
most other parts of the world, and that the rainfall
and climatic conditions during the growing season
are, in his opinion, most suitable. A sample of leaf
produced in the immediate neighborhood on land
inferior to large areas of the property under con-
sideration was superior to any Australian leaf he had
ever tested, and was so like American leaf in most
qualities that it was difficult to distinguish any
difference.
Apart from Tobacco-growing, the land on this
Estate was previously valued by a Queensland Gov-
ernment Valuer at £6 per acre throughout for
ordinary agricultural purposes.
The present holding Syndicate is not in a position,
financially or otherwise, to handle it satisfactorily,
and is prepared to negotiate with some reputable
Company or Syndicate, either to purchase its
rights outright or work in conjunction in the forma-
tion of a Company to handle this remarkable pro-
position. . . ...
This is one of the greatest opportunities in land
ever offered in Australia. Full particulars and sub-
stantiating reliable evidence will be submitted to
principals.
Apply, in the first instance, to
Messrs. HOBBS, CAINE and MCDONALD,
Solicitors,
270 Queen Street, Brisbane.
be in a position to manufacture a new line,
chilled-steel rolls, not at present turned out
in Australia.
If the present issue is successful, paid
capital will be £55,007 in 50,007 £1 ord.
shares and 100,000 shilling deferreds. De-
bentures will amount to £lOO,OOO, and capital
reserve account to £107,107. Freeholds are
valued at £35,500 in a pro forma balance
sheet, plant at £141,687, patterns £32,846,
fittings £1599. stocks £20,710, and debtors
£9764; cash would amount to £20,007. The
backing for each £1 of debentures would thus
be £2 125., including assets valued at half
of what they cost the old co.
Lack of working capital was one of the
causes of the old co.’s crash. The new one
anticipates a ready market for its products ,
certainly, tariff and exchange conditions are
favorable, though constructional activity is
depressed. The W.A. works alone (the
Sydney plant is inactive), carried on by the
liquidators, were reported to be earning at
the rate of nearly £6OOO p.a. during the first
quarter of this year.
The debentures should appeal to those who
are conversant with the construction trades;
the works are open for inspection. With
harmony on the board and able management
the co. should stand a much better chance
than its predecessor. The directors may go
to allotment when £50,000 of debentures have
been subscribed.
Sunkissed Bananas (Tweed), Ltd.
This co., the prospectus of which was the
subject of a “Blain English” article last
week, has decided to change its scheme on
several important points, though it claims
that in its belief tlie original plan was “in
every way fair and just.” The bonds are to
be called Banana Plantation Development
Contracts, and the trust deed is to be altered
so that shareholders will not be entitled to
more than 10 p.c. of the face value of the
bond contracts in respect of the land and
services charged to contractees, or more than
a maximum of 30 p.c. of the net (not gross )
profits from the sale of bananas. The 10
p.c. is not excessive, and shareholders will
have to show bondholders at least £7 net
from the sale of bananas for every £3 they
take themselves. These alterations are in
keeping with suggestions made by the “Wild
Cat” from time to time. The prospectus
bases its costs on the estimates of Professor
Goddard, of the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research; it places field costs at
£lOO an acre in bringing the bananas to the
producing stage, but any saving on this item
or cost of land will now be credited to the
bondholder. The co. proposes eventually to
market tinned, dried and powdered bananas.
Austral Malay Tin, Ltd.
The story of Austral Malay and its sub-
sidiaries for the year ended December 31,
1932, is practically that of all companies
mining for tin in Malaya. The heavy fall
in tin prices and the subsequent restriction
of output have made the year a difficult one.
But the big jump during the past few months
—the metal stood at £2lO 7s. 6d. per ton,
London, at the week-end —argues happier
times for the future. Austral Malay’s own
position is satisfactory. Of the subsidiary
cos. only Asam Kumbang and Pungah Tin
worked throughout the year, and that on
part time. Pangnga River holds shares in
Ivamunting Tin Dredging, which worked in-
termittently. The other cos. closed down,
and income from shareholdings was only
£2595, being divs. from Asam Kumbang,
Kamunting Tin and Pangnga River. Ex-
penditure on working account was £2569,
leaving a profit of £25. Sundry income for
the year (£569) has been used to write off
depreciation.
The Government embargo on alienating
further lands for dredging tin continues in
force, but the parent devoted its spare time
to prospecting (unsuccessfully) for gold.
Investments in the subsidiary cos. are shown
at £202,585 (sterling). Surplus funds in
Singapore municipal stock stand at £ll2O,
and cash at £10,093. Liabilities figure for
£10,060. Paid capital is £lOO,OOO, and
the reserve fund stands at £115,874, with a
contingency account of £3761.
Pungah, though working nothing like full
capacity, made a, working profit of £29,886,
compared with £34,807 in 1931. Surplus
went in writing off balance of development
account, amortisation and depreciation. Ex-
ternal debt was cut from £32,433 to £12,950,
and this last has since been paid off.
Directors anticipate that with tin at the April
level, and with no further restriction, excess
of revenue over working costs will continue.
Payment of divs. will begin ,as soon as cash
reserves to meet normal requirements are
available. At December 31, cash was
£3632, ore in hand £0235 and stores £9834.
Capital is £430,000.
Asam Kumbang, which has been carrying
the baby for Puchong and Ulu Yam by tak-
ing over their quotas, earned enough in the
year to justify the payment of divs. Unless
there is a drop in tin prices, 10 per cent,
on the £lOO.OOO capital is anticipated
this year. The co. earned a working
profit of £9645 for 1932, compared with
£15,897 in 1931. Four sixpenny dividends
took £lO,OOO. and £5597 was brought for-
ward. Interest on investments and sundry
earnings provided £3165, which has been used
for writing down property and plant. Mod-
ernisation of the dredge begins in July, and
while that is going on dividends may be
taken from reserves. Cash balances are
£30,609, and investments £14,568.
Kampong Kamunting’s dredge was closed
down all the year, but the quota for No. 1
dredge was transferred to Kedah producers
and £Bl3 realised. As expenditure was
£2694, a loss of £lBBl is shown for the year,
following a loss of £4461 in 1931. A shilling
dividend absorbed £7OO0 —capital is £70,000
in 140,000 10s. shares —and stores were
written down by £1691. The items were
met by interest income of £1670 and the
transfer of £8902 from reserves. The book
surplus on the sale of No. 2 dredge was
added to reserve, which stood at £13,217 at
the end of the year. Arrangements have
been made for the sale of No. 2 dredge, and
a deposit has been paid. On April 30 the
directors believed that profitable work was
not yet possible, and dredging may not be
resumed this year. The loan of £14,233 to
Austral Malay has now been repaid. Singa-
pore Council stock and Government loan in-
vestments were £17,459 at the end of 1932.
Cash balances are £6166 and sundry debtors
stand at £4199.
Ulu Yam dredge was also idle, the quota
being transferred. This brought in £1220.
Expenditure was £2788, and the loss £1563.
compared with £2894 in 1931. An additional
£235 was written off assets. Chances of
resumption this year are remote. Cash
balances are £1179 and Singapore Council
investments £3360. Capital is £lOO,OOO.
Thabawleik, a Burmese property, had its
dredge idle during 1932, though it resumed
digging in April last. Alterations have made
the dredge capable of digging 120,000 yards
per month. The expected recovery during
the first 12 months of digging is expected to
be .81b. of 72 p.c. concentrates to the c.y.,
which should yield moderate profits at the
prices ruling on January 31. Expenditure
for 1932 was £5997. revenue £451, the loss
being £5546, increasing the debit to £11,937.
Liabilities at December 31 were £29.970.
Altering the dredge cost £2426. Paid capi-
tal is £160,000.
Puchong also sat on the splice dur-
ing the year, since working would have
meant only loss and wastage of ore reserves.
Expenditure was heavily cut, directors fore-
going fees and salaries being reduced. Total
expenditure was £5594, insurance, rents and
interest taking £3057. Revenue was £3198.
and the loss £2396, which was carried for-
ward. Sundry income not included in above
came to £74. which was written off develop-
ment account. Indebtedness at the end of
the year was £33.688. Paid capital is
£179,860.
Since installation of the new rock-breaker
and roasting furnace, Aberfoyle Tin (Tas.)
is milling 275 tons weekly, an increase of
75 tons. The magnetic separators are
recovering 5 tons of high-grade concen-
trates, 5 tons of seconds and 6cwt. of wol-
fram. The dump has been greatly reduced,
and the mine has now to produce full mill
requirements. With the narrow veins this
means extensive development work. As a
result of the rise in the price of tin, the
fully-paid pound shares have advanced from
16s. to 235. 6d. in the market over the last
three months.
* * * *
Mt. Morgan’s last four-weekly crushing
of /G5O tons averaged s.3dwt. gold and 0.57
p.c. copper. On the basis of a 75 p.c. re-
covery, this is equivalent to the estimated
grade of the 600,000-odd tons available on
the Linda level. The gold content is the
same as for the previous return, but the
copper assay has improved by 0.11 p.c. The
new fine-grinding Ruwolt ball mill and two
clasifiers, now complete, have lifted plant
capacity to 12,000 tons monthly. A jaw
breaker is being installed in the open cut to
handle large-size ore. With the jump in the
price of copper, the pound shares have
advanced from 31s. 6d. to 365. during the
last few weeks.

Golden Junction. Cracow, has taken an
option over the new Mt. Banya find at Mt
Perry (Q.). Geologist H. G. Reid, who has
bulk-sampled the property, reports lldwt.

than the full width. Shaft sinking and driv-
ing are in progress.

The tunnel on Golden Plateau (Q.) has
cut -.s?J od ™ channel earlier than anticipated
at 1010 ft. Ten feet of quartz assayed between
sdwt. and 12dwt., with lOdwt. stone in the
face. The tunnel, driven from the level of
the mill bins, cut the lode at a vertical
depth of 185 ft. from the surface. Ore
reserves, figured at 50,000 tons oil the lOOfr
level, will probably be added to as develop-
ment above the tunnel proceeds

The Queensland and Australian mine,
Kamerunga (Q.), which recently crushed 80
tons averaging Sdwt., has been optioned by a
Melbourne syndicate. The main shaft is
down 45ft. on a 4ft. reef.
* * * *
The Golden Treasure, formerly the Limon-
ite, on the old Gilberton goldfield (N.Q.),
has crushed 111 tons from the underlie for
91oz. of gold and 281 oz. of silver. In the
same district the Lucky Chance is on a 3ft.
6in. reef at 42ft., which bulks loz.; the
Fingerprint is extracting payable ore, and
at Mosquito Creek and Dinner Creek promis-
ing claims are being worked. Gilberton was
the scene of much activity in the early
’seventies.
* Ht * *
A recent crushing of eight tons from Mt.
Cassidy, near Rockhampton (Q.), yielded
740 z. of gold. The syndicate has three
shallow shafts down on the line of lode, but
they will have to be deepened and cross-
cutting and driving done to prove the show.
This, of course, means money; so efforts
are being made to interest a big mining cor-
poration in the proposition.

Lake View has made two unsuccessful
attempts to purchase the Boulder, but it
hasn’t abandoned hope. First offer of one
Lake View for three Boulder shares was re-
jected by the, Boulder board without com-
ment. The second offer of two Lake Views
for five Boulders and to allow the Boulder
Co. to retain cash and big tailings dump
was declined, (1) because of “favorable pros-
pects ahead of the Boulder mine, and (2)
because a fusion of interests wouldn’t be in
the best interests of Kalgoorlie, as it would
mean the employment of less men.” Boulder
lease separates the principal workings at
depth in the Lake View lease from the Lake
View Co.’s main shaft and treatment plant,
and its acquisition by the Lake View Co.
would effect substantial, economies in trans-
port and haulage costs.

Western Mining Corp. has been granted
large concessions in Westralia, embracing
several thousand square miles, stretching
from Southern Cross to the Kimberley.
Electrical prospecting, without preliminary
surveying, will commence at Southern Cross.
The co. has lodged £lO,OOO with the State
Government, and prospectors are to be per-
mitted to operate on the areas, provided
the co. is given the first option of purchase.
The subscribed capital of £lOO,OOO was pro-
vided by English and Australian groups.
Colin Fraser is chairman, and Vail, Hamil-
ton and Sutherland are on the board. The
co. proposes to make an aerial survey of
the whole area, followed by geological pros-
pecting in such likely spots as may be indi-
cated.

At Norseman (W.A.) the battery has been
completed; a 12,000-gallon water-storage
tank. has been installed, and grinding pans
are being erected. A winze is being sunk from

A number of rich patches have been struck
on Westralian goldfields lately. Frank’s
Reward led off with two from which a few
thousand pounds were extracted, and par-
ties of miners working their own claims
have followed suit with smaller yields at
Menzies, Broad Arrow, Yilgarn, Tuckanarra,
Mt. Monger and Ora Banda. Something
more than a rich patch has been exposed in
driving the 3320 ft. level of the Chaffers sec-
tion of Lake View and Star, the stuff broken
being heavily impregnated with telluride and
free gold. It is the downward continuation
of the shoot opened up in several levels

For a time arsenic was distressingly
troublesome as a skin irritant among em-
ployees at Victor Leggo’s Wiluna works
(W.A.). All sorts of precautions were
taken, the best, though not absolutely effec-
■ tive, being frequent baths and the wearing
of silk under-garments. Now arsenic-proof
change- and dining-rooms and an electric
precipitator, imported from England, have
been provided.

Individual prospectors on the Eastern
Goldfields (W.A.) still strike enrichments
equal to any in the past. Recently F.
Maffina got 184 oz. of gold from 18 tons of
stone at Mt. Monger, while T. Epis re-
covered 1650 z. from 51 tons at Menzies and
J. H. Argus averaged over 16oz. from 13
tons at Ora Banda.

Golden Key Gold (capital £5000) is de-
veloping leases three miles north of Kal-
goorlie (W.A.). Three shafts have been
sunk on a lode believed to be "the continua-
tion of the Golden Mile ore channel.”
Granites Development has taken an option
over the North Wiluna, which is three miles
north of Wiluna (W.A.) and on the strike
of the lode channel. The shaft is down
210 ft., and 10,000 tons of free milling ore,
averaging lOdwt., is said to' be awaiting
extraction when the mine is unwatered.

BRIEF ANSWERS.
W. J.R.: This is one of the cos. which, control the
Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances, and
shareholders’ prospects depend on results of the
operating co., for review of which see B. 8/2/’33.
. ...E.D.: It is probably worth while to continue
paying. You should get a fair run for your money,
anyway F.F.: See B. 15/2/’33 T.G.A.: (1)
Legally speaking, you are still liable, but we
have not yet heard of N.Z.P.F. suing for unpaid
balances. (2) Think you are quite safe in leaving
things as they are... .S.A.P.: Ord. shares might be
worth four or five shillings, but value depends on
soundness of t.-p. balances. .. .0.G.8.: Yes; it is
one of the best of the forestry propositions, though
speculative, of course.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
The Soviet Queers the Pitch
“Larrapinta”: Touching Maoriland’s loss
of its honey export market (B. 10/5/’33).
Australia and M.L. have the handicap of
landing their bee fruit on the British market
when the English winter is almost over, so
that much of it lias to be stored until next
winter. Buyers, therefore, have to allow
for the fact that it will be on their hands
for a long time. While Canadian competi-
tion is quite fair, Russian is decidedly un-
fair. A Soviet representative offered to sup-
ply a London buyer with honey of a grade
equal to M.L. any quantity up to 100
tons, at a lower figure. He explained that
peasants in honey-producing districts were
compelled to keep a stated number of hives,
but were not allowed to use honey, being-
given syrup made from watermelons for
their own needs. No country can compete
with that sort of thing. My brother-in-law
was marketing Australian honey in England
for 15 months, and this is only one of the
snags which he struck.
Unemployed Relief Work
“Kendall”: It is claimed that the unem-
ployed in N.S.W. now working on relief jobs
are more contented, and that their morale
has improved. They are more contented, but
the claim that their morale is stronger for the
system is far from certain. A too-subservient
working-class is a menace. Russia intro-
duced Communism by force, and sustains its
position very largely because its peasant
population is too downtrodden to kick at
anything. Let the N.S.W. Government accu-
rately explain what money an unemployed-
relief worker with a family averages per
week, and .side by side publish the amount
of food and clothing that such a sum will
buy, together with (say) medical opinion
that it is possible for a man to work hard
and his children to grow strong and healthy
011 . f° 0( l an< 3 clothing resulting from
relief jobs. All that anyone reading the
statement will then have to do is to ask him-
or herself a plain question, “Could I do it
personally?” He or she will have real
knowledge as to whether the claimed im-
provement in unemployed morale is a matter
warranting public applause.
The Charles Ruwolt Proprietary has been
given the important job of installing a new
milling and ore-treating plant for the Great
Boulder (W.A.). Six months ago the Vic.
co. was commissioned to design the plant,
subject to investigation of any other pro-
posals that might be submitted. Operations
to erect new machinery, plant and buildings
have now been sanctioned by the Great
Boulder board. On no previous occasion in
Australia has an Australian firm of con-
structing engineers been asked, not only to
construct and erect such machinery, but to
design the complete plant.
“Coa-ldust”: There are signs of improve-
ment in the Newcastle (N.S.W.) coal trade.
For the week ended May 27 the quantity of
cargo and bunkers shipped at the cranes was
72,000 tons, the highest weekly export for
two years. A consignment of 9350 tons for
Manila was included. But prices have been
cut to the bone in efforts to secure overseas
trade.
“S.T.S.”: The Ridley Memorial committee
in S.A., with Langdon Bonython at its head,
has finalised plans to commemorate the in-
vention of the Ridley reaper. An old claim
by the Bull family to prior invention is
revived, but the verdict of 1843 in Ridley’s
favor seems final. The memorial is to be
an entrance arch at the Agricultural
Society’s new showground at Wayville, which
Adelaide suburb was the scene of Ridley’s
first public demonstration.
“Tainornie”: Suspecting .some of my plan-
tation gang of tobacco-stealing, I tried a
trick I had once read about. Cutting nine
green sticks exactly the same length, and
retaining one, I gave one each to eight sus-
pects at knock-off time. I explained that
the stick held by the thief would increase in
length overnight by the width of a grass
knife, and that each man was to present his
piece for inspection in the morning. I was
made the goat! Each nig. had cut just
the amount mentioned from his stick, and
when I laid mine beside them it was the
longest.
“Wyara”: Many new and satisfactory
uses have been found for Queensland second-
ary timbers—orange boxwood for croquet
mallets; grey handlewood for hockey-sticks
and baseball bats: white handlewood for
lacrosse racquets ; brown tulip oak for golf
shafts; silver ash for tennis racquets, row-
ing oars, billiard cues, crutches and in boat-
building and cabinet-making; saffron heart
for fishing-rods. Red tulip oak and satinay,
which previously had no market, are now-
being used extensively for floorings, joinery,
mouldings, panelling and cabinet-making, and
rose mahogany is first-class for internal
moulding, printers’ blocks and furniture.
Corkwood is also being utilised in the con-
struction of aircraft.
“Cypress” : The Queensland Railway De-
partment, after numerous tests, is w'ell satis-
fied that in the power of holding nails —a
vital factor in buildings—and in durability
oregon pine is inferior to Queensland
hoop and bunya pines. Hoop pine is tougher
and will withstand greater shearing stress
with the grain. Oregon opens up freely in
the sun, showing long, deep cracks, and is
more easily split with the grain. Hoop pine
has a texture uniform and firm, whilst oregon
consists of alternate layers of hard and soft
wood. A good example of the durability of
Queensland southern kauri pine is shown
at the F'orestry Department, Brisbane, w-here
pine trusses supporting tons of seasoned
timber have been in use for nearly 70 years
and are still in perfect condition.
“Fur Felt”: Australia’s export of rabbits
for the nine months ended 31/3/’33 totalled
over nine million pairs, valued at over
£500,000. Quite a herd of people will
think this must be good business; but
what of the cost? How many millions more
sheep and cattle would the country carry
if _ the rabbits could be got rid of ? The
price of wool to-day demands at least a
50 per cent, reduction in the price of net-
ting. If the rabbit is to be regarded as an
asset, the destruction and waste of meat and
fur by the fumigators and poison should be
stopped. If he is a liability (and I think
he is) it should be made an offence to sell
either skin or carcase. As long as bunny
is looked upon as both an asset and a lia-
bility. the muddle will be hopeless.
“Adelaide”: The Myer concern’s competi-
tion in Rundle-street, Adelaide, has stirred
up local firms such as Birks and John Martin
to extensions and other activities. Now W.
H. Glasson has blown in and bought the
old Donaldson millinery store. He is known
for his association with Pellew and Moore,
of Broken Hill.
“Eilliab”: Traders at Mannahill (S.A.)
have discovered that a ton of jam is car-
ried by the railways from Mile End to
Olary, 257 miles from Adelaide, for £3, and
from Mile End to Mannahill, 234 miles, for
£4 3s. Id. It is cheaper by 9s. sd. a ton
to send the stuff 23 miles further, and have
it reconsigned from Olary, than to get it
trucked direct to Mannahill.
* * * *
“Eilliab”: Although few know it. Aus-
tralia supplies the U.K., M.L., Ceylon,
China, India and South Africa with maca-
roni, spaghetti and vermicelli. In 1930-31,
367,4011 b. was sent away; last year,
655,6631 b. Wheat is the base of the pro-
ducts, and it wouldn’t hurt us to eat more of
them. It would also help the cockies to
pay the storekeeper.
“Heresone”: Has any commodity been
christened oftener than golden syrup?
Sample a few: Treacle, molasses, Bunda-
berg honey, cocky’s (or bullocky’s) joy. bog,
tanglefoot, kanaka sweat. And I recall an
Indian hawker shuffling into a country store
kept by a Chinaman and asking for a tin of
streego. “Me no savee strecko,” said the
Chinese. Ilham Shirtail departed, only to
return with the right word—treacle. “All
li’,” smiled Ah Pong; “whaffor you no say
tleco first time?”
“C.Q.”: Probably the biggest slump in
prices, even during Depresh, has occurred
in Melbourne in connection with Bourke
parrots. A few months ago these were sold
at as much as £2O a pair, as they are pro-
tected in N.S.W. and arc supposed to be
rare. Then it turned out that they were
plentiful in S.A., which had no objection to
their decimation, and the price dropped to
25 bob.
“Bogaduek”: As one who does a lot of
range shooting I have nothing but praise for
the .303 rifle barrel made at the Lithgow
small arms factory (B. 24/5/’33), but why
don’t they also turn out the two other firearms
most called for by the shooting public, .22
rifles and 12-gauge shotguns? I recently
bought a Yankee .22 rifle, and had to pay £2
10s. Cartridges are also too dear. There
should be a handsome profit in making small-
bore rifles, guns and ammunition here. In
selected Tasmanian blackwood we have a
timber equal in every way to walnut for
stocks. The small-bore rifle and the shotgun
are still among our most useful aids to keep-
ing down foxes, crows, wedgetails and
rabbits.
“Bill Ding" : The Collier Government
(W.A.) has hearkened to the plea of the
timber industry for some reduction in rail-
way rates. The concession, which is on
export timber, mostly sleepers nowadays, is
16§ per cent, for 12 months from July 1
next, valued roughly at £20,000. If the
Government doesn’t get it back from the
sawmillers by the devious ways of taxes
and other charges foreign markets will, no
doubt, be explored again.
“M.G.”: Critics of hospital costs lose
sight of the important fact that every man
who is out of industrial action is not only a
financial as well as a physical sufferer him-
self, but an incubus to his relatives and a
direct loss to the community as a whole, in
that his productive power is lost. In
abnormal times, such as we are passing
through at present, the loss is not so serious",
for it is probable that, well and fit, he would
be unemployed; but in f.a.q. periods that
man’s labor is needed, and in or out of
hospital he is a charge on the community
just the same. To supply him with medical
attention so that he may speedily resume
his place in the ranks of production is good
business, to put it on the lowest ground.
“Valeria” : I should like to help the home
town, but I can’t afford to. An instance.
I wanted a hack sulky-spring. The local
price was 17s. 9d.; a Sydney firm supplied
the same thing, passenger freight paid, fo'r
Ss. 9d.
"Marsh”: Two years ago a fellmongery
was started in Winton (W.Q.). Drought con-
ditions killed thousands of sheep in the dis-
trict, and half- and full-woolled pelts would
have been allowed to rot but for the
proximity of the traders in skins. At present
three buyers are out, and the business is
working full time, although freight rates
and selling charges do not admit of out-
back graziers getting the benefit. There are
other Queensland districts where a fell-
mongering business would prosper, besides
being an asset to the graziers and others.
“Cairncross”: Tell “Gumblcgubbin” (B.
24/5/’33) that his discovery that English
farmers are using an electric goad for driv-
ing cattle and pigs to market is belated.
Swift’s meatworks on the Brisbane River
employed them for penning cattle years
ago, and when the State abattoirs took
over the use of the starter was continued.
The reason is that the slightest blow with
a whip or stick bruises the flesh of the
prime beasts under the skin. In these days
of cut-throat competition blemishes of the
sort make a big difference in the market.
* * * *
“Grump”: I wanted piccolo pads. “The
other counter,” I was told. The “other
counter” looked blank. “Aw, Mr. Brown;
piccolo pads,” she trilled to an un-
employed gent, patrolling the aisle. Mr.
Brown directed me “to the gentleman
beyond the steel door.” This gentleman
barked happily that piccolo pads were in
the department right through the shop,
down the right-of-way and three doors up
on the opposite side. There, a bright young
thing forwarded me to the lift with a wave
of a pencil. The liftman’s offsider led me
down a passage, and handed me over to a
bloque in shirtsleeves, • who produced the
pads. My quest was over. But was it?
With the package, I was handed to another
bloque, who wrote out a docket and referred
me to the cash-desk. Altogether it cost me
twelve interviews, a frayed temper and six-
pence ! Good business ?

Child’s Play
When Frith went to the Astor. Flats to
make sketches of boy-pianist Philip Har-
grave and his teacher, the Sundry Showman
was allowed to tail along, on the distinct
understanding that he was to behave himself
and not drive the lad silly with a lot of fool-
ish questions. They found the little chap
a bit shy, but the ice was soon broken. Frith
wanted the youngster at the keyboard, and
there he sat, like Patience on a monument,
not even smiling at Grief, till it suddenly
struck the Showman that to put that lad
in contact with a piano and not let him play
was refined torture. Would Philip play
some little thing for the visitors? Would he
not! The dark eyes brighten, the little figure
straightens, and from under ridiculously
small and pudgy fingers pours the swirling tor-
rent of' the Chopin “Fantaisie-Impromptu.”
Philip has left the Astor Flats, and Sydney,
and strange newspaper men and all the rest
of a world that doesn’t matter, and is happy
in his own kingdom. He’s no longer a child
of ten, but a master musician; one who
speaks on the ivory keys with authority. The
only digital difficulties that exist for him
are those involved in making small hands
and slender arms do work devised for iron-
willed and steel-muscled adults. This he
manages so deftly that his handicap is hardly
noticeable. Phrasing, expression, accent and
touch are, apparently, instinctive. The effect
is as if Paderewski were Svengali and were
to exercise his 50 years of musical experi-
ence through this immature medium.
Philip plays on, lie’s in the most ornate
variation of Schubert’s B Flat Impromptu.
The left hand is performing intricate figures,
and just precisely at those points where
Paderewski punctuates and emphasises the
movement by flinging up his head (getting
his mop of hair out of his eyes) so does
this Australian youngster, who never saw
the Pole in action, and whose sleek hair
doesn’t intrude. It’s uncanny.
From what Miss Garnaut, Philip’s teacher
and guardian, says, the boy has no trouble,
in memorising. He had the “Moonlight”
note-perfect in a fortnight. Bach’s “Well-
tempered Clavier” fugues stick after two or
three readings.
The Showman was permitted to gently
cross-examine the little witness. Which com-
poser did he like best? “Bach!” (this with
immense solemnity and conviction). Just
think of it! A lad of ten preferring the
daddy of all the composers, the great master
of musical mathematics, appreciated by most
of us, if appreciated at all, late in life, after
we’ve got tired of sugar-candy. “And after
Bach?” The expected reply was “Beet-
hoven,” but it wasn’t. Schubert is next in
rank, and that’s another preference that will
stand pondering over. It’s a very mature
judgment.
The Meaning of Music
“Criticaster,” who wrote on this page last
week, asks, when it’s all boiled down, “Wliat’s
the meaning of music?” Also he complains
that there isn’t an “sesthetic” of it. “yEsthe-
tics,” as far as I can gather, is a term
meaning “reasons why human beings like
some things and don’t like others.” At the
end of a long corridor that few have tra-
versed you’ll find the answer: “Because some
things are good for ’em and some are not.”
But kids like green plums, that give them
colic and kill them, so you have to go along
a further long corridor that fewer still have
explored, and at the end you find the answer,
“There’s no accounting for tastes.”
As to music, you can’t make a rational
science out of its physical basis. The vibra-
tions of the notes in an octave are in the
ratio 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48. They
aren’t in geometrical or arithmetical progres-
sion. When you’ve stuffed five half-notes in
among them to fill up the more yawning
gaps, Ike Newton himself couldn’t find a
law for them. Someone almost as great as
Newton, J. B. Bach, after contemplating the
Philip Hargrave.
irrational muddle for half a lifetime, decided
that the only thing to do. if harmony were
to have an intelligent and practicable basis
so far as keyed instruments are concerned,
was to put every one of the intermediate
notes between keynote and octave wrong.
At some stages the error is a whole
twelfth of an octave out. Only one person
in a million realises that all is not as it
should be. Bach put. a halter on the wild,
untamable, erratic scientific soul of .music,
and only a few singers and violinists in any
generation now retain a sense for that won-
derful chord the perfect triad. The most
sensitive users of the keyed instruments, the
vibrations of their notes ready-made for
them, and made wrong, are only dimly con-
scious that something is lacking.
“Criticaster” applies the canons of graphic
art to music. He talks of copying a paint-
ing. Copying a painting, as any well-trained
art student knows, isn’t an easy job. You
have to know almost as much about “tech-
nique” as the original painter did. “Tech-
nique” is a makeshift term, but all devotees
of the fine arts understand it as meaning
what honest building denotes in connection
with architecture. The architect puts his
T-square against the edge of his drawing-
board, and with one swift slash of his pencil
indicates a vertical or a horizontal. You
have to learn brick-laying, or masonry, or
carpentry before you can translate that into
a right line in a building. And so you have
to learn, in painting, how to reproduce the
tones, the tints and such subtleties as
“chiaroscuro” and “atmosphere” before you
can copy correctly. But when your copy
is finished and your master stands behind
your stool and squints at the result, he’ll
tell you that here, and there, and in that
essential, you aren’t yet Rembrandt. You
might retort, if you are unwise, that you
never can be, because there was only one
Rembrandt.
Now then, let’s leave the painter’s atelier
and go to the room in a conservatorium
where there are a maestro, a student and a
pianoforte. The student is endeavoring to
copy, let us say, the “Moonlight Sonata.”
He has no copy before him. He works from a
mental image. Why? Well, Beethoven, working
in a less straightforward medium than pig-
ments, brushes and canvas, had to give a
sort of shorthand sketch of his great picture.
Ruling the area off into squares, he sub-
divided each square into 128 smaller ones
(on some canvases he even split the divi-
sions into 256). In each square he put a
dot. Over some of the squares he put a
brief word of advice as to the color. So far
as Beethoven was concerned, the student
has had very little clue as to what the out-
line, when it is all joined up, ought to repre-
sent. There are legends, but the maestro —
if he is honest—will admit that they are
not at all well authenticated.
The maestro and other maestros may have
shown the student what he or they thought
A musical prodigy in action.
the picture ought to look like. The maestro
(this is a rather jealously-guarded trade
secret) is wondering how much his pupil
can get out of it, and is quite prepared to
learn something new about the tones or out-
line of the picture. About the “copying” of
this particular chart, there are three pic-
tures from the past that may interest “Criti-
caster.” The first is of Beethoven himsdf,
old, deaf, bitter, infuriated, endeavoring to
play the thing. Crouching his leonine head
over the notes in a vain endeavor to hear
something, his fingers go through motions
long familiar, but the sounds that issue are
grotesque. The soft passages are inaudible
—the hammers do not hit the strings. In
the fortissimos of the rushing wind that swirls
through the final movement all music is dead-
ened in the strings by insensate hammering.
The mind is there; the finger “technique” is
there; but the ear has gone. Next picture:
Rubinstein in his prime. Before a crowded
audience in one of the greatest cities . of
Europe he plays the celebrated composition,
and all there swear it has never been so per-
formed before. Rubinstein is master of the
crescendo and diminuendo. He has divided
the gradations of volume, marked in the
works of the masters pp, p, pf, mf, f, ff, into
2S, and he can play four octaves up or down
with a progressive difference in volume in
each note. He dramatises every key he
touches, and hypnotises his audiences. The
fact that he sometimes hits the wrong note
is hardly ever noticed. Last picture: An
erstwhile pupil of Liszt, who had heard
Rubinstein play the “Moonlight” that night,
speaks enthusiastically about the great musi-
cal experience he had enjoyed. The old
“Abbe” bristles, subtly, catlike. “I never
play it now,” he says. “I am getting too
old. But I will show you how it should be
played.” And in gathering twilight the old
man gives the picture such an outline, such
color, such miraculous, undreamt-of deli-
cacies of significance, that his listener says
afterwards, sadly, “It was not playing at
all: it was sheer magic.”
So, “Criticaster,” I' gather, both from
such incidents as these and from my own
experience, that whereas it is possible, to
make only one sort of good copy of a paint-
ing it is possible to give as many interpre-
tations of a musical composition as there
are recipes for tribal lays. I doubt that
Paderewski played the “Appassionata” in-
dignantly because he resented its presence on
his programme. A perfectly reasonable way
in which to consider it is to suppose, as
some literalists say, that it represents the
beating of great waves, upon a rock-bound
coast. Translate that into the language of
the soul —a fight against fate; a complaint,
if we must be erotic, that our lady is un-
kind, or, since the composer himself entitled
one of his finest and most dramatic rondos
“Rage Over a Lost Penny,” irritation about
things in general. The meaning of music is
what you can make of it, and you can’t
make much of it without the gifts of “tone”
and “ear.” These are essential to an execu-
tant, and you’re either born with them or
you lack them all your life. As to com-
posers and infant prodigies, they’re large
subjects in themselves.
A. Major.
At the Town Hall on Saturday night the
10-year-old pianist Philip Hargrave cap-
tured Sydney as easily as he had conquered
Adelaide and Melbourne. The small white
figure at the large black piano would have
been assured of friendly sympathy and gener-
ous applause had lie merely managed to
scramble through the notes of the famous
compositions that figured on his programme.
But he didn’t have to rely on his extreme
youth. Before he was half-way through his
first Bach fugue the audience realised that
it was listening to a virtuoso in Dryden’s
sense of the term—“a lover of a noble art
and a critic in it.” To play Bach as intelli-
gently as this youngster does involves a high
degree of musicianship—it isn’t the sort of
th’ing that can be done by parrot-rOte. His
critical intuition was also demonstrated in
the Beethoven “Andante Favor!” and in the
rondo which Ludwig in one of his whimsical
moments dubbed “Rage Over a Lost Penny.”
Schubert was represented by two of the best-
known melodies —the B Flat Impromptu with
its rich variations, and the graceful sad little
dance from the “Moments Musical.” Chopin’s
“Fantasie-Impromptu” and “Minute Waltz”
offered further contrasts in pianistic style.
Among encore numbers was Czerny’s “Chro-
matic Study.” In all these varying moods
and styles of pianism, the boy was at home
and at his ease. How hands so small can
produce rapid octave passages of bell-like
clearness and negotiate the Chopinesque
arpeggios with such creamy smoothness are
minor mysteries. The major miracle of this,
as of other musical prodigies, is the posses-
sion of an instinctive comprehension of musi-
cal idioms.
A subsidiary feature of an extraordinarily
interesting recital was the singing of John
Dudley, a sweet tenor with a nice repertoire.

In Ernest C. Rolls’s revue, “Honi Soit,”
at Sydney Royal, tape, a bit of muslin
and beads constitute most of the costumes
worn by the dancing girls in some of the
scenes. Rene Riano is the most inter-
esting of the performers. She has a
keen sense of the ridiculous, and is at her
best when prancing about the stage in a
series of grotesque shapes. She has able
helpers in Charles Norman and Chic
Arnold. Among the songbirds are Byrl
Walkley, equally at home in the “Garden of
Romance” and '“Say It Isn’t So”; vivacious
Ray Fisher, who knows how to emphasise
a melody, and the quartette (Alice Wells,
Marie Doran, Thelina Trott and Kathleen
Crotty) who provide the charm of “A
Musical Melange.” Male songsters worth
mention are Colin Crane, Jack O’Hagan and
Charles King. On the opening night the
ballet was frequently out of step, but the rest
of the dancing in the show was of a high
order.

In “London Wall,” presented by Doris
Fitton’s Independent Theatre co. at Sydney
Savoy, the author, John van Druten. vents
his dislike of women in business. He pre-
sents a picture of a London solicitor’s office
over a period of three weeks. The women
outnumber the men. Miss Janus (Jean
Lawson) is old-maidish, capable and in love
with a Dutchman who does not return her
affection: Miss Hopper (Estelle Macken) is
insolent but trustworthy, and attached to a
married man; Miss Button (Joyce Smith)
is affected and lazy: Miss. Milligan (Lor-
raine Smith) is young and innocent and the
idol of Hec Hammond (Allan Davis), a shy
and righteous youth from a neighboring
office. Miss Milligan’s beauty and simpli-
city attract Eric Brewer (Clarence Murphy),
who likes them in their teens. He oversteps
the mark, presses unwelcome attentions on
the girl in the office after hours, is caught
by his employer, Mr. Walker (Alfred Race),
and sacked. In the meantime Miss Janus
is jilted by the Dutchman and hands in
her resignation; Miss Hopper snares her

The Paul Johnstone Players, an offshoot
of the New Sydney Rep. Soc., had their first
show at the Emerson Hall on Thursday
night, when a three-act domestic comedy,
“Harmony at Home,” was well done. Yvonne
Cahill distinguished herself as the young
lady in whom the thing centres. Harry
Farrel did best as her harassed father.

Adelaide Repertory, for its second play
of the season, went to the always reliable
Van Druten. “After All” is a lesson in
tolerance. Each younger generation seems
headstrong and unreasonable to its elders,
but will with increasing years settle down —
after a false step or two —into domesticity.
In particular, the married-man lover, heard
of and dreaded so much, proves to be quite
a good chap when allowed into the family.
It is true Repertory work, with no hero and
no villain, and every side, fairly stated; and
the sound all-round acting was just the
treatment needed.
The Palette.
Ethel Carrick’s art, as revealed at Every-
man’s, Collins-street, is a testimonial to the
influence of her late husband, E. Phillips
Fox. Fox specialised in the elucidation of
the problem of sunlight falling through the
leaves of trees. He generally arranged that
the sunlight should fall on attractive-looking
females in the altogether or clad in flimsy
muslins and protecting their complexions
with gay parasols. Mrs. Fox elaborates on
the same theme, but strips.it of the romance
demanded by the generation to whom her
husband appealed. Her brush reads the Riot
Act, so to speak, to the chaos of color pre-
sented by fish and flower markets in Paris
and Nice and in half a dozen of the can-
vases reads it with considerable success. The
18 pictures in tempera are not so satisfying.
Tempera painting is an artistic Back-to-the-
Horse movement. It is 500 years or so
since the Van Eycks placed the better
medium of oil in the painter’s hands.
Hal Gye’s monotypes at Melbourne Fine
Arts were produced by painting on glass or
metal and then transferring the paint to
paper under pressure. The frivolous charge
has been brought against The Bulletin
caricaturist that the results are bad because
they don’t look like monotypes, but dis-
criminating art-lovers will be satisfied if
they look like something in Nature. Gye,
howmver, disarms criticism on the latter
score by describing his work as decorative
landscapes. In this category he often
attains a high order of merit, but there are
also half a dozen efforts which suggest con-
siderable observation of the elusive light or
evening on dim waters and amidst tall
timber. The flower pieces are less pleasing.
Anybody who wants a rapid inventory of
the passions and prejudices that have re-
cently torn Germany can do worse than
inspect the posters at Kurrajong House,
Coll ins-street, Melbourne, collected in Ger-
many by F. Alexander, M.A., lecturer in
modern history at Perth Uni. and an Aus-
tralian representative at the League ot
Nations. Explanations by Alexander help
to make the situation clearer, or rather,
reveal the degree of mental chaos in which
poor Hans has been engulfed by his various
masters. The ferocity of these pictorial
appeals to mass emotion makes the efforts of
the Sydney cartoonists in the recent referen-
dum campaign look like polite variants of
Mr. Clapp’s “Eat More Fruit” series. After
an exclusive course of Social-Democratic
party posters, in which Herr Hitler is repre-
sented as wearing a crown on whose spikes
writhes the body of poor Hans lnmself, it
is understandable that Hans would want to
drink the hlood of a few Nazis, after having
grilled their babies over the fire of patriotic
indignation. A course of Nazi posters show-
ing Hans being crucified .on the bocial-
Democratic cross, would similarly make Hans
feel that if he didn’t scalp a dozen bocial-
Democrats, Jews and Communists before
breakfast the Fatherland would fall to pieces.
To add to the confusion, there are the Hugen-
berg-Nationalist efforts depicting Hans being
chased down the path to Hell ,by the Ver-
sailles treaty. The note of dignity struck
by the Centre party posters is in sharp
contrast to the others. No wonder poor
frightened ITans felt mad and wanted to
hurt somebody. By accident, there was a
print of a famous picture by Rubens lean-
ing against the wall at the Kurrajong House
show. It looked as out of place as a philo-
sopher in a lunatic asylum.

ABORIGINALITIES
“J. 8.”: Part of my unmusical activities
is to keep Gum Tree Junction in the latest
gramophone dance music, or “toons,” as
Dave calls them. Far outback the gram,
seems to have put the accordion and con-
certina out of business on darnce nights.
At Gum Tree, when I was in residence
there, a piano had been subscribed for, but
nobody within a rideable radius could
play it after the rouseabout at Casey’s pub
was sacked, and even the threat of a beer
strike would not make Casey back his cart.
So w r e jigged it again to a lively concertina.
THE BACKWARD YEARLING.
BOLLOCKY BILL: “Meanter say yer nipper can’t WAKL yet! Gripes, if he’d bin born a
cattle pup ’e’d be heelin’ bullicks by this!”
The grandest dance we ever had was the
night of Rosie’s wedding. It was decided
• tbqt ,w„e must, have a pianist, and a “pro-
fessor” came up by coach under “special
engagement.” The prof, could make the
piano feed out of a plate: yet nobody seemed
to be enjoying the dance music. The girls
insisted that Joe’s concertina should set
the pace. As none of the lads liked to call
off the professor, it was decided to enter-
tain him regardless of expense in the “com-
mittee-room.” Unfortunately, he was such
a conscientious practitioner that he would
not be kept from his job, so Dave had to
‘give him, the office,” with apologies and
the promise of a moke to take back to town
with him. ,
Dai R. ’: It is well known to buslimen
ot: the plains country that a man lying on
his back and waving his legs in the air
wall attract an emu, that being the way the
birds die. Curiosity or maybe a desire to
offer comfort [brings, up the stranger, and
Binghi, assuming the posture, secured easy
meat when other fare was unavailable.
Dan Kelly, of Brewarrina (N.S.W.), oner
staged»'the lure and,grabbed the investigating
fowl by, ■ a leg, but was promptly kicked into
the middle of next election. He left hospiti,
with only one eye.
“11. W.” : Two Grain Tom must have read
how Nero fiddled While his city burned and
m a humble way sought to erhulate him.
Tom wias:,distinctly out of favor as a camp
mate owin'g to • his careless use of fire.
Before lie retired at night, he would build
a large log fire in his flimsy wooden chim-
ney. • Thdn he would play on his beloved
violin. I was awakened one night by my
mate, \yho said then was a big blaze' close
at hand. “It’s old Two Grain having an-
other/bonfire,” he remarked as we hurried
on our clothes. As we came nearer the
llames wo. were,-relieved to hear the wailing
of a violin. Bursting through the dense
scrub into the clearing we beheld Tom seated
on a stump, fiddling away' for dear life,
clad only, m lus shirt, plus his hair and whis-
kers, which were badly singed. He had lost in
the fire about two months’ tucker and bo-
3O and 40 quid, besides camp gear.
'But,' he said thankfully, “this time I
saved my, fiddle. The other couple of times
I was burnt out I lost one in each fire.
So I never keep this one in the hut at night:
I always leave it outside under a sheet of
bark, ' As the roof of the shanty fell in
with a crash lie dashed off into the open-
ing bars of “Keep the Heme Fires Burning.”
“J.11.N.” : A squatter driving to the Rock-
hampton (Q.) races from outback was
accompanied by an abo. offsider, to whom lie
confided that if he had a substantial win
he would buy an aeroplane. “All right.
Boss,” said Jacky, “and then you get new
boy. No good to this feller when wo are
up in the air and you say, ‘Hop out, Jacky,
and crank her up.’ ”

What we cats have
always been demanding
from a heedless world'is
bigger, better and less
suspicious mice. Wheat-
growers and other sor-
did souls have said us
nay. Well, . listen to
'this, which is from that’
pillar of Empire the
‘‘Daily Mail.” In St.
Albans (Eng.) there
lives a widow, Mrs. E.
D. Blowers. Up till five
years ago she led the
normal life of an Eng-
lish lady, looking after
her small son and two
daughters. Small son
bought two white mice,
a “pigeon pair,” as we
cats say, and these dear
little creatures increas-
ed and multiplied. Mrs.
Blowers was at her wit’s
end where to put them
all, and she finally
sacked the chauffeur
and his wife and turned-
tlreir cottage into a
to ice r y. Then Mrs.
Blowers became secre-
tary of the National
Mouse Club of Great
Britain, and started
stocking up her house
with (in addition to
mice) trophies. By the
rime her mice-herd num-
bered 5000 she had so
many cups and ribbons
that she couldn’t keep
track of ’em. For,
strange to say, by some
stroke of pure Men-
delian luck her original

cinnamon, champagne, lilac and fawn, and
several had spots. Those with spots
both sides of the nose are eagerly sought
after by mouse-fanciers, and bring as much
as £lO. But. of course, they have to be
well looked after. Mrs. Blowers feeds ’em
on cod-liver oil, oats and canary seed. Just
before a show she adds to the diet a little
linseed oil. to give, a sheen to the fur. There’s
a eat in Mrs. Blowers’s house, but the “Daily
Mail” says he" doesn’t care for mice. I
don’t .wonder at it. I suppose, like the
young man who was sick of the palsy, lie’s
sick of it.. ,

“Moondyne”: Do elephants lie down?

Once when Sell’s circus was pitched at
Goulburn (N.S.W.) a i cobber and I were
taking each other home. Making a short
cut over the paddock, the other bloke fell
over one of the circus leviathans, which was
sprawled out on the ground. As it slowly
arose, you should have seen the look of
bewilderment on my pal’s face. He ex(hie) -
plained all the way home that it was the
biggest cow that he had ever seen.

“Wiremu” : After scrambling all day over
the rocky bluffs that constituted Hoani’s
ancestral domain, I discoursed at length
on the foolishness of the Maori, who. when
lie could have chosen nice flats and easy
slopes, had preferred to make his home on
such useless rocks. “Yes, Wiremu,” said
Hoani, “but when the Maori retained this
land from the palceha. purchase he knew
nothing of sheep and cow. His food was
the ktiku and kopukopu [mussels], the pupu
and pipi [cockles] and the fish of the sea.
Ho cast his line off the flat land and only
caught the pahuhu [small bony fish called
a spotty]. No good, so he went to the deep
water by the rocks, where he caught the
big pakirikiri [cod] and hapuku [groper].”
To-day Hoani can give a few points to
the pakelia as far as the land is concerned,
and at billiards he can give him 20 in 100.

“Heresone”: Let me defend the Too-
woomba (Q.) City Council against “Boora-
booriong’s” charges (B. 10/5/’33). Mount
Lofty may have had an abo. name, but it
was always called Tick Hill in the old days.
And Ivatoomba, originally the name of a pro-
perty on the quarry hill, has ousted the old
name by a process of survival of the fittest.
Abo. names may have their points, but some
are awkward mouthfuls. As for Brisbane
taking the poinsettia as her emblem, she
has as much claim to it as England has to
the rose or S’Africa to' the golden wattle.

“Pastoralists don’t fear the Alsatian so much as

O shepherd dog from far Alsace,
Or wolfhound grim from old Lorraine,
If you would fill a canine place
Of honor in this new demesne
And wipe awmy the murky stain
Your chequered scutcheon presents,
The first essential’s to refrain
From amorous entanglements.
With such a winning form and face,
A mien so proud, you might disdain
Descending to mesalliance base
IVith wildings of the weald and plain.
But there be lapses breed nor brain
Nor ancient lineage prevents.
’Ware, wolfdog, lest they prove your bane,
These ages-old entanglements!
Bet charmers of the open space
. Send vamping love-calls out in vain !
For slaughter only should you chase
The low and loathly dingo strain.
Your web’s-at best a tangled skein ;
The case against you you’ll augment
If sour detractors find you fain
Of amorous entanglement.
Sheepdog or wolfhound, each or twain,
Bone of contention and dissent,
Keep clear, if here you would remain,
Of old-as-sin entanglement.

LIFE—A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it'
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

“Roga”: The most satisfactory way to
estimate the, height of a tree, provided the
darned thing is fairly straight, is to place
in the ground an upright stick of any size
and measure its height, the length of its,
shadow and then the length of the shadow
cast by the tree. All one has to do now. is,
divide the length of the stick’s shadow into
the length of the tree’s shadow, and multiply
the result by the height of the stick. A
more simple method is suggested by Ecclesi-
astes, son of David. “If the ’ tree fall
towards the south, or towards the north,”
he says, “in the place where the tree falleth
there shall it be.” Then you can measure
it off with a foot-rule, allowing 36in. to
the yard. -

“Bill O’C.”: My statement that discarded
burning cigarette ends account for many
house and grass fires rouses “The 0.D.” (B.
17/5/’33) to “challenge and defy” anyone
to go irtfo a paddock of dry grass and start
a fire by throwing in fags. “The 0.D.” is
possibly one of those who have so experi-

mented, with a negative result, but such
evidence is valueless. There is plenty of
good evidence that smouldering butts do
cause fires, both in and out of doors. It
isn t so much a matter of dryness and heat,
as of the nidus in which the fag comes to
rest This isn’t always just “dry grass”
(which, by the way, varies immensely in its
inflammability) ; it, is quite likely to be
■ resinous dry gum-leaves, shredded bark, seed
fluff, dry dung, a decaying post, or some-
thing else liable to smoulder. A hot wind
does the rest. With a sun at 110 in the
shade, a glowing cigarette and a northerly
brickfielder,” I believe I could start more
fires than a hundred “O.D.’s” could put out.
How is it that fags cause so many authentic-
ally traced fires in houses? Simply by
smouldering .and starting pine floors and
furniture doing the same thing, until a
draught of air, puts in its work. One
might throw fags about the floors and fur-
niture (as so many barbarians do) for a
month without setting a blaze • going; but
that’s no proof that it's absolutely impossible.

“Plankton”: Gigantic shells of the tulip-
snail ( Megalatractu-s aruanus ), which is
found off the coast of North Westralia,
sometimes attain a length of 2ft. The life-his-
tory of the species of the order Strcptoncura
is of peculiar interest. The ' larva on emerg-
ing from the egg is a somewhat spherical
form of minute size, with a central band
of movable swimming-hairs (or cilia), by
means of which it propels itself through the
water. At a later stage these hgirs are
replaced for a time by a kind of contract-
ible skirt until the ~ creature attains its
final stage, when it forms a shell and be-
comes a small replica of its parents. The
larva, at first a symmetrical form, changes.
As it grows, the posterior end curves up-
wards towards the head-end. and the in-
curved part twists completely over itself
so as to loop the food-canal into a figure
eight. This-results in a.tendency to sup-
press the'Organs of the left side, while those
originally on the right ■ arc finally placed
on the left.

“Murrungurry”: Recently a blacktracker
trailed an aged woman named Mrs. Annie
Crawford for nearly a week. She left her
home near Canally station, on the Murrum-
bidgee, for Balranald, but got lost, and
wandered aimlessly in dense mallee and
spinifex country. Hundreds of people had
been searching for four days before the
trackers were put to work. They were led
by .Jacky Shields, who is 65 years old. The
tracks he picked up were not discernible ’
to the white men even when they had been
pointed out. After following them for 35
miles .Tacky came upon a billycan which the
old lady had carried; and here and there
later he showed the police bits of mallee
leaves that she had sucked. When night
fell they camped on the track, and at dawn
.Tacky discovered the body. Apparently she
had died early the previous day.
WAYS OF PROVIDENCE.
MINISTER: “For every single thing you give away two will be returned unto you.”
GLUMM : “That’s right. Two months ago I give the daughter away. Now , blarst
me if she an’ her bloke ain’t livin’ with me.”
“Titre”: The Director of Sugar Experi-
ment Stations told an interviewer the other
day that it was 85 years since
the carie was first grown in
Bananaland, the site being the
Brisbane Botanic Gardens.
The , first sugar made in
Queensland was taken from
these canes,' the yield being
about Gib. After that sugar
was freely grown round Bris-
bane for years, and not. so
long ago land now., covered
with flourishing suburbs still
showed the traces "of the
broad., ridge and furrow that
marked ithas an old sugar plan-
tation. Most; of the ..early
cane came from Mauritius, Thu
later Papua supplied many
varieties, one of them being the?
Badila, still the chief variety
grown in the North. ’ i
“Teraki”: The only remnant of Maoris
I know who retain any of the old crafts!
are the few half-castes on Stewart Island.’
They split the fronds of the giant kelp; to
make bags for preserving mutton-birds,
weave the: basket-containers, from mainland
flax and protect ,the' package with strips
of manuka bark. The process is as truly
Maori as it was -100 vears ago. * Generally,
Hori’s attitude to most of the crafts' 'of’ his
forebears is one of indifference. The present
generation has never learned to build a !
raupo ic.hare (hut), weave a flaxen piu-piu
(waist-mat) or sculpture a piece of poua-
namu (greenstone). In Rotorua,, an occa-
sional carver from the night classes of a
pakeha technical school tortures pieces of
wood with chisel and hammer, and passes
his wares over to a white-haired, tattooed
°-d battler for sale to tourists' who don’t
know any better. The most primitive of
the Maoris of Urewcra (N. 1.) have -dis-
carded. their old fishing gear;'and instead of,
a paua shell-spinner for Icahawai: they now
use a polished teaspoon on; a gut line.A
nasty eye'from one of the dancing girls is
the only answer to a query whether she
made the, :poi ball ;with' her' own ”brown
hands, and the leader of the' Italia- will admit •'
that his taiaha (.spear) " was made iin Ger-
many or Japan.

“C. Coral”: The presence of a fleet of
Papuan canoes, working trochus, etc., alone
the Wappa reefs, in Torres Strait, agitated
some of the island boats the other das'.
The visitors were politely told that they
were free to catch lcai-lcai fish, but not to g<>
after the marine deposits. With Japanese
sampans lately working the trochus beds in
Torres Strait, and New Guinea canoes also
prospecting, it looks as though the old ques-
tion of ownership and rights will crop up
again. Queensland claims rights over every-
thing within three miles of land whether
mainland or island, and contends that a reef
is land if any part of it is exposed-at low
■ tide. There are, of course, passages through
the Strait which would be considered inter-
national waters, but, like other vexed
.questions concerning parts of the Barrier,
some express definitions seem to be required.
“Mundowie”: Wandering Chinese are
often met on lonely West Queensland tracks.
They carry-the swag from a jonjkin, or bam-
boo, across the shoulder, with the clothes
and blankets dangling from one end -'of it,
the tucker and campware from the o’ther.
Some are looking for a job-—boundary-rid-
ing, cooking or- gardening; some arc going
from., one., Chow centre to another, Jo' be
placed eventually byltheir compatriots. A good
many; are miners and fossickers. All sorts
of mysteries are-carried in their swags, in-.,
eluding Chinese medicine. Formerly, when :
the /sleuths were not,.so watchful as now.
opium distributors were common on ‘the
track. I was, spelling, horses for a . week or
so in a wallaby hunter’s camp on the. Mara-
noa. His! workers were blacks, and, their
pay was principally tucker and opium, or
opium charcoal. A Chinese swaggie brought
the opium.
“Barangkali” : Off Cocos, some years ago,
the Narkunda dropped us a barrel of fresh,
foodstuffs. After' picking it up I slipped
a trolling line over the stern of our boat
as, we were., running back, to the - lagoon.
Near the entrance I got hooked into a !4ft. ;
shark. I opened his cupboard on the,beach.
Tucked, away amongst octopus and fish was
a thrc'e-weeks-old Bulletin. The paper
had been’'swallowed shortly before I bad
hooked him; for it was in quite con-,
dition .and easily readable. Apparently
it had been blown off the decks and the
red cover bad been the attraction for
the shark. We get four mails a year down
there, and in the ordinary course of events
that particular copy of The Bulletin
would not have reached me for another three
months or so.

THE MOVIE CKITIC DOES A
PINK TEA.
Mrs. Ida Mullet’s first Pink Tea of the
season transpired at Wobbegpng. Snail’s
Bay. We find, on
reference to our
archives, that Sydney
consumed its first
Pink Tea as far back
as Jan., 1892, when
Mrs. Biles-Glupp. of
Ashfield, whose then
home was on the site
at present occupied
by Messrs. Bone am'
Bone, Quantity Ser-
ve yor s, gave one
which is still talked
of zestfully by mem-
bers of the Older
Set. Thereafter, Pink
Teas were tendered at increasingly short in-
tervals at Turraraurra (largely virgin bush
at the time) ; Coogee (still to acquire its
famous pier and shark-proof fence) ; Bondi
(Aug., 1899). and Vaucluse (May, 1902).
A Mrs. Blobsbn gave a Grey Tea at Wylde-
street, Potts Point, in 1907, and the police
records show that a Blue Tea was staged
at a subsequently disqualified guest-house in
Darli’nghurst the following year. The Hon.
Mrs. Harridan arrived from London in 1912.
and talked of entertaining Sydney Society
at a Black Tea, but nothing seems to have
come of it. After the World War Pink Teas
resumed their sw r ay, and they are now all —
if one maybe permitted an expressive vul-
garism—the go.
A regrettable feature of the function at
Wobbegong was the cocktail bar impro-
vised in the wash-house by Mr. Alf. Mullet.
Inevitably a number of the guests gravitated
towards the so-called attraction; and there
was a stage, one grieves to confess, when the
defections from the drawing-room, in which
Madame de Grone was rendering delicious
selections from Debussy, amounted to a
moiety of the Mullets’ social circle. Mr.
Bloober (chartered accountant), Mr. Losh
(solicitor) and Mr. Wangleford (house-
agent) were conspicuous alike, as consumers
and as distributors. For
such innovations wo must,
of course, thank Hollywood.
No cocktails mar the classic
simplicity of life in Omsk
and Tomsk, where a caller
is lucky to get a chunk of
black bread and a mug of
quite possibly cholera-in-
fected water while he in-
spects the naif and lovely art
of such masters as Ug the
Self-taught. The same in
the cultural stratospheres of
and Albania.
The pink of Mrs. Mullet’s
pelisse—if such it was —
blended ill with the red and
purple of her skirt; and in
the decor of her tables —-
gamboge stars and salmon-
pink stripes—we were again
distressed by the malign
American motif. Why not
have struck an English, an
Empire note, with tablecloths
and serviettes of red, white and blue?
The tea might advantageously have been
stronger, the cocktails —one animadverts
again on the uproar which proceeded from
the wash-house as the afternoon wore on—
weaker.
The milk was beyond cavil.

PACIFISM IN THE DOG WORLD.
At a meeting of the Canine Trace Society

action against Alsatians was carried unani-

IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE.
At the opening of the 50tli annual ,World
Disarmament Conference complimentary
reference was made to the presence of Mr.
X. Ckyqzonk, centenarian delegate from Lap-
land, who recalled that he had attended the
first conference in 1932. As a life hobby, he
said, disarmament conferences beat stamps
hollow.
Proceedings were unfortunately interrupted
by a series of bomb explosions organised by
the League of Pacifists. After the Pacifists
had been suitably dealt with Mr. McFoozle
(Britain) said that he stood for fair fight-
" An Australian Delegate : “What about

Mr. McFoozle : “Cad !”
A better spirit prevailed when conference
considered a motion by the Jamaican dele-
gate that the world standard of all army
rum be fixed at 300 per cent. O.P. It was
carried unanimously.
Conference then adjourned to view the latest
films of the Test struggle between General
Ito’s side and that of the War Lord Li-Chi
in Central Mongolia. An M.C.C. represen-
tative was present to decide whether the
17,000 casualties among Li-Chi's team were
attributable to bodylining, bombs or
bayonets.

LEGAL MUTILATIONS.
“Judge Curlewis said that he had never heard of
a man suffering physical harm through attending
court.”
Yet I know a man who went into court,
and the first thing he knew his nose was
put out of joint. A few minutes later his
ear was pierced with a resounding shriek
ns his wife fainted. Badgered by counsel,
who wanted to draw his teeth, and who
didn’t leave him a leg to stand on, he got
his hair off. Then his wife fainted again
and his eye fell on her. It was not long
before he lost his head, and the first police
witness had hardly begun to give evidence
when my unhappy’s friend’s ears started
to burn. When he tried to defend himself
the Judge told him to leave his cheek out-
side; a course which the afflicted wretch
was forthwith obliged to take. And they
call British justice safe!

P.O.M.C.
ALL PRECEDENT SHATTERED.
Even now, after ten minutes’ calm thought,
we feel we have dreamt the whole thing.
Here we are sitting in an uncomfortable
spring chair without springs, nibbling hard
toast and cursing Brown from next door
for eating all the butter last night; and re-
flecting that unless the wife hurries and
gets our breakfast she will be late for work.
We look at the clock: seven o’clock, And
then it comes over us —the events of this
amazing morning.
We don’t suppose anyone will believe us:
we. wouldn’t believe it ourselves if anybody
told us. A.s we say, it’s like a dream.
We stare at the gas-ring moodily. Is it
a joke? If so, it is the strangest one that
has ever been played.
The wife denies all knowledge of the
affair. We don’t always believe her, but
when she goes about looking positively
pasty
We look at the clock again. A minute past
seven. So we are still sane.
Yet the thing remains beyond comprehen-
sion. Other times the wife has had to plead ;
ourselves have been forced to curse and
rave, and betimes resort to violence.
"Are you on speaking terms with your
missus yet?"
“Well, I'm listening again.”
We sigh, hide the toast crusts in our
pyjama pocket for later disposal without the
wife’s knowledge, and slowly leave the room.
At the end of the passage we pause.
Dashed if the little hound isn’t singing!
Willie, our Willie, mind you, is having a
bath of his own free will!

That from gaze of man and maid 1 shrink.

SHADOW SHOWS.
The two pictures at the Regent this week
should do more for Bolshevism than any
number of Domain speeches. George Raft,
hero of “Night After Night,” is a young
gangster who runs a speakeasy, with armory
complete. The Achilles heel of this poker-
faced little ruffian is a weakness which forms
the strength of social gossipers the world
over: he is a super-snob. When Constance
Cummings starts visiting his luxurious booz-
ing-ken his fate is sealed: she is his idea of
a lady. An uncontrolled female admirer,
whom he had discarded and had thrown into
the street, returns, finds him in his bed-
room with her rival and threatens him with
a revolver. His imperturbable demeanor so
impresses Miss Cummings that, after the
brawler has again been ejected, she presses
a passionate kiss upon his grim lips. He
calls on her next day to propose marriage.
Her home is even more spacious and lavishly
decorated than his own. “What a place to
live in!” he muses in flapperish rapture.
She refuses him, explaining that her affec-
tionate gesture was the outcome of a pass-
ing thrill, and he leaves, after condemning
her conduct in bitter terms, to face an
enemy raid on his speakeasy. And now the
pampered society maiden realises all she has
lost and rushes after him. The closing
sequence shows them in each other’s arms
while the rattle of rifle and revolver fire
proceeds below and his retainers call on him
to join in. A defect of many films which
portray life in England is that they repre-
sent the humbler characters as clowns (the
practice is even followed in “Cavalcade”) ;
American films go to the other extreme and
show illiterate oafs such as George Raft
portrays in “Night After Night” winning the
hands of women of fashion and education.
Both' conventions are idiotic, particularly
the Hollywood one. Mr. Raft follows the
recognised formula in depicting the gang-
ster chief; any actor who can stride about
m a purposeful manner and look baleful with
one hand in a bulging coat pocket is capable
of exploiting it successfully. The only act-
ing which isn’t completely conventional is
supplied by Alison Skipworth, as a cultured
ancient, who takes on the desperate task of
teaching the hero to speak grammatically,
and Mae West as a fat, uproariously vulgar
peroxide blonde. They get drunk together
while the Raft-Cummirigs romance is in pro-
gress, and their effort is painfully realistic.
“Luxury Liner” is one long contrast be-
tween the vulgar splendor of life in the first
class and the sordidness of the steerage. A
thin liaison is maintained between the two
classes by Alice White, a pretty girl with
a craving for the delights which, as a steer-
age passenger, she is unable to enjoy. She
eventually gets a champagne dinner in the
enchanted, territory out of a designing vil-
ain, but is forced to flee afterwards to save
her virtue. The story proper concerns a
doctor (George Brent) whose wife has bolted
with a millionaire. He confronts them in
their incredible suite —the ones occupied by
the Prince of Wales on his travels were
poverty-stricken compared with this—and
after various aspects of shipboard life have
been shown, the wife shoots the dastardly
capitalist and jumps overboard, leaving Mr.
Brent to find happiness with Zita Johann,
who has assisted him in his ministrations
to the sick as a nurse. Whether the direc-
tor meant it or not the message conveyed
by this film as by “Night After Night” is
that great wealth can only be acquired by
scoundrels. That fine English character-
actor C. Aubrey Smith is a gaolbird in the
steerage who collects money from his com-
panions for a flutter on the ship’s Stock
Exchange. The millionaire is shown making
a fortune; the steerage passenger doesn’t
even risk the forlorn hope, but returns the
money entrusted to him after the wretched
owners have given it up for lost.

Once upon a time there was a poor but
honest litle girl named Nancy Carroll who
worked in a night club. There she was
wooed by an erratic young man named
Charles Jones, whose offer of marriage she
spurned. She was also wooed by one John
Boles, who was very rich; for, remember,
she was the most beautiful as well as the
purest and best little girl in “Loveland,”
which was the name of the place where
she worked. Despite her mother’s warning
Nancy went off and lived in a fine apart-
ment given to her by kind Mr. Boles. Then
she had a baby and Mr. Boles (a gentle-
man through and through) married her; but
lie didn’t tell his rich friends about it. Nancy
was unhappy, thinking he had only mar-
ried her to give her child a name; and,
what with one thing and another, and being,
like so many movie heroines, a virtual
imbecile, she divorced him with a breaking
heart. She refused to collect her alimony;
however Charlie, who had by this time re-
appeared, collected it in her name and with-
out telling her, poor girl! As soon as she
heard of Charlie’s dirty trick she made
plans to marry him and so stop him taking
good kind Mr. 8., whom she secretly
adored, down—one of those little touches of
Nature that make the whole world of moron-
ism kin, as the saying goes. Well, after
that there was nothing for good Mr. Boles
to do but hurry to the scene and remarry
her Which he did, my dears, and they
lived happily ever after. Perhaps. The
name of this fairy tale is “Child of Man-
hattan ’ and it is being nil wound, chicks, at
the Capitol.
“Pleasure Cruise” rather resembles in
plot, acting and direction “The Guards-
man,” which' Sydney applauded about 12
months ago. Genevieve Tobin is finding
married life dull, so she decides to get away
rrom it for a while on a liner full of holi-
day makers, whose main diversions appear
to bo flirting and drinking. Roland Young,
her jealous, nagging husband, disguises him-
seit as a member of the crew in order to
keep an eye on her. His worst fears are
realisea. Every attractive man on board
IS u- i er * ier - . 110 w reac h a situation
which has evidently impelled our worthy
censor to work overtime. The most perti-
nacious of the lovers has arranged to spend
an evening with the lady. Young takes his
place. Later he throws off his disguise and
taxes her with her perfidy in tlie immemorial
manner of French bedroom farce. Fortu-
nately, she has learned by accident in the
n i c h time the identity of her companion
+1 * e ,P r ®Vious night, and is able to swear
tnat she knew it was her husband all the
time. No fare for puritans, and it is made
to appear all the naughtier by the finish
ot the acting. The cast includes Ralph
1 oibes, Herbert Mundin and Minna Gombell.

“The Queen Was In the
Rarlor, which has arrived at the Prince
hidward as _ To-night Is Ours,” doesn’t make
a good movie. It has too much love-making
and too little action. The spectacle of Fred-

telephones and so on is only relieved by the

him is preceded by an amazing
comedy m which a full-grown lion plays
lead. To paraphrase an American refer-
ence to the dogs in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,”
the lion, is poorly supported. However, he
monopolises attention to such purpose that
the crudities of his colleagues may be over-
looked. One of his feats is to attack the
villain w T ho has been making love to his
master’s wife. He leaps on the man, but
keeps his claws in, and appears to bite but
does no damage. When his master plays
with him he purrs like a dynamo. His devo-
tion and intelligence are beautiful to watch;
he allows liberties to be taken with him that
few dogs and no cat would put up with.
“Air Hostess,” at the Haymarket, is like
“Air Mail,” but the story isn’t so good.
The air hostess (Ang., stewardess) isEvalyn
Knapp. She likes the job. Then she mar-
ries James Murray, a stunter who can’t
support her. Thelma Todd (yes, you have
guessed right; she is a vamp again)
decides to back James’s inevitable scheme
and there are many, many heartbreaks
before he saves the train, in which Evalyii
is returning to her mother, from disaster.
The stunting is excellent.
“Their Night Out” is English. Claude
H'ulbert, a married business man, takes
Renee Houston, a lass from Aberdeen, where
she “sings in the choir,” on a jaunt to
London. Before the round of his night
clubs ends he has been identified as a
master criminal, placed in the dock, salaamed
to by the gang, almost deprived of his wife
(Judy Kelly) and victimised by a vamp.
It ends with his detestable mother-in-law
funnier than most farces, English or Ameri-
can.

SROUFF TO GIVE'EM
MECGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
EFFECTIVE DIPPING.
“W.D.Mc.”: I should like to endorse
“Yarraman’s” par. (B. 10/5/’33) on partial
dipping for fly. You must dip properly.
If I were living in a bad fly area I would
dip twice a year with a full-strength arseni-
cal powder dip, and I would delay the first
dipping as long as possible in order to get
enough wool to absorb. the maximum of
dip. It is most important that the dip
should be properly mixed according to the
maker’s directions. A long swim is a prime
factor, as the sheep then get time to absorb
the dip. This year, as I have seen, sheep
that were dipped twice in a month with
full-strength dip are still infected with tick;
they were dipped in 'a short-swim bath
(20ft.), and were not in the bath long
enough.
I would carefully crutch the sheep before
the second dipping, and I would cull all
sheep that had wrinkles on the breech. I
don’t think much of the Mules method men-
tioned by “Yarraman”; far better to get
rid of the wrinkly sheep. Wliat good are
they, anyway? I would not give them pad-
dock room. When Vermont sheep were in-
troduced about 45 years ago, and became all
the rage, I predicted that the day would
come when breeders would not be able to
give them away; and I have lived long
enough to see _ that come to pass. Plain
bodies every time for me. Some people
will object to twice dipping because it
stains the wool. If I had to choose between
stained wool and dead sheep, it would be
stained wool for mo.
Apropos, that Research Committee’s re-
port does not tell us anything new in the
way of fly repellents. Whale oil and spirits
of tar have been used with success in Scot-
land for more than 100 years and there
is no better repellent to-day. Dip twice,
crutch carefully, cull wrinkly sheep and use
whale oil and spirits of tar as a dossing till
something better js discovered. That’s my
advice.
“IF THE WORST ARRIVES.”
“Liss”: “Be ruthless,” “Dialectica” (B.
24/5/’33) says. Be as ruthless as you
may, old man drought is generally more
ruthless still. Often in the past, ewes that
could not be given away during the drought
realised fabulous prices after the break.
Those times are gone. Sheep numbers
have risen from 103,000,000 in- 1925-26 to
110,600,000 in 1931-32. It is necessary to
go back to 1891 to find the country so
heavily stocked. We could lose some
25,000,000 sheep in Australia and still be
well stocked up. The weakness of the
market for aged sheep is easily understood.
My early experience was gained with con-
servative, light-stocking people who had a
saying “It’s better to be sorry you sold
sorry you didn’t sell.” Generally in
the inland areas a coming drought can be
smelt a long way off by those who have
trained their observation powers. That is
the time to unload the oldest of the ewes
and wethers. There will be a market, since
general panic has not set in; and they will
probably be in good condition still. What
is more important, you will be easing your
country while there is still feed on it. Pre-
pare the remainder of the flock for the
strenuous times ahead by wigging those that
need it.. If there is any danger of worm
infestation, drench them twice with tetra-
chloride at an interval of about three weeks.
Spread them out over the country, provide
them with a good mineral lick and leave
them alone. It is surprising how long they
will hold on. It may be necessary later to
substitute an oil-meal salt fodder for the
lick.
The time to sell a ewe is after her third
lamb has been weaned. If wethers are shorn
three times, not counting the lamb-shearing,
it is sufficient. They are more readily sale-
able at these ages, and there is still some-
thing left in them for the next man. And
I say run more cattle (to keep the rough-
age down) and fewer sheep. Thus may a
man keep his country in good heart and be
enabled to graze if, and not eat it out. He
can then spell the paddocks periodically,
allowing them to seed in their turn, and
so conserve the native pastures. Then the
worst may never arrive.
WOOLPACIv PROBLEMS.
“Prosser”: Newfangled woolpacks •to
supersede the universally-used jute con-
tainer, because the latter sheds a proper
tion of its fibres into the wool, spring
up every season. We have had paper-lined
packs of a dozen different varieties, pure
paper packs, and even all-wool packs, the
last being intended to solve the problem
of utilising otherwise worthless wools as
well as that of the jute fibre. The latest
is an all-paper fabric, invented by I’. Hell-
lung, of Leeds University.
Like all its predecessors, it is heavier
than the jute article, and the price is ex-
pected to be double that of the jute pack.
Increased price and weight are two matters
which will have the trade thinking. It is
claimed that the fibre trouble will be abolished,
and that this will make up for the other
factors. But the proportion of fibre which
gets into wool from jute packs is not great,
nor is the burling process which removes it
unduly expensive, though it adds to the
cost of the finished wool. The weight of
he latest invention is said to be 51b. to Gib.
more than jute. This will mean extra
freight charges on bulk lots.
. “Peck”: When visiting Auckland (M.L.)
in January I went along to the wool sales
and there saw a woolpack made from
locally-grown flax. This, I thought, will
help us to reduce costs of production
and give the Maorilanders a thriving indus-
try. It looked similar to the jute pack,
but they told me that the tare was only
'4lb., the price 2s. Gd. As I left for Sydney
the following day I was unable to witness
a dumping test which was to take place.
SOME VALUABLE NATIVE SHRUBS.
Mulyan : Propagation and care of hardy
shrubs should not be neglected on grazing
areas subject to periodical droughts, for
these remain as a valuable emergency fodder
when the grass and herbage are gone. Besides
hop bush and wild cotton bush, previously
dealt with on the M.O.L. pages, there are
many indigenous shrubs of high fodder'value
and resistant powers that are eminently
suitable for such places as stony and sandy
hills. And there is emu bush, a vigorous plant
not affected by climatic conditions. Emus
feed on the seed, from which it gets its
name, and the young plants are greedily
browsed down by sheep and cattle.
A tall shrub with dense-foliage and long-
leaves is cattle bush. Sheep as well as cattle
eat it with avidity and thrive on it. The
plant is fairly plentiful on the north-western
N.S.W. plains, where its thick growth makes a
good shade. It is a fine standby. Another
hardy north-westerner is the mustard bush.
It is of dwarf habit, with a dense growth
of leaves, relished by sheep. Almost any-
where suits this plant, from the top of
hungry stony ridges to rich river flats. The
same may be said of sheep bush (other
names are geljera and wilga), which is tall
and ornamental. It has long, narrow leaves,
and is found near the coast as well as in the
arid interior. Another ornamental plant is
the native jasmine, which grows to about
6ft. high. This bush is often completely
denuded of foliage by stock, but the twining
branches put on fresh leaves even during a
severe drought.
Three shrubs that are named from their
colors are grey bush, blue bush and silver
bush, each of which has a soft covering
that gives it its distinctive hue. Grey bush
withstands the driest conditions. Blue bush is
far-famed among cattlemen—a stout shrub of
2ft. or 3ft. high, with short, thick leaves.
It is usually found in dry country, flourish-
ing and providing succulent feed in the
severest weather. Like cabbage saltbush, its
leaves when boiled are a good substitute for
garden spinach. It can be grown from seed
or cuttings. Silver bush also grows to
about 3ft. high, but in sheep country it is
generally cropped down. It will grow in
poor and dry soils. With its silvery appear-
ance and attractive flowers it is always a
handsome plant.
Pin bush is another that will grow in poor
soils. Though found often on dry, sandy
ridges, its roots provide water for the thirsty
traveller. It grows fairly tall, and bush-
men make tobacco pipes with the wood.
Yellow hairy spikes, so named from its
flowers, i.s also indifferent to soil and dry
conditions. It is very deep-rooted, and
though it is grazed down to the ground it
soon springs up again from the roots. And
don’t forget motherimbung, one of the
acacias, which grows from 15ft. to 25ft.
high; it is thickly foliaged from the ground
upwards. Some stockowners class this as
the best of the bunch. It has a thin stem,
but carries a thick top of sappy leaves, and
stands severe lopping.
THE STATION SKIN SHED.
“Liss” : It should be adjacent to the kill-
ing pen, and it needn’t be an elaborate affair
so long as the skins are protected from
the weather and dogs. Ten sheets of Bft.
corrugated galvanised-iron will cover a shed
big enough to hold as many skins as most
runs will have in a year. A double row
of posts, 6ft. or so between posts and 6ft.
between the rows, one row 6ft. 6in. high
and, the other 6ft. high, form the shed
proper, the iron being laid in a single row
on rafters twitched with wire to those posts.
Three sides and one end are netted-in to
keep dogs from the skins, and at the other
end a wire-netting door is hung.
The skins hang on a rack formed by two
rows of posts, about sft. high, to which
two rows of parallel rails have been
twitched. The measurements of this rack
will be such as will suit the general run
of ration sheep on the station, but the top
row should be about 12in. from the roof
and the lower row about 2ft. 6in. below this.
They should be wide enough apart to slightly
stretch the average skin. Skins are hung
on these rails by means of wire hooks, tail
end up and skin towards the door, so that
they may be easily sprayed with anti-weevil
wash, though as they are seldom attacked
until stacked this can be left until just
prior to baling, if desired. A cheap wash
is made by boiling lib. arsenic and 21b.
washing soda in 4gal. water. The roof
should have guttering and down-piping lead-
ing to the water tank at the killing-pen.,
TOO MANY PIG BUEEDS.
“Soor”: The Wessex pig may be all that
is said of him (B. 12/4/’33), but he
adds one more to the monstrous regiment
of grunters to which Australian ’breeder
pin their faith. This is particularly the
case in Queensland, where the ®Wessex is
the latest arrival. Pig-farmers there are
divided between at least eight varieties of
different types with which they are frying
to storm the overseas pork market. The
result, of course, is lack of uniformity of
carcase, and that is no good at all to the
overseas buyer, involving, as it does, crosses
and re-crosses innumerable, with a corre-
sponding variety in tin l marketed product.
This objection applies to bacon production
as well as pork.
The sooner Australian breeders for export
settle on one particular type of pig, as is
done in Denmark, and stick to it, the better.
MOULD-POISONING.
“Tombong”: More cattle are lost
through mould-poisoning (or para-botulism)
than is commonly realised. A competent
authority assures me that while losses
occur perhaps everywhere, in some districts
the deaths from this cause exceed those
from all other diseases put together.
, The symptoms are confused with those
of numerous other complaints. . Anthrax, im-
paction, bone-chewing, bots, even that hoary
refuge of ignorance “snake-bite,” are all
debited with many deaths of which they are
innocent. Bone-chewing, however, is reason-
ably suspect, as the guilty germ harbors
among old bones, as well as in mouldy hay
and decaying grass, and even standing cereal
crops grown for winter-feed, where the lower
leaves have gone into a yellow semi-decay.
Mouldy hay and feed-grass, however, are
the chief causes. I have known cases where
a lot of such' hay. thrown out for the stock
‘to pick out the best,”'has caused the death
of all that ate of it. Such easy evidence
is not, however, usually obtainable, as rank
vegetation in the paddocks also freely
harbors the germ. All musty hay and other
feeds should be burned, instead of being-
thrown out to spread infection.
Where any mysterious losses have taken
place, particularly in late autumn or early
winter, symptoms that should be closely
watched for are stiffening of the limbs and
inability to gather food into the month.
Immediately these arc observed administer
a drench lib. Epsom salts, 4oz. washing
soda, Boz. treacle, dissolved in a quart of
water. This may be repeated in an hour
or two, if it seems advisable. .
BAILING-UP YOUNG HEIFERS.
“D.C.” : Build a lane to the bail. I have
a great saving in time and trouble
after the old barbarous way. The bail is
usually on a continuance of one side of the
milking-yard, under cover. With stout
timber erect, say, four Oft. panels of three
mils each for this lane. For the first panel
and gate (to yard into), at the end forth-
est from the bail, set the new wing 7ft
wide, narrowing to 3ft. 6ih. wide at the
of the second panel.
For the third panel narrow to 2ft. 6in.
wide, leaving one panel to the bail. Here
erect two stout posts 2ft. 6in. wide, mortised,
with peg holes bored for four rails. If
many heifers are to be broken in a gate
at this spot is better and can be taken away
when not required, but rails answer the
purpose satisfactorily.
Now, when you get the new cow in to
bail her up, have rails ready to place be-
hind her at the posts two panels from the
bail to prevent her from getting back. The
space behind this bail should allow plenty
of room for the young calf (I have a small
gate into this space to the right of the
cow’s head), so have the baby there on
tive other side of the bail where she ' can
see it as she advances. She will, with a
little time, put her head into the bail to
touch the calf and can be securely pegged.
There only remain the rails to be taken
down and to milk. A timid cow can always
be bailed up this way without being unduly
frightened.
. WALNUT CULTURE.
The M.O.L. section is indebted to the
N.S.W. Agricultural Department for some
interesting notes on walnut-growing, sup-
plied in answer to a correspondent who
wants to go in for it. The department has
tried walnuts on several of its experiment
orchards, but as it was found that all these
orchards lacked some’ of the condition!?, soil
or climatic, necessary for walnut culture,
the trees have not been a success. Obstacles
to extensive planting in N. S. Wales are
the length of time trees take to come into
crop, their liability to walnut blight and
difficulty in obtaining reliable cropping trees
bearing a good class of nut.
The walnut-tree thrives best in a rich, deep
friable loam, or in a shallower soil with - a
deep friable clay sub-soil, well supplied with
moisture, that , drains well. Deep, rich
alluvial loam suits excellently; deep soils
of a very sandy nature do not. In select-
ing a site, avoid positions liable to spring-
frosts.
In N. S. Wales the walnut has been
planted chiefly on the Tablelands and West-
ern Slopes, but it might do as well east of
the Dividing Range, in localities not too
close to the sea. In fact, among the out-
standing trees that the department has
selected for propagation one is growing at
Langley Vale. Most of the trees planted
in the State have been seedlings. Seedling
trees which produce crops regularly of a
good type of nut have been located, and an
attempt has been made to produce these
trees vegetatively with a view to testing them
out in various localities. The wood of trees
that have proved successful will be obtain-
able by nurserymen and others who wish' to
propagate trees from them. Franquette has
proved a satisfactory variety* Two varieties
recently introduced by a South Aus. nursery-
man are Freshford Gem and Wilson Wonder.
The latter bears a very large nut and is
worth a trial. Anyone planting walnut
trees for nut production should plant only
budded or grafted trees of proved varieties ;
don’t rely on seedling trees. To ensure
satisfactory pollination, it is an advantage
to have several varieties.
The walnut-tree should be planted while
dormant in the winter, the land having
been deeply ploughed and prepared, some
months before. Where the soil is deep
trees should be planted about 50 feet apart;
in the shallower soils, 35 feet or 40 feet.
This wide planting allows for inter-cropping
while trees are young, or filler trees of a
quick-bearing fruit might be interplanted. In
either case, the land left about the walnut-
trees should be cultivated. Trees require very
little pruning. Towards autumn the huil
splits away from the shell and allows the
nut to fall to the ground. Picking up of the
nuts should be frequent, especially if the
weather be showery. Clean or dirty, nuts
should be dried off in slatted-bottom trays,
supported a few inches from the ground by
a wooden framework, soon after harvesting.
WIRING WALLABIES.
“The Moucher”: There is no need to
set up the elaborate sapling noose officially
recommended (B. 24/5/’33) to snare wai-
labies. A simple “wire,'’ used by English
poachers for hares, is good enough, and
less trouble. The wallaby comes along his
pad head down at a uniform height from
the ground, which can easily be gauged by
a little observation. Set the loop of twisted
copper-wire in position across the pad, with
a twig cleft at the top to hold the shank,
the end of the loop being secured to a
stouter peg (or anything solid) by a stout
cord. It can be set in a few seconds, and
is not liable to be disturbed by wind or
other outside agencies as is the bent-sapling
contraption. Where cultivation is sur-
rounded by a wired fence, in which the wal-
labies make a permanent widening between
two wires where their pad comes to the
fence, a “wire” set there is 100 per cent,
efficient. Another important item is that
the dog, if caught in a “wire,” will sit
down until someone comes to release him
With the sapling it is a case of good-night
to him. I have caught many wallabies •
and dogs—with the “wire.”

PREPARING FOR CHICKS.
“Al Buraen”: Don't wait till they arrive
before fixing a place for them; you might
sis well bury ’em straightway. Whether
hatching them yourself or purchasing day-
olds, prepare well ahead. New, well-
grassed ground is preferable; failing this,
clean what you have and sweeten with
plenty of burnt lime. The house should be
cosy and s® constructed that full advantage
may be taken of the early morning sun.
A concrete floor, if used, should _ be well
covered with clean straw cut in short
lengths. A wooden floor is best, but watch
underneath it for rats.
If using a heated brooder, stick to it,
gradually lowering the temperature and
weaning the youngsters off the heat. When
cold-brooding, stick to that system—don’t
fry half-and-half ideas. Crowdiug is the
greatest enemy of the cold-brooding system, so
guard against it. Don’t have a brooder with
square corners; round them off.
Cleanliness is indispensable. Allow ample
hopper space, and have grit 'and charcoal
always available. While fitting the house
with all necessary appurtenances, have a
nice plot of greenfeed coming on —lucerne,
lettuce, silver beet. When the chicks do
arrive, follow a strict regimen of good feed-
ing, cleanliness and avoidance of crowding,
and your battle is more than half over.
BUILDING A SIMPLE BRIDGE.
“Larrapinta”: These instructions will
serve to bridge a creek up to 25 feet wide.
First, level down the earth on either side
at the chosen spot, and then lay down a
good foundation of sound logs, parallel to
the creek and going back at least six feet
from the edge. Select two stout and straight
young trees for the girders and haul them
into position; 10 feet is the right width
to liave them apart. And you will need
four young saplings, not less than Sin. .in
diameter at the butt end. Draw a straight
line on a level patch of soil as long as the
girder, take two saplings, place the butt end
of each across this line two feet back from
the end of the line, and let their thin ends
cross midway along the line and 6ft. out
from it. You can now mark the cuts on
them; a vertical cut where they meet, and
a long splay at the foot of each'. Saw them
off, chip a level place where the foot of
each goes, 2ft. back from the girder ends,
place saplings in position above the girder,
and fasten their feet firmly down with deck
spikes.
The two top ends butt together, and are
fastened with an iron plate and coach
screws on one side. A strut is joggled in
midway along each side, at almost a right
angle off the saplings, and they are also
spiked into place. A hole is bored up
through where the saplings meet at the
crown and down through the centre of the
girder below; another just outside each
strut, with corresponding holes in the girder
below. Through each a long bolt of one-
inch mild steel is passed, with big washers
on either end, and screwed up until the
whole affair is taut and rigid.
When both sides are finished the decking
can be laid. This is best made of straight
timber split in half, fastened down to the
girders with deck spikes. Where the struts
meet the girder it is necessary to bolt a
cleat inside to carry the decking. When the
decking is in place metal the approaches
and lay a thin coat of metal over the deck-
ing. This method of construction will carry
heavy loads with safety, but be sure to go
oyer the nuts on the bolts with a wrench
every few weeks until the timber has stopped
shrinking.
To protect the abutments of the bridge
from being washed or scoured out, plant wil-
low wands in the banks on both the up- and
downstream sides. If you see signs of scour-
ing before the willows have had time to bind
the soil, drive sapling stakes in at. once to
protect the earth.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What varieties of limes mill (/row in
N.S.W.? What is the small green variety
which grows in Ceylon? Where can lime-
trees he obtained? —-5663.
The two most valuable varieties are
Tahiti and East Indian. The latter variety
ip N.S.W. matures with an orange-colored
flesh, and is probably similar to the one
mentioned as growing in Ceylon of greenish
color. Tahiti, however, is a better variety,
very closely resembling the lemon, but seed-
less. Both varieties are obtainable from
nurserymen.
Frogs infest a well on my property. They
die in it. How can I hill the frogs and at
the same time keep the water clean? —3DSB.
It might be possible to purify the water
after pumping it to the supply tank by
adding a little permanganate of potash. The
only way to ensure a permanent supply of
clear water in the well would be to catch
the frogs with a net, by the aid of a pocket
torch, and then roof it over, or place a fine-
mesh, close-fitting wire-netting frame about
a foot from the surface so that others can-
not enter.
What is telegony? —ssB2.
Telegony may bo illustrated by the more
or less common belief that after a female
has borne young by a certain male her sub-
sequent offspring will show characteristics
derived from the previous sire. The classic
example is that of a mare which bore off-
spring by a quagga and later produced horse
colts which showed some striping. Numerous
attempts have been made to confirm this by
crossing mares and zebras, but in all cases
they have failed. Where telegony has been
believed to exist and investigations have
been made, it lias been discovered that the
breeding of the female has been at fault, or
the sire has not been correctly stated. Evi-
dence has never been produced that telegony
exists.
lITNTS FOR THE FARM.
“Sheepo”: If salt 1 iclcs are used in (lie
paddocks, don’t put them near watering-
places. Sheep generally camp there and
most of the feed about the waters is eaten
off. Sheep in the habit of licking salt need
something to eat as a ballast; they won t
get it with salt licks about the water.
“Fancar”: ’Ware pepper trees near a
shallow bore! The casing holes of a neigh-
bor’s bore, less than a hundred feet deep,
were recently blocked by the roots of a
pepper tree growing a chain and a half
away.
“Tena”: To desti’oy small patches of
blackberry, burn back the bushes when dry
and dig up roughly with a mattock after
scattering some maize about. Put strong-
posts at each corner and enclose with wire
or fence that will hold pigs. Put in pigs
and supply with Avater, but do not overfeed.
In a week’s time the animals will have
rooted out every blackberry, and not much
further trouble Avill be experienced from this
patch.
“Beefo” : Cows calving on the road cause
trouble when there is no calf cart with the
plant. To avoid going back for a cow whose
calf has been killed, throw and hobble her
before putting the cattle on the night camp.
She will be there in the morning, and a
couple of nights in hobbles will make her
forget her calf.
“D. Kendall”: The best home-made silo
is of corrugated iron. Size should be adapted
to requirements; an ordinary 2000-gallon
tank holds 83 bags when full. A trap-door
should be cut in the side three feet from the
ground, and a slide fitted in to simplify bag-
ging of wheat when emptying. A root
should be placed over silo or stack. _ Wheat
may then be kept without deteriorating.
“Kirby”: When planting kikuyu roots —
a tedious job by hand —first put bunches of
the grass through the cliaffcutter, cutting
in lengths as long as the cutter will allow.
Have the ground in good harrowing con-
dition, broadcast the roots in showery
weather and harrow in. Don’t turn stock
on it till it’s avcll rooted and covering the
ground. Kikuyu should be kept well grazed
when established, as when it becomes more
than six inches high the protein content
is lowered.
“Bushman”: To get the most out of a
petrol-tin for building, place it on a bed
of live coals till the solder melts, then you
have a single sheet 36in. by 14in. Sheets
can be soldered, riveted or fastened together
with roof screws. Painted, they last a long-
time.
“Elgar”: Sitting under a hawthorn hedge
near Diamond Creek (Vic.), I was stung
on the forehead by a bee. I pulled out the
sting and went to the house for the loan of
a bluebag. “Ah,” smiled the old lady, “I
know something better than that,” and she
brought a teaspoon of honey. Dipping my
finger in I rubbed the honey avoll into the
puncture, and thankfully departed. No
pain, no nothing.
“Karaway”: When using putty on win-
dow-sashes or other wood, brush on a little
linseed oil first, and put the putty on after
the oil has soaked in. This makes it stick
better, and it does not crack and come off
where exposed to the sun, as it often does
when put on without the preliminary oiling.
When it cracks on a sash or starts to open
at the edges, the wet gets in and rots the
Avood.
“George Icks”: When your hoe wears
down, don’t throw it aAvay. Rivet on to it
a piece of an old cliaffcutter knife or a dis-
carded cultivator disc, and you have an
implement that will last generations.
“Salmon Gums”: A productive spare-time
job. Set aside portion of a shed, gather all
the bones lying round, and place them in a
bin. Mix Avith them three or four times their
bulk of ashes, and keep moist with enough
water to make a good lye. Stir well occa-
sionally. In a feAv months the mixture will
become sufficiently friable to grind to a
powder; and then you wi 11 have good fer-
tiliser. I have seen heaps of two or three
thousand rabbits poisoned daily on a single
farm, and the carcases merely burnt and the
ashes left exposed to the weather*. A little
extra trouble would have reduced the fer-
tiliser bill.
“Liss”: When preparing sheepskins for
market, don’t fold them down the middle
and press up in the wool press; this cracks
the pelt. Pick a suitable place on the floor,
and use as a lever a stout rail or piece of
din. piping. Day on the floor three pieces
of galvanised wire long enough to go round
the finished bale, one lengthwise and two
across. On top of these place two light
battens. Select a good big skin for the
first, putting a similar one aside for the
last. Lay the first skin carefully in place
on the battens, skin side down, the next
wool side down head to tail, and so on !
in pairs till the last skin is reached, which,
will go skin side up. Stencil the brand on
a piece of sacking and place this next, then
the battens, which this time should be a
little heavier. Place the lever across Avith
the end in the position selected and press
down. When the bundle is as tight as it
can be got tie the Avires.
“M.K.D.” : Several date palms are grow-
ing in the Kallara station garden, on the
bank of the Darling River, half-way between
Bourke and Wilcannia (N.S.W.). Three of
these palms were planted (from seed) over
70 years ago by Mrs. Macgillivray, mother of
Dr. Macgillivray, of Broken Hill. The palms
have been bearing fruit (self-fertilised) for
v r ery many years. They bear annually;
but birds, during bad seasons, which are
many, are driven in to the settlements, and
they play havoc Avith dates and all other
fruit.
“Valerin”: My experience of grass silage
is that it is the least satisfactory method
of conserving fodder. I have seen stacks
opened up that were a bed of ashes; others
in which the siliage was dry and devoid of
nutriment. The cheapest method, and the
least wasteful, is the pit silo. And don’t
rely on nature to provide the stuff to fill
it; grow it.
“Mentha”: Mint weed (Salvia lanceolata),
an introduction from the U.S.A., is overrun-
ning parts of the Darling Downs. The plant
came into prominence about 15 months ago
following a heavy mortality in travelling
cattle. Feeding tests at Glenfield (N.S.W.)
leave no doubt regarding its toxicity, but
my own experience is that paddock stock
can take an occasional bite with impunity.
With travelling stock coming on to large
patches it is different. The weed is an
annual, but starts seeding when only a
couple of inches high and continues to set
seed the rest of its life.

Information Sought.
(1) Where to apply in Queensland for an
appointment to the Australian Instructional
Corps? (2) Any vacancies? (3) Military
experience or educational qualifications
necessary? (4) Pay? —s9o3.
(1) District Base Commandant, Victoria
Barracks, Brisbane. (2) None at present.
(3) Previous military experience in either
the Australian Forces or the British Army
is essential and applicants are also required
to have a second-class certificate of educa-
tion or its equivalent. (4) £215 per annum
plus (Id. per day uniform allowance.
(1) 1 propose to buy a block of land.
I am informed that the vendor purchased
it from a bankrupt estate and the only title
he gives is known as the Official Assignee’s
title. Is this sound? (2) What would my
costs be on the deal, £45? (3) Would ad-
joining owners be able to claim anything
from me for fences, the two sides being
fenced, leaving me only the two ends to do?
One has been up about 20 years and the
other a couple of years. —6o67!
(1) The Official Assignee can transfer as
good a title as the original holder held. (2)
Depends on how much trouble your solicitor
lias with the title. (3) If additional fences
are required you would have to pay half tin-
cost.
What effect would a bequest of £36 have
on. an old-age, pensioner’s pension? —6o49.
No effect. There is no reduction of pen-
sion in respect of accumulated property not
exceeding £5O.
Where was Les Darcy born, and where did
he begin boxing? Who was his first oppo-
nent in Sydney, and had he any American
contests ? —6llB.
Born in Woodville (N.S.W.) ; he began
his boxing career in a tournament at New-
castle 23 years ago. He did not fight in
America.
Were Bob Fitzsimmons and Oriffo ever
champions of the world?. —6l3o.
Fitzsimmons was. in succession, the undis-
puted holder of three world’s champion-
ships : middleweight, heavyweight and light-
heavyweight. Griffo’s victory on points
over Billy Murphy, holder of the world's
featherweight championship, has not been
recognised by fistic authorities overseas as
giving Griffo a title to the championship.
Do British immigrants receive preferential
transportation rates to Australia? Is it dif-
ficult for an Englishman to obtain admission ,
into Australia? Are immigrants accepted
from America? —6ls4.
The only immigrants who receive preferen-
tial transport rates at present are the wives
and children of men who received assisted
passages themselves during the operation of
the Migration Agreements, which ceased in
1930. No difficulty is placed in the
way of the landing of a British subject
accompanied by his family, subject to their
being in sound health and in possession of
a valid British passport. It would be neces-
sary for an American to obtain a landing
permit from the Department of the Interior.
Canberra, the application for which should
contain information as to the amount of
capital he could bring.
Percentage of trade-unionists unemployed
in Australian cities and towns? —-6158.
The best measure of unemployment avail-
able _ in Australia is the Commonwealth
Statistician’s figure for the percentage of
trade-unionists unemployed, which was 26.5
P-c. for the first quarter of 1933, compared
with 28.3 p.c. for the first quarter of the pre-
vious year. In computing this figure the
Statistician does not collect returns from
unions whose members are in permanent em-
ployment, such as public servants, railway
employees, etc., or from unions whose mem-
bers are casually employed, such as wharf-
laborers. The figures do not include persons
out of work through strikes or lockouts.
They represent mainly urban unemploy-
ment, as very little information is collected
from rural unions.
(1) Sydney and Melbourne mean tempera-
tures, summer and winter? (2) Maximum
and minimum temperatures in both centres
and dates upon which such temperatures
occurred ? —6162.
(1) Melbourne, mean summer, 6G.Gdcg.
Fahr.; mean winter, 50deg. Sydney, mean
summer, 71d0g.; mean winter, 54.2 deg. (2)
Melbourne, maximum, 111.2 deg. Fahr. on
dan. 14, 1862; minimum, 27deg. Fahr. on
July 21, 1569. Sydney, maximum. 108.5 deg.
Fahr. on Jan 18, 1896; minimum, 35.9 deg.
Fahr. on July 12, 1890.
(1) Where can I obtain a \-h.p. 220-volt,
D.C. shunt-wound, motor, 2800 r.p.m,.? (2)
How is the speed controlled? (3) Gan a
slower-speed motor be speeded up to 2800
r.p.m.? (4) What speed variation is pos-
sible;?— 6087.
(.1) Machining and Electric Co, 294
Oxford-street. Sydney. (2) By the field
regulator. The speed increases as resist-
ance is inserted in the field circuit. (3) De-
pends upon tlie load. The rated speed should
not be greatly exceeded on full load as this
will cause excessive armature current. (4)
About 10 per cent, up or down.
What steps can be taken to have the birth
of an adult, born in Queensland, registered?
—-6163.
No birth can be registered in Queensland
after the expiration of three years, but the
Registrar-General, Brisbane, keeps a register
in which all particulars relating to unregis-
tered children are noted. Certificated copies
are issued, and are generally accepted
as proof of age. Call on the Registrar-
General, make a declaration, and lodge a
fee of 2s. 6d., and the entry will be made.
How to repaint an old gas engine? —6lls.
First remove any grease and oil with a
benzine rag, and rust and scale with emery-
paper, arid then apply Taubman’s engine
enamel evenly with a clean brush, thinning
if necessary, with turps.
'Name of the small blue flower with
dozens of pointed petals which grow amid
hair-like leaves? Is it easy to grow, and will
it thrive in hot Queensland districts? —6200.
The plant is nigella, or love-in-a-mist; a
hardy annual which thrives w’ell in any kind
of soil. The seedlings do not transplant well
and seed should therefore be sown sparsely
in prepared beds, plants, being thinned out
to bunches of three. Nip out the centres
to cause bushy growth. There are two
varieties — Miss Jekyll Alba (white) and
Miss Jekyll (blue).
(1) What are chionodoxas? (2) Are they
procurable in Sydney? (3) When to plant.
flowering time and how to cultivate them?
—6206.'
(1) They are bulb plants, natives of Crete
and Asia Minor. Luciliw (blue and
white) and Sardensis (gentian blue)
are the best-known varieties. They thrive
in rich loamy soil in coo] shaded positions.
(2) Sydney seedsmen sell them at 6d. each,
ss. per dozen. (3) Planting time is
February to. April, and they flower in Sep-
tember and October. Lift the bulbs every
three years, divide them and replant 2in.
deep and Sin. apart.
Method of making Vienna bread? —s96l.
Any standard bread formula is suitable.
Loaves are placed on. the floor of a
special steel oven, and cooked by steam.
The home breadmaker cannot make this
bread successfully, as it is not possible to
apply steam to the oven. A fair imitation
can be secured by placing loaves on an oven
shelf without tins, and placing inside the
oven a small saucepan of boiling water, which
will spread steam through the oven.
(1) What produces a scored cylinder in
a car engine? (2) Can the cylinder be re-
paired?—-6039.
(1) Due to lack of oil or loose piston-
ring, allowing the flames from the combus-
tion to work past the loose ring and prevent
it from receiving proper lubrication. (2)
Yes, by reboring, reaming or grinding. If
the cylinder is not scored too deeply, it can
be lapped in with an old piston covered with
oil and emery, or the scores can be filled
if the cylihders are not out of round. If the
cylinder is out of round the cylinder bore
must be enlarged and oversize pistons and
piston-rings fitted.
(1) Why do the engines on racing cars
generally use a smaller number of piston-
rings than are used on touring cars? (2)
Number of rings usually employed on both
types of engine? (3) Average clearance of
pistons ?-— 6033.
(1) In order to assist lubrication, per-
fectly tight compression not being so essen-
tial for high-speed engines as for low-speed
ones. Good compression is essential for good
carburetion at low speeds, while it is not
so imperative at high speeds. (2) Racing
engines employ one or two piston-rings;
touring cars, three or four. (3) Cast-iron
pistons. .OOlin. per inch of piston diameter:
aluminium alloy pistons. .002 in. per inch of
piston diameter,
(1) What is Fascism? (2) Who are the
Nazis, and what are their aims? —s92l.
(1) Fascism, which takes its name from
the Roman symbol of unity, the bundle of
staves, was the name given to the political
movement which arose in Italy soon after
the Great War to counteract a threatened
Communist revolution. The movement was
led by Benito Mussolini, an ex-socialist, who
has ruled Italy for the past ten years. (2)
The Nazis are the National Socialist party
of Germany, now under the leadership of
Adolph Hitler, who is Chancellor. The
party under its present management is not
socialistic, but is nationalist through and
through, and owes much of its strength to
a stiff opposition to the terms of the Ver-
sailles Treaty. Like Fascism, it. has estab-
lished a dictatorship.
What is the correct usage as to “Mr.” and
“Esq ” iib addressing a letter? —0057.
Such distinctions as used to exist have
now disappeared. In England the “Esq.”
was used to indicate an untitled person of
pedigreed birth possessed of land. Nowa-
days “Mr.” is a correct courtesy title for all
male persons without knighthoods, peerages
or the like.
(1) What is “gyroscopic effect” in the
flywheel of a moving motor-cart (2) In
what direction is this force exerted?— s99s
(1) and (2) When a wheel rotates at a
high speed it resists any movement in its
axis. The gyroscopic effect in the case of
a car, due to the flywheel, tends to keep the
car pointing in a straight line when it is
turning a corner. Practically speaking, the
rotating flywheel has but little effect on the
car.
What was the war record of the American
General Sheridan ? —GO24.
_ Philip Henry Sheridan, born at Albany,
New York, in 1831, graduated at West Point
in 1853. At the outbreak of the Civil War
he was named captain: in 1862 he was
appointed successively colonel, brigadier-
general and general of volunteers; and in
1864 major-general in the regular army. Ho
distinguished himself throughout the Civil
war, taking part in the engagements at Perry-
ville. Murfreesboro, Cliickamauga. Hawes
Shop, Trevellian Station, Winchester.
Fisher’s Hill, Waynesboro and Five Forks.
In 1860 he was made lieutenant-general, and
in 18S8 received the rank of general from
Congress. He died at Nonquitt, in Massa-
chusetts, in 1888.
(1) What is the procedure to obtain a
bookmaker’s license to bet on the flat at
Caulfield or Flemington? (2) What amount
of money is it necessary to hold, or what
guarantees of solvency must be given ? —5BOl.
(1) Apply to the secretary of the club
controlling the course. Forms can bo
obtained on application. (2) For Fleming-
ton an applicant for a flat permit would
require to show that he possessed not less
than £250 in cash or liquid assets, and
would have to be guaranteed for £250 by
another bookmaker holding a V.R.C. permit,
or alternatively produce a bond for £250.
The annual fee is £7.
I have a battery-operated taco-valve re-
ceiver which I use for ■headphone reception.
On touching one of the L.T. battery wires
1 receive a shock from the ’phones. Causa
and remedy? —6o2o.
Due to defective insulation in the ’phones.
Purchase a 25 henry choke and a 1 or
2 M.F. condenser. Remove the batteries
and headphones and disconnect the two
leads going to the telephone terminals on
the set. Connect the choke to these two
leads and then join a length of insulated
wire from the plate terminal of the last
valve socket to one of the condenser ter-
minals, The other condenser terminal is
taken to one of the ’phone terminals, the
other _ ’phone terminal being joined to the
negative B battery lead by a similar length
of wire. No loss of volume will result.
(1) What educational qualifications docs
the N.S.W. law require of a person wishing
to become apprenticed to dentistry? If I
fulfil these requirements, can the law still
stop me becoming apprenticed? (2) A coun-
try dentist was willing to apprentice me,
but on advice from Sydney he refused.
Couldn't the N.S.W. Dental Board inter-
vene in the matter? (3) Is it proposed to
amend: the law dealing with the apprentice-
ship of dentists? (4) What steps can I
take to get apprenticed? —s94o.
(1) The Dentists Act, which is admin-
istered by the Dental Board, provides that no
person shall be apprenticed until he has
passed the matric. exam, of Sydney Uni. in
subjects prescribed for entrance to the Fac-
ulty' of Dentistry. There could be no legal
objection to your becoming apprenticed to a
dentist if you fulfilled the educational re-
quirements. (2) Probably the dentist is a
member of the Australian Dental Associa-
tion, which prohibits its members from
accepting apprentices. This aspect of the
matter is outside the jurisdiction of the
Dental Board. (3) Consideration is being
given to the introduction of amending dental
legislation, and the question of the abolition
of the apprenticeship system will come under
review. (4) Endeavor to find some dentist
who is not. bound by the Australian Dental
Association.
How are wooden articles decorated with
batik dyes and: wax? —6l97.
Rub the article down with fine sandpaper
and touch it with the fingers as little as pos-
sible afterwards. Draw or trace a design on
to the wood very lightly in pencil. Have the
wax as hot as the brush will stand, and
wax all the outlines and any part of the
pattern that is to be left the natural color
of the wood. When the wax has set paint
on the batik dyes like water-colors; the
waxed lines will prevent the different colors
from running into one another. The dark
passages usually need two applications. Let
the paint dry before removing the wax and
then scrape off as much as possible with a
penknife; the residue can be lifted with a
clean rag soaked in petrol. If the article is
to be polished the wax can be rubbed in
with a little turpentine when the dye is dry.
Method of getting rid of the zinc in solder
containing about 60 p.c. lead, 39 p.c, tin and
1 p.c. zinc? —6060.
The solder is melted and, as soon as it
melts, taken off the fire. When cooling a
handful of powdered sulphur is stirred into
the pot. the metal being thoroughly mixed
with the sulphur. The pot is again placed
on the fire and heated. As it melts the
sulphur rises to the surface, carrying with
it all granulated particles of zinc, and
forms a hard crust, which must be removed
with an iron trowel before the metal gets
hot enough to ignite* the sulphur.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
George Price, of Randwick, made a raid
on Flemington stake-money at the V.R.C.
Birthday meeting. On Saturday he saddled-
up Kichaka for the Royal Handicap (six
furlongs) and Kuvera for the Sandringham
Handicap (1£ miles) ; both belong to the
“F. Smithden” partners. Kichaka was bred
at Bacchus Marsh, but had never previously
raced in Melbourne. His Sydney achieve-
ments caused him to be made a warm favor-
ite, but the bay stallion failed signally. D.
J. Price registered a training triumph by
taking first and second prizes with Vauntry
and Bon Cretien respectively; the latter,
like Kichaka, is a product of Green’s “Under-
bank” stud, where she, too, was foaled to
English time., Bon Cretien showed her
sprinting quality at Warwick Farm in
December, when she defeated Gloriole, High'
Disdain and others in the Horsley Handi-
cap, setting 1.12-1 for six furlongs. She
is raced by “G. Ornong,” a sporting barris-
ter, and 11. E. Spry. Evidently Dave Price
regarded Bon Cretien as being the better
of his pair, for, whereas the mare started
at 6 to 1, Vauntry was allowed to go out
at 15 to 1. His owner, F. W. Kitchen,
is president of the Victorian Chamber of
Manufactures.
Eleven King’s Cup candidates competed
in the Sandringham Handicap, which furn-
ished a thrilling finish. Prince Leo, about
whom 25 to 1 could have been obtained,
kept the lead for nearly a mile. He col-
lapsed when collared by High Brae, who
showed up boldly until Maurice .McCarten
forced Kuverg through on the rails. Even
then the issue was not settled. High Brae
answered splendidly to Duncan’s calls and
Kuvera was all out to score by a neck;
Alienist, winner of the last Perth Cup, was
Bert *" I SAY, GERT, DO BE more
CAREFUL. [ " ■
Gert/Whv,whats THE M/sTTER.?"
Bert/You oust missed me"
GERT ■ Im AWFULLY 50RRV!
only half a length farther off. Far back in
the field at five furlongs, Alienist, put in a
long-sustained run on the outside. Red
Sun shaped so poorly that J. IV. Lowe with-
drew the Maorilander from the King’s Cup.
After an equally exciting race Kuvera car-
ried off the King’s Cup on Monday from
Flail and Shadow King. He went out at
7 to 2.
It is on ttie cards that Belar, who ran
away with the York Hurdle will follow up
that success in the Grand National. He hails
Lorn the western district of Victoria, which
furnished the winner (Sparkling Moselle)
in 1926. Until Saturday this son of Poit-
rel had appeared only once over the battens,
but his victory then was so decisive that
the owner-trainer, J. Maloney, put him
aside for a metropolitan coup. Belar was
backed from 3.0 to 1 to half those odds at
Flemington. Except for a slight blunder
near the seven furlongs post, his jumping
was perfect. In 1931 Belar was second in
the Warrnambool Cup. Last season he
annexed the Lindsay Cup and the Oarnper-
dowu Cup. Rising nine years old, lie is a
half-brother to Chumree, who finished second
in the Grand National Hurdle of 1929.
Belar comes down 51b. (to 9st. 51b.) in
the Grand National. A luxurious weight for
a well-seasoned horse, who possesses undoubted
pace and has inherited stamina from Poit-
rol. Making his debut over the battens,
Umbertana jumped well and was second for
a large part of the journey. Ortalan (sec-
ond) is an improving horse, with an outside
chance in the big event next month.
Second place in both the York Hurdle
and Sandringham Steeplechase went to
horses owned by T. Pearce. He trains
Ortalan privately, but Lanilda is in the
stable of A. Fullarton, who habitually rides
the son of Lanius. It cost Redditch little
effort to dispose of Lanilda over the last
two furlongs. Jimball, who ran third after
making all the running, is not engaged in
the Steeplechase. Wirrate, the favorite, un-
seated his jockey at the third fence. Pre-
cocious, having his first race for months,
reproduced the jumping ability that enabled
him to win the “National” last year, but
condition failed him.
$ * * *
It was a great day for the shareholders
in Ascot, Victoria Park and Rosebery when
their concerns were registered hy the A.J.C.
and assured of Saturday meetings without
opposition. Whether the sport of racing has
gained is not so clear. Rosebery raced on
Saturday, and had its biggest crowd for
years ; but not many punters could have
shown a profit, as no favorite won outright.
But for being blocked once or twice, Labor
Girl (3 to 1) would have carried off the
Flying Handicap ; as it was she had to share
first place with Workman (29 to 1). Labor
Girl, who is a five-year-old chestnut mare by
Wolaroi —Waterproof, has done as much rac-
ing as Don Moon when the same age, and
seems all the better for it, as he did. The
experiment might be profitably tried with
other animals, instead of letting them eat
their heads off in the belief that they are too
delicate to stand more than half a dozen
gallops in public a year.
The defeat of Wedding Feast (5 to 4) in
the second division of the Flying Welter was
the worst blow backers suffered. Dalmatic
(6 to 1), ridden by Coutts, accomplished it ;
he did fairly well in middle-distance handi-
caps last season and it was thought that
6J furlongs would not suit him. Agincourt
(3 to 1) and Khartoum (7 to 2) had their
Canterbury battle over again in the Rose-
bery Handicap. This time the Spearhead
mare settled the Spearhead gelding, but both
had to strike their colors to Blairfort (4
to 1), who is by Fortafix —Royal Message.
It was an exciting finish, there being only a
lialf-head between Blairfort and Agincourt.
* =!! *
Valicare’s daughter, Care Free, is only a
pony but she can go like the wind. She
defeated an excellent field of sprinters in
the June Stakes at Randwick on Monday,
coming fast at the finish after Tom Pinch,
who was more favorably placed most of the
way, seemed to have the race in his . keep-
ing. Dame Moab also put in a brilliant
run to get third place. The burly Tom
Pinch would almost make two of these fillies.
Care Free, who was ridden by O’Sullivan,
traversed the six furlongs in lmin. lOJsec.
The price was 12 to 1.
For the second day at Randwick: —
Flying Handicap: Dunerc; next, Dame
Moab.
Winter Plate : Khartoum; next, Gippsland.
The Q.T.C. stewards disqualified Brown,
owner-trainer, Ellis, the jockey, and the mare
Fragrant Zephyr for 12 months following on
an inquiry into the running of the mare and
Pentheus at Doomben the previous Satur-
day. Brown and Ellis, with Pentheus, were
also disqualified for two years, the Sydney
nag having run like a goat in the Whin-
stanes Handicap on the first day of the
meeting and then come out to win the
Doomben Cup on the second in convincing
fashion.
* * * *
Sun Eagle is in the boom again. Awarded
the Doomben Cup as the result of the suc-
cessful protest against Pentheus, the brother
to Wee Glen got away with the Q.T.C.
Stradbroko Handicap on Saturday. He was
■well handicapped at 7st. 41b. on recent per-
formances, but it was erroneously believed
that, after his experience over a mile and a
quarter the previous Saturday he would not
be able to pace it with speedy customers
like Some Cure (9 to 4) and Ripolot. As a
matter of fact, he finished nearly three
lengths ahead of the favorite, Will Yet (9
to 2) being a length and a half behind Sun
Eagle and a length ahead of Some Cure;
the time was lmin. 14|sec. The St. Leger
provided a thrilling finish, but the result was
a facer for big punters who had laid the
< (Ids (3 to 3) on Star Deer. He was beaten
into third place by Brown Paddy (12 to 1)
and Lady Brindabella (16 to 11 ; there were
only heads between.
“Thormanby” : The 1933 Derby—the 154th
if we include the races run during the war —
was won by Hyperion, owned by a
descendant of the founder of the famous
classic, Lord Derby. This is his second wiu,
the other being in 1924, when Sansovino came
home. Hyperion is by the 1918 “Triple
Crown” winner, Gainsborough, from Selene,
by Chaucer, by King Edward’s Derby winner
Minoru. The Aga Khan, who won with
Blenheim in 1930, was second with King
Salmon, and F. Sykes’s Statesman, ridden
by Australian Carslake, third. . Hyperion
was favorite at sixes. The time 2min.
34sec., was a race record.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Muir and Lurich were billed to wrestle 10
rounds, and three more if no decision had
then been reached, for the heavyweight
championship of Australia at Leichhardt on
Saturday. Muir’s double wristlocks, together
with accurately-placed punches, so sickened
Lurich that the Russian did not look like
staying 10 rounds. A short-arm scissors
pinned him in the sixth. A similar hold
might have scored the winning fall for Muir
if Lurich had not bitten himself free. The
end came in the eighth. The Melbourne mat-
man put pressure on a body-scissors, and
had Lurich gasping for breath, when the
Russ stood up with the other’s legs
wound round his mid-section. Just as
Lurich seamed ready to submit, Muir was
suddenly back-slammed, and finished for the
night. ’Accidents will happen, even among
the best-regulated wrestling families.
Footbrawl
In spite of damp weather some 25,000
enthusiasts swarmed into Richmond’s ground
on Saturday to see Geelong and the Tigers
dispute the leadership of the competition.
Play was fast and clever in patches. In the
third quarter the visitors staged a few con-
certed drives that gave them a 25-point lead;
when on resuming they added a goal, the
game looked to be theirs, but after that
Richmond got a move on and left the others
standing. 'Again and again Zscheck in the
centre passed the ball along to full-forward
Titus, who made position most cleverly. Tie
booted six goals and a few behinds while Gee-
long’s backs looked on, and at the end the
Tigers held 88 points to Geelong’s 71. Fitz-
roy also looked like going down before
Essen don, but recovered before it was too
late and then wound up with a last quarter
that carried all before it. The excellent
Haydn Bunton spread himself all over the
picture—’Roy, 125 points; ’Don, 93. South
Melbourne, at home, managed to beat Haw-
thorn with 73 points to 60, but the play of
both teams was notable more for the chances
missed than those taken.
i\i v '!■ '•*
The two inter-State football matches in
Sydney provided a sharp contrast. The
Rugby Union game between N.S.W. and
Victoria was one of the fastest and most
thrilling seen in the Bridge City. The game
under the League code between Queensland
and N.S.W. was a dreary exhibition which
saw the crowd leaving the ground shortly
after half-time.
The Union match was played at. North
Svdney Oval, the attendance being given as
12,000. The Victorians showed, in Sydney
last year that they had arrived in a Rugby
sense when they met the pick of N.S.W. and
were narrowly defeated. On the present
occasion the home side won 17-14, but can
thank the fading condition of the Victorians,
fresh from a long train journey and with
half a dozen injured in the second, half, for
their success. In the first half, which ended
with Victoria leading by 34-6, the home side
was outplayed, particularly in the forwards,
where the visitors brought weight and pace
to bear. Ten minutes before time the scores
were level, and if the very reliable Beyer
had not suffered a spell of poor goal-kick-
ing, the verdict would have been the other
way about. As it was, a good try by Young
clinched the matter by giving N.S.W. a lead
of 3 points. The combination, handling
and pace of both sides were of the best, and
the crowd saw Rugby as it should be playec.
Tackling was deadly also, and both teams
were a sore lot at the whistle. Of the visi-
tors, Ward, an old Sydney player, made a
great showing on the wing, scoring two
splendid tries. Beyer at full-back gave a
fine exhibition of line-finding, his length and
accuracy being a great asset to his side,
while his handling was perfect. Dunlop
and Dewar, with the ex-N.S.W. and All
Black forwards Perrin and Jessep, were
outstanding in the forwards. The home
forwards were well led by Judd, Walden and
Palfreyman. Horsell was solid: at full-back
and Tolhurst on the wing the best back ol
the side. Towers was like the curate’s egg.
and Jan McShane on the day did not out-
shine his Victorian opposite number, Gee,
as scrum-half.
The League match proved a disappoint-
ment to the 30,000 attendance at Sydne\
Cricket Ground. A feature of the game
was the presence of the entire. Toowoomba
team as Queensland representatives, the side
having carried all before it in the North.
The reason for its reputation is hard to seek.
The N.S.W. side was drawn entirely from
the Sydney clubs, yet it had no difficulty m
running over the visitors from the beginning,
and the final win by 24-0 —4 tries, 6 goals
—could scarcely have been a more definite
one. Not that the home players shone them-
selves. They displayed much, of the inert-
ness and lack of enterprise evident among
the visitors, but they made better use ot
what chances came their way and showed
more signs of a fixed plan of campaign. Ihe
forwards were the most satisfactory sec-
tions of both teams, though Queensland
weakened its play by imitating the Eng-
lish practice of standing far down the field
offside with no benefit to its game. lwo
or three of them were far too slow and
clumsy, and did more harm than good.
Doyle, a fast, hard tackier, was the best oL
the Red vanguard. The Welsh pack was
livelier and more effective. Bishop hooked
in consistent style, and Sponberg and 3id
Pearce, who also kicked six goals, were the
best of the bunch. The Toowoomba backs
failed because of the deadness of the insides.
Gilbert at the scrum being the exception.
The five-eighth and the two centres never
attempted to pierce the opposing line, and
it must be said the Light Blue opposites
were almost as ineffectual. Thicknesse, at
the N.S.W. scrum, was the best back on
the field, with full-back McMillan and Queens-
lander Gilbert grouped with him. Much
was expected of the N.S.W. five-eighth Hey.
but though he was perfectly served from the
scrum he rarely made headway. Ihe
wingers were handicapped by the poor play
of the centres, but Gardiner made a better
showing than Delaney. The Queensland wings
suffered from the same starvation tactics.
* * * *
After a week ashore, the Wallabies beat
Natal in the first match of their tour, 14-3.
The visitors played practically their second
team, but might have done better, for Natal
is the weakest side in the Union. Still,
they dominated a fast and' open game, scor-
ing’ three tries to one. * Only one try. was
converted and Queenslander Doneley kicked
a penalty goal. It is not reassuring to read
that Natal had the better of the scrum work,
in view of coming matches.
The combined Australian . Universities
suffered an awful hiding in the third Test
against the M.L. Uni., going down by 44-3
(10 tries, 7 converted, to 2 tries, 1 con-
verted). The team has had a bad time
against the M.L. colleges as well, and prob-
ably the conditions of future tours will have
to be recast.
(Continued on page 30.)
Sydney Uni. won the three-mile eight-oar
championship of the Australian Universi-
ties and the Oxford and Cambridge Cup
from Adelaide and Melbourne on the Nepean
(N.S.W.) on Saturday. With conditions
perfect, the race was a walkoVer for Syd-
ney, which, rowing beautifully, led all the
way, to win by two lengths in the splendid
time of 16min. 29sec.

gold was produced in Western Australia, and
as many new companies are entering into pro-

Footbrawl
“Jolimont”: In spite of the Coulter and
other rules forbidding excessive payments to
Victorian football gladiators, the game is a
costly one to the clubs.. .There has been
agitation for higher admission charges, and
at a meeting of the St. Kilda club recently
one individual remarked that football was,
“as a business proposition,” a snare and a
delusion. Of course, payment of players is
the root of the trouble. A big football, team
costs as much to collect and maintain. in
Melbourne nowadays as a first-class racing
stable.
* * * *
“Hotham”: When it was proposed that
the V.F.A. should go over to the Rugby
Union code an indignant official repudiated
contact with “an imported game.” All foot-
ball is imported. The Australian code
was founded by imported citizens and on
rules imported from English games. One
of the founders was a Harrovian, and the
code in which its followers glory embodies
more of the old Harrow game than of any
other known brand of footer.
* * <* *
“Field Goal”: One feature of Rugby
Union football in Melbourne which intrigues
the foreign barracker from N.S.W. and
Queensland is the constant use of the drop
kick for penalty shots at goal by players
who have begun their football in Australian
rules. The practice is highly successful, and
might be imitated in the older Rugby States,
for drop-kicking is one of the most spec-
tacular features of the handling codes.. In
the League it has practically been abolished
in favor of the punt, while for penalties no-
thing but the place-kick is employed. In the
Union it is only used for running shots from
the field, and not half often enough at that.
# * * *
“Bowen Park” : Queensland Rugby Union
has asked the N.S.W. body to play four
matches in the north during the coming
tour, which commences with the first game
against Queensland at Brisbane on June 24.
The others suggested are v. Brisbane on June
26, Toowoomba on June 28 and Queensland
again on July 1, all to be played in Bris-
bane save the Toowoomba fixture. The
Bananalanders have agreed to the N.S.W.
suggestion for their southern tour —two
games with Ma in Sydney on August 5 and
7 and one with Newcastle on the way back
on August 9.
❖ * * *
“Gate”: The R.L. Board of Control has
made rather an inane gesture in asking its
players for England to contract that they
will forfeit £2OO to the parent body if they
return to England to the Northern Union
clubs within two years of their homing to
Australia. The notion is based on the method
of the Olympic Council, but whereas the
latter has the powers of the Olympic Federa-
tion behind it to enforce the penalty by uni-
versal disqualification, the Rugby League has
none. It would be hopeless to ask its players
to deposit cash or find a good bond. The
contract is a scrap of paper, and the only
chance of enforcing it would be for the
North of England rulers of the professional
code to refuse to hire the defaulting Aus-
tralians. They won’t.
“Valley”: As was only to be expected, the
decision of the Queensland Rugby League
to send the Toowoomba team to Sydney for
the inter-State games has raised a storm of
protest. The other Leagues outside Bris-
bane are using regrettable language. North
Queensland is asking why, if the Queensland
body was too hard up, as it said it was, to
stage a trial game between North and South
for the southern selection, it can find money
for spoonfeeding one country League at the
expense of all the rest. Round about Towns-
ville and the Towers now if you say you
come from Toowoomba you are invited to
have a soft drink in a sundae shop, the
deadliest insult that can be hurled at anyone
in N.Q.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Yarra Yarra” : The Victorian Golf Asso-
ciation is to make another attempt to lure
a team of British golfers to Australia, the
centenary celebrations in Melbourne being
held out as a bait. The proposal is that a
team should reach Perth in November, 1934,
and play there and at Adelaide and the other
State capitals. Then the side would go on
to M.L., returning for a match against Aus-
tralia in Melbourne. It. is possible that a
team of professionals will also be invited,
and the matter of raising a purse for com-
petition by these is to be inquired into.
The N.S,W. amateur golf championships
open this week with the foursomes, 36 holes
of stroke, the battle for the singles title
beginning a week later on June 17. Entries
are heavy, and visitors from other States in-
clude Ivo Whitton and E. G. Schlapp, of
Victoria, and S. A. Keane, of Queensland.
R. H. Bettington, Australian and N.S.W.
champion, will not he here to defend his
title this year.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: Some recent researches
in connection with the force necessary to
drive a golf ball should give some married
men reason to think. For a 230-yard drive-
off, a force of two tons to the square inch
was exerted. So now, when friend husband
tries to excuse • himself from mowing the
lawn, wifey can refer to that ‘ screamer
he told her he drove in the club medal_ com-
petition the day before, and request him to
put a couple of tons into getting the grass
into a respectable condition. Incidentally,
the ball took five seconds to cover the dis-
tance, or four times as long as Malcolm
Campbell’s Bluebird. ,
“Carnoustie”: The British golfing world
sat up and took notice the other day, when
the first woman professional to figure in
a British golf tournament hopped into the
“Leeds 1000 Guineas” against the pick ot
the professionals. Poppy. Wingate that
is her intriguing name —quickly hopped out
again, taking 90 for the first qualifying
round. In the same round Abe Mitchell
headed the 208 competitors with a 67—-a
record for the Leeds course and a hot one
anywhere.
THEY SPOKE IN WHISPERS.
“Who’s the girl friend?”
“That’s Joan. I’ve known her since she was so wide."
“Sandringham”: There, is no doubt the
Victorian golfing girls are going . into the
matter of importing a team of British golt-
erettes in wholehearted fashion. The other
day associates held a golf meeting at the
Yarra Yarra club to raise funds. Over 150
players turned up and, what with one thing
and another, there was over £lOO to put
in the till at the end of the day. The fund
being built up now amounts to £4OO, and
four figures are confidently predicted before
the end of the season.
... * * *
“Driventfski” : The Professional Golf Asso-
ciation does not intend to take any action
in regard to the, N.S.W. Golf Councils
resolution throwing open competitions to
professionals who are not members of the
P.G.A. (B. 31/5/’33). The P.G.A. has
announced that whereas it used to guarantee
the ability and bona fides of its members,
the onus of deciding whether a professional
applicant is a fit and proper person to com-
pete in events now lies on the G.C. Ihus,
if a mysterious person in the course of a
round suddenly pulls the Bed Flag out of
the hole, and starts shouting about the
wrongs of the proletariat, and turns out to
be Jock Garden or Alby Willis in disguise
why, the rest is up to the G.C. and not
to the P.G.A.
“Brassey”: That the young player gets
better opportunities of learning golf on the
outside courses than in the big cl ty
is by the fact that the first five
-iris to finish in the N.S.W. junior women s
championships come from country clubs.
The winner was Barbara Donkin, of Moss
Vale club, while G. Metcalfe, of the same
club, won the scratch competition for girls
who had never playedin a
before, with a card of 193 for the 06 holes.
The junior champion, who is 17. am me
two rounds in 182, and both were
performances considering the stron e and
gusty westerlies. ______
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone” : If Kosciusko didn’t
shriek when McGrath and Quist f eU in the
doubles of the French tennis championships
last week, the Sydney press made up tor it.
The voungsters did splendidly to reach the
finals' with Englishman Perry and Hughes
as the opposition, and were expected
win. They went down, however, by three
sets to one, picking up the third afterios-
ing the first two, and taking the fourth to
7-5. The games were 21-17 m the wmneis
favor.
“Centre Court” : G. P. Hughes, who with
countryman Perry won the French doubles
championship in Paris, is a genuine toj -
notcher. He first appeared m Britain 1 3
1931 Davis Cup team and won all the Ita-
lian championships that year, beating
Cocliet. Partner F. J. Perry started as
a ping-pong star. He has come to the front
quickly, and last year had a successful tour
with Bunny Austin in the States. He wa^
ranked third to Cocliet and Austin in the
Yankee list of seeded players in the national
championships.
“Physiog”: Someone asked Helen Wills-
Moody if she was going to take on La
Lenglen in the suggested challenge match
between the pair. Helen, who is much the
younger, said she would if the amateur rules
allowed her, but added that she didn’t think
the match would be fair. “You see,” she
added sweetly, “Suzanne has been out ot
tennis for so long.” Miaouw!
;!» ij: v
“St. Colombe”: It was thought that the
limit in bad sportsmanship had been reached
by Germany when the tennis authorities of
that country dropped Prenn out of their
Davis Cup team because he was of Jewish
origin. It has been left for Von Cramm
to rub in the insult by scratching
for the French championships because
Prenn was an entrant. Foreigners enter-
ing this championship and others of a
national character do so 'as private indi-
viduals, and there was no question of
national feeling in the action taken by Yon
Cramm.
“Kooyong” : After much backing and fill-
ing. the Australian tennis authorities have
decided that our Davis Cup team will visit
neither America nor Japan, but will come
straight back home when the British and
Continental engagements are over. The
American terms for the tour of the fcraxe
were too tight and the dates desired
Japan would have thrown the players out
of some of the important fixtures at home.
There can be no particular objection to cut-
ting out America, which has often done tn
same thing by this country, but we owe
Nippon a return call and it must be pai
soon.
Car and Cycle
“Differential”: The populace greatly de-
siring to see bis famous Bluebird in
action, Malcolm Campbell recently took the
world’s fastest car for an exhibition spin
round Brooklands track. There was nearly
a disaster at the start when priming petrol
sprayed on to a red-hot exhaust, but tne
blaze was quickly extinguished and Campbell
did his stunt. Later, he said that it was
one of the hardest drives of his career
his trouble was keeping the huge flyer down
to 100 m.p.h. Yet it is only 30. years since
motorists were breaking their necks
literally in some cases —to get up to tnat
figure. ,
“Whizz” : America’s only big motor race,
the Indianapolis 500, was won last week
by L. Meyer, of California. Horty-one
started and Meyer covered the 500 miles on
the circular brick track in 4hr. 48mm., aver-
aging 104.16 m.p.h. This is a record for
the race, F. Frame having taken 3scc.
longer to do the distance in last years
event. The big race, which drew IOOAIPJ
people, was marred by a fatal accident, Mar k
Billman and his mechanic being killed when
their car ran off the track through the
guard fence.
“Deemster” : The Isle of Man T.T. races
this month have four Australian rideis
going for the gloves, though two of them are
non-official. Pringle and Weatherby carry
the official brand 'and the others are A.
Simcock, of Victoria, who has been in Eng-
land for some years, and A. Bruce, of Yar-
raville, who is entered in the sidecar event.
A feature of the racing will be the number
of foreign machines, mostly ridden by
Britons. Usually the Continental rideis
give this event a miss, but among the men
from outside this time are Aranda and Moxo,
both foremost Spanish riders.
* * *
“Hotham”: That road-racing battle be-
tween Adelaide and Melbourne (B.
31/5/’S3) has received the belated atten-
tion of the Victorian John Hops. There is
a penalty of £5O, and in future the Act
governing the matter is to be rigorously
enforced. Publication of a result in a news-
paper or otherwise is sufficient proof of the
charge. After his latest attempt, Barr was
invited to a consultation by the Melbourne
police force and had to sign an undertaking
not to attempt any future road records
within the bounds of the Cabbage Garden.
Miscellaneous
“Pentathlon”: That fine Sydney Univer-
sity athlete J. P. Metcalfe capped a series
of good performances in the inter-Umversity
spoils in Sydney and a subsequent matcli
between Universities and a N.S.W. team
by putting up a second Australian record
in a week, that for the hop, step and jump.
In the ’Varsity sports he had hoisted new
figures for the high jump, but he failed m
an attempt on Winter’s hop, step and jump
record of 49ft. 84in. in the match against
N.S.W. Another attempt was made a few
days later under official observation, and
this time he succeeded with 50ft. 2-Jin. The
world’s and Olympic records are. 51ft. 7m.
by the Japanese Chuhi Nambi at Los
Angeles last year. If Metcalfe disregards
events such as shot-putting and javelin-
throwing, which he at present attempts, the
world’s jumping records may not be beyond
his reach, for he is only a youngster and
one with an eye ever fixed on improving
style and methods.
$ * *
“Abingdon”: Frith’s drawing of “Cape
Bruce” (B. 31/5/’33) reminds me that our
Stanley is tlie only Prime Minister to have
figured in the historic Oxford-Cambridge
boatrace. He was in the winning Light
Blue eight in 1904. A close runner-up was
W. 11. Waddington, Premier of France in
1879, and a famous ambassador. Of Eng-
lish descent, he was sent to Rugby and
Trinity (Cam.), rowing No. 6 in the Cam-
bridge boat in 1849. the year in which the
only foul chronicled in the race occurred.
It was a matter of bad steering by the Cam-
bridge cox. Cambridge won. but Oxford
was awarded the race.

Too Old At
Vitality comes this
simple way
The unforgivable sin to-day is to be “too
old.” Yet young women—men, too—find
themselves just “worn-out” when they
should be at the zenith of a happy, healthy
life.
You want to enjoy life. You want to let
others find you fit and vigorous. Yon don’t
want to be an “always-ill” wife or an “ever-weak”
husband.
Young men and women, finding capacity for
work or pleasure destroyed by constant down-
ra ggiug pain, weakness, back-breaking body
pains, agony to move or turn, bad nights perhaps,
and serious worries such as bladder trouble; most
surely you should realise that the kidneys lie at the
seat of your trouble.
Rheumatism, too, “the illness with a hundred
symptoms ; starting perhaps with sharp twinges
of pain in the muscles, the trouble, if neglected,
will develop until every movement of the body
seems just sheer agony.
Joints swell and become stiff, muscles ache
and burn, the back seems almost ready to break—all day there is constant down-
dragging pain and at night the tortured nerves refuse to sink to sleep.
Modern science has conclusively proved that the cause of rheumatism lies in
the blood. Poisons, such as uric acid in excess, harmful bacteria and toxins, are
carried through the system. In the case of uric acid, the tiny razor-edged crystals
are deposited in joints, etc., which flash to the brain their pain-struck symbols of
distress.
Weak kidneys, what misery they cause. If they are not filtering and purifying
the system they are allowing uric acid and other poisons to accumulate. That
is why you have pain night and day. That is why you feel and. look “too-old.”
It is no use doping the system with drugs, pick-me-ups or purgatives in the
hope of getting back new vigour, when the trouble lies within the system, through
faulty kidney action. There are thousands of men and women suffering daily
untold agonies” because of kidney trouble in one form or another who could
end their trouble in a very simple way. The only possible means of doing this
is to cleanse the body of pain-giving poisons, and that is a function the kidneys
must carry out.
HI
Years Roll [Rack
It is the testimony of not one but thousands
of one-time sufferers which enables us to state that
if you will commence a course with a simple
straightforward remedy, De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be
ended.
It does not matter how long you have suffered
or what disappointments you may have had in the
past—get a bottle of De Witt’s Pills to-day and
start strengthening the kidneys, toning up your
nervous system and building once again the real
foundations of health.
Why forego the pleasures of life? Why
continue in constant nerve-destroying pain?
be weak and ailing?
If you persevere with this tried and trusted,
40-year-old remedy, you will find your old, tired,
“worn-out” feeling replaced by new vigour and
vitality. Your day’s work will be a pleasure and
your spare-time pleasures doubled. No more
sallow, spotty complexion, no more sleepless
nights, no more stabs in the. back. No more
rheumatic pains, bad back, bladder troubles.
Try just one bottle of De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills and prove this. If within 24 hours
from the first dose you cannot see (from colour of
urine) that they have started their health action,
return the partly-used bottle to the manufacturers
and your money will be refunded in full.
This guaranteed remedy has been tried and trusted for over 40 years. It can
be taken by the very young, the weakest, the oldest and women at' all times, with
confidence. No dangerous drugs or purgatives, but a scientific preparation that
will do you good from the very first dose.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
When Royalty has a birthday it dips into
its bag and pulls out C.M.G.’s and 0.8.E.’5,
knighthoods and such, which it hands round
with liberality. Lots of Sydney people are
all dolled up with orders and titles since the
publication of the Birthday Honors list. The
wives of ex-Premier Bavin (she was a Miss
Winchcombe) and of Justice Harvey (she
was a Miss Ward, daughter of a one-time
Registrar-General) have both joined the
ever-lengthening list of knights’ ladies. Mrs.
A. C. Godhard, who was Mona Daley, secre-
tary of the Crown-street Women’s Hospital,
will now have a glittering 0.8. E. for the
front af her evening frocks. This is a recog-
nition ,of her work in charitable and welfare
causes. Matron Boissier, of the Royal
Prince Alfred, one of Australia’s earliest
Royal Red Crossers, has accpiired an M.B.E.
Padre John Flynn, of the Australian Inland
Mission, and Padre Stanley Drummond, who
interests himself in the Far West children’s
health scheme, have also been handed baubles
from Windsor.
The Lady Mayoress’s card party in aid of
the clothing fund which bears her name was
a huge success. Sixteen hundred people
turned up in the glory of purple and fine
linen, aide “Gill” among them, smiling rosily.
With him came a bevy of pretty young
things. The Lud Mayor’s lady was elegant
in ivory angel-skin lace warmed by a cerise
jaekette and a fur coat. Daughter Margaret
was lovely in grey, and father looked on her
with a proud eye. The bridge players brought
their own fodder, and everyone was happy.
There was a prize list simply bursting with
good things: a sea voyage to any Australian
port, an S.T.C. radio, silk hose, perfumery
and orders for photographs by Rene Pardon.
Town Clerk Hendy was in command, and
everything, above and below stairs —there
were tables and players everywhere—went
on wheels oiled with smiles.
One of the gifts to her fund touched Mrs.
Hagon deeply. It was the blanket knitted by
Y.A.L. girls while they were on their recent
tour of North Queensland and the Barrier
Reef. Dame Mary Cook, who chaperoned the
girls, had a hand in the making of the gift,
into which are knitted the. League colors,
gold, purple and green. It is further orna-
mented with the badge of the League.
This Letter has decided that woman of
to-day isn’t half so cunning in the wiles of
sex as were the belles of 95 years ago. David
Jones’s, being 95 years of age, has turned back
the pages of the old fashion books and built
again the frills, the furbelows and farth-
ingales which the firm’s seamstresses and
tailors, long dead, cut and stitched for
beauty that long since has gone to make
food for roses. Slim-waisted and elegant,
presently came the Du Maurier and Tenniel
women; not quite so arty, but more vividly
alive, came the belles that Phil May’s pencil
caught for the old pages of The Bulletin.
Trains and bustles, amazingly flounced
frocks in thick rich-looking moires in the
lobelia blues, the' crushed strawberry tones
that great-grandmother found so fascinating.
Then came another influence. Over dresses,
still long and trained, but slimmer of outline,
were draped or flung negligently long ostrich-
feather boas. “Oh!” a woman exclaimed,
“that’s the Boer War influence. We all wore
ostrich feathers when our husbands and
sweethearts came home. My sweetheart (he’s
now my husband) brought me a lovely lot.”
How style influences the deportment!
According to the architecture of her skirt
woman has minced, languished, pattered and
tottered (the hobble-skirt period) through
the ages. Now she walks free and unfet-
tered in sports skirts or in hiking and ski-
ing trousers.
The clubrooms of the Catholic Women’s
Association were crowded one afternoon last
week when the members gathered to fare-
well Dr. Cattaneo, the Apostolic Delegate,
who has bridged the link between the Vati-
can and Australia for 16 years. Dr. Cat-
taneo, who left last Monday by the Romolo,
took with him as a memento of the associa-
tion a writing-table outfit in mulga wood.
An autograph album inscribed with the
names of the members will be, he said, one of
his treasured possessions.
Dame Barlow presided and had two
speeches to make, one of godspeed to the
delegate and one of greeting to Mrs. J. A.
Lyons, wife of the Prime Minister. This
guest of honor, who arrived late, was dressed
in cigar-brown velvet and brown furs, and in
her answering speech she struck the original
note of appealing for sympathy and en-
' couragement for the about-to-be mother. In
a world clamorous with arguments in favor
of birth-control, a standard-raiser in the
cause of motherhood deserves three cheers.
One of the most interesting happenings of
last week for those kiddies of the outback
who get their schooling by correspondence
was the beginning of the educational broad-
cast service. It was a great event for t
teachers, too, for, no doubt, many of them
who have so far been limited to the written
word in trying to clear the mists from the
brains of Jenny and Jimmy will now have a
chance to get in touch with their pupils by
word of mouth. The first lecture by Mr. F.
AVood, of Sydney Uni., came over the air in
thin clear tones, and he told his listeners Ot.
battles long ago. He started Ins history talk
at the time-worn milestone lObb, and re-
assembled the Battle of Hastings in fine
style.
Renee Rich, Sydney’s accomplished young
violinist, who has toured under otanlejr
McKay’s management on several occasions
during the last eight years, had a great sur-
prise in Maoriland. In Christchurch she
gave a recital of classical music, and an
elderly Frenchman in the audience was
warm in his admiration. _ Bator in Auck-
land she received from him, as a farewell
gift a mellow violin —possibly a ©trad., but
at any rate a violin of very old Italian make.
The gift has a curious appropriateness com-
ing from Maoriland, as it was on a former
journey to AVellington that Renee s luggage
met with mishap and her violin was lost.
Maggie Teyte, the English soprano now
on her way to Sydney in the Orsova, has a
special link with Australia, as she was the
one woman artist who sang at Melbas
memorial service in St. Colomba’s. I ond-
street, Bondon. Miss Teyte sang Schubert s
“Ave Maria” to Arthur Mason’s organ
accompaniment. She is one of the few lnter-
national operatic prima donnas England lia.s
produced. It was she who created the part
of Melisande in Debussy’s “Pelleas and Meli-
sande.’”
Miss Garnaut, the discoverer and only
teacher of Philip Hargrave, is a modest
person who claims no undue attention as the
instructor of genius. She is Australian and
has never been outside of her native country
for musical study—all she knows, and it
is a deep store, she learned in Adelaide —but
she has decided that Philip shall have the
advantages of foreign travel and study
abroad. The Garnauts are a musical family.
Miss Garnaut’s grandmother was the first
woman organist in Port Adelaide. Each ot
her three sisters has had a child who has
carried off the Elder scholarship. Helena
Fisher, a pretty young niece touring with
her aunt, had the distinction of having the
Elder travelling scholarship held open for
12 months for her, but decided against leav-
ing Australia. Miss Garnaut has been direct-
in! the S.A. eaglet’s course for about five
years During two of these she was an in-
valid, and it was from a bed on wheels that
she supervised his training in this period.
The Bulletin introduces the latest hos-

to its readers.
Tresco, like
Government
House, wel-
comes a new
lady every
few years, for
the old Eliza-
b e t h Bay
home with its
lawns that run
down to Port
Jackson i s
part of the
Navy. The
lady in this
Dorothy Wel-
ding photo-
graph is Mrs.
C. J. Pope,
whose husband
is the present
Captain - Sup-
erintendent of
Sydney. Already the two are at home in
Sydney’s social world.
No Australian woman has made such
moneyed marriages as Mrs. Cavendish, who
is to wed Lord Furness this month. As
lovely Enid Lindeman, daughter of the
N.S.W. vigneron whose historic cellars are
in Sydney, she married Roderick Cameron,
an eldeidy American millionaire, over 20
years ago. After his death she married
Colonel Cavendish, of the 9th Lancers, who,
in addition to being rewarded for a brilliant
war record with the coveted command of the
Ist Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot, was a
wealthy English landowner. Viscount Fur-
ness owns the steamship line —or most of it
—which bears his family name, and he is
one of northern England’s biggest steel mag-
nates.
Sir Claud Severn, who died the other day
at his home near Oxford, was a cousin of
the late “Monty” Severn. I-Ie went to school
at St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, and entered
the British Foreign Office after coming down
from Cambridge. Most of his working life
was spent in Malaya or thereabouts. He was
Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong when he
retired with a C.M.G. and K.B.E. in 1926.
He had the good looks and friendly disposi-
tion of his family and an inherited love of
art. His father instituted the Dudley Gal-
lery Art Society in London.
Palm Beach surfers played pretend at
their hop last week, and in imagination
danced in one of King Neptune’s subter-
ranean halls. That must have been the idea,
for up aloft white seagulls disported on the
crest of rippling green waves. The waves
were made of green paper and were an effec-
tive foil for the gulls, which were the work
of Bryam Mansell, an ardent member of the
Palm Beach Surf Club. He was also respons-
ible for the new banner, which was, together
with the club’s pennant, brought all the way
from Palm Beach, one of the striking decora-
tions. The Blaxland Galleries were crowded,
the frocking was particularly smart and
the Adrian Curlewis couple, the John Mants,
the Graham Prattens and the Percy Hunters
were among the blithe and the free.
By the death of Miss Soubeiran the French
community in Sydney has lost one of its
most outstanding personalities. The tall,
handsome and forceful lady was justly famed
for her work during the war and post-war
years on behalf of its French victims. It
was she who germinated the idea for the
French-Australian League of Help, one of
the notable patriotic movements, and it was
Miss Soubeiran whom the league sent to
France to administer the fund. In 1917 she
left Australia on this labor of love, return-
ing a year or so later as a member of the
French Mission which had for its leader
General Pau. France and her good work
there called her again, but in 1920 she came
back to Australia, and since then had spent
most of her time in her cottage at Bowral.
This has been a place of pilgrimage for
French residents in Sydney. An older gen-
eration remembers Miss Soubeiran as the
vivid young Frenchwoman who, with the
equally gifted Miss Gurney, established Kam-
bala, the well-known school for girls at Rose
Bay.
When the loan exhibition of antiques for
the Kindergarten Union opens, the subject
of this pic-
ture, Elizabeth
Ratlionyi, will
be beard play-
ing the harp.
The music to
accompany the
old china tab-
leaux designed
by Mrs. Ster-
ling Levis will
jhave an old-
world flavor;
the Violin of
Claire Tr a-
venne and the
dulcitone
played by Mrs.
Evelyn Grieg,
i n company
with the harp,
will decant
early English
music. T h e
Ming, willow,
Chelsea, Bow, Stafford, Dresden and other
notable periods will be posed by groups of
young girls and small children. The blue
and white of Wedgwood will have the advan-
tage of a frieze by Fred Deist. Photo, from

One of the most ambitious presentations
given on the Sydney amateur stage was that
of E. F. Benson’s “Passion Play.” The Aus-
tral Players made the effort and proved
amazingly successful, even in such scenes as
the Last Supper, the Nativity and the Child
Christ in the Temple. They also infused
an atmosphere of reverent poignancy into
their tableau of the Crucifixion. Will
Caspers, conductor of St. Mary’s Gathedral
choir, led a finely-attuned orchestra in the
music from “Parsifal” and such like. Little
Doctor Pettorelli, lent to Sydney by Rome
in the interests of church music, made his
last public appearance as a musician in
Sydney. During the Crucifixion scene he led
a choir from St. Mary’s in the “Stabat
Mater.” The doctor left for Rome last
Monday.
The engagement of the week that is caus-
ing a wide ripple of excitement is that of
Margaret, younger daughter of the Mayoral
Hagons, and John, only s f on of the late Wil-
liam Collins and of Mrs. Willie Collins, of
Beaudesert (Q.). Margaret is tall and fair,
and wears her clothes well. To a dance at
the Rose Bay Golf Club on Saturday friends
of both are bidden.
David Jones’s ballroom was the scene of
brilliant action on Saturday evening, when
the commander and officers of the Second
Division of the A.M.F. rallied to their
battalion colors, and danced the hours away.
Flags and other military insignia made the
vistas gay and colorful, and tables were
decked with battalion emblems. There was
a fanfare of trumpets to herald the approach
of the Lieutenant-Governor and Lady Street.
Mrs. Keating and Charles Rosenthal’s lady
handed on the three debs, to the foot of
the dais, whence they were wafted- with
smiles into the social pasture. Tim Navy
as well as the Military turned up in full
feather; decorations glowed and glinted, and
the seven hundred or so dancers declared
it the success of the season. Captain J.
Kendall was secretary of the affair.
At the end of little Philip Hargrave’s con-
cert on Saturday the Town Hall steps were
jambed with admirers refusing to go hope
till they gave a parting cheer to young genius
on its way to its car. Philip came down the
steps swinging his great laurel wreath, from
which a cluster of balloons bobbed and
soared. An old concertgoer says there, has
never been such a waiting crowd of admirers
since the John McCormack nights. Ihe
youngster is utterly unspoiled; there s no-
thing of conceit or self-consciousness about
him. The other day he was left at Nichol-
son’s for an hour’s practice, and the grown-
ups who were to call for him were half an
hour late in turning up. When they arrived
they found the kid having rides up and down
with the liftman. On Friday he went to
the Town Hall to practise for his concert.
An attendant rushed up with the offer ot
hot water for the fingers. Without such
ablution no other visiting pianist to his
knowledge liked to start his rehearsing. But
the youngster opened wide eyes, shook his
hands from the wrists and said, “Oh, there re
all right, thanks,” and started m, on his
arpeggios. To the attendant’s surprise,just
a little more than an hour later the lid, of
the piano was down and Philip was skipping
off. Adult stars have been known to work
for six and eight hours in the Town Hall
on the day previous to a recital.
“Nine to Six,” a play pre-eminently
suited to presentation by a girls’ school, has
been seized upon by the Doone students toi
their next entertainment for charity. I here
are 16 characters, and not one male in the
cast The Bush Book Club will benefit,
and Anne Gordon, an ex-Dooneite, has been
chosen for the young Cockney girl around
whom the drama revolves.
If it comes to a matter of dates the loan
exhibition of antiques, to be opened m
Dymock’s building on June 20 in aid ol the
Kindergarten Union, is satisfactorily
“behind the times.” There will be on view,
for instance, a Sino Hittite seal, which repre-
sents the civilisation of the Euphrates some
2000 ycqrs ago, and a set of little, vials dug
up near Bethlehem, which is a little older
still The old Clyde Bridge, the finest thing
of its kind in 1200 or so, finds place in a
chair made from its hoary timbers. Another
chair to be shown is one presented by Ivmg
George IV. to one Peter Dobree for services
to the Court. Some exquisite ivories are
to be on view, including a seventeenth-cen-
tury Madonna of Spanish ivory—a piece
well-known to Christie’s. In the matter ot
dress there is a gay “Sac-back” brocade
gown of 1740-50, while of porcelain and pot-
tery, furniture, bronze, weapons, silver and
plate, there is no end.. Six silver Armada
spoons are genuine Elizabethan, having re-
posed in the same family plate chest ever
since arriving in Australia in the very early
’eighties, but these in turn have their noses
put out of joint by a ladle which came over
to England with Norman William m 1066.
Over 3000 musiclovers squeezed into the
Town Hall on Sunday afternoon to listen to
the concert in aid of the unemployed musi-
cians. But as the entrance fee was only a
silver coin the takings won’t go far. Some
people have funny ways of enjoying a con-
cert. One girl read a biography of Stalin
throughout the programme; several misses
knitted without ceasing. Possibly neither
of these pastimes interferes with listening.
Bananaland bits :
The post-graduate course under the eye of the
B.M.A. was inaugurated with a party at Lennon a.
President Dr. Alex. Murphy and Mrs. Murphy did
the welcoming, she in old rose mariette. Curled and
tinted swan’s feathers made a cape to Mrs. Ellis
Murphy’s pale pink ; Mrs. R. E. Weaver chose raisin-
colored silk lace; Mrs. E. S. Meyers was in butter-
cup gold; pale-pink taffetas and a deeper pink leis
was worn by Mrs. A. G. Anderson. Dr. Archie
Aspinall (Sydney) and Professor Marshall Allan
(Melbourne) were amongst the many doctors present.
Doris Waraker’s Australian bush play, “And Two
Shall Meet,” was played by the Toowoomba Reper-
tory Society with marked success. This pretty
Spanish-eyed little lady is rapidly coming to the
fore; “Restitution,” another of her dramas, is to
be staged shortly by the Hobart Repertoriaus.

BACKACHE CRIPPLES
Drive out the Cause and Enjoy Life
os others Older than You are Doing!
Don’t throw away years of your life by
neglecting the danger of rheumatism. This
trouble is worse than painful, it is deadly,
and brooks no delay if you are to escape its
worst consequences. Its cause is usually
uric acid, which brings on crippling backache,
joint swellings, stiffness and misery; pains
down the groins, along the arms, in the wrists
and feet. All due to uric acid, the result of
kidney breakdown. With the neglect of these
ills, come bladder and urinary disorders, sedi-
lqent, deposits, gravel, stone —and untold
agony. See a doctor if you can; if you can’t,
take Harrison’s Pills, the remedy of a noted
Loudon Physician; a prescription that has
enabled long-standing sufferers to throw away
their crutches, while others, given up as in-
curable, have found grateful relief from
Harrison’s Pills where all else had failed.,
This remedy gives quick relief by driving out
the cause of the trouble; it is safe even for
the old and infirm. Try Harrison’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills to-day. Three sizes, at
2/-, 3/-, and 5/-. Money back if you don’t
get benefit from the first bottle.

In honor of Cynthia Brookes and her
fiance, Lud Mayor Smith, Antony and Colin,
sons of Frank Clarke and his lady, staged
a dance at their parents’ home, South Yarra.
Miss Brookes wore a crinkled crepe and
velvet frock of pale blue; and .grey velvet,
fashioned with a small cape, was worn by the
Clarke lady. Valerie Clarke was in a dainty
taffeta frock of enamel-green line. Mrs. John
()ldliam had a shower of rhinestones upon
her flowered-silk mousseline gown. The
Robert Knoxes were there, she in black
velvet > also the lately-married Pat Fair-
bairn couple, the lady’s vellum velvet gown
having a wide rose-red velvet belt; Mr. and
Mrs. E. Hayne and Mr. and Mrs. Baynes
Dickson, jun. Sandra Shacked danced in
jade-green georgette; Sheila Creswick in
wii ite organdie and satin ; Diana Knox in
begonia-crinkled crepe, and Valmai Wood,
from Perth, in enamel-green angel-skin.
The Forty Club opened its career with a
dance at what used to be known as. the
Green Mill, which has become the club’s
headquarters. The president of the club
is Nancy Sutherland, and Beth Thwaites is
the secretary. A dramatic circle will be a
feature of the movement; readings of plays
on Sunday nights will be regular happen-
ings. and performances for philanthropic
objects are on the agenda.
Past and present students of the Albert-
street Con. welcomed Fritz Hart on liis
return from his second successful season
as guest-conductor of the Symphony Orches-
tra at Honolulu. The only music of the
evening was that for dancing, and an inter-
lude was a comedy sketch by two member,--
°f the opera class. Nancy Ingliam and Doreen
Keidy. The president of the Students’ Asso-
ciation, W. G. Donald offered greeting to the
director.
Mrs. Hart was in grey brocaded silk with
a silver lame coat. Others in the throng were
Mr. and Mrs. Basil Hart, Mr. and Mrs.
Esmond Kieruan, Thomas Brentnall, Mrs.
Napier Waller, the Sprys, Captain and
Mrs. Bussell Jackson and Adele Levy.
“The Ten Fives” is the name given to a
social club _ formed the other day with the
object of aiding the Lord Somers Commem-
oration League to maintain its ward in tlie
b rankston Children’s Hospital. The league
received help with its work from a dance
at Prahran Town Hall organised by members
of the Masters’ Association, with C.
Salo at their head. Special guests were the
Lud Mayor and fiancee Cynthia Brookes.
Mayor Cole, of Prahran, and Mrs. Cole and
Mr. and Mrs. Warren Kerr.
Delegates to the League of Nations Union
conference and a few others gathered about
the luncheon table at the Lyceum Club at
the invitation of Harrison Moore, president
of (lie union, and his lady. African mari-
golds in crystal bowls and primrose-tinted
mats gave a cheery note to the board.
At the Collins-street kirk on Thursday
afternoon, Muriel, younger daughter of the
late George
Bussell and of
Mrs. George
B. Blackwood,
of I.angi,Willi,
e x c h a n ged
vows with
Ewen, son of

tinue of ten
at ten dants
graded from
small children
to grown-ups.
Mary Bussell,
cousin of the
bride and
daughter of
Philip Bussell,
was chief ’maid,
comp anioned
by Jacqueline, daughter of the Ken Mackin-
nons, of Tintaldra. Two schoolgirls, Cecile
Beid and Virginia Bussell, were next in
order, and then there were six small child-
ren—■ John and Elizabeth Yencken, James
and Bosemary Bussell, Patience Fairbairn
(daughter of Major and Mrs. C. O. Fair-
fairii, _ of Banongil. Skipton), and Peter
Guthrie. A Ronald Esler camera made this
portrait of tlie bride.
In the kirk was a central arch of white
chrysanthemums banked with autumn foliage,
and tall green feathery wattle trees uprose
at intervals about the pews. Ivory-tinted
velvet that flowed into a long train was the
wedding gown. From a coronet of upstand-
ing sprigs of lily of the valley and orange
buds swept a lengthy veil of Brussels point
lace and tulle, and a shower bouquet of
lilies of the valley was carried. Velvet of
the same sort was chosen for the frocks of
the bridesmaids, who wore wreaths of green
leaves. The three small girls wore Kate
Greenaway frocks and their partners were
in frilly, white silk shirts allied to long
trousers of pale green velvet. The service
was fully choral; and the newlyweds had a
troop of Girl Guides—the Ist Skipton Com-
pany with staves flying the Mackinnon
tartan—as guard of honor when they left
the church.
About 400 guests were bidden to the
after-tea party at No._ 9, decked for the
occasion with poinsettias and carnations.
Mrs. G. It. Blackwood’s gown was of dark
Burgundy hue, sable collared and topped by
a velvet toque. Her elder daughter, Mrs.
Arthur Yencken, whose husband has been
appointed First Secretary and Head of
Chancery at the Residency, Cairo, Egypt,
was present in suit and millinery blending
tones of brown and fawn. The bridegroom’s
mother, Mrs. D. Mackinnon, who was accom-
panied by her daughter Marie, came in black
tailored costume, her black hat having a
niching of grey velvet. Among the guests
were the Irvine lady, companioned by Mr.
and Mrs. W. Irvine; Lud Mayor Smith ; the
Miller lady, looking regal in black velvet and
alike millinery; George Fairbairn and his
lady; Major and Mrs. Alan Currie, of Ercil-
doune; the Edwin Curries, of Galla; Mrs.

Brookes, and Captain and Mrs. Aarons,
from Sydney.
The half-yearly sale of articles made by
sightless workers was staged at the Braille
Library, and was opened by Mrs. F. W.
Head, wife of the Archbishop of Melbourne.
Mrs. Bussell Grimwade and Miss 11. L.
Aitken, members of the committee of the
Braille Writers’ Association, welcomed Mrs.

winter berries and foliage. In the throng
were the association’s lion, sec., Millicent
Bitchie, and the librarian, Miss M. Crabb,
with other office-bearers.
Dorothy, only daughter of the E. F.
Brinds, of Mentone, set a new fashion in
bridal array when she wedded Stanley, son
of the David Carnegies, of Kew. Over her
trained gown of water-lily green delustred
velvet poured a tulle veil of the same tone
secured with a wreath of orange buds. Her
three attendant ’maids, in primrose-tinted
frocks, wore wreaths of green hydrangea.
After-rejoicings were at Grosvenor.

Building alterations along that busy sec-
tion of Bourke-street, on the north side,
between the old, G.P.O. and Rnssell-street,
will continue for some months, to the joy
of the artisans engaged and to be engaged.
Myers’ extensions, next to the post-office,
wall take some time. Buckley and Nunn
have decided to make the Ijest use of their
freehold and enlarge by going skyward. Not
choosing to exercise an option to continue
a lease for a 66ft. frontage adjoining their
freehold, B. and N. left an opening which
the G. J. Coles Co. has been quick to till.
It suited the Coles crowd to seize a chance
on the north side of this block, as the lease
for its No. 2, or smaller store, on the other
side is expiring.
After living abroad for many years, Mrs.
Margaret Costello (nee Lawrence) is re-
turning to Melbourne in the Orsova, due on
July 3. She is accompanied by her daughters
Joan and Mary, and her son Pat. Her hus-
band, formerly the manager of the National
Bank in London, died early this year. Mrs.
Costello will make her home in Melbourne.
That breezy Maoriland journalist and
author Nolle Scanlan, now well established
in London, gave this city a fleeting glance
during the week. Some local presswomen
met over the luncheon table at the Lyceum
Club in her honor, when the travelled guest’s
repertoire of anecdote and incident was
hugely enjoyed.
Winter arrived in cold, stern reality last
week, the lowest temperature for 22 years
being recorded. Within an hour’s journey
of the city, at Macedon and elsewhere on the
hills, there was snowballing.
Once more the stately pile of Government
House on St. Kilda-road is tenantless, the
Education Department’s tenure having come
to an end. The 600 students who comprised
the Melbourne Girls’ High School are now
temporarily installed at the West Melbourne
High School.
Mrs. Griffiths Lloyd, Vic. president of the
W.C.T.U., and other office-bearers put on
the kettle at headquarters to welcome
Dorothy Parkin, an English worker for the
cause. Miss Parkin, who hails from York-
shire, is on a world’s tour of the union’s
branches.
Necklets have taken a new form. The
latest examples are in collarette style,
fashioned into a sort of embroidery of tiny
beads. They are chiefly for use with high-
necked frocks. The design is generally
worked out in a couple of colors, and occa-
sionally assumes a tie form, with tassels.
Some are woven with a fringed edge.
Margie, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. O. S,
Boss, of Koslyn, Willgul, left in the Ormonde
for London, there to keep a wedding date
with Dr, E. H. W. Deane, of Melbourne,
at present . assistant-superintendent of
Wrightington Hospital. Lancashire. He is
a son of the late Dr. E. W. Deane, of Mary-
borough (Vic.), and of Mrs. Deane, of
Melbourne.
When royalty, a new Governor, or a
visitor of importance comes to Melbourne
it is customary to land him from the steamer
by means of a launch at St. Ivilda and im-
press him as he motors to the city by the
beauty of St. Kilda-road and the magnifi-
cence qf Prince’s bridge. This “side door”
entry has offended not only Port Melbourne,
where mail steamers are berthed, but the
western end of Melbourne. A centenary pro-
posal which Councillor Kane, of Melb. City
Council and of the hundredth-year birthday
committee, says is to be adopted provides for
a “front-door” route from Port Melb. pier to
Collins-street. The exact route is a sub-
ject of speculation.
Executing a design in mosaic is some-
thing like solving a jigsaw puzzle. For the
panels which Mr. Napier Waller is making
on the front of Newspaper House in Collins-
street, a half-ton of the tesserae has been
used. All the thousands of dice-shaped little
pieces of colored marble have to be put in
place by hand. In this work .Mr. Waller
has had the help of his wife, an artist whose
specialty is the designing and making of
stained-glass windows. With a little outside
help the couple have worked every spare
moment night and day for five months. Mr.
Waller’s time is largely taken up at the
Workingmen’s College where he is art
master.
Dr. Dorothy Speer, from U.S.A., arrived
in the Corfu. She’s a Ph.D. of Johns Hop-
kins, and has been in India for the last three
and a half years, attached to the Isabella
Thoburn College for Women as head of the
teachers’ training department.
Adelaide’s contribution :
The Children’s Hospital ball is being organised by
a committee of 60 energetic women, which includes
some of the younger set. His Ex. and Lady Hore-
Ruthven will attend. The vice-regal couple found
a shoal of invitations to this and other functions
awaiting them at Fremantle. The Welcome Home
Ball organised in their honor, to be held on Thurs-
day next, is meeting with a wonderful response;
there have already been over 800 reservations for
tables.
The Hunt Club ball will be held at the Palais
Royal on Friday, July 7. Every year some of the
original members drop out of the Lancers, in which
the dancers wear the traditional hunting costume,
and the new arrivals have to be coached in the pre-
war dance.
The Lieut.-Governor and Miss Murray gave an at-
home at Government House, prior to their retire-
ment from office. The reception-rooms have been
re-carpeted with rich crimson pile, making an effec-
tive background for the light cretonne-covered furni-
ture. There was a profusion of lovely flowers, dnd
a band rendered bright music. The L.-G. and his
sister received in the first drawing-room; Miss
Murray wore a black chiffon velvet coat trimmed
with silver-grey fox fur, and her toque was of
black velvet. The guests passed on into the ball-
room ahd dining-room, where afternoon' tea was served
buffet style. The host and hostess entertained Mrs.
R. L. Butler, wife of the Premier, the Bishop of
Adelaide, and Mrs. Nutter Thomas at small tea-
tables on the dais. The froeking was smart.
Fur coats were in request at the first of the
A. Birthday Cup meetings. Mr. James Hall
(chairman) and his daughter entertained a large
number at afternoon tea in the committee-room.
Miss Hall wore a smart blue tweed coat and skirt,
with felt hat to match and a mink fur.
Professor and Mrs. Wilkinson and Mr. and Mrs.
B. Hall gave a> dinner party at the Hotel Richmond
as a farewell to Dr. and Mrs. G. R. West who, with
their daughter Dorothy, will leave for England by
tile Ormonde.
Mesdames Lavington Bonytlion and F. Goldsmith
convened a meeting at St. Oorantyn, East Terrace,
the residence of Mrs. Bonytlion, to devise means of
helping the Unemployed'Sales Depot workers/ There
will be a bridge party at Bilk’s Piccadilly, on June
21. Charming examples of the work on sale at the
depot were on show.
A word from the West: —
Helen, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. Cramond, and
Ted, Mrs. 0. W. Blackman’s only son, set forth on
their matrimonial venture from Christ Church, Clare-
mont. The bridal gown of ivory velvet included
long sleeves and a suggestion of train. It was
misted over with lace veil and contrasted with a
bouquet of deep-red roses. Bride’s sister Kathleen
and ’groom’s sister Betty performed their duties in
Madonna-blue velvet. Their feather-weight crinoline
hats echoed the tint of their frocks, and they Held
trails of blossoms. , The afternoon ceremony was
followed by toasts at the home of the bride’s parents.
Joan Hearman, Duncan Howie and J. H. Riches
have plucked the plums of free steamship passages
to Europe. Since Miss Hearman gained her science
degree in 1931 she has been probing the cause of
prevention of diseases in fruit—-with considerable
success in the Mt. Barker district. She plans to do
research at Rothamstcd. Duncan Howie, M.A., hopes
to become a Doctor of Philosophy in London. Mr.
Riches holds as well as a science degree an agri-
cultural science degree with honors. He has been
on the staff at. Muresk and will invade the Itowett
Institute of Animal Nutrition, which is affiliated with
the University of Aberdeen.
Fremantle’s woman dentist, Maisie Campbell, sailed
off on the Moldavia. After a holiday in Scotland
she plans a post-graduate course in her profession
in London. Olga Joseph, Peggy Wood and Jeanne
Marie Ackroyd-Stuart were other maidens who had
booked bunks on the same vessel.
Hounds and huntsmen answered the season’s opening
tally-ho on an afternoon of strong wind and cold
showers. There was a great rally at Belmont, v/here
tea was served by new president J. J. Poynton, his
wife and Mabel Teather. There was a record field
of 170 riders. A few minor casualties in the scrub
and a sporting ’roo who grinned over his shoulder as
he bounded among the trees gave zip to the after-
noon run.
Diminutive Judy Holland and tall Sydney Watson
preferred a quiet wedding. Without cake or con-
fetti, they took the plunge into matrimony, telling
their friends only after the deed was done.
Tas. trips in :
Marjorie Sale, a contract-bridge teacher, ran a
duplicate contract tournament at Hadley’s recently
in aid of the Queen Alexandra Hospital. The tea-
tables had rosy cloths, and the decorations were in
fawny autumnal shades. Winners of the “North and
South” prizes were Mrs. Lindsay Miller and Mrs. C.
Pratt, while the “East and West” winners were
Mrs. D. Loney and Miss Hudson.
Lady Abinger and her son left for the Cold Coun-
try in the Moldavia after a short visit to the Speck.
They entertained intimate friends and relations at
dinner at Hadley’s before leaving.
Leslie Laurier produced Van Druten’s “There’s
Always Juliet” by way of a farewell effort before
leaving Launceston. The leading parts are those of
Leonora and Dwight Houston; Sue Cragg \ and
Laurier himself made a success of the characters
from the start, and the stage settings were remark-
ably good. Minor parts were well cast: Miss Cragg’s
short intervals “off” must have been whirling ones,
for she changed no fewer than five times, and the
frocks were not of the slip-on variety either.
Miss K. M. Wilson, Divisional Commissioner in
the Guides for West Kyle and Ayrshire and Bute,
came out from Scotland on her official job, and was
entertained by Mrs. O. T. Butler while in Hobart.
The Y.M.C.A. is running a big organisation for
the benefit of unemployed youths. Mrs. W. F.
Forster headed a committee in getting up a cafe
chantant lately, and this brought in nimble sixpences
beyond expectations. Tea-tables were set all about
the main hall in the Town Hall building, and
Mdme. Lucy Atkins and Mary Sharland’s pupils were
responsible for a musical programme and a short
play. Lieut.-Gov. Nicholls and his lady put in an
appearance, and Boy Scouts made efficient waiters.
Authoress Marie Bjelke-Petersen, who has been
collecting material for a new novel on the North-
West Coast, is back at Lindisfarne.
Mrs. Tom Fitzgerald left for the Big Smoke in
the Ormonde. She will join her mother, the Jones
lady, and her daughter Gwen there, and return with
them in about six months.

How far will superstition extend? One of
Augustus Harris’s companies was to open
the Northampton Theatre, rebuilt after a
fire. At the last moment the little man
almost cancelled the engagement because he
discovered that peacock-feathers had been
painted op the act-drop. But Janet Achurch

The South Australian papers report the
painful case of a gentleman who got lost in
the bush near Silverton. It was pitch-dark,
so he lit a fire and camped for the night—
only unfortunately he fell into the blaze,
and lay combusting. When he woke up his
right hand was nearly burnt off, and the
arm shrivelled up. Then, being completely
bushed, he had to sit by the fire and shriek
in a mournful key for the rest of the night,
and the emu heard him howling, and the

wilds were filled with notes of woe. Next,
morning he rode about 25 miles to get the
stump amputated, and after that he laid up
in hospital. The hanging-reporters of the
evening papers are invited to consider this
incident, and fill in details about the strange
shadows and dreary echoes of that midnight
encampment, and the gruesome dreams of
the frizzled traveller as he sat in his horrid
solitude, and the odor of burning flesh, and
the hollow, far-off sighing of the breeze upon
the mountains, and the murmurs of the
stream, and all the rest of the properties.

The other day three enthusiastic police-
men raided a hotel in a Victorian town on
the ground that the landlord was trading
after hours. One of them
went in; another stood
sentry at the back gate; the
third secured the key of the
front door and locked it. on
the outside, and then waited
to collar anybody who came
out by the window. In just
about three seconds there
was a horrid clatter of feet
in the passage, and somebody
began to tug frantically at
the door-handle. Then an
agitated voice prayed through
the keyhole that he would
open the door, and the senti-
nel chuckled. Next moment
a big, excited man burst,
through a window, and when
Hie officer grabbed him he
found it was his own mate
dying from the wrath to
come. He had raided tlm
place in due form, and found
the parties drinking inside
to be his own inspector and
the local military com-
mander. At the moment the
third officer burst round the
corner with a scared expres-
sion on his countenance. He
had seized the police-magis-
trate and the clergyman as
they came out of the back
gate, and dragged them into
the light of the corner lamp,
and then he had dropped
them with a howl, and
quitted. While they were
talking over this mishap a
window was opened, and a
man looked out cautiously to
see if the coast was clear,
it was the parish priest.
The officers left just there.
They felt they had discov-
ered enough prominent citi-
zens for one night.

From a feminine point of view [writes
Sappho Smith], the “at-home” and banquet
which signalised the official opening of the
splendidly solid Australia Hotel on lltli
inst. was a novel orgy at which a mob .of
women sat about in the ladies’ drawing-room
and listened to the rattle of knives and forks
in the great dining-hall until the speeches
came on. Then a move was made to see how
the lions were feeding, and we stood grouped
behind! Parkes and Dibbs and Toby Barton
while obliging waiters flitted round with
fizz, and I (at least) drank to the success
of the Australia in the safe shadow ot a
broad, black, satin-covered back. I had a
capital view of the mise cn scene especi-
ally of the top of old Sir Henry’s head,
where the Southdownish mane is thinning
out sadly, revealing fleeting glimpses of a
pink cranium. The tables were nicely decor-
ated, but the speeches were dreadfully hack-
neyed. Light refreshment was spread for
the lady visitors in the “late breakfast
room,” and intermittent music kept them
awake in the drawing-room. _ But what
spoilt the feminine aspect of things was that,
most of the women didn’t know one another,
and as no Australian female ever chums m
with her neighbor (except over the back
fence) without a ceremonious introduction, a
damp and depressing stillness gave the fes-
tivities quite an “after the funmud”/R*r.
Beneath we give the seating accommoda-
tion of some of the world’s best-known
places of amusement: La Seala, Milan,
3000; Carlo Felice, Genoa, 2000-; Femme,
Venice, 2000; San Carlos, Lisbon, 2000;
Royal, Munich, 2300; Opera, Vienna, 2400;
Grand Opera, Paris, 2100; Academy of
Music, New York, 2000; Covent Garden,
London. 2500: D’Oyly Carte’s Opera House,
1976- These, it will be understood, are all
opera houses ; nevertheless, we will compare
them with our Australian theatres. Sydney
has Her Majesty’s, 2000; Royal, 1750; Cri-
terion (after alterations), 1700; Garrick,
1150; Gaiety, 980; Opera, 850; Lyceum
(unfinished), 1700. Melbourne has the Alex-
andra, 2500; Royal, 2350; Princess, 2200;
Opera House, 2100; Bijou, 1750. Here we
mention, lest any Australian should fancy
that our theatres, like our scullers and
. fighters, can’t be licked, that the Grand
Theatre, Leeds, seats, without any bother,
4000 people. [ll/7/’9l.]
For the Bernhardt season at Sydney Her
Majesty’s an extra tier interposes another
gradation in price between the lordly ten
shillings of circle and reserved stalls and
the humble florin of the gallery. It has
been said that the £Bl5 taken at Sara s
opening night in Melbourne was the largest
sum ever taken at any one theatrical repre-
sentation. in Australia. It may have been
the most drawn by a dramatic performance,
but certain Sydney old-timers remember
that Catherine Hayes on one occasion filled
the treasury of the ancient Victoria Theatre
to the tune of £l3OO by one concert per-
formance. It may also interest those who
grumble at the Bernhardt season’s prices to
know that the Catherine Hayes charges
were for circle, 305.; stalls, 215.; upper
circle, 155.; pit, 10s. 6d.; gallery, 55.; all
round considerably over three times as much
as the prices prevailing at Her Majesty’s
for the Bernhardt season. [ll/7/’9l.]
There has been a final burst-up at Lon-
don Savoy (writes our correspondent) as
far as Nellie Stewart is concerned. That
lovely and capricious creature has all along
managed to. put herself in the wrong with
the management, whether from vanity or
“sheer cussedness” I cannot say—prohably
a little of each. Having engaged to play
the leading lady’s part in Dance and Solo-
mon’s opera, she struck because there was
not enough “fat.” for her. After some
trouble, she relented and began rehearsals.
All went well till the second act was tried,
and then she found that Jessie Bond had,
in her opinion, been too well looked after,
and there was another strike. Her demands
and objections became at last so irksome that
D’Oyly Carte became disgusted and at once
gave the part to an American aspirant, Miss
Snyder, who promises well. The Savoy
much regret Nellie’s secession, as she shaped
WHY HE SMILED.
DOCTOR: “How long has your husband been like this,
madam?”
ANXIOUS WIFE : “He came home at lunch-time, appa-
rently as usual, and told me he had bought a new
novel—that He story was laid in England, the
principal hero being a retired Queenslander who
had made his fortune by farming in Queensland.
Then he threw himself on the sofa and has
never stopped laughing since.”
[Frank P. Mahony —2B/11/’9l.]
so well. Her sprightliness and vivacity
struck them all, and a big hit was predicted.
There is just a suspicion that Musgrove
wants to get back to Australia, for lie has
not been much of a boom here, and that it
is really he who has made all the trouble,,
in order that Nellie may not be a fixture in
London. [25/7/’9l.]
OTHERSIDE.
Somewhere in the mystic future, on the
road to Paradise,
There’s a very pleasant country that I’ve
dreamed of once or twice;
It has inland towns, and cities by the ocean’s
rocky shelves,
But the people of the country differ some-
what from ourselves ;
It is many leagues beyond us, and they call
it Otherside,
And there is among its people more
Humanity than Pride.
-Now, a social system never was complete,
without a flaw,
Arid among the Othersiders there is love and
gold and war;
But if one is fairly beaten he can turn
upon the track,
For in such a case there isn’t any shame
in going back ;
And a broken-hearted mortal never thinks of
suicide,
For he finds amongst his brothers more
Humanity than Pride.
And the lords of that creation never scoff
at v simple, things—
Never scorn the lad who’s tethered to his
mother’s apron-strings ;
He will speak of “home” and “mother” with-
out shame when he’s inclined.
Yet the blow he strikes in battle mostly
leaves a mark behind.
They are brave against invasion—they can
die in Otherside,
Though there is among the people more
Humanity than Pride.
Poets sing in simple language that a child
might understand,
Yet their songs are sung for ages by the
elders of the land,
And the people know that Freedom never
shall be wanting guards,
For the foremost in the vanguard waves
the banner of the Bards.
Oh! the poets march together, and at home
in peace abide,
For there is amongst the people more
Humanity than Pride.
And when I am very weary, ’neath a load
of “worldly care,”
There are times when I’ve a longing just to
hump my bluey there ;
But alone I could not reach it. for the
track is barred to one — .
I must take the nations with me—all man-
kind must go, or none—
And we’d trample one another on the way
to Otherside,
For I find among my brothers less Humanity
than Pride.

HENRY LAWSON.
THE FIGHT AT BRANNIGAN’S HOLE.
Brannigau’s Hole was like a racecourse.
The fence by the creek was lined with bug-
gies and hacks, and everybody was talking
about Uncle Jim and “Stiffener” Welsh.
“Crook” Moore and “Spud” Maloney marked
out a ring at the bottom of the slope, where
Brannigan had set up a cask of beer. Uncle
Jim came over the bridge looking hot and
flurried; several bookies, who had come up
for the Skinner Flat Handicap, ran over to
meet him, and said he’d better have a rub-
down after his walk. Uncle Jim kept at a
distance and waved them off.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “I’m as fit. as a
nail-can; I’m trained to the hour.” He
walked to the ring and scrutinised it closely.
“A man can’t be too careful about his ground
when lie’s depending on his
footwork and reach,” he said.
“Reach and footwork will pull
me through.”
(Uncle Jim has a wonder-
ful reach. When Aunt kept
a boarding-house at Mudgee,
the butcher used to drive up
under the window and walk
round to the side door for
orders. One of the kids would
watch until his back was
turned, and sing out “Now!”
Like a flash Uncle Jim would
reach out of the window and
collect all the loose corned
beef and sausages that hap-
pened to be at the bottom of
the cart. Uncle Jim’s reach
is something above the average.)
The crowd shifted suddenly,
and everyone said, “Here he
is.” “Stiffener” Welsh skipped
out of a buggy and shook
hands with “Crook” Moore.
About 60 men left the cask of
beer to ask “Stiffener” how he
felt. “Stiffener” didn’t say
anything. “Crook” Moore
went up to Uncle Jim and told
him that over a hundred
pounds would change hands
on the event, and he wanted
to know whether Uncle
Jim would put up five
pounds as a guarantee that
(here would be no faking.
Unci e Ji m looked into
“Crook’s” one eye. “S’pose I
lick hell outer Welsh, how
much will I git?”
“A purse of fifty quid,”
roared “Crook,” “and the
championship of the Castle-
reagli.” Uncle Jim took a
long breath and looked at me.
“Don’t mix it with ‘Stif-
fener,’ ” whispered “Crook” —
“hit him from a safe distance.”
Uncle Jim peeled to his singlet and tight-
ened his belt. “Stiffener” Welsh jumped
into the ring; he was stripped to the waist
and eager to begin.
The referee asked Uncle Jim to take off
his singlet, but Uncle Jim explained that
he was afraid of catching influenza.
“Time!” shouted “Crook.” Uncle looked
white and haggard as he moved out of his
corner; somebody said he was the dead
image of Corbett. Nobody laughed. “Stiff-
ener” leaped forward like a runner off the
mark, but Uncle Jim retreated cleverly.
“Stiffener” followed, swinging his right, but
Uncle whizzed away and never gave him
a single chance.
Round 2,—“Stiffener.” jumped out at the
call of “Time.” Uncle was soon away at
the other side getting in a lot of useful
footwork, and never allowing Welsh to be-
come really dangerous. Uncle ended the
round in fine style, with “Stiffener” sprint-
ing hopelessly after him.
Round 3. —More footwork and comments.
Bound 4. —“Crook” Moore
advised “Stiffener” to go and
disembowel Uncle. “Stiffener”
replied that if anyone would
lend him a good horse and a
week’s tucker, he’d chase Uncle
over to Condobolin. The re-
feree said he couldn’t allow re-
marks of that kind to pass, as
they were injurious to Uncle’s
reputation.
Round 5 and Last.- —The
crowd closed in and “Stiffener’-’
suddenly cornered Uncle Jim
and swung, his right with a ter-
rific bang on his ribs. Uncle
drew up stiffly and-sighed.
“Holy Moses!” said “Crook.”
“What the h —1 was that?”
You could have heard the
blow half a mile away. “Stiffener”
looked at his fist and breathed on it, and
then held it between his knees for three
minutes by the referee’s watch. “Time!”
shouted “Crook.” “Stiffener” stepped back
a little, picked up his coat, breathed on his
fist, and walked right out of Brannigan’s
Hole without saying a word. “Crook”
Moore went up to Uncle, and handed him a
big, fat purse. Nobody spoke or made any
remark whatever, and in three minutes a
line of buggies was tailing, off towards Skin-
ner’s Flat.
I followed Uncle home, and when we got
inside he closed the door carefully and began
to laugh. “Took ’em all down, by (4 and !
Did ye hear that punch ‘Stiffener’ gave me?”
I said it sounded like the bang of a wool-
press.
“They’re a smart crowd,” lie chuckled.
“Sydneyites and spielers, every man of ’em.
But the brains are in the country, my lad,
and there’s many a wrinkle picked up in the
backblock.s.”
He stripped off his singlet, and I saw
hundreds and hundreds of wrinkles; his
chest was cased in crocodileskin, and each
vulnerable point was studded with brass
knobs: the skin interlaced like a pair of
stays. He looked at me, and threw it under
the bed. “Splendid thing for th’ kidneys,”
he said. “My word that bit of hide has
saved me a heap of pain.” He brought out
the purse, weighed it in his hand, and
tossed it to me, playfully. I pitched it
back; he refused it skittishly, and tossed
it back again. I opened it while he giggled
over my shoulder. The purse was fairly
stuffed with gold and silver. A half-crown
slipped from my fingers and dropped with
a thud to the hearthstone. Uncle picked
it up and bit off a piece. I shook pp the
purse and emptied about a hundred little
Jubilee medals on the table. Neither of us
spoke. I went out for a stroll and stayed
away until dark. When I returned he was
standing in the same position.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
Was Hoover Guilty?
“D. Empson”: My old friend Arthur
Reid, sometime manager of the Kalgoorlie
‘•Sun,” has turned author in his riper
years. He has written, and a West-
tralian concern has published, “Those Were
the Days,” a volume of racy remini-
scences of the goldfields, chiefly in the
Roaring ’Nineties. In it he mentions Hail
Columbia Hoover, who was to become Presi-
dent of the United States, and asserts that
“years after leaving the goldfields Hoover
addressed erotic and exotic verses to a
Hannans barmaid.” The verses are sub-
joined:—
Do you ever' dream, my sweetheart, of a twilight
long ago,
Of a park in old Kalgoorlie, where the bougainvilleas
grow;
Where the moonbeams on the pathways trace a shim-
mering brocade,
And the overhanging peppers form a lovers’ pro-
menade ;
Where in soft cascades of cadence from a garden
close at hand.
Came the murmurous mellow music of a sweet
orchestral band?
l'ears have flown since then, my sweetheart, fleet
as orchard bloomsi in May;
But the hour that Alls my dreaming, was it only
yesterday ?
Stood we two a space in silence, while the summer
sun slipped down,
And the grey dove dusk with drooping pinions wrapt
the mining town.
Then you raised your tender glances darkly, dreamily,
to mine,
And my pulses clashed like cymbals in a rhapsody
divine;
And tlie pent-up fires of longing loosed their prison's
weak control,
And in wild, hot words came rushing madly from
my burning soul.
AYiliJ, hot words that spoke of passion, hitherto but
half expressed,
And I clasped you close, my sweetheart, kissed you,
strained you to my breast,
While the starlight-spangled heavens rolled around
us where we stood,
And a tide of bliss swept surging through the cur-
rents of our blood.
And I spent my soul in kisses, .crushed upon your
scarlet mouth,
Oh! my red-lipped, sun-browned sweetheart, dark-
eyed daughter of the South.
It was well that Pate should part us, it was well
my path should lead
Back to slopes of high endeavor, aye, and was it
well indeed.
Von have wed some southern squatter, learned long
since his every whim,
Soothed his sorrows, borne his troubles, sung your
sweetest songs for him.
I have fought my fight and triumphed, c-n the map
I’ve writ my name;
But I prize one hour of loving more than fifty
years of fame.
It was but a summer madness that possessed me,
men will hold,
And the yellow moon bewitched me, with its wizardry
of gold,
As they will; but ofttimes in the dusk I close my
eyes
And in dreams drift back where stars rain silver
splendor from the skies,
To a park in far Kalgoorlie, where the golden
wattles grow,
AY here you kissed me in the twilight in a summer
long ago.
And I clasp you close, my sweetheart, while each
throbbing pulse is thrilled
By a low and mournful music that shall never more
be stilled. ,
Lots of us have perpetrated worse verses
to barmaids, but, although I have a great
THE BARGAIN.
“I’d love to get lots of money, wouldn’t you?”
“Well, I don’t know whether I really would love; but I’d do the best I could.”
respect for Arthur Reid as a chronicler, I
can’t help thinking that his memory, for
once, has played him false, and that the lines
were written by some other mining Johnnie
at a later period. The accused is not here
to defend himself. I take the liberty of
appearing for him and pleading not guilty,
With the Book in my right hand, I swear
that there was never any twilight in KaJ-
goodie when I knew it, and that in Hoover's
time there were neither park nor garden,
bougainvillaeas nor golden wattles. That con-
cludes my evidence, if your Honor pleases •
and now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury!
as counsel for the absent accused, I ask you
to weigh this point well. He was a serious-
minded young mining engineer of Quaker
ancestry. I admit the possibility that a youth
of that stamp might wink at a barmaid, but
can you seriously believe that lie would write
verses to one “years after leaving the
goldfields,” verses a long way after “Locks-
ley Hall”? Is it feasible, ladies and gentle-
men ? It is not. There is nothing more to be
said. I leave the case in your hands, satis-
fied that, while doing no injustice to the bar-
maid, you will exculpate the ex-President—
confident, in short, that you will bring in a
verdict of Not Guilty. •
“Barangkali”: That hardy old bird the
sea-serpent has turned up again, this time
in the Red Sea. Passengers aboard the
Largs Bay state that the monster suddenly
reared about 20 feet of its bulk out of the
water. It had a bulging head, the circum-
ference of which plainly exceeded that of
its body, while a long fang or spike pro-
jected from its snout. To me this descrip-
tion reads like the leap of a giant marlin or
broadbill swordfish, species common in those
waters. The broadbill has shoulders like a
bullock, and when he leaps presents an awe-
inspiring sight. All the same, I have
seen too many weird denizens of the ocean
around coral atolls to be a scoffer, at any
tale an excited passenger springs, unless he
does it from the ship’s bar.
“Globe-beater”: As in every other profes-
sion, there is a social scale amongst hobos.
I rode the rattlers over 1200 miles of
the Canadian-Pacific with a Virginian elec-
trician who had beaten his way from job to
job over a territory extending from Van-
couver to the Rio Grande. He carried all
his tools on a capacious body-belt, was com-
paratively affluent, but as for buying a
ticket —“not on your life, bo.” An extra-
special sample of the highbrow variety, en-
countered in India, comes vividly to mind.
He was a whisky traveller, as it turned out.
but when I first saw him on Delhi station,
just as he stopped from the first-class com-
partment of the Punjab mail, I mistook
him for a provincial Governor, especially
when I saw his “bearer.” This regally-
attired native walked ahead of his distin-
guished-looking sahib, loudly bidding the
dusky throng to make way for “his Excel-
lency.” The native ticket-collectors at the
exit salaamed nearly to the ground, and the
regal , hobo passed through without a ticket.
“C. Coral”: The Torres Strait Islander
on his wedding day doesn’t wear a polished
silk tile, but frequently cuts a dash in a
dark suit and a stiff white collar. As a rule,
he borrows the suit from some lad who has
been through the mill before, a few moth-
holes being neither here nor there. A wed-
ding-cake. which a well-meaning but ill-
advised European dame introduced a few
years back, is looked upon as essential.
A boy asked me for a bottle of “that
same kind wine white man drink when
he got wedding, when he put one foot
on top chair and hoist up glass and sing
out ‘Jolly good fella.’ ” To his regret he
had to do without the “white-man good-luck
drink.” A bucket of raspberry cordial was
the worst I could do for him.
“Liverpool”: Those African natives who
called crocodiles from their pools, and after
feeding them gave them a demi-tasse of gin
(B. 31/5/’33), were not the only folk in the
Dark Continent with a predilection for
strange pets. In the good old days of the
West African trade, to give it its conven-
tional name, Bonny and Brass, two im-
portant slave emporia, were famed for their
domestic zoos. One affected huge pythons
and the other great monitor lizards. Both
crawlers went up the town and down and
were worshipped as gods. If a python felt
like eating a native baby it did so, even the
mother not daring to interfere under penalty
of a sticky end herself. This custom lasted
into Harry Johnston’s day, and its abolition
by the Baptist missionaries is a bright spot
on their annals. After years of striving they
persuaded the natives to slaughter their
gods, and when nothing disastrous followed
the rush of converts was a record.

“No, the union seeker tary.”
Christoval canoes arc, or were, built up from
planking miraculously planed and fitted, con-
sidering that only stone adzes and shell
planes were used. Seams were sewn
with fine sinnet and, after caulking with
gum, smoothed down until they were hardly
visible. The symmetry of these craft was
added to by high stem and stern posts curv-
ing into the air; these and the upper
strake of the canoe were hung with large
white cowrie shells and inlaid with m.o.p.
On State occasions the stem was adorned
with the freshly-severed head of a captive,
and often the old blackbirding schooners
were met in this ceremonious fashion by
chiefs desiring to do business in live stock
for the Queensland plantations. The heads
were a sign that a successful raid had been
made and that the goods were on hand for
delivery if the price was right.

“Lofty”: For an outsize in thrills the
first 200 yards of a turtle’s rush after being
speared takes beat-
ing. In the Coral
Sea a small, flat-
bottomed dinghy is
generally nsed by the
natives. One man
rows whilst his mate
stands in the bow-
re ad y with the
spear—a long pole,
hollowed at the butt
to take a small
tliree-pronged barb,
to which is attached
a good strong rope,
30yds. to 60yds. long.
The best hunting-
time is about half
an hour each side of
low tide. When the
prey is sighted the
boat approaches as
quietly as possible,
and is kept station-
ary above the spot.
The native fisherman
will dive overboard
and spear the turtle
as it lies on the bot-
tom, but white men
generally wait until
the prey comes to
the surface. As soon
as pronged the turtle goes for his life; the
rope is strained to the utmost, and the
greatest skill is required to prevent the
dinghy from swamping. A big hawkbill can
pull a heavy boat from five to eight knots
an hour, so there’s plenty of fun sitting
behind him, especially if the sea is choppy.

“Jeviel” : The old belief that a prolonged
fall will kill a man before the sudden stop
can scarcely survive after the feat of
one John Tranum, K.A.F., in dropping
17,250 ft. before releasing his parachute.
Actually, the parachutist’s speed diminished
as he dropped; leaving the ’plane at 21.000 ft.
he quickly reached a speed of 140 m.p.h., but
this was gradually reduced to 120 m.p.h. as
he fell through the denser air below. Con-
sidering that Malcolm Campbell has driven
a car twice as fast and airmen have flown
at well over 400 m.p.h., there seems little
reason to suppose that mere speed in cleav-
ing the air will cause heart-failure. It is
now established that air-resistance very
quickly limits the speed of any falling object.
“Gad”: The Rosgelitcs, in common with
all their Papuan brethren, seem to be sche-
duled for an ultimate fade-away. About now
(January) is the season of the hot sun,
during which no rain falls, and a lot of “big
sick” abounds. It is not easy to find out
what is the matter with a Rosselite. The
term “head sick” covers a multitude of
derangements, from pneumonia to some con-
dition of gland infection, maybe a variety
of plague. The native is, apparently, un-

voyagers than Kupc and Ngaliue, and there’s

doubted. Most, if not all, represent M.L.
as having been inhabited by man then,
though possibly only in the South Island.
A strong case can be made otit for carrying
back the date of settlement several centuries
before Kupe’s voyage.

“The McHaggis”: One Dr. Cawardias.
who practises both in Paris and London,
has thrown the European golfing world into
a fury by an article in which he says that
golf, while useful for keeping elderly folk
out of worse mischief, is the most selfish of
games and one entirely lacking in the team
spirit and control of self that such games
as Rugby football inculcate. It must be
admitted that there is much in the doctor’s
contention. If one’s opponent gets into a
bunker one does not give him a friendly'and
sporting hand out of it. Contrariwise, a
silent prayer goes up that he may stay there
until it is time to tear up his card.' Golf
certainly encourages its exponents to Order
everything as far as possible to their own
advantage. That i-s why. perhaps, it was
invented by Scotsmen.
“Contact”: Soon after Sydney bridge was

Colorado had a similar experience when some
200 cars were stalled on a stretch of
Paved roadway after a storm. Only one
motor vehicle kept moving, and that was
dragging a length of chain such as is seen
on motor petrol-tanks. It was explained
that static electricity caused by air fric-
tion had been stored up in the cars by the
insulation of the rubber-tyres. This had
upset the ignition systems of the 200 cars
unprovided with an “earth” like the one
that got through.
“Black Jack” : The cabled account of the
shooting of one of U.S.A.’s most eminent

left behind them on his body an ace of

connection of the ace of spades with immi-
nent trouble? One of Kipling’s finest soldier
stories tells of a would-be murderer deter-
mined by turning up that card. In the “New
Arabian Nights” Stevenson makes it select
the member of the Suicide Club who is due
for his finish. Most people know why the
nine of diamonds is called the curse of Scot-
land, but if anyone knows why the ace of
spades has been given its bad eminence
he has permission to broadcast it.

Boomerang.
BY WALTER E. WYNNE.
BENEATH the comparative shelter of his
windbreak of gum branches, the old
man peered at the night, and, listening
to the rain, pondered on things. His was
a simple mind, and, because of its great age,
wont to totter on such occasions, though it
brooded only on trifling things. A vague
puzzlement as to why he should be thus
cast in solitude and discomfort had set his
thoughts on the mysterious inertia of good
turns. The weariness of a twenty-mile hot
day and its miserable wet closing caused him
to wonder why a good deed, when once
launched from a willing hand, never re-
turned, boomerang-like, to the sender.
“Why don’t they keep going round and
round like everything else in the world?”
he murmured fretfully. “Why haven’t they
got any life in them? Why don’t they breed?
Hunger and cold and wet grow and increase
all the time, but a good turn seems to drop
dead as soon as you turn your back on it.”
From somewhere along the length of the
road close by came the sound of a heavy car
laboring through mud. The darkness, exterior
to the old man, paled as the glare of head-
lamps diffused through the rain about him,
and the gloom within him retreated before
the hope of a lift. For the car stopped with
a splutter almost opposite him, and*the lights
revealed a small section of the steady down-
pour. The silhouette of the driver passed
across the radiance, and there sounded the
rasp of a lifted bonnet. The old man rose
stiffly from his shelter and squelched to the
light.
“Where was you going?” he inquired.
The driver straightened up with a curious
leathery creak, as of harness.
“Hullo! Two of us, eh?” he observed
grimly. “Companions in adversity.”
“What’s wrong, mate?”
“Everything. I was to have caught the
express at the junction before midnight, but
the car’s gone phut and I’m no mechanic.
The nearest garage I know of in these parts
is five miles further on. So woe is us!”
“Five miles,” said the old man, thinking
of his twenty. “That’s not so far. You
could be there and back in three hours.”
The motorist smiled to himself and thrust
forward a stiff leg with that curious creak-
ing as of harness. “She’s cork and leather,
and in this mud I couldn’t do it in a week.”
“Which way’s this garage?” asked the old
man after a moment’s silence. “Along there?
Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do. It’s on my
way to the new weir. Is there as much work
there as they say? I might as well do that
five miles to-night as to-morrow. I’ll knock
that garage up if you’ll give me a note ’bout
what you want.”
So he who had cheered up at prospect of
a lift disappeared into the rain on a five-
mile tramp.
“Peculiar,” said the lame motorist to him-
self as he waited in the disabled- car.
“Nothing to gain by it. Wouldn’t take
money, and seems set on hard graft at the
weir. If he comes back in the other car II 1
talk him round.”
But the old man did not return in the
ear that arrived from the distant garage
within two hours. Questioned on the matter,
the driver of the relief could not answer
much. “Just gave me your note, and said
he would keep going for the weir.”
“Peculiar,” repeated the other, and rumi-
nated to himself. “I .suppose I’ll never set
eyes on him again now. He gets me out of
a nasty hole, and in return for his assist-
ance I can do nothing.”

they moved back to the station, where the
“J me man creaked into the operating room,
J -rom there emerged sounds of expostulation,
countered.by the soothing voice of the

other end. They’re breaking every railway
rule and regulation to do this,- but I pull
a bit of weight here.... .Oh, that’s all right,
Doesn t cost me anything. Please don’t
mention it. Bye-bye.”
Connected merely for the moment by the
difficulty of one of them, they parted, neither
realising that a certain boomerang had corn-
menced its return journey—impossible to
follow its minor quick turnings from point
to point of its curve, but not altogether be-
yond human agency to trace its general
flight.
That same morning the pale man pre-
sided in his austere city office, though
scarcely recognisable in those surroundings.
He dictated letters with the chill precision
attributable to typical chiefs of big busi-
ness concerns.
“That case of Brook’s farm,” he addressed
a secretary. “We are going to foreclose.
They’ve had all the time there is. See to
it.”
Quickly he passed to the next item. His
concentration was fretted away by the clack-
ing of a typewriter. For some extraordinary
reason it brought back to him the scene in
the operating room at the forsaken country
station at dawn, when an operator risked
his career to put through an unofficial tele-
gram on the clicking key. The illusion per-
sisted with the progress of the letter in the
typewriter, and the Chief’s memory con-
jured up a vivid recollection of the man who
had creaked and served him.
“Oh, leave that for the time,” he snapped
impatiently ; “I’ll attend to it personally.”
The clacking of the typewriter ceased
obediently.
Well on the way back to the sender was
the boomerang now, in the shape of a letter
jostling through the post to a harassed home-
steader. The communication was a curt
salvation.
“O’ course it can’t be, but it is,” stut-
tered the bewildered recipient, reading it a
fifth time in the light of a hurricane-lamp.
“He says, as fur as he is concerned, the whole
place is mine. An’ no strings tied to it,
neither. ’Course it must be impossible, but
then it’s his sign, all right. Lord knows I
can tell it by now.”
It was certainly the authentic signature,
though seen but dimly at the foot of a new
style of letter, and on a page that refused to
remain steady in the trembling hands of the
holder. “I’ll saddle the prad and get to town
to-morrow, then,” he said. “If this is gospel,
I can go right ahead.”
By the light of the hurricane-lamp next
morning, he wired the old trappings in place
on his white horse, and addressed it with
the familiarity of confidence.
“Stand still, blast yer. For a coupla
straws I’d sell yer and buy a real prad.” He
started out for town with the new day,
affectionately maligning the steed.
Sunrise disclosed to him a prone form on
a corner of his land where abundant grass
made a good bed. He eyed the sleeper pro-
prietorially, toying mentally with the know-
ledge that, if it came to a pinch, he could
order the intruder off his land, though a few
hours ago it had not looked at all like being
his land. He gazed about the expanse of it,
and would not have grudged an army rest-
ing place there.
“Hullo!” he called loudly to the prone
figure. “How’re things?”
The sleeper rolled over and observed the
farmer on the white horse, and waited for
instructions to move on. During the colder
parts of the night the homeless man had con-
sidered the advisability of terminating his
long pilgrimage at this point, to prey on
the neighborhood. It would cut out a long
tramp that had only hard work at the end
of it. Now he waited with suspended judg-
ment for the farmer to crystallise his deci-
sion.
“Goin’ far?” continued the farmer.
“Far as the new weir.”
“Whew! A fair way. that. H’ad break-
fast? Lunch? Tea?” He ceased the cate-
chism at the shake of the other’s head. “Well,
I’m going a bit of your way. Get up behind,
and we can eat as we go. Come on. This
prad will carry the three of us, for you’re as
big as two ordinary men.”
Thus the boomerang in its last slowing
glide, in the person of the young giant eating
a scrappy meal, the first for a considerable
time, and being conveyed a morning’s ride
nearer to the new weir, behind a newly-
made independent landlord, and astride a
sketcliily-saddled white horse.
A day later, in the dustiest part of the ex-
cavations for the new weir, an old man was
fainting over his shovel. His thin arms
cracked with each futile heave, and half of
each light shovelful rilled down again from
the lip of the trench above him. Though the
shift had just commenced, he was drawing
near to his last knock-off time. He was
weak, probably due to exposure to a rainy
night a short while ago, and the intermin-
able loose clay before him was being steadily
added to by the lusty efforts of a young
giant armed with a pneumatic pick.
The young giant straightened up and
wiped the sweat from his brow. He was
about to pass a jocular remark to the old
man, when he noted the blind and feeble
gropings of the shovel. The curse of think-
ing had not yet come to blight the young
giant, and he did not care in the slightest
whether good deeds came back in circles, or
continued for ever away in straight lines.
From knowing acute distress by the feel of
it, he recognised the phenomenon on seeing it.
“Hold on a minute, old timer,” he com-
manded gruffly. “Take this little jigger and
then you can set the pace. Just hold her up
and press the trigger like this, and when
she’s down a foot or so, let her own weight
topple her over. She’ll break as much
ground that way as I can shovel, anyhow
Now, give me that banjo and rest a bit,
while I catch up .'with the field.”
The exchange was made, and the boom-
erang returned. But it having been given
to none of these human creatures —old man,
lame motorist, city magnate, destitute farmer,
young giant—to follow the flight of it, they
saw in the different events nothing untoward.
’Mid Merriment.
Upon a wooded hill that stands
Above a salt lagoon,
’Mid merriment alone I spent
A summer afternoon.
The wind a willing piper was,
Well-loved by all the flowers,
Who piped and piped without a pause
Throughout the golden hours.
Where shadow dwelt and sunlight streamed,
As he piped low and sweet,
The leaves upon the treetops seemed
Like twinkling hands and feet.
Fresh come from ocean’s blue expanse.
So potent was his tune
He set the ripples in a dance
Upon the salt lagoon.
And this I know that, high or low,
Or wheresoe’er I strayed,
The flowers, enraptured, danced also,
And nodded while he played.
Astray on wood-paths, lit or dim—
Sense spelled and spirit stirred —
I did not heed the thrush for him,
Nor hear the honey-bird.

SINISTER STREETS OF OTHER DAYS. BY MONTAGUE GROVER.
WHEN F was a very small boy, living
in Fitzroy, I ' used to gather with
others: of ’ my. age on the eastern
side of Ev'elyn’-street and 100k 1 across, on
the city of Melbourne—as small French
boys gather on the border and gaze towards
Germany—with awe and apprehension. Our
parents and our guardians bad set Evelyn-
street as ■ the line beyond which we might
not venture ; it was the western limit of small
boys, like the limits of wheat and reindeer
we studied in our geography. The city of
Melbourne proper—or improper—was ’ the
Forbidden City; Lhassa had nothing on it.
Sometimes we would strain a point and
stroll down to the steps of Parliament
House. I remember seeing Peter Lalor come
down those steps. With unerring detective
instinct I identified him “on pure descrip-
tion,” for I had heard my elders talk of
him how he was a short, thick-set man
with a black beard and one arm, the other
lost in the fight at the Eureka Stockade,
I deeph sympathised with the rebels of
Eureka/ They had been opposed to the
forces of law and order, symbolised in my
mind in the policeman who stopped us from
playing football in the streets. So I looked
on Lalor with reverence and affection—and
pride, for I was able to point him out. to
the half-dozen fellow-rebels who accompanied
me.
But it was not for ages—probably some
months—before we ever dreamed of cross-
ing that wide thoroughfare into what our
mothers regarded as the danger zone. There
was no Burke and Wills statue then. Only
a bare strip with the old Princess Theatre
behind it and, along the Spring-street front-
age, a long row of cottages at the doors of
which “big girls” of surpassing beauty—so'
it seemed to us—lolled in pink wrappers,
occasionally daring the Wrath of Heaven
by smoking cigarettes.
Half-way along this line was Lonsdale-
street,. with more gaily adorned doorways,
We knew it to be Lonsdalerstreet because the
name was on the wall; but, in cur homes,.
nobody ever mentioned it. In those dear,
dead days beyond recall, the words Lonsdale-
street were taboo. Had there been talkies
then, the censor would have struck such
abominations out of the dialogue. A book
containing the words would have fallen
under the ban of the Customs Minister of
the day and met its fate at the hands of the
common hangman. Any person . who men-
tinned Lonsdale-street in mixed company was
for ever outcast; even when somebody was
forced to refer to Captain Lonsdale, after
whom the street was named, he spoke under
his breath, as if to apologise for having
used ab expression indecent, obscene, almost
Aristophenesean.
Certainly, we sometimes heard the men
mention Lonsdale-street when they were
alone, though they always cut short their
remarks before we were able to grasp their
meaning. But in striking contrast to the
attitude of the women, who seemed deadly
serious, not to say glum, about Lonsdale-
street, the men always accompanied their
observations with smiles and laughter and
an affectionate tolerance, as if Lonsdale-
street Avas a huge joke.
As we grew older, the true significance
of Lonsdale-street and its surroundings
dawned on us. and it became the centre of
romance. Sometimes we summoned up
courage and strolled down the hill around
Stephen-street, just as infamous, or threaded
our way through the lanes which connected
Big Lon. and Little Lon., most infamous of
all. We gazed upon Raliab and Circe and
Thais, still assuming seductive attitudes in
their doorways, with a sort of awed admira-
tion. They did not seem so beautiful as
they had seemed a few years previously, but
they now wore an aura of mystery, the
mystery of forbidden fruit, perhaps just as
alluring as beauty.
During the day,, which constituted her
hours of ease, Thais was occasionally con-
versing with' some dirty-looking but athletic
young man. We didn’t like the look of
those men; they seemed to be the personi-
fication of all we had heard about robbers
and burglars.
Then, when we grew to manhood, we
learned to know our Lonsdale-street. We,
who were fortunate enough to earn our liv-
ings in newspaper offices, grew to know it
from the inside without being of it. We
learned our Who’s Who of the Lonsdales,
Big and Little. We knew the inside story
of the incident which led to Thais getting
three months for robbing a man from the
country—a story which might have made the
plot of a Sardou drama and exalted her to
the dignity of a heroine. We knew the man
who had been luxuriating on her largesse,
and we knew that, now lie was bereft of his
breadwinner, once more we should have to
write of his exploits, until, at last, Russell-
street contrived to trace one or more to him
and sent him, like Thais, to w v ork out his
atonement on The Farm.
We knew who were, the decent sorts in
this mire of evil and who were classified
as bad cows by their associates in vice.
We learned things' which made us think
better of our fellow-man and -woman, though
he might be criminal and she prostitute.
We learned of great deeds —noble deeds
judged by any standard—done by those who
were beyond the gates of Respectability.
More than that, we learned that Lonsdale-
street was a cosmos in itself, obeying the
conventions of Vice, but otherwise very much
like any other community, self-sacrificing,
selfish, venal, altruistic, snobbish, democratic,
brave, cowardly.
The other day I thought to stroll around
the old areas where Vice flourished: Big
Lon., Little. Lon., Stephen—whose name was
changed to Exhibition many years ago, be-
cause the name Stephen could not be men-
tioned in polite society-—Heffernan’s-lane,
Market-lane, Celestial-alley and the narrow
thoroughfare which was once Romeo-lane
with Julie t-terrace nestling beside it.
I felt sad. The City Council might raise
the blessed word “Ichabod” on high. The
glory of Lonsdale-street had departed. Vice
had been ousted by Commercialism, and I’m
not so sure that the change marks an im-
provement. Where the dingy cottages had
stood, four-story box-like structures of flat
brick reared their fronts. The walls which
had witnessed comedy and tragedy and
revelry and synthetic love were as dust and
ashes; Venus and Bacchus had been
banished from this Eden of Sin, and Mam-
mon reigned in their stead. Bijou Cottage
had gone; there were now so many fac-
tories and garages that it is difficult to re-
member precisely where it stood. Yet I
once heard Sam Lyons, partner of the late
George Turner, one-time Federal Trea-
surer, mention in court that to his own
knowledge it had been a Temple of Joy for
at least forty years, and it was going strong
twenty years after Lyons made that re-
mark.
Within the past year, three brick build-
ings on the north side of Lonsdale-street
have gone the way of all houses of ill-fame.
One, that kept by Madame Brussells, was
notorious . throughout all Australia and, in
its day, was one of the show places of Mel-
bourne. Before that city became respectable,
no distinguished visitor was ever permitted
to leave Melbourne without an inspection, at
least, of the famous establishment. If
Madame had kept a visitors’ book it would
have been priceless to a collector • and the
bidding for it at Sotheby’s would have
reached high figures. It would have re-
sembled a copy of “Who’s Who” with odd
extracts from the “Peerage.”
. The other two houses in Big Lon. were
kept by ladies who, by the observance of
certain copy-book virtues, had risen from the
ranks of mere journey woman courtesans to
the control of Big Business —Annie Wilson,
a large, flamboyant, handsome woman, who
looked the part; and Scotch Maud, short,
dumpy, good-looking and seemingly the wife
of a suburban professional mail. Then
there was Charlotte Adams, whose place of
business was in Exhibition-street. Together
these constituted the Big Four of Vice in
Melbourne in the Naughty ’Nineties.
Charlotte Adams would have passed
muster in any society, which, in fact, she
occasionally did. She was a great traveller
about Australia, and many who met her and
grew to like her, in hotels and on ships,
often wondered why she never called on
them on their return to Melbourne.^
In any other than an Australian city,
the demolition of places so famous as these
would have been chronicled far and wide.
London and New York would never have
•permitted the passing of such historic spots
to go unnoticed. Paris journals would have
devoted a page to the news item, with rhap-
sodies from popular poets and reminiscences
from statesmen.
I walked sadly down Big Lon. and around
Exhibition. The doorways were nymphless;
at the corners of the lanes no souteneurs
hung about to impart a thrill to life; it
was only here and there that I saw a China-
man, and he was a very different Chinaman
from the old whaffor Chow of thirty years
ago.
In Exhibition-street, there is still stand-
ing the brick two-story house wherein Sarah
Fraser held court with half a dozen hand-
maidens in the ’sixties. Sarah was only
a memory when Brussells and the vest
flourished. She dated from the golden days
of the Ballarat Diggings and owes immor-
tality to the fact that she once housed a
Royal Favorite, a dark, beautiful girl who
won the admiration of the Duke of Edin-
burgh during his two visits to Melbourne
sixty years back.
Old men used to tell how, after the Duke’s
departure, Sarah solemnly wrote to James
Stewart Butters, then Mayor of Melbourne,
asking permission to place the Royal Anns
over her front door, and how Butters sent
back, with equal solemnity, a letter of re-
fusal scintillating with unpublishable wit.
To-day Sarah Fraser’s unhallowed home
is devoted to the sordid purpose of making
money by unromantic means, and the same
fate has befallen the remaining houses as
far as Latrobe-street.
I traversed Latrobe and Leichhardt and
Little Lon. Then I saw something that
made me feel young again. In one doorway
was a lady in a pink wrapper, lolling just
as she did thirty years, ago.. She waved a
cigarette, just as she did thirty years ago;
and. when I drew near, she observed sweetly
“Good day, ducky,” just as she did thirty
years ago. And probably the same lady.
I sighed and, as I walked on, I took off
my hat to this brave woman, fighting a rear-
guard action against progress, fighting to
retain her precarious hold on a Ypres salient
of Vice, surrounded by the overwhelming
forces of Respectability, forces which sooner
or later must sweep her into the oblivion
where her companions wait.

Ships Are Human.
BY R. EXON BUTCHART.
THEY say she sails under a curse, cap-
tain.”
Marty Kingston smiled grimly.
“So do I, mister,” he answered. “Or you’d
think so. You won’t be forgetting that that’s
why I’m on the beach to-day? I reckon
you know the story without me telling you?”
John Grimwade nodded.
“Yes. Ran the Maud Garter ashore, didn’t
you? And the Board of Inquiry couldn’t
find any good reason for it.”
“Aye,” Marty nodded dourly. “What was
the good of telling them that the poor old
Maud was under a jinx? They’re human
—ships are, you know. She’d never had a
fair spin. What else could you expect when
she’d killed a man at her launching? Even
though it was his own darned idiotic fault
for not getting out of the road? But there
you are. The old Maud knew it wasn’t her
fault, but she never got over it. She could
never lift her head up after, and then it
just got too much for her and she ran her-
self on the rocks. Tore the bottom out of
herself as a sort of atonement. Thank God,
they left me my ticket, anyway.”
Grimwade laughed.
“Well, this one has never done anything
like that. She’s got no lives on her hands.
Only a darned bad record for slow trips,
breakdowns and God knows how much in
demurrage.” He became suddenly serious.
"That’s wliat they told me when I bought
her. Warned me against her, and then let
me have her for a song. But what could I do ?
You’ve got to keep kicking against fate,
even though it does break y0u.... And I’ll
be broke if you can’t get her across.”
“I’ll get her there,” Marty promised him
grimly, and his lips set in a thin line below
the grey moustache. “I’m fighting for more
than my screw, Mr. Grimwade. I want my
reputation back again.”
Grimwade held out his hand.
“You’ll get it all right, skipper,” he
promised him. “You get the -Austral Star
to Auckland on time, and I’ll see they give
you a fair deal.” His voice dropped a little
lower. “I don’t mind telling you there’s more
hanging on this* trip for me than there is
even for you. It’s my last kick, skipper.
The house of Grimwade stands or falls on
this contract, because the last bean of the
Austral Navigation Company is in it.
They’re saying the company’s a has-been
and Johnny Grimwade’s lost his dash. I
reckon we’ll stage a comeback, you and I.
That’ll make them sit up a bit. We’ve both
been on the wrong side of luck, that’s all.
You can’t make a go of things, no matter
how good you may be, if the luck’s against
you. We’ll fight it out together.”
Marty shook his head.
“No, Mr. Grimwade. We won’t. I
thought I’d made that clear. I want a lone
hand. If you’ve got to get to Auckland too,
you can go by regular passenger line.
You must leave this to me. Owners should
never travel on their own boats. Two
heads are a darned sight worse than one
sometimes.”
Grimwade shook his head.
“Not on your life, skipper. I’m coming
with you—or you don’t go at all.” He
shrugged. “Why shouldn’t I? If anything
happens to her, I might as well be aboard
her. Damn it, man, I tell you it’s sink or
swim for me as well as her.”
-Four days later the Austral Star, renamed
when her new owner bought her, and carry-
ing, as sole representative, the house-flag of
the Austral Navigation Company, was buck-
ing her way across the grey wastes of the
Tasman Sea.
“The jinx has lifted, Marty,” Grimwade
had said that morning; but Marty had
shaken his head and surreptitiously touched
wood.
“I don’t like to hear you say that, Mr.
Grimwade,” he had answered uneasily. “It’s
—it’s too much like tempting Providence.”
But John Grimwade had laughed triumph-
antly.
“Get away with you, you old Job’s com-
forter! What next? The Fates are smiling
this trip.”
Marty was thinking of those words as he
stood on the bridge and sniffed the brisk
freshness of the air. But, for once, the tang
<>f the salt did not swirl through his veins.
There was something wrong. He could not
tell what or how or why, but the instinct of
the sailor told him that somewhere there
was trouble brewing.
At eight bells the second mate came to
relieve him.
“Glass has dropped two points, sir,” young
Greig remarked.
For a second Marty’s heart stood still.
So that was it. His lips tightened. He was
right. He had known there was trouble in
the offing. His eyes searched the heavens,
but there was nothing there to disturb him.
A clear blue sky and a warm sun.
“Very good, Mr. Greig,” he answered as
he turned to go below. “Keep her steady as
she is.”
But Marty’s step was heavy as he went
towards his stateroom. It was the fault
of that ass Grimwade. What the devil had
he wanted to tempt Providence like that for?
Marty tapped the barometer. It remained
steady, but he shook his head. There was an
uneasy sense of foreboding weighing down
upon him like a pall.
An hour later, when the Second knocked
on his door, he knew what was to come
before the other had time to speak. He
listened dully.
“All right, Mr. Greig, I’ll come up,” he
answered, and followed the younger man to
the bridge. As a mere formality; he tapped
the barometer in passing. “Hell!” he
muttered. “It’ll strike bottom in an hour
at this rate.”
The Austral Star still wallowed her
leisurely way across the water. But the
sunshine was gone now. and no threads of
silver showed in the dull greyness. The sea
was rising slowly, and a faint breeze, fitful
and ominous, laid ghostly fingers on the rig-
ging. Soon, he knew, those fingers would
be thrumming a devil’s chorus where now
they made but faint caresses.
By dusk the storm had found them out.
The breeze, fitful at first, had grown
mightily, whipping the white tops from tlxe
waves and lashing the Austral Star with
spume that clung frostily to the rigging.
Tiny flecks of it had caught in Marty’s
grey moustache, and his eyebrows showed
white as though painted for some queer
burlesque.
The Chief was on the bridge with him,
striding uneasily from beam to beam.
“She’ll never weather it,” he growled.
Marty turned on him like a fury.
“Shut up, you fool! Do you want her to
hear you?”
The Chief stared at him in amazement.
He wondered for the moment if the old
skipper had taken leave of his senses.
For the next hour he continued his pac-
ing in uneasy silence. At length Marty
could stand it no longer.
“Go below, Mr. Whitford,” he barked.
“I’ll call you if I want you.” Marty’s eyes
gleamed angrily, and he-muttered to him-
self, “How the devil can you expect her to
do her best with you telling her she’ll never
do it?”
The Chief turned to leave the bridge. It
was as though the Austral Star knew that
he did not trust her, for just as he was
starting to go down the companion she gave
herself wantonly to the waves. Marty, still
staring at the other’s retreating back, saw
the Chief poised for a moment and then
incontinently hurtle down the companion.
Marty did not leave the bridge. This was
no time for unnecessary sympathies.
Two minutes later the Second approached.
His voice was scarcely audible through the
shrieking of the devils’ chorus in the rigging.
“Chief’s broken his leg, sir!”
Marty nodded.
“Fix him as best you can, Mr. G'reig. Get
the owner to help you. Then come back
here.”
Marty turned again towards the bows.
His eyes, crinkled to guard against the
whirling spray, suddenly gleamed. It was
no imagination. The ship, after that one
monstrous plunge, had steadied herself. She
was facing it better now than when the
waves had been less boisterous. Marty
nodded to himself, and his hand suddenly
held the rail in a grip that was a caress.
“Good girl,” he murmured gently. “We’ll
see it through, you and I.”
When Grimwade found him half an hour
later, Marty was singing softly to himself.
“This is a hell of a business, .Marty,”
Grimwade cried, his mouth close against the
other’s ear.
“What is?”
Marty was watching him with a grim
twinkle in his eye.
“Whitford!” Grimwade stared at him in
astonishment. “Didn’t you know?”
Marty nodded.
“I saw him do it, Mr. Grimwade—or saw
her,” he added to himself as an afterthought.
And again aloud, “We won’t miss him, Mr.
Grimwade. Young Greig and I will pull
through.”
Grimwade shook his head dubiously.
“She’ll”—— he began, but Marty’s hand
over his mouth stopped him.
“Don’t say it, for God’s sake!” Marty
bawled at him, and then chuckled at the
astonishment in the other’s face. “She might
hear you,” he added, and grinned again at
the stupefaction his words produced. He
laid his hand on Grimwade’s arm. “She’ll
get us there, Mr. Grimwade, never you
worry.”
“She’s holding off her course a little,”
the Second told him a moment later, with
anxiety in his eyes. Marty frowned.
“She’s answering her helm all right?” he
demanded, and the Second nodded.
Marty grinned again. “Well, mister,
what’s to worry, then? She’s only drifting
with the gale.”
The Second nodded, but still looked un-
happy. Marty laid his hand on the boy’s
shoulder. “She’s coming through all right,
son. Forget your worries, boy, and keep her
straight as you can. D’you reckon I’m
right?”
For a moment the Second hesitated, but
something in Marty’s eyes caught at his
imagination. Pie nodded suddenly. “By
God, sir, I know you are!”
The Second went back to the binnacle with
squared shoulders. Marty’s eyes followed
him affectionately. The boy had the right
spirit.
Through the long night the Austral Star,
engines at quarter speed, rode out the
storm. Dawn found her still plodding
patiently towards her goal, shaking her sides
angrily at each fresh onslaught of the ele-
ments. At four bells, the Second came on
the bridge. Marty had sent him below for
a snatch of sleep.
“Your turn, sir,” he said, and Marty
nodded. The Austral Star was safe so long
as the storm got no worse.
“She’s still drifting a bit, son,” Marty
said ; “but we can’t worry about that. Not
safe to give her more than quarter-speed.
She’ll stand that for weeks, and we can make
up the drift later.”
Grimwade was prowling restlessly about
the heaving stateroom when Marty came
down.
“My God. skipper, she stood it!”
M'arty nodded. “What did I tell you?”
he asked good-naturedly. “She’s fighting for
her reputation just the same as we are.”
He paused for a moment. “About that con-
tract, Mr. Gi’imwade. Is there any time
limit on it?”
“What do you mean?” Grinrwade turned
on him anxiously.
Marty spread his hands. “Well, we’re
not keeping quite to our course, I’m afraid.
You see, you can’t expect her to be super-
human. I’ll keep her afloat for you, but
we’ve got to sacrifice a bit of speed to do it.
And that means she’s got to drift a bit.”
“Well, what does that mean?” Grimwade’s
tone was edgy, and his fingers fiddled nei'-
vously.

'Why, it just moans we’ll be a couple of
days late to port, but we’ll get there all
right.”
“Just means a couple of days? You might
as well say a couple of years.” Grimwade
turned on him sharply. “You’ve got to
get her there in time, I tell you, or drive
the engines through her bottom.”
“No, sir, not on your life!” Marty’s
voice was edgy now. The ship, and the
gallant fight she was putting up, meant
nothing to Grimwade. Without the con-
tract, he might as well be without the ship
as well. Marty realised that, but his first
thought was for his ship. “No, sir; I bring
this ship to port my own way. I’ve got
lives to think of as well as contracts. What
about the hands we shipped? If it was
just you and I —well, we might risk it.”
Grimwade suddenly saw red.
“You do what I tell you, Kingston.”
Marty smiled. “No, Mr. Grimwade.
You forget that you do what I tell you
until we reach port.”
Grimwade gnawed at his moustache.
Then suddenly a smile showed on his face.
“Damn it, skipper, but I’m a greedy devil,
aren’t I? Sorry, but this contract does
mean hell to me, you know.”
Marty nodded. “I know that, sir, and
I’ll do the best I can. So will she. But
she’s developed a drift, Mr. Grimwade;
that’s what’s going to be the trouble. Dead
reckoning makes us fifty-odd miles off our
course. We’ll have to submit to another
fifty at least for every twelve hours if this”
• —he nodded towards the wave-lashed port
—“keeps up.”
Grimwade shrugged unhappily.
“All right, skipper. I leave it to you.”
“To us,” Marty corrected him with another
of his queer smiles.
Marty was still in his first sleep when
the Second wakened him abruptly. For a
moment Marty did not gather the gist of
what the other was telling him. And then,
a sudden mad hope springing to being, he
was wide-awake.
“Where, son, where?”
“Not three miles away, sir. The visi-
bility’s so bad I’ve only just picked her up.
My God, with no wireless aboard we might
have gone right past her.”
Marty followed the Second to the bridge.
Following the other’s outstretched arm he
managed faintly to pick up the outlines of
the other vessel.
“She’s out of control,” he agreed. “Have
you signalled her, son?”
“Tried to, sir. But I don’t think they’ve
picked us up—or else they haven’t seen our
signals.”
“Oh, for wireless!” Marty murmured to
himself. “Try them again, son.”
“They’ve got us, sir. There they go now
—‘Milvania. Two days out from Sydney.
Wireless dished. Propeller gone’....
What’ll I say, sir?”
Marty’s eyes gleamed.
“Tell them,” he answered, and his voice
was audible above the storm like some trium-
phant trumpet. “Tell them we’re standing
by to take her in tow.”
The Second sent his message.
“My God, sir.” Ilis eyes were gleaming
with a wild excitement. “I believe we’ll get
away with it, too.”
“She'll get away with it, son, you mean,”
Marty corrected him. “Get out your rockets
now,” he commanded. “I’ll take the wheel
myself. And don’t fire them till I tell you
to.”
Through the inferno of wind and angry,
predatory waves Marty edged the Austral
Star nearer and nearer to the disabled ship.
But the hungry elements were not to bo
cheated so easily. Three times the two ships
lay within what seemed to the eager
watchers, easy distance for the rockets, but
the gale seized each one of them and tossed
them scornfully to the greedy waves.
The precious - hours of daylight were being
stolen from them. It was no easy matter
to manoeuvre the Austral Star, clumsy and
heavy and scarcely manageable, in that wild
sea. The afternoon arrived with success
still as distant as ever.
“Look here, sir,” the Second said sud-
denly, “I think I can make it;”
Marty turned to him in astonishment.
“What the hell do you mean, son?”
, “If you can get her as close again as last
time I can take a line, sir.”
Marty’s mouth opened, and then closed
again. He turned towards the other ship.
There was no chance for her in all proba-
bility if she were left there. It was one
life against a hundred perhaps. Yes, there’d
be a good hundred souls aboard her....
“Two lifebelts,” the Second suggested
eagerly. “And you’ll have the line to pick
me up if I miss.”
Marty’s mind felt numb. One life against
a hundred-odd. It was for him to decide.
He could refuse, and no marine court in,
the world could blame him. But
Suddenly he held out his hand.
“God be with you, son,” he said, and his
lips were tremulous. “But I can’t help feel-
ing sure you’ll do it.”
Marty’s confidence was justified. Once
it seemed that the Second must miss the
other ship just as the rockets had, but he
managed it, and Marty, watching through
a mist that was not all of the storm’s mak-
ing, saw them drag him aboard more dead
than alive.
An hour later the towrope was in place,
and the Austral Star turned stubbornly
again to face the ocean with her double
burden.
Dawn found them plodding doggedly on,
the Austral Star butting grimly, purpose-
fully, against the solid grey walls that rose
to impede her progress. Marty was on the
bridge, his eyes red-rimmed and painful with
the wind and sleet; but his spirit was soar-
ing. The Austral Star had pulled them
through. She had known that they trusted
her, and she had given of her best.
Grimwade stood beside him.
“I believe it’s clearing, skipper,” he ven-
tured tentatively.
Marty nodded. “Yes. The glass is rising.
We’ll be all right—as long as that towrone
holds.”
Instinctively their eyes turned to the ship
behind. She wallowed drunkenly, glorying
in the abandon with which she had sub-
mitted to l the ocean, but she followed faith-
fully behind the Austral Star.
“Ah!”
The exclamation was wrung from Marty’s
lips. They were signalling at last. All
night Marty had lived in a double agony of
anxiety. There was his ship:—and the sal-
vage. But there was young Greig, too. He
had been unconscious when he was dragged
aboard. That much had been signalled as
soon as the towrope was in place. Twice
during the night the other vessel had flashed
the disquietening message: “Your officer still
unconscious.”
“Ah!”
Marty spelled out the words eagerly:
“Your officer conscious. Doctor says no
danger.”
Marty felt his knees grow shaky.
“I think,” he said, and his eyes were sud-
denly wet with a moisture that might have
been from the storm, “I think I’ll go below
for a while. She’ll keep herself straight,
all right.”
Date that afternoon Marty and Grimwade
wejje on the bridge together. The storm had
blown itself out, and an errant pencil of
brightness from the setting sun wrote the
promise of good weather on the grey slate
of the skies.
“It’s funny,” Marty said, “but she’s
stopped her drift.”
“Maybe it’s the added weight,” Grimwade
Suggested. Marty shook his head.
“No. I think it’s something different,” he
answered. “I think”-
He broke oft' suddenly.
“They’re signalling,” he said, and his eyes
grew anxiou.s. Maybe the battle was telling
again on Greig.
“It’s for you, Mr. Grimwade!” There
was surprise and relief in his voice.
“John Grimwade, ahoy,” Marty spelled
out. “You old scoundrel! How much sal-
vage are you going to soak us for? Win-
derflete.”
“Lord!” Grimwade chuckled. “I forgot
he was one of that firm, too.”
“Wait!” Marty raised his hand. “There’s
more.” There was silence for a moment,
and then Marty suddenly cried in joy. “She
knew! I told you she knew !”
“Eh?”
Grimwade stared in puzzlement at Marty.
“Now I know why she’s stopped her drift,
too. I told you ships were human, Mr.
Grimwade, This is what the rest of the
message said. Listen.” Marty ticked off
every word with an eager hand. “Listen-
ing?—‘Greig said something about con-
tract. You old sinner, I’m carrying the
other tenders with me. Took directorship
on Sydney board six months ago. Send
yours in, you old blighter. Contract yours.’
Message ends.” Marty turned to him
eagerly. “There, what did I tell you?”
Grimwade held out. his hand.
“I’ve got you to thank more than ever,”
he said. “Ofi. Lord, the Austral Naviga-
tion Company’ll have a dozen ships in six
months, skipper. What job do you want?
You’ve earned any of ’em!”
Marty shook his head, and his hand
caressed the rail lovingly.
“Not me, Mr. Grimwade. You’ve got the
Austral Star to thank. Didn’t I tell you
ships were human? Treat them right and
they’ll treat you right.” ‘He laughed. His
words were solemn with the belief they held.
“Why else do you think she started that
drift and stopped it as soon as we’d picked
her up?” He nodded at the salvaged vessel.
‘‘Why else but that she knows things just
like humans. More than we’ll ever know.
She likes to be treated like a human. Look
what she did to that idiot Whitford when
he doubted her. Broke his leg as quick as
say ‘Thank you.’ ” His hand caressed the
rail again, patting it tenderly.
“They’re all human,” he murmured —“if
you give them a chance.”
There Is No Silence.
There is no silence in the world to-night,
No silence, though the massed and crowded
hills
Lie in a silver trance, and winds shake not
The murmurous reeds, though mute and
silver-white
The waters stretch, and neither song nor
flight
Of birds disturbs the stillness of the trees,
And roads and paths stretch wide in silver
ease.
There is no silence, for my heart is gay
With song and jest and laughter of your
voice,
The rustle of your footfall in the grass ;
No silence, for the sights and sounds of day
Have drugged the night, and Time is in his
Pay,
And Love, his noose well flung, smiles
drowsily,
And packs his bag of tricks and checks his
fee.
MAORILAND.
CHRISTINE COMBER.
The Bugle.
Into the vaulted night a bugle blew,
Clear-metalled as a bell, a brazen voice
Of youth’s fine lustihood, a love blown true
From lips pressed tremulous in vibrant kiss
Upon the brassy mouth of this night’s choice —
Just one quick call, then stillness; hidden
bliss.
And then, through all the wind-filled space
profound,
The echoes coursed like darting rays of light
Upswung from earth; but never of the
ground,
Upsoaring on the wind’s own dizzy, track
Uike golden shining autumn leaves in flight,
Sparks blown by lips into the cloudy wrack
Of night. Then all was quiet again, except
Where in the grasses, just outside my fence,
Melodious crickets trilled and sweetly kept
The ground-song shivering, like fairy viols
Tuned all too high to ever match the tense,
Sword-thrusting, flaring bugle heard awhiles.
So night, a-yawn for sleep, shook out her
clothes,
And lo! the air was odorous with scent
Of honeysuckle and the full-blown rose,
The trailing spirit of the notes of gold
Rode high from earth, and with the call was
blent
Magnolia’s perfume, rapturous and bold.
QUEENSLAND.

AND IT'S
m
Magnified Section of
Threaded Rubber Insulator .
Porosity simply means free flow
of the battery acid between each
positive and negative plate. Illus-
tration above shows the threads
which carry the acid through.
There are 5,000 of these wicks to
the square inch in the Willard
Thread Rubber Insulatorl Prac-
tically 85% of battery faults are
due to the premature failure of
conventional insulators. Use a
Willard Thread Rubber Battery.
Only the Willard
Threaded Rubber Insulator
gives such Porosity*
I
That s why you get quicker starts and longer life with a
Willard Thread Rubber Battery!
The battery insulator must separate each positive and negative plate . . •
yet allow the very freest chemical action between the plates.
Just how well the insulators do this, determines the performance and
life of the battery!
The illustration above shows how very quickly and freely the acids flow
through the Patented Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator. It is almost
instantaneous! This means that the battery’s maximum power supply is
always ready ... quicker starts under all conditions for you!
This insulation also gives the Willard Thread Rubber Battery longer
life, because these thread rubber separators actually outlive the plates!
A Willard Thread Rubber Battery will give you real economy. You’ll
get qmcker starts under all conditions - longer life and your upkeep
will be less! Ask your dealer about the Willard Thread Rubber Battery.
No Wood in a Willard
Thread Rubber Battery!
Hard usage, vibration, and the
result of overcharging often
wear out wooden insulators
before the battery plates have
been used up. This is the
most common fault of battery
failure. Insure yourself with
a Willard Thread Rubber
Battery. More W / illards are
sold than any other make!
