Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chesc
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.

cessful under circumstances winch undoubtedly

and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now, I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known : in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
lie started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“ Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it. —Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-

We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves puBLIC BENEEAOT ORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life’ the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that, it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
fds
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
I and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cuka Soap. For irritating and seal}
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.
Skins on Fire
with Itching and Burning Eczemas, and other itching,
scaly, and blotchy skin and scalp diseases, are relieved
by a single application, and speedily, permanently, and
economically cured by C UtiCU fSt Remedies, the greatest Skin Cures, Blood Purifiers, and

THE SONG OF THE SAW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the circular sings !
There’s a tanging of bark as the sawdust flings
High on the flitch-catch, and high in the sun ;
There’s the greasy slide of the bench, as the rings
Of the giant gum, whose days are done,
Subside to the saw and its quiverings—
There’s the cry of the death of a sapful tree,
The joy of the saw for its fiends set free,
And the dusty rush that the saw-wind brings—
When the circular sings !
When the circular sings,
And the whistle of work for the skidman rings
There’s the graz and the tang of the sharpening
file,
As the teeth wax keen with the strength it brings;
And, swift as God’s thought may cover a mile,
From the raspberry wood, and the messmate log,
Scenting the air and the saw and the dog,
Comes the bouquet-breath of the sap, like wine
To the mouth of the jinkerman and mine.
And the trees in the bush, where are no man’s
eyes,
Lean over and mourn for the tree which dies,
For the hut of the slave, or the thrones of the
kings—
When the circular sings !
When the circular sings !
The saw the bench fans clean as.with wings—
And it tells of more than the timber trade.
And the oversea ship, and its crane that swings;
It tells of the pangs of the man we laid
In the stony rise, and his coffin and slings—
It tells the story of Archie Blake,
The clerk who sawed for his children’s sake,
And the death he met on the saw that flings
Music and humming and stammerings—
When the circular sings !
When the circular sings !
The tree goes out on its wanderings !
As piles for the ports beneath far-off capes—
Paves for the cities of wealthy things—
Sawdust to pack the exported grapes—
Stairways and halls for commercial kings—
Face-cuts for huts, and their doors and their
floors !
The martyr tree, in his murmurings,
Sendeth his bones to oversea shores,
And leaveth his dust where the circular sings !
And he rends tree or man—this fiend of the
saw—
When the slippings of Fate the henchman brings
To the clutch of the saw, and its rending jaw—
Then the circular sings !
When the circular sings !
Cruel and deadly the song it flings
From its shaft’s vibrations,and-mordant teeth;
And it whirls the notes from the bench beneath
Where the sawdust unto the cobweb clings.
Few know the sung—for the tailer-out,
And the henchman swart, and his underlings,
And the truckerman, and the trammer stout,
Have their souls in the flitch and in wooden
things ;
But I know— for I lost the king of the kings
Of all mates who have died by the rending log,
By the sapling’s spring, and the rusty dog—
And his miserere was shrieked on the strings
That the travelling steel disc sweeps and swings
When the circular sings !
* * «
And the circular sang !
Ah ! God was deaf to the cry that rang
When the circular sang !
Blake’s noon crib had been brought by his wife,
And he stopped the saw and its humming
strings ;
And cuddled his kid, and ate as if life
Were lived in a world that but works and sings.
The elder boy drummed on the saw and swung
The saw-gear lever, and played among
The belting, and shafting, and logs, and dust;
And my king of mates, so ruddy and young,
Stood on the bench in his careless trust —
And—the boy swung the gear ! Great Christ!
there rung—
O’er the song of the saw and its.murmurings,
Over the humming and over the drone,
And over the deep-sung baritone —
My mate’s short cry and his stammerings,
And then—dull rings, as the steel disc flings
This side and that side the mute blood-things,
Which, a breath since, pulsed with love’s ten-
derings !
Quick and cold is the death it brings
When the circular sings!
* * *
A shrieked miserere —a callous clang,
And the circular sang !
••••••
But—the circular sings !
And swung to the sounds of a waltz that came
from the air and the sea,
I dream here sapless and old —a knotted and
dry-moulding log—
Watching the gleam of the sun come over the saw
and to me,
And the dance of a beam on the flitch-catch, and
the rust on the hooks of the dog—
Watching the heap of the dust that the saw no
more fans out and flings,
And seeing the dust and the bench divorce in the
way of their law,
And dreaming of days that are dumb when I
tailed out the flitch as it sings,
And smelling the strength of the sap as I second
the song of the saw !
For although I know that the speeding song
Is a snare, and its mouth is a mordant jaw,
Love I the song, though my love be a wrong,
Love I the song, and its singer—the saw—
And old ways, and old loves, sweep my old heart-
strings,
When the circular sings !

SATURDAY, AUGUST 3, 1895.
The Reconstructed N.S.W. Council.
The electors of New South Wales having
expressed, in the general and unspecific
way inseparable from Government by Con-
tradiction, their approval of Premier Reid,
and his tariff ideas, and his scheme of Upper
House reform, and his £1,000,000 deficiency,
and his land and income tax, and his cooking
of the public accounts, and. all his other
belongings, the scheme for the reformation
of the Council may now be expected to make
its formal appearance at a very early date.
Its details have already been published, and
the unthinking elector, who, as a rule, never
goes into particulars, has nominally endorsed
them. The Government majority in the
Assembly will, doubtless, also endorse them,
partly on the broad ground that something
must be done with the obstructionist Council,
and that if this is not the best thing that can
be done it is at least doing something, and
partly on the ground that any extensive
amendment of the Government’s proposals
generally ends, under the ridiculous party
system, in the loss both of the proposals and
of the Government. Nevertheless, the
Ministerial proposals are so very inadequate
that they should only be accepted if it is
impossible to get anything better.
» # #
The objection to the New South Wales
Council, as at present constituted, is that its
members are not responsible to the people or
.anyone else ; that they cannot be removed
or coerced or otherwise influenced by the
people ; and that even the power of appoint-
ing new Councillors to fill the vacancies
caused by death—which power is the only
means of keeping the Council from becoming
absolutely fossilised—does not rest with the
people, but partly with the Premier and
partly with the imported viceroy. In other
words, the Council is an assemblage of
despots, and its members are corrupted by
their irresponsible authority, and are arro-
gant, selfish and obstructive, as almost all
men are under the like circumstances. And,
as the essence of representative government
is that the Legislature must represent as
nearly as possible the will of t lie people, and
be responsible to the people, the kind of
reform that is wanted is one which will make
the Council directly answerable to the
nation for its doings. Premier Reid’s
scheme does not even pretend to do
this ; its principal merit is that it shortens
the period of office. The Councillors, instead
of Holding their positions for life, are to last
for five years only. Each year 12 out of the
60 seats are to become vacant, and are to be
filled with new nominees appointed, as at
present, by the imported Governor, with the
advice of the Cabinet. The plan, as The
Bulletin has already said, is commendable
to the extent that it looks a little better
than the one hitherto existing, but beyond
that nothing can be said for it.
• * »
As matters now stand, the people elect the
Assembly—or, rather, about half the adult
population have votes, and a little more than
half of that half uses its voting power,
and about half of this latter half appoints
the Assembly. Then a little more than half
the Assembly acquiesces in the appointment
of, but doesn’t directly appoint, the Premier;
and the Premier appoints the rest of the
Cabinet ; and the Governor is appointed by
some person unknown at the other end of
the world ; and the Governor and the
Cabinet together appoint the Legislative
Council. This method is to be continued,
so that the Council will be no more the
creation of the people than it was before.
The only difference will be that when a future
Premier wants to appoint, as an M.L.0., his
pimp, or his toady, or his principal log-roller,
or the man who knows something to his
disadvantage and has to be induced to keep
quiet, the appointment will only be tem-
porary instead of for life as heretofore.
Under the provisions of the proposed law,
the nation can’t get rid of an obnoxious
member until his term is expired ; neither
can it prevent his reappointment if the
Premier wants to reappoint him, or is induced
to do it for valuable consideration, or is com-
pelled to do it for reasons which won’t stand
public inspection. Also, it can’t compel the
reappointment of a member who has done
good service, if the prejudices or the private
interests of the Premier, or the Cabinet, or
some of their influential supporters, or of
their syndicate, stand in the way.
• * «
In one sense, moreover, the jiew Council
will be sometimes even less representative of
the popular sentiment than the present
House of Fossils. If the 'country returns
the Pakkes or Dibbs or Reid of the hour
with a strong majority, and his Government
contrives to hold its own for five years, the
Council will, by that time, consist wholly of
its nominees, and its nominees will probably
consist of members of its own party. At the
end of that period the pendulum of public
sentiment probably swings to the other ex-
treme, and a new Ministry is returned with
a large majority and a mandate to do every-
thing that its predecessors left undone.
But at the rate of twelve appointments per
annum, three years will elapse before it can
command a majority in the Council, and
during that period the councillors can do
their utmost to repress and thwart the will
of the people. The usual condition of things
will be that the Assembly will represent the
feeling of the nation to-day, while the recon-
structed Council represents the feeling, or
the private interests or necessities, of the
discredited politician of last year. The two
Houses can never, by any chance, be kept
abreast ; and the Upper House will never
adequately represent the popular feeling
even under the most favorable circum-
stances, because the popular feeling cannot
be represented at third hand. The country
created the Foreign-trade party ; the
Foreign-trade party created Pakkes ; and
Pakkes created John Davies, M.L.0., yet
the only popular feeling towards Davies,
M.L.C., was of the kind commonly ex-
pressed by stale eggs and the deceased cat of
commerce.
# * #
Premier Reid, however, has foreseen the
above-mentioned difficulty, and provided for
it in his own crude fashion. His proposed
Legislative Council can’t be trusted, there-
fore it is to have no real authority whatever.
Under these circumstances it is difficult to
discover why it should exist at all, and it is
equally difficult to imagine that any M.L.C.
will ever attend, seeing that he gets no
salary, and has no power to do anything.
Appropriation and Supply Bills are to be
sent to the Council, but as it is not allowed
either to amend or reject them, or to do
anything with them at all, they might as
reasonably be sent to the Geographical
Society, or the Austral Salon, or the Wes-
leyan tea-meeting. The Council is not
allowed to reject or postpone bills dealing
with the tariff or other forms of taxation, or
with loan bills, or bills authorising the con-
struction of public works ; and though it
may amend them the Assembly can reject its
amendments and then pass the measures
without the Council’s concurrence, so that
the power even of amendment is absolutely
nil. And in the case of all other bills, the
Council may reject them, or amend them,
but in that case the Assembly may call for a
referendum and submit the measure to the
popular vote. And in every case the
measure is to be submitted only in the form
in which it passed the Assembly ; the
Council’s amendments may embody all the
wisdom of Solon, but the nation is not even
to be allowed to consider them. A House so
constituted can do no possible good. On
the other hand, it can do a little harm, for as
no person of intellect or merit, or gifted
with a sense of the ridiculous, could wish
to belong to so absurd an assemblage,
and its members, being unpaid, can’t even
serve for the sake of their salary, the coming
M.L.O. will mostly be a man who takes the
billet for the sake of the three letters tacked
on to his name, and his doings will help to
bring the country into needless discredit.
* * *
Premier Reid’s primitive ideas of reform
may be summed up in a sentence : The
present Council does a few good things and
many bad ones, therefore it is to be replaced
by one which will not be allowed to do any-
thing at all. This is the simple expedient
of a man without ideas or constructive
ability, and its mild and harmless childish-
ness is its only salient feature. New South
Wales, however, does want a Second
Chamber—not an irresponsible body whose
chief mission is to obstruct, nor another
irresponsible body with no mission at all
save to wear a vacant stare and the title of
M.L.C., but a body elected by the people on
a universal suffrage basis, and responsible to
the people as directly as the Assembly now
is. Such a body, if elected on the same
basis as the Assembly, would be a mere dup-
licate of it, and would serve no good or bad
purpose which the other Chamber does not
serve equally well —or ill. But a Legislative
Council, elected by the whole country voting
as one-constituency, would fill a great gap in
the legislative system. The curse of the
Assembly is its parochialism. Every member
represents, not the interests of the country
at large, but those—or what are supposed to
be those—of his own little knot of sup-
porters. Thus Premier Reid’s Loan Bill,
despite its manifest dishonesty and stupidity,
passed the Assembly with acclamation, hardly
any member daring to oppose it, because, if he
did, the new bridge or road or gaol for his
own particular constituency might be lost,
to his undoing at the next election. Many
members, no doubt, would gladly have
resisted it in the general interests of the
country, but as each man’s political existence
depended largely on his own little bridge or
lock-up, and his bridge was bound up with
the rest of the bill, it passed almost un-
opposed. The Camel Restriction Bill, in
which the interests of the drought-stricken
West were sacrificed to the teamster and
bullock-punching vote of one constituency,
was another example of this same parochial-
ism, and hundreds of similar cases can be
quoted. The business of each individual
member is to get what his own constituency
wants, even if all the rest of the country be
disadvantaged thereby, and to get it he
makes alliances with other members similarly
situated, by which each man rolls the other’s
log in consideration of receiving timely
assistance with his own. The most success-
ful politician with the safest seat is generally
the most expert log-roller, and the result of
this constant grovelling after small local
things is a growing incapacity to deal with
large ones of national importance.
• # *
Therefore, there is a necessity for a
Second Chamber in which every man will
represent the whole nation, so that his
political success will depend on attention to
the interests of the country as a whole, and
not those of Cow Flat or Jamberoo in par-
ticular. And, pending the institution of local
government, there is an equal necessity for
an Assembly on the present lines, lest the
minutiae of politics be neglected in the desire
to do large, sensational things, and the legiti-
mate claims of Cow Flat and Jamberoo be
overlooked. If the two Houses were numer-
ically equal, their deadlocks could be settled
by the simple process of letting the two sit
and vote together. They could expire or be
dissolved simultaneously ; each would get
its mandate from the people at the same
time ; they would have equal authority, and
the Ministry would be divided between them
in any way that circumstances might direct.
This device would at least have the merit of
making the Second Chamber a useful institu-
tion with a legitimate purpose to serve.
And, now that the present N.S. W. Upper
House is apparently getting near its end, it
might do a good and great work in its last
hours by passing a bill on these lines for its
own reformation, and sending it down to the
Assembly. And if the Assembly rejected
the Bill, and took Premier Reid’s shapeless
device in preference, then the responsibility
would rest with the Assembly and the elec-
tors who created it.
The Banks, the State, and the Public.
A little more than two years ago the business
of Australasia was brought almost to a stand-
still by the failure of thirteen banks of issue
owing to the public ninety millions sterling,
w'hile other banks, aggregating liabilities to the
extent of sixty millions, were tottering to a fall
and were only saved by Dibbs’ legal-tender pro-
clamation. Words are not adequate to convey
a right impression of the widespread ruin which
these bank-failures brought about, but it is
sufficiently obvious that the effects of the sting-
ing blow then inflicted on Australian credit are
still keenly felt. Families in thousands have
been beggared, and hundreds of honorable busi-
ness men, whose opulence before the failures
was undoubted, speedily found their way after
that event along the well-worn track leading to
the insolvency-court. Not alone the people who
entrusted their money to the banks tasted ruin,
but hundreds of shareholders, unable to meet
calls, shared their bitter portion.
# * *
For 50 years no calamity like to this had
fallen on Australia, and, now it has happened,
t is plain to all who choose to see that it was
the only possible outcome of the system which
had been pursued. Carefully as matters have
been hidden from sight, sufficient is now known
of the operations of the fallen and recon-
structed banks to show that the panic was not
the unreasoning cry of a senseless mob, but a
sudden awakening to a grave danger. Even
reputedly conservative institutions seemed to
have delighted in violating every recognised
canon of sound banking, and thp crash of 1893
only averted a more hideous crash later on.
To some of the banks failure must have come
at an opportune time, enabling them to write
off reserves and capital in a beautifully whole-
sale way, to meet depreciation and losses they
were oblivious to before the crash, and in spite
of which they were able to pay fat dividends.
The writing off of £1,145,000 from capital and
£3,600,000 from reserves tells its own tale of
unsound trading—of insane competition. Ob-
viously, therefore, the condition of things made
plain to all by the bank failures loudly called
for remedy, so loudly, indeed, that the call
reached the ears of the bank authorities, who,
after two years of consideration, held a solemn
meeting to consider the reforms necessary to be
made so as to place banking business on a fair
basis. The meeting was attended by the'prin-
cipal managers of banks in the four eastern
provinces, men of reputed eminence in their
line, all of whom had the lessons of the crisis
ringing in their ears. The utmost mystery
enshrouded their proceedings, and the deter-
minations arrived at, having been put in writing,
were marked “private and confidential ” and
with many injunctions to secrecy handed to the
Premier of each province. In spite of all this
parade the contents of this document have been
made public through the obstinacy of the Vic-
torian Premier, who, unable to see why a com-
munication of the kind on public business
should be treated as in any sense confidential,
handed his copy to the Victorian Banking Com-
mission.
* * *
The document itself is worthy of the affecta-
tion of secrecy and importance which accom-
panied its delivery. No one who reads its
suggestions would imagine that the framers had
but recently witnessed the all but universal
collapse of public confidence in financial institu-
tions, and that half the persons taking part in
the proceedings of the conference represented
banks that ear cruel marks of recent ship-
wreck. As for the suggestions themselves, the
banks recommend that certain restrictions
should be place I on the use of the term bank,
that the advertising of fictitious capital be
stopped, that the note issued should be regu-
lated by a commission, on which the State
should be represented, and, finally, that the
present form of quarterly return should be con-
tinued with but trifling alteration. These are
the changes which are to avert another crisis,
and, as such, are worth examining seriatim.
* * # k
First, then, no bank is allowed to start busi-
ness with less than £125,000 paid-up capital.
Why so ? Have the banks with big capital
done so much for the country that the compe-
tition of small ones is to be snuffed out ? There
are in the United States thousands of banks
carrying on a successful local business whose
capital does not exceed £2o,ooo—indeed, the
average capital of the 3300 State banks is only
£14,600, and of the 3700 National banks,
£36,000. The system has worked advantage-
ously in America ; why should it not be worked
here ? It is true the few examples of local
banks found in Australia cannot be said to have
been conspicuously successful, but then they
foolishly tried to imitate the manners of the big
banks and have had the success they deserved.
# • •
It will be noticed that all the proposed re-
strictions are against other institutions and not
against themselves. There is no proposal that
unclaimed money should be advertised or
handed over to the State ; none for keeping any
fixed proportion of coin against liabilities;
for the restriction of advances to directors or to
any one firm; for the Government audit of
accounts ; against the lending of deposits on
rotten securities ; for the retention by a foreign
bank of assets sufficient to meet local liabili-
ties ; for proportioning the amount of deposits
that may be accepted to the capital ; for the
investment of the reserve in public securities ;
against the payment of dividends out of capital
or out of the assumed value of unsold lands ;
against banks trafficking in thier own shares ; for
the preparation of a proper balance-sheet;, or for-
remedying any one of the manifold abuses that
recent events show some banks are likely to
fall into, when allowed to carry on in their own
sweet way. All these things may continue lo>
be done with impunity, and when the day of
failure comes the same old reconstruction dodge
will be resorted to. The auditing of accounts
requires no reforming according to these
sapient counsellors, and yet one bank is known
to have advanced to a firm, and that a very-
sick one, two-thirds of its paid-up capital and
the auditors not a whit the wiser ; others have
advanced sums equal to their whole paid-up
capital on estates so profitless to their original
owners that they have allowed them to fall
into the banks’ hands without a murmur. No
auditors’ report ever complained of depreciation
of securities or of unsound trading, or of any
misfeasance whatever ; the discovery of these
little things is to stand over until winding-up
proceedings are the order of the day.
• # •
To the note business more attention has been
devoted. There are 11 clauses to regulate the
issue, but by some oversight clause 12 has been
omitted, which should lay down the procedure
for the redemption of the notes of insolvent,
banks. One clause of vast importance is
modestly put down as number nine. Under
this provision the banks seek to obtain, in the
event of an unusually violent crisis, an un-
limited issue of notes as against the deposit of
securities—not Government securities, . which
are to supply the basis of the ordinary note
issue, but securities of any kind that the com-
mission may feel inclined to accept. And if
the bank goes broke, leaving these “ securities ”
on the hands of the commission, and they do
not realise enough to redeem the notes issued
against them, what is to happen ? The confer-
ence doesn’t suggest any way of meeting this


emergency, so presumably the note holders are
to be left in the lurch.
• * •
Not one banking institution trading in Aus-
tralia publishes a balance-sheet from which its
position can even be guessed at, or which throws
any light whatever on its transactions, andmany
do not even favor their shareholders with a
statement from which the cost of its business can
be ascertained. Any other trading concerns
concealing their business transactions in a
similar manner would be viewed with the
gravest suspicion, but years of familiarity have
deadened the banking mind to the necessity of
reform, and so the directors-in-council pro-
nounce their balance-sheets perfect. So, too,
with the quarterly abstracts, which they say do
not require altering, except to distinguish local
from other Australasian business. Yet these
very returns are known by the banks to be
entirely misleading, having been drawn up
according to a form prepared fifty years
ago, when banking in Australia was in
its infancy. Every public official who has
dealt with them pronounces these returns to be
worthless, and they are the laughing-stock of
the banks’ own officers. The quarterly returns
proposed by the banks omit all reference to
English business, and the assets are practically
marshalled in six lines, and one of these—notes
and bills discounted, and all debts due to the
bank —comprises 80 per cent, of the whole bank-
ing transactions. Under this copious head are
lumped, without distinction, every item which
would throw light on the way a bank’s business
is conducted. Bulked together are promissory
notes discounted, secured and unsecured; ad-
vances upon open accounts, secured and un-
secured ; advances on bills held for collection or
on shares ; station or other property foreclosed
on or held for re-imbursement; money at call;
second, third, or other mortgages, and all the
miscellaneous forms of property with which a
bank deals. Every manager when he makes out
his weekly statement finds difficulty in filling
up the form, the correctness of which has to be
sworn to at the head office. In the matter of
liabilities, there is no heading under which he
can place interest accrued, officers’ fidelity fund,
accounts in suspense, contingent liabilities, re-
bate on bills or unclaimed balances, and yet
every quarter two officials calmly swear to the
correctness of the return they are forwarding to
the Treasury. Such being the case, the good
faith of the managers who, after fully consider-
ing the matter, propose to continue the present
system of sworn returns is, at least, open to
grave question.
• * #
The truth is that the general managers, even
after the rude shock they received in 1893, still
look upon banks as sacred institutions, whose
inner workings must be sheltered from profane
eyes, and they make the egregious mistake of
fancying that the public are so besotted as still
to take them at their own valuation. Prior to
the crisis, the banks traded with prestige
arising from years of apparently unruffled
success, and the public were indoctrinated with
the idea that, however astray the banks may
have been in individual cases, taking their
business as a whole, they were working on
sound lines and according to the best traditions.
Now the patient public know better. Instead
of with caution, they find that some of these
sacred institutions have been trading with
stupendous recklessness; that, at the crisis,
instead of facing the storm intrepidly and with
a united front, they showed, in many instances,
unpardonable weakness and a fatuous desire to
see their fellows succumb.
• • •
Added to all this, the public have at last be-
come sceptical as to the former services of the
banks. Any time during the last 30 or 40
years, the press has accepted the banks’ own
account of their importance and of the noble
work they have been doing for the economic
development of the country, and the public
have acquiesced without further thought. Now
the cry is : “Have the banks performed any
such work?” and the instant answer is that
they have not. When business was in full
swing before the crash, it is estimated by com-
petent authority that the banks had of their
own capital, apart from so-called reserves, 16
millions, 4aid of the public money 150
millions. To their depositors they paid four
millions a year, and froip their debtors of like
amount with their depositors, they extracted
eight millions. That is to say, the intervention
,of the banks cost the business pen of the
.country four millions a year more than they
>would have paid could they have approached
vthe lender direct. Compare the rate of 235.
■per cent., which it costs the banks to conduct
their business, with the 9s. per cent, of the
Sydney savings bank, and the secret of high
interest is revealed. In no other country of
the world with the pretensions of Australia can
such a wasteful process be paralleled. In
Scotland, the banks net 21s. per cent, on the
whole of their resources, with a charge of to
per cent, to the borrower ; in other parts of
the United Kingdom they do even better ; and
it is an ignominious summing-up to have to say
that in Australia, where the banks charge from
7 to 9, and even 10, per cent, to their customers,
the sum netted on the whole of the resources
employed, including deposits, is only 1 per cent.
This is the knowledge the banks are desirous
of hiding from view, and which influences the
managers in endeavoring to impose upon the
public skeleton balance-sheets and delusive and
unsatisfying returns.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tote Fallacies.
By restricting the use of the tote to genuine
facing clubs on their own grounds, and impos-
ing age conditions upon the issue of tickets, the
flimsy arguments of Ikey and his clerical friends
will be torn to tatters. An ex-Adelaide parson
gives a list of South Australian tote fallacies in
a letter to the Melb. papers, from which it
‘appears that burly Tom Play ford has fathered
a number of “gags” that pass for facts in church
circles. The tote, according to Thomas, is “ a
training school for young gamblers,” and has
■“increased the number of bookmakers.” If
there were any good cause for the statement
that bookmakers multiply beside the betting-
machine, they would not be moving ’ell and
earth to prevent its establishment in Victoria.
The present excitement of the hook-nosed
brigade is not the outcome of joyful expecta-
tion. Ikey doesn’t dissemble an ardent love for
the tote by raising a fund to persuade members
of the Leg. Council to throw out the Bill. Yet
the flat-catching fiction is constantly reiterated.
“The majority of Adelaide bookmakers, who
were once its deadliest opponents, now uphold
the use of the instrument,” says the S.A.
Advertiser. The answer to this poor, thin,
unsupported allegation is that the majority of
Melb. bookmakers who are in a position to
know the business of their brethren across the
border, and are more or less occasional Adelaide
bookmakers themselves, howl against the use of
the instrument instead of upholding it. Clearly
they don’t regard it as a training-school for
young gamblers. Ikey knows better than
that. The tote on a racecourse cannot effect
the number of betting boys one way or the
other, although it can publicly discoun-
tenance the infant speculator by refusing
his money, even as a respectable licensed
victualler declines to serve a child with
liquor. Stable lads, who want to get their
little bit on a certain horse before the public
know it is “going,” and rush it into first
favoritism, will lay out their money with Ikey
as before, whilst lads in general will be just as
scarce as ever on Flemington racecourse when
the tote comes. “Training school for young
gamblers ” is a gag which implies an impos-
sible revolution in the system of social
government. Parents and adult friends
don’t suddenly encourage the presence of boys
on a racecourse because the tote has arrived,
neither do they take sovereigns from the
rising generation for investment at the
“training school.” The machine places no
new betting facilities at the command of a
knickerbockered urchin who isn’t allowed to go
racing, or hasn’t the means of getting there
even if there be lichody to check his inclina-
tion. The “train! - bool” lie was one of
Ikey Mo’s devices in the first instance. It has
been palmed off as genuine upon stupid poli-
ticians and silly persons, and used by innocent
or artful newspapers, as the case may be ; but
no expert who gives the matter a serious
thought can see where the alleged educational
influence of the racecourse tote conies in.
The Voice of the Country.
The Voice of the Country, as expressed at the
N.S.W. general election, is about as confused
and husky and inaudible as it generally is.
The Government went to the electors, accord-
ing to its own announcement and that of the
Sydney morning papers, on “ the clear-cut
issue of Upper House reform,” nevertheless the
Telegraph and Herald announced the result
next morning as “ Great Freetrade Victory ! ”
Therefore it would appear that the question to
be decided has got lost as usual, or professes to
have. According to the S.M. Herald’s figures,
the Freetrade-party in Sydney and suburbs has
fallen off, as compared with the returns of last
election, by 12,750||iotes ; the Protectionist by
3629 votes, and the Labor-party and Indepen-
dents by 2406 votes. In the country dis-
tricts, according to a table published by
the Telegraph, the Labour-vote has fallen off
by 12,707, the Freetrade vote by 8640, and the
Protectionist by 11,469. This latter table has
been “faked” by such devices as including
Greene, of Grenfell (the man who beat Hol-
man, and whom the Telegraph, in its previous
lists, described as an Oppositionist) among the
Government supporters. Yet the combined
results show that, in the general falling away,
the vote for the combined Labour-Freetrade
party has diminished by 36,323 and that for
Protection by only 15,098. This doesn’t neces-
sarily mean anything in particular, but it makes
the voice of the country a little more confused
than it might be. Also, it is remarkable that,
though the Protectionist party has gained
21.000 votes on its combined opponents, it
conies back, so far as can be ascertained, with
exactly the same strength as it had before,
which shows that the voice of the country gets
smothered a good deal by electioneering
tactics. Twenty-four of the 125 members repre-
sent minorities, and have got in solely through
the splitting of the vote, which furnishes a
solid reason for a second ballot, so that the
voice of the country, if there is such a thing,
can be got at with reasonable accuracy. In the
present instance, however, out of about 270,000
available electors —after making a very large
allowance for possible disfranchisements —only
140.000 voted, so that there doesn’t seem to
have been much of a voice on any side of the
political question, and the country would
appear to be very tired and indifferent.
In fact, this increasing weariness and indiffer-
ence is the most conspicuous feature in the ’95
election as compared with that of 1894. Also,
it is a gratifying circumstance that, out of three
K.C.M.G.’s in the Assembly, two have been
remorselessly ejected. The Bulletin, while
not necessarily adoring the persons who have
taken their places, devoutly trusts that they
may remain so, and that the third one may
follow them at the earliest opportunity as a
warning to politicians who profess to be Aus-
tralians. The acceptance of an Imperial title
should strike a man politically dead on the spot.
Freetrade for the Other Man.
The N.S.W. Government has, for the second
time in 13 months, received a “mandate” to
confer upon the province the great blessing of
Freetrade. The country has given many such
mandates in the past, but the blessing of
Foreign-trade has never yet wholly arrived ;
at the best, it has partially eventuated in a
state of disfigurement which made it almost
unrecognisable. The only visible reason tor
this is that no Government up to date has had
sufficient confidence in its own policy to really
attempt carrying it out. The Reid Ministry,
with the big majority of the 1894 election at its
back, went the same way as its predecessors ;
it was put in office to establish direct taxation
in place of Customs duties, and it never ven-
tured to propose anything more than a heavy
revenue tariff with a very small measure of
direct taxation tagged on to it as an after-
thought. Now it comes back to power with
another big majority, and with apparently less
confidence in its mission than ever. The
Premier has pledged himself to protect the local
iron industry by granting bonuses out of the
Treasury, which is an especially one-sided
variety of Protection. What his object may be
in taxing the whole community to prop up a
few iron-manufacturers, and why he proposes
to protect them alone, and which important
Freetrader is going to get the bonus, and how
Premier Reid can protect the iron industry and
yet be a consistent Freetrade politician, are
things that have not yet been explained. But
-the logical assumption is, either that he is not
really a Freetrader by conviction, and only
pretends to be one from selfish motives, or that
he is one, but, in this one instance, he has some
selfish motive for pretending not to be. In
like manner Griffith, the member for Wara-
tah, votes for Freetrade, but wants a protective
duty on candles, presumably for the benefit of
the candle - factory in his own constituency.
Also Campbell, the member for Illawarra, is a
Freetrader, but wants to retain the protective
duty on coke for the benefit of the big coke
works in his electorate. Therefore, the assump-
tion is that these men don’t believe in Free-
trade, seeing that they don’t want it themselves,
and that their constituents don’t believe in it
either, seeing that they want to avoid it; and
that they are simply impressed with the idea
that Freetrade makes things cheap by creating
poverty, so they want to have the cheapness if
they can inflict the poverty on the other fellow.
Similarly Mr. Goodlet, the unsuccessful candi-
date for Ashfield, is a Freetrader, but wants
Protection for the cement industry in which he
is interested; and Adrian Knox, of Wool-
lahra, who is a shareholder in the Colonial
Sugar Company, votes straight for the
abolition of all protective duties except
that on sugar ; and the Evening News
(a late member of whose proprietary is, or was,
a big sugar-mill owner) is also of opinion that
though Protection in general is utterly loath-
some, yet Protection for sugar may be tolerated
on the ground that the industry is “excep-
tionally situated.” Further, the Herald,
Telegraph and News are all heavily protected
themselves by having their papers carried free
through the mails, and delivered over the length
and breadth of New South Wales at the ex-
pense of the taxpayer, and though they believe
in Freetrade for everybody else, any proposal
to cease protecting them rouses them to frenzy.
And, in addition to all these, at least a dozen
other Freetrade politicians want Protection for
their own little industry, and more than one
constituency voted the Freetrade ticket on
the assurance that their member would do his
best to prevent them from being exposed to its
blessings. And in view of these things, The
Bulletin very much fears that the blessed
principle of freedom, which everybody wants
applied to the other man, isn’t coming nearly
so fast as it should do.
The South Mine Accident.
By far the most serious mining accident which
has yet happened at Broken Hill caused the
death of nine men on 18th ult. It was at the
South mine, the scene hitherto of only two
fatalities. A dozen men were working in the
stopes at the 400 ft. level. A few minutes
before four o’clock (at which hour the day-shift
goes off and the night-shift goes on) the men
were ordered out of the workings, as a
“ creep,” or fall of ore and mullock, appeared
to the foreman to be imminent. Instead of at
once going to the surface the men (most of them
contractors w’orkiug on their own account) were
filling in the few minutes till the change of
shift in smoking and sauntering along the drive
towards the shaft. They were about 200 ft.
from the stopes when a crash was heard, “ like
the rumbling of thunder.” The man nearest
the stopes, who thus describes it, was an old
coal-miner; he instantly fell prone to the floor of
the drive and thus escaped with a scratch or tw o.
Eight others were hurled against the roof, sides
and floor of the drive, and were killed instantly.
A ninth had his thigh and other bones broken,
and sustained also concussion of the brain, from
which he died the next day. An inquest was
opened and concluded on the day following the
accident : but the public are nob likely to have
got a very clear idea of the cause from the
reports of the evidence. What was absolutely
unique about the accident was that the men
were 200 ft. away from the falling ground. The
manager suggests that some gas may have been
liberated. That seems rather unlikely. The
fact appears to be that a big block of ground—
probably 50ft. —suddenly came away in one
lump, and crashed through the timbers, dis-
placing in a second of time the air in the stopes.
This displaced air had only one outlet—the
6xB drive in which the men w r ere; It lifted
them from their feet and threw them against
the roof. The gas theory is not wanted, nor is
it tenable. The real cause of the trouble w'as
that the ground came away in one lump. Tens
of thousands of tons of ore and mullock
have fallen in these mines before, but the
ground has alw'ays come aw'ay scrap by
scrap, and there has thus been no sudden big
displacement of air ; and mostly, too, there has
been more than one vent for the displaced air.
Just what caused this huge mass to fall bodily
probably we shall never know. It may have
been due—this is the most likely-looking
theory—to the “ winding ” of ore by the open-
ing-up of passages for purposes of ventilation
in accordance with the instructions of the
mining-inspector; the “winding” of ore being
the miners’ term for the change which com-
monly takes place in ore upon exposure to free
atmospheric action. What miners will conclude
from the accident (which the jury rightly des-
cribed as unprecedented) is that for them the
danger from “creeps” is not over when they
are out of the range of falling stones, as they
have hitherto supposed; and what managers will
probably conclude is that there are safer things
than to have big stopes connected with the sur-
face by only a single long-drive and a shaft.
Australia v. the Northern Territory.
The policy recommended by the Northern
Territory Commission for dealing with S.A.’s
ugly duckling—which is so long in turning into
a swan—could, of course, have been generally
outlined by anybody beforehand. The Com-
mission merely descends from generalities to
Particulars. The end—development of the
f.T. into independence of S.A. revenue—is
obviously only possible through fostering N.T.
industries ; the Commission suggests definite
means. These are, broadly : (1) the importa-
tion of regulated colored labor ; (2) a transcon-
tinental land-grant railway ; (3) advertise-
ment based on exploration ; (4) experimental
farming by Government, particularly cane-
farming ; (5) assistance to cane-farmers to erect
central mills, on tbe Q. system. Three mem-
bers of the Commission refuse to recommend
colored labor; two refuse to recommend the
land-grant railway. And the question for
S.A, Parliament to decide is simply this:
Are N.T. interests to take precedence of pan-
Australian interests ; or is the boot to be put
on the other leg ? If the Territory comes first,
the Commission’s policy will be swallowed
whole. Every item is manifestly to the Terri-
tory’s commercial advantage : possibly to the
temporary commercial advantage of S.A. If
the ideal of a white Australia is upper-
most, then the admission of further colored
labor to the Territory is impossible, and
greater restrictions must be placed on that
already there.' The transcontinental land-grant
railway project has nothing in it. If the con-
ditions are fair to the people, no syndicate
would carry them out; as they are bound to be
unfair, Parliament cannot accept them. Look
at Westralia and Maoriland. Let S.A. rest
satisfied with giving effect to recommendations
3, 4 and 5. Number One should be trodden under
by every Democrat. There is nothing so vital
to Australia as the preservation of her terri-
tory for white races. Give the Yellow Man
once firm foothold in the North and he will
gradually overrun the continent. Regulations
are useless: cheap labor defies all boun-
daries. The more employers have, the more
they want. Queensland started with the
regulated Kanaka, now she has the unregulated
Coolie, the Jav. and the Jap., and cries out for
fresh slaves from New Guinea. The sore has
become a cancer, and the cancer a plague. At
all costs, South Australia should refuse to fol-
low that disastrous example.
Representative Government doesn’t amount
to much in Westralia. Of the 20,000 male
adults on the three goldfields only 1162 have
votes. There are 12,884 electors on the roll
altogether; in one electorate one member re-
presents 1859 of these ; in another one member
represents just 24. Seven members represent
among them 7038 electors, and seven more only
represent 365. The Ministers all sit for remote,
God-forgotten wastes where two men and a lame
dog are gathered together, and the whole of
the big Government majority only represents
about 4000 electors, or a third of the voting
power of the province! By-and-bye it will
probably represent only about one-tenth of the
electors, but it may easily be a good working
majority all the same. In about 15 electorates
population is increasing fast, and a beastly
democratic spirit is manifesting itself, and
before long these will return live members
who have no respect for the old Forrest
traditions. But 18 desolate electorates, whose
combined population won’t equal that of the
constituency of West Perth alone, still remain
to give a solid squatter-vote for the good cause
of stagnation. And, as no new-comer with
progressive ideas in his head stays long enough
in any of these localities to acquire the suffrage,
the two-men-and-a-dog vote of the Grey or the
Gascoyne is equal to that of 10,000 new men at
Perth or Coolgardie. But the gold discoveries
will probably keep spreading, and, by and bye,
25 democrats from the East will acquire elec-
toral-rights in Sholl’s constituency and out-
vote his 24 supporters, or 40 new' men will
swamp Minister Richardson’s district, and
leave that potentate in a minority of three.
Six hundred judiciously-distributed new voters
could turn out the whole Westralian Ministry
just now, even if its old constituents gave a
block vote in its favor.
S. M. Herald compares the flour-and-egg ameni-
ties of New South Wales election with the
vigorous manifestations of opinion at English
ditto —when, among other proofs of enthusiasm,
a rough floored Lady Mountmorres. The com-
parison goes in favor of Australians for three
chief reasons—they are more intelligent, and
care less for party ; they are more sober ; and,
on the whole, they are more chivalrous. Aus-
tralians are not particularly courteous to their
women ; there is a cynical give-and-take com-
radeship between the sexes; but, at all events, a
woman need fear no violence from an Australian
mob. The South and Midlands Englishman
hits a woman as readily as a man—more readily,
because he isn’t frightened she’ll hit back. In
the remarkable sketches of London East-end
life called “ Tales of a Mean Street,” recently
published by Arthur Morrison, the bashing
of women is a leading incident in several stories.
The wife and mother are bashed as a matter of
course, and strange females are occasionally
fondled. Of one Mrs. Perkins, who “ met
with an accident,” it is related that—
A dweller in Stidder’s Rents overtook her one night,
and, having vigorously punched her in the face and
breast, kicked her and jumped on her for five minutes as
she lay on the pavement. (In the dark, it afterwards
appeared, he had mistaken her for his mother.)
Nobody takes much notice of these little inci-
dents in England—they all go as a matter of
course ; and Labouchere’s pillory in Truth
recites you every week the case of the brutal
wife-beater who is fined 10s., and the turnip-
stealing tramp who gets six months hard. As
a matter of fact, British fair play never existed,
nor British chivalry either. All the real re-
spect paid to English women is paid by the
intrusive Celtic element : the Saxons in the
“ upper classes ” are drilled into conventional
politeness, and the Saxons in the “ lower
classes ” are boors pure and simple.
Major Steward’s bill for the appointment
of an elective Ministry turns up every year in
Maoriland Assembly, and, sooner or later, it will
evidently become law. This year two of its lead-
ing supporters were absent, and the Seddon
Ministry voted solid against it, yet it was rejected,
by only eight votes.

“ Youth ” goes on its vast and hunky
way at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and, the intervals
having been judiciously pruned in various places,
Private Rignold now returns to his old home,
with no overcoat, on a frosty night, about 11.5
p.m. His father, Pastor Sterling Whyte, goes
across the stage a few minutes previously, and
chatters his teeth among the tombstones as a
guarantee of good faith. Regarded as a spectacle,
“Youth,” is as good as it ever was ; nevertheless,
The Bulletin is consumed with an inward sus-
picion gnawing at its vitals to the effect that the
big drama is inopportune. It was a great affair
some years ago, in the Soudan-goat days, when
martial ardour pervaded the land, and any allu-
sion to the old flag raised a glow under everybody’s
waistcoat; as if he had swallowed a lighted match.
But now, martial ardour is as flat as a fallen
tombstone, and there is talk of using Australia’s
one big ironclad as a frozen-meat store, and the
Lancers feel ridiculous, and the great national
oocked-hat looks, in a metaphorical sort of way,
as if a steam-hammer had been on top of it.
Therefore, Private Rignold’s desperate attitude
with the flag in the desert doesn’t seem real,
somehow, and is vaguely suggestive of a mailed
crusader applying for a job at the Labor
Bureau.
m * •
Mr. Rignold, by the way, proposes
to retire altogether from Her Majesty’s
in a week or two, after a seven years’
gallant struggle with fortune, and the big theatre
is to pass into other hands. During his tenancy,
G.R. has staged more dramas than anyone would
care to count, and has staged them all well and
most of them gorgeously. Also, he has consis-
tently played the giddy young hero, and has been
betrayed by a long succession of villains, and has
come home on more than a thousand occasions to
find his hopes blasted, or to discover a letter on
the table which explained everything, or to be
arrested on suspicion, or to learn that he was
deceived by his faithless wife, or that she was
showing signs of consumption, or was gone, or
had another husband living, or else to find another
man’s hat and the odor of a strange cigar on the
Semises. After this long period of service Mr.
ignold must require a rest, but his depar-
ture will leave a very big hiatus in Sydney.
He has become an institution in that city, and
even those who have supported him badly of late
have felt a sort of comfort in knowing that he
was still there. And the knowledge that he is no
longer there will make people feel much as they
would if Parkes went into the Benevolent Asylum.

The present bill at Sydney Lyceum expires

Sydney Empire has added two “ lunatic
skaters ” to the bill, and, after due consideration,
The Bulletin reports that their insanity is
obviously incurable. Something might be done
to alleviate their affliction by light diet, change of
scene, and plaintive music which would recall
memories of home, but no lasting cure can be ex-
pected. They are not violent; their case is rather
one of gentle melancholy on wheels. In addition
to these two sufferers the show now possesses “ the
greatest baritone of the age.” This person’s name
is Chandler, which is probably the cause of it,
unless he got it through neglect in infancy. These
remarks are not meant to be offensive; they
merely arise through this paper’s temper having
been soured by cold feet.

Sydney Tivoli, during the continued
absence of H. Rickards, is endeavoring to attract
the fleeting dollar by adding the acrobatic Leopold
Brothers (three of them) and their dog Nipper, to
its other attractions. The Leopolds are clever
acrobats, and Nipper is a beast of dark and un-
wholesome sagacity whose knowledge of the
wickedness of this world is awful in its immensity.
Also, he has a taste for art, and sketches in his
leisure hours, but is loose in his religious views
and given to drink and needs to have his hair cut.

Mr. A. L. Cunard, the illusionist, well-
known in Sydney a good many years ago, is
running a morally unobjectionable little show at
Sydney School of Arts. The co. consists of
Cunard himself, Miss Helen Gordon, two little
maids who sing and dance very prettily, and a
wild-haired parson who lays violent hands on the
Kiano. It is strongest in the musical department,
[iss Gordon’s performances on the mandolin
being very good ; and its next best point is the
two child dancers, whose high kick is a graceful
and poetic performance, and full of soul —what-
ever that may be. There isn’t much of the show,
however, and some of it is rather old and slow.
* # * *
Haddon Chambers’ “John-a-Dreams,” as
performed at Melb. Princess’s by the B. and B.
company, is an irritating play. Its chief charac-
ters don’t live, its sensationalism is sickly, much
of the dialogue is high-spirited nonsense. An
animal young baronet, and a poetic opium-eater,
who looks 15 years his senior, are supposed to have
vowed eternal friendship in their college days.
They speak of this verdant, unworldly arrange-
ment as “ the Oxford compact,” and the first cur-
tain falls upon the dreamer reminding his impos-
sible chum that “the Oxford compact said noth-
ing about a Woman.” The compactors go cruising
together on the baronet’s yacht; there is but one
spinster aboard, a professional vocalist, and they
both love her in their respective styles. “God
help the man who comes between that woman and
me !” shouts the titled sensualist; but the dreamer,
with his weakness for quoting heavy poetry and bab-
bling of the purple sea, does oorne between them.
The woman turns out to be a reclaimed Traviata,
the daughter, moreover, of an immoral mother.
She is now the most-saved sinner on record. Her
rapt expression of countenance denotes purity
divine ; her demeanor is remarkable for modest
simplicity ; she must have borrowed her new being
from an archangel’s sister. When this unparal-
leled Magdalene confesses her past career and
parentage to the dreamer’s father, the old gentle-
man—who, being a parson, knows a thing or two
on the subject—declares that her regeneration
astounds him. Naturally. An ex-street-walker
may become a virtuous woman in fact, as well as
at heart and soul, but the very soul which rises
superior to vicious circumstances will never mirror
itself in eyes that smile like a child’s,
m m •
The dreamer, who doesn’t shrink from his
girl’s unhappy past, swears off opium for her sake.
But the baronet treacherously drugs his friend,
despite their awful Oxford compact, and lures
Kate Cloud aboard Ida lugger, on the understand-
ing that she will sail around by herself. She,
poor little innocent, forgets the baronet’s true
character, and is blind to his obvious design,
therefore she shrieks when he suddenly flings his
arms round her, and orders the vessel to put out
to sea. Just as the crew are weighing anchor the
drugged dreamer arrives with his papa, where-
upon the wicked baronet runs down an invisible
gangway and escapes in the captain’s gig, or com-
mits suicide from the poop. Anyway, he dis-
appears for good. The dreamer, his parent, and
the ecstatic Kate, go cruising on their own, and
the drama concludes with a beautiful marine
panorama, which worked unsatisfactorily on
Saturday night.

Miss Faber is charming but quite uncon-
vincing, as Kate Cloud. This intelligent actress
suffers from Mrs. Brough’s pet mannerism, in an
exaggerated form. She has an air of supernatural
virtue. No lady was ever as saintly as Miss
Faber looks. The scarcity of detail in her acting
is also very apparent in parts that require the ex-
pression of many and varied emotions. Tither-
adge is discreetly feeble in the false capacity of
the dreamer, but in “going off” under the in-
fluence of the narcotic he scores a fine medical
effect. Cecil Ward and Boucicault play the bad
baronet and the aged parson on orthodox lines.
The most pleasing performance is Miss Ollitfe’s.
She has nothing to do with the story. She
figures casually as a soulful sassiety wife
trying to stir up a prosaic husband to jea-
lousy by flirting with an ass. The three
characters have a small slice of the play
entirely to themselves, and Miss Olliffe is well
supported by Messrs. Dorrington and Granville
Blake. The latter gentleman made his first
appearance in Australia as the husband aforesaid,
and is seemingly an excellent actor of the heavy-
easy type.

“ John-a-Dreams,” which can’t do any
good for the management, will be followed by re-
vivals. Another turn of “ Mrs. Tanqueray ”
would probably give more satisfaction just now
than any other play on the B. and B. list. Four
nights of it last week yielded full houses, and the
public were beginning to talk about Miss Olliffe’s
very sincere performance when it had to make way
for the new show.

Bland Holt’s success at Melbourne Royal
promises to be intensified, rather than otherwise,
by “A Sailor’s Knot.” There is somewhat of
long ago in Pettitt’s lively narrative. It dates
back to a time when two heroes courted the same
maiden, and the one who didn’t win the prize
wasn’t bound to die out of hand, but was allowed
to live on and remain just as much of a herons
before. The chief reprobate in “A Sailor’s Knot”
has his broad-comedy moments, and in no way
resembles the fraudulent trustee or machiavellian
guardian of the present day. A jolly young
waterman spars up to the opulent fiend, visiting
him heavily on the ribs and chest, and making
things pleasant. Also, the fiend is carried off
by the press-gang, along with the gallant young
tar he has plotted to undo. It is a bright, pic-
turesque drama. A dim sense of Wellington and
Bonaparte fills the air, so to speak, and one feels
that the House of Lords, throughout the war, is
doing nothing in particular with the best inten-
tions, and that the Ministry falls under the table
after dinner, as statesmen used to fall in the good
old days. The sailor-lad who secures Miss Hilda
Spong is open to a few objections, it is true. He
wears a comio flaxen wig, and his wedding gar-
ments fit his plump proportions so tightly that
they threaten to burst when he heaves a sigh of
satisfaction. Fortunately the King’s myrmidons
capture him before he oan get married, and his suit
holds out. The first scene of this drama is the
deck of the Dauntless, where Walter Baker
appeals to the pressed seamen to shake off their
disloyalty and fight the foe like men. The mal-
contents are, for the most part, girls in disguise,
like the crew of the Hot Cross Bun, but they
draw their cutlasses and whoop with a Hinglish
enthusiasm which no manager, except Bland Holt,
seems capable of inspiring. The BULLETIN has
had several occasions to speak kindly of “ A
Sailor’s Knot,” and it feels much pleasure in
bestowing another blessing upon that richly-
colored production at popular prices.

The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, according to
Miss Olliffe, was a mad woman, with a wilder
temper and a softer heart than the person intro-
duced to Australia last year. Mrs. Brough
seemed to bid outright for the sympathy of her
audience ; Miss Ollitfe is a Paula who wins pity
for her evident sense of failure when she has
vainly striven to be reasonable. Her nervous
weakness is pathetic, and, perhaps, brings tears
into eyes that witnessed the more generally effec-
tive performance of Mrs. Brough without blinking.
Suicide is inevitable with this Paula, whereas the
other was sane enough to have found relief in
smashing the furniture. Miss Olliffe suggests
that the courtesan was a wayward, unhappy, re-
morseful girl during the years before her marriage
with Tanqueray, and that she has a strong tendency
to brandy and drugs. Mrs. Brough represented
one who had found a good deal of satisfaction in a
giddy career, and was secretly sorry for having
changed her state.

The “Temple of Light” show, at Melb.
Town Hall, became respectably giddy in its latter
days, when the novelty of the polyorama had
departed and the public refused to take any more
interest in the proceedings. There were attempts
at play-acting interspersed with lectures, dis-
solving views and song ; also skirt-dancing by
youthful maidens of the hupper classes. The
Church demurely approves of this healthy exer-
cise, when the leg outlines are not too pronounced
and the parents of the young garabollers are look-
ing on. Even the serpentine is permissible
within these limits. Last week a fair young 15-
year-old danced the serpentine, and portraits of
popular divines were cast upon her skirts by a
magic-lantern operator. If any views of the Holy
Land had been available they probably would
have appeared on the damsel’s aooorde-on pleats,
likewise. The parsons’ photos, on the glancing
drapery suggested a new means of spreading the
Word. Why not throw texts and timely warn-
ings in the same direction? “Thy damnation
slurabereth not!” in flaming red letters, against a
background of filmy petticoat, might give many a
frivolous Johnnie pause.

Though the Act provides that “any” admission

representation has been made to him, shall not be
received in evidence, the Court, white practically
admitting that an untrue representation (and one
of a very material character indeed) had been made,
and that a subsequent incriminating statement by
prisoner had gone to the jury, upheld the convic-
tion, on the ground that the misrepresentation
was not shown to be “wilful.” But, as the Act
says nothing about “ wilfulness,” the conclusion
seems inevitable that the Court here cancelled u
statutory privilege and calmly emfleted a law of
its own. This decision, which now stands as a
precedent, should be taken to the Privy Council*
which is said to be a tribunal conversant with
the English language—having been brought up in
the country. In Cohensiding with Judges Win-
deyer and Manning in this peculiar-looking
decision, the new Acting-Judge has apparently
made a poor start.
The Wild-Cat Column.
When the City of Melbourne Bank started to
reconstruct its reconstruction The Bulletin pointed out
that the scheme would probably Ret on all right if the
bank’s condition was not inquired into. But the share-
holders have been inquiring; they insisted, in the usual
fatuous way, on touching the paint to see if it was dry—
and it wasn’t. A brief investigation has revealed that
nine persons owe the bank an average of £160,000 each ;
that some of the directors have big overdrafts, mostly on
weak security; that the deceased manager also had
a big overdraft; and that £2,000,000 of the advances (or
one-half the entire business) are “ doubtful." This latter
fact was toleraby conspicuous before, but the British
depositors have apparently just discovered it, and the
reconstruction scheme has been rejected. The one cer-
tainty which sticks out in the last balance-sheet is that
the City of Melb. Bank might get through if deposit
interest was reduced to 2J per cent., and the repayment
of the principal postponed for ever or thereabouts, and
the depositors could stand the shock of finding out how
things really are. Liquidation won’t pay just now. The-
City of Melbourne’s assets are not of a kind that can.
stand hurried liquidating, and its £400,000 unpaid capitals
might cost almost as much to collect, just at present*,

The Queensland National Bank’s half-yearly
report has at least the merit of looking a little better ■
than its predecessor. The profit (£11,470) is £96 more
than last half-year, and, after paying the usual div. at 3
per cent, per annum (£10,800) and £477 div. duty, the
Q.N.B. is £193 better off than it was. It has £1,907,000
of cash and Treasury notes in Queensland, and £170,009’
in London, also about £42,000 in Govt, securities, making
£2,119,000 in liquid securities, or £460,000 more than it
had six months ago. The paid-up capital has increased'
by £BO,OOO, and the deposits, advances, bills in circula-
tion, &0., all show larger figures. As the Government
and private deposits are lumped together, however* it is-
impossible to tell whether the increase in deposits means-
that the bank is increasing in public favor or not..
Also, it is impossible to tell which are recon-
structed deposits left in the bank because the public can't
get them out, and which represent new business that
has arrived there voluntarily. Further, it is a bewilder-
ing circumstance that, with such a vast amount of gold
festering in its coffers, better progress isn’t made at
releasing the reconstructed deposits. So far as the public

is aware, the only sum released so far is a humble
Instalment of £166,000 owing- to the Government.
Owing to the reticence of the balance-sheet it is im-
possible to tell how much the old 14 fixed deposits
amount to, how fast they are or are not being reduced,
how much interest is payable on deposits, what progress
is being made at liquidating the dead assets of the old
Q.N.8., how much property has been acquired by fore-
closure, or anything else that is of real value to anybody.
And the auditors' certificate only states, as usual, that,
in the auditors’ opinion, the balance-sheet corresponds
with the books. So The Bulletin can only report that
the present balance, which conveys no information about
any of the things that really ought to be set forth, looks
a little better on the surface than the last one, which was
equally obscure. Also, that the Q.N.B. has nine less
branches than it had in Deo., '93, notwithstanding which
its expenses are £6OOO more for the six months, which is
a truly amazing circumstance. The Q.N.B.’s shares are
still offering at ss. (at which price the buyer gets 57
per cent, on his money).

The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney is in
the proud position of being able to announce that it has
released £4,525,000 of deposits during the last 12 months ;
that all the calls are paid up to date, and £125,000 paid
in advance; and that the cash and liquid securities on
hand amount to £2,835,000. The half-year's profits are
£38,063 (£12,000 more than last half), and a div. of 8 per
cent, is declared. Altogether, the Commercial of Sydney
(hows the best and soundest-looking balance-sheet of the
half-year. There are no less than 15 persons named
Cohen on the Commercial’s list of shareholders, and that
alone is a substantial guarantee of solidity.

The Commercial Bank of Australia shows a
profit of £5048 in its new business for the half-year,
as compared to £13,353, £7902 and £29,764 respec-
tively for the three half-years which went before it.
On the’other hand, it would appear that the profits rea-
lised out of the locked-up assets of the old bank—which
are wisely set aside to cover depreciation of said assets
—amount to over £71,000, and the Commercial now states
that it has accumulated £221,426 to meet losses under
this head. It the accumulation process can only be
carried on long enough—in other words, if nothing dread-
ful happens with the depositors before the institution
is ready for it the old losses must be all extin-
guished some day or other, and then the
Commercial should start fair once more. The
extended deposits have been reduced by £300,000 in the
last 12 months by accepting them in payment of debts due
to the bank, and, as the Commercial has calls falling due
lor some years yet, and has still £6,000,000 of old debts
to collect, it may gradually swallow up most of its recon-
structed deposits.in this way. The enormous outlay for
interest has been’very largely reduced by this process.
The liability on note circulation has diminished by £26,000
for the half-year. The cash on hand (£959,000) shows an
increase of £143,000. The book value of the bank’s premises
is being gradually written down, which is a commendable
though somewhat slow proceeding. The new deposits,
however, have further diminished by £42,000, and the Com-
mercial evidently wants more new business badly. Still,
so far as the evidence of the balance-sheet goes, it
seems that Gyles Turner’s big institution will ulti-
mately get through, and pay the 4J per cent, interest
honorably and meet all its liabilities—always provided
that nothing of an unexpected and dreadful character
happens, and the new business gets not much worse than
it is, and there is ho more crisis, and the depositors, if
necessary, are amenable to reason, or the liquidation pro-
cess gets on a trifle faster, and the calls come in moder-
ately well, and the institution swears off land-booming
for evermore and keeps on its present course of hard
economy. In other words.it only w r ants time—a good
deal of time probably—and intelligence. Meanwhile
there is no dividend. A dividend out of the Commercial
of Australia any time within the next five years would
be as surprising as if Parkes got his hair cut.
* * * •
. Of all the Australian reconstructed banks, the
Commercial of Australia is the only one which professes
to show how the great mass of dead assets left over from
the boom is progressing towards realisation. And only
the Commercial and the A. J.S. show with any accuracy
how the long-dated deposits are being reduced. The
silence of most bank balance-sheets on these interesting
subjects can be heard ten miles away.
' » « « •
The A.j.S. Bank reports having made a profit
of £24,931, which is £BOOO more than last half-year, and
after paying a 4 per cent. div. it carries £l5OO to the new
reserve fund, making it £48,000. It has £1,666,000 of
cash and Govt, stocks, equal to 19 per cent, of its entire
liabilities, and in general looks a shade better than
it did when last heard from. The information sup-
plied is not quite so full as it was last year, and even then
it was a great deal less complete than it might have been ;
the A.J.S. has begun to lump its bills receivable and dis-
counted along with the usual overwhelming item “all
other debts due to the bank," and it also begins to lump
its rijsv and old fixed deposits together. Its sheet has
hitherto been much more explicit than the average docu-
ment of the kind, and The Bulletin hoped it would
furnish more information in the future instead of less.
The amount of enlightenment contained in “ bills and all
other debts due to the bank, £7,905,806” is strictly limited;
that wild whoop and crash of figures may mean anything or
almost nothing. The A. J.S. has reduced its reconstructed
deposits, in 18 months, by about £600,000. Although
things look better than they did last half-year, the
profits are £7OOO less than they were a year ago, and
whereas the board used to joyously dump £lO,OOO at a
time into the reserve it now adds only £l5OO. The div.
has already been reduced from five to four per cent., and
a further reduction would be advisable until things mend
thoroughly, especially in view of the fact that, between
1897 and 1901, £6,800,000 fall due in ten ponderous instal-
ments. Some information about working expenses and
the amount of foreclosed property on hand would also be
interesting, especially with a land-tax in the near dis-
tance.
• ♦ • «
The Bank of North Queensland, which recon-
structed £297,000 of deposits in 1893, has now released
them all save £87,000. This fact, of which any bank
might well be proud, is wholly concealed by the cus-
tomary obscurity of the balance-sheet, and only crops up
in the chairman's speech at the half-yearly meeting. As
i result of this liberality, the total deposits have declined
in six months from £250,000 to £217,000, but considering
the amount of old deposits paid off, it seems probable
that the new ones are increasing. The balance sheet
throws no light on this matter either. The net
profits (£1736) are £6l more than last half-year,
and £376 more than the previous one ; the cash
reserves equal about 32 per cent, of the entire liabi-
lities,. which is a remarkably high percentage; and
the working expenses keep getting lower. The reserve
(£3000) and £7OOO of the profit and loss account have been
carried to a contingency fund to cover any further pos-
sible depreciations. The B.N.Q. is now thinking of releas-
ing the last of its reconstructed deposits, and, as a precau-
tion against future troubles, it takes no English money
for less than five years. It would do much better to
swear off English money altogether. The report is a lot
more promising than that of a year ago, and why the
B.N.Q. lumps its old “ fixed ” deposits and its new ones
together, so as to disguise the progress made, is wholly
Incomprehensible. There is no dividend, but the B.N.Q.
ts getting used to that. The profits wouldn’t run to 2 per
cent., anyhow.

with regard to the Q.N.8., Q. Treasurer Nelson empha-
lised in his budget speech that instalments of the new
loan art being “ invested by the Bank of England at the

year. J. Bull’s “current rate of interest,” on driblets
with six to nine months’ currency, will probably average
about 10s. per cent, per annum, and, if so, the province
will still have to pay a round 3 per cent, extra for the
privilege of jingling its cash so many months before it
was wanted. And even now Nelson hasn’t made it clear

The Bank of Victoria has arrived at the destina-
tion foretold by Thb Bulletin on several previous occa-
sions, and find's itself unable to pay any div. on its ordi-
nary capital. The net profits have gone down in four
successive balance-sheets from £31,600 to £19,863. In
the comparatively good times the Victoria expended
nearly all its profits in paying a 5 per cent. div. all round.
Then the div. on ordinary shares dropped to 2£, and now
it vanishes entirely, as the money won’t run even to 2J
per cent. After paying 5 per cent, to preference share-
holders there is £9444 to carry forward, making £16,548
to credit of profit and Iqss. The note circulation has
declined during the half-year by £19,000; bills in
circulation by £71,000; deposits, &0., by £200,000;
but against this reduction of liabilities, cash on
hand is less by nearly £150,000. The cash re-
serve is now £1,153,536 (there is also a reserve of
£210,260 in Government and other debentures), so that
this half-year’s fulling-off in profits cannot fairly be
ascribed to any unusual amount of unprofitable
coin in the bank's coffers. The working expenses have
been heavily reduced, being £33,820 for the half-year,
against £38,235 12 months ago, and but for this hard
economy the situation would look much more
unpromising than it does. Also, it is observable
that the Victoria, which, in three previous half-years,
wrote down the book value of its bank premises by an
aggregate of nearly £2ooo,has, this half, apparently written
them up by over £looo—a rather surprising circumstance.
The one thoroughly commendable feature about the
Victoria’s affairs is that the directors have at last shut
down on the “ordinary” dividend, and they would do
well to reduce the preference div. by at least 1 per cent,
with a view to future contingencies.

The City Bank of Sydney continues in the same
place as for a long while back. The net profits for the
half-year ended June 30 are £10,030, and the div. at the
rate of 5 per cent, per annum absorbs £lO,OOO, leaving
£3O to add to the bank’s funds. Last half-year the
addition was £4, so the situation is £26 better than
it was. Apart from money received as premiums on new
shares, the results of the last two years’ trading have been
to increase the funds by just £2OB, as a counterpoise to
£139,132 written off in the same period. The regu-
larity with which the City Bank pays away practically all
its profits in dividends is one of the worst features in its
character, and it would be well-advised to reduce its rate
at once to 3 per cent, and set aside the balance towards
rebuilding its reserve.
The City Bank’s note-circulation has increased
by £4OOO in the past six months, and its “ deposits and
other liabilities" by £33,000. If this increase is in the
“ deposits ” it may be a sign of public confidence ; if it is
in the “ other liabilities ” it may not be. The advances
have diminished by £13,000, andthecash reserve has ex-
panded by £48,000 and now stands at £320,000, equal to
more than 28J per cent, of the liabilities. The very large
cash reserve is the most conspicuously good feature
in the sheet, and an apparently bad one is that the
item “ bank premises and furniture ” has been in-
creased by over £l3OO, at a time when bank premises
and furniture do not usually go up in value. The
previous half-year the same item went up by £2500,
and the one before that it rose by nearly £3BOO.
In two years the “ bank premises and furniture ” item has
risen by £7559. The City Bank’s balance-sheet contains
even less valuable information than most balance-sheets.
That institution, by the way, has been fortunate enough
to get £39,689 from the public in the last two
years as premiums on new shares, and, despite the de-
pressing tone of its recent balance-sheets, its shares (£8
paid up) have risen considerably of late, though even now
they only stand at £4 15s.

contracts, as was the practice for many years?" And

half by reserve. Last half’s balance, less £3, will bo
carried on. The v remainder of the co.’s debentures,

tion. Fifty pounds will be carried forward, and the

has to contend against the G.N. Railway and extraordin-
arily low freights.

The recent conference of bankers proposed a new
departure in the matter of bank-notes. The suggestion is
that a Banking Commission be appointed, partly by the
banks and partly by the State. The Commission is to be
the sole source of the note-issue, and will supply notes to
the banks. Each bank will deposit with the Commission
gold to the full amount of the notes issued to it, and the
Commission will invest 75 or 80 percent, of this in Aus-
tralasian Government securities, and retain the rest as a
reserve. Notes to be legal tender everywhere save at
the bank’s head-office. The income from the Government
securities deposited to be collected by the Commission,
which will pay out of it the expenses of maintaining the
note-issue. After these are paid, half the balance is to
go to the Government in lieu of the present note-tax, and
the other half to be divided among the hanks. Any
bank requiring an extra supply of notes in case of
emergency to get them on depositing 20 per cent, of the
amount in gold and 80 per cent, in Government securities.
This arrangement is good the public,
which—provided the Government nominates at least half
the Commission—will be well secured, so far as the
paper currency is concerned, unless the State defaults or
the Commissioners bolt with the pool. The only con-
spicuously weak point just here is that, under especially
desperate conditions, a bank may be allowed to issue notes
on depositing other “ approved securities,” and unless
great care is exercised in the matter of these “ other
securities,” this special note-issue might be very inse-
cure. Still, even then it would be much more reliable than
thepresent paper currency. As the bankers have fixed up
the new scheme in their own interests, the Government,
of course, comes out badly ; in New South Wales, for
instance, it would surrender the note-tax, which yields
about £33,000 annually, and receive about £25,000 from
the Commission in return. As for the banks, they would
save the aforesaid £33,000, get much additional security,
and receive £25,000 annually—as their share of the interest
arising through the investment of the reserve—as well.
Which would be a beautiful arrangement for the banks,
only that a cold, business-like Legislature will probably
insist on dividing the profits on a very different basis.
Even if they get one-flfth instead of a-half, they will have
done amazingly well.

The latest Vic. Limited Liability venture is
burglary insurance initiated by a “ new-ohum,” The
nominal capital is £lO,OOO. The writerfa foreigner) some
years ago thought there was lots of money in a similar
scheme and proposed it to several Vic. natives as a profit-
able spec. “ Wait till you have been here a few more
years and know Victoria and you’ll see that it won't
pay,” sums up their general opinion. The writer has
learnt a bit since then, and concludes that 50 per pent, of
the people who would insure against burglary (in Mel-
bourne, at least) would do so intending to subsequently
burgle their own goods, and that the other 50 per cent,
are satisfied that the “fixed-beat” system of the police
is a special providence ordained for the burglar’s benefit
solely. No co. of the sort is likely to escape loss unless
it charges a premium of at least £75 per cent.

The most important announcement in the B.H,

The disastrous underground fire at the Proprie-

capsizing into chaos of Block 11, with the bulk of the

depended on to keep the mine going until the sulphide
problem should he solved, puts into the shade such
trifling items as the cost of the directors’ special-train
from Melbourne (850 miles) and water for extinguishing
purposes, unmeasured, but probably 100,000 gals, per
hour (about half from the B.H. Water Supply Co., which
charges the mine 2s. 6d. per 1000 gals).

“The Maritana, at Hannan’s, is opening well,
leaving little doubt that the Great Boulder lode has been

mile or two away, and it may happen to be pegged right on
the course of the Boulder, although the chances are 100
to 1 it isn’t. Even the Maritana would have resented
any insinuation of its being on the Boulder lode a year
ago. The course of a lode is entirely changed by circum-
stances. No mine now is on Bay ley’s lode, and even the
Londonderry will get the cold shoulder the moment It
goes off the rich shoot.

share-broker at Perth, says this result has been obtained
under conditions most unfavorable—distance from rail-
ways, scarcity of water, and absence of suitable crushing-
machinery. It is also worth remembering that the bulk
of W.A. gold has been got in phenomenally rich surface
patches, that more was taken out of Bayley’s with a dolly
and without water than was taken out in double the time
with a big battery ; that the Londonderry dollied some
thousands of ounces without water or machinery—and,
above all, that even in Vic. more gold was got in the first
ten years of the gold-era than has ever been got in that
time since with machinery and other favorable conditions
then non-existent.

to assist in the precipitation of the zinc held in the acid

At the present moment, when four out of
five divisions of Australia are leaning upon
Deputy-Governors for support, a National Anthem
dealing with the vice-vice-regal person seems
urgently called for. The Bulletin submits a
sample for approval. It needs to be sung rather
slowly, with deep feeling, and the accent on the
right syllables. It is written for each and every
province that is waiting for an imported potentate,
and may be sung by all of them “on their
own”: —
God save the acting Gov-er-nor I
Right /oy-ally we cry.
Our Hinglish lord from shore
Is somewhat loth to dy.
But though he lag, we toast the Flag
Which all true Tories love ;
There’s one at hand to take com-mand
As Act- ing stop-gap Gov.
And so we pray, from day to day,
To God who dwel-e-ells a -hove,
“From harm pre-ser-er-erve the Queen we ser-er-
erve,
And bless-s-s our Act- ing Gov. !”
He reigns in mock vice re-gal state,
And wears imposing frill;
Though not con-sidered tru- ly great,
H e works with warm good will.
With </ra-cious air he takes the chair,
And keeps the game a-live :
His lamp is trimmed, and burns, un -dimmed,
Till Mas-ter shall ar -rive.
And so, &c., &c.

“ N.S. Wales’ new Governor, Lord Hamp-
den,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent, “ is a very good sort of fellow, but, so far as
I can learn, nob rich, though he must have got a
nice little dot with his second wife —a Cavendish.
What he lacks in cash, he makes up with arrows
in his quiver, as he has eight children. His
father, the first Lord, after his retirement from the
Speakership, went very extensively into dairying,
and had a model farm at Glynde, his seat near
Lewes in Sussex, whence he supplied his cus-
tomers in London. I don’t know whether the
new Governor has any interest in the business,
which is carried on by his two brothers, one of
whom, Tom Brand, was in the navy, and was
most popular when on the Australian station.
However, by all accounts, Hampden is a very
good choice, and if he does nothing else will serve
as a model of all the domestic virtues, which
won’t come amiss in Sydney sassiety, if all one
hears be true.”

John Craig Beck, Ballarat's “ missing

stepped out in a perfectly ordinary fashion, just

watch all suddenly melt into gas, so that nothing
remains save an unfinished syllable and a tea-cup
falling from a vanished hand on its way to a
mouth that is gone. The family waited for 14
years, and finally, a few days ago, Judge
A’Beckett agreed to presume that the land-agent
had stepped over the edge of the universe, and
letters of administration were granted. Then a
note arrived in which Beck mentioned casually
that he is alive and well in North Queensland,
where all the lost cranks go. No disappeared
Australian can safely be assumed to be dead until
North Queensland has been carefully explored for
of him. No one seems to know of any
reason for Beck’s evanishment, but most probably
he went, as many other men go, because he was
tired of the monotony of being himself and wanted
to try to be somebody else. There is no weariness
on this earth like the weariness of being oneself.

Melb. medical opinion as to the ailments
nf the Abrahams brethren is ludicrously conflict-
ing. Surgeon O’Hara, whose evidence was en-
dorsed by three other members of the faculty,
said : “ Emanuel Abrahams was in a condition of
stupor when I saw him first, shortly after his in-
carceration, and that may be the precursor of
mania. Yesterday he was in a semi-cataleptic
condition. I would not say that he was mad, but
he is neurotic, suffering from grief. If the condi-
tion goes on he may become a hopeless imbecile,
The condition of Louis yesterday was extremely
critical, and he is suffering from stupor that may
result in dementia.” Five medical witnesses were
called by the Crown to testify that all four Abra-
hams are malingerers. Shields, the hard, Scot-
tish gaol-doctor, said: “ Emanuel is in fair
health, considering that he takes no food volun-
tarily, has no exercise, and has not a robust con-
stitution. I find nothing that could not be
accomplished by voluntary effort in his mental
condition. I have not seen the slightest indica-

tion of catalepsy. Louis has conducted himself
differently from Emanuel. He is not dangerously
low, but if he continues to refuse to take food the
consequences may be serious. He could take food
if he liked.” Surgeon Fitzgerald said there was
“nothing the matter with Louis.” The fact of
the matter seems to be that the four young men
are more or less neurotic subjects—neurosis being
common among the intermarrying Hebrews, and
a prolific source of Jewish genius—who have care-
fully starved themselves into an abnormal condi-
tion of mind and body.

Another humorous par-

reached Boggo, and the
local sky-pilot had let the
schoolroom on condition
that strict propriety was ob-
served in the performance.
“ I assure yon, sir,” said the
manager, “our entertain-
ment is of the most refined
and elevating character.”
“ Mind,” quoth the parson,
“I’ll be there myself, and
at the slightest suggestion
of anything wrong my man
shall turn out the lights.”
The performance ran
smoothly awhile until Tam-
bo enquired, “Bones, can
you tole me what is the
most attractive thing in
woman ? ” Before Bones
could refer to her beautiful
trust in man, her love for
her children, &c., the voice
of the shepherd was heard
in the hall, crying, “If
there’s an answer to that
question, out go the
lights ! ”

A highly - respectable
Melbourne girl has a signifi-
cant story of Chow doctoring
to tell to her female friends.
It seems that she called
upon a certain unprepossess-
ing heathen in search of a
cure for neuralgia. The
“ physician ” gently placed
the patient on his knee,
and pressed his wicked old
head against her maiden
bust, on the pretence that
he wanted to. know how
her heart was working.
After two minutes of this
preliminary treatment the
damsel remembered that her
cousin was waiting for her
at the corner of the next
street, and withdrew hastily.
The experience cured her
neuralgia for a time, at any
rate.
According to the medical evidence ad-
vanced on their behalf, the four brothers
Abrahams are suffering from stupor, clouded in-
tellect, premonitory symptoms of lung-disease,
incipient mania, neuralgia, rheumatism, extreme
weakness, fits, fainting, neurotic temperament,
partial catalepsy, hysteria, malformation of the
head, and partial imbecility. Then the judge
sentenced them to 12 months’ hard labor and
.£250 fine apiece. It is a remarkable circumstance,
by the way, that the doctors who were engaged by
the Abrahams family swore, among them, to all
the above complaints, while the Govt, doctors
flatly contradicted them in almost every respect,
What does this mean ?

The newest

Solemn hunk from Pearson’s Weekly
(London) :
GRASSHOPPER STEW.
In New Zealand, where grasshoppers are more than
abundant, they are used for food by Europeans. They
are pronounced a great delicacy when prt pared according
to the following formula :
One bushel of the insects is immersed for two hours in
half a gallon of pork brine. The insects are then boiled
in the liquid for 20 minutes, then thoroughly rinsed in
warm water, and placed in an oven co become crisp.
When cold the heads are removed, and they are ready
to be eaten. The flavor is said to resemble that of
shrimps.
The above is calculated to somewhat mislead any-
one unaware of the fact that the so-called Maori-
land “grasshopper” (really a large flea of the
crawfish order) is bred by crossing imported Lin-
coln sheep with Stewart Island oysters. The
little animals are really excellent eating provided
that care is taken to properly shear off their wool
before putting them into the oven. Grasshopper-
wool has much advanced in value of late years,
and is now quoted at up to 3s. Bd. per lb.

Following the recent accident at the South
B.H, mine is the usual discovery of the fortunate
man whom Providence kept away from the scene
on the fatal day. The man in question, while on
his way to work on the morning of the accident,
made merry with some companions at a pub.
Finding at length that he had missed his shift, he
decided to make a day of it. A vague idea of
evading the conjugal wrath impelled him to dis-
semble to the extent of proceeding home as if from
work in the afternoon at the usual time for chang-
ing shifts. He was met by his wife with news of
the accident and tearful rejoicing that he was not
amongst the killed, to which he replied in a voice
betraying many liquors that he was still worth a
dozen dead ’uns. This story has escaped the
usual fate of inclusion in unnumbered sermons as
evidence of the beneficent ways of Providence ;
also, no temperance society to date has ventured
to tack a moral on to it.

Vic. artists are getting up a huge bazaar
to pay off the big debt on their building. Every
detail, say the promoters, is to be in strict har-
mony with the laws of Beauty and Art, but as a
crowning attraction is to be “ tilting at the ring
by local artists in appropriate attire,” Philistines
are scoffing already and dilating upon shins and
similar incongruous topics.
A bright, fresh British dude
with gaiters once struck the far-
back town of Jembaicumbene,
and took off the gorgeous leg-
wrappings while he had tea at
the hotel. Whereupon the coarse
inhabitants annexed them and
fastened them on the fore-legs
of an old horse in the adjacent
paddock, and when an agitated
dude yelled “Thieves” and
“ Police,” an hour or two later,
they lent him the animal that he
might ride to Araluen and lay
the matter before the shock-
headed constable in charge.
Then he tore away through the
gloom and the slush, and about
midnight, after losing himself in
many miry byways and bog-
holes, he dismounted at the con-
stable’s door, and lightedamatch
to help him in his search for the
door-handle. The flare revealed
the lost property on the front
end of his steed, and then a dis-
tracted dude lifted up his voice
in anguish and filled Araluen
with such language as had never
been heard in those parts before.
That was the only joke which
ever happened at Jembaicum-
bene, and the inhabitants cherish
the memory of it to this day,

One Peck was lately charged at Christ-

up a beautiful appeal to the defendant’s better
feelings by asking : “ Since you left your wife, did
you never give a thought to that unfortunate
woman and her six children?” Whereupon the
defendant, who had been slouching in a bored
fashion, sometimes on one leg and sometimes on
the other, suddenly brightened up. “Oh, yes,”
he replied, “I often wondered how they were
gettin’ on.” After that the Court gave up the
eloquent aspect of the case in disgust, and said
sternly that the order would be for <£l a week.

The representative sharks and amalgams
of Melbourne’s legal swim assembled together the
other evening to devour a banquet in honor of
George Moir, that amiable fish of prey having
been, lately changed from a managing-clerk into a
full practitioner by special Act of Parliament.
George M. is best known to outsiders through his
tender care of David Syme’s cases in railway
libel-actions, and the dinner was a fine black and
white study of shark brotherhood behind the
scenes. Symes’ counsel, Purves, presided, whilst
Speight’s own .particular Duffy beamed on the
chairman’s left. The presence of Syme, Speight
and Allison Smith, linked together in a capacious
vice-chair, would have made the spectacle com-
plete. It was a joyful evening. One speaker
after another testified to the honesty ot George
Moir as a lawyer, and his goodness as a human
being. Long Jimmy M‘Kean went so far as to
sing about the guest of the evening. Also, Mrs.
Moir, his charming little wife, was referred to in
terms of poetic eulogy, and a flitch of bacon, the
historic symbol of domestic felicity, was awarded
to the blushing husband there and then. Four
barristers’ clerks were ranged in a row and sworn
by Purves, on the holy champagne bottle, to see
Moir and his flitch safely home. Various speakers
discoursed gracefully upon the subject of nuptial
bliss in all its bearings, and, the meeting having
adjourned at a late hour, Moir and his huge mass
of salted pig were borne away by the four esquires
in fulfilment of their oath.
Judge Madden is “not able to appreciate
the reasoning by which the jury arrived at a ver-
dict of only Id. damages ” in the Smith v. Syme
libel-case. Well, probably the jury reckoned that
the few thousand pounds of costs which Syme
must pay anyhow were as much as he deserved to
lose in the matter. If they could have awarded
the .£4OOO costs to Smith, and the penny damages
to the lawyers, they would have done it, as likely
as not. The reasoning was bad in law, but not
destitute of common sense.

Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-
ficial to the human constitution as thorough
cleanliness, a theory verified by modern revela-
tions of the deadly microbes which infest the
flesh and blood—especially if we do not keep
ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary
power over the skin, mouth, teeth, &o. If you
value yourself, never be without this excellent pre-
paration.’*

My Dbar Moorabinda—
An interesting incident in the late N.S.W.
general elections was the appearance at a Sydney
polling-booth, of a woman who sought to record
her vote; and was quite astonished when the
official in charge—to let her down gently—asked
her if she had an elector’s right? She hadn’t one,
of course; and, furthermore, seemed ignorant
whether you took it raw or fried when you had
got it—but after that little matter had been ex-
plained, she asked the way to the ballot-box and a
few instructions as to how she should set about
voting. Then the patient official told her in
political baby language that she really hadn’t
a vote at all. Upon which she smilingly
explained, that somebody had told her she had,
but it must have been a mistake—thank you so
much ; good morning.
It all reminds you of Polly Emery and Elsie
Cameron’S: pantomime duet “We want to vote for
somebody, but we really don’t know who,” though
the most distressing part about it (from a strong-
mindedTfemal© standpoint) is that Miss Simpleton
invading the polling-booth in an awful state of
political fog is a much more femininely attractive
spectacle ; than the vision of a bony being in
spectacles, with the whole Parliamentary position
at her finger-tips, driving a sloping-shouldered
husband-to the ballot-box, and shaking her fist at
him for , final encouragement as he disappears.
Among men. Miss Ignoramus will never be so ridi-
culed as old Mother Know-all, because it has been
woman’s blessed privilege, for centuries, t<y*be as
silly as she pleases—within certain limits of course
—and man has rather got into the habit of liking
her all. the better for it. Still, the appearance of
tnat dazed female at the poll, hereinbefore alluded
to, was rather amusing.
Another: novelty during the late electioneering
maelstrom was the Parkesian matinde at Her
Majesty’s Theatre, to which the Gee Gees were
invited (but did not go, as far as I saw). The dress-
circle was nominally reserved for ladies. It all
made xxp into a new spectacle—the crowded
theatre, the crowded stage, with the veteran
posed in the centre, looking the part, as usual, his
committee grouped around him, and a mob in the
distance. My Only fear is, that somebody must have
seen what an ideal chromo. it would make (to add
more horror to the walls of country public-houses
where Michael Davitt and Gladstone now hold
the fort) and so made a pop-shot perpetuating it.
The d.o. was crowded with women, who waved
pocket-handkerchiefs at the hero and threw awful
glances at the noisy gallery, and otherwise
betrayed their political feelings. One dame—
whose whole face must have seemed the size of a
threepenny bit up above—was very entertaining.
At every hoot she glared at the gods with a glare
that would have withered them if they could
only have known how she was looking. But lam
afraid that glaring is of no use at a quick and
lively political meeting. If that lady had really
wanted to drown the gallery she should have
brought a fog-horn. You can’t be ladylike and
electioneering all in one.
By the way, the d.c. was rather amused at the
Parkes morning performance by the gyrations of
a tall and good-looking committee - man who
appeared to have the press-reporters on the brain,
but who never forgot that he was before the public
at the same time. So when one of Her Majesty’s
actors came and posed in the glare of the side-
lights on the o.p. side, the committee-man saw
where the limelight lay and came over—elbowed
the pro. nearly into a stage-box, and struck an
attitude expressive of adoration of Parkes in the
brightest spot on the stage. It looked like an
undress rehearsal of a tableau vivant—Apollo (in
tweed) gazing at Jove (attired as a shop-walker).
One of the things Acting-Governoress Darley
turned up to in a pink wrap on 23rd was an exhi-
bition of dancing by the pupils of Miss Scott, of
Petershain, held in the new Masonic Hall (which
wants to have its face washed, by the way) in aid
of the Benevolent Asylum. There was a good
house, and the children danced and went
through various evolutions with great credit
to all concerned, undismayed by rather nervous
music and the distressing screech of an
orchestra which squealed in between the dances
and put more agony into the National Anathema
than ever it can lay claim to in its native state.
The programme seemed a little spun out—owing,
perhaps, to its perfect decorum. “The proper
kick for a girl, you know, is nob too high and
not too low.”
I Was disappointed in not finding the new
dance, “The Versa,” in Miss Scott’s programme.
“ The Versa ” is alleged to be very effective —con-
sisting of “ alternate rotatory and rectilineal
movements,” and has special music written for it.
I haven’t seen it danced yet, but I have received
the music from Paling and Co. It is danced to a
f-beat throughout, though the tempo alters from
vivace to tempo di mennuetto. The music is by
F. Mason Beatty, dedicated to Lady Griffith
(Brisbane), and hasn’t half the spank of the barn-
dance which “ The Versa ” supersedes.
Among recent new local compositions I have
received is a waltz, of course, but such a waltz !
twelve large pages of melody yclept “The
Cruiser ” waltz, by Mary A. Turner. “ The
Cruiser” is four pages longer and ever so much
louder than any waltz up to date. It is a veritable
musical John Lucas, and weak people are advised
to make a duet of it. “ The Cruiser ” pleases you
in a broad, slap-dash way, and if the composer
had only left off on page 8 the waltz would be a
commendable first effort—even if it does suggest a
gallop in f time. The printing of “ The Cruiser ”
is bothering, by the way—the bass-chords not
underneath the treble, like a set of cheap teeth.
Quite a different waltz is “The Valerie,” dedi-
cated to Miss Constance Hardie {not the B. & B.
arnateur-cwm-actress, by the way), and composed by
Harvey Barnett. The waltz has a silvery and
rather sorrowful prettiness, and is pianissimo
almost throughout. Another composition by
Harvey Barnett is the “Palotta March,” dedi-
cated to the dashing Palotta, who is the musi-
cians’ favorite among the Gee Gees. The march is
nothing out of the ordinary, but it ought to have
a sale, if only for the charming portrait of La
Palotta on the front. That’s one thing about
dedicating your latest trifle to a pretty woman—
her face sells if your brains don’t. Apropos of the
bewitching Palotta and Co,, a Sydney newspaper
recently discovered that “ there are as pretty, if
not prettier, girls in Sydney than Geo. Edwardes’
much-advertised troupe.” Perhaps so, but then,
you see, everybody hasn’t the chance of finding
them out. Before the public endorses these
patriotic sentiments it will patiently wait until
Sydney belledom takes to “biking” in knicker-
bockers.
The first tips I have seen re Sydney’s Gover-
noress. Lady Hampden, were filtered through an
Adelaide paper, which looks like an exceeding lack
of interest in the new-comers on the part of the
Beautiful Harbor people. Lady H., it seems, is
the grey mare, with a brisk manner, who, when
she entered, shook the new Governor up mentally,
morally, and physically, straightened his per-
fectly-fitting coat (thank Heaven, his clothes fit
him !) and “packed him off to the Ascot races”
while she attended to the interviewer. She is also
said to have a “ characteristic Cavendish physiog-
nomy,” which is Greek in Australia, of course,
but probably means a bold and jutting profile like
a section of the South Head. Altogether, Lady
H., so far, seems to be rather a whirlwind of a
woman ; only, as she doesn’t appe'ar to be a fad-
dist, she will whirl comfortably in the social rub,
I suppose.
The new Governor, who is described as a “ good
fellow of the blase type I” has been in Australia
before (according to the Adelaide “ special ” cor-
respondent) when he was Capt. Brand ; bub if he
has one can hardly understand his asking such
fool questions as “ Can one ride ? ” “ Shall I be
able to get good mounts for my daughters? ”
Asking “ Can I ride in Australia? ” is equivalent
to anxiously enquiring if one can buy coals at
Newcastle; and for a man who has been here to
know no better than that, argues either that he
must have come out with his eyes shut like
a newly-born terrier, or else his forgetfulness-
bump must cause him to take Parkes’s size in top-
hats. I hope the Adelaide man is wrong, and
that Gov. Hampden has never gone further east
than Temple Bar. Forgetfulness is the worst
fault a Governor can have. By the way, the
“ blase ” Hampden will be supported by Lieut.
Cecil Vivian Sloane Stanley, of the 12th Lanceahs,
as aide-de-camp, but his trailing appellation need
cause society no consternation. He is probably
called “ Old Cat Fish,” or something like that,
by his pals.
Talking of vice-royalties—Sydney people still
remain charmed with the Acting-Governing
Darleys, because they are such indefatigable
patronisers, for one thing. But such a wide
scheme of National Anthem provoking could only
be followed out by temporary officialdom—nobody
could keep it up for the regulation five years and
live. Little school exhibitions—charity tea-parties
in back streets —magic-lanterns—one-horse subur-
ban bazaars—so long as it’s run in the name of
charity, nothing is too local for the acting-vice-
regal patronage. It is only to be expected that
the wide-awake self-advertisers should take advan-
tage of this amiability. Ladies who long to
present committee-bouquets to the strains of
“Godsave” simply set a little peep-show going
in aid of the poor heathen (why doesn’t he always
publicly give a receipt for the cash lavished on
him?) and confidently request the V.R. patronage
and presence on their unsupported assertion that a
black man will have a new tooth-brush when it’s
all over. But, any way, the Darleys are“creating
a bad precedent for the Harapdens, who cannot be
expected to take up the running where the inde-
fatigable amateur article left off.
The Sydney edition of the Clifford Hall 4 lecture-
concerts doesn’t seem to tickle either the press or
public—though probably the belligerent attitude
of one section of the seventh estate is due to Mr.
Hal H’s loudly-expressed idea that “ the critics do
no good at all.” For my part, I think Mr. Halid’s
mistake lies in talking such stepping-stone stuff
to Australians, who are admittedly a musical
people. Does he forget that we have heard and
approved of his papa? Sir Charles wasn’t a
vocalist, of course, but his acutely-aecurate, self-
repressive, follow-my-leader pianissimo playing is
the instrumental reading, so to speak, of Mr.
Halle’s talks about singing. The son speaks as
the father plays, and, as all Australia patronised
his progenitor’s performances, Mr. H. should ac-
count that unto us for righteousness. Perhaps
Mr. Halid enunciates startling novelties to the
unmusical, but most of his patter is very familiar
indeed to people who have had their mouths prised
open by a singing-master, and who are in the
habit of admiring their own vocal chords through
a hand-mirror in a strong light.
I was glad Mr. Halle accused Australians of
having good voices, but a distressing tendency to
shout, for the stricture is well-deserved. Our
soprani, for example, are never satisfied until they
achieve a shrill, penetrating volume of sound, like
the racket made by a tree-full of locusts, and the
consequence is that piano and pianissimo singing
is almost a lost art. By the way, Mrs. 0. A.
Edwards, frequently accused by the Sydney press
of having merely “a drawing-room voice,” was
highly complimented by Mr. Halle on her singing
of “The Gift,” at a recent Town Hall concert. I
liked Mr. Hallo’s remarks on royalty songs, too.
Singers of weight do sing awful rubbish for the
sake of the cash, though they generally add a few
thrills to the main idea, if you notice. One song
a certain pnma donna used to sing, for example,
was no more like the on-sale copy than a bravura
is like “ Yankee Doodle.”
That is a thing Mr. Halle has not so far
objected to—the interpolation of a singer’s own
flourishes at the finish, which always make me
think that the performer is signing his or her
name to the performance. A fairly “ great ”
London contralto, recently in Australia, was an
artist at this painting of the vocal lily. At one
oratorio performance she added a butterfly
modern-style cadenza to her classical solo. Seeing
Hazon’s look of anguish, she condescendingly ex-
plained, “ My master—the great so and so—told
me to do that.” “Oh, indeed,” said Hazon, “I
suppose Handel told him ! ” By the way, the
Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society gives its first
concert since the retixrn of Signor Hazon at the
Town Hall this (Thursday) evening. The Eroica
symphono (Beethoven), in which Rivers Allpress
diligently coached the Society during Signor H.’s
absence, is to be the mainstay of the programme.
Talking about singers, when Mr. Alec Toreador
Marsh forges ’Omewards he will take a live
kangaroo with him for presentation to the London
Zoo, and he will also take the story along of how
he won admiration in Australia by killing an old
man marsupial, bailed up in a muddy water-hole,
at first time of asking. It is no joke to a novice
to be confronted with a rampageous “old man”
which has to be killed with a stirrup-iron, but
Mr. Marsh achieved the feat in one coup, thereby
winning golden opinions from the station-hands,
one of whom told him that he would be delighted
to instruct him in the art of killing a sheep. Mr.
M. drew the line at the butchering biz., however,
From a man’s point of view, nothing is, I
believe, so delicately interesting and attractive as
a woman’s confusion when her underskirt slips its
moorings and begins sailing down over her in-
steps, and she has to implore her escort to please
turn his back after many emotional doubts and
fears, blushings and palings, and other signs of
feminine confusion. The attraction this sort of
thing has for mankind at large is so well known
that the up-to-date damsel has even been accused
of having her lace-trimmed under-tackle hanging
by a thread in order to facilitate such “ awkward ”
contretemps. But I saw a trick in Sydney the
other day which quite supersedes the thread idea.
A band of white satin was tacked along one side
of a dark-brown skirt so as to show about two
inches of white below the bottom hem on one side
only. Its effect was that “something had
slipped,” and I must confess it fascinated me until
I discovered the dodge. A man never would,
though. i
_ Apropos of local styles—l have never seen so
richly-dressed a crowd in the streets as you can
meet any Saturday morning on the Block in Syd-
ney ; almost everybody is “ Madame Du Van,
who could afford silks and satins.” Velvets and
satins, feathers and glittering braids, flashing hat-
pins and big paste buttons—you never saw such
brilliant dressing. One woman I cannoned off
in George-street last Saturday wore a confection
of violet velvet and silk, the bodice slashed page-
fashion with silver embroidery, and a paste tiara
in her bonnet! I remember hearing one dame say
to another once, as a gaily-dressed summer girl
passed them in the street, “Why, there’s nothing
left for a party !” But, with all the glitter of
paste and the glare of satins the feminine public
indulges in, it looks as if now there was nothing
left for a pantomime.
I much regret to hear that manager Macdonald,
of Her Majesty’s Theatre, is lying in a very
serious condition at St. Vincent’s Hospital. Tlxere
are on all sides sincere wishes for the recovery cl
“Mao.,” who has fought a brave fight witn
disease, and is every bit as plucky as his chief,
George Rignold, which is saying a great deal.
This has been a severe winter for theatrical
managers, by the way : treasurer Goodman, of
Sydney Lyceum, has only just recovered from a
very severe bronchial attack, which has deprived
the “front ” of his presence ever since “In Town”
premiere.
I think one of the wonders of the Gaiety com-
pany is the pretty, piquante and popular Mdlle.
Palotta —just look how she sticks in the bill! She
never hands the public over to the uncertain genius
of some angular understudy with bow-legs, bub
always faces the music in her very own person. The
reason is that she loves mumming—she told me so
herself—and let me say en par enthuse that Palotta
in private, in a sap-green gown fitting like a second
cuticle and with a big pot of white lilies for back-
ground, makes no end of a pretty picture. She
is the sorb of person, in a word, whose Art must
be spelt with a big A, and whose Voca-
tion must be writ large—which also infers
that she minds her book and hasn’t much
time for gallivanting. So, though she has been
to “Rockslily ” (as she pronounces that popular
resort), she hasn’t been seen at any of the public
balls at which moat of the gee-gees have made
themselves famous, though Mdlle. P. is one of the
few professionals who can give a “ private view ”
of themselves without damaging their footlight
reputation. Most pros, suggest blinking owls if
you lure them into daylight, but the beauty of
the Melbourne Carnival doesn’t belong to that
category any more than Decitna Moore does.
Mdlle. Palotta gob a silver goblet as a beauty-
prize, and thereby hangs a funny story. “What
are you going to do with it?” said J.C. W. “It
ees at the jeweller’s at present,” said Mdlle.,
whose great charm is her three-legged English.
“I am having ‘the Population Prize ’ engraved
on it.” She meant to say “ Popularity ’’—but
that section of Sydney society which knows every-
thing, and calmly tells you that Miss Palotta is a
married woman with four bouncing boys—which
she isn’t—will not appreciate the joke.
I am glad to hear that the booking for the Esty-
Marsh operatic-recital season is most encouraging,
and the Centenary Hall promises (on paper) to be
as full as a fair. The season opens with choice
pickings from “ Faust ’’—Miss Esty as Marguerite
(in costume, I believe) and Mr. Marsh as the
tomato-red devil of opera. Mr. Sykes has a real
attraction for Saturday, though the fact that the
Gaiety Co. has a new spasm for the same evening
may discount the attendance.
My Melb, correspondent tells me that in the
matter of gowns Paula Tanqueray 11. (Miss
Olliffe) eclipse* Mrs. Brough, “ A superb evening
gown in Ist act,” is the direction laid down by
Pinero, and faithfully is it carried out by Miss
Olliffe. Strawberry and cream brocade, with
bertha of envy-oreating lace and touches of velvet,
she first appears in. The cloak, black velvet
edged with sable and lined with scarlet satin.
The morning-dress is twine-oolored cloth with
bodice of “ new ” blue velvet and oape to match.
Her hat, which she treats with much more respect
than Paula I. showed to hers, is fawn felt with
blue feathers and velvet. In act 3, a sumptuous
robe of Nile green satin is worn, made with cava-
lier sleeves slashed with pink, and petticoat of
Nile green and pink brocade. Miss O. always
has the skirts finished off under the hem with un-
expected, fascinating little frills and ruches of
some contrasting color. Thus her second gown
reveals suggestions of delicious pale-blue satin;
and the third, ruffles and tiny billows of rose-pink
edged with lace.
An Australienne, writing privately from Lon'
don, says ; “ If you take my tip you will get an
alpaca gown for summer, they are the snap just
now. Have it made with a fluted skirt stiffened
round the hem with whale-bone. As to head-
gear, pile up as many flowers and feathers and
birds as you can get, on a flat straw tea-tray,
together with much wired lace and chiffons, and
let the colors shout at each other—then you’ll
have a smart hat.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
It was a sight fit to make the gods laugh
to see the Mount Morgan speculators, Q.N.B.
jugglers, syndicate-promoters, and land-sharks
legislating the other day in the Queensland Parlia-
ment to stop gambling, which they almost unani-
mously condemned as the invention of Beelzebub.
Hancock proposed to amend the Vie. tariff
by putting a duty on low-class imported periodi-
cals. To which M‘Lellan objected on the ground
“ that it would deprive the Victorian boy of his
Ally Sloper.” What must be the mental state
of a politician who yearns to let every boy have
his Ally Sloper ?
THE BIRDS WHISTLED “THE DEAD
MARCH.”
“Even the birds on the trees learned to whistle the
*Dead March.’ ”
It was an old soldier who was talking. “We
were in camp,” he said “ in a flat, malarious part
of the country. Our Colonel was a splendid
fighter, but didn’t appear to have any idea of
sanitary matters. Just then we were in more
danger from disease than from the enemy. Pre-
sently fever broke out and men died by the dozen.
Hardly a day but we buried some of them in the
swamp. In fact, we played the ‘ Dead March ’
so often that I used to fancy the birds in the trees
had learned to whistle it. ‘ Awful sorry, you
know, boys,’ said our Colonel, ‘ but so long as we
have to stay here, we can’t help having the fever. ’
Yet the Colonel was wrong, as another regiment
camped near us almost wholly escaped. But their
commander fought the malaria with sanitation
and preventive medicine. That made the differ-
ence.”
In January, 1892, the influenza was epidemic at
Stebbing, near Chelmsford. Among the persons
attacked were Mrs. Abram Thorogood, of White
House farm, her daughter Annie, and her sons
William and Ernest. They had terrible pains in
the head, sore muscles and joints, and were very
feverish. The whole four—mother and three
children—were confined to their beds.
In a letter on the subject Mr. Thorogood says :
“My wife became quite delirious; she did not
know where she was, and could neither get in nor
out of bed. I gave Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup to all of them with excellent results ; he
fever soon left them, and shortly they were well
and strong as ever, and have since remained so.
I may mention that many neighbours and friends
had the same complaint as my wife and family,
but although the others had doctors and the best
attention and advice, none recovered so rapidly as
my people did. I thank God that I came to hear
of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, for although
wo are a family of seven, living at home, during
the eight years I have kept it in the house we
have not needed a doctor, thus saving many
pounds in doctors’ bills and costly prescriptions.
“ The way I first used Seigel’s Syrup was this :
I n the spring of 1883 I began to feel ill and out of
sorts. My tongue was dreadfully coated and a
thick phlegm covered my gums and teeth. After
eating I suffered from pain at the chest and
stomach. I had bad nights, and sweat so much
that in the morning my underclothing was soaked
with moisture. In the following August carbuncles
came on the back of my neck, on my nose, and on
my cheek-bone. What I suffered I cannot des-
cribe. I got so low and weak that I could barely
crawl about. The doctors did me no good. And
as for their physic I might as well have taken tea
or water. In pain and suffering I lingered on
until I heard, through a neighbour, of Mother
Seigel’s Cuiative Syrup and got a bottle from Mr.
W. Linsell, grocer, of Stebbing. A few doses
relieved me, and soon the carbuncles disappeared,
and I was as well as ever. Yours truly, (Signed)
Abram Thorogood, White House Farm, Steb-
bing, by Chelmsford, August 19th, 1892.”
In Mx\ Thorogood’s own case the disease was
indigestion and dyspepsia, which poisoned hie
blood and caused the carbuncles, which are
growths on the underlying - layers of the skin,
After the Syrup had purified his blood they Were
absoi'bed and expelled fxom the system. The
effect of the remedy in the cases of the other
members of his family shows (what we have often
stated), viz., that influenza attacks those whose
blood is filled ivith the poisonous acids thrown into
the system by fermented food in the stomach. Mr.
Thorogood says his wife had been troubled with
indigestion and dyspepsia, which was no doubt
the case with the children also. Don’t allow your
blood to become a breeding-ground of disease.
On the first signs of Indigestion take Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup. You know the proverb
about the ounce of prevention.

Mr. John Stewart has resigned his seat in
N.S.W. Leg. Council. Mr. Stewart’s sole effort
at legislation was the passing of a short measure
which prevents Acts of Parliaments from being
punctuated.
Mr. Justice Cohen is the first of the
Hebrew race to take a seat on the Australian
Supreme Court Bench. Julian Salomons was ap-
pointed but declined, for reasons, to mount the
judicial rostrum.
The house of a prohibitionist Maoriland
M.P. was burgled the other day. Among the
things taken were “36 bottles of beer, six bottles
olaret, six bottles whisky, and a dozen bottles of
eider.” Hallelujah !
Many years ago the defendant in a Sydney
assault case pleaded as justification t hat the plain-
tiff “ had gone and called him Parkes.” It is a
remarkable proof of the old man’s consistency
that anybody would naturally hit the man who
called him Parkes in just the same enthusiastic
fashion to-day.
In the last genera-
tion there wat a kind of
Victorian heavy father,
who doesn’t turn up
again, strong in self-ac-
quired cash, launching
ions in the lap of luxury.
Harrie Smith, the just-
deceased V.A.T.C. secre-
tary, had the good, or
ill-luck to be so launched,
and when the fairy gold
departed he went to
work instead of being
whirled over Niagara.
He was a son of John
Thomas Smith, Mel-
bourne’s six times mayor.
the renowned Jaoky Tommy, importer to Vic-
toria of the first donkey. Jacky Tommy rode
second-class, by preference, and wore an old, white
bell topper, with a little cutty pipe in his jaw, bowl-
downwarda. Mayor Smith, though he had owned
the pub. next Coppin’s Queen’s Theatre, had Rev.
0. T. Perks for his chaplain on an abortive trip to
England for a knighthood.
“ Jawbone ” Neild, M.P., has in the press
a volume of poems. The large protuberance
visible in his left breast-pocket consists of proofs.
Jawbone says it’s “all Australian,” and that it
will make a splurge.
Frank Harley Davis, the young Q. in-
ventor, has, it is stated, sold the N.S.W. and Q.
rights of his Calyx drill to a smart Yankee for
-812,000, and the Yankee is said to be more than
satisfied with his bargain.
Since Premier Reid compared himself to
the Messiah, it is understood that Jack Want is
wearing his hair short and dieting himself on
locusts and wild honey—the better to play the
part of John the Baptist.
The Age, reporting a meeting on Yarra
Bank (Melb.), says it was addressed by “a Mr.
Champion.” Delicious! “A” Mr. Champion
was formerly a leader-writer on the paper owned
by “ a ’’ Mr. David Syme !
Of the more prominent journalists who
stood for Parliament at N.S. W. general election,
Black and Cotton, both Reidites, got in, whilst
Traill, Fitzgerald, Norton, Quinn, and P. V.
Ryan, all Protectionists, were defeated.
When Fitchett was on his Queensland trip
one Brisbane paper never mentioned his name.
Yet the owners knew him—knew him well enough
to send him their autobiography for the REVIEW
OF Reviews—which he forgot to insert.
What is Premier Reid’s authority for
saying that the only offence with which he had
been charged was also alleged against the founder
of the Christian religion? Who ever said that
the Founder had a small brain and a large body ?
Bishop Harmer, of Adelaide, himself a
recent importation, is about to bring a chaplain
and another sucking parson from England. The
“colonists” are gradually but surely being edu-
cated in the belief that the Deity speaks with a
strong Cockney accent.
Governor Brassey’s eldest son and Gov.
Hampden’s brother were both beaten during the
English elections. Each stood as a Liberal.
General Bevan Edwards, who six years ago
inspected Australian defences, is one of the suc-
cessful Tory candidates.
In presenting White Knight FitzGibhon
with an illuminated address, the other day, the
Melb. Board of Works Commissioners committed
the egregious and unpardonable blunder of spelling
the great man’s name as one word —“ 1* itzgibbon.”
This is the thing, above all others, to which the
White Knight attaches most importance.
STANDING ROOM ONLY.
SHORT-SIGHTED COUNTRY LADY : “ Hi, driver, any room?"

The new Vic. commandant, General Hulled
Smith, is uninterviewable. General Tulloch was
always ready to talk to reporters, and was good
for a readable column of military “ skite. ” every
day. But Holled Smith never sees reporters. He
is always “ busy ” or “ not in.”
The outcome of the recent visit of Prior
Vaughan to Sydney appears to be a very serious
misunderstanding between the Lieut.-Governor
and a somewhat eminent clergyman, familiarly
known as “ Father Tom,” who publicly took ob-
jection to H.E.’s official patronage of the massive
Gregorian.
George Grey, the Grand Old Man ot
Maoriland, once had a very remote and shadowy
chance of becoming King of Greece. Last time
the Greeks were looking round for a new monarch,
Gladstone, Grey, and the Earl of Derby were
among the candidates suggested. Parkes, some-
how, was never even mentioned.
The new N.S.W. Assembly contains three

of last Parliament have disappeared, notably
Parkes and Abbott. The House contains 18
lawyers and three doctors of medicine.
The wife of Baronet Clarke is forming a
Private debating society at her Melh. mansion,
t is fervently hoped in a wide circle that the
Bart, will be allowed to attend and pick up hints.
At present, Swilliain’s attempts at public speech
are most ludicrous; even when he presides at
Colonial Bank meetings he seems to find difficulty
in reading out the speeches written for him, and
it is believed that a clerk has to be kept ready to
pinch him should he fall asleep before getting to
the end.
Mr. A. B. Piddington, who ousted G.
Republican Dibbs at Tam worth by a small
majority, was formerly associate to Justice Win-
deyer. “ When he returned thanks for his elec-
tion there was an immense audience, a-third of
whom were ladies. He had a most flattering
reception, the vast assemblage rising and cheer-
ing wildly.” From which The Bulletin, without
knowing anything about the M.P., argues that
(like Dowell O’Reilly) he is still single. Women
never cheer a man for nothing.
Mahlstick : “I cannot help asking the
question whether Longstaff has produced aught
better than ‘Breaking the News which he did
before going to Paris, and after Folir.gsby had
given him the technique. Now it seems he is to
be lost to us, as a European resident, and will
paint no more Australian subjects, with regard to
which, indeed, he has dropped out of kelter
Suppose he had stayed here, would he not have
furnished some national masterpieces of local
color ?”
J. C. F. Johnson, M.P.
(S. A. ), went forth lately as a
sort of royal commission to
examine some alleged petro-
leum springs which are said to
bubble up out of the ocean on
the south coast. It was a cold
day, but nevertheless the coin-
mission took off its clothes and
swam out into a heavy sea to
examine the discovery. If
this sort of duty came
along oftener the Parlia-
mentary commission
nuisance would be considerably abated. Victoria’s
Vegetable Products Commission, for instance,
which hung on and drew its fees for years, might
have been got rid of by a peremptory order that
the commissioners should get into their natural
or unclothed state and proceed to inquire into the
existence of edible sea-weeds off Wilson’s Pro-
montory.
Ex-Governor Jersey came in for a slice of
fortune a few weeks ago. A very rich old lady
(believed to be no connection of his) had left her
residuary estate, amounting to over £120,000, to
St. George’s Hospital, but she altered her mind,
and by a codicil reduced the bequest to ,£20,000
and nominated Lord Jersey as residuary legatee.
The rivers all flow to the sea.
“I wonder,” remarks The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, “if it is generally known
that Brassey was offered, and declined, the
Governorship of N.S. Wales before it was accepted
by the late Gov. Duff? Young Duff, by the way.
is petitioning the Scotch courts for authority to
cut off the entail of his Scotch estates, including
Fetteresso. Does he want to cut a figure on the
turf?”
Poor old Parkes was in so desperate a
hurry to have his name metaphorically painted on
every historical monument that, seizing time by
the forelock, lie got the foundation-stone of the
new N.S. W. Parliament Houses laid as far back
as 1888 —Centenary year. Since then not a stone
has been laid upon that stone, which, ruatily railed
round and covered with weeds, looks like a
drunkard’s grave.
The elongated Jos. Symes, in a Yarra
bank oration, delivered on the Sunday after his
release from gaol, stated that he had spent a very
pleasant fortnight, and would rather do another
similar term than spend a fortnight at sea. His
sole complaint was the inadequate length of the
debtors’-prison beds. The philosophic Joseph says
he is glad to have experienced incarceration as an
incident of a varied career.
A Melb. reporter named Woodhouse—
brother of the landscape painter—was working at
the principle of the linotype machine for some
years, right upon the lines of the machines now in
use. He believes he is now on the track of a
machine that will do the work of the linotype and
set every letter separately, thus avoiding the
waste of time caused by correcting, w hen a whole
line has to be re-set to alter a “literal.”
An old Parramatta identity and a native
of the town, Andrew Pay ten, died of heart-disease
last month. He was born in 1827, when Gover-
nor Ralph Darling had his “ country seat ” in the
old town. Memories of the halcyon days of the
famous Woolpack Inn—the home of the Paytens—
with its wedding and picnic parties from the city,
are fondly cherished by many of the older genera-
tions. The first bowling-green in Australia was
initiated by Andrew Payten at the Woolpack.
A Cobar (N.S, W.) Leader correspondent
tells how he met James Stanbury, champion
sculler of the world, manfully cutting telegraph-
poles at 2s. on the stump, away in the wild and
horrible back-blocks, where the lone billy croons
a song of better days, and the melancholy damper
moans feebly among the ashes of the dead past.
Stanbury didn’t know him, but was glad to see
him. He had just been washing his moles, and
he wanted somebody to twist the other end and
wring the water out. Talk about meditations
among the ruins of Palmyra! What sermon on
the vanity of human things can Nineveh, and
Babylon, and Thebes, and Carthage preach, com-
pared with that of James Stanbury, the world’s
champion sculler, squeezing his wet moles in the
wilderness ?
Sydney Daily Telegraph, which, in the
heat of the King election contest, seemed to accuse
a reputed local millionaire, Mr. Ebenezer Vickery,
of endeavouring to corruptly influence votes, was
quite right to fully apologise on finding its infor*
mation unsubstantial. Mr. Vickery, as a libel*
litigant, would probably be “a terror.” He II
credited with having carried on one law-suit fos
something like 25 years. In fact, a man who, at
the initiation of the suit, was unborn, subsequently
appeared as a lawyer in the case.
Tarbeaux, the brilliant card-sharper, lately
convicted in England of nearly killing a man with
a cutlass, and who once gave Sydney a tasteol
his “spieling” abilities, is “the offspring of a
gipsy father and an Indian squaw.” What a
pedigree, and how he ought to be able to play
poker and fight with a knife ! The coldest-blooded
poker-players The Bulletin has ever seen were
all Americans and all evidently possessed of
Indian blood; they were men with freezing, glit-
tering black eyes and pallid faces, and each of
them was as taciturn as Sitting Bull. One of
them was well-known in Australia as a mining-
operator, and another as a mine-manager and
how he did manage that mine! After you had
seen them gamble for hundreds for hours at a
stretch, and watched the occasional nasty glare in
their eyes, you could readily believe all the down-
West yarns about locked doors and duels over
handkerchiefs.
Summary of the English epitaphs on Salmon
Wilson : “He gave big dinners, and married hie
children into the aristocracy.” Squatter Wilson
was a real man of the world. One morning,
years ago, just after he had taken up residence in
Grosvenor Square, the of Salisbury
and a somewhat “smaller” lady visited him to
canvass his subscription for a governesses’ home,
or some other fashionable Samuel received
them graciously, listened to their story, and wrote
out a cheque ; and, when they got into their car-
riage and opened the envelope, they found that
they had captured—two guineas!
counted on wheedling at least fifty out of ‘ one
of those rich Australians, who wishes to make his
way in society.” But Sam Wilson knew better.
In England, the nouveau riche, who throws hu
money about, is despised as a fool. It’s only when
they find you very rich and very “close” that they
begin to suspect you are one of themselves.
E. P. Field, the herculean Sydney bar-
rister-evangelist, is in Melb. just now, advising
sinners to insure their lives in this world and the
next. Times have gone hard with the enthusiastic
Mr. Field since he returned from a trip to Eng-
land a converted man. The legal friends 'who
gave him a “send off’’ upon his voyage a few
years ago were not disposed to rally round their
old companion, when he came back to _ Syd-
ney with a “ message to impart.” An obviously
pious barrister is avoided by the wigs, and
solicitors don’t brief him for fear that he might
perad venture tell the terewth about his client to a
jury. Religion, moreover, no visible
means of support for one who doesn t take up a
collection, and so the legal enthusiast lately fell
upon his knees and asked the Lord to remember
that His servant had a family. Next morning he
received a letter from a mutual life assurance society,
offering him a billet as lecturer, with full per-
mission to preach the Gospel whilst pushing the
co.’s interests. The Bulletin doesn’t accept the
aforesaid letter as convincing evidence that the
prayer of the righteous availeth much, but il
believes in the genuineness of Mr. Field’s fervor,
and hopes for his own sake, and the sake of the
co.. that all the people he insures will live long
and pay many premiums.

POLITICAL
POINTS
To the pure Freetrader all things imported
are pure.
The democratic Seddon Ministry (M.L.)
spent £, 11 9s. on firing “salutes” at the opening
of Parliament. “ Sir Richard ” Seddon —it surely
must come at last.
The fondest hopes of the N.S.W. Shoddy-
party have been blasted. So far from Shoddy
having the anticipated Assembly majority, the
Labor-party still occupies the centre of the see-saw.
The usual bi-weekly leper was found in
Queensland last Saturday. By-and-bye the
Queensland lepers will be numerous enough to
demand a vote, and Dunwioh will return a member
on the leprosy-ticket.
Trenwith has silenced his former critics,
Murray Smith and Frank Madden—Tory quintes-
sences—admit his ability and honesty of purpose,
while Patterson openly praises him in the House.
It’s a great risk to run.
Coincidental with the intrusion of lovely
woman into polities the Maorilanders limited Par-
liamentary talking-time. Also, the extension of
the S.A. franchise was soon followed by a pro-
posal for the limitation of speeches.
The latest move Protection-wards in Bana-
naland. Powers recently moved a resolution
limiting the competition of iron-masters as ten-
derers under the Sugar Guarantee Act thusly :
“That no grant of debentures under the Sugar
Guarantee Act should be made unless the machi-
nery for mill be manufactured in Queensland, or
onless the lowest Queensland tender is 10 per
cent, more than the lowest outside tender.”
Logical— at all events.
The other night, a staunch Protectionist
called upon the Freetraders and “ Moderate-
tariffer»” of the Vic. Assembly to vote for the
abolition of duties on rice, a poor man’s food,
which isn’t raised in the province. This was the
sort of reform which Premier Turner opposes on
behalf of the precious revenue, and which anti-Pro-
tectionists find no delight in, seeing that it would
hasten the coming of the new land-tax. So the
Ministry and the Opposition handed themselves
together in one lobby, whilst the supporters of the
Government took the other. The unholy alliance
carried the day, and rice will remain subject to a
B 0 per cent, tax, as before. As long as Govern-
ments look to the Customs Department for their
principal means of support, the poor man will
ft wa>s oe “left.”

Be the Nelson Govt.’s boasted surplus of
£lOl,OOO. £56,000 of this is due to instalments
received in payment for land sold under the
Special Sale of Lauds Act; and £68,000 more is
apparently gained by debiting legitimate revenue
expenditure to a new and mysterious trust account
called “Treasurer’s Intercolonial A ccount.” With
respect to the coming year, the Treasurer bas
already sacrificed £50,000 of railway revenue in
reductions of freight recently granted, and is about
to stop the deduction of 10 per cent, on civil
service salaries, which will mean an increase of
£30,000 in expenditure.
Melbourne Age : “ The issue at the
N.S.W. election was a good deal confused.” N.S.
Wales, as a matter of fact, was almost in the posi-
tion of the witness who was asked on his oath,
“Have you left off beating your wife —yes or
no, sir? ” The question put to the province was,
“Do you believe in Legislative Council reform,
direction taxation, and pure free trade, barring
taxes on narcotics and stimulants ?”
Wise’s political conduct
ought not to-be incomprehen-
sible—least of all to Premier
Reid. The wily Wise is only
pursuing against Reid the
same tactics with which that
optimistic grease-pot so suc-
cessfully downed Parkes. In
the lightning changes of Aus-
tralian politics the irrecon-
cileable always gets his
chance. ’Tis the misfortune
of the N.S.W. Piotectiunisb
Party that it does not possess
a sizeable irreconcileable.
The S.A. Government
hopes to prorogue in Nov., so
as to allow of the representa-
tives of the most distant dis-
tricts interviewing the elec-
tors before the general elec-
tions next April. The chief
polling-place of the Northern
Territory is 2000 miles from
Adelaide, and the constitu-
ency of Flinders stretches
from the W. A. border to that
of N.S.W, and Queensland.
The Ministry, too, desires to
tour the province, in order to
stem the wave of Conserva-
tism which some say is about
to sweep across the polling-
places.
Tas. Govt, is trying to
broaden the impecunious little
island’s Constitution. It pro-
poses to reduce the Leg.
Council elector’s property
qualification to ownership of
£2O annual value, or occu-
pancy of £6O leasehold value.
The Assembly elector’s quali-
fication is made ownership or
occupancy of property ; or re-
ceipt of wages of .£4O per
annum, or of ,£2O in the six
months before Nov. 1 in any
year. Then comes this revo-
lutionary provision : "If a
bill is twice rejected by the
Legislative Council, the Go-
vernor may dissolve the
same.” And this in Tas-
mania !
Having dropped into the gulf of Boodle-
wraith revenue deficit 400,000 of borrowed
money, .£403,003 from laud sacrificed at 10s. per
acre, about .£20,000 fresh excise duty on local
industries, and some .£200,000 saved by hard
retrenchment, Q Treasurer Nelson now announces
the return of prosperity owing to the magni-
ficent exertions of the gang in office.
“Liberalism” is English shoddy ;
Nationalism is all-wool.
The general average of popula-
tion centred in the chief cities of Aus-
tralasia in proportion to the popula-
tion of the respective provinces is
remarkably uniform. According to the
’9l census the proportion in Victoria,
N S. W., and S. A. is a third, or slightly
over ; in Tasmania—with two chief
centres, and Maoriland with four, it
is al-o about a third ; whilst in Queens-
land it is slightly over a fourth.
The barbarous law of imprison-
ment for debt has long been abolished
in Maoriland. The impecunious Maori-
lander isn’t gaoled now because he
can’t pay ; he is simply hauled before
the Court, and ordered to pay, and
then if he fails to do so he is gaoled
for “contempt.” That is to say, he
isn't “jugged” for not having the
money to pay with, but for not paying
whether he has it or not. A bill to
abolish this anomalous barbarism is
annually thrown out by the Maori-
land Parliament, its latest rejection
having taken place a fortnight ago.
Another weakening of those
“Silken Bonds.” The Maoriland
Govt., in offering prizes for designs for
a new issue of postage-stamps, stipu-
lated that the design for each denomi-
nation should be characteristic of
Maoriland —scenic or otherwise. The
tie that originally bound us to the
dear old mother country was a good,
substantial leg-iron. This was eventu-
ally superseded by the hawser of com-
mercial monopoly; which, becoming
frayed per friction of advancing demo-
cracy, gave place to the pim ly senti-
mental ‘Crimson Thread of Kinship”
connection—to be, in turn, followed
by the still frailer “Silken Bond.”
Which silken bond of airy gossamer
the first sturdy Republican breeze
will waft gently out of the continent,
and far out to sea.
Lands Barlow will be the Jonah of the
Q. Ministry—if there are any Democratic electors
left on t.,e roll six months from now. His jugglery
in throwing open Western lands for selection
has been so feeble that only the hard-faced
Cooriek and a few of its species have the front to
defend him. The only excuse to date is that his
virtues are nullified by bis subordinates ! Person-
ally unpopular for his shortness of temper, the
old man is not likely to face the music next
session; not as Lands Minister, anyhow. Come
to think of it, when was a Lands Minister given a
second show in Queensland ?
“In Protectionist Melbourne you can get
as good a hat for the same price as in London.
Hats are as cheap here as in London —cheaper,

a long spectre wandering about in outer darkness,
cursing the newspapers and shaking his fist at the
universe,
“ I am the one man in Australia who holds
the gold medal of the Cobden Club,” says Parkes,
“ and I would rather have that gold medal than
the grand cross of St. Michael and St. George.”
Some people pay their idols poor compliments.
The fact that only one of the nine men
who were recently killed in the South Broken
Hill mine belonged to the Amalgamated Miners’
Association illustrates how that once all-powerful
organisation has gone to pieces, as a result of the
last strike.
Q. National Asa is now issuing to Fat
Men strictly private circulars of instruction
“How to Purify the Rolls,” with specimen
“ forms of objection ” to unreliable persons
attached. And the Govt, of the province smiles on
this ghastly electoral iniquity !
An approximate count of votes at British
elections gives Conservatives and Liberal
Unionists 410, Liberals 175, Parnellites 12, and
Nationalists 69—with four seats yet to fill. So that
the Ministerial party starts with a majority of,
say, 150 over all others combined.
The hard-shell pietists of Maoriland Par-
liament want to abolish the totalisator, on the
ground that the State shouldn't make a revenue
out of sin. Evidently it never occurs to these
people that it would be rather rough on the good
people of the community to make them pay all
t*v lav*.
The Argus tenders familiar advice t»
Premier Reid :
It is sheer folly to start relief works in and about
Sydney, and thus m attract all the professional loaferdom
of Australia to that capital.
And still the anomaly of Professional Loafers
being attracted by Work remains unexplained.
Northcote (Vic.) Council proposes fixing
a minimum wage for its employes of 6s. per day.
The minimum-wage idea has been proved by many
eloquent Fat Men to bo utterly unworkable and
disastrous, and it has been demonstrated, by facts
which no one could get over, that the law of
supply and demand must be supreme as hereto-
fore, despite any such feeble attempts at inter-
ference. Nevertheless several corporations, in
Britain and Australia, have adopted the minimum
wage, and no disaster has happened, and there has
been no deadlock, or upheaval, or ruinous increase
of expenditure, or other phenomenon. Appar-
ently the law of supply and demand isn’t what it
is cracked up to be.
To Mrs. Mary Lee (a portrait of whom is
printed in this issue of The Bulletin), more than
to anyone else, is due the enfranchisement of the
women of South Australia; although various
attempts have been made, since the end of the
battle, to rob her of the credit of the achieve-
ment. She was the energetic and unwearying
secretary of the Women’s Suffrage League, now
dissolved, from the very beginning to the success-
ful issue of the fight, and, in the first instance,
she was almost the only woman who really toiled
hard to attain the object in view. When Cald-
well’s Bill to give the franchise to women of
property only was before Parliament in ’BB, she
vigorously opposed it, as she then saw that to be
truly valuable to the nation the vote must be given
to women on the same terms as to men. Cornelius
Proud, who lately wrote to the Review of Rb-
VIKWS claiming a ohiaf part in obtaining
the franchise, did not come into the field
until the struggle was virtually over, and the
same may bo said about Mrs. Nichoils, president
of the Women's Christian Temperance Union,
and of Mrs. Birks, whose public appearance was
years subsequent to that of Mary Lee. Mrs. Lee
is poor, however, and now that there seems to be
some distinction attaching to the title of pioneer
of the suffrage, her more influential sisters are
ungratefully attempting to push her into the
background. Roused by the injustice of Proud’s
article, which was written to placate the W.C.T.U.
and to gain its support in the next election cam-
paign. a movement has been started by those who
know the real genesis of the S.A. Adult Suffrage
movement to raise money for a testimonial to
Mrs. Lee. She both needs and deserves the
recognition, and money is coining well from the
poorer women to whom the privilege of voting is
likely to prove a real boon. “ Ladies,” however,
who affect to despise the right to enter the polling
booth, hold aloof, and so do some silk-clad sup-
porters of the movement who once were coad-
jutors of Mary Lee, and who, “coming after
i her are preferred before her.” The Westminster
Review for May does her justice, and its article
may be set against the meanness and untruth of
Proud’s dissertation before mentioned, from which
all allusion to Mrs. Lee was carefully and cruelly
i omitted.
The return of
Maoriland Govt,

9000 votes, leaves no
duulit how the “ An-
archistic ” Seddon
rule is regarded in
Auckland, anyway.
Lord Ripon, Seo-
of State for the Colo,
nies in the recently-
deceased British
Liberal Ministry,
throws cold-water on
the Ottawa Confer-
ence, which came to
the more or less lame
and impotent conclu-
sion that the Austra-
lias, Canada, India,
and the British de-
pendencies ought to
specially favor one
another and Britain
herself by joining in
an imperial Customs
union. Ripon says
flatly that the ar-
rangement can come
to nothing, as it
wouldn’t pay Britain
to destroy her A meri-
can and European
trade—which every-
body knew all along.
And incidentally he
remarks that the lion
will sit up if Aus-
tralia and Canada
think of making such
treaties without con-
sulting him which
seems to hint that

Ward’s reciprocal
agreement with Can-
ada is by no means

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating whatsize you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. _ All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical boot making is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

The India Office paid £4OOO for four weeks’
rent of the house in Park Lane, London, where the
son of the Ameer of Afghanistan and suite were
put up. The house is richly furnished and stocked
with brittle valuables, so the owner stood out for
a stiff price. Ever since the Shah of Persia played
sheol in a palace, slaughtering sheep on the draw-
ing room carpets, &0,, British householders have a
prejudice against eastern potenates.
Before a presentation by a body of Yic.
military officers some junior clerks in the employ
of the gentleman commanding extracted the silver
pot from the case, and replaced it by a dilapidated
jam-tin, carefully wrapped in layer upon layer of
whitest tissue-paper. When all things were ready,
and the excitement had been worked up as fold
after fold of paper was removed, the whole cere-
mony went bung. Those serious soldier-men
didn’t even laugh, but tried to keep the thing very
dark indeed.
About the most pathetic ad. on record
appeared in London Times, of June 8 :
•WOULD the GENTLEMAN SPEAK yet again, who
said in London, 1864, that he loved me, and
then that he was thrown over? All remembered.
Parents are dead.—E.D.O.
Then the earth and I, we both were young,
And both were passing fair,
And the sun of our bright young love-time shone
like gold in my yellow hair;
But, alas ! I was then just twenty-two,
And now I am fifty-three,
And the love that I loved in ’64 will never come
back to me.

“ Such,” writes a Bulletin correspondent, “ are
among the signs and cries of Sydney’s poverty.
Some cities are not poor enough for a certain class
of poor people to live in. Sydney isn’t yet quite
ready for the costermonger tribe but it is
coming. Legend over high - class ‘ tater-and-
fritter ’ stand in Belmore market : ‘ Knocked ’em
in the old Kent road.’ They’ll knock ’em in the
Parramatta or South Head road yet.”
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
The astuteness of the Melb. police has
again been demonstrated. A local servant-girl
saddled with an illicit baby (a very little one) care-
fully wrapped it up in brown-paper, and took
most extraordinary pains to hide the body at a
distance from her home. But the detectives had
their hands upon her within a few hours of the
discovery of the body. The aforesaid brown-
paper had the name and address of the girl’s
mistress boldly printed upon it.

RESTORED TO HEALTH
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier known.”

It was at a cricket-match, and a Maori said
“Damn !” “If you swear,” said a parson, re-
provingly, as he pointed earthwards with his
umbrella, “you’ll go down there.” The Maori’s
eyes followed the direction indicated by the
cleric’s gamp; then he came and looked closer.
‘ ‘Down there,” he exclaimed, “down?” The
shepherd nodded. “Ugh!” grunted the Maori,
“you prurry fool, I think ! Where t’ ferra ever
seen uttha ferra go up ?” As the good clergyman
stole away, with a sigh, the Maori winked
solemnly at the company, and remarked to a col-
lege chum: “Really, the theological ignorance
displayed by some of these Chadbands is astonish-
ing and extremely painful to contemplate.”
Snell: The new woman, the new morality—
they are very musty. I picked up a blue-mouldy,
crumbling ruin of a book the other day, a sixty-
year-old translation of a German story, “Faustina,”
by Countess Hahn-Hahn. How venerable the
original is I cannot say. Faustina is “the woman
who did ” long before Grant Allen was born, with
the difference that she married in the first place,
and, after discovering that her husband was just
plain hog, conceived a violent brain affection for a
pale, spiritual individual who talked prose-poems.
Hubby caught them hugging—a purely spiritual
hug—and shot the pale man. Whereupon
Faustina gathered up the remains and fled. She
cures her affinity, but refuses to marry him be-
cause she will not abandon her freedom, so they
chum in and knock around together. Faustina
talks all the philosophy of the New Woman, with
the difference that she talks it much better on the
whole. She asserts her freedom by changing again
(the third man being paler than the one betore)
and finishes in a nunnery, a female Solomon,
resolved that all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
After all, mother Eve was the original New
Woman.

Sydney is the knife, the country is the
bullock. Sydney is the milker, the province is
the cow.
Candidates actively canvassed among Syd-
ney civil-servants, in departmental hours, during
the election.
“The bill that the Council passes, the
Council believes will further the Council’s personal
interests.”—Jack Robertson.
“ The Protectionist leaders,” says Sydney
D.T., “have gone down like chaff before the
wind.” Yes, it was only wind.
Minister Carruthers, at St. George, polled
most votes at N.S.W. election —1380, Onan, at
Newtown-St. Peters, polled fewest—2.
Two interesting questions : Will Premier
Reid accept a title? What is the policy of his
Ministry re the Colo Valley grab question ?
J. D. Fitzgerald made a remarkable fight
against Minister Sydney Smith at Bathurst,
scoring 746 votes after only six days’ canvass.
B. Short, the haloed insurance-drummer,
ignominiously failed to displace Rose in Argyle.
B. Short had far too much to say—couldn’t B.
short enough.
The Reid party claim the absent M'Millan
as a supporter of theirs. Which is as amusing as
their claim to the support of factor Morton, of the
colossal Hay estates.
Mayor Lees, of Sydney, was beaten for
the Nepean at the general election. Political
fleas (like Mr. Lees) should never put themselves
under the microscope.
A N.S. Wales M.L.C., in his convivial
moments, says that “Reid wants 26,000 land'
owners and a few whisky-drinkers to provide aP
the revenue of the province.”
Crick, Meagher, and M‘Elhone are now
members of N.S.W. Assembly. To make things
really lively, A. G. Taylor and John Norton
should have been added to the list.
Again is the pink-and-white young orator
Holman rejected. Grenfell wouldn’t have him.
It will not hurt Mr. Holman to stay outside the
House for a few “circling years” and learn how
to “boil it down.”
John M‘Elhone is back in N.S.W. Assem-
bly with a new barb welded on his tongue. In
preferring J. M’Elhone to grocer-warrior Chap-
man the electors, as it were, preferred a Tas-
manian devil to a pet pink-eyed mouse.
Dibbs thinks that Reid’s success is “ due
to a wave of insanity similar to that which swept
through France at the time of the Revolution.”
Subject for great historical picture : Robespierre
Reid guillotining Bourbon Dibbs 1
Millionaire Burdekin’s absence from active
politics is noted. Burdekin naturally does not
agree with the Reid Freetrade land-and-income-tax
proposals, but he is content to remain dormant
rather than actively oppose “ the party.”
One N.S.W. politician’s defeat should be a
solemn warning to future Ministers not to appoint
quite all of their constituents to billets in Sydney.
When a man moves too many of his supporters out
of the electorate in this fashion, the natural result
is that they aren’t in the electorate just when he
most wants them.
Premier Reid considered Mrs. Parkes’
death the final and politically-saving act of an
outraged Providence. Had the veteran accepted
it as such, he could have made it a decent and
sufficient excuse for retirement from the ill-
advised King contest, and also from active
politics. No doubt Parliament would grant him
a substantial pension—though Heaven only knows
w hy.
Frank Smith, the just-released boom-
banker, formerly M.P., who thought to rehabili-
tate himself by being elected for Balmain, only
polled 36 votes as against 10£5 recorded for the
successful man. It is a pity that he subjected
himself to this humiliation, for his original-trouble
was the outcome of folly rather than of anything
else; and it is pretty clear that Smith believes
himself to have been entirely innocent. ; 1
In one large Sydney mercantile house it is
customary to have a full holiday on polling-day.
It is likewise customary for the manager to address
a little homily to employes. Last week thohomily
was subtle : “The firm has granted a holiday on
polling-day. I hope you will nob abuse your
employers’kindness. Er —the, er—firm will suffer
greatly if Mr. Reid’s policy comes in force.”
None of those employes worked openly for any
man, no matter how they balloted.
As predicted, Reid had little difficulty in
beating Parkes, although it is averred that in the
canvass by Parkes’ alleged friends something like
Jill was spent for every vote polled by him.
However that may be, it is certain that Reid’s
enemies spent money like water. But Parkes,
with the almost undivided publican interest
against him to start with, could never reasonably
have expected to beat Reid on the latter’s own
dunghill.
“ What useful purpose,” it is asked by his
friends, “ would have been served by ousting
Premier Reid from King division ?” Well, it
would have been just this way. Old-Man Parkes
would have stood up after the poll-declaration and
said in his piping treble : “ Gentle-men ! Mr.
George Reid boasted days ago that if beaten in
the division which I have now the honor to repre-
sent he could get 20 other seats. But, gentlemen,
with politics, as with trousers, it is only the
original seat which carries with it any dignity.
No truly dignified man ever wore patched trousers,
and Mr. George Reid, should he succeed in secur-
ing the ostensible rehabilitation of his political
trousers, will be known henceforth as the Politi-
cian with the Patched Pants.” It wouldn’t, of
course, have mattered a rap that Old-Man Parkes
himself once had his trousers patched—at Tenter-
field.
The early establishment in Sydney of a
national Protectionist morning paper should now
be a certainty. The Bulletin firmly believes the
Protectionists to be in a majority among the
electors, and it is inconceivable that the majority
means any longer to take its gruel lying down.
In putting up the large amount necessary to
equip a new morning paper the promoters will
have to consider, not merely the direct effect of
such a journal, but also the effect of its establish-
ment on the policy of the two existing dailies.
With the advent of a first-class morning Protec-
tionist organ, the present Sydney dailies would
negotiate a curve so sharp that the man in the
guard’s van would be able to light his pipe at the
loco, furnace.
Just as the S.M. Herald barracked for
Judge Windeyer at the commencement of the
Dean case, little suspecting what would be the final
outcome, so it, in the N.S.W. political scrimmage,
favored Parkes until Reid got his teeth firmly
fixed in the old man’s political larynx. And then
it came round beautifully. N.S.W. Tories were
struck first dumb, then blasphemous, by the
Herald’s attacks on the sacred rights of the
Upper House and its support of Reid’s revolu-
tionary scheme of taxing Property. But that’s
all over now. The aged dodderers who wept tears
of grief when the Fat prodigal wallowed amongst
Democratic husks, will soon weep tears of joy as
they kill the calf for the prodigal’s return. For
how did Ingrate Reid repay the Herald’s
bounty ? He —the shuddering pen here refuses its
office— he addressed the crowd after the poll from
the office-window of the Herald’s loathsome con-
temporary, the Daily Telegraph. And, then,
what did the Herald do? It simply left Reid’s
speech out of the paper ! But revenge will not
halt here. Premier Reid may consider his poli-
tical throat HBRALD-cut at the very first decent
opportunity.
Melbourne Herald is the oldest local
paper. Established in 1839, it is old enough to
know better.
In Catholic Belgium 100,000 delegates,
assembled in conference at Brussels, have de-
manded that national education be taken out of
the hands of the priests. In the light of advanc-
ing science, the upas of superstition withers to its
death.
The Brisbane branch of Hardy Bros., the
high class Sydney jewellers, has now boon estab-
lished nine mouths undhr the of Mr.
W. Hardy. The firm’s simple and unostentatious
show case marks the entrance to a handsome
interior at 81 Queen-street. The general character
of the Brisbane stock sustains the firm’s excellent
reputation, and the latest fashions come direct from
London and not via Sydney. A staff of skilled
workmen, who have been specially trained in the
Sydney establishment, have been permanently
transferred to Brisbane. The firm is resolved to
treat Brisbane to the newest designs, especially as
returns up to date have more than justified the
venture. The firm’s name is already associated
with various presentations of exceptional promin-
ence. i '*>

SPORTING NOTIONS .
Deputations of “ hookies ” are interviewing such
members of the V.R.C. as may be indebted to the frater-
nity for gambling or business favors. The deputation
always puts its case frankly. Ikey Mo’s interests clash
with the tote, therefore the gent, must be good enough
to oppose the machine at the olub’s forthcoming meeting.
However, if the club authorities take care to preserve the
secrecy of their ballot, Ikey Mo. will not get the satis-
faction of revenge upon any members who break the
promise exacted from them.
* • * *
One of the best arguments for the totalisator is
the fact that all serious opposition to the machine in
S.A. has completely died out. Even the bookies have
become silenced, recognising that it is useless to kick
against the pricks.
* * * «
M'Culloch, M.L.0., Vie., lately a chief op-
ponent, is converted—to the totalisator.
• • • •
“The Infernal Machine—the Totalisator.”—
S. G. Cook.
• • • *
The latest anti-totalisator argument. At a
tote-discussion meeting at Menzies’ hotel, a gentleman
present, evidently from England, gave it as his opinion
that “as they could do without the machine in Britain,
why shouldn’t we here?” Now, what ought to be done
to that man ? As they can do without him in Britain, he
surely might also be abolished in Horsetralia.
* * » •
After all, the settlement of the totalisator ques-
tion rests with the public at large. Eventually the book-
maker must give way to his bettors.
• * * •
Punters are, at time of writing, offered the
ridiculous odds of 15 to 1 the Caulfield National double,
Emmalea and Daimio. Also, Daimio’s price, straightout,
over four miles of stiff country with 13st. 31b. up, in a
field (now) of 42, is 3to 1. Where is the tote?
* ♦ * *
At time of writing, Brewer still has three horses
in Caulfield National Hurdle—Emmalea, Bill and Bose-
stem. “This is the card you want, this is the card I
want. This one is no good to you, this one is my Sunday
dinner. Now who’ll pick the lady queen for a quid 7 ”
* * ♦ *
Gratiano, once Shylock, who ran second to
Trojan in the Flemington National Steeple of ’93, won
the Hurdle at Caulfield a fortnight back, and as he has
more pace than the ordinary jumper, he should nearly
win the Caulfield National Hurdle.
• • • *
A not unlikely horse for one of the Caulfield
National events is Dart. Although beaten by Daimio, at
Flemington, his chance was not improved by the condi-
tion of his rider, Underwood, who, having previously had
a horse killed under him, was in far too nervous a state
to ride.
• • • *
Dart, who ran second at Flemington, has been
raised 121 b, at Caulfield. He is now owned by Miller
Bros., hut may be too light to go four miles. The stable
horse may be Romsdal. who was running third at Flem-
ington for 24 miles, and who seems built to stay.
• • « •
Bischoff has a fair chance for the Hurdle-race at
Caulfield on Saturday, but the Ballarat horse will have to
get home before he has finished pulling if he is to win.
Baltoro, although not yet “seasoned” for a four-mils
race, would he worth backing for the Steeple if the stable
put its money down with as much freedom as at Fleming-
ton. There are several “ ifs ” in the case of both the
animals aforesaid, whereas the only argument against the
Emmalea and Daimio double is the weight they have to
carry. On paper neither of them ought to get beaten by
many yards, barring always the accidents which jumpers
risk.
• • * •
The crowd who gather round a fallen Jockey
during a steeplechase are not always entirely dis-
interested. The late Tom Corrigan once lost a valuable
scarf-pin while unconscious from a spill, it having been
removed by a thoughtful onlooker. And the other day,
while a Vic. jockey was lying on the ground, apparently

Fate gave the Pirates another chance against
Randwick on Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday. A
bitter southerly, accompanied by showers, swept, over the
field, drenching the players and chilling everyone to the
marrow. This wind during the first half greatly assisted
the Pirates in a fast and diversified game. The Pirates
had the best of it that hall and lent emphasis to their
advantage by scoring 4 points to Randwick s 0. The
second half saw a sodden, heavy ball, slippery turf, and a
.lying wind. Randwick supporters had hoped and prayed
for this second half; and what might have been had the
hall been light and dry, and the strong wind lived ! But
luck was against Randwick; luck and the Pirates won

Mr, Aubrey Davis, dentist, of 492 George-
■treet (Royal Arcade, Sydney), has spared no ex-
pense in fitting up his luxurious consultmg-rooins
with the latest dental appliances. The operating-
chair is a work of art, in which the patient can be
raised, lowered, or placed in any required position
'by hydraulic power. The dental engine, a
machine tor scraping and cleaning decayed teeth,
is also worked by hydraulic power and so is the
automatic mallet, for fixing the gold-filling in de-
cayed teeth. Extraction is performed painlessly,
without ether or chloroform, by spraying the gum
with a new local anaesthetic chloride of ethy .
, Artificial teeth of the best quality are fitted at
prices not much more than half the rates com-
monly charged a few years ago. The rooms are
comfortable and elegant, and all the operations
are done painlessly in the shortest possible time
and with minimum inconvenience to the patient.
Since Nathan Herman, one of the oldest
wholesale men of the city, opened his Misfit Parlor
in Wynyard-street, and immediately launched a
great retail business on his carefully-built whole-
sale trade, that thoroughfare has been turnedinto
an avenue of busy life. There is so much business
going on that the busy proprietor is a veritable
will-o’-the-wisp, and the very time you think you
have hold of his ear is just the very time that you
have not. It is quite reasonable to assume, in
fact it is quite certain, that Mr. Herman would
not have such a grasp of the right end of the stick
unless he had a very big claim to it. Mr. Herman
assures everybody that the new departure in his
line of business was a big success. His premises
are worth a visit from anybody, for the stock is as
complete as one could make it, the manner of com
ducting his business perfect, and the obtaining of
extra value for any outlay a moral certainty.
Messrs. Howe and Spain, the well-known city
architects, are fitting up the premises in an
elaborate manner, practically having carte olancne
to ensure comfort for the patrons of Mr. Herman,
and expedition in business. In the furniture de-
partment everything is obtainable, from a salt-
spoon to the most elaborate drawing-room fittings.
And then, the Brussels carpets ! Mr. Herman
guarantees to make and lay Brussels carpets at
2s. a yard. The Manchester goods, the dress mate-
rials, eight-day clocks at 12s, fid. (really worth
£2). and all sorts of household and bodily require-
ments at equally cheap rates must claim attention
In mantles, Mr. Herman has a grand assortment,
and the many ladies who patronise the establish-
ment have nothing but praise to bestow. Mr.
Herman is in direct communication with
leading Parisian and other European houses of
fashion. In the Misfit Parlor he has as complete
an assortment of clothing—men’s, youths , anc *
boys’—as there is in the Southern Hemisphere.
He showed a dress suit, made to order, for 305.,
for which, in the ordinary course of business, eight
or ten guineas would be given without demur.
He sells Masonic aprons for 55., the ordinary
price of which is 225. fid. He can supply those
wanting the time with watches and chains for 6s.
fid. and 7s. fid., and his special brands of cigars
and tobacco are astoundingly cheap. Mr. Herman
is known as “the Safe Man.’’ He has received
this designation owing to his having earned a big
reputation as the seller of iron safes, his record
being 3000 in 20 years ; but he is a safe man in
more ways than one. When he gives a bargain
the purchaser may feel quite safe from anxiety as
to the genuineness of the article. Mr. Herman s
reputation has never been questioned on that
score, and, as a country client has informed him
by letter, he has, since he started, knocked every-
thing into a cocked hat for quality and cheap-
ness.* .

Dr. Talmage Again.
In one of Dr. Talmage’s sermons, he says : “If
10 men were to come to you when ill with some
appalling malady, and if they had the same ill-
ness and took a certain medicine and it cured
them, you would probably take it. Now, suppose
10 other men were to come and say, ‘We don’t
believe that there is anything in that medicine.’
‘Well,’ I say, ‘have you tried it?’ ‘No, no.*
‘Then avaunt. Let me take the testimony of the
millions of souls that have been converted and
comforted in trial, and solaced in the same hour,
in preference to the advice of unbelievers, who
have no actual experience. We will take the tes-
timony of those who have; for they are witnesses.”
Thousands of the press, the profession, and the
masses in all nations are witnesses to the value
and efficacy of Warner’s Safe Cure in the cure of
liver and kidney diseases, and if any symptoms
such as furred tongue, flatulency and indigestion,
pain in the shoulder-blades and in the back,
yellowness or burning of the skin, nausea, sleep-
lessness, loss of flesh, puffy eyelids, shortness of
breath, and dropsical swelling of ankles or body
assail you, be wise, and be guided by the experi-
ence of a cloud of witnesses.*
The usual hideously-inquisitive Sunday
crowd flocked aboard a ship commanded by a
Yankee and began worrying all hands with
questions. “What line did you follow before
you took to the sea?” enquired a magnificently-
barbered St. Kilda man of the old fellow with the
goatee. “I was a hosaphiosipher,” replied the
smileless skipper, revolving his quid. “ And what
are the duties of a hosaphiosipher?” “Measur-
ing toads for tooth-picks and shaving eels!”
roared the irate man from America—“ allow me
to show you to the gangway, sir.”
The other day a man who had been on a
health-trip to Europe, returned to Westralia after
five years’ absence, and was asked by the Customs
officer at Albany to show his luggage. The officer
was particularly careless, and seemed in a hurry,
and the traveller was thereby annoyed. “Look
here, young man—l suppose your name’s Shenton
—what’s the meaning .” “My name is not
Shenton, sir, it’s .” “Oh, Marmion, then.”
‘No, sir, not Marmion either, but .” “Now
I see,” said the traveller, “ you’re a Forrest and
th it’s why you’re putting on such style. I’m
not in a hurry. I’ll leave my luggage here
for a month to be examined at leisure in the
-proper way. I was once in the Government
myself and I know you won’t behurried.” “ Well,
sir,” said the officer, “ I’ll put you through now if
you wish.” “Put me through now\” said the
traveller, grasping the affrighted official by the
neck. “ What’s your game? This is insubordina-
tion of the very worst sort. Now look here,
young Forrest” “My name, sir, is not
Forrest —it is Maloney.” “ Maloney, Maloney?
H’m. I don’t remember anyone of influence here
named Maloney! How did you get your billet,
anyway ? ” “ I was in the Victorian Customs and
applied for this billet a year ago.” “ And you’re
not related to Shenton, or Marmion, or Forrest ?”
“ No, sir.’ The traveller turned ashy white, went
to the the ship, looked at the blue sea an 1
gasped. Then he grabbed the official by the nck
onoe more and gazed into his eyes for ten minutes.
“ You swear you’re not a Shenton or ” “My
name, sir, is Maloney.” “That’s enough for
me,” said the traveller, tieing a heavy tin box |to
his neck. Then h) dived into the deep.
Dug-dentistry is a recent American ainsti-
tution.
Naturalist H. J. M‘Cooey (N.S. W.) lately
found and forwarded to the Australian Museum a
two-tailed lizard ( Lygosoma decresciense). Malfor-
mations among the reptilia of Australia are far
less common than among the mammalia and
birds. There is m Sydney museum a two-headed
tiger snake.
Dudley le Souef, of Melb. Zoo., does not
believe in the stories of snakes committing suicide.
His explanation is that, like many other animals,
snakes bite at a part where they have received a
wound ; and, if they die thereafter, the bushman
puts it down to suicide. There he is wrong, for it
is the wound and not the poison that kills. On
many occasions he has made snakes bite each
other, but in no case has death ensued. [This well-
known fact should have long ago given the clue to
the serum-antidote discovery.—Ed. B.] Even when
Le Souef had one large tiger-snake bitten by three
others, the bitten reptile lived for more than a
year. In Melb. University there are living now
a black snake into which was injected one-third of
a grain of tiger-snake venom, and a tiger-snake
which got no harm from one-third of a grain oi
black snake venom. Sydney University physio-
logical laboratory can parallel these cases.
Another curious point is that the larger species of
lizard, such as Gould’s monitor, the lace lizard,
the great cyclod us, and the bearded lizard, do
not seem to be harmed by snake-venom, whereas
the smaller lizards are a big item in the food of
many snakes, the copper-head especially.
The Melbourne Government House balls
which have been announced have proved an
incentive to the artistes de toilettes. Much toil
and thought must have been exercised in some
of the productions wherewith to adorn beauty,
which have lately been seen. One evidence of
rare artistic skill in this way was a faultlessly-
fitting evening gown of lovely rich brocaded silk,
draped in thoroughly Parisian taste, in Messrs.
Hicks, Atkinson and Sons’ establishment. This
was not an imported gown, but the work of their
Court dressmaker, who is recently from Paris,
and who has evidently received a good share of
the gift which made Worth famous in the world
of women.*

STATUTORY DECLARATION,
I THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to mv business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas 1, as
a last hope obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfalink Vitality Pills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alfaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.
rH< SubsCTtoed and declared at Sydney this 23rd day of November, 1891, before me.—S.T.Whiddon,

Nervousness Cured.

mony carries special weight, writes thus :To Herr Rassmussen.—Dear Sir,-I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Vours, R. A. LUCKHAM. .

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Here Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both_ in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

A Melb. girl, arrested the other day for
alleged infanticide, confessed that the child was
born prematurely, whilst a fellow-servant, sleeping
in the room in another bed, was ignorant of the
event. An hour after the birth she arose and
wrapped the body in brown paper and stowed it
away in her box for a couple of days before dis-
pjsing of it. In the morning she got up as usual
and went about her work.
ENO’S “FRUIT SALT” has been found an
excellent corrective to the digestive organs, and in
the colonies, in India, and in South America, has
a largely increasing sale. It is better by far than
“nips;’’ and among the Good Templars—a
numerous community all over the world —it is
recognised not only as a refreshing, but also as
a stimulating drink. —European Mail. Sold by
all chemists and stores.*
The Bodalla Cheese and Bacon Co., the
most extensive concern of the kind in Australasia,
turns out weekly, in the season, eight tons and
more of cheese. This cheese is unrivalled, and
every genuine sample bears the co.’s registered
brand, a facsimile of which appears always in
their standing advertisement in this paper.
Buyers are thus enabled to protect themselves
against unscrupulous tradesmen, who are ever
ready to trade off ordinary cheese as Bodalla.
The pigs for the Bodalla bacon and hams are
reared upon the oo.’s estate, and slaughtered at
Glebe Island under the supervision of the Govt,
meat inspector. Hence the purity of carcases for
curing is ensured. The curing is done at the works
of the Fresh Food and Ice Co. The Bodalla hams
are considered by the highest judges to equal the
heat English ; over 5000 hams were sold last
Christmas, and notone buyer afterwards raised a
complaint. The wholesale agent, Mr. John
Shearwin, has occupied his post for close on 40
years. He came from England with Mr. Mort

The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.

Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant

the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

DISINFECTION WITH "SANITAS.”
A searching recntly made by Dr. A. B. Griffiths, F.R.S.E., F. 0.5., the well-
" lias established tlie fact that very minute proportions of “Sanitas”
“ ,S; T l ” ltas V** and Sanitas ” Emulsion suffice to quickly destroy the microbes of
Lholera, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Scarlet Fever, Pneumonia, Measles, Influenza,
Pueipn-al Fever, Glanders, Yellow Fever, &c.
It been shown that the vapour of “Sanitas” Oil, as generated from the
Sanitas Disinfecting Fumigator, has a most destructive action on the germs of
disease, ami that, consequently, its inbalatio i must be most beneficial in the treatment
°* Dipnthena, 1 hthisis, and all Diseases of the Lungs and Throat.
W hen used for fumigating sick rooms, Dr. Griffiths’ experiments show that a short time
serves to destroy all the germs that are present in the air.
His experiments also demonstrate that when “Sanitas” Fluid is sprayed about dwelling
rooms, the microbes of disease are entirely and quickly destroyed, and 'that small
quantities of “Sanitas ‘ Emulsion equally well destroy the same' germs when present
in water. Uf great importance is the further fact which is brought out by Dr; Griffiths’
investigations namely, (hat not only do “Sanitas” Disinfectants kill all disease germs,
but they exhibit this great advantage over ot’mr preparations—namely, that they also
destroy the poisonous substances which are pro laced by disease germs and to which
they largely owe their fearful character.
Dr. Griffiths concludes his Report with these word ;
< ( • r Fher e is no doubt that ‘ Sanitas ’ Oil ami Sanitas’ Fluid are most powerful dis-
<l | n * ect{ ¥ lts 5 consequently, they should not only be used for disinfecting rooms, hospitals,
t , bai racks, prisons, &, but also employed in the treatment of infectious diseases, such
~ a ” c diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, glanders, typhoid fever, tuberculosis,

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE Keg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge, ” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. I,’’ have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TIE IB IE IE CASTLES ” and ££ CAPSTALT.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wilis’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scene : A skittle-alley attached to a mining-
field hotel.
Guttering candles, shielded after the manner of
footlights ; with the foliage of the buffer of trans-
planted old-nian ferns making fantastic play of
light and shade on the forms and faces of
bystanders and players.
A big, strong man stands at the cleet, ball in
hand, making bets on his next throw with the
onlookers, while other players are sticking up the
pins.
Another man enters the alley with an open tele-
gram in his hand, and the expression of grief on
his white face. He speaks to the player—his
brother—still standing ball in hand.
“ Jack, father is dead ! Here is the wire.”
A respectful silence in the alley follows the
remark; and the players, without straightening
their backs, pause in their work of stickibg up the
; ns
The brother answers laconically, “Well, Bill,
I don’t suppose the poor old could live for
ever.” Then, to the spectators: “Another half-
sovereign I twice ’em.”

I remember reading in a school-book that
the Stoic doctrine was that a man should hold
himself unaffected either by pleasure or by pain.
Was this Stoicism ?
Dixon, my friend the schoolmaster, is a good
classical scholar. I told him the story. Said he :
“ There is nothing of the Stoic in the character
of Australians. They fail even to understand the
spirit of Stoicism. You, like most of them, are
only brutally cynical.”

The late Duke of Hamilton’s eleven-year-

The English police enquiries in the Wilde

-Rev. Haskett Smith has picked up some

spreac i themselves upon the margin of the Dead
g ea w h en h e and two soulful friends were anxious
to have the neighbourhood all to themselves. The
400 intruc |ers came under charge of an agent who
was runn i n g them at “ ruinously low prices,” and
therefore, remarks the lecturer, “they were, of
CO urse, of the most despicable class — tenth-rate tour-

paying twenty visits to Jerusalem, and going to
Nazareth to do his shopping, if he can’t shake off
his Pharisaic belief in the “despicableness ” at
cheap-trippers? Didn’t the broad-phylacteried
Smith’s alleged Master come specially to save
cheap-trippers ? And how will the very much
post-apostolic Haskett’s gorge rise when he finds
himself viewing the scenery of Heaven in company
with 400,000,000,000,000 (or thereabouts) intruders
—brought along at “ ruinously-low prices ” by an
agent who expressed a particular preference for
“tenth-rate tourists,” and sniffed audibly at
the gilt-edged sentimentalists of 1865 years ago !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WILL never forget that day, both for its terrific
heat and an extraordinary incident which marked
it. I had ridden into Normanton and tied my
horse up at Bailey’s, A group of men were
standing on the verandah, one of whom occasion-
ally raised his voice above the others. “ I’m Bill
the pug ! ” he was shouting, “ and I can lick any
man between Burketown and the Towers.”
Bill “ the pug,” however, was ignored, the real
object of attention being his dog. It was an old
bull-terrier, literally covered with scars from head
to tail.
“ How did the dog come by them scars ? ” asked
a bystander.
Bill stared at him stupidly with his bloodshot
eyes. He was very drunk. “ I’ll show yer,” he
said. ' ...
Drawing a piece of greenhide from his swag, he
brought it down with dreadful force upon the
dog’s back. “ Smile yer !” he yelled “ smile,
or I’ll cut the skin off yer! ” But the dog only
looked at him sulkily. Down came the lash again,
and this time with more effect, for it brought the
blood. The dog sat back on his haunches and,
skinning his teeth, smiled a grim, awful smile.
Bill the pug. roared with laughter, and, picking up
his bundle, walked away. The dog hopped after
him on three legs.
I remained in town till sunset and then returned
to our camp on the Norman River. The men
were cutting firewood for the meat-works. We
paid them by the cord, and it was my duty to
check the measurements. I was surprised to see
Bill and his dog having tucker with the men.
Bill evidently wanted work.
I retired early that night and slept in a restless
way till daylight, when I was aroused by an un-
earthly scream.
“Damn yer,” said Bill’s voice, “what yer
smiling at ? What yer larfing at ? ” he was saying.
There was Bill—on the other side of a big log.
A huge black snake had encircled his chest and
neck, and was looking him in the face. I could
see it had already bitten him, and I was at a loss
what to do.
With a terrified expression Bill was looking at
the dog, which, from a few feet off, was watching
the proceedings with evident enjoyment and
smiling voluntarily—smiling, it seemed to me, as
it could never have smiled before.
The snake had struck Bill again before I could
kill it. He was now in a dead faint, but when we
brandied him up he recovered consciousness.
“ Yer seen Hm come, and yer didn’t bark. What
yer larfing at now?” were his last articulated
words.
We buried Bill at Normanton, but the dog had
disappeared and we never saw it afterwards.

Editor Bulletin, Larry Petrie, the
Unionist agitator, Anarchist, the man who
did not blow up the s.s. Aramao in the seamen’s
strike of ’93—is in San Francisco earning a pre-
carious livelihood by peddling. Petrie was the
man who horrified the Conservative members of
the A.S.U. by baptizing the A.S.IT. and G.L.U.
“Australian Workers’ Union.” At the annual
Conference of the A.S.U. and G.L.U, in ’93 those
bodies refused to ratify Petrie’s action, although
h 0 was supported by all the progressive delegates.
However, the Toomeys, MTntyres, Poyntons,
and Cooks won the day, and Larry was “left.”
We know now that Petrie was only a year or so
ahead of his time. I think lam correct in affirm-
ing that Petrie is the only Australian Anarchist
who was ever charged with attempting to do any-
thing. For the present he agitates door-bells,
and purposes attempting to walk to New Aus-
tralia if he cannot raise the money to pay his way.

Our First Harvest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If there is anything worse than burr-
cutting or breaking stones, it’s putting corn in
with a hoe.
We were just finished. The girls were sowing
the last of the grain when Fred Dwyer appeared
on the scene. Dad stopped and talked with him
while we (Dan, Dave and myself) sat on our hoe-
handles, like kangaroos on their tails, and killed
flies. Terrible were the flies, particularly when
you had sore legs or the blight.
Dwyer was a big man with long, brown arms
and red, bushy whiskers.
“You must find it slow work with a hoe?’’ he
said.
“ Well-yes—pretty,” replied Dad (just as if he
wasn’t quite sure).
After a while Dwyer walked over the “cultiva-
tion,” and looked at it hard, then scraped a hole
with the heel of his boot, spat, and said he didn’t
think the corn would ever come up. Dan slid off
his perch at this, and Dave let the flies eat his leg
nearly off without seeming to feel it; but Dad
argued it out.
“ Orright, orright,” said Dwyer; “I hope it do.”
Then Dad went on to speak of places he knew
of where they preferred hoes to a plough for
putting corn in with ; but Dwyer only laughed
and shook his head.
“D n him ! ” Dad muttered, when he had
gone ; “ what rot! won't come up ! ”
Dan, who was still thinking hard, at last
straightened himself up and said he didn’t think
it was any use either. Then Dad lost his temper.
“No use?” he yelled, “ you whelp, what do you
know about it ? ”
Dan answered quietly : “On’y this, that it’s
nothing but tomfoolery, this hoe business.”
“How would you do it then?’’ Dad roared,
and Dan hung his head and tried to button his
buttonless shirt wrist-band, while he thought.
“ With a plough,’’ he answered.
Something in Dad’s throat prevented him say-
ing what he wished, so he rushed at Dan with the
hoe, but—was too slow.
Dan slept outside that night.
* # *
No sooner was the grain sown than it rained.
How it rained ! for weeks ! And in the midst of
it all the corn came up—every grain—and proved
Dwyer a bad prophet. Dad was in high spirits
and promised each of us something—new boots all
round.
The corn continued to grow—so did our hopes,
but a lot faster. Pulling the suckers and “heeling
it up ” with hoes was but child’s play—we liked
it. Our thoughts were all on the boots; ’twas a
long time since wo had pulled on a pair. Every
night, in bed, we decided twenty times over
whether they would he lace-ups or bluchers, and
Dave had a bottle of “ Goanna ” oil ready to keep
his soft with.
Dad now talked of going-up country, as mother
put it, “to keep the wolf from the door,” while
the four acres of corn ripened. He went, and
returned on the day Tom and Bill were born—
twins. Mavba his absence did keen the wolf from
the door, bub ib didn’b keep the dingoes from the
fowl-house !
* * *
Once the corn ripened it didn’t take long
to pul! ib, but Dad had to put on his considering-
cap when we came to the question of getting ib in.
To hump ib in bags seemed inevitable till Dwyer
asked Dad to give him a hand to pub up a milking-
yard. Then Dad’s chance came and he seized ib.
Dwyer, in return for Dad’s labor, carted in the
corn and took it to the railway-station when ib
was shelled, Yes, when it was shelled 1
We had to shell it with our hands, and whab a
merry time we had'! Fur the first half-hour we
didn’b mind it at all, and shelled cob after cob as
though we liked ib; but next day, talk about
blisters ! we couldn’t close our hands for them,
and our faces had to go without a wash for a fort-
night.
Fifteen bags we got off the four acres, and the
storekeeper undertook to sell ib. Corn was then
at 12s. and 14s. per bushel, and Dad expected a
big cheque.
Every day for nearly three weeks he trudged
over to the store (five miles) and I went with him.
Each time the storekeeper would shake his head
and say “No word yet.”
Dad couldn’t understand. At last word did
come. The storekeeper was busy serving a cus-
tomer when we went in, so he told Dad to “ hold
on a bit.”
Dad felt very pleased—so did I.
The customer left. The storekeeper looked at
Dad and twirled a piece of string round his first
finger, then said—“ Twelve pounds your corn
cleared, Mr. , but, of course (going to a
desk), there’s that account of yours which I have
credited with the amount of the cheque—thab
brings it down now to just .£3, as you will see by
the account.”
Dad was speechless, and looked sick.
He went home and sat on a block and stared
into the fire with his chin resting in his hands, till
mother laid her hand upon his shoulder and asked
him kindly what was the matter. Then he drew
the storekeeper’s bill from his pocket, and handed
it to her, and she too sat down and gazed into the
fire.
That was our first harvest.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Honest George,” writ-
ing re the killing by sharks of a Jap. pearl-diver
in Barrow Passage, W. A., says that this is the
first incident of the kind since the introduction of
diving apparatus. In the Admiralty Group, 15
years ago, the pearl-divers who used the apparatus
had some very nasty experiences in Calle
Harbor. In one instance a diver was seized—
just as he was stooping to pick up some shell
—by a shark, carried along for about 20
fathoms and then brought to the, surface by
the brute. The men in the boat above jumped
overboard to his rescue and were only just in
time, for the shark was *'worrying” him like a
fox-terrier would a rat. He was badly bitten
about his stomach and buttocks, where the shark’s
teeth had penetrated his diving-dress. The same
diver was also once attacked by a shark just as he
was coming to the surface, and nearly lost his left
arm. This shows that a shark, when hungry,
doesn’t mind a gutta-percha coating around his
dinner. Personally, I don’t believe that anything
would scare a shark except a Scotch supercargo or
a lady social-purity shrieker au naturel. —Mon-

Taken Over .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Banks are taking charge, old man, I knew
how it would be ;
The flags are flying half-mast high for death of
Tringadee;
The Boss has left, the boys are spread to all the
winds, and so
I think we’d better get the nags and sling the
packs and go.
It’s been a dear old home to us, a home we’ll not
forget,
And we’ve been loyal to the brand and would be
loyal yet;
But there is strife among the crew whose captain
leaves the ship—
The team won’t pull together when a new hand
takes the whip.
We’ve had for boss the best of men—they know
him far and wide ;
From Sydney out to Norman ton they speak his
name with pride.
And though we search from now till doom in every
clime and land,
We’ll never find a truer heart or defter bridle-
hand.
They’ve got some new-chum manager, and sent
him up from town
To spoil the mouth of Myall King and break old
Vanguard down—
The horses that the boss was proud to steer in
scrub and plain
Will never toss the bridle-bars beneath his hand
again.
They’ve picked their would-be stockmen from the
raw, rough Sydney push,
That never saw a bucking colt or smelt a sandal-
bush ;
And when they muster through the scrub for fats
in Hawthornden,
They’ll have to let the cattle rip and muster up
the men.
They’ll take our places in the hut, the bunks
where we have lain,
And smoke in the verandah where we’ll never
smoke again ;
They’ll take our saddles from their pegs, our
bridles from the wall,
And catch our favorite horses—ah ! we’ll miss
them most of all.
They’ll have no banjo-music in the station-hut at
night—
They’ll put the good old songs aside to swear and
drink and fight;
They’ll have no merry dancing when the off-camp
stockmen meet,
And the old boards creak and rattle to the tramp
of spur-decked feet.
There’ll be races in the township just the same
when we’re away,
But they’ll miss young Harden’s pony and your
finish on the gray ;
And when they meet at settling-time, above the
din and noise
They’ll be listening for our laughter, and they’ll
miss the Tringa boys.
And when the new-chum Tringa band goes riding
into town
To take the place of that old band the Banks have
broken down,
The girls will turn their backs on them and never
smile to greet
The men who spur our fancy hacks to prance along
the street.
The Banks are taking charge, old man—l knew
how it would be :
The flags may fly at half-mast high for death
of Tringadee;
It’s another home in ashes, and a name dust-
wrapped, and so
We’ll run the horses in to-night and sling the
packs and go.

Government inspection of machinery does

more to take their places. Bushmen will bucket
