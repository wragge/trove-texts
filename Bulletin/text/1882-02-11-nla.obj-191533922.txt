Our Country, Right or Wrong?
There is something peculiarly saddening to the
true Briton in the present circumstances and
apparent policy of the grand old mother-country.
By the true Briton, we would be understood to
mean the Briton who carries in his heart the
principles which every man of British strain has
been taught to believe form the foundation of
the national greatness, and constitute the title
of Great Britain to be regarded as the most
upright and generous among nations. The un-
thinking wretch, whose incapacity for compre-
hending principles betrays him into the delusion
that whatever a Government of Great Britain
resolves upon must be the current standard of
his country’s conscience, and, therefore, must bo
right, is, according to our view, not a true Briton.
The right of individual judgment has been the
very essence of British constitutionalism, and
upon an aggregation of private judgments the
solid structure of British institutions has been
founded. The claims of our nation to real great-
ness have, by common consent, been attributed
to a rectitude of national conscience, and a com-
bined determination that the nation should not be
dragged by monarohial influence, nor inveigled by
sordid greed, into proceedings which would have
been dishonourable to an individual.
• » •
There have’ been times when each Briton was
ready and prompt to sacrifice all that makes life
swe ot nay, even life itself, should personal
martyrdom appear necessary —for the preservation
of national liberty, or even of national rectitude.
From the day when the mail-clad barons ex-
torted, at a risk of incurring the deferred
vengeance of their monarch —a risk terribly real
in those days —a charter of civil rights for
Englishmen, down epoch by epoch to the time
when Edmund Bdrke and Charles James
Fox resisted alike the menaces and blandishments
of a ministry and of a court to plead on behalf of
the revolted Americana the cause of human
liberty and justice, there have ever been Britons
ready to cry aloud, and stand at their own peril in
the path, to turn the Government of their country
from crooked ways. It would bo pitiful to be
forced to believe that all these grand exploits had
been wrought in vain. It would be scarcely con-
solatory to think that, though not cultivated in
vain, the fruits of British patriotism were destined
to be garnered by humanity at large, while the
nation they were planted to benefit saw them
snatched away just at their maturity.
* * *
Yet, to the student of history there are appear-
ances visible which cannot leave to him the com-
Elaoent assurance, which the thoughtless may har-
our, that the day of Britain’s greatness shall
know no setting sun. There are signs in the
heavens, such as in times gone by have ever pre-
saged shame and disaster to that nation against
which the menacing appearances were directed.
Unless the eternal law of cause and effect has
been abrogated in favour of Great Britain, there
seems reason to apprehend that a period of tribu-
lation lies before her.
* • •
Let us briefly glance at the situation. The
mother country is confronted with two formidable
troubles. Of her remaining dependencies, two,
the most important in her eyes, are writhing in
her embrace, and all creation appears to conspire
to help their struggles to escape from her caresses
which they seem so powerfully to detest. Ire-
-1 and heaves in throes so horrible, that
nor bonds nor gags suffice to conceal from the
wondering world the deep-seated character of her
paroxysm. India, emaciated, depleted, too fright-
fully bled and enfeebled to move of her own force,
yet occasions her conqueror the most profound
anxiety, and imposes on her fresh labours a,nd
fresh enterprises repugnant alike to the genius
and to the principles of the British people.
* * *
The vital question to be solved by all who desire
to estimate the probable outcome is, whether our
country is simply undergoing a chastening ordeal,
providentially imposed for her future good; or
whether she is feeling the envenomed and fatal
beak of national sins come home to roost. If the
former be the case, there should be no cause for
heavy anxiety. But if it be the latter, what is
there left but despair ?
* * *
Taking first the case of Ireland. It is worthy
of notice that the development of events has com-
pelled an abandonment, almost absolute, of the
first argumentative positions assumed by the con-
ventional apologists of British Government. The
hard logic of facts has compelled a confession that
the agitation originally denounced as factious and
unreasonable had a real and tangible origin in a
long-endured and monstrous injustice. The lately
appointed Land Courts have, with a uniformity
which throws a terrible retrospective light on the
oppression long suffered by the industrious Irish,
reduced the rents heretofore paid to the
landlord class by one half! Thus proclaiming
to the world that .the idle rich have
been till now extorting from the poor
industrious a proportion of the fruits of their
toil, double what, according to the principles of
justice and humanity, ought to have been required
of them. And this is not all. The sufficiency of
even this prodigious abatement has been chal-
lenged, not by the native Irish alone, but by those
Ulster farmers, Protestants and Orangemen, who
are accounted the devoted adherents of British
domination in Ireland; by those residents of
Northern Ireland, in fact, who are the descend-
ants of the military settlers introduced by Crom-
well, or the invasive hordes of Scotsmen, who
flocked oyer to possess themselves of the lands
from which the old Irish inhabitants had been
ejected by military force.
* * »
It has become impossible any longer to pretend
that the discontent in Ireland is a factitious dis-
turbance, artificially created and nourished by a
handful of notoriety-seeking adventurers. The
supposed fomenters of sedition and disturbance
have been for months in prison. The right of
public meeting has been suppressed. Yet the
country continues in a state of scarcely concealed
insurrection. When the men of Ireland were
held down in a grasp of steel, the women stepped
forward and filled their places. For the first time
in the history of Great Britain, her powers have
been directed to the intimidation of women. Irish
ladies have been clapped into gaol, as if the
country were Austria and the administrator of
tho law of force were that Marshal Haynau,
whom the bargemen of London hunted into the
Thames when he dared to visit England after
waging war with tho liberty-loving women
of the Austrian Empire. And when the
women of Ireland were intimidated, the very
children took up the cause and formed their baby
league. If these facts did not point to a universal
national fermentation, what evidence would
suffice? If more were needed, it has been sup-
plied. Important discoveries have been made.
The sagacious authorities, who could not read
those signs which could not be forged, allowed
themselves to be convinced by documentary evi-
dence which any man who could use a pen might
concoct to order. The denials that the movement
is national are not withdrawn in words even now,
but by actions they are negatived. Troops upon
troops are not poured in hot haste into that country
of which it is assorted that the bulk of the popu-
lation is well disposed, and that only a few busy-
bodies are intimidating the entire nation to pretend
—greatly to their own disadvantage—that they are
malcontent.
* « •
But, apart from that, one has only to turn one’s
attention outside the boundaries of the distracted
dependency to those remote parts of the world
where Irishmen are found, far removed from the
suggested terrorism of the few but mischievous
agitators and rebels. What does one find in
America, in Canada, nay, here in Australia ?
Wherever an Irishman is met, his sympathies are
with the people who struggle against the British
Government. Talk to them in our streets. At-
tend their gatherings. The predominance of the
one feeling is unmistakeable. There is no longer
room for doubt that in this instance England is
suffering the punishment of a sin which has, after
many years, recoiled upon her head.
* * *
And how stands the case with regard to India ?
But a few days ago there was brought to our book-
stalls the most recent of British periodical publi-
cations, in one of which a writer vaunted the
immense and still growing wealth of the nation.
The Herald gave a digest of this remarkable
article, with running comments t but it did not
occur to the conventional writer to suggest the re-
flection as to how this vast accumulation of riches
has-been acquired. England was but a few cen-
turies back a poor country. Her kings were pen-
sioners of French monarchs. It is recorded of
Jacob Astob, the American millionaire, that
when asked by what art he built up his huge
fortune, he replied, “The difficulty is to get
together the first thousand dollars : the rest is
easy.” How did England, in her poverty, get
together her first “ thousand dollars ?” ” A com-
parison of dates with changes in her condition
supplies the answer. It was by the plunder of
India. Hear the testimony—unimpeachable testi-
mony—of the great Edmund Burks. Speaking of
the East India Company of Traders, he thus
delivered himself in the House of Commons :
“I say that from Mount Imaus (or whatever else
we call that large range of mountains that walls in
the northern frontier of India) to Cape Cormorin,
there is not a single prince, state, or potentate,
great or small, in India, with whom they have
come into contact, whom they have not sold.
Secondly, I say that there is not a single treaty
they have ever made which they have not broken.
Thirdly, I say that there is not a single prince or
state who ever put any trust in the Company,
who is not utterly ruined.”
•• ' •
Our unhappy country seized Hindostan by the
throat and robbed her, violated her, stripped her
to the skin. The money got by this tremendous
crime has been invested in business, put out at
usury, multiplied manifold. We are rich, but at
what a fearful cost to our national conscience !
India, so rich when we fell upon it, is to-day poor,
i We give her back alms from the fruits of her
spoliation, and call upon God Almighty to
witness how benevolent we are ; and we cling to
our victim. She retains habits of industry and
thrift. Year by year she yet affords some pick-
ings worthy of the attention of our younger sons ;
and for the sake of them, and because we are
ashamed to leave her, naked, degraded, wretched,
unused to self-control, a spectacle for the universe
to wonder and weep over, we cling to her still.
• m m
Mark the shocking result. See how evil glows
out of evil, and “ what a tangled web we weave,
when first we practice to deceive.” To-day our
nation, contrary to its higher instincts, and at
imminent peril of bringing upon itself a contest
with other Powers, with whom we are little cap-
able of coping, is compelled to cling convulsively to
the gateway of India, the Suez Canal, cut through
Egyptian territory. In order to retain control over
this, Great Britain is forced into the unnatural
role of aiding a despotic ruler to repress the first
reviving movements of national aspirations, the
first intelligent seekings among the Egyptian
people, after that grand system of constitutional
Government which it has been customary to
declare it has been the wise purpose of Providence
that England should communicate to the nations
of the world. How often have we been told from
the pulpit and from the rostrum, that it is to this
glorious end that England has been upheld by the
hand of the Almighty asthe one wise, the one
virtuous, the one upright Power among the nations
of the earth ! Is it then, to be the end of all our
national pride, our virtuous boastings, that the
day has come, when, for the sake of keeping our
clutch upon a thrice-plundered victim of our
avarice, we shall throttle liberal aspirations in a
people seeking but to imitate our own boasted
institutions, and perchance fight to the death
rather than, like their own Pharoah, “let the
people go?”
* * «
But there is virtue in repentance. There are
tokens that the national conscience commences to
quicken, and that the British people are not all
unmoved by the evidence which has been fur-
nished that Ireland at any rate has not been angry
without cause. Intelligence is to hand that an
English constituency has elected to represent it
in the House of Commons a declared Home
Ruler. The votes of Irish residents alone could
not have effected this. There must have been
English voters who made common cause with
them. When reflection is allowed to prevail, and
prejudice is overcome, there is no reason why the
grand magnanimity exercised towards the Boers
should not be repeated towards the Irish. Were
that spirit to prevail, there would be hope for our
country, and occasion for pure pride in the name
of Englishman.
Mr. Thomas Hungerford, M.P.
We give the portrait this week of Mr. Thomas
Hungerford, the new member for Northumberland.
This gentleman, though a new member of the
present Assembly, is not unknown to political life.
A few years ago he represented the same con-
stituency in Parliament, and has been absent from
political circles solely on account of the urgency
of his private business. Mr. Hungerford’s first
appearance in the Legislative Assembly was a
matter of general congratulation at the time, as
he was known to be a thoroughly earnest and an
independent man, with considerable breadth of
ideas and large experience. His career in the
Legislature to a very great extent justified the

general expectation. He proved himself a valu-
able acquisition to the debating power of the
House, and handled in a highly capable manner,
with manifest advantage to the Assembly, all the
leading questions which came up for consideration.
Mr. Hungerford’s conduct demonstrated that he
was too high-minded to be manipulated—a fact
which, though adverse to the success of party
Government, was greatly in his favour as a
representative of the people. He is a scion
of an old colonial family, who were doing
in the far interior the colossal work of coloniza-
tion half a century before the men now upper-
most were thought of. Mr. Hungerford has
inherited his father’s tastes for pastoral pursuits,
and is now largely interested in squatting pro-
perties in this colony and in Queensland. It is to
his credit that while supposed to be an active
representative of the squattocracy, he should be
returned to the Assembly by one of the most
radical constituencies in the colony. Our engrav-
ing is from an excellent photo, by Freeman, of
George-street.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Queen’s Speech.
The Speech from the Throne, delivered on Tuesday last
in the House of Lords, is marked by all the ordinary
characteristics of such effusions. Queen’s speeches
have come to be recognised as standard exemplars of
the “prunes and prism” and “agricultural imple-
ment ” stylo. In tholpresont instance, the deliverance
by the Lord Chancellor is perhaps more than ordinarily
a sham. It opens as if the most important subject
which could occupy the attention of the human race
were the nuptials of another of the Eoyal Princes.
Having made easy the minds of mankind with
respect to that paramount event, the Speech
proceeds to state that the relations of Great
Britain with foreign countries arc of a thoroughly cordial
character—a declaration which runs extremely well with
recent intelligence, thit there is a disposition among
the Great Powers to isolate England in connection with
diplomatic dealings affecting Egypt. The references
to that country are singularly slippery and devoid of
any meaning which can be pruned down, and with re-
gard to Ireland considerable dexterity is displayed in
saying nothing in the politest manner. Taken all round,
it seems probable that the wisdom or knowledge, the
hopes or fears, of mankind would scarcely have been
less affected had the Speech never been delivered than
they are likely to be by its delivery; anlif, for a few
more years, the sentences put into Her Majesty’s
mouth for utterance, bo framed in the same style, the
Queen of Great Britain would acquire the reputation
of speaking with less meaning and less sincerity than
any other individual within the realm.
Little Bismarckism.
The Minister of Instruction and the Herald are in a
state of great tribulation over the fact that the halls
of country Schools of Arts are oftentimes used for other
than pedagogic purposes. According to these authori-
ties, nothing that entertains can bo regarded as edn-
cational. They would like to have the assembly rooms
attached to the institutions in question given over to
lecturers on the nebular hypothesis, or the differential
calculus, and to the infinitesimal audiences which such
lecturers would attract. The idea of a dance or a
concert being held in any of these rooms is abhorrent to
the souls of the Minister and his echoing friend of the
Press; and the managers of Mechanics’ Institutes are
warned that it is their duty to cultivate a taste for such
intellectual pabulum as is served up by manipulators
of the blackboard. Of course, the hint will be taken
by committees in need of Government subsidies; and,
by and bye, many a country town will be deprived of
the use of its only assembly room. Evidently we are
getting good too fast in this country. We arc, indeed,
rapidly approaching a condition of things in which it
will be criminal to smile in the presence of “ those in
authority over us" or their myrmidons—in which the
country will be governed on the principles of a Congre-
gational chapel. But our point to-day has to do with
another feature of this governmental dictation to
Schools of Arts. Not very long ago, a gentleman who
has devoted half a lifetime to the study of Australian
land laws, and their economic incidence, essayed to
deliver a series of lectures on that pregnant subject
throughout this colony. Arrangements were made with
the various Schools of Arts for the use of their halls-
But lo 1 when the first lecture was given it was found
to be in advocacy of something different to free selec-
tion before survey—and the fiat immediately went forth
that the subject-matter was “ too political" for venti-
lation in these institutions. The halls consequently
were closed to the lecturer, and he had perforce to
abandon bis intentions in the matter. Small Bismarck-
ism sticks out here obviously. We laugh and wonder
sometimes when we road of the way in which the Ger"
man Chancellor is allowed by the great people he rules
to dictate to them as to what they shall discuss and
how they shall discuss it. Surely we need sigh and
wonder over the complacency of our “ liberty-loving”
people, in regard to snob a monstrous interference with
the foundation of all their rights, privileges, and
liberties—freedom of public debate.
A Dangerous Character.
A little more than a week ago the Melbourne Coroner,
at an inquest on the body of a man'who had died in the
hospital, condemned,with a determination of expression
which showed the strength of his convictions, the
sanitary condition of the bnilding itself. He pronounced
it te be saturated with germs of disease to such an
extent that trifling cases of injury, when brought
within its tainted walls, were constantly in danger of
assuming worse and even fatal developments; and he
declared that it would be well were the entire structure
to be demolished. Now, we live in an age where it is ous’
tomary for officials to take life as easily as circumstances
will permit, and the fact that one of this class should,
jnstead of drawing his salary, and winking very tight
at anything calculated to occasion worry or trouble to
himself, if meddled with, have spoken out so clearly*
uncompromisingly, and resolutely—as though he had
belonged to the troublesome class of persons who
*’ want to know, you know”—created quite a sensation.
The principal hospital doctors promptly arrayed them-
selves in opposition to this “intruding, rash, pre-
suming” Coroner, Dr. Youl, and declared, in strict
conformity with custom, that the old hospital was all
their fancy painted it, “’twas lovely, 'twas divine.”
Our own Herald took notice of the contention, and, in
a leading article, very characteristically remarked that
“It may be freely admitted that the language
©f the outspoken Melbourne Coroner was too strong.
If it had been weaker, however, nothing might have grown
out of it." The italics are, of course, ours. We have in
this wonderful sentence, a complete exposition of the
Herald’s system of thought. Although had the
Coroner’s language been weaker, it might have effected
nothing, yet it was too strong! In other words, it is
more proper, more decent, more respectable, to dilate
one’s thoughts with mawkish language than to do good
service to the community by vigour of expression. We
must, at least, recognise the consistency of our wealthy
contemporary. The system which it here propounds
it certainly practices with a most religions uniformity.
Better that patients go on dying in the establishment
intended for their cure—better that a hospital should
be a propagating house of blood-poisoning and gangrene
—than that there should be any vehemence of language,
so shocking to “ all right-thinking persons ’’ —a class
the Herald is extremely fond of referring to, Or»
locally applied, the principle rules that it is preferable
that the public should be afflicted, year after year, by
the most flagrant abuses, not only in the management
of charitable institutions, but in municipal, parliamen-
tary, and social affairs, rather than that the dull
decorum ef compromising journalism—so favourable to
the predominance of men of mediocre abilities —should
be disturbed. Pall down a hospital because its en-
venomed walls kill instead of core 1 Good Heavens I
Whitewash it.
POLITICAL POINTS.
N.Z. Government propose another loan of
£5,000,000.
Mr. Frazer has been returned for Tenterfield,
beating Mr. Bennett by 362 to 319 votes.
Pope Heanessy will, probably, succeed Sir
Arthur Kennedy, who, it is said, goes to N.Z.
Mr. Buchanan addressed his constituents at
Ljudgee on Monday evening. Meeting apathetic.
There is every probability of some more
resignations of seats in the Legislative Assembly.
There are several billets to be filled.
The members for Monaro, Messrs. Tooth and
Badgery, have been making a tour through their elec-
torate, and have been feted at Cooma and Nimitybelle.
The publicans’ representative in the Assembly
was heard to say the other day that he would gladly
support a bill to deprive Boman Catholics of the fran-
chise, provided a majority of the House agreed to vote
for it.
So the Hon. Mr. Pharazyn, M.L.C. of N.Z. , has
been deprived of all honours and offices except his seat
in Parliament, whieh is not affected by “ corrupt prao-
tioes.” We should think not. The man who drafted
that bill must have known the exigencies of colonial
politics well. It is to be hoped, if ever we advance to a
“ Corrupt Practices” Bill, it will be modelled strictly
in the linos of its New Zealand precedent—or where
would our scheming M.L.A.’s be ? We have heard old
hands on the wallaby bewail the disappearance of native
dogs from the “ great intayrior.” “No such thing as a
job of monkey-minding now. All fenced in.” What
weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth among the
fraternity “ on the job" if our jackals were to disappear
in the same way 1
The public should read the letter (published in
the S. M. Herald), in which Mr. G. H. Bold gave his
reasons fer declining to attand a local option meeting
to which he was invited last week. We notice that, so
far, no one has attempted to controvert the arguments
advanced in support of the position assumed by the
senior member tor East Sydney.
We have a particular objection to testimonials.
In fact, it would only be a very big purse before which
our principles would yield. And, by the way, the only
person (besides ourselves) that we know to be deserving
of a testimonial is our vocal friend, Mr. Andrew Fair-
fax. How many hundreds of charities, how many
dozens of struggling individuals, has this gentleman not
aided during the twenty-five years that he has been
before the public P
Mary of Carcoar has left the district for a better
state. (Bead that commencement carefully). Prior to
her departure, the “staff" of the Chronicle presented
her with a silver bracelet. He said he hoped Mary
would have a good time, and he also remarked that
when the coral and spoon-and-fork were wanted he
would be on hand. The staff then shed tears, and the
interesting ceremony ended by his reciting, in tones
rendered husky by—let’s say emotion—the last stanza
of Mary's “ Farewell to Carcoar" from the galley
proof. It was as follows .
“ Good bye 1 to dear old Milburn Creek, ne’er shall it
be forgot,
A sad adieu to Coombing Park, that fair, and hal-
lowed spot;
Farewell to Mount Macquarie’s height, to Coombing
waterfall.
I’ll see them sometimes in my dreams, but now, fare-
well to all."
Mary then retired, and the staff gracefully resumed his
place at the handle of the double-demy.
“Axe” sends us a poem called the “Elder’s
Soliloquy.” Here is a slab of it :
“Asl walk up the aisle.
With my self-approving smile.
The whole congregation in mute admiration
Shall gaze at me all the while."
He asks us “to find a use for it.” We have found a
use for it. Want of space, however, prevents us from
saying what use.

We have seen No. 2 of The Bicycle, a “ bi-

colonies," and we survive. Frank Weston has a forty-
horse power Wizard-Oil yarn in the pride of place, and
that’s the best thing we can see in it. As soon as there
are enough “cyclers” to make a paper run, we shall
start—until then. The Bicycle may rake in the three-
pences.
The following is the team chosen to represent
N.S.W. in the Intercolonial cricket match ;—A. and G.
Bannerman, Davis, Evans, Garrett, D. Gregory, Hid-
dlestone, Jones, Massio, Murdoch, Spofforth, Downes
(12th). This is, without doubt, the best eleven that
has ever represented this colony, and if the Victorian
team, weakened by the absence of Allan and Edwards,
can beat us this time, we ought to give up cricket and
go in for the manly game of lawn-tennis. Messrs. J.
Swift and E. Weller were chosen umpire and scorer
respectively. By the bye, have we ever scored a win
with J. Swift as umpire ?

Valentines.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS VALENTINE.
Go, missive mine.
Tell her (whose name to thee I love to breathe)
What longings twine
With subtle influence around the heart, and wreathe
A new life with the old.
Tell her that tale oft told.
When gentle tumults, sweet imaginings
The senses hold.
And Hope comes whispering of pleasant things.
Tell her how hot is love 1
As the soft full grace of loveliness conspires
The heart to move
To ardent love and passionate desires.
Swaying the mind
With soulful ecstaoy of passion strong.
That riots ; but not divin’d
This knowledge yet by me; I grope along
And seek to And.
HER VALENTINE.
Dear Valentine,
The wistful maiden’s friend denominate.
Thine ear incline
To this new tale of love insatiate.
’Tis not for me.
My heart to Love, unasked, to consecrate;
But can I flee
The influences soft, that dominate
The wildest throbs
That ever moved my bosom passionate;
While longing robs.
With cruel unrest, its peace, commensurate
With depths untried
Of Love, with living Hope affiliate ?
I dare confide
To thee a tender message, complicate
With all the arts
That Nature gives to keep inviolate
Our trustful hearts.
O Valentine,
I cannot say how batter’d is the gate
Of speech divine.
As the promptings from the full heart emanate,
And utterance plead,
* Striving vain to language to communicate
Deep Passion’s need.

CAUTION. —In our style of climate, with its
sudden changes of temperature —rain, wind,
and sunshine often intermingled in a single day—
it is no wonder that our children, friends, and
relatives are so frequently taken from us by neg-
lected colds, half the deaths resulting directly
from this cause. A bottle of Boschee’s German
Syrnp kept about your home for immediate use
will prevent serious sickness, a large doctor’s bill,
and perhaps death, by the use of three or four
doses For curing Consumption, Hemorrhages,
Pneumonia, severe Coughs, Croup, or any disease
of the Throat or Lungs, its success is simply won-
derful, as your druggist will tell. German
Syrup is now sold in every town and village on
tbia continent. Sample bottles, for trial, 9d.;

The Dean of Melbourne is 83.
Eev. Father Tuomy, of Tumut, is dead.
Another ecclesiastical big-wig off to England—
Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat.
Apparitions of the Virgin are very frequent in
all the devout countries of Europe just now.
At a public meeting in Adelaide a resolution was
affirmed that tho Bible should be read in State Schools.
The Eev. George Sutherland has received a
gold watch and a silver tea-service from his congrega-
tion.
St. Mary’s Cathedral will, according to Arch-
bishop Vaughan, probably be opened in August or
Septemoer next.
The Mormons are established in Auckland, and
hold regular meetings on Sundays. The female saints
ore in the majority.
The small N.Z. town of Amberleyhas developed
6, now religious society, who have dubbled themselves
‘ The Holy Innocents.”
“ Anglicanus,” in the Churchman, thinks
that when Bishop Barker gets the pastoral staff, he
Should al-o appear mitred.
Dr. Salmond, of the Southland (N.Z.) Presby-
terian Church, has bean impeached for stating that the
Eoman Church is part of the Church of Christ.
Mr. Moody says that newspaper men are the
hardest of all to convert. Which is, perhaps, only
another way of saying that they are intelligent.
The Presbyterian complains that, through-
out the churches of the denomination it represents,
one-third of the pews are empty on Sundays. Cheer,

The parish priest of the Madeleine in Paris
receives the splendid salarv of £6l per annum, and his
curates entirely dependant on the charity of the
people.
A late Canon of Hereford Cathedral described
the three schools of thought in the Church of England
(High, Broad, and Low) as “ Attitudinarism, Latitudi-
narism, and Platitudinarians.”
The Wesleyan mind has been sorely exercised
of late, on the subjeet of Sunday evening lectures at
the theatres. After much thought and tribulation, it
has been decided to start a show ia opposition to Mr.
Greenwood.
St. Mark’s, Darling Point — Another new curate.
Suggested motto: “ Brief life is here our portion.” The
new curate is the Eev. E. C. Spicer, a very aesthetic
young mar, from All Saints, St. Kilda, Melbourne, who
knows how to run a high-toned church.
The Eecord, a comic paper published in the
interests of a section of the Church of England, is very
rough on the Eoman Catholics, indeed. It calls Dr.
Colletti a “lying priest," and his Church “the Baby-
lonian Harlot of the Revelation.” This last is a very
neat expression, indeed.
The Southern Cross says;—“We want to
have our newspaper press baptized for Christ and put
under yoke to Christ’s Gospel. A thoroughly Christian-
ised press Would bring the millennium within sight.”
This is just our own yearn. And think of the result I
A sight of the millennium!
The Otago (N.Z.) Presbyterian Synod debated
at length during a recent session the question of marri-
age with a deceased wife’s sister. Ultimately the
motion was carried, by a majority of six, for referring
the question to the Presbyteries and Kirk Sessions,
with a view of dealing with it next year.
It is gratifying to learn that “ the last instal-
ment of £2t odd shillings” has been forwarded to
Chiniqny from Sydney. Mr. Chiniqny is about the
most dangerous Freethought propagandist who has yet
visited these shores, and did more in a week to dis-
gust people with “unco guidness” than Ingersoll,
Bradlaugh, Bright, Greenwood, and the rest could de in
a century.
A clergyman at London was imprisoned for
stealing books. Evidence showed that his wife and
family were actually starving. The magistrate gave them
£5 from tho poor-box. The Archbishop of Canterbury,
a lowly follower of the meek and humble Jesns, gets
£15,000 a year. We do not say these things have any
connection. The Archbishop would probably shudder
at the idea of any connection with a starving clergy-
man.
Church affairs are lively at Port Macquarie.
The parson called a meeting to elect a trustee,
in place of one resigned ; but another trustee, who
didn’t love the parson, called a meeting on his own
account for the same purpose, at the same place, on the
same day. The opposing factions met. The parson
had the authority of the bishop at his back, the trustee
claimed the majority of the votes. Eventually two
trustees were elected —one by each party; but as only
one is wanted, the matter seems to he about as un-
settled as ever.
“Extremes meet. On dit, that at the next
meeting of the Sydney Diocesan Synod, Mr. G. B.
Dibbs (with concurrence) will move that a vote of
sympathy be accorded to a certain Bank manager, for the
treatment received by him at the late General Synod!—
And has it come to this I What a very different thing
Sydney High Churchism is from the genuine English
article ! It is also said that, at next Synod, Mr. Dibbs
will submit a motion that tho Athanasian Creed be ex-
punged from the Prayer Book. Is it part of the bargain
that the manager shall support the motion ? If so,
how will “the Vicar" vote? Dr. Barry will laugh
consumedly at all this, but still it “ cannot but make
the judicious grieve."
On Bth Dec., the Pope canonised four more
saints. Some three thousand persons were present,
many of whom arrived as early as 5 a.m. The pro-
ceedings lasted till past three o’clock in the afternoon.
Leo XIII. was attended by the Swiss and Palatine
Guards, as well as by the Papal Volunteers, who still
number about three hundred men, mostly of good
family. Gilt loaves and keys of wine and water, and
several cages of live birds (representing the virtues of
the new saints), were presented to the Pope during the
ceremony. It would appear, from the official accounts,
that if cleanliness is next to godliness, dirt is godliness
itself. One of the blessed, named Labro, it is said,
never washed and never changed his linen, but spent
his time in praying under the arches of the Coliseum.
There are several acolytes training in these parts who,
so far as abstention from washing and general dirtiness
are concerned, are qualifying fast for future promotion;
but they spend their time, or a good deal of it, in
avocations other than prayer. The true latter-day
saint must be rich and oily, capable of praying or pre-
varicatisg as may be required, and of expounding the
views of the Deity on the Education Act, the Sunday
opening of libraries, and the running of Sunday trams.
Mr. O. B. Frothingham, a radical lecturer and
reader in America, has written a letter to a New York
paper, containing some remarkable utterances. Being
a radical preacher, he says, he has found himself snr-
rounded by persons who seem to think that he ought
to be radical in everything else, and his independent
church has become a sort of magnet for very queer and
not pleasant characters. They consider that having
seceded from strict orthodoxy, he has no right to stop,
but must go on to dead materialism. This he declines
to do, abhorring materialism as much as any Evan-
gelical could abhor it. He claims, not to demolish all
existing beliefs, nor yet to create new ones; but to re-
pair, as it were, and restore the spiritual essence of
religious faiths which have become perverted. He has
a sense of the limits of Freethought, and says that
beyond those limits it becomes more offensive than the
most dogmatic Galvanism. The indiscriminate de-
stroyers, who tore dowi but never built up, should
have no sympathy from him, nor does he think they
have made much headway during the last twenty years.
Felix Adler’s materialistic movement amongst the Jews
only prospered through his ability, not its own intrinsic
truth. Monouro Conway’s lectures were only enjoyed
as mental exercise; and Pere Hyaointhe’s departure
from Eoman Catholicism would have been more suc-
cessful had he gone less far. Whether the conservatism
in bis nature ia reae sorting itself or not, he does not
know, but Mr. Frothingham says that the creeds of
to-day do not seem so groundless to him now as they
y® ars a B°t and he confesses that nndoubting and
ptten ignorant men seem to find a comfort and dignity
in revealed religion which the materialist and tho
inconoclast cannot find anywhere. After discarding
revealed religion, he now inclines to the thought that,
after all, there is something behind or below it, which
the most searching scientist will never be able to define.
To sum up the whole matter, says he, the work I have
been doing appears to lead to nothing, and may have
been grounded on mistaken premises. Therefore, it is
better to stop. I recant nothing; I simply stop deny,
ing, and wait for more light.—These confessions are
very remarkable; and if they indicate anything, they
can only mean that Mr. Frothingham is “coming
round ” again.
THE KOOKABURRA.
An honest man ia the noblest pursuit of woman.
A man is known by the company he keeps out of.
A young man getting up late says he hasn’t as
much spirits as he had before he went to bed.
Lord Alvanley spoke of a man who “ muddled
away his fortune in paying his tradesmen bills.”
Tho coming woman will not marry until she is
able ta support a husband in the style he has been ac-
customed to at home.
When the Old Testament is revised and modern-
ized, it will probably state that Adam, after eating the
apple, received word that his resignation would be
accepted.
“Had drank” is not good English grammar,
says a high authority. It certainly is not. “Was
drunk” is better grammar, and more in accordance
with the facts.
The high hats are voted a nuisance at the
theatre, but are just the thing for the church. An
elder sitting behind one of them can sleep during the
sermon and the preacher never know it.
“ Tommy,” said a mother to her seven-year-old
boy, “ you must not interrupt me when I am talking
with ladies. Yon must wait till we stop and then you
can talk.” “ But you never stop,” retorted Tommy.
Writes an esteemed correspondent: “A
burglar attacked my house last night supposing I was
unarmed; he leaves an interesting, and, so far as I know,
an innocent family. What shall be done for the
children ? ”
The men who carry advertising boards on breast
and bajk along the pavement are sometimes called
human sandwiches, but an old citizen says ho
can’t see any resemblance. There is too much meat
between the slices.
“You appear to have lost your stomach,”
sarcastically remarked a fellow-boarder to a man whose
plate he passed along to the carver for the sixth time.
“ Bedad,” exclaimed an astounded Irish waiter, “ it’s
only the bottom of it he’s lost.”
A mummy has recently been discovered in
Egypt, and is supposed to be that of Potiphar’s wife.
This supposition is strengthened by the fact that the
mummy’s hand grasps a piece of linen, on which is
marked, “Joseph Bar Jacob 2.”
In Melbourne, trials of a new spark-catcher are
being made, though not as yet with much success.
Many a girl with quite a resplendent train has been
working away at that experiment in all the colonies for
some years with no better result.
Upon a Sunday evening, when the soul ia lifted
on the wings of faith and a holy calm broods over all
nature, what tender regret comes with the thought that
the tubs must be got up from the cellar, so that wash-
ing may begin at 5 o’clock Monday morning.
Scene in a recitation room: “The ancient
Egyptians were in the habit of sacrificing red-headed
girls to the devil.” Anburn-baired student: “ What
did they do with red-beaded boys ? ” Professor: “ They
supposed they would go of their own accord.”
Thousands of young men in this country would
become millionaires if they could accomplish it by
standing at street corners with their hands in their
pockets, spitting tobacco juice on the walks, and mak-
ing themselves both unoruamental and obnoxious.
Amongst the proceedings of a Sunday-school
Convention, is found the following resolution, agreed
to on the motion of a promising young lawyer: “Re-
solved, that a committee of ladies and gentlemen be
appointed to raise children for the Sabbath-school.”
WOMAN ITEMS.
The growing custom of wearing mourning for a
deceased sweetheart should be discouraged. When half-
a-dozen different girls suddenly appear in black at a
young man’s funeral, the situation is embarrassing.
The Eockhampton Benevolent Society contem-
plate the establishment of a creche—a place where
mothers going to work from home during the day can
leave their babies to be cared for till evening. A com-
mittee of ladies, supported by the Anglican clergyman,
are energetically moving ia the matter.
The only woman who has ever spoken in the
House of Lords, except the Queen, was the late Lady
Avonmore, formerly Miss Theresa Longworth, but
better known as the celebrated Mrs. Yelverton. She
was highly accomplished as a journalist, musician,
nurse, and traveller, and is buried at Natal.
A week or two ago, a party of ten girls, from a
leading scholastic establishment of Balmain, started
from Manly, and walked to the scene of the Collaroy
disaster. They then shook out their dresses, re-arranged
their hairpins, and walked back by Way of the rocks to
Manly—finishing up fresh. And yet people sr.y colonial
girls can’t walk.
At New London, Connecticut, died John Weeks,
aged 114. When 106 he married his tenth wife, who
was only sixteen. His grey hairs had fallen off and were
renewed by a dark head of hair. A new set of teeth had
made their appearance, and he ate 31b. of nork, 21b. or
31b. of bread, and drank nearly a pint oi wine a few
hours before his death.
Some nine months or a year ago a stir was made
about a “ Young Women’s Christian Society.” A
grand meeting took place. Bishop Barker presiding,
money was collected, and a committee formed ; Lady
Manning, treasurer. From that we have heard of the
affair no more. The idea was, we believe, to open an
establishment where girls, without home or parents in
the city, could live and find amusement or instruction as
they desired. This is a most desirable institution, and
we would be glad to hear if the object is still being
preserved, or if this committee are working.
Poor Jim Carey, of the Palmer Hotel, Brisbane,
has gone to his last resting place. A more genial and
gsod-hearted Boniface never lived. He will be regretted
much in theatrical circles all over the colonies, by
those who used to frequent his house. He leaves a
young widow. It is to be hoped that her friends will
rally round her.
De Neuville’s superb picture, “ Eorke’s Drift,”
has arrived by the Garonne for the Art Gallery of New
South Wales. When it is released from Quarantine
lovers of the fine arts will indeed have a rich treat.
Several new and charming pictures have been recently
added to the Gallery, but what are the subjects ? Labels
are very much required, in fact are indispensable to the
intelligent appreciation of every picture. Perhaps the
trustees will at once take steps to have them supplied
where wanting. By the way, could not some coir
matting be laid down in the rooms, now that the
Parliamentary vote is available; and if a few pounds
could bo spared for painting (in a similar manner to
the vase-room) the undraped walls of the side rooms, it
would add greatly to their appearance. At present,
these rooms are very shabby looking, and suggest the
idea of pawnbroker’s lumber stores.
“ The last infirmity of a noble mind ” is to carry
a sandwich-board.
It appears that one-sixth of all the pastoral runs
in N.S.W. are held by banka and other monetary insti-
tutions.
The Queensland Civil servants are petitioning
their Government to be allowed to close the offices at
4 o’clock.
On the voyage between Havana and New York,
the Newport (s.s.), of Ward’s line, while going at the
rate of 15 knots, cut a couple of whales clean in two.
Almost every day we hear of an execution by
hanging, in some part of the world, where the victim
struggled convulsively for a considerable time I Why
is the swift and certain guillotine not used ? It is
surely more merciful.
On the average, a person of one year may be
expected to live 39 years longer ;of 10 years, 51; of 20
years, 41; of 30 years, 34 j of 40 years, 28; of 50 years,
21'; of 60 years, 14; of 70 years, 9; of 80 years, 4.
Overheard in a tram-car. —First Young Lady :
“I like them both, but I’ve made up my mind to marry
Tom.” Second Young Lady: " Why, Minnie, Charlie’s
ever so much handsomer.” First Young Lady: “ Yes,
I know it; but Tom’s in the hairpin business, and Pa
says there is a big margin in hairpins.”
Complaints have of late rolled in in tons respect-
ing the practice of persons bathing at the wharves in
sight of passing steamers; Balmain being specially
singled out for this very undesirable spectacular exhi-
bition. Not the slightest notice, however, is taken of
these complaints; the police probably mistake the
sport for picnic frolics.
A remarkable fossil has been found near Barwon
Heads. The head from the beak to within half an inch
behind the eyes is that of a bird in its natural condition,
or, rather, as if stuffed. It is perfect; thence to the
commencement of the tail it is solid heavy stone, whence
there is an elongation of about 10 inches of material
resembling the tail of a rat, but flattened, and having
the consistency of indiarubber.
It now transpires that the cause of the very
slow speed attained by that hugest of ironclads, the
Inflexible, upon her home trials, was the fact
that her bottom was foul. Her speed, when tested at
home, was slightly over 12i knots ; at Malta, after the
sides and bottom of the vessel had been thoroughly
cleaned, she attained 14i knots, thus exceeding even
the original estimate of her constructors.
“Why,” asks a home writer, “ should not the
Employers’ Liability Act be applied to the Army ? A
soldier is killed in action, but his wife has now no claim
foe a pension, and is left dependent on private charity
or on the parish. I think the widow and children of
every private soldier killed in action should have an
indefeasible right to a pension. Why should such a
boon be limited to the officer class only ? ”
“ America,” writes an English paper, “ is send-
ing us prime beef and mutton. American wool is oust-
ing English from the market. American apples are
more numerous in the English market than home-
grown. America is now sending us ‘English’ plum-
puddings, ready for boiling. American horses have this
year won the principal races in England and France.
And now that America is bestirring herself about her
navy, what will be left for p»or old England to plume
herself uponP”
Petersham.
0, lift me to the light of day I
My burning eyes can hardly see
The dim blue heaven, where they say
My spirit soon will be.
There, lay me in the tender grass,
So cool, whereon to rest my head ;
And let the dwindling moments pass
In peace, till I am dead.
Tho war of twenty broken years
Has dinned its clangour on my brain;
But I grew weary with its cares,
And peace has come again.
I was a child in thought and deed—
Yet, who would stretch an arm to save
Who help me in my utmost need.
And lift me from the grave ?
I would reproach with bitter words.
For child of sin I could not be ;
But, ah I I cannot, while tho Lord’s
Deep peace is over me.
They do not in their worldly hearts
So comprehend me as I lie ;
Mv soul expanding as it starts
In fr«odom to the sky.
Majestic is the thought of death
Tome, who knoweth naught but, pain—
To draw a newer, sweeter breath.
And live a child again 1

Siberian Exiles.
Bevondthe Ural mountains.
Where wolf and bear abound.
In far Siberia’s wildness.
Shall freedom yet be found!
Though clanking chains may bind the limbs.
And leave the sinews weak.
Each wound shall one day find a tongue,!
Each hardened scar shall speak.
Oh! Russia, thou shalt hear their voice.
Which to the world shall call;
The victims of thy hate shall be
The conquerors at thy fall.
Go, view the martyrs of tby wrath,
Inspect thy captives’ chains.
Whose measured clinking scares the fox
Upon Siberia’s plains.
Go, hearken to the heart-wrung sobs
That rise upon the breeze.
Go, count the bones that lie beside
Siberia’s frozen seas.—
While faithful wives, disconsolate.
Their husbands’ exile mourn;
While children weep, and watch, and pray,
Imploring their return.
Alas! in vain the hitter tear
Their childish vision dims;
For Russia’s hate has forged the chains
That bind their father’s limbs j
His native land behind him lies,
Siberia’s woes before, —
Unhappy heart I his children’s arms
Shall twine his neek no more.
Not dead, indeed j but worse than death
To thus be forced apart: j
Ah ! who can paint the woe that fills
An exiled father’s heart I
Poor banished one: —can words convey
The fulness of his pain—
Can our unfettered limbs conceive
The burden of his chain—
As marching o’er the frozen snows
The eagle hovers nigh.
To mock the gyves of those v/ho live.
And feast on those who die ?
Talk not of freedom giv’nto serfs.
While such as these things are:
Tho mercy to those exiles shown.
They’ll show to thee, proud Czar!

SUNDRY SHOWS.
We are glad to be able to conscientiously record
that the drama is in the ascendant. At last a play has
been produced which, to pnt it mildly, raises theatrical
representation to a pinnacle which Ben Jonson could
never have hoped for or Shakspeare dreamt of.
««Michael Strogolf," a piece produced at the Gaiety on
Saturday last, is a drama which, when we are dead and
gone, future worlds will clutch at. The author of the
novel of that name is an insignificant groveller flamed
Jules Verne, but the dramatist is no less a person than
the immortal Hopkins. In M. Verne’s romance, the
motif was, so far as we remember, the perilous adven-
tures of the Courier of the Czar, in his endeavour to
deliver a despatch to the Russian general in command
of the forces in Khiva. Mr. Hopkins, however, has
improved on all this. With him, the Courier’s adven-
tures are, comparatively speaking, a secondary cen-
sideration. His object is the apotheosis of Mr Julian
Thomas, otherwise “ The Vagabond." To Mr. Thomas,
who has had. the world at his feet so often and so long,
we should have thought that this new attempt to bring
Rim into notoriety would have been unnecessary. It
would appear not, however, since that gentleman has,
we understand, evinced a lively interest in the piece
■ever since it has been in rehearsal. This, though,
may be explained by the fact that great people are ever
fond of flattery. Lesser lights than our friend Julian
were notorious for their love of adulation. Wellington
loved only those who flattered him. Napoleon would
crush a nation for a compliment. Lord Byron’s dearest
associates were grovellers. Who, therefore, shall
blame “The Vagabond” for laving to be eulogised—
and advertised ? Not we, in sooth. All we pant for is to
eulogise him and advertise him ourselves!
• * *
The piece itself, detailing as it does the adven-
tures of “ The Vagabond," is of surpassing interest. At
all times it is absorbing, frequently it is appalling, and
occasionally it is blood-curdling. The ir terest which is
centred by admiring millions in Mr. Thomas is so
strong, that we have no doubt whatever His Apotheosis
will have a lengthened run. We hope it will. No
better moral could be pointed than by the glorification
of such a great man. No tala could be more fitly
adorned than by the idealization of so splendid a
genius.
* * *
But it must not be thought that there is nothing
in "Michael Stro£off” Ibut The “Vagabond’s” personal
adventures. There is much more. People plot, make
love, conspire, and weep. There is a pony—a consum-
mate comedian, to whom the elephant at the Royal is
simply a super. He is a sedate animal, whom nothing
ruffles. His eye is always fixed awaiting his cue, and
mot even the voice of the gods can distract his attention
from his business. Ha is an animal who would be
equally at home drinking port wine with the clown,
and doing a matutinal spin with the milk cart. He was
made to draw—and we hope he will—not only the milk
cart, but all Sydney.
# • •
If we saw nothing but “TheVag’s” apotheosis on
onr first visit, it was our own fault. But we do not
consider it necessary to ask our readers’ pardon for
this. Doubtless they equally, with ourselves (for it is
an epidemic), are enthralled in all that pertains to this
literary Colossus.
* * *
A criticism of the acting, therefore, we shall
defer until our next issue. We may, however, remark
that the piece is splendidly dressed and magnificently
mounted, and that the first act is rendered remarkable
by Mr. W. G. Carey’s marvellously realistic impersona-
tion of the Czar. We feel that we should be doing
an injustice to Messrs. Emmett and Poole, did we not
compliment them upon the hardy manner in which they
withstood the frosty cold of Moscow, clad only in even-
ing dress and light overcoats. We recommend every-
body to see this piece. One trial alone—as in the case
of the ointment—will convince the most sceptical as to
its marvellous merits.
* * * *
We are pleased to be able to record that the
Victoria Hall has, at length, scored a success. “ Ages
Ago,” now running there, is precisely the sort of enter-
tainment for which the place is adapted. It is a piece
brimful of melody and merriment; a sparkle and crackle
•all through. The motif of the little opera is a whimsical
-one, and the music is exceedingly tuneful. The cast
•comprises five personages only, and they all work with
:a will to make the trifle go. The result is a charming
•entertainment, and one which ought to run for many
weeks.
« # *
The principal female character, Eosa, is taken
by Miss Marie Trevanion, formerly of the Montague-
Turner Opera Company—a clever little lady, with
plenty of good looks and plenty of embonpoint. Miss
Trevanion possesses a soprano voice of moderate com-
pass but singular clearness. It is a penetrating voice,
too —one of those voices that seems to go in at the back
of your neck and come out at your boot-heels. So far
as the music is concerned, there is nothing to cavil at
in Miss Trevanion’s impersonation of Rosa, but, evea
though in her acting she is as arch as arch can be, she
has much to learn both in the delivery of her words
and the management of her business.
• « •
Miss Jennie Horan —who shall have a nice little
par.all to herself—plays an old woman, “Maggie,” with
much quaint humour. Both her solo and her part
singing would “ knock” any but a star nightingale, and
a thrush would break its heart by attempting to com-
pass the smallest of her roulades. Her impersonation of
Mrs. McMotherty contributes in no small degree to the
general success of the pretty little trifle. We would
♦ay even more than this, but we don’t want to make the
par, too big to go into Miss Jennie’s locket.
* # •
Mr. Stuart Bolton’s Columbus is an agreeable
without being a brilliant performance; and Mr. Martyn
Hagan’s Tare, though highly amusing, might be toned
.down with advantage. Undoubtedly, however,
•the suooesj of the piece is the clever comedian who
chooses to masquerade under the name Of Mr. J. Bed-
ford. Ha plays the Steward, a decrepit poet, full of his
own doggral quotations, and his interpretation of the
character is, in its way, a perfect study.
• * •
The entrepreneur is Mr. C. Maddick, and Mr.
Scholer is to be congratulated upon having secured lor
his hall an entertainment, which, while it is of the
highest class in point of character, yet appeals by reason
of its sparkling music and eccentric motif to all sec.
tions of the community. We recommend every one to
visit this charming little hall, and assist at “Ages
Ago.” The opera is followed by a farce in which Miss
Lena Dignam plays a coy maiden. But wo never stop
for farces.
* * * *
Last nights of the Eoyal Pantomime, Well,
we can’t be happy for ever. It will be dnll work, how-
ever, listening to the blank verse of Shakspeare after
the melting melody of Scott’s couplets. We don’t know
what tho management are doing. Why don’t they put
on another play by this illustrious author ? There is
no excuse for them in Hot doing so. Lewis has got any
amount of tragical pantomimes locked up in his shoe-
trunk.
# * #
Jim Allison has increased the height of all hia
boot-heels by half-an-inch. His Excellency Lord Cook-
a-doodle-do —we mean, Loftns—has given the Shak-
spearean season his patronage—so, therefore, a big roll
up of the fashionables may be anticipated ; and there
will be a twinkle in the eye of Goodman, and once
again the incog, countess in the cloak room will hear
the rattle of the welcome shilling as it is dropped into
the suggestive saucer. James has grt together, per-
haps, the bast Shakspeareau company that has ever
played in Sydney.
# * *
La belle Pomeroy—whom we hope to interview
shortly—is a host (though when we interview her she
will be a hostess) in herself. Her Imogen is bound to
be picturesque. As the Herald would—and probably
Will—say, the undulating grace of her symmetrical form
Will hold spellbound the spectator, even without the
Silvery tones of her melodious voice rippling through
the double row of orient pearls which —which—to —
hotel hash are the demon foes. Bound, you see, to end
With anti-climax!—And this reminds us. We wonder
how many millions it would take to bribe Allison to
•Uow us to play lachimo for “ one night only.” " Cym-
beline ’* will positively be produced on Saturday night;
and when we state that His Excellency will be present,
and that Miss Theresa Horan has been specially engaged,
we are quite certain that nothing more is required to
ensure a phenomenal roll-up.
* * »
One Word more—although this really ought to be
In the “ Social” column,—We hear that as soon as he
gets tired of making money, Mr. Allison will positively

* * * *
Let’s bunch together a lot of agents, and get
rid of them. Well, then, Joe Goodman goes to Adelaida
with Allison and the pantomime, as acting-manager for
Garner. We anticipate that Je-oseph will “get" them
in the floury city, and, when he has stood outside the
theatre far a few nights, the “ Goodman grin ” will be
the only thing—excepting, well, ice-cream—that the
girls will care for. Mr. Frank Weston manages for
Miss Pamerov, Josh being only the bloated entrepre-
neur. This Frank Weston, we may mention, is not
the Wizard Oil Prince. There is no oil about him,
and precious little " Frank,” except your name is on
the door. Mr. W. Jenkins (Mr. Williamson’s repre-
sentative at the Opera House during the “ Patience ”
season) sailed for New Zealand by the Arawata on Tues-
day, where he will take Mr. James Moore’s place with
the “Struck Oil” crowd, as Jimmy has to pilot
“ Patience.” Mr Q. A. Goodman stays in Sydney to
manage for Mr. Allison, The “ Patience” people have
gone; however, we are happy to report him pale but
composed,
* * * *
Mr. Edwin Palmer baa left the Gaiety Company,
and has gone with Mrs. E. P. to join that of Mrs. Lewis
at the Bijou, Melbourne. Our opinion of Mr. Palmer
is well known. Ho would be a credit to any theatrical
company in the world. We wish him luck, and con-
gratulate Mrs. Lewis. And, by way of another chatty
item, we might mention that the Federal Australian
states that Mr. Howard Vernon is vulgar as Bunthorne.
Of course, then, ho must be vulgar. The F.A., by the
way, is getting very—exclusive. No one in Sydney
ever sees it, excepting neatly folded in the shop win-
dows. Talking of the greatest journalistic success in
the world, reminds us of a histrionic success. Mr.
Dewhnrst is in Ballarat. But this is getting rather too
solid. Three stars, please, Abe.
# * *
Thanks. We have a note from Ibey Solomon,
who states that the Dwarf drew big money in Grafton,
and that he is now back in Sydney and going to some-
where ; but he writes such a shocking bad hand that
we can’t make out the place. In some lights it looks
like Binalong, and in others Babylon. Let’s say Baby-
lon until wo receive a correction in the form of a printed
threo-sheeter. And that recalls to our memory that at
Auckland the Maori King, Tawhiao, visited a nigger
minstrel show, and, when he laughed, completely took
the starch out of the corner-men.
* * * *
Bnrnand’s {esthetic comedy, “ The Colonel,”
will bo produced—and we get this item centuries ahead
of our contemporaries—at the Melbourne Opera House,
on the Bth of April. The cast will include George
Forbes —the best eccentric old man in Australia—
Harkins, Cates, and Garner. Mrs. Garner has also been
engaged; and we take the opportunity of remarking
that she looks charming after her trip. Talking of the
Garners, by the way, we can, with singular appropriate-
ness quote Mantalini:—“ When they walk together in
the street, all the men cry out ‘ She’s got a dem’d fine
husband,’ and all the women ejaculate— ‘ He’s got a
dem’d fine wife.’ ” The author of this is one Dickens,
who is now dead. We say this because there is another
author hanging about the theatres who might claim it.

asking to know why we don’t notice him. To this we
humbly reply that there are a few more people
in the world than even Maccabe, and that we

ever, has remedied the evil. So let ns be joyfnl. And
while we ard thus happy, we may state that the circus

Is yon wish to be grievous bodily harmed by
Mr. James Allison, you had better say, in an airy style,
“ Going to produce * Cymbeline,’ eh ? Who’s to play
Imogen? Oh, Ada Ward, of course.” Try it, gentle
reader. They only charge 18g. per week in St. Vincent’s
Hospital. By the way, that just brings in the item that
James and Thynne have engaged the Mendelssohn Quin-
tette Club for Adelaide and Melbourne.

Mr. G. L. Goodman tells ns, in his best round
text, that there will he the last juvenile night of the

nothing in this except what meets the eye.

At tbs Princess’s Theatre, Melb., a piece called
“ The Major” has been produced. It is the “ Widow

England—under another name. ** Crutch and Tooth-

We have received a long letter from Newcastle
about a play produced thei e called “Baffled,” and
which the writer is anxious w e should favourably notice

this. Our correspondent se is forth as an inducement
for us to be kind that Mr. W. Sadler is writing another
play. He also states that he • will send ns “ the synopsis
of ‘ Baffled ’” in a day or two . We entreat him not to.
I We know quite as much ahe ut “ Baffled ” as we want
to do, and though possibly a .greeing with our corres-
pondent that it is “ very cret lltable considering that it
is his maiden effort at dramatising,” we don’t advise
Mr. Sadler to resign a competence and take to writing
for the stage. “ Baffled ** was prodnced three years
ago, and from what we heard about it then, we are dis-
posed to think that, though he may be a very good
Sadler, he is by no means a brilliant playwright.

A law suit, which might have been productive
of dreadful consequences, has happily been averted,
and the parties concerned have kissed and made it up—
the lawyers and clients separating after a whisky-and-
soda, and the hatchet being definitely buried. One
love-sick maiden, it would seem, said “ things ” about
two other love-sick maidens, and this having trans-
pired, the injured damsels sought redress at the hands
of their solicitor. The accusation (false, of course)
made against the twain ot “Patience” choristers was
that they always went to Parramatta by way of Afrika;
and that, instead of their aunts living at Moscow, as
stated, they resided five miles out of Dubbo, on the
Bathurst road. This was more than flesh and blood
could stand, so the slandered ones resolved to wash out
the insult offered to their reputations in the inkstand
on the Water Police Court table. Everything, we
lejoiee to say, has now ended happily; so now the three
all dress together, tie one another in turns, and the
“make-up box” is once again common property.

Mr. W. J. Wilson has returned from Melbourne,
where, we hear, he was offered, by Wybert Reeve, the
position of scenic artist at the Opera House. Whether
or not he accepts the position in question is under-
stood to be contingent on the result of his negotiations
for a further lease of the Opera House, Sydney, which
is now empty. The proprietary, it mnst be admitted
on all hands, showed rather a want of ocumea in per-
mitting a house which has only just got on its logs to
he ondo more bossed by the bats. We hope to see Mr.
Wilaott again manager of the Opera House.
"THE POOR PLAYER.”
[Correspondence is invited from members of the theatrical
profession.]
Lotti Wilmot gave a farewell lecture at Christ-
church (N.Z.) lately. There was a fair audience, and
Madame gave an address on her “ One year’s experience
in New Zealand,” detailing the various adventures in
her professional career, and touching upon the "op-
position ” she had recently encountered. At the
conclusion of the lecture, a spiritualistic stance was
held, in which those who desired ascended the platform
and " sat in circle ” round a table on the stage The
Pomeroy season in Christchurch concluded with a
“ ben." to the star, when she appeared as Lady
Macbeth. At latest dates. Miss Pomeroy was at the
Princess, Dunedin, Invercargill to follow Mrs.
Williamson was the recipient of a benefit when at
Dunedin. There was an immense house Carrie
Godfrey (Mrs. W. A. Thompson) severed her connection
with the Montague-Turner Co. at Auckland. Differ-
ences with management the cause. An interesting
event will shortly take place in the Thompson family....
A West Coast (N.Z.) contemporary goes for Miss Leaf
thus:—"She has a voice like a canary, and can throw
such pathos into her efforts that her hearers are quite
awe-stricken.” After this, we shall never be able
to look upon a canary without fear and trembling
Miss Maggie Forde and Stuart Bolton, have, it seems,
formed tbemselves into an opera company. They
opened at Wollongong the other evening, and this is
a little of what the local Aeous says about them: —
" Miss Maggie is of course the centre of attraction,
the sun round which the smaller stars revolve, and
any one seeing her graceful dancing, and grand
impersonation of character as developed by the
La-de-dah, as also her famed Lightning Changes, in
which she does the great Maocabe. [I! 11] Miss Lena
Dignam, K.S.E. A.M. [Mil] is a pianiste of no mean
calibre, her execution being perfect. Mr. Stuart Bolton
is the possessor of one of the richest voices we have
heard for many a long while, as an actor few are his
equals and none superior on the metropolitan boards.”
[I! 111] We suppose this must have been written before
they appeared. However, we are quite sure that
the editor’s anticipations were more than realised
Theatrical scandals rife in Melbourne. One young
actress disappeared for a while from her husband’s roof,
and when she returned, said she had been offended at
something, but thought better of it. Other people
said a young man had a hand in it. In another case, an
actress found her liege kept np another establishment,
with a lady at the head thereof. She went thither, and
the furniture suffered. Again, an opera singer, well-
known in Sydney, has quarrelled with, and separated
from the figurante with whom he lived, and is trying
hard to drink himself to death. One section of the
profession is becoming extremely indecorous “ Zulu”
Thompson played five weeks at Dunedin (N.Z ), to good
houses. Owing to the Gaming and Lotteries Bill in force
there, a new style of distributing the gifts had to be
adopted. “ The new system,” says one of the papers, is
not only acceptable, as obviating that element of chance
whereat the virtuous shudder, but it also prevents the
recurrence of those unfortunate accidents by which
elderly people were presented with toys, and children
with scientific instruments and volumes of moral philo-
sophy. We no longer see aged men passing sadly out
of the pit with a monkey on a stick in their thankless
grasp, or three-year-olds suddenly possessed of furni-

The glories of the operatic stage : American society

and it cold-shouldered La Diva. Sara came here with
her boy ; Patti comes with —Nioolini, The concert at
Brooklyn netted $BOOO simply because the garden scene
from * Faust ’ was sung with stage accessories. After
the concert, Patti (Nicolini by her side) was drawn to
her hotel by a set of supers, paid, as is alleged, by the
enterprising and astute manager. Abbey, the same who
imported the shadow-dancing comedienne from tho
Comddie Franijaise. She was serenaded by a few mem-
bers of the Twenty-third Eegimont, who were invited
to supper for their pains, as previously arranged, and
the warbler, after much coquetting behind the glass,
at last had the window raised and flung a bouquet to
the subsidized crowd.” One of the papers thus chaffs
manager Abbey:—“Tho ‘spontaneous’ enthusiasm
that culminated in a donkey attachment to Patti’s
carriage last evening was laid down in the bills on
Sunday, when it was suggested by the Herald that a
deputation of Brooklynites would be harnessed up in
the service of the prima donna. Abbey is a liberal and
enterprising manager, and he spares no expense, even
for donkeys.” While another newspaper thus pithily
summarises up the result: —“ To sum up. Most of the
gentlemen who attended this first and greatest
concert, last night, said, * Patti is superb-
incomparable.’ Most of the ladies said, ‘Yes, she
is. But —what coukX she see in Nicolini?'”
Says the N.Y. Times of Patti:—“But the highest
praise that may he accorded her should be modified by
the undoubted facts that her voice has lost its freshness
and is no longer of sweet quality, that she often sings
out of tune, that under tho disguise of a tour de force
she attempts to cover up evident vocal difficulties.”
However, it’s alleged that conclusions of this sort con-
ceal the chagrin of one paper because another
paper has had the pick of the Patti “inter.
views.” From an advertisement in an English
theatrical paper :—“ P.S. _ Would , the would-
be comedian, send the pair of Green Tights he
took away with him ? ” Taking all things into con-
sideration, we should say he would, with a polite little
note, and pay the postage When “The Spider’s

A pretty incident is related of the recent successful
d4but of Madame Ugalde, at Paris, in Lecocq’s new
opera, “Le Jour et La Nuit." Just before her call
came she knelt down by the property-room and prayed,
and as she made her entrance she also made the sign of
the cross for good luck. Her prayer was answered and
the good luck came. If some of our crowd were to do
the same, it wouldn’t be a bad line—so long as the root
didn’t fall in? As “The World" is to be produced
here at Easter the following will be of interest. It is
from “Carados” in the Eeferbe:—“Somebody in
Birmingham has been down upon “The World,” which
represents the combined genius of three dramatic
authors. He says it consists of nine acts, made up
principally of infernal machines, chloroform, bine Are,
gunpowder galore, and private lunatic asylums. Of tho
ladies and gentlemen who are brought on to walk about
and rob, swindle, and murder each other, I should not
like to say they make themselves ridiculous, but they
certainly do detract from the solemnity of the stage
carpentry, which at any rate has the merit of being

Somehow he knows my ways. Ha’s a deir fellow, and
I know wo shall be happy, though sometimes I
think regretfully of the enforced abandonment
of the stage and its necessary accessories.”

never been known to “ low,” but ejaculates a " quack
with great facility. This may fairly be chronicled as—

We never omit to do a good turn when it costs
ns nothing, and is not troublesome. We beg, there-
fore, to advise the thirsty, who on the Sawbath yearn
for refreshment, that a square drink is obtainable all
day long at Manly. Nor is the faoility with which
the thorax may be lubriaated the only feature of the
place, for the best outside wash procurable in the
colonies is to be had for fourpence at the delightful
baths, presided over by Lieutenant Ten Hammer. A
trip to Manly by the 10.15 a.m. steamer, a swim at Von
Hammer’s, dinner at the Ivanhoe, and an afternoon on
the rocks, is the best Sunday programme extant,—
except it bo, of course, to go to one of the numerous
churches, where a fellow is taught to hate his neighbour
for the love of God, and to devote his surplus cash to
buying dress-improvers for the South Sea heathen.
We expect to travel on the Manly steamers as dead-
heads in future, and shall be much surprised if we are
asked to pay for liquor in that locality.

Hawkeye, a Sydney lawyer with a big police
court practice, has an awkward habit of looking in at
his office occasionally, just to sea how things are getting
on. Splodger, a late clerk of his, who “ doesn’t like be-
ing tied to'a desk, you know,” often took advantage of
the boss’s absence at “ the Central ” to turn round the
block, and see Belinda at the Metropolitan, or Nelly at
Bunch’s, after having called on Nosey, the bookmaker,
and got another month wherein to pay that fiver so
artlessly dropped over the last Steeplechase. When
the boss came in, Splodger had always “just gone
downstairs, sir.” “Ah ! to be sure, there’s his hat,"
blandly exclaimed lawyer Hawkeye, glancing at a bell-
topper hanging on a nail. This sort ef thing went on
so long, that the boss attorney at length relied on the
hat alone to answer his eternal query. The tile was always
hanging on its accustomed nail. One morning, how-
ever, just after he had lunched fram an overdone chop,
and been ignominiously defeated in a big appeal case,
Hawkeye sat down with a fiendish grin on his aquiline
features and wrote the following note “ Sir, Ino
longer require your services, and therefore give yon a
week’s notice. Oblige me by taking both your hats
with you. Tours truly, Hatchetface Hawkeye.
To Mr. Splodger." # #
He is a Sydney man, rather inclined to the
“ha-ha,” but still he’s not deficient in personal
courage, and he uses his fists very neatly. He was at
Hobart recently, and it fell out that late one particular
evening he was ah, not well, and was tackled by
three larrikins. He stood up as long as he could, but,
although there were times when he could perhaps have
thrashed two such larrikins —all who know him will
readily believe he would have tried to thrash six—he
found that three big hoodlums were more than he could
manage after—ah, dinner. So they thrashed him, brutally
too; and it is now said that the two Tasmanian ex-
quisites who quietly stood by and looked on are in sore
trouble. One of them is to be called to account by his
club for gross cowardice; the other, who was never
expected to fight, will be let ofl more mildly. People
wonder how this could have occurred in a land which is
proverbially the home ef fair women and brave men.

We have received the Christmas number of the
Lismork Chronicle It is a holiday sheet in the
truest acceptation of the term, and we heartily con-
gratulate the Laplander in charge upon the brilliant
journalistic display he has made—his paper, indeed,
completely eclipsing the marvellous efforts of the
wlio dishos up the Parramatta Pergt,
This Lismore paper informs us that “ the Garonne (sic)
has arrived, and the passengers have been lahded at
the cmarrautine (sic) station and all undergo a vigorous
destruction (sic),” We are told then that “ Mr. Green-
wood has been returned for Mudgee electoral (sic) • And,
in an account of the local race-settling, we see that Mr.
Bundook had much pleasure in proposing the health of
those without which we could not have any races and
that was ‘The Loosers’ (sic). He was sorry he was
among the * loosers,’ but hoped to have better luck next
time.” There is a bit of pathos, however, when the
editor states in touching terms that “he inclined to
regard her Majesty as a (sic) afflicted woman who wn
(sic) go down sorrowing to the grava (sic).” It is satis-
factory to learn, however, that the Sydney “ quarran-
teen building has been thoroughly cleand (sic) and
fumigtted (sic) ; ” and the London coble must have
been a source of considerable satisfaction to those
Lismoreites who are interested in the Eastern Question:
—“ The Imperial rescrip (sic) published an address to
the Eussian Ministry, the Emperor strongly ascertains
(sic) a perogative (sic) of the Crown to insist the (sic)
necessity of taking the oaths of allegiance, whereby all
officialy (sic) pledge themselves to abstain from foment-
ing or taking part in any public adjitation (sic).” There
are, perhaps, sceptics who will consider that there are
papers in the world which show a more brilliant style
of paragraphing than the Lismore Chronicle. Per-
haps there are. But, certainly, we never set eyes on a
journal that had more spirit in I*.

“ The Rev. A. C. Gillies ” is, we see, in Dunedin.
We derive this information from the Poet’s Corner of
the Otago Witness, in which is published a poem by
the rev. gentleman, labelled ‘‘The Last Hour of 1831.
Mr. Gillies has a motto from Milton over his verse,
which reads —
“ Lap me in soft Lydian airs,
Married to immortal verse—”
a quotation of the melting modesty of which our
readers will just now have an opportunity of judging.
He is “alone with God” on the last night ot 'Bl, and
thinks of the “ yawning tomb ” —a reflection which
may probably have been suggested to him by a glance
into his shaving-glass while his mouth was open. This
puts him (a fact which by no means surprises us) in a
bad way, for he says :
“ Tho’ tired of life, yet afraid of death,
I trembled from head to heel (!) ;
My hair stood up, and my limbs grew numb.
As tho’ they were made of steel.”
And here was the reason of this strange metamor-
phosis :
“ My joys all dead, my sins all alive,
Were terrible now to see;
The sneers of these and the shades of those
Made Hell real enough for me."
So the “ sneers" of his “ joys ” made hell real enough
for him —an effect, strange to say, which his verse pro-
duces upon us with much exactness. Here, however,
the bard, with singular ingenuousness, gives us a key
to his metrical mystery:—
“ Then to the future I turn’d my eye,
But that was doubtful and dim; ”
after which, we are not surprised te find the poet
saying
“ And now, New Year, may thyself and I
Live in peace, like man and wife.”
There are ten stanzas of this immortal stuff—ten
stanzas 1 And yet we look in vain for an explanatory
footnote saying that the editor of the W itness is away
at a camp-meeting, or on an evangelical visit to some
fellow’s aunt. Now, the Kev. A. C. Gillies sets up to
be, and doubtless is, as brimful of holiness as the world
is of iniquity, and is as certain of an eventual trump
and halo as St. Ezekiel is of a nolle prosequi. Well, all
we can say is if this is the kind of thing in the poetic
line that is inspired by tho divine afflatus of a Gillies,
srive us the Jew’s harp of a Haviland, or tho busted

It ia said that a number of ministers of the
Gospel in Sydney are about to start a club. In this
case, the most fitting name that could be adopted
would be tho Yowl Club.
At the Treasury. Head of Department with
Minister enter an outer-room softly, and behold one
clerk so intent on his work that he is unaware of their
presence. Both gentlemen nod approvingly, and congh
to attract the industrious clerk’s attention. Ha turns
round and jumps up hurriedly, while the chief of the
department takes a sheet of foolscap oS his desk, and
hands it to the Minister, who is much gratified to read
upon it the following
I love you, Martha, ducky.
And you don’t know how I repine,
I will be so unlucky
If you won’t have me for your valentine.
Procrastination is, they say.
The thief for ever of time.
So drop ns a line, Martha, ducky.
And say I’m your valentine.
Pending the reading the author glided out to wash his

The Parramatta Fergt sent an “ our own
correspondent" to Newcastle the other day, and he
begins his letter in this wise“ In a small and gloomy
parlour, in one of the best hotels in Newcastle, I am at
this moment seated.” Of course; but does it not strike
one as being rather unnecessary to say so ? When an
“our own correspondent" writes, he is supposed to
furnish a newsletter, but surely this statement cannot
anyhow be tortured into an item of intelligence. The
apathy with which Perot's pub. par will be received in
Parramatta would only be equalled by the derision with
which they would welcome.an assertion that he was not
in a puh. parlour.

It may be given as an instance of the generosity
of the ladies of Sydney, that the cloak-room women at
the theatres average the large sum of half-a-crown to
every hundred constituents. Most of them have their
cloaks taken off, their flowers pinned on, their galoshes
put away, and their pull-backs repaired, and give no-
thing but “ cheek ”in return. Usually, however, when
a lady does pat down sixpence, she wants a bottle of
lemonade, her children’s hair done, fifteen hair-pins, |
the loan of an opera-glass, and ether little services,
which we will not enter into. It will thus be easily
imagined that the cloak-room attendants are growing
gradually and deliberately wealthy. It would only
require a “ moral and religious drama,” that would
draw the parsons and their wives, to enable them to
retire altogether—to the Poorhouse.

The supporters of Sir George Grey, in Auck-

suspenders. According to present arrangements, some
people in Washington are about to present Guiteau with j
one suspender. It is not a very elevated gift so far as I
the Auckland people are concerned; but it cannot be
denied that with the Americans the elevation will be
considerable. Doubtless, the surprise to Guiteau at
finding himself so up in the world, will be such as to
quite take his breath away.

Pat Molloy’s mother said: “ Childer ain’t like

differently, for it is notorious that many children com-

been boarded out to their “maternal relatives.” Lodgers
under this system aren’t likely to jib on cold mutton,

It ia considered that the late Colonel Anderson,
Commandant of the Victorian forces, should be suc-
ceeded by an English officer. The experience to be
gained of military warfare in Victoria is hardly exciting
enough to prevent the shining lights of colonial
militarism from becoming a little rusty. Recollecting
that at a recent review, held while the lamented Com-
mandant was still at the head of affairs, it was found
impossible for a couple or thousand gallant warriors to
continue their manoeuvres because four small boys and
two nurse girls refused to get out of the way, it cannot
but be admitted that there may be something in the
suggestion about the English officer.

Out of respect for the holiday times we omit all

friend in a style that would bring saltwater tears to the
hardened eye of a packing needle. The Christian-like
nng of the sentiments uttered, the deep pathos of the
but hold on, here it is, in all its melting beauty :—
“ Mr. ——, one of our most respected citizens, has
passed away, the blameless career of his exemplary life
being closed by death at the comparatively early age of
59.” If he had lived till he had scored 60, that journal
would have had two pica columns about his having been
cut off in the flower of his youth, and the editor’s head
next day would have a racket going on inside like that
of a flour-mill working overtime. Of course the
deceased was “ respected by all who knew him,” We
have a hundred-guinea watch to present to the country
corpse that wasn’t. By the way, we expect that that
resident passed away just when he ought to have
renewed the “2 inches for twelve months.” If, how-
ever, the order is not now signed by the corpse, it is
because the country editor couldn’t borrow a galvanic
battery before the arrival of the hearse.

spouse with his boots in one hand and a partly-eaten

There ia a gap in McDonald's Hole called Car-
los, and one Peter Michael O’Eyan recently applied for
permission to start a “ public” in the hopes of waxing
rich, and eventually becoming the proud possessor of
the usual pewter service, or perhaps a scat in Parlia-
ment. The license was, wo read, shelved on the first
application, “ it being proved that the applicant at that
time was a Frenchman, and the objection was that
applicant was unmarried and had been living with a
woman for 14 years.” What he was at the next time of
asking is not clearly shown, but it is supposed he then
hailed from Spitsbergen, Clontarf, or some other bar-
barous region. His cup of misery was slopped into the
saucer when he married the lady and then walked up
just in time to find that the Bench still decided to
refuse his ticket. The license to marry, it seems, was
easier to get than the license to draw the beer tap, but
the honeymoon must have been a novelty in its way for
even a giddy Frenchman.
This reminds us that in a certain township very far
North—on the Hodgkinson—a publican who had been
Platonically boarding and lodging with his barmaid for
seven years took a sudden fit one day, married the girl,
and then, just by way of celebrating the event —for
weddings are rare on the Hodgkinson—for three weeks
after the streets ran with milk and honey, which up
there are called rum and whisky.

Something in the uniform, perhaps.

The following curiosity in thewayof “Notices,”
appears on the front door of the house near Wynyard*
square, which for many years was the private residence
of Canon O’Reilly, who it will be remembered died on
New Year’s Day ;—
“ NOTICE.
“ During the absence of Canon O’Reilly, all appli-
cations with regard to baptisms, marriages, and
funerals, should he made to his locum tenens, the
Rev. E. Shown.”
This is certainly calculated to stagger the most ortho-
dox individual, as well as perplex the greatest sceptic.
The question that ;occurs to an intelligent mind on
the perusal of the foregoing sentence is this—if the
Canon is only absent (and the fact that a locum tenens
occupies his honoured place is, we suppose sufficient
proof that his absence ts merely temporary), then where
in the name of all that is credible is the learned divine
at the present moment P He himself has always been a
disbeliever in Purgatory, so we can scarcely expect that
the Rev. E. Brown’s principal is enjoying the dubious
delights of a half-way house, whose existence he al-
ways emphatically denied. There remain, as cookery
books say, two other ways—but here we pause, for we
tread on tender ground, and can only inform those of
our readers who wish for a solution of the difficulty
that they had better, in a spirit of humble trustful-
ness, telegraphlto “ Bishop Barker, Calvin’s Club House
Hotel, Clapham,” or write to the aforesaid Rev. E.
Brown on the subject.

A Mr. James Hardwick, of Greta, has written
a song. Of this the Newcastle paper says : “ It would
sound to great advantage when sung by a large body of
men in choral unison, accompanied by military instru-
ments, as the blast of trumpets, and the beats of
drums.” We should like to hear this song very much
indeed. If, however, it resembles some of the other
“patriotic” compositions we have heard, we consider
that the introduction of trumpets will be quite un-
necessary. More than a sufficiency of blasts will bo
produced—by the audience.

The Melbourne Evening Mailis a nice little
paper, and is very popular with a certain section of the
Victorian community, because, by its size, it is adapted
to just hold a pound of tea. It is very hard on Sydney,
however, and what makes us a bit uneasy is that if it
goes on writing our metropolis down like this—why—
Sydney will soon cease to be. This ia the last Melbourne
assault upon us; —"Two men were upset in Sydney
harbour last week. While clinging to the bottom of
the boat waiting to be rescued tho one took the oppor-
1 tunity of picking the pocket of the other. And yet we
are told that Sydney people are behind the times.”
Now, we have got the clutch of a little Melbourne
boat-story, before which this small item crumples up in
■ one act. Three Melbourne stockbrokers went fishing
off Queensclifi the other day in a hired boat, and got a
good haul. As it grew dusk each man’s brain began to
work as to how he could manage to get the most fish
i and pay least for the boat. One was taken suddenly
, ill, and on being landed lay down in convulsions on the
■ beach, imploring the others to run for aid. While they
r were gone, he secured all the best fish and made off
' across country. When, after a while, tho others came
: back with a mob of kindly sympathisers and a doctor
I at their heels, they dropped to the state of the case,
) and pushed off with many curses, followed by a shower
i of stones and a ton of contumely. Setting sail they soon
i neared Sandridge, and then again their brows grew
) clouded. There was not much fish in the boat, but they
gloomily divided what there was, and scudded onwards
• in the direction of the land. When within a few hundred
yards, one of the men smartly remembered that his
companion couldn’t swim, so engaging his attention he
drew the plug from out the bottom of the boat, and
* then suddenly unshipping the rudder and letting go the
* main-sheet sprang out of the boat with a cry of triumph
s and started to swim ashore. Yet the price
• of that boat was only 5s., and these were three Mel-
r bourne stockbrokers supposed to be doing a good
3 business. Whoop I

recently, it says:—“Mr. Stincham’s appearance in the
rile of clown was a marked success.” This was enough
to break his heart, and, sad to relate, the next night he
broke his leg. We shouldn’t be surprised to hear, when
“ Mr. Stincham" gets better, that the man who wrote
this broke something.
The march of civilization is proceeding with
rapid strides. A Murrurnndi girl, named Long, has
married a Tiugha Chinaman named Hoy. When a
Chinese girl marries a Kanaka we shall be said, we
suppose, to have arrived at progress’s highest acnffi.
We don’t fancy, somehow, however, that the China girl
will be on. And this is only another proof of the
superior civilization of the Murrurundi maiden 1
“ -ZBgles ” says that long ago Mr. Nash, the then
Secretary for Victorian Railways, gave him a pass to
travel free for ever over the lines of the colony, but he
never needed'it, and he did not know why it was given.
There are three points here which are rather puzzling;
—First, that “ iEgles ” should have ever got such a
pass; second, that he should not know why it was
given; third, and most incomprehensible of all, that ho
never used it 1
Scene : A street in a Southern town. Some lar-
rikins try to “take a rise” out of George, religious
blindman. First larrikin : “Good morning, Georgo. Is
it as hot as this in Heaven ?” George: “Ah, no, mv boy,
everything’s right there. No changes, no work.” 2nd
larrikin: “ Well, is it as hot as this in hell ?” George:
“Oh, yes, brother—you getjalmost anything there, but
rain—it never rains in hell. A rich man once asked for
a drop of water at the end of a finger, but even that
much wasn’t about." Chorus of larrikins: “ We’ll go

and moves on.

A wealthy yokel was inveigled into a church
bazaar up North, the other day, and put into a £1
raffle, presided over by a very pretty young lady. It
turned out that he drew the winning number, and, on
this being explained to him, he immediately made
tracks for the door. “Where are you going ?” cried
the presiding goddess; “ you haven’t taken the prize.”
“ I’m a goin’ to put the horse up,” yelled the yokel.
He thought he had won the girl.
Mr. Warburton, box-office-keeper of the Melb.
Theatre Royal, has been fined ss. for asking a police-
man, who refused to remove a crying baby. “Why the
hell ho didn’t do his duty ?” We think Warburton got
off very easily. What would they do to the miscreant
who asked a down-thebay constable “why he didn’t do
his duty ?” “ Mr, Call said, “ The police must be pro-
tected.” Oh, certainly. Protect the police, by all
means. Never mind the people.
“A gentleman in the Civil service,” says the
Melbourne Herald, “ who has invested in the Bagot
Estate drawing, has made a pledge which does credit to
his generosity. He has determined, if he should win
the prize of £3OOO, to make a donation of £5OO to the
Magdalen Asylum at Abbotsford." We arc not going
to be licked by this. If we pull off Jones’s big sweep on
the Sydney Cup, this is what we shall do: —Establish a
Home for Picnic Policeman who have become short-
sighted through long service ; erect a shot-proof tower,
and present the same to E. Lewis-Scott, in order that
his future safety may be assured; and establish an

Lately, a gentleman was travelling on the rail-
way from Hobart to Launceston, and after proceeding
leisnrely along a few miles, the train stopped more than
half an hour at a small wayside platform. The traveller
asked if there had been any accident. “ Oh, no," was
the reassuring reply; “we have only forgotten a truck
of fish, and the engine has gone back to Hobart to
fetch it up 1” In Tasmania, when a man’s not in a
hurry, he goes by train. When he ia, he walks.
This is the style a Western George Robins
advertises the sale of a well-known station :
“To Squatters, Stud-Breeders, Gentlemen
with Big Families wishing a ‘Run,’
Speculators, et omnes.”
Now, the present proprietor of this very desirable run
has been twice married, but as yet he ia no more a
father than the Pope of Rome is. This is an auctioneer’s
idea of a screaming “ goak."
At a feed given by the late Mr. James Henty to
a lot of boys, an unctuous reverend glided about among
them, saying “ Deah young friends, enjoy what a bene-
ficent Providence gives you; but do not put anything
in your pockets—there is an all-seeing eye,” etc. Not
knowing that the sleek parson had been giving advice,
the jolly host moved around, saying heartily, “ Now,
boys, wire in, and what you can’t eat, put in your
pockets 1” The voice of the church was ignored on
that occasion.
They are—or were—getting up a subscription
to testimonialize a suburban Mayor. The canvasser
called in due course upon a small tradesman, “ What
shall I put you down for ?” asked the raker-in of the
notes of admiration. “ Nothing,” said the tradesman.
“All right,” quoth the other, “just wait till you want
you side-walk mended ’’ Now, when tho
small vendor requires to have the dust laid, he has to
water his part of the road with a quart-pot and a

Infirmary yesterday with a broken knee-cap through
coming to grief near the storekeeper’s doorstep, being
laden at the time with a penn'orth of cheese and a red
herring.
Glen Innea is a rosy sort of place
for inquests. At the conclusion of a
recent inquiry, one of the jurymen was
sent to gaol for 'lB hours, on a charge
of writing poetrylt would be a national
benefit if this principle wore enforced
on poets here; but in the case alluded
to, the coroner seems to have bagged the
wrong man, as it was clearly proved
that the versos were written by tho
corpse and not by the juror. We ne>d
scarcely add that the lines were of the
Don Juan or fleshly school.
We regret to record that the self-
sacrificing labours of our clergy, are
likely to thin the ranks. Among one
section of the colonial cloth 1000 in the
shade and bod Water are doing their
work. When the faithful come to pray
on the Sunday, they don’t get tho
chance of staying for either good or
evil, as the word is passed round that
his Reverence is laid low from a fit of
bilious fayver, and said faithful go their
way solemnly shaking their heads, and
beseeching holy Saint Patrick to give
the poor man one chance more.
Moody, while preaching on hell
and brimstone in ’Frisco the other day,
said: “My grandmother was as nice,
amiable,and good an old lady as ever lived
but she was not a believer, and now I
am sorrowfully convinced she is burning
in the pit.” This infamous impiety
was too much for an Irishman, who
arose, took his hat and went for the
door. “ Halt, young man, ” cried
Moody. “Do you know what you are
doing ? You are walking head'ong to
hell.” Paddy turned, bowed. “ Quite

The man who used to write from
the “Stage Box” in the Australian
Sportsman (which is a journal now
printed by the people who used to
bring out the Protestant Standard,
and devoted to several things) is pre-
sumably dead, for he has been super-
seded by one “ Cegar." Where Cegar
writes from does not appear, but we
should think from his style that he
writes from a hen-roost. None of his
critiques are much longer than the
tenth commandment, and there is not
such a brilliant line as “Thou shalt
not covet thy neighbour’s ass " in any
of them. Ifjjthis were our Cegar, w 3

A Hebrew tobacconist bought a
suit of clothes cheap from a friend of
the same gentle persuasion. He did the
block in the rig, and had a good time
generally. Next morning a customer
came in to buy a box of matches,
holding a handkerchief to his nose, and
carrying a jam tin with lighted sulphur
in his hand. The cigar-man thought
this rather odd, but said nothing. No
one else came that day nor the next.
On the morning after he got an anony-
mous letter, telling him that he had
bought a disinfected suit from a
small-pox-infected house. So he went
out then, put up the shutters, and has
not since been heard of. We believe
this implicitly. It was sent us in a
slightly altered form by another He-
brew.
Just like the North Queensland
nigger police. They professed to have
searched tho whole island for Mrs.
Watson and the Chinaman, yet the dead
body of the latter was found close to
Watson’s house, and bears testimony to
their neglect. They captured a wound-
ed black, who, on the faith of their
officer’s linguistic abilities, and the
credibility of their interpreters, was de-
clared to have been th» murderer of her
who, there is now incontrovertible evi-
dence, was never murdered. The black
man’s trial, says a Cooktown paper,
was short. He was tied to a tree. Lead
and fire were spurted at him by tho
civilised white lambs ; there were a few
clots of blood, a spasmodic quaver, and
a soul was sent shuddering before the
Maker who had made its covering
black, and its earthly language untrans-
lateable.
When the Volunteers were ordered out at tho
recent fire at Goulburn, one well-known townsman was
specially noticed for his skilful efforts to fix his bayonet
in the muzzle of his rifle. When he was asked what he
was going to do with the dangerous weapon, he replied
manfully that ha would “ stick it into anyone that
Captain Blackshaw told him to,” And yet this valiant
warrior is the same man who in a sham-flght lay quietly
sequestered under a log while his comrades sustained
the shock of the enemy’s charge.
*' Man a inhumanity to man.” A poor wretch,
sweltering under heat at 110 degrees, craves a drink of

in revenge for which he sets fire to soma fencing.
Surely the incendiary, in this case, was “ more sinned
against than sinning. The conduct of the man who re-
fused “ the cup of cold water” was simply un-Christian,
and this epithet conveys more reproach than Thady
O’Kane could accumulate in half-a-column, or Pastor
Allen manufacture in a twelvemonth.
One of the brightest stars of the Queen’s Star
Dramatic Company is, we are told, a party by the name
of Professor Frank Warden Lane. Surely this cannot
be our Frank Warden of “Come to the Lamb” and
patent medicine fame! Is it possible that the man who
threatened to stand sword in hand and break things
rather than allow the Garden Palace to be opened on
the lovely Sawbath mom, should have sunk to the
sinful level of John M'Culloch, Booth, or Henry
Irving ? It cannot be. No one would be fool enough
to go to hear him.

In the last issue of the Tumut Times the birth
of “ a pair of twins ’’ is recorded. This can only be
beaten by a recent occurrence at Jackson Town,

mother, Mrs. Hulbert, is a large and strong woman,
and her husband, small and thin. The children weighed

A certain Tasmanian divine, a canon “ of no par-

Mr. Vernon Eeid, tho Ealph Eackstraw of
South’s Company, went out alligator-shooting outside
Brisbane, the other day. The first bullet he tired took
effect in a hideous mass bobbing up and down in the
water. Vernon then went behind a tree, and com-
menced to bombard the gome with bullets at the rate of
two a minute. Having exhausted his ammunition, and
being convinced that by this time the monster must bo
dead, he procured a boat and a rope to tug saurian in
shore. Arrived on the spot, imagine Vernon’s delight
to discover that he had put about 10 lb. weight of vie
best lead into the. carcase of a very fine dead blank-
fellow.
The Protestant Standard, alluding to the
quarrel between the Freeman aud the Express, con-
cludes an editorial blast in these terms :—“ Aye, it is
well to warn Freeman that it will never do in the popish
church to tell the truth, and if tho editors really wrote
to do that, their place is outside her accursed pale.
We also, as well as tho Express, although with
different motives, shall pray for their commis-
sion.” («o.) The warlike hack, though terribly in ear-
nest, is just a wee bit obscure. We ouoe knew a man
wbo wrote very much in this style. When not engaged
in journalism, he used to write proclamations—procla-
mations for a shoe-shop.
A mad dog created a sensation among the mili-
tary at Dawes Point, on- Anniversary Day. Crawling
out of the harbour, he made for the officers’ quarters,
where Colonels, Majors, and Lieutenants were to be
seen making tracks in all directions ; one gallant war-
rior, who would only laugh at a cannon ball or bayonet,
hanging to the roof of the verandah and kicking wildly
at the canine epemy. As the Colonel’s kicks didn’t
“fetch" the dog, a captain shot at him, but without
any marked success, and finally he was lassooed by a
bold Gunner, put in a sack with a portion of the battery,
and consigned to the deep. Then the bravo defenders
of our country breathed again.

This is the season when suburban and country
editors overhaul their dictionaries, take a new nib, and
write lickspittle paragraphs on tho retiring mayors and
aldermeu. It is nauseating to read what is penned of
some of the outgoing nincompoops, who got into
councils by strong lungs and unlimited cheek, and
whose education is such that they find “ it’s aisier to
shpeak than to roito.” If we were to put faith in these
paragraphs, wo would find that some of the mayoral
mudheads bad made the township and all that therein
is, and that in the mayor alone all the inhabitants live
and move and have their being. It is very diverting to
see the literary loafers polishing tho municipal boots.
It is no now story that tho stomachs of cattle
slaughtered in these colonies have been found to con.
tain qnartz richly impregnated with gold, and forth-
with companies have been formed to work the stations
where the animsls were born and bred. This style of
yarn is now altogether eclipsed, for in Tasmania the
other day a whaler was raised on the slip for repairs
when a piece of golden stene was picked out of her fore-
foot. The captain remembered that his ship had been
on shore at Port Davey, and that was sufficient to float
a company upon. In two or three days the prospectors
set out with the skipper, disrated to the rank of mate
in order that he might point out the exact spot where
the ship took the ground.
“ On Sunday morning,” saya the Penny Lyre,

not long ago, that we saw two flercely-whiskered police-
men clank into a private house in Darlinghurst Road

We know that Alfred never inspired this par., because
his haughty nature would scorn such a thing. It is

Says Dr. Barry, in his weekly snarl:—“ln
estimating the character of Henry VIII., we are pre-
pared, for the sake of brevity, to admit all, or nearly

sorry to see in the worthy doctor’s paper a statement
that is calculated to cause no small pain to the des-
cendants of Bluff King Hal. Had the paragraph
appeared in any other journal, doubtless it would have
excited bat little attention. In the Standard, how-
ever, it is different. Circulated largely by means of
the trunkmaker or bookbinder, this item is “bound,”
sooner or later, to reach the shores of Albion; and then
the various crowned heads, who have been bolstering np
the memory of Henry, will see that they are lost indeed.
We don’t expect much charity from any holy man; hat

Scene: Blank-street, in the Island of Flim-Flam.
Time, 2 a.m. One policeman with prisoner (rather
muzzy, but very quiet) meets another policeman on his
way to the lock-up. First policeman: 11 Hullo I what
you got there ? ” Second policeman: “ One for drank.
Good mind to let him go; he seems a quiet fellow.”
First policeman: “ No; give him to me. Haven’t had
a case for two days.” Second policeman; "All right.
But then, a simple ’drunk' won’t do yet." First
policeman: “I know that. (Tears his jacket, knocks
n hole in his helmet with his truncheon, kicks off a
boot-hool, then drags the desperate captive off to the
watch-house). Next morning wo read that the prisoner
was sent up for fifteen years, and the constable was
publicly complimented by the Bench on his courage in
the arrest and his forbearance under the assault. Here
eudeth the first lesson.
A “lady of title” went the other night to see
“ Piuafore,” and took into the room where she and
other “ peeresses, ’’ &c., leave their pnttaus, a cardboard
box, with her name and residence written three times
on the lid. After she had fixed herself np by means of
the penn'orth of pins and a cloudy powder-puff, she
placed the box in a conspicuous position on end, and
then walked to the door to see how it looked. This not
being satisfactory she shifted it again, and then sate
down in the room for ft bit to watch the effect on the
ladies who entered. To be a drunken duchess at a
cricket match is bad enough ; but where a few extra
glasses of fizz amidst a lot of excitement may be par-
doned, we would find it monstrous hard to forgive this
shoddy box-trick. In all probability this lady borrowed
twopence of the cloak-room woman, and then sent her
out to buy a rod-herring,
A young blaok larrikin named Johnson, when
arrested the other day for pelting the “ peelers ” with
rocks, was discovered, when at the look-up, to have
nearly £46 in cash and £4O to his credit in a bank.
This beinur known in the morning, when he paid his
floe of £5, he was the object of much interest and
solicitude in the yard of the Police Court. The lawyers
talked to him in kind and sympathetic voices, and one
even went so far as to hint that his business could be
materially extended If he had a sleeping partner. There
was also a lady present, who kindly offered to provide
him with board in a neighbourhood within easy distance
ef all the principal places of amusement, but he re-
ceive! her offers of hospitality with a levity that was
certainly uncalled for. When last seen, he was journey-
ing up in the direction of Macquarie-street at about
C o’clock, apparently bent on making Government
House at sunset.
There was a “bachelors’ ball” up North the
other day. The following are copies respectively of the
notice posted in front of the hall, and ®f the written
circular issused to invites;— “ JNotise.—A Oaohlor’s ball

How some people will persist in glorying in their
own shame I At a recent Jockey Club dinner at Glen
Innes, the chairman, in proposing the toast of the
“ Press ” remarked upon the general good character of
the Glen Innes newspapers, and said that the literary
matter would compare favourably with that of the
metropolitan journals; in fact, he had noticed the lead-
ing sentiments of the metropolitan press were very
often foreshadowed by the Glen Innes journals. And
so Glen Innes is repousible for the morning and evening
misery which is thrust upon ns. Those ponderous
articles of Granny’s on the spread of the Missionary
Work in Ashantee, Balmain, and other heathen lands—
those startling revelations in the D.T., and those odo.
riferous nightoar pars, in the Noozk, are all fore-
shadowed by the Glen Innes journals I Will some
Ker-rishtyen friend kindly look those Northern editors
up, and expostulate on their heads with the shiny find
of a big American axe.
At a coroner’s inquest the other day, a small
boy, brought up to give evidence, was interrogated as
to the nature of an oath. He didn’t appear to appreciate
the situation, and seemed perfectly indifferent as to
the problematic consequences which are alleged to
follow an irreverence of truth. He said he knew the
Lord’s Prayer, aud on being put to the test, gave of
that simple supplication a rendition which, though
imperfect, was sufficiently correct to meet the approval
of his examiner. But when the latter dived a little
deeper, aud enquired about the welfare of the soul after
one had “shuffled off this mortal coil," the witness was
at sea, aud said if he told a lie he would go to Heaven.
This answer was so at variance with Christian princi-
ples that it was considered necessary to test young
Australia’s belief in a hereafter by asking a more
mundane question, whereupon the following dialogue
ensued: “If you stole a sheep, where would you go f ”
Boy (artlessly): “ Why, to Mr. Wooley’s Sandy Creek
paddock.” He was sworu.
Jack Smith, the genial, erst-while M.P. for
Wellington, was, on the occasion of his first contest for
that electorate, the hero of an adventure. He and his
opponent (Gk M. Stephen, we believe) held a joint
meeting at Tambaroora, where Jack was extremely
unpopular with the miners When ho began to speak—
they were addressing the electors from the balcony of
au hotel—the audience yelled. Jack, warming to bis
work, yelled also. Then a supply of rotten eggs was
procured and Jack was soon bespattered from top to
toe. Still he persevered, and the miners were going for
some rooks, when the other candidate stepped for-
ward, with the amiable intention of securing for his
opponent a hearing. The undaunted Jack, looking
upon this as a fresh outrage, pushed his fellow-oandi-
date back, exclaiming: “Sit down, sirl You stink I “
He had, for the first time, realised the effluvium that
proceeded from the addled yolk which glistened on his
own beard! Jack is such a jolly fellow that our
readers will be glad to learn that he was returned for
Wellington, after all.
Sir Alfred Stephen—the sturdy veteran who
cannot be brought to think about dying so long as a fine
fat pension continues contingent upon bis living—ob-
served recently that he would like to see every drunkard
clothed in yellow, and made to sweep the streets. The
comments of the drunkards upon the proposal would
include some “ Broom’s" commentaries, not to bo
found in the edition studied by Sir Alfred. The idea is
so far apt that it would practically demonstrate the
connection between a drunkard and a “ sweep." But
what says Pastor Allen about the yellow regalia
suggested ? Old friend, bring your historic umbrella
to the “present,” and np at’em all who dare suggest
innovations which would render the general public
unable to tell a tippler from an Orangeman. In the
Clontarf dialect, a drunken man is said to be *• half-
tors." Thus would Sir Alfred fain fulfil the Italian
prophecy—
“ The green shall be wore
And the ‘yellow’ shall be * tore.’ ”
Alderman Joseph Smith, of Parramatta, saya
that the reporters of the local papers are tipped to
report the orations of Aldermen Taylor and Ritchie
but the Evening Fedot dentes it with fiery vehemence!
John says:—“l have no hesitation in characterising
this statement as a deliberate falsehood, and I challenge
the alderman to give a single instance of any reporter
cf a local newspaper receiving a single farthing from
either of the gentlemen named (!!) for any such ser.
vices rendered.” Nobody bourse, will take mp the
gauntlet, but several tongues Will be thrust into several
eheeks, and not a few people will shrug their shoulders
and whistle. No one who thoroughly knows old Fergy
would, in his wildest dreams, deem him capable of ,
taking a tip. Celava sans dire. At the same time, we
cannot but think that John is a bit quixotic in fighting
the battles of his brother pressmen, when they only
seem to retort by bombarding him weekly with enough
mud to make a new Times office. Perhaps, however,
he is getting rich. It he is getting rich, it seems
rather a pity he doesn’t employ a few hands to scour
out his brain-pan. The seat of his pants could be
looked to afterwards.
Mr. E. Newman Scott—salaam, grovellers !
editor of the Parramatta Fxrgt, has been stuck up in
Hyde Park by a desperate bandit and robbed —— of
nothing. Newman stated, in the police court, that he
never carried money about him. Well, wo know several
brilliant authors who are in a similar predicament. We
suppose Newman keeps his gold in a secret cellar
guarded by a dragon ; and when anybody wants any of
it he either says he can't remember just then where the
cellar is, or has lost the key of the dragon.
A good ghost story is told quite innocently by
the Bt. Petersburg correspondent of the S.M. Herald.
He narrates how the ghost of Piddingtonsky's sainted
Czar has appeared at the Cathedral. Of course, the
ghost of a Czar would not condescend to appear at a
mere ordinary church. His Imperial ghostshlp like-
wise disdained to speak to anyone but an Arehbiskop.
When the Metropolitan respectfully accosted the
spectre, with a singular oblivion of the doctrine that
worldly distinctions are not recognised in Heaven,
saying, “ Yonr Majesty, what is your will P" the
apparition, instead of responding as might have been
expected, “ I demand a hundred million roubles addi-
tional taxation to buy some diamond-mounted harps
for some charming young angels whom I have been
graciously pleased to cast favourable eyes upon,”
simply responded, “I am praying for Eussla.” The
venerable Archbishop was so alarmed that he had a
fit, and on recovering sent for the police, convinced
that it couldn't have been the Czar’s ghost, bnt pre-
bably a Nihilist, who offered so extraordinary an expla-
nation of bis proceedings.

the Society, thoui a willing, do not adopt right
measures for the e aconragemont and development of

developing Australian genius very much, being too
mechanical and i itilitariau, and this society seems to
be following in die same groovo. Our correspondent
says the first d( .grading step vui taken when the new
soaiety invited c ompetition in works of wood-engraving,
a branch purely mechanical. Why not, says he, at once
ask Art studen ts tv make a table or a desk f Next, ho
takes exception to tha terms of a circular issued last
month, laying down -conditions that a certain com-
petitive picture matt he Australasian, must be in water-
medium, and of a giv*m size, which is fettering genius,
i urther, that the so oioty threatens not to award the
prize unless the picture Ve suitable for reproduction,

that u Art Is to bo really encouraged, competitors for
pmes should be (entirely unrestricted as to subjects
and materials, witl i but one stipulation,originality.
The writer gives the society credit for having done its
best, but contentis that the aboive shows it Is committing
serious errors. ■

TO THE PUBLIC OP SYDNEY
and
NEW SOUTH WALES.
We beer to inform you that our 12th GREAT SEMI-
ANNUAL DEAPERY SALE has commenced.
These REGULAR PERIODICAL SALES hare now
become so well and favourably known that it might
appear superfluous for us to say anything to recommend
them; but seeing that there has been a very large ac-
cession of population both in the metropolis and
throughout the colony since the time we started this
EXCELLENT SYSTEM (now six years ago, when we
published fully the details of it), we deem it advisable
now to state briefly that these SEMI-ANNUAL SALES,
occurring in February and July in each year, ABE
NOT the ordinary Drapers’ “ Clearing-out at immense
Sacrifice Sales,” generally of old-fashioned, soiled
accumulations, bat SPECIAL EFFORTS for two weeks
at the close of the Summer and Winter Seasons to
reduce a surplusage of BRAN NEW STOCK, consist-
ing principally of HOPSEHOLD DRAPERY, LINEN
GOODS, &o , &c., which, irom various causes, we get
left on hand in our bulk stores. Take MOSQUITO
NETS, as an instance : Last year we sold out our full
sto ik before Christmas, but this season, although these
summer posts have been troublesome enough in the
suburbs, the towns have been comparatively free from
them, and very little protection has been required ;
hence we have a surplus stock of Nets to get rid of. We
could multiply instances bearing upon other Drapery
items, showing how LARGE IMPORTERS OF
GOODS cannot help being overstocked with some
articles. The course usually adopted is to hold them
over to the next summer. WE prefer converting them
into CASH at once, and order FRESH NEW GOODS
to be made for future requirements.
Of course, we have to submit to some loss at the?e
SEMI-ANNUAL SALES, but we recoup it partly by
not having to pay heavy expenses on the dead stock for
(say) six months. As a rule, we mark the SURPLUS
STOCK at these sales a trifle above ENGLISH MANU-
FACTURERS’ COST PRICE, just to cover shipping
charges, and have hitherto had no difficulty in finding
ready buyers to clear the whole lot during the fort-
night.

According to Mr. John F. Mann, a survivor of
Leichhardt’s second-last expedition, the great exp'orer
wai a wretched bnshraau, and a mean man. He used to

hear ! similar reports before.
The latest winner of the “ Marks’ Scholarship”
at the Sydney University, Mr. George M. Colley, son of
Mr. John Colley, J P , of Jamberoo, sailed per Last
tania, on his way to the University of Edinburgh,
whore he will qualify as a doctor.
John Lunn, a Somersetshire man, died tho other
day at Adelong, aged 88. He was familiarly known as
“ The Sergeant," and formed one of the Canadian expedi-
tion seat out when the escape of Napoleon the Great
from Elba raised fears as to after events.
Mr. H. T. C Cos, Launceston correspondent of

possession of his late uncle's property free of all

We frequently read of Mr. Folingaby complet-
ing Victorian commissions, but when is the one en-
trusted to him by N.S.W. nearly three years ago, to be
finished? And does Mr. Folingsby intend to visit
the Cape, to obtain another sitting from Sir Hercules ?
The remains of Mr. Lowe, of Victoria, have been
found by Mr. Brockman, thirty miles from where they
parted company last November, while searching for
fertile country near Gascoigne, W.A. The body was
perfectly nude, the deceased’s clothes lying beside his
.remains.
The Victorian Government has at last filled np
£he vacant Agent-Generalship by a judicious andappro-
Jriate selection, the genial and versatile “ Murray"
aring, after a little graceful coying and coquetting.
bashfully said “yea”—” Saying ho would ne’er consent
-■-consented.”
Dr. Archibald Clinton Robertson, who arrived
at Gladstone (Q.), in 1553. has died at Rockhampton at
the age of 63, after an illness of only three davs. He
was a fins, manly old gentleman, who, in Central Queens-
land, enjoyed an almost unbounded popularity, and is
deeply regretted.
One of the articles of agreement made with
Oscar Wylde ly the American who takes him on a
lecturing tour is that he is to accept no invitations
daring his stay in the States. Artful manager ! “ See
him for nawthen 1 Guess not. Too thin 1 ” D’Oyley
Carte is to run the show.
G. H. S. Searcy, the well-known amateur
Cricketer, recently sentenced to two years’ gaol fer
embezzlement at Melbourne, wav only married a year
ago. He had £409,000 per annum passing through his
hands, and received, np to the time of his “falling
away,” the munificent salary of £275 a year.
Mr. Henry Nottidge Moseley. M.A., who, was
second to Sir Wyville Thompson of the scientific staff
of H.M.B. Chal'enger in her voyage round the
world, and visited Sydaey in 1863, has been elected to
the Linacra Professorship of Physiology at Oxford,
vacated by the daath of Professor Rollestoa.
Thus a New Zealand) journal“ Sir Henry
Parkes, in responding recently t-> the toast of ‘ Our
Guest,’ used the pronoun ‘l’ 158 lime-i. Ho com-
menced his remarks by saying; * I fed, and I am sure I
speak sincerely, that the g implimeut yon have paid me
is far eyond any possible merit to which I can lay
claim.’ **
Mr. James Redmond, of the Tvroonnel and
Lizzie Redmond claims, Hodgkinson, N.Q., is now in
Sydney, en route for Europe. Mr. Redmond is one of
the most successful of the Far Northern reefers, has
made a huge fortune out of his two splendid claims,
and has from time to time visited Sydney to sell his
gold at the Mint.
“Onida” has written a play dealing with
Roman society of various kinds. She introduces names
and personalities with American freedom. It is doubt-
ful whether the piece will be put on the stage, as,
amongst other difficulties, a young lady has to oatoh
fire, and the fire has to be extinguished as a necessary
port of the action.
More barristers. Mr. Augustus Nash, graduate
of Trinity College, Oxford, who was called to the
English Bar in Easter Term, 1876; and Mr Frederick
Thomas Fraser, of the Inner Temple, admitted to the
English Bar on the 3rd July, 1878, were, ou Tuesday
last, ou the motion of M-. Julian Salomons, Q.C., ad-
mitted to thq bar of N S.W.
At a public meeting to start a memorial to
Dean Stanley, a working man, named Gardener, made
an excellent speech, which s > pleased the Prince of
Wales that he afterwards shook hands with the “ cor-
numanoui" orator. Some of our magnates go about
gloomy with faces since they heard of this : they have
only shaken hands with the sons.
Jenny Lind-Qoldschrnidt, the once famous singer,
has a pleasant homo in Kensington, and retaining warm
memories of America, has kindly welcomed and advised
the young American singers who have sought her ont.
She is sixty years old, hut does not look to be fifty, her
hair being but slightly touched with gray, her eyes still
bright and happy, aid her figure still graceful.
The marriage of Prince Leopold will bo cele-
brated at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, either during
the last ten days of March, or during the first fortnight
of May. The arrangements respecting the ceremony
will be precisely similar to those at the wedding of the
Duke of Connaught. The Duke and Duchess of Albany
will reside permanently at Claremont after their mar-
riage.
Thomas Edgar Oscar Farley, who died in the
Melbourne Hospital recently, is supposed to be iden-
tical with Thomas Edgar O’Flaharty, who figures in
Irish history as one of the political party known as the
** Pope’s Brass Band.” He was worth £lO,OOO. If the
supposition be correct, he fled from Ireland in 1854,
leaving Wills in circulation, some of them forgeries, to
the amount of £15.000.
In some Amerioan States it is the custom to keep
in solitary confinement for three months or more, prior
to their execution, criminals under sentence
of death. This may account, for tho delay in hlrngiag
up Mr. Gniteau. Prom our files we notice that a Mrs.
Meaker, of Waterbary, Vermont, convicted of poison-
ing a half-sister of her husband, was being treated
according to the custom mentioned.
The Earl of Donoughmore, who some years ago
married Miss Stephen*-, a Tasmanian belle, is safe back
in England from hia hunting tour in Wyoming. Colo-
rado. and Utah. The newspaper from which we get
this information also tells us that “ Lord Mavo, who is
decidedly en delicatesse with his Kildare tenantry, will
not bunt in Ireland this winter.” In other words,
Lord Mayo likes to be hunter and not huntee.
Fred Archer, the eminent English jockey, was,
when the mail left, about to be married to the eldest
daughter of Mr. John Dawson, of Newmarket, and had
already received several handsome wedding presents,
including one of Peters’s two hundred guinea broug-
hams. Apropos of wedding presents, Mr. H. Hanger-
ford gave Fred Webb carte blanche to furnish his draw-
ing-room at that gentleman’s cost on the occasion of
his marriage.
“Archbishop Vaughan has been registered for
the celebration of marriages.” Now, we wonder who
is the wig so big that no ono less than the Archbishop
can “splice" him! By the bye, the late Bishop
O’Quinn, of Brisbane, was also registered for the
celebration of marriages, and subsequently was hauled
up at the police court, and fiaed for wilfully neglect-
ing to duly register a marriage of no less a personage
than a premier.
The other day, at Ipswich (Q.) hospital, a
patient named Ernest Jones, who suffered from chronic
disease of the knee-joint, had his leg amputated by Drs.
Webb and Macartney, but he was in such a low state
that he did not long survive tho operation. As a dernier
resort, transfusion of blood was tried. Dr. Macartney
allowing about twenty ounces of hia own blood to be
injected into the patient’s veins. be good
grit in Dr. Macartney.
The departure of Sir A. Gordon from New Zea-
land practically stands postponed indefinitely, in conse-
quence of certain communications received by His Ex-
cellency from the Imperial authorities. It is be-
lieved that it has been found that there is no eligible
opening just at the present time for the utilisation of
Sir Arthur's abilities in tho service of his country, and
that he will therefore sojonrn some time longer in tho
uncongenial political atmosphere of New Zealand.
—Ahem 1
The name of the Post-office at Lower Herbert
(N.Q ), has bean changed to Ingham. This is to com-
memorate the name of the intrepid Mr. W. B logham,
who, with his companions, were murdered and eaten by
the cannibals of Brooker Island, off the coast of New
Guinea, whither they went in the little steamer Voura,
which it will bo remembered by Northerners, used,
under the name of the Louisa, to trade up the Barron
River, between Cairnv and Smithfield, when the Hodg-
kinson was first opened.
Lord Clanwilliam’s Detached Squadron broke
up in January. The Bacchante was to return home
through tho Susez Canal, while tho Admiral, with the
other ships, have t« go bask round the Cape. The
announcements that have appeared respecting the
future of the young Princes are altogether speculative,
but Truth believes it is settled that, after a short term
of military education. Prince Albert Victor will pass a
year at each of the Universit.es, and will, besides,
spend some time in Germany.
It will be remembered that Baxter, a companion
of Eyre in his memorable journey from South to
Western Australia, 40 years ago, was murdered by
native boys near Eyre's land patch, on the Western Aus-
tralian telegraph line. His remains have now been dis-
covered. The natives last week brought in the skeleton
to a line-repairer in a marvellous state of preservation ;
also several articles of European manufacture, inclu-
ding the gnn with which it is believed the murder was
committed. No mention is mads of any papers.
• An American paper talks of Oscar Wylde, who
recently hinted at a lecturing tour, as “ a sickly, senti-
mental, unmanly chap, who will disgust real men, and
who only comes for the lucre.” Of Mrs. Langtry, as
an actress, the same paper says: “ Her sole reliance is
on her beauty, but there are thousands and thousands
of women in the States who excel her in face and form.”
Possibly, but the American has made a slight mistake :
it isn’t her face, but her grace, that mikes Mrs. Langtry
beautiful, and earned her the title of " the Lily."
A little while since, a distinguished politician
departed trom these shores, leaving many friends who
had given him credit —but here we stop, and branch off.
A few years ago he sent home some children to be edu-
cated. The teachers also gave him credit, and now a
letter follows the politician, the upshot of which will
be that when he puts his foot on Albion’s shore he will
find a friend ready to extend his hand—with an oblong
slip of paper in it. The big man will on his side offer
his hand—we'mean his note-of-hand—and then "the
Education Bill ” will pass.
Major-General Edward Tobias Willoughby Pur-
cell, R.A., who died at Clifton on the 9th December,
was present, with Majors Richardson and Warded,
with the thrae batteries of Royal Artillery under
Colonel M’Crea, in the revolution which upset the
Emperor Faustin in Hayti, in 1859, and he landed and
protected the Europeans at Port-au-Prince, and curried
off the Emparor. From May, 1832, to May, 1863, he
acted as Assistant Military Secretary to General Sir
Trevor Chute during the New Zealand war, and after-
wards commanded the detachment of the Royal Artil-
lery in Sydney.
The Rev. Dr. Ellia dislikes a National system
of Education in which the Church gives no religious
instruction, and said so in the pulpit of the Cathedral.
The Australian Churchman dislikes the committee
which undertakes to arrange for religious instruction
in the Public Schools, and *o publishes the sermon of
Dr. Ellis, which inadvertently misrepresented the oon-
mittee’s work. The Rev. Evelyn Hodgson, secretary,
and chief spirit of the committee, dislikes the Aus-
tralian Churchman wilfully circulating what Dp. Ellis,
through ignorance, stated. Result of this triangular
combination of dislikes—an intended action for libel;
damages to go to fnnds of the Religious Education
Committee. Action, Quixotic—damages, nil.
The wives of some of Gambatta’s new Ministers
in Paris had strange histories. One of them, lately
oa'led upon to mix with aristocratic society, was a
hospital nurse. Her patient wa« not an important
person then, and probably did not know when he
married his nnrse that he would be a Minister of
France. Madame Kouvier is a poet and novelist,
who. when young, beaatful and clever, astonished
every ono by marrying an uncouth, uncleanly, and half-
crazy ex-abbd. M. Rouvier, the second husband of this
eccentric lady, is by no means polished in manner?, and
it is considered creditable to his wife’s drilling in
deportment that he can now enter or leave a room
without exciting special remark by his awkwardness
Madame Allain Targe, who is handsome and clover, is
the daughter of one said to have been the wittiest and
ugliest man in France.
Bishop Barker has quite a way of his own of
tasking for leave. Last time he applied for one year and
took two ; having returned to the colony for a year, he
unfortunately fell ill, and again applied for ono yenr,
which expires next month. It is now said, however, that
His Lordship will stay on for a second year I 'the arith-
metic of the position is this: Five years at £2OOO per
annum gives £lO,OOO for one year's work. Now, having
demonstrated that we only require the services of a
bishop once every half decade, would it not be well to
do away with the permanent offije, and every five years
engage whit the Rev. B. G. Hodgson, at the last
Diocesan Synod, termed “A loose bishop," say at
£2300 for twelve menths. The church would thus save,
in one item alone, £BOOO, or in a decade £16,000. That
able manager, Mr. Shepherd Smith, would certainly
consider this good financing.
Colonel Angelo, commandant of the Tasmanian
Volunteers, is a retired Indiau officer, with a stature, to
use an American phrase, of about five feet and a chew
of tobacco. Though the gallant officer has earned his
pension, ho has still a jaunty dapper air, and whiskers
which are quite too awfully black. He invited Admiral
Aslanbegoff's opinion on the Queen’s Battery the other
day, w>.en the astute Russian said, “It is a very fine
work, but why do you construct these batteries ?
Whom do you fear ? ” Tho Commandant, who, by the
way, affects psalm-smiting, was nonplussed, but after a
moment’s hesitation, he replied, ‘‘ Oh—ab—oh, the
Americans.” Retorted the Admiral, with a merry
twinkle in his eye, “ Oh, no! don’t yon believe it; the
Americans would never come here to trouble you.
These gnus must be for somebody else.” Angelo has
never be n easy in his mind since.
The following annuities are granted by the
British Parliament to th<s Royal Family, irrespective of
indirect revenues which they obtain from numerous
other sources, such as estates, offices, Ac. The
Quean, for her privy purse (inaddition to official salary),
£60.000. Albeit, Prince of Wale?, £40,000. Alfred,
Duke of Edinburgh, £15,000 til his marriage; then
£25,000 to help to pay for Alexandrovna’s dresses.
Arthur, Duke of Connaught, the same. Leopold
£l5 000, which Gladstone will ask to have increased to
£25,000, as soon as Leo is united to the young lady from
Waldeck-Pyrmont. Victoria, Princess Royal, received
£BjCO a year upon marriage. Helena and Louisa, £6OOO
each. Beatrice is not an annuitant yet, pending the
arrival of a wooer, but when he comes she will be treated
*he same as her sisters. Duchess of Teck gets £5OOO.
Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz £3OOO, Duke of
Cambridge £12,000, and the Duchess. £6ooo—the last
annuity having now been running for 39 years.
Tawhiao, the Maori king, is a man slightly
above the middle height, with sharp, tatooed features,
and oblique vision. He walks erect, and his motions
are easy and dignified. When dressed in European
attire he would not be distinguished at a distance from
au ordinary English gentleman. His fatner, Te Whero
Whero, who had been one of the most ferocious and
bloodthirsty savages in the world, astonished everybody
at Government House by his calm, dignified, and benign
aspect. He had exchanged the blanket for evening
costume. Tu Tawhiao, the eldest son of the Maori
King, is really n fine-looking young fellow, of light com-
plexion, tall, graceful, and winning in his manners. In
fact, when some two or three years ago he made a tour
of the Wauato townships, and attended fetes and balls
given in his honour, many of the young ladies fell in
love with “the prince. ’’ and wanted to exchange the
comforts of civilization for the gipsy life of the Maoris.
Love in a cottage is bad enough ; bat love in a whare is
a kind of existence that is better imagined than de-
scribed.
The populah precentah of St. Andrew’s Cathe-
dral is certainly a remarkable man. To him, like the
empty stomach in the German proverb, nothing comes
amiss. He can denounce Dissenters as heretical, and
yet praise Wesley; he can ridicule the claims of the
Pope, and yet land the priesthood in their policy; he
can lay himself open to a charge of declaring that the
Sydney ladies are ont of the moral world (in fact, only
fit for the demi-monde), yet revel in the socut/ of the
curled fascinators of Darling Point; he can affirm
(from tho pulpit, ahem!) that strict and propir cleri-
calism is the only cure for tho ills of the present day,
yet can sing at a sixth-rate concert for a—well, not
first-rate—rowing club, “ The Pilgrim of Love.” There
is, of coarse, no harm in Dr. Ellis singing wherever he
chooses, bat this may fairly'be aske 1 of him : is he the
man, considering hie chameleonic appearances in public,
who ought to openly bespatter the names of men who
did good service for the church and the poor in Sydney,
before he was old enough to enjoy the luxuries of a
nursery ?
The new Governor of Tasmania is a widower,
and when reproached by certain designing matrons for
not providing a lady to help to dispense hospitality, ha
replied, “I have iust buried one wife; give me time,
and I will get another.” The girls have taken the hint,
and His Excellency, in undertaking to hand round tea
to the fair ones who throng to his “at homes,” finds
his task by no means a light one. Sir George has de-
clared himself to be the inveterate foe of those who
promote class distinctions in the little colony, and says
he has no sympathy with the would-be exclusive ex-
quisites who presume to give a tone to colonial society.
Everyb dy would like HisExce.leucy.if hedidnothave
colonial champagne in his cellar. Alter the hall given
before regatta night, nothing but Dr. L. L.’s decoction
was obtainable, and consequently there wore mote
headaches in Hobart next morning than there had ever
been before. When Sir George was passing through
Melbourne, some ardent protectionist “got at” him,
and he laid in a stock of “ fizz ** which could not have
been according to sample.
The Rev. J. E. Tenison- Woods tells a yarn
about meeting a tribe of aboriginals up Cooktown way,
which reads well enough till one tomes to the intro-
duction of whisky. Hia Reverence pretends that the
niggers didn’t like the spirit. This casts an air of
suspicion over the entire narrative.

The Victorian jockey, Williams, who is most unfortu-
nate, got a nasty spill when riding in the Hurdles.
. Finding that Segonhoe was growing very fast,
and believing that it would interfere wiih his future
prospects if persevered with for his Autumn engage-
ments, Mr. Fonnelly decided to scratch him for the
V.K.C. Autumn meeting. Navigator will thereby have
a big chance of scooping in the great two-year-old
pools.
Mr. Roberts, the well-known and enthusiastic
Campbelltown sportsman, lost two valuable hounde
lately at coursing. One, in the eagerness of the chase
after a “ knowing puss," dashed his head against a tree
and scattered his brains around; the other impaled
himself from shoulder to flank on a sapling stake lying
on the ground.
The race in light skiffs on Saturday, between
N. M’Donald, of the Clarence, and W. Beach, the
•• Shoalhaven man," for £4O, over the champion course
on the Parramatta River, resulted in an easy victory
for Beach. M'Donald was the favourite. Beach took
the lead at the start, and played with his opponent.
Time, 27 min. 30 sec.
Mr. Robert Campbell has offered a cup, value
100 guineas, for five years, to be run for in connection
with the Autumn meetings of the Christchurch and
Dunedin clubs alternately. “Augur," of the Austral-
asian, says that the winner of the next Sydney Cup
will be found amongst Royal Maid, Trovallyn, Gunild,
Sweet William, Koh-i-noor, and Etna.
George Giffen, who is in the S.A. Civil Service,
gets twelve months’ leave without pay. Of course,
when he returns, covered with trophies, his cheque for
the twelve months’ arrears will bo handed to him by a
grateful and repentant Government. That’s the nice
stylo in which the Victorian and N.S.W. Governments
dealt with the first Australian Eleven.
After the Auckland regatta, Albert White ac-
companies Carter on atrip to this colony. We shall
then have the double satisfaction of seeing White row,
and finding out who Carter is. We notice in late files
that Carter’s mate, Floyd, also of Sydney (who is he ?)
is going south to arrange a match between Messenger
and Hearn. Why doesn’t Messenger tackle Carter ?
Mr. Peter Tburban, of Cooma, lately for a wager
rode a grey horse belonging to a shearer, in the pre-
sence of a hundred people at Cooma Creek. The horse
was a terrific buck-jumper, and Mr. (Thurban’s legs
tore the sand several times, but the horse failed to
shift the rider from the saddle. Mr. Thurban will back
himself to ride any horse that can be brought to him.
At the August meeting of the V.A.T.C. there
will be a Hurdle lEaoe and a Hunters’ Race, over the
Steeplechase Course, reserved for amateur riders. Two
gentlemen have signified their intention of giving gold
cups to be competed for of the value of 50 and 100
guineas respectively; and the members of the Sydney
and Adelaide hunt clubs are to be invited to take part.
Mr. S. Franck, now that he has been acquitted
by the Geelong bench of the charge made against him
under the Gambling Act, is likely to introduce his
totalisator at all the race meetings. He will doubtless
find obstacles at such places, and the Sydney and Mel-
bourne benches may not interpret the law as per Gee-
long. However, big., go’in for it: you have our best
wishes.
The new Grand-stand on the Association Cricket
Ground will be finished for the Intercolonial mrtch.
There is only one thing needed now to make the ground
the bast, perhaps, in the world, and that is a good
approach to it. Surely the Corporation might improve
the present dust-track, which serves as a road, seeing
that during the next month many thousand citizens
will use it.
The Our Boys, in the match for the Junior Cup,
defeated the Oxford Club by an innings and 81 runs.
The Clio and Oriental Clubs commenced their match,
and the former had alead of 17 runs in the first innings,
the scores being Oriental 44, Olio 61, but in the second
innings the lattericlnb lost five wickets for 9 runs, so
that it is quite on the cards that the “ lads ” will score
another win.
Mr. Frank Hill ia to be commended for hia
prompt action in endeavouring to find colonial backers
for Trickett against Hanlan. We are informed that he
has received liberal responses to his appeal, and if
Hanlan really means business, it is likely that he will
be accommodated. Whether Trickett win or lose, he
will have some consolation in knowing that in spite of
his previous reverses he has still some friends in his
native land.
Mr. Robert Cumming’s (Tasmania) yacht Madge
is the fastest craft that has ever cleft the waters of the
broad Derwent. She was built upon the lines and
drawings of the celebrated English ten-tonner whose
name she bears, and though slightly smaller, is said to
be in other respects an exact counterpart of the old
country crack. The principle to which success in these
boats is attributed lias in the extraordinary depth and
weight of keel. Mr. Gumming’s little beauty is indeed
a wonder, and those who had never seen her go to
windward until the last Hobart Regatta, were surprised
at her performances. “ Jack ” Want was over in Tas-
mania, and expressed his unqualified admiration of the
Madge. Like a good many other lovers of sport, ho
wishes to see the Tasmanians try conclusions with some
of the smaller yachts in Sydney harbour.
The Albert-Carlton match for the Holdsworth-
Gardyne Cap was concluded on Wednesday week, when
the Carltons won by 128 runs. Geary and Wearne
bowled splendidly, the former succeeding in clean
bowling Murdoch, D. Gregory, and Gilfillau, while
Smith, after a good innings for 16, fell a victim to him
for l.b.w. Massio was well caught at short-leg by Hay-
man. The Alberta, be it said to their credit, played
after time to finish the match. The innings closed for
a total of 191.
At the continuation of the Holds worth-Gardyno
Cup match, on Saturday, between the Carlton and Uni-
versity Clubs, the latter increased their score to 346
runs. Metcalfe played a splendid hitting innings for 69
—one of the features of it being a fine square-leg hit
into the grand-stand enclosure for 5. Coates played in
his old stylo for 45, Powell rattled up 43 in a brilliant
manner, and Faithfull contributed 28 by soma fair hit-
ting. The Carltons lost four wickets for 102; Garrett
found the way to A. Bannerman’s stumps. C. Banner-
man was well caught by Wilkinson at short-leg. Davis
played splendid cricket for his 36. The Carltons are
evidently out of it this time.
The result of the match between the Petersham
and Osborne clubs, at Petersham, on Saturday last, is
a sure index of the difference of the cricket played in
the senior and junior Gap matches. The Osborne Club
is, perhaps, one of the best clubs engaged in the con-
test for the Thomson Cup, and the Petersham Club
is, as yet, invincible in the Gardiner Cup contests.
The Osborne made onlv 3S runs, and the Petersham
lost four wickets for 148: E. Seale (not out), 81, Marr
37, Farnsworth 18. The Osborne players should not be
down-hearted, as the Petersham Club has, on its own
ground, defeated both the University and Warwick
Clubs. Although beaten, they are in good company.
The one-mile walking match, between young
Murphy, of Melbourne, and young Frank, of Sydney,
for £5O, came off on Saturday at the Melbourne Hippo-
drome; and resulted in a victory for Murphy, who
covered the distance in 7 min. 42 sec. Murphy was in
splendid condition, but Frank was all to pieces, although
even in his best form bo is hardly a match for Murphy,
wbo, it is said, can beat his performance in this match.
Frank’s father makes a serious mistake in turning so
young a lad into a professional walker, and should drop
the business. The youngster is no phenomenon. There
are, doubtless, scores of lads who could boat him,
though there are very few whoso parents would lot
them try.
Mr. Henry Perkins, the secretary of the Mary-
lebona C.C., is noting as the representative of the
Australian Eleven in England, and has succeeded in
fixing a splendid programme of matches for the Austra-
liana. The list consists of 22 eleven a-side contests,
and comprises matches against all the leading counties,
the’Varsities, the Gentlemen, the Players, and last, but
not least, agairst All England. The many matches
against outside eighteons and twenty-twos, which were
played by both the previous Australian Elevens, are
conspicuous by their absence from Mr. Perkins' pro*
gramme, which should prove a good test of the respec-
tive merit of English and Australian cricket. Great
interest will ho centred in the doings of “our boys’’
at home, and when they meet the representative teams
of England at the “Oval," may the verdict be Aus-
tralia 1, England 2.
The Victorian team of orioketera arrived on
Thursday morning, the 2nd instant, and wore accorded
a hearty reception by the N.B. W. C.A. They have been
assiduously practising on the Association Ground, and
display good form. The team has been weakened
through Edwards’ inability to come, and as our team
will probably be the strongest we ever put into the
field, it looks before the play to be a moral for N.S.
Wales. Murdoch fielded as substitute for the Carltons
on Saturday, and many who did not recognize the well-
built frame of the champion cricketer wanted to know
who was the new and brilliant field. By-the-byo, the
University, who neither “give nor take," must have
Ven certain of a victory when they allowed Murdoch
to field for W. Nunn. The Victorians are looking
well; Palmer, Percy M’Dona'dl, and M'Shane haveput
some weight on, and genial Jack Blackham is as
sprightly as ever. Generally, the team have a juvenile
appearance. They are confident of victory.
At Dewridge’s Athletic Hall, George-street,
Brisbane, on the evening of January 28, Shaw, of
South Brisbane, the well-known wrestler, and Don-
nelly, better known in Sydney as Jem Davis, engaged
in a glove fight, under Qtieensberry rules, for a prize of
£lO. Shaw is a man of over 6 ft. in height, and about
13 st. weight, apparently 34 years of age, and is un-
doubtedly a good man, having beaten several well known
men in various parts of Queensland. Donnelly is 24
years of age, height about 5 ft. 10 in , and 11 st. 4 lb. in
weight; he is a pupil of Larry Foley’s, and has had a
few glove encounters both in Sydney and Newcastle.
Donnelly had all the better of the encounter from the
very start. His opponent got in the long run a severe
thrashing, and at the end of the hour bled profusely
and was very weak. The referees at once decided in
favour of Donnelly. Shaw appeared to be very deter-
mined for the first four rounds, after which he showed
signs of a falling off, and towards the end of the en-
counter was evidently exhausted. Donnelly, in the
first four rounds, seemed much the weaker man, and
received most of the hitting, after which ha had learned
the tactics of his man, and had him completely under
his control till the end of the contest.
The Anniversary Regatta at Hobart, on the
24th ult., was one of the most successful ever held.
H.M S. Emerald was the flagship, and fine weather came
to cap almost perfect arrangements. Thera were about
.20,000 people on the ground. In the Ladies’Purse, the
Hobart crew rowed right away from the Launceston
representatives, thus bearing out the anticipations of
the talent, who openly declared that in Watchom,
Stuart, Sharlnnd, and Pearce, the South had an irresis-
tible force of muscle and skill. There were several
other four-oared races, the finishes of which were all
close. The best sport of the day was that afforded by
the sailing races, four of which were started about the
same time. The winning yacht was the Neva, though
the now celebrated Madge was first across the line. The
Neva was splendidly handled, and found the land breeze
most favourable for her. The Launceston yacht, Siren, |
from which much was expected, was fourth. The May
Queen once more carried away the barge race, and a
very fine tussle ensued between the deep-sea fishing
boats. The course on the Derwent is probably un-
equalled in the world, for an uninterrupted view of
nearly ten miles of water is obtainable from the high
ground of the Domain, every knoll of which
is as serviceable to onlookers as the hill is to the
crowd on the Melbourne racecourse. With these
natural advantages, a large maritime interest, and
plenty of bone and muscle, it is not surprising that the
regatta in Hobart is looked upon by residents as the
event of the year, and regarded by visitors as a series of
aquatic contests seldom excelled in any part of the
world.
Says a Gympie paper ;— “ Pugilism —One of
thoso disgusting exhibitions termed prize fights, took
place, we are given to understand, across the river
yesterday, between a couple of misguided men, whose
only ambition is that of obtaining a little notoriety, at
the expense of punishing one another. From what we
can learn the fight was for £5O aside. Early in the
morning, the principals with their seconds met, and
for half-an-hour pummelled one another in fine style. At
the end of the sixteenth round, however, one of the
combatants received a blow in the pit of the stomach,
which, probably through the rupture of some vessel
inside, caused him to spit blood, and rendered him un-
able to come up to time, consequently his opponent,
who was much battered about the face, and is thought
to have received some internal injury, was declared the
winner of the stakes." Now this reads first-rate—just
as well, in fact, as if not one newspaper man had been
on the spot, clutching the bottle aud sponge and lead-
ing the pugs to their corners after each round. “ Dis-
gusting exhibition" is good; so is “ we are given to un-
deretaud," and “ from what wo can learn the fight was
for £5O aside." Then the pious journalist goes on to
say, that the matter is in the hands of the police, and
to talk about “wholesome lessons," “mistaken leni-
ency," and “ young fellows who think it a proof of
manliness to degrade themselves below the level of
brute beasts.” A word in your ear, Gympie suibe.
Newspapers that don’t want to encourage the ring
shouldn’t report fights. It’s all very well to say, when
a man gets knocked over the nose in the sixteenth
round, that he “spat blood through the rupture of an
internal vessel," and that “ it is thought his opponent j
received some internal injury." This frightens the 1
timid Ker-ristian, who, when you smack one of his
cheeks, tarns the other towards 'yon; but the healthy
young heathen, who hits out straight from the shoul-
der, and got up early to see the light, only laughs at
the little artifices of newspaper men who’d like to para-
graph each round, but daren’t do so for fear of the
snufflebusters.

Three gallant officers of the mercantile marine
service went out for a sail in the harbour on Anniver-
sary Day. Unfortunately, they were upset; but
being daunted, they hired another boat of superior
qualities'. Confident of the improbability of another
similar mishap, they put their uniform on, and, in u »
bright resplendence of edit buttons, sought to dazzle
the eyes of the female portion of a picnic party at
Kirribilli. Their boat gave a lurch, but, profiting 1 y
their previous sad experience, they threw themselves
over the gunwale. The boat then righted itself and
sailed away, leaving the discomfited heroes to be rescued
by the picnic party.
For one of “ the cloth” this is good. Mon-
signor Campello, the Italian priest who recently went
over to the Methodist band, was waited on by 1 is
Vicar, Monsignor Appolloni, who said : “ Monsignor, t
learn from a Protestant that you aro about to join
their communion, and that they have arranged a mat eh
for you with a wealthy young lady, and will dont'e
your present income.’’ The suddenness of the atto k
so flabbergasted the giddy Campello that he denied t ''e
soft impeachment, and, after the Spanish fashion,
answered one query by asking another. What he said
was this: “Monsignor Appolloni, what would you
answer were I to tell yon I have learnt you are about to
become a Turk and start a harem?” “My son,” re-
plied the good Vicar, ” I should answer that I am far
too old.”

Won’t my comrades envy me I ”
Straightway went the sportive Hadden
With his loaded gun in hand;
And, the first of all the sportsmen,
'Tween the traps he took his stand s
** Stand beside me, Willie Hillier,
Stand beside me, friend, I pray.
That you may confirm the marvels
I intend to do to-day 1 ’’
So they stood together closely.
Smiling in each other’s face ;
While the sounds of many whispers
Seemed to steal abont the place.
“ ’Tarnal death I —the traps are open.
And the birds will shortly fly 1"
Cried the much-excited Hadden,
And his comrade wink’d his eye.
For ho Baw a hardened sinner
Let an old hen from the trap ;
And she look’d around and cackled.
As she gave her wings a flap 1
Hadden’s gun went to his shoulder.
Nervously ho closed his eyes;—
“ Pull the trigger! ’’—and he palled it.
Aiming blindly at the skies I
Then the people longed to giggle.
But they smother’d the desire.
And exclaimed, “ A foul shot, Georgio
Fire again I—quick!—darn it, fire 1 ’’
Georgie—full of self-reliance—
Did his friends’ request obey :
Then the old hen paused, and cackled
In a most derisive way 1
Laughter,—loud, ungoverned laughter,—
Rose upon the sunny air;
All were laughing now, but Hadden,
Who was more inclined to swear;
For the gun had kicked his shoulder
In a most ungentle way.
Yet he bore it bravely, saying,
“Am I shot—or did I slay 1 ”
Fingers to the hen were pointed,
Louder rose the boist’rous laugh;
Hadden saw the sell, and bolted
Bather than endure the chafl.

The Hobart girls all want to learn French now.
They are counting up what might have happened if
they had only been able to speak to those handsome
Russians in a language which would fitly convey the
yearning tenderness of their fluttering little hearts. It
must have been very galling for the scotes of pretty
young damsels who thronged the decks of the flagship
during the ball, and at other times, to sec one or two
decidedly plain girls talking like hurricanes
to whole groups of tall Moscovites. The attempts at
French made by some of the ladies were positively
exornciating. One was heard to enquire, “Saves vons,
Mods. L. ? ” whilst a second remarked, ” C'est beau
temps." It is always the same in Hobart. Not long
ago, the ladies were sorry they did not know Japanese.
Perhaps they have been learning that language since
the visit of the Euijo, and have come to the conclusion
that inasmuch as the Japs, knowing no grammar were
yot so polite, the French have no right to idioms and
other niceties of speech.

A wedding which has just taken place at San
Francisco was the largest and most brilliant ever seen
in that city, the happy man being Mr. C. N. Shaw, a
wealthy resident of 'Frisco, and the bride Miss Evelyn
Towne, daughter of the millionaire railway king. Some
idea of its magnitude may be gleaned from the fact
that 1500 invitations were issued, some 300 guests
being asked from St. Louis, Chicago, and New York—
distances of from 2000 to over 3300 miles. The main
parlour of the Great Palace Hotel, which was the scene
of operations, was decorated with all the gorgeonsuess
that skill and cash could command, and at halt-past
eight the clergyman took his stand under a canopy of
palms and exotics, and, after patting the usual quos-
tions to “M. or N.," duly tied the knot. Immedi-
ately afterwards, ou the very spot whore the ceremony
took place, sets of lancers were formed, the now couple
taking the place under the floral canopy just vacated
by the minister, and the bridal party making up the
leading sot. Then guests poured in, and dancing
became general, continuing till dawn. The supper
was an indescribable marvel of art, even in these days
of gastronomic genius; and the best band to bo ob-
tained for money was engaged. The guests included
Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, Mayors, Judges,
Generals, Commanders, Colonels, and Captains by the
dozen, and the dresses were remarkable, not
only for their richness, but for their extraordi-
nary diversity. The bride’s mother was in a sump-
tuons costume of Pompeiau-red satin, the newest and
most gorgeous creation of Parisian skill, the skirt
terminating in front with a wide flounce of iridescent
beads, embroidered on black lace, and fringed with out
jet and facets; train of alternate panels of Pompeian
red and cream-coloured satin, brocaded with flowers,
corsage loaded with roses ; white diamonds flashed
everywhere. Among the other dresses were, white
gros-grain satin with Spanish gauze front; coral pink
satin, by Worth; shell pink satin , moss green plush ;
combination of olive and bronze satin; satin surah and
moird antique biooade in delicate rosy tint; Watteau
robe of white India cashmere; a dress of startling
magnificence, of white and gold brocade, the whole
front elaborately covered with white and gold beads; a
royal blue velvet; rich black velvet, with front of blue
satin, embroidered with pearls and blue beads; a canary
satin and Spanish lace, a pink satin over white silk
petticoat; a silver gauze, trimmed with Chantilly lace;
a dress of nun’s-veiling, artistically draped and looped
with field flowers : and a light blue silk trimmed with
lace and pearls, one of Worth’s inspirational wonders.
The presents were princely, and almost innumerable,
amongst them being £2500 and a royal set of diamonds
from Pa, gifts of £6OO, £250, £lOO in gold, lots of U.S.
and Hallway Bonds, Chickering piano, portrait of the
happy man’s mother-in-law, and a cup and saucer
specially ugly and infirm, which the pair are expected to
«• live up to." If grandeur would bring happiness, Mr.
and Mrs. Bhaw, junior, must be oppressively happy.

The ball given by Admiral Aalanbegoff and the
officers of the Eussian squadron, while at Hobart, was
the most brilliant affair ever seen in Tasmania, and
some officers of H.M.S. Emerald and Miranda went so
far as to acknowledge that it surpassed anything of the
kind they had seen afloat. There were about 350 guests
from the shore, and as the invitations had not been
confined to only the crumpled roseleaf section, the
gathering fairly represented the society of the colony,
and many beautiful women were there. The circle of
upper-tendom does not comprise all the beauty, and
certainly not all the intelligence of the community,
and much satisfaction was felt that the invitations had
been fairly general, and that no foolish lines of caste
had been allowed to interfere. The Afrika’s deck, from
the engine-room hatch aft, was carpeted and enclosed
with an awning, whilst so many beautiful ferns were
distributed round that it almost looked as if the Fern
Tree Bower itself had been transplanted on to the Ad-
miral’s flagship. The decks were all lighted with
the Jablocboff electric light, and fairy fountains
played in convenient spots. The Admiral’s quar-
ters were open for visitors, while refresh-
ments were laid on the main deck forward.
Champagne was liberally provided for all (and not, as
at some Sydney balls, tor a select few), so that even
people who were not rich and influential had a taste of
the sparkling ambrosia. Some of the dancing was of a
novel character, as the officers undertook to see their
guests through the continental figures, and under the
clever M.C-ship of a Plastoun officer, they succeeded
admirably. The great quadrille was followed by galop,
ades, polkas, and circles in rapid succession, but every-
thing was dona systematically, and the most precise
order prevailed. Special attention even was paid to
the relief of wallflowers, for some herculean officers
(possibly told off for the purpose) were to be seen, at
hints from the M C , taking up young Udies, as well as
those whose youthfulnesa was, perhaps, somewhat
open to question, who wore without partners, whirling
them round a few times, and then putting them politely
down and repeating the act of courtesy to some other
lonely maid. The music was supplied by the Afrika’s
baud, which went to some pains to tiffte up English
music, so as to render the affair more enjoyable to the
guests. It was highly diverting to hoar “Pinafore"
played quite correctly as regards note, but without
point, by the stolid-looking musicians. Visitors were
shown heme at an early hour of the morning, under the
combined electric lights of the three vessels, Afrika,
Plastoun, and Yestnick ; and two days later the little
capital was lamenting departure of the gallant
mariners, who had so fully returned the hospitality
extended to them.

A curious marriage at Murrurundi lately.
Mr. G. G. Hoy, a Chinese merchant, of Tingha, and of
reputed wealth, was united in the Roman Catholic
Church to a daughter of Mr. W. Long,_ storekeeper.
The whole affair was very stylish, the bride wearing a
forty guinea dress, and starting ter conjugal career
with a 400-guinea wardrobe. Some 40 guests partook of
the wedding feast at Mr. Long’s, on a grand scale, and
the breikfast was rendered remarkable by semi political
speeches, the Government coming in for warm censure
in regard to its treatment of Mr. Hoy’s countrymen.
The Rev. Mr. Marshall said the Chinese Bill was a most
unjust and oppressive measure, and advised the China-
men to trust in God, who would puni»h injustice and
crime. In the town, all was flags, excitement and
enthusiasm, and the happy couple took the mail train
for Sydney in the afternoon.

A very juvenile elopement occurred at Mel-

dead of night, with a few stray triflis they could pick
op, including the contents of their pas’ pockets. Shy.
look could not stand the loss of daughter and ducats
all at one swoop, and organised pursuit. The couple
were captured, while negotiating with a clergyman,
and brought back. The would-be bridegroom was
whipped; and, in view of this treatment, the maiden’s
fair fame can hardly be considered much sullied. This
reminds us that some years ago a boy of eighteen, son
of a well-known Melbourne solicitor, ran away with,
and actually married, the daughter of a loading Mel-
bourner. Wheu the pair wore caught, the bridegroom
wanted to go back to his lessons, but the boss of the
college objected—said ho didn’t want any married boys
at his place.

Archbishop Vaughan’s address to the thousand
ladies bore the ring of earnestness. That’s why he
sends things along When yon look at his firm lips,
and listen to his clear determined words, you cannot
doubt there’s meaning in them. It was his first appeal
to ladies, and it won’t bo nn idle one. Ho says, to make
his Old English Pair a success, it must bo different
from ordinary bazaars —more attractive, more amusing,
and more pure. We hope it will b« the latter, at any
rate. There are some people obstinate enough to think
that a swindle is just as bad under a religious cloak as
under any other—and they won’t go to a bazaar when
they know it is a scene of fraud and petty robbery.
When the Archbishop says that he and his coadjutors
at the forthcoming Fair “ will endeavour to reform
abuses which are general at bazaars," we can only take
the announcement to mean that he will not tolerate
swindling in any shape. Now, this is a good idea; let’s
grip it. Probably everyone in Sydney will go to the
“ Olde EnglysVe Fayreand, if it be, as Dr. Vaughan
has promised to make it, pure and legitimate—both
attractive and instructive—everyone will be likely to go
a good many times ; it will be a fashionable resort tor
thousands : and when a thing becomes popular, there’s
money in it. But, if these pleasant assurances are not
borne out—if men find that religion only covers rapacity
—that the place is a den of thieves (albeit in the guise
of beauteous damsels), and that the maidens so fair in
one view are mischievously unfair in another—then
they will go once, and once only. Man will occasion-
ally submit to be cheerfully plundered when caught at a
bazaar or fancy fair, for sweet woman’s wiles are hard
to resist,’.but it is very occasionally. The small attend-
ance of the male sex at such affairs is notorious—so
is the reason ; he does not like to be swindled, but can-
not say no to a pretty face and winning voice, so he
stops away. But it is men who are wanted as visitors,
for it is from their pockets the money comes. If the
scheme is carefully carried out according to the Arch-
bishop’s own description,the fair will bo enticing enough,
and with his energy and influence Dr. Vanghan can, if ho
likes, achieve a success without resorting to what he
calls “illegitimate amusements." He has influence
enough to stamp out the swindling element, and relieve
religion from the stigma so often oast on it by these
bazaars. Will he do so ?
VANITY FAIR.
At an inquest on the body of Martha Mealing

warned against the evils of tight-laoing, but gave no

tical. £7OOO will make new streets all over tho borough :
this straight away gets rid of the eternal drain for
patching, extensive repairing, or slow gradual forma-
tion of stree's. In six months the borough will be in a
position that otherwise, in respect of improved streets
and footpaths, it could not have reached in ten years.
Once well made, bat a small sum is required ro keep tho
streets in repair, Here is a line for tho Sydney Council
to adopt. Again, Barwood is solvent; a fair bank
balance at the command of the Mayor.
Tho audit system of Victoria has completely
broken down. There are three Commissioners appoint-
ed for life (removable, like the Judges, only by Parlia-
ment), at salaries of £IOOO a year each, with travelling
expenses. They have a staff of about thirty clerks, and
yet the defalcations during the last ten years (dis-
covered without thfir aid, nud in almost every instance
after their half-yearly inspections), cannot amount to
much less than about‘*so,ooo 1 These Commissioners
are very clever at raising “ queries ” as to occasional
clerical errors of a penny, but. somehow, miss the
thousands of pounds that are taken wholesale from the
revenue. The investigation into therecent defalcations
at tho Lands Office has not been made by the Commis-
sioners, but by one of the most able and energetic
officers of the Treasury.
In 1868 Victoria made 459,072 gallons wine, and
in 1881 only 484,028, tho area under vines having de-
creased nearly sjo acres in the same period. The
following is a statement of the areas under vines in the
respective colonies in 1873 and 1880—
1873. 1880.
Acres. Acres.
Victoria 5,222 ... 4,980
New South Wales ... 4,526 ... 4 73-1
South Australia ... 5,217 ... 4,337
Wine produced in the same years.
1873. 1880.
Galls. Galls.
Victoria 562,713 ... 484,028
New South Wales ... 575,985 .... 584,282
South Australia ... 733,478 ... 500,955
Thus during these seven years Australian vineyards
have decreased 925 acres, and tho annual production of
wine by 302.911 gallons. During the same interval
Queensland had increased her vino area from 364 to 739
acres, and her wine production from 41,479 to 85,455
gallons.
The Northern Territory is a really nice place
to live in. There’s only a sheet of brown paper between
it and a still warmer region. Society is unclassified,
and educated refinement almost unknown. Tour never-
failing friends ore mosquitoes, sand-flies, and alligators ;
To a Politician.
Wert thou worth onrsing, I could even curse—
But ’twould ennoble thea, such scathing verse.
To think thou hast the power to wring the soul
Almost to madness! thou hast such control
Over a man—not all confined to things
Of thy own vermin order, slime aud stings,
Anthropomorphous entities like thee,
Compound of cowardice and treachery.
Whate’er in the foul depths of thy foul heart
Induced the act, this more than Judas’ part.
That thou’lt regard it till thy latest day
As thy most glorious deed, I only pray j
Wilt chuckle o'er it with triumphant grin,
Till God shall strike thee outward as within—
A mass of rottenness.
'Tis vain, in sooth :
I've suffered, so I must say all the truth.
Howe’er I give thea to contempt and scorn.
The heart will speak, the heart which thou hast torn.
But never think thou’dst have such power to move
Had I not been afflicted from above.
God has afflicted me in thy fall view;
God has afflicted me—the devil too —
A devil and a brother ! And to thee
I poured my bruited soul’s sacred agony !
Upon my spirit’s knees from thee implored
One word, one line—one line, one little word—
No favour, surely, but a mere response
By hand or mouth, that I might know at once
If it could be that after all thy smiles,
Luring me to thee with all courteous wile).
Gratuitously brutal, thou couldtt turn
Thy back upon mo with an unconcern
No human thing could have ihe heart to feel,
Tho’ fibred thro' and thro’ with strings of steel.
O, I would even hate myself that e’er
I bowed to such as thee the anguished prayer—
Even after thou hadst wen mo to thy side
With fairest promises, a roseate tide
Of words the softest, blandest, and most kind—
Smiling before me, but to stab behind.
Yet cou d I hate myself I ne’er perceived,
Oozing thro’ all, the slime that still deceived ;
Tho cruel fangs beneath tho fleecy down,
'I he base assassin in tho sacred gown.
Yet in thy hour of triumph think of me;
Yea, in thy proud, supremest victory—
Even while thy followers feel the dark control
That cannot work but underground, like mole,
While hundreds breathless hang on thee, while drips
The rancid unction from thy lying lips,
Which form as false a mouth as ever prest
The oluek of Jesus at the fieud’s behest.
There comes an oily, ungrammatic flood
Of “truth,” and “right,’’and “peace,”and “brother-
hoo I.’’
Pause in thy grand career and think again
Of one who ne’er forgets, and has a brain
And soul and purpose that will sbriv»l thee.
Vile mongrel, battening upon treachery I
Will gibbet thee upon a fiery shelf.
Till thou shalt turn thy venom on thyself.
So hng thy last, and sure thy latest, deed
Close to thy heart. The day will bring the meed.

and about the only two things that a visitor can depend
©n seenring during his stay are grog and malaria lever,
which are never known to fail. The shakes are so
common that two old inveterate gamblers, who were
both suffering from the ague at the same time, have
been known to shako one another for a£s note. Police
protection might be depended on if the police had not
the shakes as well; but they are very often troubled
■with gastric irritation or chronic congestion of the
liver. The population of Palmerston, the metropolis
of the country, is entirely composed of Chinese,
policemen, and Civil servants.
That mernr man of Maitland, the Mayor, is
about to retire. Nothing will induce Mr. Riley to
accept a testimonial. All he is desirous ef is that the
present financial state of the borough, and the safe
condition of the town in respect of floods, the securing
of parks, &c., may be taken in their true significance
as to the manner in which he served the townspeople.
The operations of the diamond drill at the
brick-works of Mr. Hayes, North Shore, have been at-
tended with considerable success. The drill revealed
the existence, at some depth, of a splendid seam of
shale especially suited to the manufacture of the
quadruple-pressed polished white brisks made by Mr.
Hayes. Water has not, however, yet been struck in
large •aaatities, though a depth of 850 feet has been
reached.
Searey, the building society defaulter, gave evi-
dence against Thorp, the Bank of Victoria clerk who
invested the bank’s money on deposit receipts in
this particmlaj' building society. In tins office 11 might
have been therefore seen," as novelists say, the peculiar
occurrence of one clerk, who has just embezzled his
employers mon*v, handing it over the counter to an-
other clerk, who (unknown, of course, to the first one)
wm engaged doing the very same thing—for Searcy’s
defalcations extended over a considerable period.
"Shanks’ pony” is a serviceable steed, but
many a weary wayfarer has wished that, instead of
shanks pony, he had Shank’s three horse-power. He
can get the latter now, and although he is likely
enough to sink down by the way-side when he dees get
it, fatigue will not be the cause. Shank’s new patent
steam pumps, combined with their vertical steam
boilers, range from 2 to 12 horse-power, and are the
t #r WOf king wells on farms and stations. D.
and W. Robertson sell them.
Riley Brother’ semi-annual sale, which !is now
recognised as one of the great retail trade affairs of the
city, has commenced. The Riley Brothers import sea-
sons goods In large shipments, and in' order to clear
their various establishments for fresh supplies hold
great clearance sale* every half-year. The system on
which the whole of this business is conducted, by means
of which many thousands of pounds’ worth of stock is
Kept moving along, is most comprehensive, and is
capital testimony to the trading capabilities of the
heads of the enterprising firm. The real significance
of this to the general public is, that Eiley Brothers’
half-yearly sales are genuine, and they have come to be
regarded as a boon to the city.
