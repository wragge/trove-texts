FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is. it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

S. H. PRIOR MEMORIAL PRIZE
To recognise the services to Australian literature of the late Samuel
Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £lOO per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for <a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain ail property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which
will not be opened until the judges have made their decision.
The judges’ selections will be final, and competitors must accept as
binding the trustees’ decisions on other matters arising out of the contest.
The trustees, whose address is 252 George-street, Sydney, reserve the
right to withhold the prize if no novel submitted is, in the opinion of the
judges, worthy of an award.

HIS
BOOKS
Ballyhoo
Biographies and autobiographies are
getting almost as popular as movies.
They possess many of the qualities of
screen romances ; indeed, several of the
most successful have been written by
movie stars. Some Australian papers
are publishing a syndicated “Life” of
Mary Pickford, which is lush with emo-
tional intimacies. This hard-headed little
businesswoman is presented as a simple,
loving child. A mass-educated public
doesn’t want the truth about those whose
news-value is capitalised by publishers,
but a glamorous story with deft touches
warranted to bring a tear to the eye of
sensibility. The practice has given the
English language one of the most ex-
pressive words it ever took over from
American —ballyhoo.
It is appropriate that T. P. O’Connor,
by Hamilton Fyfe (Allen and Unwin ;
165.), should contain plenty of ballyhoo.
The young man who arrived from Dub-
lin to make a career in Fleet-street 64
years ago was the first to introduce it
to London journalism.
A Contented Exile
London always contains plenty of
Irishmen—and, for that matter, Aus-
tralians and Americans —like T.P. They
talk with affection of their native
land, but sedulously avoid it. In 1885
the young Irish spellbinder, who had
been returned as member for Galway
five years before, was elected for both
Galway and Liverpool. He chose Liver-
pool, and never left England, or even
London, afterwards if he could help it.
As a daily-paper journalist, T.P. was
20 years ahead of his time. In the “Star,”
which he founded and edited, there was
a “Mainly About People” column to
which he often contributed gossip him-,
self.
For many years he shared the social
odium which the Irish Nationalists earned
by their behavior in the House. This
grieved him deeply. He yearned to be
loved as wistfully as any film star. Not
till after the arrival of the Free State
did he come into his own in this respect.
By then he was growing old, and had
developed into an institution. In Eng-
land all is forgiven once a public man
reaches 70 —Shaw himself has thus lost
his former power to exasperate the bour-
geois—and T.P. was no Shaw. He never
wrote a book, made a speech or said a
thing that anybody remembers ; but he
had an infinite capacity for blarney. He
was given a Privy Councillorship in 1924,
not because his counsels had benefited
the nation or were likely to, but because
he was 76 and had spent an immense
number of years writing flattering para-
graphs about his innumerable acquaint-
ances.
T.P. was the most accomplished
tabloid editor of his day, and an amiable
personality ; but there was nothing else
to him. He was an ineffectual politi-
cian ; and when Mr. Fyfe gives a quota-
tion from his writings and comments:
“There is a depth of feeling in it which
makes it literature,” he is employing an
art which cheapened T.P. while it en-
riched him —the art of ballyhoo.
“Ulysses” Made Easy
In James Joyce (Grayson and Gray-
son ; Dymock’s ; 12s. 6d.), Frank Budgen
deals on very different lines with a very
different type of Irishman. Joyce has
shown no more desire to live in Ireland
than did T.P., Carson or dozens of other
patriot-expatriates whose names will
occur readily to Londoners. Yet he is
nearer to Erin in spirit than any of
them. Italian may be the language of
his family, and France or Germany may
be his chosen home, but Dublin is rarely
out of his thoughts.
This fascinating book is not so much
a biography as a combined synopsis and
elucidation of “Ulysses.” Joyce stands
near the writer’s desk, so to speak, but
he only comes into the picture with
an occasional self-
revealing remark.
Or the tall, lean,
bearded exile
may burst into
one of the music-
hall songs of his
youth —one sung by Dan Leno or
Harry Randall or Gus Elen —or don
a straw picture hat and dance, be-
coming “a thing of whirling arms,
high-kicking legs, grotesque capers and
coy grimaces.” So we soon get to know
him, though ostensibly Mr. Budgen’s job
is to expound Bloom.
Each episode of “Ulysses” is examined
at length. “Circe,” for example, is given
over 30 pages. Mr. Budgen is a pene-
trating critic, with the fullest powers of
self-expression, and his method brings
Bloom to life in a strangely effective
manner. To a degree it also brings the
underworld of Dublin to life, though
nearly all the scatology is missing. Joyce
supplies the inevitable ballyhoo.
I inquired about Ulysses. Was it pro-
gressing?
“1 have been working hard on it all
day,” said Joyce.
“Does that mean that you have written
a great deal?” I said.
“Two sentences,” sai'd Joyce.
Portrait of a Sheik
H. C. Armstrong’s Lord of Arabia
(Barker ; 95.) has the ominous sub-title
“Intimate Story of a King.” It is prac-
tically all ballyhoo. Many Australian
Light Horsemen came in contact with
the insanitary followers of Ibn Saud, a
bloodthirsty and treacherous savage
who gave the British a good deal
of trouble during and after the war.
The war confronted Ibn with an
embarrassing problem. He hated the
British but had an uneasy presenti-
ment that they were going to win.
He was one of the many tribesmen who
took a subsidy to remain neutral, ? and
added to it by robbery with violence.
Lawrence distrusted him, and events
showed how right Lawrence was.
Long before Husein proclaimed him-
self Caliph Ibn had “sent preachers
into the Hejaz itself stirring up the
tribesmen.” Husein fled. Britain was
sick of fighting in Arabia to no purpose ;
the Government “decided to cut its losses
and get out.” Ibn, who at 21 had been a
penniless desperado, became King of the
Hejaz and of Nejd. In the flowery lan-
guage of his biographer,
He stands, basing himself four square on
his trust in God, straddled across Arabia
holding the whole land and its people
between his clenched fists.
There is a jHollywoodesque description
of his appearance. “A great giant with
a handsome head.... easy magnificence
of manner... .eyes brown and full of
light side face the look of a hawk
or an eagle.”
Nor does his nature belie his looks.
He loved a good fight, a good song,
and he was a tremendous lover.
With it all he is a sentimentalist.
Despite all the women who came to
him Jauhara had been his one woman.
She was his Queen. Her death nearly
broke his heart.
In short, an Ethel Dell chieftain in every
particular.

Makers of Modern Melbourne
The Pioneers of Port Phillip (Robert-
son and Mullens; 25.) is the story of
early Melbourne, written for boys and
girls by P. St. J. Wilson. It gives a
stirring picture of Murray’s and Collins’s
abortive adventures, the curiously dra-
matic appearances on the scene almost
simultaneously of Batman, Fawkner and
the Hentys, and the astonishment of
Major Mitchell, the overlanding explorer
from Sydney, at finding them already in
occupation. The rapid expansion of in-
dividual enterprise and the gradual
development of ordered government, the
delirium of the gold rush and the return
to reality of the patient are portrayed
simply and efficiently. There is one glar-
ing defect in the book as a guide for
children, however.
The pioneer Melbourne real-estate
speculator, the pioneer Geelong pub-
keeper and storekeeper, the pioneer
ploughman and even two pioneer mur-
derers are mentioned. But there is no
reference to the pioneer poets, novelists,

INCREASES THE CmU BY INDEPENDENTLY SPRUNG FRONT WHEELS
Working in close co-operation with car
manufacturers in their development of
Independently Sprung Front Wheels,
Goodyear experts evolved the latest
Airwheel* Tyre as companion to this
latest mechanical achievement.
Airwheel* Tyres by Goodyear provide
the last word in motoring comfort not
only for cars with Independently Sprung
Front Wheels, but also for cars without
this feature.,
There is one point, though, which should
not be overlooked. The Airwheel* type
of tyre is so new that most tyre makers
lack experience with it have not yet
learned how to build it.
That is why the large majority of this
year's new cars fitted with this type of
tyre are being equipped with Airwheels.*
If men who make and sell motor cars
take no chances, why should you?
They know Goodyear pioneered, devel
oped, perfected this new type of tyre
years ahead of the rest.
If you want the riding comfort of a deep,
soft easy-chair, together with dependable,
safe and long mileage, fit Airwheels* by
Goodyear.
•k Airwheel is Goodyears registered Trade Mark and is used
to denote that Goodyear is the exclusive maker of Airwheel*
Tyres.

sculptors, architects, painters or musi-
cians. Mr. Gellibrand, the pioneer
lawyer, is immortalised, but no room
has been found for the names of A. L.
Gordon, Louis Buvelot, Tom Roberts,
Marcus Clarke, Max Meldrum, Nellie
Melba, Percy Grainger and suchlike
pioneers of beauty. There is mention of
the invention of a plough for rolling
down the Mallee scrub, of a harvester,
of a cream separator and of a refri-
gerator ; but there is no allusion to the
inventor of the Treasury building in
Spring-street, or of the lovely fountain
near by.
The only justification given for Federa-
tion is that it enabled troops to be dis-
patched to the World War more effi-
ciently than they were to the Boer War.
Rolf Boldrewood is mentioned, but only
because the author found a quotation
from his works useful. The only descrip-
tion of Melbourne which has pretensions
to any aesthetic quality is faked from a
description of London by Whistler. Mr.
Wilson sums up his philosophy in the
remark that “a city is just a great, big
market-place where buyers meet sellers.”
No more pernicious doctrine could be
instilled into girls and boys.
A curious item concerns the first
schoolmaster, Mr. Penny. He was an ex-
convict, had one eye and was a con-
firmed drunkard. He got drunk daily
with a friend who kept a drinking-shop
and whose name, by a remarkable co-
incidence, was Halfpenny. It was a
popular wisecrack of the period that as
long as Melbourne had these two
worthies it would never be short of
coppers. Despite his antecedents and
habits, Mr. Penny was a gentle soul and
flouted the pedagogic traditions of his
time by never flogging his charges.
M.S.
A Publisher at Sea
Australia’s latest publisher has just
issued his second monthly circular. It
is good to see this evidence of the new
venture in being, but why should Mr.
Stephensen go out of his way to deni-
grate those who have gone before him,
and with whom he must live side by
side?
In the second paragraph of “Book
Publishing in Australia” he says that the
late George Robertson offered him a
welcome, and told him that, in his
opinion, there was scope for several'new
publishing houses to deal with Aus-
tralia’s growing literary output. A
generous gesture, and characteristic of the
fine man who made it.
Having given Mr. Robertson a pass-
ing mention, Mr. Stephensen goes on to
write of “a country which Jack Lindsay
and Philip Lindsay had to leave seeking
publishers ; a country which could not
publish Brent of Bin Bin, Henry Handel
Richardson, Katharine Prichard, Helen
Simpson, G. B. Lancaster, Norman Lind-
say, Dale Collins, Jack McLaren, Vance
Palmer, Frederic Manning, Leslie Meller ;
where poetry of William Baylebridge,
Hugh McCrae, Christopher Brennan, re-
mained unpublished.”
He is unfortunate in his choice
of nearly all these names. Jack
and Philip Lindsay never attempted
to publish in Australia anything save
some erotic verses of poor quality. Jack
Lindsay left Australia many years ago.
He had no “Rome for Sale” to offer
then, nor had Philip Lindsay produced
anything like “Panama Is Burning” when
he left. Whoever Brent of Bin Bin may
be, he, or she, certainly did not offer
“Up the Country” to any Australian pub-
lisher.
Henry Handel Richardson left Aus-
tralia as a schoolgirl to study music.
It was only after three years at Leipzig
that she found she could not hope to
attain the highest rank as a professional
musician, and decided to become a
novelist. She assuredly had no grudge
against Australia. In 1927, before
“Ultima Thule” appeared, she expressed
to the present writer her gratitude that
her work had appreciative readers here.
Her home was in England, and she
naturally found her publisher there.
Helen Simpson is the unhappiest choice
of all. Like Henry Handel Richardson,
she left Australia, as a girl, to study
music. But, unlike her, she had already
produced literary work of quality, and
that work was published by Angus and
Robertson. Not only was her first book
published here, but no pains or expense
were spared over its format. It was
printed in Adelaide because the best
printing in Australia was being done
there at the time. A year or so later
she sent to Angus and Robertson, from
London, her play “A Man of His Time,”
and the firm published it. She was now,
however, beginning to find her feet in
England, and, as she had married and
made her home there, she naturally
sought English publishers.
Whether G. B. Lancaster ever offered
a book to an Australian publisher she
alone can say. But the Endeavour Press
is not the only Australian firm that
sought to issue a local edition of
“Pageant.” It merely had the luck to get
in first.
The Bookstall Co. published Norman
Lindsay’s first and, in some respects, best
novel before Mr. Stephensen was born.
As for “Redheap,” if it had been offered
here, which it was not, any publisher
might have been pardoned for refusing it.
Frederic Manning is among those who
left Australia and settled in England
before they began to write. Hugh Mc-
Crae’s “Columbine and Other Verses”
was published by Angus and Robertson
23 years ago, and the same firm pub-
lished Christopher Brennan’s “The Chant
of Doom.”
The Bookstall Company published
every book Jack McLaren wrote up to
the time he left for London.
“Ordeal,” Dale Collins’s first and most
successful novel, was written after he
had left Melbourne for good. It was
never offered to any Australian pub-
lisher. Like the books of other writers
mentioned by Mr. Stephensen it only
appeared in London because the writer
happened to be living there.
Mr. Stephensen has a great goal ahead.
Let him not depreciate men whose
pioneer work has alone made it possible
for him to commence as a publisher in
Australia. And let him remember that
accuracy of statement is a fine asset in
a maker of books, and that in this re-
spect he has had predecessors who have
set a high standard.

The St. Quentin “Bulletin"
In California’s St. Quentin Peniten-
tiary (population, 6000) the Government
is experimenting with the notion that it
is better to educate than punish male-
factors.
When you reach St. Quentin one of
the things that happens on your first day
is that you have thrust into your hand
a syllabus which offers you an oppor-
tunity of studying almost any art, science
or craTt you ever heard of. If you are
such a highbrow that you don’t feel the
need for further study, you may become
an inmate tutor.
It would be nice to be able to say
that all prisoners take advantage of these
opportunities. Only about 25 p.c. do.
And I don’t know to what extent this
education of criminals tends to destroy
criminality. All I have before me is a
copy of The Bulletin, the prison’s maga-
zine. It is printed “bi-monthly” and is
in its 22nd volume. Its editor, asso-
ciate editors, poetry editor, art director
and “associate production editor” (what-
ever that may be) are all lags ; always
have been. The comments of contri-
butors cover a wide range of interest, and
in four pages devoted to “Caged Poets”
there are many echoes of “The Ballad of
Reading Gaol” ; trite expressions of con-
trition —or defiance ; wallows in senti-
ment ; thuds into bathos. The best
the editor of these poetry, pages can say
of them is that they express “finer
thoughts and impulses.”
There’s a ray of brightness here in the
midst of depression. The best poets keep
out of gaol.

Laughter and Lyrics
Of the 279 entries in the Melbourne
centenary lyric competition not one
was adjudged worthy of a £lO prize.
So the lyricists’ masterpieces have gone
back to them with their half-crowns, and
the committee is asking “established”
practitioners to produce the necessary
goods.
The writer has never met an “estab-
lished” poet, and even if the centenary
committee finds a few it is only likely to
get some sets of hexameters beginning
“Awake! Arise!” or “Melbourne, hail!”
The kind of works that will be bound
later between imitation morocco covers
and become the bane of the second-hand
bookshops for several generations. How-
ever, anything will certainly be good
enough for a centenary committee
which knows little about poetry and
which, even if it knew much, would
be unlikely to recognise a genuine
anthem on sight. What centenary or
other committee would be likely to pick
“The Marseillaise,” “Deutschland fiber
Alles,” “God Save the King” or “Mal-
brouck Has Gone to the Wars” for the
purposes to which they have been suited
by millions of people?
Probably, in all history, there have
been only two successful national odes
written of set intent. One was Kipling’s
“Recessional,” the other Bjornson’s “Ja,
jeg elsker dette landet,” the national
anthem of Norway. Though the
writers were “established poets” neither
was competing for a £lO prize, and
neither submitted his work to be judged
by a committee. Moreover, each wrote
in a period of national emotion on the
edge of stirring events. Who could be
stirred by the go-getting Yankeefied
atmosphere of the impending Melbourne
shivoo?

A Satchel of Books
The latest Home (3/4/’34) is an
amazing production at the price—ls. 3d.
There are 84 pages, and perhaps five
times as many pictures and photographs.
About a third of them are of social nota-
bilities as usual. A considerable pro-
portion are advts., but a feature of this
production is that the advts. are quite
as alluring as the society beauties. C. H.
Bertie has an interesting article (with
photographs) on “The Wicked Spots of
Old Sydney,” and Tommy Cochran’s
London Gossip is bright.
Geoffrey Dennis, whose novel “The End
of the World” was awarded the Haw-
thornden Prize, is responsible for another
sound book in Bloody Mary’s (Heine-
mann ; 7s. 6d.). It concerns the last few
years of a small Lancashire grammar
school founded by Scottish Mary. Some
of the masters and a number of the boys
are a brutish lot, and the author is in-
clined to dwell on the fact. The chief
merit of the story lies in its shrewd
observation and characterisation; the
doctor and Mr. Bye among the masters
and Oldham and Abel among the boys
are completely alive.
There are 984 pages in Ellery Queen
Omnibus (Gollancz; 7s. 6d.), and not
one will be adjudged dull by a fair-
minded homicide fan. “The Greek Coffin
Mystery” is perhaps the most ingenious
of the three, but “The French Powder
Mystery” runs it close. Inspector Queen
has the deductive genius of the late Sher-
lock Holmes, and a far more impressive
vocabulary. This is how he charges the
sinister scientist Kneise with having cold
feet in “The Dutch Shoe Mystery”:
“I feel sure that, if a cardiometer were
to be attached to your carcass at this
. moment, Doctor, it would register an accel-
erated pulse-percussion at the following
statement: Abigail Doom was murdered
fyefore she signed the second will.”
Like Holmes, Queen is virtually infal-
lible.
Really satisfactory gunmen are a fast-
diminishing lot, but Jim-twin Allen, the
hero of Hal Dunning’s The Outlaw
Sheriff (Ward Lock and Co.; 3s. 6d.) is
the genuine article.
Everyone there who saw him recognised
in him a relentless force of destruction....
Walking stiff-legged like a fighting wolf,
yellow eyes flaring, body loose and sway- ,
ing, hands swinging close to his guns....
“Gents, I’m countin’ three! One!”
Single-handed he kills eight men in
three fights, and then turns with a callous
laugh to devour pie. He should be heard
of again soon. Heroes of this type are
like old soldiers: they never die.
“The Highlands are finished for us,”
says old Donald Gorm in James Barke’s
The Wild Macßaes (Collins; 7s. 6d.).
“The English can have them now —or
the scum out of the cities of the south.
The scum that rises to the top. The
scum with the money.” It is a bitter
story of the hopeless struggle of the High-
land crofters who went to the war which
was to make Britain “a land fit for
heroes” to get hold of enough land to
keep them off the dole. Page, an Eng-
lishman who owns Dumgallon, in the
north-west Highlands, and Mathieson, his
factor, are among the more detestable
characters ; the crofters are all likeable,
and particularly their leader Findlay
Macßae, V.C. The end is tragedy: law
and order, aided by Mathieson’s cun-
ning, are too much for the land-raiders.
A fine novel which casts intimate lights
on several aspects of the dour Scotch
character.
The Night Life of the Gods, by Thorne
Smith (Barker; 7s. 6d.), concerns the
discovery of an American scientist
named Hunter Hawk. Having evolved
a recipe for turning human beings into
statues, he runs across an immortal who
gives him one for bringing statues to life.
Gathering a horde of Olympians round
him, he goes on a series of benders in
N. York, and this kind of dialogue
ensues: —
“You’re a good sort, Hunter,” Venus
had replied, “even if you did practically
kick me out of your bed.”
“Listen, my dear,” Diana had put in, “if
you held a grudge against every man who
had been forced to kick you out of his
bed at one time or another, virtually
every member of the male population of
Italy and Greece would be in your bad
graces.”
The gods and goddesses wisecrack as
busily as the cigar-chewing Marx Brother
himself. Americans and imitation-Ameri-
cans may think it funny; the japes soon
palled on this critic.

PLAYING THE INNER GROUP’S
GAME.
Premier Stevens has many impressive
qualities. A good financial head, integ-
rity, a firm will, expressed among
other directions in a stolid refusal to be
flustered by jeers and insults. But at
the political game Mr. Lang can give him
points and a beating.
It is an axiom of democratic govern-
ment that the big voting interests must
be considered. President Roosevelt was
rebuffed by Congress the other day be-
cause he put national recovery before
the voting power of America’s so-called
war veterans. Congress “defiantly added
228,000,000 dollars in bonuses, making
a total of 7,000,000,000 dollars,” to the
remuneration of these gentlemen all of
whom have votes, though few have been
near a war. The President crashed be-
cause “hundreds of Congressmen must
soon face the voters.”
Mr. Lang must soon face the voters,
and he is taking the usual steps. The
lures which he offers include a 30-hour
week; State aid for denominational
schools; increase of the basic wage;
lower food prices ; bigger profits for pri-
mary producers, and a State banking
system which will preserve the rights of
depositors while making generous credits
available to all at nominal interest-rates.
U.A.P. and C.P. electors don’t expect
the Stevens Government to compete in
this field. Votes bought with lies are
worth little in the long run, anyhow.
City people who have been promised
lower food prices are bound in time to
meet country people who have been pro-
mised higher prices for meat, milk and
butter, with awkward results. But that
isn’t to say that Government sup-
porters expect nothing. The U.A.P. and
C.P. undertook to do more than improve
the unemployment position and restore
the State’s credit when they went to the
polls close on two and a half years
ago. They said over and over again that
the major evils of the Lang regime would
be tackled, and as far as possible elimi-
nated. Consider a few:
The Lottery
This device for raising money for the hos-
pitals was condemned almost unanimously by
U.A.P. and C.P. speakers when Mr. Lang intro-
duced it. They condemned it morally, socially
and economically, and gave thousands to
understand that if Lang went his lottery would
go, too. It is in a stronger position than
ever in some respects. At June 30 last ticket
sales for the year were £2,054,982; and prize-
money £1,304,000. Private donations to the
hospitals have almost stopped; lotteries are
being filled about every ten days; and the
Minister for Health (Mr. Weaver) has spoken
approvingly of a lottery with £lOO,OOO in prizes,
and proportionately expensive tickets. The
system has even been extended to allow private
lottery syndicates to organise gambles for the
benefit of private hospitals.
St. Andrew’s Cathedral
Just before Mr. Bavin was last returned, and
at a time when it was certain that he would
be returned, Mr. Lang promised the Anglican
authorities a cathedral site in Macquarie-street
and £500,000 compensation for moving from
George-street, the idea being that St. Andrew’s
had been rendered useless as a place of wor-
ship by the underground and other adjacent
developments. Mr. Bavin refused to imple-
ment a promise which Mr. Lang wouldn’t have
dared to keep if he had become Premier again.
Many leading Anglicans, including Canon
Hammond (who has described the scheme as “a
calamity”), are hostile; and members of other
denominations, and of none, consider it an
outrage that they should be taxed because Mr.
Lang once thought it a smart political trick
to leave his successor an awkward problem.
It is safe to say that nine U.A.P. and C.P.
electors out of ten agree with Canon Ham-
mond on this subject, and will be scandalised
if a perfectly good cathedral, which has been
repeatedly filled with worshippers since Arch-
bishop Mowll arrived, is torn down and the tax-
payers’ money wasted on another in an area
which already has a famous old Anglican
church. Yet there is evidence that the Stevens
Government means to put the job through if
it can.
Communists
The Bulletin received a letter from an anti-
Lang working man a few days ago containing
these passages: “One of the chief sins of the
Stevens Government is its docility towards
strife-fomenters. Implicatively it amounts to
fawning approval. When the West Concord kick-
up was on there was handed to every worker on
every relief job in the State this circular.”
(The circular, which is headed “A Call to
Action! Stop the Stevens Hunger Drive!”
urges the workers to “march off every job—
when a great mass struggle must be directed
against the Government,” and much more
to the same effect.) The writer concluded:
“Thus, while ostensibly working for the general
betterment, the Government, by its toleration,
is engineering a checkmate.” Others have
directed this criticism at the Stevens Gov-
ernment, which was elected, in part, to curb
the activities of irreconcilables whose motto is,
“It’s a fine day. Let’s go out and start a
strike.”
Transport
The Lang Government was responsible for
the Transport Co-ordination Act, which gives
the State a 90 p.c. monopoly over transport. It
was strongly opposed by anti-socialists at the
time. Yet the Government has taken the Act
over in the alleged interests of the railways
and tramways, as it has taken the lottery
over in the alleged interests of the hospitals.
The Act hasn’t done the railways much good
(they have lost over £7,000,000 in the 3J years
that it has been on the statute book) and it
has done immense damage to the motor indus-
try. ’Buses have been driven off the streets of
Sydney and suburbs in all directions for the
benefit of the State trams and trolley cars,
and when the firm of Grace Brothers recently
started a service for the convenience of cus-
tomers it was prosecuted. The Stevens Gov-
ernment is enforcing the Transport Act as
rigorously as the Lang Government ever did.
A difference is that, whereas Labor thus earned
and consolidated support, the Stevens Govern-
ment is alienating it. Car-owners, van-owners,
'bus-owners, proprietors of service stations,
garage-owners, proprietors of shops and hotels
and thousands of others who have been in-
juriously affected by the Act are normally
U.A.P. or C.P. supporters.
When it is remembered that the Gov-
ernment has inevitably sacrificed a
section of the public-service vote through
retrenchment measures which were
forced on it by the world slump, and
that there is a natural tendency on the
part of electors to, change administrative
horses in depression streams, it will be
realised that the Inner Group has
grounds for optimism. The Langite poli-
cies which the U.A.P. and C.P. have
adopted won’t get them any Trades Hall
votes, and they will lose them many anti-
Labor votes.
OUR UNDEFENDED NORTH.
The attitude of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment towards the Japanese who have
been invading our trochus beds is in-
comprehensible. Threats on the part
of Japanese captains have been re-
ported. One said the other day that he
would dynamite his ship if opposed. At
Awinn, in the Admiralty Islands, a
planter who protested against foreign in-
vasion had his copra shed burnt. Yet
no official action has been taken, and
Mr. Marr hasn’t yet fulfilled his vague
promise to confer with Japan.
A recent article in the “S. M. Herald,”
which seems to have been inspired, set
out the alleged official difficulties.
The Commonwealth has power to deal
with fisheries beyond the three-mile terri-
torial limit; the States exercise jurisdiction
within the three-mile limit.... Upon the
appearance of the Commonwealth authori-
ties, the poacher can simply retreat within
the three-mile limit and thus place him-
self under State jurisdiction If a ship
is intercepted it is impossible to say defi-
nitely whether the shell has been obtained
within or without the three-mile limit.
The Commonwealth has customs powers
which extend not only within the three-
mile limit, but to the centre of Australia.
It can collect taxes anywhere. It has
immigration powers which it can enforce
over every inch of the continent. Let
any overseas tourist try to land without a
passport, or arrive with a few dolls up
his sleeve, as one did the other day at
Fremantle, and he will regret it. Let
an Australian skipper try to bring his
Chinese cook ashore without finding a
£lOO bond, and he also will regret it.
Yet when an invading vessel put in at
Thursday Island recently its crew were
allowed ashore without supervision, this
though some, no doubt, were infected
with disease.
Of the latest vessel, which has been
fishing a few miles from a police station
and customs house, and which news-
paper reporters have been visiting, a
northern resident writes to The Bulle-
tin: —
Whilst I was having a holiday at Dunk
Island last week, one of the strange craft
suddenly appeared.... About 20 men
came ashore and proceeded to load up whn
wood and water....l am quite satisfied
that these people know as much about the
coast as we d 0.... I'hey landed in the
only place on the island where they could
have hoped to secure the supplies they
needed. Having a very, fast boat, they go
where they like and defy authority.
In two years these ships, large, fast and
well built, have driven the biggest Darwin
fleet to the shelter of the Aru Islands.
On the N. Queensland coast and among
the Torres islands, according to one of
the biggest shell men in Australia,
disaster stares the Australian concerns in
the face unless they can- bring costs down
to a competitive basis.
The Australians pay duties on their
gear and stores as well as Federal and
State taxes and fishing license dues.
They pay Australian scales of wages.
The raiders go scot-free. There appears
to be no doubt that all through the
North our immigration laws are being so
flagrantly defied that the electors of Aus-
tralia might well suspect that the Com-
monwealth Government had abandoned
the White Australia policy and decided
to let the coastline fall into alien hands.
The cotnmercial inhabitants of Thursday
Island, Broome and Darwin number five
Asiastics at least to one white. On the
rest of the northern seaboard Orientals
have a free range. Twenty Japanese —
all breakers of our quarantine, Customs,
fishing and other laws —have been killed
by blacks around Caledon Bay alone in
the last decade, and a native now lies
under sentence of death in Darwin for
murders committed as a result of the
interference by Japanese crews with
native women.
The feeble attitude of the Govern-
ment is undermining Australian prestige
in the East, endangering lives, bringing
the law into contempt, establishing pre-
ferential treatment for lawbreakers, and
generally driving a nail into the coffin of
the national policy. Mr. Lyons might
well pause in his party strife to give the
matter personal attention. He must, un-
less he desires to continue a dangerous
condition of affairs in which hot-headed
action by some half-ruined Australian
sheller is liable to lead to an international
incident of a grave nature, arrange with-
out delay for the patrolling of our north-
ern waters. He must maintain the law
in these regions, and punish the people
who break it. If experience in the 1923
Thursday Island riots goes for anything,
he should get every assistance from
Tokio. The Japanese authorities, we
may be sure, would be the last to object
to the enforcement of Australian law in
Australian territory.
CIVILIANS IN THE DEFENCE
DEPARTMENT.
Dear Bulletin, —Y our sub-leader
(4/4/’34) about the late . Lieut.-Com-
mander Casey, R.A.N., overlooked some
vital aspects of the system which broke
this officer. The fittest athlete is liable
to be attacked by the complaint from
which he suffered—nervous exhaustion.
According to the “S. M. Herald”
(9/4/’34):
A Collins-street specialist who examined
Jack Crawford when he was suffering from
nervous exhaustion after his return from
abroad last year said yesterday that he
considered that the continuous strain of
playing big tennis matches over a long
period was responsible for the death of
Jiro Satoh.
Men went under from the same cause
during the war, were treated, recovered
and returned to their ships or to the line,
where, in many cases, they subsequently
distinguished themselves. Callousness or
ignorance on the part of the authorities
might have driven some of them to
suicide ; and in this connection it is in-
teresting to note that “a section of the
directorate of the Japanese Tennis Asso-
ciation has resigned because it assumes
responsibility for Satoh’s suicide.”
There will be no resignations in the
Defence Department over Lieut.-Com-
mander Casey’s suicide. Yet the docu-
ments tabled as evidence at the inquest
show anybody capable of reading be-
tween the lines where the chief respon-
sibility for his death lies.
Casey went to Jervis Bay in 1916
as a boy of 13. He graduated in
1919, passed for promotion to lieutenant
with distinction, and was selected to
specialise as a signal and w./t. officer,
doing the 12 months’ course and the
special advanced course. In 1930 drastic
reductions in personnel were being made
in the R.A.N. and officers were called on
to volunteer for retirement. Overwork
had affected Casey’s nerves, and, on the
advice of a surgeon-commander at
R.N.H. Chatham, he offered to resign.
Had he been allowed to do so at that
stage, he would have been entitled to
compensation. The Service refused to
let him go. To quote from a Naval
Board communication (16/6/’30):
Lieut. Casey is, I am to state, looked
upon as an officer above the average, and
on personal grounds he would be a loss
to the Service if retired.
His offer of resignation may, it is
thought, have been prompted by the im-
pression that it would be a convenience
to the Service and possibly assist the board
in effecting the necessary reduction. It is
desired that he should be informed that
such is not the case.
He returned to Australia, served on
the Albatross, was given charge of the
Signal School at Flinders Naval Depot
(1931), and was appointed to H.M.A.
Squadron as signal and w./t. officer
(1932). In the same year he was pro-
moted lieut.-commander.
In July, 1933, he was attacked by in-
somnia, and one of the Macquarie-street
specialists who handle such cases for the
R.A.N. recommended a month’s leave.
Casey was told by a member of the
Medical Board which examined him after
his leave that he “had not been recom-
mended for discharge.”
The first news he got that the R.A.N.
had finished with him was contained in
an instruction to the Captain Superin-
tendent, Sydney, from the Navy Office,
Melbourne:
With reference to the report of medicai
survey on Lieut.-Commander Casey I am
directed to inform you that the Naval
Board have decided that this officer is to be
invalided from the R.A.N. as “below naval
physical standard.”
Letter from Casey to the Naval Board
secretary:
With reference to my recent invaliding
following on the report of medical sur-
vey dated October 4, 1933, I desire to
inform the Naval Board that my health for
the last two months has been very good.
Such being the case I have to request
that 1 may be resurveyed by a board ol
medical officers at an early date with a
view to ascertaining whether my state of
health is now such as to indicate that I
am “below naval physical standard,” qb-
serving that I find difficulty in obtaining
suitable employment owing to the per-
sonal medical unfitness implied in such
reason for my discharge from the Royal
Australian Navy.
From the secretary’s reply:
Regarding your letter of January 16, 1934,
I am directed by the Naval Board to in-
form you that they note with pleasure
that your health has improved, but they
are unable to arrange for any further medi-
cal survey.
From Casey:—■
I desire to request that I may be in-
formed of the definition of the phrase
“below naval physical standard,” as to
where that standard is laid down, and as
to the matters in the report of the Medi-
cal Board of Survey in which I was found
to be below that standard. I should also
be pleased to be referred to the specific
authority under which the board acted in
the matter of my invaliding with the serious
result of bringing about the immediate ter-
mination of my service.
That was written in February last. He
never got a resurvey, and never learned
why he had been adjudged “below naval
physical standard.” He had been bilked
of his compensation money, pushed out
of the Service at short notice with
a slur on his physical, if not mental,
reputation, and refused any explanation
or redress. A decent private employer
wouldn’t have treated a sick abo. in such
a manner.
Not only was his trouble solely due
in the first place to overwork done in
his country’s service, but it was curable.
It is a trouble from which countless busi-
ness and professional men suffer these
strenuous days. Dr. Collins, of Mac-
quarie-street (consulting physician to the
R.A.N.), found that he “only needed a
short period of light duty to be com-
pletely restored to health.” And a medi-
cal board of three senior M.Os. which
was appointed later to consider the con-
sulting physician’s report agreed and
recommended “three months’ shore ser-
vice.”
That he was denied this chance to
save his career, his reason and, in the
last resort, his life is due to a condition
of affairs which is common knowledge in
the R.A.N., but which ranks and ratings
dare not make public. Cases such as his
are not dealt with in practice by the
Naval Board, much less by the Defence
Minister, but by civilians. The figure-
heads know nothing of the inside history
of the department, and they never learn
anything till there is a press or Parlia-
mentary outcry. Then one of them —
the Minister, as a rule —sends along a
“Please Explain”; the departmentalists
who were to blame issue their apologia;
and everything proceeds as before.
The fate that befel Lieut.-Commander
Casey may befall any boy who is sent
to Jervis Bay so long as the present sys-
tem prevails ; and the more highly strung
the boy is and the harder he works, the
likelier he will be to become a casualty.
It is the thoroughbreds that go till they
drop.
There is only one remedy. The execu-
tive branch of the R.A.N. must be staffed,
as far as may be, with men who know
the problems of naval men from personal
experience. The Minister, too, should
have at least some acquaintance with the
facts of life in our navy. The ineptitude
of Australia’s present Defence Minister
is a byword in this connection. He is
where he is solely because he happens
to be a shrewd party politician. The
humblest clerk that ever got a permanent
job on the beach is capable of pulling
the wool over his eyes on a Service
question. This is satisfactory to the

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Late Lieut.-Commander Casey.
The Minister for Defence (Senator
Pearce) writes: “I have had prepared a
statement, to which I shall be glad if
you will be good enough to give pub-
licity in The Bulletin.” The statement:
(1) In July, 1933, the late Lieutenant-Com-
mander Alan D. Casey reported to the medical
officer of his ship that he felt unable to carry
out his duties as squadron signal officer and
that he felt mentally exhausted. The medical
officer of his ship elicited from him that he
felt quite unable to concentrate on his work
for any considerable period, and that being on
the bridge caused him very considerable men-
tal anxiety. As a result this officer, who had
a history of nervous trouble, had to be re-
lieved of his appointment and brought for-
ward for medical survey.
(2) This medical survey was conducted by
three naval medical officers in August, 1933,
and Lieutenant-Commander Casey was granted
one month’s sick leave. At the beginning of
October, 1933, he was examined again by three
naval medical officers, who recommended that
he should be employed on shore service for
three months and then resurveyed. They re-
commended also that he should not be em-
ployed on specialist duties.
(3) In considering this recommendation, the
Naval Board were regretfully forced to the
conclusion that an officer who had twice had
a severe mental breakdown whilst carrying out
duties at sea did not reach the standard re-
quired of naval officers who might have to face
responsibilities involving the safety of ships
and the lives of those in them. Further, they
did not consider it justifiable to expose this
officer again to the identical conditions which
had already caused two nervous breakdowns.
(4) As the officer was below the naval physi-
cal standard, and not available for general
service, the naval regulations required that his
appointment be terminated, and he was dis-
charged four months after he had reported sick.
(5) There is no justification for the charge
in The Bulletin article that the discharge of
this officer was due to political economising,
nor for the attack on civilians in the Defence
Department. The case was purely a naval one
and. dealt with throughout by naval officers,
having regard to the physical standard required
for the naval service.
(6) The view of the writer of the article that
civil servants in the Defence Department
throughout Australia should be replaced by
retired soldiers, sailors and airmen betrays an
ignorance of the duties to be performed. Ex-
perience has proved that public servants are
necessary in the British War Office and the
Admiralty, and the same necessity exists in
Australia. Under the Government policy of
preference to returned men a large proportion
of civil servants in the department has had war
ser-vice.
(7) Lieutenant-Commander Casey joined the
Naval College in 1916. Allowing for four
years at the college his actual service Was a
little over 13 years. At the time of leaving
he was in receipt of £558 per annum. On re-
tirement he drew £985 as deferred pay and pay
in lieu of .extended leave. Deferred pay in the
navy takes the place of superannuation in the
other services.
These facts do not disclose any niggardliness
on the part of the Government.

Federal. Prospects.
The party position in Commonwealth
politics hasn’t been so disturbed since the
war. The U.A.P. has its schisms. Labor
in some States is so torn asunder that
its ragings sound like death-shrieks. The
C.P., especially in Victoria, is divided on
many questions, and its inter-State sec-
tions have an air of watching one an-
other distrustfully.
S. M. Bruce has arrived to become
the dominant figure. His voice is heard
above the strident controversy, enunciat-
ing a real policy of recovery. This un-
precedented spectacle of the lead in Aus-
tralia’s most vital affairs being given, not
by the nation’s official leader, the Prime
Minister, but by its unelected High Com-
missioner, is significant.
Immediate issues have boiled down to
two: (1) Whether or not Mr. Lyons shall
remain in the leadership ; (2) when the
election is to be. Supporters of Mr.
Lyons take the stand that Mr. Bruce,
thanks to the depression, can’t afford to
take the Prime Ministership. It shows
both a tacit willingness to admit his
superiority as a leader and a lack of
knowledge of his character. Presumably,
had Mr. Lyons not made him High Com-
missioner when The Bulletin first urged
that he should be Prime Minister, he
would have gone on living in London
on an honorary Minister’s salary. So
the first contention doesn’t hold water.
In any event, if the call were imperative
enough, money wouldn’t stand in the
way.
With regard to the election date, Labor
is taking no chances, and behind all the
argument, which affects a relatively small
section of the Federal party, solid organ-
ising work is being done. U.A.P. can-
didates already have their nomination
forms out. It is known definitely that a
section of the Ministry is in favor of
fighting on a lavish Budget directly after
a short session designed to allow the
Government to window-dress its pro-
gramme.
This state of affairs strengthens the
need for unity and strong leadership on
the U.A.P. side. At present the con-
tending sections are like rival fire
brigades struggling for the same hose.
If they don’t see reason quickly, the elec-
tors are going to get badly burnt.
»
Cancer Research.
“Deep Ray”: The Bulletin is to be
congratulated on its leader “Cancer Re-
search Lags” (B. 28 / 3/’34). The public
cannot be told too much about cancer
treatment, and your criticism is well
founded and salutary. There is urgent
need for more co-operation between the
various groups concerned. These are,
firstly, the importers and manufacturers
of high-voltage X-ray machines, and,
secondly, the physicists employed by
them to direct construction. Thirdly,
there are the academic university
research physicists, and, fourthly, the
medically qualified radiologists, concerned
with actual treatment. Correlation may
be difficult, but should be possible.
Most malignant growths are deep-
seated. Up to the present it has always
been difficult to give a dose of radiation
sufficient to destroy the deep-seated
cancer cells without permanently injuring
the skin and other tissues in the way.
This problem seems to be well on the
way towards solution.
All radiation for treatment purposes is
filtered, i.e., the rays are made to pass
before reaching the skin through alumi-
nium and copper screens which absorb
“soft” rays in the X-ray beam, and
allow the “hard” rays, of very short
wave-length, to pass.
It is almost certain that, when we
develop a standard, correct and copious
filtration technique, massive doses of
X-ray of very short wave-length may be
delivered to the growth, wherever
situated, without damaging normal parts
of the body.
This is the work which is being done
by practising radiologists themselves, but
it must be remembered that they can
only proceed very slowly and cautiously,
since their only guide is their own re-
sults. The latest literature from America
still speaks of filtration through \ milli-
metre of copper and 1 millimetre of
aluminium, whereas radiologists in
Sydney are already using 2, 3 and even 4
millimetres of copper in actual treatment
cases. In this respect, anyhow, the
malignant growths of Australians are
being treated by methods which are more
advanced than those of the rest of the
world.
♦
What About Australians?
The mentality of some of the people
who yearn to see Australia a smiling
chessboard of farms is extraordinary.
Their schemes usually take the form of
plans to import millions of immigrants
and train them ; and they are nearly
always illustrated with a map of Aus-
tralia with European countries super-
imposed on it and a caption which tells
the British that this continent could hold
about 300,000,000 people.
So soon as the Englishman sees this
kind of appeal in the offing he leaves for
the nearest bar where he can smile in
privacy, but it doesn’t prevent more opti-
mists coming up in a few months’ time
with the same old nonsense.
In a plan which has reached The
Bulletin office it is proposed to train
boys, preferably with a little capital, and
dump them down on farms after train-
ing. This would
obviate the undesirability of bringing
British boys to Australia to compete with
the Australian unemployed for jobs.
Of course, the thing is to be done with
money raised wherever it can be got,
whether in Australia or in Britain.
The strange thing seems to be that
none of these enthusiasts thinks of put-
ting Australian boys on farms. Thou-
sands of young Australians who have
left school since the depression have no
work and would give their ears for the
chance. But so communalised has the
feeling become in the Commonwealth
that patriots apparently cannot vision any
future for a young Australian except-
work in a city not too far from the
picture-show. Farm and station life is
for. the hardy British.
♦
Restriction Nostrums.
Restriction has become a blessed word
with our patent-medicine politicians—the
men who have only to hear of a new
economic nostrum to become convinced
that it is a cure-all. Usually these depres-
sion cures have the same features as
those that the medical quacks mix: they
look impressive, but as curative agents
they are about as effective as water—
or gas.
A year or two ago inflation was the
cry. Now many of the inflationists of
1931 wouldn’t be seen dead with the
device. Similarly, those who to-day are
anxious to destroy necessaries to keep up
prices will guffaw at the idea five years
hence when Stalin, or somebody suffi-
ciently remote, has invented another
lightning remedy for the world’s ills.
British Minister for Agriculture Elliot
seems to lean towards further restriction
of Dominion imports when the Ottawa
pact expires in a few months. It is no
reason why this country should draw in its
horns. In the first place, restriction on
imports finds its own level when operated
by lending countries. Goods pay most
of our oversea debts, gold being merely
a discrepancy medium which makes up
the balance when there is not enough in
the way of goods to meet the obligation.
Secondly, there is room to increase the
local consumption of local products by
adjustment to the capacity of the pub-
lic purse. Thirdly, even within restricted
quotas, there is a chance to expand estab-
lished markets by improving the quality
of our output. The best in any market
always has an assured sale at a high
price ; it is the poor stuff that goes to
the wall. Lastly, there is the East, which
is only beginning to appreciate the taste of
meat, butter, jams, white flour and other
commodities which we can produce in
abundance. Some Australian firms have
found markets in Asia which would
astonish the doubters. One Australian
soft drink, for example, has a virtual
monopoly throughout India.
A restriction policy applied to a coun-
try like Australia would be an admission
that we had reached the limit of our
development, and any doubter who has
been bitten by the Rooseveltian bug need
only look at the United States with its
120,000,000 people, and at Europe with
more than twice as many, to see how
idiotic such a suggestion is.

The New German Navy.
“The naval correspondent of the ‘Daily
Telegraph’ says that German plans for a big
navy, second to none, have been fully pre-
pared.”—Cable.
“F.X.M.”: The victors of the World War
exacted reparations from Germany for
material damage done. Germany did not
pay this penalty. It was paid mainly by
the Americans and partly by the English.
In the words of Belloc:
The Germans borrowed money from the
Americans and English and with this
money they paid England and France their
reparations; the English and French, out
of the reparation money they received, paid
back by annual instalments the money
they had borrowed from the Americans in
order to carry on their defence against
German aggression, and they kept back
a fraction to repair the damage done by
the enemy.
It is common knowledge that after a
few years the Germans refused to pay
reparations. Later they refused to pay
interest. The one remaining disability was
the loss of their colonies. The restoration
of European land to its owners in Alsace
and Poland was not a like loss. That, all
said and done, was but the restoration
of stolen property. The loss of army
power was only temporary. When I was
in Berlin 12 months ago it was univer-
sally agreed that, with England’s support
and a united Reich, Germany would be
rearmed in two years. A united Reich
is now actively carrying out that dream
of equality in arms, and in 12 months
the German land armament will approxi-
mate that of her rivals and neighbors
in big guns, field guns, bombing ’planes
and tanks.
But the loss of the colonies, which
were the lifeblood of the old Empire,
rankles. The German people believe they
must recover these, and, having recovered
them, maintain and exploit them if Ger-
many is to be Germany again. For this
purpose the new Reich has planned to
build a fleet equal at least to the R.N.
in direct offensive range and power, and
capable through numerous lesser craft
of threatening Britain’s raw materials and
food.
The building of such a fleet and the
subsequent demand for the restoration
of Germany’s former colonies will, of
course, be preceded by solemn declara-
tions that nothing to the detriment of the
British Empire is intended. The situa-
tion supplies the answer to anyone cap-
able of thinking realistically. Britain
alone holds permanently German goods
acquired by force as the result of war.
Goods, Germany believes, which can be
recovered when the proper instrument is
in German hands. That instrument is
the new German fleet.
It is odd, in the circumstances, to find
conservative politicians in Australia
whittling down the strength and morale
of the R.A.N. by every means in their
power, and Labor politicians urging
young Australians to swear they will
never fight for Australia overseas.

The Wearing of the Shirt*
A few years ago the shirt had
only a regional significance: worn in-
side the trousers it was of the West;
outside, of the East. Its colors were no
more than social signposts: red for
bushrangers, goldminers and Australian
movie farmers; blue for rockchoppers
and Persians; black for garage em-
ployees ; white for shopwalkers and
bank clerks, and so on. But the old
order is changing to such an extent that
soon citizens will have to carry color-
cards in order to identify friends and
foes, and submit to eye-tests to save
themselves from walking, color blind, into
ambushes.
As the political arguments get fiercer
camouflage, no doubt, will be introduced.
In Ireland, a shamrock pattern for
enemy-stalking may come into vogue.
At present Sir Oswald Mosley has only
reached the stage where he disguises the
motor-lorries which play Troy horses
to his propagandists as furniture vans.
He and his followers may yet be seen
doing espionage work at Bolshie meet-
ings in frock coats, the garb of unwar-
like undertakers and aldermen.
Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland
already forbid shirts. The Free State
has restricted them—which means that,
if you are for Mr. de Valera, you can
wear one; if you disapprove of him,
you can’t. The same in Italy, Germany
and Austria.
Britain, under Section 16 of the Cor-
rupt and Illegal Practices Act, clearly
has power to forbid the exploitation of
shirts for political purposes. Flags, ban-
ners, cockades, ribbons and other marks
of distinction may not be purchased to
forward a candidate’s election, and, when
in Walsall in 1892 a committee bought a
couple of thousand hat cards bearing a
picture of their man and an invitation
to vote for him, the election was de-
clared void.
The practice of using shirts as uniforms
is extremely dangerous. Witness a recent
threat made by Sir Stafford Cripps:
I do not believe in private armies, but
if the Fascists started one it might be
necessary for the Socialist and Communist
parties to do the same.
In other words, shirt rule is liable to
lead to mob rule. The plaintive Song of
the Shirt may change at any moment to
a bloodthirsty Hymn of Hate.

How to Kill Communism.
“El V.”: If Moscow has a sense of
humor it must laugh at the efforts of
the Lyons Government to destroy Com-
munism in Australia.
So far they have merely resulted
in the reorganisation of the party.
It has become more specialised and
all but its vital functions have been
shed on to the shoulders of other
bodies. The Minority Movement has so
interwoven itself with the unions that
to stamp it out would be to stamp out
some of the unions. The “Profintern”
bodies have multiplied tenfold behind
subsidiary objectives. Newspapers have
split their territories to make way for
new local papers, and, after two years
of repression, there are at least five Com-
munist type headquarters operating, for
each one which existed when Mr.
Latham began to “smash Communism”
two years ago.
The pamphlet business flourishes —-
over 200 Communist pamphlets issued
within the last two years are on sale in
Sydney to-day, and since Mr. Lyons gave
the matter his attention a lot of them
have crept into the capitalist bookshops
which would not handle them before.
The Friends of the Soviet Union have
gone into the publishing business on a
fairly large scale under the disguise of
“Modern Publishers,” and are turning
out numbers of local editions of Moscow
booklets.
The best way to kill Communism in
Australia is to put every worker
into employment. Mostly the party’s
ideas have flourished, and its grip
has tightened on bodies like the Lang
party, because it appeals to Goul-
burn-street as something that annoys the
enemy in Bligh-street. If Mr. Lyons,
instead of amending the Crimes Act, were
to issue a rescript commending the Com-
munist policy hundreds of its followers
would resign. And if Mr. Horsfield, the
N.S.W. secretary of the U.A.P., could
contrive to take a different sub-Com-
munist president to lunch every day,
extremist organisations would die like
flies.
But a lot of U.A.P. organisers and
patriotic bodies who live by inculcating
the fear of extremism into the stout Aus-
tralian heart wouldn’t like that. Exit
Communists, exit jobs! Exit also that
fine election cry: “Beware of the Reds!”

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE’S INKS"
“Moturoa”: A probationary constable
was imported from Wellington to help
in the undoing of the s.-p. lawbreakers
at New Plymouth. For a fortnight he
made himself popular in tobacconists’
shops and billiard-rooms, and when race-
day came round he approached an agent
and asked what he was laying about the
double. “Thirty-three to one, bar two,”
was the reply. “What two are you bar-
ring?” asked the prospective client. “You
and the blanky sergeant!” snapped the
other. The cop was returned to his
training depot next day.

“Waiwera”: War-time gear, is it (B.
14/3/’34)? Mine was issued during the
years 1899-1902. A recent kit inspection
brought to light a pair of bright and
shining spurs that look good for another
“What kind of dog is he?”
“A police dog.”
“He doesn’t look like one.”
“No. He’s in the secret service.”
couple of decades. Also present and cor-
rect was a pair of leather leggings, still
fit for parade during the shooting season,
A few strings were all that was left of
a flannel cholera belt, but the field dress-
ing had lasted much better. An emer-
gency ration, consisting of soup and
cocoa in solid form, is probably the only
one in M.L. It is still intact in its metal
container, and the printed instructions
are legible. A faded discharge and
the Queen’s medal complete the outfit.

“Jackdaw”: “Tukan Kaban” isn l
quite accurate regarding H.M.S. Cadmus
and the Singapore mutiny (B. 4/4/’34).
The hold-up had been in progress nearly
60 hours when the Cadmus, in response
to a vyreless call, raced into Singapore
and landed a detachment. The mutineers
did get into Singapore—and all over the
island as well. They shot a police inspec-
tor in front of the Central Police Bar-
racks and several civilians in different
parts of the city. Neither side had
gained the upper hand until the Cadmus
arrived, and the weight of the naval
party settled matters. Incidentally, the
civilian population was thirsting for
mutineers’ gore, and was allowed to
form the firing squad for the first batch
to be executed. The civilians bungled
the job, and an officer had to finish it
with a revolver. There were no more
civvy firing squads.

“The Youngest Inhabitant”: Victoria
certainly gave the Empire vote by ballot
(B. 4/4/’34), but it beat S'. Aus. to the
honor by only 14 days. The advocacy
of this system originated in the latter
colony in 1851, but, despite a spate of
petitions, it wasn’t until April 2, 1856,
that it became law. On March 19 Vic-
toria had adopted the system. But Vic.
wasn’t the first to introduce manhood
suffrage. S. Aus. beat her by a year,
introducing it in 1856, and was also the
first colony to extend the franchise to
women, in 1894.

“Harold Hardupp”: When a witness
in a Sydney court mentioned that he was
born at Lunatic the Court laughed. Yet
quite a few infants were born at Lunatic
in the palmy days of this mining hamlet
when it was sufficiently populous to
support 19 pubs besides unlicensed
groggeries. It was named after an
old-time digger who was regarded
as madder than usual when he set
out to prospect an unpromising spot
30 miles from Tenterfield (N.S.W.); but
the “Lunatic rush” started from his dis-
covery. Like many other mining settle-
ments, Lunatic has long since disappeared
from the map.

“King’s Inns”: The “verge of the
palaces” (B. 4/4/’34) takes no cognisance
of Buckingham Palace at all. In -London
the palace “verge” extends only 200 yards
beyond the gates of the old Palace of
Whitehall. Incidentally, out of London’s
7566 pubs, six are within the jurisdiction
of the palace, and the licensing authority
is the King himself. These six licenses
are granted by the Board of Green Cloth,
which is a committee of the royal house-
hold attached to the Department of the
Lord Steward.

“Findy”: An application was recently
made before the S.A. Full Court to have
a by-law of the District Council of
Orroroo in regard to street hawking de-
clared invalid. Counsel remarked that
“So Elma’s boy-friend has turned her down.
How’s she taking it?”
“Right to her lawyer.”
the object of tne by-law was “Orroroo for
the Orrorooians.” Which recalls that
many years ago, in reply to a request
from this town for increased postal
facilities, Sir Charles Todd, then Post-
master-General, told the residents that
they were already very well served, con-
sidering there were only two letters in
the whole town.
“Bumpkin”: When
“W.H.M.” saw a carload of
motorists vomiting on the
Apollo Bay-to-Colac road
(Vic.), he was hasty in
diagnosing their trouble as
hairpin-bend sickness ; they
may have lunched off con-
taminated tinned tongue. 1
have travelled the route
several times and did not
find it any more corkscrewy
than a hundred other Aus-
tralian roads, nor did I hear
that mal de route was a
local ailment. The nearest
approach to Katzenjammer
in the way of thoroughfares
I have ever sampled is the
road from Pompeii to Sor-
rento, along the coast lead-
ing to the Bay of Naples.
The chauffeur was our old
friend Beelzebub, though
the tourist bureau intro-
duced him as “vair’ safe
driver,” an ex-soldier and
the most careful driver in
the Italian Army. He took
the switchbacks at a speed
that left us no leisure for
the contemplation of the
scenery. Add to this that
all Italian roads contain to
the chain 14 goats, 12 cows,
seven oxen with waggon,
19 blind and deaf old
women carrying baskets on
their heads, 73 children
playing morra, and fowls,
dogs and cats to taste. Also
sundries.
“Gunner No. 2”: I can assure
“Gunner” (B. 4/4/’34) that there are a
good many ex-A.I.F. men who have seen
an enemy ’plane hit by a shell from an
anti-aircraft battery. In September, 1917,
Several members of the Ist Section, Ist
D.A.C., including myself, were standing
outside our billets at Ouderdom when
an Archie battery, stationed near Halle-
bast Corner, went into action against an
enemy two-seater ’plane which appeared
to be at an elevation of about 16,000
feet. The shooting was so accurate that
the ’plane went into a spinning nose-
dive and crashed somewhere between
Dickebusch and the front line; both
occupants of the ’plane were dead when
the ’plane reached the ground. About
a week later we saw a German ’plane
flying over Vlamertinghe engaged by
an Archie battery located near Poper-
inghe ; again a direct hit was scored,
which brought the ’plane down in flames.
Prior to these demonstrations of effi-
ciency, there were many, like “Gunner,”
who insisted that the Archies were in-
capable of hitting a ’plane. Many im-
provements in range-finders, gun-sights,
etc., for anti-aircraft batteries have been
made since the war, and there is no
doubt that Uncle Sam’s gunners in the
film mentioned were equipped with all
the latest gadgets.
“4 x 2”: “Gunner” evidently wasn’t on
the Somme in June, 1916. There I saw
a venturesome German ’plane struck by
the third shot from an A.-A. gun. It
turned the ’plane upside down and dis-
lodged the pilot, who turned over and
over like a trench-mortar shell, finally
straightening out in a long dive earth-
ward. At “Plug-street” Wood, in the
following September, the seventh shell
from an Archie appeared to hit an enemy
’plane ; the pilot temporarily lost con-
trol, but flattened out at about 100 feet
and flew over a line of gun-pits under
construction with the observer grinding
manfully at a camera. We cheered the
gunners —and ended by cheering the pilot,
too.

“Gumblegubbin”: Monotonous com-
plaints about the bad state of the roads
and streets are the common experience of
municipal councils, but there was once
a part of Newcastle (N.S.W.) where the
worse the thoroughfare got the better
satisfied were the residents. It was
traversed by waggons laden with coal,
and every bump over the lumps and
hollows dislodged some fuel. Women
waited behind their gates with brooms
and buckets to gather it up, and one old
granny who didn’t consider the road
rough enough in front of her place kept
a lump of iron in a shallow depression
to give the loads a still more remunerative
shaking. The complaints were loud and
shrill when the road was repaired, and
the alderman who represented the district
lost his job over it.

“Lao-dah”: If Susama Mukerji lands
first at Essendon in the London-Mel-
bourne centenary air race her reception
from a warm-hearted and responsive
public will probably make Amy Johnson’s
look like a snub. Miss Mukerji is 21,
good-looking and a Bengali. She recently
created nation-wide enthusiasm by flying
round India in a record number of hops.
Amongst the committee of Bengal mag-
nates who are financing the damsel is
poet Sir Rabindranath Tagore.
I DREAMED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dreamed sworn foes in various lands
Would fight no more like demons;
Valera grasped O’Duffy’s hands
And Owen grappled Eamonn’s,
While Jimmy Thomas, nothing loath
(Theme for an artist’s panel),
Benevolently beamed on both
Across St. George’s Channel.
1 dreamed that love a way had found
To cut foul hatred’s latchets
And, all the weary world around,
Was burying of hatchets;
The trade grew slack in gun and tank,
The glamor fled from khaki,
And Russ to Jap in vodka drank
And Jap to Russ in sak6. >
I dreamed that Peace was here again
And none would dare belittle her;
Hitler to Dolfuss drained a stein
And Dolfuss toasted Hitler.
The wine of life we bards consume
Once more was red and bubbling,
And even Inge forbore to gloom
And Gandhi ceased from troubling.
I dreamed that feuds which sting and stick
Were dead as Tutankhamen,
And foes of yesterday as thick
As Pythias and Damon.
I dreamed it would be here anon,
The same judicious notion
That Smuts and Hertzog hit upon
Across the Indian Ocean.
I dreamed, their passions held in check,
Forgotten all their rages,
That Lang had fall’n on Scullin’s neck
And Lyons upon Page’s.
I dreamed their faces, furthermore,
With joyful tears were streaming....
And then at last, but not before,
1 knew that I was dreaming.

T. THE R.


“A Major”: A thing that gets my goat
is the extent to which Australians are
enslaved to the notion that music was
invented in Europe, and that European
schools of music are the only ones that
can turn out good teachers and solo
performers. We have two conserva-
toriums in Melbourne, one in Adelaide
and one in Sydney that have been operat-
ing for years and years, mostly with
locally-trained teachers, but still Australia
spends more each year on listening to
opera singers from Italy and violinists
and pianists from Germany, Russia
and Austria than it does upon en-
couraging its own youngsters. Now
Melb. Uni. Con. has engaged Jascha
and Tossy Spivakovsky, and is said
to be endeavoring to entice Edmund
Kurtz from Prague. The trio undoubtedly
makes a very effective chamber-music
combination, and I presume it is being
imported to make Con. concerts more

“Sorry, I’ve no time to spar.”
ain sea-mews”? We have managed to
produce a Melba (and quite a dozen
other first-rank sopranos), at least three
pianists who command respect every-
where save in their own country (I’m
not counting the two who have left it),
two splendid tenors, the world’s most
popular baritone and a wealth of the in-
strumental talent that goes to make up
an orchestra (ask the A.B.C. about that!).
As to teachers, there are a dozen to my
knowledge (and I know only two States)
who are as competent, judging by exami-
nation and other results, as the best any-
where. Musically, Australia is myopic.

“Long-Un”: But are twins really twins
when born days or weeks apart (B.
21/3 /’34)? The Maoriland Government
gives a bonus of £6 to contributors to
the State provident fund on the birth of
a child, but it is expressly laid down that
when twins are born the cash allowance
is not enhanced. The Crown Law De-
partment has defined twins as “children
born of the same mother within 24 hours
one of the other.” Some years ago a
father of a newly-born pair presented an
application on behalf of each unit of
his offspring, accompanied by medical
testimony that one boy was 48 hours
younger than the other. It was a new
point, and the Law wrestled with it for
days. Eventually, however, both claims
were allowed, and a proud parent col-
lected £l2.

“Anser”: The resuscitation of the
black swan for armorial purposes by the
Westralian secessionists recalls that the
bird which cut such an artistic figure on
the colony’s postage stamps in pre-
Federation days has become exceedingly
rare, if not extinct, on the river to which
it gave a name. It has always been a
decorative, as well as a distinctive, em-
blem. There was once an Under-Secre-
tary for Lands with a smattering of the
classics who evolved a play upon words
out of the Latin name of the fowl, of
which he was immensely proud. West-
ralia was a land “cygnis insignis”—“dis-
tinguished for swans” —he would explain
learnedly, and for years the more or less
felicitous slogan figured on the Lands
Department’s voluminous publications—
probably it does yet. It was a pretty
vile pun, and I suspect the Latin of being
the sort which Oxford professors would
stigmatise as post-Augustine, but Perth
hadn’t a university in those days, so it
didn’t matter.
“L. 1.8.”: The returned soldier who
dreamed that the Turks were bomb-
ing him out of the trenches and only
woke up as he was mounting a vision-
ary steed (B. 11/4/’34) must have be-
longed to that famous old corps the
Horse Marines. The Light Horse didn’t
take their neddies to Gallipoli, and, in the
few instances where they had to occupy
trenches and sangars in the Sinai-Pales-
tine campaign, the mounts were too far
back to give anyone a chance of mount-
ing in hot haste, as described.
* * * *
“Mells”: “Fighting with bottles! I’ll
teach him to fight with bottles,” says
Uncle Jim in Wells’s “Mr. Polly.” It
is further recorded that Uncle, having
had the advantage of a reformatory edu-
cation, proceeded to show the right way
of making a bottle into a lethal weapon.
This consists of breaking off the body of
the beer-container and converting the
mouth and neck into a short poniard for
jabbing purposes. The technique is
well understood by the Australian thug.
“An’ what might you two be?”
“Fancy a big boy like you not knowin' that!”
Extract from the evidence in a Melbourne
criminal case:
Ward struck Lehman on the head with
a bottle of beer; the bottle broke and with
the jagged neck the prisoner inflicted
severe wounds on the shoulder, arms and
chest of the prostrate man.
Judge Woinarski signalised his opinion of
the bottle-neck as an implement of street
warfare by awarding the wielder two
years and 12 strokes of the cat. Isn’t it
about time some enterprising brewery
company invented a bottle that would be
of less use for barbarous belligerent pur-
poses?

“A.H.S.”: Asked by a visiting teacher
what Easter was significant of, a Gipps-
-1 and child thought deeply for a second,
and then came to light with “Please, sir,
chocolate eggs and the Stawell Gift.”

“Selma”: I never had much opinion
of chaperons myself (B. 4/4/’34), my
early youth having been blighted by the
goings-on of one of them. During the
Edwardian era we were permitted to
attend a small and select weekly dance
at which Aunt Louisa acted as chaperon.
One evening Aunt felt unwell and decided
to go home, having deputed her task to
a sprightly young matron present. As
dutiful nieces we escorted Aunt Louisa
to her cab, and had just reached the gate
when we dimly beheld a masculine arm
encircling a white waist. Aunt, horrified
beyond speech, clutched us silently, when
a cheerful voice came from the darkness.
“Don’t worry,” it said, “I’ll look after
things for you.” It was the emergency
chaperon. Aunt sternly bade us get our
wraps and then swept us into the cab
with her. It was our last appearance at
the festive dance.

“Hugh G.”: Luck plays a big part in
the life of the average rattler-jumper.
When “Slim” missed the Townsville
goods he missed his rations, and the sym-
pathetic baker who gave him a couple of
hours’ woodchopping was nevertheless
a hard man. Therefore when “Slim”
broke the axe-handle on the last billet of
wood his employer handed him a mere
two shillings, explaining that the cost of
the handle was deducted from his pay.
“Slim,” after cursing the world and the
baker, decided that the two bob was a
negligible buffer between himself and
starvation, and forthwith made for the
Chinamen’s fan-tan school, where in the
course of three hours’ play he turned his
two shillings into £5O! He threw his
swag away, bought a suit of clothes,
and next day paid his fare to Innisfail,
where he confided to me it was his im-
mediate intention to “start in business.”
A fortnight passed before I saw “Slim”
again. Broke to the wide once more, he
was aboard a rattler making for Mt. Isa.
* * * *
“Farleigh”: It was in a Sydney libel
case the other day that the plaintiff, who
had been charged with using indecor
ous language in his capacity of mayor,
demurred to the word “guttersnipe” being
regarded as unmunicipal. “It is in the
English language,” he told counsel indig-
nantly ; “I have heard actors use it on
the stage.” As to the precise amount of
abusiveness conveyed by “guttersnipe,”
opinions vary. Webster defines it as “a
person of the gutter, a rag-picker or street
Arab,” but gives as a quite respectable
secondary meaning (in the U.S.) “a
curbstone broker.” I have heard a
man referred to as “a gutter broker” in
Australia without a trace of contumely.
On the other hand, Fergus Hume, in
“The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,” intro-
duced a Mother Guttersnipe who was a
particularly unengaging person.

“Pawang”: Voluntary workers have
previously supplied the Victorian blind
with their reading matter, and now they
are to have a press. It is the invention of
Miss M. Crabb, the librarian of the Vic.
Association of Braille Workers, and is
claimed to be the only Braille printer in
the Southern Hemisphere. The problem
was to produce a machine in which
Braille type could be set in place with
reasonable expedition, and be used
as often as required. Miss Crabb
went into conference with H. Hulme, a
Melbourne engineer, and with financial
assistance from the “Argus” made a first-
rate job of it. Braille printers used to be
manufactured at a factory in France
which was destroyed by a bomb during
the war, since when the price has been
prohibitive.
* * * *
“Bummalo”: I have just been reading
the complaint of an Australienne, now
resident in India, that, though she had
become intensely fond of curry, on her
return to Australia for a visit she failed
to find even a similitude of the real thing.
My own experience is the same ; I have
long realised the wisdom of avoiding the
dish on the menus of even the swagger
Sydney caravanserais. The plat is invari-
ably a viscous slodge of a pale-yellow
color with chunks of meat, or it may be
fish or prawns, embedded therein, and a
tiny backing of rice boiled to a gluelike
consistency. It tastes like nothing else on
earth. There are probably as many
curries in India as there are gods in the
Hindu pantheon—writer alone has some
30 pukka recipes from various quarters
of Hind and Eastern Asia. Surely our
hotels could hand a few of these—easily
available from abroad—to their alleged
chefs. Better still, they should import a
Goanese curry cook and earn the heart-
felt thanks of many curry-addicts starv-
ing in this land of plenty.
THE MUSICAL BOOK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The first lady street-bookie to appear before a
Police Court pleaded guilty in a deep musical
voice at Sydney Central and was fined £20.”
She laid the odds, as smartly and acutely,
I’ll bet, as any trousered Ikey Mo;
Nathless she had to do it dumbly, mutely—
The game’s verboten in the streets, you know.
Each year some woman climbs to plant her
flag on
Some peak where men have sat aloof, like
gods;
And, though you couldn’t say she put the bag
on,
She laid the odds.
She made a book. Loser she laid and winner,
The roughie and the cert, that sometimes
flops;
She might, for all one knows, have had a
skinner
Excepting for the unquixotic cops.
Hence ’twas the puissant Law that did the
shearing
For an olfence it couldn’t overlook;
But anyhow she did some pioneering:
She made a book.
A flutelike voice, clear as a mellow ousel’s,
Was that wherein she owned her rash
emprise;
And now her book will have no more perusals
From constables’ unsympathetic eyes.
Licensed, she might have been a boon, a
blessing,
A racecourse novelty supremely choice.
The first of all the strident tribe possessing
A flutelike voice.
She laid the field. So one at least supposes,
And ev’ry bit as deftly, it would seem,
As bellowing pencillers with beaky noses
And hoarse Leviathans in suits that scream.
For me, I find these booming basses get so
Monotonous, wherever odds are pealed,
I’d welcome a contralto or a mezzo
To lay the field.

POLITICAL POINTS
British Budget proposals, following the
declaration of a bumper surplus, may
provide income-tax reduction of 6d. in
the £, restoration of civil-service salaries
to pre-1931 level, increase of unem-
ployment insurance benefit and of
unemployment children’s allowance and
a cut in entertainment tax. Even with
this, there will probably be another
surplus this year, though United States
debt payments will again be made in
token form.
Queensland’s deficit for nine months is
£1,211,744. So it will probably be short
all of its expected £1,800,000 deficiency
at the end of the year. It has £1,000,000
to collect to realise its estimated taxation
income, and it has eaten up £822,000 of
the £1,096,000 Commonwealth grant
which it gets under the financial agree-
ment. On the whole, its progress to-
wards economy is not such as might be
expected of the State with far and away
the best industrial position and lowest
unemployment in the Commonwealth.
There were enough youngsters born in
Sydney in March (1436) to populate a
fair-sized rural town, and enough people
died there to fill a decent-sized grave-
yard—B99. The Great Wen’s natural
increase (births minus deaths) is less than
half what it was ten years ago, when its
population was 25 p.c. less than it is
now, and, with more than half the
people of the State crammed into its
environs, it provides only 6693 new citi-
zens p.a. net against 16,855 net provided
by the country districts. In other words,
country districts outside the County of
Cumberland add one new inhabitant per
annum for every 71.5 of population, while
Sydney and its crowded surroundings add
only one for every 209 inhabitants. We
seem to be losing at least 10,000 new
Australians per annum in N.S.W. alone
through squeezing ourselves into big
cities.
“Oxon’s” diagnosis:
Last week the Union of University Liberal
Societies in conference at Glasgow “over-
whelmingly rejected a motion in no circum-
stances to fight for King and Country.” It is
an instance of the regional aspect of patriotism.
Glasgow teems with agitators like Jock Gar-
den and Donald Grant. Their rantings make
Imperialism seem sane and dignified. Oxford,
on the other hand, always has a number of
Empire lads who shout the platitudes of Jingo-
ism at the Union, and elsewhere, so persistently
that haters of cant get sick of them and their
doctrines. In consequence many members of
the Union become Bolshies-for-a-day, as it were,
and in this state of mind they are liable to vote
for pacifist or anti-monarchist resolutions. That
supreme debunker of bogus patriotism the late
C E. Lawrence often remarked on the
phenomenon; also (vide “Fiery Particles”) on
the theoretical patriots’ habit of dodging the
firing-line. During the Boer War Kipling wrote
of them as “killing Kruger with their mouths.”
When Sydney Snow, the N. S. Wales
U.A.P. chairman, boasted last week that
Australia and Gt. Britain were the only
countries in the world to budget for a
current surplus, he forgot two unobtru-
sive sections of the Empire. De Valera,
in spite of his troubles, shows a balance
on the right side of nearly £4,000,000.
Also Ulster is a few thousands to the
good. In the Free State, where total
trade for the past year was only
£56,000,000 compared with £99,000,000
in 1931, a 12? p.c. surplus over revenue
seems, however, to be a luxury.
Brisbane City Council elections are
due on April 28. The Nat.-Progs. have
endorsed candidates for 18 of the 20
seats. They are doubtful about tackling
the Labor strongholds of Ithaca and For-
titude Valley, but if any Independent likes
to buck the Labor man at his own risk
they will lend him moral support.
Lord Mayor Greene is standing for his
present job—the voters will make the
choice at the polls this time. His
opponent is A. J. Jones, Minister for
Mines in more than one Labor Cabinet.
The N.S.W. Unemployment Relief
Council has allocated £8,500,000 to make
temporary employment, apart from
£2,500,000 raised as a special loan by the
Metropolitan Water Board. And a further
expenditure of £5,000,000 is contem-
plated. Most of it has gone, or is to go,
into cement dams and expensive roads.
The money would put 10,000 families on
decent farms. As it is, 75,000 men, equal
to 27 p.c. of all the male unionists in
N.S.W., are working wet cement and
bitterness into their souls, with no hope
for the future, while every pound the
Government spends on them buys a vote
against itself.
From “Whitehall”:
Lord O’Hagan moved in the House of Lords
last week that rodeos should be forbidden in
England “owing to the cruelty to animals
involved.” One of his lordship’s amusements
is given in “Who’s Who” as “shooting,” and
members of his family have been prominent in
the hunting-field. Later the House of Com-
mons agreed to the second reading of a
bill introduced by Sir Robert Gower
(chairman of the R.S.P.C.A.) banning rodeos.
(“Every speaker agreed that they were
cruel.”) It is in line with British tradition.
Over 50 per cent, of the members of the
R.S.P.C.A. advocate “blood sports.” They
believe in prosecuting a carter for driving a
lame horse, and they also believe in stag-
hunting, which some British humanitarians
find as hard to look at, in its final phases, as
MR. STIGGINS, M.F.H.
“The House of Commons has agreed to the second reading of a bill to ban rodeos.
Every speaker agreed that they were cruel.”
bullfight. To summarise their creed: No one
but a cad is capable of chasing and killing for
sport a domestic animal; no one but a cad is
capable of objecting to the chasing and killing
for sport of a wild animal.
The news that in Illinois (the first
American State to give a verdict on the
New Deal) “Democrats won the primary
elections by the largest vote in 50 years”
indicates that Roosevelt is doing better
than might be expected from our cables.
America is engaged in a war. The
chisellers —who correspond to Britain’s
profiteers and food-hoarders of 17 years
ago—and the conchie-politicians who
vote for pensions which must endanger
the national campaign are evidently out
of favor with the bulk of the electors.
The President’s triumph is all the more
remarkable seeing that he has no weapon
comparable to D.O.R.A. or Hughes’s
War Precautions Act. His is the only
dictatorship in the world without sanc-
tions: he can’t even censor the press.
There is a move in Brisbane to get
Donald Cameron to stand either for his
old Federal seat (Brisbane) or for Lilley,
a safe position soon to be vacated by
G. H. Mackay, who has sat for
it since 1917. In 1931 Cameron an-
nounced that, win or lose, it would be
his last shy at politics, and when defeat
came along he was content to accept the
verdict, for his war wounds still bother
him. The redistribution will throw most
of the Kelvin Grove subdivision of
Lilley into Brisbane, and this will make
it harder to shift George Lawson. An-
other suggestion is that Glasgow, for-
merly in the Senate, who was in com-
mand at Villers-Bretonneux, should take
Lilley, and that Cameron should go for
the Senate.
Commonwealth financing shows a sur-
plus of receipts of £1,986,000 for the nine
months ended in March, but this does
not take into account liability to the
wheatgrowers. Mr. Lyons budgeted for
£3,000,000 for wheatgrowers’ relief, but
half this amount is expected to be re-
couped by special taxation, on account
of which £BOO,OOO has been received and
£423,000 expended. It is expected that
estimated expenditure provided in the
Budget will be accurate over the whole
year, though it is, pro rata, now
£2,200,000 below the nine months’ quota.
Taxation, however, is strongly buoyant,
and even with wheat payments to be
made the Government may run close to
having a surplus. Had the tax cut been
greater, however, increased trade and
employment would probably have as-
sured a credit balance.
A comic development in Free State
politics is the appearance of a breakaway
party which objects to De Valera for his
“accursed Imperialism.” It is led by
Peadar O’Donnell and General Price (of
the Republican Army), who are Bolshies.
To them De Valera is just a tricky poli-
tician who defies the Sassenach tyrant
and his out-of-date economic system
during elections, and as soon as the elec-
tions are over angles for the support of
Irish capitalists by angling for the Sas-
senach’s trade. This section is forecast-
ing bitterly that the one-time irreconcil-
able will be Sir Eamon before he dies.
The political prophets are busy already
forecasting changes at the next Federal
elections. In S.A. Gabb, the Indepen-
dent who opposed the salary grab, has
had his seat wiped out. The C.P. will
have to fight hard for Corangamite,
Hume and Calare, but may gain Indi and
perhaps Wannon and Bendigo. Natural
Labor seats like Maribyrnong and Bal-
larat, held by the ex-Labor men Fenton
and McGrath, might revert to their old
allegiance, and so might Barton, Lang,
Macquarie, South Sydney and Balmain.
Cabled that the International Wheat
Advisory Committee has “reached agree-
ment regarding minimum export prices”
without fixing a rigid minimum. The
thing is getting a little like the chronic
disarmament conferences —endless sit-
tings, soaring aspirations, dazzling in-
genuity startle the beholder while the
wheat-growers starve. While the inter-
national situation is indeterminate, the
Australian Royal Commission on Wheat
struggles to build some concrete scheme
of salvation for the Australian grower
on a foundation of shifting international
sand. Somebody at Canberra should
remember that in October last the Euro-
pean negotiation was considered by its
promoters as “likely to send wheat to a
minimum of 4s. a bushel in Australia.”
During the past few weeks a regular
budget of praise for Mr. Lyons and his
works has been distributed by the P.M.’s
Department “for favor of publication.”
While some bears the note that it is
“with the compliments of the Prime Min-
ister,” its lavish headings taper down to
the inscription “from a correspondent” to
give its flattery an independent look.
When Labor Governments began doing
this sort of thing a few years ago, no
party howled louder than the U.A.P., but
the U.A.P.’s converted Labor leaders
have changed all that.
“Veerkekker”: There has been a lot
of unnecessary fuss in the Australian
press over the announced Budget sur-
plus in South Africa. Finance Minister
Havenga says that, after the slate is
wiped, the surplus will be £4,400,000. He
forgot to mention that this is wholly due
to the surplus-profits tax imposed on the
goldmine last year, which has returned
£7,400,000. Not every Treasurer is
lucky enough to have a Rand to loot
when times elsewhere are stiff as broom-
sticks. Without the goldmines the
Union would be well in the soup, for,
apart from farming, it has no industry
worth mentioning, and South African
farmers, like those in most other coun-
tries, have been practically on the dole
for years.
The royal assent has been given to
the bill amending the Queensland Con-
stitution. It forbids the institution of a
Legislative Council or the extension of
the life of a Parliament until legislation
to that effect has been passed by Parlia-
ment and received the consent of the
people at a referendum. This will make
it much harder to restore a safeguarding
Chamber to the Legislature. The Moore
Government had the opportunity of again
setting up the bicameral system, in favor
of which the electors had voted at a pre-
vious referendum. Party intrigue and
jealousy prevented the presentation of a
bill to Parliament, though one had been
prepared. The Opposition in Queensland
has now more need than ever to go round
a corner and kick itself for the mess it
made of the business.
Calcutta’s municipal council has just
worked a joke which falls with a familiar
sound on the ears of Sydney ratepayers.
In an election for mayor the chairman
declared that all votes cast for one of
the two candidates were invalid and that,
therefore, one Fazlul Huq (an anti-British
Moslem and nominee of the chairman’s
party) was elected. It was pointed out
to the chairman that the Attorney-Gen-
eral of Bengal had given it as his opinion
that the discarded votes were valid. How-
ever, that made no difference, and Huq
will don the Calcutta equivalent of the
rabbitskins pending a High Court
appeal. Another reminiscent aspect of
the affair is the fact that Huq had to
retire from municipal office some time
ago because he was unwilling to face
charges of corruption. Some of our
municipal lights would consider him thin-
skinned.


“Don’t drivel about love to me, worm. Get an eyeful of real love.”
“It looks real: what’s going to get you into trouble is that it doesn’t
smell real.”
“Now, there’s what I call a real car, my boy!”
The patrons of Mrs. Hashtower’s establishment say they can’t
even get real steak.
THE SEARCH FOR REALITY.

Walford Davies, who gets the fine old
post (with much honor and hardly any-
thing to do) of “Master of the King’s
Musick,” is a brother of Prof. Harold
Davies, head of Adelaide University
Conservatorium. He is 65, a lifelong
organist and composer, and lately gave
up his professorship in Wales to devote
himself to broadcasting “music of the
right sort.”
Stephen Yorke, who has been engaged
as guest-conductor by the Broadcasting
Commission, is a Londoner. He enlisted
in the South Lancashire Regiment in
1908, served with it in England and Ire-
land, and in August, 1914, proceeded to
France. He fought at Mons and in
nearly all the major battles of the war
afterwards, and was awarded a D.C.M.
for his work in the line at the first battle
of Ypres. He got his musical training at
Kneller Hall under Captain Adkins, who
considers him one of the finest musicians
in the British Forces.
Irvine Douglas, who has resigned from
the “S.M. Herald” to become publicity
officer to Prime Minister Lyons, was a
clerk in the Commonwealth Bank before
resigning to join Melbourne “Age.” He
did “specials” for the “Age,” and repre-
sented it during the Duke of York’s tour
in 1927. He next joined Sydney “Sun,”
and for some months was acting-editor
of the “Sunday Pictorial.” He was in-
trigued by a beckoning nod from
The P.M.’s new publicity officer.
Granny’s bonnet three years ago, and
agreed to write her Federal gallery notes.
He is Federal vice-president of the
A.J.A., a director of the Sydney Press
Club, and president of the Canberra Dry
Fly Fishermen’s Club. Born in Zeehan,
Tas., he is 6ft. 3in., weighs 15st. 71b.,
was a rowing man and is a golfer—he
was first captain of Dee Why (N.S.W.)
golf club. Like his father, the late
Ronald Douglas, he has contributed to
The Bulletin.
R. C. Packer, who died abroad last
week, was one of Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
innumerable “Sunday Times” editors
during the war. At the same time C. E. F.
McKay, who had been a J.C.W. pub-
licity-hound, was doing war-loan pub-
licity work for Joynton Smith. The two
came together after the war and started
“Smith’s Weekly” on Joynton’s money. It
was a great success for a time. The
“Daily Guardian” was launched in
“Smith’s” heyday, and sold at a fantastic
price to the “Sun,” where Packer even-
tually went as managing editor. He had
great journalistic gifts of a sort —organis-
ing ability, energy and a keen sense of
what readers of the mental age of 15, or
less, want in the way of news and
stunts. He took up yachting recently, and
raced Morna with considerable success.
“X.T.”:
Walter Elliot, whose agricultural measures
have revivified British rural life and caused a
lot of concern to overseas producers, is- an
oddity. Most Scottish Ms.P. make their way
slowly, unless they have a social pull. Elliot
was a young doctor, who had spent the whole
of his four qualified years at the war, when he
was elected for Lanark as a Unionist in 1918.
In l'(>23, the year in which Glasgow University
made him a D.Sc., he changed his seat to
Kelvin Grove in the Glasgae suburbs, became
Parliamentary Secretary for Public Health for
Scotland and eventually Financial Secretary to
the Treasury. He looks dour, but as soon as
he begins to talk the dourness goes and his
listeners are smashed flat by the’ weight of his
ideas and the drive of his worcjs. He is what
Earle Page might be if Earle had had Scotch
parents and been fed on dynamite as a boy.
Henry Angus, the 69-year-old U.A.P.
member of the Vic. Assembly who died
in his sleep last week, had sat for Gun-
bower for 23 years in spite of vigorous
C.P. efforts to dislodge him. He was
an assistant Minister in the war-time
Bowser and Lawson Ministries, and presi-
dent of the Land Board and Minister
for Water Supply under McPherson.
His family came to Victoria in ’52, and
his father was in partnership for many
years with J. T. Tweddle, the stud cattle-
breeder. The son was a native of his
electorate, and his continual readiness to
fight for the farmers added to his popu-
larity.
Colin Gilray, M.A., who steps into
the late Dr. Littlejohn’s shoes as prin-
cipal of Scotch, Melbourne, was born in
Scotland and educated at Otago Univer-
sity, Dunedin. His father was a pro-
fessor there, and he left as a Rhodes
scholar. He did some schoolmastering
in London, qualified as a barrister, served
in France with the Rifle Brigade, re-
turned to the law in M.L. and then took
command of the John McGlashan Col-
lege. He is said to be one of the best
blends of brains and brawn that the
famous N.8.-M.L. firm has put forth.

Ernest Colclough. He came to it from
the Brisbane Grammar School 52 years
ago “clutching a letter from his head-
master which said he was a good boy
and worthy of a job.” Last week he
retired, clutching a substantial presen-
tation. Apart from being a leading ath-
lete and a prominent artist, E.C. has
always been noted for his humor. It
even survived his appointment as a
trustee of the Q. National Gallery.
Russell Martin, Victoria’s newly-
appointed Supreme Court Judge, be-
longs to a brilliant family. He is
a brother of Dr. Frank Martin,
of London; the founder of the
Swinburne Technical College at Glen-
ferrie (Vic.) was his father-in-law, and
the late Dr. John Tremearne, of Cres-
wick and Collins-street, was his uncle.
A distinguished cousin was Major A. J.
N. Tremearne, who became an authority
on Nigeria, wrote prolifically upon the
anthropology and folklore of northern
Africa generally, and was appointed Lec-
turer in Hausa at Cambridge, only to
be killed during the war.
“Kariah”: Hon. R. H. D. White was
another who read his own obituary
notice. My grandfather, as editor of the
“Mudgee Independent” (powerful enough
then to.be referred to from time to time
by The Bulletin), received word that
the old boy had passed out, and the next
issue contained an eloquent effort in
praise of the town’s greatest benefactor.
Unfortunately I have no record of what
R.H.D. said to my grandfather on the
subject.
The Engineering Doctorate handed to
George Kenneth Williams the other day
was only the second to issue from Mel-
bourne Uni. John Monash won the
other. Dr. Williams got his for a thesis
on his 14 years’ experiments in lead-
refining processes at the 8.H.A.5., Port
Pirie. On the same day he was awarded
the Kernot Medal for outstanding engi-
neering feats. He went to Wesley from
the Bacchus Marsh State school (where
his father was_ h.t.) and to the Varsity
on a scholarship.

Just as George Lambert, Douglas
Fry and Frank Mahony specialised in
horses so Syd Miller, here depicted by
’cnprinlicfx; in zoological and farm-
Frith, specialises in zoological ana iarm
yard studies. He is a Sydneysider in his
early thirties, who went to Fort-street
High School, passed out to a job in the
process-engraving department of The
Bulletim, and later joined the art staff of
SYD MILLER, caricaturist of birds,
men and other animals.
Smith and Julius. Those who want to
see what he can do as a caricaturist
should visit Nock and Kirby’s, near
Market-street, this week. Miller has
an exhibition of caricatures there, most
of which are a joy to the eye. The pro-
ceeds go to the Crown-street Women’s
Hospital.
Jimmy Richards, the veteran whip who
drove a coach at the opening of Sydney
Harbor Bridge, has died. He handled
the ribbons of a Cobb and Co. Temora
coach in the gold-rush of half a century
ago. Other experiences include running
into the fight between the Faithfulls and
the bushrangers Hall, Gilbert and Dunn
(when he got a Blighty in the knee), and
taking Moonlight and Rogan to the
Cootamundra gaol after they were cap-
tured at Wantabadgery. He is one of
the few coachmen who can claim to have
driven ten-in-hand. The ten horses were
attached to a coach which carried 65
grand-opera singers about the goldfields.
Hobart is taking a good man from
Adelaide in P. C. Greenland, who is to
be secretary to the island’s W.E.A. As
an undergrad, he won the Poetry prize
at Adelaide ’Varsity, and he has lately
got his M.A. for a thesis on “Restora-
tion” lyrics. He has been lecturer to the
W.E.A. on literature; also secretary to
the University Union and to its Sports
Association. And he’s only 29.
Rev. Moontai Sim, one of the few
Koreans to became a Presbyterian min-
ister, is booked to enter Ormond Col-
lege, Melbourne, for a special 12*months’
course in youth welfare and theological
studies. He is a graduate of the Takai
Academy, Korea. Most of his work at
home has had to do with Sunday and
mission schools, hospitals and clinics. He
has also done his bit in the local leper
asylum.
Major Scott McLeod, who will enter-
tain Prince George at Terrica station
(Q.), was born there in 1879. He joined
the A.I.F. in 1915, served in France with
the 42nd Battalion, and was severely
wounded near Armentieres. He is an
efficient station manager, a good shot
and polo player, and an owner of picnic-
meeting horses. His grandfather arrived
in Australia with his five sons in 1837.
“Jeames” reminisces:
John Collier, the artist, who died last week
aged 84, was celebrated for two things: the
“problem pictures” which he exhibited year
by year in the Academy and the fact that he
had married his deceased wife’s sister at a
time when it was illegal to do so. He shared
the second distinction with Sir Francis Burnand,
editor of “Punch,” and their influence (not to
mention that of Edward VII.) had a lot to do
with the repeal of this unwanted law in 1907.
His father was a Solicitor-General of sixty-odd
years ago, and was created Baron Monkswell
when he went on the Privy Council Bench.
James Archer Crawford, aged 104, of
Naseby (M.L.), who has just passed out,
was an example of hereditary longevity.
His father lasted 99 years, his grand-
father 105. He was born near Dundee,
went for a soldier and saw Florence
Nightingale on the Crimea. He came to
this hemisphere after gold in 1861, and
missed at least one real bonanza. Shortly
after his arrival he could have had the
quarter-acre section on which the Grand
Hotel, Dunedin, now stands, for £2O.
He turned it down!
“Duke-street” on a stage celebrity:
Gerald du Maurier, who has died in London
after an operation, was one of the first actor-
managers to introduce the public-school manner
to the West End stage. His father was the
“Punch” artist who specialised in drawings or
fashionable women and who created “Trilby.
George du Maurier had two sons. Guy, the
elder, went into the army from Sandhurst;
Gerald, on to the stage from Harrow. He
wasn’t a great actor: his scope was too limited.
But in the kind of part that called for modern
clothes, as worn about St. James’s in the sea-
son, he was supremely good. He had the
naturalism of a Frenchman, and a beautiful
voice. He gave generously to indigent mum-
mers, worked hard for actors’ charities and was
loved by the profession. The only definite
failure he had in life was as a talkie-actor, but
his stage career was almost over when he took
to the screen. He was doing well in old-
man screen parts towards the end. Witness his
doctor in “I Was a Spy.”
Melb. Theatre Royal, which is now
merely a gap in the denture of Upper
Bourke-street, was run for years by
Charles A. Wenman. Son of Tom Wen-
man, an Englishman who had acted at
the Lyceum with Henry Irving, Ellen
Terry and other immortals, he came to
Melbourne in 1908 as representative of
Denton, Bode and Mackenzie. This firm
was leagued with Clarke, Wren, Meynell
and Gunn in an attempt to undermine
the J.C.W. theatrical monopoly. His first

production at the Royal was “Miss
Hook of Holland,” and a long succes-
sjon 0 f mus i ca i winners followed, includ-
j n g “Xhe Arcadians” (in which Tom
\y a n s made his name), “The Belle of May-
faj r? ” “Sergeant Brue” and “The Choco-
j ate Soldier.” His first panto., “Cinder-
eq a> ” held the boards for 17 weeks in
1914—a local record. When Meynell and
Gunn amalgamated with J.C.W. and “the
Firm” was born, Wenman became a
director.

The Directors herewith present the Revenue and Expenditure Account and Balance Sheet for the year ending
December 31, 1933.
SOCIETY'S INCOME.
It will be admitted by most people who reside in Australia that the last three or four years have been extremely difficult
years to negotiate by individuals, financial institutions and the various Governments of Australia. It is pleasing, therefore, to note
that the Society’s Income has shown steady, if small, yearly increases during those last three years.
1931 Income . . £982,766
1932 Income . £989,096
1933 Income £1,004,284
In like manner the Society’s Funds have also shown steady increases.
1931 Funds . . . . £6,241,407
1932 Funds £6,526,224
1933 Funds £6,754,893
EXPENSES DECREASE.
Another pleasing feature is that the expenses of management (which include Commissions, Medical Fees, Inspection and
Travelling Expenses, Salaries, Directors’ and Auditors’ Fees, Office Rents, etc.) have shown a decrease during that period.
RESERVES INCREASED.
In order to make Assurance doubly sure, your Directors have, during those trying years, regularly placed large sums to
Reserves.
In 1931 the amount so placed was . . £120,000;
in 1932 your Directors added . . . . £100,000;
and in 1933 an additional sum of £lOO,OOO
has been added to these reserves.
It will be seen, therefore, that no less than THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS have been
added to the Contingency Reserves during the worst three years Australia has ever been faced with, and it must be remembered
that additional reserves have been provided to meet any variation of values in Government Stock, as well as a Reserve to provide for
equalisation of the Society’s large Bonuses, which have for years past been in excess of those paid by other Life Assurance Offices.
A PURELY AUSTRALIAN OFFICE.
The ability to pay these large Bonuses has been due to a variety of causes, but perhaps one of the deciding factors has been due
to the City Mutual Life Office being the only Mutual Society transacting business in Australia that confines its activities to the
Commonwealth of Australia, where the duration of life is probably greater than in less favored countries.
INVESTMENTS.
Your Directors have also, during those trying three years above referred to, steadily decreased the amount held on
and increased their investments in sound, solid Government Stock.
DIRECTORS.
It is with considerable regret that the Directors record the death of Mr. Geo. Crowley, Director of the Society,
and the Board desire to place on record their high sense of the valuable services rendered by him during his long attachment to the
Society; for no less than 43 years he filled the position of Managing Director. Mx. W. Bennett, the Victorian Manager, was
appointed to fill the vacancy.
The following Directors retire in accordance with the Articles of Association, viz. The Chairman, G. E. Bryant, Esq., and
The Hon. Frank E. Wall, M.D., M.L.C., both of whom are eligible for re-election and are the only candidates for the vacant seats.
AUDITORS.
Mr. P. F. Dimond also retires and is eligible for re-election, and is the only candidate for the vacant seat.
GEO. E. BRYANT, Chairman.

The latest accounts of this well-handled
and solidly-established Australian life
office disclose all-round improvement.
The business in force at the end
of December (£57,854,174) was £1,399,116
greater than the amount on the
books a year earlier; the spring in
the previous term was £328,297. Ex-
cluding term assurances, there was a
growth of £51,737 in the amount of new
Ordinary business written (£4,069,742),
and surrenders in the two departments
combined (£352,706) were £50,149 lighter.
Combining the figures again, net pre-
miums (£2,032,953) were £64,285 better,
and the £22,000,000-odd of investments
turned in £949,525, up £14,445. The
spring in total income (£2,982,478)
was thus £78,730. After paying all
legitimate claims and exes., striking
off £4802 for depreciation, etc., and
sending £20,316 to the staff fund,
£584,004 (£84,640 more than in the pre-
vious year) was added to the assurance
fund, raising it to £19,568,982. In addi-
tion there were other reserves totalling
£883,432, of which £296,432 belonged to
the General branch. These extra reserves
supplement the earnings of the Assur-
ance fund, and thus contribute to
bonuses.
The surpluses distributed in the two de-
partments compare as follows:
1929. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Ordinary .. £692,946 £560,967 £552,326 £556,512
Industrial . . 76,730 66,022 70,530 74,851
Bonuses continue at the satisfactory com-
pound rate of £2 per cent, on whole-of-
life contracts (£2 per cent on the sum
assured, plus existing bonuses) and 355.
per cent, compound on endowments
maturing at the age of 60 years and over.
Though the office collects its income
and manages its investments at com-
mendably low cost —8.56 p.c. and 26.44
p.c. of last year’s total income in the
Ordinary and Industrial sections respec-
tively—it scores heaviest on the return
from investments. It assumes that the
funds in each department will turn in no
more than 3 p.c. After deducting taxes
(£125,823, down £33,057), last year’s net
return was 3s. 3d. better at £4 ss. 7d. p.c.
in the Ordinary and lOd. better at £4
os. 9d. p.c. in the Industrial section. The
gross returns were £4 19s. 3d. p.c. Ordi-
nary and £4 12s. 6d. p.c. Industrial.
This and the fact that outstanding in-
terest at the end of last year amounted
to no more than £5069 —less than 6d.
per £lOO of total assets —suggest that
the assets, of which Government securi-
ties account for 83 p.c., may be worth
more than their book values:

Liabilities other than under policies con-
sist of deposits (£819,708), claims in
course of settlement (£212,374) and sun-
dry creditors (£276,174), the lot up
£239,710. The extra outside money and
the year’s surplus income were invested
chiefly in public securities, up £538,239,
and railway debentures, etc. (£413,905),
up £295,245.
Policy-holders in the Widows’ Fund
section remain in clover. Last year’s dis-
tributable surplus (£26,781) was no less
than 98.7 p.c. of the premium income
in this section.

The steady recession in earnings is due
to the persistent fall in the price of
copra, which affects not only the co.’s
direct returns therefrom but also its mer-
chandising and other sales and shipping
revenue, etc. Five years ago South Seas
sun-dried copra was fetching over £27
a ton in London ; the figure had fallen to
£l4 ss. at the beginning of 1932, and
1933 opened with the price at £l3 10s.
and closed at £8 2s. 6d. Moreover, the
fall, which was persistent throughout the
year, has continued since, the London
price at last week-end being £7 ss. On
copra purchased from clients the co.
made a loss last year. The profit was
derived from investments and the co.’s
other activities. Its gross earnings fell
away £10,421, making the slip £44,437
over the last four years, despite extension
of the business: —■

Exes., up £3709, include something for
depreciation, bad debts and losses. Thus
the net result dropped to a shade over
5 p.c. on capital as against 6.9, 7.5, 8,
8.1, 8.6 and 8.5 p.c. back to 1927, and
the div. was reduced to 5 p.c., the lowest
rate paid for over a decade.
That the co., which has a very cautious
management, was able to show over 5
p.c. on its capital suggests that assets are
well worth their book value. Here is
the position so far as balance-sheet
figures show it:

To add £72,785 to the book value of
fixed assets (a branch was opened at
Futuna Island, and the new concrete
building at Apia is now nearing com-
pletion) and carry a further £4497 of
book debts, the board went outside for
an extra £39,949 and reduced the stocks
item, etc., by £42,836. The contraction
in the more or less liquid surplus
(£330,204) was £81,601. .
What the future holds for copra it is
difficult to say. Hitler’s restriction of
imports into Germany has intensified
competition in other markets, which may
mean that it will be a while before satis-
factory prices are again obtained for
copra ; the present figure is mostly below
cost of production.
At 275. (the price was 345. a year ago)
the co.’s pound shares return 3.7 p.c.
on a 5 p.c. div. basis. Visibly the back-
ing is 225. 9d. in net tangibles.

It is largely to growth in employment
that the breweries have to look for in-
creased turnover. In S. Aus. the quan-
tity of ale and stout brewed receded from
5,170,387 gallons in 1929-30 to 3,464,856
gallons in 1931-32. The number of trade-
unionists unemployed rose from 17.8 p.c.
for the last quarter of 1929 to 35.4 p.c.
for the third quarter of 1932, and then
fell steadily to 28.9 p.c. for the Dec.
quarter of 1933. Because of this and
other things, including a more than
usually thirsty summer, this co.’s gross
sales (£51,610) improved £5763 during the
last term, and rents, etc. (£39,145), were
£722 better. Exes. (£42,035) took £5172
of the increase, due to an extra charge
for repairs, etc. (£17,228, up £4754). In-
cluding an unexplained addition of £1195
to reserves, enough remained to show
9.9 p.c. on capital as against 9.7, 9.3, 12.3,
12.4, 12.8 and 10.8 p.c. back to 1928, and
the final div. was at the rate of 7 p.c.
p.a., making 6\ p.c. for the year. An
8 p.c. div. (= £40,000) thus appears to
be within the co.’s reach when the call
for special provision for contingencies
ceases.
The market notes this, and the fact
that the co. has gone more extensively
into the hotel-finance business, thus
widening and anchoring turnover, and
that chips have been taken off various
taxes ; also, money has become cheaper.
Hence the pound shares, visibly covered
by 21s. Bd. in net tangibles, are priced at
38s. 6d. as against 28s. a year ago. At
the higher figure the return is 3.6 p.c.
on a 7 p.c. div. basis, or 4.1 p.c. on an
8 p.c. distribution.
There is nothing to' worry about in the
finances::—

The co.’s past performances are not
much of a guide to the future. For many
years it had nothing invested in bricks
and mortar, and was able to get along
with a handful of capital and pay hand-
some divs.—an average of 18| p.c.
for the five years to the close of
accounts in 1925. Then it bought part
of the freehold and put up a new 11-
storeyed building at the corner of Eliza-
beth and Bourke streets, and raised
£129,000 on mortgage and £lOO,OOO
of 9 p.c. pref. capital for the purpose.
Meanwhile, £lOO,OOO of bonus scrip was
handed to the ords ; , raising paid capital
to £300,000. But just as the figures began
to respond (124: p.c. was paid for each of
the three years to the end of February,
1930), the whole outlook changed color,
and reserves had to be tapped for £8515
to give the ords., which were passed by
in ’3l, 5 p.c. in ’32.
The ’33 figures were more encourag-
ing, but those for the last term show a
drop of £2463 in net earnings, and the
div. was lowered to 3f p.c., and there
was little to spare. A new department
for women’s wear was opened, and the
volume of sales increased, but prices had
to be pared to meet competition.
To spend £13,000 on improvements
and lop £30,000 off mortgages (now
£99,000), the board went to its bankers
for £19,907 and drew upon cash, etc.,
for £24,039: —•

When the books closed liabilities ex-
ceeded more or less liquids, including
shares in other cos., by £19,604, an in-
crease of £13,082 during the twelve-
month.
Prospects for the current term will de-
pend largely upon good buying. The
market expects the co. to do better, and
prices the ords. at 265. 6d. The return
at that figure would be 4\ p.c. on a 6
p.c. div. basis. At 335. 6d. the return
on the prefs., which have not a very
active market, is 5.3 p.c. The net tan-
gible cover is £3 17s. lOd. prefs. and

The co. is in the produce agency and
carrying business in the back country of
Vic. and N. S. Wales, and has been for
the last 50 years. The three to the
close of accounts in 1933 were the worst
it experienced since ss. per share was
struck off capital following the big
drought early in the century. Since 1920
the board had gathered £106,250 of fresh
capital and leant heavily upon outsiders
in order to carry a lot more book debts
and merchandising stocks. Though such
a policy produced excellent results on a
buoyant market, it spelt trouble on a
falling, one, and shareholders were passed
by for the two years to the end of Janu-
ary, 1933. However, as stocks and
debtors’ balances were worked down, the
outside debt was reduced and cash accu-
mulated. Hence the board was able
to return ss. per share (= £31,250) last
year, reducing paid capital to £125,000,
and thus make possible a better rate
of dividend than could otherwise be paid.
During the year the co. bought the
business and premises of the Western
District Co-op. Produce and Insurance
Co. at Colac (Vic.). Mainly because of
this and the rise in the price of wool
gross earnings (£63,871) sprang £9484.
Exes. (£57,774) took £3022 of the in-
crease, leaving the profit at 4.8 p.c. on
capital (the balance was on the wrong
side for the three preceding years), and
4 p.c. was distributed. That is disregard-
ing £9OOO taken from the contingency
reserve (now £3328) to help write down
the book value of shares in the Murray
Shipping Co. by £ll,lOO, reducing them
to their face value (£6900) —the Murray
Co. returned 7s. per share of its pref.
capital, cancelled arrears of divs., and
struck ss. per share off the ords.

The net growth of £5102 in the property
item reflects the purchase already re-
ferred to. The reduction of £31,921 in
cash, etc., was mainly on account of the
return of capital. To carry an extra
£14,525 of merchandise, debtors’ balances
were reduced by £5390 and only £4730
was added to the outside debt. The
contraction in the more or less liquid
surplus (£130,639, excluding the Murray
Co.’s shares) was £27,516.
Prospects of the co. doing a bit better
during the current term will depend
upon the season and prices. At 21s.
the pound shares return 3.8 p.c. on_ a
4 p.c. div. basis. The coyer is 31s. sd.
in net tangibles.

It is hard to say exactly where share-
holders in this distraught concern stand.
The co. used to be one of the most pros-
perous of Queensland brewers, but, hav-
ing lost its grip on the trade, it plunged
into debt in an effort to revive turnover.
In 1928 it sold the brewery plant and
trade of the hotels to Castlemaine Per-
kins for 160,000 paids (face value 12s.
6d.), priced at 155., and later took up
another 40,000 at par. Also, the book
value of the freeholds was written up
£111,560 to offset the loss on plant, etc.
The co. has since had to sell or transfer
its Castlemaine Perkins scrip, which was
its best earning asset, in order to lighten
the debt.

REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance Sheet as at October I 6 last,

account, making a total of £428,290/16/4. From this, £118,125 was paid as an
Interim Dividend on October 6 last, and the Directors have now appropriated a
further sum of £135,000 to pay a final Dividend of 4/- per Share, less Income Tax at
5/- in the £l, making, in all, £253,125, equal to 7/6 per Share, less Tax, and repre-
senting for the year a distribution at the rate of 7J per cent., less Tax. There will
remain £175,165/16/4 to be carried forward to the next account.
The Dividend will be payable in London, Australia and New Zealand on
March 23,

CHILDREN
HAPPY days are those when a man’s children
meet him at the door and there is love in the
house. They are the days when a man should
be making provision, not only for his own future
and his wife’s, but for his children’s future. When
the children are young the outlay is so very small
that a man never notices it.
Under the Society’s Table ZN a father aged, say,
30, can take out a £l,OOO Policy on his child aged,
say, one year next birthday, payable on the death of
the child at any time after his or her 21st birth-
day, for the small annual premium of £7/17/6.
Should the child die before age 21, all premiums will
be returned to the father, plus interest at 4 per cent,
per annum. Should the father die before the child is
21, no further premiums will need to be paid until
the child reaches 21; after that the child will pay
the premiums and the policy will be vested in him
or her.
Better let the Society send a representative to talk
this question over or, if you prefer it, the Society
will send a book called “Investing in Happiness”
that will tell the whole story.

The amount coming to secured creditors,
including the Biggses, was reduced by
£3BOl last year. In addition, there are
contingent liabilities of £33,992, of which
the co. expects to be called upon for at
least £19,000. As for the assets, the
auditors say: “In our opinion the pro-
vision for bad and doubtful debts is
inadequate.” The directors, in their re-
port, state that expected losses on
debtors’ balances and realisation of hotel
and other freeholds and leases is £95,000.
Allowing for this, and including the
£19,000 of contingent liabilities already
referred to, there was approximately 9s.
3d. per pound of paid-up capital left.
At the moment the old brewery free-
hold, in at £55,941, is more of a hin-
drance than a help. The 42 hotel
properties consist of 13 freeholds, 28
leaseholds and one held as mortgagee in
possession. The year’s growth of £3311
in the book value of debtors’ balances is
due to unpaid interest and rent. The
trouble is that some of the hotels, to-
gether with rates and taxes on the
brewery property, and other overhead,
gobble up surplus earnings from the
rest, and more besides.
The market, doubtful what the pro-
perties will fetch when they can be sold
—Castlemaine Perkins has first refusal
for 20 years—prices the pound shares at
3s. 3d. or thereabouts.
Chevron, Ltd.
This is the co. which is to put up a
high-class private hotel of four storeys
to accommodate 198 guests at the corner
of St. Kilda and Commercial roads, Mel-
bourne’s most fashionable quarter for
this class of business. J. M. Duncan,
said to have made a success of the old
Chevron (to be pulled down), will manage
the new one, which is figured to cost
£101,500 —building, etc., not more than
£68,000; furnishings and equipment,
£16,000 ; land (independently valued at
£10,350) and existing building, £11,500 ;
goodwill, £2OOO (in scrip); preliminary
exes., including underwriting, £4OOO.
Every bedroom is to be adjacent to a
bathroom, and a swimming pool and
tennis courts should add to the attractive-
ness of the place.
To meet the outlay and provide £3500
of working capital, 53,000 £1 shares and
£50,000 of 5 p.c. 10-year debentures are
offered, of which the underwriters (J. B.
Were and Son) have taken firm 33,000
shares and £30,000 worth of the deben-
tures. On the basis of prospectus figures,
the net tangible cover for the debentures,
which are secured by a first mortgage
over the whole of the co.’s assets, is £l9B
per cent., and a sinking fund of not less
than £1250 p.a. ( = 2\ p.c.) is to be
established for their redemption. The
interests of debenture-holders are to be
watched over by the Union Trustee Co.
Allowing for vacancies averaging 25
p.c. throughout the year, gross earnings
are figured at £28,759, on the basis of a
competitive tariff. Including rates and
taxes (£1885), debenture interest and
sinking fund (£3750) and depreciation
(£3750), exes, are put at £23,212, leaving
£5547 net, equal to 10 p.c. on a share
capital of £55,000. On this basis the
debenture interest would be more than
three times covered. If vacancies average
12i p.c., net earnings are estimated at
15 p.c. on capital.
The whole place is expected to be
ready for the co. to begin business
before Melbourne’s centenary celebra-
tions commence, which ought to mean
much so far as a flying start and exten-
sion of goodwill are concerned.
The shares are to be listed, and the
co. goes to allotment when the full issue
has been subscribed. On the board are
T. Hastie (chairman), K. A. Henderson,
L. A. Mellor and J. M. Duncan.
Day Dawn, one of the Bulolo gold
propositions not swallowed by New
Guinea Goldfields, Ltd., has had a pretty
successful run as an independent show.
For the six months to the end of Febru-
ary 9201 tons went through the mill for
52830 z. of bullion, worth £22,910. The
value of the milling ore was diluted by
stone fretted off the hanging wall. The
lot was run through because hand-sort-
ing would have been more costly than
crushing the stone as it fell. The co. has
over 30,000 tons of tailings, assaying
4dwt. gold and Boz. silver to the ton.
The cyanide plant to treat these is on the
ground, and when the Pelton Wheel to
generate 90 h.p. is ready costs should
be lowered. Where opened up the lode
on the 90ft. level averages over an ounce
fine, and the ore-body is solid and carries
definite walls. The large bodies of low-
grade stone in the Florrie, Manganese
and Merri formations are to be de-
veloped.
* * * *
Two Lolworth prospectors have
brought in £6OO worth of gold to
Charters Towers (N.Q.). It is the result
of sinking a 26ft. shaft in a fortnight in
a big soft formation carrying free gold.
The name of the new discovery is the
Lucky Hit, the ore from which has no
resemblance to other Lolworth mines.
At a depth of 26ft. there is no sign of
a wall. The intention is to sink the shaft
further and crosscut to the walls. Local
wiseacres are puzzled, because the ore
is full of mica, something foreign to the
average prospector. It is no trouble to
dolly an ounce prospect out of the stuff.
* * * *
Though Hawkwood (C.Q.) is finding it
expensive to work the lode, owing to the
soft wall formations, the grade of ore
has more than compensated; the first
hundred tons averaged slightly over 2oz.
fine gold. The reef averages about 24in.
in width. Arrangements are now in train
for J. M. Archbold, who mastered the
difficult treatment of North Arm ore, to
put up a fine-mesh crushing and cyanide
plant locally. Costs are too high to send
the ore away for treatment, as first pro-
posed.
* * * *
The new shaft on the Queenslander
Reef at Forsayth (N.Q.) is opening up
according to expectations. The reef aver-
aged 18in. down to 35ft., and is increas-
ing a little as the shaft goes down. Aver-
age values are around 15dwt. In the
old mine the best-sized reef was around
the 100 ft, level.
* * * *
Lake View continues to lead the way
in the introduction of labor-saving appli-
ances on the Kalgoorlie field. Amongst
the most important is a mechanical power
shovel, which can be operated in a 7ft.
by 6ft. drive, and conveniently moved
from level to level. Another is a one-
man diamond drill, which may be
mounted on an ordinary machine bar.
Its boring capacity for horizontal holes
is 300 ft., and the core produced is
13-16ths of an inch in diameter ; the cost
of operating, plus depreciation, is about
6s. a foot. An automatic feed-drifter,
which is tipped to increase footage, will
shortly be added to the list.
* * * *
Lanarkshire broadcast the cheering
news the other day that something attrac-
tive had been exposed in its latest option
at Mullihe (W.A.), and the shares im-
mediately jumped from a few pence to
over 2s. in the market. Some forfeited
scrip fetched from 2s. 2d. to 2s. sd. The
co. was one of the numerous ventures
formed at the beginning of the 1920
Hampton Plains boom, and of recent
years has taken and abandoned several
options. Since the reefs previously
worked in the neighborhood of the pre-
sent option lost much of their gold at
shallow depth, shareholders should not be
too optimistic on the strength of early
reports.
* * * ajc
Some capital has lately been raised in
Perth and Kalgoorlie to resurrect the
Lady Shenton at Menzies (W.A.). The
performances of this mine include a gold
production of nearly three-quarters of
a million sterling and payment of
£120,000 in divs. Something may have
been left, or something may be found
in opening up new ground, but past ex-
perience is that Menzies shoots have not
shaped well at depth.
* * * *
Lalla Rookh, at Pilbara (W.A.), is
being mentioned in Perth and Adelaide
as a good thing with gold at its present
price. A co. which acquired it years ago
on the strength of previous performances
came a cropper. There wasn’t enough
in the show at the old price of gold to
pay divs. How it is likely to fare under
existing conditions remains to be seen.
* * * *
Ora Banda Amalgamated is negotiat-
ing for an extension of the option taken
from Princess Royal. The vendors to
Princess Royal were Messrs. McKenzie
and Hall, who are willing to grant an
extension for £5OOO cash, making the
total purchase price £20,000, payable
January 29 next.
* * * *
Little has been heard of telluride ore
at Kalgoorlie (W.A.) during recent years.
At Boulder Perseverance, however, there
is a face of high-grade telluride, 7ft.
wide, exposed at the 1450 ft. level. Should
the occurrence persist, estimates of the
prospective value of the mine will have
to be recast.
* * * *
South Kalgurli is installing a portable
plant on the Hainault section of its Kal-
goorlie holding to treat old battery resi-
dues at the rate of about 50 tons daily.
Nearby, on the Associated. Lake View
is expected to presently start retreat-
ment of a big pile of sands and slimes,
from which a six-figure profit is ex-
pected.
* * * *
Childe Harold and Craigiemore, both
near Laverton (W.A.), may be raised
from the dead if the prospecting now in
progress offers sufficient inducement. An
English crowd is spending money on
Childe Harold, and a former owner (Dr.
Laver) and a few friends are financing
operations at Craigiemore.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
D.D.: If you can afford to wait, hold on
D’E.: The industry has possibilities, but the
venture is new, and has yet .to win a market.
The shares, therefore, are speculative. One
danger is overcapitalisation.. . .C.M.R.: Not
recommended Y-M.: (1) Very doubtful; as
it stands, the capital structure is a bit top-
heavy. (2) A gamble with a fair chance of
success E.C.: Impossible to say without
knowing in what subsidiary industry the money
is to be employed.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Ladies Must Love”
The truth of this proposition is being
demonstrated at the Capitol. Four nicely
shaped American gals have been driven
to desperation by the depresh and the
dearth of wealthy visitors to the booze-
emporiums which erst employed them.
One states the position to an employ-
ment-bureau sekketry: “I’m that low I
gotta go to woik.” They draw up an
agreement in the terms of which each
member of the quartette pledges herself to
turn into a common pool such products
of the ladylike game of man-bilking as
may accrue. Their charms are almost
exclusively anatomical—wits they have
little or none —but Neil Hamilton isn’t
satisfied until he lands one —June Knight.
This film contains no bedroom scenes,
as Elstree understands the term, but there
are several in which the woik-dodgers
display their charms to one another.
The background consists of cocktail bars
and cabarets. Miss Knight croons a song
in which she declares that, although she
knows her sweetie has a million a month,
a yacht, a penthouse and seven auto-
mobiles, she would choose him as her
mate were he but a pauper. This works
powerfully on the mind of Mr. Hamil-
ton, who thenceforward broods emotion-
ally over a gramophone-record of the
last foxtrot he had with the balladist
in a night-club.
The most effective situation (or situa-
tions) is (or are) where Mr. Hamilton,
shut out of a lift which carries his be-
loved to marriage with an elderly and
immensely wealthy gentleman, beats the
lift by tearing down the stairs, and on each
of seven floors breathes woids of lurv
through the grilles. Apparently he ousts
the oldster and marries the girl, but the
day has long gone by when this can be
called a happy ending.
“SOS Iceberg”
In a prologue Carl Laemmle, Jun.,
thanks people in Greenland, Iceland,
Finland, Norway and Denmark for their
co-operation. Undoubtedly there is a lot
of genuine Arctic scenery in the thing.
Yet it is largely a brilliant fake in which
the real and the false are dovetailed.
The story concerns an explorer who
gets lost in northern polar regions. An
expedition goes in search of him in a
steamer and finds him in a cave in an
iceberg—an odd refuge, considering he
is only four miles from an Eskimo town.
Rescued and rescuers are marooned on
the berg, portions of which continually
topple into the sea. The explorer’s wife
(Leni Riefenstahl) sets out to find him
in a monoplane, which crashes against
the berg. There she is, with a sick hus-
band (Rod La Roque) and a fiend in
human form (Gibson Gowland) who
threatens her with worse than death.
Providentially science comes to the aid
of wifely honor. The radio outfit,
situated in the open, with a loudspeaker
horn, summons aid. It makes a noise
like trombones, dot-dashing “SOS.”
Another monoplane appears (the wire
on which it slides is unfortunately
visible in one shot), winding its way
among synthetic Arctic scenery. Rod
and Leni are rescued. The poor old vil-
lain falls into the icy sea and is eaten by
polar bears. Finis.
The performers in this kind of fantasia
don’t act. If they did it would divert
attention from the mechanical effects.
“Let’s Fall in Love’*
This, anyhow, has some laughs.
Edmund Lowe is a movie director with
a temperamental Swedish star on his
hands. Tala Birell is the virago who
keeps threatening to go home to Sweden.
The sequence in which she emerges
briskly from a swooning love passage
to scream insults at Lowe and Gregory
Ratoff (a Hebrew movie-magnate with a
Middle European accent) is said to have
been taken from life.
Lowe finds Ann Sothem working in
a humble side-show, has her taught the
Swedish accent, and ballyhoos her into
fame. The lady has neither features nor
a figure, yet when the time comes for her
to face the press photographers at the
party which Ratoff gives in her honor
she looks as lovely as the average exotic.
An interesting proof of what can be done
on the screen with clothes and a good
photographer.
Ratoff is easily the best of the bunch,
but then he has a character-part which is
practically actor-proof, and nearly all the
most effective lines. A tedious picture,
except for its one dramatic moment and
the jibes at the movie business; and it
didn’t end on Saturday night till 11 p.m.
Allan Priora, the Australian tenor, got
a rapturous reception from a packed
house. He can act and talk as well as
sing, and he is easier to look at than
most tenors.
“Two Alone” ‘
A Regent film. To quote from the
“Sunday Sun,” “Jean Parker is exquisite
as the farm-drudge from the orphanage.”
This is so. Whether she is steering a
pair of draught horses over a ploughed
field or toiling in the fowlhouse or sub-
siding into the arms of her fellow-drudge
after a panic flight across country, she
remains as delicately, idiotically pretty-
pretty, as regards her face, as a rich
child’s doll. Tom Brown is her cretinous
admirer. According to the “Sunday
Sun,” he “helps her to make, their love
story very moving.” He doesn’t; “ran-
cid” is the word. Their ruthless em-
ployer, who announces that nobody
hain’t done nothing for him in all his
life, and that he is a hard man to work
for in consequence, is effective as a
modern Legree. The others are almost
as unreal as the hero and heroine, and
the story is strangely banal. It is intro-
duced in a foreword as a picture of life
“in our country”!
Sundry Shows
Those who remembered Percy
Grainger’s unorthodox outbursts with
bigger and better orchestras in large
works of his own composition at Melb.
Auditorium a few years back were pos-
sibly surprised when Percy came forward
at Melb. Town Hall on Saturday and
started the proceedings with a sober dis-
sertation on the intentions of Bach as
a musician. He explained that those old
composers didn’t necessarily intend their
works to be performed as written, but
left them to be interpreted and even
completed according to the fancies of
other people. They were, in short, out-
line sketches.
However that may be, the musician-
lecturer then played the Bach cha-
conne, allegedly completed by Busoni,
and it was a very beautiful work,
of which the Australian musician gave
a refined and intelligent rendering,
with all the sedulous attention to rhythm
for which he is noted. He then resumed
his chat, this time referring to the music
of Brahms, the border ballads of Sir
Walter Scott and other matters, as a pro-
logue to a delicate performance of five
typical works by the German master.
This procedure was gratefully received
by an audience accustomed to the robot-
like detachment of foreign virtuosos,
who, if they omitted their genuflexions
to their hearers, might easily be mis-
taken for pieces of musical machinery,
of the same order as their instruments.
Chopin’s B Flat Minor Sonata fol-
lowed, played very quietly and simply
apd devoid of fireworks. The funeral
march was probably the highlight of the
evening.
Incidentally, Grainger gave novelty to
the performance of the National
Anthem. He played it standing up, pos-
sibly to make the audience forget that
he’s a naturalised American citizen. The
next innovator may be an organist who
plays sacred music kneeling.
* * *
In “When the Crash Comes,” by
Beverley Nichols, which was put on at
Melbourne’s Little Theatre last week, the
most audible crash is that of Mr. Bever-
ley Nichols. He knows less about revolu-
tions and revolutionists than he does
about London drawing-rooms, and he
appears to have got most of his know-
ledge of the latter from such journals
as the “Bystander.” When the revolu-
tion comes, by general election, the com-
missar of the Transport Union (Ray
Connell) and his family are quartered on
the home of Lady Poole in Smith-street.
Despite the distressingly lower class man-
ners of the proletarians, the young aris-
tocrats fall in love with the younger plebs.
Mr. Nichols makes a valiant attempt to
be fair, and the first four scenes are pro-
paganda for the Marxists; but his
sources of information about human
nature prevent him making them any-
thing more than sentimental stereotypes.
For love of the bourgeois heroine the
transport commissar goes forth and de-
livers an uncompromising speech to the
masses at a moment when the revolution
is collapsing. He returns to the mansion
of Lady Poole and is continuing his ora-
tion from a balcony when a fanatical
imperialist shoots him from behind the
arras. The heroine then elects to follow
the dead commissar’s sister to Canning
Town to prepare the proletariat for the
next revolution. Here Mr. Nichols de-
cides he has given his middle-class
audience enough pink propaganda for
one evening, so he makes the sister marry
the local grocer for the purely bourgeois
purpose of insuring her own future. This
disillusions the aristocratic heroine and
she falls into the arms of her extremely
wooden fiance, a Guardee. Mr. Nichols’s
opinion, as stated on the programme, is
that revolutions never reach any useful
conclusion. Neither does this play. But,
reviewed from the angle of romantic
melodrama, “When the Crash Comes”
is workmanlike; it contains some tense
situations and ingenious devices. Also,
the psychology of the lady who becomes
ecstatically attached to the memory of the
dead revolutionary has some elements of
truth in it. The Little Theatricians,
especially Lorna Dawson, Mrs. George
Bell and Betty Tait, made astonishingly
good fists of their parts ; moreover, the
revolutionary leader carried convincingly
across the footlights because Ray Connell
gave him what seemed to be natural dull
force and heavy pomposity.

When the first murmurs of the grand
organ under William McKie’s fingers
thrilled through the Town Hall, Mel-
bourne, in the Handel Concerto, Op. 4,
No. 4, the other evening, the huge audi-
ence knew it was in for something splen-
did. When the Symphonists, under the
Heinze baton, and minus all their forces
but the strings and two oboes, proceeded
to chase Mr. McKie’s gigantic music-
box in and out of a mazy dance of extra-
ordinarily delicate orchestration, it knew
it was in for something lovely. Fol-
lowed the Bach Prelude and Fugue
in A Minor, and expectation was
once more justified. Then came
Frank Bridge’s suite for orchestra, “The
Sea,” which purports to picture the
sea on a summer day, the sea-foam
churned up by the waves in the rock
pools, a nocturnal ocean with the moon
making a path across the waters and a
howling tempest —an entirely silly enter-
prise, for the mere words on the pro-
gramme enable the reader to construct
from his own experience far more exact
pictures of these phenomena than can
any musician. At one stage of the pro-
ceedings present critic thought he heard
a bird not usually associated with the
seashore—namely, a cuckoo. Stripped
of its pretensions, “The Sea” is of
little moment. Hope revived with the
concerto of Saint-Saens (Op. 33), which
introduced the sonsy Canadian ’cellist
Sara Nelson. Miss Nelson did not give
herself very easy material out of which
to fashion a mansion of glorious sound,
and her success was only partially im-
pressive. The second half of the pro-
gramme was given over to the gigantic
symphony, Op. 39, of Sibelius. It taxed
Prof. Heinze’s powers to the utmost, and
his success was only relative. However,
a profitable evening.
* * *
The moral of J. B. Priestley’s “Danger-
ous Corner,” presented at Sydney Savoy
by the Independent Theatre, is “let sleep-
ing dogs lie.” Robert Caplan (Alfred
Race), conducting a sort of amateur in-
quest into his brother Martin’s suicide,
discovers that the dead man was a liber-
tine and a drug addict; that his own wife,
Freda (Molly Brown), was one of Mar-
tin’s mistresses ; that his partner in com-
merce, Charles Stanton (Clarence
Murphy), is a thief, a liar and a breaker
of the Seventh Commandment. Olwen
Peel (Betty Grigson) owned up to having
cherished an affection for her best
friend’s husband. Gordon Whitehouse
(John Wyndham) was branded as an
effeminate young man whose perversions
gave his wife, Betty (Myrna Dickey), an
excuse for extensive flirtations. Dis-
covering that Betty is, to use an old
phrase, no better than she should be,
Robert, who loves her, blows his brains
out. The play is a cynical and pessi-
mistic commentary on society, but it is
well constructed. Interest cumulates,
and the catastrophic denouement is nicely
calculated. There is an epilogue which
shows what would have happened had
somebody diverted Robert’s attention at
the psychological moment in the first act.
Nothing would have happened. Casting
was generally good, and some of the
opportunities for drama were realised by
the players. Doris Fitton produced the
play, and Don Finley designed the
scenery. Next production will be “The
Marquise,” a comedy of the eighteenth
century, by Noel Coward.

An item in Australia’s list of 1934
exports (though it won’t appear in the
blue-books) is “soprano (1),” referring to
Elsa Corry, and it may prove to be an
important one. This pupil of Ruth
Ladd demonstrated at Sydney Town Hall
last Wednesday night that she has a very
flexible voice, of most appealing timbre.
She sings with intelligence and has a
good stage presence. Possibly her voice is
not, and never will be, powerful enough
for opera, but she should have a future
on the concert platform. She goes to
Europe for further training, backed by
funds which her patrons, who have been
active in soliciting subscriptions, consider
adequate.

Iris Kirkwhite, who broke her ankle
in Melbourne just after arriving from
London, makes her first appearance now
in a “Miss Gibbs” revival at Adelaide
Royal. She is very young, and she has an
appealing air and a sense of humor, and
that is all that Mary Gibbs needs. Mil-
ton and Franklyn have a big task in
effacing old memories of Leslie Holland
and Fred Leslie in the “crook” scenes,
but come through it well, and Gus Bluett
dominates every scene he appears in.
Also Charles Zoli puts in a fine bit of
serious acting. Monckton’s music is
delightful, and the old fun about Dor-
ando and suffragettes and cars that had
to be cranked goes as well as ever.


ABORIGINALITIES
“J.K.K.”: Frank Koch’s drawing (B.
4/4/’34) reminds me of a local beef-
grower. He had some quality steers in
the saleyards, and, speaking to him after
the auction, I asked how he got on.
“No good,” he replied. “Of course, the
Lenten season is a bad period to sell,” I
remarked. “Yes,” he said, “it’s a pity
those 12 apostles weren’t cattle-dealers
instead of fishermen.”
H* H* ❖
“Jerry”: “Sister” (B. 21/3/’34) mis-
takes the fishing “vanagi” of the Papuans
for the trading lakatoi. The vanagi is
the outrigger canoe used for the daily
trip to the reefs outside Port Moresby
Harbor. The lakatoi is made up of four
canoes lashed together, with one or more
huts on it. In the off-season they are
generally to be seen dismantled lying off
the village. As for rosy-cheeked native
girls—well, the natives first of all don’t
live in the cool spots in high alti-
tudes, mainly because it’s far too cold,
and also because there is no game and
no native vegetables and fruits. There
“I ’ear as the cops are coinin’ fer yer ’usband this mornin’, Mrs. Murphy.”
"Yes, and don’t you get shovin’ yours forward!”
are daisies and buttercups in the hills
and other European flora, including oaks
with real acorns, holly and numerous Old
World mountain flowers, not forgetting
the edelweiss of the Swiss Alps. On
one of my inland mountain trips I came
across some large white rhododendrons
that would have gladdened the eye of
any English suburban gardener. A bird,
suggestive of the English blackcock, also
haunts these altitudes of 10,000 ft. or
more.
* * * *
“Swale”: Am afraid 1 must question
the record claimed by “Mho” (B.
11/4 / ’34) for having hooked two trout
on the one fly at the same time, the
second one having been “gorge-hooked
—that is, caught by the hook in the
mouth of a smaller fish well down in the
second fish’s stomach. Never an English
season goes by without similar, happen-
ings being reported in the “Field. I
actually saw an instance near Ripon
(Yorkshire) years ago. An old parson
had hooked a small fish and was steering
him into the bank to unhook and throw
in again when a two-pounder —a very
big fish for English waters—-took him
entire. He was played, and landed,
hooked in the gorge, as always happens
in such cases. Salmon trout, fresh into
the estuaries from the sea, are famous
for similar greediness, and even the
lordly salmon, though he isn’t supposed
to feed in fresh water, has been reported
as following suit.
“Barang”: Sydney had an unusual
visitor the other day, when a penguin
appeared in the harbor. Oddly enough,
the little stranger made his head-
quarters beneath Taronga Park wharf,
where he spent the day wreaking havoc
among the thousands of yellowtails that
school beneath the wharves this time of
the year. For the embodiment of speed
and grace in the water this penguin took
a lot of beating. The fish stood not the
slightest chance of escaping his lightning-
like attacks, although the yellowtail
and mackerel moved so fast that many
landed high and dry on the pontoon,
where they were seized by the delighted
youngsters who had gathered to watch
the penguin.
* * * *
“Torquata”: At the present time many
N.S.W. gums are being eaten bare of
their foliage by the cup-moth larvae,
prettily marked rectangular creatures
which are armed with formidable spines.
When newly-hatched, the larvae resemble
pieces, of braid. Voracious eaters, they
soon devour many leaves, but happily the
life cycle is soon completed. The oval-
“Get insured? Good God, man, I’m not safe around this place as it is!”
shaped cocoons are made of fine thread,
which, on drying, looks like soft brown
paper. A neat seam near the top allows
the moth to emerge by pushing outwards.
In 1916 a State-wide plague of these
caterpillars destroyed acres of eucalypts.
=s * * *
“Trepang”: A tabby cat owned by a
Cooper’s Plains (Q.) dairy-farmer is more
useful with cows than any cattle-dog.
Twice daily puss will herd up the milkers
without instructions. In her younger
days she accompanied the boss on a
droving trip from Darwin to Brisbane.
* * * *
“Airline”: One of our most elusive
birds is the Bourke parrakeet. Emerg-
ing from a 50-
years’ period of
quasi - extinction
during a hot spell
several years ago,
thousands of them
swarmed in to the
wells along the
Musgrave and
Everard Ranges
(S.A.). Small, grey
birds, their only
hint of ornamenta-
tion is a splash of
blue on the wings
and an occasional
tinge of crimson
on the chest. Their
greatest charm lies
in their friendly,
confidential accept-
ance of man, of
whom they show
not the slightest
fear. During a
prospecting trip
through their fav-
ored haunts we
found this trait
rather annoying.
Though daylight
feeders, they came
in to water at any
old time of night,
and for hours be-
fore sunrise would
flutter incessantly
about us, settling
on our blankets
and seemingly tak-
ing an unholy joy in disturbing our slum-
bers. Recently their numbers have
dwindled to almost vanishing point. For-
tunately, they breed well in captivity.
* * * *
“M.”: Except that “Dilly” is wrong
in every detail of his essay on water-
bags (B. 4/4/’34)), I have no fault to
find with it. Major (Sir Thomas) Mit-
chell did not perish on his Bogan (or
rather Darling) expedition in 1835 ; he
died at Carthona, Darling Point, Sydney,
on October 5, 1855. Alan Cunningham
was not with the 1835 expedition —it was
Richard, his brother. There are two
memorials to Mitchell in N.S.W. —one
on the walls of the Sydney Lands Office,
the other at Mt. Victoria. Victoria has
21 —the last unveiled by Lord Stone-
haven in 1931.
“El V.”: “Dilly” (B. 4/4/’34) must go
further back to find the inventor of
waterbags than Sir Thos. Mitchell, who,
no doubt, acquired his first one when
he was with Wellington’s armies. They
were certainly in use among the British
troops in India in the first campaign
against Haidar Ali, before Mitchell was
born, and I have seen a fair approxi-
mation to our article, made of many
thicknesses of fine cotton proofed with
grease, in use in northern Persia. That,
I should imagine by the look and smell
of it, was the father of all waterbags.
Yet it was modern even to its bone spout.
* * * *
“D.F.”: Our aero club once held two
bosom friends. One took particular
pride in the other’s performances. The
time came for the idol’s first solo flight.
He made a good take-off and cir-
cuit, glided down into wind at the right
height and speed, but flattened out too
soon, lost speed, and landed with a jar-
ring bump that drove the instructor to
language which made visibility nil. “I
don’t know how I came to make such
a ghastly mess of it,” the novice said,
speaking to his friend about it later.
“Nonsense,” replied that worshipper;
“why, you made a perfect landing, only
about 15ft. too high.”
* * * *
“Tiki”: It is only quite recently that
toheroa soup has had any standing in
culinary circles. There is a story (docu-
mented by production of the bill of fare)
that Edward, P., at a banquet in the
Quaky Islands, was given “Consomme
Muscovite,” inquired for the recipe, and,
finding that the local small clams were
essential to the flavor, crossed out the
French, substituted “Toheroa,” and added
“Very good! ! ” Earl Beauchamp and Lords
Wemyss and Pembroke, coming along
years later, concurred with the Prince’s
verdict, and it began to be bruited abroad
that toheroa soup is more luscious than
the green juice of the turtle. Los Angeles,
which" ever craves new luxuries, lately
sent a go-getter over to Maoriland. “You
may make,” he said, “the best doggone
soup in creation, but, if you can’t sell it,
what’s the use?” But the Maorilanders
do sell it. I had a bowl of the product
(made out of a tin) in Sydney the other
day. It tasted like the whole Pacific
Ocean, including sharks and octopods.
A highly marine soup, in which, on
the foam of the surf from a thousand
beaches, float little islets of green sea-
weed. A prof, at Otago Uni. has praised
the stuff, saying that it contains many
vitamins and minerals good for the in=
nards. It may be that he is right, but
can any tinned viand be aught but a pale
shadow of its former self? If whitebait
fritters, as the Maorilander understands
them, were obtainable in Sydney and
Melbourne, the M.L. whitebait would
have been long ago extinct.
THE WINNER
A. H. Nelson, Second Beach, Cairns
( N.Q. ), takes this week’s guinea for the
following par.: —
In the far-northern boarding-
house where I stayed was a big,
quiet, diffident railway employee,
remarkable for the stacks of let-
ters he received with every south-
ern mail. They came from all over
Australia, and, judging by the en-
velopes, were chiefly business com-
munications. Strolling into his
room one night he showed me a
sort of scrapbook where letters and
pamphlets relating to all manner
of panaceas for human ills were
neatly filed away. Cures for corns
and cancer and nervousness, “How
to Write English,” prospectus from
a forest-planting company, “How
to Become a Magician”—they were
all there. He told me that, having
no friends and being oppressed by
loneliness, he enjoyed writing to
advertisers, and the warm, personal
tone of most of the replies satisfied
in a measure his craving for sym-
pathy.
THE NORTHERN WITCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A chill is in the wind to-night, and the moan
of the oaks a-swing
Is a requiem to a summer gone on the heels of
a fleeting spring.
The seas of space where the glittering Cross
swings over the foaming bar
Of the Milky Way to the outer deep
Look wintry grey as their cold tides creep
From star to shivering star.
But a witch is riding the sky to-night whose
call I needs must heed;
For she has come from the north for me with
a starlit cloud for her steed.
Red are her lips that the northern sun has
kissed into passion-heat;
Fireflies jewel her dusky hair,
Blossoms bedeck her, and she is fair
From her head to her dainty feet.
She leans from her charger’s silver mane and
whispers low to me
Of tropic palms and golden sands and a pulsing
sapphire sea;
Of jungles bright with painted birds, of
mountains rearing high
O’er vale and gorge, where, shaded deep,
The spring-fed creeklets sing and leap
Beneath a cloudless sky.
Grey Winter turns on his southern couch and
yawns with a breath that chills;
The white gums shiver along the creek and a
mist creeps down from the hills.
The northern land with its sun’s caress, or the
south with its rain and snow?
The moaning oaks swing back and forth,
My witch has turned her steed to the north —
And to-morrow I too shall go.
N.S.W.
HERBERT DAWSON.


“El V.”: The alcoholic tomcat of
“A.H.S.” (B. 11/4/’34) who couldn’t get
through a door was a Presbyterian beside
one I used to own. He couldn’t even
see a door when he had had a couple
over the dozen. He used to get the stuff
at the police station. His usual pro-
cedure on returning from his orgies,
which began after the sergeant had
treated him for tick-bite, was to climb
a large tree, drop on to the roof with
a thud, slide down the galvanised-iron
half a dozen times with a noise like the
slag-tip being fed with hell-coke, walk
back to the tree arguing with the family
pup en route, groggily climb to the roof
once more, do another slide and discuss
the situation with a pal amid a rain of
boots and bricks. They usually decided
to settle his condition by walking along
the top of a paling fence—an expedition
which sounded like a graduate bullocky
balancing on a band-saw in his bare feet.
Eventually he would fetch up on the
front porch and howl for water and
admittance. But his dissipation got him
in the end, as it does all topers. Coming
home one night he found himself in the
wrong bedroom —and it was occupied
by an Airedale, who mistook him for a
liqueur chocolate.

“Kariah”: Talking of strange mean-
ings “for the purpose of this Act,”
oysters were once legally defined as “wild
animals,” and as such were not larcen-
able.
* * * *
“Air Valve”: Recent experiments with
a new type of diving-dress in Sydney
waters recall a Western Pacific happen-
ing. An Island steamer, known to be
carrying a considerable whisky cargo,
bumped a reef and sank in comparatively
shallow water. The only dress-divers
available were the navy men on the old
Torch, which happened to be handy.
A man was sent down to have a look
at the wreck. He stayed so long and was
so irresponsive to signals that one of the
P.Os. put on a dress and went down
“A girl stowaway has been found on board, sir.”
“Order the crew to swear in whispers.”
to investigate. He found the first man
in an air-lock between the deck and side
of the ship caused by her tilt as she lay
on her side. Diver No. 1 had his head
and shoulders above water, the face-
glass of his helmet was open, and about
him floated half a dozen empty whisky
bottles broached from a near-by case.
He was dead to the world, and, after
the P.O. had screwed up the glass and
attended to the aircocks, he went to
signal the hoist up. It was then he found
that both the hoisting rope and the sig-
nalling lifeline had been made fast with
clove-hitches round a projecting bolt, so
that was that.
* * * *
“Dai R.”: The mistletoe of the vari-
ous river gums played a great part in
the medicaments of
Barwon and Namoi
(N.S.W.) abos. That
of the spotted-gum
was most favored, it
being held that it
combined the virtues
possessed singly by
several other vari-
eties. The leaves
were boiled and the
juice drunk (spar-
ingly) with water as
a cure for colds,
used as a wash for
wounds, a liniment
for rheumatic and
cognate pains, and in
many other ways.
On the Warrego
once a preparation
of gum mistletoe
juice was given by a
flour-bag abo. to my
father, who was very
near death from a
virulent form of
dysentery then com-
mon outback. The
patient began imme-
diately to recover,
and four days later
(continuing the
treatment) success-
fully rode the worst
buckjumper on the
river. A full-blood
asthmatic friend of
my kidhood told me
that drinking the
stuff gave him
“plenty pfeller
wind.” Some Queens-
land tribes believed that ministering
spirits presided over the river-gum mistle-
toe crop, and -regulated the supply
according to the pre-seasonal conduct of
the tribe.
* * * *
“Blackbird”: In the Riana district,
n.-w. coast of Tas., there is a fine speci-
men of a Durham bull with no more tail
than a guinea-pig. A few weeks after
the dam had been mated with a prize
Durham, the two ran beneath a large
gum to shelter from a sharp thunder-
storm. Eyewitnesses saw the tree struck.
The cow escaped scot-free, but the bull
had his rudder cut off shorter than a
prize fox-terrier’s. And the calf was born
tailless.
“Macaque”: It pains me bitterly to
read the reference by “Snow” (B.
11/4/’34) to monkeys as “catching
fleas.” I am aware this is the general
impression with the Philistines of the
“Why don't you send the boy to school, Ned?”
“A waste of time for a smart boy. Why, I only done three years at school
meself."
public who watch my people attending
to their toilet, but it is entirely incor-
rect. In saying that I have the opinion
of nearly every leading zoologist in the
world. What the Bandar Log are search-
ing for and devouring during this pro-
cess are the tiny salt crystals formed by
perspiration at the roots of their thick
hair. 1 trust that you will publish this
statement in the interests of a much-
maligned and misunderstood folk.
* * * *
“Marsh”: Rabbits have not yet made
their appearance as far north as Camoo-
weal (Q.), but myriads of rats that
periodically come from some unknown
source play just as much havoc. A plague
of them is at present spreading from the
district towards Cloncurry. Previously
the rodents have contented themselves
with eating stores, saddlery and anything
available about the homesteads, but the
latest arrivals have taken a fancy to the
natural grasses, and are digging right
down to the roots. Binghi, at least, is
appreciative; he and his are regaling
themselves on roasted rat, -and wondering
how long the good-pfeller tucker will
last.
* * * *
“H.J.1.”: A far better barometer than
a piece of seaweed (B. 7/3/’34) is a
healthy leech in an eight-ounce phial,
three-parts filled with water.
If the weather is to be fine the
leech lies coiled up at the bot-
tom. If rain is expected the
sucker will go to the top, and
stay there until it fines up. If
wind is coming it will move
about with amazing swiftness
until the blow starts. If
thunder and rain are on the
way it will stay out of the
water and move about with
convulsive motions. In frost
it lies at the bottom ; in snow
it stays at the mouth of the
phial. The top should be cov-
ered with a piece of muslin,
and the water changed weekly
in summer and fortnightly in wintrer.
*** * *
“Herpeton”: Describing a Malay
method of feeding captive pythons—
every zoo in the world employs it—“Bar-
angkali” (B. 11/4/’34) says that when
the first of the string of fowls tied to-
gether is rammed into the serpent’s gullet
with a stick “the first taste of food over-
comes the python’s disinclination to eat,”
and so he swallows the entire queue.
Like all the snakes, the python, having
once started to swallow any object on
which his jaws have closed, must carry
on to the bitter end. Nature has ordained
that his teeth should have such a back-
ward curve that nothing once fairiy
caught in them can be ejected. That is
why snakes are often found dead when
they have tackled a job too large for
their capacity. A classic instance was
a big python in London Zoo years ago
who swallowed the blanket given him to
shelter in during cold weather. His teeth
got caught in it, and then there was no-
thing left for him but to go through with
the job. He got it down all right, but,
never having been trained in swallowing
politicians’ promises, he threw the seven.
* * * *
; “G.R.S.”: From time to time I’ve
noticed in the press that the cocoanut-
trees in New Guinea are not holding
their fruit until maturity, and that a
Government expert is going up to dis-
cover what particular bug causes the
trouble. While managing a plantation in
the West Indies I found that if imma-
ture nuts were planted the trees invari-
ably failed to hold their fruit. This little
piece of advice may help the bug expert
to solve his problem.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko”: “Paumotu” with his
edible and inedible fish of the same
species (B. 4/4/’34) touches on an old
subject. In the Gilberts (called the Line
Islands, because they are the only island
group bisected by the Equator) the natives
subsist mainly on fish, palm-products and
pandanus fruit. Fish usually abounds,
and only when favorite kinds are scarce
are less palatable species eaten. The
expanding parrot-fish is rarely touched,
and then only the after-part. In this
group coral-eating fishes are not viewed
with suspicion. On the contrary, a re-
pulsive fish living exclusively on coral,
which bloats its abdomen, is con-
sidered delicious raw. There are no
actually poisonous fishes, except one
brute which erects venomous spines
greatly dreaded by the barefooted reef-
fishers. Ika ni beka, which we trans-
late into “castor-oil fish,” is highly pur-
gative freshly cooked, but when salt-
cured loses much of its potency. It is
non-poisonous. Yet, in the adjacent Mar-
shall Islands, 240 miles distant, deadly-
poisonous fishes occur. In Jaluit Lagoon
several years ago a meal of such sent
three of the B.P. trading steamer Titus’s
crew west. Returning from shore busi-
ness late for dinner, the supercargo, Tom
Flood, not caring for fish, escaped. In
Jaluit the poison in fish possibly is due
to their feeding until immune on marine
vegetation and coral growing on the
copper sheeting of vessels scuttled in the
lagoon, which include the old John
Wesley, mission barque.
MY REQUIEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are sounds I know will follow me
Away and over the Great Divide:
Clatter and ring of axe on tree,
‘'Whoa” and “Halloo” from a lone hillside;
Cloop of echo where bird calls bird,
Crankle and click of windmill gear,
Snuffle and munch of browsing herd,
Rushing of water over the weir;
Swishing airs in tremulous pines,
Wings upwafting above the fen,
The churn and chuckle of earth and tines,
Aqd homely laughter of hearty men.

PRINCE GEORGE’S ADVANCE
AGENT SENDS HIS IMPRESSIONS
TO THE FIFTH EQUERRY.
lll.— Adelaide.
I’m not sure whether the Prince will
like this town, but. at the civic reception
he must not forget to admire its layout.
The streets run at right angles. Some
run north and south, others east v and
west.. Others again remain stationary.
These, however, are ;looked down upon
by the mobile streets. ; i;■ V
When the City Fathers were Lnaming
the streets they found that, unlike Mel-
bourne, they didn’t have "enpfigh- streets
to use up all the names. But they got
over that easily enough.. As. soon as a
Street crosses the main thoroughfare,
Quilliam-street, it changes its . name.
Quilliam-street is 132 feet wide, and
this also happens to be the figure
fixed, for the J building limit. . This is

Adelaide’s pioneer typist—in a feverish

glenelG. The fashion caught on. and
the authorities accepted the popular
version, but exchanged •; the 2. “gs,” It

SEA MEMORIES.
Mention of the new 73,000-ton
Cunarder reminds me of the time when
my old ship, Fantan Marie, held the
blue ribbon of the Panjang Coast.
With three decks and no bottom, an
early-Victorian bow and a nondescript
stern, she was an imposing sight.
She had two speeds—slow ahead and
slow astern. With a strong breeze and
a beam sea she could also go sideways.
Her crew were picked men. Who
picked them, goodness only knows. The
captain, who combined the duties of cook
and carpenter, was a fine figure of a man,
sft. 2in. in the engi-
neer’s socks (when
he could borrow
them). The engi-
neer was even finer
—in fact, I’ve never
seen a thinner man.
He learnt his trade
driving a steam-
ro 11 e r in Seoul,
but the sea was in
his blood. What
he didn’t
know, about
engines - he
guessed, and
what he
c o u 1 d n’t
guess he
didn’t worry about.
' r The rest of the
crew carried out
the duties of sea-
m-e.n, firemen,
greasers and night-
watchmen. • - Prior
to joining the ves-
sel he had been a
glass-blower,. and
he could still blow
off the froth fairly
adroitly.
My own duties
were undefined. I
was - a sort- of
supercargo—l used
to look over the
cargo and put v the
shore gang on to \
anything worth taking. That, of course,
was in later years. In the early days we
were mainly concerned with bulk cargoes
—green eyes stolen from little yellow
gods. After a while, however, the/supply
ran out—there was a strike or something
in Birmingham, I fancy—and we had to
turn to other lines. *.
Those*were grand old days. Many a
, time have we drifted into Gabosa on the
.night tide, a full half-hour ahead of the
rival packet, having covered the 40 miles
from Pyafut in" 10 hours dead.
It must be 40 years since she piled up
on the Bangarah Reef. It was quite a
genuine .job. .At least she was uninsured,
and the* owner seemed quite upset. The
skipper and engineer got jobs with the
rival line, but I’m not . a suspicious man.
After that I drifted into the opium
business, but my heart went down with
the Fantan Marie.

“The desire for. revenge is strong,”
said Brent. “For eight years I let
it; eat into me like a canker, and when
t did decide to strike I was beaten at the
post. It was all on account of this nose
of mine.” He touched his nose, which
was broken.
“When I was 15 I had a .fight. When
I found what had been done to my nose
I swore that if ever I found my dis-
figurer’s tracks I’d follow him to the
end of the earth and break his nose as
he’d broken mine.
“Years afterwards I came across him.
His left arm had been amputated and
splinters of bone were still giving trouble
in one leg”
“It certainly was an anti-climax, after
waiting so long. You couldn’t fight a
cripple.”
“Looking fierce won’t frighten me. You oughter see my

LAST RESORT.
j The chairman of Flapperpress, Ltd.,
was addressing the board.
“Well, gentlemen, the position of our
morning journal, the ‘Guff,’ is, as you
are aware, rapidly becoming desperate.
In the hope of regaining public support
we have completely altered the original
form of the paper, adding supplement
after supplement. At present we have
the Children’s, Racing, Gardening,

Supplement was considered, but for vari-
ous reasons the idea had to be aban-
doned.
“I have given the matter long and seri-
ous consideration,; and have come to the
conclusion —with which I hope you will
concur—that yet another supplement is
now essential.
“It is daring, perhaps even drastic, but
desperate diseases require desperate

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Eight years ago at sea, T. J. Gaffney
received a wireless message that Murray
King had won the Sydney Cup at 200 to
1. Gaffney raced Murray King in con-
nection with the breeder, E. J. Gorman.
He reappeared as a winning owner at
Caulfield on Saturday, when Our Comet
landed the Khartoum Hurdle. A week
before this smart galloper missed a place
in the Epsom Purse. Lynden, who is in
the powerful jumping team of F. W.
Hoysted, finished second to Belar in the
V.R.C. Grand National Hurdle. Punters
could not see him being beaten on Satur-
day, and the Poitrel gelding firmed to 7 to
4. At no stage did he look a winner. Our
Comet trailed the pacemaker Sarokos to
the home turn. Then he bolted and
scored by seven lengths from Nyerimi-
lang, who finished strongly ahead of
Sarokos. The winner’s time for the two
miles was 3min. 37isec., which lowered
by l£sec. the previous course record.
Victorian turf followers are devoting
attention to the form of jumpers, as
entries will be taken very soon for the
Grand Nationals. Our Comet’s shaping
at Caulfield shows that he is gaining in
stamina. His trainer, D. J. Price, was
associated with the victories of Bribery
in years gone by, and won the Australian
Hurdle with Ballista and Silver Heart.

in the Khartoum Hurdle was Purveyor,
recently purchased by P. K. Padfield, who
prepared Sir Prim for a Grand National
Steeple victory in 1919. Vincent O’Neill,
trainer of Spearfelt, took the Neerim
Steeplechase with Wirrate, who may
catch the limelight at Grand National
time. L. J. Hynes rode both Our Comet
and Wirrate. Since his crash on Red-
ditch in August last year Bob Inkson has
been out of action as a jockey. He rides
work and attends meetings, but so far
the doctors have not given him permis-
sion to take part in races. With Inkson
on the peg, Hynes is Melbourne’s best
’chase rider. He took Wirrate past
Gravelines four fourlongs from home and
won with consummate ease. Drake
earned £4O by running second, after hit-
ting the Leger fence hard.
Though the Melbourne public knew
little about Marabou, they followed the
money with such keenness that the colt
started at twos for the Katandra Two-
year-old. So scared was McShortodds
that he offered 10 to 1 bar one, and
pleaded with punters to back some can-
didate other than the favorite. Marabou
was beaten into third place solely be-
cause of greenness. He lost ground at
the start, and came from the rear of the
field to join the leaders —Bardinet,
Takata, De Graves and Havana —at the
distance. From that stage Marabou hung
in, and W. Cook had to stop riding sev-
eral times to straighten him. Bardinet,
the winner, is one of the best fillies of
her age in Australia, but is not again
likely to give Marabou 2st. and a beat-
ing. Andrew Robertson, whose colors
are carried by Marabou, imported both
the sire and dam —Marconigram (by
Abbot’s Trace) and Vivandiere (by
Buck’s Hussar) respectively.
Segati, second to Rogilla in the Caul-
field Cup of 1932, staged a reversal of
form in winning the Glen Huntly
Handicap. A week before she finished a
poor fourth in a field of five, at Epsom;
on Saturday 25’s went begging about her.
Always near the front, she cleared out
from 14 rivals at the straight entrance
and won, easing up, by three lengths
from Excellic, with Kirrewur a close
third. Naturally the stipes held an in-
quiry, but H. W. Torr gave them a satis-
factory explanation. The stable lost its
money at Epsom and did not back her
at Caulfield.
BVave Boy, favorite for the Glen
Huntly Handicap, did not race at all
kindly for H. Skidmore. His owner-
trainer, M. T. McGrath, was compen-
sated for the downfall of ffrave Boy
when Araunah made his Brighton Handi-
cap rivals look like very small potatoes.
Orford, who took the Glenferrie Handi-
cap, is a very handsome gelding by Pan-
theon. He belongs to and is trained by
F. Godby, who may take him over to
South Australia next month for the St.
Leger and Adelaide Cup.
* * * *
Thought to be badly handicapped,
Colenso, a stable-mate of Peter Jackson
who has raced in Maoriland, Victoria
and Sydney, landed his party some nice
wagers when he won the first division
of the Maiden Welter at Canterbury on
Saturday. Carrying the colors of Mrs.
Smith, wife of one of the brothers who
race Peter Jackson, and trained by W.
Pine, of Taranaki (M.L.), Colenso, after
opening at s’s, went out to 12’s but
closed at 4’s. Ridden by A. E. Ellis,
who is shortly returning to M.L., Colenso
made light of his 9st. 91b. and, after
leading over the last half-mile on a rain-
sodden track, was able to hold off the
outsiders Wuiruna and Top Royal.
Trained on a private track at Stockton
(N.S.W.), Rosmead, who carries the
colors of that once-good performer
Donald, gave Stan Davidson an arm-
chair ride in the second division. He
was always favorite at 2’s, and, clearing
out in the second furlong after an indif-
ferent start, won with a lot in hand from
Leamber and Sweet Annabel, the latter
a nice Magpie mare who should score
shortly. Sunstone was a quiet tip. He
carries the colors of Logan Phoenix,
but ruined his chance by a bad getaway.
That he finished fifth says much for his
chance in a maiden race.
Bred by Greenline’s owner, Leslie Bar-
nett, Fernclove, who cost his present
trainer, L. C. Smethurst, 25 guineas, fol-
lowed up his win at Ascot by carrying
a 71b. penalty in the Park Stakes and
making hacks of the opposition. The
Fernkloof colt, related to Alberic, is out
of Rueco, by Varco from Ruegalla, by
Ruenalf, and is a promising stayer. He led
all the way over nine furlongs after beat-
ing off Upoko Ariki and Flying Moab.
He started at 4’s. The favorite, Fluent,
who once ran a close second to the Syd-
ney Cup winner Broad Arrow, was last,
the soft conditions evidently not being
to her liking,
• . •
Randwick form is invariably a good
guide on suburban tracks, and, with
Multudo out of the way, backers went
solidly for Persian in the Flying Handi-
cap. The latter had run a good second
to Celebrate at Randwick, but was no
match for Loyal Verde (9 to 2), who beat
him easily, with Atucas in third place.
Loyal Verde is trained by W. Landrigan
and is owned by the Singleton sportsman
G. Burns. Later in the day Royal Park,
a stable-mate of Loyal Verde, won the
second division of the Highweight at B’s.
He had no trouble in defeating the pace-
maker Calverhero and Pantilla. Royal
Park, who is in his seventh year, was
ridden a splendid race by Landrigaffs
apprentice, C. Berry. Some time ago this
boy won on Winrose and the pony
Scooter.
Roger de Busli became famous as a
sire because of Rogilla. While the latter
is spelling, Rhamses is keeping up the
good work for the imported stallion.
Starting at 7’s, the Rosehill-trained geld-
ing was sent out in capital trim by his
owner-trainer, J. Davis, and won the first
division of the Highweight in a canter
from Kala Moti and Bonnie Valerie.
Enamour is a genuine stayer, and if he
can get a race run to suit him he invari-
ably shapes well. In the Canterbury
Handicap Montego and Exchequer made
the pace so hot that both were beaten
half a mile from home. These tearaway
tactics suited Enamour (7 to 2)/ Going
to the front at the three furlongs, he had
the race in his keeping from that point.
Old Fingra and the favorite, Akuna, had
a ding-dong battle down the straight for
second money, the former securing it by
a neck. F. Christey is finding Enamour
profitable at the price he paid for him
several months ago (110 guineas). This
made his second win in Christey’s colors.
Betting was so wide in the Ashbury
Handicap that the bookies were all smiles
when the race was over. The locally
trained Hurry Scurry (9 to 2) was suited
by the soft conditions, and, after leading
throughout, won easily from Carat and
the favorite, Captain Rado. The latter
had the run of the race, but evidently is
only moderate, while Burwood is seem-
ingly a thing of the past. He was beaten
a long way from home.
* * * *
Randwick autumn racing indicated that
the game is returning to a more prosper-
ous level. Attendances were much
better than last year, betting was almost
on a par with pre-war days, and buyers
at the yearling sales were keener. With
the meeting now history, the interesting
announcement follows that two promi-
nent breeders, Percy Miller, of the Kia
Ora stud, Scone, and A. G. Hunter, of
the Northwood Park stud, Seymour
(Vic.), have agreed to race in partner-
ship. Both sportsmen have had their
colors carried to victory on many
courses.
* * * *
Despite Jim Pike’s wonderful horse-
manship in winning the Doncaster on
Chatham, and, incidentally heading the
list of riders at Randwick, he is still “in
bad” with a number of Victorians. Last
week he was slated by a Melbourne press-
man for his poor effort on Tingalba, nor
did his riding of Peter Pan appeal to the
visitor. The critic forgot to mention that
since Hall Mark, ridden by Pike, ran a
dead-heat with Limarch in the V.R.C.
St. Leger, when the jockey stated that the
horse was not as good as earlier in his
career, the chestnut has only scored once.
Hall Mark’s poor form at Randwick
proved that Pike’s estimate was correct.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Beth (announced weight 15st. 81b.)
looked six or seven stone heavier than
Bucht (14st. 41b.) at Leichhardt Stadium
last Saturday night. He was not so good
a wrestler, and Bucht outpointed him
from start to finish. A lusty left swing
knocked the Esthonian unconscious, after
which he was pinned, in round four.
Bucht was not big enough to nail his
opponent before the final bell, so Beth
won by one fall to none.
Two old opponents, Tom Lurich and
Joe Dawson, tangled at Newtown.
Lurich’s body-scissors gained a fall in
the fourth, and the Russian was so rough
in the fifth that he did not look a likely
loser. But Dawson dumped him and
evened the falls in round six, the match
ending in a draw.

In spite of threatening weather, the
opening of the Rugby Union in Sydney
drew big crowds to the district grounds.
The big game of the day was the clash
between Northern Suburbs, last season’s
premiers, and Randwick, at North Syd-
ney. Randwick won 18-12 (4 tries 2
p.gs. to 3 tries and a p.g.). Both sides
took a little time to find their feet, and
the first half was mostly a forward tussle,
with the weighty Randwickers getting
the better of it. Northern played the
3-4-1 pack brought back by the Walla-
bies from South Africa, but it failed to
help them to carry the scrums or get the
ball against the orthodox opposition. As
a result their backs, led by'the Wallaby
centre Cowper, had to make most of
their own openings. Randwick’s back
division promises this year to be the best
it has ever had, and Towers seems to
have regained all his old fire and dash.
Behind the scrum the team was hard to
fault from full-back Bedford to Brodie,
the new scrum-half from Waverley Col-
lege. Mention must also be made of five-
eighth Nejaim, from Bathurst, who gave
a sterling display. Larnach-Jones and
hooker Lynch did great work in the van-
guard. The home backs were badly
handicapped by their front row’s failure,
though Gibbons worked well behind the
pack. Callen and Arnold were hard
workers in ruck and loose.
At Manly Oval the home side
beat Western Suburbs 15-11. Manly’s
strong Wallaby contingent failed to hop
up to expectations, though the winners
scored five tries to one. The rest of the
Western score came from a converting
and two penalty goals by Barnes. Uni-
versity had a tight squeeze to lead Drum-
moyne 13-10 at full-time. A great try by
the streaking Kennedy decided the issue
for the students, who again showed in their
old blue-and-gold colors. Last year’s
wooden-spoon Ors, Eastern Suburbs,
passed the buck to St. George by 16-11.
In the bye at Parramatta the resurrected
local club, led by “Wild Bill” Cerutti.
downed the Merewether-Carlton club
from Newcastle 16-11. Parramatta scored
only one try to three, but Peatty, for-
merly of Eastern Suburbs, tacked on a
converting goal and three p.gs.
* * * *
Sydney Rugby League ended its trial
matches last week and, after a match
between a team of returned Kangaroos
and the Rest of N.S.W. on Saturday,
opens its club season on Anzac Day.
The Rest side includes the ex-St.
Joseph’s crack, Beaton, and another
youthful recruit from the Union in R.
McKinnon. Beaton is at outside centre
and McKinnon at five-eighth.
A. C. Aubrey, who has been pushing
Willys cars in Australia for half a dozen
years, some time ago vanished from the
Sydney car world. He has cast up again
in Sydney, and those who imagined he
had been carried off by the fairies of
Hollywood or something like that have
another guess coming. Aubrey has
been putting in hard work with the
Willys people in Toledo (U.S.A.)! He
has come back to join up with Garratt’s,
Ltd., and Overland, Ltd., in Sydney. This
lot will have the dealing-out of Willys
cars and trucks and the new Graham-
cars in the Ma State and Bananaland.

“Richmond”: Dirty play has been
troubling the overlords of Australian
Rules football in Melbourne for some
seasons past, and both the League and
the Association have vainly attempted
to deal with it. The Association has
moved in the right direction with a re-
commendation that players with two or
three disqualifications for all-in play should
become spectators for the term of their
natural life. Time and again men with
several “previous convictions” against
them have been reinstated after a rest.
They are almost invariably on the mat
again after a few games. One gentle-
man’s application was not without
humor. He admitted four disquali-
fications, but added that in future he
hoped to play with the police!
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Some of the old Austra-
lian Rules brigade in Melbourne do not
view the rise of Rugby Union football
there too kindly. Recently a junior
Rugby club applied to Hawthorn Coun-
cil for the lease of a reserve for the sea-
son, the application having been backed
by the Parks Committee and the rent put
down. There were no other applications,
but opposition to the “foreign game”
was heated. Finally the lease was granted
by a small majority, the diehards giving
notice of a move for rescission. They
must have seen the error of their ways,
for at the next meeting no change was
made.

“Lancaster Park”: The M.L. Rugby
Union has issued a five-year plan for the
information and approval of its Aus-
tralian cobbers. The All Blacks will tour
in Australia this season and Britain in
1935, returning via Canada. Australia
will go to the Shivery Isles in 1936, and
the following year the Springboks have
arranged to take on a tour of Australia
and M.L. In 1938, all being well, there
will be another All Black invasion of this
country.
“Mr. Chucks”: None of the press
chroniclers of the performances of Aus-
tralia’s new naval head, Admiral Ford,
have mentioned that he was a Rugby
international and middleweight boxing
champion of the Services. Now that the
years are creeping on, he has taken to
golf. He is said to be doing nearly as
well at it as he did at the games of his
youth.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Two or three of the
young gentlemen who have been flitting
like butterflies from the N.S.W. Rugby
Union to the Rugby League, and then
fluttering back when the honey proved
less appetising than expected, got a shock
when the Union considered a batch of
final applications for reinstatement. Sev-
eral prominent players were refused re-
admission to the fold. One case particu-
larly worth noting was of an 18-year-old
lad who had changed over and played
senior professional football. He was a
candidate for the Royal Military College,
and pleaded that, as only amateur foot-
ball was played in the Service, his League
record would be a handicap to his career.
He, too, was turned down, and his bad
luck should serve as a warning to others
unaware or regardless of what profes-
sional sport may lead to. The Union
itself is to blame. Some years ago it
proclaimed that, after a fixed date, the
gate of its paradise would be for ever
barred to repentant sinners. It never
stood to its decision, with the result that
irritating chopping and changing from
one code to the other has been general.
The time has come to put the lid for
good on applications for reinstatement.

“Gate”: When, after years of grum-
bling, the N.S.W. country players at last

a recrudescence of feeling over the divi-

sion of the gates when the Country comes
to town for its week’s tourney next
month. The lads from the open spaces
asked for 75 per cent, of the net gates,
and it took the townies some time to
recover enough breath to bid 50 per cent.
The State body won in the end, though
as Country will have to pay all its own
expenses the 75 p.c. cut is not unreason-
able, unless the week is a very successful
one financially.
Ins and Outs
“Black and White”: East Torrens won
the S.A. premiership for 1933-4 from
West Torrens by an innings and 80 runs.
The highest batting average in the club
was 42, but there were seven men with
averages over 30. A. J. Ryan (Adel-
aide) headed the State batting list
with 762 runs in 10 completed innings.
Grimmett had the best bowling figures
39 wickets at 10.9, but the aggregate went
to J. R. Davey (Uni.), with 51 wickets
at 12.4.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane”: There is a lot of
guessing in England as to the identity of
the next Test captain. Jardine is defi-
nitely out of the first Test, but may be
mustered later if things go wrong.
Chapman has some admirers, but his
cricket is now definitely out of Test class.
Young Valentine, of Kent, is a popular
fancy, but writer is plumping for Wyatt,
of Warwickshire, who filled the job with
ability in Australia when Jardine was
spelling.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: England has stuck to last
year’s band of selectors, Jackson, Hig-
son and Perrin. “Jacker” was one of
England’s greatest all-rounders in his
time, and Higson is a well-known Lanca-
shire county official. Perrin, once of
Essex, was a tremendously prolific scorer
for season after season, but never reached
a Test because of his horrible fielding.
The selectors will appoint the English
skipper early in May, and he will act
with them in the selection for the first
Test, which is as far as his own appoint-
ment will extend. Test professionals will
get £4O per match, with £3O for twelfth
man. Amateurs draw £2 a day expenses.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Shirley”: Sydney’s Kirk-Windeyer
Cup team flopped like a dropped
kiwi egg in its match with Maoriland
at Auckland, the Shivery Islanders win-
ning 3 to 1 in the singles after pegging
even in the foursomes. Ruwald and Cut-
ler won for Ma in the foursomes from
Silk and Hornabrook, 2 up. The All
Blacks scored with Horton and Wright,
who finished 1 up on Dobson and
Hughes. The singles saw M.L. in the
ascendant. Menzies, whose selection
raised a row in M.L. golfdom, downed
Ruwald 10 and 8, Hornabrook finished
7 up and 6 on Eric Apperly, and the
Horton-Robson game saw the Maori-
lander win 3 and 2. Hughes scored
Ma’s solitary win, 6 up and 5 on Wright,
the M.L. amateur champion. The Aus-
tralians’ work on the putting greens was
ghastly, and this failure to gauge the
slower pace of the M.L. turf had a lot
to do with their defeat. This promises
to be the last match of this series for
some years at least. Meanwhile, N.S.W.
must hand over the cup to the keeping
of the All Blacks.
*l*
“Divot Digger”: One of those queer
happenings which make us wonder
whether golfers walk in their sleep is
reported from England. The Maoriland
associates Oliver Kay and Betty Gais-
ford made their debut in a women’s
foursomes tourney at Wentworth, in
Yorkshire. Both were disqualified be-
cause Oliver played two tee-shots at suc-
cessive holes. The rule forbidding this is
one of the elementary laws of golf.
Oliver Kay is Australasian champion and
acknowledged one of the finest woman
golfers south of the Line, if not the
finest; she has been playing the game
since babyhood, practically. Her partner
has also been playing since childhood,
and was M.L. champion in 1931. Yet
we see this accomplished pair making a
golfing gaffe that a Moore Park flapper
from King’s Cross wouldn’t be guilty of.
He * * *
“Poof”: A* Sydney golf-writer made
much the other day of what he called
a unique accident in which a golf ball
was involved. A player drove into the
edge of the rough, where a man was
mowing. The ball struck the edge of
the scythe and was cut in two save for
a thin strip which kept the halves to-
gether. Writer has an acquaintance who
uses his niblick a lot —being that
sort of golfer. More than once he has
borrowed a new ball to replace one aban-
doned in a bunker, and on the few occa-
sions it has lasted out a round it has
been returned looking as if it had been
attacked with a scythe.
He * * *
“Brassey”: A veiled but nonetheless
deadly enmity is smouldering over the
rival claims of Melbourne and Sydney
to the golf limelight this year. It was
Ma’s turn to have the Australian cham-
pionships held in Sydney, and Mel-
bourne’s suggestion that it would be a
graceful gesture to swap the fixture for
the next Melbourne turn so as to help
the centenary along was rejected by Syd-
ney with contumely. So Melbourne has
put up a rival attraction in a special
tournament, and subsidised it heavily ;
some American golfers are to be enticed.
Sydney then hopped in with the
idea of getting the Yanks along in
“ ’Ow am I shapin'?”
“Like a jelly.”
time for the national open cham-
pionship in October. The Yarra-
villains have countered by intimating
that they will not expect their American
guests until November. Further than
that, Ma Staters allege that Victorian
clubs have worded their professionals
and members to the effect that their pre-
sence in Sydney for the Australian title
fights will be displeasing, as tending to
take the gilt off the centenary gingerbread.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: One of the earliest events
of the European motor-racing season, the
Italian 1000 miles, was run off last week
in very heavy rain. Accidents were con-
sequently numerous, and only 39 of 63
who faced the starter crossed the finish-
ing line. The winner was Varzi, who
drove his Alfa Romeo over the course
in 14hr. 7min. 35sec., averaging 114.6
kilometres per hour. Second was the
famous Nuovalari, also in an A.R. His
time was 14hr. 16min. and average
113.122 kilometres. Only one British
driver finished, F. Hughes, who took his
M.G. round in 17hr. 4min. Lord Howe
and his machine came off second-best in
a dust-up with a lamp-post, and others
were stonkered in various ways.
* * * *
“Silencer”: There is little chance of
Australia being represented at the Isle
of Man Tourist Trophy races this
year, Don Bain, who was expected to
tackle the trip (B. 4/4/’34)), having
found it impossible to do so. If no
one else turns up —and entries close on
May s—Australia will miss the meeting
for the first time in years. Heavy
cutting of the expenses offered by the
Isle of Man promoters has made the long
journey from Australia almost out of the
question. The Autocycle Union, Lon-
don, has, however, notified Dominion
affiliated bodies that it will consider
applications for assistance to approved
riders overseas —so there may be a
chance yet.
* * * *
“Pusher”: Yet another addition to the
interminable list of Melbourne centen-
ary sporting functions. This time it is
a 1000-mile international cycle race over
a Victorian road circuit. The spin is
expected to last a week, and is to take in
as much of the Cabbage Garden as pos-
sible. Prize-money totals £lOOO, and
there are perks of various sorts.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: Hubert Opperman wasn’t
long in getting among the money after
his arrival in Europe. At the big Om-
nium International meeting in Paris the
Victorian won the 15,000 metres —
roughly 9 1-3 miles—in 14min. 50
2-ssec. —was fourth in the timed kilo-
metre, third in the 5000 metres and last
in the “Australian Chase” of 7500 metres.
He was third on the point Scores for the
meeting, headed by the French rider La
Perbie with 8 points.
Racquet and Bawl
“Methuselah”: The effrontery of
modern youth was sickeningly emphasised
in Sydney recently when the Bondi dis-
trict team, composed of small boys who
would have been more fittingly em-
ployed, one would think, in playing
marbles or tip-cat, won the final of the
Eastern Suburbs men’s tennis B-grade
competition. Last year this team won
the C-grade competition, and it is the
only boys’ team to win the silver cups
awarded in the men’s competition for
the association. I mercifully omit the
names of their defeated opponents in the
final, but pillory those of the precocious
infants as a warning. Their names and
ages are: R. Armstrong (15), Bruce
Downey (13), J. Abbesouce (14), J.
Rangeley (14) and G. Selkirk (12).
“Top Spin”: The loss of her cap-
tain, Satoh, looks as if Japan’s pros-
pects of capturing the Davis Cup have
flopped, especially as Nunoi has with-
drawn. However, Nishimura and Yama-
gishi have proved themselves a red-hot
doubles pair by defeating Satoh and
Nunoi, who reached the finals at Wimble-
don last year, in the Japanese champion-
ships, and the Cup is often decided on
the doubles. Fukijura is Japan’s singles
champion, and all three are young.
Ryuki Miki, a player of class who has
been living in England for some time,
is to take Satoh’s place as player-captain.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: There have been lively
times in the Indian L.T.A. over India’s
failure to send a first-class team to the
Davis Cup. The leader of the dacoity is
Madan Mohan, a Davis Cup representa-
tive. India lately resolved to select a team
from Indian players resident in Britain.
One of the lot asked to practise is an
ex-Davis Cup player of 42, and there is
another, with the ominous name of Boob,
who is 50. Some of the others are Indian
army officers on leave, but none of them
is in the first class of Indian tennis. Madan
blames the Indian tennis heads for losing
a pot of money which might have shipped
a team from India over the visit of the
Westralian players. These were hope-
lessly outclassed and were a poor draw.
While he says all were disappointed at
their play, Madan hangs a wreath of
marigolds round the team’s collective
neck for “the charm and manner of the
visitors and their sporting spirit on and
off the court.” But he reckons that even
these were dear at the price: the loss on
the tour came to £lOOO.
Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer”: Jim McGarrigal, one
of the greatest professional sprinters Aus-
tralia has produced, died recently in his
native Queensland a few days after his
appointment as starter to the Q.T.C. and
Brisbane A.T.C. He was in his prime
during the professional ped. boom of the
late ’eighties and early ’nineties, and
swept the board of most of the very
valuable events of those days, including
a Botany Handicap and a Carrington
Cup. A State school-teacher in his run-
ning days, he invested his winnings in
farming. Later he became interested in
racing, and was starter of several southern
Queensland clubs before taking over his
last job.
* * * *
“Blade”: Feminism held high holiday
in Sydney at the annual regatta of the
N.S.W. Women’s Rowing Association.
The star turn was the Australian four-
oared championship—the Queen ought to
be worded to give a cup for this, seeing
the men row for one put up by George
Rex —and this tearing go of half a mile
was won by N.S.W. Queensland was
second, and South Australia third. Vic-
toria, holders of the title, and Tassie
might have been seen approaching the
winning-post as the shades of evening
were falling. From the hordes ot
feminine barrackers present late in the
afternoon, when the family dinner should
have been cooking, it is evident we will
have to add the rowing widower to the
golf and bridge solitaries.
* * * *
“Glenelg”: Adelaide saw an unusual
bowls battle the other day when two rinks
each of left- and right-hand players
clashed on the Adelaide club’s green.
The rubber was the best of three games,
and the mollies won the first. The oppo-
sition came with a strong run up the
straight, however, and took the second
and third. It was the fourth annual con-
test, and the right-handers have scored
every time to date.

Oil manufacture in Australia
From its beginning VACUUM saw in every
turning wheel an opportunity for service.
Whether the need was the lubrication of a
mammoth engine, or a door hinge, the
Company has never been satisfied until a
scientifically correct product has been supplied.
To-day 250 Vacuum products are marketed,
each scientifically correct for the service for
which it is recommended.
For a great many years the Vacuum Oil
Company has been making, in Australia, many
of the products it markets. This activity con-
stitutes a large local industry in extensive
works at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide and Perth, where oils are manufac-
tured, treated, blended and compounded, and
packed into locally-made cases and tins.
Vacuum products ot local manufacture include
a great variety of machinery oils, marine oils,
cutting oils, spraying oils, greases, sheep
branding fluid, sheep dip, leather oils, and many
others. Wherever possible, materials of local
origin and manufacture are used in Vacuum
processes.
The Research Chemists of the Company are
constantly striving to develop new products to
assist the man on the land and generally to
increase the sphere of usefulness of this won-
derful commodity petroleum. A notable
example is Gargoyle Red Spraying Oil,
originated by the Company about 30 years ago,
an effective agent in orchard pest destruction.
Vacuum’s 39-year-old Ideal is to give Australia
a complete service in oil, and to carry Vacuum
products and service to the remotest corners
of the Continent.

“Stretcher”: These rowing officials
are touchy souls. Following on the at-
tempted resignation of coach Keary, of
the N.S.W. inter-State crew, because he
couldn’t see eye to eye with selector
Williams (B. 22/3/’34), the latter then
decided to retire from his job. The heads
declined in this case also. In Brisbane
secretary Smith, of the Q.R.A., has just
bidden a blistering farewell to that body,
and resigned at the same time the manage-
ment of the State crew for the King’s Cup.
About the mildest things Smith said of his
former bosses were that they broke the
rules when it suited them and only en-
forced them when it seemed safe, and
that they were always afraid to do any-
thing definite.
* * * *
“Toowong”: By winning the Queens-
land champion eights on the Brisbane
River, the G.P.S. Old Boys’ Club has the
right to represent the State in the King’s
Cup race at Hobart next month. The
winners are the first metropolitan club
to represent the State since the winning-
club system of selecting the State eight
was introduced, country clubs having
hitherto taken the championship with
unvarying monotony, Wide Bay being
conspicuous among them. Maryborough
and Bundaberg were the country con-
testants this time, and filled second and
third places. The sculls were responsible
for a sensation, Boreham, of Bundaberg,
and Slaughter, of Brisbane, putting up
the rare record of a dead-heat. Slaughter
just caught his opponent on the post after
losing distance through crabbing. In the
row-off next day Slaughter won easily,
thus completing the metropolitan double.
* * * *
“Miaow”: Dismayed by the feminine
outcry because it refused to send an ex-
pensive chaperon to the Empire Games
for the benefit of two girl swimmers, the
Games Committee hastily took refuge
under the bed and announced from there
that if the tabbies could raise the money
to pay for her among themselves a
chaperon could go along. The lasses
allowed they could do it on their heads,
and the saucepan-lid is now being passed
round the women’s clubs. The Empire
people are far from happy, however.
They will have to pick the chaperon
from the candidates offering, a dozen or
so, each backed by vociferous barrackers,
being reported in the offing. A pity the
committee didn’t stick to its original
proclamation that no women athletes
would be sent. In a weak moment they
yielded, with the inevitable result.
* * * *
“Spike”: When the Empire Games
Committee recently decided that it could
not afford to pay a masseur to travel with
the Australian team there was protest,
whereupon invitations were issued to any-
one qualified who would take the job on
in an honorary capacity. It will do no
great harm if the team sails minus the
superfluous official. Massage for athletes
is fast falling out of favor abroad. Aus-
tralians at the Los Angeles Olympiad
were struck by the very slight resort to
the treatment by American and other
competitors. It is of value, of course, in
special circumstances. Otherwise many
good judges now consider it as likely to
be harmful. As practised by some ex-
ponents it is severe exercise, and that
is about the last thing an athlete needs
after hard exertion.
“Gasket”: Victorian yachtsmen have
decided on their centenary regatta pro-
gramme, which is the most ambitious
ever attempted in Australia. By good
luck, many important sailing events
are due to take place in Mel-
bourne this year. These include the
Sayonara, Northcote, Forster and Albert
cups, the Australian 21-footer champion-
ship, and various races for the open
boats. Among outside countries invited
to compete in one class or another are
Poland, U.S.A. and Honolulu —the fam-
ous Papuan canoes of Port Moresby
seem to have been overlooked. The
trans-Tasman race is also to be revived,
the M.L. Akarana Y.C. having donated
a £5O pot for the winner.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
KEEP YOUR FLOCKS HEALTHY.
“Otaio”: “Jumbuck” (B. 21/3/’34) is
right about the value of drenching to
help ward off blowfly attacks. It clears
out the worms, and allows the animal to
get the full value of the feed available.
But the old Scottish method of frequent
change of pasture should be added to the
treatment.
We graziers have been stacking on all
the wool it is possible for a sheep to
grow, and have not been giving enough
thought to dietary. So long as there is
plenty of grass in the paddock, every-
thing is thought to be all right. The
fly is seen to be at work, the sheep
mustered, treated, and, in many cases,
turned back into the same paddock.
My experience over 45 years of active
sheep work has proved that, if sheep are
given a change of paddock at regular
intervals, losses from fly are minimised.
All our fly troubles amount to this:
Flies first attack sick sheep—and those
sheep are sick merely because the grazier
has restricted their grazing area and
limited the choice of grasses necessary
to maintain robust health. A fresh pad-
dock will work wonders even if the flock
in it includes fly-struck sheep.
“Lion”: I agree with “Jumbuck” (B.
21/3/’34) that arsenical drenches cor-
rectly given don’t hurt sheep. In South
Africa all sheep are dosed thus prior to
transfer from sour to sweet veldt:
One part of Cooper’s arsenical-powder
dip mixed with nine parts of common
salt. The dose is one heaped teaspoon
per sheep. Half the dose is given lambs
if weaned, and none at all if still on
their mothers. I have dosed many thou-
sands of sheep with this, and never lost a
sheep. Many would have died if they
had not been so drenched. We also used
to make up our own paddock lick as
follows: —•
One cup of liquid cattle dip well mixed
with one four-gallon tin of common salt.
Cattle and sheep both went mad after
this lick, and it undoubtedly did them
nothing but good. It must be used with
discretion though.
THE CROSSBRED.
“Murrawong”: A Southdown-merino
lamb has the same right to be called a
crossbred as a Lincoln-merino drop, yet
the difference between the two products,
both in mutton and wool, is evident to
any newchum. Actually, the term should
apply to the first cross only, and the
practice of regarding comebacks and
everything that is not actually merino as
crossbred gives rise to various miscon-
ceptions, particularly in interpreting fat-
lamb breeding results and statistics.
- The table attached to The Bulletin
Wool Type Card showing crossing re-
sults should clear up some of those mis-
conceptions and is well worth study by
any sheepman, whether he classes his own
clip or not. He should understand, how-
ever, that, while these results have a
general application, climate and type
variation may make a slight difference.
Half-breds, as a rule, are taken to in-
clude most of the longwool crosses—
Lincoln, Leicester, Border Leicester and
even Romney Marsh, although the wool
of the latter is several counts finer than
Lincoln. Another point to be taken
into consideration is the effect of the
Australian climate on British breeds. The
fleece invariably fines up, and this in itself
shows a further regional variation, as
with merinos.
For instance, a New England Lincoln
fleece would be much finer than a Lin-
coln bred round Wagga. This fact has
also a bearing on the different types of
Corriedale to be seen. It would clarify
matters if we followed The Bulletin
Card’s advice, which, by the way, is
common practice in Maoriland, and de-
scribed the first-cross products of long-
wool-merinos as half-breds. These
crossed back to the longwool ram would
give a threequarter-bred. The same
crossed with a merino ram would give
a quarter-bred, and the further use of the
merino ram on the progeny would result
in a comeback —some of which, nowa-
days, has come back so far that the wool
is finer and more valuable than a great
deal of merino.
‘CHILLED BEEF FOR EXPORT.
“Rich. J.”: If efforts to build up an
export chilled-beef industry are to suc-
ceed, the harm caused by the lackadaisi-
cal methods of Australian exporters in
the past must be undone. The writer
has seen sold in Smithfield markets Aus-
tralian ram and bull beef, all stamped,
of course, with indelible marking. Good
butchers turned up their noses at these
examples of our beef and mutton, and
the only outlet was in the stall trade.
Men in the trade have expressed dis-
belief, and stressed the fact that bulls and
rams are excluded from human consump-
tion under'the Pure Foods Act. Never-
theless, it remains a fact.
Australia can produce the goods, as
witness the beef exported by the Q.M.E.
Co. I remember this brand of fine,
big, well-covered and evenly-graded beef.
Alas, the only beef to find a ready market
now is “baby beef,” the production of
which means a total reconstruction of our
methods.
A study of British markets is impera-
tive, and we must realise that conditions
in England have altered considerably
during the last decade, Small houses,
which are now the vogue, have small
stoves, and small families require small
joints for the Sunday dinner. Good class
“baby beef” suits the British housewife,
and she is the person who counts.
CHOOSING A DAIRY SIRE.
“Bahb Dwyer”: A cable the other
day reported an English authority who
stigmatised current methods of show-
judging cattle as “elaborate humbug.”
An English investigator has demon-
strated that the selection of a dairy bull
for production on type alone is only 20
per cent, efficient.
Of course, practically any pure-bred
bull can effect some improvement in a
nondescript herd, but amongst already
good producers it takes an exceptional
bull to effect further improvement or
maintain a standard.
The sanest practice is to use only tested
sires. The Mount Hope Index System,
which takes its name from the Massa-
chusetts farm on which it was perfected,
permits of a bull’s worth being accu-
rately measured by comparing his
daughters’ production with that of their
dams. If 10 dams produced an
average of 80001 b. milk and their
10 daughters (after making the usual
age allowances) average 10,0001 b., then
the bull which effected the improve-
ment is a 12,0001 b. bull, the yield of the
daughters being midway between paren-
tal levels. Similarly, if the dams’ average
butter-fat was 4 p.c. and that of the
daughters 4.5 p.c., the bull’s butter-fat
figure is 5 p.c. Thus every bull’s index
figure can be calculated for total milk
percentage and total butter-fat, and the
more dam-daughter records available the
more accurate the computation. An
essential of the system is that all pro-
geny must be tested, not a picked few,
which, under the usual methods of test-
ing, cannot give a true index of a sire’s
worth.
Of course, there are drawbacks, chief
of which is the keeping of a number of
young bulls for a number of years until
their progeny can be tested and their
value gauged, but the advantages are so
obvious that additional time and trouble
are recouped many times over. The
Mount Hope Index has been adopted by
many herd-book societies in England, the
U.S.A. and the Channel Islands, which
means that the actual records of bulls
entered in such herd books are avail-
able for breeders to see.
LARGE WHITES AND LOCAL
SELLING.
“Kirby”: The controversy “Austra-
lians as Horsemen,” while excellent for
the purpose of a row, is of little educa-
tional value. I suggest we start an argu-
ment on the relative merits of the various
breeds of pigs for bacon and pork pro-
duction.
While “Joinerson!s” par. (B. 7/3/’34)
is interesting, he is off his horse when
he says the “Large White is the only
worth-while boar for any purpose other
than lard production.”
The L.W. may be the best for the
export trade, as a larger pig is desired
overseas, but the trouble is that there is
no export trade.
There remains the local market. This
demands a bacon pig not over 1301 b.,
preferably between 110-130. The Large
White cannot be fattened at that weight.
It puts food into growth at that stage.
Were the weight to be, say, 1651 b., it
would be the ideal pig, as it can be
fattened well to that level. I know one
factory which always pays less for the
breed because it can’t be fattened to the
required weight.
THE CARE OF LUCERNE.
“F.L.8.”: Lucerne will grow almost
anywhere where there is soil, as “Cas-
silis” said (B. 14/3/’34); but the more
attention and care it gets, the greater the
return.
“Cutting” lucerne on rich alluvial
flats should be treated thus:
(1) Mow at least once a year, even if
you leave the unraked swath on the
ground. Lucerne needs “pruning,” and
this particularly applies when first sown.
The more it is mown the stronger and
better the plant. This is a golden rule.
(2) Cultivate every two years, using a
lucerne renovator or a spring-tyne cul-
tivator fitted with the proper points for
the job. Don’t use a spike roller. It
is apt To spike the plants out of the
ground. The cultivator splits the crown,
which is a good thing, and seldom pull
the plants out. Do the job two ways
and harrow afterwards. Top-dressing
with lcwt. of super, pays for itself many<
times over.
(3) Cultivation should take place about
the end of August, followed by the top-
dressing.
(4) Don’t cultivate a “yearling” pad-
dock. It isn’t firmly enough set to resist
the pull of the cultivator.
(5) Stock as heavily as you like ; but
never eat down to the crown. This will
ruin a paddock quickly.
(6) Don’t stock continually. Give a
lucerne paddock a chance to grow up
well at least once a year.
Grazing lucerne does not need so much
attention. Top-dressing, of course, im-
proves it, and if you can mow it once a
year so much the better.
SALTBUSH FIREBREAK.
“Mulyan”: Tall saltbush planted along
boundaries is a big help in checking a
bushfire. When thick and high, it is
an effective break, which saves the fence
from getting burnt. A periodical scorch
doesn’t do it any harm, nor does drought
affect it. In bad times it is a great stand-
by for stock. Cattle and sheep will strip
it to the ground, but at such times, the
grass being gone, or nearly so, it is not
wanted for fire. It soon shoots out again,
and by the time there is long, dry grass
about it has regained its efficiency as a
firecheck.
Saltbush is easily propagated from
seed, or may be grown from cuttings.
Being hardy and a vigorous grower, it
doesn’t require any attention beyond
sowing or planting. Plough a couple of
furrows beside the fence, and plant in
them. Keep stock away during the plants’
early growth, particularly if the animals
are not regularly supplied with licks.
Along cultivation fences the plants can
be put inside, where they will be pro-
tected from animals until the branches
thicken through the rails or wires. The
inside growth can be cut for green fodder.
Old-man saltbush, so called from its
white appearance, -and the round-leaf
saltbush both grow from 6ft. to 10ft.
high, and thick and bushy. A hedge of
either is a pleasant nesting-place for
insectivorous birds.
WATERY-WOUND ROT.
“Hatter”: In wet seasons the fungus
responsible for potato blight often
causes serious rot in potatoes after lift-
ing. There is, however, another cause
which is most prevalent in hot and dry
seasons, and is particularly apt to attack
tubers lifted early. This is a rot of a
distinctly wet and soft type that starts
from a wound or abrasion of the skin
and not necessarily at the stem end, as
other forms do. The skin is usually
discolored and often stretched flat over
the rotten tissue, which becomes pulpy
and often exudes a thin watery fluid.
This disease is contracted from a
fungus present in the soil which is un-
able to enter the undamaged tuber.
The best method of control is to avoid
injury to the tubers in digging and hand-
ling, especially if the crop is immature.
No injured tubers should be left lying
on the soil to become a source of infec-
tion. Where potatoes are grown in short
rotation on the same ground, all dis-
eased tubers should be destroyed after
digging.
MAKING OVER PLOUGHSHARES.
“Rough Farmer”: To make over steel
ploughshares carry on as follows:
First heat. —Cut a worn-out share into pieces
about 21in. x lin., and draw both ends of each
piece to a point.
Second heat. —Grip securely the share to be
treated. Draw out the wing and straighten
the point. If there is any cast iron or hard
substance left at the point it will have to be
knocked out while the share is hot.
Third heat.—Bring the share point and one
of the pieces to a good welding heat, using
borax as flux. The smith puts the share
bottom up and the striker puts the piece on
top. A few light blows will stick it to the
share. Then bend the piece double around the
point of the share and hammer down tight.
Fourth heat. —Bring the point to a good
welding heat and fuse all together. A few hits
will work on a shapely chisel point, set the
share and straighten the wing.
Fifth heat. —Get a good bright heat on the
point and wing and then plunge in cold water
to harden.
A share laid in this way can be drawn
out and pointed and set until too small
for further use.

THE
AS a definite force for the-improve-
ment of Australian dairy stock and
the increase of Australian dairy
production, the firm of Meggitt Ltd. can
claim considerable achievement over the
past few years.
Practically all stock in Australia which have
made production records, or gained honours
in the show ring, owe such success in part
to the use of Meggitt’s Linseed Oil Meal
in scientific feeding.
The consistent educational work carried
out by Meggitt’s amongst dairy farmers
has unquestionably resulted in permanent
improvement of our dairy herds as well as
greater production of butter. To-day the
Australian dairy farmer owns better cattle,
produces better butter, and adds more to
the nation’s income.

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“J.A.M.8.”: To make an everlasting
handle for a whip, take the skin off the
tail of a freshly-killed bullock and pull
on to the handle, hairy side out. Then
let the completed job dry.
“Horsey”: When top-dressing or sow-
ing grass seed in paddocks where it is
hard to see the wheel-tracks, tie a small
log on to the axle on the inside of each
wheel. This will make a clear mark.
“T.H.F.”: Boot soles can be water-
proofed and preserved by wiping them
with kerosene and then applying two
coats of copal carriage varnish with an
old table-knife blade. Allow 24 hours
between coatings.
“R. 8.8.”: To stop belts slipping, get
about Ift. of old motor tyre tube. Place
in a tin and start it burning with kero-
sene. Pour the melted rubber on the
inside of the belt while it is going, and
it will stop any belt slipping.
“B.O.B.”: The easy and simple way to
raise a down cow is to take a spade, dig
two holes, one for the front legs and
the other for the hind legs—just deep
enough for her to support herself on her
legs if she feels inclined. Then give her
a little damp chaff and bran. As she
gains strength and confidence, gradually
fill the holes up. Presently you will find
her with the herd.
“Old Blue”: Push a straw roller on
the harvester in preference to pulling it
bv side chains. Attach it to the U bolt
of the main beam and axle by a V-
shaped frame (lin. x |in. iron) with a
stay to the cap of the land wheel to
assist in turning. The advantage of this
method is that the relative position of
the roller to the comb irrespective of
the height of the crop is always the same.
“Tee Bee”: If sheep ear-pliers do not
cut clean, close them until the cutting
edge of the pattern almost touches the
mould. Then hold them up to the light
and try to look through them. There
should only be the finest line of light
showing. If there is more, hold the
pattern on the anvil and tap very gently
with a hammer until you broaden it suffi-
ciently to fit neatly into the mould. If
broadened too much in any spot, a few
light rubs with a file will put matters
right.
“Zee”: To sharpen mower knives and
save gashed hands without an emery
wheel, clamp the full length of the blade
firmly on the bench, teeth projecting their
full depth over the edge facing you. Im-
provised clamps can be rigged by using
bolts of suitable length and a section or
sections of 6 x 1 softwood. Pierce the
lid of a 21b. paint-tin with a file, and
then force the file point into the handle.
This forms a very effective guard. With
a little practice you will develop an easy
swing of the shoulders which brings into
play the full length of the file.
“Chipflake”: When wedging anything,
be it a hammer-handle or the felloes of
a wheel, use hard timber on soft or the
other way about. Never use hard on
hard or soft on soft. Particularly in
hammer handles, though the same thing
is applicable in all other wedges, to make
the thing stay put till the cows come
home, first give the wedge a coating of
ordinary writing chalk.
Don’t use a swab for
dressing flyblown sheep. Take a four-
or five-gallon drum with screw top
and airtightly solder a Shrader tyre
valve in the top and a connection
for a |in. hose in the side near
the bottom. Attach about 3ft. or 4ft.
of hose with a Comet or other jetting-
gun on the end. Half-fill with dip, and
pump a few strokes with an ordinary
tyre pump, and you will do two sheep
properly to one against the swab-and-
tin method.
“J. 8.”: To preserve and keep corn-
sacks, sew two lots of three bags to-
gether on end. Hang and fasten in wool-
press the same way as wool bales. Then
dust them with sulphur, fold and lay in
the press, working round. When the first
box is filled, lift the second box on top
and continue laying sacks until about
200 are in. Fasten a bag on lid and then
press in the ordinary way. Fasten with
bale fasteners. When the bale is out
sew up the sides, and you have a tidy job.
“Beefo”: To remove hair without
scraping, soak the freshly-killed hide with
lib. of lime in 4gal. of water for 24
hours. Then brush the hair off with
a hard brush. If the hide is dried, soak
it in a solution of washing soda and
water —lib. of the former to 4gal. of
the latter. Leave for 48 hours ; rinse
in clean water and put in the same solu-
tion as for a fresh hide.
“L. Ansell”: On a hot, dry day, when
all the meat-ants are at home, completely
cover their nests with fine, dry sand to a
depth of at least Bin. During the hour
following noon is the best time. Go the
rounds a few times to fill in the hollows
that will appear as the sand trickles down
the holes. Friend ant soon “gets his”
through suffocation, and the more he
struggles the faster the sand pours in on
top. He has no hope of getting out from
the inside, and it’s up to you to see that
he is not released from without.
“T.W.”: With this method a man and a
good horse can easily pull out a mile of
fencing a day. Cut a strong forked stick,
about 4ft. long—it is better bent —with
bottom ends about 2ft. apart, cut so they
will hook into the ground and not slip.
Cut a “V” in the top of the fulcrum end
end drive a bolt without a head into the
centre of the cut, so that it will fit into
a link of a haulage chain. Lean your
fulcrum, top against the post, bottom
prongs about 2ft. 6in. from the post.
Hook the chain around the bottom of
the post and pull tightly over the top of
the fulcrum and bolt. Then along to the
horse. A steady pull and exit post.
“Myloonga”: An efficient and econo-
mical portable pump unit can be built
from a motor-cycle engine, ranging from
1 h.p. to 2} h:p. Direct-couple the, engine
to a small rotary pump, and bolt a fan
on to the flywheel between the pump
and engine, or at the other side. It
doesn’t matter much where the fan is
placed as long as it induces a current
of air across the flanges of the cylinder.
The fan, of four or six blades, is easily
cut out of a piece of plain galvanised
iron. If the whole unit is bolted to a
frame of 2 x 3 hardwood it is easily
carted about. It can be constructed for
£5, including freight, for an engine can
be purchased at any of the motor-cycle
wreckers from a pound upwards, and a
rotary pump capable of delivering 600
gallons per hour at 750 revs, costs 575.
6d.
“Mrs. N.”: To feed baby calves fix
an oil drum firmly in a corner of the
calf pen. Take the calf away from the
cow and do not feed for 24 hours, as
the calf will have had a good feed and
will feed better if left. Place the bucket
with the mother’s milk firmly in the oil
drum. Put your fingers in the calf’s
mouth, and, holding its head upwards,
gently dribble some milk into its mouth.
It will soon start to suck. When it is
sucking strongly draw your hand quickly
down into the milk. Next time you feed
the calf, place the bucket firmly so that
the calf cannot dislodge it, start it drink-
ing, then go away.
“Greenacres”: “Eos” (B. 7/2/’34) has
not gone very far in his study of what is
becoming a serious problem in Australia,
U.S.A. and South Africa. An apt rhyme
in the “American Fertiliser Review”:
Hordes of gullies now remind us
We should build our lands to stay,
And, departing, leave behind us
Fields that have not washed away.
When our boys assume the mortgage
On the land that’s had our toil,
They’ll not have to ask the question,
“Here’s the farm, but where’s the soil?”
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
Doggy wool was introduced into my sheep
by some flock rams. I have most of thes§
doggy-woolled sheep culled out now but still a
few keep appearing. When doing up my wool
should I scrap this wool or put it with the
second pieces ? —950.
We advise you to continue culling until all
traces of doggy wool disappear from your
flock. This wool should not be mixed with
second pieces, but kept strictly separate, as its
presence in any other line will reduce the value
of that line. If the doggy wool amounts to a
bale or more, market it separately. If less,
forward it in bags or butt to any wool re-
packing firm which runs a pooling system and
thus obtain advantage of sale in main cata-
logue.
(1) I have a cow which drops congealed blood
when milking, and sometimes ropy curds. Cause
and treatment? (2) l have also a young foal
who goes lame in the near front knee for brief
periods. Cause and treatment ? —847.
(1) It would appear that the cow suffers
from some form of chronic mastitis. Treat-
ment of this condition is always unsatisfac-
tory, and it is suggested that the animal be
dried off, fattened and sent to the butcher.
If this is not done, there is a danger of the
disease spreading to other members of the
herd. (2) Impossible from the meagre de-
scription given to suggest any treatment.

Credit-control
Present-day money systems are scarcely
scientific. There probably never has been
a scientific money system. Gold, being
comparatively rare, lasting and pleasing
to the eye, became a standard of value
out of necessity. It was much sought
after in the arts, and became a precious
metal long before there was such a thing
as a gold standard.
Barter, though primitive, was very
likely a satisfactory exchange system in
small, semi-civilised communities where
a person’s wants were confined mainly
to the essentials of life. In a small vil-
lage an individual’s credit —his resources
to meet his future obligations—would be
well known, too. But while barter might
work all right even to-day among the
Eskimos, it became gradually unwork-
able amongst more advanced peoples as
commercial relations spread further and
further from home.
Gold and, to a lesser extent, silver
became the mediums of exchange and
the symbols of value. Then, as commerce
expanded and men began to establish
larger factories and employ other men
at wages, it often became incon-
venient —perhaps impossible—for the
factory-owner to pay for all his raw
materials, plant, etc., in gold imme-
diately. So he either borrowed money
or asked for “credit.” Then banks started
to issue their own notes. Gradually
metallic money drifted into the back-
ground—in good times, anyway. But it
always dashed to the foreground as soon
as bad times came along and doubts
cropped up about the value of “credit.”
If prices for goods and services re-
mained stable, and every man in busi-
ness was capable of meeting his obliga-
tions at any time, the world could
probably get along on credit alone—
except, that is, for the settlement of in-
ternational debts. Practically the only
time metallic money comes to light to-day
is in settling small debts, or when the
credit of some person, institution, bank
or country is suspect. When a buyer
pays a debt to a seller by cheque, the
seller banking the “money,” the credit
of the buyer is merely exchanged for the
credit of the bank. ,
But credit is an extremely delicate
thing, and is very susceptible to strains
imposed by human nature and circum-
stances. Bountiful harvests and famines
are both liable to undermine it. If
stretched too far it generally comes back
with a crash. If abused it has its own
weapons of retaliation.
The most we can ask of credit or any
money system is the free interchange of
goods and services and a trustworthy
standard for future values. This not-
withstanding, many people and politi-
cians believe that miracles can be per-
formed with credit; in a word, it is
looked on as something akin to magic.
So we have often seen shocking misuse,
with consequences that cripple even its
basic function.
In countries with millions of popula-
tion, credit is mainly controlled from one
or two principal sources. It has become
an impersonal thing, and is dealt with
in bulk nowadays, like everything else.
A proper system for governing this bulk-
handling is one of the greatest needs of
present-day society. It is a pity that
Roosevelt didn’t have wiser counsellors
in his experiments in this direction.
Japan and Our Wool
Since 1926 Japan has bought 96 p.c.
of her wool requirements from Australia.
Last year she took 226,000,0001 b., as
against 197,000,0001 b. and 182,000,0001 b.
in the two preceding years. These figures
compare with an average of 97,500,0001 b.
a year over the period 1926-30. The
1933 purchases from Australia amounted
to 21 p.c. of our wool exports.
It is astonishing to think that Nippon
consumed more Australian wool in 1933
than any other country except Britain.
According to figures issued by the Im-
perial Economic Committee, the U.K.’s
retained imports of Australian wool last
year amounted to 230,000,0001 b., as
against 226,000,0001 b. in the case of
Japan. It is possible that Britain will
drop down to second place among our
wool consumers.
Before the war the Japanese were com-
paratively small users of wool. Over the
past eight years, thanks partly to the
gradual westernising of their dress, they
have sprung from away down the list to
fifth place among the world’s con-
sumers. Local manufacture has also
forged ahead. There were 7000 power
“Gimme ten bob for me starvin’ wife and kids, mister.”
“No use for the kids, my man, but I’ll take the wife for a dollar on spec.”
looms in Japan in 1915, 12,000 in 1922,
and 21,000 in 1933. In fact, the greater
part of the equipment has been installed
since the war.
Japan has to import practically all the
wool she uses, though her sheep popula-
tion has nearly doubled over the past
ten years. The climate which suits
the blossoming cherry doesn’t favor
wool-growing. Attempts are now being
made to improve the fleece of sheep in
Manchukuo (there are about 3,000,000
head at but it will be many
years before this is likely to affect the
demand for even our coarser-quality
wools.
There were apprehensions in Australia
that much of the extra wool which Japan
had taken over the past three years was
on speculators’ account, and had gone
into stocks. There has certainly been an
upward movement in the average stocks
held in Japanese warehouses. But they
are not at present out of proportion to
the increased consumption. At Novem-
ber 30 last they totalled 39,000,0001 b.
The Commonwealth Bank further re-
duced the interest rates payable on fixed
deposits for six months and over by an
all-round quarter per cent, last week.
The trading banks are falling into line.
On one-year deposits the rate is now
2\ p.c., exactly half that of January,
1930. The Stock Exchange had antici-
pated the drop as far as Consols were
concerned, and long-dated issues have
been priced in the vicinity of £lOB for
some time. But sound industrials, gas
and insurances cos., moved quickly off
the mark after the announcement. Lower
interest rates should tend to send capital

Politics are already complicating the
coal-oil question. Most people have
taken it for granted that the Mait-
land (N.S.W.) field will be the site for
any Government-assisted hydrogenation
plant; the Greta coal is rich in volatiles,
from which gases and oils are obtained.
But Vic.’s brown-coal deposits have
come into the picture—lmperial Chemi-
cal Industries has taken an interest in
them for some time—and the usual inter-
state wrangle is brewing. To work
economically, a plant costing £8,000,000
would be required, capable of supplying
most of Australia’s requirements. Quite
apart from any bounty necessary to
establish the industry, there would be
a loss to the Commonwealth Treasury of
a gallon excise on petrol now im-
ported. Newnes shale-oil deposits,
worked on a modest scale, would pro-
duce only a fraction of Australia’s fuel-
oil requirementsrbut would represent in-
surance against complete dependence on
other countries for oil in time of emer-
gency. The effect on excise revenue
would be trifling. This is the problem
as most politicians see it.

“Tops”: Bradford expects much from
a new fabric which should also help
the demand for wool. It is made
of rubber latex and wool, the rubber
being absorbed during spinning. It is
specially designed for car-upholstering,
and is smoother, warmer and more dur-
able than leather. The fabric can be
dyed any color, and tints won’t wear off
as in the case of most colored leathers. It is
two-thirds the cost of leather, and saves
51b. in the weight of an average car-
body.
* * * *
“Keg”: Have come to the conclusion
that the war-service-homes people are
not trying to sell those 1765 houses
(B. 4/4/’34) on their books. . Prices
are the trouble. They want to.sell at
1929 valuation to men who are on 1934
wages; and it simply can’t be done.
Someone should take them gently by
the hand and tell them that the boom
has burst.

Washington has thought fit to send a
cable telling us that Uncle Sam bought
65.4 p.c. more goods from Australia in
1933 than he did in 1932. It looks im-
pressive until we find that even with this
increase Sam’s 1933 purchases from us
were only 7,680,000 dollars, as against
the 26,283,000 dollars which we have to
remit for things we bought from Sam.

Tung-oil experimenters in Maoriland
have been encouraged by an American
analysis of nuts grown by E. S. Little at
Keri Keri. Oil content was 25.9 p.c., as
against 18 to 23 p.c. for best Florida
nuts. The British chemical industry is
looking for Empire-grown tung oil; the
Maoriland experiment is encouraging,
though the amount of suitable land avail-
able has yet to be ascertained.
* * * *
“Sheet Anchor”: Roosevelt’s concern
about the threatened strike in the U.S.A.
motor industry arose from the fact that
it finds jobs for 10 per cent, of Yankee-
land’s population. For instance, Henry
Ford’s daily bill for wages and material
during January last was £350,000, and
for the full month over eight millions.
And those are small figures alongside
concerns like General Motors and
Chrysler.
* * * *
“Kariah”: In a recent “S.M.H.” article
T. C. Roughley, B.Sc., claims that oysters
will live for ten days out of water in
summer and three weeks in winter. From
practical experience, I know it to be
quite easy to keep oysters for five to six
weeks in winter, while in summer, if
placed in a cool spot, they are perfectly
good to eat after three weeks. The taste
of an oyster taken straight from the
water is much inferior to one which has
been allowed to absorb the water in the
shell for three or four days.
* * * *
“Hevea”: Rubber-marketing costs
promise to be further reduced by a pro-
cess which permits the latex to be trans-
ported long distances in liquid form.
Tanks holding 12,500 gallons are used
for the purpose, and a number of the
ships trading with Malaya are now being
equipped. Crepe-rubber sheets require
careful packing and special stowage ; the
new bulk system is expected to eliminate
this worry.

The Balranald, a 13,000-ton P. and O.
passenger liner, arrived at Melbourne the
other day with no passengers, their place
being taken by extra cargo—93oo tons
altogether, loaded at Liverpool. The Bal-
ranald drew 32ft. of water in Port Phillip,
and had to tie up at Station Pier, Port
Melbourne. The Bendigo did a similar
trip about 12 months ago.

“Sandig”: As one whose combatant
war service began with the Landing and
ended with the Armistice, I fail to see
why Anzac Day should be a day of
mourning (B. 4/4/’34). Whatever
parsons, politicians and non-combatants
may think, no special day is necessary
for the survivors of those war scenes to
recall the memory of the men who gave
their lives so bravely and cheerfully.
Nowadays, as a general practitioner, it
falls to my lot to see sacrifices just as
heroic as those of the war years, so rich
in friendship. Hence on Anzac Day a
football match, a church parade, will
engage my attention.
* * * *
“Runa”: To seasickness and airsick-
ness and motor-sickness (B. 4/4/’34) add
mountain-sickness, the downfall of many
an aspiring alpinist. For no apparent
reason some persons are peculiarly liable
to it. Some years ago a popular M.L.
medico, whose ambition it was to stand
on the summit of Egmont, used to make
periodic attempts on the peak, always to
collapse about the 6000 mark with a
sudden and violent attack of mountain-
sickness. And although he studied his
own case intensively and prescribed for
himself a variety of remedies, he was
invariably compelled to retire whenever
he reached the same level, while ancients
and mere children went gaily on to the
summit.
* * * *
“Colley C.”: It almost looks as if
John Masefield will be the lion at the
Melbourne centenary; the “Age” rather
mournfully records that only four of the
overseas celebrities invited have so far
accepted. After all there’s only one Lau-
reate, and there have hardly been a score
in all since Elizabethan times —the records
about Edmund Spenser’s predecessors are
dim and not very reliable. If Masefield
does come he will be the first of his line to
feel “the long wash of Australasian seas.”
But travel is no novelty to a poet who
has run away to sea in his time, and
hustled for his crust as a barman; it is
impossible to imagine Wordsworth or
Tennyson scrubbing decks or mixing
cocktails before they settled down to
poetry as a trade. Masefield obviously
represents a new departure in Laureates,
and the reference-books are very silent
about everything except the books and
plays he has written. The “Age” says he
was born at Liverpool of humble parents,
but I have more often seen Hereford-
shire claimed for his birthplace.

and other accessible surfaces ; but the
Premier declares that “difficulty is experi-
enced in adequately enforcing the law.”
This is a mystery—it seems to be quite
enforcable in other States.
* * * *
“Vic”: When Nemarluck (the abo.
now under sentence of death for having
scuppered a few Japanese in an argu-
ment over the payment for some ladies
brought on to a lugger on approval) came
to Darwin, it was discovered that he had
a unique record. The savage, despite his
reputation as a “warrigal,” a “fierce
native tribesman ignorant of the white
man’s law,” with which the flapper press
has dowered him, proved to be a Gov-
ernment House messenger with several
years’ service to his credit. He is pro-
bably the only one in Australia who has
belied the suavity for which his numerous
tribe is noted by hitting a foreign visitor
with a tomahawk.
* * * *
“Chest”: All this suppression of shirts
in Europe reminds me that ordinances
affecting certain of our tropic possessions
prescribe areas in which gentlemen must
wear shirts —and ladies, too. Color is
left to the wearer’s taste, but when he
has worn it for a few months the
original hue doesn’t matter, anyhow.
Among ladies the law is useful. Mary
acquires a blouse of the latest fashion
when she is about ten years old. If
she is careful, it will last her a dozen
The N.T. Again
“Mataranka”: The Minister has hinted
in Canberra that “important develop-
ments concerning the Federal Govern-
ment’s plan to develop the the Northern
Territory under the chartered-company
scheme are impending.”
The- scheme which the Government is
now reported to have in mind is a de-
lightful one —for half a dozen lease-
holders and speculators. The Govern-
ment, which in 1924 let a seven million
pound scheme go west, because G. F.
Pearce, then Minister, felt it could not
even atford to extend leases 20 years and
give lessees security of tenure, is now
prepared not only to give them security
of tenure but to find all the money for
a speculative plan in which not more
than half a dozen stations will be in-
volved—some of them to-day carry few
cattle, and the coastal section is sour
flood-water land. The Commonwealth
may find all the money on loan—about
£2,000,000 —to build a railway and
meatworks, thus taking all the risks, and
the few leaseholders are to be given a
monopoly of the Barkly country. The
scheme will involve building a new port
and various other operations, and will
add roughly £BOO per head to the national
debt of the N.T. as a whole.
The plans are accompanied by the
usual ballyhoo—among other things, it
is stated that the Barkly country is suit-
able for sheep. But sheep were tried there
and failed time and again. No man in
his senses who saw the country could
say that it was sheep country or could
be made into sheep country without 15
years of acclimatisation work and inten-
sive shade and water provision costing
millions. Had it been natural wool coun-
try Queenslanders just across the border
would have rushed it in the boom days
of the last decade when Tabrax wools
were bringing up to 52d.
The populative effort of the N.T. in
1932-33 may be summarised thus:
Deficit of immigration over emigration 104
Less excess of births over deaths .. 6
Net loss of population .. .. .. 98
The white population is 900 (or 25
p.c.) less than it was in 1919, and the
true national debt appears to be about
£l5OO per head, while the annual expen-
diture per head of white population pans
out at about £270 and the deficit
at £2OO per head. Interest alone costs
£l5O per head p.a. Something needs
doing—perhaps, if the debts were written
finally into the Commonwealth national
debt, a subsidy of a couple of hundred
thousand p.a. were handed over and the
whole of the leaseholders and business-
men were given the right of self-govern-
ment and enabled to form their own
destiny without Commonwealth interfer-
ence, development might come of it.
The test of such a scheme as is now
put forward is whether it can finance
itself under reasonable leasehold and
taxation conditions. If it can’t, then
the Government certainly should not
finance it to the extent of a sum equal
to the annual income taxation of one of
the larger eastern States. Such an
amount, used to relieve Queensland tax-
payers, for instance, would give an im-
mense fillip to the pastoral industry
there, and do more for the meat business
in one year than the Barkly scheme will
do in twenty.
If the Commonwealth is not willing to
make the Territory as a whole self-gov-
erning, then a sound alternative might be
to hand the problem over to the Queens-
land Land Administration Board, which
has had great success in stabilising the*
position just across the border. It is an
expert body which has the confidence of
the whole pastoral industry in the
northern State, and is beyond the reach
of the lobbyist.
“Oke”: Dr. Keither Fairley, of the
Walter and Eliza Hall Trust, supports
“Obsidian” (B. 4/4/’34) in a report which
shows how serious the northern lead-
poisoning position is. He declares
that chronic nephritis in persons
under 40 years of age is three
times as common in Queensland as
in other States, and that the child-
ren of the North hold second place only
to those of Japan as lead-poison victims.
Actually regulations have existed in
Queensland for ten years prohibiting the
use of lead paints on verandahs, railings
“Great jackass of Jerusalem! Are they breeding zebu mules, now?"
years. By that time she will have grown
considerably, and, as she grows, the
stretch of bareness between her upper
and lower garments is as good a guide
to her age as any tribal birth certificate.
* * * *
“Baino”: There undoubtedly is little
justice for the black man ; he is always
tried and condemned by the press
before conviction. For instance, all state-
ments show quite clearly that the natives
who arrived recently at Darwin from
Caledon Bay came of their own free will
and not in police charge. Some of them
actually appear to have called on the
lugger master and asked to be taken to
Darwin to explain themselves. At a stage
when there was not a tittle of sworn
evidence that they committed the mur-
ders, and not. a single one of the men
concerned had been formally arrested,
a leading newspaper referred to them as
“captured killers”!
* * * *
“Sailor”: I can back “Isee” (B.
28/3/’34) about native antiphlogistine.
An Arawa (New Britain) kanaka came
in with a spear through the lower por-
tion of his chest and sticking out of his
back about a foot. I sickened at the
sight, but not so the medical tul-tul.
He snapped the spear off about an inch
from the wound and drew the remainder
right out of the silent man’s back. The
old chap then cut away the ragged flesh
with a pig-knife, plugged the wound
with red clay and finished the job off
with a green leaf and the lava-lava
bandage. The kanaka never murmured.
I asked the tul-tul how long the cure
would take. Said he: “Long time leaf
he dry altogether dis one kanak’ ’e all
right.” He was right.
* * * *
“Red Wul”: The Bulletin’s warning
that meatworks near wharfs are neces-
sary for successful chilled-meat shipment
is timely. N.Q. hopes that the trade will
bring back the prosperity the cattle in-
dustry enjoyed 15 or 20 years ago when
five meatworks were operating. Of the
five, only three, each a few hours by rail
from their ports of shipment, are now
working. The other two, Burdekin and
Biboorah, are partly demolished and the
rest of the buildings and machinery are
beyond repair. If the trade expands as
is hoped, there will be need for more
modern-equipped plants adjacent to deep
water. Coastal sites with sufficient fresh
water, adequate pasture and a port can
be found between Townsville and Cairns.
It might mean that cattle will have to be
brought a few miles further from the
west, but beef travels better on the hoof
than as a carcass.

“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Sharply defined waists and leg-o’-mutton
sleeves seem to have made us all womanly
again. The bicycle has reappeared, and is to
be met on secluded roads, early in the morning
or towards dusk. Toowoomba reports that
maidens in shorts have been seen careering
about the roads on velocipedes that once be-
longed to their grandmammas, and there are
grave fears that archery and croquet will
return to their Victorian eminence. As
usual, there is a catch in the new hobby, from
dad’s point of view. An entirely new outfit is
indispensable, some mysterious authority having
decreed that plus-fours and tailored coats must
be worn by the lass who travels on two wheels.
Twenty years ago Brisbane possessed two
pretty sisters, Marie and Rita Collins. Marie
was tiny and dark-haired, with eyes like out-
size pansies. Rita also sported dark eyes
and a head of the loveliest curly Titian hair.
Both had wonderfully good voices. Then
Marie —who broke the hearts of musical Bris-
bane by throwing up what promised to be a
brilliant career as a songstress—married Ewald
Grose, and since then has concentrated on
husband, home and family. She is packing her
trunks for a trip to England to stay with
sister Rita, whose first husband was a Mr.
Brown, and who recently married a Mr. Cour-
lander. Nancy Brown, the film star, is her
daughter. The two girls are nieces of those
well-known Brisbane figures, Mo and Abe
Barrington. Barrington was their business
name, as it had been the handle which figured
on the playbills in the days when the brothers
lifted tuneful voices in grand opera. Arthur
Benjamin, Queensland’s famous pianist, is Abe’s
only son.
Freda Bage, principal of the Women’s Col-
lege within the Uni., is patroness of the
Queensland Women’s Hockey Association, and
recently was honored by being made the first
life member. There is a newly-formed Brisbane
Women’s Hockey Association, of which Mrs.
S. E. Travill is patroness, although she still
spends most of her spare time on the golf
links.
At least one burning question in connection
with Prince George’s Queensland visit has been
solved, He is to stay at Terrica station.
McLeod, the owner, is a returned soldier with
a couple of wound stripes; a good sport
and a fine horseman. His father, Roderick,
was a noted horseman in the days when
Queensland bushmen . rode as easily as
they breathed. There are two grown-up daugh-
ters, pretty girls, and some younger children,
who will be brought home from school to
meet the King’s son if his visit doesn’t happen
in holiday time. Mrs. Scott McLeod has been
chased by all the local society writers and
asked for sidelights on the Prince’s visit, but
she has resolutely refused to make any com-
ments or to outline the mode in which the
royal visitor will be entertained. Scott himself,
between puffs of his pipe, says he thinKs
they can give the Prince a good time. Terrica
is a lovely, rambling old house, which com-
bines the mellowness of age with modern com-
fort.
The same suite at Parliament House that
Edward P. occupied is being dusted and gar-
nished for brother George. It is a good idea,
since it provides him with a bachelor estab-
lishment, and permits him to relax a little
whenever he can escape from the great white
light that beats upon the famous,.
There is some talk of a huge dance during
the Brisbane visit, and determined females, of
all sizes and ages, have commenced to work
any oracle they can find, with a view to en-
suring their own appearance. As the visit
happens about December, when the Queensland
weather is more suitable for mixed bathing than
for mixed dancing, it might be a good idea if
those responsible for the thought counted ten
and tried to think of something else.
A terrible thing nearly happened last week.
Two brides, complete with bridegrooms, brides-
maids, bouquets, etc., discovered, quite by
chance, that they had invited all their friends
to attend the same church at the same hour.
Followed frantic ringing of the telephone and
honeyed voices suggesting that perhaps So-and-
so would like to be married at 6.30 or 7.30, in-
stead of 7, the hour on which both had set
their hearts. As neither bride would alter the
time, one of them had to make hurried
eleventh-hour arrangements and find a new
church and a new padre to do the knot-tying.
The two couples were Dorothy Brand and
young N. Jeffrey; and Beryl Rigbye and Frank
McConachie. St. Andrew’s, South Brisbane, was
the church chosen, but the Brand-Jeffrey affair
was translated to Holy Trinity.
Mrs. Forgan Smith’s garden party in the
Museum grounds, in aid of the funds of the
Social Service League, was a success, the
weather relenting for that afternoon only. His
Ex. and Lady Wilson came along, as did
Forgan Smith’s understudy, J. Mullan. Quite
a number of the guests brought gifts of
material for making into garments, as well as
opening their purse-strings.
Mayoress Greene opened the large concert
room at the City Hall and invited leading Bris-
bane women to say bon voyage to Lady Wilson.
Baskets of pink flowers set on stands lent a
frivolous air to the big room, and Ned Tyrell’s
orchestra supplied accompaniment to the buzz
of conversation. A picture hat of beige straw
and a floral georgette in tones of grey and
green garbed Lady Wilson. Miss Wilson wore a
black silk beret and a frock of black-and-white-
patterned crepe, and the Mayoress wore a
jacket suit of metallic green and a brown velvet
beret. Patricia Honner, sister of the A.D.C.,
who was staying at Government House, was
with Lady Wilson; and other notables included
Mrs. Forgan Smith, Chief Justice Blair’s lady,
Tom Bilbe Robinson’s lady (the Bilbe is now
insisted on), the Glasgow lady, N.C.W. leaders,
women’s club officers, aldermen’s wives and a
sprinkling of the squattocracy.
Miss Wilson went out to
Montrose and spent some
hours among the children,
who, thanks to the Rotarians,
are getting not only care and
attention, but also a good
education. Pat Honner (the
sister half) and Pat Bell, just
back from Sydney, went with
her. Seated in invalid chairs,
or gathered about tables, all
but one of the little inmates
were busy with their school
work. In spite of their han-
dicaps they are a conspicu-
ously bright-faced, happy-look-
ing mob.
The postponed wedding of
Blanche Somerset and Ken-
neth Robertson happened at
St. Andrew’s Church, South
Brisbane. The church was
packed, and the pretty bride
looked none the worse for her
illness.
There has been a great gathering of the
clans at the Indooroopilly home of the senior
Ross Munros. Ronald Munro and his wife
are under the parental roof, and Roy Munro
and his wife (both boys married Sydney girls)
came down from St. George to join the family.
Mrs. Clive Reid —she was Margaret, and is as
tall as her sister Mrs. Jack Chandler is tiny—
and her children arrived in Brisbane by the
Ormiston and joined the party.
Said to relate, our Greater Brisbane Council,
after behaving much better than the usual run
of such bodies (if statements in the southern
press are to be believed), finished up with some-
thing verging on a brawl at its final meeting.
Aldermen now are in the throes of their elec-
tion campaigns. There is keen competition for
the Lud Mayor’s job, as it is practically a cer-
tainty that the wearer of the rabbitskins will
catch a handle to his name as a result of the
Prince’s visit. J. W. Greene, present wearer
of the chain, is tipped as the winner.
Betty Anning has changed her name, to Brown.
She is elder daughter of Mrs. E. W. Anning,
of Ascot; her husband is young Tom Brown,
son of the late Tom H. Brown. St. John’s
Cathedral saw the wedding, and Amy Anning,
Ray Moni and Beatrice Hart were bridesmaids.
At the end of June Verna Rudd will sail for
New Guinea in the Macdhui, to be married to
J. R. Graham, whose parents are old Brisbane
residents, who now live at Indooroopilly. The
wedding will be at Salamaua, as soon as the
ship gets in, and Mr. and Mrs. Graham will
go on from there to Bulolo, where the husband-
to-be is stationed.
When Asenath Rylance marries Mr. Egan
this week she will have her sister Mrs. D. E.
Mactaggart as matron-of-honor, and Sheila
Egan, a Sydney girl, sister of the ’groom, as
bridesmaid with Zeita Rylance, another of the
bride’s sisters. All the handsome Rylance
girls have unusual Christian names.
The Lyceum Club entertained in honor of
Winifred Ponder, Frankie Payne (Mrs. Clinton)
and Mrs. Alan Vickers, wife of the flying doc-
tor. Mrs. Firmin McKinnon, Mrs. E. E.
Munro, and Winifred Moore were the hostesses.
Prof. Steele, one of the original four mem-
bers of the Faculty of Queensland Uni.; and
the first president of the board, died last week.
No greater tribute to any professor could be
paid than that offered by the students of the
Uni., whose commem. day procession volun-
tarily was abandoned by them as a mark of
respect. They also offered to cut out the sing-
song on the steps of the City Hall, and to
keep mute while the degrees were being con-
ferred; but the authorities, while accepting the
dropping of the procession and the sing-song,
refused to cut the whole of the gaiety out of
the proceedings, as they felt that Prof. Steele
would not have desired it. The degrees were
conferred in the afternoon, and at night the
students held a dinner and dance.

(1) Highest typewriting speed in Australia re-
corded on previously unseen copy ? (2) Highest
speed on repeated work ? (3) Average number
of letters to a word in these tests ? (4) Penalty
imposed for errors? (5) Name of present Aus-
tralian champion ? (6) Queensland champion ?
—922.
(1) 93 words per minute. (2) No official
record. (3) Five. (4) Ten words per error.
(5) Miss Phyllis Price. (6) There is no Queens-
land championship.
From what parts of the world do (1) the so-
called Afghan hawkers and camel-drivers of
Australia and (2) the Hindu laborers found
chiefly on the N. Coast of N.S.W. and Queens-
land come from ? —llO9.
(1) Although the term used in the back coun-
try may cover all Asiatic camel-drivers and
hawkers, including Syrians, the original camel-
men were Pathans (pronounced Pat-tahn) from
Afghanistan. While most of the Afghan tribes
follow agricultural pursuits, varied by warlike
raids on their neighbors, the Ghilzai Pathans
are nomadic and, in addition to having
operated the camel caravans into India for cen-
turies, possess remarkable skill as irrigation
engineers. Practically all the original camel-
drivers in this country are Ghilzais; their lan-
guage is Pushtu and by religion they are Mus-
sulmans (Sunni sect). (2) The so-called Hindu
laborers are Sikhs from the Punjab, n.-w. India,
whose religion is opposed to Hinduism and
Mohammedanism. They are good soldiers and
agriculturists. All wear beards, their religion
forbidding them to cut the hair, and the hair
of the head is twisted up and secured with an
iron comb under the turban. ,
(1) How to arrest baldness? (2) Suitable
bedroom exercises to keep muscles flexible, and
in particular to reduce waist line ? —lOl2.
(1) Massage a bay-rum lotion into the hair
roots daily. Add a trace of castor oil if the
scalp is dry. An occasional singe benefits by
strengthening the hair shaft. Meanwhile give
attention to health; if nervous or debilitated
take an iron tonic after meals. Avoid tight-
fitting head wear, and apply warmed olive oil
overnight before shampooing once a week.
Use coal-tar soap and hot water for the latter
purpose. (2) Bending movements, touching
the toes, etc., must be indulged in before the
morning bath. Be moderate with such exer-
cises at the start.
Following the fitting of a new dental plate
which chafes the tongue, I am unable to get
the ulcers to heal. My dentist says I suffer
from leucoplakia. Is this dangerous and is
thPYP CL CHYP ? 977.
Not likely to be fatal. Mouth-washes of
glycerin-thymol, bicarbonate of soda, etc., are
of service for relief. If the persists,
get medical advice.
Definition of medical term “Coli com-
munis” ? —966.
It is a bacillus or germ bacteria, from in-
fancy to old age a normal inhabitant of the
intestines and lower bowel. In certain con-
ditions, typhoid, etc., the B. Coli becomes
virulent; inflammatory renal affections may be
associated with its presence. Metchnikoff based
his theory for the prolongation of life on re-
sistance to this bacterial growth, the lactic acid
bacillus being introduced as an antigen in
senile conditions.
My optician tells me my nerves have gone,
causing the muscles of my eyes to be weak.
Is there any such thing as ‘ eye exercise .
I have always understood that suitable glasses
corrected the eyes. —9s4. .
Apart from local treatment, exercise for the
eyes is usually advised when muscular weak-
ness is evident. There is no set routine- pre-
scription depends on results of examination.
Faults in accommodation, astigmatism, etc.,
may be corrected with suitable glasses.
What is the respective value of morning and
evening physical exercises ? I have kn,own
people who say they cannot do early-morning
exercises without upsetting themselves, whereas
at night they feel fit to exercise.— loo7.
Depends on the individual. The trained
athlete can exercise at any time without in-
jury. The debilitated subject must not indulge
in strenuous exercise on an empty stomach.
The worker, on the other hand, must not over-
tax the heart after an active day’s work; rest
is then required. , , , ,
What is the normal rate of pulse-beat for
a healthy adult ? —929. .
Seventy to eighty beats per minute. In
infants it ranges from 120 to 150 beats per
minute, at three years from 80 to 110, at seven
years from 72 to 90, and at 12 years from
70 to 75. There are many cases on record
of habitually quick pulses, and also of un-
usually slow pulse rates, in apparently healthy
subjects. Most fevers quicken the rate, but in
typhoid fever the pulse is slow. This is a
recognised sign of the disease.
I discovered a huge spider of a royal blue
hue which attacked and killed in 15 seconds
a half-grown mouse placed with it in a tin.
Of what species was this spider ?— 846.
There is no known large blue spider. If you
forward a specimen of the spider, preserved in
methylated spirit, to the Australian Museum,
it may be identified.
I live at Cobar ( N.S.W. ). (1) Can my name
be included on a jury list without my consent ?
(2) What is the penalty if I don’t appear at the
court? (3) Is there any way I can have my
name removed from the list ? (4) What is the
farthest distance they can compel me to attend
from ? —Bll.
(1) Yes. (2) The Court has power to inflict
a penalty not exceeding £2O for non-appear-
ance as a juror. (3) Statutory grounds upon
which a person may claim exemption are set
out fully in the Jury Act. (4) So long as the
juror is in N. S. Wales he is liable to be fined
for non-attendance at the court.
How is the date of Easter calculated ? —984.
Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after
the full moon which happens upon or next
after March 21. If the full moon falls on a
Sunday, Easter Sunday is the Sunday after.
Church of England Prayer Book contains tables
by which Easter can be calculated up to the
year 2199.
(1) Where can I get details of construction
of the Welsh harp? (2) Could I get strings
for a half-size model ? (3) Would it be worth
while, musically ? (4) Should wood or metal
be used for frame? —1100.
(1) See Grove’s “Dictionary of Music” (1898
edition), p. 443-44. (2) Might be strung with
banjo wires. (3) The effect would probably be
very poor. (4) Wood would give a sweeter tone.
I wish to put a ceiling in a couple of rooms
made of bush timber (not sawn ) and cemented
bags. Is Sisalkraft suitable for the purpose ?
Would I need the thickest make of Sisalkraft ?
—995.
Sisalkraft and similar sheets are good for
your purpose, and the cost is about the same
for all kinds. The thicker makes will keep the
rooms cooler in the summer, otherwise there is
no advantage over the thinner sheets. If you
are using wooden strips over the joins, be sure
to allow plenty of lap in the strips and sheets,
as some of these sheet materials shrink under
the influence of great heat and pull out from
the nails.
What substance is used in aniline blue-black
ink which causes the color to change from a
bright blue to a much darker shade on ex-
posure to air ? —976.
Bruised Aleppo galls (tannin) and sulphate
of iron (green copperas crushed small) are
the foundation materials of the best blue-
black inks: the addition of tannin alone, or
combined with copperas, would probably cause
an aniline blue ink to darken on exposure, but,
as this practically means making a gall ink,
there is not much gained by using an aniline
formula.
Some information about Willa Cather,
authoress ? —728.
Born Winchester, Virginia, 1876; had uni-
versity education. On the staff of a New
York newspaper, 1897-1901. Associate editor
“McClure’s Magazine,” 1906-1912. Wrote
novels from about 1900. Made her first defi-
nite American reputation with “One of Ours,”
which was the Pulitzer Prize novel for 1922.
International reputation was achieved with
“Death Comes for the Archbishop,” 1927. She
has a high place among contemporary novelists.
What were the first rules in the Royal
Academy Schools governing models, fees, etc. ?
(2) Are conditions very different to-day ?
1049.
The first Academy life classes properly
organised were those during the presidency of
Sir Joshua Reynolds. An early resolution of
the council provided that four male models of
different types should be permanently engaged,
each to receive a weekly retaining fee of five
shillings, with an additional fee of one shilling
for every night he was employed. Female
models did better. They received half a guinea
a night for sittings that lasted two or three
hours. For many years no unmarried student
under 20 was permitted to draw from the
female model, and when she was sitting no
one but an Academician or a student was ad-
mitted to the life room, unless of the rank of
royalty. A resolution passed by the Academy
council read: “That no person, the royal
family excepted, be admitted to the Academy
during the time the female model is sitting”;
which obviously was not the council s intention,
since in that case the life room would have
contained only the model and royalty. (2) Not
very. Models are paid from two to three shil-
lings per hour regardless of sex, and most life
classes are open to all serious students.
Were there several copies by the artist of the
painting “Death of General Wolfe, by Ben-
jamin West, R.A. ? If so, for what purposes
were they painted, and where did they go .
1058. , . ..
Yes, West painted five replicas and a sixth
with variations. The original was shown at
the Academy of 1771, and was bought by Lord
Grosvenor for £4OO. It remained in the pos-
session of his heirs until 1918, when it was
presented to the Dominion of Canada. West
received commissions for replicas from George
111 the Prince of Waldeck, Lord Bristol and
General Monkton, who was Wolfe’s second in
command. The sixth, which had a number
of minor alterations, went into West’s own per-
sonal collection. .
(1) What are the prospects of an architec-
tural career in Tasmania ? (2) What is the
method of learning the profession ? —879.
(1) Not bright. There is no case on record
of a Tas. architect having made enough
money out of his profession to retire before
he died. (2) There is no Uni. course and it is
almost impossible to obtain sufficient know-
ledge locally to pass the R.A.I.A. exams.,
which entitle to membership of the Austra-
lian institutes and to registration. Best course
is to get articled to a firm in Melbourne or
Sydney and attend the Uni. course in either
of those cities. If this is not possible become
articled to a Hobart or Launceston firm
with a good practice and attend the Technical
College for four years. This would qualify
for a position as draughtsman, which might
lead to a job on the mainland.
(1) Is it possible to qualify as an engineer
after attending evening courses at Sydney
Tech. Coll. ? (2) Can a candidate graduate in
any faculty at the Sydney Uni. without first
qualifying for matriculation ? (3) Compulsory
matriculation subjects for engineering ? (4)
How long should a candidate with ordinary
intelligence who has passed the junior exam,
of the Queensland Uni. take to matriculate ?
(5) When is the Sydney Uni. matriculation
exam, held ? (6) Are there evening classes in
the faculty of engineering ? —1034.
(1) Yes, but candidates must be appren-
tices and must have passed the leaving certi-
ficate examination in certain prescribed sub-
jects. (2) No. (3) English, another language,
mathematics and mechanics, all at higher, or
senior, standard. All subjects must be passed
at one sitting. (4) Two years. (5) In Feb-
ruary each year. (6). No.
If I bring my widowed aunt, over 60, born
in Australia and a resident of W.A., to N.S.W.
will she be eligible for a widow’s pension ?
768.
A widow must be resident in N.S.W. for
three years before being eligible to receive a
pension. Her husband must also have been
domiciled in N.S.W. at the time of his death.
As your aunt is over 60 she is probably
eligible to receive an old-age pension, which
is sufficient in itself to debar her from re-
ceiving a widow’s pension.
(1) Method of removing yellow-brown spots
caused by age or damp on water-color paint-
ings ? (2) What will remove rust and tea-
stains from white verandah tiles ? —993.
"(1) Not a job for the amateur. If the pic-
tures are valuable seek expert advice. (2) The
stains may yield to scrubbing with fine sand-
soap or other abrading mixture, with a little
ammonia in hot water. If they have pene-
trated the glaze try slopping with a weak
solution of peroxide of hydrogen in water and
then flooding with cold water.
What is the position regarding Britain’s
war debt to the U.S.A., and to what extent is
Australia affected ? —758.
The fevision of the debt is the subject of
negotiations between the respective Govern-
ments. Britain made “token” payments
of 10 million dollars in June, 1933, and 1\
million dollars in December, 1933. Conse-
quent on the Hoover moratorium interest
payments by Australia to Britain in respect of
war debts in 1932-33 and sinking fund pay-
ments in 1931-32 and 1932-33 were suspended.
(1) Method used by draughtsmen, etc., for
printing several copies off one plan ? (2)
Materials necessary, cost, etc. ? —920.
(1) The two simplest methods are the
“Ferro” process, which gives a blue print with
white lines, and the “Helio” process, which gives
a white print with black lines. The printing
and developing operations are the same in
both systems-. The plan is drawn on tracing
paper or tracing cloth, using black waterproof
ink (Indian ink); it is then placed in a printing
frame in contact with sensitised paper and ex-
posed to a strong light. When printed, it is
developed in water. (2) Prices of cloth, ink,
paper, frame, etc., obtainable from Harding
and Halden, 9 Barrack-street, Sydney.
Particulars concerning the 1934 International
Travel-book Competition ? —lOlO.
The competition will be conducted by George
G. Harrap and Co., London, in co-operation
with Robert Mcßride and Co., of New York,
and Lars Hokerbergs Forlag, of Stockholm.
Prize is 2500 dollars, offered as an advance of
royalties to be arranged for a book of authentic
travel, adventure or exploration in any part of
the world. The competition is open to writers
who have travelled and have something un-
usual to say about life on any part of the globe.
All the entries must be written with the general
reading public in mind. Technical scientific
works are not eligible. The winning book will
be published in England, America and Sweden.
Competition closes November 30, 1934.
In what year did the s.s. Quetta disaster
occur, and was there much loss of life ? —1096.
She struck a submerged rock and sank in
Adolphus Channel near Torres Strait on Feb-
ruary 28, 1890. Lives lost, 134; 150 survivors,
including two women.
(1) In what way does class “B” amplification
differ from class “A” in so far as the operat-
ing costs of a receiver are concerned ? (2)
Under what conditions would class “B” ampli-
fication be used ? —345.
(1) In class “B” the output valves consume
only enough current to reproduce the sound
which is momentarily being amplified, while in
class “A” the output valves continuously absorb
enough current to handle the loudest undis-
torted output, even during quiet passages in
the programme. (2) In battery-operated sets,
where the cost of the H.T. supply is an im-
portant consideration.

“Perfect” Welded 6-line Cattle
Fence, erected at Garfield, Victoria.
“PERFECT” WELDED FENCING is all one
solid piece, as the uprights are electrically
welded to the line wires. Thus they are not
weakened nor is the galvanising broken by
twisting them.
It is made from the toughest wire obtain-
able, and, as all the joints are electrically
welded, the tensile strength of the fence is
increased enormously. Tests have shown that
the wire will break before the welds are
damaged.
“Perfect” Welded Fencing is the
lowest-priced fencing on the market.
“PERFECT” WELDED SHEEP FENCING
has five line wires spaced at intervals of 6,6,
6 and 8 inches, to a height of 26 inches, and
the droppers are 12 inches apart. For Light
“P ERFE C T” WELDED FENCING,
CHANDLER’S Price is only 3/10 per chain
in 10-chain rolls, and £l4 per mile. For
Heavy “PERFECT” WELDED FENCING
(10-gauge), the price is 5/- per chain in 5-
chain rolls, and £lB per mile.
F.O.R. or F. 0.8. Melbourne.
“PERFECT” WELDED FENCING is
made in five styies and each of
these in two weights.

Milk Oh: It drags along its weary way like
a dog-tired sundowner J.W.: For poetical
purposes the moon is mostly featured as
feminine. It is probably the first time it was
ever apostrophised as “a rougish wite”
J.S.: Picture of rough lumbermen singing the
“noel” of an embryonic bread-board as they
hew down a gracious tree’s white hips sug-
gests that your Pegasus has fairly taken
the bit in his teeth... .Z.P.: You have a
pleasant touch, but your technique needs im-
proving J.S.W.: Banana ballad suffers from

There's whimsicality in it but it hardly reaches
publication standard H.J.S.: But it’s not the
first time Australian cricketers have been de-
barred feminine belongings on an English tour.

even the edifying story of the reprobate whose

It’s a pretty name, but the idea has been worn

never a glimmer of literary merit... .F.V.:
It might make a passable sentimental song,
nothing more.... M. 8.: Sloppy and a trifle
mawkish... .H.G.: Still in the dark as to
whether it is meant for prose or verse....
R.W.T.: Gondoliers, even metaphorical ones,
are a bit off our beat... .A.W.S.: After wad-
ing through your “several small poems” (16
in all) we are constrained to doubt if any pub-
lisher would be interested in them. There
is no market for undisciplined fluency....
P.C.F.: Recalls a line in “Julius Caesar,” “How
vilely doth this cynic rhyme” j.D.: A good
peg, but the jingle you hang on it is lifeless....
D.S.: Quite a good refrain; the weakness is
in the envoi... .M.S.: Interest nil; value the
same.... W.P.: Oh yes, there’s hope for any-
one at 17. Wasn’t it Cato who learned Greek
at 80? L.S.: One phrase in your poem,
“the sympathy of the sea’s symphony,”
wouldn’t make a bad test for determining the
sobriety of arrested motorists J.C.G.: Your
pastorals are on the thin side.... Elly Otter:
The jests are rather forced, and why drag in
Anaxagoras? ... .F.J.8.: Too heavily charged

That sort of verse went out of fashion with

Done Wrong to My Parents” A.C.: It’s
too full of rough, hard words and turgid lines.

fancy... .P.D.P.: A 15-line sonnet is in the

have ideas but you haven’t mastered the art

Cannot see anything funny in a man looking

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Runa”: I can throw a small gleam
on the origin of the verse reported to
T. S. Eliot, via Sydney (B. 28 /3/ ’34). I
heard it first in M.L., whence it came
from San Francisco, and it was the usual
futile parody on the latest popular hit,
in this instance “Redwing.” In any case,
Eliot has the parody, idiotic as it is, woe-
fully misquoted.
* * * *
“Bendee”: Among Emden relics men-
tioned in recent pars. (B. 21/3/’34) there
is no mention of the Mexican dollars
which seemed to be fairly plentiful
among some of the prisoners. I still
have two of these coins, well blackened
and stained, which we got “straight from
the stable” when the Fritzies were
brought aboard the Omrah at Colombo.
They told us they had got the coins from
one of the boats they captured before
they went under to the Sydney.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: An odd relic has come to
Adelaide Museum, a wash-basin used by
Napoleon “while being taken to St.
Helena on the Bellerophon.” It is a very
heavy affair, painted with a blue land-
scape after the fashion of the period, and
has come down to the Wemyss family of
S.A. through an officer of Nelson’s day.
Wm. Hay, the State’s historian-novelist,
jumps in to point out that the Bellero-
phon took Napoleon only from France
to England, but that the old frigate is
loaded with local interest because Hind-
marsh fought in her at the Nile and
Franklin at Trafalgar.
* * *
“X.N.0.”: The navy has a short way of
deciding whether a man is drunk or not (B.
4/4/’34). The alleged inebriate is brought
before the officer of the watch, whose
verdict, “drunk” or “sober,” is final.
There are no degrees of insobriety, and
the officer is guided by his opinion as to
whether or not the man could carry out
his ordinary duty satisfactorily. He may,
and sometimes does in borderline cases,
require the accused to perform some part
of his duty. I never forget the weird
noises a bandsman once produced from
a violin when I decided to apply this
test. The officers were at dinner at the
time and the Commander himself came
on deck to find out who was strangling
the cat and why.
«{t 4* '!'
“Hopper”: One of the Sydney papers
recently referred to a pair of swans nest-
ing in Centennial Park as “cock” and
“hen” birds. Reference to “The Order,
Lawes and Ancient Customes of the
Swannes, caused to be printed by John
Witherings, Esquire, Master and Gover-
nour of the Royal Game of Swannes and
Cygnets throughout England,” will show
what a frightful solecism the journal has
committed. The gentleman swan should
be entitled a “cob” and his lady a “pen.”
* -‘I: +• t-
“Felis”: Cat stories are as the sands
of the sea, but this one is a newie to
me. A rubbish worker at Mortlake—
where the Oxford-Cambridge boatrace
finishes —was spading refuse into the in-
cinerator when he found a cat, evidently
alive, but in a rocky condition, on his
shovel. Kitty was rushed to the local
R.S.P.C.A. and vetted. Finally, after
going through a lot of treatment, the
cat was reconditioned and returned to
normal life —as cats know it. To get as
far as that worker’s shovel puss must
have gone into a dustbin and then been
transferred to a dustcart. At the de-
structor it would go down a chute and
on to a moving platform which forced
it through an aperture which flattens tin-
cans of any size. Then it would be shot
down again to a revolving screen which
takes ashes and dust out of the other
rubbish, and then passed on to the
“sifters,” which classify the rubbish in
“sizes.” Most of the proverbial nine
lives must have been drawn on during
that journey of tribulation.
* * * *
“Nolo”: These are hair-splitting days
when the meaning of the simplest phrase
that tongue can frame is quite likely to
be strenuously argued about. When the
late Calvin Coolidge announced that he
“did not choose” to be a candidate for
a third term at the White House it might
have been thought the matter was ended.
But it wasn’t; for weeks the U.S. news-
papers went on speculating about the
precise shade of significance to be at-
tached to the word “choose” and
whether the retiring President hadn’t left
himself a loophole in case his party
should insist on having him. Similarly,
to compare small things with great, when
Douglas Jardine said he had “no inten-
tion and no desire” to lead England
against Australia on the cricket field this
season, it didn’t look as if there was
anything more to be said or written on
the vexed subject. But English papers
are still busy discussing whether Jardine
wouldn’t play if he were wanted, along
with various other side issues, although his
disclaimer, like Coolidge’s, could hardly
have been put in barer commonplace.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
If all the women in all the ages had
stayed at home and followed Kingsley’s
maxim, “be good, sweet maid, and let
who will be clever,” what would we have
done for our pageants? Certainly they
wouldn’t have been so colorful and
fascinating as that staged by the girls of
Hopewood House on Saturday. For in-
stance, there would have been no
Boadicea to come out in armor, battle-
axe in hand, to incite her warriors to
victory. Did Elizabeth sit on her throne
and wear her crown all day? Not she.
So we saw her in plumed hat and spread-
ing wine taffetas addressing her men
before they met the Armada.
It was an illustrious company from
many lands. Among them Vashti (the
queen who lost her crown because she
refused to come and show off her beauty
and rich raiment to her husband’s
guests), Jephthah’s daughter and Joan of
Arc, all glittering armor and plumed hat.
Helen of Troy was there ; also Cleopatra,
the latter carried on a litter by two
Nubian slaves. Jane Austen in high-
waisted frock and sash, and (of course)
the blue stockings, and Amy Johnson,
who literally flew from home. Our own
Nellie Melba, as Marguerite, gave Joan
Hammond’s voice a chance to soar in
the “Jewel Song.”
Afterwards on the wide balcony such
notables as Mrs. Pankhurst, Mrs. Sid-
dons, Catherine of Muscovy and the
dowager Empress of China handed
round savories and cups of coffee and
tea, and principal Miss Jobson, in grey
chiffons and with a sheaf of dahlias in
her arms, listened to speeches compli-
menting the girls’ presentation and the
beauty of the school’s surroundings.
Fourteen white-clad debs, “came out”
in all the rain of Wednesday at the Uni.
Settlement Ball. Their presentation to
the Governor and Lady Game took place
in the Great Hall to organ accompani-
ment. Then came the rush—dresses held
high—across the planks on the quad-
rangle greens to the Union for the
dancing.
But spirits weren’t damp, if shoes were,
and the ball ran its merry course. What
matter if clouds got blacker and blacker?
Everybody knew there was a silver lin-
ing somewhere —the lapels of Lady
Game’s black romaine coat were visible
proof of it.
Chancellor Cullen brought daughter
Ailsa in marigold chiffons ; and Miss I.
Fidler brightened up the landscape and
her own black velvets in particular with
touches of silver lame. The Premier
Stevens couple had a place on the dais,
as did the Mayoral Parkers, Brigadier-
General Ivan Mackay, Mrs. Mackay, who
wrapped herself in floral chiffons ; Uni.
Registrar and Mrs. Selle, she in black
needle-run laces ; Elise Budge and Anne
Gordon, the one in orange organdie, the
other in summer-sky-blue crepes. Flowers
of many hues rioted over Mrs. J. C.
Windeyer’s pale-gold chiffons.
Why are civic fathers not expected to
know anything about art? At the open-
ing of the Water Colorists’ exhibition at
the Education Gallery, people sat up and
looked surprised when Lud Mayor
Parker told them a lot most of them
didn’t know before of the formation of
the English society, and such names as
Turner, Copley and Fielding came trip-
pingly off his tongue.
Mrs. B. E. Minns came early and had
a chair placed in front of her husband’s
panel, where she could admire in particu-
lar “Three Men in a Boat” and “White
Gate.” With her came kinswoman Mrs.
Murray Johnson, of Griffith, in brown,
and Mrs. Alan Russell (Melbourne) in
grey-flecked Angora, a hat of the same
material and two wondrous Arctic foxes.
Maud Sherwood wore her favorite shade
of blue. Vida Lahey, down from Bris-
bane, read with pleasure that the
National Gallery had looked on her
“Chinese Jar” and found it good. It is
blue and filled with crocuses, and a
shallow yellow dish completes the com-
position. Mrs. Godson, artist John s wife,
brought their six-months-old baby. The
Ludowici couple got in before the crush.
With her vivid green costume, Mrs.
Ludowici wore a green hat. Helen
Souter, all brown to match her eyes,
greeted friends right and left. Mrs.
Jarret was discovered looking at Dora’s
“Madame la Marquise.” And Albert
Collins and H. W. Grace could be found
anywhere but near the work of their
hands.
Sales have been good. Among the
buyers was the Lud Mayor, who slipped
in quietly the day after the opening and
bought Francis Sherwood’s “Seventeen”
and Donald Friend’s portrait of Prince
Molungoo Whennai. The Prince paid a
visit to the gallery, but not in all the
glory of his native dress. He wore an
ordinary grey lounge suit, permitting
himself, however, a necklace of shark’s
teeth.
Just relations and a few intimate
friends witnessed Jean Brodziak’s wed-
ding to Sidney E. Baume. This took
place at the Great Synagogue, Rabbi
Cohen tying the knot. The graceful
bride carried a sheaf of brown orchids,
and wore ankle-length parchment crepes
and small brown hat for her big moment.
Jean is the only daughter of the A. A.
Brodziaks, of Potts Point; Sidney, the
third son of Maoriland K.C. F. E.
Baume.
Here is a Dorothy Welding study of
Mrs. W. T. Randle Ford, wife of Rear-
Admiral Ford, who to-morrow will take
over the command of the Royal Aus-
tralian Naval Squadron. Mrs. Ford is
thrilled with the thought of a two-years’
stay in Sydney—as any woman might be
who has had eight homes in five years.
At the moment she is busy looking for
a suitable house and a school for
small son John (David is only three).
The youngsters had a great time on the
Anchises, and John was fascinated with
the word Woolloomooloo, and didn’t rest
until he could spell it. Music, the
drama, boating and surfing are among
Mrs. Ford’s interests.
Elsa Corry had the bumper house the
committee had worked for. It was
like fighting your way into a Mc-
Cormack concert. Trams from each
direction went on their way empty
after the Town Hall stop was reached ;
richly upholstered motor-cars disgorged
their even more richly upholstered
owners, and taxi-cabs their hirers.
Everybody came, girls and boys, old and
young, men and women. There wasn’t
a vacant seat in the house.
The State Exes, brought the big party
that had supped with them beforehand.
The Junior Red Crossers rolled up in
force, with their mothers and their aunts.
They had taken the responsibility of fill-
ing one of the galleries. The Mayoral
Lud and his lady, Billy Hughes and his
Dame Mary, Mrs. Spencer Brunton, pre-
sident of the committee ; Dr. Ziele, who
discovered the voice ; Mrs. C. E. Jones,
the soldier’s widow who designed, made
and gave Elsa her frock, and Dr. God-
sall, who looked after Miss Corry’s
throat, were also in evidence. The only
trouble was that the Town Hall isn’t
built on the lines of a Revelation trunk.
It resulted in many being turned away
who wanted to do their bit for the Dig-
ger’s daughter. Elsa looked lovely in her
magnolia-satin frock, with its sweeping
train, her hair taken right back from her
face and coroneted with a twist of pearls.
She has the fair complexion which is
usually associated with the English girl
—but she can thank Bowral for it. She
is tall, and appears to have the physique
that will stand the hard work to which
she has pledged herself.
She sang beautifully, just as beautifully
in English as she did in French, Russian
and German, and after “Vissi d’Arte”
from “Tosca” Sir Philip Game went up
to the platform and shook her hand in
congratulation. His Ex. has quite a good
dramatic sense. In the interval the Brad-
don knight (chairman of the concert
committee) thanked everybody who had
helped, not only with the concert,
but all through Miss Corry’s musical
education —especially the Repat. Depart-
ment and Miss Ladd, her teacher.
Flowers there were in profusion, in
baskets, in sheaves, in posies. All Miss
Corry’s fellow-pupils came laden with
them. Muriel Edsall was the accom-
panist ; Trixie Tange’s red-gold head
gleamed above green chiffons and silver
lame as she added a Liszt “Hungarian
Rhapsody” to the music of the night,
and Osric Fyfe’s ’cello was also heard.
St. Mark’s, Darling Point, saw the
knot-tying of Beatrice White and Claude
Gilchrist Donkin. The bride’s white
satins gleamed through the long hoar-
frostlike tulle veil that fell from a high
coronet of filigree silver, but there was
a hint of spring in the green-and-white
lily-of-the-valley which she carried.
Wendy White, Joy White and Barbara
Donkin ’maided, a shoulder-strap of red
rose-petals holding up their ice-blue
crepes, backless but trained. Red roses
fresh from the garden banded the backs
of their heads, and the same fragrant
blooms filled their arms. Mrs. White later
welcomed 180 guests at the Rose Bay
golf club, where her choice of black
chiffon velvets was highly commended.
Margaret Dreyer’s recital at the Con.
promises to be something out of the
ordinary. The singer is already well
known to the radio audience, and her
coloratura soprano will be heard at its
best on Thursday, April 26, in such
things as the mad scene from “Lucia,”
“Depuis le Jour ” from “Louise,” and
the polonaise from “Mignon.” Also on
the programme are songs by Duparc,
Delius and Bantock.
Dorothea Lloyd, eldest daughter of the
late Dr. Sanderson Lloyd, of Hunter’s
Hill, and Mrs. Sanderson Lloyd, of Rose
Bay, has announced her engagement to
Commander Garsia, Administrator of
Nauru, formerly of the R.A.N. The
marriage will take place shortly at Moss
Vale.
Letters and congratulatory messages
from all over Australia are pouring in
on Redlands, the girls’ school founded
50 years ago by Elizabeth Liggins and
Clara Arnold at Fitzroy-street, North
Sydney. This is their jubilee year, and
the celebrations opened with a dinner on
Saturday. To the first secretary of the
Old Girls’ Union, Mary McAllister, fell
the honor of blowing out the fifty candles
that adorned the three-tier cake. This
was watched in silence by the girls, but
as the last flicker died away there was a
general uprising, clapping of hands and
the singing of old favorites.
Present principal, Miss Roseby, wel-
comed the guests, among whom were
many of the heads of other girls’ schools
in Sydney. A guest who entered en-
thusiastically into all the goings-on was
Miss H. Dumolo, one of Redlands’s first
pupils. To come are a special anniver-
sary day at the school on July 10 and a
fete in October.
This is Dunedin (M.L.) singing girl
Helen Roy, who came for a holiday to
Sydney and then decided' she’d stay a
while to see how we did things. She has
sung with the Dunedin Symphony
Orchestra and with the Male Choir, and
has already made a name for herself as
an over-the-air artist in her own land.
To-night her friends can listen-in and
hear her from 2BL. At the moment, De
Giorgio is putting some extra polish on
the mezzo voice, that so far owes its
training to John Leach.
All Sydney’s brightest young things
motored out to Yaralla, Dame Eadith
Walker’s home, to her farewell party for
English girl Elizabeth Stephen. Dame
Eadith was in night-sky-blue laces
splashed with silver; Elizabeth stood by
in tender green organdies, and Mrs. de
la Salle (Elizabeth’s aunt) covered her
ivory laces with a brocaded coat. The
reception-rooms were filled with blooms
from the famous gardens, and the mar-
quee on the lawn wore pink roses that
formed a canopy through which the
lights glowed on young faces, sparkling
eyes and dancing feet.
According to taxi-men, the American
tourist is interested in two things—
native-bears and opals. Now they’ll want
to go to the Technological Museum to
look at and covet the collection of opals
that Percy Marks has given to the State.
The giving and taking took place last
week, and Education Minister Drum-
mond left, a Cabinet meeting to say
“Thank you.” When Australia’s flag was
whisked off and the electrics switched on,
the stones glowed and sparkled and
made one forget the museum and Harris-
street.
There are about 75 specimens, each
perched on a mother-of-pearl stand, and
it is hard to say which called forth the
most admiration. Some glowed like the
heart of a fire on a frosty night. Others
flashed. In one—a long oblong stone—
could be seen the outline of two sailing-
boats. The big black opal (about 3in. by
2in.), which is not black but has green
and blue tints, graduating in density like
the harbor, attracted masculine eyes, one
man (a Maorilander) saying it had all
the hues of greenstone. After laudatory
adjectives had been exhausted, afternoon-
tea was served in the hall across the
courtyard. Then good-byes were said,
and Curator A. R. Penfold was left to
gloat over his latest acquisition.

Sumptuous were the decorations for
the marriage of Joan Syme and John
Hayne. The marquee which spread its
expansive area over the wedding tea at
Blythswood was no ordinary unadorned
canvas. Shoals of streamers, white and
ciel-blue (to match the bridesmaids),
camouflaged its utility walls and ceiling.
Every table was clothed with silver lame,
upon which mother-of-pearl shrubs spat-
tered with berries grew in blue jars. The
bride’s table carried silver bowls of fruit
in lieu of flowers, an old silver witch-
ball and a candelabra. Vows were ex-
changed at Holy Trinity Church, Kew.
Following the all-white bride were three
small girls with long hair: Veronica
Syme, Jacqueline Haggard and Pat
Gutteridge. There were four ’maids:
Felicity, Nancy and Theo Syme and
Audrey Poolman. Their old-world gowns
were snowdrifts of white ninon slipping
off the shoulders into fichus and sashed
with blue to repeat the note of slippers
and ribbons round their hair. That even-
ing, ’maids, ushers and a number of
guests found their way to dance in the
packed New Embassy.
A Hordern has married a Baillieu,
thus forming a union between two of
Australia’s wealthiest families. An enor-
mous crowd seethed round St. John’s,
Toorak, satisfied to wait for hours with
sandwiches and knitting for the brief
reward of a radiant smile or a glimpse
of tulle. Here is the bride—June,
younger daughter of the Clive Baillieus—
pictured by Ronald Esler. Her bride-
groom was Sam, son of knight Samuel
Hordern, of Sydney, and his lady. The
wedding attire was a marvellous creation
of gold lame washed over with parch-
ment chiffon, an armful of lilies and a
tulle veil attached to a fluted halo.
Small Angela Keppel-Palmer divided her
interest between her own flufiiness and
five yards of bridal train. Preceding the
bride to the altar in single file were half
a dozen handsome ’maids. Mary Bail-
lieu, Patricia Hammond, Margaret Fin-
lay, Sandra Shackell, from N.S.W., Jean
Anderson and Pamela Osborne. For
their gowns dryad-brown net piled over
ciel-blue swept backwards into a “ship-
in-a-fair-wind” effect. Their suede gloves
were long and brown to match vanity-
bags upon which were pinned sprays of
languorous orchids. The feasting was in
a marquee on the spacious lawns of
Kamillaroi.
Every year one comes away from the
Garden Week exhibition filled with lofty
ideals for one’s own garden, even if it be
but a pocket-handkerchief plot. Among
the finest specimens at this year’s show-
ing were shrubs and trees, oaks with
vivid autumn reds shot upon green, elms,
golden and Japanese maples, yew-trees
and Colorado spruce. Noticeable were
the large gold leaves of a lusty young
tulip-tree—it must reach its fifteenth
birthday before it blooms. Like a grey
mist were the wormwoods, pleasingly
aromatic when squeezed between the
fingers. Piping green were the junipers,
the tender fishbone ferns and the weird
Australian native crotallaria or bird-
flower. In a rockery were vivid blue
trumpets of gentian which showed no
sign of homesickness for their native
mountains and yodelling peasants.
Begonias and roses were beautiful,
dahlias huge and gorgeous. Among the
desert plants were all manner of prickly
creatures from tiny marbles to old-men
cacti supporting fifteen feet of fierce
spikes. Every day crocodiles of school-
children were marshalled round the ex-
hibits, making notes with pencils tied to
prepared pads. One small boy broke his
pencil and went through agonies trying
to remember all he heard, until he had
chewed down the stump to a morsel of
protruding lead.
Albert-street Con. had a come-together
evening for its past and present students.
Fred Collier and his wife (Elsa Treweek
on the concert platform) were whisked
up through the building filled with mem-
ories of their student days. A span in
the years was daughter Elva, tall and
like her mother, in violet lace. Mrs.
Collier was stately in black and a
shimmer of sequins. Speeches aren’t a
habit of Fred Collier’s —his few words
were forthcoming only after “Come
along, Fred,” from Harold Elvins and
Mrs. Fritz Hart, and a dig in the ribs
from his daughter. Mary Campbell has
a genius for remembering students of
decades ago, and did so graciously in
chocolate lace and a white fox. Jessica
Pennell and Vera Crellin were busy
people. Mrs. Hart was in marl-grey—
her Fritz is still in Honolulu. There was
bridge, for which Minnie Everett won
a pink-and-blue bowl, and dancing in
the gallery under the slit eyes of deco-
rative Japanese figures and the topaz orbs
of a huge lion chasing Mickey Mouse.
Interspersed were gems of music upon
Ida Scott’s accompaniment, from the
voices of Louie Hilburn, Dorothea Boddy
and Beatrice Oakley, and the violin of
Coral Trenerry. The supple fingers of
Ada Summers raced over the keyboard.
Marshall Sumner was there, also Jean
Hamilton, in a handsome dress of gold
lam£, and Helene Jacoby, in white moire.
An object of the International Club
is to entertain foreigners visiting this
country and to provide the opportunity
for club members to meet and exchange
ideas with people of other nationalities.
Mrs. Percy Grainger is Swedish, and is
more interesting for her own charm and
intelligence than as a personality bask-
ing in the reflected glory of a famous
husband. At the club’s reception for the
Graingers Mrs. Herbert Brookes and
knight Harrison Moore, after the win-
dows had been closed, competed suc-
cessfully with the hammering in an ad-
jacent building and gave speeches of
welcome. Mrs. Grainger, whose quaint
fringe and plaits on the nape of her
neck suit her beautifully, replied with a
captivating accent. Her husband’s ac-
knowledgment expanded into a lecture —
a highly technical one for a non-musical
gathering. Guests included the Swedish
Consul, Henning Helin, the Norwegian
Consul and Mrs. Sverre Lie, who was
snugly wrapped in a coat over her ripple-
striped dress, and Prof, and Mrs. Lode-
wyckx, she in swamp-green. The Prof,
took the opportunity of delivering to
Miss Clauscen (who that afternoon repre-
sented the Danish Consulate) a message
from her brother in Iceland, whom he
met last year in that far-away country.
In the throng were Mrs. Robert McDon-
ald, Mrs. Arthur Norman, whose silver
fox had a white tip to his tail, and Mrs.
Graf, severely smart in a tailored suit
and a feather over one eye.
There’s a boom in building which may
result after the centenary in a glut. For
the bricks and mortar being so hastily
slapped together are rabbit-warren addi-
tions to guest-houses mostly in St. Kilda-
road. The latest news is that the Chev-
ron goes under the pick. On the site of
its ruins will rise a hotel replete with
lifts, extensive suites, a swimming pool,
fountains and flagged pathways. There’s
barely six months left, so its workers
will have to move faster than the men
employed on the Shrine.
Blondes, brunettes, brindles and red-
heads jumped breakfastless on suburban
trams to wait patiently in a queue for
hours outside the new Metro Theatre.
The ad. that caused the rush specified
that applicants must be brunettes;
young, attractive and well-educated. One
white-headed woman explained that some
years ago she’d been a dark beauty.
Some girls wore wigs, others declared
themselves willing to dye their hair any
required shade.
Mary Sharp will doubtless have a
grand farewell when she sails in the
Oronsay for Egypt. She’ll be married
on a Sunday, the day after her arrival
in Cairo, to Ragnar Lundquist at the
Swedish Embassy. The honeymooners
proceed first to Mena House and then
by ’plane to Jerusalem and a tour
through Palestine. They will live in
a flat on the Nile island of Gezireh.
Mary blithely talks about mastering
French, German, Swedish and Arabic as
quickly as possible, for most of her hus-
band’s friends are foreigners. Her extra
share of self-confidence developed during
her Y.A.L. work. She was keen on
organising, and while still in her teens
lectured in schools upon the value of
the Y.A.L., and travelled to the other
States as chaperon for a batch of
youngsters.
The newest arrivals at animal meeting-
pools along motor roads on Sundays and
upon the steps of buildings in town dur-
ing the week are cut with a knife from
springy twiglike red-brown ferns. But
the weird little beasts made from gum-
nuts and banksia cones have little to
fear from the new life-size monsters. The
nut family has hopped on its spindle
shanks and pecked its way securely into
our hearts and purses. Overseas visitors
are taking koala bags back to their
friends at home. The furry toys hold the
bare necessities of make-up, so the
flapper who has one to cuddle up to this
winter will have to give up carrying her
love letters and theatre programmes
around (especially during the ’flu
months, when half a dozen hankies are
needed).
Kingsley Fairbridge died all too young,
but the seed of his labors was planted
in fertile ground. Fairbridge Farm
School in Westralia perpetuates his
memory. Here you have Katherine
Ross-Hume, who shepherded out to
Fairbridge its last batch of 37 young-
sters. She is Scottish and cherishes the
photograph of a lovely old house in
Berwickshire, her family’s home and hers
when she’s not travelling. Even as a
young girl she was interested in Imperial
development, so she trained as a teacher
and studied domestic science. She visited
Australia and Canada, and, in order to
learn about local conditions, took posi-
tions now in wealthy station homes, now
in the shacks of struggling settlers. Miss
Ross-Hume numbers among the happiest
years of her life those spent on the
Riverina and in Vic. She also enjoyed
the experience of an overland trip to
Darwin. Photo, by Broothorn.
Perth’s gaieties and social occasions:
Undergrads, started the “shop’s” twenty-
first birthday revels with a street procession,
heralding its approach with a beanstalk growth
of sputtering torches. Monster nets caught
grotesque creatures in the “Mosquito Week
Campaign”; young gentlemen in shirts, all the
colors of the rainbow —some just had scanty
nightshirts—acclaimed political sentiments; the
“Botteries Commission” was introduced as
“The Gold Diggers of 1934”; “Devil-Era”
spouted flames from a cauldron, and an army
of nurses refreshed the “Baby Week” exhibit.
After a riotous conferring of degrees, when
cloaked and hooded savants were basely
maligned, Winthrop Hall echoed to the strains
of dance music. Chancellor James was there
with his lady; Vice-Chancellor Prof. Whitfeld
and Pro-Chancellor Dr. Battye had their better-
halves m tow; Dr. Roberta Jull’s black lace
and brocade occupied an official pew; Prof.
Shann’s attractive wife disported a floral de-
sign on Egyptian-blue ninons; Mrs. Fraenkel
was sheathed in ebony lace and georgette;
Mrs. Harry Thompson’s laces were moonlight
blue; Mrs. E. de Courcey Clarke mingled
pomegranate crepes with silver lame; Margaret
Leckie’s tartans were taffeta; Marjorie Shann’s
satins glowed deep blue; sister Betty’s drift of
snow was flecked with silver, and “Ike” Broad-
foot’s black taffetas were adorned with green
and flame velvet.
Florence Austral’s filmy black ninon hand-
kerchief wafted under glittering diamond brace-
lets when she made her bow to the first-
night audience at His Majesty’s. Turquoise
embroideries outlined the mushroom front of
her black chiffons, wandered panelwise down
the sides and finished in posies of pink roses
on the trained skirt. The C. L. Masons were
front-rankers, the Frank Devies were there
also the Arthur Jacobys, Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Vowels, Pearlie Lovekin, Kitty Gillies, Mrs
Fred Heron, Mrs. Ralph Crisp and, of course
Mrs. W. H. Vincent. Karrakatta Club mem-
bers gave a pre-concert tea in their flower-
decked ballroom to welcome the singer and
her flautist husband John Amadio, the diva
coming along in softest dawn-pink crepe, with
oatmeal fur edging the flowing cape.
A stiff breeze blew over South Perth grounds
for the polo gymkhana, but the spate of rain
in the morning had laid low the dust. After
Perth had made use of its conceded goals in
the match against Irwin the Readhead family
made a welter of the fancy races. Mrs.
Harold Readhead’s blue shirt hung over the
barrel while popping in the winning flag;
Charlie Readhead sat triumphantly on the
final musical chair; and Harold was in at the
death in the vegetable race. President Langlois
Lefroy’s lady, in enviable black matelasse,
handed over the prizes.
Ken Hosking and Esme Higgins embarked
on a matrimonial cruise at Guildford Grammar
School chapel with padre Jock Bell at the
helm. Creamy georgettes hung from a deep
cowl at the neck down to the ankles, and
were clasped at the waist with a wide, tight
belt. A large pink ballibuntal hat shaded the
boat-shaped arrangement of rosebuds, which
ran to lengths of satin ribbons. Joan Stowe
and Gertie Hosking stepped in the bride’s
wake swinging slit cowl sleeves of blush-pink
mariette, caught on the shoulder with velvet
roses. Their sheaves of pink dahlias matched
the flowers on their honey-straw headpieces.
King’s Park Tennis Club wound up the
tournament with a dance in its brick-lined
pavilion, where racquet-wielders practised their
footwork to an orchestral accompaniment.
Peter Smith gyrated in sea-green crinkled
organdies; Margot Law’s taffetas were pat-
terned in a plaid of dark blue and gold; Zoe
Weir enhanced platinum hair with black ring
velvet; Norma Rolland feather-edged her orchid
georgettes; Dorothy Temperley’s white crinkle
crepes glittered with sequins, and Pat Leake
wound a length of white satin round her lissom
lines.
Judy James ran the gamut of bride-elect
parties with breath-taking rapidity. Beth John-
ston and Mrs. Butcher shook rounds of cock-
tails; Mary Le Farm brewed tea at Bishop’s
House; Kath Castieau rallied troops at the
Esplanade; Mrs. Gordon James sat at one end
of a long luncheon table at the Palace; Mar-
garet Officer handed round teacups at her
home, and a combined feminine dinner was
given at the Esplanade.
Tassie’s budget:
His Ex. and Lady Clark are back in Hobart
after a tour which made the Governor
acquainted with many parts of the interior.
Brighton Jockey Club held its autumn meet-
ing at Elwick in perfect weather. Summer de-
cided to come back for the occasion, and women
rushed to get one more wear out of their
warm-season clothes. President John Swan
and his two pretty daughters were to the fore,
the girls in blue wool crepe and brown and
beige striped silk respectively. Mrs. Neville
Pringle was there with her two girls, Margaret
and Betty. It was very much a young people’s
day, all the season’s debs, and numbers of
other youngsters showing up. In the throng
were Mrs. Douglas Jones and Mrs. Gordon
Blew, Mrs. R. Gunn, the two Clive girls, Mrs.
C. Kennedy and daughter Naomi, Col. and
Mrs. D. P. Young, the St. Hills, the C. P.
Harveys, Major and Mrs. Strutt, Dr. and Mrs.
Ratten, the Russell Ibbotts, the Leslie Gibsons,
Mrs. Alan Crisp, the Guesdon girls Nancy
and Noelle, Dr. Shugg, Betty Ross-Reynolds,
Pat Butler, Mrs. P. Coverdale and daughter
Doris.
The Deloraine Cup was run in lovely weather.
Motors ran up from the south and down from
Launceston, and tailored suits and small, smart
hats were favored by feminine racegoers.
The Midland Hunt Club held its opening
meet at St. Mary’s. The Eric Ransoms, of
Killymoon, gave lunch to the crowd, and a
splendid run was recorded. Many of the riders,
among them Mrs. Arthur Bennett, Barbara
Bennett and Kathleen Mercer, had ridden at
the St. Mary’s Show the day before.
Cynthia Cameron, before leaving for Lon-
don was farewelled by girl friends at the
Oldreys’ lovely old home Rokeby, in the Mid-
lands. Madge Finlay, bound for an adven-
turous voyage of another kind —she’s to be
married this month —shared in the honors.
Mollie Mackinnon was chief organiser of the
party.
Tennis and croquet tournaments at Campbell
Town wound up with a dance at Powell’s Hall,
where Mrs. Seddon was chief hostess.
Nora, the eldest of the Douglas Shoobricge
girls, Glenora, and W. A. Lawrie, Walkerville
(S.A.), have announced their engagement.
Adelaide’s quota:
The Sidney Reids, who are off for a holiday
in England with their daughters Joan and
Esme, gave their second girl her deb. dance at
their home, South-terrace, just before their de-
parture. Dahlias and zinnias made splashes
of color throughout the house, and about 150
guests were entertained. Two buds who came
out at the same dance were Yvonne Edwards
and Elspeth Rutherford. Esme was flocked in
delphinium moire silk, but the orthodox white
was worn by Misses Edwards and Rutherford.
Sidney Kidman and his lady, grandparents of
Miss Reid, were there. Mrs. Sidney Reid
looked well in a frock of lime-green lace. The
Kidman lady’s silvery-grey lace was cut with
a coatee effect. Mrs. Sidney Ayers, of Clare,
was wearing black ring velvet.
Lady Hore-Ruthven was present at the
American tea and tennis party at Girton
School, when mothers and pupils competed in
sport. The Governor’s wife wore beige crepe
with a cape effect, a brown hat and brown fox
fur. Little John Ikin and Vivienne Dumas pre-
sented her with a bouquet. She was received
by the headmistress, Miss Edith Bishop, and
other officers of the school.
Mrs. A. M. Cudmore will return to Adel-
aide in the Maloja, the ship that will bring
Lord Huntingfield to Australia. She has been
several months in England on a visit to her
daughter, Mrs. Rafe Cavenaugh-Mainwaring,
and other relatives.
Mrs. Russell Clarke, of Melbourne, who is
in Adelaide for the marriage of her son to
Alison Milne, has been guest of honor at
several parties. Mrs. R. M. Milne, Mount
Lofty, gave a luncheon at the Queen Adelaide
Club in her honor. The wedding passed off
with much eclat at St. Peter’s, Glenelg. Golden-
yellow dahlias and marigolds formed an attrac-
tive background for a white bridal party. The
bride, Alison, eldest daughter of Mrs. Clive
Milne, of Somerton, wore a gown of white
moire cut on slim lines with a fishtail train.
Her Honiton lace veil (lent by the bridegroom’s
mother) was worn over tulle and held in place
by a gold tissue coronet. Bridesmaids were the
bride’s sisters Margot and Betty, the bride-
groom’s sister Marjorie and Betty Magarey,
frocked alike in white chiffon embroidered m
silver. Their white hats had tulle brims and
they carried loose bunches of white roses tied
with silver ribbon. The little flower-girl, Carol
Wills, wore a white chiffon frock to the ankles
and a white cap, and she carried a posy of
white rosebuds.
The Tattersall’s Club meeting at Morphett-
ville was afflicted with wintry weather. After-
noon-tea, over which the chairman, H. Allan
Morris, and his wife presided, was a welcome
interlude. Mrs. Morris wore a smart brown
tailored coat over a brown marocain frock, a
brown dyed squirrel fur and hat in the same
tone. The Premier’s pretty wife chose a black-
and-white check suit and a black felt hat.
Tailored suits and fur coats prevailed, and the
small felt hat was as popular as ever.
The Flower Festival, arranged as a farewell
to Lady Hore-Ruthven, whose love of flowers
is well known, was held in the Exhibition
Building, and proved a huge success. Mr.
F. D. Kendall, secretary of the show com-
mittee, and Mrs. Frank Harcus carried out the
decorative scheme. The platform was massed
with blooms, and a miniature flower garden
was laid out. The floral exhibits were beauti-
ful, the dahlias being exceptionally fine.

THE HYMN OF HATE.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
ABOUT the beginning of 1838
Andrew Borrodaile got his ticket
of leave, and went out be-
yond the Nineteen Counties to seek
his fortune. He travelled northward by
way of the mountain pass above the head
of Page’s River—near Murrundi—and
descended to the Liverpool Plains.
A remarkable man was this late
prisoner of the Crown. A born criminal,
who was also something of a poet and
an artist. He had been transported]
for life for attempted murder of
an elderly gentleman residing-at Har-
row Weald who had chanced to
awaken whilst Andrew was in his bed-
room. The butler and a footman were
just in time to save his life. So “Number
2001, . Andrew Borrodaile, per 1 , ship
Admiral Codrington,” landed in Sydney
in 1830, where he was immediately set
to hard labor on one of Major Mitchell’s
roads in the interior of New South
Wales.
It was on the Great Northern Road,
beyond Wiseman’s Ferry, that he first
came into contact with Red Ben Bailey.
Here is one of the eight verses he
dedicated to the Superintendent after but
a brief acquaintance:
If that I should- die to-night,
And lie beside the Road —•
’Twould but be , sweet, Life to me
So to escape the Goad.
If that I should die to-night,'
And ’waken hot in Hell —
’Twould but be to find me Free,
And so to deem it Well.
But be it thus. ,or otherwise—
r We’ll Sometime meet in Hell.
That is the first stanza of the hymn of
hate that Borrodaile made and com-
mitted to memory one night on the Wol-
lombi Range as he, lay chained in the
foul hut that sheltered him and eleven
others. This was the last:
' Now cursed be the living God,
And curses on this Earth !
But cursed long and cursed Strong
Be She who gave thee Birth !
Now cursed be. the living God,
Who made such Men as thee !
But I will wait; and I will hate,
Until that I be Free—
And then, before the living God,
You’ll pay your Score to Me.
The top of the Liverpool Range above
Murrundi was named, in this part of
New South Wales, as the limit to
which the Government could extend
the protection of the law; but in
’26 Henry Baldwin, of Wilberforce
and Patrick’s Plains, crossed over it
with his teams, • and by the end of
1831 sparse and thin settlement had
pushed northward, along the rivers and
creeks that drain the valleys of the Namoi
basin, to the edge-of the New England
tableland. It was out into these regions
that Andrew Borrodaile migrated,. with
little but his criminal ability to assist
him, in 1838.’ /
For some years he worked as a stock-
man. It . used :to be rumored that he
had some share in the massacre of blacks
at Myall Creek for which seven men
were hanged in. Sydney in ’39 ; but this
was possibly mere malice, attendant upon
his very remarkable success as a pioneer
pastoralist. < At any rate, he was not
brought to trial for it, and managed to
thrive and prosper in a fashion that
seems amazing to-day. More than one
great estate was founded about that time
by gentlemen who had experienced ex-
treme good fortune in escaping from the
hangman. At least two names of such
the ancestors ■of families that nowadays
rank amongst the Very Nicest—occur to
the writer in this connection. However,
Andrew left no family but a half-caste
one, which, as everybody knows, can
never become Nice —even in three
generations. - ' < ' „
There is not space. here to chronicle
the various steps in Andrew’s , ascent •to
prosperity. We must take him as we
find him on a summer evening towards
the end of 1846, sitting : smoking in a
“squatter’s”- chair outside his somewhat
primitive domicile —slabs and sheets of
bark —upon his own rich and extensive
squattage of Harrow Weald, whereon
were depastured some 2000 head of
mixed cattle, variously come by (mostly
on moonlight nights), but representing
a not inconsiderable amount of worldly
prosperity. It is pleasant to note the
poetic sentiment that guided him in the
selection of a name for his run. He was
grateful to the old gentleman who had
been the means of getting him there.
The station, buildings consisted of three
slab edifices —one for its owner, one for
his men, and one for use as a store.
Though not identical in size, they were
altogether so in architecture and con-
struction. Slab walls and stringy-bark
roofs held down by saplings were the
principal features of each of them,
though Andrew’s own house differed a
little from the others in the possession
of a verandah in front and a skillion at
the rear. The scrub at the back and the
creek across the flat represented the
sanitary conveniences of the establish-
ment. A quarter of a mile to the right
was a blacks’ camp ; a hundred yards to
the left was a slaughteryard with its tall
gallows,' on which hung a skinned beast
that you ; may depend was not Andrew’s
—or, rather, had never worn the A.B.
brand. Down on - the flat stood a substan-
tial stockyard. Beyond it lay the line of
she-oaks marking Micky’s Creek, and
beyond them loomed the dark purple
hump of Harrow Mountain. That was
the Harrow Weald head station in 1846
—primitive and prosperous, and not over-
much trammelled in its working by law.
As for its owner at this time, he was
a man a little over forty, bearded and
burly, who looked well on towards sixty.
No convict who had done seven years in
an iron-gang upon the public roads of
the colony—particularly in one that had
been superintended by Mr. Benjamin
Bailey—could fail to look more than his
age. In the dark eyes that gazed at
the glories of the sunset over Harrow
Mountain was a look of melancholy,
expectant brooding. In the furrows of
the bald forehead might be read some-
thing of anxious thoughtfulness. In the
gnarled, weathered hands was evidence of
much hard work. In the stains about his
hairy mouth were indications that he
chewed tobacco. That was the pleasing
task he was engaged in now —when he
became aware of a horseman riding up
the track from the creek.
Mr. Borrodaile grunted, went into
the hut and took down a double-
barrelled gun which, loaded with
slugs, always hung over the mantel-
shelf. He lifted the hammers, in turn, to
see that the nipples were properly
capped, and then stood it carefully
against the wall, just inside the door.
These preparations completed, he went
out into the twilight to play the genial
host.
As the wayfarer approached the home-
stead his features became visible. He
was a tall man, not unhandsome, with a
full white beard, and he wore a beaver
top-hat. This he raised politely as he
came up to the front of the little dwell-
ing, seated erect upon an obviously tired
horse. Mr. Borrodaile scrutinised him
closely, standing under the floorless
verandah with his arms folded across his
chest.
Suddenly his strong frame shook under
the stress of some violent emotion. But
he said nothing.
“Good-evening, sir,” said the stranger
in a harsh voice which he obviously,
though vainly, sought to make pleasant.
“I am on my way to Beardy Plains—to
Armidale —where I have business with
the Commissioner, Mr. Macdonald. I
fear I’ve got off the track a little. Could
ye give me a camp for the night?”
It was several seconds before Borro-
daile could trust himself to speak. When
he did speak his voice, also, seemed in-
effectually to struggle against a note of
harshness that would not be denied.
“ ’Tis the Harrow Weald run, mister—
an’ I’m th’ boss. Ye’re very welcome,
I’m sure. We don’t often see strangers
along Micky’s Creek. Yes, ye’re off th’
track to Beardy Plains right enough—
but not far off of it. In th’ morning I’ll
set ye right—l’ll see ye’re on th’ right
track to where ye’re bound for. By God,
yes! ”
“Thank you, sir,” said the tall man,
swinging down from the saddle. “What 11
I do with my horse?”
r. “Let him go there, mister. There’s
good feed on th’ flat, an’ he’ll stop with
th’ station horses. Put y’r saddle on the
verandah, an’ bring y’r valise inside. I’ll
go in and light the lamp. Gets dark
quick—don’t it? —after sundown.”
Whilst the newcomer unstrapped the
leather valise from the pommel of the
saddle and removed the latter from his
jaded mount, Andrew Borrodaile went
inside, picked up his gun and restored it
to its accustomed place, and lit a slush-
lamp that did little more than make the
interior of the dingy hut visible. Then
he set a bottle of rum and glasses
on the table —little grunts of laughter
rumbling through his beard as he busied

YEARS
These last few years have, in a marked or lesser degree,
proved to all the wisdom of making some provision for the
future. All of us have experienced the unexpected financial
calls of everyday life, and, while it is impossible to gauge
accurately the needs of the future, it is possible to provide
for them.
A Savings Account costs nothing to open, and can be
opened nearly anywhere in Australia. With it and the regular
saving of money, however small the amounts, adequate pro-
vision for the unexpected calls will be made.

himself with his hospitalities. Presently
the guest came in, sighing with satisfac-
tion at the ending of a weary day’s
journey.
“A drop o’ grog, mister?”
“Thank ye kindly, sir. ’Tis welcome
enough. I’ve ridden nigh fifty miles since
sunrise—an’ a man’s not so young as he
used to be. Time was —down on th’
Wollombi —when I’d ride along the
Great Northern Road for a day and a
night, and feel none the worse of it.”
“I don’t doubt ye, mister,” responded
Andrew, reflecting grimly that many
others used to feel the worse for Red
Ben Bailey’s pilgrimages. “Well, y’r
ridin’s over now, anyways. Drink
hearty. Here’s luck to ye— for th’ rest
o’ y’r travels.”
Again he could not restrain himself
from putting his words into vocal italics.
A little before eleven o’clock Andrew
Borrodaile held converse in the moon-
light outside their hut with the two stock-
men who lived at the head-station. They
were both old mates of his in the road-
gang—men who were bound to him no
less by the miseries they had endured in
common than by the crimes in which
they had subsequently shared.
“Yes, boys,” he was saying, “ ’tis him
himself, God d n him! I hocussed
his last drink from the medicine-chest,
an’ when he fell asleep I tied him up.
’Tis our turn now —’tis th’ turn I’ve
waited an’ watched for these fifteen
year.”
“Aye, by God, Andy! He’m coom
to the raight plaice this time.”
“And you, Donald?”
The tall fellow with the bushy beard
whom he spoke to last put out his hand
and grasped Borrodaile’s, which he wrung
with fervor.
“Aye, mon. God’s guid tae us th’
nicht. Thir-rteen hunner lashes I’ve suf-
fered through yon devil out o’ Hell.
Ye canna do onything tae him I’ll no
help blithely in. Aye —but God’s unco
guid tae us!”
“An’ what was ye thinkin’ o’ doin’ to
’un, Andy?” asked the man called Billy.
“Come wi’ me and see. I’ve his horse
saddled, an’ all’s ready. Bring y’r guns.
No nigger must see us and live to talk
about it.”
A little after one o’clock the party
came to a halt in the dense forest that
clad the lower slopes of Harrow Moun-
tain. It was a parklike place where the
tall trees grew fairly wide apart. They
had stopped beside the seven-foot-high
hollow stump of a giant dead tree that
lay broken off and shattered into pieces
by some lightning-stroke of many years
before. The limp body of Mr. Bailey
lay across the saddle of his own horse
and he was still unconscious. He was
lashed and bound from head to foot
with a greenhide rope, almost into the
semblance of an Egyptian mummy.
“Into the stump wi’ him,” ordered
Andrew Borrodaile. With infinite labor
they lifted the ex-Superintendent into the
stump and stood him upright in it. His
head and shoulders showed above its
ragged edges, and as they rested after
the heavy labor of getting him there
they saw that he was beginning to regain
consciousness. The lolling head lifted,
and he blinked dazedly up at the
moon.
“ ’Tis a’ recht,” grunted Donald. “He’ll
ken whaur he is afore lang—an’ what’s
come tae happen tae him. God send he
kens us a’! ”
“Now, Billy, cut th’ horse’s throat at
th’ foot o’ th’ stump. We’ll come and
get th’ metal o’ th’ saddle in th’ morning,
an’ what’s left o’ his bones, an’ bury ’em
so that no trace o’ Red Ben’ll be left on
earth —God d n him!”
Presently the struggling horse lay still
at the foot of the stump, with the valise
strapped to the saddle on his back.
Then, under Borrodaile’s directions, they
gathered shattered fragments of the great
dead tree and piled them about the
stump.
“Now, boys, light y’r pipes an’ wait
awhile. He’ll soon have his senses back—
and then our turn’ll come,” remarked
Mr. Borrodaile pleasantly.
They stood regarding him with savage
satisfaction while the moon sailed
high above the dark mountain and the
treetops and all the noises of the still
night went on in the bush about them.
Somewhere in the distance a curlew
wailed. Once an old-man kangaroo
hopped ponderously into a patch of
moonlight and stood regarding the pro-
ceedings solemnly, and then thudded
away into the dark aisles of the forest.
Suddenly a yell came from the stump.
“My God — what’s this ? Where am I?
What the devil” Andrew Borrodaile
stepped forward.
“I’ll tell ye where ye are, Ben Bailey.
Ye’re on th’ doorstep o’ Hell —that’s
where ye are. Many men ye’ve sent
there ; and they’ll be awaiting ye. Do ye
not remember Andy Borrodaile, th’ man
ye flogged at the Twenty Mile —an’ then
tied to a tree, half-naked, all through a
summer’s day so that th’ blowflies
hatched maggots in his back? ’Tis his
turn now. And here’s two more o’ y’r
friends come for to see ye off.”
“Thir-rteen hunner lashes I had
through you, ye devil! ” howled the Scot.
“An’ me —seven year o’ Hell on earth
at Norfolk Island.”
“Years ago I made a song for ye, Ben
Bailey,” called out Borrodaile. “Light
up, Billy, an’ I’ll sing him a verse.”
“God, men, what do you mean to
do?”
“Roast ye alive, you devil!” screamed
Borrodaile, capering grotesquely in the
long grass and shaking his fist at the man
in the stump.
As the flames caught alight from the
spark from Bill Pearce’s flint and steel
that ignited the little heap of dry kindling
at the foot of the pyre, Andrew Borro-
daile chanted the last verse of his hymn:
“Now cursed be the living God,
And curses on this earth !
But cursed long and cursed strong
Be she who gave thee birth !
Now cursed be the living God,
Who made such men as thee !
But I could wait, and I still hate.
No matter that I’m free.
And now, before the living God,
You pay your score to me.”
It will be observed that, with poetic
facility, Mr. Andrew Borrodaile impro-
vised some slight changes from the writ-
ten version that has come down to us
in the stanza he sang that night, over and
over again, as he danced about the blazing
evidence of his revenge.... A horrible
vengeance —but maybe not quite so hor-
rible as that which others took elsewhere
upon an unpopular convict overseer
who was pegged down, naked, upon a
red-ants’ nest. Still, bad enough.
April.
April—the loveliest month of all the year!
A silver shudder fills the atmosphere;
The mountain peaks have shed their summery
haze;
Pellucid nights are here and limpid days.
The seas are calm, the leaves in russet hue,
And campfires lift their spirals to the blue;
While, in the bush, the pools show lilies pale,
And apple-green the slopes of hill and dale.
At dawn, across some distant paddock fence,
The magpies spill their crystal eloquence.
The ruddy quince, the grape upon the vine;
The wild Natal grass by the railway line;
Purple and rose and amber are the hues,
A splash of broken jade with smiling blues,
Till April, like a radiant dream is tossed
Into the arms of May, all white with frost.

Life Is a Cruise.
Life is a cruise. Whatever be your wishes
You’ve got to cross the ocean; you must get
under sail.
You may be on the bridge, or you may be
washing dishes,
You may skim on light and pretty, you may
have to pump and bail.
For some, blue rims of distance never have
the storm’s first puff on them;
For some, it’s typhoons roaring down or dirty
Arctic gale;
And you can take my word the Old Salt,
Time, is rough on them —
Plenty of the rope’s end, plenty swab and
pail!
Life is a cruise. It’s the old shellbacks who
know it,
Sitting on the jetties at the turn of the tide.
They’ve been told to “stow the gaff”—and
they’ve darn well had to stow it —
Ay, they’ve run the gamut, and they speak of
it with pride!
They’ve blistered on the burning seas and
frozen in the grey;
They’ve seen a mort o’ beauty in days when
all wind died;
There were times when, clapped so close
’twixt Hell and Heaven, they
Knew another little thrust would have seen
them right inside!
Life is a cruise, and the younger ones that
take it
Can’t think of hurricanes or reefs or dank
sea-bed.
Let ’em be. They’ll all come shipshape when
they decide to make it,
And some of ’em will find Cathay, and
some sneak home instead!
But each will learn to take a chance; a gal-
leon for a prize,
Or a junk just out from Chiny with silks of
green and red;
He may fall foul of buccaneers with Hell’s
light in their eyes,
Or run into a Dyak and pay forfeit with
his head!
Life is a cruise, with Heaven for the haven
And fiddling from the hammocks (hilly-ho!).
And the Old Salt, Time, has no mercy on the
craven;
He calls us off sudden, on the High Seas or
Low!
Ay, the Old Salt, Time, he likes a chanty
ringing
And the hearties tripping it on heel and toe,
Till he furls all sail to the sound of harps and
singing
In the last blue harbor where all salts
must go.

Science Throws New Light

Pain is nature's warning that teeth are

Contrast the at-
titude of savage

files his teeth
with that of the
modern young
woman who
keeps her teeth
white and beau-
tiful through
daily use of
Pepsodent.
Modern children may well be
expected to have far better
teeth than their ancestors.
’T’HE actual cause
*of the aching
tooth is now be-
lieved to be due to
gases, formed inside i
the tooth during the |
process of decay,
that may or may
not be visible to the
dentist from the
outside. These gases
expand and press
on the sensitive
fcerves of the teeth.
Dental science
answers the ques-
tion of what leads
to toothache by
saying that food
particles have been
permitted to re-
main between the
teeth and under the gums, to decay.
Germs, or bacteria, formed in and by
this decaying food, make acids which
attack the cement-like structure of the
teeth and dissolve out the material
between the enamel rods.
The germs that cause the decay-pro-
ducing acids have a friend in the film-
coat, or mucin-plaque, which forms on
teeth. This film glues the bacteria to
the teeth, providing a sort of warm
shelter for them and even supplies them
with food to thrive on.
Removal of film has therefore become
an important problem for dental science.
One of the most notable discoveries in this
field was made recently in the laboratories
of the Pepsodent Company when a new
and revolutionary cleansing material was
developed. The cleansing and polishing
material is thepart of any toothpaste that
does the work. Herein lies the difference

intricate structure beneath enamel.
between the best toothpaste and
inferior brands. Most cleansing
materials are either so hard and
abrasive that they scratch the
tooth enamel or else they are so soft
that they fail to remove film and
stains. To develop a material
that would outrank others both in
effectiveness and in safety required
several years. The ablest scientific
minds in the country were consulted
repeatedly.
This new discovery is contained in
Pepsodent Toothpaste exclusively. Be-
cause it is twice as soft as the material
most commonly used, Pepsodent is
looked upon as the modern standard of
safety. At the same time this new
material stands unique in its power to
cleanse and polish teeth. To-day Pepso-
dent is known as the special “film-
removing” toothpaste in 67 countries.

Me Dawg.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
KELLY laughed. “It’s old Phil,” he
said. “I wonder how his dog is.
Better chuck another coupler chops
in, Tom.”
Tom chucked the chops into the frying-
pan, and stared up the track. “What
dawg?” he asked.
Kelly laughed again. “You’ll see —or
maybe you won’t. It isn’t everyone can
see old Phil’s dog.”
Old Phil came through the sunlit
patches and the dappled bits and the
shadows of the track, his long swag a
crossbar behind his faded head.
“C’d you do a mug o’ tea?” Kelly
called. “An’ a chop?”
Phil drifted through the bracken
towards the voice. “It’s Kelly,” he mur-
mured, dropping his swag and squatting
on it; “yairs, I c’d do a drop o’ tea. I
got a bit o’ bread an’ cheese they
gimme”
“Keep ’em for to-morrer, Phil. Tom
here has a holt on the township butcher’s
dirty past, and he with chops to burn.
Or maybe he pinched them. How’s yer
dog?”
“ ’E’s all right.” Phil glanced over his
shoulder. “Gets tired, ye know —’e’ll be
glad of a bit of a rest. ’E’s not the dawg
’e was.”
“Where is he?” Tom asked, tipping
some tea into Phil’s billy.
“Back there —’e’s a bit shy of
strangers.”
The veil of fatigue over Phil’s frail
eyes lifted as the tea stimulated him.
He chuckled. “I wouldn’t put it past him
to be hiding from us. Full of fun he is,
at times. The fall o’ dark—that’s ’is
great time. Many a joke ’e’s ’ad with
me. In and out the shadders —you
wouldn’t believe how quick he i 5”....
Kelly winked at Tom, who put a chop
on a hunk of bread and gave it to Phil.
For a space silence lapsed upon the
camp while the old man and Tom and
Kelly ate their chops. In the changing
light Phil looked like one of the shadows.
He wiped his fingers on a tuft of grass.
“Gimme yer bones for me dawg, will
yer?” he said. “I expect ’e’s got a twist
on him be now.” They gave him the
bones. “Ta. Bluey! Bluey !” he called.
The high, thin voice faded into the
bush, woke its faint echoes, was gone in
the deep silence.
Kelly winked at Tom again, and
turned a serious face to Phil. “Out of
range, eh, Phil? Maybe he’s on his own
affairs and won’t bother with us.”
“No. He’s just shy with strangers. I
told yer ’e was.” Phil peered into the
scrub. “No. He won’t come now.” He
dropped the bones into his billy-can. “I’ll
take ’em over to ’im when I’ve done me
pipe.”
“Will ye camp with us to-mght?”
Kelly asked.
“No. I’ll be gettin’ on.” Phil’s gaze
was still searching the shadows in the
undergrowth. “I got to find me dawg,
thank ye kindly, Kelly, an’ make ’im
comfortable Yer see, ’e might be
lonely, on his own out there.”
“What’s ’e stay out there for?” Tom
asked. “What makes him so shy—is he
a pup?”
“A pup?” Phil laughed. “No fear.
I’ve ’ad ’im ten years. Never been
parted from ’im since I got ’im. Except
once.” A gleam, sudden and swift, shone
in Phil’s eyes, transfiguring his face.
“You wouldn’t believe what he’s been
to me.”
“So you were parted from him once,
were you?” Kelly was lighting his pipe.
“Yairs.” The old man’s chuckle was
dim and shadowy as himself. “I tried to
blow meself up, to blow us both up. A
few years back it was —blastin’, Single-
ton way. And I landed on me head....
They tried to tell me that I’d killed me
dawg, blown ’im to smithereens! I knew
that was all me eye, an’ I told ’em so.”
“And it was?” Kelly prompted.
“’Course it was Why, when I
came out o’ the place there was me dawg
waitin’ for me! ” He looked triumphantly
from Tom to Kelly. “There ’e was!
Couldn’t get away from that, could you?”
“You could not,” Kelly agreed.
“And wasn’t I glad to see ’is face!”
They wanted me to go back for—for
observation treatment, they called it. But
not much. Me an’ me dawg kept goin’.”
“But where is he?” Tom insisted.
“Here’s the fire, an’ ”
“Back there,” Phil told him. “I’ll take
’im ’is bones presently. ’E thinks I can’t
find ’im—that’s the game ’e ’as with me.
But I can always find ’im. An’ ’e’ll go
quiet when I do —trot along behind me
■ in the sunshine or the moonlight, as it
might be, as right as ninepence. I’ve
only got to glance over me shoulder an’
there ’e is—like ’e always was —as good
as gold. Sometimes, if I’m tired or slow
about it, ’e gets up to ’is hiding tricks
just before I spot ’im. But that’s ’is bit
o’ fun.” He looked vaguely from Kelly
to Tom. “Isn’t it?”
“Indeed and it is,” Kelly assured him.
“ ’Course it is,” Tom muttered, rak-
ing morosely in the embers.
“Yairs.” Phil laughed and got up,
hitching his swag. “I’ll be gettin’ on.
So 10ng....
“Bluey— Bluey !” .... They heard his
high, thin voice calling in the gathering
shadows.
Heavy shadows, dark on the track. He
plodded on, pretending that he wasn’t
going to look back. Why shouldn’t Bluey
have his little game? We all liked our
bit of fun —he flashed a glance over his
shoulder into the shadows behind. Was
that a blue shape, grey in this light, trot-
ting along there, to be a mate in the soli-
tude? Yes. That’d be him trotting
along, like he always was. Good old
81uey.... a great mate....
They’d done a good few perishes to-
gether—and had a good few bang-up
times, too. Before he busted his head
and those fools in the hospital told him
he’d blown his dog to Kingdom Come
he’d often picked up a steady job, and
he and Bluey had lived like lords. Until
the time came to chuck it in and go on
again with swags up. A great mate.
And now, after all the years, there he
was, trotting along as good as gold—
his glance sped over his shoulder
Earth crumbled from his feet. He was
falling, falling.... black as midnight
“Bluey! 81uey!”....
Echoes of the high, thin call made a
dim sound in his drumming ears as a
vaster blackness swept down, engulfed
him....
Night being gone and the morning
cool for travelling, Tom and Kelly took
the track at dawn.
“Old workin’s over there,” Tom said.
“They say”
A sound cut into the sentence.
“What’s that —a dog in trouble?”
Kelly stared round the empty day.
Tom’s face was stilled, listening. “More
like a moan,” he muttered.
The sound came again, sharper now.
“It is a dog,” Kelly said. “And he
howling his heart out”
“It’s a bloke in the old mine,” Tom
interrupted. “Over here —c’m on”
On the further side the timbering had
rotted and the embankment fallen in—
they got down easily enough.
Old Phil, lying in a heap, looked at
them.
“Arm broken,” he sighed. “An’ a leg,
too, I reckon. Can you”
Kelly bundled his coat into a pillow.
“All night—it’s a wonder ye’re alive. Ye
must have had a hell of a time.”
“Oh, not too bad.” His head shifted
restlessly on the pillow. “I got the wind
up at first, when I was failin’; when I
hit the ground it knocked the stuffin’ out
o’ me, too. But after a bit Bluey fol-
lowed me down —came whimpering
through the moonlight.... It was all
right then.”
“How d’ye mean —all right?” Tom
asked. “How about the rats? Yer
couldn’t do much to keep them off yer.”
Phil chuckled faintly. “No. But Bluey
could. They’re big, ain’t they?”
“Yairs.” Tom looked down at him.
“The —the dawg kept ’em off? I know
these mine rats —eat the head off yer.
And the—the dawg”
Phil chuckled again. “You bet ’e did.
’E looked after me. Not a 0ne”....
Tom looked across at Kelly. “Well,
I’ll be damned”....
“It’s the wonder of the world” —Kelly
peered round the ruined workings, the
eerie, silent place, crossed himself and
sighed. Maybe it was a dog he heard....
It was six weeks before Phil could get
about again. And when he could it was
dull, worse than dull. Rooms, wards, a
verandah, a garden—it was a prison. The
days were hard to get through.
Kelly had got a job at the doctor’s
and came in to have a yarn with Phil
every now and again.
“What’s all this,” Phil asked him one
day, “about me not goin’ on the track
any more?”
“Oh, I dunno.” Kelly was busy with
his pipe. “A matter of talk, maybe.”
“Yairs. But” Phil looked at Kelly,
who glanced up, saw the fear flickering
in his faded eyes, and glanced down
again. “This doctor.... I wouldn't

Kelly felt sad. It was a damn shame,
The proper place for a bushman was the
bush. What in the world would a bush-
man be doing in a Home? “It might be
they’d think ye were gettin’ up in years
or the like,” he mumbled. “Ye can’t tell
the notions they’d be getting.”
“But what about Bluey?”
“Well,” Kelly hated this, “I suppose
they’d let you have him in the—in the
place.”
Phil stared at him, the fear still watch-
ful in his eyes. “But ’e’s used to the
track, same as me. We couldn’t do with-
out it, either of us. He’d break his heart
in a—anywhere else.”
“Don’t be worryin’ yerself without
cause.” Kelly tapped out his pipe and
got up. “To-morrow they may have a
different notion altogether.”
Phil shook his head. “I know what

gaze fled past the garden, the asphalt

bush, the track, the sleep by the dying
fire. But Kelly always had a good face
on everything—you had to watch that,
And the doctor did say
You couldn’t believe it....
He’d go down the street and get a bit

Kelly might be right....
Outside the gates he whistled Bluey,
and plodded on down the street. Bluey
was a bit shy these days (and no won-
der), and he didn’t come at once. But
presently he trotted along all right, and
looked up into Phil’s face,
He looked as if he’d got something
on his mind. And he didn’t keep to
heel; he went on ahead—looked back to
see if Phil was following.
Funny. It wasn’t like Bluey to boss

looking back again, and Phil chuckled,

“Nuff Said.”
BY HORTON BROOKS.
MIFSUD, no doubt, was his name.
But, to the members of our ward—
or casemate, as they called it there
—he was known as “Nuff Sed.” It
scarcely suited him, I used to think. He
deserved something more euphonious.
We were a mixed lot in that casemate.
Tommies, Scotties, Enzeds, a Royal Dub-
lin Fusilier, as well as Aussies. The
M. 0., rather to my surprise, proved to
be a Canadian ; the Sister was an Eng-
lishwoman of noble birth. Something
was needed to complete the ensemble.
“Nuff Sed,” in the role of assistant
orderly, completed it.
“Nuff Sed” was an artist at his job.
Olive-skinned, handsome in an effemi-
nate-looking way, he had hands which
should have belonged only to a master-
pianist. Not that “Nuff Sed” was not
musical; he could whistle almost any
passage from Puccini’s operas. From
other operas, too ; but Puccini was his
favorite composer, I soon came to know,
listening to him when he swept the piazza
beyond the large open doorway of the
casemate.
Leaning over the stone balustrade, you
could gaze out over the harbor, lying
hundreds of feet sheer below, and well
understand the impregnability of the
walled city which had for so long been
the home of the Knights of St. John.
“Nuff Sed” was the apple of Sister’s
eye. He was of immeasurably greater
assistance to her than the R.A.M.C.
orderly—one of the sort that is born
tired. The young Maltese was used to
the ways of troops ; before the war he
had served in the canteen of these sub-
stantial old barracks which were now
doing service as a hospital.
“Nuff Sed,” then, took us for granted.
But there was one way in which you
could always get a “bite” from him, and
that was to refer disparagingly to the
King’s Own Maltas. »
There never were too such opposites
as “Nuff Sed” and Bill Bullock, the
latest arrival in the casemate.
I think the sight of Bill rather startled
“Nuff Sed” at first. You would have
thought they might have trimmed him
up a bit while he was in the hospital
ship. A giant he was; you could
tell it even as he lay on the stretcher,
the upper part of his clay-smeared tunic
showing above the blankets and match-
ing in its earthiness his shaggy beard and
even shaggier hair. He had been a
sniper.
For a while Bill was in a bad
way. He had been wounded in the
stomach, but not when sniping. Shrapnel
it was: he had had the bad luck to run
foul of “Beachy” when his crowd were
out resting in one of the gullies near the
beach.
The hospital barber soon got to work
on Bill. But it didn’t seem to make much
difference with Sister. Her reactions
had rather amused me; she seemed
incapable of understanding him. And so
Bill was left largely in “Nuff Sed’s”
hands. Capable hands they proved. Bill
began to pick up.
No woman could have been more
patient, more thorough, in her ministra-
tions than “Nuff Sed.” He waited
on his patient hand and foot. Nearer
forty than thirty, Bill was almost
old enough to have been “Nuff Sed’s”
father. You would have expected the
youngster to choose some other hero.
For that was what Bill had become to
“Nuff Sed.”
Bill was slow in perceiving it. At first
the Maltese must have been something
altogether out of his ken. And Bill’s
life hitherto had been untouched by soft
influences, I felt sure. When he did be-
gin to realise the attention he was receiv-
ing from “Nuff Sed” and the regard the
youth had for him, he was flattered. As
his condition improved, I could see that
an affection for “Nuff Sed” had sprung
up in him.
I was approaching the convalescent
stage and had made a few excursions
into the city proper. It chanced that I,
too, had sampled those macaroni-pies
over which Pobjoy waxed so enthusiastic
one day in the casemate.
Pobjoy was the Tommy occupying the
bed in the far corner close by the door-
way leading on to the piazza. Heaven
knows what his complaint was; but there
was nothing wrong with his stomach.
He had only got as far as Lemnos; and
more than one of us had formed the idea
that he was a lead-swinger. But Saun-
ders, the young Victorian in the next
bed, had become rather pally with him.
Ordinarily Pobjoy was slow and heavy
in his speech; but I must admit that he
astonished me with the graphic descrip-
tion he gave of those macaroni-pies.
I looked across at Bill. “Nuff Sed”
had just taken to him his usual bowl of
milk-sops. I saw Bill’s deep-set eyes light
up with interest as he listened to Pob-
joy, still holding the floor. And when I
saw the look of disgust on his face as
ruefully he surveyed his fare, I felt sorry
for Bill.
And I began to have other feelings,
t 00.... He had escorted me down to
the C.C.S. on the beach ; he had waited
hours there looking after me until at last
the barge had come bumping against the
jetty. He had shaken me by the hand ;
then, I suppose, he had wandered back
to the dugout we had shared together at
the foot of Walker’s Ridge.
And there was Jim. So occupied had
I been with the attractions of Valetta
that I had scarcely given a thought to
Jim. But something I saw in Bill’s face
brought Anzac back to me vividly. I my-
self had not been on Gallipoli long
enough to acquire that look; but I had
seen it on many a sun-scorched, weather-
worn face at Anzac. A dogged look ; but
the suffering showed through.
I had been reading a newspaper which
had arrived in. the Australian mail when
Pobjoy chose to make himself heard. It
had been full of Another Victory at
Anzac. How little seemed to be known
in Australia of the real Anzac!
Bill took a turn for the worse. Peri-
tonitis had set in. Soon a murmur went
round the casemate that it was all up
with Bill.

“Nuff Sed” was one of the first to
realise it. His face took on quite a hag-
gard look, and he moved about silently.
Most of us were awake that night.
The padre had called in during the after-
noon ; Sister had gone off duty at about
nine o’clock, knocked up after a particu-
larly heavy day ; the night orderly had
failed to put in an appearance, and it had
been arranged that “Nuff Sed” should
remain on duty with the night nurse.
I had never had much confidence in
the night nurse: she was such a frail
little thing. But she made a pretty pic-
ture, sitting there in the near corner of
the casemate, poring over some novel in
the light from her shaded reading-lamp.
It must have been close on twelve o’clock
when, after another examination of Bill,
she dispatched “Nuff Sed” to bring in
the Duty M.O. She had the wind up.
The M.O. arrived. After a brief in-
spection he ordered “Nuff Sed” to put
the screen around Bill’s bed.
My heart sank. In the dim light from
the one colored globe I could see that
the chap in the next bed to me, an Enzed,
was watching, too. Presently the M.O.
switched on his pocket-torch again ; he
had laid it on the locker, I judged from
the sound. His figure and that of the
night nurse were silhouetted on the
screen. “Nuff Sed” had taken up a posi-
tion near the foot of the bed.
He had been standing there perfectly
motionless for so long, it seemed. Then
suddenly he stirred slightly. 1 realised
that he had been praying.
Poor old Bill; dying so far away from
the Riverina! This strange land would
be his resting-place ; and at the death-
bed that English doctor, that young Eng-
lish nurse, the queer, devoted Maltese
boy!
I started violently when I heard the
sound. Yet it was familiar enough :
simply the shriek of the siren of some
steamer in the harbor below. It had
caught “Nuff Sed” off his guard, too.
The movements of those shadows on
the screen! All too expressive they had
been!
The M.O. had given some order to
“Nuff Sed.” “Nuff Sed,” to my surprise,
did not respond.
I saw something flash in the dim light.
Was it a knife in “Nuff Sed’s” raised
hand? No, it was a pair of surgical
scissors he must have taken up from the
dressing-trolley beside him. The M.O.
was staring at the lad open-mouthed.
The night nurse had fallen in a faint.
With the swiftness of an arrow, and as
silently, too, “Nuff Sed” had ranged
alongside Pobjoy’s bed, lying at the ex-
treme end of the casemate there. Rais-
ing his arm, he had plunged the scissors
right into Pobjoy’s back and left them
there. And Pobjoy had not moved: had
not uttered a sound.
Low exclamations of horror came
from the soldiers in the casemate. The
M.O. still stood there, spellbound. This
I sensed rather than saw ; for the whole
of my horrified gaze was directed to-
wards “Nuff Sed.” He had drawn now
several paces further away from the bed,
and was sagging, rather than standing,
there, his hands clasped to his head.
I could feel my bed shake. The sound
had gone right through me —the shriek,
again, of that siren somewhere out there
in the harbor.
“Nuff Sed” turned suddenly on hearing
the sound. In an attitude that was al-
most statuesque now, he stood there,
staring out through the open doorway,
staring out into the night. With a cry
I am never likely to forget he dashed
out of the casemate on to the piazza.
1 heard the scrape of his shoes on the
stone balustrade. The sound seemed to
make little impression on me ; for, some-
how, I had anticipated it. I heard no
more.
I could see it all now. In “Nuff Sed’s”
attitude as he had stood there by Bill
Bullock’s bed, indeed ever since Bill’s
attack of peritonitis had come on, there
had been a suggestion of guilt! The
realisation of it had come to me at the
moment I saw him ranging alongside
Pobjoy’s bed. It was Pobjoy who had
mentioned the macaroni-pies which had
so excited poor Bill’s envy, those maca-
roni-pies which —against his better judg-
ment, no doubt —“Nuff Sed” had been
buying for Bill! Although I had had
no knowledge of this, I felt certain that
I was right. It was through that glutton
Pobjoy that “Nuff Sed” had lost his hero.
And the sight of Pobjoy’s gross figure
lying there....
Recovering himself at last, the M.O.
was moving toward the spot. I shut my
eyes to it all; I felt that I could stand no
more.
But I joined at last in the small gather-
ing around Pobjoy’s bed....
Pobjoy was spending the night up the
town somewhere. Supplemented by that
bolster, what an excellent dummy his kit-
bag made!
A few of the chaps had known of it,
it seemed: I was one of those who were
staggered at the discovery Never
having got beyond Lemnos, he had man-
aged to retain his kit-bag. And from
somewhere he had purloined a whole
round of cheese.
The M.C. had withdrawn the scissors
now; quite a deep cut they had made,
But I continued to contemplate the
cheese. How like Pobjoy it was!
An Alarming Disclosure,
BY BETHUNE.
“An official German service organ reveals
that Britain has three 18-inch guns, the heaviest
in existence, mounted at Changi, to guard the
naval base at Singapore. Each gun is 59 feet
long, weighs 150 tons, and fires a projectile
weighing 33001 b.”
IT is strange that the German agents
should have taken so long to find this
out. It has been common knowledge
all over Asia for years.
An eyewitness of the arrival of the
guns at Changi states that they were
brought in mission schooners, consigned
to the British and Foreign Bible Society
and labelled “Tracts.” The mission chil-
dren carried them to the gun emplace-
ments the same day. These structures
had been ready for some time, the con-
crete having been smuggled into the
country in a similar fashion, camouflaged
as “Teething Powders.”
The task of mounting the guns was
carried out by Malay coolies, who are
recognised throughout the world as
second to none in their knowledge of
heavy artillery. They were told that the
weapons were fourteen-pounders cap-
tured during the war and sent out as
trophies as a present to the Sultan of
Johore, who lives next door.
For several years the guns have kept
watch over the Straits. There is a per-
manent secret garrison at Changi, the
members of which carry on the innocent
occupations of drink waiters and punkah
wallahs, whose name is legion in the
Straits.
Regular firing practice is carried out
three times a week, while the native
population is having its noonday snooze.
Every precaution is taken to keep this
secret. A silencer is attached to each gun,
rendering it practically silent, and any
faint noise that may be heard is put down
to the tiger-hunting party which goes out
into the jungle purposely to divert atten-
tion from the base.
In order that no damage shall be done
in Sumatra and the Andamans, special
rubber projectiles are used, which keep
bouncing for several hours after striking
the ground, to the great mystification of
the inhabitants of the surrounding
islands. For some time the garrison has
been carrying out research work in con-
nection with trajectories and ricochets, and
it hopes before long to devise a method
whereby the shells will bounce back to
the base. Several boomerang experts
from Centralia are now experimenting
with this phase of the job.
It will no doubt come as a grave sur-
prise to most Australians to learn that
the Japanese have been working on very
similar lines for the past decade on our
northern coast. Cape York is heavily
fortified with twenty-inch guns, weighing
two hundred tons and capable of land-
ing shells in New Guinea, or alternatively
of raking the entire length of the Great
Barrier Reef.
Practically all the mission station
blacks, and most of the wild blacks, are
in reality Japanese in disguise, highly
trained and merely waiting for word
from Tokio.
Mysterious sampans and sinister-look-
ing pearling luggers have landed thou-
sands of tons of railway material, whisky,
quinine and other campaigning necessi-
ties, and everything is in readiness for
the rapid construction of a light railway
to Birdsville, which has been chosen be-
cause its dust-storms provide natural
camouflage. With this point in foreign
hands, Australia would be paralysed, and
it would be simple for the invaders to
swoop down on Canberra.
Of course, all would not be entirely
lost, as the Federal Parliament, for the
good of the country, would have shifted
hastily to Antarctica, which has just been
taken over. Nevertheless, things would
be in a very awkward position.
Something should clearly be done
about the matter. It is time the Pri-
minister sent a select committee up to
Cape York to carry out a complete
investigation extending over three or
four years. Or, better still, two select
committees; it would relieve southern
congestion.

research. This has long been realised
by the chemists responsible for the
success of Heari’s Tonic Nerve Nuts.

better tonic for restoring the health of
people who are run-down, nervy,
neurotic, anaemic, or out of sorts, we
substantiate the claim by publishing the
formula of this popular tonic. Hean s
Tonic Nerve Nuts contain calcium,
glycerophosphate, carbonate of iron
extract, cascara sagrada, and capsicin.
They are compounded in tablet form,

an excellent formula this is for restoring
the health of people suffering from
ailments caused by exhausted nerves,
poorness of blood, overwork or worry.
Modern chemistry has proved the
advisability of preparing such remedies
in tablet form, for it solves the
problem of correct doses, and is more
convenient for taking and carrying by
users. Modern laboratory methods
have made it' possible for Hean s Tonic
Nerve Nuts to be sold to the public
at a reasonable price, for bottles
containing ‘l2 days supply cost only
3/-, and, in t most cases, good health is
assured by the taking of two or three

of money for the restoration of their
health is indeed a wonderfully good
investment.
