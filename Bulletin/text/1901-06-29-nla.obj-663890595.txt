Voices from the Basket.
AY that ninety percent, of offered verse
finds its way to the waste-basket, or
is shown a way —what is it like?
Well, most of sit is flat, uninteresting
-the ' rhymed commonplace of uninterest-
ig people—neither bad nor good, and con-
iquently damned utterly. Very bad verse
i sbmetimes interesting by reason of its
adness —the worse it is, the more human it
i : it does n’t conform with the rules of
Lterature, but it has a heart and a pulse,
fluent, feeble mediocrity—that is the thing
xecrable ; for the writers have lost Nature
without gaining Art. The “loyal poetry”
lere recently ■ printed was not without
ts peculiar virtue: it was earnest, for the
nost part; it was felt. When a man feels,
t is odds on his attainment of some measure
jf expression; to feel is to write, given
practice enough. To-be-sure, there are
minds which can never appreciate the gold-
smith’s work of. Taste : subtle shades are
beyond their vision, subtle harmonies beyond
their ears. ' That matters little if there be
sufficient Taste to refrain from the more
obvious blunders. Byron survives, and
good judges praise him, though he penned
probably not one line which a high
canon would hold faultless. He sur-
vives in virtue of his passion, his force ;
and no “ lapidary style ” can supplant
these, or compensate for their absence from
verse. The body is always more than the
raiment. What you have to remember is
that to fully and fitly express a round
emotion in square words is an impossible
thing. There is an eternal conflict between
Feeling and Style. You want to find the
exact poise which will gain most Style while
sacrificing least Feeling ; and the balance
varies. Style is the preservative ; but
only Feeling is worth lyrical preservation.
(Thought, unless sublimated to Feeling,
belongs to Prose.) So the verse-architect’s
problem is very like that which confronts the
naval architect : you have to gain speed,
but. without losing cargo-capacity ; and the
theoretical line of grace is continually being
, subordinated to practical utility.
Here, mow, is a piece of verse which would
be basketed with regret, even from the
merely literary point of view : from the
human point of view it was preserved for
this occasion of print. It comes from that
storehouse of never-to-be-written romance,
Rookwood CN.S. W.) Benevolent Asylum.
He might be Scottish ; and then again he
mightn't. Bat there is no doubt about the
Scot in George Reid, one of whose admirers
presents a cherished copy of his “Poem.”
The ardent young Cobdenite of the seventies
produced several Freetrade, economical
“ poems ” which earned fugacious fame in
the newspapers; but the “Lines addressed to
New South Wales on the opening of the First
Australian International Exhibition ” appear
to be the only ones embalmed for pamphlet
perpetuity. Printed in Syd. Evening News
I Sept. 17, 79, they were reprinted by
ibbs, Shallard, and circulated by the author
whose prefatory note declares that he “ is
lite aware that he runs risk of
lyerse criticism in publishing a * maiden
Fort ’ of this kind.”
The “lines” are rather better than Fitz-
bbon’s, and not quite so good as Parkes s.
hero are some 220 limping Alexandrines,
imposed with labour and sweat—like these .
enial hostess of a world-invited throng,
a thou the only goddess of my humble song,
or in a presence bright and beautiful as thine,
one can lament the absence of a classic shrine.
nd fraught with happy fates was the eventful
hour, . ,

hy sunny plains—so long the paradise of brutes,
Gil now be bless’d with Cultivation’s choicest
fruits ; .

glow’d, ... , i
erchance become of Christ-like love the calm
abode.
Enter Cobden—

nor sold !
Iklas ! the space that shields thee from all foreign
harms,
Elides from the outer world thy most attractive
charms ;
indeed in Paris but a very short time back,
Some of thy daughters were disowned because not

Long lines mean easy rhymes ; but this
versified speech is not made without diffi-
culty, and by the time he reaches the Expo-
sition the author is tiring.
Here, massive motors whirl a wilderness of
wheels—
There, wondrous trifles to the gentler taste
appeal. ■ \< :
It ’s near enough. The “ lines ’’—solid,
shrewd, sensible, unimaginative, like the
author and his nation —close with King
Charles’s head
This harmony of force was early understood
By that first ’mong modern princes— Albkrt the
■ Good’; . ,
Bright harbinger of the restored, primeval plan,
That seeks the freedom yet the brotherhood of
man ! v . k
And the basket is still overflowing. “ The
rest would fill a vohim.lv, but it s neither
here or then.”
THE BOOKFELLOW.
THE WALERMAN'S TREE.
I The Chorus :
Chill on his face the death mist was stealing,
L : mp were the hauls lyin > helpless an l cold,
The haze o’er his eyes came slowly revealing
We soon would carry him over the Wold.
The Walerman :
Bend over and listen and hold the word law :
Gather a dozen boys, strong, tall and bold,
Let six mare;i behind and six march before,
And keep even step as I go o’er the wold.
And get the old lorry and harness the bays ;
Two you can do, but the four would be bold :
And step it out briskly—but keep me two days—
Tnen step strongly out as 1 go o’er the wold.
And polish the harness all sheeny and black,
Give the hosses a clip and shine ’em like gold
All hairy and shaggy !—with them on the track
I’d look a rare fright as I went o’er the wold.
You must paint up the lorry, fairy and span—
(She ’ll make a good show when she comes to b
sold)
For years yet to come they ’ll tell yarns o the mar
Who went with four bays his last way o’er tht
wold.
A sawn board coffin so the worms won’t come thro
The ironbark joints till I canker to mould,
It’s an old man’s right and an honest man’s d ue—
Is a right tight shell as he goes o’er the wold.
Then take my old duck gun and clean out the
grime
And fire a half-charge as I go in the mould,
And step it right briskly and firmly to time—
But you ’ll fire her once as you start o’er the
I wold!
Bind small branches o’ the wattle in blossom—
Your father’s a Waler tho’ ninety years old !
Bind to the bays so in stepping they ’ll toss ’em
And they ’ll be my plumes as I go o’er the wold.
And stick in my hat a twig o’ the blossom,
(The band’s nearly broken—you ’ll see it will
hold) ‘ v'
Toss’t in with me; it’s the skin of a ’possum
Brought down by my gun as I went o’er the
wold.
Remember your dad was a boy in his prime—
Sing “John Brown’s Body” right airily and
bold: , „
And you’ll make ’em keep right I—why, bless me,
the time
Will be just the thing as we pass o’er the wold.
And grease those dry boxes and stop the loud
Else “ John Brown’s Body ” would fall flat as it
rolled :
And don’t let me bog in the mud o’ the creek,
But take me right airily over the wold.
I don’t want the parson to pilot me thro’,
Nor suavely stretch his gloved paw for my gold;
When my Jean named ye did they sprinkle their
dew ?
Eh ? We won’t have the parson over the wold.
And plant a good wattle seed over my grave,
Take a big hatful o’ the creek’s rot and mould ;
It will give her a growth right airy and brave,
And show you the place where we lie o’er the
wold.
Wrap me a blanket, a blanket around me ;
Oh I am tired boys ! so tired and cold ;
I think ... I see your old mother before me
Beckoning me near wherg she lies o’er the wold.
The Chorus.
Wran him a long sheet, a winding sheet round him;
Coffin him in—the Walerman hoary and old:
Best at the last: ah! long rest where they ’ll ground
him,
Down deep in the hole where he ’ll lie o’er the wold.
There the dingoes howl at the dawn of the day,
When the shivering dogs skulk the winter's cold ;
There the crows seek shade as a rest by the way ;
But there’s rest for the Walermanon the wold.
William Robert Campbell.
Admire the truth of it, the strength of it,
the stern, tramping rhythm of it—its rugged
majesty, as of some scarred, weather-beaten
visage of the people, the toilers, grown grand
in conflict. That is a piece of verse to be
treasured beyond many of the prettily-
pranked artificialities of our literary popin-
jays. Why 1 Because it holds the writer’s
virile Force : it is muscular and massive ; if
rough-hewn, it is hewn from the rock.
But there is reason to question the origi-
nality : more probably it was re-written from
an old model—some clanking chant of the
iron “ early days.” For here is what looks
like another variant of the original—soma-
' what trimmer and tidier (as becomes the
nautical sphere), and less impressive—
THE SAILOR LAID LOW.
I ’ve grown old sailing over the ocean ; •
My blood’s growing chilly and dry ;
So good-bye to the sea’s rough commotion !
For to-morrow I’m going to die.
Roll me up in the old spare gaff-topsail!
Place a shot at my head and my toe !
Then sink me deep down in blue water
Where the swift tides may over me flow.
Gfet me twenty-five jolly good fellows
In their own boats to form a long row,
And let every manjack strain his bellows
Singing this poor old shellback’s laid low.
Bring along a large case of blue ruin,
That my mourners may never feel dry ;
Bring a cask of Joe Harley’s last brewing,
And give me a good drink ere I die.
After death I am going to Heaven,
To the land where there’s rivers of rum ;
There my wings will be sixes by seven
And the winds through my tail-feathers hum.
I go straight to that sweet land of beauty
Where there never was any hard graft—
Where Tobacco and Rum’s free from duty,
And the same tucker’s for’ard and aft.
So, farewell to this blooming old hooker,
To the captain, the mates, and. the crew !
To the cook, which his name’s Billy Booker,
And the poor little cabin boy, 'too !
Roll me up in the old spare gaff-topsail l
For I know that I have got my call;
My wing and tail feathers are sprouting—
I am off, so good-bye to you all!
I Possibly some reader can give a clue to the
historic source of both versions ? .
Come to the bush man’s rhyme of to-day.
The songs that are sung in the huts and on
the camps have little to do with Literature
with an L ; but they are often racy, often
graphic, and always close to the aboriginal
emotions. “ Songs”—“sung”—for the first
thing that the typical bushman does with a
piece of verse is to set it to some tune slum-
bering in his brain, and drone it through his
nose for the benefit of listening mates or
gum-trees. His song corresponds with pic-
ture-writing : it is the Word audible instead of
the Word visible. He has to utter in order
to fully comprehend and feel. By the
typical bushman is not meant the up-to-date
shearer with his latest magazines, or the
digger with his civilised interest in f/ie Bul-
letin; but the Bush-grown, Bush-ro*ted pro-
duct, the nomad tethered in the limits of the
cattle-track, the shepherd stagnant among
out-station sheep, or the man hidden all his
days among the gullies and the ranges, in a
world bounded on the one side by the re-
mote township, on the other by the great Aus-
tralian silence. After all that has been saidand.
written, we know little more of thin type of
bushman than the fact that he chants “The
Wild Colonial Boy ” —a ballad whose verses
must by this time stretch on to infinity,
since it is a kind of boa-constrictor ballad,
which swallows, and digests, and incorpor-
ates all small-fry verses which come within
the ken of its adepts. Here, from the
basket-mass, is a typical piece to be sung by
this typical bushman.
(THE SQUATER AN: KANGAROO.)
(A Muse.)
A s a squater took a ride one-day across his run
some kangaroo s espied that were basking in the
sun
as in the tall grass contented like they lay
The squater took a ride across and to them did
say
Begone from here you kangaroos quickly with
sp6ed
and a warning i will make to you for eating all
my feed
when again i come this way i will bring dogs an
gun
Then for it mu ’ll dearly pay if i find you on this
run
Then up there sprang a kaingaroo who to the
squatter came
his color was a reddish hue with gigantic frame
he bounded through the greenwood while com-
rades looked on
then before the squater stood this champion'
Those words unto the squater thus this kangaroo
did say
you say that you will slaughter us when next you
come this way
and us to destroy you will bring dogs an gun
But your threats i defy i will not leave this run
Both the dogs an the squater are coward to the
base'
our weaker ones to slaughter they are galnt on
the chase. .
on this run i was bred an here to will 1 die
when perchance some piece of led will give me
my death cry
Three of your greyhounds already i have slain
and yonder near those sandy mounds they are
bleaching on the plain
here alone do i stand get down from your mare
and battle with me hand to hand aproach me if
you dare
No no did the squater say that i will never do
for you have proved this day a noble kangaroo
you an your mates may roam at will an never
more know strife
for a kangaroo ill never kill you are safe from
dogs or rife
The old kangaroo is living still be seen often in
the bends , .
and with his mates he roams at will amongs ms
wooly friends
nothing for to greave them i will close this muse
So peace we leave them an give them our
adues.
David Harford.
There is romance in that, if you could
hear it chanted more on less hiccupically
from the Boulia pub-verandah on the night
of the races. The pieces which follow are
less characteristic, more sophisticated by
“the coast.”
BUSHMAN IN TOWN.
A bushman stepped into a pub
not to have a bust
but to see the barmaid
if she did give trust
the barmaid give a surly look
and sulky she said
have you not heard the news
that poor trust is dead
trust is dead the bushman said
when did the poor man die
it is hard luck for you must know
that lam so dry ~ ’
yo’ 11 get no drink the barmaid said
with a sulky frown
why don’t, you do a bit of work
and not loaf round the town
the bushman who was full of fun
no longer could resist
and soon a scoie of sovereigns
filled his sunburnt fists
then the barmaid smiled and said
you took me by surprise
I’ll take back what I said
I do appolijize
appolijize the bushman said
who was full of pranks
as the barmaid filled a glass
the bushman said no thanks
the barmaid almost stupified
stood there in dismay
and as the bushman left the beer
he smiled and said good day.
That is good “bush,” but not the best.
Another is from an older hand, and twanging
rather English than Australian ; yet it is
“The Song of the Open Road” from all
Australian point of view.
TRAMPS LIFE.
I am an Australian Working man
This country for to roain
All 1 got is a swag and a Billy Can'
And a gum tree is my home
I tramped across the Mountians blue
My Bundle on my back
And a days work I cannot get to do
Till I get to the Stations Back
I have to camp in frost and snow
In a wild be wild red place
And every where that I will go
line looked on in disgrace
So ail folks pitty the poor tramp
While his weary life he’ll spend
The Moon that Shine is his parler lamp
And the Brite sun his best friend
Its when I wake, line feeling old
As by a log I’me lyeing
I am almost perrished with the cold
Till the welcome sun will shine
Its then I rise my humble head
My quivering body shake
As I will leave my lonely bed
And no breakfast have to take
Ive seldom got enough to eat
Bad cloths, I have to wear
And the weary roads I dayle beat
And no Body seem to care
I call to the farmers dwelling
' Some tucker for to ask
In my pocket theres not a shilling
So it is a terriable task
Some times I am refused right strate
And ordered from the door
And as I pass out through the gate
Around me the dogs do roar
Some times the farmer ask of me
What sort of work I seek
And hard enough Oh he will be
To offer five Bob a week
Oh this I think is very Cruel
And you might all plainly see
I think that I would be a fool
To scab my country
The road .is wide through many a hill
My feet and back are sore
And with hardship myself I’ll Kill
Before the wages I will lower
I’ll Tramp to the North of Queensland
And die beside a log
Before I will turn my hand
And be a rich maus dog.
That lias not the Australian emotion : as a
matter of fact, there are very few Austra-
lian-born swagmen. The local youth has a
nest, or cuts a niche ; but in poverty he is
stationary, when he travels it is for profit.
“He knows a better game than swagging ”
—even if it be “spieling. 1 '
Embarrassment of riches ! —and space is
filling. But this heart-felt “poem” must
have place.
THE DEATH OF WABGHOPE.
He fell at the head of his Columb
While cheering on his men,
his brave deeds would fill a volumb
but its neither here or then
He knew when, he got the order
oh that Cold and Chilly morn
er’d he’d Cross the foe mens border \
a corpse he would be borne
But I will do my duty
I am here But to obey
then follow me my beauties
we’l attack at dawn of day -»
But he fell at the first volly
of that memorial fight
this hero who always was jolly
Who was always so cheerful and Bright
He fell mortaly woundend
Pei reed through with shot and shell
Brave m m I expected it sooner
for it don’t blame me lads Farewell
Those Brave men of Tartan and kilt
who fight fiercest when there blood as been spilt
with heads bowed low and a tightness of chest
they laid ther Comander away to rest,
and as they stood round that new made grave
this question often was asked
and the pipes seemed to say as sweetly they played
revenge sweet revenge to the last,
ther foe men outlined on the crest of the hill
instinctive each man raised his eye
W ith sorrow and grief each Breast was filled
you could read revenge in each eye.
As they moved away with a quick firm tread
from the grave of there comrade they loved
With knit brows and a look that said
no good for the foes on the hill above.
For they have carried the sway on many a day
their courage there only sheild
when foes ran away in fear and dismay
from the Charge of the icy cold steel.

EMULSION
wrra hypophosphites_
BETTER THAN
GOD-LIVER OIL.
ANGIER’S Petroleum Emulsion is
better than Cod-Liver Oil because it
is pleasant to take, agrees with the
most delicate stomach, and aids digestion
instead of disturbing it. No matter how
nutritious food may be in itself, it is of no
real use until it has been digested and
absorbed. It is because of its marked
power to promote assimilation of ordinary
daily food that Angier’s Emulsion is so
superior to Cod-Liver Oil in all wasting
diseases. It has besides healing and cura-
tive virtues which Cod-Liver Oil does not
possess, and which make it positively
without an equal for troublesome coughs,
weak lungs, and all chronic lung affectmns.
It is prescribed by the medical profession,
and. used in the hospitals.

The Return.
Beloved, the summer is with us,
The breezes blow soft from the sea ;
The roses, are scenting my garden,
And blooming for thee.
The swallows are waiting to greet thee,
So come ere they fly with the rain !
And let us forget with the summer
And love once again.
Beloved, the summer is dying,
The roses have fall’n in the night,
And out in my garden the petals
Lie withered and white.
So haste thy return, my belov’d one
(The breezes blow chill from the sea),
And bid, with the last of the swallows,
Adieu unto me.
“ Dear heart, I am here in thy garden !
Fast, fast at thy call have I sped
To share in thy joy of the summer ! ”
But summer was dead !

Ballade of Constancy.
One moment wait upon the bridge
That spans the rippling clear lagoon,
While slowly o’er the purple ridge
Climbs steadily the waning moon.
Ah. love ! it seems but yester-eve
Love came upon us suddenly—
An idle hour our hearts to weave—■
An hour of idle ecstasy.
Nor Devil nor Divinity
Must serve to keep us two apart;
Nor Time nor all Eternity
Should heal that dear delicious smart.
Ah, love ! alas for constancy !
Another heart’s beneath vour feet,
Whilst I fulfil the comedy
And call another maiden sweet.

Two Graves at Port Davey.
Ever moaning, moaning sadly,
As I sit within the bay,
I can hear the ocean, madly
Lifting high its stormful spray.
Out beyond the rocky pillars, lo! I hear it far
away.
Oh, I never heard it moaning
With such sad and bitter wail,
As it were some spirit groaning,
Fragments of some piteous tale
Of the tempest-tossed and dying, wringing hands
without avail.
Weirdest scene of desolation,
Wildest hills and shrieking sea !
None hath here his avocation,
Not a bird and scarce a tree,
But two graves are on the sandbank, comrades in
obscurity.
Wreckage from old Ocean’s slaughter,
Stranded here for unknown years;
Name and fame are writ in water,
Though a piece of pine appears
With some faded letters on it, which I scarce
cna read for tears.
Fifty years or more, if rightly
I the fallen fragment read,
Here they lay ; while for them, nightly,
Ever since, above their head,
Sigh the breezes, and the Ocean sings a requiem
for the dead.
All the night our barque seemed rocking,
As if moved with speechless grief,
Or with mimic music mocking
Hoarser tones upon the reef,
Art and Nature here combining, singing for the
soul’s relief,
O’er these outcasts from the sainted
Who in God’s own acre rest,
Tn a broken tin some painted
Amaranthine flowers were pressed
By some horny-handed seaman, whom my heart
devoutly blessed.
These were faded, but unfading
Was his deed before my eyes,
Prompted by that grace pervading
Hearts that God doth canonise,
For the willing cup of water to the Master in
disguise.
So I slept until the morrow,
Loving more this lonely spot,
And in dreams forgot my sorrow
Since the dead were not forgot
Even here, in this wild graveyard, where the
mourner cometh not.

Linens, Cottons and Woollens are soon reduced

SUNLIGHT SOAP does not contain any alkali
in a free state and is really the cheapest in the
end, as all articles washed with it last much
longer than if washed with ordinary soap.

How Britain is Getting Left.
While the unburied ghost of the Fiscal
Issue stalks abroad in Australian politics the
question of the alleged decadence or other-
wise of Britain under its Freetrade policy is
a subject of endless and rather weary con-
troversy. Wild and woolly Foreign-traders
from N.S.W. allege that the magnificent and
unparalleled prosperity of Britain is a solid
proof of the truth of the tariff principles
which they never practised in their own
State. Many Protectionists, on the other
hand, hold that the great and obvious slump
of Britain is a conspicuous evidence that
Freetrade is a lost faith and a dead super-
stition. But many considerations go to
make up the case either way, and many of
the politicians interested are crude and
whirling persons who don’t know their own
subject, and who, for want of study, have to
invent their frantic evidences as they go
along. Moreover, it is generally twenty
years or more after a nation really begins to
lose ground before the process is unmistak-
ably apparent. It is necessary to stand off
at the distance of a decade or so before
things can be viewed at the proper angle, so
to speak.
• • * *
Yet within the last year or so some start-
ling things have happened. Britain; for
years and years the money-lender of the
earth, has actually been borrowing money in
the United States with which to carry on
the war in South Africa. Several foreign
loans, of the kind which used to be issued in
London as a matter of course, have been lately
floated in New York, which is seriously dis-
puting with London the billet of the world’s
financial centre. New South Wales has
even lately been invited to place its foreign
loans in New York, with a promise of better
terms than London can give. Something
like 30 years ago the United States, for the
first time, seriously challenged Britain’s
supremacy as a manufacturing state ; and it
has since then so utterly left its rival
behind that in 1896 (no later returns
are available) its output of manufactured
goods was worth £1,980,000,000 per annum
(equal to, roughly speaking, £29 worth
for every inhabitant) against Britain’s
£876,000,000 (equal to about £22 worth per
inhabitant). In fact, as a manufacturing
country the United States now 7 beats the whole,
British empire badly. Last year, for the first
time in history, the United States beat Great
Britain and Ireland as an exporter of its
own produce to foreign markets ; its exports
of its own goods increased by £40,500,000 in
one year, against the United Kingdom’s
increase of barely £27,000,000, and
the supremacy which the United King-
dom held against all-comers for gene-
rations has disappeared at last. Still
more recently two other noteworthy
events have been recorded. For Britain to
own foreign railways has long been a matter
of course, but now one of the London city
railways has passed into American hands,
and at least one other is likely to pass
shortly, which is a strange up-ending of the
old order of things. And the United
States, after for many years leaving
Britain the unquestioned mistress of the
seas, now calmly announces a determination
to make the Atlantic an American lake. As
a preliminary step the fourth largest ship-
owning concern in Britain has been bought
up bodily by American owners, together with
a controlling interest in another very large
British shipping concern. A third huge
British shipping co. has been bought up
bodily by Germans, who now own, in the
Hamburg-Amerika line and the Norddeut-
scher-Lloyd, the two largest shipping con-
cerns in the world, even the smaller of them
being far ahead of any single British enter-
prise of its kind.
• * • *
There was a time when the Briton held
control of the sea through his superior apti-
tude for a seafaring life, and in those days any
serious attempt at foreign competition might
reasonably be denounced as absurd. But
things have changed in later years, and the
proposal to make the Atlantic an American
lake is less ridiculous than it seems.
Out of the 244,135 seamen who manned
Britain’s ships at the end of 1899, 33,805
were Asiatics (Statistical Abstract of the
United Kingdom for 1899, page 179).
Between 1896 and 1899 the Asiatic sailors in
British ships increased by 3806, while the
white sailors diminished by 1710 (same
authority and same page). Of the white
sailors, an immense but unknowm proportion
are Scandinavians, Germans, Dutchmen,
Greeks, Italians, &c. And any foreign
nation, with the needful money and commer-
cial energy, can buy ships and hire all these
people to man them quite as easily as
Britain can. Commercial supremacy on the
sea may now go any day to the nation with
most commercial energy and most money.
And the United States kept its word so
emphatically wben it undertook to deprive
Britain of its manufacturing supremacy that
it would be rash to regard its present under-
taking as impossible.
* * * *
Even before the Germans and Americans
bought up two of Britain’s great steam
fleets, some curious things were happening
in the old land. The number of vessels
belonging to the United Kingdom decreased
from 23,662 in 1885 to 20,196 in 1899 (Statis-
tical Abstract of the United Kingdom
for 1899, page 175), the fall being con-
tinuous all along—though as the vessels are
larger, and the total tonnage increased
materially, this is of less importance than
might appear. The point that is of real im-
portance is that Britain is no longer keeping
its hold on the trade of its own ports as it
used to do. This is the total tonnage of
British and foreign vessels engaged in trade
with foreign countries and British possessions,
which entered and cleared at British ports
in 1896 and 1899 (Statistical Abstract of
the United Kingdom for 1899, page 164) :

From 1885 (where the figures of the Statisti-
cal Abstract commence) to the end of 1895.
Britain kept securing a larger and larger
share of the trade of its own ports, but
since then the movement has been all the
other way. The last year of the four (1899)
was also the worst. In that year the
British shipping entering and clearing from
the United Kingdom for foreign and colonial
ports increased by 1,432,261 tons ; the
foreign shipping increased by no less than
5,386,660 tons—in other words, during 1899,
foreigners annexed nearly 80 per cent, of
the new shipping trade in British ports. In
1898 the position was even more remarkable.
The British shipping engaged in the foreign
and colonial trade whicli entered and left
United Kingdom ports decreased by 209,817
tons, while the foreign shipping increased
by 974,920 tons.

The coastal trade of Britain is still almost
wholly in British hands, and there .the
foreigner is only a.n atom- —not much of an
atom either. But even there the order of
things has changed a little since 1896. Wit-

Another point of interest to those who
study the alleged decadence of Britain is its
wonderful mass of imports as compared with
its very much smaller exports. About this
question a vast amount of misconception
exists. It is not necessarily a good sign nor
a bad sign that exports should exceed im-
ports ; nor is it necessarily a good or bad
sign that imports should exceed exports.
The situation may be summed up in these
six propositions :
(1) If exports exceed imports it may be a good sign, sig-
nifying that a country is very rich and is investing its
surplus money abroad.
(2) If exports exceed imports it may be a bad sign, sig-
nifying that a country owes much money abroad, and the
surplus exports are required to pay interest.
(3) If exports very largely exceed imports it may be a
better sign, signifying that the country can not only spare
enough surplus exports to pay interest on its foreign
debts, but also something over with which to pay off the
debts themselves.
And on the other hand :
(4) A surplus of imports may be a bad sign, signifying
that a country is buying more than it can pay for, and is
heaping up a great foreign debt. (This was the case in
Australia in earlier days, when it was piling up its monu-
mental mass of outside liabilities.)
(5) A surplus of imports may be a good sign, signi-
fying that a country has much money owing to it abroad,
and that the interest is coming in in the shape of goods.
(6) A larger surplus of imports may be a bad sign again,
signifying that the same country is not only getting back
its interest in goods and eating that up, but that it is
also getting back some of the principal of its loans in
goods, and is eating them up—eating its past accumula-
tions, in fact, and becoming poor again.
» » * *
And this is the curious record of the
United Kingdom in recent years (Statisti-
cal Abstract of the United Kingdom for
1899, page 49, except as regards the figures
for 1900, which are from the Royal Statis-
tical Journal) :

Re-Exports). Imports.

1900 .. 523,634,000 354,550,000 169,084,000
This stupendous increase of nearly £77,000,000
in the surplus of imports since 1890 can’t be
accounted for by the increased earnings of
British shipping, which has only begun since
then to feel the stress of foreign competi-
tion. It can’t be accounted for on the
assumption that Britain has, in nine years,
lent about 1200 million pounds extra to
foreign countries, and is getting in all
this extra interest in consequence, for such
a sum is wildly ridiculous. The increased
gold influx from South Africa, which is the
only unusual streak of luck Britain has had
in recent years, only accounts for about
£9,000,000, or one-seventh of the whole in-
crease. The only visible explanation is that
France, Germany, and the United States
(principally the two latter), and some other
prosperous States that used to be heavily
mortgaged to Britain, are paying off their
debts, and thatßritain, to that extent; is eating
up its past accumulations and becoming
poorer. And the spectacle of American
financiers taking up'British loans, and reach-
ing out for Britain’s position as loan-monger
to other nations, and intruding in British
railway ownership, and utterly wiping out
Britain’s manufacturing supremacy, and of
Americans and Germans and other nations
seizing upon an increasing share of the trade
of British ports, lends color to this view of
the problem.
* * * *
Another notable point is that Britain’s
exports of manufactured goods are falling
away. Between 1890 and 1899 its exports
only increased by about £1,282,000. But
its export of coal increased by £4,000,000 ;
of herrings, by over £900,000 ; of raw hides,
by over £250,000; and so on down the
list of raw materials ; while its sales of
manufactured goods are diminishing. On the
other hand, its imports of manufactured goods
are increasing enormously; being already
dependent on foreign States for its food it is
also learning to be increasingly dependent on
them for its manufactures. The situation is
a curious one. The United Kingdom hope-
lessly lost its once commanding position as
an agricultural State a good many years ago.
About 1870 or 1875 the United States left it
behind as a manufacturing State, and be-
tween 1870 and 1880 Germany began to pro-
gress so much more rapidly in this line of
industry than Britain that it became only a
matter of time when it would also get in
front. About 1880 Britain lost its position
as the wealthiest country on earth, the
United States taking the lead. But still it
remained the world’s greatest sea-carrier;
the greatest commercial State on this planet;
the centre of the world’s finance ; the State
which had the biggest mortgage on the out-
side globe. Now, the United States and
Germany both propose to fight seriously
for commercial supremacy on the sea.
The United States is beginning to bid
for the billet of the world’s financier and
money-lender ; there are signs that Britain’s
mortgage on the globe is diminishing a little
—the United States alone is reported,
within the last five years, to have paid oft'
£200,000,000 of its liabilities to its old-time
creditor ; and last year, for the first time in
an immense period of history, Britain
dropped into second place as an exporter of
its own products.
» * • *
These things, all added together, may
mean the actual beginning of a decline, or
they may simply mean that Britain is still
progressing but is no longer putting up the
best rate of progress. The latter theory may
mean actual decline later on or again it may
not. There is generally an interval ot a good
many years after a State ceases to e
definitely first before it becomes definitely
second or third —a hazy period when lis
difficult to say how far the matters in which
it still leads counterbalance those in which
it has : fallen to second or third or
fourth place. Britain is in that hazy intei-
mediate stage now. The situation is only
definite enough to make it certain that the
present isn’t a good time to talk of the
United Kingdom as an overwhelming proof
of the advantages of any fiscal policy. In its
old Protectionist days Britain was so far
ahead of every other country in everything
(with the possible exception of agriculture,
and it held a high position even in that
respect) that there was no unpleasant haze
whatsoever.
“This is a Young Country.”
“ Yet it is evident to all who give themselves the
trouble to think'that, in a young and comparatively un-
developed country like this, a certain expenditure out of
permanent loans for public works is not only prudent but
necessary.” — Premier See, of N.S. W., at Graftonr ~
The Bulletin has sometimes had an idea that
it would be a healthy tiling if it could be arranged
that every writer and politician should write or
speak with a half-ton weight suspended over his
head, and whenever he states that this is a young
country the weight should fall automatically and
obliterate him. It is an unwholesome thing for
any land to eternally pose as a young country,
just as it is for any man to pose as a Boy
.Politician. The habit of being a young country is
doing Australia immense harm. It creates an im-
pression, somehow, that Dan O’Connor invented
Australia, and that alone is a disaster. The general
conviction here is that wages should be higher and
hours shorter than in other lands because this is a
young country —which is a ridiculous theory, for
the age of the country has no relation to the case ;
that taxes should be lower than elsewhere because
this is a young country ; that it is quite safe to
borrow an awful amount of money, because this is
a young country ; also (in some quarters) that it
is absurd to think of promoting manufactures
here because, this is a young country, and a young
country should be content to peg away at the
worst-paid of all the world’s occupations—that of
agriculture; and (in some other quarters) that
Australia’s ports should be opened freely to
Asiatics, Africans, Polynesians, and all such,
because this is a young country and needs popula-
tion. Further, the writer has heard proposals for
selling to foreign syndicates, mines, tramways,
great blocks of land, and almost all our other
assets, defended, at one time and another, on the
ground that this is a young country.
* • • •
Yet, according to the politician’s acceptation
of the term, Australia is really no younger than
any other country. That is where the abject
silliness of the whole tale comes in. The politician
mostly holds forth about Australia’s extreme
youth as an excuse for the towering Public Debt,
and his theory is something like this : “ Australia
is a young country which had all its railways,
telegraphs, telephones, roads, bridges, public
schools, sewerage systems, water supply systems,
gaols, lighthouses, docks, and other public work*
to build ; therefore, its situation is quite excep-
tional, and it has an exceptional debt as a matter
of course.” And his audience, as a rule, sees the
point quite clearly. Yet, during the century in
which Australia built all its railways, telegraphs
and telephones, every other country in the world
had to build all its railways, telegraphs and tele-
phones also. In these directions all the world is
just as young as Australia, and entitled to
exactly the same commiseration. In the same
century almost every other country in the world
had to build its public schools just as Australia
had, for the supply of schools before that time was
pitiably small. Also most countries have built
the bulk of their roads within the last 100 years,
exactly as Australia had to do, because most of the
roads existing previous to then were wholly use-
less according to modern ideas. Scotland, 150
years ago, had only tracks. Austria was a land
without a road for 30 years after Australia was
first settled. Seven-eighths of the roads of France
were made since 1835. All the roads of Portugal
have been made since 1840. Italy only began to
make roads long after Australia had started. In
all these countries what was called a road till
quite recently was only a streak of soil with foot
marks on it. It was practically the same with
Germany, Russia, Canada, the United States—
almost the whole world in fact. Australia, in this
matter, is just as young a country as nearly every
other country, and it would be ridiculous to have
the whole world apologising for its extreme youth.
♦ * * *
Similarly, every other country has had to build
its bridges within the last 100 years—just like
Australia. Bridges were very scarce a century
ago, and most of those that existed have worn out
since then, and been rebuilt. Every other land,
just like Australia, has had to build its post-offices,
gaols, &c., during the life-time of this country,
because the old ones wore out or became obsolete.
In fact, as regards post offices, most of the world
was almost as ill-provided as Australia 100 years
ago. Almost every costly water-supply system in
the world has been constructed within the last 70
years; almost every sewerage system within the
last 50 or 60 years.
* ♦ * *
In fact, when Australia started, the world started
also, as far as concerns almost- all the costly
essentials of modern civilisation. When Aus-
tralia commenced as a white man’s country, it and
the rest of the globe were equally guiltless of
railways, telegraphs, telephones, street tramways,
modern sewage systems, modern water-supply
systems, modern schools, prisons, lunatic asy-
lums, and gas and electric-lighting systems; arid
the rest of the world was almost as badly off as
Australia for roads, bridges, public libraries, post-
offices, lighthouses, for docks and harbours that
would accommodate modern shipping, and for
almost everything else which makes up the loan
bill of this great community. Civilisation, as we
understand it, is quite a recent thing, and in a
civilised sense all the white man’s world is about
equally new.
* * * *
But the world didn’t begin level bv any means.
Europe started with an incredible load'of debt,
burdened with huge armies, and ruined by 20
years of war. Australia started with no armies to
maintain, no war debt, and with what is even yet,
in proportion to population, the grandest asset on
earth in the shape of its public lands —an asset
winch, depleted, as it- is, still brings in nearly
£4,000,000 a year. And the result, when this
young country is compared with others quite as
young so far as modern civilisation is concerned,
is not flattering. Australia, despi ie its gold, its
land revenues, and its freedom from war debts and
war losses, owes .practically every copper of the

value of its railways, tramways, telegraphs, tele-
phones, water supply and sewerage systems, and
most of its road and bridge and harbour and light-
house expenditure, and a lot of other moneys
besides. Denmark, with none of Australia’s ad-
vantages, built all these public works out of re-
venue and paid off the cost of a disastrous
war as well. Sweden and Norway paid
a small part of the cost of their State
railways, and practically all the cost of
their other public works out of revenue. Prussia
- did likewise; so, in a less degree, did Holland,
Belgium, and Austria. In fact, it is necessary to
hunt round among the disreputable scalawag
kingdoms of Europe to find one which parallels
Australia, and even they have the excuse that
they never enjoyed Australia’s land and gold
revenues, that wars and the necessity for main-
taining large armies weighed them down, and
that they began the new era of civilisation loaded
with old war burdens. But among them all there
isn’t one which laments regularly about being a
young country as an excuse for its debts, though
as regards the matters which make debts in Aus-
tralia they are mostly just about the same age as
this country—some of them younger.
* * * •
So it is hereby moved that Australian politi-
cians cease offering the weary remark that this is
a young country as a full and satisfactory explana-
tion of everything. It is silly and it sounds
abject. New South Wales, at all events, as
the oldest of the States, is just as old, for
all the intents and purposes of Premier See’s
observation, as any other average place, and
it has had chances which no civilised State outside
Australia possessed. Its troubles have nothing to
do with its alleged youth. They mostly arise
from the fact that for over 100 years its people
paid no direct taxation, and comparatively little
indirect taxation, and explained, as a sufficient
reason for this course of action, that N. S. W. was
a young country. And they made up the shortage
by floating huge loans, and if anyone expressed a
doubt as to the wisdom of this course the state-
ment that N.S.W. was a young country settled
everything. And now that the revenue is wholly
insufficient to meet the interest on these past
follies, the average politician’s remedy and balm
and explanation consist of the ancient and moss-
grown remark that N.S.W. is a young country,
and that irrelevant observation covers a multitude
of sins.
Father Carey’s Chickens.
Father Carey’s chickens, like Mother Carey’s
chickens, are the emblem of just one thing—Bad
Luck, wherever you sight ’em.
• * * *
Father Carey’s chickens are the returned war-
riors, the returned “Bushmen,” the glorious
soldiers who went out to tread down the liberties
oc the little Dutch-African republics—“for fun.”
“ For the Empire,” the toadying, tuft-hunting
wire-pullers said ; but the men’s troubles about
“the Empire”! They nearly all went to the
war for a change, for sport, for what they could
make out of it. They had their sport ; they’ve
“ made their bit,” and many of them have spent
it in the private soldier’s usual way ; and now
they are back on Father Carey’s hands. Father
Carey wants to turn them over to the taxpayer to
provide for. That is so like the Jingo—he’s
always generous— at other people's expense.
» * * *
Father Carey is boss director of Sydney Daily
Telegraph —which kept the Protectionist Lyne
Govt, in office despite its own Foreign-trade prin-
ciples ; but not, as it protests, because nine or
ten Govt, billets were distributed, or might have
been distributed, among its directors and staff.
Father Carey is boss-director of the Daily Tele-
graph—which is boss-director of the little politi-
cal junta of wire-pulling nobodies who declare
who’s who in theN.S. W. Foreign-trade party, and
try to ram their pets down electors’ throats
by force of the Daily Telegraph. And
Father Carey’s paper is grieved because no-
thing is done for his chickens. The See
Govt, won’t create billets regardless of expense
for incompetent chickens to fill ; it won’t even
give obviously incompetent chickens the existing
billets which competent men are waiting to fill.
In other words, it won’t rob the taxpayer—not
this time, not wholesale. And Father Carey is
grieved. The Telegraph weeps over his chickens
in leading articles. It wants a little board
appointed—another little board ! —with powers of
patronage for Father Carey’s chickens, and (of
course !) d—n the expense. Possibly the Tele-
graph knows two or three nice little men waiting
to draw salaries on that nice little board ? Good
Old Father Carey ?
* * * •
The Bulletin enters an emphatic “No!” to
the proposal. Let the Jingoes provide their own
billets, and put their hands in their own pockets.
These returned soldiers have done nothing for
Australia but waste Australian money. For that
they are not specially to blame : they had their
chance of “sport,” and they took it. But Aus-
tralia owes them nothing: the conditions of
agreement were clearly stated beforehand, and
the conditions are fulfilled. While they have been
away thousands of other Australians, just as good
or better, have stuck to hard graft without any
“change,” and they deserve all the consideration
that is going.
* * * •
Heroism 1 The Bulletin swears there is as
much heroism, and more, shown every week on
the mining fields of Australia—and in a dozen
other avocations. The man who faces a lighted
fuse to take his fallen mate out of a shaft earns the
Victoria Cross a dozen times over; for he has no
esprit-de-corps to stimulate him, no hope of reward,
no bait of “glory.” And a hundred similar cases
suggest themselves—met and conquered every
week by the soldiers of industry, the soldiers
of whom alone Australia has reason to be proud.
* * « •
The Telegraph pleads that Father Carey’s
pets are unfit for honest graft in competition with
others. That is the Jingo curse come home to
roost. Many of these men left their wives and
families, left occupations where they were of use
to the country ; and now they are unfit to go back
to their places in the industrial machine. They
have become the typical military drone who lives
on the sweat of the laborer. And the country is
to support them!
* * * *
Let Father Carey and the Telegraph and
the Jingoes support them. They are respon-
sible. Send Father Carey’s hat round again;
boom the Jingo drum again ; let the
Telegraph howl again for subscriptions and
advertise subscribers in bigger space, than ever.
Why should Father Carey’s chickens be made a
permanent burden on the taxpayer ? There is
only one reaspn—because your typical Jingo is
warlike only as long as the responsibility doesn’t
come home to his own life, or his own pocket. He
has the front of a lion, the tail of a dingo.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Libelling the Crow-Eater Army.
Adelaide, the Holy City where church-spires
stick up the spikes on the uneven porcupine,
had a final spasm of desperate'Jingoism when the
Duke was nearly due. It apparently went out
looking for a small person to hit in honor of the
Empire, and it fell upon C. W. Chandler, editor
of tiie Fuel Lance, who was already in gaol for
libel, and who now gets six months’ mope gaol and
is fined £5O for reflecting on the 'morals of one
of the contingents. For Reflecting on the Morals
of Soldiers ! !!! Chandler’s paper alleged that
when this contingent was camped at Adelaide
24 females were discovered one night in the
tents. Chandler afterwards stated that he didn’t
see the article before it appeared in print, but.
that point may pass ; as editor it was his duty to
know what appeared in his- own paper. Two
officers in charge at the camp swore indig-
nantly that there were no women found
in, or turned out of, the camp on the night
in question. A third and superior officer
admitted that females might have got into the
camp without the knowledge of the officers, the
fence being reasonably accessible,' so, as far as
concerned the presence of women it was freely
admitted that Chandler's tale might be partly
true. Chandler’s paper didn’t specify any in-
dividual soldier as an offender, so it didn’t libel
any person in particular, but the State’s legal
authorities, in their frenzy of Jingoism, went for
Chandler for libelling at least 24 persons un-
known out of a large body, just as they might go
for him for saying there were over 3000 illegitimate
births in S. A. within the last ten years, and thus
libelling about (5000 unspecified men and women
out of a large community, or for libelling the
human race generally by saying,, as the
preacher does every Sunday, that most of
it is going on the broad road to perdition.
And in its loathsomely servile desire to
get a conviction it put a whole lot of distinctly
false issues before the jurymen, and appealed to
their meanest instincts of illogical grovel. The
Crown’s representative told them that “it was
unbearable that soldiers who had since fallen in
the defence of their country should be falsely
charged with having committed the abomi-
nations referred to on the eve of their depar-
ture from their native land.” The “ abomina-
tions” are matters which happen daily in
S.A., as shown by the illegitimacy record
and other evidences. They were just plain,
ordinary immorality, and the Government which
made such a fuss thinks so little of plain, ordinary
immorality, when the parties are of the age to be
responsible for their own sins, and no side issues
are involved, that it doesn’t even treat it as an
offence punishable by 2s. fid. fine. A. Government
which goes on like that has no right io strike such
attitudes and howl about “abominations.” The
prosecution defined S.A. as the “ native land ” of
the maligned soldiers, so by its own showing
the statement that they died in defence
of their country (which is presumably
their native land) was an attempt to
inflame the minds of the jury on a false issue ; the
Boers never threatened South Australia, and
nobody died in its defence. The prosecution also
shrieked about the unbearableness of such a false
accusation against the dead, but it didn’t make
the least attempt to prove that the charge was
directed against any of the dead soldiers. No
soldiers in particular were specified, and the State
Law Department simply alleged on its own unsup-
ported say-so, that those who were meant in-
cluded some of the men who are now dead.
It was the kind of tombstone claptrap that was
calculated to make a jury boil over with maudlin
sentiment and run amuck, but there wasn’t a
shred of evidence behind it. When anyone says
(and such things are occasionally said) that the
illegitimacy record of S.A. for the past ten years
is a disgrace to the community, he reflects on the
dead in exactly the same way as Chandler’s
paper did, for a good part of the community has
died in the last ten years. Also the prosecution
just took it for granted, without a vestige of proof,
and apparently hustled the jury into doing like-
wise, that the morals of the cohentingent were so
beautiful, and so much better than the S.A.
average, that the charge of having women in the
camp was a blight upon its character. In the
city of churches and brothels that Crown Law
functionary got up, with the hair of a strange
animal on his head, to profess that the mere sus-
picion that a S.A. soldier might, be just a very
ordinary human being, and not more than three
times as moral as David, the Psalmist, was an out-
rage, an unbelievable horror, a foul aspersion
and an obvious, glaring, shocking lie—also an
“abomination.” Chandler’s yarn was foolish
and clumsy and not too clean, but it was a lot
more respectable than the yarn by which the un-
speakably mean and revoltingly hypocritical
Crown got him six months.

A Minimum Wage for Teachers.
The teaching profession of New South Wales has
lately made its voice heard in a small way asking
where its minimum-wage comes in. It can only
do it in a small way, for though the pick-and-
shovel employe may besiege the Government
offices and the papers with his. grievances, the
teacher who did so would incur the high displea-
sure of that awful potentate— the Department.
The average wage of the Cornstalk teacher in 1896
was £ll7 4s. per annum. By 18 )9 it had sunk to
£ll5 4s. per annum (these figures can be verified
by anyone who cares to divide the amount
spent on teachers’ salaries by the number of
teachers, as given in Coghlan’s “Statistical
Register”). The See Government has gained
much kudos by fixing a minimum wage of 7s. a
day for pick-and-shovel men and the like in
Government employ. That is at the rate of about
£lO9 a year. The average wage of the Cornstalk
teacher is not much higher than that, and the
minimum doesn’t come within gunshot of it. And
the teacher has to spend years of study to get
there. He commences about the age of 15 as a
pupil teacher, and remains in that grade four
years. He goes up for a stiff examination, and if
he passes, and if he be among the first 25 that
pass; he is sent for a year to the training-college.
At the end of that time he gets an appointment at
a magnificent £96 a year. After a year he rises to
£lO4 ; in another year to £ll3 ; in another year to
£l2O. He has now been working for the Depart-
ment eight years—the first four for a practically
invisible wage. Then he is sent out into the
country at £136 a year, and he may remain at that
figure for eight or ten years—in fact, there is no
guarantee at all that he will get off it. He may
be a 3A man, or a 28, or a 2A, but whether he has
toiled to qualify for the highest degree, or con-
tented himself with the lowest one, he gets the same
salary, and freezes at the same point. The
teachers- make the very modest suggestion that
the 3A man (even he has to be a person of much
knowledge and some ability) should stick fast at
£l2O ; that the 2B man should increase by annual
increments to £136, and the 2A man by annual
increments to £l7l but this simple idea of vary-
ing the salary according to ability, and encourag-
ing the teacher to qualify for the higher grades, is
beyond the department’s comprehension. The
only way to secure further advancement (unless
the teacher has “influence”) is to pass a further
exam, and get a still higher certificate. But the
teacher can only go up for this final exam, by per-
mission of the Department, and a man who has
studied continuously till he could pass with ease
may be refused permission till he is old, if the
Department feels that way. If he gets permission
and passes, he remains where he is till he is further
examined by the boss inspector, and gets his cer-
tificate confirmed, and if lie is in the far-back and
inaccessible regions of the State he may wait and
moulder for years till the great boss inspector, who
alone can conduct this final exam., comes his
way- The teacher is growing pretty old by this
time on his £136 a year. His great chance lies in
getting appointed to a school. Then he is paid
according to the class of the school, and class
depends on size. If he is a man of high attain-
ments he may be appointed at a good salary to a
large school in a prosperous mining town, and
then the mines may burst up, and the population
depart, and as the attendance diminishes the
teacher’s salary goes down with a run. And a
very inferior man appointed to control a small
school at small pay may find his salary go up
through an influx of population till he gets a far
higher wage than the man who ranks above him.
And, curiously enough, the men who fail in the
first examination, and never qualify for the train-
ing College course at all, often get better appoint-
ments than the ones who qualify with high
honors. And why all this muddle should be
Heaven only knows. It is tolerably oertain the
Department doesn’t.

Tv/o Samples of Sydney “ Telegraph.”
This is from Sydney Daily Telegraph's leading
article of 21st June, 1901
For years past the Protectionist body has been deceiv-
ing the country with false cries as to the state of its
finances, AND DECLARING IN THE TEETH OF ALL
EVIDENCE THAT UNDER A FREETRADE SYSTEM
OF TAXATION IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY PAY ITS
W AY. Yet, since they have been in t)lHce, they have to
admit that the State income has been largely in excess of
the normal expenditure.
You observe that it was absolutely false to state
that N.S.W. didn’t and couldn’t pay its way with
the revenue supplied by Reid’s ' tariff—which
came in force on Ist January, 1890, and is still in
force. And this —ye gods ! —is from Sydney
Daily Telegraph of 20th June, 1901—just one
day earlier: —
There is always in the finances of New South Wales
something to be .shelved, and the result is that the de-
ficiency, instead of diminishing, increases. Take the
acknowledged deficiencies from December 31, 1890. In
the following statement, the totals down to June, 1899,
are from the. Auditor-General’s report; that for June,
1900, is from Sir William Lyne’s accounts (not yet vouched
for by the Auditor-General); and that for June, 1901,
is based on Mr. Waddell’s own statement of the posi-
tion :
* In the half-year ended June 30, 1895, credit was taken
for £341,320, which should rightly have come off the
original deficiency, In 1898-9, credit was taken impro-
perly for £150,000, which was added to deficiency in 1899-
1900. ** Surplus.
Excluding the exceptional half-year in 1895, the average
new deficiency created in the 10 years has been £274,000
per annum.
In all these years there has in reality been only one
surplus—in 1897-B—and that was questionable, owing to
the charges made to “ short-dated loans.”
Thus it appears on the Daily Telegraph’s own
showing that :
(1) The Protectionists were telling the absolute truth
when they said N.S.W. couldn’t pay its way under the
Reid Tariff, and the untruth is in the Telegraph’s
leading article of next day, wherein it eats its own words
and its own figures.
(2) The Telegraph, in its anxiety to bolster up the
Calico Jimmy Government r>f G. Reid, told shameful in-
accuracies about his alleged surpluses. It now admits
that the two biggest shortages were in 1891 (mostly
under Parkes), and in 1896, under Reid.
(3) The Telegraph now admits that Reid only pro-
fessed to square the accounts for the half-vear to 30th
June, 1895, by improperly annexing £341,320 of loan
moneys as revenue, and by not paying the half-year’s
charge (£75,000) in reduction of deficit.
(4) It now admits that the only surplus which was pro-
duced under the Reid tariff (a miserable £8060) was a
dubious affair created by charging much ordinary 7 ex-
penditure to short-dated loans. '
(5) It practically admits that its years of yelling about
the “ Dibbs deficit,” and its constant comparisons be-
tween the thriftless Dibbs and the economical and solvent
Reid were a mean slander on its old enemv Dibbs. The
three years in which N.S.W. worked wholly under Dibbs’s
estimates and Dibbs’s financial system left a deficit of
£629,325 (£209 t 775 per annum). Then follow four com-
plete years under Reid : deficit, £787,353, or £196,838
per annum, with the additional information that t 311,320
was improperly taken into revenue from loans, that
£150,000 was improperly taken credit for, that a half-
year’s sinking fund wasn’t paid, and that the deficit
would have been much larger but for the charging of
ordinary expenses to Reid’s new “short-dated loan”
device. Which, all put together, make Reid so much
worse than Dibbs that there is no possible comparison
between the two. Even the Telegraph doesn’t charge
Dibbs with any cooking of the accounts.
This is a good deal for the Foreign-trade organ to
convict itself of in two days. Its own evidence is
to the effect that it meanly hounded down a com-
paratively thrifty Premier with shrieks of “Dibbs’s
deficit,” and systematically bolstered up a worse
one by assuring the public that Reid’s financial
doings were all right; that it wasn’t telling the
truth when it assured the country that the revenue
under Reid’s tariff was quite sufficient; and that
it let N.S.W. go further and further on the road
to rum, and pile up a bigger and bigger deficit,
not only without saying a word of serious
warning, but while assuring the people that those
who uttered words of warning were quite un-
worthy of credit. Also, it is hollering to the
people to. put the old Reid crowd of figure-fakers
(they are that by its own showing) back into office.
In fact, it stands off and throws mud at itself as a
journal that is wholly unfit to be trusted when the
country s interests and the importers’ • interests
come in conflict.

Premier See’s Doctrine of Cowardice.
Over a year ago, when the clear atmosphere of-
Austraha was rent with the cries of the Jingo
about the “sacrifices” he was prepared to make
for the Empire, and the sky was darkened with
i up-thrown bell-topper, this paper
asked him flatly whether his sacrifices would go
the length of paying the War Bill, or whether he
only meant to have the excitement of seeing the
contingents come and go (he didn’t go himself, as
a rule), the banquets, the “glory,” the titles, &c.,
and leave the coming generation to pay as usual.
And it tried to explain to him, without giving
needless offence, that if he took the latter course
he would be a coward, a good ideal of a liar, and
a very abject and erawlsome fraud. So far as
New South Wales is concerned, Premier John
See supplied the answer about a week ago in these
word :—•
The extraordinary expenditure consequent on the
outbreak of the plague, and the cost involved
in sending the contingents to South Africa and
China will amount to about £320,000. That will he
provided for, and provided for out of. revenue. It
was never contemplated that the whole of the expendi-
ture in connection with these matters should fall upon
one single year. It would be just as reasonable to expect
the British Government to charge the whole cost of the
South African war against one year as to expect us to pro-
vide for these extraordinary expenditures out of one
years revenue. The contention is* of course, absolutely
a isurd, and would not be maintained by any fair-minded,
reasonable man.
Ihe Bulletin tries to be reasonably fair-minded,
and it takes this opportunity to remark (again
without any desire to give offence) that the
above statement is a deliberate and childish per-
version of the case. Also that the Jingo who
blattered so much about the “sacrifices” he was
going to make for the empire is proving himself
just the same mean and sneakful fraud that was
expected. In the first place, consider the two
war-bills:—
War Bill
Population. War Bill. per
~ , Inhabitant.
United Kingdom .. 41,454,217 £153,317,000 £3 13 11
New South Wales .. 1,362,232 320,000 4 9
The fair-minded and reasonable John See holds
that it would be just as reasonable to expect
Britain to pay its whole war bill (£3 13s. lid.
per inhabitant) out of revenue in one year as to
expect N.S.W. to pay its whole war bill (4s. 9d.
per inhabitant) out of revenue in one year. Surely
the useless and unornamental John must mistake
N.S.W, for a lunatic asylum! And as a matter
of fact Britain has paid, or is paying, the follow-
ing sums out of revenue each year, by the simple,
courageous process of levying extra taxation :
War charges paid
by Britain out of Amount per
extra taxation. inhabitant.
1900- .. .. £10,866,000 .. ss. 3d.
1901- .. .. 15,883,000 .. 7s. Bd.
These amounts don’t nearly represent all the war
charges that Britain lias paid out of revenue—it
has paid over £18,000,000 more, and its total war
charges paid out of revenue in the last three
years have been at the average rate of Bs. 4d. per
inhabitant per annum. The above are only the
amounts which it has paid by extra taxation.
On the other hand, Premier See hasn’t paid one
penny of N.S.W’s war expenses (which are only
4s. 9d. per inhabitant in all) out of new taxation
or old taxation, or out of revenue in any shape.
Nor has he provided for any of them. ' And, as
usual, he is moaning in the ditch (for it really
amounts to that) that the people of N.S.W. are
such a poor, miserable, hopeless lot that they
can’t be expected to face their responsibilities as
other States do —that the Briton in his own
country may be a gritty person, who doesn’t mind
an extra tax of 7s. Bd. per inhabitant in one year
to meet an extra trouble, and who doesn’t lose
heart even when the income-tax goes up to Is. 2d.
in the £, but the degenerate Briton at this end
can’t be expected to face a much smaller liability
in two years, and so on. The Bulletin says once
more that the Australian people, though they
may be a rather tired and indifferent race, have
courage enough to meet their responsibilities, and
it is only the cowardice of their rulers which
makes the trouble. The people may be too
tired to hunt for honest rulers, but if an
honest ruler turned up the cash support of the
people would not be wanting. Meanwhile, it
seems, when judged by the bill, that the “aid”
N.S.W. gave to the empire, and the “sacrifices”
it made for the empire, weren’t anything like large
enough to justify one-tenth of the shrieking,
guzzling and flag-flapping that were indulged in
oyer them. Also, that the large home-staying
Jingo who talked so much about these “sacri-
fices” and got so drunk on Mafeking Day, is
proving just the same melancholy public botch
that might have been expected, for he not
only hasn’t paid-up his alleged “sacrifices,” but
he holds that no fair minded man could expect
him to do so. And N.S.W. is still anxious to
know how the See Government is going to find
£350,000 or £lOO,OOO for Old-Age Pensions next
year and in every succeeding year, when it is so
utterly absurd to expect it to find £320,000 for
war and plague ex.’s this year.
On a burning N.S.W; Civil Service question :
Editor Bulletin,—The re-grading of the N.S.W.
Public Service has at last been gazetted with
but 12 days to spare. Another fortnight and
the votes covering the increments would have
lapsed. 3956 officers have been dealt with, and to
1274 have been granted increases (of £lO, mostly). The
Board’s conclusion that the other 2682 are not worthy
of such a magnificent increment as 16s. Bd. a month wiil
not materially raise them in the opinion of the 2682. A
significant feature of this re-grading is that the Board
seems to have dealt with each officer in the service and
not his office. It has been heretofore the Board’s boast
that each man is paid according to the value of the work
performed. Thus, if the P.M at Boolaroo or the Latids
Agent at Oow Mountain is a genius worth, say, £3OO a year,
and the work he can do in his out-of-the-wav corner is
only worth £2OO a year, £2OO is all that he can get, hut
the Board will see that he is transferred to a post where
his fine abilities will have full plav. This ingenious
theory blocked many appeals, the appellants being in
some cases greatly flattered at the Board’s implied recog-
nition that they were underpaid. But time has
gone by and no serious attempt seems to have been made
to satisfactorily establish these unfortunates. In the
present re-grading many instances can be cited where
officers have been placed in positions at a less salary than
that paid to their predecessors, which shows that the
Board considers other circumstances than the merit of an
office, irrespective of the holder. Public servants are
everywhere anxious for a definite reply to the query : Is
the billet or the billetee-graded-? Considering that the
Board is continually remodelling its own regulations, and
has not made up its mind how to run the service, it pro-
bably could not answer the question itself. The correct
reply seems to be that the Beard-grades the office or the
officer, just as it pleases, always provided that it hits on
the method by which the occupier is best “ done in.”

The Bulletin's tip for the N.S.W. State
election is : Vote for no candidate who is pledged
to either Lee or See. Don’t touch either Lee or
See with a long pole. Don’t be found dead in the
same street with either Lee or See. Vote for
Labor candidates, or independent candidates if
they seem to be really independent and have a
decent political and personal record. If there is
neither a Labour nor an Independent candidate
available, don’t vote at all. Lee is a part of the
old Reid Government and has the old Reid
gang around him. See and his crowd are the old
Lyne gang. Reid was a political leprosy, a curse,
a public disgrace ; in any decent community, after
his atrocious faking of the public accounts, and
his public bowl-out by the Auditor-General, in-
stead of being leader of the Federal Opposition
he would no longer have been politically tolerated.
Lyne followed in his footsteps; the best thing
that can be said for Lyne is that he was only a
follower. And now these two awful sets of
exposed individuals are exposing each other.

“The Favorite,” at Sydney Lyceum, is
likely to have a long run, as the good characters
are even stupider than usual, and there is also a
considerable amount of horse. The behaviour of
the equine characters on the opening night was
certainly curious; the horses that had merely to
trot on the stage with a peaceful carriage behind
them got excited and pawed at the tops of the
trees. The horse, however, that was hocussed in the
stable-scene took his pill in a Christian spirit, and
later on another horse won a great race with calm-
ness, appearing on the stage immediately after-
wards without a sign of hard running about him.
There is a good deal of poisoning and drugging in
the drama, and every now and then the villain
offers someone a glass which another person
immediately dashes to the ground in an obviously
intentional manner. The good people, however,
continue to accept things from the bad man in a
trustful spirit, the latter later on varying his
wickedness by conveying the poison in more solid
diet. It is a relief to the audience when the
aconitine chocolates given to the small boy are not
dashed to the ground but merely confiscated—so
many things have been more or less dashed by
this time that any change of method is acceptable.
As a set-off to these casual methods of murder the
villain concocts an elaborate scheme for destroying
the heroine in a picturesque manner in a cistern
on the top of a roof. The tank obligingly illumin-
ates and shows her floundering in the water like
an imprisoned gold-fish. She is rescued by the kind
policeman, aided by the larrikin boy who afterwards
turns out to be her own son. The audience is pre-
Eared to find this child of good birth owing to his
abit of praying to the stars and rebuking his pal
for sin.

Miss Eugenie Duggan, as the heroine,
seems a nice girl, but she has a curious fashion of
going out to drive in evening dress, and it is re-
markable that some of the ladies on the racecourse
also appear in this light costuming, though judging
by the heavy overcoats worn by the men onlookers
it is meant to be a cold day. H. O. Willard dis-
guises well as the villain who frequently leaves
his gentlemanly address to train thieves in a well-
staged London den, while Temple Harrison makes
a favorable impression as the bad big boy with the
“ good ’eart,” who is finally reformed by the good
small boy, who turns out to be a lost heir. On Satur-
day night Miss Kathleen Duggan irrupted on the
racecourse, and sang something rather sorrowfully,
while fat jockey-boys behind her capered about in
a fearful manner. There is only one girl in a hun-
dred that can afford to dress in jockey costume,
and the Lyceum does not seem to have caught
that one as yet.

tne unsolved problem of its success along with it.
Many people nave asked many other people why
they so greatly admire “Florodora,” and the
other people have mostly waved their hands in a
vague, flapping way, and said there was a some-
thing about it, you know—a kind of an atmo-
sphere in a manner of speaking—a feeling that
couldn’t be defined, but which somehow enveloped
you, as it might be, and other hazy remarks.

At Sydney Criterion the “ Milestones of
Life ” will to stand up like irregular teeth
along the beaten road of existence after Friday.
Saturday is to see the beginning of a revival of
“ The Power and the Glory.” Sydney has already
seen this piece, but looking back vaguely into a
memory where innumerable melodramas skurry
after each other like wet, disgusted ghosts, writer
can’t recollect for certain whether it is the melo-
drama where the good girl has her head put under
a steam hammer, or the one where she is left on
the rails for the train to go over her, or the one
where she is only suspected of something she
didn’t do and consequently has to make a pre-
carious living at plain sewing in an attic on a wet
night, or another one. As all melodramas are
pretty much the same melodrama, the chances are
that it isn’t another one.
** * *
“In the Soup ” progresses well at Sydney
Palace, and offers an interesting contrast in some
respects to “Nurse,” lately at the Royal, exemplify-
ing the man’s and the woman’s method of comedy-
writing, so far as the softer sex has progressed in
that art. Every now and then man rises in a body
and declares that women can’t do this or that,
upon which woman rises and does the thing she
couldn’t do—and frequently does it well. It
was alleged, f’rinstance, that the feminine mind
was not shaped for comedy-writing, whereupon
Clo Graves wrote “A Mother of Three,” achiev-
ing something like a success. But her prentice
hand is visible in “Nurse.” “Nurse” has better
lines than “ In the Soup,” and, as far as dialogue
goes, there is newness in much of its humor; prob-
ably it would read much better. ButthePalaceplay,
besides the advantage of better all-round acting,
shows the strength of the more experienced man
mind. All the available humor is squeezed out of
every situation, and every incident leads up to
something else. The third act, where all the men
want divorces because their respective wives went
to sleep over a dinner-table in the presence of
members of the opposite sex, is, of course, wildly
impossible, but a wild impossibility is of no im-
Eortance in the last act, when the mind has
ecome drugged with the improbabilities of two
previous acts. The art of comedy-writing is partly
the art of being humorous and partly the art of
being improbable probably, and of filling three
acts with possible impossibilities. And the person
who can only be improbable in an improbable
manner had better abandon comedy. It isn’t his
line of usefulness. Nature intended him to sell
stale fish to people with bad colds, or to follow
some of the cruder walks of deception.

Sydney Empire is brightened this week by
Charles Fanning, a comedian that Sydney has
probably seen before. Herr Pagel continues
getting through useless feats of strength, his per-
formance being occasionally of a painful charac-
ter. Something like this happens : Pagel lifts his
wife, who sits, with unavoidable want of grace, on
a heavy, round weight, which is raised higher and
higher by one hand, while the other gropes about
to catch hold of the other weight, which is sup-
posed to be lifted at the same time. The right hand
holding weight and lady is half raised, when she
slips and comes down on the stage. Another try,
and then there is another heavy fall—this time
right down on the boards. The lady jumps up
smiling, to prove (which is impossible) that she is
not at all hurt and rather enjoys being flung about
in this manner. Again she is lifted, when a sym-
pathetic galleryite calls out, “ Say, call this part
over ! ” But the feat is gone through. Herr
Pagel’s companion in misfortune retires to the
wings and Pagel rests, waits sadly for his next
feat, his ill-used muscles quivering painfully, his
melancholy face expressive of nothing but physi-
cal distress. The struggle for a crust 1

Snazelle’s show at the Queen’s Hall,
Sydney, draws excellent houses to the last, and
the audience amuses itself between whiles by cal-
culating what particular means is taken to pro-
duce each separate sound supposed to occur in the
pictures. The swishing of the sea round the
torpedo suggests the hissing of a gigantic sausage
in a frying-pan, but the biff when one tar hits
another is still unplaceable. Snazelle’s reci-
tation of the “Handy Man” is well done, and
as he mentions each good quality of that useful
gentleman—such as his love for children or for
work—an illustrated exemplification of the same
is immediately thrown upon the canvas. But
when Snazelle remarks that the handy man’s
heart is the heart of a lion that animal’s vital
organ doesn’t appear on the sheet, and this over-
sight is unlike Snazelle, who is generally so careful
about detail. Snazelle has added new pictures to
his “Navy” series, and his ships and funerals
will remain at their present address till Satur-
day. After that they open at Brisbane Opera
House on July 8.

and the diminutive Eric are really clever, but a
little kid goes a long way at a variety show, and
both the abovementioned kids are very small,
indeed. Will Daly, who used to sing in
a fine voice and make such horrible faces, is back
again. He doesn’t make such faces now, and is
considerably improved. The Brothers De Wynne
do some startling things in the acrobatic line;
most startling is where the light brother stands on
his head on the head of the heavy brother,
and the heavy brother wanders up and downstairs
with the light brother thus inverted. The Musi-
cal Tramp and the songful slavey and her little
bit of orange peel seem to be growing in popu-
larity.

Up to now, Melbourne has outlived the
season of Chinese opera at the Democratic Club
(of all places !), partly because there are no top
notes or choruses in the musical scheme, but
chiefly for the reason that admission, as a rule, is
limited to celestial Believers. In the original
Italian sense of the word, it is not opera that hap-
pens at the dingy Demo. Club room. The Chinese
have no art of vocalism, and only a limited system
of musical instrumental tune. The entertainment
aforesaid is drama, with an interminable orchestral
accompaniment and frequent interspersions of sing-
song, the difference between the sound of the
spoken dialogue and the incidental warble being
too subtle for European criticism. All the same,
the orchestra of five, who sit at the back of the
stage in plain Australian clothes and soft felt hats,
appear to punish their one-string fiddle, flageolet,
tom-toms, etc., with malice aforethought. When
the talk diverges into chant or ballad strains the
singer—every vocal effort is a solo, seemingly—
suits his wail to the accompaniment. He always
knows what noise is coming next. Nobody con-
cerned in the production ever needs prompting.
As an example of Chinese memory-culture the
show at the Demo, is at least respectable.
* * * *
The play had been moving along in a loose-
ointed, narrative way for about 20 nights of
hours each before The Bulletin was in a position
to solve the mystery of its weirdness, and sym-
pathise with the patient aliens who confronted
the trouble with their hats on. The audience, by
the way, expresses reverence for the drama of its
forefathers by brooding under the shade of its
“ cadey.” No Chinese theatrical classic is less
than a few thousand years old, therefore one pays
homage to the ancient literature by sitting hat-
headed in all parts of the house. Even the com-
bined stage-manager and scene-snifter, a casual
bloke in a fifty shilling sac-suit, who turns a chair
round, or introduces a pair of curtains on a brass
rod to signify, new and original scenery what time
the persistent play is still progressing favorably—
even this matter-of-fact interloper wears his mark
of respect on top of him. Probably the scene-
shifter and the orchestrians can follow the dialogue
more closely than their average compatriot in
front. It is spoken in Mandarin language,
which often soars above the education of
a low-down Loo from the fan-tan shop,
and would be impossible to the mummers if
they had not had stage experience in the country
where the shilling tea comes from. Chinese stage
experience teaches the tricks of female make-up
to perfection. The men cast for women parts are
quite convincing. The unhappy wife who got
sentenced to be chopped into 1000 pieces on the
uncorroborated statement of her step-mother-in-
law (vide 20th section of the play) was the fac-
simile of the typical charmer one finds on a
Eaper fan, except that the she-male face was
etter painted. The evil step-mother, with the
little black beauty-spots (representing moles) upon
his countenance, was every inch a woman, like-
wise the servant gal of the period. The beauty
spots of the European powered-wig period
were probably suggested by the bogus mole of
Chow drama. Also it appears that the betrayed
spinster in a Bland Holt fiction can show an
ancient precedent for letting down her back-hair.
It is the first law of mourning in Chinese female
life. Loose hair spells Woe even as the long
beard on the man signifies the authority of sexa-
genarianism. Chinese drama is unsullied by
argument re old-age pensions. The man of
years takes out a license to grow chin hair,
and becomes a domestic mandarin on the
strength of his constitution. He is one of
the Fittest because he hasn’t died earlier. Never-
theless the bad old girl with the black sticking-
plaster dotted o’er her countenance offers a
travelling assassin 500 dollars to remove the
bearded parent, and the deed would be done
easily enough but for the low comedian, who
listens outside the door when the crime is being
ordered, and ultimately slays the hired villain.
There is not a real door for the comic hero to listen
against. He just comes to the front of the stage,
wipes one hand across the other, like letter H in
the deaf-and-dumb alphabet, to signify his
presence at a keyhole, then puts one hand behind
nis ear and eavesdrops in an animated manner.
There is a certain pathos in the simplicity of this
make-believe.
• • * *
Chinese drama is, in some of its phases,
alleesame as Xmas panto., though its intentions are
strictly honorable and serious. Instead of a fairy
queen, a man walks upon the stage and alleges that
he is a heavenly person, who intends to punish the
guilty and straighten things out. The archangel
then instructs an evil spirit—a frog goblin of the
most advanced panto, manufacture —to go and
seize the evil step-mother’s only son, and take him
to the hell reserved for first offenders. Next time
the doomed young man takes the floor the goblin
humps him on his back by friendly arrangement,
as though he were lifting a sack of coals, and bears
him off. At 11.30 p.m. or later the moral lesson,
when it is a moral lesson, comes to an end. Some-
times it is a giddy lesson, with a four-poster
Chinese bedstead in the last act, but, anyhow, the
end arrives before midnight.

Arnold is prospering in the golden West
with his nimble narrative of Smith, the man
who Left Home. Crowded houses at Perth, and
every prospect of the same old luck at Kalgoorlie
and elsewhere. Smith’s departure from the do-
mestic roost will begin to explain itself in Mel-
bourne on Aug. 3rd, when Arnold and co. make
their first re-appearance at the Princess’s. Mean-
while, an amateur opera crowd is going to open
Musgrove’s theatre for a short season.

At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) the prima-donna,
or the tenor, or both, will continue to die melo-
diously every evening until further notice. True
love has a horribly bad time in grand opera. The
couple who duet with their faces close together in
the first act are invariably marked for earthly
separation before the band ceases to play. If they
don’t both perish, the sole survivor is left in-
sensible on the boards, a silent witness to the
foolishness of intense affection among the
higher singing classes. The baritone and basso
live to drag out a miserable repentance in almost
every case, and the contralto, or mezzo, usually
gets a chance to attend the funerals of her late
friends. But the soprano and the young man she
has been walking out with are as lilies of the field
waiting to be cut down and cast into the oven. It
is opera—but it is not fair dinkum. Which
remark would look more impressive in Italian
language.
** * *
The sad story of “ Ernani,” likewise the
hysterical tale of “Lucia” and the tombstone
tragedy of “Aida,” were each performed last
week, and an honest public certif. of merit was
awarded to the company every time. Melbourne
has been a cheerless city of cold, damp feet and
catarrh (various kinds of catarrh, and all of them
unmusical) for the past few weeks. Moreover the
local daily and weekly press notices of these Mel-
bourne record ventures in Italian opera have (with
exceptions) been about as cold and damp as
technical phraseology could make them. All the
same, a winter-stricken community rolls up to the
big house in large numbers and applauds with un-
common warmth. One night there was a change in
the “ Aida ” cast. Signora Sapio appeared as the
captive lady, and stood some three inches taller
and less massive than estimable Signora Bene-
detto in the same character. The story felt the
benefit of the change. The new heroine sang as
effectively as the first one, and her acting pleased.
A new Ethiopian father was introduced on this
occasion. Bozzoli played the part more vigorously
than was expected, and his bright young baritone
voice gave it an improved musical aspect. Ihe
chorus is getting ready for “ Cavalleria,’ 1 ag-
liacci ” and other things, but a chorus’s capacity
for study needs a lot of judicious shaking up. ahe
two short operas will probably be out this week.
** * *
“ His Natural Life,” with a Friday lapse
into “ Hamlet,” is filling the bill at Melbourne
Bijou. The present Dampierian treatment of
Marcus Clarke’s book inclines more to cheap
frivolity than some of the previous versions, al-
though Gabbett and the triangles are frequently
on the surface, and the dramatic hash has a strong
savor of blud. Sarah Rex and Rev. Meekin
gambol together for the amusement of the loud,
unthinking cherubs who sit up aloft and chew pea-
nuts. Whereas the real original Meekin of Clarke’s
story ought to have been foolish enough for
any low comedian’s purpose, the inane shepherd
whom Sarah tickles under the chin seems a poor
joke all the time, and when Maurice Frere is
dragged into the funny business for the sake of a
gallery laugh, Meekin amounts to a dramatic sin.
One rather redeeming circumstance in “His
Natural Life ” is the quick, decisive climax which
brings the curtain down. John Rex administers a
fatal whack to Frere’s skull with his iron bracelets,
and the convicts who ate the Moocher in the
wilderness are able to gloat over their oppressor’s
corpse before they get hanged. Alfred Dampier,
as of yore, plays the troubled alcoholic chaplain,
and sacrifices many precious drops of whisky to
save his martyr brother Rufus. Alfred Rolfe is a
respectable Rufus, and the venerable E. Holloway
resumes his entertaining character of Gabbett, the
cannibal. Some of the remaining performers
deserve to be mentioned in terms of severe reproof,
but take it all together, “His Natural Life” is a
well set-up show.

At the Royal all goes well with the
gorgeous scenery and human fittings of “In
London Town.” The blind man has abated
nothing of his badness, and the credulity of Baker,
the millionaire, is as fresh as before. Also Albert
Norman continues to get pushed off the roof with
great success, after the sightless sinner aforesaid
nas received a violent inducement to fall down-
stairs. Some of the stairs had been removed
by the lodgers for firewood purposes, but these
§aps in the structure don’t appear to make any
ifference to the falling body. The audience can
hear blind Norrie bumping on his way, and they
seem glad to think that he probably lies dead on the
bottom stair. “In London Town” is full of
movement. In the second act Bland Holt and
Brown—Brown of the sore voice and capacious
smile—go through a form of harlequinade. Bland
chases Brown through a series of pantomimic
obstacles, but the fugitive ultimately escapes by
falling into a gigantic flour-bin. This happens in
the home of a struggling factory-girl, who stores
her kitchen flour by the half-ton.

At the Opera House an alleged barn dance,
by the Dartos, is the latest attraction. Melbourne
has exhausted all its surprise concerning those
tour-de-force artists, and their recent efforts to
revive enthusiasm have been painfully fruitless.
The barn dance, as performed on Saturday,
was the saddest of endeavours. It merely
gave one to suppose that the dancing
ability of the Dartos begins and ends
in acrobatics. Finally the gentleman Dartos
picked up the lady Dartos and carried her off the
stage with her head downwards and her shapely
little legs extended like the arms of an opera
singer. But even this desperate novelty failed to
excite the audience. The pair of French Gartos
will appear until further notice.

The Cobar Chesney mine, Cobar, have lately
placed an order with the Austral Otis Engineering Com-
pany for a pair of powerful winding engines to haul from
2000 feet. These engines are rapidly approaching com-

From a Dunedin correspondent:—M.L. dredg-
ing still languishes, owing to mismanagement. The slump
is intensified on account of abnormally high rivers,
which drive down silt and at the same time prevent
dredges from bottoming. The best returns are usually
got in the early winter, when frost sets in and snow is
held on the ranges. Consequently river falls and dredges
get on to their best ground. So far this winter has
been very mild, and the only perceptible “frost” is on
scrip lists. At time of writing the Molyneux and Ka-
warau Rivers are varying from 20 to 30ft. above normal,
and all dredging is at a standstill. Some dredges
are being washed away, and it is only with great
difficulty that dredges are held to moorings ; some have
actually sunk. Unless rivers fall and permit new dredges
to get going and brighten things up, there will be a
bigger slump than ever.

In view of the fact that the finances of New
South Wales are growing more and more chaotic, and
that State has not only the biggest deficit in Australasia,
but one which more than equals all the other deficits put
together, The Bulletin desires to offer its particular plan
for getting rid of the trouble. Which is this:
(1) First of all, face the ghastly situation. Issue suffi-
cient 3 per cent, stock to put the Civil Service Superan-
nuation Fund and Police Superannuation Fund on an
absolutely solvent footing this will require about
£2,000,000. (The Civil Service Superannuation Fund is
insolvent because various Governments took the civil
servants’ money—their own contributions —for wrong-
ful purposes, and the State must settle this up.)
Issue sufficient 3 per cent, stock to pay off the
shortage in the Martin Place and Centennial Park
suspense accounts (about £528,000) ; to pay the war and
plague and celebration expenses (about £473,628); put all
of these and the present year’s deficit, if any, and the un-
paid year’s interest on the Sydney land resumptions into
the deficit also, and cover them by the issue of 3 per cent,
stock. Then transfer £500,000 of the ordinary public debt
to the deficit, as a counterbalance to the £500,000 or so of
each year’s expenditure which is left unpaid under the
Cash Basis Fraud.
(2) This will show the deficit at probably about
£5,700,000, which is just what it really is.
(3) Having repaid (in Government securities, anyhow)
every penny that has been borrowed from the Trust
Funds, let it be enacted that all the Trust Funds shall
hereafter be invested in Govt, securities (of N.S.W. or
other States) only, and that none of them shall be bor-
rowed for revenue purposes or other temporary expedi-
ents. Place them in charge of a committee, including
the Auditor-General and certain other carefully-selected
officials, who shall be wholly responsible for their invest-
ment, and put them wholly out of the Treasurer’s reach.
(4) Any moneys realised hereafter by the sale of Cen-
tennial Park or Martin Place building sites to be paid
over to the Auditor-General, and applied towards the re-
demption of the Treasury Bills issued to cover the
deficiency.
(5) Any surplus that may remain when the Civil Ser-
vice Superannuation fund finally' closes up many years
hence to I e similarly applied.
(6) All surpluses (there hasn’t been a genuine surplus
in N.S W. for 15 years or more, but there may be one
some da.y) to be similarly applied.
(7) The present pa.vment of £150,000 a year out of
revenue towards the deficit to be abolished —the money
will all be wanted for old age pensions, &c. But the land-
tax to be doubled, and the whole proceeds of the land-tax
(which would then be about £500,000 a year) to be paid
directly to the Auditor-General, and used in the redemp-
tion of the Treasury Bills issued against the deficit as
above-mentioned, none of the land-tax revenue going into
the hands of the Treasurer at all, or being included in the
revenue in anv shape or form. This process to continue
till the existing deficit, and any further deficits, are
wholly extinguished. As this process will leave the
State with insufficient revenue, the income-tax must be
largely increased, probably to Is. 3d. in the £, and new
taxes imposed. .
Tiie Bulletin recommends this, or some similar device,
as the only' means of shifting the incubus. No amount of
indignant inquiry as to how the great shortage arose, or
denunciation of its authors, or throwing out the Govern-
ments which did the sin, will pay a penny of it. The
deficit has been indignantly denounced and lectured upon
and held up to obloquy for 16 dreadful years, but it has
grown bigger all the time. Everything has been done to
it except the one essential —it hasn’t been paid not a,
penny of it. The only thing that can shift it is MONEY.
Let us get MONEY and shift it bodily.

The earnings are at the rate of £5 12s. lid. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ funds as at the beginning of
the half-year (capital,’£ls2,o4o ; reserves, £26,958 ; total,
£178,998). The rate is good enough, yet as compared
with May, 1900, there is a very material falling away.
Judging by the State revenue returns, Tasmania’s recent
little boom is pegging out, and this is probably one of
the results. Business has apparently been about sta-
tionary during the half-year. Deposits have decreased
by about £4OO ; note circulation by about £2OO ; profits,
as shown above, are £4lO less. The cash reserve stands
at £99,299, which is £23,000 less than it was six months
ago, and represents about 19 per cent, on all liabilities to
the public—not a very large amount, but probably suffi-
cient for all ordinary purposes. The National Bank of
Tasmania is a small concern of good repute, but its re-
serves are not very strong 1 , and though it is doing much
better than it did four years ago its progress is not very
rapid even now. An addition of barely £4OOO to the re-
serves in six years can hardly be called fast travelling.

Some figures and facts concerning Maoriland
State Life Insurance Department:
The life insurance fund now stands at £3,139,957 ; and
there is also a tontine fund of £20,826, and investment
fluctuation reserve of £36,297. So the Maoriland Govern-
ment Life Department still holds its place as the second
largest of Australasian life assurance institutions, only
the A.M.P. being in front of it. It also continues to keep
its place as the most cheaply-managed of Australasian
life offices, the A.M.P. only excepted. During the last
nine years its results in this direction have been as
follows :
Expenses in Proportion to Total Income.
1892 .. £l5 7 7 per cent. 1897 .. £l4 17 2 per cent.
1893 .. 14 19 0 „ 1898 .. 14 6 9 „
1894 .. 15 1 7 „ 1899 .. 14 2 11 „
1895 .. 13 1 5 ~ 1900 .. 14 9 11 „
1896 .. 14 18 7 „ I
The last year hasn’t been quite so good as the one imme-
diately preceeding, but still the Maoriland State Depart-
ment'holds the highest place, bar one, for economy of
management.
The fall in interest rates still continues. Last
year the Maoriland State Life Insurance Department
earned £4 9s. 3d. per cent, on its average funds, which
compares with some previous interest earnings as follows:
1892 .. £5 6 2 per cent. 1897 .. £4 16 7 per cent.
1893 ..5 5 2 „ 1898 .. 4 14 0 „
1894 .. 5 6 0 „ 1899 .. 4 11 1 »
1895 .. 5 2 2 „ 1900 .. 4 9 3 „
1896 .. 4 19 0 „
The interest earnings are thus Is. lOd. per cent, less than
they were in 1899, as compared with the A.M.P.’s drop of
2s. 3d. per cent. The Maoriland State Department has
always been at a disadvantage in the matter of interest
earnings as compared with most Australian offices, for it
keeps a much larger proportion of its funds in Govern-
ment and municipal securities, and a smaller proportion
in mortgages, and thus, to some extent, sacrifices interest
for the sake of security. But on the other hand it hasn’t
been struck by the slump as the Australian offices have.
For instance, the Insurance and Banking Record, in 1891
and in 1900, showed the interest earnings of the leading
Australasian life offices as follows :

The Maoriland Government Life Office’s assets stood the
shock of bad times better than all the others. In 1891 its
interest earnings were the poorest of the lot, and it was
the last in a list of nine. In 1900 it stood third on the
list of nine, only the National Mutual and A.M.P. being
ahead of it, while six offices that were far ahead of it in
4891 are now behind it—the Alliance, Colonial Mutual,
and Victoria so far behind as to be practically out of
sight.
The Government institution is also at a serious
disadvantage in the matter of expenses, for its business
is confined to Maoriland, where direct taxation —the only
kind that strikes a life office—is almost twice as heavy as
the Australian average. Its expenses also form a heavier
per centage by reason of the lowness of its premiums,
which are about the most moderate in Australasia.
Under all these conditions it can fairly claim to be the
most successful of Australasian life offices, even if it didn’t
throw in (as it does) a State guarantee for the payment of
all policies. Its assets look distinctly better than the
average. Out of over £3,100,000 of assets, foreclosed pro-
perties stand for less than £5600. Less than half the
money is invested in mortgages, and the balance is mostly
loans on policies and State securities. Overdue interest
is almost nil, and these are all features which speak well
for the soundness of the investments.

The Liverpool and London and Globe Insur-
ance Co., which does a large fire business and a certain
amount of life business at this end of the globe, shows
these results in its life and annuity department:

The total life and annuity funds of the Liverpool and
London and Globe are now £5,472,078 (life fund,
£3,778,121; and annuity fund, £1,693,957). In addition
to these funds there is a paid-up capital of £245,640 ; a
general reserve fund of £1,300,000; investment fluctua-
tion fund of £208,003 ; and undivided profits amounting
to £1,076,999, so the reserves available for the protei tion
of policy-holders may be set down at over £2,800,000, in
addition to the assurance fund which, in itself, is sufficient
to cover all liabilities under policies. This means an
enormous amount of security, and it is the only point on
which a first-class proprietary life office can claim to be
better than a mutual one. The mutual office never sets
itself to accumulate a general reserve, apart from its
assurance fund and reserve for depreciation of securities.
It is difficult to know why it shouldn’t, but it doesn’t.
Unfortunately the Australasian proprietary life offices
now in active business are not at all like the L. and L.
and G. in this respect.
The Liverpool and London and Globe doesn’t
push much for new life business, and its progress
isn’t rapid. Through not hustling for much new business
its expenses are very small —£5 os. Id. per cent, on total
income, a rate that even the A.M.P. can’t approach. In-
terest earned is about £3 13s. per cent, on the average
amount of the assurance and annuity fund for the year,
which is good enough according to British rates, though
far below the Australian average. The L. and L. and
G. is a most undeniably safe concern for assurers, and its
bonuses are remarkably good, though it doesn’t get
alongside the A.M.P. in this respect. Still it would be a
great deal more joyful to be the heir of a large original
shareholder in the L. and L. and G. than to be insured in
it. The dividend for last year was 90 per cent.

If the stories current ’concerning the merits of
that Sydney ship-broking dispute are anything like true,
what a pity, in the public interest, that the matter was
not ventilated in the law-courts, instead of being squared
privately. , « *
Wyalong (N.S.W.) municipal council has had
enough of law-fighting with the local mines over the right
basis for taxation ; but the Broken Hill Council, all but
two Laborites, keeps the lawyers fed. Last year it spent
£lOOO without getting the main question touched at all ;
this year it has put £5OOO down on the estimates—at
least half of its total revenue 1 Why doesn’t the State
Parliament pass a law defining the position ? The pre-
sent uncertainty has lasted for years.
» * * *
This year, so far, 16 men have been killed in
Broken Hill mines—proportionately a far greater number
than during ’OO. It may be only a coincidence that since
the beginning of this year only one mining inspector has
been employed instead of two; and even that one has
had no previous experience of big workings. And yet, in
view of the lead-slump and consequent economies, State
supervision in the working’ miners’ interests has been
particularly desirable lately.
At their wits’ ends to make exes, at present
metal-prices, the Broken Hill co.’s are arranging to ask
for reduced freights on ore products over the S.A. rail-
ways. While they are about it they might ask for a yet
bigger reduction from the Silverton Tram Co., which still
makes its 40 or 50 per cent, a year.
* * *
If a buyer can be got for the Broken Hill Junc-
tion in England, it will most likely go that way; the
directors don’t yet see any other plan for netting the
necessary capital to re-open the mine. The likeliest
buyers are people interested in zinc-extraction.

To inquire into the Broken Hill South mining
disaster Crown-Prosecutor C. J. Wade has been appointed
a Royal Commissioner. And Barrier miners remember
that Judge Murray, sent on an almost precisely similar
errand three years ago, reported that the N.S.W. mining
regulations were thoroughly rotten and insufficient to
protect the workmen in any mine (Judge Murray’s
italics). That was three years ago, and the same regula-
tions still remain ! But the inquiry did something—it
stopped grumbling for a while. By the way, it is just
about three years since the last N.S.W. general election.

To help along the smelter, a complete and up-to-
date concentrating plant is being put up at Lloyd’s
copper-mine, Burraga, out from Bathurst. Broken Hill
experience is being made use of.
* * • *
Mt. Boppy: Some 20 miles from Cobar, now
running a 40-head stamp mill which came from Gally-
mont mine, one of the failures of the Anglo-Australian
Co. There is every reason to think that the co. has at
last found a good mine in Mt. Boppy. Three shafts sunk
on the lode, extending over an area of 1000 ft. Levels put
out at the 100 and 200 ft. Lode (quartz) runs from 6 to
14ft. thick, averaging about 10ft; gold fine, but free mill-
ing. Returns not given. Gold contents of ore believed
to be about 14dwt. per ton, and understood that half-an-
oz. is got by amalgamation and cyaniding, balance being
in the slimes, of which the ore makes about 25 per cent.,
and for the treatment of which filter-pressing plant has
been decided on.
* * * »
The Commonwealth : A mine eight miles from
Wellington, N.S.W. Said to be a promising concern. 200
tons sent to Dapto and averaged loz. 15dwt. of gold with
an excellent percentage of silver. A few tons sent to
Cockle Creek averaged loz. 17dwt. gold, and 22ozs.
silver. Said of it, the greater the depth the greater the
richness, but then that is said of all N.S.W. mines. Let
us hope it is true of the Commonwealth.
* * * *
North Cobar, N.S.W. : The prospecting shaft
is down 300 ft. It is being sunk much further to the
west than any previous prospecting work, as it is under-
stood that the last run of ore worked in Great Cobar
copper-mine is pitching away in the direction of this
prospecting shaft. Occasional seams of quartz, stained
with copper and iron, are met' with, but no opening-out
will be done till the shaft is down 300 ft. The North
Cobar is a big gamble, but it may be well worth the
trouble.
* * * *
Mt. Drysdale, N.S.W. : Mill shut down for
want of water, and although there is said to be plenty
ore that would pay for local treatment, it will not stand
heavy haulage and smelting charges. Main shaft going
down another 100 ft. Mine now much better equipped,
and it is intended to cut down the main shaft, making it
a decent size.
* * * *
North Bushy Hill, N.S.W. “ The shares which
a fortnight ago were forced up to the fictitious value of
over 205., were yesterday quitted at 4s.”—which is an un-
usually forcible phrase for Sydney D.T’s mining columns.
A well-known mining man, just returned from the
locality, says certain Bushy Hill shows are the latest
exhibitions of N.S.W. mining folly, and give an example
of the ignorance of some people working there. They
asked his opinion of the metal they were obtaining from
pestle and mortar tests of a hard white quartz, and were
much surprised to learn that which they thought was
silver or something equally valuable, was iron filings
broken away from the pestle and mortar in pounding
the quartz.

“A Crippled Industry:” “Sydney Sunday
Times will next week initiate a campaign having for its
object the relief of the mining industry in respect of the
many injustices under which it labors. The attention of
persons interested in the industry is directed to this
matter, and information and expressions of opinion are
invited from them.” Writer suggests the publication in
the Sunday Times of an alphabetical list of all the mines
the purchase of shares in which has been frequently ad-
vised by its own Sabbath tipster, and which have since
passed into liquidation or oblivion without returning any
of the money wasted on them, to say nothing of the
amount of money lost in share-dealing. That is one of
the many injustices under which N.S.W. mining has
labored, and it has done as much to bring about a “crip-
pled industry” as anything this scribe knows of.
Croesus Proprietary, W.A.: “Latest assays
ranged between lOdwt. and 3oz. All the development
work is carried out by hand, so progress is slow. The
installation of air-drills would much hurry matters, and,
with very little trouble, a supply of air could be got from
the recently-erected compressor at Hannan’s Croesus
mine.” All the Croesus Proprietary wants is more gold.
Newspapers supply all the wind it needs.
* • » *
Croesus South: “ Extensive development work
is being done on the oxidised zone, with improved results.
Lode averaging 3 to Bft., and worth by battery treatment
BJdwt. per ton.” How does this correspond with the
official cable sent to London a few weeks ago“ 2250
tons milled for 3030 z. Expenses, £2OOO. Shutting down.”
The ore in the Croesus is so poor that the mine might be
more appropriately called the Lazarus.
Hannan’s Brownhill: “The diamond drill is
still operating from the True Blue lease, and another drill
is now at work on the Jubilee lease. Although no
particulars are obtainable the management slates that
recently the development has been very satisfactory and
there are no fears of supplies of ore running short. The
Diehl plant is running smoothly and is reported to be
securing a good extraction at a fairly low cost.” No par-
ticulars are available of the amount of drilling-work al-
ready done, probably some thousands of feet. If any-
thing had been struck it would have leaked out.
This mine has been getting 5000 oz. a month, worth
£lB,OOO, with a local cost of over £lO,OOO. Shares
have started to come down. A few weeks ago they were
over 905.; as this is written they are well under 80s., and
but for the number oversold they would be under 60s.
The days of the mine are numbered. Its ore is running
out. Kalgoorlie Sun devotes 3 cols, to an exposure of the
ways in which the B.H. shareholders have been hood-
winked.
* * * *
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.): Producing over 5000 oz.
a month, and has been working a long time without div.
Said to be the best low-grade proposition in W.A., having
a formation that will probably live to any depth. Work-
ing two lodes, A and B, the latter probably a slice or
lense from the main lode, but both in the same channel,
each having an underlay as regular as a clock of about
45deg. The mine will probably be working when a lot of
others out there are forgotten. Has a fine battery and
cyanide plant, stacking the slimes ; a big lOdwt. show ;
development a little behind, but the mine will soon get
ahead with that.
• ■* * •
Cosmopolitan (W. A.): Main lode averages 7ft.
thick and worked 990 ft. long ; in the bottom level, 400 ft.
Not too much ore opened up considering the equipment
going on. There is said to be a fault in the south drive
which, if it continues, might upset calculations re the
deeper levels. Putting up a new 50-stamp mill.

Lake View and Boulder Junction: “A recon-
struction of the co. is imminent, and until some satis-
factory arrangements are arrived at, no work will be car-
ried out on the property.” But why reconstruct a proved
duffer ? It was so named to lead people to think that the
Lake View and Boulder lodes would junction in it. They
never did, and never will.
• » * »
Berry Consols Extended (Vic.): For the half-year
42940 z., realising £18,387, out of which £2OOO paid in
divs. The reason why : board-fees, £32 10s. ; salaries,
£lO4 ; visiting-fees and travelling expenses, £26. If the
mine had a London office it would take more than £2OOO
to run it.
• * * *
Glenfine South : Adelaide Critic avers that
“ Glenfine South is not going to snuff out, in spite of the
directors and the wreckers.” Some people would be
thankful if the Critic had not boomed these shares by
saying they were going to double in value when they
were nearly four times present price, and followed them
all down the line, blaming everything and everybody but
the mine itself, when it had palpably gone wrong. Noth-
ing short of the marvellous can put the mine back into
the position it occupied last year. It has a magnificent
reef in one level, the run of gold in which has been mostly
gutted, but the reef does not go down in size or quality.
The public has gone down instead.
* * •
Clrillagoe Mines : Shares suffered a “knock-
out ” last week when they fell from 21s. to 16s. They
have recovered, say 25., since and it is given out that the
directors, to re-establish public confidence, and in “ con-
sequence of rumors ” are to personally examine the
property. Adelaide Critic, which has always been over-
fond of booming Chillagoes, says there is no reason for the
decline, that the first smelting will be a good one. The
Bulletin says there are many substantial reasons for the
knock-out, and would not be surprised to soon see the
shares down to 10s. Here are a few reasons. The de-
parture for China of the £5OOO-a-year manager Stewart so
soon after his return from England. The uncertainty of
his ever coming back. The fact that the railway has taken
nearly double the estimated time to build and that it has
probably cost far more than was expected. The delay in
the erection of the smelters, and, above all, the colorless
official reports dealing with mine-developments. The
formations are lateral, mostly in limestone, spread over
too large an area of country with no proved depth, and so
far removed from the sea-board as to make their working
expensive. An enormous amount of money has already
gone into the undertaking (ominous word !), and much
more must follow before it produces copper. The better
policy would have been to spend, say, £lOO,OOO in
prospecting and developing the property before building
a railway and erecting furnaces for mines', the permanency
of which has not been established.

Ihe one episode which, so far, has really
brightened up the Duke of York’s dreary path
hereabouts happened in serious-minded Maori-
-1 and, of all places in this world. Seddon’s two
islands laid themselves out for a stupendous grovel,
and were fully resolved to make such an exhibition
of themselves as Mr. and Mrs. York would never
forget. And at Wellington things broke down. A
big review was held in the mud of a wet and
bitter day, and after it was over the army got
mislaid. The officers were so busy following the
Duke back to Wellington and letting him see
their beautiful clothes, that they forgot they ever
had an army. It was left standing in a paddock,
up to its knees or thereabouts in mud, and
wondering what to do next. Nobody told
it what to do next. Night came on, and the lost
legion was still prowling about in a cold, boggy
camp, with no food for itself or for its joint and
several horse. In the end, a large section of the
indignant and neglected force girded up its empty
stomach and walked into town to see if it could
get a bun or something, and there also it found
nothing provided and nobody responsible.
Therefore it came to pass that the military
forces of Maoriland, 1)00 strong, proceshed the
streets of Wellington carrying lumps of bad meat
(presumably borrowed from friendly butchers) on
poles and explaining things’; and sang the “Dead
March outside Government House, where York
was holding a levee, and practically shook their
mouldy beef and their grievances in the face of
the Heir Apparent. Of course, the Duke became
aware that Maoriland’s mislaid and unfed army
was outsjde and going on in a quite unusual
fashion. There was a sudden waking up in
high military circles. The road out to the camp
was almost blocked by the forgotten provisions
rushing out in the dead of night. An apoplectic
commander and a whole staff of officers came after
the provisions, and when the commander had used
terrible language to his subordinates, he had the
men paraded and talked to them as if he was John
Norton’s Open Letter to the Apostle Paul. Then
he demanded the names of the ringleaders, and
the men, cheered-up by the provisions that had
arrived in the night, simply howled with laughter
and asked him, almost in so many words, where
he got that hat.
A large blot has thus fallen on Maori-
land’s li itional grovel. York will always
remember it as t:ie only place where he
was sung to by a mislaid military force carry-
ing decayed sausages and bullock’s liver on
poles. He can never again take quite seriously a
commander who fo'rgot his army, and found it
during the night wandering round in disorder
trying to borrow food. The rest of the Yorks’
visit will be one long struggle to look sei'ious at
military functions, and not to laugh at gorgeous
creatures in epaulettes. The tale of the troops
whose officers lost them in a mud-hole in a time of
profound peace, through their anxiety to show the
Duke their nice clothes, will go round the British
papers, and the Agent-General will probably lose
his head, and write denying it, and fall in. Taking
it all round, it is about the worst tiling that has
happened to people of intense dignity since the
last time a king fell over a forgotten coal-scuttle
on the stairs. •
If Maoriland was only a member of the Com-
monwealth, so that its military affairs came under
the notice of the Federal Parliament, what a
thrilling spectacle it would be to find King
O’Malley rising to ask something like this :
(1) Is there any other part of the Empire where the
present Heir Apparenthas been tumultuously approached
by his father’s troops carrying decayed meat ?
(2) Will the Government appoint a Commission to look
up British history and find out if decayed meat was ever
•previously brought under the notice of the Royal Family
in like manner ?
(3) Does the Government regard the incident as high
treason or merely as calculated to injure the trade in
frozen mutton ?

Postmaster-General Ward and ex-Lands-
Minister M’Kenzie of Maoriland have been
knighted. Two more little baubles from George
of York’s small bagful of degradations! Hall-
Jones, Minister of Works, wasn’t knighted, and
isn’t likely to be. The hyphenated Jones, who
was commonly supposed to be a mild and humble
man, was requested to leave his rooms at a hotel
to make more space for the ducal party, and his
refusal made Seddon so angry that Jones was re-
quested either to leave the hotel or leave the
Ministry. It isn’t yet known which of the two
Jones left, but if he refused to leave either, and
had to be carried out, it would be a very interest-
ing situation. There was a time in N.9.W. when
a mild Premier named Jennings tried to eject a
long, bony and indignant subordinate named Dibbs
out of a Ministry. The result was that they both
got out, but Jennings was out first.

The refusal of the Maoriland Minister for
Works to give up his bunk in a Wellington pub.
for the use of the Duljeanduchess has, despite its
inexpressible brutality, a somewhat refreshing
side. Every other Minister with whom their
Highnesses have come into contact would have
been passionately pleased to give up his little back
room to them and'go and roost in the ti-tree with
the hens.

According to Sydney Mail’s photographs

The big bazaar organised by the elite of
Wellington (M.L.) in aid of the proposed Victoria

Sydn ’s Public Library has been falling
to pieces mo e or less for years, and
it is so crimped that when Mr.
Mitchell offered the authorities a
present of 15,000 valu-
able volua.es, with"
many more to f 1 ow,
tney could only accept
10,000, and even these
had to be stacked out of
sigl t in the librarian’s resi-
dence. The Public Library
question is a curious instance
of how a bg matter moulders
and petrifies, until the inten-
tion to do something about it
becomes a sort of heirloOm,
like an Egyptian pyramid.
In 1879 £150,000 was voted for
a new Sydney Public Library,
and plans were prepared, in
1880 a site was purchased on
which to build the new Library.
In 1881 Parliament selected a
new site. In 1882 Parkes
proposed another new site,
waere the Benevolent
Asylum now stands. In
1883 still another site
was chosen, and more
plans prepared. In
1884, part of the old
crowded establishment
was rebuilt to prevent
it falling down (cost
£12.247). in 1887 another
part of the old wreck was
patched up (cost £10,455). And
then the question dropped dead,
and the money that should have
built the library went in cohentingents,
and somebody lit his pipe with the plans.
Melbourne Free L ading Library lately
spiiiicated” tiie private libraries by adding to
its store examples of D Auuunzio, Maeterlinck,
Maupassant, Daudot, Pierre Loti, duderman,
W. B. Yeats, Arthur Symons and George Moore.
The virtuous trustees, however, banished “Bel
Ami,” “Sapho,” “Tie Child of Pleasure,”
‘‘Evelyn Innes ”and “ Salnmmbo.” “ BebAmi,”
indeed, remained on the shelves a week or two,
until quietly removed “ by order of the trustees.”
The “Dead City” is still in, because they have
never read it ; so the welfare of the institution
depends on the ignorance of the trustees. The
outlook is hopeful.

The comp, was setting up the words
“country newspaper” and lie made it “news-
pauper.” Many a true word, &c.
1 here landed in Sydney a few days ago a
young man with two children. He was penni-
less, and a highly improbable
tale was his only visible
asset. Over in Westralia he
determined to try his luck
Eik. Hearing of l.is de-
part ire, a woman whom he
had km wn for a h ire we. k,
and whose name he was not
too sure of, asked him to
escort two children to Syd-
ney, where they were to be
met by relatives and foi-
warded to Maorilaiid. Being
short of cash, the mother
could only jay the.r fares
to Adelaide, but a brother,
or someone else belonging to
her, was to meat the boat
thete and buy meets on to
Sydney. The trust n , \ o Mb— for
he is not muc.i o e t at took on
this extensive contract. At Ade-
laide he met his first shock ; the
brother didn’t mater.a i ;e. It ex-
hausted his own slender resources
to convey his charges to Sydney—
where again no relatives turned up.
His yarn was so wildly improbable
thattiie various charities of Sydney
scornfully chased him off their res-
pective doorsteps. The police o ily
smiled a cold, incredulous smile,
and when he declared he would
have to drop the two children in
the street, they threatened him
with arrest for deserting his family.
A wire to W.A. brought no reply.
In despair he persuaded someone
to cable to an Auckland address
which he remembered receiving

S.M. Herald cross heads as “an histori-
cal coincidence ” the reference made by a M.L
Mayor, in welcoming the Yorks, to the fact “ that
the Yorks landing at Wellington occurred on the
anniversary of Waterloo. ” These historical coin-
cidences are really remarkable. Writer landed
in Australia outlie anniversary of the Massacre of
Glencoe, and lie knows a friend whose fifth child
was born on the anniversary of the Battle of Sem-
pach. Come to think of it, almost anybody goes
somewhere or does something on the day that
something or other happened some time or other.

MUTINY.
When the Jook was being- entertained at Government
House, Wellington (M.L.), last week, 900 local troops,
mostly volunteers, were laagered outside the town in a
lagoon of liquid mud. They were without orders, with-
out officers (their officers were clinking their spurs in the
corridors of Government House), without forage for their
horses, and without fo.od for themselves—except some--
baleful bullock-meat, which they refused to touch. They
were left there to stand up all night or lie down in the
mud. They did neither; but organised a procession,
heralded by pieces of deceased bullock carried on poles,
and, stopping before Government House, played the
“ Dead March ” for the edification of the Jook. Next
morning the commandant, Colonel Pole-Penton, rode out
to the camp in a lather'of fury and called them “ infernal
curs and cowards, who had disgraced their country.”
Lo, this bold yeomanry, its country’s pride
its country s shame unless with food supplied.
Their kin heroic upon Orange veldt,
And Transvaal kopje made their valor felt,
And rode red-spurred into the fiercest fray.
Un half a biscuit to a man per day ;
And slept at night in beds of liquid mud,
And in the morning blithely bathed in blood ;
And broke their hearts to show, in squalid strife,
their loyalty was more to them than life.
T pon their land their deeds a glory shed
i hey crowned her with a halo bloody-red.
m? a^as " was their spilth of gore—
iheir kinsmen have disgraced her evermore.
Pole-Penton well might call them cur and hound
Who could not camp one night on sodden ground,
Ivor eat sick bullock’s corpse, once in a way,
1 heir love for dear old England to display.
But they must go with green meat on a hook,
And play the “Dead March” to the tremblings
Dook.
That Dead March direful—was it meant to be
Eor the dead bullock, or for Koyalty ?

Premier Peacock expected to be in hot
water in his new Leg. Assembly Chamber in
Melbourne Exhibition, but the hot water was not
turned on, and a wintry blast surged through the
room, giving to the setting a ghastly suggestive-
ness of the morgue, with all the legislators as sub-
jects lying on ice. It was the most frost-bitten,
chilblained, cold-blasted Parliament that ever sat
in Australia ; the only sound heard in the chamber
for five minutes at a stretch was the helpless chat-
tering of 50 sets of human teeth. Members
wrapped themselves in floor-rugs and table-cloths
and sat like galvanised mummies. A few unsuc-
cessfully tried to make fire-water a substitute for
the promised hot water, and the spectacle of one
refrigerated member struggling to repress the
chattering of a double-barrelled set of porcelain
teeth with spring fittings, and prevent them
dancing out on to the floor, whilst expressing his
disgust with a Cabinet that didn’t know enough to
come in out of the cold, was a most touching thing
to see.

The migration of Vic. State Parliament to
Melb. Exhibition Building has thrown experienced
and habitual M’s.P. very much out of their rec-
koning. Most of them could find their way to the
old House even if blind, and occasionally one or
two of them did. But instinct is no guide now,
and a resident in Nicholson-st. furiously complains
that he has been knocked up twice by belated
gentlemen who want to (hie !) know if “thish ish
the Victoriannousher Parliament.” In the dark
and early hours of a.m. following the first sitting
of State Parliament this session, a watchman, dis-
turbed by a far-off, mysterious knocking, traced
the sounds to the great entrance facing Nicholson-
st., and found a bedraggled politician pounding
wearily at the big door with his knuckles. He
said he’d been looking for the House all night,
and refused to go away without a royal commission
or something. He was left knocking.

Gov.-Gen. Hopetoun turned on a full head
of gush at the Parliamentary dinner in Melbourne
t’other day. Opening his arms, he took Australia
to his bosom, crying with an affecting little break
away down behind his larynx :
Gentlemen, I love Australia. (Oheers.) I have given
the best years of my life to one of the greatest of her
States. I also love the man in the street. (Hear, hear.)
I love his wonderful orderliness and his good nature,
especially when he is collected together in large crowds
such as we h ive seen him collected of late. I admire and
appreciate his sense of humour.
His Lordship appreciates Australia’s sense of
humour! Whatever sense of humour the Aus-
tralian has got is set going by the post-prandial
pappycock of elevated personages who take them-
selves and their little emotions with such dreadful
seriousness, and find wonderful portents of loya l ty
and love in the don’t-care-a-blankv-ness of the
average crowd in these parts. When His Ex.
talks largely and impressively of having given the
best years of his life to Australia, the Australian
sense of humour bursts loose, and you can hear
the kookaburra sing from Carlton to Dim Dis-
tance, which is Back o’ Beyond.
A Melbourne time-payment-picture man,
in default of a few shillings balance due, recently
essayed to seize on two oleographs. The two
house-ladies objected, and the pictures were
smashed in the course of some remarks that
fell from the various parties concerned,
also the picture-man was violently seized
by the leg when trying to depart through
the open window, and trailed all over the
furniture. He retaliated, but the ladies
stuck to their prey while the policeman
came, when they charged their
creditor with assault. At the
Court they told the magistrate
that they didn’t wish to be too
hard, and wouldn’t press the
charge if accused would pay costs.
He paid £2. Truly it is wonder-
ful what a woman will go through
to save her oleograph. A lioness
robbed of her whelps is nothing
to a suburban female deprived of
a shocking picture of a child
and a dog in a pine frame.

Painful indeed is the cant mouthed by big
personages who have felt called upon to express
opinions in public concerning the recent terrible
misfortunes of Victorians at the war. In every
case, after a spasm of Chadbandish snuffle, the
comforters have wound up with a stodgy burst of
eloquence about the Glory reflected upon the
country and the lustre shed upon the names of
these gallant boys, who have asserted their
courage by dying heroic deaths for their country.
Passing over the fact that the unfortunate boys
have not died for their country, but whilst en-
deavouring to steal other men’s country for a third
party, one may question the heroism, glory, Ac.,
&c., attendant on being prosaically shot down like
rabbits in a vulgar scramble, all over before any
man in the crowd had time to exhibit any particu-
lar brand of moral grandeur. God !itis a terrible
thing to be slaughtered in a foreign land merely
to provide a pack of good, greasy, fat-headed
blatherskites at home opportunities of committing
oratorical nuisances in public.

The advertising-joke business flourishes
in Sydney, to the great profit of the lawyers. Last
week appeared in the dailies an advt. calling upon
the electioneering friends of a certain prim and
well-groomed ex-alderman to meet “at Mr. R.
Howard’s. Ben Buckler-road, Bondi, Thursday
evg., 8 o’clock. 1.0.G.T.” Now, Mr. R. Howard
is Sydney’s popular hangman.

The failure of a certain lady, in the hotel
line of business, to get at Sydney Morning
Herald for damages, is a gratifying circumstance
from some points of view. The grievance of Mrs.
Public-house arose through a marriage-advertise-
ment. It set forth that a lady was to let for pur-
poses of honorable matrimony, and gave her
initials and address. As a result, she claimed to
have suffered much grief, trouble, and public dis-
respect, and to have been rushed by strange men
offering her their more-or-less soiled and undesir-
able hands in union. She said that she didn’t
insert the advt., and all that the Herald could
say was that it didn’t know whether she did or
not. It had offered to explain publicly that
the advt. was a sinful hoax, and, that offer
being refused, it asked what more could be
fairly expected. It might demand, in such
cases, that the advt. should be verified by the
signature of the alleged advertiser, but that
wouldn’t make matters any better, as it couldn’t
tell whether the signature was real or not. It
might go further and insist that it be verified by
the actual presence of the advertiser, but then it
couldn’t tell whether he or she was genuine or
bogus. If it demanded that the advertiser should
be identified it would then be necessary to identify
the identifier. So the aggrieved Mrs. Public
House kept on saying that she didn’t insert or
authorise the advt., and the paper kept on
ing that it didn’t know, and the jury probably
decided that, in any case, a good-looking woman
who kept a public-house might receive worse in-
sults than a dozen offers of marriage. Anyhow it
gave the paper a verdict.

The decision of the N.S.W. Attorney-
General to proceed no further in the charge of
murder against Mrs. Jane Smith meets with
public approval. She stood three trials before
three Judges and three juries, and three disagree-
ments followed. Of course, fourth trials have in
similar eases been insisted on, with the result, as

lately in Melbourne, the acquittal of the accused,
and, as some years ago in Sydney, the accused’s
conviction. Louisa Collins was tried four times
and, afcer three disagreements, was found guilty
and executed. New evidence was, however, in-
troduced at the fourth trial. The ordinary rule
should be, and it is generally so in England,
that unless new evidence has been adduced, con-
viction on a third tiial is not followed by the
death penalty. An affirmative verdict of the
third 12 men must be weighed for what it is
worth against the inability of the 24 preceding
men to find that verdict.

The acquittal of George Muir Houston,
late a clerk in Vic. Mines Department, led Judge
ON THE STAGE.
ROMEO (wtto voce): “ Will you marry me?”
JULIET: “Never, you brute!” (Hissing.) “ I'd
dance on your grave first!”
A’Beckett to make disparaging remarks about the
jury—seemingly with more justification than
usual. The trouble arose through the disappear-
ance of one Ryan’s money. Ryan was in arrear
with the rent of his timber lease, and Houston, in
his official capacity, urged him to pay up. So
Ryan came to Melbourne and paid Houston, at
the Mines Office, £l3l odd in settlement. Houston
was not the man authorised to receive money, and
he declined at first to take it; but Ryan, who ap-
parently reckoned it was sufficient if he paid
the money to any one in the office, and got a
receipt, and who was probably tired of
losing himself in the corridors of the public
buildings, pressed it on him. That was ap-
parently the last ahybody saw of the money,
and Houston was charged with larceny as
a bailee of Ryan’s hard-earned loot. It
was urged for the defence that Houston
wasn’t legally a bailee because Ryan didn’t tell
him to hand over the money to anybody
else; the confiding timber-getter merely dabbed
it down on the counter and took it for granted it
would reach its destination. The jury found
Houston guilty of misappropriating, but said it
wasn’t sure the money was Ryan’s at all, and as the
charge was one of appropriating Ryan’s money the
result, after much mental wandering, was acquittal.
The Crown, apparently, won’t charge Houston
with taking its money, because if it acknowledged
the coin as its money received from Ryan, then it
must admit that Ryan’s rent is paid. And the
jury won’t convict Houston of taking Ryan’s
money because it has a half-formed suspicion that
the money is the Crown’s money. So there is
very little satisfaction for Ryan either way.

The amendment of the Vic. Marriage Act,
which enables a girl to force the alleged father of
her expected infant to plank down money to cover
the expenses of “the event,” is going to do away
with the favorite plan of identification by re-
semblance. It is always foolish to be like another
man’s child, but it is less dangerous now. Con-
sidering that so many Melbourne men have had to
pay for looking like certain babies, isn’t it fair
that the man who is compelled to pay before
arrival should get his money back if the expected
little stranger proves to be remarkably like the
other fellow ?

Vic. Chief-Justice Madden recently dis-
missed the divorce petition of a lady who said
that her husband didn’t have a bath for five or six
years, and had latterly added desertion to his
other iniquities. Madden, it seems, didn’t abso-
lutely disbelieve the story £>f respondent’s want of
a wash, but he said, in his large, sententious
voice, that when a woman married she took her
husband “with all his imperfections on his head.”
Which showed a shocking want of logic in two
different ways: The lady took her husband with
all his imperfections, but the matter at issue was
that he later acquired new imperfections which
she didn’t take him with. Further he was charged
with having ieft off washing his body as well as
his head.

The Senate's positive and immovable stand
on the Supply Bill, when it kicked that necessary
document hack to the Govt, with an intimation
to introduce it properly, shows that that House is

charge of the aggressive chamber. Once when he
returned the Postal Bills to the Govt, printer to

A WOMANS LETTER
_ . Sydney, Jane 25, 1901.
Mr Dear Arini,—
There s a large vacuum in Sydney consequent
on the flight of Fat Clara, the Gippsland lady who
used to exhibit her 39-stone self m George-street.
The other day she waddled down to the G.P.O.
Savings Bank, either to plant more wealth or to
draw it, followed by staring hundreds, and when
she came out again the police had to make a lane
for her through those who love a free show. Ciara
and the Duke of York met in London some years
ago, and he was quite pleased to see her again here
and shake her hand by sections, and chat awhile
on whatever Fat Ladies and Dukes talk of when
they foregather. Clara is still 80 inches round the
waist, and still protests that she does not tight-
lace. She cannot be ambitious or she would go
to Turkey and be a Sultana, jewel-laden, and
shake a marble palace with her tread, and get
high offices and titles for Gippslanders when the
rush set in Turkeyward.
Few men with a keen sense of humor, or of the
eternal fitness of things, bear acquired titles.
Just look at Way, Bart, intimating to the
Board of Adelaide Art Gallery that efforts were
being made to induce the Duke of York to un-
veil the painting “Love and Death” recently
bought by said gallery. Many of us know
of Watts famous picture. We all know why
Princess May is Duchess of Cornwall and York
instead of being Duchess of Clarence and Avon-
dale. She would be at George’s side when he un-
veiled a picture that must remind them both of—
well, .of Death and Love. What was that Laureate
Austin wrote about her “ forever doomed to wear
the mockery of widowhood around her maiden
hair.” No wonder officialism must use the words
“efforts’’and “induce.”
Do the Yorks keep diaries ? If so, and if they’ve
a sense of humor, what reading there will be for
father Ned ! Intelligence had come through
of the episode on board the yacht Shamrock, and
the Duke was holding a reception. An elderly
gentleman, swelling with a desire to say some-
thing sympathetic, was presented. Looking at
York steadily for a second he murmured, “Sad
noos this about yer Pa. ain’t it ? ”
Talk about funeral baked meats! In strict
harmony with the slump in York stocks is the
fact that those decorative Sydney street obelisks
were last week auctioned for'five shillings each!
Some of them cost over £lOO each.- And think of
the “ Government stroke ” stricken at their erec-
tion. Thirty shillings has bought that classic six
tint obstructed Granny’s neighbourhood, near
Hunter-street. Why, the timber in them was
worth more, to say nothing of their scroll work,
their acanthus leaves and censers and urns, and
above all that “loyalty” and “ iptense devotion
to that kingship” mixed thick with the canvas
plaster. The fate of these obelisks is indeed
suggestive of .the Australian’s attitude towards
his idols. He is sadly given to walloping his Joss.
The American eagle has Tooed considerably of
late in Sydney. Courtesies, in the form of
dinner, teas, at homes, and dances have brought
Columbia’s exiles on board the. Brooklyn, and
fetched the Brooklyn officers ashore. When
Admiral Remey was “At Home” last week the
Bird, although very wet, fairly screamed with
pride of the crowd (that turned up in spite
of the rain), and of the Brooklyn’s decora-
tions and music and choice things to
drink and nibble. Cards said dancing, but only
three or four couples attempted a waltz. Tall,
very tall and slender, Mrs Orlando Baker, who
lives a bit out of the world at Petersham, but will
receive by-and-bye at the Consulate, was present,
chief amongst the exiles. One of Mrs. Baker’s
daughters fills the chair of Greek at lowa Uni-
versity. When I tell you that this daughter is
only a couple of years younger-than Mrs. Baker
you will probably conclude that she should have a
step before her relationship. Miss Baker suc-
ceeded her father in the dead-language chair.
Seems as if Greek chairs were heirlooms in some
families.
Mrs. G. H. Reid, who knows how to wear her
clothes and handle her parasol and talk to gold-
laced men, was present with the fragile gentleman
who is supposed to spend his time keeping a dog
out of the wet, but who seems to make time to
frivol. He was protesting against a newspaper
item that stated he had taken a house called “ The
Wattles,” at St. Kilda. He never did—and won’t.
A wounded propeller was the first cause of the
“ At-Home ” on board the Armand Behie last
Monday. As the vessel had to stay longer than
usual in port, M. Brasier de Thuy, agent of the
Messageries Maritimes Co., and Commander Le
Coispellier asked 500 persons to come and rejoice
with them just for rejoicing’s sake. Once you
mounted the gangway you saw little of the ship,
it was so disguised with flowers and tricolor
ribbon and tiny electric lamps, and the tables
were covered with quaint French cookies. A lot
of visitors were badly “had” over what they
thought were huge bowls of strawberries, and said
they’d take strawberries and cream. Not until
they had bitten a berry did they know it was a
sugar-almond. The same people that you see at
every “ At Home ” were present, and they mostly
wore the same clothes.
.Went to a Sydney Quaker wedding the other
day, when I noticed two or three important
differences between the Quaker wedding ceremony
and that of other denominations. To begin with,
there is practically no wedding ceremony at all!
The people merely sit round and wait till the
spirit moves the bridegroom to offer himself to
the bride, and what would happen if the spirit
didn’t move that personage is a mystery. Then
the people wait some more till the bride likewise
, experiences divine prompting in the direction of
offering herself unto the bridegroom. The couple
do all the marrying themselves without the aid of
a middle man, and the bride doesn’t grovel in the
slightest, the obey doctrine being completely left
out. The Quaker bride and bridegroom take each
other on equal terms, the gist of their remarks on
the subject being that they will do their level best,
which seems a sensible way of arranging things
on the whole.
It is not often that a clergyman forbids people
to come to his own church. Something like that
occurred the other day when a minister issued
blue and white tickets to his congregation per-
mitting no one unticketed to witness the ceremony
of his marriage. Blue signified that you came to
the after feed, but the white pasteboard holders
merely saw the ceremony and then departed to
discuss it over their own tea and toast in their own
homes.
Lieut. Defrayer and his Scarf are a much-
photoed pair in this town. Sometimes the scarf
is pictured without the Lieut. Never the Lieut,
without the Scarf. It is a homely brown thing—
such as any old lady might knit—but it has the
merit of being entirely the late Queen’s work.
Some of her granddaughters and ladies-in-waiting,
the Duchess of York told Mr. Dufrayer, offered
to help her in the making of the scarves—but her
Majesty declined aid as she wished every stitch to
be her very own. By the way, Lieut. Dufrayer’s
mother (formerly a Miss McPherson) was the
lady who, when Morgan, the bushranger, stuck-
up Peechelba Station, Murray River (his last
crime, for he was shot there) was compelled to
play the piano half the night to amuse the robber,
who sat drowsing with his feet on the table and
two pistols at his hand.
At her farewell musical “At Home ” at the
Australia (it was a very diamond-dusted evening),
Mrs. Mackenzie Fairfax wore a gown of white
satin covered with silver sequins. Otherwise the
dress was quite plain. Her hair was squeezed
into a little coil at the nape of her neck, and just
above the forehead, fiat on the parting of the hair,
was a tiny diamond swallow. Women with small,
pretty heads often make their faces suffer in their
desire to keep the contour of the head un-
broken. She sang beautiful songs in far finer
voice than we heard her in at the Ophir Band
charity concert. Mrs. Van der Veer Green,
looking splendidly colossal—reminiscent of Bar-
tholdi’s statue at the entrance of N.Y. harbor
—also sang, and so set people worrying her to
appear in public again. Her “ Love, the Pedlar,”
was a gem of considerable sparkle and first water.
Miss M’Quade, all in white samite—or was it
satin ? —with black roses on her left shoulder,
looked and played well. There was a wonderful
dress—bright birds and flowers and trails of
leaves had been cut from silk cretonne and ap-
pliqued on to a very frail foundation, and the
train was like unto a pink cloud. The wearer
looked as if she’d got bushed in a section of Ceylon
forest. Mrs. B. R. Wise, Mrs. Pilcher, and Mrs.
Burdekin were among those present, becomingly
gowned.
Waitara Foundling Home had a field day last
week to present its annual report and give after-
noon tea. The Rev. Mother Alovsius came up
from the Mother House and Cardinal Moran from
town. Dr. Angel Money and Dr. Kelly left
their patients to have a look at the 94 babies, and
make little sympathetic speeches. And a fresh
number of ladies joined the committee. You see
the Home is dependent on private charity. The
visitors flocked for choice over to the cottage in
the orange orchard where the youngest babies are
rocked. Dozens of tiny creatures, from a week to
a few months old, lay in their swinging cots, and
sucked meditative thumbs or demanded nourish-
ment with strong wails. In another building
larger babies gathered around fires, for it was very
cold at Waitara, and in yet another, mature
creatures of four or five were at kindergarten.
Sixteen mothers are in the Home at present with
their very young offspring. And if you want to
crown a day with a good deed you will send the
Home a subscription.
An attempt to revive the shilling “ Pops ” was
made last Saturday at the Town Hall by the
Percy Bates Concert Co. A crowded house
greeted the programme, so the attempt ought to
become chronic. Mrs. Ward, wife of the nimble
Millionaire in “ Florodora,” was the chief attrac-
tion. She has a voice that suggests Trebelli-
Dolores, fresh and easy, and has evidently the
makings of a fine singer. Rivers Allpress and
tenor Bates were the next “draws.” Miss Kate
Hancock sang her two songs sweetly, and two
small children did a song and coon dance.
It is now said that a much-talked-of prospective
marriage is not to come off.
This relates to a matter of business.
Hatte’s fair, at Newtown, begins to-day, and mil-
linery (real Paris models), coats and skirts, dress-
ing-gowns, little Prince Edward of York suits,
fancy haberdashery, ribbons and laces are, it
is officially announced, severely marked
down. Also, lot of ladies’ tweeds may be had
very cheaply; and you can buy a good dinner set
of 26 pieces for 14/6. And, if you want any of the
standard authors Dumas, Thackeray, Scott,
Dickens—you may have them for 4|d. each.
Fancy “The Newcomes,” in a nice, stiff, red-
brown cover, for four and a half tram fares !
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“At the opening of Parliament the most brand-
new looking male was ‘Billy’ Williams, the
masher member for St. Kilda, who lately married
the daughter of Mr. Pat. M‘Caughan. Said lady
was one of the smartest of feminines in grey, with
a bold splash of cerise in the doorway of her toque.
“A strong smell of vamish-cum-mackintosh
carried home the first impression of the Opening
Ceremony of Vic. State Parliament. After that
came‘Lieut.’ Guy Madden’s legs under curtain-
kilts. Stand the said Guy on a bag of Blank’s
Oatmeal and label it ‘ That’s wot 1 grow’d on,’
and you have set him in his native element and
given the meal a suitable advt. Nothing more
waxwork-like than Those Legs has ever been seen
in tartan. A third impression left by the wintry
function was the increased proportions of a gay
globe-trotter, who might have been, were it not
for a pair of sparkling eyes and a set of expressive
teeth (all her own), mistaken for Benedetto in
smart attire.
“ A gloomy mothers’-meeting tone prevailed at
the Opening Ceremony in the well-lighted Council
chamber. The mourning tones of the women’s
dress, the occasional whiff of violets, the hushed
whispers, suggested a whiskyless wake. Then the
mournful air of the Hon. Holder helped the idea.
The sedateness of Richard Baker did not
upset it. And there were the clerics—Bishop
Goe and Dr. Bevan—sandwiched in among the
black gowns; and George Jenkins, C.M.G., was
there, too, in a funereal suit and without a smile—
so mirthless that he didn’t even stroke his beard.
But Usher M‘Coil’s announcement in loud,
anxious, punctuated periods, that the Governor
was approaching the building, introduced a comic
element and dispelled the funereal illusion.
“One missed the late absented Zeal’s timid
hand-grip and Corypheus Jenkins’sly compliment
as the introductory to the tea-fight. Instead,
Speaker and Mrs. Mason offered greetings and
exchanged compliments. Mrs. Mason wore a
smart toilette of violet that had seen ducal ser-
vice. Senator Neihl allowed Mrs. Mason to in-
troduce him to a host of girls, and set him talking
to them all at once. Melb. girls are deeply im-
pressed by the brigandish air of the terrible devil
of a Colonel. They’ve never seen anything like it
before, nor met such an indefatigable talker.
They all stand round and stare in amazement at
the Champion Tireless Talker of the World.
“Lady Hopetoun in habit, top hat and high
boots looks bettor than in anything else. Cer-
tainly not more cheerful, for though she rode at
the heels of the hounds all Friday afternoon, when
the Findon Harriers hunted two lively foxes to
earth, she did so in sober earnest, and Harry
Brush, the much-damaged, got the nearest acci-
dent to a smile as lie helped her from her fine grey
steed, long after all the other habit-dashers were
dismounted and clearing the scone-plates. Return-
ing from the hunt, the cold Excellency read a
scarlet-covered novel in the State carriage, while
her lively partner recounted stories of the hunt
and chase (presumably) to his escorts. The
Countess wasn’t taking anything of the ladies on
board the train. She preferred to yawn over her
book.
“Dr. Maudsley, the Collins-st. medico of the
Soft Voice, shadowed the sprightly widow of
‘Cliveden’ in the field, while S’Rupert’s consort,
radiant in her hunting red costume and rustic hat,
drove the rest of the Dowager’s family in a pony-
cart. In one of the fours-in-hand rose up the long
figure of Phillip Fysh, while his diminutive wife
snuggled away in a cart with a party of seal-
coated matrons. The belle of the day—Miss
Muriel Williams—was a carelessly-garbed figure
in black. Her uncommonly well-dressed head
carried a jaunty hat of black and gold. She still
adheres to the light veil worn to the end of the
nose—a French fashion.
“The big, bustling, noisy contingent of sports
and swagger somebodies who journeyed up to
Sunbury at the invitation of the Rupert Clarkes
on Friday were welcomed by a scarlet-tailored
hostess, and entertained with a very sparkling
breakfast. Sister Hilda Cumming, blooming in
blue, got away from the table,of much Excellency
and had a jolly time with a Toorak party, having
for neighbor Majah Clarke, the best-looking
fellow on the premises. The dowager Clarke was
one of the doughtiest of Dianas, and almost
looked jaunty in her hard boxer and trim habit.
“ There was nothing like the wild heather or
the wild gaiety at ‘Rupertswood’ this year that
there was at the opening of the last meet, when a
parcel of hilarious girls drove off to a wayside inn,
and, while the billy boiled, sang, in a rallying
chorus, ‘ Why did I leave my little back-room ? ’
This year calmer weather and more correct con-
ditions reigned, and a well-stocked tent provided
the cup that cheers and the scone that racks the
chest after the hunt.
“What a pity Mrs. John Sandes (erstwhile
Miss Claire Berry) didn’t give to the part she
lately on the boards a tenth part of the
confidence she so' agreeably throws into her
appearance off the stage ! At the Hunt, the other
day, no one had the ‘airs’ of the budding stage
star, who carried off a not too fetching grey frock
with the stage dignity of an angry Lady Teazle.
“The Millers Albert and Son—ran the
‘Rupertswood’ shivoo in the absence of the
Baronet, whose arrival in England, by the way,
was cabled home on Thursday. S’Rupert’s trip
this time, many will regret to hear, was taken for
reasons of health, heart-trouble being the disturb-
ance.
“Everybody inwardly and a few outwardly
groaned when George Cruickshank, of the House
of Reps, and the ‘Cliveden’ fold, arose at the
Hunt breakfast, to drone out a return of thanks
on behalf of the hostess. He began in the true
parliamentary-bore fashion, but the shuffling of
feet moved him not to hurry on—and he only
pulled up after a ten minutes’ tongue-drag.
“ The other day the students of the University
Conservatorium rallied together to give their new
Prof, (the quiet Scot) and Mrs. Peterson a wel-
come to their new sphere. But the Prof, came
alone and thanked them for their good intentions,
and heard their music, and carried home a shower-
posy to his guid wife (who was too ill to attend)
from the regretful students. They appear to have
much respect for the staid Professor, and their
parents expect them to do great work on the
strength of it. Is much more progress made by
the students with ‘ temperament ’ who look to
catch the sparks scattered at the anvil of Orpheus
Hall? Some people begin to wonder whether the
creation of ‘ temperament ’ is an unmixed bless-
ing. For one brilliant pupil you get ninety-and-
nine prigs.
“I like ‘Ernani,’ it’s so laughable. At least
nowadays, when suitors are scarce and shy, it
amuses one to see stout Signora De Benedetto
wooed simultaneously and stormily by three
gallants, one poor and handsome, another old and
rich, the third Royal and ugly. Everything, you
see, beauty, wealth, and rank, piled at the plump
feet of Elvira, who, in trained pink-satin, looks
much more attractive than as Ethiopian Aida,
but who is-do you remember that GUbertian
description ?—‘ not a girl of a thousand, but a
girl of forty-nine.’ The footwear of Elvira s three
admirers, as they bark and bite vocally in the
poor girl’s pi'ivate apartments, is a study m con-
trasts. Bandit Ernani (Larizza) sports bold,
defiant jack-boots. Don Silva (Travaglim), a
nice Auld-Robin-Grey ancient (the flower or trie
suitor flock), patters round in tame-cat black-
velvet shoes, fastened with little straps and gold
buttons. Don Carlos (Cattadori), alias the King
of Spain, affects ankle-boots. They have the mien
of prunellas, but I guess they’re black-velvet, and
they turn over at the top in small pale-blue tabs.
Very chic and extra-special, like the varnish of the
York beard and the build of King Ned’s frock-coats.
Like King Ned and Yorkie, Don Carlos is other-
wise not chic. His shaggy red hair and beard
smack of Gog and Magog. His long, thin legs are
shown up by meagre black hose, while his short
top-trunks are padded out a la Hottentot. Quite
an embarrassing back-view, and such a contrast
with the Royal flirt’s calf-contour.
“Life will be more expensive than ever, now
that Royalty has reintroduced the system of ‘ gifts
for good boys.’ The Duke gave our Lieut. -
Governor a silver salver. The recipient promptly
took a wrinkle, and presented the leader of his
escort during the celebrations with an expensive
bauble. Now, chairmen of various committees,
having worked a local Dives into Federal power,
each receives gold medal from theirman. Nothing
in the nature of bribery, mind you. The echoes of
the past battle had almost died away, when the
grateful legislator unexpectedly started to weep
thankfully on the waistcoats of his supporters-in-
chief. Next time they looked at their watch-
chains, they espied a golden token of remembrance
dangling thereon.
“ The Victorian Dog Show is to be held at the
Exhibition Building, when the State Parliament
also sits. The walls of the building are so tiiin
that the slightest outside sound is heard within.
When Madden, C.J. was reading the opening
speech he could scarcely be heard above the sound
of the band outside. How nice it will be when
some poor old wheezy-voiced M.L.C. is trying to
talk above the sound of 500 pups all barking at
once, not to speak of the crowing of cocks, the
quacking of ducks, and the gobble-gobble of prize
turkeys! ‘Mr. President’ —bow! wow! —‘I
maintain ’ —quack-quack—‘that this ’Ouse’ —cock-
a-doodle-doo —‘ is the ’—bow-wow-wow-wow
‘saviour of the country ’—quack—wow—cock-a—
wow-wow—doodle—quack—doo.’ That is the sort
of thing that will go on. Not that it matters.
Any dog could bark more sense than is talked by
the average Vic. Leg. Councillor.
“R.C. circles are interested in the coming mar-
riage of Dr. Eustace Keogh, of South Yarra, and
Miss Winifred Rowe, of the same district. Both
families are gilded pillars of Holy Church.
“Brighton is a suburb that leans towards
Toorakian snobbery, and tries'all it can to be ex-
clusive. The latest effort in this direction is
turned towards making an approaching Bread-
and-Scrape dance as ‘nice’ as possible, so, though
the tickets are only half-a-crown, a ‘selection’ (?)
committee has been formed. Only a two-and-six-
penny selection committee.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Another Letter from a Nurse. "
8 Carlton-street,
Prahran, Yic.,
12th March, 1901.
Dear Sirs,
I am pleased to report the benefit
I derived from the use of Warner’s Safe Cure.
After many years of pain and suffering from
kidney and liver complaint, I, who was accustomed
to minister to others, was brought to a bed of sick-
ness myself. The doctors could give me no hope
of relief or recovery, and said that I had but a
short time to live. I tried various advertised
remedies, but all failed to give me relief until I
tried Warner’s Safe Cure. From the first bottle I
began to improve in health. The pains gradually
left me. I continued to take the medicine for
some time, until I was perfectly cured, and sound
in body and mind. I may state that the doctors
were more than surprised to see me up and about
again.
I have heard of many other cases during my
professional career, which were in like manner
cured by the use of Warner’s Safe Cure.
Yours obediently
EMMA DARYELL,
Ladies’ Nurse.
Messrs. H. H. Warner and Co., Ltd.
Warner’s Safe Cure is the result of scientific re-
search. It cures all diseases of the kidneys and
liver. As a consequence, all disorders arising
from a deranged condition of these vital organa
are overcome. Indigestion, rheumatism, anaemia,
blood disorders, biliousness, gout, gravel, general
debility, neuralgia and Bright’s disease, are
amongst the many complaints due to defective
action of the kidneys and liver.*

J. O. N., SENATOR.
He’s tall and shallow, loose of jaw,
In language ever fiercely harsh,
And yet whilst speaking makes his points,
You’ll note them —in his large moustache !
George Leake, Westralia’s new Premier,
is one of the most popular men in that State,
though a Groper by birth and belonging to one
of the Six Families. Born at Perth in 1856,
Leake was educated in that town and at
St.. Peter’s College, Adelaide. He was ad-
mitted to the W. A. Bar in ’63, and was made
acting-Crown-Solicitor the following year.
At the advent of Responsible Government,
in 1890, he was returned for Roebourne,
but declined a portfolio in the Forrest
Ministry, then just starting on its
decade of power. In ’94, he resigned
the Crown-Solicitorship, was returned
for Albany and elected leader of the
Opposition. Leake has been a con-
sistent Democrat, though he has the
reputation of being somewhat
lazy. He has always been a great
thorn in the side of Bigjohn,
whom he nightly goaded to fury
from the front Opposition
bench. Not that there was
anything to get furious about,
but Oom John could not brook
opposition. Leake, in thecir-
cumstances, regarded For-
rest as legitimate sport, and
a few well-timed interjec-
tions would set the bull-
voiced autocrat snorting
violently. Leake fought
manfully for Federation
and the rights of the people,
and, if a referendum were
taken to-day, his choice as
Premier would be confirm-
ed by a two-to-one major-
ity. Yet the seats were so
ounningly and shamefully
distributed by the mail who
sent a contingent to
S’Africa to insist on the full
franchise being granted to
the Uitlanders, that it is
just possible Leake will find
himself in a minority. Indeed, it irf
said that he can only rely on 22 votes
in a House of 50.

When Crick and Willis—the only curly-
headed members of N.S.W. State Parliament—
recently addressed a public meeting of rabbit and
drought-cursed landholders in the Riverina dis-
trict, there were, curiously enough, upon the
Slatform the only two absolutely bald men in
r.S.W. Leg. Assembly (both wear wigs).
Ex-Judge Martin, whose love-adventures
and run-away to Australia caused so much talk,
is already quite rehabilitated and repatriated in
the Land of the Moa. Great interest was, of
course, taken in his re appearance, and the prob-
ability is that his female clientele will be larger
than that of any other lawyer in Maoriland.
Ed. Bulletin.— That yarn about S.A.
Premier Jenkins being a side-show blower in
Cooper and Bailey’s Circus reads all right, but let
me tell you that Jenkins did not arrive in Aus-
tralia until after Cooper and Bailey’s Circus had
loft. I arrived about the same time, and I know
that Mr. Jenkins had his time fully occupied
looking after the business of a very large publish-
ing house, whose interests were in his hands.—C.
Like Senator Playford, whose seat he
takes in S.A. Assembly, W. Jamieson is a very
practical agriculturist. He was the champion
ploughman the last year in which the S.A. Agri-
cultural Society held a championship ploughmg
match.
Mr. Justice M. H. Stephen, of N.S.W.,
was the first native of Australia admitted to
N.S.W. Bar. He was born in Tasmania in 1828,
and was called to the Bar in 1850. All the men
at the Bar when Mr. Stephen presented himself
were foreign-born.
Two of the oldest ecclesiastics in the Aus-
tralian Anglican Church are Dean Cowper, of
Sydney, who will be 91 on Tuesday, July 2, and
Archdeacon Farr, of Adelaide, who will be 82 on

bourne lived to be 96.
Payne, one of the Melbourne candidates
for the Vic. Leg. Council, is a son of the enor-
mously wealthy Payne, whose estate turned in a
fat probate not so very long ago. He is unheard-
of as a politician, and a particularly painful type
of the Rich Landlord.
David JSyme has dropped his Queen’s
Memorial collection scheme out of the Age with-

Bryan O’Loghlen, who was once Austra-
lia’s only baronet, completed his 73rd year on
Thursday of this week. He was once quite an
important political personage in Victoria, but
now he is as much a dead letter as either Gavan
Duffy or Townsend M'Dermott.

The thick German accent of George when lie got
well into his Address-in-Reply. After all, no
doubt German is the nursery language of all
George’s family. Still, it was nice and filial to
hear George alluding to King Ned as “ my tear
vater.”
A. E. Morgans is regarded in some quar-
ters as the coming Premier of Westralia.
He admitted to a reporter the other day that
he intended remaining in the State for a
long period, and would be found taking
a deep interest in politics in the future,
but thought that the new Ministry
should be. given a fair trial before it is
thrown out. Morgans is about the
only boomster remaining in Wes-
tralia whose reputation has not
been scratched by his own wild
cats. Believed that he is
quietly waiting to see how
things shape before he decides
to go for the Premiership as
leader of the Opposition, or to
get there by coalition with
the present crowd. He would
be well-advised to hurry up,
for as the bottoms fall out of
some of his mines his bubble
reputation will suffer, and
mines, all the world over have
a way of coming down crash,
especially in Westralia. His
best mine is undoubtedly that
named after himself, Mt. Mor-
gans. It is worthy of his name,
but not of that of the mine which
its name so closely resembles. On
the other hand, the Millionaire,
another of his flotations in the same
district, appears to be by no means
so promising. He has floated other
concerns in Westralia, the outlook of
which is not too dazzling. There was a
time when George Gray was looked upon
as the coming Premier, What chance
would he have now ?
E. H. Coombe, who takes Senator John
Downer’s place in S.A. Assembly, was one of the
official shorthand-writers at the first sittings of
the Federal Convention in Adelaide. Like ex-
Premier Holder, he gravitated into country jour-
nalism midway through life, and thence passes
into politics.
Langdon Bonython, of S.A., spent £760
on his candidature for the House of Representa-
tives, while Labor-member Batchelor got there
just the same with an expenditure of £33. For
the Senate, Chaffey Baker, the Tory, spent £605,
while Labor-member M‘Gregor arrived for a
trifle of £33.
Mr. “Vesey” Browne has bought Dul-
calmah property, near Singleton, N.S.W. The
residence on the estate, which contains 11,250
acres, cost £30,000, and the price paid by Mr.
Browne for the whole lot was £45,000, or at the
rate of £4 per acre. The new owner intends
residing there.
A Federal Minister had a dog, and it had
a habit of biting people. Once, when he was
absent, it rushed out and frightened a passer-by
so that proceedings were taken in the matter.
Then he sent quite a long telegram of instructions
on the subject, and the message was sent “on
service ” arid paid for by Government.
Northern Territory, the biggest electoral
district in the world, is now represented by the
smallest member of S.A. Assembly. Solomon’s
successor is S. J. Mitchell, an almost unknown
Adelaide solicitor. Mitchell is president of the
Telegraph Operators’ Association, and thus had
hundreds of eager canvassers all along the over-
land line.
Philoprogenitive Ireland ! Six brothers,
Faheys, left Ireland in 1840, and settled in N.S.
Wales. The last of them died the other day,
aged 82, and the family computation is that the
six have left behind them a thousand descendants.
James Anthony Froude used to blame productive-
ness of this sort on what he called the philopro-
genitive potato.
In re the jibes levelled at Mayor Ware, of
Adelaide, for kissing the Duke’s hand on being
made a C.M.G., it is maintained by Ware’s
friends that he acted as correctly as was possible
under the circumstances. He is very lame,
through a railway accident of years ago, and, being
unable to kneel like the rest, he acted as he did
by official advice.
King O’Malley, of the hyacinthine locks
and the portentous spectacles, will be 43 years old
on Tuesday next. It is his constant complaint
that his mother would not cross the St. Lawrence
(his native home was just on the Canadian side),
so that he might be born in the United States.
“I can never be President now,” he says with a
wail; “that is why I left that great country.”
The late James M‘Kean put up one of the
long-talking records in Vic. Leg. Assembly. On
quite a minor question—whether Stawell stone
snould be used in the building of Parliament
House—he spoke for nearly five hours. Deceased,
who had nearly 40 years’ experience of the Vic-
torian Bar, always maintained that the greatest
forensic effort made during that time was Daw-
son’s summing-up for petitioner in the Molesworth
divorce-case.
Dear Bulletin.— Before the York flare
dies quite out—what price me for a procession, or.
a K. C.M.G., or to have my picture in The
Bulletin, or, better than all, to get a fat
billet. Listen! I am the eldest son and
eldest child, of the eldest son and eldest
child, of the eldest son and eldest child of
the first white female born in N.S.W. (Rebecca
Small, b. 1788; afterwards “ Granny ” Oakes,
d. 1883). If the whole family came along behind
me, we should make no slouch of a procession in
ourselves. But it’s the billet I’m after. — Leslie
Oakes.
THE REVERSE OF RESERVED.
Forceful Wallace Nelson, five years editor
of People’s Newspapee, at Rockhampton (Q.) t
has left the paper, and talks of going to England.
Wallace’s brains and honesty were appreciated by
many readers, but not by Rockhampton adver-
tisers. It is the business of crawling for advts. —
selling your soul for pottage —that makes Aus-
tralian country journalism the low-down tiling it
often is.
A N.S.W. candidate . lately opened his
campaign in a wayback township. Three minutes’
speaking used up his ideas, and he proceeded to
state that someone had hocussed the water on the
table, and had turned his mind into a dreary
blank; he intended to forward a sample of the
fluid to Sydney for analysis. Whereupon the
chairman rose indignantly, and swallowed two
glasses of the suspected liquid. Then a
voice advised the candidate—“ Send yer brains
down ter Sydney, ole man, and get them aner-
lysed,” and the meeting enthusiastically left the
premises.
“Crow-Eater” : The Commonwealth Par-
liament talks of fixing the compulsory-retirement
age in its soon-to-be-ereated Civil Service at 05.
Now Charles Todd, S.A. Postmaster-General,
will be 75 next month, and he looks quite capable
of carrying out his duties for years to come. Re-
tiring allowances were abolished in S.A. in 1881
and it is not very fair to throw the old man on a
cold world without any consideration, seeing that
if the P. and T. departments had not been taken
over by the Federation he would have remained
undisturbed indefinitely. An Adelaide suburban
postmaster, the other day, voluntarily resigned at
the age of 80.
Alexander Forrest (brother of Westralia’s
ex-Premier), who died of Bright’s disease last week,
aged 50, was a bushman of the old type, and an
explorer of the days when men trusted more to
their knowledge of bushcraft to pull them through
than they did to the stomach of a camel. The
successful trip of the Forrests through central
Australia from west to east, after so many
attempts to negotiate the same country from east
to west had failed, was as much due to Alexander
as to John, who got all the kudos. The younger
Forrest did most of the scouting ahead with either
one blackboy or single-handed, and many a time
pulled the party out of a tight place. On the ’79
trip, when he was in charge—from the De Grey
River to the overland line—he somewhat marred
proceedings by an ill-considered attempt to climb
over the steepest part of the King Leopold Range,
and thereby knocked up his horses for no sufficient
reason ; otherwise he showed good judgment and
discretion, and always volunteered for the lion’s
share of the work. Like the late Ernest Giles,
Alex. Forrest was rather given to bestowing
names of titled people on his discoveries, but, at
any rate, Leopold of Belgium has a better claim
to be geographically considered than had Prince
Amadeus. But Australian explorers have ever
been weak in nomenclature. They always hover
between Sandy Creek and Victoria.

The Hindoo in a new role. At a sports-
meeting at Garvoc (Vic.), on the York birthday, a
Hindoo entered for the buckjumping competi-
tion, and, by clinging to the saddle like a
monkey, managed to sit out the first round.
Afterwards a £1 collection induced him
to re-mount; but this time the horse
was fairly on the job, and sent the
darkey flying, his many-folded turban
going first, while his long hair
streamed out in a dozen different
directions. When liam Chutnee
recovered his breath he explained
excitedly in six languages at
once, with a copious supply of
the international “ blanky,” that
he’d have stuck till doomsday had
the moke not adopted the unfair
dodge of bucking sideways.
New-cliuni visitors at any
of the Australian city railway
stations are struck by the fact that,
even in the coldest weather, very few
men walk up and down the plat-
form whilst waiting for their
train. But it isn’t only on rail-
way platforms that the average
Australian stands still whereas
the fidgetty Britisher is kept
moving by force of habit. The
same difference is seen in their
manner of waiting for a girl at a
street corner or killing time on a pier. The
one man walks as though he were condemned
to “sentry go,” and the other seems bent on
giving himself as little trouble as possible,
and takes leaning exercise.
“Yes,” said the imaginative Maorilander,
as the coach rolled through the Waiinaramaropotu
Valley, “ last season I came through here, and
the whole of that flat was covered. The Maoris
were flooded out of their whares, and you could
see the pigs swimming about and eating the pota-
toes floating on the water.” There was a short
silence. “Wall, stranger,” said the Yankee
tourist, “don’t mind giving you half-a-dollar for
every potato .you bring me that’ll float in fresh
water.” Then there was a long silence.
“ Boozuru ” waa lying alongside the road,
with liia hand closed tightly over the bottom of his
pocket. Some bank-notes protruded from the top,
and when a deadbeat came along presently, he gave
a gentle, but ineffectual, pull at them. He passed
on a few paces, and returned, giving the notes
another pull en passant. Then he passed to-and-
fro several times, making a more determined
effort each time, but the notes wouldn’t shift. At
last tug, “ 800/.um ” began to rouse, and, to
make things took right, the deadbeat shook him
and cried, “ Hey ! wake up ! Someone will be
goin’ through you for that money directly. It’s
nearly out of yer pocket now.” “Not much,”
said “ Boozum,” “I had a pretty tight grip*of it
all the time you were pullin’ at it.”

A curious case was recently before Narra-
bri (N.S.W.) Land Court. A selector had ren-
dered his compliance with the provisions of the
Crown Lands Acts difficult by marrying the
owner of the adjoining selection; and the ques-
tion was whether the parties had each, to fulfil the
statutory conditions by residing separately on his
and her selection. It was forcibly argued that
the policy of the law was not only to stimulate
land-settlement, but also to encourage morality ;
and that it was neither intended nor desirable
that married couples should be separated by a six-
wire The court, however, held that the
moral consideration was not weighty enough to
override plain statute law, and that therefore the
conditions of residence had not been performed.
Waiver of forfeiture, however, was recommended,
provided the husband performed his wife’s con-
ditions of residence in addition to carrying out
the improvements on his own land.

“ J. 8.” : Reflection induced by “ Deeby ”
(8., 6/4/’01): Cruelty to animals—dumb or other-
wise—is largely governed by economics. In Aus-
tralia animals are cheap and men dear. In Eng-
land, where an animal is worth three times and a
man one-half their respective Australian values,
the animal has often the better billet. In time
conditions may more closely approximate here,
but till then the dumb animal will continue to
suffer. Meanwhile, there are quite a lot of men
in this country who deserve shooting.

“ W.J.” : The same piteous brute men-

out inconvenience above-ground, and on almost
any low-down Wiininera (Vic.) farm. Where
writer was working a few winters ago, no less
than three plough-horses were regularly slung-up
every night, and next day belted from end to end
of the cultivation. If you forgot the sling your
horse would be down in the morning for certain.
And if you didn’t hoist him bodily to his feet he
would stay there. Also, have seen good honest
horses so blistered and raw under the collar that
they positively refused, when hitched-on at. 7 a. m.,
to stagger two yards. But the inspector, like the
early-closing God send, doesn't get to the back-
blocks.

“ Bungarra ” : Entered aN. YV. Westralian

as if something was on his mind. Asked him what
had happened. He said, “ It’s like this : I chased
and caught a nigger the other day. He was wanted
for camp-stekling ; and I put him securely on the
log, and turned in, happy. When I woke up in
the morning, I found that the chains, cuffs, and
nigger were missing. Two. days after, the chains
and cuffs were returned to my camp in broad day-

“H.S.” on certain aboriginal
burial customs
On the Lower Murray, from Huston
to the Wellington crossing (embracing
the country where the baked gypsum
“ widows’ caps ” were most generally
used) the dead were prepared for inter-
ment by being bound up with bark-cord
in their opossum-cloaks. The grave
was made 4 to sft. deep, and always
lying cast and west, and upon a sheet
of bark in the bottom was placed the
corpse. Frequently the dead man's
weapons were buried with him. Then
the body was fenced-in, by cross-sticks
pressed into the earth on each side of
the grave ; longer sticks being after-
wards placed lengthwise, and across
the others. Upon this framework was
set a thick layer of long grass; so that
none of the earth would come in direct
contact with the remains. Then the
earth was tilled in, the mourners or re-
latives slashing themselves with sharp
shells, and casting them down upon
the newly-made mound. Occasionally
—like the Edwards River natives—they
erected over the grave a bark hut, oval
in shape, and with a small aperture
facing the east. Often a rude brush
fence was placed round the hut. the
enclosed ground being cleared as bare
as a clay-pan. This enclosed space was
regularly tended and swept- sometimes
even for years ; but I never could dis-
cover that there was any fixed duration
for this practice.
The YY est (j. aborigines are
dying off at a terrific rate. Drink
and disease were for many years
the great decimators of the Q.
blacks, but recently opium hits
been the especial scourge of the
poor niggers. Station managers
m search of cheap labor have been,
to some extent, responsible, but the
backblox Chinese are the principal
sources of the mischief. Seldom
does Warrigal .touch genuine
opium. He usually has to content
himself with opium charcoal.
During recent Q. Federal elections a
“ backbloeks ” man walked 45 miles to Barcaldine
to record his vote—only to find that his name was
not on the roll!

Many of the black boys serve at Mass, and there

“WALKS LIKE THIS."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He was dry as Georgie’s poodle and was quickly growing
worse,
But he didn’t hold the boodle—’twaa a fact that made
him curse—
But he was a man of mettle and was not exactly dumb,
So he walked into M’Pherson’s bar and
Called
For
Rum.
So they handed him the bottle and he made that rum
look queer,
Swigged it off and asked politely : “ Is Jim Smith a-staying
here ?
A peculiar sort of feller but a decent, Jimmy is,
And he’s got a gammy left leg and he

Then he limped (as his friend Smith did) to the door and
did a git,
And M’Pherson, realising that he hadn't paid his bit,
Cursed until the glasses rattled and the beer-machine got
jammed,
Then he wound up with the homely phrase of:
“ Well,
I’m

Now, the chap who “had” M’Pherson thought the joke
too good to lose,
So he told a friend of his’n, who was dying for a booze,
How he’d scored his cheap refreshment—though he didn’t
tell him where —
And that friend he struck M’Pherson’s and he

“Jimmy”: Be horse-sense (“Colt,”

set, jamming him between two buffers, whereupon
the horse promptly braced himself against the
skips and held them. Ten minutes after, two
men passing that way found the wheeler uncon-
scious, and the horse still braced against the skips
holding on like grim death. As the road where
the accident happened was very steep, a moment s
delay on the horse’s part would have brought the
string of skips over the wheeler’s body ; as it was,
he escaped with a broken leg.

In the course of a recent stealing case at
Darlinghurst (Sydney) Quarter Sessions, evidence,
though not material to the issue, was given as
follows:
Male witness :“ I live with my brother’s wife. I have
children by her. We all live close together. I often
meet my brother at night after tea, and jwe and
smoke together. There is no animosity between us.
Another male witness : “lam living with my sister-in-
law. We agree well.” , T
A female witness : “lam living with a man to whom l
am not married. He is willing to marry, but my father
objects because I am not of age, and he will not give his
consent.” , . .
Another female witness in same case explained that
“ when I saw the police I was on my way to meet a
married man by appointment.”
Another male witness had been charged with attempt-
ing to rape his own illegitimate child, and another had
served three years for horse-stealing. ” .
“ And,” gasped the Judge, “ we send missionaries to
China." . . ,
“ A Woman ” : Be camels and Afghans in
N.Q.:
Camels in N.Q. have come to stay—and Afghans too, if
the Commonwealth Parliament doesn’t pass the Bill to
exclude aliens. The poverty-stricken carriers and packers
that are left after all the railway construction were
making a mere living wage. The Afghan has now come
to take the very bread out of men who were the bold
pioneers of the country; who in face of incredible
hardships opened up tracks to the gold and tin rushes.
In those days a white man had some heart to work.
No aliens then ; but as soon as the country is opened the
Government allows these colored curses to invade the
country. The Afghans are now building stores and hotels
.at Mt. Garnet, so that our member for Woothakata, who
is supposed to be among the main causes of the irruption,
together with Mr. John Moffat, Copper King of the north,
will have more to compete with than the carriage of ore
to the terminus. Our local member ought not to be so
greedy considering he was working in a road-party before
he got his stroke of luck in Herberton. My husband,
who is bordering on his 60th year, has been carrying for
the last 30 years and has eight children to work for; the
camels’ coming has utterly ruined us. P.S.—There are 80
camels at Mt. Garnet and 14 died coming over. Twenty
Afghans passed through Mareeba to Mt. Garnet about
three weeks ago. People were wondering if they wanted
them all for driving camels ; but they want them to
build hotels and stores. [The camel is wanted ; the
Afghan isn’t. White men can manage camels just as well
as black. —Ed.]

“ J.s.” : A friend of mine who has a jib-

brain can only contain one idea at a time, there-
fore if you tap his shoe, it takes, his mind away
from the jibbing idea, and he’ll go like blazes.”-A
few davs later I met the experimenter, with his
head bandaged and his features badly damaged.
“ Hullo ! ” said I, “ didn’t it take that idea out of
his head ? ” “ Oh, yes,” said he, “ but he got hold
of another idea—to knock my skull m.” If five
stitches counted for anything, the neddy had
carried out his “ idea ” remarkably well, too.

Printed herewith is a picture of a portion
of a woolly-butt (E. longifolia) long known in
Oberon district, N.S.W., as the Handcuff-Tree.
The handcuffs seen protruding from the
wood are said to have been placed on a twig
of the tree when it was a sapling (about 70 years
ago) by one Paddy , who died in aforesaid
district five years ago at the great age of 104.
Paddy was a convict, who, after obtaining a
ticket-of-leave, again got into trouble while work-
ing on a Hawkesbury River farm. He absconded,
but was soon afterwards captured by two troopers,
who camped with him for the night. Next morn-
ing, one of the troopers having gone after the
horses, which had strayed some distance, Paddy
managed to get hold of a shovel, blinded his re-
maining guardian with a shovelful of hot ashes
from the fire, knocked the man senseless with the
implement, and made off. How he got the
“cuffs” off is not known, but it was on this occa-
sion that he concealed them in the sapling. The
section of the limb is now temporarily in the pos-
session of Mr. C. Foulkes, of Watson s Ray,
Sydney, having been recently cut-out by him, by
permission of the owner of the run on which the
tree stands.

she took to drink, and by last accounts the poor trull
was singing “ Boys of the Bull-dog Breed ” down Mile-
end Road Cash : “ Outstanding Premiums” are about
the best item in a life society’s assets ; the society has
security for them in the surrender value of the policies.
And if you object to “ accrued interest ” being reckoned
—well, do you suspect that the State Governments won’t •
pay their next half-year’s interest ?.... J.H. : “ Lesson in
Finance” is a dialogue built on the usual lines. Your
man uses the weakest possible arguments, but the other
fellow, instead of knocking them endways, is covered
with confusion E. and 0.E.: Can’t think of the right
disrespectful thing to say about “Mirage,” but feel dis-
respectful right enough Meagles : But with all your
howl about what Crick hasn’t done for the N.S.W. selec-
tors you are as indefinite as 1000 other correspondents as
to what Crick should have done for the selectors. If the
selector would carefully analyse his indefinite sense of
injury, probably the worst grievance is that Crick didn’t
make it rain. The best Minister of Lands in dry weather
is worse than the worst one in wet weather... .Polype :
111 written, scrappy, almost undecipherable, interlined
till it is a misery, and not a ghost of a story in it after
all—only a lot of shouts, blots and hints Tas. : Ex-
penditure of United Kingdom (year ended 31st March,
1900), £133,722,406; United States expenditure about
£124,000,000. War expenses upset the calculations
in each case, but the cost of governing the
United Kingdom is the larger as a regular thing....
A.C.H.: Both are the kind of thing that has been
done too often already and wasn’t worth doing Natif:
Dull catalogue of brutality.. ..Nitellub: We’ve got de-
scriptions of the Awful Flag-Flapping Fiasco from about
200 different towns, and they’re mostly crowded out
J.0.R.: (1) All the N.S.W. Government’s expenditure is
shown clearly enough in the Govt. Gazette. (2) N.S.W.
expenditure for 11 months to May 31st was about
£12,817,490 (this includes loan expenditure). There is
nothing so very unusual in the mere amount, for N.S.W.
has spent about £13,000,000 a year (including loan expen-
diture) for the last 10 years. The average would have been
higher, but for Dibbs’s economy with the loan funds
Llgrope: The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Co. of

W.J.D. : Pretty good material, but you can’t handle it
effectively Clotho : Too cerulean of hue D. 1.8. :
You prance around magnificently, but you never get to
anywhere Vulcan : You haven’t a ghost of an idea of
the subject. All your arguments are based on the theory
that the 7s. a day is a uniform wage instead of a mini-
mum wage. Also you wail greatly about the old man
who will be sacked and left unemployed, and the young
“ bloke” who will be taken on instead. The onlyadvantage
of your plan is that the old man will get a job at low
wages, and the young “ bloke” be unemployed. Suppose,
instead of talking about the awful things that will happen
under the minimum wage, you look at those Melbourne
trades where the minimum wage has existed longest,
and see if any of these dreadful things have happened—
F. : The Bulletin isn’t a muck-heap ! Fardowner :
Not taking any auctioneers' wit, thanks ...Prospector:

R.F. : Good little Sunday-school tale of honest, struggling
family rewarded by legacy of £SOOO—G.G. : Madden

Board as to the basis upon which the re-grading of the
civil service is determined. Don’t you wish you may get
it 1 Certainly, “ the office ” was given out, but there is
no regulation governing the point, nor is the Board
directed to follow any particular method Leo. W. :
No time to write private letters on such subjects. You
are an extremely querulous contributor, and would, if
you had your way, bring the work of this office to a dead
atop O.A. :As things are, it is mostly those who have
daily business to attend to who are habitually summoned
as jurors. There is, in- any case, something very rotten
about the way jury-lists are compiled ; some unfortunates
being persistently “ stuck,” while other persons, not any
more legally exempt, are just as persistently passed over.
Elo (M.L.) : “ The Bulletin’s attitude on the Trans-
vaal War must have lost it many friends,” you say. Per-
haps so ; but all the same The Bulletin is to-day a more
prosperous paper than it has ever been before during all
its 21 years’ career Mac :It is expedient in Hansard
to observe a happy medium between reporting absolutely
verbatim and making speeches for members. The thing
to be aimed at, of course, is conveying an honest impres-
sion of the speaker’s intention. Well-considered speeches,
on important themes are, of course, best given verbatim..

able, but the blanket business interests us H.J.B. :
Good verses here and there; rest commonplace....

A Grocer’s Complaint.
Mr. F. H. Thomas, who carried on a grocery
store in Palace-street, Petersham, for several
years, has been long enough in the business to
know what he is talking about. Upon hearing
that he desired to ventilate a certain grievance,
a reporter called upon him, with the following
“We believe you have been complaining of
some hardship in the trade,” said the pressmen.
“Yes,” said Mr. Thomas, “I have found the
work rather heavy, for in these days of ‘ cut’
prices, great economy is necessary; this is
generally so when one is looking after their own
business. What I chiefly complained of was that
after serving behind the counter most of the day,
T would have to leave the shop and go out
delivering with my cart, no matter what the
weather was like. The sudden change from a
warm shop to the driving rain was neither pleasant
nor healthy. Lung, troubles resulted, and 1. began
to suffer from shortness of breath, particularly at
night. I became weak and bloodless, and unnatur-
ally despondent. Sometimes T woke at night
gasping for breath, and my ill-health and decline
was a subject of remark by my friends. Despite
the use of different medicines, I continued to get
worse, so I consulted a leading Sydney doctor. I
was horrified to learn that I was suffering from
asthma and consumption. For twelve months I
was under medical treatment, but received little
benefit.”
“No doubt you took further action,” suggested
the reporter.
“Yes,” replied Mr. Thomas, “ a relative who
had been cured by Dr. Williams’ pink pills for
pale people recommended me to try them. After
some hesitation I did so. Two boxes enriched my
blood and strengthened my lungs, and I was so
pleased with the medicine that I continued taking
it until cured. 1 can honestly say that Dr.
Williams’ pink pills freed me from every symptom
of asthma and consumption when the best medical
treatment seemed powerless.”
Since the above interview, Mr. Thomas has dis-
posed of his Petersham business, and is now
engaged in the storekeeping trade in Quean bey an.
Weak, bloodless, nerveless people are especially
liable to be attacked by winter ailments, such as
asthma, bronchitis, consumption, rheumatism,
neuralgia, sciatica, coughs and colds, etc. Dr.
Williams’ pink pills make weak people strong, and
thus enable them to resist or throw off the above
diseases. They also cure St. Vitus’ dance, rickets,
skin disorders, paralysis, locomotor ataxia, etc.
Sold ,by chemists and storekeepers, and by the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place,
Sydney, two and nine per box, six boxes fifteen
and three, post free. Substitutes are dangerous.

“ I want you Freetraders to nail the Freetrade flag on to Mr.

The idea of a Fat Man nailing the Freetrade flag to a bald-headed’

POLITICAL
POINTS
For the very first time, Broken Hill miners,
hitherto politically the solidest of workers, are
allowing sectarianism to set them at one another’s
throats.
Nemesis ? J. J. Moloney opposes Dan
O’Connor as candidate for the Phillip Division
m the coming N.S.W. election. “ Appint
Moloney ! ”
The gradual encroachment of the sleepless
■Jingo : The Federal Senate has altered the Con-
stitution phrase “Parliament” in the enacting
words of bills to “King’s Most Excellent
Majesty and Senate and House of Representa-
tives.”
The ami able-Beaueham p only- last month
ceased to draw Governor’s pay. He spent 18
months in Australia (a good deal of the time
travelling outside N.S.W.) but on retiring received
six months’ leave, .“not on full pay,” but half.
He left on Nov. Ist, and his pay thus ceased on
May Ist last.
Senator M‘Gregor badly wants to know
why Britain should be so anxious not to offend the
sensibilities of the foreign Japanese by excluding
them from Australia, when it doesn’t mind offend-
ing about 51 millions of the people of the United
Kingdom by using unpleasant expressions re
their religion in the coronation oath.
Sydney Mayor Graham is standing for
N.S.W. Parliament. An interjector at one of his
meetings cried, “Too many billets altogether!”
Right! The Mayor’s job is surely big enough for
any one man (especially if he happens to be a
practising doctor !). Dr. Graham’s craving for the
other job is mere greed of Importance.
It looks very much as though Warrior
Sleath, Labor-M.L.A., will go underat Wilcannia
in the State election. The opal-gougers at White
Cliffs, who boss this electorate, were willing to
forgive him much, but not the military craze ;and
so they are running a candidate of their own
choosing—a brother of Labor M.L.C. Buzacott.
THE N.S.W. GENERAL ELECTIONS.—
WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO.
SATAN (to St. Progressive and St. Liberal):
“Now you two, keep your eye on the vote,
and don't forget that the biggest liar gets it."
Both on the goldfields and about Perth,
NVestralian Laborites are just now in a state of
deplorable disruption. Each lot is about equally
divided ; and one half is busy calling the other
half “blackleg” and “scab.” The row in the
Perth Trades and Labor Council resulted lately in
both president and vice, throwing up their thank-
less jobs.
The faces of Sargood, Zeal, and Fraser are
wonderful sights to see when radical Senators
-tribe in the old Vic. Leg. Council Chamber, and
breathe brutally Republican sentiments with un-
blushing freedom. All three shrink visibly in
anticipation of the falling roof. By the way, the
daily press seems to have entered into a “con-
soiracy of silence ” re the anti-imperialism of
several Senators.
Though there are scores of needy old
fellows at Broken Hill only 25 applications for
old-age pensions have been lodged there. The
rest of the ancients haven’t been the necessary
quarter-century in the State j for B.H. consists
mainly of people from the nearer centres of South
Australia and Victoria. Wanted, a Federal
pensi on-scli erne.
Queensland Labor-men are battlers, and
110 mistake ! They growled and grumbled the
other day at Gympie because of 3142 on the roll
only 2254—72 per cent.—voted. Yet compare
that with the 35 per cent, of votes cast the week
before in S.A., when Labor-leader Batchelor’s and
other seats had to be filled. But it paid—the
Northerners won and the Southerners lost.
Lord Beauchamp, speaking at his welcoine-
’Ome :
In conclusion, his lordship said that so long as the
people of New South Wales, and Australia generally,
showed their sympathy with the British Empire, and so
long as they realised that not selfishness, or their own
interests, but the good of others was the thing to be
sought after, they need not fear. (Applause.)
In a word, Australia is in business “for the good
of others.”
Gr. H. Reid, the other night, publicly
alluded to N.S.W. Works Minister O’Sullivan
(apropos of the latter’s attack on the daily press)
as “an inkslinger himself for many years on an
obscure journal in whose religious beliefs we do
not all agree.” The Bulletin never thought so
badly of G. H. Reid (aspirant to the Common-
wealth Premiership) as to believe that he could
gratuitously make such a remark as that in this
sectary-cursed country.
“In concluding, he (the Duke of York)
said he would carry away lasting impressions of
Maoriland and its people.”—S.M. Herald.
The Duke has sanctified the name
That once the Herald banned ;
Good loyalists will use the same,
And local poets, wild or tame,
In nimble-footed lines or lame,
Will call their country grand—
“ My own—my Maoriland.”
A recent Bulletin par. reported the
deplorable total absence of anything in the shape
of a trade or labor union at Pt. Pirie, South Aus-
tralia’s second town. Adelaide Laborites, who
are terribly tired, would do nothing; so the
Broken Hill unions sent missionaries over the
border, and already close upon 500 men have been
enrolled in a couple of societies. The fact that
half-and-half Labor-M.P. Roberts (who has been
away lately Boer-ohasing) hasn’t helped at all has
been pasted in several hats.
“Pukaki”: Not only is the Jingo fever
taking longer to die in Maoriland than elsewhere,
but it is strongest among the workers. The local
Fatman, indeed, is getting visibly sick of the
whole thing. In Maoriland Fatman has to bear
his fair share of taxation ; wherefore his enthusi-
asm in the cause of Hempire is already a thing of
the past. The worker, on the other hand, knows
he hasn’t to pay more than his fair and honorable
whack, and being more ready to part than the
Bulgy One, he has still a little whoop left.
The Federal Government made a big mis-
take when it put seven of its members into the
House of Representatives and only two (one of
them an honorary) into the Senate, It evidently
couldn’t get over the idea that the Senate was a
formal perfunctory place something like a State
Upper House. The Senate is as representative of
the people, and almost as powerful and as much
alive, as the House of Reps., and Minister Drake,
who plays a lone hand there most of the time,
grows tired and hoarse trying to be a whole Minis-
try by himself.
It becomes clear despite the cableman’s
efforts to put a good face on things, that the
Chamberlain crowd are growing most uneasy.
London Times finds it necessary to screw up their
resolution by telling them they “should continue
the war in S’Africa until the Boers own that they
are finally defeated. The nation does not want a
patehed-up peace.” Just so ; but every nation
has to put up with what it can get; and, judg-
ing by present appearances, that will be a very
poor return for over £160,000,000 in money, and
perhaps 60,000 men dead or crippled.
One half the Federal Senators are to re-
tire every three years, and the question of which
half retires first is making much needless trouble.
The idea of settling the question by lot— i.e., by
gamble—is not only crude, but it is utterly illogi-
cal on the part of a Parliament which is so much
shocked at Tattersall. In each State the three
Senators who got the smallest vote should go out
first. They are obviously the three that the
people value least, and that the people selected
with the greatest amount of hesitation, and these
are good enough grounds to go upon.
M'Gowen, M.L.A. : “ There are only two
factors in all production—land and labor.” Sheer
foolishness. There is a third factor, and the name
of it is Intelligence. A man without any land,
and born without hands and feet, may, if he has a
great thinking capacity, add more to a nation’s
wealth than 20,000 misdirected hand-toilers will
do in a century. Out in Western N.S.W. there
are regions where much land and 10 years of labor
have produced less than nothing the product
hasn’t made up for the loss of the original capital,
to say nothing of loot lives and lost hopes and lost
years. That was land and labor, without the
intelligence to make good use of them.
One can get a pretty good idea of the
land-law reforms that they want most in the
droughty west (N.S.W.) by noting the points on
which all the party candidates are practically
agreed. For the squatter even the Labor candi-
dates are demanding extension of leases to 42
years at least (it is 28 at present) ; for the selee-
TO BE OR NOT TO BE.
MR. NEEDY: “ How can I live without you?”
MISS PLENTY: “I'm sure I don’t know —unless
you work."
tor, extension of area (present max., 10,240ae.).
A popular “ plank ” is the taking over bodily of
squattages most suitable for selection, on payment
of compensation and appraised value for improve-
ments, and an accompanying provision allowing
the selector to pay rent for these improvements
instead of capital value. The latter generally
oripples him at the start.
PATRONAGE.
The Dook has cabled home to his august
Dad to the effect that “good is likely to result to
the Empire from his (the Book’s) visit.”
The greatest Empire time has ever seen
On Earth’s green lap,
Is better now than it has ever been,
Since he its outer boundaries has seen—
That little chap.
He makes us smile, the little Dook, yet he
Is not alone
In thinking thus, for (whisper) so do we !
But what is for the Empire good may be
Bad for the Throne.
S.M. Herald, commenting on the recent
casualty to Victorians in S’Africa :
Australians will be now more than ever convinced that
the only feasible reward for their patriotic participation
in the war is the emphatic crushing of the existing
opposition.
Which is pretty “ pure,” even for Granny. The
war is to be prosecuted with extra ferocity because
a party of Australian swaddies allowed themselves
to be surprised and shot down. Will Granny
advise the Commonwealth Government to under-
take the conquest of S’Africa at a cost of £1,500,000
per week ? Or does she really think that Cham-
berlain, who won’t consent to the exclusion of the
Jap, will persist in a fruitless war because a few
Australian Jingoes ask him to ?
Senator M‘Gregor’s straight out advocacy
of a State lottery, such as brings in £2,500,000 a
year to the Italian treasury, and materially helps
the revenues of Denmark, Austria, Spain, &c., has
much to recommend it, both commercially and
morally. While Sydney is simply full of betting-
shops which the police are quite unable to find
though the owner’s well-known name is glaring at
them from the signboard, and the illegal tote
flourishes in some places and the legal one in
others, and the betting odds are quoted publicly
in the daily papers, and the country has either to
choose between seeing its money go to Tattersall
at Hobart, or to Tattersall at Noumea when he
is turned out of Hobart, it is mere snuffle to say
that an honestly-conducted State lottery can
make Australia any worse than it is.
The June bye-elections in Victoria gave a
nasty knock to the Trades Hall Laborites.
Lemmon, at Footscray, failed to hold Hancock’s
old seat, lately vacated by Samuel Mauger. A local
salesman Jacob Fotheringham beat him by
45 votes in a very heavy poll. At Fitzrdy,
O’Connor —a Richmond tailor and Board o’ Works
Commissioner, posing as a Laborite—got the
nomination of the Fitzroy League, but was
rejected by the Political Labour League (for
having opposed Tudor for Yarra) in favor of
M'Grath, ex-tram conductor, and sec. of Bread-
Carters’ Union. The local workers resented this
dictation, and O’Connor came out on top with 1187
votes ; then followed three other candidates with
1021, 942, and 548, and M'Grath was absolute last
with 478. So O’Connor goes in pledged to the
Labor platform, .and is responsible to the local
Labor League—same as his colleague Billson.
Yet the Labor party in Parliament denounces
and repudiates him. The Political Labor League
is making a beautiful mess of things.
If Peacock and Co. get through the session
it will be purely on their luck. They are a talking-
rather than a doing
crowd. Already they
have spent more hours
in Cabinet than there are
days in the session. It
is rarely a Minister is to
be found in his depart-
ment, but he can always
be got at a Cabinet meet-
ing. So far, Peacock’s
luck is carrying all before
it. In the first place, he
was lucky to miss being
branded by the Dooko-
york. Then that dull
equity lawyer, Irvine,
was appointed Opposi-
tion leader, and now he
has resigned in such a
way thatthe Opposition
is scattered to the forty-
four winds of the vast Exhi-
bition building. Unless the
Tory party can induce Irvine •
to withdraw his resignation
it will meet the House with-
out a leader at all. The fact
that Outtrim, Kirton, and
Graham, who were Pea-
cock’s bitterest enemies-
after the Turner Govt,
was defeated, have crept
quietly round to the
Opposition cross benches
is a sure sign that they
want "to get back to
the old fold. Looking at
things as they stand now, it would seem that the
Tory party is practically extinct in Victoria.
Ex-Premier Reid in his late Sydney
speech : .
We got the expenditure (of loan money) down to some-
thing like £2,000,000 a year, which was a safe amount. . .
I was exposed to torrents of abuse because I kept the
public expenditure firmly within limits, and would not
allow these cursed deficiencies to grow under my ad-
ministration.
Both bosh, as usual ! Dibbs got the loan expendi-
ture down to £1,330,000, and Reid, after following
the same economical policy for 18 months, gob
tired and put it up—not down—to over £2,000,000.
Also Reid was a good deal abused for his deficit#
(according to the Auditor-General, £573,127 in
1896, £213,470 in 1897, and other sums), and used
to moan considerably about the injustice of it.
The present bright and frisky statement that he
was abused for not having deficits is something
quite new, even for Reid. .
Almost every week a grieved member of
the (N.S.W.) See Government rises to state that
owing to the tangled condition of the land titles
in Sydney’s resumed area it has been quite im-
possible so far to settle up the claims. This
may be so—or it may be that after borrowing
about £3,500,000 in 12 months the See Govern-
ment hardly knows where to raise another million
or so. But the interesting point is, that no
Minister rises to explain why the See crowd treats
the rents of the resumed area as ordinary revenue,
and spends them as such, well knowing that they
will be wanted to pay arrears of interest on the
purchase money. N.S.W. is just screaming for
information on that point and can’t get it, while
the question that N.S.W. didn’t ask is being
answered till N.S.W. is tired of hearing the
a nswer.

squabbling ; still further to the rear, three drunken

Commonwealth hurries, we’ll soon be past saving.


Griffith, M.L.A. (N.S.W.): —
He refused to defend the Government for not having a
final session of Parliament as requested by the Labor
Party, and he assured his hearers that if when Parliament
did meet it was found that the finances were not being
honestly administered, that £150,000 of trust money and
a quarter of a million of loan moneys had been used as
revenue, as had been alleged, and that the colony was
drifting towards a big deficit, the Labor Party could be
relied upon to do its duty to the electors by removing the
Government from office.
In other words, if, when Parliament meets, the
Labor Party finds that Queen Anne is dead, it
will take any action that may be necessary.
Statistician COGHLAN has been showing for
Heaven knows how many years how the loan-
moneys are misapplied, and the latest misappro-
priation of the trust funds is clear to anyone who
takes the trouble to read the receipts and expendi-
ture accounts in the Government Gazette.
Also, the long, ghastly procession of deficits glares
forth in the Auditor-General’s reports regularly.
If the Labor Party is only beginning to find out
these things it is time N.S.W. got a new Labor
Party —one that is a trifle swifter on its feet.

The plague rat will yet be the salvation of
Brisbane and Townsville. These cities are about
the most unsavoury and insanitary conglomera-
tions of houses in Australia. The state of such
quarters as Petrie Terrace (Brisbane), where
plague is just now prevalent, would disgrace a
backyard in Canton. But now the authorities
have to clean-up, and the ultimate result will be
an unmixed blessing. By the way, there are still
plenty of rats in Sydney. A trap set on George-
street premises, near Hunter-street, last week,
caught 40 in a single night.

Read what VITADATIO is Doing-
Consumption can be Cured!
READ WHAT MR. FRED. STEVENSON SAYS
VITADATIO
HAS DONE FOR HIM.
Dungog, July 17, 1900.
Mr. S. A. PALMER.
Dear Sir, —For over two years I suffered from what the
doctors here told me was consumption, and during that
time I suffered considerably and could not get any relief.
Seven times I broke a blood-vessel, and gave up all hope
of recovery. The doctors told me they could not do me
any good, and gave me up. It was then that I heard of
VITADATIO, and I determined to try it. The first bottle
did me a deal of good, and after taking twelve bottles I
can now say I am quite cured. Twelve months ago I
weighed under nine stone, and to-day I was weighed at
your representative’s request, and was just ten stone
eight pounds, and am now working on the roads as
maintenance man, and well able to do a hard day’s work
as well as I could years ago. lam well known here and
will do all in my power to persuade others who are suffer-
ing to try your medicine.
(Signed) FREDERICK STEVENSON,
Government Maintenance Man.
Dungog, N.S.W.
I have read the above carefully, and know it to be
correct, as I have known Frederick Stevenson during his
illness, and have watched his wonderful recovery ; he is
now quite well. I can also add that I have tried VITA-
DATIO for indigestion, and it has done me a wonderful
lot of good.
(Signed) EDWARD PIPER, J.P.

The Talune Mystery—the Last.
As usual, the third trial ended on a Friday morn-
ing, with a crowded court and an even larger-than-
usual proportion of morbid-minded females, who
had flocked into the audience in the hope of seeing
how a woman would bear herself in the supreme
moment of being told that a jury of men had
decided she should be choked to death.
The hand of the clock trembled a few minutes
past ten. There was something ominous about
the court. The two detectives who had “ worked
up ” the case against accused vvere absent, and
the regular habitues said it indicated that they
knew the jury would return a verdict of guilty,
and did not care to be present to see their
victim sentenced to death. Apparently the
hardened detective is superior to the female
criminal-court lounger. .
A man in a frock-coat appeared carrying a staff
surmounted with a small gilded crown. Behind
him walked one in a black kniekerbocker suit and
white cravat. Last, and most impressive, stalked
Judge Owen —he looks very grim in a wig in the
red robe of his office. These officials, for whom
the Law has usurped the prerogative of Divinity
and arrogated the lordship of life and death,
swept up into the canopied seat, took their places
with an impressive dignity and commenced to
write. The man in black was the Sheriff the
real hangman, though he employs Nosey Bob to
break necks for him.
MRS. JANE SMITH, three times tried at Sydney
on a charge of poisoning Patrick Conway on
board s.s. Talune, and now discharged from
custody.
Photo, by Kerry, Sydney.
Through a door in the northern wall came a
straggling line of men to the jury box. When
they were set, the Judge looked up from his
writing and asked had they agreed upon a
verdict. “No!” said the foreman rising to his
feet. “ Let him be sworn ! ” snapped His
Honor. Down in the dock the woman sat like
a statue. A smile played round the mouth of
solicitor Moss, the underground engineer of the
defence. In a few seconds the jury were dis-
charged and the Grown Prosecutor asked that Mrs.
Smith be bound over on her own recognisances to
appear when called upon. She stepped out of
the spiked dock with alacrity, and, walking
round, stood impassively before the Associate,
who, after some delay, gabbled off something
about appearing when called upon, and not leaving
the State without the permission of the Court
under pain of forfeiting £4). Mrs. Smith bowed
her head, and the Associate fell back into his
seat. Then she walked out of the door without
the slightest sign of emotion, closely followed by
her solicitor.
I stepped into the office of Solicitor Moss. A
quietly-dressed woman looked at me with a pair
of hazel eyes—eyes so soft that it would be hard
to Delieve their owner could possibly screw up her
destructive faculties sufficiently to destroy even a
fly in cold blood. She shook hands, and I noticed
that her brown hair was wavy, and her com-
plexion, in spite of 16 weeks imprisonment, pink
and white. She is intensely feminine, and speak'-
with a low, pleasant voice.
“Yea, thank you ; I’m beginning to feel better
now I had a good sleep yesterday and last night,
and when I woke this morning there was some-
thing pleasant in the air. I feel as though 1 am
just getting over the effects of a heavy blow ; a
little dazed, you know ; I felt that way all through
the trials after I really grasped the fact that all
those men in uniforms, and wigs, and gowns were
deciding whether poor me should be allowed to
live or taken out and murdered by a hangman.
“It takes some time to realise! that your hie is
really in danger. All those men looked pleasant
and human, and that they were mostly there try-
ing to hang me seemed quite impossible gradu-
ally I began to know it was so, and, at first, 1
felt that I must laugh or cry myself mad, and
then I just felt crushed. The feeling has not all
gone yet, and I am afraid sometimes that I shall
wake up and find lam dreaming in the dock. i
suppose it will go away in time.
“ It was dreadful sitting there all those days
with hundreds of eyes fixed upon me I knew
they were all looking at me. I could feel their
eyes from every part of the court. I m very
grateful to some of the papers for their impar-
tiality-impartiality is a great boon nowadays.
Strange that one of the daily papers the one
paper that appears to have all the smart men of
the continent on its staff —didn’t know enough, or
hadn’t instincts decent enough, to give a woman a
fair trial for her life. , . -
“ I’m not going away ; I m going to stay herein
Sydney. We haven’t the money to go back to
Maoriland. The costs of the trial have abso-
lutely ruined us. My husband had to give up his
position to come over here to be with me all
through this horrible time. We had to part with
our little property to save my life, and now we
are down to our last shilling, and are both trying
to get work immediately.
“I suppose it will be very hard to get a start.
Judging by the conversations I have heard in the
trams, and' some of the press remarks, there is a
strong prejudice against me. When I was going
out to Stanmore, after leaving the court, some
women were talking about it, and agreed that I
ought to be burnt alive, and, not knowing who I
was, appealed to me for concurrence. I said some-
thing about the fearful strain of three trials, and
got out into the street. That makes me think it
will be hard to get a start. . . , ,
“ The gaol authorities were very land indeed.
I had everything I could wish. The food was
good and the bed was from the hospital and very
comfortable. All that I complain of is a rule that
a woman while on her trial has to be accompanied
everywhere by a male warder. It s monstrous j
there are female warders, but it was only by the
repeated applications of Mr. Moss that I managed
to have the male replaced by a woman official.
HERMES.
There are two bands in Emmaville (N.S.
Wales), both of which claim the ownership of a
certain drum. Tom Chandler, J.P. and tin-
buyer, has to settle the ownership, and as he is
running for the State Parliament as a candidate
for Glen Innes electorate, each band threatens, if
it doesn’t get the drum, to vote against him. Also
as Chandler is away electioneering, and will pro-
bably not be able to settle the thing in time, pro-
bably both bands will vote against him, so as to
make sure of revenge in case of losing. The
Bulletin advises T.C. to kick holes in the drum
in question and present a new drum each to the
two bands before election-day.

The worst thing about royalty is the
poetry that is made concerning it. For instance,
the Singapore paper threw this remarkable pro-
duction after the Yorks when they exited from
that black-and-tan seaport■
Welcome ! thrice welcome ! our future King .
Singapore hails you and the would-be Queen.
While we deplore, our “ Mother Queen s death,
Providence so willed it, amidst universal reg e .
Accept our hospitality, sincere and true,
In point of loyalty, can excel us a few.
In the midst of bereavement, too sad to forget,
Duty before everything, the wisest of precept.
England’s honor, uphold at any cost,
Long live Britons, their fame ne er lost
Our volunteers ready at our noble King s cal ,
Our lives, our blood, our all in all ,
Command our services, our gallantry behold,
His enemies shall fly, in numbers untold.
Liberty of thoughts, action and speech.
Even-handed justice to both poor and the rich.
“ Defender of the faith,” religion and creed,
Independent of the caste, color and breed.
Mav this voyage be productive of good,
Mentally, bodily and politically too.
Seeing with one’s eyes, hearing with one s ears,
Is better than book-study for years and years.
All England’s eyes, your movements do watch,
They measure your words—they scan your thoug ts.
Noble son of a noble sire— _
Almighty grant your noble desire.
Singapore bids you most hearty farewell.
With sincere blessings, no tongue can tell.
Long live the King, his shadow ne er grow less,
The “ Queenly Queen ” may God ever bless.
One more request and we will have done
“TELL PAPA WE AKE HAPPY” on your return.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps y <ur knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for 1 CAIN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL.. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

“ The Echuca Miracle.'
In the town of Echuca a case has recently
occurred which is the talk of the town and district.
People marvel and cannot believe what their eyes
have seen. Mr. Michael O’Brien is a respected
citizen, and well known in the community, and
the public can vouch for this remarkable restora-
tion to health and happiness. He relates his ex-
perience, sufferings and cure:—“l have been a
great sufferer dur-
ing the last three
years, and have
tried most patent
medicines which are
being advertised ;
also three doctors
of this town and two
in Melbourne, and
received but little
benefit from any of
the same. I was in
a very bad state, and
had lost all hope of
recovery, when,
luckily for me, a
small book was left
at my house, and
this (upon reading the cases that had been cured
by your Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills), at once
put new hope in my heart, and I at once pur-
chased a bottle from Mr. Cunningham, the local
chemist, and upon using this bottle of your pills,
I found they had made a great improvement in
my health ; so I again purchased in all eight
bottles, and am now in the best of health, which I
owe to your Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. My
case was one of severe indigestion, being informed
by the doctor to that effect. You may publish
this as you think fit, as it may be the means
of helping those who may suffer from a similar
complaint; and being well known in this town, I
am sure there are numbers of my friends who will
confirm all I have said in this letter.” Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood
purifier, and a positive cure for biliousness, indi-
digestion, constipation, headaches, sallow com-
plexion, liver and kidney troubles, piles, pimples,
boils and blotches, and female ailments. Sold by
chemists and storekeepers, Is. per bottle, or

SPORTING NOTIONS.
At Caulfield, last Saturday, a very possible
winner of the forthcoming V.R.C. G.N. Steeple was re-
vealed in old Lacebv, a cast-off from the Millers’ stable.
Laoeb.v bad run away with a stake at Sandown earlier in
the week, and on Saturday he took the Wanda Steeple-
chase just as easily. That is to say, he won by three
lengths after clouting the last fence. His legs are notun-
impeachable, and trouble may come to one of them
before the big Steeple falls due, but as long as he keeps
going satisfactorily the light-weighted Laceby will look
very dangerous. Among the hurdlers that ran at Caul-
field and showed Grand National pretensions Rackstraw
looked fairly promising. Rackstraw was the runner-up
to Aquarius last year. He seems to be getting back to
form. He is in clever hands, and with lCst. 51b. Yeoman’s
unlucky horse should run well.

Principal supporter of 1902 Champagne Stakes
(entries closed last week) is Mr. H. Richards (N.S.W.),
who has eight in—the get of Beauchamp, Simmer, Prince
Chester, Dalmeny, Yardley and Fucile. Mr. H. Ramsay
has five by Mostyn, and Mr. “ Bill ” Forrester a like num-
ber by Gaulus and Niagara. Other owners sending five
each are Messrs. W. H. Mate and “ Jimmy ” Wilson, jun.
The list also embraces brothers to Bobadil, Commander,
The Faithful, Malster, Reel and Hautvillers, half-brothers
to Portsea, Ibex, Johansen and The Palmer, sisters to
Haulette and Finland, and half-sisters to The Chevalier,
Hautain, Amberite, La Carabine, Hindoo and Australia,
as well as near relatives of Diffidence, Merriwee and
Wigelmar.
* * * *
Scobie’s elect should this year be a good murky
prophecy for Melb. Cup. He has entered 11, and last
year with only three he managed to dodge most of the
public.
* • * *
Bonnie Boy (winner of the big event at Canter-
bury Park, Saturday) once belonged to “ Bill ” Forrester,
and subsequently ran among the galloways during the
pony boom. He got back with the “ registered ” when
the embargo placed upon the little ’uns was lifted by the
A.J.C. Bonnie Boy raced about the Northern (N.S.W.)
rivers for some time, but since his return had done little
beyond getting just licked. Nothing had a hope against
him on Saturday. He was bred by Mr. E. Oatley by
Niagara from Bonnie Doon, the Tasmanian-bred mare, by
Manuka from Media by Peter Wilkins.
* * * *
Megaphone’s recent starting at Coonamble
(N.S.W.) races brings to mind that the great old wonder
has now seen 13 summers, and hadn’t been heard from
for some time till the recent announcement that he was
sold to someone somewhere for 21gs. Megaphone has
lived and been owned in Q., M.L., N.S.W. and Vic. at
different times. Many judges rated him Carbine’s equal.
At 3 years (carrying 8.4) he ran second to that flier
Bungebah (7.10) in A.J.C. Epsom, won the Squatters’
Handicap with 8.12, and on the third day, met Carbine,
Cuirassier and Cardigan at w.f.a. in the Craven Plate—
1J miles. Carbine lined up 7 to 4 “ on,” and Megaphone
same odds against. A tough tussle all the journey saw
Carbine win by less than a length. Stated that Mr. W.
T. Jones wanted to buy Megaphone before the race, but
the price didn’t suit him, and he gave the then owner
(Mr. O. E. Brown) £5OO for the call of Megaphone, after
the race, for £3300. Mr. Jones, however, dropped the
matter, and subsequently the late Mr. Donald Wallace
secured the nag. Megaphone proved a failure at the
stud.
* * • *
Died at Kelso (N.S.W.) t’other day Mr. W. M.
Kite, who, years ago, scored big successes at racing as well
as in breeding. Normanby (winner of Sydney Cup) and
Woolstone, who annexed two Tatts. Cups, were Mr. Kite’s,
also Dockairne, Dockwood, and others who left their
marks. It was he who brought out Maltese Cross in foal
tb Wild Oats, and Gozo, the famous Tucka Tuclta stallion,
was the foal. Gozo was Mr. Kite’s when he won A.J.C.
Maiden Plate in ’B6. His present owner is Mr. J. R.
Smith.

Some Towers’ tote dividends (tickets £1): Bob
Ray, £l5 10s. ; Little Joe, £8 ss. ; Regret, £33 15s. ;
Erin,£lllls.; Etnic,£ss9s.; Northern Light, £27105. The
books must have had a royal time if they stood up against
the favorites, which isn’t likely, for the Towers double
has always been a tempting bait for owners, and the local
Tommies still drop a heavy' tear at mention of Donizetti,
Beche-de-mer, or Black Harry'. It fact, some of the Doni-
zetti money is still owing.
* * * *
Little Joe, winner of Towers J. C. Handicap,
brought off a nicely-planned coup by a narrow margin.
Silva, the Towers Leviathan, bought this Gossoon 3-year-
old from W. Kelso specially' for the race and “ kept ” bim
in his big double book on the Towers and Milchester Han-
dicaps, thus utterly confounding backers. Silva has all
the luck of the Chosen ; he owned Coralie when she won
the Villiers and Carrington Stakes, and has now a
“ boshter” balance to his credit after taking the “ knock ”
in Brisbane 10 years ago.
* * • *
Reported that one-time great performer (in late
“ Bill ” Kelso’s stable) Loch Marie died, t’other day, soon
after slipping a Projectile foal, which is bad luck for the
Widdin stud proprietor, Mr. Joseph Thompson. Loch
Marie was a beauty by Lochiel from Barbara, by Bar-
barian (son of Sir Hercules) from Adeline by Kingston.
Big things were expected of her at the stud. L.M.’s best
season was as a five-year-old, when she annexed Moore-
field Flying Handicap (Bst. up), Moonee Valley Turkeith
Handicap (8.9), Williamstown Prince of Wales’ Plate (8.5),
Truganiua Stakes (10.9), A.J.C. Trial (8.5), and Villiers
Stakes. Two and a half years ago, humping 8.11, she
6quelched 37 others in Carrington Stakes, and, same
afternoon, was pulled out for the last race (the Pace
Welter) with 11.9 in the saddle, and won in a canter from
a big field, putting up 1.15 for six fur.
» * * *
Sundial, full brother to Waterbury, who raced
in Sydney y'ears back, fell in Auckland (M.L.) National
Hurdles, and then came out in Welter, downed a field of
19, and paid £54 6s.
♦ » * *
Cavaliero, by Cuirassier (son of Musket) from
Clio, is Maoriland’s premier small-stick horse; the
weight of 13.13 carried by him to the front in
Remuera Hurdles (Auckland) was the heaviest ever borne
locally. There were eight behind him ; minimum weight,
9st.
* * * *
An innovation adopted by Tahuna Park (M.L.)
Trotting Club, paying out on first and second horses,
proved a great success, tote total being £1865 over
amount machined at corresponding meeting last year.
The betting public thinks it can pick a winner in twice—
hence the increased speculation. A few good divs. were
gathered in, and only on one occasion did the second
horse pay more than the first.
* * • *
Someone has gone into the thing and ascertained
that since Paris showed the road five years back 30
Australian nags have gone ’Ome and all but about a fifth
have scored. Among those who didn’t do anything were
Aurum (the best of the lot) who went amiss, Amiable (a
flier here), Survivor, Stoccado (late Cranberry), Sailor Boy,
and a couple from Bananaland. Paris, Form, Acmena,
Calra, Old Clo, Newhaven, Australian Star, Merman, The
Grafter, Battalion and Georgic, have performed extra well,
while Achray, Ravensplume, Marrazonna, His Grace,
Tornado, Oban, Essex and S3'erla have succeeded in
getting away with minor events. Since ’97, the spoils
gathered in by the first-named batch embrace the
Cesarewitch, Cambridgeshire, Prince Edward Handicap
(twice), Lewes (five times), City and Suburban (three),
Northamptonshire Stakes, and Ascot and Goodwood
Cups. All this in face of the fact that not during any one
season have there been more than a score of Australian
nags at work.

L.’s standard. At time of whelping, Master Licorice, on
appearances, w'as considered the least promising of the
lot. He is 2yrs. and 6 months old, and scales 681bs.
Never gave any previous signs of being likely to win a
Waterloo Cup. Prior to the opening rounds £3CO at hun-
dreds to 6 was taken about his chance, but subsequently
he had very few admirers. Even when among the last
four of 64 nominated Master L. was the outsider, and so
little did his owner fancy him that Victorian courser
“ Fred ” Kenyon secured him for £5O. Worth recalling
that Master Licorice was in the last four of Belmore
Federal Cup a week or tw'o since, but Braddon’s Blot
beat him pointless. This time he put both veteran
Bladon’s top-notch Booty and Braddon’s Blot out. Master
Licorice’s previous best feat was dividing Candelo
(N.S.W.) Cup with Floss last year.

The other night, at Melb. Democratic Club,
dusky Peter Felix met old-timer Mick Dooley in pre-
sence of a £2OO-house. Betting at ringside, 4 to 1 on
Felix, with few takers. The black stripped lithe and
shiny, but one glance at Mick showed that condition and
he are henceforth strangers. Latter received a great
ovation from old sports present, and smiled his thanks in
his old, simple, childlike fashion. First sparring round
left him already laboring and Felix confident, and the
end was already plainly in sight. He W'as a mere punch-
ing-ball in the second bout, and was sent to the boards
for three periods of 9sec. in succession, without attempt-
ing to return a blow. A sigh of regret and relief w’ent
up when his seconds, in pity, caved in. It w'as a pathetic
sight to see old Mick with cut and bleeding nose, sitting
in his corner with downcast head, comforted like a child
by sorrowful followers. His days for the game have gone,
and should he tackle it again, all that is left of him should
be arrested for attempted suicide.

That whilom Australian 11.4 top-noteher, Dan
Creedon’s, apparent return to old time form was mis-
leading, as last month he met Marvin Hart, and, after the
most torrid thing in fist fights seen for years, was clean
knocked out in the sixth round. Operations were savage
from the jump. Dan’s left “peeper” was closed in the
second round, but he took heaps of stoush (half of which
would have shattered most ordinary bruisers) in the hope
of finding the fatal point. The fourth term found the
audience crazed with excitement, so vicious and stiff was
the punching. The gong’s sound saved Dan in the fifth
round, but he was too far gone to survive another.
Creedon is gray as the proverbial badger, and looks years
older than he really is.

Second round of Sydney senior grade Rugby
commenced on Saturday, and South Sydney is now top,
with ’Varsity and Eastern Suburbs bracketed, one point
less, second, and Glebe (10).fourth. Glebe accounted for
’Varsity—6 to 3 ; 6000 looked on. North Sydney and
Newtown played a draw —3 each. South Sydney beat
Balmain —7 to 6 (their second win in succession by 1
point), and Eastern Suburbs settled Western Suburbs—l 7
to 3.: Ultimate winners still seem very much hidden.
There are only 2 points difference in four clubs, which
means that half the original entrants are still well in the
running.

Australian cricketer Albert Trott recently had
a brace of eggs opposite his name in one match for the
first time. Playing for M.C.C. against Sussex he was
clean bowled by Bland in the initial effort, and next time
had his wicket shattered per medium of a brilliant throw-
in by Bland from mid-off. Albert got even though, for
he bowled Bland in the first innings and Bland was
caught off Trott’s work in the second. Trott’s average in
that match was 9 for 63.

Hampden Cup and attendant amateur golf
supremacy of N.S.W. was won, Saturday, on Aus-
tralian G.O. links, at Botany, by Mr. E. P. Simp-
son. Talk about a good all-round man 1 Competi-
tion extended over two days, and began on Bondi links
previous week, when ultimate winner did best by finish-
ing “ all square.” At Botany, he also led with 9 down.
Bogey was stiffened considerably this time, being brought
from 83 to 78 at Bondi, and 87 to 83 at Botany. Mr.
Simpson returned the best gross result in Saturday’s play
as well as the best individual round at each course. The
Cup was instituted in ’9B, and presented by Governor
Hampden. Mr. H. M‘Neil won on the first two occasions,
and Mr. E. J. B. Macarthur on the third, Mr. E. P. Simp-
son being runner-up each time.

Final heat of N.S.W. bowling “Champion of
Champions ” tourney (meaning champion of all defined
club champions, as distinct from the individual cham-
pionship for which any and every bowler may compete)
between “ Jim ” Hogue, M.P., and “Joe” Bradbury,
last year’s winner of the title, was decided last Saturday.
Bradbury led from the start, and at times was many
points to the good, but Hogue plodded along so effec-
tively that they tied thrice. Hogue opened the last
“ head ” two to the bad and drew a fine shot, but Brad-
bury “ rested ’’ it with a better, and won by 31 to 28. In
all 41 ends were contested. Bradbury now not only lords
it over the different club champions, but also over the in-
dividual champion of the State.

“Bias” : Bowlers’ methods of doing things are
as ancient as their game To-day we have two champions
of N.S.W. One (the “ individual champion ”) earned his
distinction by winning from all “ associated ” comers, the
other (the Champion of Champions) through beating pre-
viously singled Out chib top-nocchers. Among those who
went under in the competition won by the former was
the holder of the last-named title, who now turns round
and beats the individual premier. Truly matters are
very much mixed. Which is really the champion or the
better of the two ? Again, who comes better accredited
—the man who beats all club champions or the man who
accounts for all comers —champions or otherwise. To win
his particular title each had to compete in the event won
by the other.

Australian premier pigeon shot, Arthur Eales,
is making things hum “ down under.” Early last month
he whacked £33 stakes with another ; later he tied at the
fifth round with the English crack, Mr. Southby Hewitt,
and shared £67. That afternoon 16 kills out of 18 shot at
were credited to him. A day or two afterwards Mr.
Eales won a handicap, beating six opponents, and subse-
quently competed in a £3 sweep with £2O added, to
which 14 shooters subscribed. An English shot (Mr. Col-
lier) and Mr. Eales divided the £62 at the close of the
fourth round. T’other day Mr W. J. L. Eales’ brother
won the London Challenge Cup, shot for under the
auspices of the London Gun Club —an exclusive organisa-
tion. The excellence of Mr. Eales’ form and work just
now will be better understood when ’tis known that
they’ve got him at the almost shutting-out distance of
33Jyds. This is a yard further back than the recognised
British limit.

Burly Fred Cavill —channel and ocean swimmer,
and father of the world-famous family of natationists
owning his name —has thought out a new system of sight-
ing rifles —an automatic back-sight, which he claims ismore
simple, stauncher and more accurate than the present
method. Experts say the idea is all right. The Admiral
has sent a sample ’Ome in charge of'an officer of H.M.S.
Blake, who will explain the modus. Cavill pere is an old
soldier, and has smelt powder with a vengeance. Half a
century back he was one of the crew of the Royal yacht
Fairy, and was on that vessel when the late Queen led
Sir Chas. Napier’s Baltic fleet to sea from Spithead.
Later lie saw service in the Russian war, and was aboard
the Penelope frigate when she ran aground under the
Russian forts at Bomarsund in the Baltic, and remained
hard and fast for 3A hours, while the Muscovites poured
in red-hot shot and shell. The Penelope ultimately got
off after losing all her guns and a big percentage of the
crew killed and wounded. Cavill afterwards served in
the same vessel during the Mutiny, and since then 40
years of his life have been devoted to the Volunteer
cause. He is now on the retired list, with the rank of
staff-paymaster of the N.A.V’s.

A certain Parliamentary candidate is the hero
of the following. He attended a picnic of the local trades
a couple of years ago ; and condescended to join in the
contest for the “ blue ribbon” of the day—the old buffers’
race. He not only competed for but won the event, and
was duly invested with the “ ribbon ” —a pair of vases.
This year he was elected president of the trades associa-
tion, and in gratitude for the honor promised a handsome
prize for next sports meeting. The race for the presi-
dent’s prize created great and many envious
glances were thrown at.the winner as he went up to re-
ceive—the identical pair of vases which the president had
won two years before. To make it more bitter, the
winner of the president’s prize was the original donor of
the vases when won by that prudent gentleman. What
are that candidate’s chances of receiving the local Labor
vote?

One of the shows intended for the suffering
Yorks in ’Obart, is a grand champion wood-chop ; and
even this, after the Queensland chip-bursting, will have
but secondary interest. The stakes are good, and should
draw the first-flighters. Chellis, the Deloraine crack, if
on the spot will show well, and may just beat the best
’tothersider, or Pettitt, the champion.

Belford Buller, a St. Bernard, shown at Sydney
the other day, is 37in. high at the shoulder ; and there-
fore is placarded “ the tallest dog in the world.” Any-
way, a phenomenal height, seeing that anything over
30in. in a male and 27in. for the other sort is up to
standard—and “ the taller the better, provided the sym-
metry is maintained.” Barry and Simplon, the tallest
among famous modern St. Bernards, were only 32Jin.;
the former weighed 1501 b., the latter 1701 b. The Sydney
dog, though only 17 months old, is said to weigh 1751 b.

The annual output of Dunlop Midget Repair
Outfits by the Dunlop Tyre 00. throughout Australia is
140,000. This huge sale of Midgets affords a fair idea of
the number of cyclists throughout the Commonwealth.
“ The total value of presents given to the
Royalties, by the Maoris at Rotorua, is estimated
at £2000.” What a mean, cadging business this
monarchy is !
On the 31st March the American Tobacco Co.,
of New South Wales, placed a contract with Messrs.
Stuart Bros, for the erection of a new factory and offices
adjoining the Masonic Hall in Castlereagh-street, Sydney.
The time-limit of the contract is seven-and-a-half months,
as from the Ist June last. The building will be replete
with all the most modern appliances, machinery and con-
veniences, and it is the intention of the company to have
the star factory in Australasia.
Concerning the Royal visit to Maoriland .
King Richard went very near losing his mana over an
incident in connection with the ducal visit. He was
determined that the Royalties should see in M.L. some-
thing that they could not see anywhere else, and that it
should be something the recollection of which would be
likely ever to remain with them, as a testimony to his
genius as a host. He arranged for an old-time Maori
gathering at Rotorua, and at Rotorua there were as-
sembled some 5000 splendid specimens of the Maori
people, from the furthermost parts of the land
with one notable exception—and thereby hangs an
interesting story. The Auckland people had made up
their minds that the royalties on arriving in Auckland
harbor should have more than an ordinary wel-
come, and they set about arrangin': for a grand dis-
play by Maori war-canoes. It was proposed that Mahuta,
the Maori “ King,” should be asked to assemble his
people at Auckland, with their war-canoes, and go forth
at the right moment to welcome the son of the King in a
manner that for once in a way would dispel “ that tired
feeling” from his face. King Mahuta consented, and it
was arranged that he should present the Duke and
Duchess with an address of welcome on behalf of the
Maori people. King Richard, however, said “No,” and
his word, as usual, was law, but it was the most un-
popular thing he ever did, and it will not be
forgotten for a very long time in Auckland. King
Richard said that it would never do to recognise
Mahuta in this way ; that he was no more a king than a
dozen other Maori chiefs, and that to give him promin-
ence on such an occasion would offend the whole of the
other tribes who had agreed to assemble at Rotorua to
meet the Duke. The Aucklanders declined to take King
Dick seriously; they said they didn’t specially want
Mahuta, but they did want an old-time war-canoe display,
and they would have it. A lot of money was collected
and arrangements were made to get several hundred
natives and a number of canoes down from the King
Country, but somehow or other—nobody seems to know
exactly why—the affair never came off. The Premier has
had to bear the brunt of it, and at the reception he was
actually hooted for his opposition to the scheme. This
was anything but pleasing to Seddon, who is
really very popular with the crowd, and it went hard with
him that it should appear otherwise in the presence of
the Duke. He has been at pains to explain that neither
himself nor the Govt, nor any Govt, department put
difficulties in the way of the canoes being carried to
Auckland per rail, but nothing will remove the unpalat-
able fact that he was acually hooted in the presence of
Royalty.
The Duke, or whoever was responsible for the pro-
gramme of the ceremony in connection with the landing
at Auckland, made one unfortunate blunder for which
the mothers of the Northern City will never forgive him.
For weeks previous to the arrival of 11.R.H. some
thousands of children and teachers belonging to the
public schools had been assiduously practising a display
known as “The Living Union Jack.” Much time and
pains had been taken in rehearsing, and a lot of money
spent in decking so many little ones out in dresses of
appropriate color and design. An incident of the display
was to be the singing of “God Save the King.” Two hours
before the time appointed for Royalty to pass that particu-
lar spot the young people and their instructors assembled,
and they went through that weary wait with exemplary
patience, believing that eventually they would be re-
warded by a sight of their future King amd Queen.
Judge then of the surprise of the children and the multi-
tude that had assembled there when the Royalties drove
past without stopping, and without indicating in any way
that they were pleased with the exhibition. There was
keen heartburning over the incident, and the slight was
felt so severely that the latter part of the Children’s
programme was not carried out. The thing rankles
deeply in the breasts of the mothers of Auckland.
The Duke of Cornwall was never so near “ the infernal
regions ” as when he visited Tikitere, a few miles’ drive
from Rotorua, the Maori wonderland. The sights of Tiki-
tere must be approached on foot, and for a considerable
distance as one wanders around, with crumbling pumice
underfoot, boiling mud and water, and hissing steam all
around, great care has to be exercised to avoid getting
scalded or worse. The Duke escaped scatheless,
and without the least indication of uneasiness saw
all there was to be seen. Capt. Pont, of the Govt,
steamer Tutanekai, who was with the party, had, how-
ever, less good fortune, for he put one foot through the
sulphur crust, getting his foot scalded ; and Minister
Ward had a narrow escape of a similar adventure. It
would have been quite too utterly sensational an advt.
for the Maoriland Wonderland had we lost the Heir
Apparent in one of its boiling mud-holes, or if he had
suddenly “ gone under ” through the palpitating sulphur
crust over which one has to walk to view the “ sights” of
Ohinemutu.

Who Samuel Byrnes is.
The writer is glad to take the hand of Mr.
Samuel Byrnes and give it a hearty squeeze.
That we are parted for the moment by ten
thousand miles of seawater doesn’t count. May
you live right along and prosper, Mr. Byrnes.
In this grumbling old world, more full of aclies
and pains than an American water-melon
black seeds, it is jolly to hear a man sing out, “ /
am first-class every way ; and, as for my health, it
couldn't be better.”
This is great, especially when we understand
what went before it. For several years Mr.
Byrnes was in bad form. Dyspepsia it was, and
a very nasty variety of that abominable complaint.
He got butlittle sleep—so he writes—and was in
pain most of the time. He called in the doctors,
one after another, and asked them what he was to
do.
They agreed on the main point, and they were
right. Indigestion, liver disorder, and the nerve
troubles which are thrown in as make-weights
the doctors said these things once got rid of, our
friend would be all right.
And they did their best to bring it to pass—
these worthy men. They gave him drugs the
same, no doubt, that have been so often and so
vainly given.
“After the doctors gave me up,” says Mr.
Byrnes, “ I tried everything I could think of, or
others recommended to me. At first, I felt sure I
would come upon something helpful, but I never
did, until somebody told me about Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. Even after reading what was printed in
books and papers, as to the merits of this prepara-
tion, I still shook my head.
“ ‘ Not likely to be any better than the rest, I
said; ‘the chances are all against it.’ For, you
see, my heart was, as you may say, down in my
shoes, and I was not in the mood to take hope
from any testimony that could be produced.
“All the same, I began taking the Syrup; I
don’t know why. The good effect was almost im-
mediate. I stopped casting up my food, and com-
menced to feel stronger and better. Without
troubling you with the story of how I got on step
by step, I will merely say that the medicine
seemed to build me up, and put me together bit
by bit, until I was sound and well as any man
wants to be.
“ I have lived here sixty-one years, and many
people in this neighbourhood know what I have
said to be true, and were as much astonished at
my recovery as I was myself. lam now seventy-
one years of age, and hale and hearty. For this
wonderful blessing I thank God and Mother
Seigel’s Syrup.
“ As the reader looks at my signature and says,
‘Who is Samuel Byrnes?’ I present him my
compliments, and reply that, if we ever meet, I
shall be glad to tell him by word of mouth much
more than I have written, and to testify all day
long for the remedy that made me the man I am.”
Samuel Byrnes, Lemon Grove, Penrith, N.S.W.,
September Ist, 189 ff
The prediction that Ellen Terry would never take
kindly to elderly-woman parts has been falsified. In the
beautiful performance of “ Coriolanus,” staged from Alma
Tadema’s designs, Ellen Terry appears as Irving’s mother,
and is said to be very strong.
At Poverty Point.
The approaching marriage of clever Dion Boucicault
and charming Irene Vanbrugh will not be the immediate
result of love at first sight, anyhow. They met in Aus-
tralia eleven years ago, when Miss Vanbrugh was the in-
teresting young heroine of J. L. Toole’s co. Perhaps
there was something prophetic in the fact that the lady
made her first appearance at the Princess’s on the same
night (April sth, 1890) that Brough and Boucicault opened
their new Melb. Bijou Theatre with “ Money.” Dion B.
didn’t act in the luckless comedy, but he wa# on the spot
as stage-manager. Miss Vanbrugh was then a pale, slim,
bright-looking charmer of, say, something older than 22.
Anyone could have been excused for falling in love with
her. Lord Hopetoun opened his first Parliament at that
time, and old Johnny Toole and Miss Vanbrugh were
distinguished Visitors at the ceremony. Present scribe,
gazing at Johnny’s fair companion from the opposite side
of the Vic. Legislative Council, wrote her name upon his
heart, and now lives to tell the tale.
At Melb. Salon, last Thursday night, when, as it hap-
pened, none of the local puff journals had their recording
angels present, Miss Eunice (Unie) Russell gave her
dramatic powers a severe test. Her Princess Katherine
was a very French and pretty piece of work, Mrs. G. B.
Lewis (in skirts, not as a profane caricature of George
Rignold) taking the part of Henry the Fifth, a,nd playing
up to the brilliant amateurs. As mad Ophelia, the fair
Miss Russell carried her audience away from themselves,
and caused many tears to trickle down their innocent
noses. Mrs. Lewis may well be proud of having provided
the dramatic instruction which this gifted girl has taken
so earnestly to heart.
The liveliest turn seen at a Melb. house for a long
time happened at the Opera House t’other night, when a
box of “ Johnnies,” irritated by Austin Rudd’s nerve-
twisting “ sez-z-z,” started heaving bath buns at his
head. Rudd bore about a shilling’s worth of confection-
ary ; then he burst all bounds, and swooping on the wads
of dough that littered the stage, threw them with much
vehemence in the teeth of his enemies. Having followed
up the buns with a big stick and several tough, portable
objects, the artist hurled himself into the thick of the
Johnnies, and “foremost fighting fell.” He routed the
enemy, and turned up for his next ditty wearing a lusty
black eye, but blown with victory. After all, a bun is a
comparatively innocuous thing to throw at a comic
singer, but some people are never satisfied.
Hichens (in his New book, “ The Slave,”) on Melba :
“ A world-renowned prima-donna, in a garden hat and a
white muslin gown spotted with mauve orchids, was
eating pineapple and talking French with a vivid colonial
accent. Her companion was a big boy who hated music.
She loved big boys, and as she hated music too, they
naturally had a great deal in common. They were talking
about the Grand Prix, and the boy was giving her a good
tip for it. She cared more for a good tip than for all the
operas ever composed. Yet she could sing with consum-
mate art when she chose. She had been born with an
iron will and with an inordinate ambition, and God had
given her one of the loveliest voices in the world.”
There’s a ton of solid, accurate information in that para-
graph. Melba is generally believed to make quite as much
money by getting “the straight griffin” (whether re
copper-mining or racing) as by singing.
“ Jim ” : Went to hear the Imperial Concert Co. and
w'as astonished to find that the vocalists, including
Madame Belle Cole, came upon the platform with a piece
of music or a note book in hand, and sang from it.
Surely no artist nowadays ought to make what is prac-
tically a show of being not note-perfect and word-perfect
in the commonplace ballad which he or she expects to
impress the audience with. You don’t find a Dolores
referring to a piece of music or a bit of paper as she goes
along. A properly-educated Australian novice doesn’t
make such a mistake. The recent debutante, Miss Olive
Kingston, had empt\ - hands when she trilled her long and
difficult operatic passages.
Signora Benedetto, of the Italian Opera 00., didn’t want
to bang the Melb. Agb critic for remarking that her
figure was a heavy handicap to her performance as Aida,
the slave girl, but she sent the rude man, with her com-
pliments, a photo of herself in less unsuitable garments.
The Benedetto as she appears in “ Ernani ” is quite a
stately prima-donna. The long train gives her more
height, and her deportment is a work of art.
Italian opera, here, as in its native land, is disfigured
by the hideous arrangement (which looks like half of a
baby’s cradle, or an Esquimaux canoe turned upside-
down), placed right in front of the conductor, in the
stage foreground. Under cover of this eyesore, the
prompter follows the opera, with the score lying open on
the stage, beating the time with his finger, if necessary,
and giving the singers their cues. Apparently he stands
below the stage, and has only his head, shoulders a.nd
arms protruding through the hole in the floor. Italian
companies seem unable to get along without the assist-
ance of the man under the canoe.
America’s most popular dramatist (writes “The
Stroller” to Tub Bulletin from New York) is Clyde Fitch,
whose “ Lovers’ Lane ” will shortly be presented in Aus-
tralia. Fitch has a much stronger work in “The
Climbers,” a play of American social life —with a morally-
rotten, embezzling husband, and a self-sacrificing lover
that tries, in vain, to make him go straight. In one
striking scene the lover discovers the intended flight of
the husband, and makes him confess before his wife and
relatives. He will only do so in the dark. The lights are
turned black out, the confession is heard in the darkness,
and the lights are suddenly turned up just in time for
the lover to catch the husband bolting from the room.
The strong part of the wife is played by Amelia Bingham,
a large woman of the Nance O’Neil type, with many of
Nance’s vocal mannerisms. She, too, started her career
under M’Kee Rankin. The “ Lovers’ Lane ”is a “ pretty
play ” of a liberal-minded parson who wants to keep a
woman separated from her husband because she is useful
as his choir-leader. The grocery, the church, and the
schoolroom dominate the play and give it a way-back
simplicity. This season Fitch has had four plays running
simultaneously in New York alone. He wrote “ The
Cowboy and the Lady," which introduced Nat Goodwin
to London.
Amusing to read Wilson Barrett’s skite about his
readiness to produce new plays by any dramatists, known
or unknown, whose work will pass an examination by six
chosen experts. Most of the plays produced by Barrett,
of late years, have professed to be written wholly or
partly by himself. He’s the only fellow, seemingly, who
can “ satisfy ” his own six experts.

Nominations for N.S.W. State Election
closed with 350 candidates for 112 seats, and out
of the 250 new aspirants there is not a single
name which inspires any particular confidence.
Thirteen members win their seats unopposed, and
so far the See Ministry has more than held its
own. McFarlane of the Clarence wins his
seat without a fight for the second time running,
while D. McDonnell has the unique experience of
securing his first election unopposed. He is the
Labor nominee for Cobar, vice Spence, transferred
to the Federal Parliament. Other members
returned are Waddell and Bennett, two of the
Ministry, John Norton and Opposition Leader
Lee.
“ Adam’s Diary,” translated by Mark
Twain, is reminiscent of Mark’s old style.. He
thinks Adam “has now become sufficiently
important as a public character to justify this
publication ”: —
Monday.— The new creature with the long hair is a
good deal in the way. It is always hanging around and
following me about. I don’t like this ; lam not used to
company. I wish it would stay with the other animals.
Wednesday. —Built me a shelter against the rain, but
could not have it in peace to myself. The new creature
intruded. ... I wish it would not talk; it is always
talking. , , .
Sunday.— This morning found the new creature trying
to clod apples out of that forbidden tree. ... It calls
itself Eve. . .. ....
Monday. —She has been climbing that tree again.
Clodded her out of it.
Tuesday.— She has taken up with the snake now. .. .
I am glad, because the snake talks, and this enables me to
get a rest. . ,
Friday. —She says the snake advises her to try the fruit
of that tree. . . . ..
Next year.—We have named it Cain. She caught it
while I was up country trapping on the north shore of the
Erie ; caught it in the timber, a couple of miles from our
dug-out—or it might have been four, she isn’t certain
which. . . . She thinks more of it than she does of any of
the other animals. Her mind is disordered—everything
shows it. . . . It isn’t one of us, for it does not walk ; it
is not a bird, for it does not fly; it is not a frog, for it
does not hop; . . . I feel sure it is not a fish, though I
cannot get a chance to find out whether it can swim or
not. It merely lies around, and mostly on its back with
its feet up. I have not seen any other animal do that
before.
A good many months afterwards, Adam goes out
hunting, with the intention of catching another
animal of the same sort. He returns empty-
handed ; only to find that, while he was away,
Eve—“ without stirring from the home estate—
has caught another one ! ” He ‘ ‘ never saw such
luck.”
Next day.—l have been comparing the new one with
the old one, and it is perfectly plain they are the same
breed. I was going to stuff one of them for my collection,
but she i& prejudiced against it, lor some reason or othei.
. . . She calls it Abel.


Before Justice Connolly, of Maoriland, a
Hogging Judge, a man was the other day acquitted
by the jury on a charge of assaulting a Maori
woman, whereupon the Judge opened-out upon
the jury. He did not wonder at the frequency of
tins class of offence when juries returned such
verdicts. Ihen, to the accused, who asserted his
innocence; “You are discharged ; consider your-
self very lucky.” In North Queensland, 20 years
ago, a Judge on circuit acted somewhat similarly
whereupon the foreman of the jury: “With all
respect to the Supreme Court, I’ll just ask your
Honor to mind your own business. Your re-
marks are a gross insult to the jury, which is
sworn to do its duty, and will not tolerate your
Honor s insolence.” And what did the Judge say ’
He said nothing-. He only glared.
In argument in Bendigo (Vic.) Warden’s
Court this ruling, from Knox Wigram’s “Jus-
tices Notebook,” a recent and high authority was
quoted : J
, Alad whose 21st birthday happens on a Wednesday is
held to be of age during the whole of that day, no matter
at what hour he may have been born. Consequently, his
non-age must expire on the last instant on Tuesday
Consequently, as he is not a minor on the last instant on

10n a day. he is not a minor at any portion of
age ' BO 12 o’clock on Monday night he is of
Whereby Good Friday falls on the previous
Wednesday, and many other curious things hap-
pen. 4or instance, if a man spends portion of a
day pounding his wife, the law can’t recognise
the incident, for it takes no account of portion of
+1 that happened at a period
that had no legal existence didn’t legally happen
at all. Evidently unless a man spanks his wife
all day, or the push throws road-metal at the
policeman for 24 hours straight ahead, no crime
whatever has been committed. This point should
be worth inspection.

Rev. Osborne Lilley (Brisbane) re Poly-
nesians (in Australian Christian World) :
They are well fed and suitably housed. They have
wages enough to clothe themselves in broad cloth and
fine attire, some smoke cigars and ride their bicycles.
The Rev. Lilley has evidently come across some
of the “ walkabout” pimps and panders, who, in
conjunction with the Chinese, haunt the low quar-
ters of Bundaberg and Mackay. The rev. gentle-
man surely hasn’t the front to maintain that the
average “boy” (on his £6 and keep per annum)
trots round in broadcloth smoking cigars !
The Maoris are th.e only South Sea Island
race which is holding its own against white civi-
lisation. The Maori population of M.L. is now
42,000 against the 39,000 of five years ago; but
the proportion of half-castes and quarter-castes is
steadily increasing. A Young Maori Party has
recently been formed, having for its platform the
discouragement and abolition of objectionable and
pernicious customs in connection with Maori
meetings of all kinds, the suppression of the drink
traffic, the adoption of the mo3t suitable clothes
and the most suitable buildings, the higher educa-
tion of the Maori, and the extension of systematic
agricultural and pastoral pursuits. A sum of
£lOOO has already been collected towards the
erection of a Maori school for native girls. Gradu-
ally the party will drift in the direction of politics
and may ultimately be a very live organisation.
“ S.F.” : Be that lad and Jupiter’s moons

accidental perfection of all its parts with unusual

Such an eye—as the light-rays from the Pleiades,
or from Jupiter’s moons, are practically parallel—
would be able to distinguish the smaller members
of the constellation, or the moons aforesaid. Of
course the chance of an individual possessing o ie
perfect sight-organ is infinitely greater than that
of his having two. And as we all, who don’t
squint, use binocular vision, the discovery by its
owner of a single perfect eye ,would become yet
another chance.

Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
, THE FAMIOXTS HEMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient
and a Complete Cure is certain. j • >

CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was hot severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

Dear Sir. —I suffered from a severe cold on the chest,
with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit
until I used your Bronchitis Cure, which gave me relief
at once, and completely cured me. lam delighted with
it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once,
and “can’t be licked.” —Yours sincerely,

small bottle of .your Bronchitis Cure as soon as possible,
asl cannot speak above a whisper, owing to a cold. I
had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she
was seven months old. She had been suffering from
bronchitis from her birth, and now she is 3 years old, and
has not had a return of it since. It is a splendid medi-

of your Bronchitis Cure. Last winter three of my chil-

three of them. The housemaid also had such a severe
cold that she entirely lost her voice, but half a bottle
cured her. I always keep it in the house now, and re-

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that, previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,

Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HE ARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows: —“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to hgve a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since 1 commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sundaj' sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH
ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, Sir,

Mr. W. G. Hearrie.—Dear Sir, —Kindly send me one
laive bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. lam more than
pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcelv ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I bad been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yourssincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.’’
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes :—“After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in (he beginning of 1883— 15years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states: “1
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

themselves as infants in scientific invention and research
nnd modestly tell ns that they have but a smattering of
knowledge of the possibilities, extent, and development
We have only to look at the fine buildings that occupy
the corner of Elizabeth and Bathurst streets to
idea of the extent and importance of their profess.ona
work. Bat to have the privilege of being shown throng
the building by the Specialists themselves, and to see an
learn something of the real character of their w de P"
t'ce, is a treat that only comes the way of a fortunate
dividual like the writer.
The instrument-room was, as usual, one of par lieu l
curiosity. Laymen always have a penchant for ey eing
and examining the polished steel articles "nth which s
many extraordinary acts are performed upon the human
body. Th? collection in this room is in every way up I
date. Whenever a new instrument conies to the tronr,
and its worth is proved beyond question, it is added tc
this rare assortment. Another room full of absorbm in-
terest is that devoted to the galvanic batteries, of which
there are several magnificent kinds. The noted Lmltc
batteries, the finest French makes, are here in perfection,
irrespective of their high cost. If any artie.e or mechani-
cal and electric contrivance is found necessary m main-
taining the fame of this institution, the price is never
allowed to stand in the way.
The correspondence department is a veritable cve-
opener. Its sacredness is a bar to a stranger s admission
but a full view of the work going on is had through the
dass doors. Half a-dozen typists are seen driving th it
machine-writers at electric speed. To the principals only
are known the names of the persons throughout Aus ml . a
who are being treated as skilfully in their homes about
the metropolis and away in the interior as if they w re
present in personal consultation at the institution.
1 The packing-rooms are likewise shut off from curious
and prying glances, and the work of one department is a
mystery to the others. No better system for holding
secret the nature of sufferers’ troubles, for safe-guarding
their interests, and giving due heed to the fee h'V!* and
sensitiveness of patients, could be imagined. Packages
are not plastered with advertising labels, they are put up
in such a way that only the names and addresses are in

happiness thousands of people whose lives were a burden
to them. The young, the middle-aged, and the healthy
are treated with the same .amount of success. The pi o-
di'dous nature of the work accomplished by these
specialists necessitates-not the stereotyped morning and
evening two hours’ consultation ticket, but their constam
attention at the institution from early morning till late
into the night. “I can assure you, said Dr. Wallace,

A Paddington Tribute.
Another Convincing Narr&tiv
The Case of MR. THQMAB BRADY.
(by our reporter.)
A short distance from Oxford-street there
is a comfortable little bootmaking business
carried on by Mr. Thomas Brady, at No.
,47 Glenmore-ruad, Paddington, where our
representative found that gentleman en-
gaged in his usual vocation.
y “I have called to ask about your long ill-
ness, Mr. Brady.” _
“It was a long illness, you’re right. For
about seven years I did not know what it
was to be entirely well. I was always
either bilious or else suffering from indiges-
tion, and in that time I had consulted four
doctors, and between them they gave me no
end of instructions regarding food, and how
I should take more out-door exercise ; all of
which advice I willingly carried out, for I
had been ailing too long. Their prescrip-
tions —consisting of multifarious pills
and medicines —proved altogether useless,
and nothing they gave me prevented
my digestion from going wrong. Ihe
small quantities of food I did eat caused
great irritability of the stomach, and sick-
ness and vomiting were quite common.
After each meal, however light, I felt nasty
colicky pains, and the least pressure on the
stomach produced tenderness in a very
marked degree. I was often troubled with
heart-burn, and also pains in the right
side, near the edge of the ribs, and under
the shoulder blade. My bow*ls became in-
active, very likely through my sedentary
occupation. I used to be a particularly
healthy man, but so much confinement and
sitting down commenced to show their evil
oonaequences. Oppressive, throbbing pains
became apparent, and they were always in-
creased by moving about, or by strange
noises. If I took a walk along the street I
got awfully giddy, and my eyes were not
strong enough to stand the light of day.
Sometimes my headaches were so violent,
and my eyes so bad, that I had to knock off
work, and then lie down in a fit of despair.
I,was in such a state of excessive exhaustion
that I was always ready to lie down and go
to sleep, although I slept badly. Many a
night have I turned and tossed without
closing my eyes, and in the mornings I
arose feeling bad-tempered and fretful, and
with a disinclination for any exertion, or
even my ordinary work. A sour taste in
the mouth made everything the same, and
a'bitter fluid used to arise from the stomach,
especially on getting up from bed. I was
also aware of the presence of a yellowish
fur upon th# tongue. Month after month
passed away, and I was losing flesh and
strength all the time. I had got so weak at
last that I would sometimes faint whilst
sitting down, without any exertion or
excitement. My nervous system had got
into such a morbid condition that I even
felt inclined to shrink from the light.
All the colour had gone from my face, and
my skin generally lost its natural appear-
ance. The doctors could not make my case
out at all, as there was no doubt that my
condition was very serious. I could not
bear the thought of living on much longer
in that way, because all my faculties were
much affected by my sufferings. ”
“ You were very despondent, perhaps?”
“ Well, I think I liad every reason to be,
afte; laking pills and medicines galore,
Witno.it reaping any b nefit from them. I
was prevailed upon by my si-ter to throw
the doctor’s treatment aside, and go in for
& course of. Clements Tonic. ‘ I know so
many who have been cured by it that I am
sure it will do you good,’ she said. W ell, i
thought she might be right, and such after-
wards proved to be case. You can hardly
imagine how quickly it picked me up, for
in a week or so I could eat anything with-
out fear of vomiting it up again. My
tongue became healthy and clean, and the
sourness soon departed fiom my mouth.
My food no longer provoked those agonis-
ing paroxysms of pain in my stomach, as
Clements Tonic seemed to set my internal
organs properly to work. How differently I
looked at life when I could rise in the morn-
ing feeling refreshed after a peaceful sleep.
The medicine I was now taking drove away
all the sluggishness from my liver, and it
had the effect of making my bowels more
regular in their action. With my strength
coming back, I could go about my work
with a feeling of cheerfulness, instead of
the distastefulness which had for seven
years attended my exertions. The pains in
the head, which used to prostrate me with
their violence, were cured, and my eyesight
was as good as before my sickness came on.
The plainest of food was a luxury, and my
ravenous appetite soon made me get stout
again. When I had taken the fourth
bottle of Clements Tonic you would not
have thought I was the same man. All my
nervousness had been thrown off, and the
pallid face I had worn so many years now
looked a healthy, bright colour. I could
•take a walk without fearing those attacks
of dizziness which had previously ac-
companied me when out for exercise, and
the fainting fits never came on again. 1
have to thank my sister for her advice, and
Clements Tonic for its matchless capabilities
as a health restorer. Without it lam sure
I should have dragged along the road of
life without enough strength or spirit to
make my existence endurable ; but now I
jog along quite happy and contented, feel-
ing myself relieved from my burden of
suffering. If ever I feel a little out of sorts
through too long continued labour, or
through the close confinement and lack of
exercise which my business involves, I
always have Clements Tonic at hand, and it
has never failed to do me good. You can,
therefore, quite understand how much con-
fidence I have in it, and that is the reason I
do not begrudge the time taken up in this
interview.
“ And may we draw the attention of the
public to your illness and cure?”
“I shall be glad if you will do so. be-
cause somebody may read it with advantage,
and you can publish what I say in any way
you like.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Thomas Bradt, of 47 Gleamore-road, Padding-
ton, Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, do
solemnly and sincerely declare that I have carefully
read the annexed document, consisting of three folios,
and consecutively numbered from one to three, and
that it conttins and is a I rue and faithful account of
my illness and cure by Clements Tonic, and also con-
tains my full permission to publish in any way my
statements—which I give voluntarily, without receiv-
ing any payment; and I make this solemn declaration
conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by
virtue of the provisions of an Act made and passed in
the ninth year of the reign of her present Majesty,
intituled ‘‘An Act for the more effectual abolition
of Oaths and Affirmations taken and made in the
various Departments of the Government of New South
Wales, and to substitute Declarations in lieu thereof,
and for the suppression of voluntary and Extra-
judicial Oaths and Affidavits."
Declared at Paddington, this 9th day of October,

By Expelling all the Impure Deposits which lurk in the
Kidneys, KUTNOW’S POWDER re-vitalises those Weak
and Congested, and Restores their Filtering Power.
A BOON TO HUMANITY.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is the indicated
SUPREME REMEDY FOR ALL DERANGE-
MENTS OF THE STOMACH, LIVER, SPLEEN,
KIDNEYS, AND INTESTINES. IT PREVENTS
AND RELIEVES SICK HEADACHE, NERVOUS
HEADACHE, LANGUOR, HYPOCHONDRIA,

MORBID DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA, DROWSI
NESS, RHEUMATISM, GOUT, SCIATICA, AND
ALL CAUSES OF BRIGHT’S DISEASE AND
URIC ACID TROUBLES. The filtering power of
the Kidneys is limited, consequently any derangement
of the Stomach, Liver, or Bowels affects the Kidneys by
heaping up more injurious poisonous matter than their
filtering capacity can pass. Acting specifically on all
the great organs of the body concurrently, as the
greatest organic cleanser of the age, Kutnow relent-
lessly expels all deleterious matter, cleanses and disin-
fects each organ of putrid obstructions, and prevents
the absorption of vicious micro-organisms into the
blood. To insure uniform health Kutnow’s Powder is
absolutely indispensable.
The Safety Halve of Health.
VIVA-VOCE.— a very interesting discussion
about the origin of diseases caused by the intrusion of uric
acid in the tissues took place at the International Medical
Congress in Paris, in which the most prominent authori-
ties of England, France, and Germany took part. While
the authorities came to the conclusion that the ultimate
cause of the origin of uric acid has not as yet been
sufficiently explored, they unanimously agreed that, of
all the uric acid eliminators, KUTNOW’S Improved
Effervescent Carlsbad POWDER, composed of the most
valuable and curative elements of the most celebrated
Continental Medicinal Spring Waters,
OCCUPIES FIRST PLACE AND IS UNEQUALLED.

Bruising the Serpent’s Head.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her hero arrived on horseback, as heroes and
bushmen are wont to do. And the manly young
fellow had earned her undying gratitude, trust,
and love, by offering her a home a rough busb
home, certainly, but still a home.
To the weary Eve it seemed probable that a
vigorous young Adam could transform even a
forest selection into some sort of a Paradise. With
a sweet woman to help him, Adam had no doubt
whatever on the subject; he was sure of it. In
any case, it was clear to Eve that almost anything
was to be preferred to the stuffy pleasures of the
ribbon-and-lace department of Greytown s general
and galvanised-iron store.
“ It’ll be a bit lonely for you, Eve,” said Adam.
“ But your mother could come and stay while I m
away shearing.”
And so the Paradise was planted. To the
casual passer-by it was just an ordinary bush hut,
stuck anyhow in the middle of a partially-cleared
patch, surrounded by a rough-and-ready fork-
and-spar fence, and fringed by “rung” timber;
but casual passers-by thereabouts were very casual
and very unpoetic. To Adam and Eve it was full
of rose-coloured blossoms of hope, presaging a fine
fruitage, regardless of seasons or rain or drought.
They were young and loved each other worship-
fully.
It was nearly two years before the serpent crept
in. It came in the guise of Adam’s curiosity.
Surfeited with the sweets of the present, he must
needs gamble with the future by probing the
past. And one night, out of the fulness of her
love and trust, she, being closely questioned,
admitted something that no woman ever freely
forgives herself for admitting. .
A great terror filled her soul as she felt him
shrink from her side and lie very still; but it was
too late for all but silent tears. Her pillow was
wet when daylight came ; but his was cold, bho
had heard him get up and dress and take his
bridle from the wall. She knew as though she
could see, just where lie had yarded the horses.
As he came in later for his saddle and a hurriedly-
collected pack she strove to speak, but the plead-
ing whisper refused to leave her lips. vVhen in
the dark she heard him go to the cot and kiss their
baby boy it was in her mind to cry out to him in
her agony, but her heart told her it would be use-
less. The rattle of the slip-rails being let down
in the grey, damp dawn smote on her ears like a
knell. She wondered vaguely if he would look
back as he rode away down the rough track, but
put the liodo from her as an unholy thought.
Yet, with his foot irresolutely in the stirrup, lie
did look back. Had she shown herself at the
door with the boy in her arms, he had, perhaps,
coms back, and ? .
Her mother arrived before evening. The store-
keeper’s cart fetched her. The man told Eve he
had been instructed to take her orders for what-
ever was required on the selection.
“Adam’s gone shearin’ early this year, he re-
marked. “ Must be goin’ a good long ways ? ”
“Yes,” she answered, slowly, “he’s going a
long way this year, I expect.”
Adam had told the mother nothing; had just
called and asked her to go out to the selection,
and stay awhile, and had ridden off with his usual
grave, “ So-long ! ” So there was no need for Eve
to make explanations; it was not very extraordi-
nary that a shearer-seleotor should start north wards
a month earlier, or later, than usual; for, in the
land of long distances, shearers go out to meet the
springtime, and may travel far with the season
that suits. , . ~ ~ ,
No breath of scandal, therefore, was wafted
down to the township from the lonely home up
under the Sawpit Ranges, and no ill was sus-
pected by the distant neighbors. Adam counted
all this as good fortune, for, as yet, he was by no
means certain that he wished the world to know
that he had left his wife and child for ever. In
fact, he hardly cared to admit any such thing,
even to himself. Procrastination thrives with
most Australians, and Adam was no exception.
He was urged onwards in his solitary ride by a
notion that he would be less a man had he stayed
with Eve after her confession, but, as lie rode, a
thousand tender memories tugged at his heart-
strings, day-long and day-long, and made the
stodgy plains seem unutterably wide and dreary.
At night, by the lonely camp-fire, something that
was not rain often glistened on his sun-tanned
cheek. More than once, when he fancied he
heard his baby boy cry out in the night, lie had
suddenly started up from sleep, and had impul-
sively set out to catch the horses and saddle-up for
a return journey. Sometimes, in broad day, when
he imagined he could hear Eve saying, pleadingly :
“ It was such a long time ago, Adam, such a long
time ago,” he had surprised his horses by turning
their heads for home, then reining-up, undecided
whether to spur home to his loved ones, or con-
tinue his journey northwards to the early sheds.
He went on ; each day’s ride taking him further
from winter and nearer to spring. His first shed
had “ cut-out,” and a second was half-through ;
yet he was still undecided. Sooner or later he
must do something definite —that he knew; but
what? ,
It had become gradually clear to him that he
should not live with Eve again ; but what about
the child? Should he for ever cut himself off
from his fine baby boy, the little Adam, with his
father’s blue eyes, and his mother’s brown curls?
Could he part them ; had ho the right or the
heart to do it? A great pity for them and a
greater for himself surged up in his heart when he
thought of it all; they had been so happy
together.
He would write to Eve one of these days, telling
her he was not coming back to her any more, and
advising her to go and live with her mother in
Grey town, and he would get an agent to sell the
selection and pay her the money. He would tell
her she could keep the boy for the present, until
such time as another home could be found for
him, “somewhere a long way off, so that he might
grow up without knowing what sort of girl his
mother had been.” In his mind he drafted the
letter often ; thinking it out, painfully, word by
word, and sentence by sentence, many times
changing the tone and the wording, but always
winding up with a reference to the child and “the
sort of a girl his mother had been.” And it was
just that particular phrase which caused most of
the delay. Adam was not satisfied with it; it
seemed rather a cruel thing to say to the girl he so
loved, and who had mothered his child ; and yet —
and yet, it was surely necessary. No other words
he could think of so plumbed the depths of his
self-pity, and at the same time conveyed the
merited rebuke to her in whom he had been so
sadly deceived. At shearing sheep Adam was far
more expert than in the making of phrases and
the writing of letters; so he kept on shearing
sheep and postponed the letter-writing.
But a day came when there could be mo longer
delay. The season had brought the shearers
southward to within twenty miles of Greytown,
and but a short day’s ride from Adam’s own selec-
tion.
“ S’pose you’ll be making for home safternoon,
Adam?” casually remarked his pen-mate, during
the first Saturday forenoon they were at Brenda.
Adam hesitated ; his mate’s remark came as
somewhat of a shock. He bent low over his work
to hide his confusion, eventually growling some-
thing to the effect that he “supposed he’d take a
ride home one of these Saturdays to see if the
selection was in the same place.”
“I’m blanky sure about you,” chaffed the
“ hard-case ”of the shed. “I’ll bet the big brown
won’t be so fresh this time to-morrow. None of
yous married blokes ought to be let own a decent
prad.”
“ It’ll feel like gettin’ married all over again,
won’t it, Adam ? ” chipped another, slyly.
So the chaff went on, and Adam realised that,
to avoid pointed remark, he would have to at
once arrange his domestic affairs on a basis that
would at least appear satisfactory.
At “ smoke-ho ” ho slipped down to the hut and
wrote the oft-considered letter. After a brief but
frantic cudgelling of his brains for a more suitable
phrase, he concluded with —“You may keep the
boy until I can take him where he will never learn
the sort of girl his mother has been.” He left the
letter with the cook and returned to his work.
As the shearers filed irregularly from the shed
at mid-day, their work over for the week, Adam
saw the mailman disappearing in a thin cloud of
dust far across the plain. He felt that he had
never known real sorrow in his life until then.
In the early afternoon he sat on the wood-heap
before the hut door and gloomily watched the
other shearers go off, saddles on arms, to the
stockyard. They were off on a twenty-mile ride
for such Saturday-night excitement as Greytown
afforded. *
“ Ain’t yer cornin’, Adam?” queried one, care-
lessly. Adam shook his head, and muttered
something about having sent a letter, and that lie
would be going home “ perhaps next Saturday.
“You can leave the brown horse in the yard,
though,” he added. “I’ll go over and have a
look at him directly.”
“ Righto ! ” And the noisy crowd were soon
racing off towards the township, as light-hearted
as though the twenty miles were but as many
Adam watched them out of sight, and the lump
in his throat grew big as he remembered that
he. too, might have been galloping with them,
each stride of his big brown horse taking lnm
nearer to all that he had ever really loved.
But it was better as it was; he had done the
manly thing and would have been a fool and a
weakling to have done otherwise. He would not
think any more about it. . ,
Full of this laudable resolve, he strolled into the
hut and casually scanned a fortnight-old news-
paper which the mailman had left for the cook.
Under the heading “Greytown; from our own
correspondent,” he came across an account of a
severe storm that had disturbed the serenity of the
district recently, and had been particularly
devastating out towards the Sawpit Ranges.
Trees had been uprooted and smashed to pieces
by lightning, roofs blown off, and many settlers
homes totally destroyed. “So far as is yet
known,” concluded the correspondent, there
has been no loss of life, though some of the far-
back settlers had most terrible experiences.
Adam dropped the paper as though it burnt
him, stood a second as in doubt, then swiftly but
methodically taking his saddle from the tie-beam,
stalked over to the stockyard. In five minutes
the brown horse danced out of the yard on his
hind feet, and in five more was plunging out past
the homestead gates, bearing a white-faced man
with burning eyes, along the straightest track to
Greytown.
A few miles had been cast behind ere the horse,
fresh and fiery and eager for home, began to steady
down to his work. The dust raised by the
roystering horsemen of the early afternoon still
hung like a soft haze in the sunset and caked in
white sweat-lines along the big brown’s neck and
flanks. Then Adam recollected that twenty
miles at racing speed was rather much to expect
from even the best grass-fed horse in the district.
And where was the hurry ? He only wished to
incjuire at the township how the storm had treated
his bush home, and if his wife and child had
escaped unhurt. Still he checked the horse but
little, and the township lights began to twinkle
ahead with the first of the summer stars. _
As he rode into the place it seemed to him that
he had been away five years ; but the hilarious
voices of his Brenda shod-mates, raised in tuneless
chorus as he passed the first of Greytown s
“jpubs,” reminded him that it was shearing-time,
and but five months had passed since he had said
“ So-long ! ” to his wife’s mother at the cottage
gate yonder.
The cottage was in darkness now, so he would
learn no news there. He would casually inquire
at the general store and post-office.
“ Hello, Adam !” shouted the cheery old store-
keeper, as the young man with his arm linked
through the bridle-rein looked in at the open door.
“ Some o’ the Brenda chaps was here ’safternoon,
and told me you was out there, and wouldn’t be
going home till next Saturday. I gave em a
message for you. S’pose you haven’t heard about
your wife and kiddy ? My word, they had a
narrow squeak for it! ” .
Adam staggered against the door-post, but the
old storekeeper failed to notice his visitor s agita-
tion in the murky light, and rattled on volubly :
“ The night of the big storm the kiddy took real
bad, and the missus started for here by the short
track across the spur, carryin’ the youngster. It
was a terrible night, and she lost her way in the
storm. But she battled on somehow, and, more
dead’ll alive, got to the doctor’s door, down the
street, at daybreak. Only just in time, though :
Doc says the kiddy would have been past help m
another hour ; diphtheria or sumthin’. Anyway,
they’re both pretty right now, and the doctor took
’em ’ome in his dog-cart only yesterday.”
Before the storekeeper had finished his story
Adam’s foot was in the stirrup.
He looked over his shoulder to ask: VVliat
time did the Gully letters go out?” „
“ Let me see, now ; Splitting Jack took em,
said the other. “It must have been about—-.
I noticed there was one for your folks; can tbe
more’n an hour ago .” .
Adam waited to hear no more. Flinging bim-
self to the saddle, he touched the horse sharply
with the spurs. The gravel thrown from the four
startled hoofs rattled on the iron front of the store
like a sharp volley of .hailstones, and . the next
moment the big brown was thundering down the
half-lighted street into the darkness of the bush
beyond. Just clear of the township, Adam swung
the horse round on to a faint track, which was
locally known as the “ short-cut ” over the spur—
the same short-cut that his wife, tattered and
wind-swept and despairing, had fought her way


THERE’S A LONG LINE
or
SYDNEY PEOPLE
USlNG-
floan’s Backache Kidney pills.
What They Say;
AND
Why They Use Them.
%
1
The report we publish to day is
from Mr. E. Hanson, of 41 Rosser-
street, Balmain, Sydney. No better
evidence can be had as to the merits
of a medicine than the evidence of
one’s friends and neighbors, such as
this
Just one word of caution here.
The merit and success of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have caused
them to be imitated in a most un-
scrupulous way. These imitators
imitate the name, and they imitate
the package just as closely as they
dare. But the one thing they can’t
imitate is the strong endorsements
of Sydney people. Every action of
an imitator is shady and suspicious.
For instance, instead of telling what
Sydney people say about his medi-
cine, he tells what someone in a
far-away, obscure town says. Will
the intelligent reader compare such
statements with the open, straight-
forward statements of Sydney peo-
ple about Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pill’a?
But you will never be imposed on
if you will remember that the full
name is Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, and if your chemist or druggist
cannot supply you, send 2/9 for a
single box, or 15/3 for six boxes, to
the Proprietors, Foster - McClellan
Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney, and the
medicine will be sent you at once,
po3t free.
One word more as to why Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are so effective
in curing disease.
Because they purge the kidneys
and bladder of disease-breeding im-
purities. When the kidneys go wrong
they become clogged with, impurities,
and these impurities go all through
the body, and cause all manner of
disease.
They cause you headaches, back-
aches, rheumatism, neuralgia, dizzi-
ness, bad heart, all tired-out feelings,
dropsy, general dullness of the mind,
and run-down condition.
These and a thousand more troubles
are caused by defective kidney action,
and are curable only through the kid-
neys. And Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are the most successful medicine
in the world to-day, because they go
straight to the root of the disease—" *
the kidneys—and heal them.
Mr. E. Hansen says :
“For years I had a backache
which made me helpless and a burden
to myself. I also had my right arm
useless, and could not do any work.
I had to use my left arm to feed my-
self, being unable to lift a teacup to
my lips with my right arm. I say
nothing of the agony I was in; but
only of the fact that I was unable to
earn my own living. I tried a lot of
medicines, and went to doctors and
hospitals. I would get a slight relief,
and then I’d get bad again for a moral
certainty. I took fourteen boxes of
one largely-advertised remedy alone,
and thought it had cured me twice ;
but when I started work one
day’s labour made me as bad
as I had been before. There
are hundreds in Balmain who know
of my case, and any of them will
tell you what Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills have done for me. I got a
box more than twelve months ago,
and when I had taken half a box of
these wonderful pills I felt so well
that I thought 1 could start work.
But, knowing how I had been treated
by other remedies, I finished the box
to make sure, and then I began
work, and have worked ever since.
My right arm is as strong and as well
as my left, and all the pains have
gone. I have not taken a pill since,
because I’ve not needed one. They
acted in a most magical way, as the
men in the Dock will tell you.
Through hearing of my case others
have used Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, and have been cured likewise.”
And the following cases are all from
Sydney people, and are similar in
many respects to the above :

ITCHINESS OF THE SKIN.
Ever had any
Irritation of the Skin?
There are many forms of it, and any of them
bid enough to tax your patience. Hemorrhoid, a
plague of the night: no rest for the sufferers from
that complaint. Eczema, too ; hives don t sound
dangerous, but they cause much misery to those
unfortunate enough to be troubled with them.
Doan’s Ointment is “a wonder” for any such
trouble. Any troublesome irritation of the skin
can’t resist its healing, soothing influence. Lots
of Sydney people know this now.
Mrs. M. A. Carter, “ Waratah,” Orange-street,
Rand wick, Sydney, writes a most enthusiastic
letter as to how her youner daughter, aged 10
years, was cured of Eczema by Doan’s Ointment.
Mrs Carter thought her daughter contracted the
disease at school. It affected her scalp, which
was terribly inflamed, and all broken out, and
irritated her terribly. She procured some of
Doan’s Ointment at Newman’s Pharmacy, Ring-
street, and, after thoroughly washing the child s
scalp, applied it. The result was the scalp en-
tirely healed in a few days, and left no sear, muah
to their joy.
“ I have also used the ointment myself for irri-
tation of the skin—a sort of Eczema—and it has
done me equally as much good as it did my
daughter. You are at liberty to publish these
facts at any time, and I will only be too pleased
to verify the statements should I be called upon
to do so.” ~ _ • c
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all Diseases of
the Skin, Eczema, Piles, Hives, Insect Bites, bores,
Chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe and very effec-
tive. Very frequently two or three boxes have
made a complete cure of chronic cases that have
not yielded to other remedies for years.
Doan’s Ointment has been tested in so many
ways, in hospital work, in private practice, and
has proved so successful that a special arrange-
ment has been made by which all readers of Ihe
Bulletin who have not already tried it may
obtain a sample pot, free by mail, by sending us
their names and addresses and a penny stamp to
pay postage. We know that this Ointment w m

Bulletin,
through to save her ohild, and his, on that terrible
night.
Never was so risky a ride ridden at such a pace;
never had the good brown horse and his deter-
mined rider had such a task ; never would either
have faced it had daylight disclosed the dreadful
dangers. The storm-king had sent the forest into
wreckage. Splintered timber and loose rocks lay
piled disorderly in every direction, and yawning
chasms were torn by the flood-waters across the
narrow siding track.
One idea possessed the horseman, one idea urged
him on. Several times had the horse stumbled to
his knees, but, trembling with terror and blown
with exertion, had recovered, and stood reeking in
the darkness, while his master rushed hither and
thither afoot to find a way round the temporary
obstruction of fallen timbers. Whether tearing
aside tangled branches with bleeding hands, or
clinging with thighs a-stride to the saddle while
the brown horse plunged onwards along the moun-
tain side, Adam kept repeating to himself : “My
God ! and she battled through this ! She battled
through this in the storm for the sake of my kid !”
It was his fixed intention to get to the selection
before the fatal letter was delivered, or die in the
attempt. There seemed no other alternative.
At last, the crest of the last ridge was reached,
and Adam raced the big brown down the now
comparatively clear slope at top speed. Horse
and man had been bred in the bush ; that gave
them their only chance for life. And they won
through, striking the track within a few chains of
the selection slip-rails.
The rails were down. He was, then, too late,
for surely Splitter Jack had passed in with the
letter, and Eve had already received the cruel
blow. A bend in the track hid the hut from
sight, but as Adam leaped from the back of the
now utterly-foundered horse, and ran stumblingly
along, a band of light shone from the open door,
revealing the old man in the very act of handing
Eve the fatal missive. He saw her turn quickly
and hold the face of the envelope to the light,
then swiftly press it to her lips. Then, with
trembling hands, she tore it open, but, bethinking
her of the messenger, turned to thank him. But
the old man was staring with startled eyes down
the track, and his horse was snorting in alarm at
an apparition advancing swiftly towards them.
The next moment the horse was tugging his
swearing owner half-way across the paddock by
the bridie-reins, and Eve was hysterically sobbing
in her husband’s arms. Presently she raised her
tearful eyes questioningly to his.
“Where’s the boy ?” he asked, huskily.
For answer she led him to the cot, where the
little fellow lay fast asleep. Adam stooped and
kissed him. As he straightened himself, Eve
again questioned him with her eyes.
“ You saved our boy,” he said, simply. “ That’s
good enough for me.”
Then, as he took her in his arms, his hand
closed firmly over the letter she still held. And
she never got a chance to read it.
♦ m * »
Tt was three days before Adam, on foot, but
looking five years younger, got back to Brenda
woolshed. He cheerfully explained to all hands
that ho had lost the big brown horse.
“Tt don’t seem to trouble you much, anyway,”
remarked Hardcase.
“ No,” replied Adam, Perhaps I’d grieve a lot
more at losing a worse horse.”
“ I'm blanky sure ! ” said Hardcase, ironically.
But Adam only laughed.

JOHN DRAYMAN.
The Interpreter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He had reached that stage when a man regards
the woman he has once loved as an episode of his
past.
She, feeling he was slipping away from her,
suddenly realised she loved him. So, with the
cussedness of woman, who only values what she
can’t get, she longed once more to subdue him.
That was why she encouraged him to talk of
Miss Thwaites, though jealousy gnawed at her
heart all the time.
Yet it pleased her to feel that although she was
married to an old fossil (as she celled Jem) she
was attractive enough to make a good-looking
man walk two miles every night to see her.
But Morton wanted a confidante, and force of
habit led his footsteps to the Bungalow. Jem
was always at the club, but Mrs. Jem was always
at home in the evening—to him. She was such a
good listener, too, and it was jolly out there on
the verandah watching the moon rise, and smoking
Jem’s excellent cigars, sometimes he said more
than he intended—at least, Mis. Jem thought so.
Women seldom give men credit for subtlety, yet
the men who are loved the most passionately are
all slightly feline.
To-night Morton spoke first.
“ Miss Thwaites has gone for a trip to Sydney.
I went to see her off this afternoon, and give her
some flowers.
Mrs. Jem writhed inwardly, but answered
calmly “Yes; why not?”
“Well, you see, the girl at the shop where I
ordered them was a bit of a fool, and must have
given me someone else’s bouquet; there was a little
bunch of forget-me-nots in the centre. I never
noticed them till it was too late, and I’ve been
wondering ever since what Miss Thwaites would
think ? ”
Like a woman, Mrs. Jem jumped to a conclu-
sion ; it was all right; he was still hers. The
darkness hid her smiles, but she said reproach-
fully: “Oh, Jack, you shouldn’t have done it;
the poor girl will think you meant something.
She’ll be expecting a proposal next.”
“Eh? damn it all!” said Morton ; but Mrs. Jem
smiled.
* « * *
It was Mrs. Jem’s At-Home Day. Only one
visitor remained —Dora Desmond, an old school-
fellow.
“ Did you hear what they were saying about
Jack Morton ? ” she asked.
“Yes, that he and Miss Thwaites were going to
make a match of it; but we know better than
that, don’t we, Dora dear ? ”
Dora smiled. “ Why, I thought you were tired
of him ? ”
It was a polite way of saying just the reverse,
but women are sometimes polite to each other;
also, Mrs. Jem kimw all about Dora’s love affairs.
“Aren’t you?” i orap rsisted with raised eye-
brows.
“No, not quite. Listen then ’’—she told Dora
of the “parting-bouquet episode,” adding triumph-
antly—“ So you see there’s nothing in it.”
Dora looked grave. “ Don’t you be too sure—
shall I tell you why he asked you what the girl
would think ? ”
“Yes; why?”
“ Because he did mean something and he
wanted one woman to tell him what another would
think ! ”

PLYMOUTH SOUND.
North-West.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are stars in the seas and skies-
Red jewels aloft and under—
And waves on the brown cliffs rise
A-swing to a song of thunder;
Off-shore ’neath a cold, clear moon
The surf on the reef is sprawling,
And ever a-through its tune
I dream there are voices calling—
The voice of the gaunt gums calling,
The song of the desert calling ;
From river and still lagoon
The heart of Australia calling.
The croon of a drowsy creek
That kisses a careworn river;
The bush and the west wind speak,
A-ripple with sun they quiver
The sunbeams sown in my blood,
And call to my heart to follow
The staggering seas that flood
The west with their long backs hollow.
Australia’s noon sighs “Follow,”
The song of her dawn shouts “ Follow
The wash of her tides a-flood
Sings low to my heart to follow.
Her sunsets burning the sands
And dyeing the white surf crimson,
Are dragging with passionate hands
A heart that their hot tide swims on.
There are stars in the seas afar,
But down in the west is glowing
A fairer and jsurer star
Than those in the dream-seas showing.
It burns where the seas are going—
Where often I dream I’m going—
North-west where the gray gums are
Like ghosts in the pale dawn showing.

His Reason.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The man had been sitting on the pavement out-
side his house for three hours. It was two o’clock
in the morning and the usual sleepy guardian of
the law was approaching.
“What are you doing there?” asked the man
with the large feet, drawing near cautiously.
“Sitting-down,” said the man.
“Yes, I am aware of that fact.”
“Well, was it necessary to inquire?”
“Now then, young man, if you get insult-
ing you must move-on.”
“Oh ! I was under the impression this was my
own home, but perhaps I’m mistaken. Anyhow,
if it is, I’ve a right to sit here.”
“Oh, I beg pardon!” apologised the police-
man, drawing closer. “I didn’t recognise you.
What’s the matter —lost your key ?”
“ No.”
“ Left it in your other clothes, maybe ? ”
“No,” very curtly.
“ Too early to wake your mother up ? ”
“No.”
“Waiting for the milkman, p’raps?” ventured
the officer.
“ No.”
“ Expecting a letter from your best girl, eh ? ”
“No.”
“Trying to catch the person who steals your
morning paper ? ”
“ No,” more sharply than ever.
“Want to get an appetite for breakfast, pos-
sibly?”
“No.”
“ P’raps, maybe, want to get cool before going
to bed ? ” chuckled the policeman. (The thermo-
meter registered one point below zero.)
“No ! What the blanky——”
“ Are you,” began the policeman, but he was
interrupted.
“Look here,” said the Problem. “Have I to
reveal to you the sacred secrets of my household?”
“No,” said the policeman uneasily.
“Must I inform you of my domestic infelici-
ties ? ”
“No.”
“Do I—must I tell you my loving wife is
standing on the stairs with a poker in one hand
and a broom in the other, waiting for my appear-
ance?”
“ No.”
“ And that she has declared war ? ”
“ Eh !—what ? ” stammered the policeman.
“Now then,” said the man in a commanding
tone, “depart and attend to your own business.
I’ll sit here for a month if I like.”
And the policeman, actually abashed and dis-
concerted, apologised and went on his _ way,
eagerly surveying each door-step, in his en-
deavor to secure a door-mat, that lie might be able
to refresh himself with a comfortable sleep in
the most convenient place.

That recent decision of U.S. Supreme
Court (by five Judges to four) that the Consti-
tution does not follow the flag, marks a big
departure in American policy. It simply signi-
fies that the hitherto free Republic is weary of
the r6le she has played since the Civil War, and is
prepared to again step forward as a slave-peopled
Empire. The decision was, of course, aimed at
the Filippinos.
The Riverine Herald (Echuca, Vic.)
thus lays around with its moral cowhide :
Some of the Melbourne young women can drink. I
mean the bare necked, bare-armed, bare-breasted and
pasted young women, who were going the rounds of the
Government festivities during the week—-the Parliament-
opening, concerts, conversaziones, at homes, Flemington
review luncheon, and such like. Some of them, many of
them, can put away champagne with any bookmaker
celebrating a Cup. Some of these half-dressed and three-
quarter dressed charmers were to be seen by whoever
liked to look at them scoffing the Government champagne
at the rate of two or three glasses per 10 or 15 minutes.

tures King Edward distributing the Maundy
Thursday bounty, or rather the procession filing
up to King Edward. Surely an enemy hath done
this! Maudlin Thursday! The good monarch, with
holy benevolence exuding from every pore of his
face, is supposed to stand where we do in looking
at picture. There is a lane of pauper men And
women, venerables with beaming loyalty on their
gnarled phizzes. They represent—what percen-
tage of London’s pauperdom ? Archbishop and
bishop march in procession. A gorgeous beef-
eater carries the Maundy Thursday dole on a gold
alver. Faugh ! Likewise woosh !


"I Gained Flesh Rapidly.”
If You Are Run Down, Losing Strength, Are Greatly
Debilitated, and Suffer from the Long, Hot Summer,
There is one Medicine That Will Quickly Cure You. It is
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

f
w
Mr. A. Smith, of Chief Street, Brompton, So. Australia, very kindly sends, us
the following letter with his photograph, both of which are given here. _
“I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for loss of appetite, indigestion, and to give
tone and vigor to my system when training for bicycle racing. I only used three
bottles; but it was enough to improve my appetite and thoroughly restore my
strength and health. I also gained flesh rapidly to my normal weight.
“As a blood-purifier and general tonic for those who are affected by the
long, hot summers of Australia there is no medicine like it.”
It is because of such testimonials that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is called
“The World's Greatest Family Medicine.”
We could show you hundreds of such letters as this. They all say that Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla helps every one who tries it. It always does good and sometimes
makes such wonderful cures that they seem like miracles.
If you are feeling poorly just now, get a bottle of this grand old medicine.
The very next day you will feel better.
