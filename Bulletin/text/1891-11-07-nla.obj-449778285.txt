quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical

assist you materially in describing your ailment.

stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by lire,

will remain a secret between the doctor and

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1891.
Can England Hold India?
It is not for soldiers alone that war finds
employment. With the discharge of the
first gun or the appearance of the first
cavalry scout, the world’s scribblers at once
seek to turn an honest penny by appearing
as war-correspondents sufficiently near the
scene of action to be reasonably safe, or as
novelists to stay at home and manufacture
thrilling tales of love and slaughter while the
opportunity offers—that is, while men's
minds are swayed by the sound of strife. It
was so during the Crimean struggle, during
the Indian mutiny, and, later still, during
the murderous contest between the Northern
Democracy, determined on the freedom that
could only he preserved by solidarity, and
the Southern Oligarchy prepared for selfish
ends to drive a wedge into the Union. It was
in a noyelette touching on some episodes in
the Indian uprising, which so nearly destroyed
in a day the work of a century, that a literary
hack in the neighbourhood of Ratcliffe High-
way wrote of Hindostan as “An Empire
won by the sword, but which the Bible alone
can retain.” At that time the Sepoys in
squads were being blown away from guns.
It is therefore but fair to the British authori-
ties of the time to say that they recognised
the expediency of not depending solely on
the Word of God. The Bible is admirable
in many ways ; but its persuasive power is
in no way diminished by alliance with a
field-piece.
* * •
It may he said without irreverence that
the part hitherto played by the Jewish
scriptures in governing the great Asiatic
dependency has been insignificant. It will
probably remain so. Nor is there much
evidence to show that, even if the bulk of
the inhabitants accepted the European
Trinity instead of their own gods, any great
benefit would result, so far, at least, as this
world is concerned. European nations
have enjoyed in some instances the
blessings of the true faith for 15 or 16
centuries with the result that at the present
moment millions of young men go to bed
every night with rifles and ammunition
within easy reach. Hence, in order to hold
India there appears at present to be no
better method than the primitive one of
braining those who desire to take it. In a
word, the country was not only won by the
sword, but will have to be retained, if
retained at all, by the same weapon. The
case is but a modem illustration of the well-
known dictum, to place rather more trust in
powder than in Providence.

At the present time considerable atten-
tion is focussed on the broad tracts of
country drained by the Indus and ex-
tending from the foot of the Himalayas to
the sea under the Northern Tropic. It is
probably in the neighbourhood of this great
Punjaub stream that India will he won or
lost. For many years past the conquerors
have kept a jealous eye on this north-western
border-land, which is occupied by the Sikhs,
the fiercest of warriors, and which is being
daily approached by the Russians. So long
as Britain holds the sea, danger can only
come from the north-west, except, as in 1857,
when the trouble is entirely internal. Within
the last week or two, brief telegrams of
ominous import have came from this region,
or rather from the region just to the north,
whore the Himalayas, having run themselves
out, degenerate into the Hindoo Koosh,
or form little knots of mountainous outlying
sentries, as if to guard the upper angle of
the Punjaub. It is about here that, after
some centuries of gradual advance, the Cos-
sack has at last run into the Afghan-
impinged upon him, so to say—and there
they stand at this moment biting thumbs at
eacli other with every prospect of arbitrating
with the bayonet before long. In the mean-
time, two spectators, one from the extreme
east, the other from the far west of the old
continent —one with a pig-tail, the other
with spats—stand by to show fair play or to
take a hand in the dispute, according to cir-
cumstances. Nobody supposes the Muscovite
wants the barren Afghan rocks or would risk
a Jewish soldier for a right-of-way through
one of the valleys, except as a highway to
the fruitful plains further south.
* * *
To state the case properly we must go
hack. Considerably over a hundred years
ago a Frenchman, who happened to he in
India, thought that with good fighting,
good allies, and good luck, an Empire might
be collected from the ruins of the Mogul
power and held together by a little pluck.
He would have done it, too, but for the
inevitable Briton who, with the modesty of
his countrymen, observed, “If empires are
to be had for the asking, I don’t see why
I should remain silent.” So Robert Clive
cut in. He did more—he cut the Gaul out
and, with a creditable absence of favoritism
—combined with a rare aptitude for imitat-
ing signatures—he served everybody else
the same way. France might have had the
country by sending out a few regiments of
real soldiers and not sending the scum of the
Faubourgs, hut the reigning Bourbon of the
day was more interested in mistresses than
in Moguls, so India slipped through M.
Crapaud’s fingers and fell into J. Bull’s
arms where she has remained ever since.
To do Johnny B. justice, he has stuck to her
with perseverance, probably for her dowry,
for over a century. But the question is now
cropping up on all sides—can he stick to her
much longer ?

For a long time past the Russian has been
moving south and south-west. They were
the only ways open to him. The north was
blocked by ice ; the east by China, and the
west by Europe. Again, the nations he had
to over-run towards the south were nomadic,
disunited and weak. Then there was the
further object of being within striking
distance of the British, so that future diplo-
matic notes between the two empires might
be written in full view of the fact that
100,000 good Russian troops, accompanied
by more than double the number of Central
Asian canaille, were not so far from the
Indus. For a long time, British statesmen
and writers made merry at the idea of Russia’s
being able to move large bodies of men across
the immense stretch of inhospitable country
between the Caspian and Cabul. Even a
few years ago Lord Salisbury told the
London alarmists to take down their maps
and reckon the spaces to be traversed.
To-day, when telegrams come from England
reporting scuffles between Muscovites and
Afghans at the head water's of the Indus, it
is pretty certain that the distance has been
negotiated somehow. It now remains to be
seen what means the Bi'itish have of stem-
ming this constantly-advancing wave, of
keeping it from breaking on the Punjaub
when the next international complications
give the signal, and of sweeping Lower
India, as many other conquering waves have
swept it from the same quarter.
# # *
The white force in India is about 70,000
men fit, probably, to meet any equal number
in the world. Unfortunately, these cannot
be concentrated in the north-west without
risking a rebellion all through the central and
southern parts of the peninsula. For there
is no disguising the fact —it leaks out in the
bazaars, in the native press, in the semi-
independent States, and in a thousand
different ways —that throughout the Great
Dependency John Bull is no favourite.
The British can conquer, but they cannot
be compared with the Russians for ingratiat-
ing themselves with native races. Whether
through coldness or pride, formality or
arrogance, they offend native susceptibilities
at every turn. It might be thought that,
with a population of 250,000,000 to fallback
upon for recruits, armies could he raised
that would not only stem any Russian
advance hut sweep it hack through the
lately-acquired Khanates almost to the
Caspian. Such might be the case if the
armies could be depended on. It is here the
difficulty comes in. Not only will white
troops have to be left behind when a move-
ment is made north-west, but, for various
reasons, it will be impossible to place in the
front line any but a few native corps d’elite
chosen not alone for their superior discipline
but for the loyalty of the nations from which
they have been selected. For it should not be
forgotten that India, like Europe, is a con
geries of nations, most of them bitterly hos-
tile to each other, but, unlike Europe, held
together in a Roman peace by the mastery of
a distant and, in their eyes, unscrupulous
Power. In short, to hold India, England
will be forced to depend much more upon
the number of white troops she can place in
line than ever she has had to do since Clive
conquered at Plassy. A check at the open-
ing of the ball would mean tumult behind
and the assembling of hordes of semi-savages
in front eager to take a hand in shaking the
Pagoda-tree.
# * #
From what has been said, it follows that,
if India is to be held, it will only he by the
power of Britain to pour in a few hundred
thousand white troops when the necessity
arrives. This can only be done by universal
military service at home. But it is almost
certain that the people of the United
Kingdom would sooner see Hindostan drift
away from the Empire than submit to
such a measure. Ever since Cromwell and
his Major-Generals showed the British people
what military rule was, the people have dis-
played an invincible repugnance to universal
liability to serve. They did not resort to it
for the purpose of holding America, nor
during the long, doubtful struggle against
the power of Napoleon. True it is that
sturdy felons wore released from gaol in
batches on the condition of serving against
Washington in one hemisphere or against
Soult in another. But, for reasons which
it would he tedious to give in detail—some
of them connected with the class or caste
distinctions still so potent in British society
—the repugnance to general conscription is
still so deep-seated that not even the threat
of a foreign landing would overcome it. The
idea of Lord Tomnoddy carrying a musket
beside Tommy Atkins and rubbing shoulders
with the latter in camp and public-house is
not to he entertained. Yet, the time is at
hand, may be upon us any day, when, with-
out this universal liability to defend the
Empire at all points, Great Britain will be
forced back into the domain in which she
has hitherto been supreme— the domain of
the four seas.
Manufacturing Australian Imperialism.
Parson Fitchett, late editor of the Melbourne
Daily Telegraph, declares, per medium of the
Pall Mall Gazette, that “Australian senti-
ment is even more Imperialist than public
opinion in Great Britain itself.” He describes
Australians as being “aggressively proud of
the Empire and of the Flag,” and laughs to
scorn the very supposition of the existence of
any such thing as an Australian National senti-
ment of Independence. He describes Austra-
lians thus:—
They are, . . . even absurdly jealous of their
partnership in the Empire, and to describe them as being
eager to “ cut the painter” is the most absurd travesty
of facts.
Perhaps so. Perhaps Premier Debus, of New
South Wales, lias never declared that an Inde-
pendent Republic is Australia’s inevitable
destiny. Perhaps, ex-Premiers MTlwraith
and More head, of Queensland, have never
advocated Australian separation from England.
Perhaps ex-Premier O’Loghlen, of Victoria,
and other prominent politicians in Fitchett’s
own recent colony, have never talked of
“ cutting the painter.” Perhaps the Imperial
Institute is not the laughing-stock of the
colonies. Perhaps every itinerant Imperial
Federation lecturer has not been a frost in Aus-
tralia, has not been refused a hearing, and has
not been sat upon even by such conservative
journals as the Sydney Morning Herald and
the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Fitchett flies
to the one stock act of insanity that can give
any colour to his false presentment of Australian
aspirations :
It was the Imperial strain in Australian blood which in-
spired the Soudan contingent of New South Wales. The
spectacle of what seemed disaster to the Empire simply
set Australian blood on fire.
If so, it is the Australian democratic strain in
this people’s blood that makes a repetition of
that freak impossible. We agree with Mr.
Fitchett that—
The reflex effect of the despatch of the Sydney contin-
gent to the Soudan upon the Australian colonies them-
selves was very marked.
The Soudan contingent died of popular ridicule.
Its only memory now is its patron goat. Even
its pewter medals are forgotten. It is chiefly
remembered as a wild joke which provided a
well-paid picnic for a number of unemployed
ex-soldiers ; when it is seriously recollected, it
is as a hideous lampoon of impossible future
tragic absurdities. Parson Fitchett must be
insanely oblivions to the pulsations of Austra-
lian life wdien he rashly writes :
I am confident that if to-day any great disaster smote,
or threatened to smite, the Empire ; if an English fleet
had been destroyed in the Channel, or a new mutiny
broke out in India, the colonies would leap to the side of
the mother land, and stand ready to pour out their
treasure and spill their blood in its cause.
They might and they might not. The majority
of the chances are that Australian colonists
would promptly look after themselves and their
home belongings, if the outlook became criti-
cally warlike. Even if it were admitted for the
sake of argument —and it would be an un-
warranted admission to make—that a majority
of Australians place Imperial before Colonial
interests—are, in fact, Britishers first and
Australians a bad second, The Bulletin would
still confidently predict that never again will
any Australian Government dare to propose
the expenditure of a single penny of public
money for foreign warlike purposes. If the
colonies ever do “leap to the side of the
mother land,” the feat will only be performed
by volunteers in their private capacities —
buccaneering mercenaries who probably would,
for prospect of loot, as readily tender their
swords to the Emperor of China to suppress a
rebellion against the Manchurian dynasty.
Parson Fitchett might as well attempt to
demonstrate the non-existence of the moon,
because it is invisible at certain periods, as to
deny the vitality of a growing sentiment of
Republicanism in Australia. His perplexity of
argument is irritably evidenced by his falling
back upon that gorgeous historian, Froude ;
“ Any speaker in Australia,” Mr. Froude wrote in his
“ Oceana,” “ who advocated Separation at a public meet-
ing would be hooted down,” and that is as true to-day as
when Mr. Froude penned the words. “ The Australians,”
he added, “are proud of belonging to a nationality on
whose Hag the sun never sets ; and Separation, if it comes,
will be no act of theirs.” How shrewdly Mr. Froude
interpreted Australian sentiment, a thousand facts prove.
A few years ago, for example, a cluster of Irish members
of Parliament in Victoria signed what was known as the
“ Grattan Address.” The address was a bit of very mild
Home Rule literature, and yet the act of signing it cost
every member of this group, save one, his seat when the
next general election arrived !
Froudesquerio and Fitchettism ! Not a month
goes by but Separation is publicly advocated
somewhere in Australia, and is cheered to the
echo. The fate of the signatories to the
“ Grattan Address” was itself a lively proof
of the vitality of Australian Nationalism. It
was not a locally political issue; it was an
ebullition of religious sectarianism. It roused the
animus of professional Protestantism, the
catspaw's of which were beguiled into
a voting crusade against it. But it
further enlisted the sympathies of that
large Australian majority which declines
to allow sectarian strife to be imported
from old-world countries, and thrown into the
midst of this democracy as a bone for venomous
and bloody wranglings. Young Australia has
declared a rule absolute for the divorce of the
State from religion. Complete credal freedom
is one of the inviolable pillars of a democratic
constitution. No political crisis in Australia
has ever yet turned upon the issue, Imperialism
v. Republicanism, but the harvest is ripening for
that decisive occasion. Australia’s final destiny
never has been nor ever can be in doubt. It
was even predicted half-a-century ago by the
late Dr. Lang, a statue to whom was erected
the other day amid the loud acclaim
of our people. The apathy with which the
Imperialist fireworks of the late Federation
Convention have been received throughout Aus-
tralia is but one sign among all the evidences of
the time. In spite of strenuous artificial boom-
ing by plotting politicians, in spite of the
tinsel glamour and pinchbeck ostentation en-
wrapped around the whole posing, the idea of
“Federation under the Crown” has never
stirred the popular pulse nor awakened one
real echo of public approval. Sir George Grey
was the only Conventionist whose utterances
vibrated to Australia’s vital centres; and his
magic was the music of National Independence.
So palpably has the pretence of the Convention
palled that Australian Government after Aus-
tralian Government, forgetting each its past
Imperialist heroics, has weariedly let the lifeless
abortion drop until a more convenient season
presents itself for resuscitating it. That more
convenient season will never arrive. The
Federation to which Australia will pledge itself
unreservedly will be of unforced free birth —the
offspring of self-reliance and disloyalty to the
Crown. Fitchett’s Australian Imperialists are
phantoms, manufactured by a diseased fancy,
with the exception of a few nonentities whose
petty souls can be purchased at any time witli
a greasy smile and a half-inch of silk ribbon.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Justice and Clothes.
A few days ago Petek Howe, M.P., and
James Miller, both of the lately gone bung
Australian Mercantile Loan and Guarantee
Company, were duly sentenced by Judge lnnes
to seven years gaol for undue fooling with the
assets of that lost corporation. In the light of
the evidence the sentence seems to meet the
case admirably ; and if sundry other directors,
representing various companies that are already
burst, and various others that ought to be
burst, should presently go the same road, the
results will probably prove beneficial to the
public at large. The average director doesn’t
get into gaol often enough. In a large
number of cases he is an individual with no
qualification ; he begins by holding the smallest
number of shares which will qualify him for a
seat on the board, and when he gets his seat,
he sells, but does not transfer them, and there-
after he draw's his fees under false pretences,
and plays with other people’s money joyously,
having none of his own at stake. No director
that we ever heard of has got into gaol for this,
though several hundred most assuredly ought
to get there. Then he votes himself handsome
overdrafts and loans on no visible security, and
this is as strictly wholesale stealing as if he
took his overdraft out of the “bank” by
means of a crowbar and a jemmy. Very few'
directors get into gaol for this either—in fact, at
the present moment we can’t recollect one. Also,
he votes for the purchase of his own land by the
company, and values the land himself, whereby
it occasionally happens that a hunk of rock in
the back-blocks, worth something like £lO on a
liberal estimate, is passed oft on the share-
holders for £5OO or £lOOO. It is very seldom
indeed that a director gets locked up for this
either, but Messrs. Howe and Miller did the
business with such phenomenal clumsiness that
they just managed to crowd themselves safely
into quod. In a general way a fraudulent
director has almost to burst his way Into a gaol
if he wants to get there, and the success of
Peter Howe and his mate in getting themselves
put away is a surprising circumstance. The
evidence against them was absolutely conclusive,
but it took the most vigorous and vociferous
efforts on the part of Judge Innes to secure a
conviction, and it was only by dint of almost
unjustifiable pressure that the verdict of
“ guilty ” was extracted. It would have been
a lasting disgrace had the verdict not been ob-
tained, but yet it would really appear that if
the Judge had been even a shade less urgent, the
result would have been a failure. The average
juryman, after all, has a superstitious reverence
for the prisoner in the shiny black coat. Ho
returns his verdict cheerfully, and on the most
insufficient evidence, to hang or imprison the
individual in a tattered suit, but in nine cases
out of ten he will acquit the fat, well-dressed
swindler without the slightest hesitation.
The only swindler who doesn’t get a show under
present conditions, is the one who hasn’t stolen
enough to enable him to buy good clothes with


the proceeds. Therefore, if justice is to he a
square and honest thing, and all men are to
have the same chance, every prisoner who is
tried on a serious charge should be supplied
with a decent suit, so that he may only be
hanged for his crime instead of being hanged
for the tears in his coat. The clothes ought to
be reasonably up to date and suitable to his
complexion, and he should be allowed to carry
a shiny bell-topper in his hand. The disused
bell-topper of Mr. Howe, duly ironed up for the
occasion by the Government laundryman,
might, for instance, serve a long line of
prisoners, and save many of them from receiv-
ing unjust sentences, and as the accused would
simply carry it in his hand the question of lit
is a matter of no importance. Also, each
prisoner ought to be shaved and have Ids hair
nicely done in a George-street manner -and
even then the results would probably be un-
satisfactory. For when two men came up for
trial in two equally elegant black coats the
jury would convict the man who wore the
Government garment, and would promptly
acquit the fellow who had paid for his own suit
out of his plunder.
Faddle for the Farmers.
J. B. Patterson, the able-bodied North
Country windbag, who travels Victoria in the
interests of Her Gracious Majesty and the
British Lion, has been loading up the worthy
agriculturists of Castlemaine and district with
reasons why the doctrine of One-man-one-vote
is a vain thing. Victoria, according to the
inspired Jingo, is a “propertied democracy,”
and the result of restricting each man to a vote
for his manhood would be the disfranchisement
of property and consequently the “ disfranchise-
ment of the democracy.” Involved fiddledeedee
like this may suffice to stagger a roomfull of
Ducolics after a heavy feed, but it won’t pass
muster with any plain, unbiassed person who
considers it on an empty stomach. In the first
place, Victoria isn’t a propertied democracy,
inasmuch as a large number of the adult male
inhabitants are too young, too poorly paid, or
too often out of work to have obtained what
the representative, fat-headed Tory calls a
“stake in the country.” This, without men-
tioning the hard-up class, consisting of a few
constitutional loafers and many who are
knocked out through ill-luck, lack of self-
confidence, or a long bout of sickness, all
of whom would be glad to possess the
tail-end of a muttor shop, or a chunk
of cold meat in the country. In the
second place, there couldn’t exist a democracy
which founded its right to vote on a property
basis, because no kind of democrat except the
J.B.P. brand desires to puff up to the poll in
the capacity of a terrace of houses, a well-
stocked station, a prosperous commercial under-
taking, or a quantity of corner allotments. He
simply wishes to vote as a man, one man—not
as several investments in land which ought to
belong to the State. In the third place, the
English language doesn’t admit of property
being disfranchised, and even if that arrange-
ment were sanctioned by the rules of grammar
it couldn’t come to pass, because a property-
owner is put upon the voters’ roll as such, and,
strictly speaking, votes by virtue of his “ stake
in the country.” Likewise, the fact of his stake
being divided into several portions doesn’t
touch the main point that one man can only
have one stake, anyway. Finally, the mind of
Patterson must endeavour to grasp the almighty
truth that the disfranchisement .of a democracy
is the wildest political impossibility ever con-
ceived by any shallow sophist at a farmers’
luncheon. Meanwhile, however, it appears
that the apostle of proputty looks scornfully
upon the One-man-one-vote agitation because it
isn’t calculated to put “a chicken in the pot”
of every hungry inhabitant of Victoria. Still,
it will undoubtedly go a little way in that
direction, and if the immediate result is to put
noisy old roosters like Patterson in the pot
democracy will have much to be thankful for.
.
A more extraordinary political spectacle than
that exhibited by the Victorian Government
over Munro’s Franchise Bill would be difficult
to conceive. Premier Munro, on behalf of the
Government, accepted certain amendments in
Committee of the Assembly, and a measure vir-
tually affirming the principle of One-man-one-
vote was passed on to the Legislative Council.
Ihe leader of the Government there, Sir
Frederick Sargood, moved the second reading
of the Bill as a matter of courtesy, but
announced that he and the other ' Council
members of the Government were opposed to
us main provisions. In other words, the Vic-
torian Cabinet is divided against itself on
ie most important present question of public
po icy Munro has striven to hold the reputa-
i !° n °i , eing a strong-willed Premier. Sargood
us deliberately defied Munro’s leadership.
>ere can be but one legitimate outcome of
such an anomalous position. Munro must
leconstruct his Government or resign. The
soft-goods consciences of Sargood and his
ouncil co-Ministers were blind to the fact that
( j n °t honourably continue to hold
l° l olios while directly antagonising the
declared policy of their leader. They must be
rown out violently since they don’t under-
wheu i to resign gracefully. But the

know absolutely nothing of what passes outside

well be summoned from a town a hundred miles
away. Again, these separate men, should there
be default or misconduct on the part of the
gaol authorities, are likely to side with the
latter in order to avoid their wrath and to obtain
amelioration in their own condition. These con-
vict-jurors are right in their complaint, but may
pay a severe penalty for their temerity. The
coroner referred the complainants to the

to meet with little sympathy. The proper men
to summon on these juries are prisoners whose
term of sentence has nearly expired, and who,
on that ground, need have little fear of the
consequences of any verdict they may give.
Ihf, Bulletin fails to see what the Labour
party has to gain by opposing the election of
Edmund Barton for East Sydney. It is true
that the 1 )ibbs-Barton alliance is a grotesque
anomaly if viewed from the standpoint of their
disagreement concerning Australian Federation,
but it is equally true that Australian Federa-
tion, as formulated by the recent Convention,
has dropped out of the political running. The
Convention Bill is as dead as an antediluvian
fossil. It is most improbable that Australian
I' education can be artificially forced in any
political hothouse; it must be a natural growth,
or the sudden countermove to a threatening
danger. At any rate, the Convention Bill forms
no part of the Hibbs policy, except as a
measure to be mutilated with a free hand, and
reconstructed in a national mould. It is becom-
ing more and more apparent that the old Federal
Council of Australia, despised by Parkes
from motives of ignored vanity, was a whole-
some and natural incubator of Australian
union, which might have been accomplished by
easy stages of necessary federal legislation,
until, by the creation of courts of common
jurisdiction, an Australian Court of Final
Appeal, and even a Customs Union, the final
step of complete partnership would have been
a very ordinary process of development. A
suddenly - forced statutory combination of
antagonistic elements was bound, like a chemi-
cal experiment, to end in either a disintegrating
fizzle or a dangerous explosion. So far, Australia
has experienced the fizzle. Apart from Federa-
tion disagreements, however—and these do not
really affect the present political situation in
New South Wales— Hibbs and Barton are
harmoniously mated in points of policy, and
the cue of the Labour party should be to extract
as much party benefit as possible from the
materials immediately available. Until Labour
is presented with the excalibur of One-man-
one-vote, it cannot hope to hew down for itself
all the obstacles that stand between present
social and economic conditions and the achieve-
ment of needed labour-reforms. The united
power of Labour should be concentrated first
on gaining the electoral key which alone can
unlock to Labour representatives the Parlia-
ment and the Government of the country.
Under date 10th September, James H. Kelly
writes us from San Francisco :
Editor Bulletin, — Sir. — Allow me space to publish
some facts which may interest your readers. lam a
labouring man, lived 18 years in Australia and Maoriland,
and worked principally in mines and on railroads. Six-
teen months ago 1 took passage from Sydney to San
tlancisco. It is for the benefit of my co-workers in
Australia that I now summarise my 15 months’ American
experiences, from a working-man's point of view. While
in the States I have worked on railroads and other works
affording the best market for my labour. I have travelled
through Washington, Idaho, and Colorado, three of the
best States for the miner, railroader, or woodsman, they
being new and well back from the crowded East which
means more pay and less competition in the labour-
market. All labourers and three-fourths of- the miners
here uork ten hours per day. The Southern Pacific
R. R. Co. work their men 11 hours daily, winter and
summer, in nearly all cases. The company or contractor
board their men, the latter finding their own bedding.
Labourers’ wages per day run from one dollar and sixty
cents to two dollars per day in this western country—
very much less in the eastern States. Miners’ wages
from 2J dollars (10s.) to 3)- (145.) ; labourers’ board
per week costs from 5 to 5J dollars ; miners’ board,
fi to 7 dollars. Pay-day occurs every month, the
company or contractor keeping back one month’s pay
which means that after working two months the work-
man receives one month’s pay. This combination also
runs a store stocked with boots, tobacco, candles, soap,&c.,
vended at an advance of from 70 to 120 per cent on town
prices; then again, if a man quit work before pay-day
his time-cheque is discounted from 15 to 25 per cent.
This is the general system, hut I must say it is not
according to law. This country is over-stocked with all
kinds of European and Asiatic labour. The Chinaman is
an important factor here in the building and maintaining
of railroads. I have seen them in British Columbia
making mortar and going right info the building busi-
ness. Altogether for a labouring man this place is, in my
opinion, a long way behind Australia, and 1 would
strongly advise miners and labourers to stay by the
country whose workmen’s motto is, “ eight hours for
manly labour, eight hours for balmy sleep, eight hours
for recreation, and our triple eight hours we keep.” 1
am informed by reliable and sterling men that the rail-
road repairers in the Eastern States and other such
workers’ pay per day, is from 90 to 135 cents-in English
money, 3s. 9d. to ss. (id. I am going back to Australia
next March.—Yours truly, James 11. Kelly, San Fran-
cisco, 10th Sept. 1891.

One gratifying result of the protective tariff
of Maoriland is the healthy stimulus given to
our woollen manufactures which, under Tory
misrule, were for long enough in a languishing
state,” says the Southlander. Little facts
like these constantly cropping up completely
extinguish all the dismal Freetrade prophecies
indulged in by the Sydney press when dealing
with Hibbs’ Protectionist manifesto. It is
curious, too, to note that Protectionist countries
are so enamoured of the ruin they experience
that they persist in wading more deeply into it.
England is very wroth "with America, for
instance, concerning its M'Kinley tariff, and
its Freetrade Press predicts immediate de-
struction of all American prosperity, but
Yankeeland deliberately prefers to rush to
destitution in its own fashion rather than
to live on imported British manufactures.
Similarly, Victoria is so disgusted with Protec-
tion that it is continually asking for more.
Again, whenever the London Times praised any
Imperialistic move of the arch-shuffler Parkes,
the Sydney dailies echoed the wise sweetness
of its enlightened opinions, and effervesced
with admiration at its intelligent grasp of Aus-
tralian affairs ; but now that the Times has
found occasion to praise Hibbs for attempting
to place New South Wales on a self-reliant
footing of independent industry, words fail such
journals—notably the H.T. t > express their
contempt for the dense ignorance of Australian
questions generally exhibited by London editors
and political economists. The mere fact that
the Times can speak favourably of protective
duties under any circumstances whatever is a
triumphant indication of the progress of pro-
tectionist principles in an unexpected quarter.
The Sydney Echo libels Premier Dices in this
fashion:—
Probably we have never had a Prime Minister who was
lesx under the control of capitalists and financiers than
Sir Henry Parses has been.
The Bulletin is obliged to the Echo for the
admission that Park es is under the control of
capitalists and financiers—look at his record !
for a period as long as the Jews were under the
control of Moses. Then-
lie does not understand finance.
This is just what Parkes does understand thor-
oughly. He is quite a master at raising a
loan.
And it has not been the habitof his life to consort much
with those who made public finance their study.
The members of his last two administrations
could tell a different tale if they would. But
the records of the Insolvency Court are
sufficient to satisfy the country that Parkes
has held a political retainer from the Calico-
Jimmy party from the day he turned his fiscal
coat.

The following ludicrously-eloquent poem in
praise of England, originally perpetrated by
one Henley in the National Observer (i.e.,
the old Scots Observer, in which Rudyard
Kipling was first introduced to the British
public), is reprinted for one sufficient reason.
It is the cry of J. Bull, the most self-
sufficient fat man who ever encumbered
creation. It is a frank acknowledgment
by Bull that he the said Bull —is
the noblest, grandest, and most courageous
individual on earth, that he is going to last for
ever, that he is the recognised flower of
humanity, that the universe wouldn't be worth
anything if he wasn’t in it, and that the Lord
may take a spell, for John Bull will keep things
straight while He is away. It is a candid
admission made by himself that he is the only
person who is exempt from the operation of the
laws of nature, and that nothing apart from
him is worth a curse, and, in short, it is the
widest, largest and most capacious hunk of
imbecile and diseased vanity that we have yet
met:—-
We are the Choice of the Will: God, when he gave th®
word
That called us into line, set in our hand a sword ;
Set us a sword to wield, none else could lift and draw,
And bade us forth to the sound of the trumpet of the
Law.
Erst and west and north, wherever the battle grew,
As men to a feast we flocked, the work of the Will to do.
Bent upon vast beginnings, bidding anarchy cease
(Had we hacked it to the Pit, we had left it in a place of
peace !)
Marching, building, sailing, pillar of cloud or fire,
Sons of the Will, we fought the fight of the Will, our sire.
Road was never so rough that we left its purpose dark ;
Stark was ever the sea, but our shins were yet more
stark.
We tracked the winds of the world to the roots of their
very thrones,
The secret parts of the world were salted with our bones ;
Till now the name of names, England, the name of might,
Flames from the Austral bounds to the ends of the
northern night.
And the call of her morning drum goes in a girdle of
sound,
Like the voice of the sun in song, the great globe round
and round;
And the shadow of her flag, when it blabs to the mother-
breeze,
Floats from shore to shore of the universal seas ;
And the loneliest death is fair with a memory of her
flowers,
And the end of the road to Hell with the sense of her
dews and showers.
Who says that we shall pass, or the fame of us fade and
die,
While the living stars fulfil their round in the living sky?
For the sire lives in his sons, and they pay their father’s
debt,
And the Lion has left a whelp wherever his claw was set.
And the Lion in his whelps, his whelps that none shall
brave,
Is but less strong than Time and the all-devouring Grave !
The master-hairdressers of Sydney propose
that their journeymen be paid according to their
abilities—classification to be made on the report
of a board of examiners. Just think of it—a
board of barbers !
The N.S.W. Employers’ Union has ap-
pointed a parliamentary committee to nominate
candidates and fight parliamentary elections.
Property is now politically represented in all the
Australian by numerous powerful organisations
besides its strenuous and unflagging advocate,
the daily press. The Pastoralists’ Unions,
the Employers’ Unions, the Shipowners’ Asso-
ciations and the bogus “National” Associations
and “Patriotic Leagues,” are all allied and fede-
rated and re-federated and cross-federated—fede-
rated forwards, backwards, sideways, and in-and-
outjon the fifteen-two, fifteen-four, fifteen-six-and-
a-pair-eight principle. No two of these organisa-
tions are pulling different ways. They are all
ready, if need be, to sacrifice their own father at
the abattoirs to get their candidates into the
Legislature. On the other hand, the present
tendency of the Labour Leagues—industriously
encouraged by the daily press—is to split up each
into half-a-dozen sections.
In “ silvery - tongued ” Kelynack, not
merely the Methodist Church alone, but the
ecclesiastical bodies of Australia have lost their
one great natural orator. He was a man to whom
ever, an agnostic journalist or an Anglican Bishop
could listen with delight. His Centennial sermon
was, without exception, the most striking
oratorical effort delivered during that period of
gush, gorge, and guzzle, and his preroration,
which included Kendall’s lines, “One hundred
years ago,” could not have been soon forgotten by
those who heard it. This discourse, by the way,
was first delivered in Bathurst (N.S. W.) Wesleyan
Church, and, curiously enough, the editor of the
Bathurst Times, who was about as regular a
frequenter of chapels as most journalists, heard
it and reported it in full in his paper, so impressed
was he by its unforced eloquence. Dr. Kelynack
was intensely annoyed at the circumstance of
publication, as he had intended his delivery to be
merely an experiment for his own guidance in
repeating the sermon in Sydney. He complained
to the editor of the circumstance, and was barely
placated by the response, “Well, Doctor, we can’t
let the Sydneyites have the only magnificent
speech of the celebration.”
Concerning the Epidemic.
W hen yon catch the influenza you must dodder
into bed,
And wonder what’s the matter, with a hot and
aching head:
Nor heed such airy trifles as the shivers or a
cough—
But cuss the man who tells you, “you must try
and shake it off. ”
Your sense of smell will vanish, your ability to
taste
Will vainly try to battle with a horrid yellow
paste
Lhat sticks upon the tongue and makes the flavour
of your drink
Like a pint of bitter aloes in a quart of marking-
ink.
Then you get the collywobbles in a casual kind of
way—
It mostly comes upon you at the dawning of the
day ;
\ ou spurn the choicest vittles, and at broth you
cannot look,
And you really long for nothing but to spiflicate
the cook.
J t s fun, the influenza—such a comical disease,
There’s a world of quiet humour in its incidental
sneeze:
It hasn t much beginning, and it seldom seems to
end,
And it never kills a patient till he’s fairly on the
mend.
That nice old man, the doctor, too, is also very
quaint,
He s as good a joke, God bless him! as the
horrible complaint;
He mentions that “ you’ve got it,” and he wags
his addled head,
And the upshot of his wisdom is—you’d better
stop in bed.
If his talent’s transcendental he will ask to see
your tongue,
And pass some observations on your liver and
your lung,
But it’s past his comprehension, and there’s little
he can tell,
Except that when you’re better you’ll be feeling
pretty well.
>So catch the influenza, which is hanging round
your door,
Count the flies upon the ceiling for a week or
two, or more ;
And avoid all sorts of physic save the life-blood
of the toff
Who saunters in to tell you, “ you must try and
shake it off.”

A Maoriland man lias got an action against
a book-canvasser on an entirely new basis. He
had ordered the customary big book in a whole
swag of monthly parts, but afterwards repenting
of the volume he refused to accept delivery, and
threatened the canvasser with personal damage
and battery. Being a prudent man, that indi-
vidual came along silently one evening, and
delivered the publication by leaving it on the
front doorstep. The buyer didn’t know it was
there, but an hour afterwards lie rushed out to
look at a dog-fight, and fell over the literature,
and broke his leg. He is now suing the canvasser
for damages on the ground that the book on the
doorstep was the cause of his mishap, and as he
will probably get a jury of twelve infuriated book-
buyers to consider the case he has an alluring
prospect ahead.
Harry Stockdale, who recently took a
party of buffalo-shooters from Sydney to the
Northern Territory, is said to have gone as local
representative of an Adelaide syndicate which
recently leased a tract of country 40 x 60 miles
square, extending back from Port Essington, and
which it is proposed to stock in the sweet bye-
and-bye. Meanwhile Stockdale will explore and
likewise exploit the country in the hopes of
securing enough buffaloes and ponies to pay ex-
penses. What he will do with the ponies when
he gets them no man knows, but the buffalo-hides
bring at present about per lb., with unlimited
demand. For buggy-brake leathers nothing beats
buffalo-hide, as it wears for ever. The heads and
horns also bring good prices if well mounted.
Apropos, Stockdale will be bitterly disappointed
over the failure of his taxidermist to join the party
at Cooktown as arranged.
It is cabled from London that in “further
concentration tests carried out by Mr. Luhrig on
Victorian tailings, Bendigo tailings,, assaying only
some few pennyweights to the ton, concentrated
sozs. to the ton at a cost of Od. per ton. St.
Arnaud tailings, assaying 6 pennyweights, con-
centrated 15ozs. to the ton.’’ This, The Bulletin
has no hesitation in saying, is, on the face of it,
an absurd over-statement of Luhrig’s success; his
process, on the figures given, would almost pro-
duce so much gold as to affect the price of that
metal. It has always been reckoned that by ordi-
nary stamper and after-treatment much over a
third of the gold contained (as per assay) in ordi-
nary quartz is lost; but if we have in Luhrig's
process a treatment which will disclose and save
(and at so ridiculous a price) ten times the amount
of gold shown by assay, we are on the verge of an
era when most of us will be able to boil our tea in
golden billies.
One night in the Victorian Assembly
would reduce the Speaker of the House of Com-
mons to a state of gibbering lunacy. Aghast at
the vulgar outrages upon hoary tradition, and the
ruthless trampling down of usages which the
British Constitution holds sacred, that august
personage would rush outside to see the heavens
fall. And when the heavens didn’t fall, and no
earthquake showed signs of coming off, the guar-
dian of British parliamentary etiquette would
totter up to the nearest policeman and ask to be
taken off to a padded cell before he became
violent. This is apropos to the awful fact that
Tom Bent recently referred, during a debate,
to the ex-Premier in the following plain, unvar-
nished terms: “As Gillies says, that is too thin.”
The history of the world, probably, contains no
other such instance of senatorial blasphemy being
fired off in this incidental manner. \Vhat is fame,
what is honour, what is a distinguished repre-
sentative position, when a short, fat person, who
quite recently figured as a Chief Minister of the
Crown, has to sit within his own stronghold and
hear himself casually referred to as “Gillies?”
One can now understand Duncan straining to
tighten the silken bonds which bind us to a dear
old mother country, where a man of his standing
can only be mentioned in the ’Ouse as “ the Right
Honourable the Member for Somewhere,” and
where an outbreak of irreverence like Bent’s would
bring the Sergeant-at-Arms upon the scene, and
send a thrill of horror through a sidy, old com-
munity. Meanwhile, it certainly looks as though
Victoria were going to the dogs.


It is most convenient to have a lirst-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

T. S. RICHARDSON,
General Manage*
Parkes: His Diary.
If we gml at Parkes once more it is not that
we think him any longer potent for evil, for he
is now so low (inasmuch as he has been spat
upon l>y his erstwhile press toadies) that he
must be regarded as impotent even for harm ;
but we refer to him again so that the historian
of the future should not be tricked by the
malicious ingenuity of his former friend, the
S.M. Herald, to found upon a recent column
of that ponderous sheet, any portion of the
Parkesian mythos which is certain to be
originated in a century or so from now. The
enlightened intelligence of the 20th or 21st
century will never grasp the fact that a people
to close to it in point of time could ever have
accepted Parkes as a symbol of what is great
in statesmanship or venerable in life ; and upon
the mere bald circumstance that he filled so
pretentious a place in the life of this day, these
centuries will base, almost of a surety, a belief
in his essential greatness. Upon the 8.M.
Herald, and other daily papers, the judgment
of the future as to Parkes will depend in a
large measure, but the historian of the coining
time, not informed as we contemporaries are,
of the revulsion of feeling which that journal
has experienced with respect to its whilom idol,
might take its late publication of what pro-
fess to be quotations, verbatim et literatim,
from Sir Henry Parkes’ Diary, as a proof that
it continues to view him with admiration and
respect. But we men of to-day, knowing how
Parkes has before now been the victim of the
Herald’s malignity when he has been excluded
from power, can interpret its recent action.
Unlike the annalist of the future, we are not to
be misled. When the leading journal of New
South Wales published, on the 28th October,
“ Extracts from Sir Henry Parkes’ Diary,” it
was not intending to honour him or to inform
the public mind. No, it was spitting upon him
with the coarse virulence which has ever
characterised it in its relations to creatures who
are down, in the hope that it would induce its
readers to add to the stream of expectoration.
We must confess that, with a success quite
exceptional for the Herald, the hope is likely
to be realised,
# *• #
There are some persons, possibly, who really
believe that the “ Extracts ” were genuine, but
they must be few 7 indeed, and not to be found
outside of Tarban Creek or the Opposition-room
in New South Wales Assembly ; for what man
possessed of his wits could, for a second,
believe that a statesman—we will apply the
term simply as a concession to the argument—-
would, after a defeat in the Legislature which
signified the annihilation of his “life-work”
and the destruction of everything that he held
worthy of honour, go home and extract from
the trough in his piggery such hogwash as this :
Monday, October 19. —“ Left home this morning at 8.S0,
and was at the office by 9 o’clock. Many things required
my attention. An Executive Council at 10, to wind up
Ministerial work. Ministers met in Cabinet at 11.30. I
explained that the motion on Thursday night was one
which, though it did not necessitate our retirement, fully
justified our considering and deciding upon the situation
for ourselves ; we had gone as far as men could go without
losing all sense of honour and self-respect to meet the
unreasonable demands of the so-called Lahour-party, and
that 1 could not see that we were called upon to go fur-
ther. As we had not a majority without their inconsis-
tent votes, coupled with their rapacious demands, the
course best calculated to’maintain our own reputations,
and to serve the public interest and the true Cause of Par-
liamentary government, was to tender our resignations.
My colleagues unanimously concurred in this view. . .
The Assembly met at the usual hour. There was a large
attendance of members, and the spaces for strangers were
crowded. In a few quiet words I announced tur resigna-
tion, and went home happy.”
Anri the next day we have this gorgeously
bogus rhapsody : —
THE DAY AFTER.
Tuesday, 20th October.—Rose this morning a little
before 5 o’clock, after a long night’s refreshing sleep. As
soon as I went outside, my dog, “Maori,” came to greet
me, and the squirrels were playing among the boughs in
their ample cage. 1 went on to the front verandah and
sat down, with the waters of the bay all bright before
me. The sun was rising on the smoke-hazy city like a
disc of dazzling fire ; the peacock in his gorgeous robes
was sitting on the old lawn gate ; and three yards from
me the blackbird was singing his sweet matin songs. How
different from the weary waking after a tumultuous night
in the Assembly ! And, with God’s blessing, I may have
many such mornings. ... At home before six. What
a blessed change !
Absurd: not even the intelligence of the
average Herald editor could swallow so
monstrous a pill. The Herald may be im-
posed upon (as, we believe, it was a week or
two ago by alleged quotations from a diary of
1788) ; but it surely could not accept the
foregoing as authentic pages from an ex-
Premier’s diary.
# # *
For, it must be apparent even to the immature
perceptions of the Herald, that a statesman
of Napoleonic ambitions, retiring from his
Waterloo, would not dally with dogs, nor
would he have an eye to the playful squirrel
while his mind was occupied in tracing an
analogy between his position and that of the
coon who had just come down to Davy Croc-
kett’s gun. So distinguished a man would not
have been contemplating the rising sun; his
thoughts would have been fixed upon the setting
orb ; he would have seen in the peacock’s plum-
age evidence of the truth of the old superstition
that for the man who owns one of those
lustrous birds there is shame in reserve, and
he would have had no ear for the matin melody
of the blackbird, but would have been, perforce,
compelled to listen to the cynical gibe of the
kookaburra. For him there would have been
no enjoyment in the sense of freedom after re-
straints to which he had reluctantly yielded,
but only that biting consciousness of defeat,
and the poignant recognition that, after all, he
must be worthless and accursed by gods and
men, if this !—this ! ! this ! ! 1 was the end of
a lifetime of effort. 4

It is the paltriest, most imbecile of frauds,
this attempt to delude, not the judgment
of the present, but the judgment of the future.
There is nothing so contemptible, nothing
so immoral, as manufactured evidence ; it is
a species of forgery designed to deceive and
defraud the unborn. For the creatures who,
conscious and of malice aforethought, resolve
to mislead posterity, no term of reprehension
can be too strong, and their performance is
all more contemptible because it is so
wretWtedly done. Had the Sydney Morning
Herald been anxious to do the fair thing, and
the square thing, and really desirous of showing
to the present generation, and to posterity,
what sort of meditations a great statesman
indulges in in the sanctified hearing of
The dear confessor of his diary’s page,
it would not have given us so superficial a
composition as these supposititious extracts. It
would have shown us—and the future —the
great man in his agony. It would have quoted
from the “ extracts ” of that October morning
expressions which, like the salt tears of remorse,
burn the surface they fall upon ; and, after that
natural venting of the overburdened spirit, it
would have given us a cool, calm, clear analysis
of the causes which had led to the catastrophe.
It would have given us reflections which were
the mintage of a great heart in the crisis of its
history ; it would have inspired in the mind of
the most sceptical that purifying quality of
thought which must arise on witnessing the
prostration of the noble and the great. Every
reader of the Herald would then have ex-
claimed, “Fallen, but how great!” and not
“ Fallen, but how unutterably despicable !”
* * *
No, when the S. M. Herald wishes to pub-
lish to the world Parkes’ genuine diary let it
print —if it dare—the entry he made when
Wentworth lashed him from the hustings in
1848 ; of that morning in ’56 when all Sydney
rang with Homeric laughter at the instalment
of his autobiography which he published in that
day’s Empire ; of that evening when the hunger-
stricken wife of his employee, who had worked
for him without wage, was turned away from
his door penniless ; of the afternoon of that day
when Sir Alfred Stephen addressed to him
the one phrase which, of the thousands that
have fallen from the Judge’s lips, will survive
his death. Let the journal do this, and let it
quote—if it dare— Parkes’ own account of the
evolution of the Kiama Ghost, and of the in-
famous Treason Felony Act; let it publish his
reflections the night when Edward Butler
died, robbed, not of money this time, but of
that position of dignity and honor which was
the due reward of his labours ; and let it give to
the world that transcript of the broken-hearted
governess’s letter which was addressed to him on
the collapse of the Australian Mutual Prudential
Assurance Society. When it does this and
these, then we can believe that the Herald
is deriving from the only authentic source,
Parkes’ Diary. Till it does, we must accuse
it of being the instrument of an imposition, or
—we will not deny it the saving qualification—
the ridiculous tool of a shallow impostor. We
can only acquit the S.M.H. of originating a
fraud at the expense of arraigning its intelli-
gence. Perhaps, after all, the possibilities of
the one case are as likely as the other. The
great law of continuity in life demands that as
in life so in death shall the man be. Parkes in
political death could not help but be as he was
in political existence, a superlative fraud.
Both Houses of fS.A. Parliament have
passed a Cremation Bill. On the bill being
assented to by the Governor, Government will be
urged to build an Adelaide crematorium.
At Bathurst (N.S.W.) Railway-station,
newsboys are charged twopence each before being
permitted on the platform to try and sell their

newspapers to the travelling public, are admitted
to the platform free of charge.
Great Britain and France have about an
equal population, in round numbers, 39 millions.
Yet France boasts of 10 millions of voters under
manhood suffrage, while Great Britain has only
0 millions, British registration laws disfran-
chise quite 2 millions among the working-class
voters alone.
Austin Bid well, the Bank of England
forger, has now been in eraol 18 years, and has yet
to serve another 18 months of his “imprisonment
for life.” Thus, though sentenced for a mere
offence against property, he has seen go out into
the world free five murderers, sentenced to death
since the date of his conviction.
Of course the N.S.W. Executive is going
to hang (“as a deterrent ”) old Dalton, the grey-
haired wretch who murdered his wife with a
branding-iron in a fit of anger, or madness, or
drunkenness, or all three mixed. The bodies of the
men hanged in England for such offences during
the last few years would, if laid head to foot,
stretch round the Melbourne Cup course, and yet
hangman Berry’s knuckly fingers are always full
of human neck.
Four hundred and fifty Sydney tailors,
mostly members of the Journeymen Tailors’
Union, struck work on Monday. A number of
non-society tailors threw in their lot with the
strikers, and the union was augmented by 50 new
members on the first day. The immediate cause
of the strike has been the refusal of many of the
employers in what are known as “first-class
shops” to agree to anew “log ” —a revised scale
of trade charges—submitted by the unionists, who
had been suffering under many grievous evils,
chiefly due to “sweaters.” The case having
been laid before the Trades and Labour Coun-
cil, that body determined to call upon all
its affiliated unions to assist the tailors, should
a strike be forced upon them. Some of the
employers gave press representatives perfectly
gorgeous statistics of wages-rates paid to their
employees week after week, a responsible member
of one large firm stating that coat-hands earned
“ from <£2 10s. up to as much as .£5 ss. and even
more ” per week. The men explain that an occa-
sional wage-entry of £5 for a week’s payment
was quite possible, but that it meant a subsequent
“dead horse,” as in the following week the
employee would be completing work that
had actually been already paid for. Further,
such occasional big payments usually include tbe
wages of assistants, apprentices, or other home-
helps, by which amounts they have to be dis-
counted.' They state their average wages at <£llßs.
per week, and “in the busiest portion of the
year, when the men were working 10 hours a
day, £2 Bs. 4d. per week.” The increases asked
for amount chiefly to advances of only two and
three per cent; in one case, to 10 per cent. ; a,nd
in another, to 13 per cent. The Tailoresses’ Union
has decided to support the men on strike, and will
further draft a “log” for women in the trade.
Eleven “second-class” and two “first-class”
firms have agreed to the men’s new log, and work
has been resumed in those establishments. Other
“first-class’’establishments are showing signs of
giving way to the demands of the men, which
certainly appear reasonable. If the tailors and
tailoresses handle their forces judiciously, they
should be able to exterminate the pernicious
sweater in Sydney.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
pprpifPTAv . , “School.
xl™ RovaL-:::;-.:;;.';... “Robbery Under Arms.
Her Majesty's “ Fedora. _
Garrick ‘ Run Wild.
Viewed bye and large, “Robbery L ndor
Arms ” resembles chaos more than any other
operation of nature. It certainly has no resem-
blance to Bold re wood’s book, but has a strong
likeness to “ The Sundowner,” “ The Sunny
South,” and other plays by George Darrell,
indeed, since beholding Alfred Dampier play
“Starlight”—“Limelight” would be a more
appropriate designation —many folks imagine
that he must" be George’s long-lost brother.
Possibly, however, they purchase their wigs,
boots and breeches, grease-paint, &0., at the same
emporium. This play is pervaded by a number or
individuals selected apparently more in conse-
quence of their capacity to fill out tight-fitting leg-
coverings than their histrionic capabilities, and
several somewhat inaudible females. Neverthe-
less, the acting, all round, is quite up to the
necessities of the drama. Some of Tischbauer s
scenery, particularly the “Rocky Rises” and the
“ Hill over-looking’Racecourse,” is very good. A
big house gathered to greet the long-lost Dampier
on first night, and he was tumultuously received.
The season lasts for some weeks, and the gap
between it and the pantomime will probably be
filled in with the MacMahon’s _ Opera Co., who
open in Composer Rice’s “Corsair,” By the way,
the Dampier girls’ chief improvement has been in
the way of looks since they last saw Sydney,
though Lily sits a horse fairly well. Alfred
Dampier himself doesn’t put his fine voice to such
good use as of yore, and gets about rather slowly
for a hunted man. On first night the coach
sticking-up scene was poorly managed, and didn t
“ sensate ” worth a cent.

“Sithors to Grind” hasn’t had an edge
put on it in Sydney since Leitch’s Criterion
season of 1888. According to bill it is by “George
Ralph Walker,” but the two latter names in reality
spell Leitch. In this revival, the actor-author,
of course, plays his old part of Stammers, the
umbrella-mender and scissors-grinder, a character
which bubbles over with pathos, permeated by the
genial humour of the older school of play-writing.
Nellie Lyons is very well-suited as the heroine,
Eleanor Stammers; Frank Cates plays Lord Harry
Temple, and Dick Stewart is Ted Bluff, the
blacksmith. Other characters are ably handled,
and Mr. W. J. Wilson’s scenery is up to his usual
high standard. It is very unfortunate, not only
for George Leitch, but also the Sidney public, that
the influenza has precluded him from staging
“ The Light that Failed,” as Jennie Lee is due at
the Garrick on Saturday night with “ Run Wild,”
and the event will have to be postponed indefi-
nitely.

According to Frank Emery, the Gaiety
Co.’s Sydney send-off was the most enthusiastic in
his recollection. The first outburst came when
Ethel Blenheim fooled the gallery into thinking
her the original Nellie Farren. When they got
Ethel full-face the cheers changed into yells for
Nellie, who, unhappily, came not. Leslie’s
entrance was the signal for cheers, interpolated
with a chorus of “ He’s a jolly good fellow, ” which
lasted for some minutes and culminated in
demands for “ Killaloe.” Storey was also in
great demand. Danby was let off with
“ Bally hooley,” sung to a gallery chorus, and “So
English, you know.” Sylvia Grey and Florence
Levey were also overwhelmed with flowers, and
the show concluded after eleven with the singing
of “ Auld Lang Syne,” followed by a brief speech
from Leslie, in which he regretted the absence of
that “ kindly spirit ” now “ crying her eyes out at
home,” Nellie Farren.

“Society’s” most faithful feature is its
depiction of Bohemian life at the “Owls’ Roost.”
For instance, the noble journalist wants to borrow
five shillings for cab-hire. The man he “whispers”
says: “Haven’t got it, dear boy, but I’ll get it
for you.” The scribbler he sticks-up gives the
same reply, and the attempt to float a loan goes,
after this fashion, right round the table until it
gets within one of coming back to Lyndal—there
its peregrination is stayed by the pecuniosity of a
bearded boozer, awaiting change for a sovereign.
The assurance : “ That’ll be all right in a minute,
laddie,” is then sent round from mouth to ear, and
the needed coin makes the same circuit from hand
to hand five minutes later. The management
announce the re-appearance of George Titheradge,
now recovered from the influenza, on Saturday
next. Mr. Shine has already returned to cast a
ray of light on the proceedings.

Business has improved slightly with “The
Dancing Girl,” at Sydney Her Majesty s, audit
is just possible that, handled by people of genius,
the terpsichorist and the insufferably good, though
allegedly wicked, “ Dook,” would have proved
fairly acceptable to Sydney audiences. As it is,
the bull-dog, the breakwater, the allegories, the
godly father, and the impressionable, though
puritanical youth, are received nightly with loud
outbursts of silence from the house. “ Fedora”
goes up on Friday for Miss Villiers’ benefit.

We learn from Bondi that some weird,
underground mystery, known as “The Caves,”
has been laid on, but whether Wyburd has
tunnelled through to the Mammoth cave of Ken-
tucky, or has simply discovered a subterrannean
passage to Jenolan, we are not yet in a position
to state.

“The Jonquille,” a drama written by the
young South Australian, Guy Boothby, was
placed on the boards of the Adelaide Royal for
three nights as a benefit season to the author, who
proceeds to England. The play is founded upon
incidents in connection with the French Revolu-
tion, and undoubtedly possesses merit enough to
give it a fair show in London, if young Boothby has
the luck to get one of the metropolitan managers
to put it up. Miss Maud Williamson played the
title-role on its recent production and gave a most
artistic rendering. The remaining characters
were in the hands of local amateurs. It is little
credit to Boothby’s friends that they failed to
accord him more support in the matter of attend-
ance. Gerald and Duff have opened in “Human
Nature.” Also another amateur performance of a
local work has been given in the Albert Hall by
the members of the Harmonic Society, the cause
of the trouble being a comic operetta called “The
Windmill,” by M. Henzenroder, an Adelaide
musician. It is a tuneful little thing, and the man
with the long name deserves congratulation.
*» * *
“Faust,” at Melbourne Alexandra, is the
best-paying thing yet staged by the Simonsens.
The big barn has been crowded since Friday last,
and as the double cast makes consecutive per-
formances easy it is certain that the opera could
run for another fortnight. It is difficult to say
which of thetwopriraas,Guidottior Cuttica, makes
the better Margherita, although the odds are well
in favour of Cuttica. Their interpretations are
both clever, though widely divergent, and the
audiences like one as well as t’other. Cuttica
Signor is far and away a better Faust than little
Vilalta, who can’t act the text well enough to keep
himself awake. The badly presenced Sisco was
the first Valentine, and scored bigger things in
the death-scene than did Melossi, the more
pleasing-looking soldier of the second night,
lorio andTraviaglini were the Mephistopheles, and
here the last-named proved himself the superior.
Signorinas Mattioli and Castiglioni were respec-
tively the Siebel and Marta of every evening,
and do them well. The picturesque ending of
the opera has, unfortunately, been cut out. Old
Nick and Faust throw Margherita on to a heap
of straw and walk off, and an Uncle Tom’s Cabin-
like apotheosis ends the show. The satire of
Mephistofele singing his music in a cathedral to
the accompaniment of a church-organ does not
strike the audiences much. “ Faust,” with a few
one-night shows thrown in, will probably hold on
to the end of the season, which now draweth ex-
tremely nigh. Guidotti benefits to-night(Thursday)
with the last performance of “ Ernani.”

Last Friday, the Cockney Burlesque Co.
lent their faces to J. C. Williamson, and a
very long bill, beginning with “Kerry, ’’ ended
with a speech by James Cassius himself.
Some costermonger songs were sung by
Leslie, and the other Gaieties filled in. The
house was very full on Saturday, th® first
night of the revival of the “Old Guard.” The
ballet is as good as ever, and an evidently new
girl in dove-coloured pants knocks the bald-heads
every time. Elton is still the circus Mayor, and
the well beloved Howard Vernon shines as the
Marquise. Ida Osborne and Florence Young
hold up their old loads. The show is well known
everywhere just now, and there is nothing new to
say of it except that Gilbert and Sullivan would
be much more welcome than this hotch-potch of
fooling and legs and skirt-dances. G. and S. are
the only builders of comic opera extant who never
depended on the legs of strange girls for the sup-
port of their work.

Walter Bentley, the Scotch tragedian,
opens with a gorgeous version of “ Rob Roy,” at
the Royal, on 14th instant, and until then Rignold
will continue to fall into a tank and breathe hard

“ A Night Off” has replaced “New Men
and Old Acres” at the Bijou. Mr Brough, as
Professor Babbitt, is sensibly funny, and Anson,
Sass, Ward, Corlesse fill up the men parts of a
remarkably strong cast. Mrs. Brough and Miss
Temple, as two of the nice gals of the professor’s
househould, took well, and gave pleasure to all,
and were also encored, whatever that may mean.
Annie Taylor, as the other member of the house-
hold, is funny enough for a religious paper. Miss
Bronton makes a good Mrs. Babbitt, and the
scenery is very fine.
#* * *
Other shows by the dozen have been run
together for Cup week. The Gaiety and Victoria
do good business, likewise the Exhibition Concert
and a variety show at Olympia, the scene
of the recent beauty-show, is propounding nigger
conundrums to fair houses. Wirth’s Circus is
still located at Swanston-street, and the “Cor-
sair,” at the Opera House, is keeping on its feet
without much trouble. The Faust Family are at
the Waxworks, and Phil. Stuart is extending the
accommodation of his cash-box.
«* * *
Snazelle opened at the Athenaeum on
Saturday for a season extending over race-week.
“Enoch Arden” is finely reproduced, and the
boss one-man-host-in-himself enacts “Faust” in
71 minutes. Miss Snazelle and Messrs. Langdale
and Hawkins fill up a good bill.

The new Cyclorama of the Siege of Paris
was opened last Friday afternoon. The building
is much larger than Waterloo, and being situated
in Bourke-street, just above the Bijou, is likely to
injure the receipts of the theatres. The Siege of
Paris is a much finer landscape painting than
Waterloo, but the figures are not so excellent all
round. Manager Forster lectures at the new show
as well as at the old one.
At Poverty Point.
The marmalade modestly ladled out by Fred. Leslie to
the absent Nellie Farren, on the occasion of the Gaiety
Co.’s last appearance in Sydney, was natural enough.
It is stated, on most unreliable authority, that Leslie’s
affection for Nellie is purely filial—that in point of fact
she is his mother. It is also averred that Frederick is
Nellie’s youngest son. '
Williamson’s Ilip Van Winkle is, in the opinion of many
people, a livelier and more effective performance than
Jefferson’s. In truth, Jeff, became very tedious in his
famous character after playing it a few thousand
thousand times, and elaborated his conception until it
was uncommonly like an artistic nuisance.

What The Bulletin said about Christie Murray’s acting
is echoed in the London Referee, which recently
remarked: “Mr. Murray in his own person shows how
unfair it is to rank acting with those professions for
which men have to qualify themselves by long and

and after his brief experience in Australia he has come to
England an uncommonly good actor, within limitations,
of a character part.”

Majeroni was a good sort and open to conviction. On

When the anti-Wagner hysterics were rampant recently

your name and address—which are essential in such a

And she waddled like a pup” would kill any set of
verses. .. “ Legal ” : When you write about a question of
no interest to anybody, it is just as well to make the
aiticle under four columns.... “ Once Again ”: We have
no remark to offer upon the figures except that they
prove that the Irishman in Victoria, as in other places,
succumbs easily to the temptations of the city. “ A.L.”:
It would clearly be libellous to say that because a jury
returned a farthing verdict that plaintiff’s character was
only worth a farthing. What the jury’s verdict legally
implied was that only’ a farthing's worth of damage had
been done.... “ W.M.A.” (Ad.): Thanks, but the story is
spoilt by the alleged Hebrew incident. We aren’t ready
to believe that there is in Australia any Jew’ who would
only give a hungry lad a meal on condition that the boy
parted with some of his clothing. Jews are quite

which rate the loan was practically floated. .. “ A.E.K.” :
It is certain that some men can resist offers of knight-
hood, but there is strong reason for believing that no
Australee woman ever yet declined an opportunity to

average knight is a political prostitute. Women, unedu-
cated in politics, can’t be expected to have any political
morality —“ The Sluggard ”: Empty of incident. Flirt-

ment, owing to his horror at a recent outrage, only goes
to prove that the most garrulous and aggressive of

tion instead of by philosophical principle. (2) Yes, if we had
a child so brutally treated we might, as you say, like to
kill the wretch who did the deed. But then, you see,
civilised laws are made for the express purpose of pre-
venting people from wreaking personal vengeance
“ B.H.B.”(Wagga): Received “Carmen”: Too late,
anyhow. But enthusing over turf insanity is just as dis-
tasteful as are moral sermons against gambling. Because
Wales carries baccarat counters, gambling is not respect-

no poetry in “life in a tent”—for you ...“Tobul”: A
good incident for stirring verse, but weakly told ; inap-
propriate in its present form... “A. Ohee”: “The B.”
good “Luff Topsail”: Your screed will require new
timber from truck to keelson ; but probably you have got
the deep-sea facts plumb “Mount Hutton”: Body-
snatching was always detestable, but when you resurrect

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Melbourne Cup was only half a surprise
this year, though few of the venerated turf-tipsters
(with the exception of “Nemo,” who bull's-eyed the
winner) placed the son of Malua anywhere nearer the
winning-post than to label him “ dangerous.” However,
the numbers went up thus:—
Malvolio .. „ 1
Sir William .. ~ 2
Strathmore .. 3
Malvolio went backwards in the betting at latest dates,
though his first turf performance was the beating of
Highborn, who afterwards ran second to Carbine in last
year’s Cup. Malvolio, later still, won the Haw'ksburn
Handicap in brilliant fashion, and his preparation for
his present victory was in the capable hands of the
Caulfield trainer, J. Redfearn. His sire, Malua, won
the Melbourne Cup as a 5-year-old with fist. 91b. ; Malvolio
is 4 years, and carried Bst. 41b. His dam was Madcap.
S.r William, 5 years, by Sir Modred—Vesper, carried
Bst. 71b., and a heap of Sydney money. The stable-E.
Keys’s—had consistently backed him all along, and
“ Asmodeus,” of The Leader, considered him the best
handicapped horse of the whole of the 163 original candi-
dates, and tipped him amongst a quartet of winners.
Strathmore, the Derby winner, by Nordenfeldt-Ouida,
was the likeliest among the 3-year-olds, and a lot of Cup
money was put up on him late in the day.

The Argus prints a letter, complaining that the
V.R.C. distributes complimentary tickets ad libitum,
and that all the front seats in Flemington Grand Stand
are filled with dead-heads to the detriment of the paying
public. The accusation is obviously absurd. Dead-
heads at Flemington are mainly pressmen, a class of in-
dividuals who certainly don’t go dow n to the course for
the purpose of vegetating on benches from 12 to 5 o’clock.
Ladies, moreover, enjoy almost a monopoly of the
Stand on Cup and other big days, and although it may
be that the bearers of ladies’ tickets or ladies passed in by
members (each of whom can escort two bonnets through
the turnstiles) do take up a considerable portion of Stand
accommodation, these are not dead heads in the strict
acceptation of the term. They simply represent the
womankind interest in membership of that Club, and are
there by right. As for the insinuation that complimentary
tickets are too cheap at the V.R.C; office, no one
acquainted with the smart business policy of Byron
Moore and the tough personality of Miles, who is the
actual distributor of press passes, will give ear to such a
howl. Surely, too, the phenomenal success of the V.R.C.
is a guarantee that the right of entrie isn’t chucked about
promiscuously, just as the prosperity of any other sort of
show is conclusive evidence of the free-list department
being wisely administered. No place of entertainment in
Australia gets so much newspaper puffing at so compara-
tively little cost, in paid advertisement and press tickets,
as Flemington, and no racecourse in the world is
patronised by such an immense proportion of people who
never read sporting papers. The V.R.C. management
have grasped the fact that a brief notice in a trade jour-
nal which meets the eyes of many non-horsey people
is better worth acknowledging with a free ticket than
are ten columns of stuff in a racing paper whose
readers are already interested and nosted-up in turf
matters. It is clear enough to the initiated that this
Arous letter was inspired by, or anyway written in the
interests of, a rival racing-club, the management whereof
has acquired a reputation for being stupid as regards the
distribution of passes, and would like to induce the
V.R.C. to chop away a number of its press supports.

The rain came down like a wolf on the fold and
took all the starch out of Derby Day at Flemington. A
few girls in muslins degenerated into bundles of wet rags
long before closing time, whilst one pallid young female,
probably a bride, who insisted upon prowhng round the
paddock in a complete snow-tinted costume, finished
off by white kid boots, and stockings of the same hue,
looked like a mud-stained ghost. The weather was
beastly.
# # «
Unfortunately, the tempest did its worst during
the half-hour when horses were being saddled for the
Melbourne Stakes. Very few' people ventured into the
paddock to take stock of the starters and see how the
market champions for the Cup were popping up. It was
sufficient to stand afterwards under an umbrella and
cheer Marvel on his damp and dismal way. As neither
of the first two horses was to be a runner for the Cup, the
excitement following the Stakes was mild as compared
with previous years. Several of the competitors seemed
to be knocked out of the coming handicap by their poor
performances, and two or three of the others stood as
they were on the assumption that they had merely
been brought out for a wetting. Then Pigeontoe
got home easily through the dirt for the Hotham
Handicap, and was promptly pounced upon as a
certainty for the Cup. By this time, Pigeontoe may be
the hero of that event—on the other hand, he may not.
In any case, the big horse doesn’t look like a first-class
animal, but like a useful horse trained to the minute, and
calculated to show' to advantage over soft ground. Judg-
ing from appearances before the race, the Derby was a
match between Stromboli and Strathmore, the former
showing more breed and style than the latter, but behav.
mg like an ill-tempered cur in the paddock. The result
proved that Strathmore’s win at Caulfield was accom.
phshed on his merits, for the Nordenfeldt colt got
home without being once threatened with the whip.
Then a filly with a heathen-sounding name won the
Maribyrnong Plate. She didn’t look like a youngster
who will train into a real good one, nor were any of
the others especially striking to the eye. Probably they
are all moderate, like last year’s starters for the same
race. By the time the Coburg Stakes came off, most of
the company—and the attendance must have been far
below the average—were hurrying home to dry them-
selves. Yet punters wore pleasant faces, despite the
damp. Four warm favourites had rollicked home in
succession.

Mr. “Reggie ” Allen evidently believes in trying
to make his horses earn their oats. His three-year-old
Juan has been doing a deal of racing lately, and at
Warwick Farm on Saturdaj', after Juan had - won the
Farm Stakes, he was started in the next race with a 71b.
penalty, when he ran third.

Melbourne Sportsman published about six con-
flicting tips for the Cup in its two issues of last week, and
then had the impudence to inform confiding readers that
it would burst forth with another budget of “ final selec-
tions ”on the Monday before the race. For the reductio
ad absurdum of racing prophecy one must go to the
professional sporting paper, which sets up a succession of
dummy idols for bookmakers to get a bit out of, and
howls like a suffering dog if it can stumble across the
winner in the course of four-and-twenty tries.

The Melbourne Cup run for on Tuesday last
was the 31st—the race having been established in 1861.
In 1885, 35 horses started, the smallest number being in
1863 (Banker’s year), when only 7 faced the flag.

Mr. George Hill had a deal of luck in picking
up that truly-named horse Marvel. Originally owned by
a syndicate, who might have made a fortune by running
the Marvel “ straight,” they, or some of them, overdid
the clever business, and the horse was disqualified when
Mr. Hill purchased him for a song. Mr. Hill’s influence
soon caused the removal of the disqualification.

Britishers will doubly regret the expatriation of
Musket now that it has been proved that, in addition to
his powers as a getter of racing phenomena, the flyers in
turn are sireing racehorses of the first water. On‘Satur-
day, Nordenfeldt (for whom Sam. Hordern has refused
£20,000) was responsible for two winners-Strathmore in
the Derby, and Steadfast in the Maiden Plate.

The much-boomed George Dawson’s science
stood no show with the rushing but clever Williams’
onslaughts in Melbourne on Derby night. Williams
started business so soon as the scratch was toed, ar.d
dodgfe and duck as he might Dawson was unable to
escape. Williams smashed him about until the fourth
round, when Dawson was knocked insensible. Dawson
is so well-conducted a lad that many will be sorry for his
bad luck ; but he has been ridiculously extolled as a
fighter, despite the fact that he has on more than one
occasion narrowly escaped defeat, notably at the hands of
Dummy Mace. Williams now goes to America and Eng-
land to assert his claim to the world’s light-weight cham-
pionship.

A Sydneyite some time since imported some
game-fowl from England, and after repeated pesterings
from a man who demanded a clutch of eggs, he handed
them over, having first taken the precaution of giving
them what he considered a real good parboiling. Eater
on he met the importunate party and asked how things
were, and was informed that 11 eggs had hatched out of
the 18. He treated the information rather as a joke until
some 12 months afterwards, when the cadger “ beat him
bad ” at a show.
Derby Day.
Everybody, writes “ Sappho Smith,” from Mel-
bourne, must have echoed Lady Jersey’s chirrup, as she
entered the V.R. enclosure at Flemington, on Derby Day,
What a quantity not number—“of people I” for
though “ the day was cold and dark and dreary ” the big
racecourse was mobbed as usual, and late comers had to
stand up and gaze forlornly at the crowded stands.
But, despite the weather, there were several cynosures in
the rag-line abroad, though my flesh did sometimes creep
at the sight of beauty got up in cambric with a stiff
nor’-easter blowing, Bill.” Beginning at the top of the
social column, I noticed first the unpopular Lady
Hopetoun—pale and bored (did she hear, I wonder, the
unfavourable stage asides whispered about her all round?:
and clothed in a black lace and silk skirt with visite o!
black lace, with gold embroidered yoke and high lace
collar, bonnet in black lace and jet, with ostrich
aigrette and crown of crushed pink roses, suede
gloves, and a single white gardenia at her throat
INext to her sat Lady Willoughby, Gov. Hope-
toun s itinerant middle - aged cousin, who wore a
gown of heliotrope cotele trimmed with tinsel brocade
in gold, mauve and silver, the blouse front of cream lace ;
mantle in black woollen with trimming of gold braid and
coronet bonnet in black lace; ostrich tips and gold
gimp; Lady Jersey- who seemed to enjoy herself
very much—wore blotting-paper pink crGpe cloth
with basque and cascade front of cream lace
and trimmings of floral applique in greenish grey
and silver, flat bonnet composed of pearls and gold
spangles and trimmed at either pole with red currants
electric-blue Mother Hubbard wrap over all; Lady Kintore
encored the get-up she wore at Randwick Spring Meeting
a grey crepe cloth with grey pansies worked hero
and there, and trimmed with hands of pansies in
natural colours, sash at the back of green and pansy
ribbon, smocked vest of pansy surah, bonnet in gold
straw trimmed with pansies and a little brown bird in
front, a cluster of pansies on top of her grey gamp, which
had an ivory cockatoo clawing up the handle. The other
lady in the V.R. box wore mauve with a darker dot
relieved with yellow silk, hride-like bonnet in white
acacia. There was much enthusiasm and congratulatory
hand-shaking among the gubernatorial party when Strath-
more annexed the Derby and was led up to the V.R.-hox
for Lady Hopetoun to lie his blue necktie on. But the
perverse “colleen” declined the honour, and Gov. H.—
who looked really fagged out with having to do the offi-
cially smiling-agreeahle for two —elbowed his way through
the mob and fastened the ribbon on Mr. Wilson’s pretty
brown horse.
* # #
As the rain had soaked the lawn, and thin-soled
promenaders were restricted to the strip of stone pave-
way in front of the g.s., relieved, here and there, with
puddles of water, a lot of women stopped cramped up in
their seats, and judging toilettes was like trying to pick
out the prettiest peach-blossom on a crowded bough. No
colour predominated, verifying the suspicion that no hue
leads this spring, and the only novelty was a saucer-shaped
hat, with a little round flat brim, trimmed with a roll of
silk and a Mercury wing, which, though unbecoming to
most faces, yet found many followers. Miss Manning
(Sydney) wore a shrimp-pink crepe cloth, with shaggy
knobs of pink, trimmed witli ruby velvet; black lace hat,
trimmed with pink roses and black wings. Miss Hogg, in
cornflower-blue silk diagonally barred with black, blouse
front of blue crepe and a sort of Fiji apron in black bugles,
hat covered with blue feather, and gamp exactly match- •
ing, looked altogether good form ; Miss Roberts (Sydney ',
in lavender-grey lit up with yellow silk, had a Tudor cape
of fawn with green velvet yoke, black hat swarming with
yellow roses, yellow silk frilled gamp ; Miss Brush (Mel-
bourne) wore an artistic get-up of fawn lined over with
narrow, glittering lines, fulled sleeves, and front of sage
green crepe embroidered in tiny white flowers, trimmed
with bows of narrow sage-green velvet, hat of black
crinoline straw trimmed with green bows and black
feathers, parasol of the same material as the frock.
Miss Cox wore pale-grey with front of silk, white
hat trimmed with yellow ’santheraums ; Sylvia Grey wore
white and a mauve dot trimmed with panels and et
ceteras of mauve silk, hat covered with white feathers—
but one might as well attempt to diagram the sands on
the seashore as the myriads of women at Flemington ;
and I want to have a little gossip about the Derby man.’
There isn’t much variety about any Johnny, barring his
button-holer. This year cornflowers were the raging
vegetable, and all the jeunesse doree exemplified a blue
look-out in their coat-collars. One trio of blonde men
with blue eyes, blue ties, and blue nosegays a span across
were delightfully en suite. The men, especially the top-
hatted section, suffered more from the showers than the
women.
A Croydon (N. Q.) advice states that the
deep ground on that field is turning out well, but
that the labour-market there is over-supplied.
Sam Hordern has refused £20,000 for
Nordenfeldt. That sum would have been <£16,000
on his bargain of a few months ago—interest at
the rate of about 1200 per cent, per annum.
Two recent incidents contemporaneously
recorded in the English press:— ,- A successful
furniture-manufacturer, one Blundell Maple, gave
15,000 guineas for a three-year-old racehorse, and
6000 guineas for an unbroken colt.” ‘‘The baby
of a London fish-eurer’s assistant died of starva-
tion because it could get no nutriment out of its
famishing mother’s body.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ The hidden national will, concealed in
its abysses, yet ever alert.” — Whitman.
Now that Parkes has lost the political
situation it doesn’t interest him any more.
In England there is a Judge to every
800,000 people; in Victoria, one to every 2oo,ooo.
Barton : “I shall have sitting right
opposite to me in the House the most implacable
enemy of Federation, George Reid.”
O Shan assy : “ When Australian Federa-
tion comes on the board, Imperial Federation will
be drawn, as a herring, across the trail.”
Mr. Black, M.P., says that Dibbs will be
a more honest leader than Parkes. This is what
we call damning a man with faint praise.
Salomons has never sat in the N.S W*
Assembly. He opposed Sir Henry Parkes once
in East Sydney, and got a great drubbing.
D. Melville is the only member of the
Victorian Legislative Council who is openly in
favour of the One-man-one-vote principle.
It is a fair sample of Parkes’ innate
cussedness, that he resigned just in time to pre-
vent Dibbs and Barton seeing the Melbourne
Cnp.
Two members of the Dibbs Administration
are directors of the Sydney Star. G. R. Dibbs
wrote for the Sydney News in 1885 ; but now the
News writes down Dibbs.
J. P. Howe (Bourke) is perhaps the first
member of the N.S.W. Assembly who has been
rounded of a felonry. His seat will, no doubt, be
filled by a Labour representative.
The area of S. Australia is 243,244,800
acres.. 8,532,823 acres are held by freeholders.
Land not cultivated but enclosed 58,715,971 acres!
Land under cultivation, 2,649,098 acres.
During the reign of Queen Victoria the
hours of labour have been reduced by about 8 per
cent. That seems a lot until you consider that
the efficiency of labour has been increased about
25 per cent.
It is this time almost safe to predict that
Parkes is dead as a political leader. Everything
points to a N.S.W. coalition sooner or later, and
one of the chief objects of any coalition would be
to get rid of Parkes.
In one of the Australian Parliaments the
question is : When will lie resign ? He constantly
interrupts proceedings with hiccupy speeches and
the other day wrecked a valuable Bill by voting
against it while drunk.
At the general election the Sydney papers
entered into a conspiracy not to report the
addresses of Labour-candidates. The speeches of
Labour members are now reported very carefully,
and with crood judgment.
The Playford (S.A.) Government have
cirried a measure providing for State land-pur-
chase on a large scale. The measure is welcomed
by the landocracy, who are falling over each other
in the attempt to sell out.
St. James’ Gazette says Parkes’ dismissal
from office removes “ the only guarantee of safety
to British investors.” “Safety to British in-
vestors ” stands, in Imperial parlance, for
“ Federation under the Crown.”
The Tasmanian Parliament has just been
running a big syndicate session, everybody ac-
commodating everybody right and left. What a
blessing that all its members are known to be
impervious to palm-oil—and tips !
London Times expresses the opinion that
Sir Henry Parkes was “a dangerous financier,”
The Times should just read the list of moneys
borrowed by the old man from politicians whom
he subsequently appointed to the N.S.W. Legisla-
tive Council.
In South Australia, Tasmania, and N. S.
Wales the Commonwealth Bill is shelved for the
current session ; in Queensland it will probably
be shelved ; whilst in Victoria the Council has
disagreed with the Assembly’s amendment in
favour of One-man-one-vote being embodied in
the constitution.
C. C. Kingston, M. P,, one of the drafts-
men of the Commonwealth Bill, has changed his
opinions as to Australian Federation, and now
considers the present time inopportune for Aus-
tralian union. There is strong reason for believing
that nearly all the S.A. delegates now hold simi-
lar opinions.
The Tasmanian Assembly, although it has
recently enacted payment of members and trien-
nial Parliaments, lias thrown out a bill providing
for One-man-one-vote. In the Tasmanian Payment
of Members Act, strange to say, the first pay-day is
not fixed, and members are dnnning the Treasurer
for their maiden “pony.” The screw is £lOO a
year.
The Salvation Army has a good idea of the
power of sex. The lasses never attempt to trade
off War Crys with women, and the “soldier”
does all his canvassing with the nnregeneratecl
female, and never with the man. For this reason
it is a very rare thing to see a soldier in a pub.—
unless, of course, he gets his tipple at the jug-and-
bottle entrance.
No sane Government would take up
Parkes’ Electoral Reform bills except with the view
of appealing to the country on the question of
abolishing the Upper House. Dibbs should move
for the discharge of these hotch-potch measures
from the paper, and then bring down a short One-
man-one-vote Bill and defy the Council to touch
one word or one comma of it.
“In the morning,” once said Benjamin
Franklin, dealing with the property-qualification
question, “John Smith owned a donkey, and had
a vote. In the afternoon the donkey’s death
made John Smith voteless. It was, therefore, the
donkey which had the vote, and not John Smith:”
This is an ancient jibe, but it is still good enough
to heave at J. B. Patterson.
Griffith feels exceedingly savage at the pro-
spect of being driven out of office by a democratic
party under the leadership of Lilley. It is whis-
pered in the Queensland clubs that the Griffith-
MTlwraith party ventured to rebuke Sir Charles
Lilley for expounding democratic ideas at the
opening of the Brisbane Trades Hall, and since
then there has been trouble in the camp.
The Emperor of Germany ukased that, in
future, no man is to be so degraded as to live on
the earnings of any fallen woman. William is
apparently a good and honourable prig, but he
makes a mistake in thus tackling iniquity piece-
meal, as it were. It would be much more to the
point to issue a rescript to this effect : “It is
hereby ordered that original sin shall be abolished
within seven days.”
Chili has replied insolently to the U.S.
demand that the Chilians who killed American
men-o’-warsmen in the streets of Santiago shall
be punished, remarking that the Government docs
not accept responsibiliiy for the acts of private
citizens. Blaine, it is announced, prepares for
war. A curious satire this on the recent Yankee
reply to Italy when Italian citizens were lynched

CANDIDATE: “Allow me to solicit your support, Madame. "
MADAME: “I must decline. I’ve had to support my husband for the last ton years.”
at New Orleans by American private and other
citizens.
Sydney D.T. has published two leaders a
day on the Dibbs’ Ministry. The directors are, it
is understood, almost evenly divided on the fiscal
question ; and Protectionist Treasurer See is a
large shareholder in the paper. The Bulletin
ventures to think that if the D.T. were to devote
one leader a day to the political situation and the
other leader to the “encouragement of private
enterprise,” it would give complete satisfaction in
certain quarters in N.S.W.
How much leisure do the N.S.W. Labour
representatives spend in writing long letters to
the press? Nearly every Sydney paper publishes
a letter from a supersensitive democrat, who
cannot carry a few ounces of political mud with-
out acquainting the public with the fact. The
Bulletin rises to suggest that the Labour members
devote their leisure to the study of political tactics.
All this letter-writing is suicidal, and delivers
over the party into the hands of its enemies.
Thus frozen - bloodedly Agent-General
Samuel championing the Parkes-M'Millan deficit
in the Loudon press ;
Not a shilling of (N.S.W.) public money has been mis’
applied.
N.S. Wales may- be proud of its Agent-General.
A man who can coolly undertake the stupendous
task of defending all Parkes’ public expenditure
is far and away- better in that billet than a large,
fanciful, and ornate liar.
The British Colonial Office’s recommenda-
tion that the Admiralty should choose as far as
practicable unmarried officers only for service on
the Australian station throws a little light on the
artifices by which it is proposed to draw tighter
the “silken bonds” which link us to the Im-
perialism of a distant country. “Marry Austra-
lian women to naval officers,” says the Colonial
Office, “and the Australian families thus allied
will look to and consider England instead of their
native land.” Australia must haveher own navy-
The Auxiliary squadron is.a mere instrument of
political proselytism.
The New South Wales Government will
find itself in a tight place over the second volume
of “ The History of New South Wales from the
Records.” In the first place, the limit of time for
delivery of the second volume has long been ex-
ceeded, and then, again, the subscribers ordered
an original work, based on the records, by “G. B.
Barton,” they did not agree to accept a volume
which is made up of bald, dry official papers. And.
besides, the faculty of historical research cannot
be originated by the bidding of a Parkes.
As The Bulletin lately showed, the
N.S.W. “National” Association consists solely
of non-producers—of commission-agents, lawyers,
landrsharks, and fat capitalists—to the utter ex-
clusion of wage-earners. Recognising the absur-
dity of its position, the Association —why doesn’t
it call itself the “National Gang”? —now
seeks to symmetricise its story by lowering
the subscription from 2s. (id. to Is. and placing
some producers and hand-workers on its Council.
Too late, dear friends, too late. The cat is out of
the bag.
Parkes’ chance of getting a pension from
the present Parliament of N.S.W. is a very small
one.- Anticipating a defeat on the Commonwealth
Bill he courted a crisis, and handed over the
government to the Opposition. Since his defeat
he has never missed an opportunity of slating the
Labour members, and sowing the seeds of clis-
sensioi in the Assembly. lie conspires to bring
about a dissolution of the Parliament —that he
may do—and a dissolution of the Labour party —
which he will never do-with the sole object of
creating a plastic Parliament that will “do the
right thing by him.”
In Victoria, coffee, sago, cocoa, chocolate,
and salt are all admitted free of import duty, and
tea is taxed Id. per lb. ; inN.S.W., the imposts
run—coffee and cocoa, Gd. per lb. each ; sago, Id.
per lb. ; chocolate, 4d. per lb.; salt, 20s. per ton ;
tea, 3d. per lb. In N.S.W., carriages, jewellery,
silks, carpets, silverplate, and pianos all come in
free —because the poor man uses these things
never ; in Victoria, they are taxed—carriages,
£SO each ; jewellery and silks, 20 per cent, each ;
carpets, 25 per cent. ; silverplate, 2s. per oz.;
pianos, from £5 to £ls each. This has all been
pointed out several times before, but it will bear
rehearsing.
The contemptuous references in Parkes’
political diary—he keeps a personal diary as well
—to the “inconsistent votes” and “rapacious
demands” of the Democrats in the N.S.W.
Assembly, contrast very strangely with his views
of the people at the time he was nicknamed “the
arch-Anarchist ” by Wentworth : “ I would no
more truckle to the working classes than to the
highest; and at the same time I believe that
among the lowest class there is often to be found
the largest amount of virtue, the largest share of
those energies which are most valuable to a young
country, and on which every institution of the
country must depend.”
The Maoriland Parliament, according to
the veteran Alfred Saunders, M.H.R. who has
just completed his half-century of political life,
consists of—
ten lawyers, ten merchants, storekeepers or auctioneers,
ten large landowners or agents of land companies, run-
holders or land speculators, ten farmers, six journalists,
four Maoris, two brewers, two mine agents, one doctor,
one captain, one major, one pensioner, one shipping
agent, one contractor, one builder, one painter and
glazier, two working shoemakers, one working tailor, one
stonemason, one brass-fitter, one carpenter, one lamp-
lighter and four or five nondescripts. Thus three thou-
sand professional men are getting more representation in
the present House than 40,000 farmers. With all the talk
about Labour representatives there is not one farm-
labourer in the House, and only seven working mechanics
to represent 80 000 wage-earners. Ten lawyers have
ridden into Parliament on the backs of the working-men.
The Sydney papers have indulged in a
prolonged scream over the political union of Toby
Barton and G. R. Dibbs. Public virtue is the
burden of their cry, and yet these papers have
licked Parkes’ political boots for many years!
Toby Barton is politically unclean, not because ho
and Dibbs sat on opposite sides last month, but
because protection is imminent, and the inflow of
ads. is threatened. Toby Barton is sober now on
the question of the Commonwealth Bill ; it will
never see the light, but will be overshadowed by
important measures. Toby has cooled down on
the federation-under-the-Crowu business, but the
papers will not credit him witii a return to poli
tical sobriety.
The statue of Australia’s first chief gaoler
and hangman, Governor Arthur Phillip, for the
erection of which N.S.W. Parliament asiniuely
voted, under Parkesian pressure, £3OOO, will cost
at least £11,500, one of the last official acts of
-Parkes being the approval of additional expendi-
ture which will bring the cost to date to that
enormous sum. The Bulletin computes that,
since 1887, Parkes’ crude, not to say vicious,
dilletanteism has bled his country to the extent of
£123,000 — what with literary jobs, subsidies to
alleged art, and the attempts, cancerous (as are all
Parkes’ efforts in every direction and in every
department of public life) with his egotism, to
apotheosise such spawn of British officialdom as
has at one time or other polluted the Australias
by its presence.
Sir Henry Parkes has been silly enough
to publish some more leaves from his “political
diary.” Four or five years ago he was cajoled by
a smart reporter into doing the same foolisi
thing; and once more his vanity has been
ministered .to by a crafty pressman. For many
years Sir Henry has kept a diary of important
occurrences in his public life. Sir John Robert-
son was not aware that Sir Henry aped the
“eminent man” to that extent until a paper
printed an entry from the “ political diary.” Sir
John’s opinion of Sir Henry as a truthful chroni-
cler was not very high : “ Although some part of
the entry,” said the bluff Sir John, “agrees with
my memory of what took place between us, some
part of what is recorded never took place at all,
and the greater part of what did take place is not
mentioned in the diary. Thank God ! I can take
my own part without a diary, without any
duplicity, and without any double-dealing.”
Premier Munro’s four cabinet colleagues
in the Victorian Legislative Council are all
opposed to his One-man-one-vote policy, and
Munro is consequently confronted with an
insoluble portfolio problem. The Council, being
a sort of bastard elective body, claims full repre-
sentative privileges, and is practically indepen-
dent of the wrath of Governments, as the process
of changing the personnel of the chamber requires
six years for full completion, one-third of the
House retiring every two years. The obstinate
conservatism of the Victorian Legislative Council,
and its determined opposition to popular pro-
noucements, are causing democratic leaders to
ponder more find more over the respective merits
and demerits of bicameral v. unicameral constitu-
tions. Evils which the democracy cannot sweep
away must be tunnelled through and dynamited.
Thousands of lives are sacrificed annually
because mankind are not educated in the first
rudiments of hygiene and life-preservation. Simple
ailments are neglected. The debility increases,
and some fatal disease attacks the victim, and all
life’s pleasure departs, existence becomes a bmden,
. life a trouble, and all because mankind is so
apathetic and regardless of the signs nature sends
that the vital strength is declining. All cases
require immediate attention before it is too late,
and a course of Clements Tonic invariably has the
effect of immediately restoring perfect health.
Miss Eva Brown, daughter of Sergeant Brown,
Albury, N.S.W., writes on June 15, 1891“ The
following particulars of my case are furnished on
behalf of the afflicted, trusting they may be the
means of restoring others to health : For eighteen
months I was extremely debilitated, the doctors
being of opinion that I had outgrown my strength.
My disease is known in medical circles as anaemia
or poverty of blood. Pains invaded all parts of
ray body ; I suffered from general languor, extreme
weakness, listlessness, dejection of spirits, indigis-
tion, fickle appetite and disturbed sleep. My
'body presented a bloodless appearance; my lips
were pale and the skin like wax. I was under
several doctors who prescribed for me ; but their
treatment did not alleviate my sickness. I
imagined that my constitution was breaking up,
and as the disease progressed I became more,
nervous and hysterical. My sufferings were also
greatly increased by a shock to the nervous system
received last year, when a railway carriage in
which I was seated caught fire. When my case
was most critical and gave serious apprehensions
to my friends and myself, I started on a course of
Clements Tonic, which I took, in conjunction with
Dr. Fletcher’s pills. The first two bottles effected
a great improvement, and I could relish my food
again, and my general weakness and nervousness
vanished altogether. I took about twelve bottles
of Clements Tonic, and my pale face is now re-
placed with the hue of health, and my recovery is
as complete as it was speedy.” D. W. Carter,
Esq., of the same city, also writes ; “During the
past twelve months I have suffered from a general
breakdown of the system, and being of a bilious
disposition, I suffered acutely from indigestion
and its train of distressing effects, most particu-
larly sick headaches. Six bottles of Clements
Tonic and a few boxes of Fletcher's pills effected
a radical cure, and I shall always be glad to certify
accordingly.”
An excess of animal food and a partial closing
of the pores of the skin, during the winter months
cause the system to become filled with impurities.
These are removed and the blood purified by
taking Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

•Tohn Hoare Carden, Protectionist jour-

conscience of a lawyer, the morality of a politician,
and the intellect of an ass.
A cojiy of the small, thin volume, con-
taining the first productions of Alfred Homett’s
pen Domett was the “Waring” of Browning,
and was sometime Premier of Maoriland, where
he emigrated through a false and fickle fair —was
sold recently for two guineas in London, the

Ihe Bulletin can lay its hand on another.
Kaiser Wilhelm's announced crusade
against the fie-fies has no doubt a more or less
personal origin. His own physical infirmities are
a mark of his blood-connection with what Bis-
marck called “those scrofulous Guelphs.” And
his father, it is now well-known, did not die of
cancer—but of the disease in wliich Dr. Alfred
Fournier, of Paris, and Dr, Jonathan Hutchin-
son, of London, are specialists.
Stead's cause of quarrel with Dilke is not
merely that Dilke is alleged to have committed
adultery. Stead and God could forgive
adulterers. It is not merely that Dilke is alleged
to have told lies about his alleged adultery. Stead
—and God—could forgive even that. Dilke’s
crime is obviously that Dilke told lies to Stead.
There is no pardon under Heaven, either from
Stead or from God, for a crime of that sort.

church gallery was “reserved” for assigned
servants and others “in bond.” The Canon had
drawn £2OO a year from Government for 52 years,
and his death was, no doubt, an indirect conse-
quence of the recent great Sydney investment
society smash.
A few months ago Mr. Allen, the repre-
sentative of a big publishing firm (Longmans),
was in Sydney, and Premier Parkes, profuse in
his attentions and hospitality to the man, asked
for a candid opinion of his poems—how many
copies would sell in London. The opinion was
candidly given. “I think,” said the expert,
“that you might expect five copies to be sold.
I mention five, because that was the number that
was sold of some poems of—er—about the same
sort.”
Our talented young friend, J. Le Gay
Erereton, of Sydney, has just published a
strong article in favour of vegetarianism in
New York Twentieth Century. As to the
argument of the orthodox, that they eat flesh
“ because God gave animals for food,” he remarks,
“ Fancy the Creator and moral governor of the
Universe a butcher, supplying Smith, Brown,
and Robinson with dead flesh !” The Pastoralists’
Association will have to suppress Erereton, who
threatens to ruin the market for fat stock.
Colonel Johnston, the deposer of Governor
Eligh, was buried in a vault on the Annandale
estate. He was detested by the “first fleeters.”
A story is told that some old hands determined
that his spirit should not rest. In those days it
was commonly believed that a spirit would never
rest once it was carried across the water. Not
long after Colonel Johnston’s death, according to
the story, his vault was opened, and the coffin was
carried down to the water-frontage of the estate,
and then rowed across to the shore of White Horse
Bay.
A Bulletin correspondent recently as-
that “The Exile’s Farewell” of horsey-
poet Gordon, respecting the alleged discovery of
which A. P. Martin raised such a cook-a-doodlo-
doo some years ago, was to be found in a volume
of the poet’s verses issued at Mt. Garnbier, S.A.
ihe statement has been questioned, of course, by
someone in Mr. Martin’s interest. “The matter,”
remarks the correspondent, “ can easily be set at
rest by a reference to the family of Mr. Riddoch
(S.A.), on whose station Gordon w'as a stock-
rider.”
Parkes did once make a genuine bun-mot.
One night during his candidature for a seat in the
old N.S. W. Legislative Council, he was announced
to speak in the skittle-alley of a Sydney Sussex-
street pub., and a man dropped in about a quarter
of an hour after the advertised time of opening to
find only about nine or ten persons present, all
of whom had apparently been asked and had
refused to take the chair. On Parkes observing
the new-comer, he rushed forward, and, shaking
him enthusiastically by the hand, begged him to
preside. “But,” gasped the new-arrival, “I don’t
know you !” “ That’s all the better,” said ’Enry
—“ the others do /”
Hodder and Staughton, of London, have
issued a book under the title of “George Fife
Angas,” who, says his biographer, “ was one of
the fathers and founders of South Australia,
originated the South Australian company, the
Bank of South Australia, the National Provincial
Bank of England, and the Union Bank of Aus-
tralia, and whose foresight and shrewdness won
for Great Britain the possession of New Zealand
as a colony.” This all sounds very nice, but the
fact is that South Australia has been a rich father
to the now millionaire Angas family, who got
thousands upon thousands of acres of its most
beautiful land at half-a-sovereign an acre.
Dan. O’Connor, M.L.C., never tells his.
friends the story of Sara Bernhardt’s reception at
the Australia Hotel, Sydney. The reception was
rather a fiasco as far as the spokesmen for the
proprietary were concerned. Henry Gorman, a
director of the hotel company, and a good-looking
fellow, was the first to welcome the artiste; but
his remarks awakened no response. Then the
sombre-looking Dr. Garran addressed Sara; and
still no notice was taken of the speaker or the
welcome. But whilst Dan O’Connor was couching
a welcome in a hybrid tongue she caught sight of
a familiar face in the distance. Leaving the three
great men at the entrance, Sara advanced towards
her friend, and to Dan. O’Connor’s mortification
she put her hands on her friend’s shoulders and
said, “Ah! Mr. Moore, of the Toronto Hotel, I
know I’ll be so happy here.”
B. F. Underwood, the erstwhile distin-
guished materialist, of Boston, U.S.A., has
turned spiritualist. Same old story—the highest
type of inquiring intellect is like the Huma, the
fabled bird of passage which is always on tire
wing. The present tide of change is in favour of
Spiritualism and all that kind of thing, and per-
haps it is on that account that we find Stead pre-
paring a Christmas issue devoted solely to ghost-
stories. From our standpoint one thing is certain.
T he man to whom a “ghost ” appears and who is
quite sure that if he hits it on the head hard with
a half-brick its skull will be fractured, is sane and
nr no danger of losing his reason. On the other
hand, the man who, seeing an alleged ghost,
regards it as a visitor from the other world, may
go cranky any day. When you see a ghost, dear
friends, kick it in the shins.
Just to prevent Arthur Patchett Martin
in ins forthcoming “ Life of Lord Sherbrooke ”
(Robert Lowe) crediting Lowe with the author-
ship of some verses on Caroline Chisholm, the
philanthropist, which appeared in the Empire,
Sydney newspaper, under Lowe’s name, we may
say definitely that the lines in question, begin-
ning—
were written by the lately-deceased J. Sheridan
Moore. The first time the writer of this para-
graph saw these lines was as a cutting pasted
opposite Mrs. Chisholm’s portrait in the scrap-
book of a_ wealthy squatteress in the Kyneton
district, Vic. “ You are looking at that extract,”
said the hostess: “I owe all I have to Caroline
Chisholm—l’m one of her girls. She-brought me
out and found me my husband.” The hubby was
worth at least a couple of hundred thousand then
Old Thomas Roadknight, septuagenarian
Victorian squatter, who has gone to select new
country in the next world, began Australian life
as a pound-keeper in Vandemonia. As “ Price
Waning ” remarked months ago, it is curious how
many of the first squatting families similarly
originated. An early-day pound-keeper had a
finer opportunity than any other man, bar a first-
rank official, of stocking unsettled country at
small—or no—cost. Roadkuight was one of the
party who went out in search of Gellibrand and
Hesse, who were lost in Western Victoria
while exploring. Another of the patty was
the Rev. Thomas Beagley Naylor, that great-
souled parson whom “ Charley ” Naylor,
of Bathurst, had the honor to call father.
On the route, about where the township of
Birregurra now stands, the search-party encoun-
tered a tribe of blacks. One of the men fired a
musket just as Naylor started a hymn—Naylor
always believed in pacific methods and lie thought
that music would soothe the savage breast. The
blacks bolted, and it remains in dispute to this
day whether Naylor’s singing or the musket re-
port made them skedaddle. Roadknight always
averred ’twas the hymn.
General Whichcote, “the very last Water-
loo officer,” as the London Times called him, who
died last August, had a narrow escape ’from
becoming a tremendous potentate in N.S. Wales.
He and Ovens, whose name is dabbed on a score
of geographical features of three Australian
Provinces, were brother-subalterns, and fought
through the Peninsular War. On their regiment
being ordered, however, to Botany Bay, Which-
cote exchanged, preferring the gory battle-field to
being boss-constable and founder of a first family in
thepenalColonies. Ovens, when chief-engineer, and
therefore having nominal control over the surveys
of the time, promised, in ’23 or ’24. a big grant to
Whichcote “in token of their long friendship.”
But, as Whichcote didn’t come, it is presumed
5000 acres or so of N.S.W. territory kicked the
beam when weighed against the prospect of being
shot through the head for the honour of his king
and the glory of his bleeding country. In a map
of the Twenties, one of the Blue Mountain Peaks
is entitled, “ Wicheote’’—obviously after the
chief-engineer’s comrade-in-arms. Ovens is buried
at St. Leonards’ Cemetery, North Sydney, in the
tomb of his friend, Judge Ellis Bent, but his
remains were originally interred with Bent’s on
Garden Island, Sydney Harbour. One of Ovens’
playful little characteristics has already afforded
“Price Waning” a subject for a story, but the
sequel to that narrative, which would have to
relate the circumstances attendant on the removal
of the remains, while well-known to some persons
m Sydney, could not be published except in a
very much Bowdlerised condition. It was Ovens
by the way, who confirmed, if fie did not
originate, the use of the appellation of “ Vittoria”
for the celebrated N.S.W. Biue .Mountains
eminence, now termed Mt. “ Victoria?’—Vittoria
having been one of the battles at which Ovens
was present. In any case, the evidence is
undoubted that “ Mt. Victoria,” as a topograhi-
cal designation, was first employed by Major
Mitchell, and that simply as a compliment in
anticipation to Her Pre - Eminent -in - Grief
Majesty.

t An investigation of the records of the
N.S.W. Lands titles Office would cause some
people to fly an Australian province. Here is one
little job, one of many, probably, perpetrated by
uhe managing director of an alleged investment
company. Mr. John Smith, a Victorian, owned
some lots near the metropolis of an adjoining
province. In an inflated market the lots were
worth £800; and at that figure he made an offer
of them to Managing Director Brown. “Well,’*
suggested the Official, “suppose t get you £150<3
for the lots, will you give me £500?” “Oh,
yes,’ said Mr. Smith ; and in a short time the
directorate accepted the lots at the fancy figure,
and Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown were well satisfied
with their share in the transaction.

counsel held briefs for the same side through a
solicitor’s error—recalls the fact that on one
occasion, during a busy time, the late “Dick”
Ireland, Q.C , rushed from Redmond Larry's
‘new court” to Sir William StawelTs “old
court, ’ and commenced addressing the jury as for
the plaintiff while he was actually briefed for the
defendant. He had got well under weigh when
liis junior—who happened also to be his son-in-
law—plucked him by the gown and whispered
him. Old Dick got out of the trouble very
adroitly. “That, gentlemen,” said he, “is what

The “man Yardley,” who, according to
Mr. Fitzgerald, M.L.A., “stood at Sir Saul

Methodist preacher. He was formerly a clerk in
the Victorian Agent-General’s office, and obtained
his present appointment by mere accident. Capt.
Jopp, who was the secretary to the N.S.W. Agent-
General, having been offered an Imperial a| point-
men t, asked William Forster’s permission to
retire. Forster pointed out that his sudden resig-
nation would be most inconvenient, when Jopp
said he knew a man who would suit him. “Bring
him to me,” said Forster, and accordingly Yard”
ley was ushered in and appointed at once. When
he entered the office he knew absolutely nothing
of the country which was to pay his salary, and
his knowledge even now doesn’t amount to much.
He has never been in any of the Anstralias (this
remark applies to all the other officials of the
N.S.W. Agency-General save the chief, Sir Saul),
nor does he know anything about the people.’
And this is the man who. in many respects is
virtually Agent-General. By the way, Sir Saul
Samuel managed to have ail his staff put upon the
N.S.W. Civil Service list. They therefore hold
their positions during good behaviour, and are
entitled to pensions or compensation for loss of
office. In this respect their positions differ from
those of the staffs of any of the other Agents-
General. Which shows how narrowly Parliamen-
tary votes should be watched.

wlmri twd loudly-dressed and highly-excited
females presented themselves at the door alld

language unfit for publication, in which they
contrasted his professions as a Sunday-school

with reinforcements at the next meeting night.
I hey kept their pledge. Taking advantage of the
doorkeeper’s momentary absence, four of them
burst, into Labour’s Parliament, and gave Simon
a series of homilies, based on the one-man-one-
woman doctrine, to which Simon listehed, stnok-
mg, with that apparent equanimity which is the
proper policy for such an occasion. Forced to
tlie door, these indignant females recounted the
alleged wrongs of one of their number to a sym-

wished to bring matters to a climax, to smash a

The “Women’s Crusade” is a romantic
little boil on the neck of the “Sydney Rescue
Work Society,” and one of its most fascinating
channels of labour is the visitation of various city
and suburban lock-ups on Sunday mornings
and ladies armed with gruesome pails of
slop tea and throat-tickling piles of bread-
and-butter. At a festive celebration, the
other day, graced by (amongst other cele-
brities) G. E. Ardill and the Rev. Soo
Moo Ten—who, though a Chinese, is by far the
most English-gentlemanly-looking cleric in the
Anglican diocese of Sydney—the mouthpiece of
the Crusade related that, during the past five
months* 282 female and 808 male drunks had been
provided with Sunday-morning cups of tea and
bread-and butter in oiled

stitution.

Old John Cox, of Miingoplah, was the
most popular man in the Wage a district, for his
hand was ever in his pocket, and he was always
ready to do a good turn to anybody lie liked.
Amongst others indebted to him for kindnesses
was Pat. % the brewer. Some time after
Cox’s death Pat. came to Wagga at Circuit time,
and on his way back to Albury be was accom-
panied by a certain barrister and a Crown law
official. They were travelling by a back track to
Germanton, and on the way they had to pass the
Wagga cemetery, where poor Cox’s bones lay.
“Stop,” said Pat., who was pretty well “on,”
“we must say a prayer over poor John Cox’s
grave.” Accordingly, the trio dismounted from
the buggy, and, after search, the grave was found.
“Do any of yez know the day yrofundis?” en-
quired Pat. “ I’ll thry,” said the barrister, who
proceeded to repeat the psalm in Latin, but, after
a line or two, broke down. Nor was the Crown
law official a bit more successful in English. At
last Pat. lost patience, and said : “ Shtop ; I’ll say

A sherill’s-oflber at Wagga, N.S.W., has
just celebrated his “ golden wedding.”
Curious how some men who ought to have
been making the grass grow green a generation
ago survive I Thomas Henry Braim, the" alleged
Doctor of Divinity who was head master or the"
Church Grammar School, Hobart Town, from
1835 to ’4l, and Principal of Sydney College from
'll to’4B, died in England a week, or two ago.
His chi f claim to be remembered is that be wrote
a History.of New South Wales, which was pub-
lished in two volumes, in 1846. As a combinaticn
of the.sermon and the guide-book the work is not
without merit, but to the students of this genera-
tion it is rendered valueless by the too obvious
desire of the author to paint a very rotten state of
things in tints of rosy-red. He was a strong
supporter of the powers that were, and it was due
to hii out-and-out resolve to holster up .Bishop
Broughton’s ecclesiastical pretentions that he was
admitted to holy orders, which he took on
returning to England, lie came out again to
Australia and was pitchforked by Bishop Perry, of
Melbourne, into the Archdeaconry of Portland
(Western Yic.), much against the wishes of the
Hentys, the sturdy old pioneers of Merino Downs
Station, who were almost as good churchmen as
they were squatters. Frank Henry wanted the
Bishop to appoint that notable clergyman and
splendid bushinan, Doctor Cusack Rus ell, “The
Bishop of the West,” whose memory is revered
to-day even by men who never enter a Church.
Braim retired from the Archdeaconry in
1866, as “ being incapable of further ministerial
work,” finally went “home,” and, apparently,
because of the incapacity aforesaid, held several
wealthy rectorships, whose souls he cared for by
means of curates on £BO a year or so.
» # #
“Price Waning,” by the way, has a letter
of Braim’s which is interesting as showing the
surpassing generosity of the man. It is so charac-
teristic of the clerical temperament to help others
along in the world by invoking the aid of friends.
Braim was not a cleric when he wrote the letter,
but he was qualifying rapidly. Here’s the
screed :
Sydney, September 30, 1843.—'Siv Dear Sir,—lt is out
of my power at this moment to render you any pecuniary
assistance- can you not obtain it from your Lodge? If I
were in a position to help you I would gladly. Mr. Sat-
terie did speak to mo about printing, and in the event of
his being able among bis friends to raise the money to
print his lectures (on Education), I told him he would
lind Mr. Bent the cheapest man and one who deserved
encouragement. Mr. S has some good friends who were
(or are) expected to help him in the publishing of his
work. I am very willing to throw in my mite for the
good of any friend, and especially for one united to me by
the “mystic tye.”—Yours truly, T. K. Braim.
. The letter is written to Andrew Bent—-the “ Aus-
tralian Franklin,” the “ father of the Tasmanian
Press”—titles given tohim by Edward Smith Hall.
Thanks to the press policy of Governor Arthur
and Solicitor-General Alfred Stephen, Bent, after
20 years of fighting for freedom of speech in the
Southern Island, was financially crushed and
came to Sydney, where he made an appeal for
assistance to start a printing business. Braim
replied in the manner indicated. Sir Alfred
Stephen, however, subscribed £5 to Bent’s assist-
ance, “notwithstanding,” as he wrote, “that
Mr. Bent said very many unkind tilings about
me when I was in Van Dieman’s Land.” Old
Bent’s necessities (so he noted upon the Judge’s
letter) prevented him returning the fiver,

“Five Years a Waitress” writes to The
Bulletin a long letter of which this paragraph is
the central point:—
The meanness of Man in liis business dealings with
Woman was never better shown than in the fact that
when a man gets his dinner at a restaurant provided with
male waiters, he almost invariably “lips” those male
waiters; whereas when he buys his meal at a restaurant
where women serve, he refrains from uiving any tip. So
general is this rule that whereas most waiters receive
handsome additions to their wages through the source
mentioned, it can lie boldly said that a waitress-I mean,
of course, the honest waitress—doesn’t make a shilling a
week in gifts.

London. Young Wilson, who rejoice? in the

original Sarah) have always escaped scandal, and
in that respect are in sfrong contrast to the males.

This tale is about two brothers who went
over to Maoriland and bought a farm. They
were a hard-working pair, and upright in all their
dealings, but one of them smoked, and the other
didn’t. Smoking is a low and beastly habit,
as may be ascertained by consulting the good
little Sunday-school b:ok about the small boy
who was always pious and who died of consump-
tion when he was very young. The individual
who didn’t smoke put away the money thus saved,
and when he had got £lO together he bought a
valuable cow with the loot. The cow cost £2O, so
he went into debt for the other £lO. Then as he
was getting the animal home it bolted into a
quarry and broke its neck, and its owner was £lO
worse off than if he had smoked all his life. He
got back to the farm in a solemn mood, and
found that the other fellow had set the house on
fire while lighting his pipe, and it had been burnt
to the ground. If the one brother hadn’t smoked
he wouldn’t have set the house on fire, and if the
other one had smoked he wouldn’t have been
away fooling with the cow, and would have been
on hand to extinguish the fire. Anybody who
wants to get up an anti tobacco argument can sort
these facts out at his leisure.

Writes a Far Northern correspondent :
.It is a curious fact noted by stocluneu that old bulls
hunted out of herds of either wild or tame cattle
invariably make for the east in the Slates ; old buffalo
1 mils always make for the foot hills of the Rockies when
hunted away from the droves; hut in Australia the
buffalo outcasts follow the rule of their scarcely less wild
brethren and make tor the east. A buffalo hull has been
killed as far east as Lolworth Station, close to Charters
Towers, Q., and at a station near Herberton one was
killed by Mr. Wallace Grant and party last year. Into
■.las brute not less than sixteen bullets from a Snider rifle
,verc fired, and even then the hunters had to knock him
on the head with an axe. The chase lasted for miles, but
Mr. Grant, an expert stockman, kept “working” the
brute in a circle, and finally got him close to the station-
house, where the chase ended. Those who have never
seen the buffalo would not believe how thick the hide is
over the neck and on the frontlet. There are few, if any,
rifles which would penetrate the adamantine wall that
protected the brain of the animal killed at Herberton.
The horns are not slender and sharp-pointed, as shown in
an engraving in a somewhat celebrated work recently
published in Sydney, on the contrary, they are exceed-
ingly thick at the base and taper but little towards the
points, which are very blunt.
What sort of iron man is this ?
The spectacle is numbing,
Full 50 years of married bliss,
Full 25 of “ bumming
No matter who salt tears are shedding,
He celebrates his “ golden wedding.”
What “executions ” he has notched
With earmarks faintly valid 1
How many widows’ houses watched
And orphans’ playthings tallied !
Fate’s victims have a right to rail if
Old Time deals gently with a bailiff.
The sight of misery can't kill,
For habitude makes callous;
The same as vice will flourish still
Beneath the very gallows.
The man sees numberless to-morrows
Who runs the rule o’er others’ sorrows.
Our joker was a bank-clerk first;
Then, digger; next, book-keeper;
Then, ran a store; then, last and vyorct,
A bailiff. Say, some weeper,
Can there be any Kingdom-come
For quarter-een ury of bum?

For the Cure of
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the best known remedy. When the,
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and. in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
nduces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Colds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always beat hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

Sundry Cablegrams.
Some One has nz in anger in the frozen land of night
Ana at the Czar has recklessly been heaving dynamite ;
liut he heaved the substance wildly, and he aimed not
worth ad m,
And the corpse was not inserted in the Herald's cable-
gram.
Frozen meat is looking upward, and wool is rather flat,
And a somewhat stronger tendency is manifest in fat;
(Jm Oiawous Queen is bilious, which arose from eating
ham,
And was feeling just like Tophet, says a special cable-
gram.
Another man in Canada has done a sudden slope,
One, Jones, has been suspended from a gallows with a
rope,
And a baron has been crumpled up in London by a tram
(Any sort of rubbish helps to fill a Herald cablegram).
Butter, at last advices, had gone up to 1/3 ;
And a bag of human bones had been discovered in a tree:
And a cranky king is wallowing, naked, in a quart of
jam,
And his language is appalling—sample sent per cable-
gram. r
There s a cheerful row in Chili, where the air is full of
stones,
And scalps are flying loosely, likewise hair and shot and
bones ;
And a Spanish heir-apparent fell down eight stairs with a
slam,
And his horrid howls are printed in the Noose’s cable-
gram.
A waterspout has busted up—so likewise has a bank,
the remains of one, Maloney, have been met with in a
tank,
And the last-discovered fever-germ has proved on close
exam-
ination to be bogus. —Scientific cablegram.
A yellow-headed female has just gone for a divorce ;
A Juggins filed his schedule through the backing of a
(Some of these things are fakes, and some are lies, and
some are sham,
And all of them are drivel in the latest cablegram).

Some Sydney publicans’ names—Bacchus,
Sucker, Kickham, Philpots, Negus, Beer, Grand-
fill, Brewer, Paine.
Napoleon said the Duchess of Angouleme
“’was the only man among the Bourbons.”
Where is the man among the Guelphs?
Jews and guinea-pigs never catch cholera.
Diabetes and shortsightedness are the ailments to
which the former are most generally subject. To
these may also be added —shortsighted promissory-
notes.
Many men in the North bear marks of
desperate encounters with the niggers, but it is
doubtful if anyone there carries such terrible
sears as does Jack Kennedy, now a blacksmith at
Hughenden, N.Q. ; certain it is that few men
recover from brain injuries so extensive as he
received. In the desperate fight which marked
the man for life and in which he received wounds
which would have killed any two ordinary men,
he won against big odds. One of Kennedy’s mates
tells to The Bulletin the story of the row. The
party to which K. belonged owned a claim some
distance from Port Darwin, and were engaged in
sinking a shaft thereon. One day Kennedy took
a team of horses and, in company with a fourteen-
year-old boy, started out to bring in timber for
the shaft. After going some miles, the horses
were unhooked, and, having lunched, Kennedy
took the traces off a heavy pair of brass hames in
order to do some repairs; having attended to
which matter, he lay down beneath the dray. He
had slept but a few moments, when he was
aroused by the boy yelling: “Niggers, Jack,
niggers!” Grasping one of the hames, K. darted
out from under the dray, but was met, as he started
to his feet by a blow from a tomahawk which split
open his forehead and filled his eyes with blood.
Sweeping the blood away with his left hand,
Kennedy began to swing his hame, and for the
next few moments there was as merry a little
fight as has ever been seen in the Territory.
While the shindy was progressing the boy under
the dray kept yelling, “Give ’em hell, Jack-
give ’em hell.” And Jack did “ give ’em hell,”
for he killed three of those niggers, and so badly
wounded others, that they had to retreat. After
the battle Kennedy fainted from loss of blood,
but was brought round by the boy, who finally
got him into the dray, hitched up a pair of the
horses and started back for camp, which was
reached with the wounded man more dead than
alive. However, be recovered, and is to-day as
perfect a picture of manhood as there is in
Australia. From the blow in the back of the
head he has a depression four inches long, an
inch-and-a-quarter wide, and over half-an-inch
deep. His left cheek is disfigured by a dreadful
scar five inches long, the cut making which went
to the bone and knocked out several teeth. In
addition there is a terrible scar from the first
blow over the right eye, and numerous others on
neck, face, shoulders, and breast. Kennedy does
not blow about the fight.

Sickness Cured, Health Preserved, and Life Prolonged by Dr- A. Wilford Hall’s Great Hygienic Discovery-
The treatment disclosed is unfolded in the “HEALTH PAMPHLET, ”—a condensed prescription of 48 pages. To read and study this pamphlet is to

it to be seen by any person ; nor will I use the treatment with any others except the members of my own
family, from each of whom a promise shall be exacted not to reveal the treatment to others.

who will forward the Pamphlet by return mail.
We would respectfully refer as to our reliability to the Editor of this paper.
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
fequire a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
es it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be maintained.
Boctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
Providing they do not show the pamphlet or dc not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World says :—“ We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. Wo have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Freeman’s Journal says After a careful perusal
of the pamphlet we have no hesitancy in recommending
the treatment which Dr. Hall discovered.”
The Sydney Mail says:—“ We have seen the pamphlet,
and, although we cannot reveal its secrets, we can bear
testimony to the bona-fides of the advertisement.”
Martin’s Home and Farm says:—“ We can recommend
it as a genuine thing.”
The Aultralian Star says“ It is thoroughly purify-
ing. hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
Truth says:— “ It is beyond a doubt all that is claimed
for it.”
Sunday Times says: —“ It will, we believe, where cure
is not possible, assist in alleviating ; and to folks suffering
from habitual constipation, indigestion, deficient cir-
culation, and poorness of blood, it cannot fail to be of
benefit.”
Brisbane Evening Observer says:—“ A feature of the
treatment is that it requires no extra expense after the
first cost of the pamphlet, and can be applied as easily in
the bush as in the city.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.
Australian Independent says:—“To sufferinghumanity
we regard the discovery as a wonderful boon.”
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment —
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following :
***** “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. 1 learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time - forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘bloom of youth,’
though ho is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely he due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may bo able to unfold in
the lino of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.—ll. F. Stevens, M.D.”
“ Sydney, 11th August, 1891.
“ Mr. J. C. Oakman.—Dear Sir,—l have great pleasure
in recommending Dr. A. Wilford Hall’s treatment, as I
have derived great benefit from its use. I have for years
been suffering from torpid liver, dyspepsia, constipation,
and the last two years from inward piles ; but after the
use of Dr. A. W. Hall's treatment for about two months
I find myself entirely cured of that very painful com-
plaint the piles, and all my other troubles are getting
gradually less, and I firmly believe that a continuation of
this treatment will restore me to perfect health again. I
shall be very happy to give any one any further informa-
tion if deserved.—Yours very truly, Robert Tarin, 231
Goulburn-street, Surry Hills.”
“ Wellshot Station, Ist August, 1891.
“ Mr. J. C. Oakman, 8 O Connell-street, Sydney. —Dear
Sir, —Yours of July 14 to hand. Thank you very much
for your kind offer, to help me in case I could not under-
stand thoroughly the pamphlet or if I found difficulty in
applying the treatment. It is not the case. I understand
English as well as French, and as for the treatment it has
already done a world of good, and the pamphlet is worth
hundred times the money. If it had been translated in
French 1 would have advised some friends and
relations at home to buy it. This is the
reason why I was asking, and I hope it will soon
be translated in every known language and spread
all over the world. I have been suffering from dyspepsia
for the last 20 years, and a few days of this treatment
has done me more good and given me more relief than
all the remedies I ever tried before.—l am, dear sir, yours
aithfully, Jude Derbbxv.”
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7 :
“ ***Touching your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect: sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as thougli I had a new lease of
life. 1 have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
1 have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, • I would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when 1 bought your pamphlet —Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
“ Sydney, June S, 1891.
“Mr. Oakman.—Dear Sir, —I have now used for one
month the treatment described in Dr. A. W. Hall's
health pamphlet, and I certainly fee 1 a wonderful
improvement in health, so great that 1 cannot describe
how very different my feelings are, for life is now enjoy-
able; but for nine years past it has often been veiy
miserable. In the head I have suffered dreadfully, owing
to softening of the brain, and often partial temporary
paralysis of tongue, and other parts; also frequent
severe pains at the heart, with less and less capacity for
work, and other troubles, all of which have ceasid to
trouble me except a slight occasional reminder at the
heart. lam exceedingly thankful to the Almighty, and
to Dr. Hall, and yourself, that I am so well, for a month
ago I felt as if some dreadful climax was near.—Yours
truly, Susan E. Hawkins, 58 Henry-street, Leichhardt,
N.S.W.”
“ Glenburn Public School, Wiseman’s Creek,
“ August 14, 1891.
“J. C. Oakman. Dear Sir, —I have very much pleasure in
testifyin\ to the efficiency of Dr. Hall's hygienic treatment.
I have bum a sufferer from indigestion and constipation
in its woivt forms for the last eight years, and during
that time I have consulted four (4) medical practitioncis
of great skill, but have received very little relief. I have
used a terrible lot of pills and patent medicines. At first
they used to give me a certain amount of relief, but for
six months before using Dr. Hall’s remedy they were quite
useless. For three months before using the hygienic
treatment I suffered terrible pain in my stomach and
bowels, especially at night. 1 could not sleep but very
little, and had frightful dreams. Mrs. MTnnes had to put
mustard plasters and hot flannels across my stomach
before I could get any relief. I have been using the
hygienic treatment for live weeks, and thank God it has
given m great relief. Since I have started to use it I
have not felt any pain, and can sleep quite sound every
night. I have not felt the slightest touch of indigestion
since, and can eat three hearty, good meals every day.
Everybody says how well I begin to look. My wife arid
daughter also use it with good results. I have not the
slightest doubt but that it will cure diseases of the
stomach, liver, kidney, and bowels.—Faithfully yours,

The “Boomer.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
York Peninsula (N.Q.) 20 years ago. A
wilderness of niggers, heat, snakes, alligators,
fever-and-ague, hunger, and men of angry passions
and skill with firearms. Altogether an insanitary
country, especially that around the B : g Mitchell.
Yet men, fired with the gold-fever, flocked thither
from all directions —from Ballarat and Bendigo,
from Hokitika and Hill End, from anywhere and
everywhere between Shark Bay and Point Danger.
Some are there still—underground.
Among the pioneers of 20 years ago was an
enterprising individual who amassed much wealth
in a short time, without undergoing any of the
fatigue of digging for it. This was “The
Boomer,” known by that title for a hundred
miles round, and admittedly the smartest
horse-thief within 150 miles of Cooktown.
He was a big fellow, and supposed to be
desperately savage ; mounted police were scarce,
and not too anxious to meet such an expert with
the revolver as, he was reputed to be. So “The
Boomer” continued gaily on his career of annexa-
tion —stole the diggers’ horses with the strictest
impartiality, and by close attention to business
flourished and throve exceedingly. He was a born
raider; in fact, his talent for the profession
amounted to genius; and, if it had not been for
one unfortunate weakness in his character, lie
might have continued his lucrative employment to
this day. But he had one serious defect in his
disposition ; he was too theatrical in his methods
—too fond of posing, as it were. He would risk
capture through a feverish love of approbation
which more than once caused him to run off a mob
of horses through the midst of a diggers’ camp in
broad daylight. Or, if in the course of business,
he lifted an unusually good horse, he, wouldn’t dis-
pose of it along with the rest of his haul. He’d
ride it about in a calm and unconcerned, and
almost obtrusive manner. It was very showy, but
it wasn’t good business.
* * *
One day the mailman called at the camp
on the Big Mitchell on his way to Cooktown. He
hobbled his saddle-horse and his pack-horse and
turned them loose for “an hour or two.” But
when he went to get them, his riding-horse wasn’t
there. And before evening a man arrived who
had met that identical prad about three miles out,
“ goin’ along nice and easy,” he said, “under the
command of a big, black-whiskered cove, with
white pants and a cabbage-tree hat.”
“It’s that there ‘Boomer’ again, Dan,” said a
sympathiser.
“ Well,” said Dan, “I’m after him ! And if I
catch him, I’ll ‘Boomer ’ him, by Heavens, I will!”
Dan also made some more remarks, chiefly of a
profane nature. Then, leaving the mailbags
behind, pro tern,, he mounted his pack-horse, and
rode off in the direction indicated by the man who
had last seen Dan’s property.
* * *
The mailman returned about daylight next
morning. He was riding the big brown saddle-
horse, and leading the pack-horse upon which he
had ridden away. He said he had found the horse
a few miles away, hobbled ; it had only just
strayed away. “That fellow that saw a man on
his back must ha’ bin drunk,” said Dan. “The
bloomin’ horse wasn’t stole at all!”
“Where’s the hobbles, Dan?” said someone, as
Dan dismounted.
Dan gave a start. “Oh ! the hobbles ! Why,
1 -didn’t I bring ’em? 1 must ha’ left cm on
the ground when 1 caught the horse. 15r——.”
Just then another inqirsitive bystander chipped
i n—
“ Where did you raise the halter, Dan, to lead
the old pack-horse back? You went away without
one, ’cause I saw you I ’
“ Pity you didn’t have time to mind your own
business ! ’ said Dan.
“But where did you get it, Dan? I want to
know, ’cause it looks bloomin’ like a baiter that
useter belong .”
“Eellcr lent it me,” growled Dan; “’taint
yours, nohow !”
And he packed his mail-bags, climbed on his
horse, and departed.
# * *
A couple of mounted troopers happened to
ride a’ong that way a few days later. As they
crossed the dried-up, gravelly bed of a small
creek, their horses simultaneously snorted and
shied. The men swore at the horses and then
looked round to see—“ What the something you’re
frightened at?”
They found it. If the flies had not been making
as much noise as a hive of bees they would have
discovered “it” in another way. North Queens-
land summer weather has a very powerful effect
on such things.
Stretched at full length amid the long grass
was the dead body of a black-bearded man of
large size. There was a small hole in the right
side of his forehead, which, however, couldn’t be
seen till a layer of flies, an inch deep, had been
shifted. There were ants, too, and other creeping
things, and
The troopers 1 held a short consultation —at a
distance.
“ Wish to goodness we’d come some other way,
Jack. A wise man never found a dead man.”
“ Who’s to say we didn’t ? ”
“ Will you, though ? ”
“ Rather ! There’s no track near this p’ace.
Mightn't ever be anybody along here again for
years.”
“ Well, by George, I’m with you ! I’d rather
lose five pound than have the handling of that.
I wish we had a nip ! Let’s make for old Skinner’s
shanty ! ”
So they left.
And since then no man has ever set eyes on
“ The Boomer.”

gently-sloping plateau which had been the scene
<>f the monthly parade of the metropolitan
battalion of rifles, and of the two urban batteries
of field artillery, to the dust of tile unformed
thoroughfare was a change that irritated the
men’s tempers to the point of discipline break in™.
It was good comradeship and not the Mutiny Act
that held the stalwart, finely-drilled volunteers of
the Sixties and Seventies together : and when the
officers travelled beyond Ur- limit of cons derate-
ness, and aped the martinet, well, there was going
to be trouble at the next company meeting.
So, with tlie fatigue of a hot afternoon’s work
pressing upon them, when the files breasted the
waves of dust that sported demoniacally on the
great highway, there was grumbling that was deep
and hints which were loud.
“Dismiss us now!” “ Break off!'’ “Let’s
fall out here ! ” “Hang the walk home—it's too
not 1 and such like observations, linked with tlie
circumstances that the brasses of the Richmond
and the fifes of the Carlton bauds were (so the
instrumentalists averred) decidedly recalcitrant
because of the dust, and the dryness of the
players’ throats, suggested to the company com-
manders the desirability of then and there dis-
missing their respective corp-.
And corps after corps of “Red” Rifles the
country boys were the “ Greys ’’ —was halted and
dismissed. And as the men broke off, most
paused on their way to Princes Bridge Railway-
station and the cab-stands to jeer at the poor
devils of artillery-men. They had to travel to
their distant orderly-rooms there to make their
horses and their beauties of Armstrong six-
pounders snug for the night.
“Quite unsoldierly I” quoth Softgoode, cap-
tain of the St. Kilda Battery, to Draven, major
of the crack Kast Melbourne, as the two batteries
were about to draw off in opposite directions,
“ the riflemen falling Out here I ’
“Quite I ” echoed Draven.
“Look here, Draven, send Kynge in command
to your dep6t. I’ll send Barchester with ours,
and we’ll drop over to Stubb’s quarters with the
rifle-fellows and sample the Captain’s claret.’’
Instantly, the crack gunners were halted and
Kynge was placed in command. “ Important
meeting— er—Rifle Association Committee, at
Barracks, Lieutenant Kynge—just convened,’’
the Major murmured.
“ H’m-claret —shandy gaff ? ” insubordinately
questioned the subaltern as he saluted. The
Major did not hear him though. His tall, lithe
figure was already keeping step with the neater-
built Softgoode’s, as they made for the Victoria
Barracks, whither nine out of the Rifles’ officers
had preceded them.
It was dry work a field parade in November,
and Stubbs’, genialest of military secretaries, was
the most hospitable of souls. And it was only a
step across the road from the Immigrants’ Aid
Depot’s paddocks to the old Barracks -so short a
'-tep (hat it, a* a matter of regular routine, c n-
fcuierably lengthened Stubbs’s wine-bill.

In short, there Was in the unk - wainscotted
mess-room, not alone the samples of tlie secretary’s
claret, but embodiments of all that brave, ample
spirit of free camarm/erii which was the life and
soul of Victorian Volunteerisin before the pro-
vince took to importing hee-haws and gold-lace
with her squill anus that catch, and monster-guns
that hurst. Good fellows they were—here and
there a weak spot, perhaps—but, taken all in all,
men fitly chosen to officer companies composed of
tlie essence of those adventurous souls who made
up that glorious inrush into Victoria of the Fifties
and Sixties.
Ah! where are they now? Some survive and
some have gone. Better perhaps for some had the
tide of war, which sometimes seemed so near with
its bloody crest, and yet was always s t far, dashed
upon the virgin Australian beach and swept them
away in its withdrawal. For the ping of a shame-
ful bullet let tlie life out of ’s brain, and the
grim portals of IVntridge closed upon . Others
went to honoured graves, and the triple volleys
have rolled over Stubbs, and Bambers, and
Ashley, after the Masons had dropped on coffin-
lids their evergreens and lambskins. Some have
gone, and others survive—two or three on “re-
tired ” rank to rest—others, alas ! into politics -
one to land-booming, another to save the wreckage
of the boom, and a third—saddest fate of all!—to
become an Agent-General.

As the great pedestal clock—a legacy from the
old 14th (2nd)—“ the rowdiest, most disreputable
battalion that ever disgraced us with their pre-
sence in our midst,” said the loyal Argus—rang
out six o’clock there was a change in the hearty,
laughterful noise.
The Military Secretary rose and drew his belt
in. “ Sorry, gentlemen, I’ve to leave you, but
his voice dropped a tone—“l always dine with
the—the—Colonel—on Saturday nights. But call
for what you want, gentlemen !”
There was a clatter of scabbards on the floor
and a clash of glasses on the table as the officers
rose. Than those noises not a sound; scarcely a
breathing, for, perhaps, a half-minute. Then—
“I give the Colonel-the dear old Colonel,
comrades !” cried Draven.
The Colonel-Coin maud ant, gentlemen!” .Stubbs
repeated.
“ The Colonel-Commandant !“ they said one by
one, as the glasses went up to lips—slowly. It
was curious how slowly !
W him the glasses were down, the Military
Secretary spoke again. They had looked one at
another and all at him, and he answered the
looks.
“Yes, gentlemen-comrades-let us - let us—
give him musical honours ! It may be ri'l be —
the lust t me !”
Then they looked at Balkan, of the ©oilingwood.
Balkan was a singing-master. Often and often
had his full baritone sot the key fur camp song
and mess-room chorus.
But the devil was in the wine or something.
No public-school youngster had ever been rapped
over tlie head by Pallan's baton for emitting a
falser, wretcheder note than that which now
whistled, gasped, struggled through Pallan’s own
lips. The officers would have roared with laughter
if they had not been so near—the other tiling.
Then Softgoode tried. He was a member of a
Congregational Church choir, and it was scarcely
cor ect conduct in him to strike up a drinking-
chorus, though joining in one might be permis-
sible. He tried twice, and the third time a bass
and a tenor helped him with the repetition of—
For he’s a jolly good fellow !
while a voice t hat was not classifiable nor recognis-
able, so strident was it, joined at the—
And so say all of us !
As for the others, they were silent. Three or
four Ivad turned their faces to the wall at the poor,
piteous attempt to add the musical honours to the
toast, and, one stared vacantly in the eyes of
Captain Stubbs’s servant. The vocal salute was a
failure.
But their Commandant should not be deprived
of some honour with the toast.
“ Comrades ! ” murmured Stubbs : “ wo can't
sing ! But—there I ” He snapped his wine-glass,
and threw stem and bowl on the table, where they
shattered.
One by one the others followed his example.
As the last cup shivered into atoms, Ashley, of
the Richmond, said, hoarsely: “Good God !
What a health-drinking ! ”
“ Health ! We’d have drunk to his health only
"’hen we’d drunk to his death!” responded
Draven.
For the Colonel was dying a death that appalled
even these strong men.
* * #
Without word of command, without, in-
deed, any word, but moved by mute impulse and
a spontaneous regard, the officers tightened their
belts, replaced shakos and busbies, and formed
into line. The junior subaltern was nearest the
door opening into the men’s dormitory overlooking
St. Kilda Road. The shadow of tlie huge blue-
stone buildings, thrown by the refulgence of a sun
that was setting in an aureole of magnificence, lay
pall-like on the ground.
“Right-face—march.” Stubbs, by virtue of his
Imperial rank, gave the order, and, through the
dormitory the eighteen or twenty officers filed.
At the outer lintel they formed into twos, and
by twos they passed out—into the shadow. The
brilliant gleams of the lowering sun fell upon
them gloriously when they had emerged from the
gloominess, and drew a thousand sparkles from
belt-buckles and sword-knots, and steely scab-
bards. More than one of that small company saw
an a’legory in that brief passage from shade into
light,
Twenty minutes their march lasted. It was too
long for some; too short for others. These last
were fearful as they drew near their destination.
There are moments when even a soldier may not
improperly indulge in a feeling of dread. Still,
none fell < ut, and when their tramp ceased at the
bronzed gates in the quiet suburban street and
their scabbards fell for a moment at Stubbs’s
“Halt!” tire wondering people who had been
drawn by the approach of command-less officers,
to verandahs and balconies, were not excited t >
greater wonderment by seeing some remain whilst
otlu rs went away.
# # #
Captain Stubbs alone passed into the gar-
den of the Commandant’s cottage, nor did he
return fur several minutes.
“He will receive you, gentlemen—comrades. If
;iou can bear it, he says he can!” This was the
Military Secretary's message.
“What soy you, gentlemen?” Stubbs ques-
tioned, after a moment’s pause. “Shall you
venture; ?’’
Major Draven answered for his comrades.
“ We are here, sir.”
Captain Stubbs Hung the broad carriage gates
open.
“ Then—forward. By seniors, march!” And,
placing himself at their head, he set the pace.
No one knew how it w-as—none could explain
when, in after days, they talked the incident over
among themselves— but the step he gave them was
that slowest of slow marches which is the fitting
movement of the escort of the dead.
Along gravelled paths, between close-clipped
box-edgings and beds of homely flowers breathing
scents to the balmy air, up stately steps to a
statelier verandah where clustered ferns and
dwarf-pines, and there, again, they paused, form-
ing once more into rank.
“1 should tell you, comrades, that our Colonel
is—in—a darkened room.”
“ We understand,” said Draven.
“No, you do not.”
“ It is quite dark— the least ray of light—natural
or artificial—the flicker of a luoifer-match even, will
cause intense pain—perhaps death. Therefore, I
pray you, be careful. You cannot see him.”
A shudder ran through the rank and the thought
of all was spoken then by one.
“ Then had we not better go away—now ?”
“No, if you can’t sec him, you can speak to
him—so.” He uttered a word, distinctly but in
alow tone. “Not above that!” he went on.
“His hearing is as sensitive to sound as his sight
to light.”
“ But what’s the use ? ”, queried Draven. “ We
can’t see him—we can’t salute him - he will not
know our voices ”
“As you pass beneath the inner curtain,”
Stubbs resumed, “halt. Then utter your name
in a low voice, take three paces, halt again, front,
salute —as quietly as possible, don’t let your arms
jingle—then put out your hand—and you will,
perhaps, after a second’s groping, meet his. Only
a touch, mind you—for your own sakes! —then
return. You understand, gentlemen, all!”
“Yes!” came from some lips. Most were
silent.
‘ * Quietly—and three paces, remember ! By
seniors, now, please. Major Draven, this way !”
From the verandah into a hall, through the
hall where tearful-eyed ladies were grouped,
proud, though, in that terrible moment that their
relative, their hero, should still retain his place in
the hearts of his officers, passed, one by one, the

men who had come to do honour to their old
chief. Through the hall, and through a suite of
rooms till the Military Secretary stopped each in
his turn by a curtained doorway.
“ Let fchls curtain fall—open the door—close it
-then pass under the inner curtain.”
And, one by one, they went in,
# * #
_~~.,. . . , . ,
Inside that room, dark as the tomb which its
tenant was so soon to occupy, each officer obeyed
the Military Secretary’s command to the letter,
But the three paces, each confessed afterwards,
were not the firm tread of soldiers, but of feeble
beings horror-stricken as by a stab from the
Unknown.
And this man, isolated in a room which, of
narrow dimensions, was to him a wilderness of
wof, received them with an unstmtedmanhness.

And so on to the junior Lieutenant of the
Southern. io each a simple intense word of
thanks—a momentary touch of the backs of fingers
-but no pressure of palms, for the palm that
should have stretched from the centre of the
apartment, alas ! was not.
To Draven, to Ashley, to another, beyond the
word of thanks there was a muttered inquiry as
to the affairs of their common Masonic Lodge.
“ How is my—old—lodge? Is it well with the
—brethren? Remember me to them all!” And
that he was not forgotten, the minutes of the
next ensuing N. and M. Lodge, No. 1116, E.C.,
testify.
They had all passed into the room to the
youngest subaltern, and had formed once on the
verandah, when a whim seized upon the dying
roan .
“I will see them, Stubbs! Ask them to form
here—the room will hold them all!”
“It will be madness, sir—death !” remonstrated
Stubbs.
“Well, if so, what matter? I’ve borne the
battle long enough—l have faced the enemy—l.
am not deserting my post in taking one step to
meet the relief. Ask them, Stubbs, ask them to
favour their old Colonel again. I crave to look
unon the uniforms once more !”
And though his women, also, prayed him not, he
would have it so. '
They filed in again, noiselessly. The room was
still darkened. But a woman's hand, with in-
stinctive power to do the right thing at the right
moment, drew back the trebly-folded curtains
which shrouded the window, sufficiently to permit
one tiny dart of rose-red splendour to pierce the
rift and send a wavering, quivering line along the
grouped scarlets and deep-blues.
The men m the uniforms saw in the sequence of
that flash that which they never forgot. The tall,
stalwartness of the figure they had once known
was burdened with the decrepitude and the agony
of an awful torture, and the features, which had
once inspired them by its quickening revelations
of a soldier’s soul, masked. Two lurid coals burnt
in the eye-spaces.
The lower part of the mask dropped and the
dying man said: “Wife, more light! I can
bea r ifc ;” ...
Slowly the curtains widened—the grudged light
streamed in boldier and with brighter vividness—
the buttons and the silver-lace glistened like
diamond facets. From a hundred points the rays
of the setting sun were reflected in undimmed
lustre as though they were sudden shafts of an
aurora penetrating Cimmerian night. The hand
which was palmless went up suddenly to the burn-
ing eye-balls,
“ Wife, wife !” shrieked the mask, “ the curtain
—quick—l cannot bear it, I cannot bear it!”
* # »
That night one of the officers told in his
family circle the sad episode of the day; and his son
thoughtover the narrative on thefollowingmorning
when, as was his wont in the early hours of Sun-
day forenoons, he strolled through Studley Park
to take a dip in the Yarra and to enjoy a yarn
with a chum who, by a coincidence, happened
also to be a son of one of the officers who had
shown honour to their colonel on the occasion of
his last levee.
The youths had taken their plunge from the
rocky steps overshadowed by the Victoria-street
bridge, and were preparing for the walk home,
when an old gentleman, grey-headed, fresh-faced,
white-costumed, straw-hatted, who had strolled
down to the bank apparently with the intention
of permitting a water-spaniel to disport himself,
was attracted by their conversation.
“Pop,” said the first lad, “did your governor
tell you of his visit to Colonel ’s yesterday ?”
“Yes, by George, wasn’t that funny?”
“Funny!” exclaimed the other. “It is the
most awful thing I ever heard of. I don’t see
where the fun came in. To think of fine old
Colonel dying in that terrible fashion.”
“What! What! Did you say that Colonel
was dying ? ” The boys turned in amazement, and
then understood that it was the old gentleman
who had interrupted them.
Wonderingly they replied. The lad who had
first spoken answered, “Yes, sir, we believe so !”
“Why, what makes you think so ? ” The flush
had gone out of the old man’s face, and a curious,
anxious expression replaced the things-go-very-
well-with-me aspect it had before worn.
“Did you know him, sir?” replied the boy,
with a degree of caution.
“ Yes, yes, / know him ! Of course—knew him
very well indeed. Don’t keep me in suspense,
boy, tell me ! ” .
“ I don’t think we ought to tell you, sir,” said
the second lad, even more discreet than his com-
panion, “ anything beyond the simple fact that we
believe he is dying.”
“Why, why, what is there beyond it? What
do you mean by saying it was awful—why can’t
you tell me?"
“Well, sir—we don’t know you, aiM what we
were speaking of we had heard in our homes. Our
fathers know the Colonel and each other ”
“ My lads, I know the Colonel too, better than
anybody does in this country. Nobody can know
him better—or owe him more than I do.” He
grew more excited as he spoke. “Look here, I’ll
give you half-a-sovereign apiece if you will tell
me—l must know, for the Colonel—one time
saved my life.” He stopped and shuddered, and
the moisture that wells from the spring of horrible
memories was as dew upon his forehead. “Yes,
yes, he saved my life ! Oh, tell me, is that good
man dying—and how ? ”
Not for the sake of the half-sovereigns (though
they were forthcoming at a later hour), but because
of the old gentleman’s evident distress and
anxiety, the youths repeated substantially what
they had heard ; and to their shocked surprise the
old man threw himself, or rather fell, reckless of
the neat purity of his attire, on the ground,
“ Oh, then, it has come true, then—it has come
true ! ”
It was the boys’ turn now to inquire :
“What has come true, sir?”
The only answer he could make, however, for
some minutes, and then only in muffled tones, for
his head was bowed upon his hands, was—“ Forty
year ago he said it, and forty year ago- .”
Then, he rose seemingly more aged by ten years
than he was when the boys first saw him.
* * *
Nothing more could the boys then learn
from him, but he desired them to introduce him
to their fathers.
“Major Hokes, of the ‘Kew and Hawthorne ’ —
I know him !” he said, when he had learnt the
name of the second lad. “Do me the favour,
boys, to go with me at once,” and the lads
returned homewards with this strange companion,
who muttered to himself distractedly as he went.
“Hokes, of the Kew and Hawthorn,” and the
other boy’s father, were encountered, and the three
seniors almost at once drew away, in earnest con-
versation, from the youths. The boys could not
make it out at all, and their wonderment became
the deeper when they heard their respective
parents make an appointment with the old gentle-
man for that afternoon in order to accompany him
to the dying Colonel’s residence.
* * #
Dying? They found him—dead. That last
shaft of light had pierced to the brain, and a brief
space only of unutterable, fathomless agony had
intervened after the withdrawal of the officers
before the Colonel-Commandant had ceased to
breathe.
The. mourning household at first refused to
grant permission to the old man to see all that
remained of the dead soldier. Had it not been,
indeed, for the earnest solicitations of the two
officers, personal friends of the Colonel, he would
have been refused.
But, at last, the ladies consented, and drawing
hard breaths and stumbling with an almost
palsied gait, the singular visitant was shown into
the room where the corpse lay. The officers ac-
companied him and moved, a few inches,
reverently, the polished-oak lid aside. The man
bent down. With great tears rolling down his
cheeks he kissed the sunken eyelids which were
(in their dreadful sightlestness) through
the orifices of the mask. So fearful had been the
death, so awful the ravages of the torture of his
later life, that the dead man’s face was not to
know in his coffin that sweet perfection of colour
which leaves so many faces in the cradle to bloom
once again in the coffin. There was no “last
look ” of stately, refined features to be enshrined
by his dear ones in the sacred chambers of reminis-
cence. They dare not remember the last!
The old man stooped, we say, to kiss the eye-
lids, and then, drawing himself up, he pulled from
an inner pocket a sheet of blue paper. It was a
half-sheet with faded lines of script running
across it, under a printed heading. He spoke
again.
Holding the paper in the gaze of the officers*—
“ Look, gentlemen ! This is what that man lying
there won for me. Read it! ”
One, scarcely knowing what he did, read it to
the other as follows :

see, and we used to go fishin’ to Philip Island

when he saved my life —and I don’t think I’ve

Then
“ Gentlemen, move the lid a little lower, please.
Let me place this in his hand—he won’t need any
passport to Heaven, but this might serve if he
did.”
The officers did as he requested. The gaunt
boniness of one hand, the left, showed through
the pipe-clayed glove. The other, too, was gloved,
but it was shapeless. The man slipped the paper
under the right hand.
“It was the right hand,” he said, “which
Whelan held when .”
“ When ?”
“When the boy—this great man that lies here
—brought me that paper to the condemned cell
where I was lying chained to Flash Whelan.
Whelan, who had led the rebellion, took hold of
his hand with his. “Give me your hand, Master
—’ter think as yer saved little Tommy’s life,

and when Whelan grasped it in his, he said,
changing his voice, “May yer flesh drop of yer
bit by bit, for a-savin’ of his life, an’ not mine !’ (
“ That was forty year ago—and the curse has
been fulfilled.”

When in Darlinghurst, Frank Gardiner
told the yarn that, ere his party stuck-up the gold-
escort, it was arranged that every man should fire
in the air to frighten the occupants of the coach.
One of the gang, however, did not fire, and later
on, when they were riding through the bush, his
gun.went off accidentally, putting a bullet through
Gardiner’s leg, after which little episode Gardiner
always made the man ride in front. The fellow’s
idea in retaining his fire was, no doubt, to show
in the event of capture, that he had not fired a
shot.

Was it Murder?
(SPECIAL “BULLETIN” TRANSLATION.)
It was a sensational case. The old mem-
bers of the bar down there still talk of the stir
the affair made through the district.
It was at Aix, in Provence, a year or two after
the Crimean war. An enormous crowd, worked
to a high pitch of expectation by the strange,
mysterious features of the trial, had taken posses-
sion of the hall of justice.
# # *
The counsel for the defendant was called
upon.
He rose from his seat, grave, majestic, with his
black robe and cap, prepared to let loose the flood
of his commonplaces, conscious of being the mark
of all those eyes, enjoying in anticipation, not an
acquittal—that mattered little to him—but his
success as a celebrated criminal advocate.
The prisoner quietly made a sign that she wished
to speak.
The advocate, with a gesture of annoyed con-
sent, and a few words murmured to his client in
a low voice, sat down, and buried his face again
in Ids papers and musty books, as if to avoid
hearing what—much against his will and advice —
she was about to say.
Tall, dark, her shapely form showing beneath
the long mourning dress, the lifted widow’s veil
displaying her melancholy eyes, with their dark
rings,' and her hollow cheeks, waxy pale from the
long confinement, she must once have been very
beautiful. But, to tell the truth, she encountered
little sympathy. Public opinion was even
definitely hostile to her—especially amongst tlie
women.
She spoke :
* * *
“ You have heard, gentlemen, the indict-
ment and the crime with which it charges me. I
do not deny it. The facts set forth in it are true,
perfectly true. You have heard the witnesses,
both those called to support the accusation—whose
evidence I do not dispute—and those whom the
gentleman defending me has chosen to call —much
against my wish, I assure you—to testify to my
character, which is not in question. You have
heard, too, what the public prosecutor has said to
establish my guilt and make more certain of my
conviction, I have nothing to say either against
the indictment, or against the witnesses for the
prosecution, or against the address of the public
prosecutor. The murder is a clear one, which,
from the moment of committing it, I have
neither sought to deny nor to extenuate. The
reason why 1 now interrupt my honourable counsel
—and I sincerely beg his pardon for doing so—
is that there is one thing which I fear. He may
seek to mislead your minds by representing my
crime in unreal colours, surrounded by circum-
stances foreign to the case, and perhaps by
endeavouring to suggest motives very different
from those which really actuated me.
“ Yes, I did kill Jean Reynier, my husband ! I
killed him with premeditation ! Why ? Because
I loved him.
# # #
“As a girl I was poor. My family,
respectable middle-class people in a humble posi-
tion, stinted themselves to give me the best edu-
cation that was open for a woman. When, on
entering womanhood, I was left alone by my
parents’ death, my education had made me strong
for the struggle—as strong as a girl could be at
20. I turned to teaching to earn my living. My
independence I never yielded, not even, like other
women, the day I took a husband—a husband,
not a master 1 I married because I loved that
man.
“ When I met him he was a non-commissioned
officer of dragoons, a fine man, young, without
much education, and of a very ordinary type of
intelligence. Intellectually—l say it without any
false modesty—he was my antithesis. But, cradled
in literature and art though I was, I had never
given way to those dreams of childish romance,
of fanciful loves—all the false, affected sentimen-
talism that usually fills the heads of young girls
and makes them expect their future husbands to
be languishing puppets only fit for fairy-tales. By
temperament I have always been virtuous. Ido
not say that boastfully; it is my nature—l would
never have yielded to a man who was not my hus-
band. But I wished for a husband who should be
physically a true male, and mentally a being
whose mind would submit to the ascendancy of
my own.
“I found such a man in Jean Reynier; I loved
him, and I married him.
“About a year after our marriage he left me to
go to the war; his regiment was ordered to the
Crimea.
* * #
“I pause here to say one thing. It has
nothing to do with the matter of the trial, and
the prosecution has said nothing about it; but it
may find its way into private comments on my
case. I speak of it with great reluctance, but I
must state, simply and without any thought of
self-praise, that I have always been faithful —in
the moral sense as well as the physical sense of the
word—to the man I had chosen for my husband.
After my marriage I never thought of another ‘
man, either when we were living together, or
during his absence, or after his return. That
return — ! Well, now I will tell the whole story.”
For an instant she paused, deeply moved.
There was a stir in the crowd, still far from sym-
pathetic, while a momentary smile, half sceptical,
passed along the bench in front, where sat the
twelve jurymen. The Judge was impassive; he
might have been asleep. Below the accused the
celebrated advocate, his elbows on the desk, his
chin resting on his thumbs, shrugged his shoulders
and thought of his fine periods ruined. What did
she want to speak for? Where would she land
herself with all this futile talk ? God knew what
folly she was going to commit next! Clearly the
woman was mad ; and directly, if she would let
him speak at all he was very much inclined to
plead insanity.
She went on:
* * *
“In a cavalry charge at the battle of
Alma lie had both legs shattered by a shell, and
was left for dead amongst a heap of slain.
“As they were on the point of burying him
with the others, the surgeon-major, who was
examining each body before it was laid in the
great trench dug for the purpose, fancied he de-
tected some signs of life in the non-commissioned
officer of dragoons, and ordered him to be carried
to the hospital. There it was found necessary to
amputate both legs. The operation was success-
ful, and Jean Reynier, alas ! did not die. He re-
turned to France with a medal and a little pen-
sion, We resumed our life together. I thought
that love, the sentiment of duty, of natural pity,
would enable me to live with the unfortunate man
and alleviate, as far as possible, his lot.
“ But the ex-dragoon, formerly so proud of his
masculine beauty and his superb horsemanship,
had now but one thought, bitter and full of brood-
ing despair—rthat he should have become so
pitiable an object, inspiring a sort of horror; a
miserable cripple ! To be reduced to crawl about,
dragging painfully over the ground his mutilated
trunk, where once on review days, in his brilliant
uniform, mounted on a prancing steed, he had
been the admiration of the crowd !
“Neither my devotion, alas 1 nor my tenderness
could mitigate his horrible destiny. And I
thought that for him it would be sweeter to die.
“ I premeditated his death ; yes, gentlemen, in
that the prosecution are right. One night in bed ”
—the accused grew crimson and seemed to shiver
“in. the darkness, his breast, just where the
heart is, metjthe point of a knife, which sank in,
with a jet of warm blood that inundated me. I
rose shuddering with horror.
“My courage had not failed me; I had com-
mitted a murder that in my eyes was the accom-
plishment of a holy duty. But oh! that terrible
moment, when my hand moved under the pillow
in search of the liberating weapon, whose haft
was pressed against my right breast as I slew
him !
“ I was strong and resolute to strike, but it was
that my hand should not tremble, and that I
should not make him suffer ; for I loved him so !
“ Before the law, perhaps, it was murder. In
my eyes it was deliverance that I brought him.
In any case, my conscience acquits me. Without
fear, then, gentlemen, I await your verdict! ’
* # #
The twelve respectable citizens in the
jury-box did not see the matter in that light. The
prisoner died on the scaffold.
JULIEN MAUVRAC.
THEY ROLLED ON THE FLOOR.
On Monday, November 24th, 1890, the American
papers published the following news item :
“Mrs. Sarah S. Heusler, of No. 873, East One-
Hundred-and-Thirty-fourth-street, New York,
shot and killed herself yesterday morning. She
wasi a, lady of excellent character and high social
position, and a member of the Rev. Dr. Ramsay’s
Presbyterian Church. She was well-to-do and
very active in various public and private charities.
Since last July she had suffered fearfully from
indigestion and dyspepsia, which brought on
melancholia, and then a kind of insanity, under
the influence of which she took her own life.”
Her e is another stoiy, not so tragical, but with
the same moral. The narrator tells it of himself.
“Mostly,” he says, “we dread and fear death,-
yet once I prayed to die, and the reason was in
this wise. I pto Christmas, 1888, I had been a
healthy man, but at that time (a period of rejoicing
with so many) I felt depressed, languid, and tired.
My appetite left me, and I was much distressed
after eating the lightest food. My skin and eyes
became tinged with a dark yellow colour, and the
kidney secretion was like blood. The pain in my
stomach was almost unbearable and often lasted
from 12 to 14 hours without intermission. Some-
times I was in pain night and day, and was so bad
that my wife had to sit up with me through the
night. I was constantly sick, and troubled with
a stomach cough, and expectorated a quantity of
green phlegm.
“In spite of warm clothing and every comfort,
I was always chilled ; the cold shivers running
through me as if my blood were thin and poor. I
could take no solid food ; I 'lived on soups, milk,
puddings, &c., and after each meal I had empty,
gnawing, windy pains at the stomach, which
nothing relieved.
“ After a time an intolerable itching of the skin
spread all over me, as if my blood were poisoned.
Our family physician attended me for about a
year. Acting upon his advice I went to Harro-
gate, where I consulted another doctor, and drank
the waters, but feeling worse I returned home.
The bath attendant at Harrogate and others told
me I was suffering from blood poisoning, but this
the doctors never mentioned. The first doctor
said it was the passing of gallstones that gave me
such dreadful pain.
“ I now consulted an eminent specialist at Man-
chester, who confirmed what the other doctor had
told me, but none of them afforded me any relief.
“ In this miserable way I dragged on for six
months more, and became so much reduced I
could scarcely put one foot before the other, and
so thin that the rings fell off my lingers and rolled
on the floor. I was in such pain that I prayed to
die. and one of the doctors told a friend of mine I
could not recover.
“In August of last year (1890), whilst my suffer-
ings were at the worst, a book was sent to me by
post, telling of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s
•Curative Syrup. I determined to try it, and sent
to Mr. Evans, Chemist, Lymm, for a supply.
After taking the first bottle, I felt a little better,
and by persevering with the remedy I recovered
my appetite, and gradually gained strength. My
natural colour is now returned, and I feel as well
as I ever did in my life ; in fact, as well as I did
when a boy. I can eat any kind of food without
inconvenience, and have gained 30 pounds in
weight during the past three months. I may add
that previous to taking this medicine I was so
much altered that my friends, and even my pupils,
scarcely recognised me. I tell every one what
Seigel’s Syrup did for me. ”
The gentleman who makes the foregoing state-
ment is a person of position and known to all the
people of Lymm. He declines to permit the publi-
cation of his name, but the perfect truth of what
is here related is vouched for by Mr. J. H. Evans,
the chemist above named.
The case was an aggravated one of indigestion
and dyspepsia and its natural consequence. The
whole system had been poisoned and disordered by
the acids engendered by the fermentation in the
stomach, and, had not Seigel’s Syrup come to the
rescue just as it did a fatal result must have
followed in a brief time.

The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance
Society (Limited).
W have m our hands a small pamphlet relating
to the above society, which, in the first place,
attracts notice on account of its novelty. The
pamphlet consists of a series of extracts from
opinions of the British press relating to the last
Annual Report of the Colonial Mutual Life Assur-
ance Society, which have been typewritten and
then photo-lithographed. The issue has been
very neatly got up, but if one is attracted at first
by the novelty of the appearance of the pamphlet,
on looking into the contents, one’s attention is
still more attracted by the facts referred to in con-
nection with this progressive society.
The Financial Standard, of 20th June, 1891,
speaks as follows -
1 here are few, if any, offices that can show a
record of in ore rapid growth than the Colonial
Mutual. Fstablished in 1874, this office has risen, so
to speak, by leaps and bounds, and can now, in its
eighteenth year, show an account which would be
worthy of any of its century-old competitors.
What is perhaps one of the most pleasing
features in this office is that, notwithstanding the
continued increase of the business, the ratio of
expenditure to income shows a very considerable
reduction.”
I'rom the Insurance World and Monetary
Record, dated 24th June, 1891, the following
extract has been copied into the pamphlet :
1 he report presented at the recent meeting of
this prosperous and ably-handled Society, shows
no sign of slackening in the rate of progress, as
the new business of 1890 is in excess of that
recorded in any previous year, while a distinct
reduction has been effected in the expense ratio,
and a large addition made to the accumulated
funds, which now amount to upwards of
£1,200,000.
“ Notably good points in the report for 1890 are
toe reduction in the expense ratio, and the
splendid earnings of the invested funds. !>
Ihe above references give a glimmering of the
enormous size to which The Colonial Mutual Life
Assurance Society has grown in the comparatively
few years since it was started. On referring
to the report of proceedings at the last annual
meeting of the members, we find that the funds of
the Society exceed £1,200,000, and that at the
date of the meeting, the Policies in force in the*
Colonial Mutual amounted to over £10,000,000,
whilst the annual income at that date exceeded
£400,000. Figures like these make one wonder
how such an immense business could have
been accumulated in so short a time. We
do not know of any other Life Assur-
ance Society in the colonies of the United
Kingdom which has in the first 17 or 18 years of
its existence accumulated anything like so large a
business. This fact in itself is the strongest
possible evidence of the vigour with which the
business has been pushed, and the chairman’s
speech at the meeting referred to shows that the
vigour in pushing the business has not been at
the expense of permanence of character, for he
announced that, notwithstanding death claims and
discontinuances of all kinds, the Society had on
its books at that date no less than fiO per cent, of
the total amount of business that had been placed
on the books since the commencement. Those
who ate acquainted with the figures of Life
Assurance Offices generally, will know that such a
percentage is a most favourable one and speaks
volumes for the soundness of the business.
_ During the year 1890 the Policy Holders of The
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society had
alloted to them the Bonuses resulting from the
profits made during the previous Quinquennium.
Ihe profits for this period were equivalent in
reversionary Bonuses to a sum exceeding £300,000,
being just about three times as much
as the Bonuses added to Policies at the
previous investigation. This, taken in con-
junction with the figures mentioned above,
will show at what a rapid rate the Society
is progressing. As our readers are aware, it is
the only Colonial Society that has extended its
business beyond the Australasian Colonies, and
one only has to read the Insurance Press of Great
Britain to see how favourably the Colonial Mutual
is regarded there, and what a satisfactory business
it is
Colonial Office to establish itself in the midst of
so many old-establ.shed British Life Offices, and
many may have thought that the step was too
bold a one, but the extension, like all others made
by the Colonial Mutual, has proved completely
successful, and the Society has been warmly wel-
comed by the offices in the Old Country for its
vigorous and straightforward way of doing busi-
ness and for the lines on which the Directors and
Management conduct it.

The Kaffir, according to one Colonel
Knollys, smokes with the lighted end of the cigar

As Long as Your Eyes are Blue.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Wilt tiiou love me, .sweet,-when my hair is grey
And my cheeks shall have lost their hue ? *
When the charms of youth shall have passed
away,
Will your love as of old prove true?
For the looks may change, and the heart may
range, i
And the love he no longer fond ;
Wilt thou love with truth in the years of youth
And away to the years beyond ?
Oh, I love you, sweet, for your locks of brown
And the blush on your cheek that lies—
But I love you most for the kindly heart
That I see in your sweet blue eyes—
-I'or the eyes are signs of the soul within,
Of the heart that is leal and true,
And mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,
Just as long as your eyes are blue.
For the locks may bleach, and the cheeks of peach
May be reft of their golden hue ;
But mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,
Just as long as your eyes are blue.
