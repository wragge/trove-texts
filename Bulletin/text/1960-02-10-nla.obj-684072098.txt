THE AVANT-GARDE THEN
The Banquet Years, by Roger
Shattuck (Faber), are the years 1885
to 1914 in Paris when, it seems to
the American author, the salon de-
clined and vulgar display, cafe society
and the demi-monde took over, and
large banquets became “the supreme
rite.” But this is merely a device to
hook together four long essays on
Henri Rousseau, Alfred Jarry, Erik
Satie and Guillaume Apollinaire, who
belonged to these times as artists of
quality generally belong to their times
—i.e., in opposition to them: certainly
the wild party Picasso organised for
Rousseau was anything but one of the
starched-shirtfront functions of the
time; and the celebrations Shattuck
assigns his other subjects are even more
far-fetched.
Few readers have not heard of “The
Douanier” Rousseau, the ex-Customs-
collector, who retired at 41 to teach a
little music and do a lot of painting—
large jungle pictures, desert scenes and
Parisian landscapes, with a technique
which still puzzles the experts: did he
paint like a child or Grandma Moses
because he was naive, or because he
was clever?
Rousseau collected and read atten-
tively everything that was written
about him, and it is remotely pos-
sible that the early articles on his
“primitive” manner helped produce
the singular arrest at that stage....
it is doing him no injustice to pro-
pose that he may have unconsciously
understood that there were qualities
in his work quite different from the
traditional execution he admired....
Shattuck shows him accepting as his
due invitations sent to him in hoax
to dine with the President, etc.; and,
until 1905, when he began to be
accepted in exhibitions with Matisse,
Derain. Braque, Rouault, Vlaminck
and Dufy, bearing patiently, assured of
his genius, the ridicule poured on him.
Like a great many saints, simple and
innocent, he could be a hellion when
crossed:
“Rousseau could sometimes be as
conceited and disagreeable as any-
one...,” “His face turned purple
the minute he was thwarted or
bothered....”
The study of Alfred Jarry. play-
wright and novelist, brings a less-
known eccentric to light: his master-
piece was a play about Pere Übu.
rewritten from a schoolboy sketch at
the expense of his teacher; it opened
with the hero “in a voice like a
hammer” pronouncing one four-letter
word (in 1896) which threw the house
into pandemonium for 15 minutes: —
Pere Übu murdered his way to
the throne of Poland, pillaged the
country, was defeated by the king’s
son aided by the czar’s army, and
fled cravenly to France, where he
promised to perpetrate further
enormities on the population.
The story of “Übu Roi” is no more
than this. Pere Übu and Mere Übu
use language more scatological than
erotic....
Catulle Mendes, poet and critic, wrote
of “an enormous parody of Macbeth
and Napoleon, a flunky become king,”
who “nevertheless exists unforgettably.”
The play ran two nights, and made
Jarry’s reputation. It also made Jarry;
from then onwards he became the
“savage god” he had created: —
In conversation he adopted a
periphrastic style, after Homer: the
wind became “that which blows”
and a bird “that which chirps.” The
lofty role of King Ooboo required
that he assume the royal “we” and a
pompous ceremoniousness. The result
was a new form of speech, which
still flourishes in Parisian literary
quarters, a coarse inverted precious-
ness called le parler Übu.
Jarry dressed as a “bicycle racer”;
about sft. tall himself, he lived in a
building whose rooms, considered too
tall by the owner, had been halved
horizontally; to this Jarry added a bed
almost on the floor and a writing-table
to which he had to lie flat; and his
portrait by Rousseau had also been
“reduced” by burning all but the head
away: “it was said that the only food
that could be eaten conveniently in the
place was flounder.”
He carried revolvers, which he could
use pretty well, in his belt, gave
banquets in an old stable, tried to have
himself built a medieval dungeon, and
took to drinking ether, “deliberately,”
says Shattuck, “killing himself.”
Apollinaire, the illegitimate son of
a high-born Polish woman and a
wealthy Swiss, is considered by Shat-
tuck one of France’s finest lyric poets
of this century; he was a powerful
avant-garde art-critic, and Marie
Laurencin’s lover; a huge man and a
cheerful soldier, he survived a bad
head-wound in the trenches to die of
pneumonic influenza in 1919. But the
study of Apollinaire is slight beside
that of Erik Satie, at once the most
thorough and intriguing in the book:—
The wonder of Satie’s 59 years is
that he contrived to live two com-
plete careers: he was twice a com-
poser. During the closing years of
the century he attained notoriety
as an extravagant Montmartre
bohemian, watched his best friend,
Claude Debussy, begin a success-
ful career, helped his first protege,
Maurice Ravel.,. . and himself com-
posed a motley collection of works
whose innovations were generally
passed off as eccentricities. Sud-
denly, in 1898, he bowed 0ut....
Twelve years later, at the age of
48, Satie was rediscovered, dubbed a
precursor... .drawn back into circu-
lation by Debussy and Ravel.
Characteristically, he proceeded to
confound everyone by composing
works in a totally new style and
fiercely refused to rest on his first
and acknowledged career.
His 12-year silence he spent playing
the piano for a crust in Monmartre
cafes and composing popular Songs;
his music is more famous in reputation
for its sarcastic directions to the
player; with Milhaud, he invented
“furniture music”;—
When the audience began getting
up for the break, a piano and three
clarinets, placed in the four corners
of the room, plus a trombone on
the mezzanine, struck up what
sounded like popular ditties played
over and over again in close
rhythmical patterns. The audience
began to take seats again. Satie
rushed around the gallery exhorting
them to appropriate behavior.
“Talk, keep on talking. And move
around. Whatever you do, don’t
listen.”
Shattuck makes a study, with musical
illustrations, of his symphonic play
“Socrate,” his ballet “Parade” (with
Cocteau, Picasso and Massine), which
had parts for typewriters, sirens, air-
plane propellers, Morse tickers and
lottery-wheels; and prints facsimiles
from his manuscript of “Sports et
Divertissements,” in which the fastidi-
ous calligraphy is matched by the
succinctness of the little pieces; one is
less than two staves of music.
A while ago the A.8.C.. to satisfy a
curious listener, had to import a record
of some of Satie’s piano music—it
sounded terse and unexpectedly clear;
maybe the years will disperse the fog
of buffoonery and scandalous side-
issues with which Satie deliberately
diverted attention from his work: what
one reads about him suggests a strength
and originality which is only biding its
time.

AUSTRALIA AND ASIA
r T'HE usual sneers at the White Aus-
tralia policy were a feature of the
Summer School of Political Science at
Canberra, a gathering at which
practical politicians are lectured as if
they are school-children by limelighters
and parlor-pinks, and particularly by
professors.
The exponent of Asianism was a
Mr. J. Wilkes, who desires that this
country should break its political ties
with the United Kingdom and the
United States and abandon the White
Australia policy.
He proposed that the thus-liberated
Commonwealth should then recognise
itself, in its rightful place, as part of
an Indian Ocean triangle with India
as the apex, Australia on one side and
Africa on the other.
Mr. Wilkes’s plan, of course,
envisages a complete change in the
racial set-up. From the Africans at
the moment not much would be
expected in the way of immigrants,
for they do not usually emigrate, and
have no need to emigrate, out of their
own continent. But in time, under the
influence of gentlemen like Nkrumah
and the emissaries of Moscow, they
would no doubt come round to the
decision that it would be their duty
to make Australia African, seeing that
the Australian aborigine has an affinity
with some African races.
By that time Soekarno might have
decided that Australia is really part
of Indonesia, like West New Guinea,
and the Chinese might be involved in
disputing possession of the continent
with all the rest except India, which,
as usual, would be allowing anybody
who cared to to walk over its docile
leader.
About the most dangerous concep-
tion of Australia’s place in the world
ever invented was that it is part of
South-east Asia, which it certainly is
not.
No South-east Asian country ever
laid claim to it. Many Chinese and
other navigators undoubtedly came
here through the centuries, but all
viewed it as something outside their
world. If communication has brought
it nearer in time than it was the
relative disparity in nearness of India
and Europe is so little as not to be
very noticeable.
In plain fact the association between
Japan and Australia is more regular
and copious, and the real distance by
air and sea from the more closely
populated parts of Australia shorter in
terms of time, than those which
separate us from Africa and India.
Yet nobody (and quite rightly) seems
anxious to suggest that Australia and
Japan are part and parcel of the same
regional community. And none of
the brilliant thinkers who envisage us
as part of Asia ever considers that if
the White Australia policy were
abandoned and Australia opened the
door to Asian and African immigra-
tion it would have as little chance of
controlling the direction of the inflow
as it would of controlling its nature.
TNDIANS, with their habits of gather-
A ing themselves into a tight, aggressive
phalanx and setting-out on the task
of economically immolating the other
inhabitants whose interests clash with
theirs, Japanese and Chinese, rushing
for space and for raw materials and
trade, would soon turn this continent
into a babel or a bedlam with Mr.
Wilkes’s descendants (renamed Ah
Wilkes) well down in the social order
and trampled into the mud.
The only argument in favor of the
theory that Australia is part of the
South-east Asia zone—a theory which
was invented by the Communists and
repeated dutifully as an echo by the
kind of politician and daily newspaper
which adopt anything that they hear
uttered in a loud voice—would be
proximity; and on that score, as has
been said, whether the separation is
looked at in terms of time or distance,
the claim is absurd.
Australia is as far from Singapore
as London is from Turkey and twice
as far as it is from Moscow; yet nobody
would ever include England in the
Russian zone or brigade its primary
interests with those of Turkey other
than in terms of world defence.
The Asian theory, of course, has
great beauty from the Communist
viewpoint. It would present Moscow
and Peking with ideal conditions for
pushing the world-revolution south-
ward through use of the cold-war
only.
It would isolate Australia from its
defensive alliances, remove its menace
as a certain flank-base attacking Com-
munist invasion of South-east Asia if
Khrushchev and Mao decided to over-
run the countries along the Indian
Ocean and Indonesia.
To have the Commonwealth linked
into the Asian area must ultimately
weaken the fibre of its population,
leave it isolated in an Asiatic sea in
short order, and generally achieve
military objectives which would
amount to bloodless Red conquest of
the territories of the Western Pacific
and Indian Ocean.
TT is a matter about which Aus-
tralians themselves are all too com-
placent and short on understanding.
The majority of natives of this country
appear to be wedded to the slogan
“It can’t happen here,” and they
find anything foreign a delightful
novelty and often treat Asiatic
students as if they were pets. Asians
are our neighbors, but they need to be
treated with all the consideration due
to friendly neighbors, not as part of
the family. Treating neighbors as part
of the family is only sometimes suc-
cessful at the childhood stage, and
almost never in the case of adults.
White Australia is based not on
belief in superiority of blood so much
as innate conviction, based on world
experience, of the danger of racial
admixtures, not only at the biological
level but at the political and economic.
It is difficult enough for people of one
race to pull together politically and
economically; a mixture of races,
especially with universal suffrage,
could be chaos.
Asian countries themselves, under
their new nationalism, are setting about
making sure that their own race
remains politically paramount under
their systems of government.
The great nations of today are those
which are racially unified the
northern Europeans, the Chinese and
Japanese, the Turks —these are all
dominant in their zones and going
forward without the problems that
beset even, say, the United States.
There is, of course, reason to fear
for the continuance of a White Aus-
tralia. As was pointed out in a New
State symposium on television a few
nights ago, only 500,000 people out of
our total of 10 million live above the
24th parallel, which passes through
the region not much more than 100
miles north of Brisbane in Queensland
and Shark Bay in Western Australia.
This condition of affairs cannot con-
tinue for very long in view of the
ballooning of populations in Indo-
nesia only a few hundred miles from
the Northern Territory coast.
Our safeguards at present are our
close links with the civilised West and
the fact that education has not reached
the point at which the great bulk of
Asiatics could tell you where Australia
is or what it is. Millions of them
have never even heard of the place.
Which is perhaps fortunate.


DROPPING THE PILOT


PLAIN ENGLISH
Rise of Western Leadership
Slowly but steadily the three great
countries of Western Europe seem to
have got themselves onto their feet, with
national leadership capable of bearing the
stresses of a critical international
situation.
Mr. Macmillan is consolidated in the
saddle, and wherever he has gone he has
improved the status of the United King-
dom and enhanced the reputation of
Britain.
His speech in the South African Union
Parliament at the end of his safari was
the first blunt declaration of policy by
a British leader on apartheid, and left
little to conjecture.
Generally, the effect of his speeches
has been to establish him as a leader of
policy in Africa, including Kenya, on
the affairs of which a conference was
in being in London during his absence,
and to concert and consolidate British
policy in a manner that can be under-
stood by Africans.
De Gaulle has established himself
equally with his neighbor across the
Channel. Two years ago it would have
seemed impossible that any French leader
could remain in office more than a few
months in the midst of the confusion
confounded by the intransigence of the
Communists. But today, with a new
Constitution of his own making, he is
the law, and whoever opposes him goes
out.
On January 29 in Algeria all was con-
fusion. The insurgents had full control
of the key city of Algiers. The most
sober observers could not see French and
territorial troops, in particular, firing on
the rebel crowds if called upon. When
it was discovered that de Gaulle was
hunting-out and arresting Right-wingers
bent on overthrowing him and his
Government in a dozen major French
cities, the largest rebel crowd to gather
in Algiers raised a throaty shout, such as
only Frenchmen can raise, of “De Gaulle
to the gallows.?’
But the next night de Gaulle spoke,
three days after he had tersely announced
that he “would not give way.” The
insurrection ended. The general strike in
Algiers came *to an end. Millions of*
Frenchmen stopped work to demonstrate
their backing for his order to the Army
and the nation to stand firm, and his
assurance that all crimes committed
against the State will be brought to jus-
tice. The rebels marched out of their
stronghold in surrender.
In Paris there was nothing left for
de Gaulle to do except discipline his
opponents, secure emergency powers
from a docile Assembly and weed-out the
weaklings in his Cabinet. All his moves
were made with sureness of touch and
a quiet virtuosity which placed him
among the great leaders of his time.
The third Power which has found itself
is West Germany, but with an 85-year-old
leader who appears to have no natural
successor at hand the position is not so
stable. At the same time Dr. Adenauer
is a firm ally who has command of his.
country and policy.
The net result of the rise of stable,
firm and imaginative leadership in
Western Europe is a relative diminution
in real stature of both the leaders of the
United States and of Russia. And the
logical conclusion seems to be that an
entente of the three great European
countries with all their drive and know-
how and their formidable population
could change the balance of international
politics in short order if they made up
their minds on a concerted plan.
There is no doubt that Western Europe,
through their influence, is on the way
up towards gaining its old place in the
councils of the world.
Women and Science
Professor Messel has probably done
more than any other man to awaken
interest in the need for training more
scientists in Australia, and he has inspired
others to do something towards meeting
the need. The growth of the Sydney
University School of Physics, the estab-
lishment of the Nuclear Research Foun-
dation and the institution of Summer
Schools for science-teachers are direct
results of his campaigning, and the
recently established Industrial Fund for
the Advancement of Scientific Education
in Schools probably owes something
indirectly to his example.
In recent weeks the professor has been
drawing attention to the very limited
opportunities for Australian girls to study
science. The difficulty is twofold. There
are very few women teachers qualified
to teach chemistry and physics and the
position with mathematics is not much
better. Further, girls’ secondary schools,
both Government and private, are, with
few exceptions, unequipped or ill-
equipped with laboratories.
The long-term answer is more women
science-teachers and more and better
facilities in the girls’ schools, but
obviously some immediate plan is called-
for if the first of these two deficiences is
to be overcome within a reasonable
period. A possible solution is to make
use of the male science-teachers and the
laboratories and science-rooms of the
boys’ schools.
This would involve problems, particu-
larly as the boys’ schools are not over-
loaded with fully qualified science-
teachers, but the difficulties shouldn’t be
insurmountable. Perhaps a system of
“linked” schools could be worked-out,
with science students from girls’ high-
schools in a defined area travelling to a
convenient boys’ school for chemistry
and physics. With mathematics, as special
classrooms would not be needed, it might
be found more convenient for the teachers
to do the travelling. A similar arrange-
ment could be made between private
schools. All this would probably necessi-
tate much rearrangement of time-tables
and even of school-hours, and would
also mean some teachers would have to
work overtime. But if the need is as
urgent as Professor Messel and other
riiiiiHiUHttiiliuUiuilia
is worth trying. If successful, it would
in a few years provide for its own liquida-
tion as more women science-teachers
became available to take-over the work.
Bolte Campaigns
The campaign launched by the Vic-
torian Liberal Premier against the
Federal Cabinet because of its refusal
to assist the States to meet the cost of
the margins-rises, which will be about
£6 million a year for the Victorian
Government, may prove damaging to the
non-Labor cause in Victoria.
Bolte has lost no opportunity for
criticising his political allies in Canberra
for what he describes as their flat refusal
to help, and in announcing the Parlia-
mentary Liberal - party decision to
authorise increased rail-fares, he
described them as inescapable because
of the refusal of the Commonwealth
Government to restore financial responsi-
bility to the States.
The Premier has come to light with
some convincing figures, both general
and particular, which will apply equally
to all States ; he has the assistance of
astute public-relations men. One case he
quotes is that of a public servant
receiving £3OOO a year.
He will get about £640 a year more
under the 28 p.c. margin-rise, but £275
will be taken by Federal income-tax
because the officer’s salary will go into
a much higher income-tax bracket; and
the State will have to pay £ls as in-
creased payroll-tax. The State Govern-
ment will pay-out £655 but gets no
immediate return.
The administrative extravagance of
Bolte’s Government is less marked than
that of Menzies’, although it is bad
enough ; and his cries against his rich
relatives are understandable in view of
the facts that the margins-rises will cost
him £6 million and the rich country-
cousins will get about £7 million a year
in additional taxation from Victorians.
Premiers Cry "Poor Mouth"
|From Canberral
State Premiers and/or Treasurers can
expect very little sympathy from the
Commonwealth when they come to Can-
berra on Friday to plead for more
money. They have forced the Common-
wealth, much against its wishes, to con-
vene a special meeting of the Loan
Council to discuss the impact of recent
margins-increases on State finances. And
the N.S.W. Labor Government in par-
ticular has never shown any sign of
making an overt stand against wage-
inflation.
Prime Minister Menzies has made the
Commonwealth’s position quite clear lit
rejecting N.S.W. Premier Heffron’s re-
quest for a special Premiers’ Conference.
He said that the new formula for
reimbursement to the States, agreed to
unanimously last year, took fun
cognisance of wage-variations and, there-
fore, the Commonwealth could see no
reason to adjust grants to the States.
The Commonwealth could noLJflfilk


a Loan Council meeting, as the Com-
monwealth-States Financial Agreement
provides that if three or more States
seek a Council-meeting, the Common-
wealth must agree to it. Some States
even want the meeting open to the
press; but the Commonwealth will not
a<rree to this, as it believes if it were an
open meeting the States would tend to
“grandstand” and try to score politically
off the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth certainly will not
agree to increase reimbursements to the
States, nor will it undertake to increase
its loan-raising fund activities. Already
it is committed to finding £2lO million
in loan-funds for the States, and, of this,
probably up to £BO million or £9O million
will have to come from the Common-
wealth’s own resources.
Add this to the £220-million-odd which
the Commonwealth is passing the States
by way of tax-grants, and it means that
approximately a quarter of the Com-
monwealth’s total revenues is going to
the States this year already.
A ding-dong battle is likely to develop
between the Commonwealth and Vic-
torian Premier Bolte, particularly as the
Commonwealth, and Mr. Menzies in
particular, are hopping-mad at Bolte’s
repeated shots at the Commonwealth.
Some heated words can be expected
to be exchanged behind the closed doors
of the Council meeting, but these will
only “leak” out if the States think it
will be to their advantage.
The betting here, however, is odds-on
that the State representatives will leave
Canberra on Friday evening with not a
penny more than when they arrive on
Friday morning.
Back-bench Blues
[From Canberral
A number of N.S.W. Liberal back-
benchers in the Federal Parliament have
not taken too kindly to the P.M.’s
appointment of former world-champion
cyclist Opperman (“Oppy”) to the vacancy
in the Ministry caused by Casey’s depar-
ture for Hallowed Halls. Another very
unhappy man over the appointment is
Victorian Percy Joske, who was almost
certain he would go into the Ministry at
the next vacancy.
However, the P.M. passed over the
claims of these people completely and
produced the “Oppy” bombshell. For a
long time the N.S.W. Liberal machine has
claimed that Victoria held too much
power in the Ministry—having the three
top jobs—P.M., Deputy P.M, and
Treasurer.
The N.S.W. executive was rebuffed
when Menzies elevated Adermann from
the junior XI to the policy-making
Cabinet, claiming that at least one more
from N.S.W. should go into the top XII.
Failing in this, they were then certain
that Menzies would select someone from
N.S.W. to make up the Ministry to its
full number, but again they guessed
Wrong.
. When the first party-meeting this year
ls held on March 9, certain N.S.W. mem-
v hers are going to have some hard things
to say to the P.M. on his Cabinet
reshuffle.
This will add further to the dis-
content which has been mounting among
the back-benchers in the past 18 months
or two years over what they claim to be
Menzies’s lack of interest in the rank-and-
file views.
Irrespective of any criticisms, Menzies
will not change his mind nor will he give
any undertakings about the future. At
the moment, he is on top and looks like
staying there despite discontent within
his own ranks.
The only gesture he might make would
be to hand-out some of the. minor tasks
in the External Affairs portfolio to junior
Ministers to lighten his own load a little.
Nasser v. Israel
The position in the Middle East
grows more muddled except that
Nasser clearly is becoming more
dominant and belligerent. It seems
that he has been working deliberately
up to a head-on armed clash with
Israel not merely because he hates
and fears the Israelis but because Israel
is the one issue on which he can hope
to unite the whole of the Arab States
under his leadership.
For long Egypt has been an armed
camp full of tanks and Russian small-
arms. The Cairo press has carried out
a policy of abuse of Israel, and the
promise is inherent in Nasser’s policy
that at the first convenient opportunity
he will attack and destroy his enemy,
U.N. or no U.N.
He feels that the United States will be
forced to keep in with him because the
Suez Canal is so important not only
to its commerce but to its fleets in the
Mediterranean. Also, that even if it
shows signs of resistance to anything he
may do, it will be at the risk of world
war, since Moscow, haying got its fingers
into North Africa, is not going to take
them out again without a struggle.
As for the United Nations, Nasser,
like most others who have used it, feels
that it is something of a joke.
Thus, save for the fumings of Kassem
of Baghdad, who would like to assume
Nasser’s mantle as the Messiah of Pan-
Islamism, Nasser has no real external
opposition to his policies among great
Powers. Nobody wants to quarrel with
the Arabs because it might mean losing
Middle East oil to the Russians and the
Suez Canal by world commerce. So all
the fine aspirations and highfalutin
protestations that went with the ill-
advised creation of the Palestine State
are being conveniently forgotten by
those who gave them birth.
The surrounding Arab countries have
declared a total boycott of trade with
Israel and are telling outsiders, whether
they be Americans, British or Japanese,
whether they may or may not trade with
Tel Aviv. Ships carrying goods for Israel
are refused passage of the Canal. Moves
are being made to divert the waters of
Jordan, which are the very lifeblood of
Israel’s continuance, to Arab countries
so as to starve the Israelis out.
All these things are being done by
members of the United Nations in direct
contravention of U.N.’s statutes and
every principle the organisation stands
for, but the U.N. pretends not to notice
and keeps its comic-opera and polyglot
Army along the Israeli border with no
effect on anything save the food-supply.
The latest shooting seems to be the
real thing and not the sporadic sniping
which is normal. It was clearly begun
from the Syrian side of the border in a
manner which sounds as if it were in-
tended to be deliberate provocation.
President Eisenhower, in his rather
vague comments on Sir Anthony Eden’s
version of the Suez affair, remarked
virtuously that at the time of the incident
he “had made it very clear that the
United States was going to stand by
its interpretation of the United Nations
policy and the Charter,” and that that
meant “we would apply this to anybody
—those we thought our closest friends
as well as those we thought were in
another category.”
It would be interesting to know Mr.
Eisenhower’s thoughts about U.N. policy
and the Charter in relation to the pro-
ceedings of the Arab Federal Republic
on the eve of an Arab conference due
to take place this week. Perhaps he
hasn’t any thoughts. The receptacle in
which the United States keeps its con-
science about Middle East affairs seems
to be so filled to the brim with oil that
there is no room for anything else.
The Judge's Homework
Grumbling in Melbourne about the
delayed presentation of the report on
liquor-reform by Judge Fraser, chairman
of the Licensing Court, has been renewed,
but the simple explanation is that the
judge has not written it because he has
not had time.
Although he returned from his tour
of Britain, the U.S. and Europe last
October, Judge Fraser has since been
heavily occupied on the bench both in
the city and country, where his daily
chores sometimes last long over the
accepted hours, especially when applica-
tions are contested. He labors on his
report in his spare time.
In a State still bogged in the slush
of 6 p.m. closing of bars, some im-
patience for a sign of action in official
quarters is understandable, but Judge
Fraser is expected to give Parliament
not merely a report on what he saw
but recommendations for reform that he
can effect from his bench, if given Par-
liamentary approval.
The judge examined hotel grading in
New Zealand some years ago, and the
Government then decided to take no
action until he had had a wider tour.
The Government’s supporters in Spring
Street have no doubt that the Liberals
wish to introduce liquor-reforms and
their decision to send the judge abroad
is an earnest of it; but it will be a big
scheme and it must, above all, be
workable.

“S.R.H.”: On the morning of Aus-
tralia Day: “You two chaps go and hoist
the flags, and for goodness’ sake get the
Union Jack up right.” Half-an-hour later
I went out to check, and blow me down
if there wasn’t the Jack fluttering in dis-
tress ; a fair indication, because on the
other pole there was one rope-end
dangling ’way out of reach half-way up
it. Another half-hour later the main-
tenance-bloke who’d been sent to lend
a hand reported back with a request for
three tiles to replace the ones they busted
in retrieving the end. Quite an expensive
business, this flag-waving.

“P.0.M.C.”: Some quaint dodges foi
enticing sleep were adopted during
Sydney’s infamous heatwave. A friend
of mine spent the Wednesday and
Thursday nights naked in the porcelain
bath-tub with net spread over nine-tenths
of the top to ward-off mosquitoes. A
neighbor told me that she and her
husband had slept fairly well aided by
two electric fans—one behind the foot
and one behind the head of their bed.
The purr of the fans (she said) actually
lulled rather than disturbed. As for me,
I spent two of the four murderous nights
in pyjamas flat on the grass in the public
park opposite my dwelling, with pillow
at head and loaded insect-gun at hand.
So still and heavy was the air that only
two sweeping shots with the spray be-
tween 11 p.m. and dawn were required
to keep the squadrons of mosquitoes out
of my territory.

“Curio”: To suggest having a “mardi
gras” during Melbourne Cup Week (B.
27/1 / *6O) is like proposing a Christmas-
party in June. For one thing “mardi
gras” is not “French for carnival”; it
means “Fat Tuesday,” and should be
spelled with a capital M and G. There
is only one Tuesday in each year on
which it can be held —the eve of Ash
Wednesday, which begins Lent. The
date varies according to that of Easter
-—this year Mardi Gras will be on
March 1. The name refers to the custom
of having one last feed of the luxuries
foresworn during Lent.
“Mugga Way”: Large liners used to
be places where people could “get away
from it all'* —but will they still? The
Orient 40,000-tonner launched by
Princess Alexandra last November will
be “the first passenger-vessel in the world
to be equipped with a completely inter-
nal and off-air TV-system.” This will
mean that passengers will be able to
watch town-TV at ports of call (what
•will become of the souvenir-shops and
tourist trips ashore?), and TV originating
aboard while at sea. The installation
provides for reception of the systems
used in Britain, Australia, Europe, the
U.S., Canada, Japan “and some South
American countries.” With 60 receivers
in public rooms and lst-class cabins,
increasing later to 400, there’ll be no
escape except over the rail.

“G.T.”: Recovering from a serious

a fishing-trip, and while he fished from

sunbaked and read or slept. One day
I awoke to hear him castigating five or
six young boys who, he. told me later,
had been spying on us from behind a
nearby rock nearly all the afternoon.
As they made off the youngest of the
bunch, all of 10 years, turned to give
him a withering look and to say dis-
paragingly, “Gee, mate, you’re slow!”
A MODEST PROPOSAL
“Sydney’s traffic problems demanded a ban
on cars in the city area or demolition of half
the city’s buildings; to widen roads, said
Professor Ashworth, Professor of Architecture
at the University of Sydney.”
If Sydney cars must all be banned
Or shops pulled down to give them
room
A test of strength might well be planned
To let them both work-out their doom.
Knocking pedestrians lame and halt
Has always seemed a waste of trouble :
The driver really worth his salt
Should hunt, instead of rabble, rubble.
Against a warehouse or a store
A single car might bounce a bit,
But twenty-thousand cars or more
Would make a serious dent in it.
Meanwhile the shops, erect and tough
Behind their plate-glass barricade,
Would fire their staffs with stories of
All the great charges they have made.
Things would come down so heavily,
And cars sustain such diminution,
That in a month or two there d be
No problem left for our solution.

her with six passengers and paddle up
Fairey Creek as far as we could, what
time our anxious parents dithered about
asking the police to drag the lake for

“Imperial 55”: Did I know anyone

Would I . . . ? Greater love hath no
typist than this, that she types a thesis
for a friend. The tempo is o.k. to start
with, neither side hurrying. Then the
zero-hour looms and there is a frenzy
of activity. The typed pages must be
checked. Is it really necessary? Your
hair rises. It is a technical subject and
there isn’t a typewriter made that knows
how to spell, or a typist born who
doesn’t make mistakes. And when it is
checked, apart from the typing - errors,
there are things the author decides could
be better said, or percentages that have


been changed on second thoughts—which
means retyping.
And is there a thesis-writer who ever
starts from the beginning and gives you
the script in order, so that the pages
can be numbered as you go? You type
the sections and keep them in order and
hope for the best. There are blank-
spaces for page-numbers to go in for
reference, and more blank-spaces because
dates have to be checked or footnotes
provided. You quest,on his punctuation
and gramma,cal construction. He
reckless with tiredness, says, Do what
you like.” You stand over him from
the beginning, and half the time he brings
you another chapter because it was in
his mind. You remind him that zero-
day is such-and-such. He gets that
"... five-four-three-two-one-BANG!"
hunted look, and you feel a heel, and
get him a cup of tea or send him off
home to have a good sleep.
You don’t get any sleep, and the
neighbors don’t get much, either. The
candle burns both ends. The pages
mount-up. You finally get the first
chapter and start numbering pages. Then
you have to go through the tedium of
inserting carbons in all the sheets and
numbering all the middle chapters, which
takes hours. Finally you have it done,
and round about 2 or 3 a.m. you sort
all the copies into their respective heaps,
have a final cup of coffee, hand it over
to the limp author and vow never again
to be let-in for this sort of thing. It
may be higher education—it certainly
leaves a poor typist dizzy. But the
reward comes in the results. Your thesis
has done the trick! You feel a glow
of achievement. But if it takes the typist
about 50 hours of work, how long does
it take the author?

It might even give you pleasure
In the thought that you may measure
About four hammer-handles round the

In your view—the Oriental
May see as sublimation of desire;

At blemish of their own nose, brow

Of these they could grow fonder
If this fact they’d only ponder:
Their map is okay somewhere on the

Scientists Are Helping
The Search for Fish
By C. F. ADERMANN.
Minister for Primary Industry
With the unloading of
her first catches by the
modern diesel trawler
Southern Endeavour
at Port Adelaide a new era
opens for southern Australia's
fisheries, because Southern
Endeavour will be fishing in
the Great Australian Bight, the
only big untapped trawling-
ground near our main centres
of population.
Since the potentialities of
this fishery and the problems
of marketing the catch are not
fully known, this development-
work is being undertaken by
the Southern Trawling Com-
pany, Ltd., a company estab-
lished by the Commonwealth
Government and financed from
the Fisheries Development
Trust Account.
The trawler's operations are
to be on a commercial basis,
and if they are successful the
Government intends to attract
private capital to take over the
business.
Trawling in the Great Aus-
tralian Bight is, in fact, one
of the many ways in which
the Commonwealth Govern-
ment is assisting the develop-
ment of new fisheries and the
improvement of existing ones.
This is an important aspect
of our economic development,
in providing food for the
domestic market and exports
which are valuable foreign-
exchange earners.
Our fisheries have a long
way to go before meeting
national requirements in these
respects. For example, in 1958-
59, when the Australian catch
of all forms of edible fish and
shellfish was valued at nearly
£ll million, we also imported
more than £6-million-worth of
fish in various forms. In the
same year we exported over
£3Umillion-worth of fishery-
products—mainly craytails.
/Tearly we could consume a
good deal more fish in
Australia, especially when we
consider our growing popu-
lation and the number of
migrants from countries where
fish is a regular part of the
diet. And markets are available
overseas for still bigger
quantities of craytails, prawns
and scallops.
So, at present, our main
need is to discover where more
fish can be caught in com-
mercial quantities and within
a reasonable distance of main
markets and processing-plants.
This is where the Fisheries
Division of the Department of
Primary Industry, which ad-
ministers the Fisheries Develop-
ment Trust Account, can pro-
vide effective assistance.
Fishermen, even if they have
the equipment, cannot afford to
undertake on their own the
large-scale exploration involved
in finding new fishing-grounds ;
scientifically conducted sur-
veys, some of them lasting
several seasons, are necessary
to fill these gaps in our know-
ledge. A number of such sur-
veys are now in hand.
This work has been made
possible by the creation of
the Fisheries Development
Trust Account, into which the
proceeds—about £750,000
from the sale of the Australian
Whaling Commission’s station
at Carnarvon (W.A.) have been
paid.
The trust-account was estab-
lished under legislation passed
by the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment in 1956, the intention
being that the money should
be used for the benefit of the
industry as a whole.
The types of project which
qualify for support from the
trust-account are new major
fisheries capable of early de-
velopment to relieve our need
to import fish or to provide
goods for export; also the
expansion of existing fisheries
for the same purposes.
So far four projects, includ-
ing trawling in the Bight, are
being undertaken, and the
results of two more are under
consideration.
A mong the projects in hand,
the prawn-survey, now in
its third season, has already
yielded practical results in the
discovery of large quantities of
king-prawns and tiger-prawns
near Fraser Island, off south-
eastern Queensland.
A further six-months survey
began in November, 1959, and
will cover the area from More-
ton Island (Q.) to Lakes
Entrance in Victoria. The
main aim is to seek prawns
beyond a depth of 30
fathoms. The survey will go
beyond the continental shelf to
a depth of 150-160 fathoms.
During last year's work a
species of large prawn, be-
lieved to be previously unknown
in Australian waters, was
found in 150 fathoms off
Broken Bay (N.S.W.). If it
proves to be a new species it's
likely to be named after
Challenge, the prawn-trawler
for these surveys. King-
prawns have been found off
Lakes Entrance, but so far not
in commercial quantities.
Further investigation may lead
to the discovery of the main
prawning-grounds in these
areas.
Another survey is tackling
one of our most unpredictable
fish, the barracouta, for which
there is a considerable demand
in Victoria. This is an excel-
lent table-fish when caught in
prime condition, the difficulty
being to find it at the right
season.
A sum of £29,500 was
allocated to build, fit-out and
operate a suitable vessel, and
investigations have now begun,
the work being conducted by
the C.5.1.R.0. Division of
Fisheries and Oceanography.
One of the features of the
project will be the tagging of
barracouta to trace their
seasonal migrations.
Crayfisheries should also bene-
fit from further scientific investi-
gation. At the request of the
Western Australian Govern-
ment a survey started in June,
1959, to determine whether the
Southern-crayfish occurs in
commercial quantities in the
southern waters of W.A. The
survey will last a year, and it
is hoped that this fishery will
be capable of development in
order to increase availability of
crayfish-tails for export to the
United States and to relieve
pressure on the present known
resources of crayfish in Western
Australia.
As a source of' foreign ex-
change our crayfisheries are
significant. In 1958-59 they
earned nearly 7-million dollars.
Ten years previously they
brought in only 1.36-million
dollars.
C'urveys have also been made
into the pilchard- and
tuna-fisheries. Pilchards are
available in large quantities at
certain seasons of the year;
their exploitation is closely
linked with proper canning-
facilities.
Tuna in Australia has not
yet attained the popularity it
enjoys overseas, though con-
siderable headway has been
made in recent years. The
introduction of improved fish-
ing-methods, sponsored by the
Commonwealth Government,
has greatly improved the effi-
ciency of the industry, and
steady expansion is expected.
As need arises and funds are
made available further investi-
gations will be undertaken, and
the waters around Australia
may yet have some surprises
in store for us.
Unlike the older fishing-
grounds of the world, which
have been developed over
centuries, the exploitation of
Australian fisheries is a rela-
tively new undertaking, with
considerable areas either only
briefly surveyed or as yet un-
explored by scientists.
We have to find out a great
deal about our fisheries-
resources and the factors that
influence the availability of fish
in these parts. Fisheries
Division of the Department
of Primary Industry and the
C.5.1.R.0. Division of Fisheries
and Oceanography will con-
tinue to co-operate in this
work.
Exploratory and experi-
mental fishing-operations, bio-
logical, oceanographic, techno-
logical and economic research
are being co-ordinated to give
the answers to the problems of
fisheries - development. An
energetic start has been made,
and there should be consider-
able results in the future.

Whether or not he intends to hand the
job over to Barwick or someone else
later on, he obviously wants to have
the strings in his own hands for the
next few months.
At the same time, these overseas prob-
lems should not be allowed to push
domestic economic matters into a corner.
The Menzies Government has shown
itself little keener to attack inflation at
the base than any other Government.
And the economy has suffered as a result.

the A.L.P. in its desperate fight to get
the Doc. off its back will have serious
effects even if the bid fails. It is a
sine qua non that whoever is appointed
will be subject to a Government ready
to allow the nondescript careerists of the
A.L.P. to dictate its judicial policies.

India’s one experience of Communist
rule —in Kerala State has ended
ignominiously for the Communists at the
elections following
the suspension of the
Communist Govern-
ment. The United
parties’ victory by 87

Communist suppor-
ters independents —
knocked so much
wind out of Mos-

The dispute which
threatened the future
of the R.A.F. base
at Gan Island, in the
Maldives group,
about 420 miles
south-west of Cey-
lon. has been settled.
The Government of
the Maldives has
made the United
Kingdom a free gift
of the use of the
island, on which the
R.A.F. has a staging-
post, for 30 years.
The word “free”
apparently refers to

China has signed

TWENTY-EIGHT

At recent meetings of N. S. Wales

In his report to the Westralian Govern-
ment Sir George Ligertwood, who was
appointed last year as a royal commis-
sioner to inquire into betting in W.A.,
has recommended that betting-shops
should be abolished and their place
taken by an off-course totalisator. He
found that although betting-shops had
some merit, in that they provided the
Government with revenue and punters
with facilities for betting on well-
conducted premises, their undesirable
effects outweighed these benefits. They
were crippling racing and were likely to
bring it to a standstill. Under an off-
course totalisator scheme all profits
would be divided between the Govern-
ment and the racing-clubs.

As a sequel to the Prime Minister’s
refusal to summon a Premiers’ Con-
ference to discuss the effect on State
finances of the 28 per cent, increase in
margins the Premiers asked (through
N. S. Wales Premier Heffron) for a meet-
ing of the Loan Council. Under the
Commonwealth-States Financial Agree-
ment a meeting must be held if three
or more Premiers request it. In this
case five States joined in the request;
Premier Brand, of Westralia, was absent
from Perth and could not be contacted
in time.
It was apparently the hope of the
Premiers that as the Prime Minister
could not avoid calling a Loan Council
meeting he would reverse his earlier
decision and also agree to a Premiers’
Conference. However, Menzies okayed
the Council meeting, but said his views
on a Premiers’ Conference were
unchanged.
Earlier he had said that the new
formula for tax-reimbursements accepted
last July covered such contingencies as
the rise in margins. He also pointed out
that only two States —South Australia
and Victoria—had appeared before the
Arbitration Commission when the
margins-case came before it.

At this stage U.S. Vice-President
Nixon seems odds-on to win the Repub-
lican nomination for the Presidential
election, possibly without opposition, but
the Democratic field is still wide open.
Adlai Stevenson, twice unsuccessful
against Eisenhower, may yet be given
a third try, but many Democrats think
his load of two defeats is too much to
carry. Senator John Kennedy is a strong
contender, but is finding his Roman
Catholic religion a handicap to accep-
tance, as A 1 Smith found it a handicap
to election when he opposed Hoover in
1928. Senators Lyndon Johnson, from
Texas, and Hubert Humphrey, from
Minnesota, are other starters with a fair
following, but the man who has made
the most headway in recent weeks is
Missouri Senator Stuart Symington.
Secretary of the Air Force and Chair-
man of the National Security Resources
Board under Truman, he has been a
critic of the Eisenhower Administration’s
defence programme. 'Till now he has
been coasting along quietly, but his
sponsors are expected to step-up his
campaign in the next few weeks.

announced that the Government is look-
ing at American proposals to set-up
stations in Australia to “assist in track-
ing the first U.S. space-traveller.” Will
the Russians seek similar help for their
rival project, with stations manned by
some of the local Reds who’ve had

Apparently in the belief that the
Country party will play ball in the next
Victorian Assembly election, the A.L.P.
has withheld endorsing any candidates
for the 10 seats held by the Country
party. There has been a link between
the two parties for Legislative Council
by-elections, but that has been accepted
by the C.P. to retain the last vestige of
its power in the Council.
Labor has selected 30 Assembly
candidates and is busily engaged in
endorsing 10 more, claiming in advance
success in Dandenong, Prahran, Broad-
meadows, Essendon, Morwell, Moonee
Ponds, Hawthorn, Geelong West, Dun-

swingers and Labor could perhaps take
half of them.

this isn’t enough.

designate himself F.R.G.S., F.R.S.A.,
F.Z.S., LL.D. (Hon.) of Aberdeen Uni-
versity and of Queen’s University
(Canada). Educated at Eton and Oxford,
he first served two years as assistant
district-commissioner in Uganda, then
joined the Hudson’s Bay Company in
1937 and wintered in their service
in Baffin Land and the Canadian
Arctic, 1938-39. In War II he

Denmark, England, Europe, Eire and
North America.
Born 63 years ago in Sydney, he served
with the Ist A.I.F. in France, celebrating
his 20th birthday in a troopship and
taking part in battles on the Western
Front from Pozieres to the end of the
war. After demob, he completed his
studies, passed his exams, held several
commercial appointments and became a
partner of Hungerford Spooner in 1932.
He launched his own firm in 1955, and
is a pastmaster at rehabilitating large,
rickety companies—the bigger the better.

over by Massey-Ferguson.
Herewith, Francis Bede McCann,
formerly Commonwealth Director of
Health, South Australia, but now
retired and a member of what
he calls “the M.C.C.” (Medicos'
Coronary Club). His autobiography
Medicine Man earned favorable com-
ment on the Red Page some weeks back.
McCann points out that this was not his
first mention in The Bulletin —he
started his literary career, when a young
doctor, by having a letter published in
O.F.M. For this he collected 10s. and
he spent £1 celebrating the event with
his companions.
At one time, during a year spent as
m.o. at Alice Springs, McCann had what
MEDICINE MAN

advantage of this roaming life, he says,
is that he made plenty of friends who
all want to buy his book. He has a
couple of other publications to his
credit: a Handbook for Commonwealth
Medical Officers (1949) and Our Lady’s
Signature, which came-out in 1958. At

Hon. W. A. Vanneck, of Leiston, Suffolk
(Eng.), was born at Gatton (Q.), edu-
cated at Wellington College (Eng.),
joined the 13th Hussars in 1906 and
succeeded his uncle as fifth Baron
Huntingfield in 1915. He was Governor
of Victoria, 1933-39, and Acting Gover-
nor-General in 1938. The title, an Irish
peerage, was awarded in 1796 to Sir
Joshua Vanneck, third baronet and a

he passed on, Beardsmore had held a commis-
sion for 64 years, being appointed a second-
lieutenant in the 2nd Infantry Regiment,
N.S.W., on July 11, 1895. He got his second
star in 1898, became an area-officer under
Universal Training in 1912 and joined the 24th
Infantry as a major in 1914. Serving with the
A.N. and M.F. at the capture of German New
Guinea that year, he returned to join the 30th
Bn. for the battle of Fleurbaix, was awarded
the D.S.O. and Volunteer Decoration, became
a lieut.-colonel in 1916 and was promoted
colonel in 1933. He was treasurer of the
National Rifle Association of N.S.W. and ot
the AJ.C. for many years; was in command
of the police-camp at Rothbury colliery during
the coal-strike, and made history as a public-
service officer when he thwarted Premier Lang
in one of the latter’s financial manoeuvres during
the depression.

he has been vice-president for the past
three years. For many years he was a
playing-member of the Perth Polo Club,
and he’s now deputy-master of the W.A.

which they took each year to India. As
a member of the Ashton team which
went to England in 1937 to play in the
Champion Cup, Robert Skene showed
such form that he was chosen to repre-
sent Great Britain in the Westchester


Cup competition against the U.S.A. He
was bagged by the Japs during the war
and afterwards went to the U.S.,
managing polo - teams and -clubs and
playing throughout America. Other
N. S. Wales teams in the Royal Easter
contest will come from Quirindi, Goul-

In command of the Dutch frigate
Kortenaer, which is to visit Fremantle,
Hobart and Sydney later this month, is
Commander Jean Charles Klaas
Leeksma, Royal Netherlands Navy, who

ABORIGINALITIES
BOY-MAN
Shells for money, tusks to hang
On a copper throat,
Bee-soft blossom for the hair,
And a tree for boat.
Sands are burning, skies will sing,
Moons are coral-red,
Thunder trembles in the drum,
And a young man s head
Spins around with power and dream . . *
{Star-flash points the spear.)
Smoke of feast is bitter-sweet,
This is nuptial year.
Magic shades and flying-fox
Throng in musky trees;
Island boy is not afraid,
Learns the power of these :
Bark and flower, and tusk and blade . . .
Every one is part
Of the essence and the strength,
And a young man’s heart
Beats together with the drum,
And his flesh receives
Messages from booming reef,
From the forest leaves.
Island boy is proud and strong,
Knows a spell or two . . .
Surf and sand and shadowed branch
Help the vows come true.
Shells for money, tusks for pride,
Drum-beat of desire,
Planets dance across the blue,
Men leap round the fire.

On the Mudgegonga-Myrtleford (Vic.)
road the automobile-orphaned joey
was salvaged tenderly and bottle-fed
patiently by the children to become
Annie, an unrestricted attache at the
farmhouse. She was a shameless im-
portuner of cake, and Dad, on the
veranda after tea with his paper, used
to counter her persistence by tucking
a paper-frilled cup-cake into her pouch.
Annie found the cake’s petticoat
excruciatingly ticklish, and it took her
a further half-hour to get the last crumb
out. As she grew, her sallyings abroad
became more extended and her farm-
house appearances rarer. On Christmas
Eve, Uncle Jim returned from shopping
in Myrtleford, the most important item
being two-ounces of pipe-tobacco for
Dad. There in the yard he found Dad,
Mum and the children feeding rare
visitor Annie some Yuletide mince-pie.
With a waggish remark about her now
being big enough to chew tobacco, Unk
bent down and tucked Dad’s flake-cut
into Annie’s pouch. She reacted in an
unexpected I’m-getting-too-old-for-such-
jokes-now way and made no attempt to
empty her pocket, but curtly departed
for the hills —tobacco, pouch and all. —
“Jeyles.”
* * * *
“Dicky”: Returned from abroad, he
was showing some of his color-slides of
Greece —the Acropolis ruins, white
against the brilliant sky, filled the screen.
“Gee,” said a naive youth in the back-
ground, “They have woodchopping
there, too.”
* * * *
“Ymar”: George was certainly a
knowledgeable gardener, as well as a
hard worker, but his quiet insistence on
always knowing best rattled some em-
ployers, just as his working-rig of singlet
or shirt and very short shorts put off
some womenfolk. But what really lost
him jobs, especially from spinsters who
lived alone, was his embarrassing habit,
at the end of a work period, of rejoicing
naked behind a trellis, or while crossing
from one back-garden to another, under
a refreshing shower from the nose.
* * * *
“Flight”: The little waxbill-finch, alias
zebra-finch, alias chestnut - eared finch,
and common in central and western parts
of Queensland, gets about in big flocks,
spilling sibilant syllables recklessly. The
little chaps nest and rear* their young
seemingly at any time of the year.
They’re considered a good sign, as they’re
supposed never to be found more than
half-a-mile from water, but often when
I’ve been in cattle-camps up to eight
miles from water in far-western Queens-
land a pair of finches would appear
within a day or so, perch on bucket-rim
or dish-edge and have a drink, twittering
lustily, and viewing stray straws with an
avian architect’s eye. And eight miles is
a mighty long way from water in a dry
land.
* * * *
“Harbel”: An ex-Hungarian acquain-
tance who had lost 40 ducklings told me
he had found them all with a neat hole
bitten in the neck, from which, appa-
rently, their blood had been sucked. I
suggested rats, but he ascribed it to a
weasel. I pointed out that there had
never been weasels in Australia. His
answer was that he had seen one within
half-a-mile of his poultryfarm. He went
“For gorsake let's put it down and have a smoke!"




on to describe a black-and-white animal
“long like a sausage,” with a white
throat and very small head. It certainly
didn’t sound like a native-cat—anyway,
I hadn’t heard of one in the district for
25 years ; then what was it? Inspira-
tion came: an escaped polecat (piebald-
ferret to some people) gone bush. No ;
he knew 7 ferrets when he saw them. This
was longer than a ferret, and had
a smaller head. I still say it was an
escaped polecat.
“Now, now , Samson, it's for your own good.”
“0.W.W.”: Hori attended a gather-
ing restricted to men accompanied by
wives or near-relatives. Seeing he had
a strange female in tow, an official
asked: “Wife, or near relative?” “Near,”
the Maori replied smilingly. “The only
wife I hafe handy.”
* * * *
“Sunray”: Can’t argue about the
merits of vanilla-essence v. lemon-
essence as a hooch (B. 27/1/’6O), but
an aunt who is a very strict Methodist,
with a horror of alcohol, never puts
brandy or any other of the doings into
Christmas-cakes or -puddings, but regu-
larly doctors them with a quarter-cup
of vanilla in lieu —and gets the same
result.
* # * *
“Wandana”: The area around the
once-flourishing town of Lyndhurst in
n.-e. Tasmania, now being converted for
soldier-settlement, was the site of the
island’s first goldmine-“salting” case 90
years ago. A party of mining-men from
across the Strait arrived to test the fields
soon after the first discovery, and
opened-up the “Great Tasmanian Reef,”
with allegedly good results, although the
fact that the shaft was carefully covered
from view and visitors discouraged pro-
duced an element of suspicion. How-
ever, a sale was negotiated for a sub-
stantial figure to a Launceston syndicate ;
but subsequent examination revealed
clear evidence of salting, and a public
meeting in the main street resulted in
a couple of the buyers’ representatives
galloping off to catch the culprits before
they could board a steamer for Mel-
bourne. They rode all night over bush
tracks and got there just in time. Arrests
followed, and evidence in court showed
the gold to have come from Victoria.
Following disclosures then that the
buyers had planned to unload their
salted property on others, the judge
caustically remarked that it was a case
of the intended biters themselves being
bitten, and he offered them no sympathy.
Jury’s verdict was accordingly “Not
Guilty,” but what happened to the £llOO
collected by the vendors is not recorded.

“A.J.A.”: Some explanation of how
small shops start and survive may be
found in one of the latest shops to open
in our town: a pet-shop; singularly
bare of pets, except a few budgies and
canaries and a couple of pups, it handles
other pets for a consideration. One chap
took sulphur-crested cockatoos in for
sale. “We’ll see if there’s any demand,”
they said, and until someone wanted
them he kept the birds at home. The
shop told him when to bring one in.
Other stories could be told of the estab-
lishment that would reflect on its profit-
and-loss account —but why worry? It’s
only a blind for an s.-p. bookie; even
the police know that, and every race-
day they, too, go in to admire the
canaries.
* * * *
“Kalewa” (France): There’s a noisy
and constant stream of traffic over a
cobbled market-square—big American
cars, racy French models, many German
makes and an occasional British pro-
duct. A red neon-sign spells-out “Stella
Artois.” Beer-drinkers sit at tables on
the footpaths, their talk intermingling
with the medley of American and French
hit-tunes coming from an amplifier
hooked to the wall of the cathedral. This
cathedral dominates y the market-square.
It has been rebuilt mhny times, as one
can see from the stones of different
colors. At the other end of the square
is someone selling Red Cross balloons, a
sign which says “Tea Served Anytime,”
and, a little further on, the Menin Gate.
This is Ypres on a summer’s evening.
Through the Gate comes a young man
on a bicycle with a small engine. It is
not going very well, and he tries to start
it by pedalling furiously and then sud-
denly letting-out the clutch. He jerks
across the market-square, turns left and
disappears down the road which runs
south to Wyschate, Messines, Ploegstreet
and Armentieres.
* * * *
“En Passant”: I have often heard the
claim made that the cassowary is good
eating, but the Kaja tribesmen of s.-w.
New Guinea, who live entirely off the
land and often don’t live too well, won’t
tackle cass.-flesh even as a last resort.
Weary of the taste of canned-food, we
ourselves would eat almost anything for
a change, but cook’s best efforts with
a half-grown cass. failed to make it
more palatable or tenderer than a broiled
motor-tyre.

“Tee See”: Joe was nudging 50 when
he bought a house near our bowling-
club and joined-up as a new bowler.
He always came early and practised
before the games started, and after the
games were finished he would roll down
more bowls to improve his technique.
For the greens’ sake such late play was
taboo, but no one wanted to chip Joe
about it as he was a new player and
a good bloke. His family solved the
problem. Late one afternoon, when
members were packing-up for home, Joe
was still practising draw-shots to kitty.
His young hopeful appeared on top of
the fence: “Dad, Mum says tea’s ready.”
“Right-oh,” said Joe, and kept on bowl-
ing. About five-minutes later the boy was
back: “Dad, Mum says if you don’t
come now you won’t get any tea.” “I’m
coming,” said Joe shortly, and started
to roll another bowl down. Soon the
lad returned and announced in a loud
voice, “Dad, Mum says you’re not getting
any tea!” Joe packed up pronto and
went home, and truth to tell, he was
cured of twilight bowling.


In the 1914-15 old-man drought I was
orange-growing at Tresco, near Swan
Hill (Vic.), and as the Murray got lower
we dammed it right across at Pental
Island, where the Little Murray joins it,
so that the water would fill Lake Boga.
No good ; the blokes lower down blew
it up. Inen the Murray went dry, and
we had a picnic in the bed, and caught
our fish by hand out of the holes. But
when a sandstorm banked-up against the
netting-fence of my block, and the
starving rabbits and hares started a free
feed off what was left of the oranges, I
lit-out for Melbourne ; and that’s how
I began a world-tour, via Gallipoli. —-
“T. P. I.”
“Doynest”: Noticed among Melbourne
housing-estates a community affair—
about a dozen separate dwelling-units on
the one large allotment, with a resident
caretaker, and certain shared amenities,
including a billiard-room and a work-
shop. The common billiard-room sounds
a splendid idea for the menfolk ; with
a convenient cupboard, it would give
the benefits of a select private club, and
no driving home after a convivial
evening with the boys. But a common
workshop shared by a dozen families!
Even with two sons —not to speak of
a wife —always borrowing my tools, I can
never find anything when I want it.
* * * *
“Swelpme”: Making towards camp at
sundown, my mate propped suddenly
and declared he’d seen a pair of
diamond-sparrows fly into a nest in low
scrub. I scoffed, pointed out that it
wasn’t the breeding-season, and, what
was more, that the nest was an old one.
Nevertheless, he stuck to his tale about
the birds going into the nest, and said
he’d wait till dark to catch the pair for
his aviary. Creeping up to the clump
of scrub, he shoved his hand over the
spout-like entrance and lifted the nest
holus-bolus. In the car, with doors and
windows shut, he carefully opened the
nest —and produced a pair of fully-grown
diamonds. We live and learn —I had
previously thought that no Australian
bird roosted in the nest after the breed-
ing-season.
* * * *
"S
“Kelms”: Kalgoorlie has a green-belt
committee which aims at relieving the
dust-nuisance by permitting and en-
couraging the replacement of native
trees and shrubs which have been cut-
out to supply fuel and timber for the
mines and city during the past 65 years.
Looks like a big job, and it’s bound to
take time ; but it shouldn’t be unduly
difficult if they follow the lead given
by the Forests Department, which for
years has been protecting certain areas
of bushland around the goldfields. If
the committee lets nature do the job her
own way, using the trees and shrubs she
Las specially evolved for that area, there
may be surprises in the speed at which
the old dame can work. On the other
hand, if the committee tries to introduce
exotic plants, or if it’s thwarted by over-
stocking pastoralists, the green-belt may
never eventuate. There’s something
almost miraculous about the native
vegetation around the eastern goldfields ;
visiting foresters are amazed at the size
of the gimlets and salmon-gums growing
in country which should be desert—and
which would be anywhere else in the
world. Could be it’s something wonder-
ful in the country—elsewhere in Aus-
tralia you don’t get trees like these in
localities with such a low rainfall and
high evaporation - rate. Usually under
similar conditions saltbush predominates.
Recently a researcher dug-up statistics
to prove that during the past 65 years
over 30,000,000 tons of wood-fuel and
timber has been brought into Kalgoorlie
from the surrounding country.

“Kelvin”: Mention here of a New
Australian kid who had to take a
recuperative day-off from school on
the eve of his sister's wedding re-
minded me of a jubilant friend in a
Queensland country pub: “In this dis-
trict they skite about 24-hour German
weddings; well, we had an Irish
wedding ten days ago and it’s not
finished yet!” Even he was a termite as
£ toper compared with Fitzgargle, an
R.A.A.F. type I met in 1942. To
relieve the tedium on shipboard between
the U.S. and Australia he and his
messmates drew up a list of daily duties
ranging from Disorderly Officer to
Duty Drunkard, the latter's tour pre-
scribing free drinks at the cost of all
other personnel and the solemn obliga-
tion to refuse none. Until Fitzgargle
was rostered, a succession of duty
“ Abdul's missed the train again!"
drunkards failed ignominiously. He
emerged with honor, to volunteer daily
until, largely on his account, the mock
roster was abandoned as too expensive.
Fitz doesn’t drink at all these days on
Civvy Street. But drink takes its toll.
It’s pathetic to see his once splendid
frame shrunken to a mere 15-stone as
he takes the first plunge as a member of
the Icebergs in mid-July, or to see him
timorously hurl himself into space as
an active member of a group of para-
chute enthusiasts.
An illustration in an old
English publication of a gadget like a
bespeckled boomerang pivoted on a
wooden peg turned out to be a “lark
lure/’ 250 years old, described as “a
mirror-studded crescent of hardwood,
mounted on an iron pin, which revolved
loosely in a hollow, pointed, hardwood
stake.” The operator chose a sunny day,
set-up his gadget, wound one end of a
long string around the iron pin, then
retired to a hiding-place with the other
end. When the string was pulled the
lure revolved, catching the sun’s rays
and the eye of winging skylarks. The
English lark being a natural stickybeak,
he came downstairs to investigate, and
was promptly shot to make the main
ingredient in lark-pie. In this country
we use mirrors to keep birds away.
Which raises the question: Are our
birds less gullible or more cowardly?
* * * *
“Murlonga”: When I first went out
with cattle into the Charters Towers
district (N.Q.) I had visions of buying
land and making an easy fortune, for
after heavy rains the swamps carried
iridescent scums which suggested sub-
terranean oil. Those dreams of wealth
were shattered by an old-timer who ex-
plained that the oil-like substance was
stuff washed off the paper-bark of the
tea-tree by heavy rain.
* * * *
'T'he white “ringer” and his abo. wife
were dishing-out tongue-lashings to
each other over the lubra’s attempts to
light the morning fire with wet wood.
With heavy sarcasm the “ringer” drawled,
“Go on, burn the bloody homestead
down! ” Whereupon she grabbed a quart-
pot full of kerosene, and with a howl
of rage tossed the lot over her spouse.
As the soaked and shocked man backed
away she struck a match and came at
him. He fled for the mulga, with the
screaming harridan at his heels. The last
I saw was the “ringer” executing a
lovely swallow-dive into the Todd, as
his better-half defiantly flung a last
match after him.—“Emcon.”

WAGE-PUSH AND GOVERNMENT BONDS
■pEOPLE who have been in the
-*• habit of investing in
Commonwealth loans must
now, in their own reasonable
interest, be concerned about
the wage-inflation evident
following the 155.-a-week basic-
wage increase in June, 1959,
and the 28 p.c. margins-increase
granted towards the end of
last year.
The stability that encouraged
investment in fixed-interest
securities during the seven-year
period November, 1952, to
June, 1959, when the total in-
crease in the basic wage was
only 30s. a week (an average of
about 4s. 6d. a week a year)
is now in danger.
Who is going to pay for these
extra wages? If the answer is
that the public is going to pay
through increased prices, then
we are off again on a round
of accelerated inflation which
took so much value out of the
pound during the earlier post-
war years.
In the two years between
November, 1950, and Novem-
ber, 1952, the basic wage,
under influence of the wage-
cost spiral, rocketed 895., from
£7 2s. a week to £ll 11s. a
week.
In these two years value
dropped out of the Australian
pound at a rate that was threat-
ening to cut even its 1950
depreciated value in halves.
Then, after this damage had
been done, the rot was halted
by the “wage-freeze” of Feb-
ruary, 1953.
During the seven-year period
of comparative wage-stability
which followed, the Loan
Council especially towards
the end of the period—was un-
usually successful in floating
its loans for State public works.
In recent years they have been
mostly oversubscribed. It is a
most unfortunate thing that
increased wages-awards have
now raised the possibility of
inflation occurring at an
accelerated pace again.
It is a startling fact, when
you come to think of it, that
through inflation (and allowing
for redemptions through 1 the
National Debt Sinking-fund)
the Commonwealth and the
States have shrugged-off all the
burden of the increase in the
national debt since 1939.
On June 30, 1939, the Aus-
tralian national debt (in the £
values of that year) was
£1,295,022,972.
On June 30, 1959, the Aus-
tralian national debt (in £
values of that year) totalled
£4,040,901,000.
On the face of it, the increase
was a little over threefold.
But the basic wage in 1939
was 795. a week; in June,
1959, it was £l3 16s. a week.
The increase in the basic wage
was therefore 3i times, as
against only slightly over three
times in the net national debt.
To reduce this to terms of
the small investor in Com-
monwealth loans, it means that
the person who had a £lOO
bond in 1939, and scrimped
and saved over the next 20
years to buy two more £lOO
bonds, would find that the
£3OO he would receive on
maturity in 1959 would
buy little more in terms of
goods and services (even allow-
ing for an increase in real
wages) than his £lOO would
have in 1939.
From the point of view of
the national Treasuries, infla-
tion, in fobbing-off the holder
of Government bonds, has
relieved them of all the burden
of additional borrowing since
1939!
Furthermore, the taxation
scales have not been adjusted
fully to relieve the lower
income-earners from higher
tax-rates that have been
brought-on by increases in
money-income that have not
been accompanied by similar
increases in purchasing-power.
Through inflation the
tendency has been for the
Treasury to scoop-in more tax
(because a greater number of
people are in the more inflated
brackets without being able
to buy any more with their
gross incomes); on the other
hand, the Treasury has been
able to shrug-off all the real
burden of national - debt
increase since 1939.
And investors are that much
poorer.
Double Indemnity
Trouble - indemnity policies
on a much wider basis
than in the past are now being
offered by the Mutual Life and
Citizens’ Assurance Co., Ltd.
With this new class of life-
assurance, up to double the
sum assured will be paid if
death occurs from any cause
in the first 10 years. Previously,
what is usually called “double-
indemnity” has been restricted
to death by accident.
A. F. Deer, general manager
of the M.L.C., says that at any
time in the period of 10 years
the assured can convert the
extra benefit into a normal
endowment or whole-of-life
policy irrespective of the state
of his health. The premium on
the extra benefit would be
somewhat higher than for the
double-indemnity restricted to
death by accident only.
The introduction of this new
class of assurance is intended
to appeal to married men, and,
in particular, to those with
young families.
It will challenge the “term-
insurance” business now being
offered by some new (or new-
comer) companies, while at the
same time having an underly-
ing basis of true life-assurance.

ing its own 8 p.c. distribution.

Gillespie Bros. Holdings
TTp and down in the market
lately have been the
shares in Gillespie Bros. Hold-
ings, Ltd., N.S.W. flourmiller,
maker of stock-foods, cake-
mixes, etc., * and investor in
margarine and bakeries.
There are now 1,100,000
10s. shares issued in this
co., of which 300,000 are
quoted as “new.” The difference
between the “old” and the
“new” shares amounts to less
than sd. a share in dividend.
Lately the “new” shares have
been selling at 225. 6d., against
235. 6d. for the old. The divi-
dend for 1958-59 was 8 p.c.,
half of it tax-free, paid from
profits disclosed at 21.2 p.c.
on ord. capital, which did not
include any portion of the un-
distributed profits of Mowbray,
Ltd., the Daffodil-margarine
concern in which it has a one-
third interest, the other two-
thirds being owned by Allied
Mills, Ltd.
There is no “goodwill on
consolidation” in the accounts
of Gillespie's, and there
appears to be a considerable
inner strength in land-valu-
ations and plant. Visible
reserves were equal to 16s. a
share at June 30 last, since
when there has been the new
share-issue.
Tax-free reserves were equal
to over 12 p.c. on the present
paid capital at last balance.
Gillespie’s have been diversi-
fying their activities according
to the current fashion among
flourmillers, and appear to have
been successful. Although the
immediate yield from an 8
pc. div. is only 3.5 p.c. at
225. 6d., disclosed earnings-yield
to market-price is 9.3 p.c., apart
from undistributed profits of
Mowbray. The shares appear
to have a considerable potential.
Flourmilling Diversification
A/fENTiON has been made in
these pages recently of
the policy of Spillers, the
U.K. flourmillers, in acquiring
bakeries as outlets for their
flour, following the activities
of the Weston group in buy-
ing bakeries. At the annual
meeting of Ranks, another
large U.K. flourmiller, in
London on January 26 the
chairman said:
The policy outlined last year of
taking advantage as opportunity
occurred to strengthen further the
position of our bakery interests,
having regard to the location of our
flourmills, has continued. During
the year we acquired additional
businesses in suitable areas and in
so doing have extended the scope
and diversity of use of that part of
our flour-output which reaches the
public through businesses in which
we are interested.
In Australia, Allied Mills,
Ltd., and John Darling and
Son (Aust.), Ltd. —the latter
associated with the Spillers
[U.K.] group have been
to the fore in acquiring
interests in bakeries. Other
flourmillers are also going
into the bakery business fol-
lowing the entry of the Weston
group into the baking trade
in Australia. Diversification
also takes other forms. Stock-
foods are a by-product of
flourmilling, and Allied Mills
and Gillespie Bros, control the
Daffodil - margarine concern,
the former with a two-thirds
interest, the latter with one-
third.
To revert to Ranks, in the
U.K., the chairman made an
interesting comment on the
wheat situation:
Great Britain has joined this year
the new International Wheat Agree-
ment. This means that 80 per cent,
of this country’s imported wheat
requirements must be purchased
through member-countries. In addi-
tion to this, some years ago the
milling industry agreed to use its
best endeavors to purchase 750,000
tons per annum of Australian wheat
We have, not without difficulty and
even at considerable expense to our-
selves, achieved our share of this
target. I would also like to mention
that the milling industry continues
to take-up a large proportion of
the home-grown wheat-crop, the
target-figure being 1,250,000 tons per
annum.
When figures on U.K.
primary production are noted
they usually (as in this mention
of 1,250,000 tons of British
wheat) astonish the Australian
reader.
Tasmanian Board Mills
A t their last sale-price of
7s. 3d. the £1 shares in
Tasmanian Board Mills, Ltd.,
dealt with at length in B.
6/1 / ’6O, seem still to represent
an interesting spec., particu-
larly to those who seek a
“hedge” against any infla-
tionary boom that might
develop over the next few years
and make the repayment of
debt an easier matter.
The co. has a profitable
timber business in Launceston
(Tas.), but is steadily working-
off the loss and debt incurred
from its ill-fated post-war
board-mill venture. If, through
plough-back of profits, the
ords., now at 7s. 3d., can be
restored to par over the next
10 years, the annual capital-
increment would be at the rate
of p.c. p.a. flat.
Profit-earning at last year’s
rate could achieve that. Whilst
there are always risks in the
timber business, it is equally
possible that economic develop
ments over a decade might
accelerate profitability and
expansion.

Bradford Cotton
"C stablishing a market
■ L ' r premium above others in
the text'le business, Bradford
Cotton Mills £1 ords., at 475. 6d.
last week, became the undis-
puted leader in the textile
group, and amply justified the
support given to the stock in
these pages and elsewhere.
In the first half of 1959 Brad-
ford Cotton ords. were being
sold at 355. each on a large
scale by a Melbourne invest-
ment-company, and the market
remained depressed for some
time.
Previously, in 1958, at the

At last week’s price of 475. 6d.,
Bradford ords. returned 5.3

which was still satisfactory in
the light of currently available
yields.
Bradford has built solidly
over a period of 30 years, and
has held its' position against
internal competition (such as
that offered by the expanding
Davies Coop) and overseas
imports, including those from
Japan.
It has not overloaded itself
with capital or convertible

responsible for a long-delayed
sharemarket response to its
other merits.

issued in Australia. It is neces-
sary to find out what the few
are doing; why the rest are
not doing; and, generally,
what, collectively, they know of
the geology of this continent
likely to aid them in their
search.
Apart from one or two major
exceptions, there is little
activity other than on the Stock
Exchanges and in sharebrokers’
offices, a precarious situation
for a nation resolutely discard-
ing local-powered transport in
favor of consumers of im-
ported liquid fuels. At any
time a minor hold-up could
halt us in our tracks in a matter
of days.
Where there is some activity
the choice of drilling-sites is
perplexing. Since we are im-

could well be we have an over-

continent that has not been
explored by pioneer geologists
and eminent teachers of world
renown. If their textbooks and
published reports were studied,
at least the problem of locating
oil in commercial quantities
would be understood.
This country starts-off with
the handicap of being in the
Southern Hemisphere, which
produces only about 3 p.c. of
the world’s oil, mostly in
Sumatra and Argentina.
Australia is the oldest con-
tinent, and its geology differs
widely from Northern Hemi-
sphere structures particularly in
regard to recognisable and
orthodox petrological surface
features. Our many sedimen-
tary basins record the conti-
nent’s geological history and
show the violent genesis and
subsequent and, indeed, con-
tinuing structural change.
These conditions make it
most unlikely that oil could be
formed and remain in situ in
any area south of the Tropic
of Capricorn. There can be
small pools. There are marine
shales and gas-pockets. There
is some activity in the Otway
(Vic.) basin, part of the sunken
lands forming the eastern
fringe of the great Murray
Basin. There is talk that the
Port Campbell gas-find is some-
thing new. Actually the whole
of this basin has been
thoroughly probed and the
capacity of these high-pressure
gas pockets is on record. Tech-
nically the shale could be pro-
cessed for oil but, economically,
the beds are too deep for
working.
A symposium of licence-
holders with eminent Common-
wealth and State geologists
could surely determine the very
limited but definite areas in our
Far North where conditions
appear favorable for the forma-
tion and retention of vast anti-
clinal pools. We can’t repeat
spending half-a-million on a
couple of dud wells which, on
the known facts, should not
have been drilled on the
particular sites at all.
There is a tendency towards
the establishment of an oil-
boom similar to the one which
got loose in the early 1920’5. In
this period any pool of
water showing an iridescent
oxide film was pegged as a
potential oil-well.
In one country town a
promoter was kept busy col-
lecting £25 for each syndicate
share after poking a pipe a
couple of feet into the ground
in one area and burning gas
at the top of the pipe. The go-
getter did very well until a
grinning geologist pointed out
that the gas was methane rising
from decaying animal- and
vegetable-matter, that the
ground was stercoraceous, and
that the town’s sanitary con-
tractor, having previously used
the area as a burying-ground,
was responsible for the descrip-
tive term.
The promoter had vanished
by the time the saddened in-
vestors had looked-up the
meaning of the word in their
dictionaries.
The discovery of flow-oil in
Australia is a matter of
economic necessity, and while
we cannot but be indebted to
overseas and local interests for
the expenditure of huge sums,
let us at least see that the
technical energy is directed to
areas where there is reason-
able hope that a positive probe
may be successful.

One Season of Sumner
Absolutely no controversy ;
the barest minimum of experi-
mentation ; little dramatic
stimulation of an unconven-
tional kind; safe policies all
round ; and few empty seats.
That, briefly, has been the
record of the Union Theatre
Repertory Company at the
Melbourne University over the
past season a season which
saw John Sumner, solidly
backed by the Australian Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust, resume
the directorship after a six-
year absence. To many, and
these include the present writer,
it is not altogether an inspiring
record.
Forgetting for a moment
what may have been going on
behind the scenes or in the box-
office, it can hardly be denied
that nowadays fewer and fewer
people are looking to the
Union Theatre Company —
once, perhaps, at the centre of
their boldest hopes—as the only
fully professional theatre in
Victoria likely to follow
dramatic lines that are
genuinely and significantly
adventurous.
Qualitatively speaking, there
is in fact precious little to
differentiate the fare you get
now at the Union from that
offered by J.C.W.s or Carrolls ;
not to mention the Little
Theatre and all the other
repertory groups.
Unhappily, it looks very
much as though this state of
affairs has not a little to do
with money or, rather, the
lack of it.
It is now well known that
financial stresses virtually
forced the resignation last year
of Wal Cherry, who had
directed the theatre for the
previous three seasons, and
who today has charge of Mel-
bourne’s new Actor’s Studio.
And financial considerations,
no doubt, have played a major
part in determining the theatre’s
policy this season.
Apart from the choice of
plays there have been the more
obvious examples of budgeting
in advertising. Posters aren’t
any longer seen pasted on
walls and hoardings through-
out the city ; the foyer does not
make a show of glossy photo-
graphs of current and forth-
coming productions; the big
noticeboard facing the street
“You ARE an old Philistine, Mummy. If Picartzo sees
Women like that, We must BE like that!”
outside the theatre no longer
proclaims the coming of a new
play or the title of the present
production; and the pro-
grammes, formerly lavishly pro-
duced and crowded with photo-
graphs and miscellaneous in-
formation, have been reduced
to the bare essentials.
All of which, of course, is
thoroughly justifiable if it is
necessary for the theatre’s sur-
vival. What is regrettable is
that in terms of drama the
Union Theatre Repertory
Company simply does not seem
to have made any real attempt
to push out into new fields,
or even seriously to re-explore
worth-while old ones.
Equally discouraging, in
this writer’s opinion, is that,
under former Old Vic stage-
manager John Sumner, the
atmosphere up at Carlton has
often come perilously close to
an old-fashioned theatricality—
with productions and acting at
times giving the impression of
being based more squarely on
the spurious ethic of the
“effective performance” than
on any genuine concern for
the author’s viewpoint.
Surely this is not as things
should be. And surely it’s high
time the Union opened its eyes
to the works of such important
and absurdly neglected writers
as O’Neill, Pirandello, Strind-
berg, Synge, O’Casey, Sartre,
Camus and Anderson—to name
just a few. Arnold Ridley, Jane
Arden, the apparently anony-
mous author of “Sweeney
Todd,” the Shaw of “Arms and
the Man” and their all-too-
numerous kin are simply not
good enough for a theatre with
the pretensions of the Union.
When it’s all boiled down,
the spiritlessness and lack of
vision of Melbourne’s dramatic
life at present—of which the
Union appears to be a telling
symbol—can probably be
traced back to one simple, sorry
factor: a fundamental lack of
belief in the theatre’s potential
importance in the comunity,
from standpoints other than
mere fashionable entertain-
ment-value.
What we need today are pro-
ducers and actors with a sense
of mission ; who can appreciate
the immense possibilities of the
tool they are using. These are
the people audiences will
follow, given half a chance.

“The Rape of the Belt”
Benn Levy, publisher and
former Labor M.P. in Britain,
must have had a whale of a
time writing this, the Trust
Players’ first offering of their
second season at Sydney Eliza-
bethan ; for it is based on the
myth of Heracles’s quest for
the sacred girdle of the Amazon
queens, and, as can be seen
from even a quick reading of
Robert Graves on the subject,
there are so many versions of
the story, and so many con-
tradictions and absurdities in
all of them, that it is wide open
to a generous injection of
almost any modern notion
about that richest of all comic
themes —the sex-war.
Levy, taking from the various
accounts the strands that best
suit his purpose and adding a
few of his own, has woven an
elaborately sly fable about the
war of love and the love of war,
feminism, pacifism and the
planned society v. the open
society. Although he says noth-
ing new on any of these sub-
jects, he says little that is not
worth saying again, and his
voice is fluent and well
tempered throughout.
His story-line goes some-
thing like this: Heracles and
Theseus, arriving in the heart
of the Amazon country, find a
sort of super Welfare State
run on rational, and somewhat
heartless, feminist lines. Queens
Antiope and Hippolyte refuse
with disarming politeness either
to surrender the wanted belt or
to fight over it. (The legendary

third queen has been dropped,
incidentally, and Antiope, not
Hippolyte, is the belt-bearer.)
The Amazons, it seems, have
never lost a battle for the good
reason that they have always
had the sense not to fight one.
The logic of their pacifism,
coupled with considerable
female charm, ,quickly exposes
the childishness of Heracles
and Theseus’s romantic code of
heroism, checkmating them and
forcing them to fight for the
belt on sexual lines.
Antiope, however, soon
feels herself going under to
Heracles and ceasing to care
much what he wants to take
from her ; so the goddess Hera
intervenes. She moves into
Hippolyte’s body for a spell
and, making the eternal
feminist mistake, organises the
Amazons into a mannish fight-
ing-force, thereby placing the
game in the hands of the men
and making absolutely sure that
they will win-out.
Zeus looks on in satisfaction,
knowing that whereas women
can win when they follow-out
their own unique natures they
have no chance of beating men
at their own game. So
Heracles gets the belt; Antiope,
a real woman to the end, gets
a large portion of Heracles’s
heart; Theseus gets Hippolyte ;
and the Amazons get a valuable
lesson.
It is all very much of an
intellectual game, with the
author, like a confident
billiards-player, attempting to
nominate his shots by placing
Zeus and Hera —god-husband
and god-wife, the eternal duel-
lists of the sex-war on
pedestals at opposite sides of
the proscenium arch and hav-
ing them observe, predict and
prompt the action according
to their respective interests. Al-
though the opening exchanges
of this pair are too clever-
clever and too long by minutes,
the device is pretty capably
managed.
The dialogue makes liberal
use of anachronisms and facile
irreverences, and every phrase
is turned like the leg of a new
chair modelled from the best
antiques. Probably reckoning
how few of us are up on our
mythology these days, the
author has also supplied many
a nudge to our memories—
some of them a bit too arch
for the present reviewer’s taste
—and every twist of the plot
is carefully underlined.
It is the sort of play that
is nicely suited to producer
Robin Lovejoy’s well-known
command of style—especially
pictorial style—and he has
given it considerable gloss.
Wilfred Asplin’s settings,
dashed with color, have in
their lines the well-informed
and amateurish wit of an
Osbert Lancaster cartoon with-
out ever intruding on the
action; and his costumes,
reaching out —at times too far
—for West End gorgeousness,
make some fine play with com-
binations of rich and soft
colors.
Of the actors, only Ron
Haddrick and Dinah Shearing
can as yet sustain enough of
the right kind of polish and
presence to keep such a play
vibrating at its most effective
pitch. Haddrick’s Heracles had
a fine resonance throughout,
but seemed a bit too heavy in
touch for the wittier ex-
changes. Miss Shearing, her
voice and movements as musi-
cal as ever, distilled a subtle
and exciting spirit as Antiope.
One felt that Neil Fitz-
patrick’s Theseus and Margo
Lee’s Hippolyte could have
provided a clearer contrast to
the Heracles-Antiope pair than
they did. Fitzpatrick had the
right flavor of carefree male-
ness all the way,~ but there was
a certain smudginess of detail
in his work. Miss Lee, obliged
in Act 3 to switch suddenly
from languid charm to a
Hera-tenanted militancy and
back again, had easily the most
difficult assignment. She was
effective in the broadly comic
and seductive aspects of the
role, but again one looked for
a finer and firmer touch in
the handling of details.
Robert McDarra and Neva
Carr Glyn capably handled the
pre-act cross-talk of Zeus and
Hera; their chief need is a
little sharpening of the
punchier lines to cut through
the murmur of shuffle of the
seemingly inevitable late-
comers among the audience
after the intervals.

“Kiss and Tell”
F. Hugh Herbert’s “Kiss and
Tell,” now having a run at the
Pocket Playhouse in the Syd-
ney suburb of Sydenham, is not
a very good play, nor does it
pretend to be. It is a cute little
American teenage concoction,
with two families at cross-pur-
poses through their somewhat
flighty teenage daughters. As
it goes, though, there are quite
a few laughs, in this production
mainly coming from Noannie
Rothsey, who turns herself into
quite a brilliant American
bobbysoxer, Kevin James (an
annoying 12-year-old), Ronald
Farrow, Patricia Brownlee (the
American accent needs to be
sustained better), Lionel Mann
and Jean Addison.

Mackerras Predicts Revival
Australian-born conductor
Charles Mackerras, now tour-
ing Australia for the A.8.C.,
sees a likely renewal of audi-
ence interest in 18th-century
music. This, he says, is
an outcome of recent
activities of a group of younger
conductors who are researching
the original scores and recreat-
ing the music according to the
composers’ intentions to allow
free interpretation and indi-
vidual “embellishment.”
“Audiences are revelling in
it,” Mackerras reports, “and
recording-companies are in-
creasingly interested.”
Evidence of this interest is
a recording conducted by
Mackerras in the acoustically
perfect St. Gabriel’s Church at
Cricklewood (London). It was
a perfoimance of Handel’s Fire-
works Music as originally
instrumented. Eighty wind-
instruments were used, includ-
ing 26 oboes and 14 bassoons.
The record, shortly to be
released in Australia, has
already been selected in “Top
20,” a London classical hit-
parade.

Young Painters
The Clune Galleries, at
Sydney’s Kings Cross, has
emerged from a January
hibernation with a large show
of oils and watercolors by
young painters. Heaven alone
knows when a painter loses the
stigma of being young ; many
of these paintings are exciting,
quite a few are mature pieces
of composition, and some,
while showing potential, indi-
cate that the artist is still
searching for a satisfying
channel of expression.
If “young” has something to
do with age, it is refreshing to
note such seasoned work as
Judy Hepper’s “Compose,” at
once decorative and subtle in
its watery merging of figures
in the foreground ; a pleasing
“Fortification” by Robert
Hughes, which, despite a bit
too much black, is probably
the most appealing of his
paintings on display ; Edward
Hall’s squarish but attractive
“Woolloomooloo”; Owen
Tooth's panelled “Botany
Bay” ; and Keith Looby’s
barbarously woebegone
children.
Youth, however, may have
had something to do with E.
Hill’s “Nude Study 111.”
Urged by the title, one looks
for the figure, but is met by a
cluster of stained-glass shapes.
In this respect abstract art
tends to defeat itself ; if it is
to have permanent artistic
validity it should rise above
mere cleverness. There is a
good deal of sense in Ralph
Balson’s method of leaving his
abstracts untitled.
All in all, the exhibition is
worth seeing. It is perhaps a
little cluttered —there are 110
paintings—but one consoling
thought is the obviously large
number of young painters in
Sydney willing to hang their
works.

faith and sacrifice parallel those

characters in it are opposite-

or opposed Jesus.
It is 1921, and Greece is
under the heel of the Turks.
The Turkish military com-
mander of a village is the
Pilate of the piece, and, hedon-
istic and easy-going, he finds
in the priest and the village’s
tycoon (they would be the
Sanhedrin) complacent tools
for keeping the ignorant popu-
lace from revolting.
There is to be a Passion-play,
a young shepherd being cast as
Jesus ; some of his friends are
to be the Disciples, and the
village prostitute is, of course,
chosen as Mary Magdalene.
Rehearsals are just beginning
when a crowd of refugees from
a distant village which has been
sacked by the Turks arrive
seeking sanctuary. When the
all-powerful hypocritical resi-
dent priest refuses it, the
refugees are compelled to take
to a nearby hill, where, almost
starving, they are helped by the
shepherd and his “disciples,”
who lead them in revolt against
the priest and his hirelings.
The Turkish commander,
like Pilate, would wash his
hands of the affair and cheer-
fully let the Greek factions rip
each other to pieces as long as
they left him in peace ; but the
resident priest, seeing the revolt
as a threat to his authority,
needs only to remind the Turk
of the consequences when news
of the trouble reaches Con-
stantinople. The commander
arrests the shepherd, who is
delivered into the hands of the
priest.
But it is the man cast as
Judas in the Passion-play who
delivers the final blow to the
“Messiah,” the inference at the
end being that an idea can’t
be wiped-out with a machine-
gun any more than with a cross
and nails.
The film is spiked with bitter
irony, and there are odd
touches of bitter humor ; but
it is chiefly informed by rich
compassion and humanity.
Director Jules Dassin has
handled the big crowd-scenes
with a masters’ touch and has
won fine acting from his
players. One of the best per-
formances is Melina Mercouri’s
Magdalene.

Brambles Industries, Ltd.
Brambles’ first five years as a public
co. have been spectacular. Paid-up
capital increased almost ninefold, from
£120,000 in 1955 to £986,598 at Decem-
ber 31, 1959. Reserves rose almost 10
times over the same period. Most of
the rapid growth took place during the
last three years.
The original co. was established in
Sydney in 1925 as W. E. Bramble and
Sons Co. Pty., specialising in road-
transport. In 1954 it was converted to
a public co. under the name of W. E.
Bramble and Sons (Transport) Co. Ltd.,
and continued to operate as a general
carrier, Customs-agent, removalist and
storer with headquarters in Newcastle
(N.S.W.). The present name was adopted
in 1958.
In July, 1955, Brambles acquired the
business of John O'Donnell at Port
Kembla (N.S.W.), converting it into a
wholly-owned subsidiary, W. E. Bramble
and Sons (Wollongong) Pty. Purchase-
consideration was 81,500 ss. ords. at a
ss. premium. This transaction was
characteristic of Brambles’ acquisition
technique, being financed by the issue of
new shares at a high premium. At June
30, 1959, accumulated share-premiums
reserve totalled £519,694.
In April, 1956, the co. bought-out R. R.
Pierce (Sand) Pty., a major carrier-
co. in the Port Kembla-Woliongong
area, for 240,000 ss. ords. at a 4s. 2d.
premium. Six months later Brambles,
together with Heckett Engineering Co.,
of U.S.A., formed an associate co.,
Breckett Pty. (initial paid capital of
£625,000). Heckett was issued 320,000
ss. ords. at Is. premium as the first
step in the new venture in which both
cos. joined as equal partners. Then
Breckett Pty. entered into a 10-year
contract with B.H.P. and A.I.S. for the
recovery of steel-scrap from open-
hearth slag and refuse resulting from
steelworks operations at Newcastle and
Port Kembla.
Following this, Brambles transferred
the shares of its three southern sub-
sidiaries to Breckett Pty., to help finance
the substantial capital - investment re-
quired. In March, 1958, Brambles
reacquired the subsidiaries written-over
to Breckett Pty. Another co., Common-
wealth Handling Equipment Pool Pty.,
was taken-over at the same time. Total
outlay was 840,500 ss. ords. at a premium
of 9s. a share.
Expansion gained momentum. In
June, 1958, the co. issued 840,000 ss.
ords. in exchange for the issued capital
and unsecured notes of Morison and
Bearby, Ltd., an old-established New-
castle engineering - concern and valve-
maker.
Since the last balance-date three other
transport-cos. were acquired. Edmund
T. Lennon Pty. was bought for cash.

was taken-over for 200,000 ss. ords. at
a 15s. premium. In October, 1959, the co.
obtained all the ord. capital in W. G.
Pickrell Ltd. by an exchange of shares.
Recently an offer was made to acquire
Kelly and Lewis, Ltd., the old-established
Melbourne engineering-firm. Brambles
offered nine 5s shares for each 10 Kelly
and Lewis 20s. ords) and seven ss. ords.
for each 10 20s. pref-s. (alternatively 20s.
cash for each pref.). Kelly and Lewis
directors have recommended acceptance,
which would add another £160,000 to
Brambles’ paid capital.
While all this empire-building was
going on Brambles’ shareholders were
not neglected and were given opportuni-
ties to increase their slices of the pie.
In February, 1956, the co. issued
224,600 ss. ords., two-for-five, at par.
In November of the same year' £204,000
7 p.c. registered unsecured notes were
offered to shareholders at par, three for
every five ords. held. Half of these notes
were convertible into ords. at the end
of 1959.
Early in the current term, in Novem-
ber, 1959, 1,032,000 7s. 6d. 8 p.c. con-
vertible registered unsecured notes were
issued to shareholders, three-for-ten at
par, payable in full on application.
Each 7s. 6d. conv. note will automatically
be converted into one ss. ord. (at 2s. 6d.
premium) on January 1, 1963. Note-
holders participate fully in all cash- and
bonus-issues, on the basis that one 7s. 6d.
note equals one ss. ord.
Finally, on January 11, 1960, Brambles
made another two-for-five cash-issue at
ss. a share premium, the new note-
holders participating.
Financial year ended June 30, 1959,
was “the most successful to date in the
history” of the co. Sales expanded and
profits increased. Improved results were
achieved “through the development and
expansion of those cos. which were mem-
bers of the group at June 30, 1958.”
Acquisitions made during last term have
not as yet contributed appreciably to
Brambles’ earnings. It is expected that
the earning-power will further improve
when the new subsidiaries are fully
integrated into the group.
After providing £340,810 for deprecia-
tion and amortisation (up £167,484),
consolidated operating net profit for
the year was £218,233 higher at £493,757.
Setting-aside £172,735 for taxation (up
£92,728) and paying £7730 directors’ fees,
consolidated net profit was £161,492
higher at £321,022:

This was equivalent to an earning-rate
of 42.3 p.c. on the larger average
ordinary capital, comparing with 42.5
p.c., 21.4 p.c., 35.7 p.c. and 55.5 p.c.
looking back over four years to 1955.
Div.-rate was steady at 20 p.c., absorb-
ing £151,589. Reserves benefited by
£169,433, and also by £63,921 capital-
profits and £92,060 premium on con-
solidation arising from the acquisition
of new subsidiaries. Intangibles amount-
ing to £13,348 were written-off, leaving
total reserves and undistributed profits
at £1,002,390. This gave a visible net
tangible asset-backing of 11s. 7d. for
each f.-p.. ss. stock-unit.
The earnings may be a bit better than
claimed, as disclosed profits seem just
a shade conservative in comparison with
the tax-provision. However, the solid
depreciation-whack could be the clue
here.
Brambles’ growth-rate is so dynamic
that the latest balance-sheet, giving as it
does a snapshot of the concern at
June 30, 1959, may be a bit historical.
Apart from the huge’ rises in paid capital
and reserves, the most significant move-
ments on the liabilities side were the
£387,000 jump in notes (to £591,000),
and the heavy increase in bank accom-
modation (£365,528 to £473,502).

In spite of the heavy depreciation pro-
vision, the book-value of plant, etc.,
increased by £356,610 to £1,315,843.
Some capital-assets were bought on hire-
purchase with £60,272 still outstanding.
Big increases in stocks, debtors and
cash reflect the rapid increase in turn-
over. Investment in the associated
Breckett Pty. remained steady at
£312,501. In addition, a small sum was
invested in shares, etc. Liquidity was
satisfactory, with theoretical .working-
capital at £255,890.
Recent issues of shares increased paid
capital to £986,598 at December 31, 1959.
Net profit for the first half of current
term, after “much higher tax and
depreciation provisions,” increased by
£80,993 to £217,290 (or by almost 60
p.c.), compared with the corresponding
six months to December 31, 1958.
The co. continues its policy of diversi-
fication of business-interests and inter-
state expansion. Brambles is a dynamic
concern, and its scrip last changed hands
at 345. a ss. ord. Rights fetched 225.
The immediate yield is 2.9 p.c. on the
basis of the 20 p.c. div.-rate, steady in
spite of the spate of capital-increases.
Associated Leathers, Ltd.
'T'he co. was registered in Melbourne
in 1948, amalgamating the interests
of five well-known cos. engaged in the
leather industries of Australia and New
Zealand. The group now comprises the
parent and 14 subsidiaries, and operates
five tanneries.
Associated Leathers distributes leather,
grindery, saddlery, canvas, sporting-
goods, a variety of finished leather-
products and some other lines, many of
which are produced within the organisa-
tion. The subsidiaries, some better
known by the general public and in-
vestors than the parent, are:
Michaelis, Hallenstein and Co. Pty.
Farleigh, Nettheim Pty and Farleigh Nett-
heim (Queensland) Pty.
Rosenstamm Pty.
Julius Cohn and Co., Ltd.
Zwar Bros. Pty.
Hedley’s Pty.
Interstate Rubber Co. Pty.
C. W. Hart and Co. Pty.
Spring Blinds Pty. [acquired during last
term].
Glendermid, Ltd.
Export-business is mainly handled by
Michaelis, Hallenstein (Export) Pty. in
Melbourne, Australasian Leathers, Ltd.,
in London and Australian Leathers
(Hong Kong), Ltd. During the year a
small non-operating subsidiary of
Hedley’s Pty. was wound-up to simplify
the group’s organisational structure.
Trading conditions last term were
generally satisfactory, but competition
was keen. All subsidiaries contributed
to consolidated earnings.
Some “rapid increases’’ occurred
during the year in the.price of hides,
which are a major factor in the group’s
business. This in turn caused some rises
in leather prices, though not enough to
cover the increase in costs of raw
materials.
The co., worried by the severe effect
of sharp price-variations on its stock-
values, has accumulated £76,403 as
“provision for price-fluctuations” which
is deducted from the book-value of
current stock. This provision was kept
as an undisclosed inner reserve until last
year, when it was revealed under provi-
sions of the new Victorian Companies
Act.
Consolidated operating net profit was
£83,364 higher at £344,410, after pro-
viding £76,288 for depreciation (up
£4124). Income from investments was
£3830 higher at £43,771, and another
£lll6 was received in rents.
After setting aside £143,140 for taxa-
tion (up £43,998) consolidated net profit
was £41,966 higher at £246,157:

ment, last year’s effort was still well
below the 22.8 p.c. earned in 1955.
Ordinary div.-rate was steady at 10

close to 300,000 20s. ords. in the Davis
Gelatine Consolidated.
Current stocks are much lower at
£1,638,427 (down £168,140), especially in
view of the higher sales and the increase
in the price of leather. Book-debts in-
creased by £58,313 to £825,735.

£1,364,274. Visible net tangible asset-
backing worked out at £l3 19s. for the

In the long-run the group’s domestic
and foreign markets may be threatened
by increased competition from cheaper
synthetic leather-substitutes. Thus far
the traditional good-quality, durable-
leather products have withstood the
pressure of synthetic materials with a
reasonable degree of success.
The immediate problem is created by
frequent fluctuations in market-prices.
These price-variations have been a source
of perennial worry to the board.
The 10s. ords. are changing hands at
20s. each. The immediate yield is
5 p.c. on the basis of the steady 10 p.c.

William Crosby (Hold-
ings), Ltd.
The shipping and agency
business controlled by
William Crosby (Holdings),
Ltd., originated in 1853, when
William Crosby and his two
sons went into business in
Hobart as shippers and ship-
ping-agents. Over 70 years
later the firm was converted
into a proprietary co.
The holding-co. a Mel-
bourne-based six-year-old—-ex-
changed 370,000 f.-p. £1 ords.
for the £lOO,OOO capital of the
pty. early in 1954, and shortly
afterwards offered a further
130,000 ords. to the public at
par. A one-for-five par issue
in November, 1955, brought in
£112,000, while extensions to
the group’s interests in Tas-
mania and West Australia
during the same term involved
the issue of 84,000 ords. and
lifted paid capital to its
present £756,000, all in f.-p. £1
ords.
Although the group has a
wide spread of interests
throughout Australia, many of
its activities stem from its early
association with shipping, and
six of the eleven subsidiaries
are shipping-, Customs- or
insurance-agents (in the
southern States and W.A.). The
parent’s investment-portfolio
includes scrip in a number of
stevedoring, salvage and ship-
repairing cos.
The William Crosby group is
as follows:
William Crosby and Co. Pty.
William Crosby and Co. (Tas.)
Pty. (Shipping, insurance and
merchandise.)
William Crosby (Merchandise)
Pty. (Floor and wall tiles, baths,
basins, builders’ hardware and
general merchants, fruit-exporters.)
William Crosby and Co. (N.S.W.)
Pty. (General merchants.)
Wilcrome Industries Pty. (Light
engineering and electroplating.)
Plan Printing and Supplies Pty.
(Sensitized papers and plan-printing.)
Federal Stevedoring Co. Pty.
(Contracting-stevedores.)
Concrete Products Co. Pty.
(Concrete building-materials.)
Frank Hammond Pty.
Frank Hammond (Launceston)
Pty. (Cartage - contractors and
Customs-agents.)
Shanks and Co. Pty. (Sanitary-
ware, wall tiles and plumbing
fittings.)
In 1957-58 the fruit-export-
ing offshoot suffered severe
losses —consequent upon a
strike by London dockworkers
—and group-profit fell as a
result from £74,518 in the
previous year (until then a
record) to £47,235. Last term,
however, all subsidiaries
operated profitably, earnings
were higher than ever before,
and consolidated pre-tax profits
rose £32,155 to £86,460. In-
come from divs., rent, etc.,
increased by £2567 to £27,897,
to give a group net profit of
£79.411 (up £32,176):

Reckoned after providing an
extra £2546 for taxation
(£34,946) and £24,208 (down
£1302) for depreciation, the
profit represents a return of
10.5 p.c. on share-capital, as
against 6.2 p.c. in the preceding
year and 11 p.c. and 9.3 p.c.
back to 1956.
Last term’s better showing is
evidence of return to more
normal trading conditions
rather than an indication of
spectacular achievement. Profit,
though a record, is by no means
exciting. After payment of the
regular 8| p.c. div. it leaves
only £16,411 for reserves,
which, together with capital-
profits (£14,533), and after
deducting note-issue expenses
written-off (£3786), rose in all
£28,277 to £101,536.
Last term William Crosby
lifted theoretical working-
capital £77,756 to £309,207.
The co. completed an issue of
100,000 £1 8 p.c. registered
unsecured notes, and at the
same time further increased its
borrowings on mortgage (up
£16,990 at £203,232). Debtors
were reduced £25,337 to
£204,656, and stocks on hand
fell from £389,344 to £299,162
(down £90,182). Funds intro-
duced were applied in the
main to reduction of the bank-
overdraft and to reduction of
creditors:

Movements of fixed assets were
relatively small. Book-value of

£552,373 ; plant, etc., fell
£4956 to £129,518. During the
year additional shares were
acquired in Ballarat Products,
Ltd. —the erstwhile subsidiary,
Austral Confectionery Co., was
sold to Ballarat Products, Ltd.
in exchange for 48,000 f.-p.
10s. ords. in that co. —and new
showrooms and offices were
erected in Perth for the co.’s
W.A. branch. Shares in other
cos. rose £37,132 to £201,432,
mainly due to the Ballarat
Products deal. Considering the
size of the investment-port-
folio, shareholders might
expect some indication of the
value and nature of their in-
vestments.
As to the future, it is diffi-
cult to envisage anything but
a continuance of present
moderate profit-patterns. Last
year William Crosby (Mer-
chandise) Pty. was formed, to
combine the group’s mer-
chandising activities with those
of exporter T. E. Butler and
Co. Pty. This move has already
facilitated economies in admini-
stration. The Tasmanian sub-
sidiary Frank Hammond Pty.
(cartage - contractors and
Customs-agents) did well last
term and installation of two-
way radio-control in vehicles
and the purchase of specialised
equipment to handle the new
method of transportation of
freight from the mainland (the
new Tasmanian ferry) augur
brighter prospects ahead.
Acquisition of Shanks and Co.
Pty., a few months ago, once
again widens William Crosby’s
field of activities.
In his address the chairman
says, “Figures for the first
quarter of the current year are
sufficient to justify your
directors’ feelings of optimism
for the future.”

Creamoata, Ltd.
Creamoata’s eleventh year as
a Victorian public com-
pany was difficult, in spite of
the fact that its management
appears to be doing the best it
can.
The board shows consider-
able enterprise and initiative,
but the co.’s ss. ords. are
quoted at 4s. 6d., following a
sharp fall in earnings and a
cut in the div.-rate from 6 p.c.
to 5 p.c. The immediate yield
on this basis is 5.6 p.c.
Registered in May, 1932,
Creamoata, Ltd., was converted
to public status in 1948. The
main business-activities are
processing of oats for various
breakfast-foods, flourmilling at
West Footscray (Vic.), and the
manufacture of stock-, pet- and
poultry-foods. Subsidiaries are
Mammy Products Pty. and
Vet-N-Ary Products Pty.
Last summer’s heatwaves in
Victoria killed a considerable
proportion of poultry-flocks.
Severe competition came in the
wake of reduced demand.
Creamoata’s sales of poultry-
foods fell by 17.5 p.c. Keen
market rivalry in this important
line of the co.’s business
resulted in “unprofitable
prices” and severely cut into
earnings.
Oversupply of wheat-flour on
world markets severely affected
export-sales, which tumbled by
55 p.c. below the previous
year’s level. On the other
hand, manufacture of flour for
domestic consumption in-
creased during the year. Pro-
duction of cake-mixes and
self-raising flour also went up
“substantially.” Sales of
packaged-oatmeals in Australia
were described as “record.”
Total sales for the year
ended September 30, 1959, were
£328,189 lower at £1,272,405.
Consolidated gross trading-
profit was down £48,849 at
£255,190. Expenses remained
practically unchanged at
£230,199, including £20,081
depreciation provision (steady).
After setting-aside £4341 for
taxation (down £16,059), con-
solidated net profit was 58.6
p.c. lower at £20,650 (down
£29,260):

The earning-rate on un-
changed average ord. capital
fell from 12.5 p.c. to 5.2 p.c.
(10 p.c! in 1957 and 3.4 p.c.
in 1956). The reduced 5 p.c.
dividend, absorbing £20,000,
was barely covered. The dis-
proportionate decrease in tax-
provision was caused by
increased depreciation allow-
ances.
The co.’s chairman pointed
out that the drastic fall in
earnings was in part caused by
“considerable non - recurring
expenses due to the develop-
ment and marketing of new
products.” These expansion-
costs swallowed £29,414 more
than in the preceding term.
Development of new packet-
products was very intensive and
successful. The new lines “are
now having a marked effect on
turnover.” Sales for the first
month of current term were
said to be 22.9 p.c. above the
corresponding period in 1958.
It was considered essential
to accelerate Creamoata’s
“planned product development
during the year” because of
the severe drop in export earn-
ings. So far 16 new products
have been marketed.
Diversification, caused by
the dwindling of overseas
markets, is continuing.
“Mammy” products (cake- and
pudding-mixes) are now being
“plugged” hard. In addition,
new types of dog-foods are
being offered to domestic
consumers.
Creamoata’s diversification
and expansion-programme re-
quires considerable capital-
outlays. Last term a further
£35,000 was borrowed from
the A.M.P. Society.
Net tangible asset-backing
decreased from 7s. 2d. to 6s. 9d.

Reduced turnover was reflected
in a £50,254 rise in current
stocks. Liquidity position was
tighter, with current liabilities
exceeding current assets by
£27,205. Current ratio was
0.9 to 1.
If the reported encouraging
market reaction to the new lines
continues, Creamoata may
stage a comeback, but any
spectacular improvements in
fortunes and div.-rates seem
unlikely in the immediate
future.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, February 1, 1960
An intermediate start with the
introduction of television
in N.Z. is to be made by the
Government.
The service will be State-
owned and -controlled.
The Prime Minister, Mr.
Nash, who announced the de-
cision, said that because of
the tremendous impact tele-
vision would have on N.Z.’s
economy, the service must
necessarily be introduced on a
gradual basis.
The first step will be to
expand the operations of the
Government’s experimental
station at Auckland. The
station will be developed to a
major 100 k.w. one, patterned
on Perth, it is understood.
This year a beginning will
be made on establishing experi-
mental stations at Wellington,
Christchurch and Dunedin.
Services will at first be non-
commercial. As soon as there
are enough viewers, commercial
programmes will begin.
There will be provision this
year for a “substantial” in-
crease in the manufacture of
sets. The Government will
shortly advise manufacturers of
details.
Eventually there will be
separate commercial and non-
commercial TV-statipns operat-
ing side-by-side, but for some
years, perhaps, till this
development is possible, both
commercial and non-commer-
cial programmes will be
operated by the same station,
either by reserving afternoons
for non-commercial telecasts
and evenings for sponsored
programmes, or vice versa.
The introduction of the ser-
vice will be carried out by the
N.Z. Broadcasting Service.
Later a Director of Television
will be appointed, under the
Minister in Charge of Broad-
casting.
Commenting on the Govern-
ment’s proposals, the Minister
in Charge of Broadcasting, Mr.
Boord, said it was generally
accepted that there must, in
the final analysis, be Govern-
ment control and some form
of Government censorship to
preserve programme and tech-
nical standards and to ensure
the orderly establishment of a
television service. “Only the
State is in a position to control
the availability of the necessary
receivers and the transmissions
and to ensure that any ill-
effects are reduced to a mini-'
mum,” he said.
“With the additional demands
on overseas funds which estab-
lishment of television will
necessitate in the capital, opera-
tional and servicing fields, un-
limited expansion of television
could prejudice our present
buoyant economy. This we
simply cannot afford to do.”
National Party Opposition
The National Party will
vigorously oppose the Govern-
ment’s decision to have the ser-
vice operated and controlled by
the State.
It was “unimaginative
Socialist thinking” to shut-out
private enterprise,” said the
acting-leader of the Opposi-
tion, Mr. Marshall.
“Not only will the capital
cost of a State monopoly fall
on public funds, but the
running-expenses of State tele-
vision are likely to fall heavily
on the public in the form of a
substantial licence-fee, and pos-
sibly on the taxpayers to make
up losses. The exclusion of
private enterprise also ex-
cludes the private capital
resources which would other-
wise be available.”
“By making television a
Government department like
the broadcasting service it
would seem that the Govern-
ment is determined on exer-
cising political control over this
new and most powerful
medium,” said the president of
the Associated Chambers of
Commerce, Mr. P. J. Harris.
Leaders of the radio industry
have called on the Govern-
ment for more information.
They want to know: When
they can have import-licences to
bring in necessary equipment?
How the TV-networks will be
financed? When the pro-
grammes will start in centres
outside Auckland?
Con. Zinc and Aluminium
Described as “the most
important single step in indus-
trial development in the history
of N.Z.,” an agreement
between the Government and
Consolidated Zinc Pty., Ltd.,
of Australia, was signed last
month.
The agreement provides that
within 18 months the company
must complete its preliminary
investigation. Before mid-
-1961 it must advise the Gov-
ernment whether it will proceed
with the project.
If it does, it must, within
the next 10 years, construct a
power-station capable of pro-
ducing continuously—24 hours
a day— at least 100,000 kilo-
watts, This will be as many
units of power as the output
of Karapiro and Whakamaru
combined.
Within the following 20
years this output must be
raised to the full potential of
the area —more than 600,000
kilowatts continuously. This
means that it would be pro-
ducing four times as many
units as Roxburgh without the
agreement committing the
N.Z. Government to capital
expenditure.
At the termination of the
agreement all fixed assets,
[including the tunnels, dams
and powerhouses, will belong
to N.Z.
Clauses . are provided which,
while safeguarding the Crown,
ensure the company such
stable conditions as to
encourage the establishment
and development of a major
industry on a basis for trad-
ing in the markets of the
world.
The ultimate production-
value of a Southland
aluminium-smelting industry
could reach £50,000,000 a
year, according to the Minister
of Works, Mr. Watt.
Even in its early stages the
industry could approach the
total output of Norway’s
aluminium production today.
In its ultimate stage it could
equal the present production
of France and Norway com-
bined.
Major fields for the invest-
ment of capital in the proposal
will be in the harnessing of the
hydroelectric resources of the
southern lakes district to
produce the necessary elec-
tricity, and in the building of
smelters for the processing of
the raw materials used in the
production of aluminium.
The investment in the power-
works and in the smelters
will be up to £150,000,000, and
over the years probably
£50,000,000 will be spent in
payments to N.Z. labor and
possibly a further £20,000,000
to £30,000,000 on N.Z.
materials.
Australian Bauxite
Speaking after the agree-
ment the vice-chairman of
Consolidated Zinc, M- A.
Mawby, said the company was
convinced it was fully justified
in making the investigation.
He pointed out, however,
that at this stage the Mana-
pouri-Te Anau investigation
is one only of three major
power possibilities for alu-
minium production. The
others are the black-coal
resources of the central coastal
region of Queensland and the
waters of the Purari River in
Papua.
“Although the discovery of
bauxite in New Zealand was
recently reported, we have no
idea yet whether this find has
any commercial significance,”
he said. “In our present state
of knowledge the foundation
of large-scale aluminium pro-
duction in Australia and New
Zealand must be the enormous
bauxite deposits in Queens-
land and the Northern
Territory.
“We have sufficient con-
fidence in the future of alu-
minium to believe that it may
be possible for us to avoid
having to make a choice
between Australia and N.Z.
for the establishment of
aluminium-smelting capacity,”
he said.
Forecasts of substantial
aluminium shortages in the
United States of America by
1975 had to be only frac-
tionally correct to provide
opportunities for aluminium-
smelting both in Australia and
N.Z.
But it might be necessary
to decide whether the first
major international aluminium-
smelter should be built in one
country or the other. It
would then be necessary to
weigh in the balance many
factors. As well as the cost
of power, transport costs
would have to be assessed.


Late Final Extra

P iece • • •
All this Darky took-in tip-
toeing noisily into Number
Seven Court. He was wearing
new, Italian-style, pointed-
loe shoes, and although he
was proud of them? the
squealdng irritated him. He
wa& a quiet man> fussy i n
some ways, and he hated un-
necessary noise. His dream
was a httle place about' 50
mi]es out G f t h e city where he
cou]d keep trotters.
Squeak-squeak. Morgan,
the 4 police-prosecutor, gave
him / £ look-half-angry,
ha£f . resi d . or , perhaps, one
thing chasing , he otherj {ast
as a blink. A spark of in-
voluntary anger, instantly
dimmed. Morgan wasn’t a
man to waste emotion on
something outside his control,
and, like it or lump it, he had
to suffer these comings and
goings. Morgan, big, greying,
tough, educated, didn’t really
like reporters, called them, not
quite jovially, “vultures.” Still,
he probably liked Darky as
well as any. Darky was an
old hand around the courts.
Thin, dark, with black
shiny hair parted in the middle
and heavy black eyebrows,
always dressed with a certain
sharp elegance, Darky could
have passed for a rather tall
jockey. There was something
vaguely horsy about him,
something rakish and, at the
same time, sober. Good dark
suit and very white shirt, cuffs
marvellously free of ink and
pencil marks, flaring white
handkerchief in top pocket,
dark-blue tie with tiny red
spots, Italian shoes; patent-
leather hair, furrowed fore-
head, steady hazel eyes, long
nose with a bump in it. He
was 38, fast and accurate at
his work, and if he ever
became agitated it wasn’t
noticeable.
Darky bobbed to the Bench,
slid into a chair at the press-
table, glanced at his com-
panion. It wasn’t Saunders ; it
was young Matthews, irom a
morning paper. Careful as a
cat, Darky plucked up his
trouser-legs, to preserve the
knife-edge creases, arranged
his note-book ana pencils. He
raised his heavy eyebrows, and
Matthews pushed over a copy
of the charge-list, pointing to
a name, third down. Darky
wrote down the name, just in
case, and the charge, break-
enter-and-steal, but he didn't
expect to get anything worth
using. Maybe a brief. De-
pended on what turned-up
later. It was early yet. Half-
past-ten by the court clock.
He wondered what Saunders
was up to. No one was safe
with that scoop - merchant
around. Fortunately he wasn't
around often. Fortunate for
Saunders, too: because other-
wise they could kill him off.
No one man could cover all
these courts, and if Saunders
tried, as a regular round, he
would find himself scooped
every day. The only way it
could work was by pooling
information —that way, no one
was scooped. But Saunders,
coming irregularly, occasionally
pulled off a brilliant coup.
r T''HE prisoner stared at the
opposite wall with un-
flinching blue eyes, chin up,
shoulders squared under the
green pullover; but h e
couldn't control his Adam’s
apple.
Ashgrove, S.M., cradled his
chin in his hand, looked
magesterial, judicial, sleepy. A
night on the tiles?
Darky wondered briefly
about magistrates’ private
lives; like most people’s,
probably. Listening to this
stuff, day after day, would
make anyone tired. Only f° r
thunder and lightning lurking
up there at the Bastille, ready
to roar down at the first slip,
fling a man, seared, into the
street, I’d be asleep half the
time myself. Just put my head
down and doze-off. Only «


1 did it, chances are I’d wake
up with no head.
All the same, it wasn’t too
bad. Better than the Bastille.
Too much brass there ; and
too many brass-polishers.
“Why,” a young fellow had
wanted to know, “do you call
it the Bastille?”
They had looked at him,
Blue and himself. They’d been
having a cup of coffee, had
hardly noticed the boy sitting
at the end of the table. His
name was Thompson, Tom-
linson, something like that,
and he was new. Served his
cadetship on a provincial
paper, came to the city, been
taken on as D or C grade,
made the big-time. Nice open
face, eager eyes. Sincere.
Encouraged, he'd become
dedicated, like that Saunders ;
maybe. On the other hand, he
might get browned-off quickly,
or settle down as one of the
boys; or they might get rid
of him. Anything could hap-
pen in this game.
“Because,” Blue said, smiling
his crooked smile, “It’s a
stronghold of privilege.” Con-
fusing the kid no end; be-
cause, no doubt, he’d been
reading the editorials, all about
democracy, we’re on the side
of the little man, the religion
of a fair go, etc.
All the same, Blue ought
to have had his head read,
talking like that in the cafe-
teria. The kid might be all
right, but that fine old work-
horse George was sitting at
the next table. Anything
George heard went straight to
Monsieur de Paris. Mons.
specialised in the delayed
execution. He’d been known
to go to any amount of
trouble after an “incident” to
reassure someone, build him
up, so that, the victim thought,
everything is all right,
smoothed-over; Mons., after
all, is human, Mons. is my
mate. Mons. is on a hot-seat,
they’d been heard to argue,
these unfortunates; he’s got
El Supremo- on his back, but
he’s been through the mill
himself, knows what it’s like.
He’s doing a dirty and brutal
job, sure ; he has to be hard,
hut underneath he’s not too
had. Asked me to sit down,
gave me a cigarette, talked
man-to-man. Everything is
definitely o.k. this time.
Then—smack! Or, rather,
snick: Or, perhaps, squelch.
Anyway, there was someone
running round like a chook
Mth its head cut-off, yelling
hhie murder, so to speak, and
Mons. walking away with a
ca lm smile. And all the serfs
trembling, every one.
Funny character, Mons. Be-
tween .executions he wrote
sensitive verse, which appeared
now and then in one of the
long-hair journals. 1 Someone
who knew said it was good,
but slight. On his way up
Mons. had disposed of a
number of rivals by a simple
trick: he gave a man a name.
Nothing crude or offensive —-
something like “weary,” or
“vague,” often rhyming with
the surname, so it would stick.
Mons. would use it a few
times, gently, sort of whim-
sically, in front of the top-
brass. In a place like the
Bastille that was generally
enough.
'C'or all its bright lights and
flash-bulbs a-popping and
brightly-smiling girl-reporters
witn showy legs and show-off
behinds, and the not-so-young
ones smiling even more
brightly, and grey old work-
horses like George bumbling
around, and smart young
roosters crowing, and the
clatter and beat of the
machines, the cries of “Boy!
Boy!” from the subs.’ table,
the trucks going out chock-a-
block with late-final-extras,
loads of late-final-extras, one
after the other, take your pick,
all afternoon, every afternoon
bar Sunday—despite all that,
and the over-publicised smell
of printers’ ink, and the
friendly beers at the local, it’s
a place of shadows, the old
Bastille. Take Supremo out of
that fortress, expose him to the
sun, and what would happen?
He’d dissolve.
Although, of course, he
does go out, in his big black
car with the chauffeur in front.
He goes to the races and the
flicks. But that was the strong
impression: a sort of shadow
king (no relation to the grand
old galloper of that name) in
a castle of raucous shadows ;
and the shadows full of knives.
As Blue, no doubt, realised
when he got his piece of paper.
Poor old Blue, up to his
neck in debt with a sick wife
and a new house, he’ll find it
hard to get another job now,
especially now, with a wave of
“integration” going on . . .
Come right down to it,
though, old Blue had bought
it. Build up a reputation for
being bitter and cynical around
the place and you take the
consequences. Almost as
though Blue, in some dark,
twisted way, wanted it to hap-
pen, courted the knife. Blue
had been-gradually cracking-
up ever since he was down-
graded. No, before. Blue was
doing extra-well then, had a
by-line, a following. Tongue-
in-cheek stuff, interviews
with “characters,” “colorful,”
naturally, putting down
exactly what they said. Funny
and cruel. Then it started, a
sort of deep disgust.
One night at the Journo’s
Club, Blue was pretty full,
said he was a realist. That’s
the difference, he said, I face
it, Darky, you don’t. I’m in
it, but I know what I’m doing.
No, I don’t mind making goats
of them, they make goats of
themselves, I only put it down,
reveal them. We’re all goats,
anyway you, me, Mens.,
even Supremo. Maybe
Supremo is the hairiest goat
of all. Only he gets more hay.
No, it’s not that, that doesn’t
worry me at all. But some
things stick in your gizzard—
that business with the kid —
remember? Front-page, very
touching. Worming my way
in with the kid’s family to get
the poignant details, catching
them off balance. Off my beat,
anyway, they put me on it
because I was a good man,
they said, had initiative. A
challenge. That finished me,
fair turned my stomach. But
it only really hit me later,
when I lost my own kid. Made
a dent in me, made me think.
Have another?
He could see Blue’s point
of view. Still, if you were in
this game you were in it. No
use looking too closely at your
bread-and-butter —who did?
Did the silver-tongues? Did
the smart salesmen? There
was a bit of dirt mixed up
with most tucker, come to that.
Blue had tough luck—then he
went out and bought more of
the same.
Maybe, like Blue said, that
incident, with his boy’s death
on top of'it, had made a dent
in him, letting morbidness
seep in. But the grog must
have given him a decent belt,
too. In this game you kept
your eyes open and your
mouth shut, and if you had
any spare time for thinking,
you thought about Number
One.
Tn the dock the fair young
man in the green pullover
seemed to be heading for a
spell of bad luck, too; he
had pleaded not guilty, but the
police evidence was pretty
strong. A man in a dock
looked dehumanised, like an
animal in a cage.
The depositions-clerk sud-
denly threw his arms in the air.
“Speak more slowly,” Mor-
gan said sharply. “Especially
names and addresses.” That
was the second time he had
pulled up the detective.
“Er —sorry,” the young de-
tective said.
He began again, slowly. “I
then proceeded to one-two-
eight Jenkins Street . . .”
“Speak up,” Morgan said
impatiently. “Now your voice
is too low.”
It wasn’t that bad. Morgan
must be in a bad mood.
Darky glanced at his note-
book, at the neat strokes and
hooks, names and addresses
written in longhand. He had
just about all he wanted, now,
except for one thing, which
could be guessed. The value
of the goods stolen wasn’t
great, there were no unusual
features, but it might be worth
sending for the first late-final-
extra.
A detective-sergeant went
into the box, was sworn,
identified himself in a clear,
practised voice. There’d be no
trouble with this bird. He'd
given plenty of evidence.
Darky knew him, didn’t like
him.. He had the plainclothes
stare, cultivated, no doubt, by
young plainclothes-men in
front of mirrors. Every time
Darky encountered it he felt
inclined to laugh—what was
he supposed to do, break down
and confess something? But
he didn’t laugh. Now he
stared back. It always worked.
It wasn’t a good way to make
friends and influence police-
men, and for that reason
Darky very seldom did it, but
it was amusing.
The man in the witness-box
didn’t like it; clothed in
habitual authority, he was
used to people dropping their
eyes before that intimidating
stare. Ordinary people,
conscious of no evil-doing,
did that. Darky had done it
himself. But now he stared
steadily, and there was a secret
battle, while the detective-
sergeant gave evidence
smoothly, clearly, pausing in
the right places. Standing there
in the witness-box, he couldn’t
do anything about it. He
couldn’t very well complain to
the magistrate that a reporter
was looking at him.
The detective-sergeant’s stare
broke. Hell, thought Darky,
I’m getting childish. I really
am. He bent his smooth black
head over the notebook,
doodled, drawing long-legged
trotting horses with necks like
swans and streaming tails.
Ashgrove found a prima
facie case had been made out,
committed the defendant for
trial, Quarter Sessions, glanced
at the clock.
TVarky went out to phone-in
his story.
“Where’s Roger?” Darky


asked when he went into the
press-room.
“In Number Four,” someone
said. “He won’t be long.”
Darky lit a cigarette:
“What’s doing in there? The
Clancy case?”
“Yes.”
Roger bustled in. He was
Darky’s opposite-number, on
an evening paper. They com-
pared notes quickly, and Roger
wrote a lead for the break-
enter-and-steal story, in long-
hand, on a piece of copy-
paper. Darky didn’t bother.
He’d found it better to keep
the story in his head, using the
shorthand notes for reference.
Get into the habit of writing
your leads first and the time
comes when you haven’t time
to do it, then you’re all at
sea . , .
“Ready?” Darky asked.
“Yes.”
They picked up their tele-
phones almost simultaneously,
but Roger’s switch took a
little longer to put him through
to the copy-takers.
Two sent. Darky glanced
at his watch. Ashgrove would
be adjourning soon . . . “Seen
Saunders around?” he asked.
“He was in Number Four
for a while,” Roger said. “I
think he went into One. I’ll
have a look.” He stood up.
Darky frowned thoughtfully.
It looked like a dull day. A
long list of minor traffic-
offences, tenancy and money-
lenders’ matters. A few
assault-females. A couple of
mildly interesting ones com-
ing up in the afternoon . . .
He considered going to the
C.P.S. office, looking over the
depositions-sheets that had
come out from the other courts.
Often something that looked
uninteresting on the charge- or
summons-list turned out to be
newsworthy when you saw the
deps.; a twist of drama, a well-
known name as a witness.
Sometimes, too, a well-known
name didn’t appear on the lists.
That had happened a month
ago ; a D.U.1.; driving under
the influence wouldn’t normally
be front-page news, but this
one was, because of the name.
He’d been awake, and had
caught it. Being awake to
things like that made the differ-
ence between a good court
reporter and a shorthand-
writing technician . . .
He decided he’d look at the
deps. later, at leisure. He
ground-out his cigarette in the
ash-tray, went back into Num-
ber Seven.
“Nothing much,” Matthews
whispered. “Drunks, offensive
behavior. Ashgrove’s been
going through ’em like steam.
He’ll adjourn now.”
A smart, grey-haired woman
was talking to Morgan. Darky
had seen her around the courts
before; she was a social
worker, but this group of
courts wasn’t her regular beat.
Morgan looked at the sheaf of
papers in his hand, looked up
at Ashgrove, thoughtfully
pulled the lobe of his right ear ;
then the two heads bent over
the papers.
Ashgrove sat up straight,
coughed.
“There’s one matter, Your
Worship,” Morgan said. “If it
could be dealt with now . . .”
A shgrove looked at the
clock: “I was about to
adjourn, Sergeant.”
Morgan looked at the clock,
too: “I know time is getting
on. But there are special ...
If this case could be heard,
Your Worship, I can assure
you it won’t take long—l
mean, of course, I think you
will find it can be disposed of
quickly.”
“That’s rather up to me,
isn’t it, Sergeant?”
“Quite.”
Ashgrove hesitated. “Very
well,” he said dryly.
The little door near the dock
opened and a woman walked
in. • She was about 30, pale,
the pallor emphasised by a
black-silk dress. She had a
splendid neck and firm white
shoulders, Darky noticed, a
rather broad face and a wide
mouth. Brown wavy hair. A
plainclothes-man joined the
group, drifted away.
Morgan said something to
the second woman. She took
a few diffident steps in the
direction of the dock, stopped,
turned around. She stood
facing the court, but not look-
ing at it, head slightly bent,
hands clasped in front of her,
white, well-kept hands locked
against the black background
of the silk dress.
Morgan began talking, still
looking at the papers: “The
defendant” mumble “is
charged with vagrancy. She
had no money when ques-
tioned by the police, and no
employment. She came from
Adelaide six months ago and
when . . .” He looked up,
stopped. “Well?” he said
testily.
“TTie name,” the depositions-
clerk said apologetically. “I
didn’t catch the name,
Sergeant.”
Neither did I, Darky thought.
What are you up to, Morgan?
Morgan repeated the name.
Darky wrote it down.
“No fixed place of abode,”
Morgan continued. Ashgrove
looked at him thoughtfully
under heavy lids. Morgan
walked towards the Bench,
lowered his voice. “.The police,
of course, suspect that she had
been living immorally. How-
ever, there is no evidence con-
cerning that. The position is
this, your Worship. Her hus-
band, a man of standing in
Adelaide, wants her back,
wants to take her back to
Adelaide by plane tonight, in
fact . . .”
The social worker leaned
over and whispered and
Morgan’s voice trailed off.
“I beg your pardon, your
Worship,” Morgan said. “I
understand the husband has
not come over himself, but he
has sent the plane-fare and
other money to cover expenses.
He is willing, I understand
anxious, to have her back. The
police have no objections,
your Worship.”
The woman looked up, and
Darky saw her eyes for the
first time. They were large
and blue, a brilliant and vivid
blue. Something about them
startled him. For a moment
they clashed with, almost
dominated, the dingy dignity of
the court. Then she looked
down, and was just another
figure in the mean procession,
a name on a charge-list. Papers
rustled. Morgan beckoned im-
periously to a uniformed con-
stable in leggings. Ashgrove
cleared his throat.
T>ack in the press-room
Matthews asked Darky if
he intended to use the story.
Darky didn’t answer. “I’m
not,” Matthews continued. “If
you don’t, that is.”
Darky nodded absently. He
was thinking about the
woman’s eyes, wondering about
the woman. That black dress
looked expensive ... If the
husband wanted her back, why
hadn’t he come over to get
her?
“Nothing in it for us,”
Matthews persisted. “Nothing
happened, no conviction
recorded. All the same, I bet
there’s a story there, some-
where.”
But how to get it? As for
what had been said in court,
that only whetted curiosity.
That would be the way to do
it, of course, a little color-
piece. That sort of thing was
right up Saunders’s alley.
“What’s that? What’s there
a story in?” Carruthers, a
police roundsman from Darky's
paper, lifted his beefy face
from the phone. What was
Carruthers doing here?
“None of your business,”
Darky said lightly. He was
sitting on the table, looking
out through the open door at
the crowd of people waiting to
be called. Civil actions, ten-
ancy cases, people on bail.
Solicitors dodging around im-
portantly, some Vice Squad
detectives chatting with three
women, as though this were a
social occasion. An elderly
couple sitting on a wooden
bench, the woman twisting a
big handbag, the man staring
straight ahead. A study in
anxiety.
“O.k. Be mysterious. Hullo,
hullo!” Carruthers shouted
into the phone. He usually
shouted.
But, after all, why use it?
Matthews said he wasn’t going
to use it, and Matthews wasn't
a liar. All right for Matthews,
working on a morning paper.
He could wait and see what
appeared in the afternoon
papers. On an afternoon, if
you missed the last edition
you’d had it. Saunders was
on an afternoon paper, Roger’s,
and Saunders liked something
off-beat, with a twist in it. If
Saunders got on to it and he
missed it . . . You could
make a deal with the regular
roundsmen but not with
Saunders. It might be safer
to send something, in case
Saunders picked it up on the
deps. later . . .
“Anyone seen Saunders?”
Darky asked.
“He was in Seven a while
back,” Roger said.
“Seven? No he wasn’t,”
Darky said. “At least —I
didn’t see him.”
Roger shrugged. “I thought
I saw him going in there.
Could have been mistaken, of
course. Perhaps he just
looked in, went out again.”
“Unless he was sitting at
the back,” Darky said slowly.
He turned to Matthews. “Did
you see him, Ted?”
“No.”
“Saunders?” someone said.
“He left early. He’s gone to
the do at the Town Hall.”
Carruthers was having
trouble with h s connection,
still shouting. The press-room
was crowded. In the corner a
solicitor with a large criminal
practice was telling a story.
The story was interesting to
anyone who followed the
courts, but every second word
was obscene. Darky watched
the long, clever, boozy face,
wondered why: Does h e
always talk like that, or is it
for our benefit, sort of coming
down to our level? He neednt
bother.
His companion was younger,

plump, precise, a barrister, a
coming man. The barrister,
too, thoroughly understood the
value of a good press, but he
affected to despise it —in his
ov vn circle, around the clubs,
ge couldn’t very well get
away with that here, hanging
around the press-room, prac-
tically begging for a mention,
ge was here on the Clancy
case. The Clancy case looked
like going on for a long time.
Carruthers had got on to
whoever it was he had wanted.
Something about a lost dog, a
bull-terrier answering to the
name “Cobber,” the property
of someone who was a great
friend, “a great personal
friend,” of Detective-sergeant
Jack Someone. All cars to
co-operate. Something like
that.
What had brought that
woman here on a vag. charge?
Drink? Drugs? Sex?
An auburn-haired girl was
sitting on the bench outside.
Her name was Pam Burgell,
she was 19, and she was a
prostitute.
She had a superb figure and
a pointed face which was as
near to beauty as the face of
any woman Darky had seen,
and she was the property of
Stevie Carmichael, now doing
seven years’ hard. She had
been faithful to him in her
fashion —and his—since she
was 17. All this was common
knowledge.
Dam was smoking, talking to
A a battered blonde called
Lola. She was wearing a blue
dress, which was tight, and she
wore no stockings. She turned
her head, and her dark eyes
stared at Darky coolly. Old
eyes in a fresh young face.
Lola leant forward and said
something. Pam nodded, still
staring.
Darky flinched from a hearty
smack on the back, scowled up
at Carruthers’ grinning face.
“Got your eye on our Pam,
eh?” Carruthers said. He
made a coarse remark, which
Darky resented. He didn’t
like that line of chatter, never
had, and he didn’t like the
suggestion that a girl like Pam
could attract him. Because
she didn't. If he saw her out-
side, didn’t know her record,
perhaps . . . But, as it was, he
Wouldn’t touch her with a 40-
foot pole. Not knowing the
crowd she knocked around
with . . .
“Go chase dogs,” Darky
said tersely.
“Better than perving on
pros.,” Carruthers said,
chuckling. He gave him
another smack on the back.
Darky said quietly: “Keep
your greasy paws off me or
I’ll flatten you.”
“Touchy, eh?”
Carruthers said it easily, but
the grin faded. He’s half-
scared, Darky thought. He’s
bigger than me, could beat me
without raising a sweat, the
shape I’m in now, but he
remembers I did a lot of pug-
ging way back and there’s a
doubt in his mind . . . Good.
“Just remember it,” Darky
said arrogantly.
Carruthers hesitated, flushed:
“All right, little man.” He
turned abruptly, walked x>ut
of the room.
“I don’t like him,” Darky
said into the silence, by way
of explanation. He lit another
cigarette and noticed that his
fingers were trembling slightly.
“He’s a copper,” Roger said.
“They get that way on
police rounds sometimes,”
Matthews said. “He’ll be up-
hill if your paper switches its
policy, Darky.”
“I’ll say,” Roger said. “By
the way, Darky—l forgot to
tell you. Blue was looking
for you.”
“Blue?” Darky was sur-
prised. “Here?”
“Yes. Said he’d see you at
lunch-break, at the corner.
Poor old Blue, that was
rough.”
Rough, right enough, Darky
agreed. There was a moment’s
silence, as though they were
attending Blue’s funeral,
broken by the solicitor. If he
talked like that outside he’d be
up on an indecent-language
charge . . .
“Well,” Darky said. He
looked at his watch. “They’re
racing.” He put out his
cigarette, slid off the table.
TTe sent another story before
lunch-break, then met
Blue. Blue looked seedy.
Darky ordered a middy for
Blue, a squash for himself.
He’d been a drinking man until
18 months ago, when he cut
it out because of the ulcer. It
had been playing-up again, he
told Blue, sipping his squash.
Blue nodded dully ; he wasn’t
interested in Darky’s ulcer,
had other things on his
mind . . .
Old Herb joined them, full
of reminiscences. Herb had
been a court-reporter for 50
years or so, had been pen-
sioned-off a couple of years
ago, liked to hang around the
old haunts. Neither a drink
nor a bot, in fact a very
decent old boy, Herb was still
a bit of a nuisance. He in-
sisted on buying a round,
which meant Darky would
have to stay for that one, and
buy another, and so would
Blue. Darky didn’t like squash
that is, not about the other,
heard most of the stories.

The Treasurer Takes a look Round
PROGRESS REPORT
The “Treasury Information Bulletin”
issued by the Commonwealth
Treasury from time to time is in
the nature of a progress report
on national finances.
It doesn't confine itself to Treasury
income and outgoings, but traverses a
wide field of financial and economic
activities. It is as though the master
of the household were to draw up a
statement of his financial position and
amplify it by giving details of the cash
and credit transactions of all other mem-
bers of his family, plus any useful infor-
mation he had been able to garner of
the business activities of the people
across the road, in the next street, and,
indeed, anyone whose affairs remotely
affect his own.
The result is a compendium of facts
and figures which is much more interest-
ing than a mere balance-sheet.
T. 1.8. No. 17 covers the six months
July-December, 1959, and it shows the
finances of the head-of-the-household to
be fairly buoyant. Receipts from every
section of Commonwealth revenue were
in excess of the corresponding figures
for July-December, 1958, and on those
revenue items for which collections are
more or less evenly distributed over the
year there seems little likelihood that
the Budget estimates will not be exceeded.
Income-tax, at £148.5 million for the
six months, is only £5 million ahead of
last year, although the estimate for the
full year calls for £663.9 million, against
the previous year’s £608.7 million. How-
ever, collections from companies and
from individuals subject to provisional
tax are expected to be higher in the
second half of this financial year than
for January-June, 1959, and pay-as-you-
earn taxes should also be higher, thanks
to the rise in the basic wage and margins.
Total receipts of Consolidated
Revenue Fund were £515.6 million
(£33.1 million higher than in the first
half of 1958-59) and total expenditure
£667.1 million (£51.8 million above
1958-59). Chief increases in expenditure
were defence, £8.5 million ; payments
to the States, £11.9 million; social ser-
vices, £9 million ; capital works, £6.9
million (including an increase of £4.5
million on the Snowy Mountains pro-
ject); business undertakings, £3.9 million.
The combined, transactions of Con-
solidated Revenue Account and
Loan Account showed an overall cash
deficit of £167.1 million for the period.
A drop in the Commonwealth Govern-
ment's bank-balances accounted for
£15.6 million of this. The rest was
financed as to £l2B million by Treasury
bills and as to £23.5 million by Seasonal
Treasury Notes with a currency of three
months, a form of borrowing used this
year for the first time. The overall cash
deficit of £167.1 million compares with
a deficit of £159.1 million for the corre-
sponding period of last year.
Turning to the finances of other mem-
bers of the family, the T. 1.8. notes that
the total revenue of the States was £3lO
million, or £23.6 million higher than in
the previous period. Expenditure, at
£336.5 million, was £16.9 million higher,
so that there was a net improvement in
the revenue-fund operations of the States
of £6.7 million. Both revenue and ex-
penditure were higher in every State
except Queensland, where both items
were fractionally lower. Net expenditure
from loan-funds was £74 million, com-
pared with £66.4 million in the same
period the previous year. Expenditure
from this source rose in four States,
dropping in N. S. Wales and Westralia.
T ooking over the family fence at
friends and neighbors, the T. 1.8.
remarks that the volume of money at
the disposal of the public—notes and
coin in their hands and deposits wilh
the trading- and savings-banks—increased
by 6.5 per cent, between June and
December, 1959. In the same period of
1958 the increase was four per cent.
The main reason for this difference was
that both international reserves and the
outstanding advances of the major
trading - banks increased during the
period ; in the earlier term they fell.
Particulars of new capital-raisings for
the December quarter were not available
when the report was issued, but in the
September quarter the public found
£56.3 million of new money for the
capital-funds of companies listed on Aus-
tralian Stock Exchanges. Of this, £8.9
million went for new share-issues and
£47.4 million represented fixed-interest
notes and debentures. The correspond-
ing figures for the, September, 1958,
quarter were £ll.l million and £3B
million.
In the hire-purchase field the balances
outstanding on h.-p. agreements at the
end of November, 1959 (the latest avail-
able statistics) totalled £385 million,
which was £56 million more than at the
end of November, 1958. New retail h.-p.
agreements financed in the five months
July-November totalled £121.8 million.
Compared with the same five months of
the previous year the amount financed
for motor-vehicles rose by £12.7 million
(to £87.1 million) and for machinery
and plant by £O.B million (to £6.7
million). For household and personal
goods the sum involved dropped by £1.9
million (to £2B million).
These figures set the Treasury stati-
\ stician musing on how his friends
and neighbors spent their money. He
found that 266,990 new motor-vehicles
had been registered during the year 1959,
an increase of 12.3 per cent, on 1958.
There were increases in every type of
vehicle, but the most striking rises were
in station-wagons (64.9 per cent.) and
panel-vans (41.3 per cent.). New regis-
trations rose progressively in each
quarter of 1959, the figure for the
December quarter being 80,502.
Retail sales of goods increased by 6.1
per cenr. in the September quarter (the
latest for which figures are available),
South Australia showing the biggest in-
crease (11.1 per cent.) and Tasmania
the smallest (1.7 per cent.). Breaking
this down into commodity-groups, the
biggest increases were in electrical goods
(10.6 per cent.), furnishings (9.7 p.c.),
food (6.6 p.c.) and clothing (6.4 p.c.).
In the September quarter the number
of radio-listeners’ licences in force de-
clined for the first time (by 6000). The
decline was accelerated in the December
quarter, with a further drop of 11,000.
In the same two periods TV-licences
increased by 77,000 and 83,000 respec-
tively.
t
'Two of the most important items
affecting the Treasurer’s friends and
neighbors are housing and employment.
In the September quarter the estimated
value of new buildings commenced was
£l3O million, the highest figure ever
recorded. The number of new houses
and flats commenced in the September
quarter was 21,918, slightly higher than
in the September quarter, 1958, and the
number completed was 22,143 (20,530
in 1958). Commencements of “other
buildings” also increased in the Septem-
ber quarter and the number of persons
employed in the building industry at the
end of September was 124,407, an in-
crease of more than 10,000 in a year.
The overall employment position
improved during 1959. At the end of
November the total number of persons
in civilian employment was 2,973,000,
an increase of 68,100 since November,
1958. The increase was almost evenly
distributed between male and female
workers, and was most marked in the
manufacturing industry (up 31,400),
commerce (up 9200), and edufation (up
8200). The only sections to show a down-
turn were mining (down 1600) and trans-
port (down 200). At December 31, 1959,
there were 22,469 persons receiving
unemployment benefit (a decline of 5096
for the year) and 58,299 persons regis-
tered for employment (a drop of 6379).
As against this there were 37,516 unfilled
jobs available at the Commonwealth
Employment Service, a rise ol 11,795.
On surface indications things seem to
be going reasonably well for the
Treasurer’s friends and neighbors. They
should at least be able to weigh-in with
enough sales-tax, income-tax, petrol-tax,
payroll-tax, etc., to meet his Budget
estimates this year. Their long-term
prospects aren’t so clearly indicated.
These depend on factors not listed m
the T. 1.8., notably whether they can
increase their productivity fast enough
to keep pace with their rising incomes.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Todman, and Others
Hardly anybody at Fleming-
ton backed Todman in last
Saturday’s five-furlongs w.-f.-a.
Lightning Stakes —the average
punter wouldn’t lay 6 to 1 on
the sun rising—but everybody
joined in the acclaim after his
effortless win.
Now a five-year-old, Tod-
man is a sweet mover, yet
there is about his action a hint
of doggedness that would
stand him well if any horse
gave him a real fight for a
race —not likely in his Mel-
bourne campaign. On Satur-
day Sellwood gave him no
more encouragement than a
slight loosening of the reins
over the final furlong, yet Tod-
man made hacks of smart
horses in Gay Port and
Anonyme. On a track slightly
deadened by rain he easily ran
59 {.
His win was his ninth from
11 starts, and took his earn-
ings close to £lB,OOO. He will
add to that in the Futurity
Stakes and the C. M. Lloyd
Stakes, the other two races on
his Melbourne programme.
His owner, English resident
Stanley Wootton, will see him
run in the Futurity—and who
would not like to swop places
with Wootton?
Todman may not race be-
yond this season —he is an
entire and will join his sire at
Barramul Stud, his sire being,
of course, the great Star
Kingdom. He will go there
with the reputation of being
perhaps the finest sprinter the
Australian Turf has ever
known.
• • • •
Allowing that the field is the
10-furlongs Blarney Stakes was
far short of w.-f.-a. class, it
was still a shock to see Wool
Man win. At his previous start
he’d finished 11th in moderate
handicap company; but that
has been his way all along—
an occasional good run mixed
with some shockers. The Stakes
Was a staying-test for two good
sprinters, Prince Lea and La
Josephina. Prince Lea, with
Sellwood aboard, ran second,
hut it’s hard to understand
why his conections want to
turn a class sprinter into a
stayer. La Josephina certainly
cannot stay ; she was a dismal
last. There is a woeful lack
of stayers in Melbourne up to
w.-f.-a. standard, and the
scale events during the autumn
will be a gift for any class
horse brought here.
Nilarco is very nearly as
good a three-year-old as Vic-
toria can boast; perhaps
Dhaulagiri is better, but there
is. not much in it. At the
V.R.C.’s spring meeting last
year Nilarco won the Carnival
Handicap and the Batman
Stakes like a good horse. On
Saturday, racing second-up
“Watch his right hand!”
after the spell that followed
those wins, he gave a stylish
performance to win the 10-
furlongs Fentona Handicap.
His owners, R. A. Cappey and
wife, think Nilarco may win
the rich Sydney Cup next
Easter, and more unlikely
things could happen. One does
not think of Nilarco’s sire,
Nilo, as a sire of stayers, but
he did get Pride of Egypt,
winner of the V.R.C. Derby,
and everything Nilarco has
done suggests he will manage
two miles comfortably. His
dam is Redeswood.
• • • •
An interesting aspect of Mel-
bourne racing this season has
been the rise of trainer Brian
Courtney from comparative
obscurity to the front rank.
He’s had a wonderful run
with a smallish but high-class
team, including My Peak,
Small Time and Dhaulagiri.
Now he has a very good two-
year-old in Liqueur, a lightly-
raced colt by Good -Brandy
from Sweet Diane. After two
unsuccessful starts, he broke
through for a win at Moonee
Valley on the Australia Day
holiday, and followed-up on
Saturday with a narrow, but
impressive, win in the six-
furlongs Criterion Handicap.
Liqueur was bred by his owner,
M. Lord, who now has his
sights on the autumn classics
in Melbourne and Sydney. It’s
a bit early for such lofty
plans, but Liqueur is worth
remembering.
Present writer does not think
summer is any time for
jumping-races; still, Sundial’s
easy win in the Fulham Hurdle
should be worth remembering.
Royal Somme’s win (on a
protest) in the- 12-furlongs
Brookside Handicap added
another to the remarkable
number of horses that win the
same race in successive years.
The Old gelding has struck such
a purple patch of form —he
won at Caulfield the previous
week—that he may revive
Ossie Porter’s dwindled interest
in racing.
* * *
Sydney Horses
First five races at the A.J.C.’s
meeting at Randwick on the
Anniversary holiday Monday
went to four favorites in a row,
and then an equal-favorite—
Game Trail, Delnita, Wenona
Girl, Travel On and Happy
Kingdom, the latter three giving
Sellwood a hat-trick.
Delnita, deserving the win
for consistent placegetting,
humped 9.3, a tidy enough load
for a two-year-old filly, but the
champion of that age, Wenona
Girl, had to cart 9.8, which is
coming it a bit heavy. The Girl
won easily, as she had in her
only three previous starts, but
lumping that sort of weight
around -now often catches up
with youngsters in the spring or
later. Still, this fine stamp of
filly by Wilkes (Fr.) from
Golden Chariot looks sound
enough to prove an exception.
Happy Kingdom’s 'win in the
seven-furlongs Australia Day
Handicap was also a fourth in
a row —not runaway wins like
Wenona Girl’s, but each against
slightly better company than
the preceding lot. He’s another
of the seemingly countless good
ones by Star Kingdom (imp.).
By way of a change, punters
lined along the paddock en-
closure and gave cheers for
him and Sellwood and owner
Adolf Basser.
• • •
Monday’s run of favorites at
Randwick had a repeat at
Saturday’s meeting at Canter-
bury Park: five more got home
in an eight-event programme,
as well as an equal-favorite and
a second-elect. The only horse
to win at odds longer than
3 to 1 was Lilmari at sevens,
and it was this three-year-old’s
first success. Breeding is by
Rego (imp.) from Sweet Brue
by Brueghel (It.) from Mil-
rania by Magpie (imp.).
• • • •
There was also another
fourth-in-a-row at the Canter-
bury Saturday meeting, Merry
Polly just getting up in time
from a long way back to land
her fourth successive race. It
was altogether an exceptionally
fine win—she didn’t look to
have the ghost of a chance of
catching the speedy Perth-
owned Olympiad in the Flying.
At time of writing there was
talk of both the winner and
Olympiad going down to have
a shot at the Oakleigh, in
which the Challenge Stakes
winner would meet Merry

Polly more favorably. Still,
she’s a pretty good one.
• • • •
Another of the consistent,
Royal Perception, winner of
the Canterbury Park Handicap,
made his recent record two
wins from four starts inside a
month. He has no particular
autumn mission up to date, but
he’s a good useful handicapper.
Turkestan (runner-up) ran his
best race since winning the
1958 Epsom. He gallops fast
in training, and maybe will
soon score.
• • • •
Alpine Hero and Sonar King,
both winners at Canterbury in
what was a last run for each
of them in Graduation class,
should now quickly score in
better company ; they should
especially be worth noting for
Welters. Sonar King, who
made his tally three successive
stylish wins in restricted com-
pany, is to be kept for the
easier races in Sydney instead
of aiming at the high spots in
Melbourne. Alpine Hero —a
four-year-old entire —has had
at least 20 wins so far, mostly
at country fixtures, and all in
sprints or scampers.
Friendless in betting at 100
to 1, three-year-old Sandgate
handed out a promising effort
when third to Alpine Hero. By
Nullabor (imp.) and from Tre-
gazza by Le Grand Due (Fr.),
he looks an early winner.
Persian Lyric (at 7 to 2 on)
had no trouble in beating Del-
nita and the other two starters
in the open event for two-
year-olds. His time, 1.13 9/10,
was less than one second out-
side the race record, and this
brother to Prince Darius looks
a potential classic winner.
Due to tackle the class two-
year-olds in Melbourne in the
coming weeks, he’s a typical
Persian Book colt, as hand-
some as any present Sydney
youngster,
• •; • , •
Randwick trainer J. W.
Cook, who landed the Two-
year-old Handicap with Persian
Lyric, bagged the Welter with
Rose of Persia, another of the
Persian Books. She, too, has
been most consistent, but this
time she only just scrambled
home by a short neck from
Troy, who hasn’t won since
1958 ; he raced a little wide at
the top of the straight. Sea
Hound was a close third.
At her second run with the
colors up Marchesa stylishly
won the Novice for two-year-
olds at the Canterbury Park
midweek meeting, beating the
favorite. Royal Emblem, and
Play over the six furlongs in
good time for the track. A
final bid of 750gns. for the
filly at the Randwick yearling-
sales last April was declined
by the Woodlands Stud Farm
Pty., and, trained by T. J.
Smith, she’s being raced by a
partnership of five. She’s by
Newtown Wonder (imp.) from
The Countess by Le Grand
Due (Fr.) from Night Chance
by The Night Patrol.
Sydney’s autumn round this
year promises to be one of the
most interesting for many
seasons, and from now on the
best gallopers will be reappear-
ing after their spell. One of
them, Macdougal, had a run in
the Flying at Canterbury
Park last Saturday. Starting at
any old odds, he beat a couple
home, after being last into the
straight. Comte De Paris,
Travel Boy, Supertax, Flash
Gem, Bardshah and Caybros
will all soon be back, needing
a run or two before showing
best form. Bardshah has grown
a little, has filled out well, and
has been working nicely at
Rosebery.

“A.C.T.”: It won’t be many
years before the setting of one
of the scenes of the play “My
Fair Lady” will need redesign-
ing. A new £l-million stand is
to be built at Royal Ascot, with
280 private boxes, private
dining-rooms, totes and bars,
as well as escalators to carry
people at the rate of 6000 an
hour. Below the boxes there’ll
be tip-up seats for 1800 punters,
and there’ll be room for a
further 8000 on the terrace.
The stand will replace the old
one, and will be built between
the meeting in July this year
and Royal Ascot in June next
year.

Inter-Dominion
The third series of heats in
the Inter-Dominion Cham-
pionship drew a crowd of
28,553 to Harold Park last
Saturday night, but results
somewhat clouded the issue for
the final, with favorites False
Step, Caduceus and Apmat
finishing respectively fourth,
fifth and second to Brilliant
Moon, Maestro’s Melody and
Guiseppe. Breaking badly at
the start, False Step, from
36yds. behind, lost at least
another 36yds., but recovered
brilliantly to finish a close
fourth and gain three points
for fastest time. Seven N.S.W.
pacers have qualified for the
final, two from New Zealand,
one from Western Australia
and one from Victoria. Due
to have a go at the £15,600
are First Kiss (N.S.W.),
Guiseppe (N.S.W.), Brilliant
Moon (N.S.W.), Ross Lawn
(N.S.W.), Meadowlands
(N.S.W.), Kiwi Dillon (W.A.)
and Maestro’s Melody (Vic.)
on scratch ; Apmat and Fettle
(N.S.W.) on 12yds.; Caduceus
and False Step (N.Z.) on 36yds.
The last N. S. Wales horse to
win an Inter-Dominion was
Springfield Globe, who scored
at Launceston (Tas.) in 1939.
The final (13 furlongs 98yds.)
will be run next Saturday night
at Harold Park Raceway, plus
two Consolation events for
horses that failed to qualify.

Other Sports
The mayhem during the
second Test in Trinidad made
the score one spot of “bottle-
throwing” and what-have-you
on each of the last two tours
of the West Indies by an Eng-
lish Test team. Each time a
run-out decision against a local
started the hullabaloo.
The guided-glassware on
England’s 1953-54 tour was
launched during the Bourda
(British Guiana) Test, when
McWatt, the West Indies
’keeper (a Guianese), was given
out. (Singh, the decision
against whom set off this year’s
brawl, is from Trinidad.)
Leaving “sport” out of it,
there’s probably something of
racial and political motives,
but perhaps most important is
the betting that takes place
on different aspects of every
cricket-match played in the
Indies. Anyway, there’s
enthusiasm recalling the
fourth Test between Australia
and the West Indies at Bridge-
town, Barbados, in May, 1955,
when West Indian John Holt
dropped two catches which
proved expensive misses, and
had a bottle aimed at him
(which he did catch!). Next
day placards appeared around
the ground: “How can they
hang Hylton and leave Holt?”
—alluding to a former West
Indian fast-bowler due to hang
that day for murder.
However you look at it
you wouldn’t say cricket was
dying over there.
“Cricket”: The temperature
was over the 100, but out at
Hurstville (Sydney) Oval dusky
cricketers from Fiji laughed
and raced their way around the
ground as lusty hitters from a
St. George XI pasted their
bowling. In one hitting-session
big Sydney policeman Ray
Flockton thrice hit the ball out
of the oval. Each time a bare-
footed fieldsman vaulted the
brick fence after it. “Stay there
and you’ll catch him!” roared
the skipper. We should see
more of this type of cricket.
The Fijians brought vigor and
life into the game, emulating
their footballer predecessors
whose spectacular play helped
start bringing the crowds back
to Rugby Union.

The two Sheffield Shield
games played over the Australia
Day weekend were both first-
innings affairs. In Sydney Vic-
toria beat N.S.W. by 133 ; in
Adelaide S.A. finished 43
ahead of W.A. Rain interfered
with both games ; in Adelaide
play was washed out on Aus-
tralia Day. Without the rain
the Westralians, whose innings
slumped from 1-150 on Satur-
day night to all out for 295,
would probably have won, and
probably the wet deprived Vic-
toria of an outright (in the
earlier Melbourne game Vic.
defeated N.S.W. outright by
214).
On his showing for Vic. in
the Sydney match young North-
cote all-rounder John Wild-
smith looked the makings of a
future international. He
bowled his left-arm spinners
well and batted with plenty of
promise in a first-innings stand
of 93 with Maddocks.
“K.R.”: Jeff Prell, vice-
captain of the Australian Old
Collegians team which had a
successful overseas tour last
year, is one of the outstanding
players in Goulburn (N.S.W)
cricket. In three recent suc-
cessive innings he made two
centuries and a 203 not-out


start the (fay right]

(out of a score of 2-348). The
Saturday after his double-
century, on an admittedly bad
wicket, he took 5-3 with his
jeft-arm spinners, and the next
week 7-44. Prell, a member of
a well-known land-owning
family, lately led Goulburn in
the game against the Fijians.
Another team of Old Collegiams
is going overseas this year.
From “Bob-Ray”:
The Australian tennis champion-
ships at Brisbane made many new
entries in the record-book; among
them:
It was the first time two juniors
contested the women’s singles final
—Margaret Smith (17) and Jan
Lehane (18).
Margaret Smith in winning the
title became the youngest player
ever to do so.
It was the first time two left-
hand players contested the men’s
“Hey, Joe! Swing-over that bag of prawns and a hook !”
singles final —Neale Fraser and Rod
Laver. In winning, Rod Laver won
his first major title —only the second
Queensland player to win the men’s
national singles championship.
Edgar (“Gar”) Moon was the other
—exactly 30 years ago.
, Will Coglan won the junior boys’
sjngles title and achieved a brother-
sister record in national junior
singles—his sister Lorraine won the
junior girls’ championship of 1956.
Odd aspect of the play was that
the women’s championship winner,
Margaret Smith, lost the junior title,
beaten by Lesley Turner.
The one deserving the
heartiest handout of plaudits
°ver the result in the Aus-
tralian women’s singles cham-
pionship is unquestionably
N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Associa-
tion secretary Vic Kelly. In
tvinning, Margaret Smith repre-
sented Victoria, but actually
both she and runner-up Jan
Lehane are N.S.W. products,
by birth and in their tennis.
Margaret hailed originally
from Albury (which is near
enough to Vic. for it not to
matter much) and Jan from
Bathurst; but it’s in their
tennis that the N.S.W. label
counts. Both of them are
products of the schools coach-
ing scheme that Vic Kelly has
worked into shape over the
past 20-odd years. They’re
both of the same vintage, too ;
and however far Jan’s attri-
bute of dogged courage may
take her, it looks a safe bet
that stylish tennis will take
Margaret right to the top —
at Wimbledon. Meantime, Vic
Kelly’s scheme seems certain
to go on producing other good
ones, and, what’s more, train-
ing such country players as
this pair—and, of course, the
crops of country youths also—
up to meeting and beating the
best.

“R.Y.”: Brisbane doctor
Tony Blue put further emphasis
on his claim for Olympic repre-
sentation when he smashed
both his own Australian
records for 880yds. and 800-
metres at a twilight meeting on
the Queensland University oval
a week or two back. Blue
clipped .6sec. off his 880yds.
time of lmin. 48.65ec., and
.ssec. off his 800-metre record
of lmin. 48.4 sec. His lmin.
47.95ec. meant that he broke
the Olympic qualifying time by
I.3sec.

“Sprinter”: Marlene
Mathews (Mrs. Willard) and
Betty Cuthbert, having a shot
at beating the world sprint
record for 60-metres (7.3), will
be striving to cut down the
time of a woman whose record
in sprinting is unsurpassed—
Polish-born Stanislava Wala-
siewiczowna, who made the
record at Lwow in 1933. She
will be best remembered as
Stella Walsh, who subsequently
competed for America. In her
career, which started around
1926 and ended more than
22 years later, Stella Walsh won
seven American 200-metres
titles, and in all, despite several
seasons in Europe, she col-
lected 36 American champion-
ships. She won the Olympic
100-metres in 1932 (11.9) and
in 1930 became the first woman
to run 100yds. in less than 11-
sec. ; she clocked 10.8 at Phila-
delphia, but officials refused to
accept the time. Five years
later Helen Herring Stephens
also ran 10.8, but it was not
till “Fanny” Blankers-Koen,
the “Flying Dutchwoman,”
timed 10.8 at Amsterdam in
1944 that a sub-1 lsec. for
100yds. was internationally
recognised. Australians Mar-
jorie Jackson, Shirley Strick-
land, Betty Cuthbert and
Marlene Mathews have all
whittled the time down, Shirley
Strickland doing the sprint in
10.3.

“Vintage”: In designing the
swimming-pool for the 1962
Empire Games, Perth’s
authorities decided to have its
greatest depth in the centre —
not at one end, as with most
pools these days. So spectators
will all have an excellent view
of the diving at the Perth
meeting. Perth has turned the
clock back to 1924. That year
Sydney's Dick Eve dived from
a fifth-floor balcony into the
centre of the pool in Paris —
and won the title. It’s many
years since an “old type” pool
has been built in Australia.
* * *
“Red Light”: It could pay
23-year-old Sydney athlete
Albert Thomas to remember
that when he went to England
with the 1958 Empire Games
team he ran a world-record
race in Ireland before the
Games took place, and was
beaten in the event he was sent
for. This year Thomas ran
an under-four-minutes mile,
and 10 days later failed in a
shot at breaking his own world
two-mile record. Expert ver-
dict was that he hadn’t
recovered properly from the
mile effort —just as he hadn’t
recovered in Wales.

“K.A.R.”: Surprised to learn
from “Sam” (B. 20/1/’6O) that
N.S.W. boys’ schools do not
play basketball! When I was
being trained as a high-school
teacher at Sydney Teachers’
College in 1950 basketball and
softball were the two sports
which dominated our physical-
training periods. I suspect that
most N.S.W. country high-
schools have boys’ basketball-
teams ; certainly those at
Dubbo, Wellington and
Mudgee have them. I know of
no Sydney school playing Aus-
tralian Rules at the present
time, but a few years ago
several junior technical schools
experimented with'it —the Aus-
tralian Rules people providing
the boys with free jerseys,
sox, balls, the guidance of
coaches and the use of grounds.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
UNITED STATES OF AFRICA?
'T'he “New York Times” might
have been speaking for
nearly all the overseas papers
to hand when it editorially
described Ghana Prime
Minister Nkrumah’s announced
goal of a Union of African
States as desirable enough in
theory but immensely difficult
to achieve:
“The historic, tribal,
linguistic, religious, geographic
and economic differences be-
tween the various independent
and emerging States of West
Africa alone—not to mention
those of East Africa, a few
thousand miles away—are such
as to make creation of any form
of united political organism a
stupendous and monumental
task. ■ Even the very modest
beginning attempted during thg
past year —the union between
Ghana itself and Guinea —
exists more in fiction than in
fact.
“Dr. Nkrumah is justified in
his aversion to the ‘balkanisa-
tion’ of Africa, but the fact is
that the balkanisation has been
accomplished, entirely arti-
ficially but nonetheless effec-
tively, by the colonial Powers
in the last century. The
boundaries are based on acci-
dent or on conquest, but they
exist; and it is going to be diffi-
cult to do away with them,
especially as in some cases the
dominant European language
and culture —English or French
—only accent the differences,
between next-door neighbors.
“There is another problem,
symbolised by Dr. Nkrumah
himself. That is the loyalty of
the people of each of the new
States to its own leader
Toure in Guinea, Houphouet
Boigny in the Ivory Coast,
Nkrumah in Ghana, and so on
—and the consequent difficulty
of determining which one will
lead them all.
“And in the background
looms the emerging shadow
of Nigeria, most populous State
in the entire continent, which
will gain its independence next
October. Will Nigeria consent
to be led in a union by anyone
but a Nigerian? The more one
looks at it, the more distant the
realisation of Dr. Nkrumah’s
dream seems to be.
Thinking along the same
lines, London “Daily Mail”
adds:
“Dr. Nkrumah must learn to
walk before he can run. If
he could make democracy
work in his own country, be-
fore he tries to rush it on all
Africa, he would show better
statesmanship.
“A black U.S.A. will per-
haps come some day—but not
yet. In the meantime Dr.
Nkrumah would do well to
cling to the Commonwealth, as
he proposes. It has still much
to teach him.”
London “Economist” notes
that Dr. Nkrumah’s timing of
his announcement of the goal
was “most convenient, for the
All-Africa Peoples’ Congress is
imminent at Tunis, and
Dr. Nkrumah has to have
something to boost his stature
as black Africa’s champion at a
time when new African leaders
are lining-up for their turn in
the limelight”:
“Dr. Nkrumah also let it be
known that Ghana’s new repub-
lican Constitution will contain
provision for. the ceding of
sovereignty to an African —or
West African —federal State
should a wider union become
possible; his object is to
challenge other new African
countries, notably Nigeria, to
follow his (and Guinea’s)
example in offering more than
lip-service to the Pan-African
idea.
“It was natural that he
should raise this with Mr. Mac-
millan. The new Constitution
may make him Chief of State
as well as chief executive ; this
would affect his standing at the
Commonwealth Prime
Ministers’ meetings.
“A further question must
have raised itself. Can a Com-
monwealth country enter a
federal union with foreign
countries and yet stay in the
Commonwealth? Very likely ;
but if it can, what becomes of
the British Government’s argu-
ment that the Commonwealth
ties preclude Britain from join-

“However, there is a still
more immediate issue to which
Dr. Nkrumah’s announcements
draw attention. The most ‘tin-
pot’ of the new free black
States is Togoland, the former
French trust-territory, Ghana’s
next-door neighbor. Most
Ghanaians think (not with-
out reason) that it would
be better-off united to
Ghana, and at one time it
seemed likely that it would be;
but now the Premier of Togo-
land, M. Olimpio, is full of
doubts of the kind that the
British Cameroons entertains
toward Nigeria. He notes that
there is no future for two
leaders (especially if one is in
Opposition) in Ghana. West
Africans watch the unfolding
of this situation with grim
amusement.”
Republic on Ice
Commenting o n Prime
Minister Verwoerd's pro-
mise to create machinery for
making South Africa a repub-
lic, Edinburgh “Scotsman”
notes that “in effect he seems
to be saying ‘Hands off South
Africa.’ ” adding, however,
that “the [British] Common-
wealth will not attempt to
restrain South Africa should
she wish to leave it”:
“Dr. Verwoerd has not made-
up his mind on that point. He
admits that it would be in
South Africa’s interests to
remain friends with Britain, but
apparently he would leave the
Commonwealth if the Labor
party were returned to office.
“When he accepted the
leadership of the South African
Nationalist party in September,
1958, Dr. Verwoerd pr°'
pounded the curious theory
that a republic was the only
way to bring about complet e
unity between the English-
speaking and the Afrikaans-
speaking sections of the white
population.
“Presumably the foundation
for this belief is that the
English-speaking section would
be cut-off from their spiritual
home. While he promised to
work for a republic, he was to
choose the favorable moment'

Government stock his promise

certain date. The plebiscite lS

One of the really bright signs for Australia
now is in the strengthening of our relations
with Asia.
This has been brought about partly from an
interchange of visits by national leaders, partly
from the goodwill expressed in the Australian-
inspired Colombo Plan; but chiefly, I believe,
from the development of a more enlightened
understanding between ourselves and people
in Asia.
While all this is excellent, we should not
imagine that it will be enough for us to proclaim
friendship and convince Asians that racial
intolerance is not in our character. We have to
give practical and lasting proof of our sincerity.
A fluid trade is one way of expressing it. And
it is vastly important, for the raising of Asian
living standards rests finally on the ability of
Eastern countries to build themselves up
socially and economically. The most generous
and welcome aid is poor substitute for a country’s
self-sufficiency and self-respect.
Figures for the last June year show how
our trade with the East is growing. Japan’s heavy
purchases of wool helped greatly to the fifty-six
million pounds’ trade surplus we had with all
Eastern countries. Other primary produce and
manufactures still accounted for more than half
our earnings from exports to the East in 1958-59.
We had a favourable trade balance with
sixteen Eastern countries, an unfavourable balance
with six—those chiefly from which we buy oil,
cotton and tea.
Obviously some Asian countries are better
placed to supply items we purchase in large
quantity. But right through the East there
is tremendous scope for fostering stronger
mutual trade.
The important thing is that we should not
be satisfied, at. a year’s end, to round it off in our
minds as so-much earned from the East in
favourable trade.
We are dealing here with human as well as
commercial values. And I believe the human
factor is going to be the most important in the
forming of an Asian-Australian partnership.

Opposition parties combined
had a majority of 15,000 votes
over the Nationalists. There
has also been dissension in the
Nationalist party on this issue,
as Dr. Verwoerd recognises,
for he has said that he would
not expect Nationalists who
did not believe in a republic to
vote for one.
“There is no Constitutional
difficulty about establishing a
republic, but if the plebiscite
showed a bare majority in
favor of it, that would hardly
demonstrate the unifying
virtue of that system of
government.”
Commenting on Dr. Ver-
woerd’s ruling that a majority
of one vote either way will
decide the issue, London
“Economist” notes that “if the
former black and colored votes,
restricted as they were, had not
been suppressed, there would
have been a majority to keep
the Crown in South Africa for
the foreseeable future”:
“Dr. Verwoerd did not quite
say that by setting-up the
machinery for a referendum on
the republic he was pointing a
missile at the heart of West-
minster. If that is his idea, no
doubt, Mr. Macmillan will be
able to tell him that the nose-
cone is a dud, and will cause
no explosion.
“Nor can Mr. Macmillan
rise to the bait which Dr. Ver-
woerd put out in the remark
that if a British Labor Govern-
ment, with Mr. Gaitskell’s
well-known African views,
came into power, South Africa
would leave the Common-
wealth ; though such an event
would distress the Common-
wealth Relations Office. Mr.
Macmillan will do well to tell
Dr. Verwoerd bluffly that if
necessary the Crown will go
it alone in South Africa with
the High Commission terri-
tories—tough as Dr. Verwoerd
could make it for them. Dr.
Verwoerd is not so strong as
he sounds.”
German Resolve
JUanchester “Guardian”
. A comment on the declara-
hon on anti-Semitism read to
the West German Bundestag
late last month:
“In taking a stand against
c rash of paintpot anti-
Semitism it is at once forceful,
dignified, and sensible. Out-
Sl ders ought to be able to
Welcome it with none of the
doubts called forth by Dr.
Adenauer's prescription of a
good hiding for daubers. It
carries all the more weight for
having been supported by all
parties and read out by the
acting-president of the House.
“What is remarkable is that
the statement condemns the
outbreaks as a disgrace to
Germany without either
wallowing in the disgrace or
pretending that it is all the
fault of somebody else.
“These politicians have even
resisted the temptation to blame
newspaper publicity: ‘There
are situations in which one
must wake the sleeping dogs
of hell, in order to realise from
their barking how near we still
are to hell.’
“In dealing with Germany’s
moral position in the world
the declaration holds a fair
balance: it acknowledges that
misbehavior abroad cannot
palliate the German outbreaks
but asks foreigners to en-
courage those many Germans
who have taken a stand against
them —a wholly just request.
“What matters most is that
the statement sets parents,
teachers and all those respon-
sible for the ‘intellectual
climate’ the task of seeing that
young Germans know and
understand the true burden of
Germany’s recent past.
“Whether the people at large
are slothful or aware matters
more than whether there linger
here and there pockets of
fanatics. Events like [this]
declaration should have a
notable influence on the half-
conscious feelings that are the
ground-basis of opinion.”
Japan and the U.S.
'T'he “New York Times” sees
the new U.S.-Japanese
mutual-security pact (signed in
Washington on January 19) as
making Japan “a full-fledged
ally of the United States and
an equal partner in the com-
munity of the free world”:
“In line with our [U.S.]
mutual-security pacts with 41
other nations, the new treaty
pledges both nations to resist
any armed attack on either as
dangerous to both, and to con-
sult with each other whenever
the security of Japan or peace
and security in the Far East
are threatened.
“To that end Japan grants
to the United States land, air
and naval bases on Japanese
soil without time-limit and
joins in their defence. But be-
cause the American-sponsored
Japanese Constitution renounc-
ing war is interpreted as
barring the dispatch of
Japanese forces to other parts
of the world, Japan’s defence-
muimaUiJiaMMJmik


itself. And though the treaty
provides for no veto, the
United States obligates itself to
consult with Japan both on
deployment of its forces from
Japan to other areas and on
major changes in men and
weapons in Japan.
“The treaty is for 10 years,
at least, and may be prolonged
indefinitely unless denounced
on a year’s notice. But its
specific provisions must still be
regarded as transitional until
the United States can withdraw
its forces. That time will have
come when Japan is able to
provide for its own defence by
its own defence-forces, in
alliance with the United States.”
London “Daily Telegraph,”
however, notes that “while the
pact offers military advantages
acknowledged by some Japanese
and denied by others, it has im-
plications which arouse resent-
ment” :
“It means, for instance, that
Japan will have to pursue a
foreign policy in alignment
with that of the United States,
including refusal to recognise
Communist China. Japanese
industrialists regard themselves
as debarred by the pact from
taking advantage of the new
Chinese markets. Although
the Communists hold only one
seat in the House of Repre-
sentatives, young Japanese
idealists are impressed by
Chinese resurgence under Mao
Tse-tung.”
In fact, the same paper adds,
“many—and perhaps incom-
patible—interests in Japan
feel that the pact prevents
Japan from playing her natural
leading part in the Far East.
Mr. Kishi [the Japanese Prime
Minister] has, indeed, per-
suaded the United States to
consult the Japanese Govern-
ment before using her bases in
Japan, but consultation does
not give Japan a veto.”
It is this last point, notes
London “Economist’s” Tokyo
correspondent, “on which the
Japanese critics have fastened
as ambiguous, vague, unsatis-
factory, and deliberately de-
vised to mislead. They say
there would have been no need
to exchange notes if the treaty
itself had simply contained a
straightforward Japanese veto
on bringing American nuclear
weapons into Japan, and on
using American forces and
bases for any purpose except
the defence of Japan against a
direct attack.
“Mr. Kishi last visited
Washington in June, 1957.
Since then there have
been significant changes in
American - Japanese relations,
most of them a result of that
visit. The number of American
military in Japan has been cut
in half, to 65,000. Military
facilities, including head-
quarters, camps, ranges and
radar-sites, have been turned-
over by the hundred to the
Japanese. The last four-score
of Japanese ‘war criminals’ have
been released. Japan’s contri-
bution to the cost of American

LOTS OF ACTIVITY IN DISARMAMENT.
forces has been progressively
reduced (and the new treaty
finally abolishes it). Mr. Kishi
himself has been praised by Mr.
Eisenhower as ‘one of the most
dependable leaders of the free
world.’
“While America has thus
been acknowledging the im-
portance it attaches to Japan’s
friendship, and hoping for
Japan’s voluntary acceptance
of the responsibilities of an
ally, both Russia and China
have been working hard to
inhibit the Japanese from
responding with anything
warmer than neutralism.
“Time and again Russia has
given warnings of the awful
consequences of missiles and
hydrogen-bombs to a country
with a lot of people in a little
area ; while the Chinese have
kept-up an angry barrage about
an American-Japanese plot to
enslave South-east Asia.
“Mr. Kishi and Mr. Fuji-
yama [the Japanese Foreign
Ministerl have shrugged-off
these threats and charges with
considerable sang-froid, but
that they have not been with-
out effect on Japanese public
opinion is indicated by the
nervous and suspicious greeting
accorded an American-Japanese
security-treaty in which all the
revisions are American con-
cessions.
“The duration of the original
treaty was indefinite, and rhe
United States had to consent
to its termination ; Japan can
end the new arrangement uni-
laterally if it wishes. Under the
old treaty the United States
could use, and arm, its forces
in Japan in any way it thought
necessary for ‘peace in the Far
East.’ Under the new, Mr.
Kishi says that ‘When we feel
we should say “No” we shall
do so, and I am sure the United
States will not go against our
wishes.’ He is almost certainly
right; for in practice, and
whatever the treaty said, the
Japanese could now, if they
wished, make the American
base-position too uncomfort-
able to be worth while.
“Nevertheless, the American
Defence Department had
hoped, in return for according
Japan what amounts to a
power of veto, to have Japan’s
share of responsibility for
peace in .the Pacific extended,
so that an attack on an
American installation or ship in
those waters would be sufficient
to set the treaty machinery in
motion.
“Japanese public opinion
protested too loudly for this to
be feasible ; not even the pros-
pect of being able, by such
extension of responsibility, to
stake a firmer claim to early
restoration of Japanese ad-
ministration over Okinawa
could outweigh fears that
Japan might some time become
involved in a .war with China
over Quemoy.
“Mr. Kishi declares that the
new treaty has been negotiated
on an equal footing and in a
spirit of mutual trust. There
is, however, very little senti-
ment, from the Japanese side,
in the American-Japanese rela-
tionship. What in the meantime
keeps Japan in the Western or
free-world camp is rather en-
lightened self-interest. But this
is not after all a bad basis for
treaty relations. Mr. Kishi has
expressed the hope that the
sentiment will come in time,
and he may be right.”
Various Voices
President Eisenhower : “The
assurance of peace in freedom
is the key to betterment of
peoples everywhere ; and, in a
just peace, friendship between
all peoples will flourish. Our
concept of the good life for
humanity does not require an
inevitable conflict between
peoples and systems. Nor does
it offer merely a bare co-
existence as a satisfactory state
for mankind. We believe that
history, the record of human
living, is a great and broad
stream into which should pour
the richness and diversity of
many cultures.”

Governor Rockefeller: “We
face the stark and immediate
challenge of proving that
representative government can
work. Back of this great pur-
pose stand our basic beliefs in
the nature and destiny of man.
We believe that the true end
of all just and free govern-
ment is the fulfilment of man’s
hope for a life, in the nation
and in the world, of dignity,
of opportunity, of peace.”

President Eisenhower: “The
change of emphasis from con-
ventional-type to missile-typ e
warfare must be made with
care, mindful that the one type
of warfare cannot be safely
neglected in favor of the other.
Our military forces must be
capable of contending success-
fully with any contingency
which may be forced upon us,
from limited emergencies to all-
out nuclear general war.”

London “Economist” : “At
their last meeting at logjakarta
in November, the [Colombo
Plan] delegates decided to give
the plan another six-year span
of life ; so long as it does a
useful job there is no idea of
letting it lapse. The question
ought rather to be whether it
might not be expanded. Now
that the problem of aid has
been pushed to the forefront
of international discussions, the
plan is worth examining as a
system that works smoothly
and without much waste. Its
organisers are jealous of its
particular quality ; but on the
face of it there seems no
reason why other Western
countries, for instance West
Germany, might not be drawn
under the Colombo umbrella.”

Hanson W. Baldwin, in the
‘‘New York Times”: “In the
Communist ideology every
action has a political slant.
Each of the major Soviet space
achievements was calculated to
excite the imagination of man
and to reap political and
psychological dividends.
“There is no doubt that the
Soviet space achievements have
contributed in a major degree
to the public image of the
U.S.S.R. as an imaginative,
energetic, technologically ad-
v anced society, imbued with the
restless eagerness and daring of
the great explorers of the past,
and capable of feats which no
other nation can equal. The
global damage consequently
'lone to United States prestige is
n °t incalculable, but there is no
denying that it has been
tmmense.”

(( The “New York Times’’ :
One of the safe predictions
for the 1960’s is that world
power can no longer be neatly
separated into two camps. The
rise of Communist China as a
world force, the dramatic asser-
tions of African independence
and the movement to make
Latin America a voice of its
own and not an echo of the
United States all point to a
world in movement, not in
balance. That India should
wish to be friends both of the
Soviet Union and the United
States is not inconsistent with
this picture.”

that the resumption of diplo-
matic relations with Egypt
will lead to an early all-round
improvement of relations be-
tween the two countries, they
should be dispelled. The suspi-
cions and distrust of Britain

pathological. It will be a long,
long time before Anglo-
Egyptian relations can be
normal again—although what
normal is in this context is,
of course, difficult to say.”

Manchester “Guardian” : “In
recent years Britain has
seriously misjudged the political
forces at work in Europe. As
a result she now finds herself
edged into the wings of
Europe. Her voice is heard,
but her advice increasingly
ignored as coming from an out-
sider.
“As the European Com-
munity grows in strength,
Britain’s special relationship
with America, too, is likely
to be slowly eroded. Situations
in which America may have to
choose between rival policies
advocated by her European
partners are bound to arise.
Indeed, the differences over
Summit approaches and the
chances of an interim agree-
ment on Berlin would only be
a portent of much greater
differences in time to come.
That is why there is some
urgency in the call for a re-
appraisal of policy.”

Charles F. Gallagher, in the

For peoples who are still
struggling for identity and
emancipation political pres-
sures are overwhelming. It is
only after this elementary
instinct is satisfied that it is
possible to concentrate on
their economic sores, or to go
on from there to questions of
the social orientation of the
economy. The reluctance of
the West, particularly in its
dealings with the Arab world,
to treat political problems as
such has been its greatest
single mistake.”

Joseph Alsop, in N.Y.
“Herald Tribune”: “The Presi-
dent [Eisenhower] inherited a
nation divided and neurotically
embittered. He will hand on
to his heir a nation united and
at peace with itself. But this
great, undeniable, and deeply
valuable success has been
achieved at the expense of —
one might almost say, by the
device of —shoving all sorts of
critical problems under the
rug.
“The gravest of all these
problems has clearly been the
problem of the world balance
of power. The power-balance
has been permitted to tilt terri-
fyingly far in favor of the
Soviet bloc. The President's
heir will have to lead an
America living from day to
day, for the first time in
history, and whether most
Americans know it or not, in
the most deadly peril. The years
of the missile gap will, by their
very nature, require a new kind
of Presidential leadership.”

Adlai Stevenson, in “Foreign
Affairs” : “The more the Com-
munists see of the realities of
Western society, the better for
truth and so the better for us.
Knowing something of the
frightening darkness in which
most Russians have to live, I
favor the widest extension of
exchange-programmes and cul-
tural contacts. I would like to
see the United States take the
initiative in bringing Western
and Soviet teams together in
joint work. The principle of
the Geophysical Year should be
extended to a joint international
geophysical commission. Other
fields are Antarctic exploration
and control, oceanography,
medical and atomic-energy
research, exploration of outer
space and even joint operations
in certain areas of economic
aid.
“Such communion of
scholars and technicians could
do more than awaken Com-
munists to the reality of
Western life and to the possi-
bilities of an open world-society.
They could be forerunners of
supra-national co-operation and
organs of international control.”


Darky laughed \ politely.
“That was a good one, eh,
Blue?”
“Yair,” Blue said. “Very
witty.” He stared darkly at
the counter, mouth pulled
down at the corners. “Why
don’t you write a book?”
“I’ve often thought of it,”
Herb said eagerly. “I’ve got
plenty of material at home —
old clippings—and here.” He
tapped his walnut-colored fore-
head solemnly. “I don’t sup-
pose you know a publisher?”
“Not off-hand, Herb,” Darky
said quickly. After all, why
shouldn’t the old boy write a
book? “The only thing is, it’s
the inside stories would make
a thing like that sell —you
know, the little personal
touches.”
“I can remember lots,” Herb
said happily. “For instance . . .”
Darky listened, bored and a
little sad. Old Herb must have
seen and heard a great deal
in his years around the courts,
tragic and moving things, and
he remembered the trivia ; stuff
that could be dug-up from the
files, a collection of legal
chestnuts, and a mouthful of
dust. It seemed a pity.
“Then there was Lady
Brown,” Herb said. “They
made up a song about it, you
know. Lady Brown went on
the town. Killed her husband,
it did, all the larrikins singing
that song. At least, he com-
mitted suicide soon after.”
“Who was he?” Darky
asked, interested. “I haven’t
heard that story.” “A big
noise,” Herb said solemnly.
“Banking. Or perhaps it was
shipping. I was only a boy
then, in my first job as a re-
porter. I’ve got the clipping
at home—about the suicide,
that is, not about the other.
That was hushed-up, but every-
one knew about it. She went
back to England soon after-
wards. She was well connected
there. It's all in the clipping.
Who he was —he was in poli-
tics, too, I remember now —-
and all about her family.”
“Did she really go on the
town?” Darky asked. “Or
was that a manner of speak-
ing?”
“My word she did!” Herb
put down his glass. He looked
happy. “That was how it all
came out—she was picked-up
for soliciting, and when she
appeared in court, under a
false name, of course, some-
one recognised her. Then the
story spread, although the
papers didn’t print it. It was
a small town then, in that way.
He resigned from all his big
jobs and a couple of weeks
later blew out his brains. All
sorts of stories were going
around. She was a regular
Messalina, according to these
stories. He knew, but kept it
dark, they reckoned. Then he
couldn’t stand the scandal.”
“Poor Aubrey can never decide where he feels the most luxurious—
ashore or afloat."
Darky swirled the sticky
dregs in his glass. “It’d be
hard then,” he said thought-
fully. “A different world. I
wonder how a man would react
now —the same sort of map—
to something like that?”
“He’d probably sell his life-
story to the papers,,” Blue
said. “Make a catchy head-
line: ‘I Married a Nympho.’”
Herb gave him a disapprov-
ing glance. “Times change,”
he said severely. “But —
harumph!—not that much.
Fine-looking woman, too.”
“I bet they’d try to get it,
though,” Blue said. He nodded
to the barmaid, who swept up
their glasses—you got service
here —chuckled. “Can't you
see dear Mons. rubbing his
fine Italian hands over those
headlines?”
Darky could see it. He
appreciated the scrambled pun,
too —a flash of the old Mons.
But he felt slightly sick. Too
much squash.
“Who did you say this
Brown was?” he asked Herb.
“I forget all the details,”
Herb said apologetically. “I
was on shipping then, you
know—didn’t start on the
courts until Sandy McDonald
went to be chief-sub.—no, I’m
telling a lie, it was before, a
month or so before, because
Sandy broke me in to the
courts. Now there was a
character ; a newspaperman of
the old school. Did I ever tell
you . . . ?”
“Here,” Blue said loudly,
pushing a full glass towards
Herb. He played with his own
glass listlessly, all the anima-
tion of a moment ago drained
away.
Darky drank his squash.
Blue broke away from the
anecdote about the Chief
Justice’s wig, beckoned, asked
in a low, Ashamed voice how
Darky was holding. Dark let
him have two-quid, all the
money he had on him bar some
silver for his fares and to buy
sandwiches.
He had the press-room to
himself. Most of the others
were at the corner. He had
seen them there, in the saloon-
bar, but had steered away for
Blue’s sake. When you’re
broke you don’t want to get in
a school.
He munched the sandwiches
slowly, thinking about old
Herb’s story, the scandal it
must have been in those days,
the changing nature of news ;
then, by a natural association,
he began to think about the
woman from Adelaide. As Herb
said, things hadn’t changed
that much. How would the
husband feel, reading the news-
item, wondering who else had
seen it, becoming conscious of
secret glances? The eyes of:
friends could be terrible jj

Well, it wasn’t his worry'
He wrapped the last two sand

with the debris of the others

it up. Was picking it up, i„
fact, when Pam Burgell came*
in.
Co the first he saw of her was
a pair of bare brown lees
tapering into shoes with a floral
design on the toes, which were
pointing at him.
He looked up, saw who it
was, dropped the rubbish into 1

turn on a blue. Sorry.”
He glanced at his watch.
“I’m pretty busy . . .”
“What about not using it?”
His heavy eyebrows came
together: “Look, Pam, you
know the rules. I don’t make
them, but I’ve got to keep to
them. You approach me, ask
me not to use something—l’ve
got to use it then, to cover
myself, whether it’s any good
or not. Got to send it, at
least, whether it’s used or
not.”
“You needn’t send it . . .”
He held up his hand. “Hold
it. But I’ve also got to write
a report to the chief-of-staff—
a full report about being
approached to kill a story—
who, why, when. That’s
standing-orders. That makes
it practically a moral that they
will use the story, whether it’s
newsworthy or not. I’m only
telling you this because —
because . . .” Why was he
telling her, anyway . . . ? “Just
so you’ll see it’s the worst
thing you can do, approaching
a reporter about a thing like
this.”
“My, how stern! ” She
popped a cigarette in her red
mouth, snapped her fingers.
“Give me a light? Here, this
will do.” She seized his hand,
guided the lighted end of his
cigarette to ignite her own,
leaning forward. “Ta.” She
released his hand, leaned back,
exhaled, arching her back
luxuriously, face thrown up.
“I know all that bull,” she said
casually. “Rules are made to
be broken, aren’t they?”
“Not by me,” Darky said
grimly.
“No?” . She lifted her
Pencilled eyebrows, dimpled.
You must be a funny sort of
a man.” Then, sharply: “You
haven’t sent the copy, you
say?”
“I said nothing of the kind,
book, Pam, this once I’ll take
ri sk, forget what you’ve said,
heave it at that.” He picked
a cable-editiop paper on the
table, glanced at it quickly,
but he was very conscious of
her presence. He looked up,
“You still here?”
She smoked, frowning. She
crossed her legs—magnificent
legs, Darky admitted ; she was,
in fact, a magnificent young
animal. If you could forget
the other ... Not being able
to forget it made her seem, at
times, almost monstrous;
which, perhaps, wasn’t fair.
t>am looked up. “I’m not
going to leave it,” she said
firmly. “I promised.”
He sighed. “All right. You
know the score. Who did you
promise?”
No answer.
“Did you promise this
woman Julie that you’d try to
get me to kill the story?”
“What if I did?”
He leaned back. “How long
have you known her?”
She gave him a flickering
glance. “A month.”
“Where did you meet her?”
“Find out.”
She re-crossed her legs. The
blue skirt climbed higher,
exposing lace and nylon and a
firm brown thigh. But she
wasn’t trying to vamp him,
Darky decided. She was think-
ing, dark eyes narrowed, inhal-
ing quickly, blowing the
smoke through nervous nostrils.
She turned her head, look-
ing at him squarely.
“If you haven’t sent your
copy it means you mightn’t
send it all all, doesn’t it?”
“It might have meant that,”
he said. “Before you spoke
to me. You approaching me
has complicated things—can’t
you see that?”
“Yes,” she said impatiently.
“I’m not dumb. But I said I
would—it was a risk that had
to be taken. If I hadn’t, it was
on the cards you wouldn’t;
have sent it, wasn’t it?”
“It’s not a hot news-story,”
he said cautiously. “But this
isn’t a day for news. Be-
sides . . .”
“So why use it now? It’s
still the same story,” she said
triumphantly.
“That’s not the point. In
any case, there’s a human-
interest angle.”
Pam laughed harshly.
“Human interest! Fat lot of
human feeling you vultures
have! It’s going to be nice
for her family, reading your
human-interest story! Nice for
the kid, too —did you know
she had a kid, Mr. Reporter?
Have you got kids?”
“Two,” Darky said briskly.
“I hope to continue to support
them, too, for a few years yet.
Anyway, it’s another city.
You’re making too much of
this, whatever your reason.”
What was it, he wondered
—money? You heard about
golden-hearted prostitutes, but
they were mostly hard little
bitches . .- .
She tossed her auburn hair.
“There are cables, aren’t
there? They’d lap it up, where
she comes from. Dirt about a
local. He’s got an important
job, her husband.”
So it was money. This little
tart had smelt it, had hopped
in for her cut . . . “Where did
you run into her?” he asked
casually.
“At a party.”
“And what are you getting
out of it?”
She stared at him for a
moment. “You think I’m
getting paid? Well, I’m not.
I’m . . . well, you might say
I’m paying back a debt.”
“I see. You owe her
money.”
She stared at the cigarette
in her hand. “Not exactly.
It wasn’t like that at all. When
Stevie was put away I went
haywire. I was in a bit of a
mess. I met her then ; she was
cashed-up; she looked after
me. She did give me money
—she’s like that; good-hearted
—but I paid her back. Didn’t
lay eyes on her again until
today. If I had she wouldn’t
be up on a vag. charge.”
“But on another, eh? Is
that what she was doing, the
same as you?”
“Drop dead.”
He shrugged. “Suit your-
self, Pam. You come here,
ask for my help. I’ve a right
to ask questions.”
“Then you won’t use it?”
“I didn’t say that; but what
I will say is anything you tell
me now is off the record. Any-
way, we’d only use what was
said in court. You know
that.”
“Well,” she hesitated, puffed
her cigarette. “Yes, that’s
what she was doing.”
“I thought so. Why? Why
couldn’t she write to her hus-
band, get money, or get a
job?”
“She likes the men,” Pam
said primly. “That’s why.”
“H-m. And her husband
wants her back?”
“You heard Morgan say it,
didn’t you?”
“Yes.” Something occurred
to him. Always check. “You
were in there?”
She nodded.
“You know Saunders from
the ‘Star’—writes those little
color pieces? Fair, tall, wavy
hair, moustache, hatchet-face.
Do you know him?”
“Yes, I know him.”
“Did you see him in court
while this case was going on?
Sitting at the back?”
“No,” she said, wonderingly.
“Why?”
“Oh, nothing.” Well, that
was something. The husband
. . . “So the husband wants her
back, but he didn’t come over
himself, and he’s got plenty of
money . .
“Who said he had plenty
of money?” she said quickly.
“You said he had a big
job,” Darky said gently.
“Yes, but. . . From what she
says, there’s not such a lot of
money. Not yet.”
“That’s why she cleared out,
I suppose,” Darky said.
“If you think that, you’ve
a lot to learn. No. Why she
cleared out —don’t you see?—
was because of the other thing.
She couldn’t help it. It was
like drink, or dope. There are
women like that. I feel sorry
for them.”
“You sound pretty smug,”
Darky remarked.
She shrugged her brown
shoulders. Quite a beach-girl,
Pam, outside working hours.
“I can’t understand it,” she
said honestly. “But she’s nice,
really she is. She’s had a hell
of a time. Tried to stop it;
couldn’t; finally, after a
terrific scene —he’d caught her
with one of his friends —
cleared out here. If she was
going to the pack, she
reckoned, it might as well be
out of the home.”
“And he wants her back?”
Darky said incredulously.
“Yes. He’s thought it over,
maybe. Anyway, she’s willing
to give it a go. If you let
her.”
“What does he do?” Darky
asked.
“He’s a doctor. He must
be pretty nice, too, from what
she says. She’s mad about
him.”
“Looks like it!”
“Well —that’s what she says.
She thinks this time it might be
all right. She’s going to try
real hard.”
He eyed her narrowly. “And
you’re not getting anything
out of it?”
“Only what I said. She
helped me. I’m human.” She
crossed her legs.
As good an answer as any,
he thought. It might even be
true. A man could be too
shrewd —you saw them in this
place, the cunning, stupid
ones . . .
“What about it?” she said.
“Why don’t you give her a
break?”
“Just a minute. How did
she come to lose her money?”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
TV and the Writer
When the history of the rise
and fall of TV comes to be
written, it will not only show
that most of those connected
with the “exciting new
medium” made many blunders,
but that the calamitous error
was failure to realise that the
key person was the writer.
At the start, TV didn’t have
to worry about material. Hosts
of plays were waiting to be
used. Thousands of miles of
old films could be bought
cheaply and given another
showing. Not for several years
was it realised that, at the rate
at which this old material was
being devoured, a day of
reckoning must come.
Optimists said that maga-
zines, newspapers, publishers
and radio-networks had always
found plenty of people willing
to write for them. Why should
TV be any different? But the
shortage of new scripts written
especially for TV continued.
TV-producers went on raking
through what had been written
in the past but realised, with
growing alarm, that all the
cream had now been skimmed
off. Mightly little was left able
to be adapted to the narrow
requirements and small budgets
of the TV-show. And in the
meantime TV competition had
been killing-off the geese which
had been laying eggs for it —-
the B-class Hollywood film
and the cheap magazines which
published fast-moving adven-
ture-stories.
This started a change of
attitude towards writers. It
seemed that they should be
regarded as indispensable cogs.
1 was at a gathering where
writers met a leading TV-
producer. He demonstrated,
with the aid of a film-projector
and a screen, the type of show
needed. All we had to do was
to write scripts for similar
plays. TV didn’t ask for
Broadway or London West
End standards —but the shows
had to be good. Then some-
body asked a question about
payment.
It wasn't good, he admitted.
Only £l2O at most for a full
three-act play. “But we offer
you an audience of millions,”
he added, as if this was some-
thing which was even better
than hard cash. As a result of
that meeting only one play
was submitted.
Two years ago, fears o?
TV-executives were still being
whispered behind closed doors.
Now something approaching
panic is arising. There is no
sign of anything like an
adequate supply of TV-scripts,
“The Worst part of door-to-door selling is the
unfriendly dogs."
and the stockpile of old films
won’t last much longer.
Writers generally have the
last laugh, although in all too
many cases it is a ghostly merri-
ment, coming from the spot
where some poet, novelist or
playwright was buried and
whose work, given poor
recognition during his or her
lifetime, is now included among
the world’s literary treasures. In
the case of TV, many writers
may be able to do the laugh-
ing while still alive.
It will be fitting that the
TV-people will be the ones at
whom the laughter is directed,
for initially their treatment of
writers was shabbier than any-
thing since the days of the
writing hacks of Grub Street.
And even if they now start to
lay-down red carpets and
arrange floral decorations, it 1
won’t alter the fact that all the
creative writers in the world to
day, if they gave their whole
time to TV-scripts alone, would
still be unable to supply what
TV will need when there is no
more old material left. —

Education Finance
The Victorian Premier's pre-
diction that all school-accom-
modation needs in his State
would be met in 12 to 18
months’ time isn’t likely to be
realised. The State is laboring
under financial difficulties, and
there is a prospect of further
wage and salary rises.
The only solution to the
problem of overcrowded
schools is additional Federal
finance, specifically earmarked
for education. The people
won’t have a bar of extra taxa-
tion for this or any other pur-
pose, and Treasurer Holt has
indicated he is against any
higher taxation.
This year 28 secondary -
schools began with temporary
accommodation of some sort,
with corridors, sick-bays, staff-
rooms and shelter-sheds in
general use, as well as church-
halls. As the V.T.TJ. rightly
points out, their members can't
be expected to get the best
out of a child in primitive con-
ditions accentuated by poor
lighting and heating.
Can we afford to put a brake
on the development of our
future leadership by condoning
such conditions? The tirnj
seems to have arrived whd
more of the national income
must be spent on the social
needs of the Australian people
—on water, housing, power
sewerage (75,000 homes jj
Melbourne alone are un.
sewered) and, of course, edu-
cation.
The Education Department
in the Cabbage State hal
estimated that £lO million i
needed to meet all education-
requirements over and above
ordinary expenditure. Where is
this money going to come
from? Minister Bloonafield ha;
stated that a five per cent]
increase in all teachers’ salaries
will cost an extra £1 million a
year (and the passing on of
the 28 per cent, margins-in-
crease to teachers seems im-
minent).
Victoria is in a difficult posi-i
tion in this matter since it hasi
accepted 40 per cent, of all
migrants to come out hen
since War II ; the growth ofl
school-population has been
phenomenal. But the Govern
ment obviously hasn’t a hope
of solving the problem unless it
is able to persuade the Loan*
Council to give them a bigger
allocation from Federal
revenues. It’s time Premier
Bolte and Mr. Menzies got!
their heads together.—Pla»

Canadian-Australian
Banking
A substantial excess of
deposits over advances is
usually regarded as one of the
acid-tests of national solvency,
and there was a chirp of con-
gratulation from a Sydney
daily when it printed figures
showing trading-bank deposits
of more than £1,700,000,000.
Comparing this with the figures
of advances shown by the
“Insurance and Banking
Record” for November, 1959
(£929,000,000), it looked as if
everything in the economic
garden was flourishing.
Then I happened to spot a
little advertisement in the same
daily from the Royal Bank of
Canada. Deposits as at
30/11/ ’59 were £1,672,000,000
—within a cat’s-whisker of the
total of all the Australian
trading-banks, including the
Commonwealth.
To the Australian deposit-
total must be added
£1,443,000,000 in Savings Bank
deposits. The Royal (in
common with most of the
Canadian chartered banks)
runs a savings section, and its
total deposits in this section
are included with the grand
total But when one considers
that Canada has two other
banks nearly as large as the
Royal (the Bank of Montreal
and Canadian Bank of Com-
merce), five others comparable
with the larger of our Austra-
lian trading-banks (the Bank of
Nova Scotia, the Bank of
Toronto, the Dominion Bank,
the B a n q u e Canadienne
Nationale and the Imperial
Bank) and two smaller ones
(the Provincial Bank and Bar-
clay’s Bank, Canada), the total
figures make our Australian
deposits look as if we were not
in quite such a flourishing con-
dition after all, even allowing
for the greater population of
the Dominion and the fact that
some of the Canadian banks
have substantial overseas busi-
ness in the Caribbean Islands
and South America. There
must be an explanation as to
Why Canada has a higher
deposit-ratio than Australia.
Canada has no legalised State
lotteries to drain away a lot
of cash which would otherwise
find its way into savings-banks.
South Australia, which has
never indulged in this form of
extravagance, has an average
The Bulletin, February 10, 1960
per head of population of £174
(30/9/’59) as against a Com-
monwealth average of £143.
In terms of hard cash it
means that, if the Australian
average were to equal that of
S.A., we should have had
another £31,000,000 in our
collective savings - banks.
Savings-bank money is used
largely to finance local-authori-
ties and housing, and we could
have done quite a lot with an
extra £31,000,000. Of all the
States, S.A. is definitely the
poorest in natural resources,
but its people are the thriftiest.
Another reason may be that
racing, together with wholesale
gambling, has never affected
the Canadian public to the
degree that it has in Australia.
If Australian State treasurers
are looking for a new source
of revenue —one which would
not have an inflationary effect
or increase the cost of living—-
an annual registration-fee on
all animals used for racing,
whether horses or dogs, might
be successful. To make sure
it was paid, it might be pro-
vided that no animal was per-
mitted to race unless his (or her)
owner produced the receipt for
payment of the tax.
Lottery-winners might also
be called on for a contribution.
Only 10 per cent., deducted at
source, would represent a tidy
sum. — Sandpatch (N.S.W.).
Group Teaching
I think it is confusing to
insist, as “Sir” does (B.
20/1/’6O), that the first
essential of group-teaching is
that the groups should be
“voluntary , associations.” The
group-method covers a number
of systems, and the teacher’s
purpose will determine the
system to be used.
A grouping based on ability
or attainments may be best
when, for example, the groups
are remedial reading-groups.
If the teacher wants co-
operative teamwork in his
groups he will select the sys-
tem outlined by “Sir,” in
which each pupil provides a
list of pupils he would like to
work with. This is “socio-
metric grouping,” introduced
by J. L. Moreno in 1934. Inci-
dentally, Baden-Powell’s 1908
idea of Boy Scouts divided
into patrols of six or seven
had much the same basis, but
without Moreno’s elaborate
method of selection.
Sociometric grouping does
not imply that the pupils are
engaged on research. Where
they are the “project method”
is being used. This was
popularised by the American


Kilpatrick, a disciple of John
Dewey, who preached “pur-
poseful activity in social
groups.”
Although Alcoholics Anony-
mous has something in com-
mon with the voluntary basis
of Moreno’s method, I feel it
adds to the confusion to say
they use the essential tech-
nique of group - teaching.
Rather, they are using the
essential technique of group-
psychotherapy.
The alcoholics’ aim is to
cure themselves by mutual
support; the pupils’ aim, or
their teacher’s, is that they
Should acquire certain know-
ledge or skill and the experi-
ence of working together for
a common goal.
As “Sir” says, the group-
method is a remarkably useful
adjunct to ordinary classroom
teaching, which accounts for
its popularity in many N.S.W.
schools.—K. A. L. (N.S.W.).
Anti-Semitic Activities
Anti-Semitic activities in this
country must be checked, and
I believe that the Jews them-
selves could help by setting
their own house in order. This
has nothing to do with their
religion or their right to wor-
ship in their own way; but
many of the Jews who reached
Australia since the end of
War II might well take a leaf
out of the books of the Jewish
“What’s it like out?”
people who arrived in Aus-
tral[a muc h earlier,
earlier Jews mixed . in
wi ‘ h * he of the P°P u,a, ‘ on-
taking their place in publjc
affairs and generally living and
behaving like the real Aus-
tralians that they were. If
their sons wanted to play
cricket, football, tennis or any
other game, they joined-up with
the local lads and played for
town or Suburb in which they
lived. Hundreds of them joined
up with the A.I.F. in World
War I. There was no attempt
to form a Jewish regiment or
anything like that. History
showi the great part that these
Australian Jews played in that
war —sufficient to mention just
one man, Sir John .Monash.
Unfortunately many of the
Jews who have arrived since
the end of World War II have
adopted quite a different atti-
tude. They have tended to
keep to themselves. For some
years Sydney’s Jewish com-
munity has supported a Jewish
Soccer-club called Hakoah —
not that the players are Jewish,
but the governing body is.
The money is provided by Jews,
and other Soccer-players know
that the main object is to let
the public know that it is a
Jewish team.
The Jews aren’t the only ones
doing this sort of thing. We
have Austrian teams, Italian
and Dutch teams. This sort
of thing gets Australians’ backs
up. There have been near-
riots in the past when some
of these foreign teams have
appeared. If Jews want .to play
Soccer they should join teams
in the districts in which they
live, and. learn to mix with Aus-
tralians.
When the Jewish people
learn to behave in the same
manner as did those pioneer
Jews who helped to make Aus-
tralia what it is today, they
will find that they will have
so many Australians behind
them that they will have noth-
ing to fear from any Nazi-type
organisation. Eureka
(N.S.W.).
U.S. Patriotism
It may well be true, as Olaf
Ruhen states in “Facing
Botany Bay” (B. 20 /1 / ’6O),
that the U.S. places far more
emphasis than Australia on
preaching patriotism and ex-
plaining community ideals;
but it would also seem that
the U.S. has more need of
such preaching than we have.
Australia’s average standard
of political integrity might not
be too high, but it is well above
that in the U.S., where many
plain people will suspect a
public figure with a reputation
for scrupulous honesty, fear-

She was standing up, eyes
blazing, calling him a string of
dirty names in a low, venomous
voice. Leaning forward, hands
on hips, glowing with righteous

She reverted to type, all

“Nothing more to come?”

“No, all through.”

the last late-final-extra was on

papers in the store.
Opening the opposition paper
in the train, he saw Saunders’s
story. The type danced a
little, and he felt a pain near
his navel. He read through
the story carefully. It was a
competent piece of work, full
of words like “drama,” “mys-
tery,” “enigma,” but what was
important was the woman’s
name. Saunders must have
been there, after all.
What mattered was what
happened tomorrow, or the
next day, or the next. He
stared out the window. How
to tell Mary.
The pain near his navel
spread. How would it be,
married to a woman like that?
Was it possible to feel tender-
ness? That would make it

to be thinking about those

Maybe, like Blue, I bought it,

fully, checking the punctuation.

“Silent Night”
No, “Benbow” (B. 30/12/’59),
I think I’m right in my state-
®ent that the composer of
Silent Night” was a Tyrolean
schoolmaster and not a Court
musician to the Habsburg or
Esterhazy families.
I ve consulted the musical
dictionary and can find no
mention of a musician of the
“ f Gruber who was
attached to the Austrian

“Silent Night” was composed
before that date. Musical Aus-
trian friends support me in my
belief that Franz Gruber was
a Tyrolean schoolmaster who
set to music the words of his
parish priest, Father Josef
Mohr, and thus produced the
world’s most popular carol,
“Silent Night.”
Concerning “Onward

However > 1 seem t 0 remember
a “Current Affairs Bulletin”
dealing with it
Overseas coverage included
a series of pictures of fantastic
animals in “Life” magazine,,
accompanied by articles by Sir
Julian Huxley. He concluded
with Darwin’s well-known
words:
There is grandeur in this view
of life, with its several powers,
having been originally breathed by
the Creator into a few forms or
into one; and that, whilst this planet
has gone cycling on according to
the fixed law of gravity, from so
simple a beginning endless forms
most beautiful and most wonderful
have been, and are being, evolved.
Sir Julian, however, substi-
tuted dots for the words in
italics.
At a gathering in Chicago
late last year, attended by
2500 scholars and scientists to
celebrate the centenary, Sir
Julian made a speech, which
was widely publicised, pre-
dicting the end of religion.
Aldous Huxley’s Brave New
World looms nearer. If this
kind of thing is a consequence
of Darwin’s theory, Jean Paul
Sartre may have been right
when he said that belief in such
a theory might turn out to be
the greatest folly of the century.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
ECONOMICS OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY
From R. A. PRICE
Co eminent economists have
advised discontinuation of
the subsidy on butter! Such
action might remove a cause of
friction between dairyfarmers
and taxpayers in general; on
the other hand, many more
farmers than at present would
probably be forced to give the
game away.
I used to believe that, the
butter-subsidy was there for the
sake of consumers, and can
hardly imagine that any Aus-
tralian Government would do
anything substantial to help
such a small and politically in-
effective minority as the dairy-
farmers. But if this idea is
economically wrong, then I
must abandon it.
Dairyfarmers are a mixed lot. -
Their farms were established in
different circumstances, and
they have suffered from a wide
variety of natural and man-
made disadvantages, so it’s only
to be expected that they
should show many different
degrees of success or failure.
U.S. sheep men have
voted overwhelmingly
to continue the pro-
gramme of wool pro-
motion in the United
States through deduc-
tions from Govern-
ment subsidy payment.
Owners of 81 per cent,
of the country’s sheep
voted in favour. The
number of growers in
favour were half as
large again as the
number in favour in a
similar poll in 1955.
In Australia more and
more sheep owners are
in favour of the use of
Elastrator Rubber
Rings, the safe, sure
method of castration
and tailing. Elastrator
Rubber Rings tend to
avoid many of the
dangers associated with
old-fashioned methods.
Many farmers may be ineffi-
cient or even lazy, but surely
they are entitled to an honest
attempt on the part of the
various experts to help in turn-
ing failure into success, rather
than to be given a swift blow
of the axe.
I suppose even the average
dairyfarm is not much more
useful in the community than
the average business, and some
would be good for
the nation. In the U.S.A. the
lowering of the level of “price-
support” on all farm-produce
has put many farmers out of
business and has made the
rest more careful about effi-
ciency. The amount of pro-
duce for export or giving away
has fallen, and everybody is
happy—except the farmer, who
has to produce more for less
money, although he pays more
for everything he buys and his
product is dearer to the con-
sumer.
But, then, the problems of
the U.S.A. are different from
ours. Their main object is to
export more manufactured
goods without importing any-
thing much in exchange. Our
desire is to import manufac-
tured goods and we must pay
for them chiefly by primary
exports—of which butter is a
considerable part. Sixty per
cent, of the butter we produce
is exported.
The lack of exports of manu-
factured goods causes great
concern to politicians and
economists alike. Is it possible
that some inefficiency is to be
found in commerce and
industry, or is there merely
selfish opportunism?
Then there are the starving
people in Asia. Humanitarian
principles, as well as a long-
sighted eye to our own sur-
vival, impel us to help them
towards a better standard of
living.
It is right that we should give
them millions of pounds a
year, without any strings
attached, so that they can lay
the foundations of their own
future welfare. They spend
some of this money on food
and some on dams, machinery,
roads, etc., to improve their
own efficiency. They also buy
butter and skim-milk powder,
the production of which is in-
fluenced by our butter-subsidy.
If we reduce the volume of
production of butter or raise
prices we shall be less able to
help the people of Asia. If we
lop the subsidy we are bound
to reduce the number of dairy-
farms, though production is not
reduced proportionately, as
only the least-efficient farms 5
are lost. Production will be
reduced to some extent, but
worse than that, expansion of
dairy-production will be held
up, as the better farms remain-
ing in production will be those
on which capacity is being
used up to near its limit. 6
The quickest and best way to
increase production and im-
prove the efficiency of the
dairy-industry is to correct the
mistakes of dud farmers, not
put them out of business. In
most cases they have land
equipment and labor which has
only to be correctly used to be
economically productive.
The best way to improve
efficiency is to improve the ex-
tension of information to
farmers, so that costs will fall,
This will automatically be
followed by a reduction in the
butter-subsidy, which is based
on the average cost of produc-
tion and the returns from both
export- and home-markets.
If every farmer is given the
information he wants and the
returns are enough to encourage
the application of brains, skill
and energy, then only the lazy
and stupid ones will be done
away with, and the expansion
of milk-production will go
along on an economic basis.
Lower costs would make it
possible to trade with other
countries and to help with the
feeding and restoration of
Asia.
Extension-services at presenf
are far from satisfactory. Ex-
perienced advisers are so few
on the ground that they can
visit each farm in their areas
only about once in two years,
How can they possibly recog-
nise problems or apply the full
value of their training and
experience in helping to solve
them? Dairy-supervisors can-
not extend herd-recording be-
cause funds are limited, and
there’s a general lack of good
recruits because the salaries
paid are not attractive to people
who could do better in some
other occupation.
What we need most now is
instruction and information
about farm-management—not
methods of planting and grow-
ing grass or crops, but detailed
economics of when and how to
use the various processes so as
to use natural advantages and
get the best returns possible
from investment of labor and
capital. This knowledge must
be in the minds of the farmers
themselves, not in the archives
of universities or Governmen
departments.
Therefore, to get bette
results from primary produo
tion, in the form of cheapej

Fruit-fly
“Jayemma”: Tell “Stru-
mata” (B. 20/1/’6O) that
Queensland fruit-fly has not
spread throughout Victoria
and South Australia. It has
gradually made its way from
Queensland along the east
coast and is now established
as far down as the south-east
corner of Victoria. In recent
years there have been. small
outbreaks in some other parts
of Victoria and also in
Adelaide home-gardens; but.
the important fruitgrowing
areas in Victoria along the
Murray, in the Goulburn
Valley and further south are
completely free.
No fruit-fly has ever been
detected in South Australian
commercial orchards.
Victoria spends over £lOO,OOO
a year on fruit-fly prevention
and control. South Australia
has spent about £l4 million in
the past 12 years in successfully
stopping small outbreaks. These
States have intercepted so much
infested fruit coming over their
borders that they feel the main
method of spread is through
road-travellers. They are
therefore building-up effective
road-block systems at all
danger-points on their borders.
For many years the battle
against fruit-fly was almost im-
possible. The last five years
have brought several new
methods of control, including
Rogor. An extensive outbreak
in Florida’s citrus-groves has
been stopped completely, giving
pew hope to fruitgrowers and
interested Government Depart-
ments.
For 50 years Westralia has
been plagued with Mediter-
ranean-fly, a distinct species of
fruit-fly originally from the
Mediterranean regions. The
authorities are now attacking it
W|t h new methods and renewed
Vigor.
The spread of fruit-fly to
me present “clean” fruit-
P r °ducing areas would cause
incalculable loss to the in-
dustries concerned. Recogni-
tion of this is shown by the
efforts and expenditure under-
taken by the various State
authorities to prevent it.
Motorists and the travelling
public generally dan help
greatly by not carrying even the
smallest quantifies of fresh
fruit into areas free from fruit-
fly.
Training Sheepdogs
“North”: For a station-dog
choose a kelpie—fast and hard-
working ; difficult to control at
first, perhaps, but ideal for
hard conditions.
Though the story of the
breed’s origin should be well
known, there’s still some con-
fusion about it, so a few main
facts seem worth repeating.
Kelpies and barbs originated
at the Wanganella Merino
stud near Bombala (N.S.W.).
In 1866 Brodie, bookkeeper at
the stud, imported from Scot-
land a beautiful red, short-
haired, prick-eared sheepdog
bitfch which was mated with a
black dog from the adjoining
property and produced a litter
of seven pups. Six pups were
red, but one was black, and
was given to an aborigine who
called it Barb, after the 1866
Melbourne Cup winner From
this litter, whelped by the
Scottish bitch, sprang all suc-
ceeding dogs known as kelpies
and barbs, the progeny of the
red pups being the foundation
of the kelpie breed and those of
the black pup the root-stock of
the barbs. The claim that the
original kelpie had dingo blood
is not true.
The Border-collie, imported
from Scotland, is most favored
at trials because it has a wide
cast and is easily controlled. It
also makes a good yard-dog,
but doesn’t do too well on
Australian sheep-stations.
Another dog worth consider-
ing is the German-collie, either
blue-mottled or brown, with a
wall-eye. Crossed with the blue
cattledog, these are good
workers.
Having decided the breed
best suited to the purpose,
select a pup about six weeks
old and exercise it daily,
making sure it always walks at
heel. Tie it up every night, and
never feed it except when tied-
up in that same place. At the
age of 12 weeks have it
immunised.
The training of a sheepdog
takes about six months of care-
ful, patient teaching. Using a
long rope, teach the dog to
sit down and come behind by
word-of-command, and later
to a whistle. After this, get it
interested in sheep.
The next step is to teach the
dog to cast. Start by using a
short cast, teaching it not to
cross between you and the
sheep and making it stay be-
hind and sit down, learning
patience and a slow approach.
Now teach the dog to work
sheep, and give a little praise
after each lesson, so that it
will want to work again.
When training for sheepdog-
trials use easy obstacles at
first, gradually making them
more difficult as the dog learns.
For early training it’s best to
use sheep accustomed to being
put through the obstacles.
Runs of up to five miles a day
are necessary to keep a dog in
condition for trial-work.
Training sheepdogs can be
profitable. Good working-dogs
are sometimes sold for as
much as £3OO.
Dingo Crosses
“Gravelsnatcher”: The dingo
was formerly classed as Canis
dingo, but when its ability to
produce fertile crosses by
mating with domestic breeds
was proved beyond doubt it
was admitted to the broader
classification Canis familiaris,
with the variety name dingo
tacked on.
Whether dingoes will cross
readily depends largely on
juvenile associations. An
Alsatian or any other breed
reared in the company of
dingoes would mate with them,
possibly more readily than
with members of its own
breed.
A similar fact is used by
mule-breeders. A jack-donkey
which-is to be mated with
mares to produce mules is
reared in the company of colts
and fillies. Regarding itself as
belonging with horses, it will
mate with mares rather than
with jennets.
Egg Prices
“Pieter Nuyts”: I’ll accept
“K.’s” figures for his egg-
returns (B. 6/1/’6O), but only
for the purpose of demonstrat-
ing the fallacies of his argu-
ment.
He says that with eggs retail-
ing at 6s. a dozen his share,
after costs, is Is. and the
board’s pool-deduction is also
Is. —and, as he says, it won’t
take less. The truth is, it can’t,
because'too few of “K.’s” eggs
are being sold locally. The
pool-charge is to make-up the
leeway on eggs pulped and sold
overseas at a loss. Can’t “K.”
see that if his eggs were all
sold locally at 6s. a dozen he’d
get that pool-charge as well,
giving him double his present
income?
My argument, which still
holds, is that if 9d. of that
pool-charge went to the public
by way of reduced prices “K.”
would still get another 3d. a
dozen —in other words, a 25
per cent. rise.
But my argument went

further than prices. I said:
“A housewife who now has to
pay an exorbitant price for
anaemic-looking eggs would
accept the same price as right
for eggs that could be relied
upon for quality."
I stand by that, but will add
“and appearance.” I feed my
fowls greens—as much as
they’ll eat —and I get colored
yolks that create an appetite
for eggs. I won’t have a male
bird on the place, and I gather
the eggs often and store them
in a cool place. Anybody who
buys my eggs is getting an
appetising product of high
quality. And they’ll come back
for more.
It’s as simple as that. Yet
more than 50 per cent, of eggs
marketed are pale, with flabby
whites, the sight of which
would turn a customer off eggs
for weeks. That’s what hap-
pens ; and that’s why “K.” and
every other egg-producer has
to pay that bob-a-dozen pool-
charge. The public is not so
much refusing to pay the prices
asked as declining to eat the
product offered.
Recently the W.A. Egg
Marketing Board broke two
eggs out of each consignment
received in one week at the
Perth floors and graded for
color. It didn’t set a high
standard —its “good” was from
good to not bad ; “pale,” to
my eye, was hardly yellow,
“poor” showed less color still,
and “very poor” was awful. In
some you could hardly detect
the yolk.
Yet 11.62 per cent, of the
week’s consignment was
graded “very poor" and
another 20.89 per cent, “poor.”
A further 31.49 per cent, was
rated “pale”—poor, in my
judgment—leaving only 36 per
cent, really suitable for sale.
There are Westralian families
which hardly ever eat eggs
because the eggs won’t sell
themselves.
Those consignments couldn’t
be expected to grade 100 per
cent, top quality—there are
too many variables involved.
But they should have graded
99 per cent, rich-colored
yolks, because that’s a simple
standard to obtain. All that’s
required is for every poultry-
farmer to feed plenty of greens
or one of the meal substitutes.
Of the lot, greens are far the
best and simplest.
Whether “K.” likes it or
not, he’s got to get used to
regarding the home-market as
his only worth-while source of
income. It’s useless to talk of
over-production. How would
you reduce it? By a quota
system? That’s being mooted
in W.A. now; and, quite apart
from strenuous opposition, its
difficulties seem far greater
than any likely result.
There isn’t a surplus of eggs
in Australia today—only a
shortage of egg-eaters. The
market will reveal itself as
soon as poultryfarmers .as a
body decide to market only
rich-colored yolks in good-
quality eggs.
Export Butter
“North": Two - and - a - half
years ago, the Queensland
Butter Marketing Board intro-
duced a new type of butter,
which sold well locally at Id. a
pound dearer than the ordinary
article.
Samples were recently sent
overseas and buyers in Great
Britain have shown interest
in the new product, one
importer having ordered
1000 boxes, while another two
merchants have each ordered
8 tons (320 boxes) as a trial-
shipment. One buyer has said
that, if the consignment comes
up to expectations, he may
need as much as 100 tons a
month.
The board has already
shared the process with N.S.W.
and Victoria and at present a
factory in Sydney and another
in Melbourne are producing the
new butter. If the export-
demand exceeds Queensland’s
facilities, these States will be
asked to work the process full,
time.
Another milk-product which
the board is selling is ghee, ex-
ported to Singapore, Malaya
Thailand, Hong Kong, Fiji’
Mauritius, Africa and Medi-
terranean countries. This pro-
duct has been manufactured in
India for centuries, but Queens-
land’s article is superior to the
Indian ghee and over 800 tons
are produced annually. There’s
a good home-market for it, too.
Ghee is pure butterfat and;
is made from pure creamery
butter, which is melted,
neutralised, separated an d
boiled under vacuum, and then
clarified and cooled before
canning. It is recommended
for people who cannot eat
foods cooked in fat because
of stomach disorders, and as
well it gives good flavor to
any food cooked in it.
Moisture-content and
Wheat
“Dileabach”: The way the
Grain Elevators Board has
been worrying about moisture
in wheat lately is almost
pathetic. Wheat is continually
turned away from the silos
on an instrumental reading of
more than 11.5 per cent,
moisture. This ruling has
been applied to grain which
ripened several weeks earlier
and had a shower of rain on it
after it was stripped.
Long queues of trucks wait
while the hydrometer is
plunged into just about every
bag on the truck, giving as many
different results. Half-an-houi'
of valuable stripping-time was
wasted on one truck recently,
though not a single reading
was above 11 per cent, and
every load from the same
paddock stripped the same
day had passed without quibble,
The fact is that the use of 1
direct-reading instruments for
determining the moisture of
wheat is worse than useless,
One harvest, stripped a week 1
previously and left in unsewn
bags covered with a tarp>
could reasonably be expected;
to give similar readings. The
first reading in the morning
gave 9 per cent, moisture, but
by two o’clock it had risen to
10.5 per cent. Next morningj
the reading began at 10 P

to 11.5 per cent. The temper 3

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(28/1/’60)
Rainfall looks like being patchy in Queensland during
February, although heavy rains are likely in the northern
half of the State, with flooding on the coast from Mackay
northwards. Rainfall should be moderate in southern
Queensland, and light in part of the Maranoa, and in the far-
western and far-south-western districts. Good rains are
indicated during March.
N.S.W. should receive moderate patchy rains during
February, although heavier falls may occur in the central-
western districts and on the South-west Slopes. Heavy rains
and flooding are probable on the North Coast during March,
although rainfall may be patchy elsewhere, with heavy rains
and serious flooding during May.
Rainfall is likely to vary from moderate to good in
Victoria during February, although the Mallee and
Wimmera may have only light to moderate rain. Patchy
rains are indicated in March and April, with good seasonal
rains in May.
South Australia can expect only patchy rainfall during
February, apart from possible heavy storm-rains in the
central districts. Good rains are likely in the agricultural
areas during May.
Most of Western Australia should receive good rains
during February, although the Gascoyne and Eucla districts
may have only light rain. Fairly good rains are likely
during March.

absorbed moisture became free
moisture, which is all that the
instruments will record. The
longer wheat is left in such
conditions, the higher the
moisture-content will appear,
though the wheat is losing
moisture all the time.
Instruments are suspect, too.
Two-hundred tested in Vic-
toria this season were reported
to give the same reading. But
the method of testing is to
wrap a wet rag around the busi-
ness-end and take the reading—
-95 per cent. That has little
relation to the other end of
the scale. Three instruments in
the same bag of wheat at one
time gave readings a full 1 per
cent, apart.
There's only one way to
determine the water-content of
anything. That is to heat it
over a water-bath for a
standard time and work on the
loss of weight. This method
gives a dead-reckoning of all
moisture, free and absorbed,
and, judging from the usual
time taken for instrumental
testing, is nearly as fast.
As wheats with 7 per cent,
protein and 12 per cent, pro-
tein, cracked grain and whole,
saffron-thistle and all are
poured in together without
regard, there seems little point
in rejecting wheat slightly over
the standard for moisture. A
docking for the extra weight of
water would be sensible, pro-
vided the water-bath test were
used.
To damn the instrumental
test for good and all and ex-
pose the folly of fastidious
standards for moisture-content
of wheat, it’s enough to say that
wheat admitted to silos at under
11.5 per cent, gives readings
inside the silo of over 15 per
cent. Perhaps the wheat does
sweat —or will the Grain
Elevators Board claim there is
a local thunderstorm inside the
silos every night?
Baled Silage
“Ruddigore”: It pays to bale
silage rather than put it loose
into the pit.
If the crop is dry it’s best
1° bale immediately behind the
mower. If the crop is sappy,
though, let it wilt for half-a-
hay first, to control the
temperature of bales in the pit.
There's no trouble in baling
the crop. Material goes through
the baler easier when green
than when dry. A bale of
about 601 b. is the best size to
handle —at over 701 b. they take
a bit of juggling, especially
when being hauled out of the
pit.
When baled, the crop should
be tied with rot-proof twine, so
that bales can be pulled out of
the pit by the twine. A certain
amount of shrinkage takes
place, but not enough to cause
the bale of silage to fall apart
when handled after a period
underground.
The ordinary type of trench
is used for conserving baled
silage. Bales can be laid cross-
ways or longways in the
trench. If laid crossways, only
the ends of two bales in each
row are against the earth. The
other way, the bales touch
soil all the way down one
length of the side on the two
outside rows.
The ends of the trench need
special attention when you’re
stacking. A good rule is to
lay the first bale in the second
layer 3in. or 4in., further in
from the end than the layer
immediately below it. Finish-
off the other end the same way.
Thus, each end will slope in-
wards, building a more solid
stack, which can easily be com-
pressed.
Baled silage must be com-
pressed just the same as loose
silage. The best way is to run
the tractor over the mass until
the correct temperature is
reached. Compressing to a
temperature of 97deg.-102deg.
will make a palatable silage that
keeps well. If the temperature
is too low the mass will be soft
and useless. Too high a
temperature will blacken the
green-material and make it un-
palatable to stock.
One advantage of packing
the bales crossways in the
trench is that the tractor
flattens them when they are
rolled. The heavy weight of
the machine presses them out
so that they pack tightly against
the side of the trench.
The tighter they are packed
the better. If there is a space
between the wall of the trench
and the bales, air and water will
get in and spoil the resultant
silage.
After the trench is filled the
bales are covered with earth
and rolled down to form an air-
tight cover. Some farmers find
it pays to cover the top of the
bales with tarred paper or
similar material before putting
on the final covering of earth.
This keeps soiling down to a
minimum. If this is done the
only spoilage should be at the
ends of the bales, where they
press against the wall of the
trench ; it wouldn’t amount to
5 per cent, of the mass in the
trench.
Feeding-out is easier when
the material is ensiled in bales.
Once the trench is uncovered
and the first bale removed the
others can be taken out easily.
Baled silage is also easily
loaded onto a truck for feed-
ing-out in stalls or in the
paddock, and also makes it
easier to estimate the exact
amount of green - material
ensiled and the amount fed than
is possible with silage conserved
in a loose form.
Baled silage can also be con-
served in the form of a stack
covered with an airtight sheet,
though plastic sheeting is ex-
pensive and usually only lasts
one term. Compression of an
overhead stack is not as easy
as a trench, and this,, with the
cost of sheeting and the diffi-
culty of keeping the air out
of the stack, has made many
shy away from stack-silage.
Food for Fowls
“F.8.K.”: “Pieter Nuyts”
(B. 4 /1 / ’6O) advised poultry-
farmers to mow an acre of
irrigated lawn for greenfeed or
pay professional lawn-mowers
for clippings. Ten years ago
his advice might have been
good. But at present, in the
eastern States at least, poultry-
farmers would lose time and
money by following it.
The vitamin requirements of
poultry can be met by adding
a proprietary line to the mash
or buying ready-mixed foods.
Yolk-color can be brought up
to standard by adding 5 per
cent, lucerne-meal.
An increasing number of
layers are kept in cages, so
giving each fowl its proper
ration of lawn-clippings would
not be easy. If farmers favor
lawn-clippings they should
regularly fertilise the area with
Mo. super, and sow white-
clover or sub.-clover in the
early autumn to provide
winter greens when kikuyu is
dormant.
I have found it takes six
kerosene-buckets a day of
greens for each 1000 layers.
Any more is wasted. They
can do with less for a while
with no perceptible loss in rate
of lay or fading of yolk-color.
Chaffed greenstuff should be
fed immediately and never kept
in bags. I find it best to give
them greenstuff just before
roosting-time, because they do
not substitute greens for food
at that time.
Most mowers have no grass-
catchers, anyhow, and only
rotary mowers can cope with
the lush growth which occurs
after heavy summer rain.
An electrically powered
chaffcutter might be a better
because green
maize can be quickly run
through it, and a poultryfarm
can usually grow a patch of
succulent green maize at the
bottom of the runs, where it
gets the drift from the pens.

(From E. J. Lea-Scarlett, Society
of Australian Genealogists): (1)
The flood of February 15, 1863,
when the Clarence River rose to
between 60ft.-70ft. at Tabulam, was
the first really bad one in that
district. John Foy, the Tabulam
policeman, had returned to the
police-station to get some papers.
He was trapped, and after spending
an hour on the roof was at length
washed away and drowned as he
prayed. He left a widow and six
young children. George Mann,
William Sloman, William May and
his son George May were also
drowned at Tabulam at this time.
Valentine Kempnich, aged 29, was
drowned at Great Marlow.
The water at Grafton was 24ft.
high. Many farmers and free-
selectors, settled along the river,
suffered great loss and misery
through the flood. Cases and other
articles swept away from Tabulam
were found at Lawrence and
Yamb'a.
(2) Other Clarence floods
during the century: 1839, no
details; January, 1841, river about
17ft. at Grafton; January, 1848,
no details; similarly May 9, 1848;
February 20, 1857, river 19ft. at
Grafton; June 10, 1857, higher

Method for combating fungus-
diseases in cabbage ?
The most prevalent diseases are
clubrot, mildew and blackleg. For
clubrot, lime the ground at the
rate of lib. to the square-yard from
10 to 12 months at least before
planting. For mildew, pickle the
seeds before sowing and use new
soil for making the seedbeds. Spray
the young plants with half-strength
Bordeaux-mixture when just above
the ground, and again when about
2in. high. For blackleg, pickle the
seeds before sowing and sow in
seedbeds made with fresh, new soil.
When seedlings are just above the
ground, spray them with half-
strength Bordeaux-mixture, and
then with a mixture of one part
arsenate-of-lead to 25gals. water.
This spray destroys the cabbage-
maggot which causes wounds in the
plants. »

REHEARSAL WITH BRUNO
Tn The Birth of a Performance
1 (Coronet KLC 512-513)
Bruno Walter gives a fascinat-
ing exposition of the con-
ductor's art; but it is really
more than that, for viola-
voiced Dr. Walter is so in-
tensely thorough, so meticulous
about fine points, that the
whole thing, while demonstrat-
ing certain universal aspects,
leans pleasantly towards a
distinct personal approach.
This set of two records was
first issued in 1957 as a
Mozart Bicentennial Com-
memorative Issue. The aim is
to give listeners a complete
look-in at a rehearsal, and the
work used is Mozart’s four-
movement “Linz” Symphony
"a concise, sunnily tuneful
piece of writing. The rehearsal
itself—an actual rehearsal, not
a studio mock-up —occupies
three sides of the disks ; the
finished performance fits neatly
°n the fourth.
Little by little, as Walter
B?es about the rehearsal, the
Pieces fall into shape. “Now,
gentlemen, ve rehearse,” he
says right at the beginning;
and the Columbia Symphony
Orchestra plunges gallantly
mto the dotted rhythm of the
Mening Here they
strike trouble: “Your eighths
are too long!” Walter says
urgently, and they do it again,
not once or twice but six times,
with the conductor singing
snatches and uttering exhorta-
tions.
A few bars on: “I tell you,
you could give a leetle more
espressivo here”; and later, to
draw from his violins a
shining tone, the single expres-
sive word: “Singing! ”
Walter gets quietly frantic
at such disgusting things as
slightly misjudged timing and
failure to deliver judicious
accents. But when he stops the
orchestra to explain how a
particular phrase should go it
is never with a schoolmasterish
frown: always he is the
patient and understanding col-
laborator.
Thus the progress of the first
movement is marked by pains-
taking repetition and polishing.
There is really little difference
between an orchestral re-
hearsal and a choir-practice,
except, of course, in the
nature of the forces used. Any
choirmaster in Australia who
followed Walter’s example
might reasonably expect his
choir to be of English-
cathedral standard.
One of the special features
of Walter’s conducting is his
massive string-control ; and
when he gets to the serene
second movement he starts by
telling the first-violins how to
play their opening melody, then
hearing them: “Lines, my
friends, lines!” he says at the
end of the second attempt;
meaning, no doubt, to think
of the music more in terms jof
horizontal phrase-lengths than
as a series of vertical linked
chords.
Walter here is rather like a
persistent bulldog, chasing the
gentle melody in the making
with swift expressive comments.
Present reviewer lost count of
the number of times he took his
players back to the beginning
of this lovely theme; but each
time the control tightens,
certain very slight faults —
almost unnoticeable, except that
Walter highlights them—iron-
out, and the workshop begins
to produce music. That is,
until the next section is
tackled, when the process
repeats itself.
He has a word to the brass
when they “come in on six”:
“Better a little short,” he says,
after their sustained spot of
coloring beneath the weaving
strings, “than too long.” And
proceeds to demonstrate by
singing.
This impression of a crafts-
man getting results lifts the
whole of the rehearsal out of
the purely specialist field. There
will always be admiration for
the sincere artist, and on this
the techniques, too numerous to
mention here, for welding
individuals into a precisely
integrated body.
The breezy little menuetto
movement gets a shorter in-
vestigation, largely because it’s
so brief; but there is the
same gently fanatical urgency:
“Yes, yes, keep the E Flat, my
friends; ya, da, ya, da” A
little later, the cry: “Tympani! ’’
Then: “Pianissimo!’’ And the
curious: “Gentlemen. I am
not happy with these little
dum-de-dums.” One is still
pondering this as the orchestra
moves on when: “More
tenuto, my friends!”
The skittish presto final
movement gets the works: here
Walter does a great deal more
singing of bits of the theme
and, possibly in sympathy with
the bustling spirit of the move-
ment, throws-in such comments
as “Now!” and “Yes!” etc. But
on the whole he seems to let
the players have their heads.
It would perhaps be point-
less to mention that the
finished performance, which
occupies the complete final side,
is excellent. Indeed, the album
could be bought for this sec-
tion alone. But the rehearsal is
entirely fascinating, and
Coronet has boxed the disks
attractively in an illustrated
album (foreword by Neville
Cardus) with, apart from many
photos of Walter and the
orchestra in action, a full
orchestral score printed on
shiny white paper.

First of the social committees to shake
off the school-holiday trammels and
gather together in order to plot good-
works for the coming year is the com-
mittee, working (under the guidance of
president Mrs. Bill White) for the
Institution for Deaf and Blind Children.
The first of their functions is to be a
morning-tea and cooking-demonstration
at the Bistro on February 18, the second
a Mexican Revel at the home of the
Paul Kellys (Burraneer Bay) on
February 28. Thb Mexican drink tequila
-(sometimes called “dragon’s breath”)
will be served, and guests may wear
Mexican dress if they have something
suitable—which shouldn’t be hard, as
hand-woven skirts of Mexican design,
fringed at the hem, are all the fashion-
able-rage.
Another big event to be handled by
this committee will be the gala-premiere
of the film “Ben Hur” at the St. James
Theatre, which is having special recon-
structions to theatre and screen for the
event. Wait for it!

It was a remarkably well-dressed
assembly which attended the opening of
the exhibition of fabric-designs at David
Jones’ Gallery, possibly because it repre-
sented fashion as well as art, being the
work that English designers Graham
Sutherland, Oliver Messell and. Cecil
Beaton had done for Sekers Silks. When
Mr. Sekers first saw the drawings and
paintings (so it is related) he felt that
they were far too beautiful and unique
to be stored away after being used.
Hence the exhibition. Lt.-General Sir
William Oliver, U.K. High Commis-
sioner, spoke the opening words, and
those present included Lady Morshead,
Lady Lloyd Jones (who leaves any
minute now for Belfast, Northern
Ireland, where she will be the guest of
Lord and Lady Wakehurst at Govern-
ment House), Admiral and Mrs.
Buchanan, Mrs. Lawrence Byrne and
Leslie Walford. The deep-brimmed hat
was much featured; Mrs. Joseph
Dougherty wore hers in the autumn-
tinted print which also made her dress

The new Child Care Centre at the
Royal North Shore Hospital, which was
opened by Lady Woodward during the
week, is the first of its kind in Sydney.
Its primary purpose is to take care of
children while their parents are visiting
the hospital, but in the evenings it will
be used for classes in child-study for
“expectant parents” (both mummies and
daddies), and next month Dr. Clair
Isbister, honorary-director of the centre,
will give a course in child-development
under the auspices of the Workers’
Educational Association.
The money for this centre was raised
entirely by Rotary and the hospital's
Ladies’ Auxiliary, whose president, Mrs.
Eric Goulston, welcomed Lady Wood-
ward to the opening with the chairman
of the Hospital Board, Sir Norman Nock.
Among those who attended the opening
were Mrs. M. M. Gates, Dr. Grace
Cuthbert-Browne and Professor Browne,
Sir John Northcott, Sir Edward Hall-
strom (who presented a cheque for
£1000), Mr. and Mrs. H. G. Carter and
Miss Susan Snashall, who was responsible
for the delightful fairy-story murals
which decorate the large, airy playroom
for the children.
Moura Lympany, one of the world’s

Symphony Orchestra on Lebruary 16 and
20 under the direction of Australian con-
duct or Charles Mackerras. Born in Corn-
wall, Moura Lympany was a child-
prodigy and began studying music when
she was seven years old; now she
appears regularly in the world’s great
music-centres. She has been married for
eight years to Ben net Korn, a New York
radio- and TV-executive, runs a house
in New York’s East Side and a week-
ender at Locust Valley, Long Island,
where her love of gardening finds expres-
sion. Since her marriage Miss Lympany
has limited her concert-engagements to
about 50 a year, preferring to devote
her time to her husband and friends (she
loves entertaining ) rather than to a com-
pletely professional career. She speaks
Lrench and German fluently and has a
nodding acquaintance with Italian,
Spanish and Russian. A Lellow of the
Royal Academy of Music, she collects
antiques and is a keen reader of
biographies.
Clinging on to mother’s skirts mav

A blue sea and a blue sky, pl us a
water-skiing display on Rose Bay, added
to the decor at the luncheon held at
Caprice during the week in aid of the
Royal Blind Society. To see the guests
arriving one would have thought that
hats had gone out of fashion for
luncheons in Sydney, but the probable
explanation was that unless one had a
Henriette Lamotte hat to wear one
thought it better form not to wear one
at all. Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, president
of the Black and White Ball committee
which did the organising, wore navy
and white with a deep-brimmed hat.
Countess d’Espinay (she is Henriette
Lamotte) compered her own fashion-
parade of hats, Mrs. Paddy Russell being
one of the models.

Auditions for selection for the 18
places in Sydney’s new Opera School at
the Stage Club were held during the
week, when about 50 young people
revealed the wealth of talent there is in
this city at present. Director of the
school Douglas Parnell said that the idea
was for each student to play three
principal roles in a public performance
of opera each year and at other times
to take his or her place in the chorus
or minor roles. Co-operative in basis,
the school will give students a chance to
avoid that roundabout logic, “I can’t
get a job because I have no experience,
but I can’t get experience unless I get
a job.” Well-known conductor and
organist Leonard Burtenshaw is musical*
director, and accompanist 'is Henri 1
Penn. The progress of the school will bj
watched with interest. Remember, wa
must have singers ready for tne time—
about three years hence —when the
Sydney Opera House is open for business.

Mink hats (and at mink prices, too!) '
are being set-out in the smart shops.
They range from £35 to £5O and are
nearly all in the high-crowned Cossack-
style favored by Mr. Macmillan.
Next in favor for hats seems to be
stitched velvet in all the brown and taupe
tones. The most featured style so far on
view is the deep-crowned cloche, fol-
lowed by the slouch, the turban, the beret
(in velvet) and the pillbox. To be really
smart one will wear a bowler with a
curly brim, or a postillion’s hat, but
unless one is really smart before one
puts this type of hat on one had better
not put it on at all!

MELBOURNE
The return of comparatively cool
weather after the recent searing heat,
plus the return of children to school,
las given a new lease of life to young
mothers. Revelling in regained freedom,
they have been relaxing in the
slops, especially those displaying dress-
materials —they are a glorious galaxy of
color. Collins Street has become the
mecca of sidewalk - superintendents as
they watch old buildings torn down and
new ones constructed. Sanity has pre-
vailed over officialdom at the Paris-end
of the street, where the sidewalk-cafes
serve, under gay umbrellas, tea, coffee,
sandwiches and rich French pastries and
where patrons may watch—and, of
course, criticise—the passing throng.

On the dais with the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress (Cr. and Mrs. Bernard
Evans) at the civic reception given for
the recently retired Chairman of Com-
missioners of the Melbourne Harbor
Trust, Mr. A. D. Mackenzie, and his
wife were the Premier, Mr. Bolte;
Minister for Public Works Sir Thomas
Maltby; and the Minister for Local
Government, Mr. Murray Porter, and
Mrs. Porter. A tall bowTof deep-rose-
pink gladioli was set under the Queen’s
portrait at the back of the dais, while
smaller bowls of pastel-toned gladioli
were on the buffet-tables. Mrs. Evans
chose a frock of white-and-sage-green
silk with a small, attractive cap in
similar material. Of self-patterned silver-
heige brocade was the frock worn by
Mrs. Mackenzie with a short matching
jacket and a curvette of chrysanthemums
! n deep-aqua. Mrs. Porter’s frock and
jacket were of midnight-blue printed-
Wo °l, and her flower-cap was in deep-
cream tonings.
Among the guests were Sir Wilfred
Kent Hughes, Mr. and Mrs. Edgar
jjrownbill, Sir Lewis and Lady Burne,
“j r . T°hn and Lady Teasdale, Padre
Oliver (he was formerly in charge of
M eamen ’ s Mission) and Mrs. Oliver,
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Sallman, jnr.,
Margot Evans (her attractive frock was

With jet-black hair and black eyes
denoting her Italian parentage, attractive
Carolyn Maye—she was born in New
York Filomena Firenze Carolina Som-
b rot to—has arrived from the U.S. to
play the leading role of Marian, the
lowa schoolteacher, in “The Music
Man." Her lovely lyric-soprano voice
was trained at the Manhattan School of
Music, since when she has appeared in
many Broadway musicals including “The
King and I,” “Kismet” and “The Most
Happy Fella.” A neat 100-pounder with
a 22-inch waist, which makes her the
ideal wearer of slacks (she has 20 pairs
in her wardrobe), Carolyn is one of the
lucky few who are able to eat what they
like —including those Italian dishes at
thought of which the ordinary weight-
conscious woman would shudder — with-
out fear that the ogre Avoirdupois will
pounce on her. Gordon de Lisle photo.
Well-known TV-star of “Wyatt Earp,”
Hugh O’Brian, made a great hit with his
first-night audience at the Princess
Theatre. It was a dressy night, with
short frocks predominating, these being
mostly of silk-organzas, lace and polished
printed-cottons. But no member of the
audience glittered as did “Wyatt Earp”
in his black suit, the jacket gleaming with
silver embroideries, and a white suit
which had gold sequins and embroidery
on the front and lapels of the jacket.
Mr. and Mrs. Garnet Carroll had Mrs.
Claudia Creswick and Geoffrey Smith
in their box. Mrs. Carroll’s full-length
aqua-blue rippled-organza coat was worn
over a matching frock embroidered with,
white, gold and grey flowers. Mrs.
Creswick chose a slim sheath-frock of
black French-lace, the skirt finished with
a hem of pleated taffeta. Mrs. Norman
Lynch added a full-length turquoise-
blue knitted-wool coat to her white
guipure-lace frock ; her daughter Leveda
wore a honey-colored organza coat over
a polished-cotton frock in yellow-and-
white. Mrs. David Martin (over from
Sydney for the Tommy Steele show,
which opens this week at the Tivoli) was
with the Frank Martins. Mrs. Neil
Decker wore over her gold lame frock
a full-length coat of brown silk-organza.
Others in the audience were Misses Eileen
and Jenny Brennan ; Mrs. B. Lyon and
her daughter, Mrs. John Faulkner ; Sir
Norman and Dame Mabel Brookes;
Mr. and Mrs. Leo Guest; Lady
Connolly; and Mr. and Mrs. Maurice
Sloman.

Bunney Brookes produced and takes the
leading feminine role in “Obligato,” a
play set in a small town in Louisiana,
which is currently running at the National
Theatre, Eastern Hill. An unusual credit
in the programme goes to Whelan The
Wrecker, who supplied the handsome fire-
place seen in one of the sets —its source
doubtless one of the buildings that have
been torn-down to make way for more
modern edifices. In the first-night audi-
ence were Sir Robert and Lady Knox,
Mrs. Massey Burnside, Mrs. R. Dawes,
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Ebbels, Mr. and Mrs.
R. Chappie and Mrs. Kurt Geiger.

At Flemington on Saturday an over-
cast sky and a cool breeze made summer
frocks less in favor than suits and coat-
frocks. Mrs. Neil Rogers was one of the
smart women to choose a navy ensemble.
Of wool-crepe, the skirt was slim, and to
the tailored bodice was attached a short
cape; a tiny white straw pillbox-hat
misted with navy veiling completed the
outfit. Mrs. Lionel Newton chose a
navy frock-and-jacket ensemble, with
which went a small white Breton sailor-
hat. Miss Kathleen Syme was another
who chose navy, gaining contrast with a
hat in bright-red (the bag had been
presented to her on her retirement as
president of the Royal Women’s Hospital
committee). Mrs. Frank Watt chose a
jacket-suit of sapphire-blue French-lace
and matched it with a small blue straw
toque. Lady Hyde covered her black-
and-white-printed silk frock with a short-
sleeved black coat; her head-covering
was a large flat bow of olive-green satin
to which was attached a fine veil. She
was with Mrs. Wallace Meares and her
daughter, of Forbes (N.S.W.).
With her slate-blue lightweight tweed
suit Mrs. Oscar Bowden wore a deep-
cream faille petal-cap. Mrs. Bryan
Foster’s choice was a junior-navy frock
and jacket and hyacinth-blue draped
beret. Mrs. Henry Burrell looked smart
in a full-length coat and frock of light-
br@wn-and-white small-checked wool;
her large mushroom-hat was of matching
brown figured-organza. Mrs. Arthur
Joyce’s full-length coat and frock were
of pastel-pink angora; her small cap
was of white flower-motifs. She was
accompanied by Mrs. M. Perry and
daughter Helen, of Sydney. A natural-
tweed suit and matching off-the-face hat
were worn by Mrs. Sue Cain. Elizabeth
Mildred wore a London-tan outfit, Ann
Wilkinson a black-and-white-check suit
and Angela Rau a high-crowned pink
tulle hat with a natural-toned silk suit.


Kubler on architecture, an extremely
formidable section.
It may be difficult to write grace-
fully and not too technically about
architecture; and perhaps, since archi-
tects generally are not subjected to the
searchlights that beat upon the private
lives of artists and writers, it may be
very difficult to bring much color into
an account of their lives; but all such
problems are a challenge which the
writer on architecture, unless he wants
to restrict his audience to other archi-
tects, must meet.
Here and there in Kubler’s survey
you do strike a moment of life. It is
pleasing, for example, to come across
Pedro de Ribera (1683-1742). described
by the neo-classical critic Llaguno as
a delirious fool who should have been
committed to a madhouse —he was
rather, says Kubler, “the crest of a
great wave of exuberant decoration” —-
and to reflect, not for the first time,
that fury in art-criticism is not new.
It is interesting to read how the differ-
ent religious orders in Mexico inspired
different styles of architecture, and to
discover to how great an extent archi-
tectural styles in Latin America were
influenced by the earthquakes, which
inclined the architects towards short,
squat buildings that would not fall
down too readily.
But on the whole this is severely
technical writing, not helped by a sort
of half-humorous academic approach
which leads Kubler to say that the
architecture of the Gulf and Caribbean
settlements developed “a hypertrophy
of the defensive tissues,” instead of
telling us something about the fighting
in the forts which this peculiar phrase
describes; and it is not until Martin
Soria gets going on the sculptors and
painters that the book comes to life.
Almost at once Soria gives us, as
well as the proper technical informa-
tion, the story of the exuberant Torri-
giani (1472-1528) who broke Michel-
angelo’s nose and died of a hunger-
strike in the Sevillian prison of the
Inquisition, to which he had been com-
mitted for breaking a statue of the
Madonna which he had made and
which displeased a client. Then the!
is an intriguing account of the religi 0 |
statues which were furnished with wil
and glass eyes to heighten their veri
similitude; and so to Soria’s comparj
son of Velasquez and El Greco, which
as readable criticism must be, is j
once technical and human:—
✓
Through Velasquez’ genius, dwarf
and princess, fool and king immedi-
ately gain our participation, under-
standing and compassion. Empathy
with his subjects marks the born
aristocrat Velasquez as a truly
democratic portrait-painter, in con-
trast to Greco, who projected his
own personality on his sitters.
If Soria thus makes the might
volume readable, there are a few othe
obstacles, beside Kubler’s prose, whicl
should be mentioned: chiefly thi
placing of the plates at the end; which
if economical, robs them of a grea
deal of the value they would have i
used at the appropriate places t(
illustrate the text. The curioit

POEMS FROM KURRAJONG
By Kenneth Mackenzie
[These poems by Kenneth Mackenzie were discovered among his
papers and will be included in a collected edition of his verse to be
published this year.]
MOUSE
A small mouse
comes every night
to clean my house
by moonlight.
When in my bed
I sleep sound,
like someone dead,
it glides around
the four walls,
the earthen floor.
No crumb falls
unaccounted for.
Starlight or storm,
it matters not:
the dawn’s alarm,
the creaking cot
trouble it less
than that l may
rudely miss
supper one day.
My floor is clean,
my table clear:
my mouse has been
gleaning here,
It cannot be
so very fat.
My poverty
must see to that —
but then I know
it cannot be lean:
my house is so
uncommon clean !
THE WAGTAIL’S NEST
Moulded in cobweb, horse-hair, cow-
hair, grass and soft, stray feathers
the nest is a cup shaped by the beak of
desire and the breast of love
accurately yet with a careless look set
in the joint of a slender
sloping branch of the dying pepper-tree.
The hen's touch is tender,
she smoothes the lip of the cup with her
black throat and every amorous
move
she makes is a pledge of the nest’s
strength against time and all
weathers.
The eggs in the bowl of the grey nest are
the fruits of love that flowered apart
in a petalled spreading of wings when the
wind was cold and the days came
blue and bright.
Another dying tree with a gallant
desperate gesture plumed its age
with green
feathery pinnate leaves more perfectly
curved than even its youth’s had
been
so that when the increasing moon of the
month shone stronger late at night
fluttering shadows touched the sitting
bird with dark and delicate art.
The cock unsleeping sings all night m

floures and scrollwork, would tre-
mendously enliven the architectural
section if you could see them as you
went along. And the plates are pro-
vided with most inadequate captions,
having neither page-numbers for refer-
ence back to the text nor even the
usual details as to size and medium.
But all in all, running to 445 pages,
with 192 pages of black-and-white
reproductions, and giving for the first
time a comprehensive picture of the
arts of Spain and Portugal with their
developments in Latin America, it is
indeed a mighty work: pleasant and
informative for the general reader,
indispensable for the specialist.

Arnold Wall's Words
■ It is a little surprising to find
instructions on how to pronounce
(“Nanga Parbat” in Arnold Wall’s New
Zealand English (Whitcombe and
Tombs, Ltd.), but perhaps that is be-
cause the activities of Riddiford,
Bryant, George Lowe, Hillary and the
rest, continually dashing up outlandish
mountains, have brought the Hima-
layan peaks to everybody’s lips in New
Zealand; or perhaps it is simply be-
cause Wall himself, as well as being
a poet, a professor and a broadcaster,
has also been a mountaineer in the
Himalayas.
It could be, too, that Wall has a
special interest in the “ng” sound, the
problem of which arises many times
"ben he is considering the way New
Zealanders mutilate the beautiful
■Maori language. He says that in
Maori words “ng” should always be
Pronounced as in “singer,” which solves
me problem of “Whangarei” and
Wanganui” satisfactorily—except that
New Zealanders will probably go on
calling them “Wonggarei” and “Wong-
ganui”—but which still leaves you in
s °me doubt as to what you do with
sach fearful problems as “Ngaere” and
Ngauruhoe” (the volcano). How do
you pronounce “ng” as in “singer’*
at the beginning of a word? Professor
Wall himself seems to have given up
in despair here, for he is content to
settle for “Nowroohoe” and, presum-
ably, “Niery”—or something close to
that.
“Nanga Parbat,” at any rate, is
“Nungga Purbat”; and so far as the
Himalayas themselves are concerned,
it is a relief to find that Wall is quite
content with “Himmalaya” and doesn't
insist on the pedantic “Himahlaya”
with the accent on the “ah,” a noise
which has always considerably dis-
mayed this reviewer. It is a pity, while
he was on the subject, that Wall didn’t
give a lead on “Kanchenjunga,” a word
which always looks a little ambiguous.
Wall is particularly interesting on
the Maori pronunciations, for these are
a problem rarely discussed outside New
Zealand—though really someone in
Australia (presumably Sidney J. Baker)
should do something about them: for
if Wall is bothered merely because New
Zealanders say “Wong” instead of
“Whung” in “Wanganui,” how much
more distressed he would be over here
where it always emerges as a plain
and dreadful “Wang,” rhyming with
“bang” and “hang”; and if he is
worried about “whare” over there,
which is always “worri” instead of
“whurri.” what on earth would he say
in Australia where one has heard it
most foully as “where” or “wear,”
rhyming with “stare” and “bear”?
It is good to see that Professor Wall
doesn’t go for the affected “f” for
“wh” in such ever-useful words as
“Wanganui” (or “Whanganui,” as it
ought to be spelt and never will be);
and useful to learn from him that the
“nui” should not be “newi” but “nooi”;
and he should be most profitable of all,
if only his campaign could be success-
ful, which he himself doubts, in his
attempts to slaughter the awful abbre-
viations (“Teamoot,” “Wokker,”
“Pycock” and “Waimack”) which New
Zealanders customarily substitute for
such leisurely and delightful poly-
syllables as “Te Awamutu.” “Whaka-
rewarewa,” “Paekakariki” and
“Waimakariri.” He might have men-
tioned the volcanic peak Paritutu at
New Plymouth, and the old dredge
named after it. both of which always
emerged as “Parrytoot.”
This is the third, revised edition of
Professor Wall’s book, which, besides
discussing mispronunciations of Maori
and straying to Nungga Purbat, is a
general guide to correct pronunciation
(“Nazi” is “nahtsi,” and “No other
pronunciation is permissible”; “New
Zealand” itself should be “Zeeland”
and not “Zilland”). A hundred addi-
tional words are discussed in the new
edition.
Reviewed Briefly
The Sleeping Bride: Dorothy Eden
(MacDonald). There is this young
man whose fiancee walks out into the
moonlight and vanishes. Then there
is trouble in her sister’s flat in London;
and slowly it evolves that the sister
who had been secretary to a mysterious
lawyer is being held in a country
mansion under drugs by a cad who
takes advantage of the situation, while
slow inquiries are being made by the
sister of a rich old lady who has disap-
peared.
* * * *
Death Under Sail: C. P. Snow
(Heinemann). An early detective novel
by an author famous in other fields of
fiction, involving the shooting of a
young man in the steering-well of a
yacht on the Norfolk Broads. As might
be expected, the characterisation of the
group of young Englishmen and
women, in the narration of an elderly
friend, is finer than in most detective
novels, and his eye for the broads and
the bungalow, etc., where they work
out their conclusions, makes a pleasant
holiday of a rather run-of-the-mill
mystery.
* * * *
Stop at Nothing: John Welcome
(Faber). A sort of guide-book thriller
in which the virtuous narrator begins
in Ireland overhearing a threat to a
brilliant young man by a sinister mil-
lionaire. Next the narrator runs into
the young man’s sister in France, where
she is being chased by the huge and
horrible factotum of the sinister
millionaire—after which anything can
happen, and it does, but among people
well informed on pictures, food, motor-
cars and wine.
* * * *
Midnight Trader: Hugh Edwards
(Harrap). An excellent factual account
of smuggling in the Mediterranean,
well and honestly written. Edwards
is an English merchant-marine sailor
who. at a loose-end after the war, took
on the job of skipper to various
smuggling craft. Apparently he was
quite at home among the shoreside
denizens of the Mediterranean sea-
board, French, Spanish and Italian,
and was clearly gifted with the
capacity to establish a command over
them. With his shoreside colleague,
Karel, he established the system of
signals which kept his craft in contact
with the supply-ship, using the tech-
nique of unloading cargo from one
ship to the other while still in motion
at sea, and running it ashore on lonely
beaches at night, which is now the
accepted procedure in all Mediter-
ranean smuggling operations.
